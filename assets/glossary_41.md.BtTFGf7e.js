Ireland and China first established their bilateral foreign relations after they signed the Communique on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations on 22 June 1979. This milestone opened the gate for trades, businesses, politics, education, and tourism between the two countries; both nations have gained enormous growth of economic values. Both countries exchanged ambassadors in 1980. Ireland has an embassy in Beijing, a general consulate in Shanghai and an honorary consulate in Hong Kong; China has an embassy in Dublin. The first historical meeting for the two headers of China and Ireland governments took place in November 1996 when Premier Li Peng met with Taoiseach John Bruton at the World Food Summit (Rome, 1996). By 2019, this bilateral relationship has boomed to a high point, and a ceremony of their 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations was held in Dublin, Ireland in June 2019.  Trading  The trading volumes in China and Ireland have substantially improved after the establishment of diplomatic relations. Initially, the trade volume was only US$6.90 million. By 2000, Ireland had invested 34 projects in China and offered pledged investment of US$89.30 million with real input of US$19.28 million\\". According to the data on 2018, Ireland exported US$10.8 billion worth of goods, up 33.51 percent year on year. Now, Ireland becomes the first EU beef exporter to the Chinese market in a hope of Irish people to open a new farm market. Irish mainly exports food and dairy to China ‚Äî trade has almost doubled to 8 billion euros ($9 billion) during Enda Kenny's tenure, who was the Prime Minister of Ireland during 2014‚Äì2017. Looking on the other side, China also exports \\"parts of household appliances and radio communication equipment, clothes, medicine, ships, etc.\\". By 2018, bilateral trade between the two countries hit a high point, reaching ‚Ç¨17 billion in goods and services. However, the US‚ÄìChina trade war in 2019 negatively affected Ireland's export goods to China. Ireland is known for exporting high-end chips that mainly export to China to make final products which are frequently shipped on to the US. The trade war impacts both Chinese and Ireland's economic growth.  Education  Irish College Of Traditional Chinese Medicine The booming relationships between the two nations affect the educational aspect of both countries as well. China and Ireland signed the Agreement on Education Cooperation between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of Ireland in October 2000. Since then, the number of Chinese students studying in Ireland increased. By June 2000, the number of Chinese students in Ireland has reached 2,500. By 2019, there are about 3,500 Chinese students enrolled in higher education schools in Ireland and 1500 enrolled in English-language courses. In 2019, the Institution of Chinese Language and Culture located in Ireland has begun to offer beginning adult Chinese classes, business Chinese for companies and professionals, and Chinese extracurricular courses for children. Most of the teachers who teach Chinese are native speakers from China, and the majority of them work with Dublin institutions. Irish and Chinese colleges have started cooperative university programs recently.  Business  Huawei Office Building in Ireland In April 2000, Ireland and China initiated an ‚ÄúAgreement for the Avoidance of Double Taxation \\"; they also signed \\"Agreement on Scientific and Technological Cooperation\\" in the following September. These documents helped the two nations developing their foreign relations and economic growth by increasing job opportunities and wages. By 2019, there are about 37 Chinese companies in Ireland that have 3,200 employees in total. \\"The mobile company Three Ireland, owned by CK Hutchison from Hong Kong, is the largest Chinese employer in Ireland, with about 1,400 employees.\\" Another well-known Chinese company that has established offices in Ireland is Huawei, the most-used cellphone brand by Chinese people. Huawei has 200 people working in Dublin, Cork and Athlone's offices. This company strategy becomes a key step for Huawei setting its international orientation and provides job opportunities for Irish people that responding to the call from the Chinese government of building friendly relations with Ireland. On the other side, some Irish companies also their market By 2019, there are more than 400 Irish companies who have successfully entered into the Chinese market.  Tourism  Dublin Chinese New Year Festival 2014 The friendly diplomatic relations between China and Ireland promote cultural exchange and traveling over the years. In Ireland, beginning in 2012, more than 93 percent of immigrants are from China. In China, there are about 9,000 Irish citizens currently living within the country. In recent years, Ireland becomes one of the hottest recommended countries to travel to. By 2019, there are almost 40,000 Chinese travellers visit Ireland a year according to the official data. Moreover, Irish tourism authorities want to increase the number of visitors from China to 50,000 a year. Furthermore, Hainan Airline from China opens direct flights between Dublin and three Chinese cities- Beijing, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong. On the ceremony of the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations held in June 2019 in Dublin, Minister for Justice and Equality Charlie Flanagan announced that the Irish government welcomes Chinese visitors and would issue a five-year multi-entry visa option for Chinese people, which started in July 2019. There are around 16,500 people of Chinese descent living in Ireland, largely concentrated in the cities of Limerick and Dublin.

Knight, Senator Charles Dick, presidential candidate Wendell Willkie, industrialist Paul Litchfield, and Alcoholics Anonymous founder Dr. Robert Smith, as well as the founders of the Goodyear and Firestone rubber companies, have lived here in the Merriman Heights portion. Located between Memorial Parkway to the south and Portage Country Club, and Sand Run Park to the north, Portage Path on the west to the train tracks east of Bell Ridge Road, Merriman Heights consists of homes built between 1911 and the present and is one of Akron's wealthiest neighborhoods. Beginning with the construction of Stan Hywet Hall (by the Seiberlings, founders of Goodyear) in the early part of the 20th century, it has long been known as \\"Rubber Baron Heights\\" because all of the great captains of the rubber industry had their homes here. While its age is apparent via the quality of architecture, Merriman Heights remains as pristine as the day it was developed. With Cuyahoga Valley National Park minutes from its doorstep and the best public schools in Akron, Merriman Heights remains one of Akron's premier neighborhoods. Homes generally start at 5000 square feet and can reach 21,000 square feet, such as Stan Hywet Hall. Most having been constructed between 1911 and 1930. A subdivision called Merriman Woods of late-midcentury-modern multi-level homes cascading down the hill from Merriman Road was built in the mid to late 1970s, and contains homes with sizes starting at around 3000 square feet to upwards of 8,000 square feet. House styles in the Heights vary from the French Norman, Large Colonial, and Georgian to Tudor, Spanish, and Renaissance Revival styles, many with indoor pools and situated on wooded lots. Fairlawn Heights Located between Interstate 77 to the southwest and West Market Street to the northeast and bounded by Miller Road to the northwest and Frank Blvd Park to the southeast, Fairlawn Heights is a treasure trove of early to middle 20th century architecture. Once home to the Quaker Oats heiress and the like, this lovely section of Akron boasts large wooded lots nestled along a hillside, giving it the feel of being in the country when only minutes from downtown Akron and the expressway. Houses tend to start in the 3000 sq foot range upwards to 10,000 sq feet, with most having been built in either the late 1920s early '30s, and then again from the late 1940s to the mid 1960s. Many styles of Architecture abound, with Tudor Revival being the main choice, and Georgian revival and colonial a close second, There are French Norman and French Chateaux as well as Bauhaus and mid-century modern next to large 1960s country ranches. Chapel Hill Chapel Hill is one of Akron's two large commercial districts. Located in Northeast Akron it borders Cuyahoga Falls to the north and Tallmadge to the east. The area is mostly commercial north of Tallmadge Avenue, with a commercial and retail mix on Tallmadge Avenue. Single and multi-family residential use predominates south of Tallmadge Avenue. There is major retail development along Home Avenue, Howe Road, and Brittain Road, with the retail area anchored by the Chapel Hill Mall at the northeast corner. Chapel Hill is accessible off Route 8 via three interchanges. Chapel Hill is one of Akron's smaller residential neighborhoods, with only 2.5% of its population and 3% of households. Chapel Hill lost a higher percentage of its population than the City during the 1990s. Although average household income is lower than in the City as a whole, there is also a lower percentage of persons in poverty. 61% of Chapel Hill residents are under 45 years of age. Chapel Hill also has a higher proportion of elderly residents than the City. According to the City of Akron's statistics, there are 5,466 people living in 2,934 households. Chapel Hill is 79% Caucasian. The average household income (1999) is $33,930, about seven thousand lower than the city average. Ellet Ellet is physically separated from the other neighborhoods by a highway Interstate 76, a river (Little Cuyahoga River), and an airport. Ellet petitioned the City of Akron for annexation in 1929. In the 1990s when Akron's total population was reduced by over three percent, Ellet started booming. In fact, one in twelve houses in Ellet were built after 1990. Situated at the far eastern edge of Akron, it borders Mogadore to the east and Springfield Township to the south. Ellet includes many of Akron's bigger attractions including the University of Akron's Rubber Bowl, a former city owned property that was sold to the University for only a penny. Next door is Derby Downs home of the annual All-American Soap Box Derby. The Goodyear Airdock, which used to house construction projects for Goodyear's new blimp designs, is also nearby. Today it is owned by Lockheed Martin, which runs a sizeable operation in Ellet. The Akron Fulton International Airport is also nearby. The airport is municipally owned. Annual flights to and from the airport have increased from 24,000 in 1998 to 35,000 in 2004. The neighborhood includes numerous single-family households. Commercial activity is scattered mostly on East Market Street, part of Ohio Route 18, and Eastgate Plaza on Canton Road (Ohio State Highway 91). In recent years, new retail redevelopment has also taken place south of Hyre Park. According to the City of Akron's statistics there are 18,132 people living in 7,892 households. Ellet is 94% Caucasian. The average household income (1999) is $40,864, representative of the city average. Cascade Valley Cascade Valley (formerly named Elizabeth Park Valley) was developed around the old Ohio & Erie Canal in the mid-19th century. The area is located within a walking distance of Akron's downtown. Many people have old canal locks in their back yards. The park, a part of the Cascade Locks Historic District, is the site of the restored Mustill House & Store, which served as a general store to canal users from the 1820s till the end of the 19th century. The Towpath Trail, which will one day stretch from Lake Erie to New Philadelphia, brings thousands of hikers and bikers to the area each year. According to The City of Akron's statistics there are 4,166 people living in 1,838 households. The average household income (1999) is $28,430. Firestone Park Harvey Firestone embarked on creating a neighborhood with tree-lined boulevards curved around a central park. He saw families of different income levels living together in diverse styles of homes. He saw churches, schools and stores within walking distance. When Seiberling started on his ambitious housing initiatives in Goodyear Heights, Harvey Firestone did not want to be outdone. Like Seiberling, Firestone hired his estate landscape architect, Alling S. DeForest, to design the layout for Firestone Park. Akron officials have pushed the limits of the area beyond its original borders. City publications draw the park as far south as Firestone Country Club, annexed from Coventry Township in 1985. Firestone Park is located in south Akron, bordering Coventry Twp. Firestone has easy access to two expressways, Interstate 77 and Interstate 277 / U.S. Highway 224. The 2000 U.S. census can explain the attraction objectively. It paints a portrait of an educated working-class population with good incomes and home values. Firestone Park, a public park shaped like the original Firestone shield emblem, is at the heart of the community. It is surrounded by churches, a school, a community center, a new library, and a small business district. Goodyear Heights As early as 1910 Frank A. Seiberling, founder and then president of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., realized how detrimental the housing shortage was to his workers and his company. Even though labor was abundant, Seiberling believed that the transient nature of the workforce cost the company a great deal. Training wasn‚Äôt cheap, and the cost of constantly retraining new employees was proving unmanageable. To solve this problem, Seiberling proposed purchasing a large parcel of farmland half a mile from the Goodyear factories. The board was not convinced. The company felt that it was too risky to get involved in the intimate affairs of their employees. However, Seiberling was so committed to the project that he bought the land himself. Seiberling chose a rural plot of land just northeast of Goodyear's main plant. Seiberling hired his personal landscape architect to spearhead the project. He chose sweeping streets over a grid infrastructure and included provision for all modern conveniences like gas, electricity, and telephones. The main thoroughfares were also designed to eventually carry streetcars. One of the key differences between Goodyear Heights and Firestone Park was the hospitality extended to non-employees for the purchase of a home. Though Goodyear opened the door of purchasing a home to all Akron residents, the 25% increase in selling price and the lack of company sponsored financing made it very unlikely that non-Goodyear employees would buy. Goodyear Heights Realty had an explicit policy against selling to African Americans. Goodyear Heights borders Tallmadge to the east and has access to I-76. Goodyear Heights remains an overwhelmingly single-family residential community. There is neighborhood- level retail development at Six Corners. Eastwood Avenue near Darrow Road borders suburban-style strip shopping centers. Goodyear Heights Metropolitan Park provides a wide range of recreational activities to people throughout the area. Though the majority of the housing was constructed between 1940 and 1980, the city has been buying up land to build new developments, the latest one being built along Honodle. According to the City of Akron's statistics there are 20,556 people living in 8,817 households. The average household income (1999) is $42,746, slightly higher than the city average. Highland Square Highland Square is known as one of the more eclectic areas of Akron. It is a pleasant and walkable residential area featuring an organic grocery store, a library, a theater, a cobbler, several restaurants, and some nightclubs and bars. The Square is considered the Arts and hip urbanite district of Akron. Its large number of historical and modern apartment complexes mean that it is more densely populated than the rest of Akron, in which single unit homes are more common. Many of these apartments line the neighborhood's major thoroughfare, West Market Street, making them very accessible. Highland Square is strongly progressive; John Kerry‚Äôs Summit County Headquarters was located in a Highland Square storefront during the 2004 Presidential Election. Many members of the LGBT community have made their home here and many businesses are either gay owned or gay friendly. Although Highland Square is sexually diverse and progressive, it is not as ethnically diverse as other parts of Akron. The commercial part of Highland Square is anchored by the historic Highland Theatre. The Highland Square Neighborhood Association works to maintain the character and atmosphere of the area. Every summer the association promotes and operates PorchRokr Music and Arts Festival, a festival featuring local artists, performers and musicians performing on residential porches and lawns and drawing well over 5,000 people to the neighborhood. Many artists and musicians make their home in Highland Square and their influence and work can be found in the shops and public art found in the neighborhood. The region's oldest feature is the Portage Path, which passes along the street of that name. For decades the statue of an Indian has watched over this famous pathway where Native Americans carried their canoes between the Cuyahoga and Tuscarawas Rivers. The Portage Path was part of the effective western boundary of the white and Native American lands from 1785 to 1805. When first erected by Gus Kasch, an area real estate developer, the Indian statue stood along the curb on West Market Street. The refurbished statue now stands on a landscaped site on the corner of Portage Path and West Market Street. According to The City of Akron's statistics there are 12,561 people living in 6,264 households. The average household income (1999) is $42,958, slightly higher than the city average.  Wallhaven (Sunset View, Hunter's Lodge and Castle)  Situated at the intersections of Market Ave, Exchange St, and Hawkins Ave. Wallhaven is a commercial and rental residential district which houses many of Akron's original and unique points of interest such as: Swensons Hamburger stand, here in its original location (1934) offering some of the best burgers in Akron owing to its secret recipe for hamburger meat; and Ken Stewart's Grille, one of Akron's finest dining experiences. You will also find many essentials here such as banks, bagels, Dry Cleaners, Pharmacies, a Robek's smoothies shop and many others. The Subdivision of Sunset View (houses range from 2200 sq feet to 7500 sq ft and from $190,000 to $380,000) is full of large older houses equal to the size of those found in Merriman Heights and is bounded by Storer Ave and Delia, to the East and South, and Exchange to Elmdale on the North and West. Developed mostly between the early 1920s to the mid 1930s. It's Akron's third premier vintage Housing neighborhood After Merriman Heights and Fairlawn Heights. The O'Neil Mansion, built by William O'Neil (founder of General Tire), is located at the Corner of Mull and Exchange at the center of Sunset View. Castle (1700 sq feet to 2800 sq ft and from $130,000 to the mid-two hundreds) is Located around Castle Boulevard and is bounded by castle like monikers at its entrances off Market, Centered by Castle Boulevard itself. Many attractive homes from the mid-1920s to the mid-1930 line the streets of this area. Hunters Lodge (1500 sq ft to 2400 sq ft and from 100,000 to $150,000) is the area from Mull to Hawkins and boarded by Exchange and Delia, Built on the land that was once used by many of Akron's prominent families as a place to ride horses and hunt. Its Centered by Hunter's Lodge Park who's center piece is the lodge itself. Though many Akronites have forgotten the names of Hunter's Lodge, Castle and Sunset View; the residents of all three subdivisions pride themselves in the rich long history of their Developments. Sunset View especially since it was built on the grounds of an older sanitarium of the same name. Of interest are the homes along Market Starting at Portage Path and ending at Elmdale. At one time this was considered Millionaires row and you'll find many of the large mansions tucked along this stretch of market either as private residences, offices or schools such as Our Lady Of The Elms an all girls school (considered one of the top 10 in Ohio), which occupies what was once a Renaissance Revival Mansion barring the name The Elms. Others include Breaside ( The Belles Arts, Galt family, Mansion) and several of the Firestone Mansions (which range from French Chateau to Georgian and Edwardian) as well as Rocky Knoll which was torn down to build the Rockynol Retirement Community. Kenmore Following the trolley right-of-way between southwest Akron and Barberton, Kenmore developed rapidly between 1910 and 1920 as a new residential area. It was incorporated as a self-sufficient city supporting its own doctors, lawyers, and churches. Kenmore Boulevard served as the retail and commercial center. In 1929 residents of the then City of Kenmore asked to be annexed by the City of Akron. Kenmore is located in the southwest region of Akron and is bisected by Interstate 277 and U.S. Highway 224. According to The City of Akron's statistics there are 18,239 people living in 7,998 households. Kenmore is 90% Caucasian. The average household income (1999) is $39,776.  Sherbondy Hill  The Sherbondy Hill neighborhood (formerly named Lane- Wooster) is located just west of downtown Akron. In the early 20th century, the area became home to African-American families who were moving to Akron from the south. The Akron Zoo, which has recently been remodelled, is located in the Sherbondy Hill area. Miller South School for the Visual and Performing Arts, draws children from all parts of Summit County. It serves children from 4th grade to 8th grade. Wooster Avenue was renamed Vernon Odom Boulevard, a nod to the neighborhood's African American heritage. The area is the largest black neighborhood in Akron, with 87% of residents identifying themselves as such. During the 1970s, the Innerbelt was built and some 3,000 families were displaced. It continues to be a disputed call if the Innerbelt has benefited the inner city; proponents have said it is an essential throughway for Akron's impending growth, while dissenters contend that it has caused Akron to lose some of its cohesiveness. Sherbondy Hill is accessible from three highways, The Martin Luther King Jr. Freeway, Interstate 76 and Interstate 77. According to The City of Akron's statistics there are 9,329 people living in 4,132 households. The average household income (1999) is $28,804. Middlebury The village of Middlebury on the Little Cuyahoga River was the first settlement in what is now Akron. Middlebury is located immediately east of the University of Akron. Middlebury is home to Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company's world headquarters and Summa Hospital. Middlebury is accessible by both Interstate 76 to the south, and Ohio State Highway 8 to the east. Middlebury is the most diversified out of the Akron neighborhoods, with almost six percent of ethnic backgrounds being neither African American nor Caucasian. In the 2000 Census, average household income was 74% of average household income in Akron. Even though household income lagged the City, there was a large percentage drop in persons in poverty and an almost equally large rise in average household income. Middlebury has the highest percentage of pre-1940 housing stock of any City neighborhood. Although some new construction occurred between 1940 and 1980, new housing development was slow in the 1990s. According to The City of Akron's statistics there are 8,062 people living in 3,445 households. The average household income (1999) is $30,600. North Hill North Hill served as one of the melting pots during Akron's expansion and soon many Italians were settling down in the area. The main roads still have low-rise commercial buildings, scattered in between the used car lots and mechanics. Many blame North Hill's problems on the closure of the deteriorated viaduct that connected North Hill to downtown Akron. The All-American Bridge restored the tie in 1981, but things have been slow to improve. The motorists eventually returned, but few businesses did. They bypassed North Hill's aging buildings and limited parking for places like the nearby shopping hub of Chapel Hill, which exploded in the 1980s. Many authentic Italian eateries still stand, harkening back to the old North Hill, when Italian immigrants turned this area into an Old World village where they could speak their native language and partake in the traditions of their homeland. Although the area still has pockets of Italians, the area has largely diversified since the great white flight. According to the U.S. Census, the share of North Hill residents claiming at least partial Italian ancestry was 20% in 1980, 17% in 1990, and 15% in 2000. According to The City of Akron's statistics there are 16,272 people living in 7,048 households. North Hill is 73% Caucasian. The average household income (1999) is $40,240, which is representative of the city's average. Rolling Acres (Now a part of Kenmore) With just more than 1,000 housing units, Rolling Acres was the least residential of Akron's 25 neighborhoods. Rolling Acres, like Chapel Hill, was a major commercial hub, stationed at the south-western border of Akron. The now-defunct Rolling Acres Mall was once the neighborhood's anchor. Rolling Acres had more undeveloped land than is typical of Akron neighborhoods. The Rolling Acres Mall and big box retail once dominated Romig Road. Romig Road is now largely barren, owing to the closure of Rolling Acres Mall. East Avenue has mixed retail and residential use. Auto dealers and a mix of retail and office uses exist along Vernon Odom Boulevard. Although the Rolling Acres area is not thought of first as a residential area, proposals regarding the commitment of additional land to residential development are continually under consideration. The Mud Run Golf Course was in the center of the neighborhood. The largest residential areas are west of East Avenue. Rolling Acres had 1,120 housing units with 2,414 people living in the area. There was a lower percentage of children in this neighborhood than Akron has on the whole. The average household income (1999) was $41,467 which was just above the city average. University Park The University of Akron campus dominates the University Park neighborhood. Areas south and east of the University remain working class, with a significant mix of student rental housing. A neighborhood retail cluster on Exchange Street called Spicertown serves the area, as well as retail shops along East Market Street. University Park is accessible by both Interstate 76 to the south, and Ohio State Highway 8. With over 90% of the population under 45 years of age, the University Park area is primarily home to young adults. The dominant age group is persons from 20 ‚Äì 44 years of age. Over half of adults 25 and over have at least some college. Over 23% of University Park residents have attained either college or graduate degrees, higher than the city average. University Park has slightly higher percentages of Whites and ethnic groups other than African-Americans than Akron has as a whole. According to The City of Akron's statistics there are 9,012 people living in 3,537 households. University Park is 70% Caucasian. The average household income (1999) is $30,799, 75% of Akron as a whole. = Spicertown = Spicertown is in the area around Spicer and East Exchange Streets. Originally settled by Major Minor Spicer and his family in 1810‚Äì1811,Upton, Harriet Taylor (1910). History of The Western Reserve. Chicago; New York: The Lewis Publishing Company. Spicertown's population increased steadily over the following 25 years due to an influx of German immigrants. Due to the efforts of community leaders, Spicertown managed to escape being included within the Village of Akron during its incorporation in 1836. However once Akron became a city in 1865, Spicertown lost its political distinction. Today, the Spicertown area is an eclectic mix of small shops and college housing on the southern edge of The University of Akron. One of the area's most well known residents is Don Drumm whose art studio and gallery, which showcases the contemporary artwork of more than 500 N. American artisans, has become well known throughout the region.

Distribution They are found in most parts of the (sub-)tropical world where domestic pigeons are kept, and are obligate ectoparasites on all Rock Pigeons (also known as Feral Pigeons). Known from wild hosts in Continental Africa, Mediterranean Sub- region, Afghanistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Thailand, Taiwan, Ryukyu Islands, The Philippines, Malaya, and Indonesia, as well as North America and South America in warmer latitudes. Hosts The only wild hosts are Pigeons and Doves (Columbidae). In domestic settings they have been recorded from 33 genera, 13 families, 8 orders of birds. Disease vector P. canariensis is the definitive host (sexual reproduction takes place in the insect vector) for the protozoan Haemoproteus columbae or pigeon malaria and transmits this parasite to Columbiformes. This parasite can be fatal to young Rock Pigeons in extremely infected birds. However, more often, Haemoproteus columbae is quite benign and an experimental study found no difference in experimentally infected birds and those in the surrounding population when followed from nestlings through young adults and monitored for survival. The global distribution of Haemoproteus columbae described in Rock Pigeons may provide evidence for the wide range of Pseudolynchia canariensis. Ischnoceran lice are often found on several hippoboscid flies. This is a phoretic association, meaning the lice catch a ride on the flies to move between bird hosts, and the lice do not feed on the flies. Pigeon flies themselves are commonly infested with a mite Myialges anchora.

A second type is the capillary-tube type of thermal mass flow meter. Many mass flow controllers (MFC) which combine a mass flow meter, electronics and a valve are based on this design. Furthermore, a thermal mass flow meter can be built by measuring temperature differential across a silicon-based MEMS chip.https://www.axetris.com/en-ch/axetris-news/mems-based-thermal-mass-flow- technology/ Both types measure fluid mass flow rate by means of the heat convected from a heated surface to the flowing fluid. In the case of the thermal dispersion, or immersible, type of flow meter, the heat is transferred to the boundary layer of the fluid flowing over the heated surface. In the case of the capillary-tube type, the heat is transferred to the bulk of the fluid flowing through a small heated capillary tube. The principles of operation of the two types are both thermal in nature, but are so substantially different that two separate standards are required. Additionally, their applications are much different. Thermal dispersion flow meters are commonly used for general industrial gas flow applications in pipes and ducts, whereas capillary types are primarily used for smaller flows of clean gases or liquids in tubes. This type is most widely used for thermal mass flow meters in industry. Nevertheless, the capillary type is not the subject of this discussion. Thermal dispersion mass flow meter history The operation of thermal dispersion mass flow meters is attributed to L.V. King who, in 1914, published his famous King's Law revealing how a heated wire immersed in a fluid flow measures the mass velocity at a point in the flow. King called his instrument a \\"hot-wire anemometer\\". However, it was not until the 1960s and 1970s that industrial-grade thermal dispersion mass flow meters finally emerged. Industrial applications The primary reason thermal mass flow meters are popular in industrial applications is the way they are designed and built. They feature no moving parts, nearly unobstructed straight through flow path, require no temperature or pressure corrections and retain accuracy over a wide range of flow rates. Straight pipe runs can be reduced by using dual-plate flow conditioning elements and installation is very simple with minimal pipe intrusions. However, in many applications, the thermal properties of the fluid can be dependent upon fluid composition. In such applications, varying composition of the fluid during actual operation can affect the thermal flow measurement. Therefore, it is important for the thermal flow meter supplier to know the composition of the fluid so that the proper calibration factor can be used to determine the flow rate accurately. Suppliers can provide appropriate calibration information for other gas mixtures, however the accuracy of the thermal flow meter is dependent on the actual gas mixture being the same as the gas mixture used for calibration purposes. In other words, the accuracy of a thermal flow meter calibrated for a given gas mixture will be degraded if the actual flowing gas has a different composition.http://www.flowmeters.com/ufm/index.cfm?task=thermal&TechFlash;=thermal- flow2.swf  External links  *Interactive flow calculations and routines generating physical properties based on 800 fluids database.

History Taoiseach Enda Kenny signing a book of condolence for the victims of the T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami at the Japanese Embassy in Dublin on 22 March 2011. The oldest record of an Irish person visiting Japan dates back to July 1704, when an Irish sailor, Robert Jansen, was seized off the coast of Kyushu. Jansen and five companions had escaped from the Dutch East India Company in the Philippines and set sail in a small boat hoping to reach Canton (present day Guangzhou). Initially, Jansen and the others were suspected of being Portuguese missionaries and were held until November 1704 before they were finally released and allowed to join a Dutch ship bound for the city of Batavia (present day Jakarta) in the Dutch East Indies.History of Ireland- Japan Relations The first contact between Ireland and Japan took place in December 1872 when members of the Iwakura Mission (while visiting England) traveled to Dublin which became a symbolically significant moment in the development of relations between the two countries.Discovering Irish-Japanese relations Following the Meiji Restoration (1868), Irish men and women emigrated to Japan, making their mark in a variety of fields. Irish writer Lafcadio Hearn (a.k.a. Koizumi Yakumo) immigrated to Japan and wrote several books about Japan. During the Meiji period, hundreds of Irish nuns and priests have lived, work and taught in Japan since they first arrived during that period. Many Irish nuns and priests also chose to remain in Japan during World War II. In March 1957, Ireland and Japan officially established diplomatic relations. Japan was the first east-Asian country with which Ireland established diplomatic links. That same year, both nations accredited ambassadors to each other capitals. In 1964, Japan upgraded its diplomatic legation in Dublin to an embassy. In 1973, Ireland opened a resident embassy in Tokyo.Japan-Ireland Relations (Overview) In September 1983, Irish President Patrick Hillery became the first Irish head of state to visit Japan. In 1985, Japanese Crown Prince Akihito and Crown Princess Michiko paid a visit to Ireland. The Royal couple would later return to Ireland as Emperor and Empress of Japan in 2005.

For example, , and are homorganic consonants of each other as they share the place of articulation of bilabial. Consonants not articulated in the same place are called heterorganic. Articulatory position Descriptive phonetic classification relies on the relationships between a number of technical terms that describe the way sounds are made; and one of the relevant elements involves that place at which a specific sound is formed and voiced.Laver, John. (2003).\\"Linguistic Phonetics,\\" in The Handbook of Linguistics, pp. 164-178. In articulatory phonetics, the specific \\"place of articulation\\" or \\"point of articulation\\" of a consonant is that point of contact, where an obstruction occurs in the vocal tract between an active (moving) articulator (typically some part of the tongue) and a passive (stationary) articulator (typically some part of the roof of the mouth). Along with the manner of articulation and phonation, this gives the consonant its distinctive sound. =Similar articulatory position= Consonants that have a similar or the same place of articulation, such as the alveolar sounds (n, t, d, s, z, l) in English, are said to be homorganic. Homorganic nasal rule A homorganic nasal rule is a case in which the point of articulation of the initial sound is assimilated by the last sound in a prefix. An example of this rule is found in the Yoruba language, where ba, \\"meet\\", becomes mba, \\"is meeting\\", while sun, \\"sleep\\", becomes nsun, \\"is sleeping\\". Consonant clustering Two or more consonant sounds may appear sequentially linked or clustered as either identical consonants or homorganic consonants that differ slightly in the manner of articulation, as when the first consonant is a fricative and the second is a stop.Ravid, Dorit diskin et al. (2005). Perspectives on Language and Language Development, p. 55. In some languages, a syllable-initial homorganic sequence of a stop and a nasal is quite uncontroversially treated as a sequence of two separate segments; and the separate status of the stop and the nasal is quite clear. In Russian, the stop + nasal sequences are just one of the possible types amongst many different syllable-initial consonant sequences that occur.Ladefoged, Peter et al. (1996). The Sounds of the World's Languages, p. 128. In English, nasal + stop sequences within a morpheme must be homorganic.Ladefoged, p. 119. =Consonant length= In languages as diverse as Arabic, Tamil and Icelandic, there is a phonological contrast between long and short consonants,Ladefoged, p. 92. which are distinguishable from consonant clusters. In phonetics, gemination happens when a spoken consonant is pronounced for an audibly longer period of time than a short consonant. Consonant length is distinctive in some languages. In Japanese, for example, Êù•„Åü (kita) means 'came; arrived', while Âàá„Å£„Åü (kitta) means 'cut; sliced'. The romanization or transliteration of the sound of each Japanese word produces the misleading impression of a doubled consonant.

It is a concept which helps to answer the question whether two homotopy equivalent manifolds are diffeomorphic (or PL-homeomorphic or homeomorphic). There are different versions of the structure set depending on the category (DIFF, PL or TOP) and whether Whitehead torsion is taken into account or not.  Definition  Let X be a closed smooth (or PL- or topological) manifold of dimension n. We call two homotopy equivalences f_i: M_i to X from closed manifolds M_i of dimension n to X (i=0,1) equivalent if there exists a cobordism mathcal{}(W;M_0,M_1) together with a map (F;f_0,f_1): (W;M_0,M_1) to (X times [0,1];X times {0},X times {1}) such that F, f_0 and f_1 are homotopy equivalences. The structure set mathcal{S}^h (X) is the set of equivalence classes of homotopy equivalences f: M to X from closed manifolds of dimension n to X. This set has a preferred base point: id: X to X. There is also a version which takes Whitehead torsion into account. If we require in the definition above the homotopy equivalences F, f_0 and f_1 to be simple homotopy equivalences then we obtain the simple structure set mathcal{S}^s (X).  Remarks  Notice that (W;M_0,M_1) in the definition of mathcal{S}^h (X) resp. mathcal{S}^s (X) is an h-cobordism resp. an s-cobordism. Using the s-cobordism theorem we obtain another description for the simple structure set mathcal{S}^s (X), provided that n>4: The simple structure set mathcal{S}^s (X) is the set of equivalence classes of homotopy equivalences f: M to X from closed manifolds M of dimension n to X with respect to the following equivalence relation. Two homotopy equivalences f_i: M_i to X (i=0,1) are equivalent if there exists a diffeomorphism (or PL- homeomorphism or homeomorphism) g: M_0 to M_1 such that f_1 circ g is homotopic to f_0. As long as we are dealing with differential manifolds, there is in general no canonical group structure on mathcal{S}^s (X). If we deal with topological manifolds, it is possible to endow mathcal{S}^s (X) with a preferred structure of an abelian group (see chapter 18 in the book of Ranicki). Notice that a manifold M is diffeomorphic (or PL-homeomorphic or homeomorphic) to a closed manifold X if and only if there exists a simple homotopy equivalence phi: M to X whose equivalence class is the base point in mathcal{S}^s (X). Some care is necessary because it may be possible that a given simple homotopy equivalence phi: M to X is not homotopic to a diffeomorphism (or PL-homeomorphism or homeomorphism) although M and X are diffeomorphic (or PL-homeomorphic or homeomorphic). Therefore, it is also necessary to study the operation of the group of homotopy classes of simple self-equivalences of X on mathcal{S}^s (X). The basic tool to compute the simple structure set is the surgery exact sequence.  Examples  Topological Spheres: The generalized Poincar√© conjecture in the topological category says that mathcal{S}^s (S^n) only consists of the base point. This conjecture was proved by Smale (n > 4), Freedman (n = 4) and Perelman (n = 3). Exotic Spheres: The classification of exotic spheres by Kervaire and Milnor gives mathcal{S}^s (S^n) = theta_n = pi_n(PL/O) for n > 4 (smooth category).

It was at that time in his life that he was presented with a book of mantras for Lord Ganesha, given to him by a great Mahatma. Murugesu started to chant regularly. Creation of the Sri Lankatheeswara temple Gayathri Siddhar Swami Murugesu is the founder of Sri Lankatheeswarar temple in 1974 with his sole efforts, and had counted thousands of devotees all over the world and hundreds of admirers including leading figures within the country and abroad, among whom were Prime Ministers and others, visiting this temple and getting his blessings, who had tirelessly worked for peace and amity all over the world. The Sri Lankatheeswarar temple is the first and the foremost temple built for Gayathri Amman in Sri Lanka, and the Shiva Lingham installed in this temple was brought from the holy river Narmada by Sri Sivabalayogi Maharaj. This temple has showered with endless blessings of Siddhars especially Gayathri Siddhar Swami Murugesu. Swami MurugesuHe had an ashram next to the temple and lived next to the ashram. There was also a block of sandy steps leading up to a big hall, where Murugesu conducted yagnas and did rituals for Poya day. In the temple there was a big Shivalingam, that would have an abishekam every month. There is a black statue of Goddess Gayathri is there opposite to the temple. Guru Murugesu went to India and admitted to Sri Kannaiya Yogis Ashram and became his disciple. There he researched in to Gayatri Mantra and written many books based on his researches. Hence he is also known as Gayathri Siddha by his disciples. Disciples Many flocked to the ashram and became Murugesu's disciples. One of them was Swami Shankarananda Maharajji who runs the Gayathri Peedam in South Africa, which was consecrated personally by Swami Murugesu in 1998. Another disciple is Swami Radhakrishnan who runs a Meditation centre in Germany and the Gayathri Meditation is held there.

Both states are members of the European Union and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. History=Early relations= The first awareness and contact between both nations was through stories about Celtic migration from Iberia to Ireland as mentioned in the Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn regarding the Milesians.Ireland and Iberia: An Introduction The first diplomatic contact between Irish and Spanish nobility happened in April 1529 when the Spanish ambassador, Don Gonzalez Fernandez, visited Ireland and met with The 10th Earl of Desmond. The agreement, known as the Treaty of Dingle, gave a formal legal and constitutional foundation to the rights of citizenship and other privileges that Irish exiles and √©migr√©s enjoyed in Habsburg Spain, Habsburg Austria and Habsburg Netherlands from the 16th to the early 20th centuries.The Treaty of Dingle remembered Both nations felt united in their common beliefs of Catholicism, but this was not an issue in 1529. In 1554-58 Philip Prince of Asturias was married to Mary I and was named as titular King of Ireland in the Papal Bull '. As a result, during the first plantations of Ireland what is now County Offaly was shired as \\"King's County\\", and Philipstown (now Daingean) was named in his honour, the first Irish place named after someone from Spain. Soon after Mary's death he succeeded as Philip II of Spain. In 1601, Spain supported Irish rebels fighting against England during the Nine Years War, and especially during the Siege of Kinsale. At the time, the Catholics of Ireland saw Spain as a potential liberator of their country from Protestant England and in 1595 Hugh O'Neill offered the crown of Ireland to Philip II of Spain. Philip refused the offer, having already been the titular King of Ireland. Many Irishmen in rebellion against English rule subsequently sought refuge in Spain following the Flight of the Earls (1607), and for the next two centuries Irish soldiers contributed to Spanish Army of Flanders and fought side-by-side during the Dutch Revolts and during the Thirty Years' War.Micheline Walsh, \\"The Military Order of St Patrick\\" in Seanchas Ardmacha, Vol. 9, No. 2, (1979), p. 279 During the Anglo-Spanish War (1625‚Äì1630) proposals were made in 1627 to launch an invasion of Ireland under Shane O'Neill and Hugh O'Donnell, but did not go further than the planning stage. Irish soldiers in the service of Spain also participated in the colonization of the Americas.Ireland and Latin America Several prominent Spanish officials of Irish origin governed and administered Spanish colonies as Viceroy's such as Ambrosio O'Higgins in Peru and Juan O'Donoj√∫ in Mexico or became ministers in the Spanish government, most notably Leopoldo O'Donnell and his relatives Carlos O'Donnell and Juan O'Donnell. At the same time, during the independence wars of Gran Colombia, several thousand Irish soldiers fought for South America against Spain and made up parts of the British Legions. =Independence for the Republic of Ireland and the Spanish Civil War= Memorial to Limerick International Brigade In January 1801, Ireland became a part of the newly created United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and all relations between Ireland and Spain were henceforth carried out through the Court of St James's. Napoleon's Irish Legion took part in suppressing the Dos de Mayo Uprising. After the Napoleonic Wars the Regiment of Hibernia was disbanded at the demand of their British allies. In December 1922, most of Ireland gained a form of independence within the British Empire as the Irish Free State and, in 1924, diplomatic relations were officially established between the new Irish Free State and the Kingdom of Spain.Ireland and Spain 1931-1933. Divergent Republics That same year, Spain opened its first consulate in Dublin. In 1935, the first Irish Minister was appointed to Spain with residence in Madrid.Irish Embassy in Madrid: The Embassy‚Äôs History In 1936, Spain was engulfed in a Civil War between the Republican faction led by President Manuel Aza√±a; and the Nationalist faction led by General Francisco Franco. The Free State was a member of the Non-intervention Committee. However, Ireland (North and South) was divided in opinion over the war. Many Irish Catholics sided with Francisco Franco. A smaller number sided with the Spanish Republican faction.The Irish took sides in the Spanish Civil War 80 years ago this summer In 1936 the Irish Christian Front was established to financially support Francisco Franco and the Irish Brigade was created to fight for the Nationalist side and contributed 700 Irish volunteer soldiers to Franco. The Irish-American politician Joe Kennedy stopped the US Congress from supplying arms to the Republic. At the same time, 250 Irish socialist volunteers joined the International Brigades and fought for the Spanish Republican faction. Both Irish factions took part in the Battle of Jarama in February 1937. By the summer of 1937, the Irish Brigade was \\"disarmed and ordered out of Spain by Franco\\" (Fearghal McGarry); most of the socialists stayed until late 1938, although they were frequently treated as pariahs on their return home, and many emigrated to the UK. After the war ended in 1939, the Irish Minister presented his credentials in Burgos and formally recognized the new Spanish government under General Franco.Post Civil War Spain and International Relations =Post-war relations= In 1973, both Northern Ireland (as part of the United Kingdom) and the Republic of Ireland joined the European Economic Community (EEC), and Spain followed suit in 1986. In July 1986, King Juan Carlos I of Spain paid his first official visit to the Republic of Ireland.Primera visita de un Jefe de Estado espa√±ol a Irlanda (in Spanish) In 1993, Mary Robinson became the first Irish President to pay an official visit to Spain.Visita Oficial de Sus Excelencias la Presidenta de Irlanda, Sra.

Several Irish and Spanish airlines provide direct services between both nations. Bilateral agreements Both the Republic of Ireland and Spain have signed several bilateral agreements (mostly prior to both states joining the European Union), such as an Agreement on the Exchange of Diplomatic Pouches (1935); Agreement on the Exchange of Information regarding Meteorology (1950); Extradition Treaty (1957); Cultural Cooperation Agreement (1980); Spanish Agreement on Renouncing Historic Rights of Fishing in Irish Waters (1980) and an Agreement on the Avoidance of Double Taxation (1994).Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Ireland (in Spanish) Trade Embassy of Ireland in Madrid In 2015, trade between the Republic of Ireland and Spain totaled 4.5 billion Euros.

The tambores de candombe or tamboriles are drums used in the playing of Candombe music of Uruguay. They are single skin headed and there are three sizes: piano (bass range), repique (tenor range), and the chico (alto range). The drums are made of wood and have a curved barrel shape with its base very narrow.  Music and description  Candombe is performed by a group of drummers called a cuerda. The barrel-shaped drums, or tamboriles, have specific names according to their size and function: chico (small, high timbre, marks the tempo) repique (medium, syncopation and improvisation) piano (large, low timbre, melody). An even larger drum, called bajo or bombo (very large, very low timbre, accent on the fourth beat), was once common but is now declining in use. A cuerda at a minimum needs three drummers, one on each part. A full cuerda will have 50-100 drummers, commonly with rows of seven or five drummers, mixing the three types of drums. A typical row of five can be piano-chico- repique-chico-piano, with the row behind having repique-chico-piano-chico- repique and so on to the last row. Tamboriles are made of wood with animal skins that are rope-tuned or fire-tuned minutes before the performance. They are worn at the waist with the aid of a shoulder strap called a talig or tal√≠ and played with one stick and one hand. A key rhythmic figure in candombe is the clave (in 3-2 form). It is played on the side of the drum, a procedure known as \\"hacer madera\\" (literally, \\"making wood\\"). =Master Candombe drummers= Among the most important and traditional Montevidean rhythms are: Cuareim, Ansina y Cordon.

It was founded in 1989 and comes out with six issues per year, or once per month. It contains satirical articles (such as fake news briefs, interviews, and op-ed pieces), cartoons, and photos. It is known as \\"Tufts University's Only Intentionally Funny Magazine\\" and its motto is \\"Cowering Behind the First Amendment Since 1989.\\" The Zamboni is fully funded by the Student Activities Fee as allocated by the Tufts Senate. In 2014, The Zamboni started publishing digitally, and became part of more experimental humor ventures. As of 2014, The Zamboni creates pieces of installation art, multimedia, sketch comedy, and pranks, among other non-print projects.  History  The Zamboni was founded by Josh Wolk (Class of '91) in the fall of 1989 with the help of a Tufts Daily layout artist, Nicole Pierce. Wolk described his reason for creating the magazine as: > \\"It was basically a reaction to what we felt was a lack of sense of humor on > campus (this was in the dawning days of political correctness). It was also > a slightly embittered reaction to the fact that the guys at the Harvard > Lampoon were sitting in a castle just two cities away and getting every TV > writing job as soon as they graduated. Crimson bastards.\\" The name itself came from Wolk, who always expressed amusement of the concept of an actual Zamboni. \\"It just seemed silly to be a guy driving a machine around the ice.\\" He created the letter from the editor sign-off of \\"Ain't that a kick in the head?\\" which still continues to this day. The original staff was mostly seniors, and the first issues poked fun at the TCU Senate and on-campus fraternities. One such example included a full page parody of a Delta Tau Delta rush ad. DTD responded with an ad in the Daily that referred to The Zamboni as \\"Dorkman Zamboni,\\" a shout-out that the original staff proudly embraced. After a \\"dry period\\" between the mid 90s and early 2000s, The Zamboni went through a revitalization in content and structure in 2013, led by then-Managing Editor Graham Starr. Adopting a \\"print is dead, long live print!\\" attitude, the Zamboni pushed more toward the conceptual art community at Tufts, and has been focusing more on experimental comedy and multimedia and digital content. The Zamboni has kept its initial print nature and still publishes monthly, but is also using its newfound freedom of \\"not having to care\\" as good excuse into other, less-traveled avenues of humor. The Zamboni has also positioned itself into an artist and comedian sandbox on campus for humorists, designers, writers, and artists to try out new content and develop in a safe and supportive space.  Organization structure  The Zamboni is a student group funded by the TCU Senate. It has three main positions that operate and oversee the organization and development of the club and magazine: The Editor in Chief, the Managing Editor, and the Editor-at-Large. Up to two people are allowed to serve as co-Editor in Chief or co-Managing Editor at one time, and oversee most of the general organization of the magazine and organization. There is no limit on the number of members that may serve as Editors-at-Large at the same time. In Spring 2015, the Zamboni rewrote its constitution to prepare for the next generation of humor content. The new board includes six positions: The Editor-in-Chief, Managing Editor, Creative Director, Digital Manager, Publicity Director, and Editor-at-Large. This restructuring focuses the Zamboni more on digital and multimedia content. Elections for positions are typically held at the end of the academic year in April or May.  Format  Originally, The Zamboni was developed as being fourteen pages every issue in addition to a front and back cover. The average issue contains a word from the editor, two to three pages of fake news briefs, followed by two pages of campus news, a center spread dealing with the theme of the issue, and then more pages of miscellaneous content, also often concerning the issue's theme (which is on the cover). Recurring features include The Zamboni Interviews and The Zamboni Roasts. The fourth or fifth issue every year is a parody issue, which mimics the style of another publication, on or off-campus. Currently, The Zamboni is either twenty or twenty-four pages long (including front and back cover, and is divided by section. Sections are established by the amount of content amassed per issue, and the issue theme is used to tie the creative development of the magazine together. There are no required sections and they all may change at whim. It is entirely possible that one issue during the year is printed backwards while all the others are printed forwards. Or that only one is printed forwards and the others printed backwards. The palindromic nature of chaos is a large and necessary part of the new Zamboni. Historically, The Zamboni has endured a variety of changes in layout format and editorial direction. It was published in a 12‚Äì16 page broadsheet tabloid format on conventional newsprint throughout the 1990s. The success of the 1999 \\"student notebook parody\\" (itself a homage to The National Lampoon's High School Yearbook) led to a change in format. In fall 2000, with the publication moved to a conventional multicolor staplebound magazine-style layout centered around a singular theme, similar to the National Lampoon magazines of the 1970s. In the fall of 2013, the editors returned the format to a more conventional magazine style, with standardized magazine layout. This was a change from the previous newspaper tabloid style of the magazine, and focuses more on artistic direction, photo manipulation, and article-based content. The new layout consists of 20‚Äì24 page issues, including a front and back cover, where the outside spread is off glossy and brightly colored format, while the inside sheets are of a black-and-white magazine print, inspired by Bitch Magazine, which the editors enjoyed reading. In the fall of 2014, 'The Zamboni' launched its website and non-print content. As of spring 2015, 'The Zamboni' publishes certain content in exclusively digital format in addition to its print publication. In 2014 'The Zamboni' also became involved in mixed media and installation art pieces as auxiliaries to publication ventures.  Current developments  In spring of 2006, The Zamboni ran a parody of the Weekly World News. This parody entailed a change in style from the then-used magazine format (book with staples) to a larger folded-tabloid format. This change proved so popular that, beginning in 2006‚Äì2007, that format became the regular one of The Zamboni. This allowed more space per issue, leading to an increase in photos and articles. News briefs particularly expanded, going from one page with no pictures, to three pages, often with a picture per article. As of the fall of 2009, The Zamboni has its front and back covers in addition to the sixth and seventh pages in color. In the fall of 2013, the editors redesigned the layout to a more recognizable, stylistic, and appealing format, reverting to a magazine style from the previous \\"tabloid\\" layout. Only the outside spread is in color, while the inside pages are in standard magazine grayscale. The new format includes several fake advertisements and a page for coupons to be used at on-campus establishments. These coupons are intentionally humorous in nature and no actual establishment was consulted in advance for the creation of these coupons. They are a ruse, a prank, and not to be taken seriously, or used seriously. In the fall of 2013, The Zamboni also established an online presence, social media presence, and expanded its scope of operation to include different kinds of humorous ventures. such as pranks or video humor. In the fall of 2014, The Zamboni established ventures in installation art and mixed media, creating fake statues and art exhibits on campus. In April 2015, amid the arrival of the new Jumbo statue, 'The Zamboni' staff made a cardboard replica and placed it on campus where the official statue would have gone. In spring 2015, The Zamboni launched its website and started publishing digital- only content in addition to its other projects.  Controversy  As Tufts's humor magazine, The Zamboni has sometimes sparked controversy with its articles. During one 2005 issue, an article was run that gave a list of how- tos to get kicked out of clubs on campus. One joke said that to get kicked out of SSARA (a sexual assault counseling group) one should say, \\"With an outfit like that, you should have expected it,\\" to which some students took offense. The Zamboni responded to the controversy in the following week's Tufts Daily opinion section.The Zamboni 10-7-2005, on Issuu.The Zamboni: Comic Relief Not Social Commentary in the Tufts Daily  Editors-in-chief  The names of many The Zamboni's editors-in-chief appeared in the publication's 100th issue.

In AD 1453, the city of Constantinople, the capital and last stronghold of the Byzantine Empire, fell to the Ottoman Empire. By this time Egypt had been under Muslim control for some seven centuries. Jerusalem had been conquered by the Umayyad Muslims in 638, won back by Rome in 1099 under the First Crusade and then reconquered by Saladin's forces during the Siege of Jerusalem in 1187. Later in the sevenths Crusade, it was taken back by the Catholics once again. It was conquered by the Ottomans in 1517. Orthodoxy, however, was very strong in Russia which had recently acquired an autocephalous status; and thus Moscow called itself the Third Rome, as the cultural heir of Constantinople. Under Ottoman rule, the Greek Orthodox Church acquired power as an autonomous millet. The ecumenical patriarch was the religious and administrative ruler of the entire \\"Greek Orthodox nation\\" (Ottoman administrative unit), which encompassed all the Eastern Orthodox subjects of the Empire. Isolation from the West As a result of the Ottoman conquest of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, and the Fall of Constantinople, the entire Orthodox communion of the Balkans and the Near East became suddenly isolated from the West. The Russian Orthodox Church was the only part of the Orthodox communion which remained outside the control of the Ottoman Empire. It is, in part, due to this geographical and intellectual confinement that the voice of Eastern Orthodoxy was not heard during the Reformation in sixteenth century Europe. As a result, this important theological debate often seems strange and distorted to the Orthodox; after all, they never took part in it and thus neither Reformation nor Counter- Reformation is part of their theological framework. The Orthodox Church under the Ottoman Empire Sultan Mehmed II and the Patriarch Gennadios II. Mehmed II allowed the Ecumenical Patriarchate to remain active after the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Islam not only recognized Jesus as a great prophet, but tolerated Christians to a limited degree. Because Islamic law makes no distinction between nationality and religion, all Christians, regardless of their language or nationality, were considered a single Rum Millet (millet-i R√ªm), i.e. Roman millet, or nation. In contrast to Catholicism which was associated with enemy Austria, the Orthodox Church was an accepted institution under the Ottomans, but the number of churches and monasteries was greatly reduced so as to make room for the new mosques being built, and the majority of churches became mosques during Ottoman rule.page 23 of Bosnia and Herzegovina By Tim Clancypage 630 of Eastern Europe: an introduction to the people, lands, and culture ..., Volume 1 By Richard C. Frucht Only some churches were given maintenance and, even more rare, were new ones built. The majority of the city's inhabitants were converted to Islam from their original Eastern Orthodox Christian faith, and the Patriarch had less influence over the court and secular affairs. Though his power did increase over other Orthodox ethnic groups, though. Map of prevailing religions in the territories of the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century. As such, the Orthodox Church was not extinguished nor was its canonical and hierarchical organization completely destroyed. Its administration continued to function though in lesser degree, no longer being the state religion. One of the first things that Mehmet the Conqueror did was to allow the Church to elect a new patriarch, Gennadius Scholarius. The Hagia Sophia and the Parthenon, which had been Christian churches for nearly a millennium were converted into mosques, yet some other churches, both in Constantinople and elsewhere, remained in Christian hands. Many of these became mosques by the time the 16th century was coming to a close, like the Chora Church, for example. Many churches were also destroyed. They were endowed with civil as well as ecclesiastical power over all Christians in Ottoman territories. The patriarch, as the highest ranking hierarch, was thus invested with civil and religious authority and made ethnarch, head of the entire Christian Orthodox population. Practically, this meant that all Orthodox Churches within Ottoman territory were under the control of Constantinople. Thus, the authority and jurisdictional frontiers of the patriarch were enormously enlarged. =Establishment and development= After the Ottoman conquest of the Constantinople in 1453, all Orthodox Christians, were treated as lower class of people. The Rum millet was instituted by Sultan Mehmet II who set himself to reorganise the state as the conscious heir of the East Roman Empire. The Orthodox congregation was included in a specific ethno-religious community under Greco-Byzantine domination. Its name was derived from the Byzantine (Roman) subjects of the Ottoman Empire, but all Orthodox Greeks, Bulgarians, Albanians, Vlachs and Serbs, as well as Georgians and Arabs were considered part of the same millet in spite of their differences in ethnicity and language. Belonging to this Orthodox commonwealth became more important to the common people than their ethnic origins.Europe and the Historical Legacies in the Balkans, Raymond Detrez, Barbara Segaert, Peter Lang, 2008, , p. 36. This community became basic form of social organization and source of identity for all the ethnic groups inside it and most people began to identify themselves simply as Christians.Studies on Ottoman Social and Political History: Selected Articles and Essays, Kemal H. Karpat, BRILL, 2002, , p. 17. However, under Ottoman rule ethnonyms never disappeared, which indicates that some form of ethnic identification was preserved. This is evident from a Sultan's Firman from 1680 which lists the ethnic groups in the Balkan lands of the Empire as follows: Greeks (Rum), Albanians (Arnaut), Serbs (Sirf), Vlachs (Eflak) and the Bulgarians (Bulgar).–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –Ω–∞ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏—Ç–µ. –ö—ä—Å–Ω–æ —Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–æ–≤–µ–∫–æ–≤–∏–µ –∏ –í—ä–∑—Ä–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω–µ, —Ç–æ–º 2, –ì–µ–æ—Ä–≥–∏ –ë–∞–∫–∞–ª–æ–≤, TRUD Publishers, 2004, , —Å—Ç—Ä. 23.

Christians were guaranteed some limited freedoms, but they were not considered equals to Muslims, and their religious practices would have to defer to those of Muslims, in addition to various other legal limitations.

Many individual Christians were made martyrs for stating their faith or speaking negatively against Islam.Paroulakis, Peter H. The Greek War of Independence Hellenic International Press 1984 Altruistic Suicide or Altruistic Martyrdom? Christian Greek orthodox Neomartyrs: A Case Study The Ecumenical Patriarch was recognized as the highest religious and political leader, ethnarch of all Orthodox subjects. The Serbian Patriarchate of Peƒá with its seat in Patriarchal Monastery of Peƒá and the Archbishopric of Ohrid which were autonomous Orthodox Churches under the tutelage of the Ecumenical Patriarch were taken over by the Greek Phanariotes during the 18th century. The Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji from 1774, allowed Russia to intervene on the side of Ottoman Eastern Orthodox subjects, and most of the Porte's political tools of pressure became ineffective. At that time the Rum millet had a great deal of power ‚Äî it set its own laws and collected and distributed its own taxes. The rise of nationalism in Europe under the influence of the French revolution had extended to the Ottoman Empire and the Rum millet became increasingly independent with the establishment of its own schools, churches, hospitals and other facilities. These activities effectively moved the Christian population outside the framework of the Ottoman political system. =Rise of nationalism and decline= The Chios Massacre refers to the slaughter of tens of thousands of Greeks on the island of Chios by Ottoman troops in 1822. In the early 19th century the Greek Orthodox intellectuals tried to reconceptualize the Rum Millet. They argued for a new, ethnic ‚ÄúRomaic‚Äù national identity and new Byzantine state, but their visions of a future state included all Balkan Orthodox Christians. This Megali Idea implied the goal of reviving the Eastern Roman Empire by establishing a new Greek state. It spread among the urban population of Vlach, Slavic and Albanian origin and it started to view itself increasingly as Greek. On the other hand, the Ottoman Tanzimat reforms in the middle of 19th century were aimed to encourage the Ottomanism among the secessionist subject nations and stop the nationalist movements within the Empire, but failed to succeed. With the rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire the Rum millet began to degrade with the continuous identification of the religious creed with ethnic nationality. The national awakening of each ethnic group inside it was complex and most of the groups interacted with each other. The Bulgarian Exarchate recognized by the Ottomans in 1870 was only a link in a series of events following the unilateral declaration of an autocephalous Orthodox Church of Greece in 1833 and of Romania in 1865. The 1877‚Äì1878 Russo-Turkish War dealt a decisive blow to Ottoman power in the Balkan Peninsula. The Serbian Orthodox Church also became autocephalous in 1879. The Albanians' fear that the lands they inhabited would be partitioned among neighbouring Montenegro, Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece fueled the rise of Albanian nationalism and the League of Prizren was founded. The recognition of Vlachs as a distinct millet in the Ottoman Empire in 1905, was the final straw in this Balkan nationalistic competition. As result, intense ethnic and national rivalries among the Balkan peoples emerged at the eve of the 20th century in Macedonia. That was followed by series of conflicts among Greeks (Grecomans), Serbs (Serbomans), Bulgarians (Bulgarophiles) and Vlachs (Rumanophiles) into the region. The Young Turk Revolution of 1908 restored the Parliament, which had been suspended by the Sultan in 1878. However, the process of supplanting the monarchic institutions was unsuccessful and the European periphery of the Empire continued to splinter under the pressures of local revolts. Subsequently, with the Balkan Wars, the Ottoman Empire lost virtually all of its possessions in the Balkans, which put de facto to end the community of the Rum millet. Corruption The Orthodox Church found itself subject to the Ottoman system of corruption. The patriarchal throne was frequently sold to the highest bidder, while new patriarchal investiture was accompanied by heavy payment to the government. In order to recoup their losses, patriarchs and bishops taxed the local parishes and their clergy. Nor was the patriarchal throne ever secure. Few patriarchs between the fifteenth and the nineteenth centuries died a natural death while in office. The forced abdications, exiles, hangings, drownings, and poisonings of patriarchs are well documented. But if the patriarch's position was precarious so was the hierarchy's. The hanging of patriarch Gregory V from the gate of the patriarchate on Easter Sunday 1821 was accompanied by the execution of two metropolitans and twelve bishops. Devshirmeh Registration of Christian boys for the dev≈üirme. Ottoman miniature painting from the S√ºleymanname, 1558. Devshirmeh was the system of the collection of young men from conquered Christian lands by the Ottoman sultans as a form of regular taxation in order to build a loyal slave army, formerly largely composed of war captives, and the class of (military) administrators called the \\"Janissaries\\", or other servants such as tellak in hamams. The word dev≈üirme means \\"collecting, gathering\\" in Ottoman. Boys delivered to the Ottomans in this way were called ghilm√°n or acemi oglanlar (\\"novice boys\\"). Fall of the Ottoman Empire in the East The fall of the Ottoman was precipitated by the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox disputed possession of the Church of the Nativity and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. During the early 1850s, the two sides made demands which the Sultan could not possibly satisfy simultaneously. In 1853, the Sultan adjudicated in favour of the French, despite the vehement protestations of the local Orthodox monks. The ruling Ottoman siding with Rome over the Orthodox provoked out right war (see the Eastern Question). As the Ottoman Empire had been for sometime falling into political, social and economic decay (see the Sick Man of Europe) this conflict ignited the Crimean War in 1850 between Russia and the Ottoman Empire. Persecution by the Young Turks Armenian civilians are marched to a nearby prison in Mezireh by armed Turkish soldiers, April 1915 During 1894-1923 the Ottoman Empire conducted a policy of genocide against the Christian population living within its extensive territory. The Sultan, Abdul Hamid, issued an official governmental policy of genocide against the Armenians of the Ottoman Empire in 1894. Systematic massacres took place in 1894-1896 when Abdul savagely killed 300,000 Armenians throughout the provinces. In 1909 government troops killed, in the towns of Adana alone, over 20,000 Christian Armenians. When World War I broke out, the Ottoman Empire was ruled by the \\"Young Turks\\" that allied the empire with Germany. In the 20th century, the number of Orthodox Christians, and of Christians in general, in the Anatolian peninsula sharply declined amidst complaints of Ottoman governmental repression of various Eastern and Oriental Orthodox groups.Massacres, Resistance, Protectors: Muslim-Christian Relations in Eastern Anatolia during World War I, by David Gaunt, 2006The Forgotten Genocide: Eastern Christians, the Last Arameans, p.195, by S√©bastien de Courtois In the first two decades of the 20th century, there were massacres of Greeks, Slavs, and Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, culminating in the Armenian, Greek and Assyrian genocides.

The surgery structure set mathcal{S} (X) of a compact n-dimensional manifold X is a pointed set which classifies n-dimensional manifolds within the homotopy type of X. The basic idea is that in order to calculate mathcal{S} (X) it is enough to understand the other terms in the sequence, which are usually easier to determine. These are on one hand the normal invariants which form generalized cohomology groups, and hence one can use standard tools of algebraic topology to calculate them at least in principle. On the other hand, there are the L-groups which are defined algebraically in terms of quadratic forms or in terms of chain complexes with quadratic structure. A great deal is known about these groups. Another part of the sequence are the surgery obstruction maps from normal invariants to the L-groups. For these maps there are certain characteristic classes formulas, which enable to calculate them in some cases. Knowledge of these three components, that means: the normal maps, the L-groups and the surgery obstruction maps is enough to determine the structure set (at least up to extension problems). In practice one has to proceed case by case, for each manifold mathcal{} X it is a unique task to determine the surgery exact sequence, see some examples below. Also note that there are versions of the surgery exact sequence depending on the category of manifolds we work with: smooth (DIFF), PL, or topological manifolds and whether we take Whitehead torsion into account or not (decorations s or h). The original 1962 work of Browder and Novikov on the existence and uniqueness of manifolds within a simply-connected homotopy type was reformulated by Sullivan in 1966 as a surgery exact sequence. In 1970 Wall developed non-simply-connected surgery theory and the surgery exact sequence for manifolds with arbitrary fundamental group. Definition The surgery exact sequence is defined as : cdots to mathcal{N}_partial (X times I) to L_{n+1} (pi_1 (X)) to mathcal{S}(X) to mathcal{N} (X) to L_n (pi_1 (X)) where: the entries mathcal{N}_partial (X times I) and mathcal{N} (X) are the abelian groups of normal invariants, the entries mathcal{} L_{n+1} (pi_1 (X)) and mathcal{} L_{n} (pi_1 (X)) are the L-groups associated to the group ring mathbb{Z}[pi_1 (X)], the maps theta colon mathcal{N}_partial (X times I) to L_{n+1} (pi_1 (X)) and theta colon mathcal{N} (X) to L_n (pi_1 (X)) are the surgery obstruction maps, the arrows partial colon L_{n+1} (pi_1 (X)) to mathcal{S}(X) and eta colon mathcal{S}(X) to mathcal{N} (X) will be explained below. Versions There are various versions of the surgery exact sequence. One can work in either of the three categories of manifolds: differentiable (smooth), PL, topological. Another possibility is to work with the decorations s or h. The entries=Normal invariants= A degree one normal map (f,b) colon M to X consists of the following data: an n-dimensional oriented closed manifold M, a map f which is of degree one (that means f_* ([M]) = [X]), and a bundle map b colon TM oplus varepsilon^k to xi from the stable tangent bundle of M to some bundle xi over X. Two such maps are equivalent if there exists a normal bordism between them (that means a bordism of the sources covered by suitable bundle data). The equivalence classes of degree one normal maps are called normal invariants. When defined like this the normal invariants mathcal{N} (X) are just a pointed set, with the base point given by (id,id). However the Pontrjagin-Thom construction gives mathcal{N} (X) a structure of an abelian group. In fact we have a non- natural bijection : mathcal{N} (X) cong [X,G/O] where G/O denotes the homotopy fiber of the map J colon BO to BG, which is an infinite loop space and hence maps into it define a generalized cohomology theory. There are corresponding identifications of the normal invariants with [X,G/PL] when working with PL-manifolds and with [X,G/TOP] when working with topological manifolds. =L-groups= The L-groups are defined algebraically in terms of quadratic forms or in terms of chain complexes with quadratic structure. See the main article for more details. Here only the properties of the L-groups described below will be important. =Surgery obstruction maps= The map theta colon mathcal{N} (X) to L_n (pi_1 (X)) is in the first instance a set-theoretic map (that means not necessarily a homomorphism) with the following property (when n geq 5: A degree one normal map (f,b) colon M to X is normally cobordant to a homotopy equivalence if and only if the image theta (f,b)=0 in L_n (mathbb{Z} [pi_1 (X)]). =The normal invariants arrow eta colon mathcal{S}(X) to mathcal{N} (X)= Any homotopy equivalence f colon M to X defines a degree one normal map. =The surgery obstruction arrow partial colon L_{n+1} (pi_1 (X)) to mathcal{S}(X)= This arrow describes in fact an action of the group L_{n+1} (pi_1 (X)) on the set mathcal{S}(X) rather than just a map. The definition is based on the realization theorem for the elements of the L-groups which reads as follows: Let M be an n-dimensional manifold with pi_1 (M) cong pi_1 (X) and let x in L_{n+1} (pi_1 (X)). Then there exists a degree one normal map of manifolds with boundary : (F,B) colon (W,M,M') to (M times I, M times 0, M times 1) with the following properties: 1. theta (F,B) = x in L_{n+1} (pi_1 (X)) 2. F_0 colon M to M times 0 is a diffeomorphism 3. F_1 colon M' to M times 1 is a homotopy equivalence of closed manifolds Let f colon M to X represent an element in mathcal{S} (X) and let x in L_{n+1} (pi_1 (X)). Then partial (f,x) is defined as f circ F_1 colon M' to X. The exactness Recall that the surgery structure set is only a pointed set and that the surgery obstruction map theta might not be a homomorphism. Hence it is necessary to explain what is meant when talking about the \\"exact sequence\\". So the surgery exact sequence is an exact sequence in the following sense: For a normal invariant z in mathcal{N} (X) we have z in mathrm{Im} (eta) if and only if theta (z) = 0. For two manifold structures x_1, x_2 in mathcal{S} (X) we have eta (x_1) = eta(x_2) if and only if there exists u in L_{n+1} (pi_1 (X)) such that partial (u,x_1) = x_2. For an element u in L_{n+1} (pi_1 (X)) we have partial (u,mathrm{id}) = mathrm{id} if and only if u in mathrm{Im} (theta). Versions revisited In the topological category the surgery obstruction map can be made into a homomorphism. This is achieved by putting an alternative abelian group structure on the normal invariants as described here. Moreover, the surgery exact sequence can be identified with the algebraic surgery exact sequence of Ranicki which is an exact sequence of abelian groups by definition. This gives the structure set mathcal{S} (X) the structure of an abelian group. Note, however, that there is to this date no satisfactory geometric description of this abelian group structure. Classification of manifolds The answer to the organizing questions of the surgery theory can be formulated in terms of the surgery exact sequence. In both cases the answer is given in the form of a two-stage obstruction theory. The existence question. Let X be a finite Poincar√© complex. It is homotopy equivalent to a manifold if and only if the following two conditions are satisfied. Firstly, X must have a vector bundle reduction of its Spivak normal fibration. This condition can be also formulated as saying that the set of normal invariants mathcal{N} (X) is non-empty. Secondly, there must be a normal invariant x in mathcal{N} (X) such that theta (x) = 0. Equivalently, the surgery obstruction map theta colon mathcal{N} (X) rightarrow L_{n} (pi_1 (X)) hits 0 in L_{n} (pi_1 (X)). The uniqueness question. Let f colon M to X and f' colon M' to X represent two elements in the surgery structure set mathcal{S} (X). The question whether they represent the same element can be answered in two stages as follows. First there must be a normal cobordism between the degree one normal maps induced by mathcal{} f and mathcal{} f', this means mathcal{} eta (f) = eta (f') in mathcal{N} (X). Denote the normal cobordism (F,B) colon (W,M,M') to (X times I, X times 0, X times 1). If the surgery obstruction mathcal{} theta (F,B) in mathcal{} L_{n+1} (pi_1 (X)) to make this normal cobordism to an h-cobordism (or s-cobordism) relative to the boundary vanishes then mathcal{} f and mathcal{} f' in fact represent the same element in the surgery structure set. Quinn's surgery fibration In his thesis written under the guidance of Browder, Frank Quinn introduced a fiber sequence so that the surgery long exact sequence is the induced sequence on homotopy groups. Examples=1. Homotopy spheres= This is an example in the smooth category, n geq 5. The idea of the surgery exact sequence is implicitly present already in the original article of Kervaire and Milnor on the groups of homotopy spheres. In the present terminology we have : mathcal{S}^{DIFF} (S^n) = Theta^n mathcal{N}^{DIFF} (S^n) = Omega^{alm}_n the cobordism group of almost framed n manifolds, mathcal{N}^{DIFF}_partial (S^n times I) = Omega^{alm}_{n+1} L_n (1) =mathbb{Z}, 0, mathbb{Z}_2, 0 where n equiv 0,1,2,3 mod 4 (recall the 4-periodicity of the L-groups) The surgery exact sequence in this case is an exact sequence of abelian groups. In addition to the above identifications we have bP^{n+1} = mathrm{ker} (eta colon mathcal{S}^{DIFF} (S^n) to mathcal{N}^{DIFF} (S^n)) = mathrm{coker} (theta colon mathcal{N}^{DIFF}_partial (S^n times I) to L_{n+1} (1)) Because the odd-dimensional L-groups are trivial one obtains these exact sequences: : 0 to Theta^{4i} to Omega^{alm}_{4i} to mathbb{Z} to bP^{4i} to 0 : 0 to Theta^{4i-2} to Omega^{alm}_{4i-2} to mathbb{Z}/2 to bP^{4i-2} to 0 : 0 to bP^{2j} to Theta^{2j-1} to Omega^{alm}_{2j-1} to 0 The results of Kervaire and Milnor are obtained by studying the middle map in the first two sequences and by relating the groups Omega_i^{alm} to stable homotopy theory. =2. Topological spheres= The generalized Poincar√© conjecture in dimension n can be phrased as saying that mathcal{S}^{TOP} (S^n) = 0. It has been proved for any n by the work of Smale, Freedman and Perelman. From the surgery exact sequence for S^n for n geq 5 in the topological category we see that : theta colon mathcal{N}^{TOP} (S^n) to L_n (1) is an isomorphism. (In fact this can be extended to n geq 1 by some ad-hoc methods.) =3. Complex projective spaces in the topological category= The complex projective space mathbb{C} P^n is a (2n)-dimensional topological manifold with pi_1 (mathbb{C} P^n)=1. In addition it is known that in the case pi_1 (X) =1 in the topological category the surgery obstruction map theta is always surjective. Hence we have : 0 to mathcal{S}^{TOP} (mathbb{C} P^n) to mathcal{N}^{TOP} (mathbb{C} P^n) to L_{2n}(1) to 0 From the work of Sullivan one can calculate : mathcal{N} (mathbb{C} P^n) cong oplus_{i=1}^{lfloor n/2 rfloor} mathbb{Z} oplus oplus_{i=1}^{lfloor (n+1)/2 rfloor} mathbb{Z}_2 and hence mathcal{S} (mathbb{C} P^n) cong oplus_{i=1}^{lfloor (n-1)/2 rfloor} mathbb{Z} oplus oplus_{i=1}^{lfloor n/2 rfloor} mathbb{Z}_2 =4. Aspherical manifolds in the topological category= An aspherical n-dimensional manifold X is an n-manifold such that pi_i (X) = 0 for i geq 2. Hence the only non- trivial homotopy group is pi_1 (X) One way to state the Borel conjecture is to say that for such X we have that the Whitehead group Wh (pi_1 (X)) is trivial and that : mathcal{S} (X) = 0 This conjecture was proven in many special cases - for example when pi_1 (X) is mathbb{Z}^n, when it is the fundamental group of a negatively curved manifold or when it is a word- hyperbolic group or a CAT(0)-group. The statement is equivalent to showing that the surgery obstruction map to the right of the surgery structure set is injective and the surgery obstruction map to the left of the surgery structure set is surjective. Most of the proofs of the above-mentioned results are done by studying these maps or by studying the assembly maps with which they can be identified. See more details in Borel conjecture, Farrell-Jones Conjecture.

The Legion was well received in Colombia, especially by the poor, brought many people back to the Catholic faith, and later expanded to other parts of South America. The Colombia Three In 2001, Colombian police, acting on information from the British authorities, arrested three Irishmen in Bogota, alleging that they were members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and had been training members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a revolutionary guerilla movement in Colombia. In 2005 the Colombia Three, as they had become known in Ireland, were able to flee to Ireland while waiting appeal. There is no extradition treaty between Ireland and Colombia. Ireland has taken no action to extradite the men back to Colombia.This is hardly surprising since Colombia has not requested their extradition.

Crampton, Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century, page 372  Background  After World War II, Poland became a communist country, a satellite of the Soviet Union. Since collective farming is a key component of communist notion of agriculture, in June 1948, the Polish United Workers' Party decided to begin the process. From the very beginning, compulsory collectivization faced strong resistance of Polish farmers, who did not want to give up their land. Despite using different methods of persuasion, the progress was slow.Agrarian Policies in Communist Europe, page 63 By 1951, only 1% of arable land was collectivized, with some 23 000 farmers working there. Altogether, in that year there were some 2200 collective farms. Most of them were located in western and northern Poland, in the Recovered Territories, where population consisted of people resettled from former eastern borderlands of Poland. After the Polish October, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka officially declared that private farms were part of the so-called \\"Polish road to Socialism\\" and the government gradually changed its stance. In the late 1950s, number of collective farms fell to 1 800, and Poland was the only country of the Soviet Bloc which tolerated private ownership of the arable land. In 1958, Moscow ordered the resumption of collectivization, but unlike her neighbors, Poland refused.Ivan T. Berend, An Economic History of Twentieth-Century Europe, page 156 By 1960, collectivization in Poland was ended, never to be resumed,The history of Poland, page 139 and Engels' opinion that peasants would spontaneously create collective forms of agricultural production because of the threat of the big landed estates was not confirmed in Poland.Sociologia Ruralis, volume 22, Issue 3-4 Preservation of individual agriculture was a key factor in future events. Nevertheless, forced collectivization of farmland had disastrous consequences, as Poland, traditionally a grain exporter, had to import food, including grain, to prevent famine.History of Poland, People's Republic, 1948-1969  Origins of the Rural Solidarity  In August 1980, workers of the Vladimir Lenin Gda≈Ñsk Shipyard began a strike, which resulted in creation of Solidarity (see: History of Solidarity). After this event, a group of farmers, gathered in the Farmers Self-Defence Committees decided to set up their own, parallel union called Rural Solidarity.US Intelligence and the Confrontation in Poland, page 92 At that time, other similar farmers organizations emerged, such as Peasants Solidarity and Union of Agricultural Producers Solidarity. Their objectives were: * recognition of private farming as a lasting part of the national economy, * legal protection of inheritance of land. On September 24, 1980, representatives of Polish individual farmers submitted documents to the Warsaw Provincial Court for registration as Rural Solidarity. However, after one month, at the end of October, the court ruled that private farmers were self-employed and as such, were not entitled to organize their own labor union. The disappointed farmers turned to the Supreme Court. On November 30, Deputy Minister of Agriculture Andrzej Kacala met with a group of 30 representatives of farmers' unions founding committees from the Warsaw, Lublin, Siedlce, Skierniewice, and Wa≈Çbrzych Voivodeships, as well as from the Wrze≈õnia-Konin, Golub-Dobrzy≈Ñ-Kujawy, and the Holy Cross Mountains regions. The representatives informally called themselves Rural Solidarity.Poland: A Chronology of Events November 1980 - February 1981 Supported by Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa and the factory workers, the farmers organized on December 14, 1980, the founding congress of Rural Solidarity in Warsaw. It was attended by 1000 delegates, who represented around 600 000 private farmers. Among their demands, there was a call for formal registration of their independent union. However, on December 30, 1980, the Supreme Court announced that its ruling on Rural Solidarity had been postponed.The Rise and Fall of the Brezhnev Doctrine, page 172 As a result, tensions rose rise between the peasants and local governments across the country.  Creation of the organization  Southeastern part of Poland was the area in which individual farmers were very numerous and where position of the Roman Catholic Church was the strongest. Therefore, in early 1981, main center of farmers‚Äô protests was established in the city of Rzesz√≥w, where the strike and the sit-in began on January 5, 1981 and where the center of the movement was established. As Time magazine reported on Monday, February 2, 1981, members of Solidarity and Rural Solidarity occupied \\"Headquarters of the old official trade union\\" (in fact, it was The House of the Railroad Worker25th Anniversary of the Rzeszow - Ustrzyki Agreement), where they placed a sign which said: \\"SOLIDARITY IS MORE THAN JUST A NAME\\". The united front of both organizations demanded negotiations toward legitimizing the farmers' union.TIME, Monday, February 02, 1981 Other centers of farmers protests were also located in southeastern Poland, in the towns of Ustrzyki Dolne and Nowy SƒÖcz, but Solidarity members had been evicted from occupied buildings there. It must be noticed that the Solidarity trade union, and its leaders, such as Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa, fully supported demands of it the peasants. As one Solidarity official said, \\"We got in touch with our people in all of the major factories around here and let them know that if the police interfered here there would be a general strike without further notice\\".  Rzesz√≥w-Ustrzyki Agreement  At the beginning of 1981, peasants striking in Rzesz√≥w joined forces with their comrades from Ustrzyki Dolne, who had been on strike since December 28, 1980, occupying the local government office. The strike in Ustrzyki became known across the country. In different locations in Poland, several strikes broke out (including a hunger strike in ≈öwidnicaEwa Nalewajko, Political Parties and Agriculture in Poland ), and on February 18, 1981, negotiations began. The peasants were helped by such personalities, as Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa, Andrzej Gwiazda, Andrzej Stelmachowski and Jadwiga Staniszkis. Also, among supporters of the peasants, was Primate Stefan Wyszy≈Ñski, who on February 6, 1981, confirmed \\"the right of the farmers to found freely their own associations\\".The Polish Revolution By Timothy Garton Ash, page 141 The Rzesz√≥w-Ustrzyki Agreement was signed in the night of February 18/19 (in Ustrzyki) and February 20 (in Rzesz√≥w). The government, represented by Minister of Agriculture Andrzej Kacala, did not give permission to creation of a free trade union of the peasants, but legal protection of inheritance of land was confirmed. Other concessions included permission to construct more churches in the countryside and promise of equal treatment of individual farmers. Another concession won by the farmers was the government's promise to reduce its \\"pleasure lands\\" and reduce the number of facilities selling alcohol. Nevertheless, the state refused to register the organization, stating that the farmers were not wage earners and therefore could not be unionized. A Force More Powerful By Peter Ackerman, Jack DuVall, page 155 The Agreement was signed by Minister Kacala, who represented the Government, and Jozef Slisz, Jan Kulaj, Antoni Kopaczewski, Bogdan Lis and Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa. Due to its significance, it is sometimes called the \\"Constitution of the Polish Countryside\\".Last victims of Stalinism in Poland, interview with Wie≈Ñczys≈Çaw Nowacki  Legalization of Rural Solidarity  However, Rural Solidarity was not legalized until May 12, 1981, after another farmers strike, this time in Bydgoszcz, where it resulted in a major incident, which sparked off the 1981 warning strike in Poland. Its first leader became Jan Ku≈Çaj, and the union was banned on December 13, 1981 (see: Martial Law in Poland). Among those who supported restoration of the Rural Solidarity, was Pope John Paul II, who called for it during his 1987 visit to Poland, saying: \\"A Pope cannot remain quiet about this even if he were not a Pole\\".RESTORE RURAL SOLIDARITY, POPE SAYS Rural Solidarity returned in 1989 (see: Polish Round Table Agreement), and has existed since then. Among its leaders, there are Gabriel Janowski, Artur Balazs, Roman Bartoszcze, and Roman Wierzbicki.

She is the mother of production manager/producer Roberto Malerba (from her marriage to Gino Malerba) and production coordinator Damian Anderson.  Early career  Lee was born in Wolverhampton, England and educated at the Italia Conti Theatre School in London; graduating in 1960. She moved to Rome shortly afterwards to pursue a career in films. Her film debut came in the sword and sandal adventure Fire Monsters Against the Son of Hercules (1962), where she played the female lead alongside Reg Lewis, but it was a string of popular comedies that initially made Lee a star in Italy. With a blonde, fluffy look modelled after Marilyn Monroe, Lee spent the first half of the 1960s appearing in numerous Italian comedies and parodies ‚Äì several of which starred the popular comedic duo Franco Franchi and Ciccio Ingrassia. Few of these films received much, if any, distribution in English-speaking territories but they were highly successful in Italy, and made Lee a well-known film actress.  Eurospy films  Around the mid 1960s, Lee moved away from comedies and started appearing in a long line of Eurospy films, where she was frequently cast as sexy femme fatales. Her appearance also changed as she dropped the blonde Marilyn Monroe-inspired look and became a brunette instead. Some of the most famous Eurospy films Lee starred in were Our Agent Tiger (1965) by Claude Chabrol, Agent 077: From the Orient with Fury (1965) by Sergio Grieco and Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die (1966) by Henry Levin.  International career  Lee's beauty and talent also caught the eye of international film producer Harry Alan Towers, who gave Lee wider international recognition by casting her in prominent roles in several of his all-star cast productions; starting with the British thriller Circus of Fear (1966), directed by John Llewellyn Moxey. Towers also cast Lee in the spy-comedy Our Man in Marrakesh (1966), directed by Don Sharp; the action film Five Golden Dragons (1967), directed by Jeremy Summers; the thrillers Venus in Furs (1969) and The Bloody Judge (1970), both directed by Jes√∫s Franco; and finally in Dorian Gray (1970), directed by Massimo Dallamano. Lee's co-star in Circus of Fear, Five Golden Dragons, Coplan Saves His Skin and Venus in Furs was the renowned German actor Klaus Kinski (who was also a regular in Harry Alan Towers productions). The pairing of Lee and Kinski would prove to be very popular among cinema-goers ‚Äì especially in Italy ‚Äì so they would continue to act together until the early 1970s; appearing in a total of 12 films together. Outside of her work for Towers, Lee didn't appear in any further international films but in 1972 she guest starred in the British TV series The Protectors, in the episode \\"The Numbers Game\\".  Television  Lee alongside Raffaele Pisu and the puppet Provolino in an Italian TV-show (1970) Margaret Lee was also popular on Italian television in the 1960s; appearing as a showgirl alongside the famous singer Johnny Dorelli. Lee also starred with Dorelli in his film debut Arriva Dorellik, also known as How to Kill 400 Duponts (1967). Lee also starred as Cinderella in the Italian TV special Il Cenerentola in 1969.  Later career  By the early 1970s, Lee's movie career had descended further and further into exploitation; culminating in Fernando Di Leo's extremely sleazy and violent thriller Slaughter Hotel (1971). She would eventually disappear from the Italian movie scene in 1974, and return to England. Lee returned to Italy in 1981, however, and made a minor movie comeback in Dino Risi's comedy Sesso e volentieri (1982), which reunited her with her old co-star Johnny Dorelli. But Lee's comeback was to be a short one as she only appeared in one further film, the very obscure crime-comedy Neapolitan Sting (1983), before retiring from movies altogether.

The 1989 French film Je suis le seigneur du ch√¢teau directed by R√©gis Wargnier is loosely based on the novel. Plot summary Joseph Hooper has inherited a large house, and lives with his 10-year-old son Edmund Hooper. They have a cold, formal relationship that lacks any compassion. Joseph announces that a housekeeper will be moving in, and will bring her son who is of a similar age to Edmund. Mrs. Helena Kingshaw and her son Charles arrive at Warings. Edmund becomes defensive of his house, and instantly takes a dislike to Charles. He proceeds to taunt and bully Charles. The family take a trip to Leydell Castle. Charles exploits Edmunds's own fears as they climb the ancient monument. Edmund falls and is badly injured. As he recovers, it appears that Charles is becoming more independent, and he meets a local boy by the name of Fielding. Fielding appears confident and well- rounded, and takes Charles to his farm where he witnesses the birth of a calf. This is in stark contrast to Warings, which is filled with death and morbidity. Fielding offers Charles hope away from the manipulative clutches of Edmund. Once Edmund returns to health, the regime of taunting resumes. Edmund's cruelty climaxes, and Charles is devastated when he discovers that Helena and Joseph have agreed to marry, and that Edmund and Charles will attend school together. The novel ends with Charles committing suicide by drowning himself in the familiar stream in Hang Wood and Mrs. Kingshaw comforting Edmund, who is described as feeling triumphant.

EDS were first defined, and their arithmetic properties studied, by Morgan WardMorgan Ward, Memoir on elliptic divisibility sequences, Amer. J. Math. 70 (1948), 31-74. in the 1940s. They attracted only sporadic attention until around 2000, when EDS were taken up as a class of nonlinear recurrences that are more amenable to analysis than most such sequences. This tractability is due primarily to the close connection between EDS and elliptic curves. In addition to the intrinsic interest that EDS have within number theory, EDS have applications to other areas of mathematics including logic and cryptography.  Definition  A (nondegenerate) elliptic divisibility sequence (EDS) is a sequence of integers defined recursively by four initial values , , , , with ‚â† 0 and with subsequent values determined by the formulas : begin{align} W_{2n+1}W_1^3 &= W_{n+2}W_n^3 - W_{n+1}^3W_{n-1},qquad n ge 2,  W_{2n}W_2W_1^2 &= W_{n+2}W_n W_{n-1}^2 - W_n W_{n-2}W_{n+1}^2,qquad nge 3, end{align} It can be shown that if divides each of , , and if further divides , then every term in the sequence is an integer.  Divisibility property  An EDS is a divisibility sequence in the sense that : m mid n Longrightarrow W_m mid W_n. In particular, every term in an EDS is divisible by , so EDS are frequently normalized to have = 1 by dividing every term by the initial term. Any three integers , , with divisible by lead to a normalized EDS on setting : W_1 = 1,quad W_2 = b,quad W_3 = c,quad W_4 = d. It is not obvious, but can be proven, that the condition  suffices to ensure that every term in the sequence is an integer.  General recursion  A fundamental property of elliptic divisibility sequences is that they satisfy the general recursion relation : W_{n+m}W_{n-m}W_r^2 = W_{n+r}W_{n-r}W_m^2 - W_{m+r}W_{m-r}W_n^2 quadtext{for all}quad n > m > r. (This formula is often applied with = 1 and = 1.)  Nonsingular EDS  The discriminant of a normalized EDS is the quantity : Delta = W_4W_2^{15} - W_3^3W_2^{12} + 3W_4^2W_2^{10} - 20W_4W_3^3W_2^7 + 3W_4^3W_2^5 + 16W_3^6W_2^4 + 8W_4^2W_3^3W_2^2 + W_4^4. An EDS is nonsingular if its discriminant is nonzero.  Examples  A simple example of an EDS is the sequence of natural numbers 1, 2, 3,‚Ä¶ . Another interesting example is 1, 3, 8, 21, 55, 144, 377, 987,‚Ä¶ consisting of every other term in the Fibonacci sequence, starting with the second term. However, both of these sequences satisfy a linear recurrence and both are singular EDS. An example of a nonsingular EDS is : begin{align} &1,, 1,, -1,, 1,, 2,, -1,, -3,, -5,, 7,, -4,, -23,, 29,, 59,, 129, &-314,, -65,, 1529,, -3689,, -8209,, -16264,dots. end{align}  Periodicity of EDS  A sequence is said to be periodic if there is a number so that = for every ‚â• 1. If a nondegenerate EDS is periodic, then one of its terms vanishes. The smallest ‚â• 1 with = 0 is called the rank of apparition of the EDS. A deep theorem of Mazur B. Mazur. Modular curves and the Eisenstein ideal, Inst. Hautes √âtudes Sci. Publ. Math. 47:33-186, 1977. implies that if the rank of apparition of an EDS is finite, then it satisfies ‚â§ 10 or = 12.  Elliptic curves and points associated to EDS  Ward proves that associated to any nonsingular EDS () is an elliptic curve /Q and a point Œµ (Q) such that : W_n = psi_n(P)qquadtext{for all}~n ge 1. Here œà is the division polynomial of ; the roots of œà are the nonzero points of order on . There is a complicated formula This formula is due to Ward. See the appendix to J. H. Silverman and N. Stephens. The sign of an elliptic divisibility sequence. J. Ramanujan Math. Soc., 21(1):1-17, 2006. for and in terms of , , , and . There is an alternative definition of EDS that directly uses elliptic curves and yields a sequence which, up to sign, almost satisfies the EDS recursion. This definition starts with an elliptic curve /Q given by a Weierstrass equation and a nontorsion point Œµ (Q). One writes the -coordinates of the multiples of as : x(nP) = frac{A_n}{D_n^2} quad text{with}~gcd(A_n,D_n)=1~text{and}~D_n ge 1. Then the sequence () is also called an elliptic divisibility sequence. It is a divisibility sequence, and there exists an integer so that the subsequence ( ¬± ) ‚â• 1 (with an appropriate choice of signs) is an EDS in the earlier sense.  Growth of EDS  Let be a nonsingular EDS that is not periodic. Then the sequence grows quadratic exponentially in the sense that there is a positive constant such that : lim_{ntoinfty} frac{log W_n}{n^2} = h > 0. The number is the canonical height of the point on the elliptic curve associated to the EDS.  Primes and primitive divisors in EDS  It is conjectured that a nonsingular EDS contains only finitely many primes M. Einsiedler, G. Everest, and T. Ward. Primes in elliptic divisibility sequences. LMS J. Comput. Math., 4:1-13 (electronic), 2001. However, all but finitely many terms in a nonsingular EDS admit a primitive prime divisor. J. H. Silverman. Wieferich's criterion and the abc-conjecture. J. Number Theory, 30(2):226-237, 1988. Thus for all but finitely many , there is a prime such that divides , but does not divide for all < . This statement is an analogue of Zsigmondy's theorem.  EDS over finite fields  An EDS over a finite field F, or more generally over any field, is a sequence of elements of that field satisfying the EDS recursion. An EDS over a finite field is always periodic, and thus has a rank of apparition . The period of an EDS over F then has the form , where and satisfy : r le left(sqrt q+1right)^2 quadtext{and}quad t mid q-1. More precisely, there are elements and in F* such that : W_{ri+j} = W_jcdot A^{ij} cdot B^{j^2} quadtext{for all}~i ge 0~text{and all}~j ge 1. The values of and are related to the Tate pairing of the point on the associated elliptic curve.  Applications of EDS  Bjorn Poonen B. Poonen.

He uses the existence of primitive divisors in EDS on elliptic curves of rank one to prove the undecidability of Hilbert's tenth problem over certain rings of integers. Katherine Stange K. Stange.

She shows how EDS can be used to compute the value of the Weil and Tate pairings on elliptic curves over finite fields. These pairings have numerous applications in pairing-based cryptography.

Given a Poincar√© complex X (more geometrically a Poincar√© space), a normal map on X endows the space, roughly speaking, with some of the homotopy-theoretic global structure of a closed manifold. In particular, X has a good candidate for a stable normal bundle and a Thom collapse map, which is equivalent to there being a map from a manifold M to X matching the fundamental classes and preserving normal bundle information. If the dimension of X is ge 5 there is then only the algebraic topology surgery obstruction due to C. T. C. Wall to X actually being homotopy equivalent to a closed manifold. Normal maps also apply to the study of the uniqueness of manifold structures within a homotopy type, which was pioneered by Sergei Novikov. The cobordism classes of normal maps on X are called normal invariants. Depending on the category of manifolds (differentiable, piecewise-linear, or topological), there are similarly defined, but inequivalent, concepts of normal maps and normal invariants. It is possible to perform surgery on normal maps, meaning surgery on the domain manifold, and preserving the map. Surgery on normal maps allows one to systematically kill elements in the relative homotopy groups by representing them as embeddings with trivial normal bundle. Definition There are two equivalent definitions of normal maps, depending on whether one uses normal bundles or tangent bundles of manifolds. Hence it is possible to switch between the definitions which turns out to be quite convenient. 1. Given a Poincar√© complex X (i.e. a CW-complex whose cellular chain complex satisfies Poincar√© duality) of formal dimension n, a normal map on X consists of * a map fcolon M to X from some closed n-dimensional manifold M, * a bundle xi over X, and a stable map from the stable normal bundle u_M of M to xi, and * usually the normal map is supposed to be of degree one. That means that the fundamental class of M should be mapped under f to the fundamental class of X: f_*([M])=[X]in H_n(X). 2. Given a Poincar√© complex X (i.e. a CW-complex whose cellular chain complex satisfies Poincar√© duality) of formal dimension n, a normal map on X (with respect to the tangent bundle) consists of * a map fcolon M to X from some closed n-dimensional manifold M, * a bundle xi over X, and a stable map from the stable tangent bundle tau_M oplus varepsilon^k of M to xi, and * similarly as above it is required that the fundamental class of M should be mapped under f to the fundamental class of X: f_*([M])=[X]in H_n(X). Two normal maps are equivalent if there exists a normal bordism between them. Role in surgery theory=Surgery on maps versus surgery on normal maps= Consider the question: : Is the Poincar√© complex X of formal dimension n homotopy-equivalent to a closed n-manifold? A naive surgery approach to this question would be: start with some map Mto X from some manifold M to X, and try to do surgery on it to make a homotopy equivalence out of it. Notice the following: Since our starting map was arbitrarily chosen, and surgery always produces cobordant maps, this procedure has to be performed (in the worst case) for all cobordism classes of maps Mto X. This kind of cobordism theory is a homology theory whose coefficients have been calculated by Thom: therefore the cobordism classes of such maps are computable at least in theory for all spaces X. However, it turns out that it is very difficult to decide whether it is possible to make a homotopy equivalence out of the map by means of surgery, whereas the same question is much easier when the map comes with the extra structure of a normal map. Therefore, in the classical surgery approach to our question, one starts with a normal map fcolon Mto X (suppose there exists any), and performs surgery on it. This has several advantages: * The map being of degree one implies that the homology of M splits as a direct sum of the homology of X and the so- called surgery kernel K_*(M)=ker(f_*colon H_*(M)to H_*(X)), that is H_*(M)=K_*(M) oplus H_*(X). (Here we suppose that f induces an isomorphism of fundamental groups and use homology with local coefficients in Z[pi_1(X)].) By Whitehead's theorem, the map f is a homotopy equivalence if and only if the surgery kernel is zero. * The bundle data implies the following: Suppose that an element alphainpi_{p+1}(f) (the relative homotopy group of f) can be represented by an embedding phi:S^pto M (or more generally an immersion) with a null-homotopy of f circ phi:S^p to X. Then it can be represented by an embedding (or immersion) whose normal bundle is stably trivial. This observation is important since surgery is only possible on embeddings with a trivial normal bundle. For example, if p is less than half the dimension of X, every map S^pto X is homotopic to an embedding by a theorem of Whitney. On the other hand, every stably trivial normal bundle of such an embedding is automatically trivial, since pi_p(BO, BO_k)=0 for k>p. Therefore, surgery on normal maps can always be done below the middle dimension. This is not true for arbitrary maps. Notice that this new approach makes it necessary to classify the bordism classes of normal maps, which are the normal invariants. Contrarily to cobordism classes of maps, the normal invariants are a cohomology theory. Its coefficients are known in the case of topological manifolds. For the case of smooth manifolds, the coefficients of the theory are much more complicated. =Normal invariants versus structure set= There are two reasons why it is important to study the set mathcal{N} (X). Recall that the main goal of surgery theory is to answer the questions: 1. Given a finite Poincar√© complex X is there an n-manifold homotopy equivalent to X? 2. Given two homotopy equivalences f_i colon M_i rightarrow X, where i = 0,1 is there a diffeomorphism h colon M_0 rightarrow M_1 such that f_1 circ h simeq f_0? Notice that if the answer to these questions should be positive then it is a necessary condition that the answer to the following two questions is positive 1.' Given a finite Poincar√© complex X is there a degree one normal map (f,b) colon M rightarrow X? 2.' Given two homotopy equivalences f_i colon M_i rightarrow X, where i = 0,1 is there a normal cobordism (F,B) colon (W,M,M') to (M times I, M times 0, M times 1) such that partial F_0 = f_0 and partial F_1 = f_1 ? This is of course an almost trivial observation, but it is important because it turns out that there is an effective theory which answers question 1.' and also an effective theory which answers question 1. provided the answer to 1.' is yes. Similarly for questions 2. and 2.' Notice also that we can phrase the questions as follows: 1.' Is mathcal{N} (X) eq emptyset? 2.' Is f_0 = f_1 in mathcal{N} (X)? Hence studying mathcal{N} (X) is really a first step in trying to understand the surgery structure set mathcal{S} (X) which is the main goal in surgery theory. The point is that mathcal{N} (X) is much more accessible from the point of view of algebraic topology as is explained below. Homotopy theory 1.' Let X be a finite n-dimensional Poincar√© complex. It is useful to use the definition of mathcal{N} (X) with normal bundles. Recall that a (smooth) manifold has a unique tangent bundle and a unique stable normal bundle. But a finite Poincar√© complex does not possess such a unique bundle. Nevertheless, it possesses a substitute - a unique in some sense spherical fibration - the so-called Spivak normal fibration. This has a property that if X is homotopy equivalent to a manifold then the spherical fibration associated to the pullback of the normal bundle of that manifold is isomorphic to the Spivak normal fibration. So it follows that if mathcal{N} (X) eq emptyset then the Spivak normal fibration has a bundle reduction. By the Pontrjagin-Thom construction the converse is also true. This can be formulated in terms of homotopy theory. Recall BG the classifying space for stable spherical fibrations, BO the classifying space for stable vector bundles and the map J colon BO rightarrow BG which is induced by the inclusion O hookrightarrow G and which corresponds to taking the associated spherical fibration of a vector bundle. In fact we have a fibration sequence BO rightarrow BG rightarrow B(G/O). The Spivak normal fibration is classified by a map u_X colon X rightarrow BG. It has a vector bundle reduction if and only if u_X has a lift tilde{ u}_X colon X rightarrow BO. This is equivalent to requiring that the composition X rightarrow BG rightarrow B(G/O) is null-homotopic. Note that the homotopy groups of B(G/O) are known in certain low-dimensions and are non-trivial which suggests the possibility that the above condition can fail for some X. There are in fact such finite Poincar√© complexes, and the first example was obtained by Gitler and Stasheff, yielding thus an example of a Poincar√© complex not homotopy equivalent to a manifold. 2.' Relativizing the above considerations one obtains an (unnatural) bijection mathcal{N} (X) cong [X,G/O]. Different categories The above bijection gives mathcal{N} (X) a structure of an abelian group since the space G/O is a loop space and in fact an infinite loop space so the normal invariants are a zeroth cohomology group of an extraordinary cohomology theory defined by that infinite loop space. Note that similar ideas apply in the other categories of manifolds and one has bijections : mathcal{N} (X) cong [X,G/O], and mathcal{N}^{PL} (X) cong [X,G/PL], and mathcal{N}^{TOP} (X) cong [X,G/TOP]. It is well known that the spaces : G/O, G/PL and G/TOP are mutually not homotopy equivalent and hence one obtains three different cohomology theories. Sullivan analyzed the cases G/PL and G/TOP. He showed that these spaces possess alternative infinite loop space structures which are in fact better from the following point of view: Recall that there is a surgery obstruction map from normal invariants to the L-group. With the above described groups structure on the normal invariants this map is NOT a homomorphism. However, with the group structure from Sullivan's theorem it becomes a homomorphism in the categories CAT = PL, and TOP. His theorem also links these new group structures to the well-known cohomology theories: the singular cohomology and real K-theory.

The community includes the comprehensive Jewish school, Or Avner; the kindergarten, Gan Menachem; the yeshiva, Tomhey Tmimim; and the summer camp for boys and girls, Gan Isroel. History Jews have lived on the territory of Nizhny Novgorod since the 19th century. The laws of the Russian Empire prohibited Jews from living in the center of Russia, allowing them land only in the Pale of Settlement. Only merchants of the top guild and retired soldiers of the imperial army could live there. Nevertheless, the high trade and industrial development of Nizhny Novgorod attracted people, and Jews started arrive at Nizhny Novgorod from western regions of the empire. The majority of migrants were dealers and merchants. They arrived at Nizhny Novgorod to different trade fairs on the territory of the famous local fair. But there was no permanent Jewish community in the city until 1840, prompted by the decree of the tsar that started to recruit Jews for military service. The community of Nizhny Novgorod was said to have been founded by the tsar's soldiers, because soldiers were required to live in the city where they served. They subsequently became merchants and traders. The Nizhny Novgorod synagogue thumb In 1850, the Nizhny Novgorod community numbered 300 people, and there were 3000 people in 1913. The synagogue was built in the period from 1881 to 1883. The synagogue was led by a rabbi and a chief rabbi. There they formed a yeshiva and held charitable and funeral services. Despite the increase of Jewish refugees in Nizhny Novgorod, government policy was aimed at reducing the Jewish population in the Nizhny Novgorod region. By 1938 all the synagogue, club and national society was abolished. The synagogue was re- established in 1991 after the fall of the Soviet regime. Current status The revival of the Jewish community began in 1989, when several influential Jewish cities organized the Jewish Culture Club. Later, Lipa Gruzman registered religious communities officially and began taking action to return the synagogue buildings. September 1991 brought the opening of the Sunday Jewish School, and on April 17 the synagogue held an official opening ceremony after its renovation. In 1989 Edward M. Chaprak was appointed as head of the community. In 1999 Shimon Bergman came to Nizhny Novgorod to serve as the Chief Rabbi of the city. Under his leadership, the daily minyan was updated in the synagogue, and various Jewish institutions were opened in the city: the school Or Avner-Habad; the kindergarten, Gan Menachem; a youth club; and a summer camp with a boarding yeshiva, Torah lessons, and various activities for holidays. Two years later, the mikvah for women was built.

IU incorporates live theatrics including a huge box covered in circuit boards and swinging on the venue's pipes 20 feet in the air to smashing guitars live on stage. History=Formation= After Denial and shortly after graduating high school, Kopec formed the first original line up for Intricate Unit. He incorporated a drummer, Chris Densky, and live guitarist, Jay Saucier. The trio performed many live shows and opened up for such acts as Dope, Hanzel Und Gretyl, Zeromancer, Bile, and Nocturne. This line up eventually dissolved because Densky decided to focus all his energy on this original band, Adva, and Saucier and Kopec has moral differences. Densky is currently the drummer for Deadstar Assembly. IU wasn't quiet for long and quickly recruited 2 new live members. This time, a live bassist, Roger Lockshier, known to the fans as Z, and live guitarist, Mark Turko. Kopec knew it was necessary to be open minded. It was with this line up that the trio incorporated a manual light show by stepping on switches created from electrical boxes during the live performance. The showcasing of what was to be known as \\"the frame\\" was also used during live performances. This cast a huge shadow of Kopec during the intro of their set while emerging to the music of Karl Orf's Carmina Burana. Intricate Unit's current line up consists of keyboardist, Ryan Dest, known better as DJ Nitez and live guitarist, Tom Voytek. =Deception (1999)= Ben Kopec was releasing albums in high school three years before ever playing out live. Kopec bought his first drum machine when he was 15 and first computer and sound module when he was 17. Once all the tools were in place, it took less than a year for him to compile his first EP, Deception. It is a true fact that his mother actually recorded a vocal part for the song Pensive while Kopec was writing the song still living in his parents house. The artwork on this album displays Kopec's like of the artist Leonardo da Vinci. To date, none of these songs have ever been played live. =Denial (2000)= Denial was released while Kopec was a senior in high school. This 13 track album marked the first full-length release for Intricate Unit. The songs on this album are very Industrial sounding compared to his later releases that sound more like Industrial rock. This is the album that Kopec also created the tri-circle, a symbolic idea of his own representing what he recognizes as three stages of life repeating. The three stages of life are birth, life, and death, encompassed in a circle, representing that when one dies, one is just going to be reborn. This idea is consistent with reincarnation. Prior to the Denial release, Kopec had lost all of the audio due to a computer error and had to re-record all of the audio including vocals, guitars, and sound effects This delayed the release of the album by months. =Detached (2003‚Äì2004)= Before the original line up dissolving, Densky and Saucier performed live to help promote the release of Intricate Unit's second full-length album, Detached. Detached also had subsequent releases entitled, Detached (Detached). This latter album contained completely remixed and remastered songs with bonus tracks that would eventually appear on Thru-Hole. The cover of this album is a picture that Kopec edited himself of an ex-girlfriends bathroom tub after she died her hair red. =Thru-Hole (2005‚Äì2006)= Vaccination Nation was the band's first single and was released on this album. Tours Intricate Unit has performed with many other bands from the East Coast to the Mid-West. IU currently also receives radio play in over 15 states, as they expand their territory to becoming a national act. Intricate Unit has opened for such acts as Zeromancer, Insane Clown Posse, Hanzel Und Gretly, and Bile.

Early life Scanavino was born in Genoa. In 1938 he enrolled to the Art School Nicol√≤ Barabino where he met Mario Calonghi, who was teaching at the school and was due to be a great influence on Scanavino's artistic formation. In 1942 he had his first exhibition at the Salone Romano of Genoa. In the same year he enrolled at the Faculty of Architecture at the Milan University. In 1946 he married Giorgina Graglia. In 1947 Scanavino moved to Paris where he met poets and artists such as Edouard Jaguer, Wols and Camille Bryen. This experience proved to be inspirational. He was especially interested in Cubism, which he rendered into a personal interpretation when he exhibited at the Gallery Isola in Genoa in 1948. In 1950 Scanavino and Rocco Borrella joined \\"I sette del Numero\\",http://www.archivioroccoborella.org/ an artistic group revolving around the Numero Gallery in Florence. In the same year he was invited to the 27th edition of the Venice Biennale and in 1951 he had a two-person exhibition with the sculptor Sarah Jackson at the Apollinaire Gallery in London. Emilio Scanavino and Sarah Jackson in London, 1951 During his time in London Scanavino met Philip Martin, Eduardo Paolozzi, Graham Sutherland and Francis Bacon. In the same year he opened his first studio in Milan in an attic in Foro Bonaparte. Critic Guido Ballo and dealers Guido Le Noci and Arturo Schwartz were early champions of his works. In 1952, Scanavino worked at the Marzotti's Ceramic Factory in Albissola Marina, where he met and befriended many artists, including Lucio Fontana, Asger Jorn, Corneille, Roberto Matta, Wifredo Lam, Giuseppe Capogrossi, Enrico Baj, Sergio Dangelo, Roberto Crippa, Gianni Dova, Agenore Fabbri and Aligi Sassu. In 1954 he exhibited again at the Venice Biennale and in 1955 he received the Graziano Prize. In 1958 he won the Lissone Prize and the Prampolini Prize for a solo presentation at the Venice Biennale. In the same year he moved to Milan where he joined the Naviglio Gallery directed by Carlo Cardazzo with whom he established a long-standing friendship and proficuous working relation. In Milan he also met the art collector Gianni Malabarba with whom he established a strongfriendship. Later life In 1962 Scanavino bought an old house in Calice Ligure, which he later converted into a studio space. In 1963, after winning the La Spezia Prize, Scanavino learned of the sudden death of Carlo Cardazzo. Cardazzo's brother, Renato, continued to run the Naviglio Gallery but the loss of Carlo had a huge impact in scanavino's life. After participating for the fourth time to the Venice Biennale, when he won the Pininfarina Prize, Scanavino permanently moved to Calice Ligure in 1968.Emilio Scanavino & C - La leggenda degli Artisti di Calice Ligure. a cura di Stephano Delphino e Gianni Viola - De Ferrari, Genova. In 1970 he won the Gran Prix at the 10th Mentone Biennale and met Franco Castelli, then editor of L'uomo e l'Arte, who became one of his closest friends and supporters In 1971 Scanavino had to undergo a major surgery operation. The recovery period signaled the start of a new creative phase in his painting. He travelled to Belgium, France and Germany, and in 1974 the Darmstadt Kunsthalle organized a comprehensive antological exhibition that later travelled to Venice's Palazzo Grassi and Milan's Royal Palace. In 1982, Scanavino's health started to decline. His last exhibition was the 1986 edition of the Rome Quadriennale. Scanavino died in Milan on 28 November 1986. Il Muro, 1954. Oil on canvas, 105 x 120 cm Art After an initial interest in figurative art, Scanavino's paintings took Post-Cubist nuances. His forms became increasingly stylized, until being completely obliterated in the works from the early 1950s. In 1954 his characteristic sign, ‚Äústylized knot‚Äù, started to appear. That is the, eventually marking his whole production. In the late 1970s years paintings, the ‚Äúknot‚Äù became perfectly defined and recognizable, although his work became darker, sometimes even threatening due to the conspicuous presence of red stains resembling blood. Although Scanavino is difficult to place inside a specific artistic movement, he can be considered an informal abstractist, close to the Abstract Expressionism and Hans Hartung and Georges Mathieu's art.

It was incorporated on 22 November 1972 under Companies Act, 1956. GIC Re has its registered office and headquarters in Mumbai. It was the sole reinsurance company in the Indian insurance market until the insurance market was open to foreign reinsurance players by late 2016 including companies from Germany, Switzerland and France. GIC Re's shares are listed on BSE Limited and National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. GIC Re was ranked in Forbes' list of World's Best Employers and Top Regarded Companies in 2019.  Making of GIC Re  The business of general insurance was nationalised through The General Insurance (Emergency) Provisions Ordinance promulgated on 13 May 1971 and thereby the business being carried on by 107 entities was consolidated and restructured into four companies namely The New India Assurance Company Limited, Bombay, United India Fire & General Insurance Company Limited, Madras, Oriental Fire & General Insurance Company Limited, Bombay and National Insurance Company Limited, Calcutta (New India Assurance Co. Ltd., United India Insurance Co. Ltd., The Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd., and National Insurance Company Co. Ltd. respectively). The General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Act, 1972 (GIBNA) that followed paved the way for the Government to take over ownership of these businesses. Accordingly, GIC was incorporated on 22 November 1972 as a private company under Companies Act, 1956 in Bombay and received its Certificate for Commencement of Business on 1 January 1973. GIC‚Äôs stated role was to function as the holding company of the four companies, and superintend, control and carry on the business of General insurance on behalf of the Government of India. The first Chairman of GIC was A Rajagopalan, an Actuary and an officer of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS). M K Venkateshan and S K Desai were appointed the two Managing Directors of GIC. On 1 January 1973, GIC was notified as the reinsurer under Section 101 A of Insurance Act, 1938, making it the Indian reinsurer for receiving obligatory cessions, a role hitherto played by two companies called India Reinsurance Corporation Limited (India Re) and Indian Guarantee and General Insurance Company Limited (Indian Guarantee). GIC was reborn as a pure reinsurance company in November, 2000. It was re-notified as 'Indian reinsurer' under Insurance Act, 1938 and continued to receive obligatory cessions from direct insurers. It continued writing foreign inward reinsurance business purely on its own account from 1 April 2002. With effect from 21 March 2003, the four subsidiaries were delinked from GIC by an administrative order from the Ministry of Finance and became directly owned by the Government. Retaining its name, the company rebranded itself as \\"GIC Re\\" to denote its new identity.  Operations  All direct general insurance companies of India are required by law to cede a mandatory percentage of every policy value to GIC Re subject to some limitations and exceptions. This percentage of cession is decided by the IRDAIhttps://www.irdai.gov.in/ADMINCMS/cms/frmGeneral_Layout.aspx?page=PageNo4047&flag;=1 on an annual basis. As GIC Re spreads its wings to emerge as an effective reinsurance solutions partner for the Afro-Asian region and has started leading the reinsurance programmes of several insurance companies in SAARC countries, South East Asia, Middle East and Africa. GIC Re has its liaison/representative/branch offices in Delhi, Chennai, Dubai, Malaysia, London and Moscow. In April 2020, GIC Re‚Äôs Operations in Brazil got status upgrade from 'occasional reinsurer' to 'admitted reinsurer' by the Brazilian Superintendence of Private Insurance (SUSEP). It was published in the Brazilian Gazette on 14 April 2020.  Motto & Logo  On 26 August 1976, Chairman A Rajagopalan in GIC‚Äôs Board Minutes signed and approved the motto of GIC Re, √Épatk√£le Rakshisy√£mi. It a Sanskrit phrase that translates into, \\"I shall protect you in times of distress.\\" In 1980s, GIC‚Äôs logo was modified and the motto was incorporated in Devanagari Script.  Suraksha  At the time of its creation, GIC was headquartered in the fourth floor of Industrial Assurance Building owned by LIC. GIC acquired Jeevan Kendra that belonged to LIC and housed its Bombay Zonal Office. It was extensively renovated retaining its curved front and then gilded with panels of reflective glass. It has a circular atrium running the height of the building that streams light into the building and brightens it up. The locals called it 'sheesh mahal,‚Äô meaning glass palace, due to its glassy exterior, a rare look in earlier days. This building was eventually named as 'Suraksha,‚Äô meaning protection, an apt name for the headquarters of the General insurance industry. Suraksha became the Registered and Head Office of GIC, and all its departments moved in from their various locations in March, 1992.  Leadership = BOARD = GIC Re‚Äôs Board of Director consists of Mr. Devesh Srivastava (Chairman-and-Managing Director), Mr. A K Das (MD and CEO, BOI), Mr. V Ramasamy (Independent Director), Mr. Amarendra Pratap Singh (Independent Director), Mr. G B Pande (Independent Director), Ms. Dakshita Das (Additional Secretary, DFS), and Ms. A Manimekhalai (Executive Director, Canara Bank). = EXECUTIVES = Mr. Devesh Srivastava is the currently appointed Chairman- and- Managing Director of GIC Re.

The Company is promoted by General Insurance Corporation of India and its erstwhile subsidiaries namely, National Insurance Company Limited, The New India Assurance Company Limited, The Oriental Insurance Company Limited and United India Insurance Company Limited.  Reinsurance Pools  Pooling arrangements have been used worldwide as alternative risk transfer mechanism in insurance sector majorly for high severity low frequency risks wherein conventional products fail on price variability. An insurance pool is a multiple member, risk sharing arrangement where organisation pool their funds together to finance an exposure, liability, risk or some combination of three. GIC Re is manager for Indian Market Terrorism Risk Insurance Pool (IMTRIP), The FAIR Natural Catastrophe Reinsurance Pool (FNCRIP) and India Nuclear Insurance Pool (INIP). = Indian Market Terrorism Risk Insurance Pool (IMTRIP) = IMTRIP was formed in April 2002 as an initiative by all the non- life insurance companies in India in the aftermath of withdrawal of insurance and reinsurance capacity for terrorism risk in the international market, after the 9/11 incident. The Pool has now completed 18 years of successful operation and continuing to provide automatic capacity to the domestic insurance companies for covering terrorism risk. All non-life insurance companies operating in India including GIC Re are members of the Pool. The present membership strength of the Pool is 26. The Pool enables members/non-life insurance companies to provide insurance cover against terrorism risk in India on the combined underwriting capacity of the members. = The FAIR Natural Catastrophe Reinsurance Pool (FNCRIP) = FNCRIP was formed under the ambit of FAIR (Federation of Afro-Asian Insurers and Reinsurers) to meet the reinsurance requirements of insurers in the Afro-Asian region for natural catastrophe covers in the backdrop of increased frequency and severity of natural catastrophe events in the region. FNCRIP was launched in September 2013 during the 23rd FAIR Conference held in Beijing and is operational since 1 January 2014. The pool is backed by 13 strong regional insurers and reinsurers with good rating among which some are Government owned as well. = India Nuclear Insurance Pool (INIP) = INIP was formed in view of the enactment of Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act, 2010, as an initiative of GIC Re along with other domestic non-life Insurance companies by pooling the capacity to provide insurance covers for nuclear risks. The Pool was launched on 12 June 2015 with the total capacity of INR 1500 Crores. The Pool enables coverage for Nuclear Operators and Nuclear Suppliers against nuclear liability arising out of Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act, 2010 in India.  Ratings  For 2020,A M Best reaffirmed the Financial Strength Rating(FSR) of A- (Excellent) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating(ICR) of \\"a-\\" of GIC Re.

Sketch of the definition The surgery obstruction of a degree-one normal map has a relatively complicated definition. Consider a degree-one normal map (f,b) colon M to X. The idea in deciding the question whether it is normally cobordant to a homotopy equivalence is to try to systematically improve (f,b) so that the map f becomes m-connected (that means the homotopy groups pi_* (f)=0 for * leq m) for high m. It is a consequence of Poincar√© duality that if we can achieve this for m > lfloor n/2 rfloor then the map f already is a homotopy equivalence. The word systematically above refers to the fact that one tries to do surgeries on M to kill elements of pi_i (f). In fact it is more convenient to use homology of the universal covers to observe how connected the map f is. More precisely, one works with the surgery kernels K_i (tilde M) : = mathrm{ker} {f_* colon H_i (tilde M) rightarrow H_i (tilde X)} which one views as mathbb{Z}[pi_1 (X)]-modules. If all these vanish, then the map f is a homotopy equivalence. As a consequence of Poincar√© duality on M and X there is a mathbb{Z}[pi_1 (X)]-modules Poincar√© duality K^{n-i} (tilde M) cong K_i (tilde M), so one only has to watch half of them, that means those for which i leq lfloor n/2 rfloor. Any degree-one normal map can be made lfloor n/2 rfloor-connected by the process called surgery below the middle dimension. This is the process of killing elements of K_i (tilde M) for i < lfloor n/2 rfloor described here when we have p+q = n such that i = p < lfloor n/2 rfloor. After this is done there are two cases. 1. If n=2k then the only nontrivial homology group is the kernel K_k (tilde M) : = mathrm{ker} {f_* colon H_k (tilde M) rightarrow H_k (tilde X)}. It turns out that the cup-product pairings on M and X induce a cup-product pairing on K_k(tilde M). This defines a symmetric bilinear form in case k=2l and a skew-symmetric bilinear form in case k=2l+1. It turns out that these forms can be refined to varepsilon-quadratic forms, where varepsilon = (-1)^k. These varepsilon-quadratic forms define elements in the L-groups L_n (pi_1 (X)). 2. If n=2k+1 the definition is more complicated. Instead of a quadratic form one obtains from the geometry a quadratic formation, which is a kind of automorphism of quadratic forms. Such a thing defines an element in the odd-dimensional L-group L_n (pi_1 (X)). If the element theta (f,b) is zero in the L-group surgery can be done on M to modify f to a homotopy equivalence. Geometrically the reason why this is not always possible is that performing surgery in the middle dimension to kill an element in K_k (tilde M) possibly creates an element in K_{k-1} (tilde M) when n = 2k or in K_{k} (tilde M) when n=2k+1. So this possibly destroys what has already been achieved. However, if theta (f,b) is zero, surgeries can be arranged in such a way that this does not happen. Example In the simply connected case the following happens. If n = 2k+1 there is no obstruction. If n = 4l then the surgery obstruction can be calculated as the difference of the signatures of M and X. If n = 4l+2 then the surgery obstruction is the Arf- invariant of the associated kernel quadratic form over mathbb{Z}_2.

Crime On October 21, 1982, in the early morning, Larry Smith, an acquaintance of Briscoe, broke into a woman's apartment in suburban St. Louis, Missouri, robbed the woman of her jewelry at knifepoint, and then raped her. Smith remained with the woman, in a lit room, for an hour after the rape, while he smoked a cigarette and she smoked two. He told her that his name was Johnny Briscoe. After the rapist left the scene the victim called police. While police were still on the scene, Smith called the victim's apartment repeatedly, again identifying himself as Johnny Briscoe. These calls were traced back to a payphone near Briscoe's apartment. The woman identified Briscoe in both a photo and in a live police lineup in which Briscoe was the only person in an orange jumpsuit. Conviction A forensic chemist from the St. Louis County Crime Laboratory testified that semen was present on swabs from the victim‚Äôs rape kit as well as on pantyhose, a towel and the victim‚Äôs bed sheets. A forensic hair expert testified that a head hair found on the victim‚Äôs bed sheet showed characteristics similar to Briscoe‚Äôs head hair. Because there is not adequate empirical data on the frequency of various class characteristics in human hair, an analyst‚Äôs assertion that hairs are consistent or similar is inherently prejudicial and lacks probative value. Briscoe's attorney used an alibi defence, stating that Briscoe was at his apartment, watching Game 7 of the 1982 World Series (in which the St. Louis Cardinals defeated the Milwaukee Brewers). In the court room, Briscoe responded to a question and said that the Brewers won the World Series, making the alibi incredible. The jury took less than 2 hours to convict Briscoe of all the charges: rape, sodomy, burglary, robbery, stealing and armed criminal action. He was sentenced to 45 years in prison. Imprisonment and exoneration Briscoe spent five months in a cell adjacent to Larry Smith whom he confronted and accused of framing him. Smith denied the allegation. Briscoe's wife divorced him 10 years into the sentence. Briscoe requested that evidence from the crime scene be tested for DNA but the St. Louis District Attorney refused. In 1997 Briscoe's motion to compel the District Attorney to search for DNA evidence was rejected. In 2000, Centurion Ministries took the case, and, that year and again in 2001, requested that the St. Louis Crime Laboratory search for DNA evidence. The Lab responded that the evidence collected could not be found and was probably destroyed. In 2004, however, the cigarettes from the crime scene were found in an inventory, but the district attorney was not informed until July 6, 2006. Testing proved that Larry Smith was the criminal, not Briscoe. Briscoe, then 52, walked out of a Charleston, Mo. prison on July 19, 2006, just days after being told that the evidence had been found and tested, he has served 23 years behind bars. Post-release Briscoe's exoneration was widely covered in national news. It is taking some time for him to convince his family of his innocence, and for him to get a full-time job. He is suing St. Louis County and four police officers to compensate him for his time spent in prison. Smith was convicted of the crime and is incarcerated in the Southeast Correctional Center. Personal life Briscoe forced his wife to divorce him after his arrest. Briscoe had a daughter who was 7 and a son who was 2 when he was convicted..

Born at Belleville, Ontario, Brintnell joined the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) in Canada in 1917. A pilot, Brintnell instructed until his discharge in 1919, for the RFC at Fort Worth, Texas; the Royal Air Force at Camp Borden, Ontario; and the RAF in Upavon, England. Thereafter, he served as a commercial pilot with various operations. In 1927, he took employment with Western Canada Airways, quickly rising to the position of manager. He was involved in several historic events between 1928 and 1931, including piloting the first multi-engined return flight Winnipeg, Manitoba to Vancouver, British Columbia; the first flight around Great Bear Lake; and the first over-the- mountains flight from Aklavik, Northwest Territories to Dawson City, Yukon Territory. He also flew an historic 9,000 mile trip from Winnipeg across the Northwest Territories to Alaska. He left Canadian Airways Limited, the successor company of Western Canada Airways, soon after being appointed assistant general manager in 1931 so that he could form the Mackenzie Air Service Limited in Edmonton, Alberta. He sold the company to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company in 1940, but stayed on to help expand that business into Canadian Pacific Airlines. During World War II, he became a manager at Aircraft Repair Limited, overseeing the effort to maintain Canadian military aircraft, for which service he was created an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (O.B.E.)

A digital DJ licence is required in some countries, including the United Kingdom, Finland, Canada, Belgium and Italy, to publicly play digital copies of copyrighted music. The licence allows a DJ to copy music from original CDs, vinyl or other media, to a computer's hard drive, an MP3 player or other digital audio players, for example to be used with a vinyl emulation software program, or in some cases to other digital media, such as CD-R or MiniDisc. In the countries where digital DJ licensing is used, the licence is also required for playing music originally bought and downloaded directly on to a computer, usually in MP3 or similar format, unless the licence of the online music store explicitly allows the public performance of the downloaded tracks. Reasons for licensing The licence usually has two separate functions: To allow a DJ to copy and digitise music from other sources to a computer's hard drive, and to allow playing of music bought from an online music store. In the first case, a licence is needed because a copy of the original recording is used, and in the second, because the copyright collecting agencies of the countries which require licensing hold, that music bought from online music stores such as iTunes or Beatport requires additional licensing before it can be played publicly, thus making downloaded music not comparable to CDs and vinyl, which do not require an additional licence on the DJ's part to be played, as the venue where the music is played usually pays for a music licence which allows recorded music to be played. The reasoning for this is that music from online music stores is usually licensed solely for private use. The licensing systems are emerging since DJs have started to transfer their music collections on to laptops for use with vinyl emulation software or other DJing tools for various reasons, including reducing the amount of baggage, ease of searching, and the ability to have a much larger collection available than what would be practical if the music was stored on a larger physical media; and because the copyright laws in some countries do not permit the professional and/or public use of copies, even if copied from legitimate sources. Licensing by country The need for a licence, the details of it, and the costs vary from country to country. The licence is usually issued by the national organisations which protect the intellectual properties of composers, lyricists, arrangers and performers; or by other organisations which are licensed to sell such licences on their behalf. Sometimes the licence takes the form of leasing, and needs to be renewed yearly, and the tracks used under the licence may not be used after the licence expires, unless a new licence is acquired. For example, in the UK the DJ is allowed to continue using the tracks copied under a previous licence even after the licence expires, while in Finland the tracks copied under licence must be deleted after expiry. Usually, the songs used do not have to be defined in advance. The songs used must be copied from legitimate sources, and it is not possible to legally play songs illegally downloaded, even if the DJ has a licence. It is not however always required for the DJ to own the original recording, and for example copying music from a CD borrowed from a library may be allowed, but this varies between countries, being for example allowed in Finland but prohibited in the UK. Another common element of the licences is that they are personal and non-transferable, and thus the copies may only be used by the person who originally acquired the licence, and can not be borrowed or rented to a third-party. =Licensing in the UK= In the UK, a licence must be obtained from the Phonographic Performance Limited (PPL), or one of its dubbing operators, and from the Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society (MCPS). In 2006, The PPL created a licence that allowed a DJ to use up to 20,000 songs and keep backup copies of these on a separate hard drive. The licence did not allow the recording of live DJ mixes, or burning music on to a CD. Furthermore, editing or altering of the original recording was not permitted. The PPL licence had to be renewed yearly, and cost ¬£200 plus value added tax (VAT) per year. PPL did not announce how the use of the digital DJ licensing was going to be enforced or supervised, other than by advertising the need for the licence and discouraging venues from hiring unlicensed DJs, under threat of \\"trouble with the law\\". In addition to this, the DJ also needed to acquire a separate licence from the MCPS. In 2008, PPL and MCPS created a joined licence, named ProDub licence, which covers the licensing for both organisations. The new licensing scheme is tiered: tier 1 costing ¬£250 including VAT, and allowing the copying of up to 5,000 songs, up to tier 4 which costs ¬£400 including VAT and allows the copying of up to 20,000 songs. This licensing system differs from the previous one in that it's not a form of leasing, and the songs copied under this licence may be kept indefinitely. Furthermore, if the whole quota is not used, the remaining amount may be transferred to the next year, provided the licence is renewed. This licence also allows a backup to be kept, but does not permit the copying of music on to a CD-R, only allowing copies to hard drives of computers or other digital audio players. Also, it is required for the DJ to own the original media, and copies made from CDs borrowed from a library or another source are not allowed. The licensors keep a database searchable by surname to allow venues and other organisers to verify that their performers comply with the appropriate copyright laws. It should however be noted that DJs playing original CDs and vinyls are legally allowed to do so without any licences on their part, and are not listed in the database. MCPS does not require the licensees to report the songs used, but they are required to keep some form of a record of the copies made, that may be requested by the MCPS to be sent to them and/or allow them to verify the records. This form of licensing is similar to the previous model in the sense that it does not allow live DJ mixes to be recorded. By itself the new licensing model does not allow the copying of karaoke tracks that include on-screen lyrics, but for an additional fee the coverage is extendable to include such tracks. The licence also only allows music to be copied in the UK, and if the music is copied in any other country, the DJ needs to acquire permission from the copyright holders, or acquire a similar licence from that country's copyright organisation(s). Music copied in the UK can however be played in any country within the European Economic Area without the need for additional licences or permissions. =Licensing in Finland= In Finland, a licence must be obtained from both Teosto and Gramex, the Finnish organisations which protect the intellectual properties of composers and performers, respectively. The costs vary based on the amount of digital copies desired. The total cost of both licences combined ranges from approximately ‚Ç¨280 for 1-300 songs to ‚Ç¨600 for up to 3,000 songs, prices including VAT. The licences from both Teosto and Gramex are valid for a year. The Finnish licensing system does not permit backup copies of any kind, and having two copies of any particular song is considered the same as having two different songs; thus, both are deducted from the amount allowed by the license. The licence does not discern between different target mediums, and music may be copied to any format. Usage of the licence is enforced by random inspections by Teosto's inspectors. Punishments for lacking a licence range from warnings to fines and reimbursements to copyright holders. DJs in Finland using the licence are required by Teosto to submit reports of the songs used \\"upon request\\".http://www.djorion.fi/2010/11/teostoa-tapaamassa-osa-2/ Gramex does not require such reports for licences for fewer than 3,000 songs. An alternative to a yearly leasing licence in Finland is to pay a one-time \\"re- mechanisation\\" fee per track, which allows tracks to be copied to CD-R or other such media, and used for as long as the media exists. Backups are not allowed, and should the disc be damaged the fee will have to be paid again if the licensee wishes to use the same tracks again. While this type of licensing is cheaper in the long run for acquiring a large song library, it does not have the flexibility of the leasing system. =Licensing in Canada= In Canada a DJ licence for the reproduction of sound recordings for the purpose of public performance can be obtained from the AVLA Audio-Video Licensing Agency Inc. (AVLA). DJ licences can also be obtained through three national DJ associations, the Canadian Professional Disc Jockey Association Inc. (CPDJA), the Canadian Disc Jockey Association (CDJA), and Canadian Alliance of Professional Entertainers (CAPE). All of these organisations have an agreement with AVLA which permits them to distribute and administer DJ licences to their membership. Both the AVLA and the national DJ associations maintain online databases for consumer confirmation of licensed status. The DJ licence available is a combination CDR and Hard Drive licence which permits DJs to copy and compress sound recordings to a hard drive (MP3) for use as a professional DJ only. The licence permits DJs to prepare CD compilations of AVLA member-label released music for use solely in their DJ business, and not for distribution under any circumstances. In addition, it permits a DJ to have a back-up hard drive prepared and available in the event of a hard drive failure. The agreement stipulates that only original source media can be copied and the media must be owned by the DJ. Music from an MSS or AVLA licensed Music Supply Service (ERG, Multi Music, Promo Only, etc.) CAN NOT be copied. Downloading of music from iTunes and other online services is not permitted except in cases where such downloading service is licensed by the AVLA and approved under the licensing program. The licence does not permit live DJ mixes to be recorded and/or karaoke tracks to be copied. DJs playing original CDs and vinyl recordings are permitted to do so without any licensing requirements under AVLA. This is an annual licence that costs approximately $350.00 (CAD). Copied sound recordings under the licence are not permitted to be used unless the annual licence is renewed. Licences are available through membership in the AVLA licensed national DJ associations at a lower cost and are included in national DJ association membership fees. Compliance with licensing requirements may be monitored through random inspections. Performing Rights in respect of sound recordings and musical works is handled by RE: Sound (on behalf of sound recording makers and performers) and SOCAN the Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada (on behalf of authors and composers). Performing rights are paid by the venue rather than the DJ. Criticism The licensing system has been criticised by DJs as being unfair and overly expensive. The major points of criticism are the double charges for copying music from an original CD to a hard drive (first buying the CD and then paying for the licence to make a copy), and the unintuitive differentiating between downloaded music and music bought on a physical medium, since the reasoning for allowing the latter to be played, but not the former is that digital downloads are only licensed for private use, but this is also the case for most CDs. Why the venue's licence to play music covers the physical mediums but not digital ones is unclear.

IOUF is a member of international educational organizations such as European Distance and E-learning Network (EDEN), European Foundation for Quality in e-Learning (EFQUEL). As a charitable foundation, IOUF is an independent legal entity with a stated mission of serving the public interest through higher education and research. Its status as a not-for-profit organization confers favorable tax status on activities undertaken in pursuit of Foundation goals. History The Intercultural Open University Foundation was established in 1981 by Jan R. Hakemulder. During his tenure as an educational advisor with UNESCO in Africa, Jan and his wife Fay A.C. DeJonge, convened a meeting of Dutch, German and English professors at Bosk House in Opeinde, Netherlands. After this meeting, the group decided to provide distributed educational programs focused on the social subjects to students around the world, the Intercultural Open University Foundation was the result. The Foundation was the subject of controversy when John Bear, a writer on educational institutions, questioned its status. The Foundation also came under attack in 2008 when CIMEA, the Italian Information Centre on Academic Mobility and Equivalence, claimed it had \\"dubious professors with dubious credentials that somehow (connected it) to UNESCO.\\" CIMEA subsequently posted a letter from the Foundation's President, Board of Governors and Faculty protesting the reference. In 2007, Skepsis, a Dutch magazine which aims to debunk pseudoscience, published an article stating that the founders of the Intercultural Open University Foundation held PhD degrees from distance learning institutions. The article also stated that the Foundation awarded degrees in India for about 250 Euros while charging 8000 Euros for students from developed countries as a part of the \\"Robin Hood strategy: what the rich pay too much, is given to the less fortunate.\\" by the Hakemulders. The author stated that he doubted that the professors of the IOUF could legally bear the legally protected Dutch title doctor (dr.). IOUF Founder and President Jan Hakemulder died in August, 2008. After his death, the IOUF Board of Governors appointed Sandra Hurlong as the interim President of the Foundation. From the estate of Jan Hakemulder, an endowment was established to fund the institution. In August 2009, the IOUF announced Dr. Hurlong as the appointed President. Under her direction, the Foundation shifted its focus to graduate dual degrees programs exclusively. In October 2011, IOUF signed an academic co-operation agreement with the Universidad Azteca (UAzteca). According to the agreement upon successful completion of the program, IOUF PhD students will be awarded an international double degree offered jointly by the Universidad Azteca and its partner, the Universidad Central de Nicaragua (UCN).

Sittler became a teacher at Chicago Lutheran Theological Seminary in the early 1940s. He was a professor of theology at the University of Chicago from 1957 to 1973. He was widely credited with pioneering the links between Christian theology and ecological thought, including the need to return to a cosmic Christology, having written about environmental matters as early as the 1950s (long before they were widely reported in the mainstream press). He continually insisted that care for the earth and its environment is a central concern of the Christian religion.Cf. the article \\"A Theology for Earth\\" in Evocations of Grace: Writings on Ecology, Theology, and Ethics, ed. Peter Bakken and Steven Bouma-Prediger (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2000).

The Power Shift '09 Conference was the largest gathering of young people to solve the climate crisis in history. Meeting with key strategic members in Congress, these young activists were told that they (congress) was ready to start promoting the essential legislation to achieve the just energy future we all deserve, but they needed a force (they specifically asked for an \\"army\\") on the ground spreading the word and gaining support.

In October 2008, a Chinese retailer expressed an interest in purchasing a 50% stake in the chain. However, whilst negotiations were made, the company was hit badly by the downturn in the Global and British economy in the last quarter of 2008.

Lying some east of Virgin and just southwest of Zion National Park, Duncan's Retreat was inhabited about 1861-1895. History Chapman Duncan came here in 1861, settling with a few others on Mukuntuweap Creek, a small tributary of the Virgin River. The colony was part of a southern Utah cotton-growing project ordered by Brigham Young (see Utah's Dixie). That winter the Virgin River, unpredictable at even the best of times, experienced the Great Flood of 1862, which destroyed most of the settlement along with such other nearby towns as Grafton. Chapman Duncan and most of the other original settlers fled in early 1862 in search of a more stable home, and the families who stayed behind named their village Duncan's Retreat. A local legend claims that Duncan's real reason for retreating was a botched surveying job. Duncan, so the story goes, was assigned to survey a canal to bring water from the Virgin River, but when it was dug, the canal was found to be useless as its route ran uphill. Another version of the story says it happened in Virgin, and that Duncan retreated to Duncan's Retreat. More settlers took the place of the departing pioneers, and by the end of 1862 Duncan's Retreat had a population of about 70. They planted crops and orchards, producing large harvests in the years the river did not flood. Cotton, corn, wheat, and sorghum grew particularly well. A post office was established here in 1863, and a schoolhouse in 1864. In 1866, when the Black Hawk War caused widespread fear of Indian attacks, the town was evacuated to Virgin, although farmers returned to Duncan's Retreat each day to work their fields. Residents moved back permanently in 1868. Farming in Duncan's Retreat was a difficult life. The fertile land yielded bumper crops in good years, but could be washed away by torrential floods at any time. Of the 11 families living here in 1870, 9 remained in 1880. The next decade was much harsher; by 1891 Duncan's Retreat was all but deserted. The last known birth in town was in 1895. All that remains of Duncan's Retreat is some dead fruit trees, an irrigation ditch, and a few graves on the north side of Utah State Route 9 between Virgin and Grafton.

Early years Dale was born in Beaufort, South Carolina. She attended Leland and Gray Seminary in Townshend, Vermont. In Berlin, Germany, she studied music and enjoyed a successful career as a singer of lieder on the concert stage. Her singing career included appearances with the New York Philharmonic and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. At one point, Dale was head of Smith College's vocal department.  Stage  In America, Dale transferred to the acting stage and cultivated a career as an actress in Summer stock. She starred in Carrie Nation on Broadway in 1933. Her other Broadway credits include Harvest of Years (1947), And Be My Love (1944), and Another Language (1932).  Film  Dale's first film was Crime Without Passion (1934) in an uncredited role. She was a familiar face in films of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, frequently playing stern, authoritarian characters such as prison matrons and head nurses, although she was equally adept at playing grande dames and ladies of the upper class. She played Birdie Hicks in the Ma and Pa Kettle films The Egg and I (1947), Ma and Pa Kettle (1949), Ma and Pa Kettle at the Fair (1952), and Ma and Pa Kettle at Waikiki (1955).  Television  Dale played many roles in television over the years.

(born December 17, 1923) is a pioneering Canadian aviation artist, instrumental in the founding of the Canada Aviation Museum. Biography Born December 17, 1923 in York Township, Ontario, Robert William Bradford and his twin brother, James, enlisted together in the Royal Canadian Air Force when they were 18. Bradford trained on the de Havilland Tiger Moth and Avro Anson, but he never saw operational duties. He was injured in a crash while waiting assignment, which required several months of hospitalization. After the war, Bradford became an aviation illustrator first for A. V. Roe Canada Limited in 1949 and then, in 1953, for de Havilland Aircraft of Canada. While serving as Chief Illustrator for de Havilland, in 1961, Bradford drew the attention of Ken Molson, curator of the recently formed Canada Aviation Museum. Molson commissioned Bradford to produce a series of historical aviation pieces. Bradford produced eighteen images depicting historically significant aircraft and events, and, in 1966, was hired as the museum's Assistant Curator. Eventually, Bradford succeeded Molson to the curator position. At this time in the museum's history, the collection was housed in World War II-era hangars at Rockcliffe. In 1978, Bradford began collaborating with the new National Air Museum Society (Friends of the National Aviation Museum) to secure a new facility from the Federal Government. This was a project that continued over the next several years, as Bradford served in 1982 as Director of the National Museum of Science and Technology, the Aviation Museum's parent and returned in 1984 to the National Aviation Museum as Associate Director. Their efforts paid off, and the new facility opened at Ottawa's Rockcliffe Airport in 1988. That same year, Bradford was named Patron of the Canadian Aviation Historical Society. In 1989, the collection secure, Bradford retired from the Museum, but continued his career as a painter. Legacy and honours In addition to murals for the Museum, Bradford also produced sixteen Canadian postage stamps featuring historic aircraft as well as accepting commissions commemorating such events as the 50th anniversary of Alcock and Brown's trans-Atlantic flight, the first winner of the McKee Trophy \\"Doc\\" Oaks, and Billy Bishop's Victoria Cross winning aerial action. For his artistic achievements, in 1974 he became the first Canadian artist to receive the American Aviation Historical Society's Aviation Award. In 1982, he received the Paul Tissandier Diploma from the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale for his curatorial and artistic accomplishments. In 1989, he became a Member of the Order of Canada, and in 1996 he was inducted into Canada‚Äôs Aviation Hall of Fame.

Geography  The comarca is located at the southwest of the Zamora province. The main geographical characteristic is the isolation caused by the Duero and Tormes rivers canyons. Its borders are, consequently, well defined, specially to the north (Duero canyon separates Sayago from Aliste comarca), to the west (Duero canyon separates Sayago from Portugal) and to the south (Tormes canyon and Almendra Dam separate Sayago from the province of Salamanca). East is the less marked border, which makes communications easy with Tierra del Pan and Zamora, the capital city of the province. Duero canyons are especially deep in the stretch shared with Portugal, as the erosion found better conditions to act than in previous zones. That has been the cause for the relatively low relations between the comarca and Portugal. The canyons have been used to build some reservoirs along the river in its journey through the comarca: San Rom√°n Dam, Villalcampo Dam, Castro Dam, Miranda Dam, Picota Dam and Bemposta Dam (the last three owned by Portugal), apart from the mentioned Almendra Dam. They all are for electricity production, making Sayago one of the most important hydroelectric areas in the whole country. It's not only the canyons which define the landscape of Sayago. The highlands, where towns are located, form an extense peneplain with successions of hills and valleys caused by streams that join the Duero and Tormes rivers. Geologically, the most common terrain is composed by low-quality ground and many granite outcrops, with few areas of fertile floor around the streams. The high value of this ecosystem has been recognised when in 2002 the Arribes del Duero Natural Park was declared. The Spanish ‚Äî or more specifically, Sayaguese ‚Äî word arribes refers to the Duero and Tormes canyons. This area is the home for many endangered bird species such as black stork and is known for a well-preservation of the native flora. Holm oak, common oak, juniper, broom or thyme are some of the species that dominates the flora scenario in Sayago.  History  Human presence is dated since the Prehistory, with examples like the stone boar in Villardiegua de la Ribera, few dolmens or other yacimients in municipalities such as Pe√±ausende or Almeida de Sayago. But the first human settlement which left any kind of cultural presence was Vettones, a pre-Roman Celtic people, strongly influenced by the Central European cultures. The Roman Empire also made its mark in the comarca, with the foundation of some towns (an example is Fermoselle) and a net of Roman roads across the area, joining the towns and communicating them with the closest important cities. One of the main Roman roads in the Iberian peninsula, V√≠a de la Plata, touches the east of the comarca,and helped the trading and the husbandry. Roman steles can be seen in some houses as they have been used as stones in the walls. Viriathus was the leader of the Lusitanian people during the resistance to the Roman expansion and was born in a Sayago's hamlet belonging to Bermillo de Sayago, Torrefrades. During the Visigothic Kingdom in Spain, an own kingdom, called Sabaria, existed in the zone, but it was soon conquered by the Visigoths in the 6th century. Middle age passes by without any relevance and the isolation of Sayago begin to left a deep mark in the character of the comarca. The Umayyad conquest of Hispania did not leave any remarkable architecture or tradition in Sayago. In contrast, the Catholic Church dominate the life of the Sayaguese people over the High Middle Ages, submitting the towns to a strict regime where peasants had to pay the tithe from what they collect in their respective farms and give it to the local Church. There is a worrying lack of documents about all the period between 14th century and 18th century. Only few inscriptions about the building of hermitages, cemeteries, and other religious points remained in archives. Unfortunately, it was necessary to wait for a bad date, the Peninsular War between Spain and the Napoleonic France to have any kind of news about the comarca. In its way to Portugal, the Grande Arm√©e went through Sayago leaving awful memories in the Sayaguese people. Spanish civil war also struck the county, with dozens of people killed because of their political sympathies. From then to now, Sayago has experimented phenomena like the rural exodus, or the 20th century diaspora that has led its population to decrease markedly. First it was attributed to the industrialization of Spanish cities, and now the lack of opportunities for young people is what makes them to move to urban areas. Isolation plays a crucial role in this situation. This could be attenuated by new initiatives like rural tourism or high-quality husbandry and agriculture. Map showing the incidence of emigration in 1910. Zamora province was an important emission point.  Sayaguese dialect  Sayaguese dialect (in Spanish usually named Habla sayaguesa) is a local variant of Leonese language, an old vernacule Romance language used in the ancient Kingdom of Leon, and nowadays survives in some areas of Le√≥n, Zamora and Bragan√ßa (Portugal). It is really similar to Asturian language. It's often characterized as a rustic way of expression, remarked by the Sayaguese people themselves because the historical isolation that affects the comarca. Indeed, during 16th and 17th centuries some Spanish authors (Lucas Fern√°ndez, S√°nchez Badajoz,...) included the term \\"Sayaguese\\" to imprint rurality and coarseness to his characters. This use strongly distort the real nature of the dialect, adding some features or words that are not present in Sayago. The main characteristics that define the dialect are the following ones: * Conservation of the Latin /f/ instead of the /h/ used in Spanish (facer and not hacer) * Double /l/ (llucha instead of lucha) * Conservation of an ending vocal, specially /e/ (sede instead of sed)  Economy  The geography has played an important role in the characteristics of the county's economy. Because of its isolation, only saved by the ‚ÄúPuente Pino‚Äù (bridge linking with Aliste county through the canyon) and the two reservoirs of Miranda and Bemposta, that link by road Sayago with Portugal, the development possibilities had been so weak. Farming has been an important activity, but the landscape (specially the common granite outcrops) set important difficulties to concentrate the lands of each owner in one (technique called Flurbereinigung), reducing the opportunities to be competitive in agriculture. The dispersion of the properties has to be found in the inheritance methods, dividing the plots between the heirs of each owner. As the population has decreased and young people expect going to cities and don‚Äôt want to be farmers, the purpose was abandoned during the last years. This conditions make difficult the development of agriculture, so these kind of land uses have not go far from subsistence agriculture. Market gardens are supported by the local inhabitants to provide themselves of fresh vegetables and fruits. Husbandry is easier to handle in this landscape context, specially cattle and sheep farming. Cheese, milk and meat are elaborated in some villages by the farmers. Indeed, Sayaguese veal is considered as a great meat alongside Alistane veal. In the recent years, pork farming has become an incipient activity that could be interesting, as the vegetation of the zone is really similar to the main pork Spanish areas that produce the so famous Jam√≥n ib√©rico or Iberian ham. Domestic life keeps lots of characteristics from the subsistence economy, as happens in the majority of the rural areas of Spain. In Sayago this is even a stronger phenomenon than in other counties, again because the geographical isolation that historically delays every forward from the urban areas. For example, running water is a relatively new service, there‚Äôs no gas pipelines supplying the area (people have to use electrical heaters) or the Internet has been really difficult to introduce. It‚Äôs also common not to have mobile coverage except in some elevated areas. Under these conditions, it‚Äôs really hard to be an entrepreneur. Despite of this, a lot of rural tourism accommodations have been established in the recent years, taking advantage of the stretch of that kind of tourism. Sayago offers a really nice landscape that it‚Äôs really appreciate by the urban people, consolidated after the declaration of the Arribes del Duero Natural Park, a natural reserve that protects the Duero river canyons. Alongside these accommodations, few restaurants, traditional food or craft shops have opened. This has relieved a little bit the important problem of depopulation.

Pritchard was born in Fulham, South West London. His father, John William Pritchard, was a Detective Chief Superintendent and who made his career as an investigating officer on the Great Train Robbery in 1963. He attended Halford Road Primary school, Fulham, St Clement Danes Grammar School, Ducane Road, Hammersmith from 1969‚Äì1975 and Robinson College, Cambridge from 1983 to 1986, where he read law. Whilst at Cambridge, he was President of the Hawks' Club, succeeding Rob Andrew, the England Rugby player. In 1980 he was a crew member of the British eight which won the Olympic silver medal. In 1981, he won a silver medal at the World Rowing Championships in Munich. He finished fifth with the British eight in the 1984 Olympics. He coached the Oxford University Boat Club in 1980 and 1981, and the Cambridge University Boat Club in 1982 and 1983. He rowed in The Boat Race three times for Cambridge against Oxford. In the 1984 race, the crew in which he rowed famously hit a barge moored above Putney Bridge resulting in the much-broadcast image of a sinking boat. The win in the 1986 race was the only Cambridge win in a run of 17 wins for Oxford. By winning in 1986, Cambridge denied Oxford winning the Ladbrokes trophy outright, having won for the previous nine years. Pritchard founded and runs an executive search business, Piper Pritchard Associates, in London. He was a director of the British Olympic Association and is Chairman of Right To Play, an international charity which supports children in war-torn and deprived parts of the world through sport. He is Chairman of the Hawks' Club. He is also chairman of the steering committee and deputy chairman of the alumni advisory board of Cambridge University. In 2014, he rowed the length of the Mississippi river in a traditional Thames racing skiff. The 2,320 mile journey took three months and raised over $1,000,000 for Right to Play.

It was a former industrial area that is being transformed into a business center, urban neighborhood, entertainment district and waterfront destination. The project involves adding over 9,000 new apartments, condominiums and lofts, modern office towers, 1,200 hotel rooms, one million square feet of retail amenities including a two future grocery stores, new restaurants, shops, and cafes. Over 33,900,000 square feet (3,150,000 m2) of new office, residential, hotel and retail space as well as four new parks are planned over the next 10‚Äì15 years. The new riverfront Yards Park opened in fall 2010. The BID is governed by a Board of Directors composed of twenty property and business owners and seven non-voting community stakeholders.http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2007/12/03/daily29.html?ana=e_du retrieved 29 January 2009 The BID's FY2009 budget is approximately $1.5 million and is funded by an assessment that applies to commercial property (including land and parking lots), residences of ten or more units, and hotels.  Transportation  The Capitol Riverfront is served by the Navy Yard ‚Äì Ballpark and Capitol South stations on the Washington Metro system. The neighborhood is also served by I-395 and I-295 and by a circulator bus route to Union Station, and it is a 10-minute taxi ride to Reagan National Airport. A riverwalk provides a path for people to walk, run, or bike on along the banks of the Anacostia River. Sections of the trail currently exist to the eleventh street bridge and behind the Washington Navy Yard. Upon completion of Yards park in 2010, the Navy opened the riverwalk trail behind the Navy Yard to the public.  History  Key points in the history of the Capitol Riverfront include: * The Anacostia Waterfront Initiative adopted by Mayor Anthony A. Williams and the District Council in 2003 to advanced the river's clean-up and identified opportunities to increase access to the river and target new areas for development. * The consolidation of Naval Sea Systems Command headquarters operations at the Navy Yard campus. * Location of the U.S. Department of Transportation headquarters, which opened in 2007. * The location of Nationals Park (opened 2008), the home of the Washington Nationals baseball team. Historically, the Anacostia River, along the banks of the Capitol Riverfront, was once a deep water channel, burgeoning with natural resources and home to the Nacotchtank Indians. In 1791, L‚ÄôEnfant designed the plan for Washington D.C. and, recognizing the assets of the Anacostia River, located the city's new commercial center and wharfs there. In 1799, the Washington Navy Yard was established in the area and for several decades was the nation's largest naval shipbuilding facility. Today, the Washington Navy Yard is the Navy's longest continuously operated Federal facility. The Navy Yard was a bustling nautical center during the 19th Century and played an integral role in the development of the area. The lively wharf was a hub for jobs, serving ships with lumber and raw materials for the growing city. It also played a key role in defending the city from British invasion in 1812. Surrounding the wharfs was an extensive commercial district, light industrial businesses, and one of the city's most significant neighborhood communities. As the city and nation evolved, the Navy Yard changed from ship building to production of finished ship products and weapons ammunition. By the mid-1940s the Navy Yard and the expanded Annex area reached peak production with 26,000 employees in 132 buildings on of land. During the last century of the city's growth, however, the River had deteriorated. The pollution of the river diminished its value as an asset to the city. After WWII, the Navy Yard consolidated its operations to a smaller campus, which slowed the economic and neighborhood activity of the area. Around this same time, the elevated portion of the Southeast-Southwest Freeway was completed, creating a physical barrier for access to the River. The combination of these and several other factors led to the river and the riverfront neighborhoods becoming neglected.

Pooling their resources in this way allowed them to compete with the larger distribution operations of the major record labels, and also to gain access to the larger shop chains. The association of regional distributors included some of the most notable labels of the 1980s UK post- punk and indie scene: Rough Trade, Backs, Fast Forward, Nine Mile, Probe, Revolver and Red Rhino.  Indie labels and distribution  The 1980s music scene in the UK saw a growth in small independent record labels or \\"indies\\", often formed by bands themselves, or by local record shops. The cost of technology and studio time was falling, making it possible to produce an album for a budget that didn't need the backing of an established label. Recording, publishing and pressing a record was now accessible to small labels, but distributing them into the shops was still difficult. The market at this time was based on vinyl, both albums and singles being important. Most record shops were still independent, i.e. local, rather than national chains. This required a wholesale distribution network that had national reach to these individual shops. Regional distributors appeared, offering pressing and distribution deals to the small labels that would reach all of the shops in a region. Shops preferred to deal with only a handful of distributors and so the small distributors agreed to also distribute each other's stock, segregating the market by the geography of the shops, rather than by the content or particular labels. This was the beginning of the idea behind the Cartel.  Richard Scott and Tony K  : Disputed: see talk: The architect of the Cartel was Richard Scott of London's Rough Trade. Tony Kostrzewa (always known as \\"Tony K\\") of York's Red Rhino label. Tony K, who had a long career in music retail and publishing had started Red Rhino as a record shop in 1977, then made its first release as a label in 1979. By this time Rough Trade were already operating as a distributor which included supplying Red Rhino's shop. The Cartel regional distribution structure included Backs (Norwich), Fast Forward (Edinburgh), Nine Mile (Leamington Spa), Probe (Liverpool), Revolver (Bristol), Red Rhino (York) and Rough Trade (London), together with Jungle Records (London) who supplied the nationwide Our Price Records chain until 1986. By 1984 the Cartel had enough success with bands like Joy Division, Depeche Mode, Cocteau Twins, Pigbag, The Smiths, Vice Squad and many others to move to a large warehouse in Kings Cross, London. This was the peak of the Cartel's influence. Not only were they an effective distributor, but they were having an influence on the music itself, and the rise of \\"indie\\". As more of the mainstream retailers began to take product from the Cartel, this gave more exposure to independent labels' releases through these high-street shops. As many of them were the same shops who returned sales figures to the chart pollsters, indie releases featured more highly in the charts.  Demise of the Cartel  Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty of The KLF described the Cartel thus, \\"The Cartel is, as the name implies, a group of independent distributors across the country who work in conjunction with each other providing a solid network of distribution without stepping on each other's toes. We are distributed by the Cartel.\\" By the time this was published though, the Cartel had already collapsed. At the end of 1988, Red Rhino Distribution Ltd. folded, going into voluntary liquidation in 1989, followed by Fast Forward in early 1990 and Rough Trade in 1991.

It means the same in the Albanian literature, firstly muslim poets, that engaged in beit poetry. This genre of literature created in Albania in the 18th century that prevailed in different cities of what is now Albania, Kosovo, Chameria as well as in religious centers. The spread of Bejtexhinj was a product of two different significant factors. There was a demand in religious practices to write in Albanian and to free it from foreign influence. The other factor was the accretion of ideological pressure from Turkish rulers. The ruling Ottomans sought the submission of Albanians through the Muslim religion and culture. Albania rulers opened their own schools with many Bejtexhinj poets in attendance. History The Bejtexhinj wrote Albanian in the Elifba alphabet, an adaption of the Ottoman Turkish alphabet, often with heavy influence from Ottoman Turkish in the form of loanwords. Bejte literature had two development phases. The first lasted until the end of the 18th century and was characterized by secular themes. The second phase, from the end of the 18th century and through the 19th century, had a predominantly religious character. Of the secular works, many Bejtexhinj wrote about the positive values of love, natural and feminine beauty, virtues, works, knowledge and also alluded to the negative traits of ambition and hypocrisy. Bejtexhinj who worked in this vein were Nezim Frakulla, Sulejman Naibi and Muhamet Ky√ßyku. A further step in the literature was initiated when other Bejexhinj such as Hasan Zyko Kamberi and Zenel Bastari reflected on the events of the time, describing the hard lives of the poor, the insecurities of the future, and their discontent at the conditions of feudalism. The literature of the Bejtexhinj did not achieve national prestige on its own, but the poets provided a valuable addition to Albanian literature. They wrote in Albanian, for example, at a time when it was banned by the ruling Ottomans. Aside from its religious themes, Bejte literature was the first to widely utilize secular themes. Some authors of this type were closer to the people and included in their poems elements of daily life, using realistic social themes with a strong critical sensibility. Importance With Bejtexhinj works, Albanian poetry made another step artistically, being composed of expressions and imagery that are truly artistic in value. Bejtexhinj authors also blended Albania's traditional poetry, mainly the eight-line poems that all poets used. Their works were spread through written copies or verbally. The number of poets that this era produced is considerably large coming from cities such as Berat, Elbasan, Shkod√´r, Gjakova, Pristina, and smaller towns as Kolonj√´, Frash√´r, and Konispol. The flow of Bejtexhinj literature lost its influence at the beginning of the 19th century, but in some places like Kosovo, this tradition lasted even longer from authors such as Maliq Rakoveci and Rexhep Voka.

The American Library Association named Savvy a 2009 Newbery Honor Book. Before Mibs turns thirteen her Poppa gets into a terrible accident. Eager to save him, Mibs sneaks on a bus with her siblings and the preacher's kids. But when the bus starts heading the wrong direction, it will take new friends, savvy's and a whole lot of growing up for Mibs to truly save Poppa. Summary Two days before turning thirteen, Mibs conjures up ideas of what her new savvy could be. But when her Momma receives a call saying that her Poppa got into a car accident, Momma and Rocket go to Salina to visit him, leaving Mibs, her siblings, and Grandpa by themselves. The next day, Mibs boards the bus with her younger brother Samson, where she gets bullied and made fun of. After a dreadful last day of school, Mibs arrives home with an unexpected visit from Miss Rosemary and her children, Bobbi and Will Junior. Miss Rosemary later decides to throw Mibs a birthday party, not knowing that she could threaten the secrets the Beaumonts want to keep secret. The next morning, after waking up, Mibs notices Gypsy awaken from a deep slumber. Even Samson's pet turtle, who everyone had presumed dead, wakes up from his hibernation when Mibs passes it. This gives Mibs an idea for her unknown savvy. Wearing the special outfit her Poppa picked out for her, Mibs attends her party and runs into Bobbi, whose tattoo of an angel talks to her. Passing out from the encounter, Mibs awakens to find everyone arguing, and leaves to find a way to Salina. Sneaking onto a pink bus delivering bibles, she is soon accompanied by Fish, Will Junior, and Bobbi. She discovers Samson hiding behind the bus already. But when the bus starts heading the wrong direction, Mibs gives off her location. After talking to Lester, the bus driver, he agrees to take them to Salina once he finishes his deliveries. Along the way, they pick up a woman named Lill, who works as a waitress. When they arrive at the diner she works at, she gives them some food, while Mibs explains to Fish that she has finally realized her actual savvy: the ability to read minds through ink. Unfortunately, Bobbi overhears them and tells Will Junior. Meanwhile, Ozzie, Lills boss, fires Lill. After causing a ruckus, the group heads back to the bus, where Fish finally learns to scumble his savvy. Lill eventually learns the kids ran away and uses her last paycheck to buy rooms at a hotel for them. Tricking Lill into believing their parents know their whereabouts, they hide the missing-person reports they've seen of themselves. The next day, Lester drives to Carlene's house to pay her back for the bibles. When Samson gets left behind, Mibs uses her savvy to find him, but not before the police arrive. Comprehending their story, Officer Bill Meeks, decides to allow his son and his friends to go to Salina with them. Lester drives the group to the hospital where Miss Rosemary, Pastor Meeks, and the rest of Mibs's family await them. While the Meekses are forced to leave, Mibs and her family enter her Poppa's room. She discovers him in a comalike state, but using her savvy, Mibs is able to awaken him by speaking to him through his tattoo. A year later, Rocket has decided to move to his Uncle Aunty's ranch to learn to scumble his savvy. Also, Fish has mastered his savvy well enough to start high school in the fall. But Mibs decides to stay home-schooled for a year or two, to give her enough time to truly master her savvy. After overhearing her Momma's thoughts of a new Beaumont heading on its way, Mibs decides that she is happy because things are perfect and quiet, and they will stay that way... at least until Samson turns thirteen. Characters * Mississippi \\"Mibs\\" Beaumont ‚Äì The thirteen-year-old main protagonist.

Critical reception Kirkus Reviews awarded Savvy a starred review, praising Law's \\"fertile imagination\\" and \\"dab hand for likable, colorful characters\\". Susan Faust of the San Francisco Chronicle called the storytelling \\"magical\\" but noted that some of the adventures were improbable. The website Kidsreads called it \\"fun, hilarious, relatable and enduring\\". In addition to the 2009 Newbery Honor, Savvy was named the second runner up in the 2011 Indian Paintbrush Book Award. Scumble The sequel to Savvy, Scumble, was released in August 2010. The plot follows a cousin of Mibs', Ledger Kale, whose savvy is to break anything, and also takes place ten years afterward. His parents decide to leave Ledge and his sister Fedora (Fe) in Wyoming for the summer, along with cousins Samson and Gypsy Beaumont and Marisol and Mesquite O'Connell (Autry's daughters, who levitate objects), so Ledge can learn to scumble his savvy before he returns home to Indiana. Sarah Jane keeps finding him and disturbing him, as she wants to know more about The Flying Cattleheart, Uncle Autry's bug ranch (Autry can control bugs). As her father keeps finding Ledge and his daughter talking, he grows angrier and eventually decides to foreclose and destroy the ranch. Throughout, Ledge and SJ begin to fall in love, and Ledge starts going to an auto repair woman named Winona, who uses spare parts for sculptures, which Ledge begins to do using his savvy. Winona meets Rocket, and the two evidently begin a relationship, which is a release for Rocket, who withdrew into himself after accidentally electrocuting but not killing Bobbi Meeks, who was in the first book. Eventually, Uncle Autry reveals the truth about the Cabots: SJ's mother was the last in a savvy family and was best friends with Autry; she had the ability to grow trees abnormally quickly and turn other objects into trees. She and Noble Cabot got married where Fish and his bride Mellie did, out at the ranch. A few years after SJ was born, Summer Cabot became deathly ill, and in an act that grieved and enraged her husband, transformed herself into a tree before she could die. Noble hated Autry after that and shielded SJ from the world of savvies. However, Sarah Jane has now come into her own savvy, to make anyone believe something she has written. Switch The sequel to \\"Savvy\\" and \\"Scumble\\", Switch was released in September 2015. The plot follows Mibs' sister Gypsy who originally has the savvy to see the past and future, which inexplicably becomes the ability to stop time, and takes place a few months after Ledge's adventure.

It was based on the novel by Marc Dugain, which in turn was based on the experiences of one of the author's own ancestors during World War I. The film received nine nominations at the 27th C√©sar Awards, winning Best Supporting Actor for Andr√© Dussollier and Best Cinematography for Tetsuo Nagata. Plot The film concentrates more on the period spent in hospital than the novel, and emphasizes the horror of the friends' injuries. On Adrien's arrival at the ward, all the mirrors are removed and staff are instructed not to give him one, but we see from the faces of others how bad the damage is. Adrien becomes increasingly desperate to see the damage done to his face, even asking a visitor to draw him. Dupeyron ensures that we do not see the horrifying extent of Adrien's injuries until he does - by seeing his reflection in a window. There is a focus on the fleeting romance between Adrien and Cl√©mence, whom he met by chance shortly before the war, and his attempts to find her. When he finally does, she fails to recognise him. Whereas the novel follows the experiences of the group right up to World War II and beyond, the film ends just after the First World War, the final scene being Adrien's chance meeting with his future wife.

There are a number of versions extant, some associated with the Ashkenazic tradition, some with the Sephardic, and some with the Mizrahi Jews tradition.Macy Nulman, The Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer (1993, NJ: Jason Aronson) page 266; Malichi Beit-Arie, PEREK SHIRAH, Encyclopedia Judaica (2nd ed. 2007) vol. 15, page 760. An example is that one version has the mouse and the cat alternate with two verses each, another version separates them and gives each only one verse. It was first printed, with a commentary, in Moses ben Joseph de Trani's Bet Elohim (1576), but it is mentioned as early as the 10th century.Macy Nulman, The Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer (1993, NJ: Jason Aronson) page 266; ; Malichi Beit-Arie, PEREK SHIRAH, Encyclopedia Judaica (2nd ed. 2007) vol. 15, page 760. It contains 85 sections, in each of which elements of creation, beginning with the celestial and ending with dogs, use biblical and rabbinic verses in order to sing God's praises. Use of Perek Shirah used to be prevalent in the daily liturgy and medieval philosopher Joseph Albo wrote that whoever recites Perek Shirah is guaranteed a place in the World to Come. Content Though Perek Shirah means \\"Chapter of Song\\", the book is actually organized into six chapters. Some of the utilized verses make mention of the speaker. For example, the song begins with the heavens who say, \\"the heavens speak of the glory of God, and of His handiwork the skies tell.\\" () Others describe some characteristic or activity of the speaker, e.g., the book ends with the dogs who say \\"come, let us prostrate and bend our knees, and kneel before God our maker\\" (). The vast majority of the verses of Perek Shirah are biblical, and most of these are from the book of Psalms, but there are also a few verses from the Babylonian Talmud, at least one from Kabbalistic literature, and a very few whose source is unknown.; see, e.g., the source citations in Rabbi Nosson Scherman, Perek Shirah: The Song of the Universe (2005, Brooklyn, Mesorah Publications), and in Rabbi Natan Slifkin, Perek Shirah: Nature's Song (2nd ed., 2009, Zoo Torah). The dove's second verse, the frog's verse, and the verse of the wild beasts of the field, are from the Talmud. The rooster's first verse is from the Zohar. A very few verses (such as the mouse's) cannot be identified. Some of the birds and animals listed are difficult to identify.A particular example is a winged creature called the retzifi, whose song is the verse of ; the word does not appear in the Bible or Talmud. Slifkin's first edition (2001) identified this (as had many previous commentators) as the bat (although the Hebrew Bible uses the word atalayf _for the bat), and was followed in this by Scherman, but in his 2009 second edition, Slifkin had revised this to the laughing dove. It appears that all the creatures named are found in the Holy Land, the only exceptions perhaps being the elephant (whose song is ) - but elephants were brought into the Holy Land by foreign armies, as mentioned, for example, in the First Book of Maccabees; and the leviathan (whose song is ), presumably a mythic sea beast mentioned in the Bible. In modern times, Perek Shirah does not often appear liturgically. However, there are many publishers who publish Perek Shirah as a separate entity, anywhere from a wallet-sized booklet to full-sized coffee table books complete with pictures illustrating each of the characters speaking to God.

He wrote several books related to war, particularly the Korean War, in which he served as a United States Marine Corps officer. Biography=Early years and military service= Brady was born in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. His career in journalism started working as a copy boy for the Daily News, where he worked while attending Manhattan College. He graduated in 1950.http://www.jasperjottings.com/2009/jasperjottings2009W05.html#mozTocId84386 He left the paper to serve in the United States Marine Corps during the Korean War. During the war, he was a member of the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines first leading a rifle platoon and later acting as an executive officer of a rifle company at one point serving under John Chafee. The majority of his service took place in the North Korean Taebaek Mountains during the fall and bitterly cold winter of 1951 and 1952. During this time he was also promoted to First Lieutenant. Brady was awarded the Bronze Star with the Combat V (recognizing an award resulting from combat heroism) in November 2001 for his actions on May 31, 1952 in a firefight with Chinese forces near Panmunjom. =Writing career= Brady wrote extensively about his experiences as a Marine in Korea, including his 1990 autobiography, The Coldest War, which was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. Other books include the 2003 novel The Marine, as well as the non-fiction books The Scariest Place in the World published in 2005 and the 2007 book Why Marines Fight. Over the years, Brady spoke to groups of veterans about what he described as a \\"forgotten war\\", one where he went to Korea as an immature 23-year-old, and \\"Nine months later when I left, I was a grown-up and a pretty good Marine officer.\\" Hero of the Pacific: The Life of Legendary Marine John Basilone, about a Marine who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions at the Battle of Guadalcanal, was completed days before Brady's death. Brady also wrote novels about the fashion and media worlds that provided an insider's insights, including Paris One, Designs and The Press Lord. Beginning in 1956, Brady worked for Fairchild Publications, first as a business reporter covering Capital Hill, then as Women's Wear Daily's London bureau chief (‚Äô58-‚Äô60), Paris bureau chief (‚Äô60-‚Äò62), European director (‚Äô62-‚Äô64) and, once back in New York, editorial director and publisher. As WWD‚Äôs publisher, he recrafted the publication to reach out to both the clothing industry and the general public, and created the spin-off W, a fashion magazine aimed at the consumer. He was named editor and publisher of Harper's Bazaar in 1971, where his efforts to modernize the title and aim the publication at a younger audience led to his early termination. His experiences in fashion publishing provided input for his 1974 book Superchic about the industry, described in a review by Jeannette Smyth in The Washington Post as \\"his revenge on the fashion world, a way to settle scores with two former employers\\".Smyth, Jeannette. \\"Of Gossip Past and 'Superchic'\\", The Washington Post, November 27, 1974. Accessed January 29, 2009. Clay Felker, publisher of New York magazine, hired Brady to create the Intelligencer column. Brady, who became editor-in-chief after Felker, wrote and hosted a spinoff TV talk show New York: Live, which became the first cable show nominated for and to win several Emmy awards, including one for Brady personally. Rupert Murdoch hired Brady in 1974 to serve as editor of his new weekly tabloid Star, a magazine specializing in celebrity gossip and scandals. Murdoch shifted Brady to the New York Post after he bought the paper in 1976, where Brady was a major participant in the creation of Page Six, a celebrity news and gossip column, giving the column its name and serving as the column's first editor. Brady added to his workload with an Advertising Age column that he penned for more than 25 years, beginning in 1977; and another regular column in Crain's New York Business when that publication was created in 1984. He wrote the In Step With celebrity profile column in Parade starting in 1986 and continuing until his death.

Early years D'Angeac was born in the French colony of Plaisance (present- day Placentia, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada). He was the son of Gabriel d‚ÄôAngeac (born Saintonge; died 1737, √éle Royale, now Cape Breton Island), a military man stationed at the time with Joseph de St. Ovide, Monbeton de Brouillan's company in Plaisance. His mother was Marguerite Bertrand. In 1714, his father and the garrison were reassigned to Louisbourg where, five years later, France began construction of a fortified town. At the age of eight, D'Angeac began his military career as a guard at Port-Dauphin, Nova Scotia (now Englishtown) on √éle Royale. Then, in 1723, D'Angeac was given the rank of second ensign and assigned to his father's company at Louisbourg. Career During the periods of 1738-1741 and 1743-1745, D'Angeac was a lieutenant and sometimes served as commandant at Port-Dauphin. D'Angeac helped defend Louisbourg during the 1745 siege of Louisbourg by New England forces, but after the defeat, he left for France where he recruited troops for colonial companies. He was promoted to captain in 1747, and accompanied √éle Royale's garrison to Quebec before returning to Louisbourg in 1749 upon its reoccupation by France. From 1751 to 1758, he served as commandant of Port- Dauphin supervising outpost reconstruction. He was awarded the Cross of the Order of Saint-Louis in 1754 (his father had received it in 1724). D'Angeac sustained a chest wound during the 1758 siege of Louisbourg. In 1760, Captain D‚ÄôAngeac was placed in command of French reinforcement troops sent to Canada to aid the commander of the French fleet, Fran√ßois Chenard de La Giraudais, prior to the Battle of Restigouche. His squadron was defeated on 8 July 1760 by Captain John Byron's British naval squadron, the last naval engagement of New France. However, D'Angeac organized thousands of Acadians and Indians and bolstered French defenses. Though there was ultimately an order to surrender, D‚ÄôAngeac was defiant, until finally agreeing to terms. =Governor= With the signing of the 1763 Treaty of Paris, the islands of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon became a new French colony, replacing Louisbourg as France's sedentary fishery base and deep-sea fishing fleet refuge. When D‚ÄôAngeac was appointed governor, Sir Charles Douglas delayed D'Angeac while Captain James Cook worked quickly to complete his survey of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon. D'Angeac served as governor from 15 June 1763 to 31 July 1773. His relations with Newfoundland's governor, Hugh Palliser, were strained; Palliser's letters were considered rude. D'Angeac requested permission to retire in 1765; it was denied. He was promoted to Brigadier des arm√©es of the line infantry in 1770. Two years later, he left the island of Saint-Pierre for France. With his recommendation, he was succeeded by his nephew, Charles Gabriel S√©bastien, Baron de l'Esp√©rance (1725, Louisbourg; died 1791). Personal life On 31 December 1735, in Louisbourg, he married Genevi√®ve (sister of Jean-Fran√ßois Lefebvre de Bellefeuille). They had seven children. D'Angeac retired to Soubise, Charente- Maritime, France where he died in 1782.

In 1777, located in London, he published Theory of Colours and Vision, a French edition of which, translated by Denis-Bernard Quatremere d'Isjonval, was published in the same year in Paris.

In 1785 Palmer, living in Paris, had Lettre sur les moyens de produire, la nuit, une lumiere pareille a celle du jour published.Palmer, G. 1785. Lettre sur les moyens de produire, la nuit, une lumiere pareille a celle du jour, Paris. In it he described the modification of oil lamp light with a blue glass mantel, resulting in the approximation of daylight. He became acquainted with Antoine-Arnoult Quinquet (1745‚Äì1803) and his partner Ambroise Bonaventure Lange, producers of a dual- air current (Argand-style) oil lamp and formed a partnership with the former.Anonymous, 1786. Journal de Paris, No. 350, Dec. 16, 1786, p. 1449. Introduction of the Quinquet-Lange lamp in Paris was the cause of Benjamin Franklin's famous letter on the subject of daylight saving time to the editor of Journal de Paris.Anonymous (Benjamin Franklin), 1784.

Theorie de la lumiere, applicable aux arts, et principalement a la peinture, Paris: Harduin et Gattey, Quinquet. Toward the end of that decade Palmer became a mercenary soldier in the Corps of Engineers, at different times for Sweden, Austria, and Russia, reaching the rank of Major, as described in his obituary. In 1803 he published in Leipzig four short works on various inventions, one being a fire-extinguishing powder. A demonstration in a pharmacy of the use of the powder was described in a Niedersachsen newspaper.Anonymous, 1803. Palmers feuerloeschendes Pulver, Niedersaechsischer Anzeiger fuer alle Staende, No. 3, pp. 34‚Äì37. In 1811 Palmer moved to Copenhagen into retirement and died there destitute in 1826.Thaarup, F. 1826. Dagen newspaper, Copenhagen, No. 66 (March 18), No. 68 (March 21) and No. 70 (March 23). Colour vision and colour blindness Palmer made a lasting contribution to the development of colour science by being the first to speculate that there are three different mechanisms in the human eye that account for colour vision: \\"The superficies of the retina is compounded of particles of three different kinds, analogous to the three rays of light; and each of these particles is moved by its own ray.\\"George Palmer, in http://www.gutenberg-e.org/lowengard/C_Chap17.html. This statement has proved true in regard to the number of different light sensor types, the cones, in the human eye, if not in regard to the claim of three kinds of light. Twenty-five years later a similar statement was made by the eminent physicist Thomas Young.Young, T. 1802. The Bakerian Lecture. On the theory of light and colours, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London 92, p. 12-48. Voigt, in his report on Giros von Gentilly, describes him as having stated that colour blindness arises if one or two of the three kinds of \\"particles\\" (light sensors) in the retina are inactive, a statement found to be accurate. In 1786 Palmer provided a hypothesis for the complementary nature of the successive contrast effect by stating that it is due to fatiguing of one or two of the light sensor types, an explanation that continues to be accepted as valid, as does his conjecture that the different kinds of sensors take different time intervals to recover upon exposure to strong light.

United States District Court, 542 U.S. 367 (2004), was a 2004 United States Supreme Court case between Vice President Dick Cheney and the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.. The case came as an appeal after the lower District Court for the District of Columbia ordered Cheney to disclose some of his records that would show how his National Energy Policy Development Group developed its recommendations. Cheney appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, but the Appeals Court rejected the appeal. In a 7‚Äì2 decision, the Court sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Prior history The case began when the conservative Judicial Watch filed Freedom of Information Act requests about the National Energy Policy Development Group, which Cheney headed, in 2001‚Äì2002. These requests were denied. Judicial Watch and the Sierra Club then sued, arguing the refusal a violation of the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972 (FACA), which requires committees set up by the president or by federal agencies to provide advice must conduct their business in public. The exception to this law is committees composed entirely of federal officials and employees, which de jure Cheney's committee was. However, Judicial Watch and the Sierra Club argued that because so many energy industry lobbyists were so deeply involved in the committee's work, they were effectively members. Under this, the committee would have to obey FACA. In 1993, the D.C. Circuit ruled in Association of American Physicians and Surgeons v. Clinton, that in such a situation, FACA does apply. In July 2002, D.C. district judge Emmet G. Sullivan ruled that Sierra Club and Judicial Watch deserved to know whether private citizens had taken part in the work of the task force to a large enough degree sufficient to bring the task force under the umbrella of the law. Rather than accepting the ruling, the vice president appealed it to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, arguing that complying would force him reveal information that, under law, he does not have to reveal. Cheney also argued that the order violated separation of powers principles. The Court of Appeals ruled that Cheney did have to turn over information. Cheney appealed this decision to the Supreme Court. Case The question the Court was debating was whether or not the D.C. District Court should have rejected the request from the Vice President to block disclosure of records from his energy policy task force. The Court ruled 7‚Äì2 that the lower appeals court had acted \\"prematurely\\" and sent the case back to the court. The Court did not rule on whether or not FACA should or should not apply to the task force, and left to the Court of Appeals. Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, agreed to by four other justices. Two justices, Clarence Thomas and Scalia would have had the case end there with Cheney not having to disclose any information. Ruth Bader Ginsburg was joined by David H. Souter in dissenting, arguing the Supreme Court should let the case proceed in the District Court. =Scalia conflict of interest controversy= The case received press attention when Antonin Scalia refused to recuse himself from the case, despite having hunted ducks with Cheney and others while the case was pending in the lower courts. Scalia filed a lengthy statement explaining why he was not recusing himself. In the end, Scalia supported Cheney. Subsequent history On May 9, 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the Vice President's Energy Task Force did not have to comply with the Federal Advisory Committee Act.

Geology Stratigraphy of the Canyonlands area, USGS Cataract Canyon is cut by the Colorado River into the Colorado Plateau, a vast continental uplift comprising much of the American Southwest. Until approximately 80 million years ago, the Colorado Plateau was near sea level. Over millions of years, a series of inland oceans transgressed onto and regressed from the region, resulting in a series of horizontally deposited rock layers. Approximately 70 to 80 million years ago, a series of mountain-building events called the Laramide orogeny uplifted the entire region. The Colorado River subsequently cut through the rock layers, exposing them. The oldest rock layer visible in Cataract Canyon is the Paradox Formation, which was deposited approximately 320 million years ago.Geology of Canyonlands National Park (USGS) History Indigenous peoples, most likely of the Fremont culture, inhabited the Canyonlands area long before European settlers arrived. Rock art and ruins have been found in Cataract Canyon that are at least 800 years old.Native American History of Canyonlands (National Park Service) Because of the remote location, it was some time before European explorers and settlers reached the area. The Colorado River and its canyons were more of an obstacle to travel than a destination to be explored. The first recorded European to reach Cataract Canyon was a fur trapper named Denis Julien in 1836. Julien carved his name into a rock wall in the lower section of Cataract Canyon, though this inscription is now covered by Lake Powell.Canyonlands European Explorers (National Park Service) The first organized exploration to travel the entire length of Cataract Canyon was the Powell Expedition in 1869, led by John Wesley Powell, a one-armed Civil War veteran who launched in wooden boats near Green River, Wyoming and traveled down the Green River to its confluence with the Colorado River at the top of Cataract Canyon. The rapids of Cataract Canyon terrified Powell and his men. The expedition portaged their boats around every rapid in the canyon, a difficult and arduous task. Because of the difficulty of the rapids, Powell named the canyon Cataract Canyon. After exiting Cataract Canyon, Powell continued his trip downstream through Glen Canyon, now submerged by Lake Powell, and ultimately the Grand Canyon before ending his trip near the mouth of the Virgin River.Down the Great Unknown: John Wesley Powell's 1869 Journey of Discovery and Tragedy Through the Grand Canyon, by Edward Dolnick, Harper Perennial, 2002, Other river runners soon followed. Nathanial Galloway made numerous trips through the canyon beginning in 1894. Galloway would later go on to pioneer rowing techniques still used by river runners today. Brothers Emery and Ellsworth Kolb traveled through the canyon in 1911. The Kolb brothers eventually established a studio on the south rim of the Grand Canyon where they featured videos of their exploits running the rapids of the Colorado River. Buzz Holmstrom made a solo trip through Cataract Canyon and Grand Canyon in 1937, eventually ending at the newly constructed Hoover Dam. The first commercial outfitter to offer trips through Cataract Canyon was Norman Nevills in 1938. The advent of rubber rafts came about in the early 1950s with the availability of surplus rubber rafts from World War II. River runners found the rubber rafts easier to maneuver and much more forgiving than their wooden counterparts. With this newer equipment, many commercial outfitters began running Grand Canyon and Cataract Canyon.History of Cataract Canyon Whitewater rafting Raft in the Big Drop Rapids, Cataract Canyon Cataract Canyon remains a popular whitewater rafting destination today. The rapids in the canyon are generally considered \\"big water\\", with a character similar to those found in Grand Canyon. Cataract Canyon is rated on the Class I-VI International Scale of River Difficulty, unlike the Grand Canyon which is rated on a scale of one to ten. Also unlike Grand Canyon, the flow of the Colorado River through Cataract Canyon is far enough downstream from a dam that it is generally unregulated. The river can reach extreme levels during the spring runoff in years following plentiful snow throughout the Colorado River watershed. During an average spring runoff, the Colorado River will peak at approximately . The maximum recorded flow of occurred on May 27, 1984.Historic Flows in Cataract Canyon National Park Service, Retrieved 2009-10-27 The rapids of Cataract Canyon become difficult at flows above and extreme at flows above .High water videos of Cataract Canyon National Park Service, Retrieved 2009-10-27 Most rapids in Cataract Canyon are simply named from upstream to downstream as Rapid 1, Rapid 2, etc. However, some rapids within the canyon have separate names due to their location or notoriety. Particularly notorious are the \\"Big Drops\\", a set of three rapids in short succession named \\"Big Drop 1\\", \\"Big Drop 2\\" and \\"Big Drop 3\\". During high water, these three rapids essentially run together to form one very large rapid. These rapids contain many large hydraulic features including \\"Little Niagara\\", \\"Satan's Gut\\", and \\"The Claw\\". During times of high runoff, the National Park Service sometimes establishes a camp below the big drops and uses a jetboat to facilitate rescues of capsized rafts and their passengers. However, it is generally understood that all river runners attempting Cataract Canyon at any river level should be capable of self-rescue and not depend on the NPS for support. Calm water during sunrise at Spanish Bottom, Cataract Canyon Cataract Canyon historically contained several rapids which are currently submerged beneath Lake Powell and have been buried in lake sediment. \\"Gypsum Canyon Rapid\\" and \\"Dark Canyon Rapid\\" in particular were considered very difficult rapids to navigate. River trips which run Cataract Canyon must also run one of the flatwater sections above the confluence of the Green and Colorado Rivers. Most groups launch at Potash (on the Colorado River) or Mineral Bottom (on the Green River) and spend up to five days on the river before entering Cataract Canyon. Motorized trips can make the trip into Cataract Canyon in substantially less time, often one day. In addition to the flatwater at the beginning of the trip, all groups must traverse Lake Powell before reaching the take-out at the Dirty Devil River or Hite Marina. Depending on the water level in Lake Powell, up to of lake water may be encountered by groups exiting the canyon. A number of commercial outfitters offer guided trips through Cataract Canyon. These trips vary in length between one and six days and utilize both motorized and non-motorized vessels. Private groups are required to obtain a permit from the National Park Service prior to embarking on a Cataract Canyon trip.Canyonlands National Park Permit Information Retrieved 2009-10-27 See also * Canyonlands National Park * List of whitewater rivers ReferencesExternal links * Cataract Canyon Information (National Park Service) Canyons and gorges of Utah Canyonlands National Park Glen Canyon National Recreation Area Canyons and gorges of Garfield County, Utah Landforms of San Juan County, Utah Landforms of Wayne County, Utah Colorado River ","title":"Cataract Canyon"},{"id":"21300139","text":"Scelilasia is a genus of moths in the subfamily Arctiinae.

The first open coaches appeared in the first half of the 19th century in the USA. The prototype for their design were the passenger cabins in the river steamers which were then widespread in America. As a result of their origin they were originally known in Europe as \\"American system passenger coaches\\" or \\"American coaches\\" (Personenwagen amerikanischen Systems or Amerikanerwagen) and the idea soon caught on in European railway companies. Initially they were mainly used for rural regional services, whilst urban local trains and local-distance services were dominated by compartment coaches. Several European railways, for example the Royal W√ºrttemberg State Railways or the Swiss Northeastern Railway (Schweizerische Nordostbahn), however, preferred open coaches from the start for all types of train. From the beginning of the 20th century open coaches became common used in local trains and began to spread to long-distance services too. High-speed trains often consist only of open coaches. The seats in open coaches are either arranged in groups opposite one another or behind one another aeroplane-style, and sometimes seats can be rotated to face the direction of travel. Seats facing one another may be provided with fixed tables, seats arranged one behind the other often have folding trays in the back of the seat in front. Open coaches are almost always equipped with gangways. Originally these were open platforms at the ends of the coach, but from the end of the 19th century the gangways have usually been protected with bellows or rubber connectors. Tramway On tramways, an open coach is a six- or eight-wheeled driving car or trailer, which has an especially high volumetric capacity. Unlike the earlier, typical platform coaches, open coaches do not have partitions with doors between the entrance area and the actual passenger compartment. These coaches were popular in central Europe in the early 1950s and replaced the old (mainly four-wheeled) platform coaches. Whilst in West Germany, Austria and Switzerland this type of vehicle was rapidly replaced by articulated trams, in East Germany, the Tatra trams were the norm during the 1960s in many cities. The same was true in the former Eastern Bloc countries.

Real-world analogues are directed-energy weapons or electrolasers: electroshock weapons which send current along an electrically conductive laser-induced plasma channel. History A very early example of a raygun is the Heat-Ray featured in H. G. Wells' novel The War of the Worlds (1898).Van Riper, op.cit., p. 46. Science fiction during the 1920s described death rays. Early science fiction often described or depicted raygun beams making bright light and loud noise like lightning or large electric arcs. According to The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction,Peter Nicholls, John Clute, and David Langford, \\"Ray Gun,\\" The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, 3rd edition, Jan 15, 2016 the word \\"ray gun\\" was first used by Victor Rousseau in 1917, in a passage from The Messiah of the Cylinder:Victor Rousseau , \\"The Messiah of the Cylinder\\", serialized in Everybody's Magazine, June‚ÄìSeptember 1917 ( ISFDB link). > All is not going well, Arnold: the ray-rods are emptying fast, and our > attack upon the lower level of the wing has failed. Sanson has placed a ray- > gun there. All depends on the air-scouts, and we must hold our positions > until the battle-planes arrive. The variant \\"ray projector\\" was used by John W. Campbell in The Black Star Passes in 1930. Related terms \\"disintegrator ray\\" dates to 1898 in Garrett P. Serviss' Edison's Conquest of Mars; \\"blaster\\" dates to 1925 in Nictzin Dyalhis' story \\"When the Green Star Waned;\\" and \\"needle ray\\" and \\"needler\\" date to 1934 in E.E. Smith's The Skylark of Valeron.Winchell Chung, \\"Introduction to Sidearms\\", Project Rho: Atomic Rockets (accessed 3 March 2016) Ray guns were so common on magazine covers during the Golden Age of Science Fiction that Campbell's Astounding was unusual for not depicting them. The term \\"ray gun\\" had already become clich√© by the 1940s,\\"Ray Gun\\", TV Tropes (accessed 3 March 2016) in part due to association with the comic strips (and later film serials) Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon. Soon after the invention of lasers during 1960, such devices became briefly fashionable as a directed- energy weapon for science fiction stories. For instance, characters of the Lost in Space TV series (1965‚Äì1968) and of the Star Trek pilot episode \\"The Cage\\" (1964) carried handheld laser weapons. By the late 1960s and 1970s, as the laser's limits as a weapon became evident, rayguns were dubbed \\"phasers\\" (for Star Trek), \\"blasters\\" (Star Wars), \\"pulse rifles\\", \\"plasma rifles\\", and so forth. In his book Physics of the Impossible, Michio Kaku used gamma ray bursts as an evidence to illustrate that extremely powerful rayguns such as the Death Star's primary weapon in the Star Wars franchise do not violate known physical laws and theories. He further analyses the problem of rayguns' power sources. Function Ray guns as described by science fiction do not have the disadvantages that have, so far, made directed-energy weapons largely impractical as weapons in real life, needing a suspension of disbelief by a technologically educated audience: *Ray guns draw seemingly limitless power from often unspecified sources. In contrast to their real-world counterparts, the batteries or power packs of even handheld weapons are minute, durable, and do not seem to need frequent recharging. *Ray guns in movies are often shown as shooting discrete pulses of energy visible from off-axis, traveling slowly enough for people to see them emerge, or even for the target to evade them, although real-life laser light is invisible from off-axis and travels at the speed of light. This effect could sometimes be attributed to the beam heating atmosphere that it was passing through. A possible evasion tactic is dodging the firing axis of the gun, theorized in the early story of Mobile Suit Gundam by the character Char Aznable when he first encountered the series protagonist's machine's beam rifle and seemingly dodging it without any difficulty. Some of the effects are what would be expected from a powerful directed-energy beam if it could be generated in reality: *Ray guns are often shown as transmitting heat, as with Wells' heat rays. *Ray guns may be used to cut through hard materials like a blowtorch. But sometimes not: *In movies, rays are often depicted as having effect instantaneously, with a touch of the beam sufficing for the intended purpose. Raygun victims are generally killed instantaneously, often ‚Äì as in the Star Wars films ‚Äì without showing visible wounds or even holes in their clothing. *Some rayguns cause their targets to disappear (\\"de-materialize\\", disintegrate, vaporize or evaporate) entirely, personal equipment and all. *Visible barrel recoil. This would only happen if the momentum of the beam were comparable to that of a bullet shot from a gun. *A wide range of non-lethal functions as determined by the requirements of the story: for instance, they may stun, paralyze or knock down a target, much like modern electroshock weapons. Occasionally the rays may have other effects, such as the \\"freeze rays\\" in the TV series Batman (1966‚Äì1968) and Underdog (1964‚Äì1970). Many of the more implausible functions are almost farcical and include rayguns that age or de-age people (various cartoons); shrink rays (Fantastic Voyage, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids), and a \\"dehydration ray\\" (Megamind). Ultimately, rayguns have whatever properties are required for their dramatic purpose. They bear little resemblance to real-world directed- energy weapons, even if they are given the names of existing technologies such as lasers, masers, or particle beams. This can be compared with real-type firearms as commonly depicted by action movies, as tending infallibly to hit whatever they are aimed at (when wielded by the heroes) and seldom depleting their ammunition.Van Riper, op.cit., p. 47. Rayguns by their various names have various sizes and forms: pistol-like; two-handed (often called a rifle); mounted on a vehicle; artillery-sized mounted on a spaceship or space base or asteroid or planet. Rayguns have a great variety of shapes and sizes, according to the imagination of the story writers or movie prop makers. Most pistol rayguns have a conventional grip and trigger, but some (e.g. Star Trek: The Next Generation phasers) do not. Sometimes the end of the barrel expands into a shield, as if to protect the user from back-flash from the emitted beam. Types The ray is usually stated to be one of the following: * Laser * A real type of particle beam, e.g. protons and/or neutrons from the proton packs in Ghostbusters * A fictional type of particle beam, such as: \\"Minovsky particles\\" in the Universal Century Gundam series scenario, where Minovsky Physics always operate; in the Mobile Suit Gundam 00 series, they use \\"GN particles\\" (a byproduct of a fictional topological defect baryon decay); and other timelines use other unknown particles.  Nadions, in the well-known Star Trek phaser  Rays named after Greek letters, other than the well-known real-world alpha ray, beta ray, gamma ray. This includes delta rays and epsilon rays, which however have also been given real-world meanings. * Plasma; see also plasma rifle * Defined by a word not known in real-world science, e.g. \\"disruptor\\". *Stunner: non-lethal and only disable an opponent temporarily by knocking them out. They are often seen in television cartoons where realistic effects of real-world weapons would be disallowed due to restrictions of violence. * See Blaster (Star Wars)#In-universe_technology for an attempt (using unreal technology) at describing how a type of raygun works. * Undefined Rayguns are often one-handed, sometimes two-handed, and often artillery-sized fastened to a spaceship.

In 1923, the LE&W; was merged into the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad, commonly referred to as the \\"Nickel Plate Road\\", and allocated 587 as its new number in 1924. In 2003, the locomotive was being restored by the Indiana Transportation Museum (ITM) in Noblesville, Indiana. However in 2018, the museum was currently being moved to Logansport, Indiana, forcing No. 587 to be stored in Ravenna, Kentucky by the Kentucky Steam Heritage Corp until the ITM can raise funds to restore the locomotive to operating condition. History NKP No. 587 was originally built for the Lake Erie & Western Railroad (LE&W;) and originally numbered as 5541. When LE&W; was bought by Nickel Plate Road in 1922 the NKP spent the next 2 years consolidating and standardizing the locomotive number system. In 1924, LE&W; 5541 was renumbered as NKP 587. Its cylinders were replaced with Lima Locomotive Works (LLW) castings during its late 1943 overhaul. NKP No. 587 served on the NKP railroad for 37 years on the route from Indianapolis to Michigan City. The locomotive remained relatively unchanged from its original design and operated until March 1955 when it was retired. On September 9th 1955, NKP 587 was donated to the city of Indianapolis and put on display in Broad Ripple Park, Indianapolis, Indiana. Prior to being put on display, the locomotive's original tender was switched with another NKP steam engine #639, because the tender on 639 was in need of repair and 587's original tender was in good mechanical condition. No. 587 was originally equipped with the 16-ton, 10,000 gallon tender used behind USRA 2-8-2s, but in the 1930s, it received a larger 16RA tender used on many NKP engines. This tender carried 19 tons of coal and 16,500 gallons of water. It is identifiable by having a six-wheel truck under the coal bunker and a four-wheel truck under the water cistern. In 1934, Lima Locomotive Works delivered 25 22RA tenders to the NKP for Mikados. These tenders were nearly identical to those behind the Berkshires (2-8-4) built by Lima. In 1955, another Mikado, No. 639 was shopped with a 22RA tender on which the stoker was inoperable, and the railroad switched tenders to keep the No. 639 running. No. 587 was displayed in Indianapolis's Broad Ripple Park with the larger 22RA tender in 1955. No. 639 was retired in 1957 and displayed in Bloomington, IL, with 587's 16RA tender. 1955‚Äì1983 NKP 587 remained in Broad Ripple Park until 1983. At that time the city of Indianapolis was interested in building a new public library in the park, but the only available location was where the 587 was displayed. A group of people called \\"Friends of 587\\" did a feasibility study and determined that the locomotive was a good project for restoration. The locomotive was then leased by the Indianapolis Parks Department to the Indiana Transportation Museum. From 1983 to September 1988 the Indiana Transportation Museum leased a work area at Amtrak's Beech Grove Shops. During restoration the museum was surprised to find that when the welds holding the fire box doors closed (for safety purposes) were removed there were still ashes in the ashpan. This indicated that the locomotive was simply pulled from active service and stored until being donated to the city of Indianapolis. Restoration consumed many thousands of volunteer hours and nearly $250,000 in donated money and materials. NKP 587 returned to active service in September 1988 by pulling an excursion train from Indianapolis to Logansport, Indiana. 1988‚Äì2003 NKP 587 was operated by the Indiana Transportation Museum and is considered its crown jewel. It was used primarily to pull the museum's fair train from Fishers, IN to the Indiana State Fair in Indianapolis, IN and other special events. In 1989, No. 587 led a rare tripleheader with Norfolk and Western 611 and Norfolk & Western 1218 for a deadhead run to the Asheville NRHS Convention. The 587 led two excursions for the Convention, one of them with 1218. The 587 later teamed up with 611 for the annual Independence Limited in 1990. In 1993, No. 587 led with Nickel Plate Road 765 on an excursion between Fort Wayne and Chicago as well as another doubleheader with 765 as part of the NRHS Convention. In 2000, No. 587 was used as the star locomotive on the children's movie Old 587: The Great Train Robbery. In the film, a group of kids find the locomotive in a scrapyard. With the help of the locomotive's old engineer, they rescue the 587 from being cut up for scrap and donating it to a museum. In early 2003, No. 587's Federal Railway Administration's (FRA) operating permit expired. This is due to FRA requirements to have all of the boiler tubes and flues from the steam locomotives to be replaced every 15 years, or 1,472 days of operation. 2003‚Äì2018 The disassembled No. 587 at the ITM's restoration shops in 2005 No. 587 is undergoing its second restoration dependent on funding and available volunteer efforts. The tubes, flues, dry pipe, super-heater, and many other pieces have been removed. The dry pipe was worn too thin to support the steam pressures necessary to operate the locomotive. A new dry pipe has been formed and is awaiting installation into the boiler. The air pump has been removed and rebuilt and is in storage awaiting re-installation. Several sections of the firebox have been cut away and replaced as well as a section of the rear tube sheet that was worn too thin to support the operating steam pressure. A new tube sheet section has been cut and using the heat and beat method has been molded into place. It is now in the contractor's shop to have the new holes drilled in it. New tubes have been swaged, which is a process of reducing the diameter on one end while not cutting away any material. They have been transported to the museum in Noblesville and are currently stored until they are needed. Riveting of the firebox is nearly complete with only the front section and several rivets in the corners needing to be replaced. This will require the rear driver of 587 to be dropped into a shallow pit to allow for the riveting to take place. The locomotive was inside ITM's shop undergoing additional work. It was lifted several inches off its supporting trucks and running gear to allow access to the leaf springs and bushings without the need to drop all the drivers. The bushings will be removed and replaced as most have worn thin from years of use. In 2008, the ownership of No. 587 was officially transferred from the Indianapolis Parks Department to the Indiana Transportation Museum. On June 28, 2018, a court order required ITM to vacate its former location. The Kentucky Steam Heritage Corporation made a deal with ITM to relocate the 587 and move it out before the deadline. Plans are for the locomotive to be moved to Ravenna, Kentucky and have it stored alongside Chesapeake and Ohio 2716 until the ITM can raise enough funds for restoration, eventually returning the locomotive back to Indiana once the restoration is complete. On July 7, most of the main components of the 587 left ITM's grounds, except for the tender body, which left ITM's grounds on July 12 and was fully unloaded on July 14. No. 587 is now currently awaiting to be rebuilt for an overhaul of boiler tubes and flues for its return to service.

At the age of six Blom's father died. His Uncle, Carl Gustav Berg, raised him and taught him to be a sailor.http://www.krusenbergherrgard.se/smadalarogard/omsmadalarogard/historik.367.html Career Blom became captain of his own ship and travelled both in the Mediterranean Sea and to America. During some time he was an employee of the Swedish West India Company that ran trade between Stockholm and Gustavia, capital of then Swedish colony Saint Barth√©lemy. Blom also participated in the Battle of Svensksund during the Russo-Swedish War (1788‚Äì1790). In October 1789 Captain Blom was an appointed an extraordinary assignment by king Gustav III‚Äôs right hand, Michael Ankarsw√§rd. He was supposed to hand over 54 Turks, that were saved from Russian captivity, back to Turkey again. Furthermore, he was supposed to deliver ‚Äúgifts‚Äù to the Bey of Tunis. This, in order to avoid Swedish ships being attacked by pirates, who then ravaged the coast of North Africa without resistance. It was a dangerous task, Catain Blom however was a brave man and he accepted the assignment in exchange for a great deal of money. The following years as Captain on a non-governmental trade ship made Carl Peter Blom a very wealthy man. Sm√•dalar√∂ G√•rd In 1802 Captain Blom bought a part of the Tyres√∂ estate, located outside Stockholm, from Countess Brita Bonde. The part that Blom bought for 12 000 Swedish riksdaler banco, consisted of; Sm√•dalar√∂, V√§stertorp, Gr√§n√∂, G√•s√∂ and Kymmend√∂, all located in the Stockholm archipelago. Kymmend√∂ was also later portrayed as Hems√∂, in August Strindberg ‚Äôs ‚ÄúNatives of Hems√∂‚Äù. In 1809 Blom built the mansion Sm√•dalar√∂ g√•rd which celebrates 200-years anniversary in 2009. Captain Blom was very attached to the island where he was borne, Mj√∂fj√§rd, and therefore built Sm√•dalar√∂ G√•rd on a strategic spot from where he could see his childhood home. First the stone house had two floors, but as he still could not see Mj√∂fj√§rd, he added a third floor. By 1810 the house was finished. Captain Blom himself did not live in the stone house. In the house he instead held parties and dinners for his guests. Today, the house is the main building of the estate and hotel that Sm√•dalar√∂ G√•rd has become. Blom lived in a smaller building nearby, that does not exist today. He preferred to live his life alone and when he died from heart seizure in 1818, he had no children of his own. Due to this, his nephew, Anders Berg, inherited the estate. Berg had been in love with a maid at the estate, Anna Sofia, for a long time. Captain Blom‚Äôs opinion was that Berg deserved a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù wife, and therefore had Anna Sofia sent away with boat to another part of the archipelago. This had caused great disputes between Blom and his nephew, and as the story goes, this was what caused the seizure. Still, after Blom's death, Berg took the opportunity of marrying Anna Sofia. They lived happily until Anders died in 1835. His widow managed the estate 25 further years.

United States, 223 F.3d 898, 903 (8th Cir. 2000). Discussed in \\"Precedent and Judicial Power after the Founding\\", Polly J. Price, Bostom College L.R., Vol. 42 No. 1, Dec. 2000, pg. 81-122. England from Henry II=Common law forms of pleading: Writs= In the legal practice that emerged in royal courts under Henry II any case had to fit into a narrowly defined form of pleading usually called a \\"writ\\". By the time of Henry III the number of such writs had grown to over 500, but even that many did not cover all the possible claims that people sought to make.Charles Rembar, The Law of the Land: The Evolution of Our Legal System, New York: Simon & Schuster, 1980. Pp. 172ff. The Provisions of Oxford in 1258 forbade the royal clerks to create any new writs. The result of this was that the courts began to adopt \\"fictions\\" such as imaginary parties or actors so that the facts of a case could be fit within one of the established forms, and the Writ of Trespass came to become the catchall form for most claims.Rembar, Law of the Land, p. 203. It is important to understand that, unlike much current practice, the writs of pleading were not court orders granting relief but the summons, prepared by the plaintiff, filed with the court, and served on the respondent. United States=U.S. Constitution= The nonconflicting parts of the English and American common law and its forms of pleading were explicitly incorporated into the U.S. Constitution. Seventh Amendment: > In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty > dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by > a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, > than according to the rules of the common law. =Field Code 1848= By the middle of the 19th century strong resistance developed to the rigidities of the common law forms of pleading brought over from England, whose monarchical forms often conflicted with U.S. republican law that made the people the sovereign. New York State was the first to adopt a codification of legal forms and procedures, called the Field Code from its principal author, David Dudley Field II. Within a few years, most but not all other states adopted similar codes. One of the reforms made was to unite courts of law and equity. The reforms made it easier to get a case started without loading most of the argument and proof at the outset, and made discovery more important during the course of the case. However, there was opposition to the reforms,Is Codification of the Law Expedient?, by William B. Hornblower. Address delivered before the American Social Science Association (Department of Jurisprudence) at Saratoga, N.Y., September 6, 1888. Link and resistance from the legal profession, including judges, that prevented the codes from being implemented as intended. =Federal Rules 1938= Before the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) were enacted in 1938, common law pleading was more formal, traditional, and particular in its phrases and requirements. For example, a plaintiff bringing a trespass suit would have to mention certain key words in his complaint or risk it being dismissed with prejudice. In contrast, the FRCP is based on a legal construction called notice pleading, which is less formal, created and modified by legal experts, and far less technical in requirements. In notice pleading, the same plaintiff bringing suit would not face dismissal for lack of the exact legal term, so long as the claim itself was legally actionable. The policy behind this change is to simply give \\"notice\\" of your grievances, and leave the details for later in the case. This acts in the interest of equity by concentrating on the actual law and not the exact construction of pleas. Thirty-five states have adopted versions of the federal rules as their own procedural code. In addition to notice pleading, a minority of states (e.g., California) use an intermediate system known as code pleading. Code pleading is an older system than notice pleading and is based on legislative statute. It tends to straddle the gulf between obsolete common-law pleading and modern notice pleading. Code pleading places additional burdens on a party to plead the \\"ultimate facts\\" of its case, laying out the party's entire case and the facts or allegations underlying it. Notice pleading, by contrast, simply requires a \\"short and plain statement\\" showing only that the pleader is entitled to relief. (FRCP 8(a)(2)). One important exception to this rule is that when a party alleges fraud, that party must plead the facts of the alleged fraud with particularity. (FRCP 9(b)). There has been some controversy over whether the FCRP violate the Eighth Amendment requirement of common law rules, but the usual answer has been that the changes are only in form and not in substance.

It belongs to the Ministry of the Interior and is the legal owner of the roads and has the authority to execute construction of infrastructures on demand from the ministry. History=Until the 20th century= Until the 18th century there were no official roads in Iceland, only paths and barely visible tracks which people followed with the help of cairns for a few kilometers in either direction. In the 19th century, when fishing villages began to spring up on shores and sandbanks, infrastructure between farms and villages began to improve. As fishermen's camps became villages, with homes and workshops, they also became important trading posts for the farms around them. Farmers traveled to the villages with their raw materials and traded these for imported goods, mostly Danes. This was, of course, not a new thing in Iceland. These places had long been sites for Danish tradesmen but as these trading posts became villages, communication and infrastructure were bound to improve due to increased traffic. In the 19th century, horse carriages became more common among farmers and by the beginning of the 20th century carriage trail tracks had formed from every village in the countryside. =Early 20th century ‚Äì 1960= In the early 20th century a few automobiles had come to Iceland and streets had been formed in the largest towns. But roads were needed to connect settlements, and the government called for the old horse tracks to be upgraded to gravel roads. In 1918 the Icelandic government established the offices of Vegam√°lastj√≥ri (Director of Roads) and Vitam√°lastj√≥ri (Director of Lighthouses). The latter was an officer overseeing lighthouses and sea transportation and the office of Vegam√°lastj√≥ri was the predecessor of the Vegager√∞ R√≠kisins institution which was formed a few years later and is now called Vegager√∞in. The history of road construction in Iceland can be divided into two eras: pre-1960 and post-1960. Before 1960 the main concern of the government was to provide road access to all populated areas and to all farms. This was a great task and there was a modest budget. The roads were built by a large human workforce and they were narrow and uneven. The terrain was challenging for the roadbuilders as it is often rough, and most places in the Eastern and Westfjords are surrounded by dominating cliff mountains and headlands. =1960‚Äìpresent= Iceland became very wealthy after World War II via the Marshall Plan, and in the 1950s and 1960s enormous progress was made in Icelandic infrastructure. In 1960 it was announced that the task of giving all populated areas road access was completed; the next step was to improve these wretched roads, to build bridges and tunnel and to improve road surfaces using asphalt. At the time, Vegager√∞in was a very large organization in proportion to Iceland's population, with many workers and much equipment. In the 1980s and 1990s, when the huge wave of privatisation in Iceland and Western Europe, independent contractors became more common in road construction, both in urban and rural areas. Vegager√∞in reduced its direct labour workforce and began to rely more and more on private contractors for building roads and other infrastructure. Today Vegager√∞in has no road building workforce or equipment: the work has been completely privatized. Thus Vegager√∞in is the intermediary between the contractors and the government. Although the word vegager√∞in means \\"the road-makers\\", it is now an administrative organisation which employs mainly office staff, doing measuring, planning and tendering. Road administration areas The administrative divisions of the Road Administration Vegager√∞in has its headquarters in the capital, Reykjav√≠k, but its activity in the countryside is controlled from outposts in various towns and the country is divided into four administrative divisions. Those are South, Southwest, Northwest and Northeast. Each of these is subdivided into two service areas, except for the Southwest area which covers only a small area. That is because it includes the capital, and has a much denser road network than the other regions. The service area is where the maintenance department of each service facility (which are in various towns and villages) can maintain the road, signs, tunnels etc. External links *Official website *Official website Road authorities Road transport in Iceland Government agencies of Iceland Transport organizations based in Iceland ","title":"Icelandic Road Administration"},{"id":"21300494","text":"Sebastia is a monotypic tiger moth genus in the family Erebidae described by William Forsell Kirby in 1892.

Origins In the spring of 1760 Smith began planning to move his family from their home in Chatham to a new home in Barrington, Nova Scotia. He was to be one of the earliest settlers in the area, along with Solomon Smith, Jonathan Smith, and Thomas Crowell. He spent the summer of 1760 fishing, and during that time, determined native hostility in the Barrington area was too threatening, and so he changed his mind about moving. However, his wife Elizabeth was unaware of his change of heart, and took it upon herself to travel to Barrington with her family before her husband returned to Chatham. It is possible that they crossed paths, but certainly he was delayed in returning to Barrington. When he finally got there, he found his family being cared for by friendly natives, the same people he had feared.Island Memories, published 1982 by the Archelaus Smith Historical Society, Cape Sable IslandThe Island Looks Back, published 1981 by the Archelaus Smith Historical Society, Cape Sable IslandHistory and Genealogy of the Mayflower Planters and First Comers to Ye Olde Colonie, Cape Cod Series Vol I, by Leon Clark Hills, published 1936, Washington DC, re- published 1996 by the Genealogical Publishing Co, Baltimore MD Original proprietor Smith was one of the original proprietors in the area, settling at Barrington Head in the fall of 1760. In fact, the first three houses at Centreville were called \\"the Housen\\", and belonged to Archelaus Smith, Simeon Gardner, and Jonathan Covell. \\"Housen\\" was Anglo-Saxon for houses. Smith's home was nearly opposite the old meeting house. In 1773 he moved to Cape Sable Island, where he and his family occupied almost all the land from Northeast Point to West Head (a distance of five miles). He also held a tract of land at Lower Clark's Harbour, Cape Sable Island (known then as Stumpy Cove), a large part of Hawk Point, and a great meadow in the centre of the island. He took over land that had been forfeited and abandoned by Joseph Worth, and built a home near the shore, a little north of where the Centreville Baptist Church would later stand. Around 1776 he moved to a house near the shore on Cape Sable Island, near the spot where just before 1981 Job Kenney would build the house that stands today. It is a short distance from the Centreville Baptist Church. Character Smith had a fair education, and was highly respected by other settlers. He was known as a \\"good, quiet, easy, patient man\\", and was chosen over several years to be clerk of the proprietors, as well as a community magistrate and a surveyor. By trade he was a tanner and a shoemaker, using lime made from mussel shells to cure leather. He was very religious, belonging to the Presbyterian church, and no food was cooked in his house on Sundays. Before a minister came to the island he conducted prayers for the community, and when necessary, buried the dead. Death Smith died 3 April 1821 in Centreville, Cape Sable Island, Nova Scotia. He is probably buried in the Centreville Cemetery, but his grave is unmarked, so in 1998 a stone in honour of Smith and his wife was erected there.Island Memories (published 1982 by the Archelaus Smith Historical Society, Cape Sable Island) In addition, a museum on Cape Sable Island has been established in his memory, containing historical artifacts, photos, and genealogical data of area families (largely compiled by Margaret Messenger).

The Library was one of the many projects the College Alumni Association tools part in. the alumni decided to collect ten thousand Egyptian pounds for the construction of the Library. However, the cost of constructing the Library reached twenty thousand pounds. The graduates and the Egyptian friends of the college paid three quarters of the cost; at that time the highest amount donated by an individual was five hundred pounds. The last quarter of the cost was donated by friends of the colleges, living abroad. The donation was given in the form of money or as materials such as tiles for the floors or furniture for the reading rooms or educational aids. The Helen Martin Library was a fulfillment of Dr. Martin's dream for ever since she became the college principal she had wished that the college would have an independent library in a building of its own. The construction of the Helen Martin library took several years in which the college administration exerted great efforts to collect the money needed. Years later, those efforts were fruitful and the library was inaugurated in 1945. The college was honored to invite the president of the republic at that time, President Mohamed Naguib to inaugurate the library. In a huge celebration, headed by Dr.Martin and attended by high Authorities in the country and a large number of graduates who participated with their donations in the construction of the library. The library, as previously mentioned is full of different kinds of books in the three languages, Arabic, English and French.

Dr. Helen J. Martin served as principal from 1923 to 1956. In 1960, with the nationalization of private schooling, its ownership was transferred to the Evangelical Church of Egypt (Synod of the Nile), an Egyptian Protestant organization. The school's cosmopolitan community gradually dwindled until it became entirely Egyptian. In 1967, following the Arab - Israel War and subsequent strained relations with the United States, the school's name was changed to Ramses College for Girls. From 1967 to 1992 the school's principal was Reda Salama of the legendary Salama sisters (her sister Mary was principal of PortSaid School), who established an Institute of Secretarial Studies and a Department for Girls with Special Needs.

The war was caused by British fears of increasing Russian involvement in Afghan affairs. In 1877 the Afghan Amir refused to accept a British Resident and in 1878 agreed a treaty with Russia granting it protective rights in Afghanistan. In response, a British-led force entered the country in November 1878 and advanced on Kabul. After defeats at Ali Musjid and Peiwar Kotal, the Afghans sued for peace and accepted a British Resident in Kabul, the war ending on 26 May 1879. After the Resident was murdered on 3 September 1879, the war recommenced. A British-led force occupied Kabul, defeating the Afghans en route at Charasia. Sporadic fighting continued and after defeat at Maiwand, a British force was besieged in Kandahar. General Roberts led a column that marched from Kabul to relieve Kandahar, the resulting Afghan defeat leading to the conclusion of the war in September 1880.Roberts, pp 351-494. The soldiers who took part in General Roberts' march were awarded the Kabul to Kandahar Star in addition to the Afghanistan Medal.Dorling, p 67. Medals awarded to the 66th Foot (Berkshire Regiment) and E Battery of B Brigade, Royal Artillery, rate a high premium as these units sustained the heaviest casualties at the battle of Maiwand in July 1880.Mussel, p 150. When the first phase of the war ended in May 1879, it was proposed that the India General Service Medal be issued with clasps for Afghanistan, Ali Musjid and Peiwar Kotal. However when the war recommenced in September 1879, it was decided to award a distinct medal to cover the whole campaign.Mayo, p 402.  Description  The Afghanistan Medal is a circular silver medal, in diameter, with the following design:Joslin, Litherland and Simpkin, pp 155-156. *The obverse shows a veiled effigy of Queen Victoria, facing left, with \\"VICTORIA REGINA ET IMPERATRIX\\" around the edge. *The reverse shows marching and mounted soldiers with arms with an elephant carrying a cannon. In the upper-left of the medal around the edges is \\"AFGHANISTAN\\" and on the bottom in a straight line is \\"1878-79-80\\" *The medal hangs from a plain suspender which is attached to the medal with a double toe claw. The ribbon is wide and is dark green with broad crimson edges. *The recipient's rank, name and unit are engraved on the rim of the medal. *Plain silver clasps were awarded and are found as follows: \\"ALI MUSJID\\" (21 November 1878) \\"PEIWAR KOTAL\\" (2 December 1878) \\"CHARASIA\\" (6 October 1879) \\"KABUL\\" (10‚Äì23 December 1879) \\"AHMED KHEL\\" (19 April 1880) \\"KANDAHAR\\" (1 September 1880) The maximum number of clasps awarded to any one man was four. The medal was awarded without a clasp to those who saw service in Afghanistan between 22 November 1878 ‚Äì 26 May 1879, or 3 September 1879 ‚Äì 20 September 1880, but did not take part in these major actions.Mayo, p 406.

Located on the Sava River, eight kilometers northwest of the city center, it is known locally as Kayak Canoe Club Tacen (). The course played an important role in development of the sport during the past six decades. In 1939, when its first competition was held, it was a natural rapid at the base of a dam in the Sava River. In 1990, after many upgrades, it was given a concrete channel and the features of a modern Olympic-style slalom course. The course now starts in the lake behind the dam, and the spillway is the first drop. Tacen hosts a major international competition almost every year, examples being the 1955, the 1991, and the 2010 Championships. Spillway drop of the Tacen Whitewater Course. Looking down on the spillway drop from the covered bridge. Venue Map of Tacen Whitewater Course north of Ljubljana, Slovenia. The engineered part of the course is only 170 meters long. To increase its length to 275 meters, the course is extended upstream into the lake behind the dam and downstream into the natural flow of the Sava River. The upstream extension means that each paddler must begin the race with an 8-second flat-water sprint and reach the top of the spillway at maximum speed. That plus the usual upstream gate at the bottom of the spillway make for a challenging start, unlike that of any other venue in the international competition circuit.

Biography Born on April 16, 1904 in Piedmont, Italy, Ernest Joseph Boffa relocated as a young child to Canada with his family, living first in Calgary and then in Thunder Bay (Fort William), Ontario. He left school in 1918 to go full-time at his job in a bicycle shop. He moved on the Canadian Car and Foundry, working as an apprentice while training in mechanical engineering and drafting through correspondence courses and night school. He took up automobile racing after his employer closed, using his mechanical skills to help him produce and maintain winning cars. In 1927, Boffa moved to Great Falls, Montana taking up flying and aircraft repair. He earned a license to fly in the United States in 1928 and refurbished a damaged Waco 10 plane before returning to Lethbridge, Alberta. There, in 1931, he received a commercial pilots license and Canadian Engineers license, working such aviation jobs as he could find before taking a series of jobs with airlines beginning in 1937, M&C; Airways, Canadian Airway and McNeal Air Services. During World War II, he was a flight instructor until 1943, when he began flying for Canadian Pacific Airways on the Yellowknife Airways, which he co-owned on a 20/80 split with Matt Berry. In 1954, he became involved with the Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line as a technical advisor. From 1956 to 1962, he was a contract pilot and, from 1962 to 1970, flew for a fishing lodge on Great Bear Lake. Prior to working for the DEWline Ernie was a well known bush pilot flying for Associated Airways. On occasion he would stop off at any handy lake to try a little fishing. This at times caused other to think he was lost. He used to boast that others might consider him lost but he was never lost. He always knew where he was. He died in Los Angeles, California, USA, on March 8, 2004.

The commune has a Sahelian climate, with rainfall varying from 700 to 900 mm per year with three seasons: dry, rainy and cold. Vegetation is diverse and consists of grasses, shrubs and some trees such as baobab. Some vegetation is extracted for firewood, lumber, and for medical purposes.

The administrative centre (chef-lieu) is Oussoubidiagna, a small town with around 4,000 inhabitants. The commune contains over thirty small villages. In the 2009 census it had a population of 32,527. Most of the inhabitants of Tomora are Khassonk√©s, with a minority of Soninke, Fulani and Malinke engaged mostly in farming. History and administration The Borough of Oussoubidiangna was created in 1959 by merging the townships of Tomora, Sidib√©la, Kont√©la, Soroma and Diaye. However, by Law No. 96 - 059/AN- RM of November 4, 1996 thirty seven villages in the Borough of Oussoubidiangna formed the current rural commune of Tomora. The management of its affairs is entrusted to a council of twenty-three members and a communal office consists of a Mayor and three assistant deputies. The mayor, currently Hamet Sissoko, and his deputies are responsible for the implementation of the decisions of the municipal council, and a prefect is chosen to represent to commune as a state representative and is responsible for advisory support to the municipal authorities. Geography and climate The commune of Tomora is located 100 km north of Bafoulab√©. It is bounded on the east by the rural commune of Diallan, north by Diakon, south by the commune of Bafoulab√© and west by the municipality of Sidib√©la, and to the south-east by Kont√©la. Tomora is located on the foothills of the Fouta Djallon, and the commune has a topography characterized by a multitude of hills with narrow plains between them. The climate is Sahelian, typically hot, with rainfall varying from 700 to 900 mm per year with three main seasons: dry (March, April, May and June), Rainy (July‚ÄìOctober) and cold (November‚ÄìFebruary). No permanent watercourse traverses the commune so for water the inhabitants have had to resort to drilling wells and collecting water from further afield given that there is no permanent piped water supply. The Nando Peretti Foundation, backed with funding from the AECI (International Co-operation Spanish Agency), by the ECGO (Humanitarian Aid Office, European Commission) and private financial supporters and institutions such as the Barcelona Provincial Council, the Catalan Fund for Development and La Caixa Bank have been involved in improving water supply in the commune, particularly in the village of Madalaya and the surrounding villages of Tif√©, Bougountinti, Mansadji, Diafan, Yahinane, Tamratinti, Bdiandiana, Gao and Diba. They have also instructed the local people to maintain the borehole pump and distribution system to obtain the best advantage of fresh water availability to provide for some 8000 people in the local area, including 1360 in Madalaya and rest in the surrounding villages. At present a yield of 40 m3 per day is supplied by 10 traditional wells, but the wells are shallow and the aquifers unfavorable, less than 20 m deep while the drill hole depths range between 43 and 80 m. However the variety of soils from gravelly or silty to sandy loam and sandy clay are suitable in many parts for agriculture. A number of plants inhabit the commune including gum, baobab, jujube, Kungo sira and other thorny species and the trees are plants are often used for firewood, lumber, and for medical purposes. Economy The economy is based on agriculture, harvesting and trade and crafts. The people of Tomora farm sorghum, maize, beans and cassava and rely on groundnuts as cash crops. They also grow vegetables such as onion, tomato, okra, eggplant, squash and peppers. Pastoral farming is particularly important, especially for food supply and saving money for household food bills. Shea butter, monkey bread, are also produced and are also intended primarily for consumption while the wine of palmyra and raffia is a source of income for people. Making mats and baskets is also a local custom and blacksmiths, shoemakers, potters and weavers are involved in this crafts sector. They sell their products at the weekly market in the main town of Oussoubidiagna. Religion In the 2000s, the commune has been subjects to visits by Christian missionaries. The United Bible Society in coordination with the Norwegian Protestant Mission are of major note in this respect and educated several villagers in the region in 2007 in English. On February 25, 2008 a United Bible Society/NPM convoy of seven vehicles left Bamako to travel to Oussoubidiagna under the guidance of Jacques Dembele, General Secretary of the Bible Society in Mali and their translation correspondent, Youssouf Dembele. Most of missionaries were Norwegian and affiliated with the Norwegian Protestant Mission. Christianity had never really reached the commune and a large crowd had gathered in the main square to greet them, including the mayor, Sissoko. Hunters and musicians and dancing girls and horses turned the visit into a celebration which is a Khassonk√© custom at important events. The people of Tomora slaughtered two cows and about fifteen sheep to provide a feast. The Bible Society had been responsible for spreading Christianity in the area by establishing the Khassonk√© New Testament, translated by those they had educated in English into the Khassonk√©. The New Testament was brought in, wrapped in a large gift box and followed by a small church choir which performed Khassonk√© songs throughout the ceremony. The arrival of the Bible in Tomora was attended by numerous eminent Malian Khassonk√© and religious figures, including Kadiatou Dembele, a member of staff of the Ministry of Primary Education, Literacy and National Languages, Oumar Ciss√©, a representative of the Khassonk√© language department at Bamako University; Abbot Urephin Som√©, curate of Kakoulou, representing the bishop of the Kayes region, Sheik Oumar Coulibaly, the sub-prefect of Tomora and Sidib√©la representing the regional governor, and Daniel Coulibaly, delegate of the Association of Evangelical Protestant Churches and Missions in Mali and the village imam, Diawoye Tamega etc. Hamet Sissoko, the mayor of Tomora, in his speech said, ‚Äúa unique day, a day of joy, a day bringing honour to all Malians, but also a day spreading the influence of a whole culture, a proud day for the Khassonk√© people. That which education could not achieve, that which the government should have done, has now been carried out by the Norwegian Protestant Mission, thanks to the goodwill and the love of the Khassonk√© people‚Äù.

After obtaining his B.Th. in 1577, he was referred to as Erudito Benedicte because, in the words of John Harington, \\"'he would tosse an Argument in the Schools, better than a Ball in the Tennis- court\\". In 1583, Bennet became master of the Hospital of St Cross in Winchester and left Cambridge. Together with Thomas Bilson, the warden of Winchester College, he became active in attempts to end Catholic recusancy. This work brought him to the attention of William Cecil, Lord Burghley, who appointed Bennet as one of his personal chaplains and, in March 1596, aided his appointment as Dean of Windsor in succession to William Day. He combined his work as dean with that as master of St Cross. He offended Elizabeth I by preaching against her proposed marriage to Fran√ßois, Duke of Anjou. Despite Bennet's opposition to royal demands that he cede property under his control, he was elected as Bishop of Hereford in January 1603. He had turned down the offer of the bishopric of Salisbury in 1598 because that had required him to alienate some of his property rights. He determined in his new role to continue his suppression of Catholic recusancy but was unsuccessful in persuading his superiors ‚Äì such as James I ‚Äì to grant the diocesan commission that he envisaged to be his instrument in achieving this end. His health began to fail, which he blamed on the \\"cold and rheumatic\\" climate of the diocese. He failed in his attempt to move to the vacant bishopric at Worcester in 1610 and subsequently used his position to promote evangelical work and to improve the education of clergymen, notably through the Leintwardin lecture. Bennet was married but details of his wife are unknown. He left a substantial sum of money for his burial expenses and detailed instructions regarding what should be done at his death, which occurred in October 1617. He had designed his own white alabaster effigy, which still exists in Hereford cathedral, where he was buried close to where his wife sat. His heir was a nephew, also called Robert Bennet, and his successor at Hereford was Francis Godwin, the author of numerous books including the remarkable piece of science fiction titled The Man in the Moone.

Retrieved: 28 January 2009. The dam and associated infrastructure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. Chatuge Dam is named for an 18th-century Cherokee village once situated near the dam site. Location Chatuge Dam is located above the mouth of the Hiwassee River, just north of the North Carolina-Georgia state line. Chatuge Lake extends southward for along the Hiwassee and eastward for roughly along Shooting Creek, which once emptied into the Hiwassee immediately upstream from the dam site. The dam and the North Carolina section of the reservoir are surrounded by the Nantahala National Forest, and the Georgia section of the reservoir is surrounded by the Chattahoochee National Forest. Hayesville, North Carolina (north of the dam) and Hiawassee, Georgia (to the south) are the nearest communities of note. Capacity Chatuge Dam is an earth-and-rock dam high and long, and has a generating capacity of 10,000 kilowatts. The dam's concrete overflow \\"ski-jump\\" spillway consists of 50 bays with a combined discharge of . Chatuge Lake has a flood storage capacity of and of shoreline. Water passes Chatuge Dam via the dam's intake tower (connected to the dam by a footbridge), from which a steel conduit carries the water under the dam and empties it downstream. Background and construction TVA's design plan for Chatuge Dam, circa 1941 Various private entities recognized the hydroelectric potential of the Hiwassee in the early 1900s, although plans for dams were typically focused further downstream from the Chatuge site. After taking control of flood control operations in the valley in the 1930s, the Tennessee Valley Authority built Hiwassee Dam and carried out an extensive survey of the river (the waters of which were a major contributor to flooding in Chattanooga) in which they identified the Chatuge site. The outbreak of World War II in Europe brought an emergency demand for electricity, mainly to power aluminum production in East Tennessee, and TVA offered to meet this demand by building a series of dams on the Hiwassee and several other Tennessee River tributaries. The Chatuge Dam project (originally called the Hayesville project), along with several other dam projects, was authorized July 16, 1941. Work on the dam began the following day. Workers building the concrete culvert for Chatuge's conduit The construction of Chatuge Dam and its reservoir required the purchase of of land, of which had to be cleared. 278 families, 532 graves, and of roads (including part of U.S. Route 64) had to be relocated. TVA kept the dam's design simple and relied on basic building materials (i.e., earth and rock) in order to complete the dam as quickly as possible in hopes of allowing the reservoir to collect the 1941-1942 winter rains. The dam was constructed of impervious earthen fill fortified on both sides by riprap. The spillway was the only major part of the dam that required concrete. Since the reservoir would fill slowly and create mosquito-breeding environments, various measures were taken to prevent malaria outbreaks. Chatuge Dam was completed and its gates closed on February 12, 1942. The cost of the whole project was just over $9 million. For most of its early years, Chatuge was operated as a flood storage unit in conjunction with nearby Nottely Dam (which has an almost identical design) to regulate water flow at Hiwassee Dam downstream. A small generator was installed at Chatuge in 1954.

Following a Coalition defeat at the Battle of Hondshoote they were forced to raise the siege and withdraw northeast. Siege Map of the Siege of Dunkirk and the Battle of Hondschoote The decision to besiege Dunkirk was taken not by military commanders, but by the British government, chiefly by William Pitt's closest advisor, War Minister Henry Dundas. Right from the beginning of the campaign Dundas had considered the possession of Dunkirk as desirable, both as a bargaining counter in peace negotiations and as a potential British base in Europe. As a military objective towards winning the war, however, its value was far less significant, as it arguably prevented Prince Frederick, Duke of York from supporting the main Allied thrust further inland. Nevertheless, York obediently followed instructions and through the latter days of August 1793 moved rapidly north-west, the French remaining mystified as to his objective. On 22 August he marched from Veurne (Furnes) to invest Dunkirk at the head of 20,000 British, Austrians and Hessians, driving the French advance posts in confusion from the left bank of the Yser River to an entrenched camp at Ghyvelde and capturing 11 guns in the process. The Advance Guard consisting of the Austrian Szt√°ray Infantry Regiment Nr. 33 and O'Donnell's Freikorps lost 50 men in killed and wounded.Officer of the Guards I p.102 The commander of the Army of the North, Jean Nicolas Houchard was disgusted when he heard of the flight, writing to the Minister \\"The soldiers are good, but the cowardice and crass ignorance of the officers make them learn cowardice, and to fly before the enemy is nothing to them\\".Phipps I, pp. 218‚Äì219 To protect York's left flank Heinrich Wilhelm von Freytag commanded a corps of 14,500 Hessian and Hanoverian troops which he spread across surrounding villages in a broad military cordon along the Yser to the south of Dunkirk. On the right Feldmarschall-Leutnant J√≥zsef Alvinczi commanded the Austrian contingent, Lieutenant Generals Ralph Abercromby and Sir William Erskine, 1st Baronet led the British forces, and on the left Lieutenant General Buttlar led the Hessians.Smith, p 54Brown p. 69 Not only were the French surprised by York's advance, Dunkirk's defences were in a dilapidated condition.Burne p. 71 The town would most likely have fallen quickly had the promised Royal Navy fleet arrived on time, an English civilian witness wrote to the Public Advertiser that the town would have surrendered outright had it not been for Commissioners arriving from Paris to prevent it.Burne p. 71 Meanwhile, in Paris the election of Lazare Carnot and Pierre Louis Prieur to the Committee of Public Safety was to have immediately beneficial consequences for the Republican field armies. Carnot realised that a defeat for Britain before Dunkirk would be a humiliating blow, and consequently, 40,000 men from other sectors were ordered to concentrate to the south of Dunkirk in support of the 5,000 defenders of the town under Joseph Souham. Most of these forces were concentrated near the entrenched camp at Cassel to take part in Carnot's intended flank attack, however on 24 August a column under the command of Jean-Baptiste Jourdan reached Loon, having been diverted from Lille over the head of Houchard by the Repr√©sentant en mission, and he was able to reinforce the Dunkirk garrison by 2,500 reinforcements to nearly 8,000, while the remainder occupied Bergues. Burne indicates these reinforcements were the repatriated former garrison of Valenciennes, who by the terms of surrender were supposed to be non-combatant.Burne, p. 82 Jourdan was then transferred to command troops at the Cassel entrenched camp and replaced at Bergues by Leclaire. With the able assistance of his chief of staff, the young Lazare Hoche, Souham, and later Jacques Ferrand were able to act vigorously to bolster the demoralised defenders. On the 24th York's reserve column (Austrian troops plus the flank companies of the British and Hessian regiments)Officer of the Guards I p. 103 under the Austrian Feldmarschall-Leutnant Graf Eduard d'Alton took the suburb of Rosenthal and bundled the French back inside the walls of the town. \\"We suffered very little from their musketry, because they never attempted to dispute the ground with us, but kept firing and retreating; but they no sooner got under cover of their own guns, than they began to open upon us with both grape and round shot, and in our retreat to a convenient cover, we suffered considerably\\".Brown, p.,71 York reported, \\"Unfortunately the ardour and gallantry of the troops carried them too far in spite of a peremptory order from me, three times repeated, they pursued the enemy upon the glacis of the place when we had the misfortune to lose many very brave and reliable men by the grapeshot from the town.\\" Burne, p. 70 Fortescue says York lost almost 400 casualties,Fortescue, p. 228 though the Officer of the Guards gives returns as Austrians 170, British 74 and Hessians 55 killed and wounded.Officer of the Guards I, p. 104 The casualties included d'Alton, who was shot and killed towards the end of the day.Smith-Kudrna, \\"Eduard D'Alton\\" Thereafter York's command began entrenching in a line from Tetteghem to the sea. Confidence was high, however York was about to face a number of disappointments. Dundas had omitted to provide York with adequate equipment for a siege, and most importantly no heavy siege artillery. Siege guns had been due to arrive at Nieuport on the 26th, but the only vessels in sight were French gunboats that began bombarding York's right seaward flank with impunity. On 27 August, transports arrived to disembark the gun crews but no guns. On 30 August Admiral John MacBride arrived to coordinate naval operations, but without any fleet.Fortescue, p. 230 Equally worrying for York was the news of a further check on the Dutch forces of the Prince of Orange near Menin on the 28th, which widened the gap between his command and that of the main Austrian Army further south. Though he could ill afford it, York dispatched six squadrons of Hessian cavalry to bolster the Dutch line.York's report, quoted in Burne p. 71 York was in a difficult position. Souham had opened the town sluices, which slowly inundated the fields connecting York to Freytag and filled British trenches on the dunes with two feet of water.Fortescue p. 234 \\"The inundations increasing daily, rendered the ground, on which the British encamped, a perfect swamp\\", and soon \\"An epidemical disorder called the Dunkirk Fever, soon broke out amongst the troops, increased daily, and carried off the soldiers rapidly\\".Officer of the Guards I p. 105 York hadn't the man-power to invest Dunkirk on more than one side, so the French were able to reinforce the town at any time; his right flank was constantly bombarded by French gunboats, and he had no siege equipment. In the end the British were only able to find ordnance by disarming a frigate at Furnes; these cannons arrived by canal at Dunkirk on the 27th.Brown p. 73 York's retreat On 6 September Houchard led the French forces at the Cassel entrenched camp against Freytag's covering Hanoverian corps at the Battle of Hondshoote. On the same day the defenders of Dunkirk made a strong sally in order to pin down York's command, the focus of the attack being Alvinczi's Austrians on York's right flank. This assault was beaten back after intense close-quarter fighting and very considerable loss on both sides, Powell records the 14th Foot had 9 out of 11 officers injured and 253 men killed and wounded.Powell p.13 One of the killed this day was York's chief of Engineers Colonel James Moncrief.Brown p.73/74 On York's left flank Freytag's Hanoverians were eventually driven back to the town of Hondschoote. Since Freytag was wounded and briefly captured by the French before being rescued, Johann Ludwig, Reichsgraf von Wallmoden-Gimborn took command of the covering force. On the 8th Houchard attacked and forced Wallmoden to withdraw after a very hard defence. With news of his left flank exposed the Duke of York gave orders for his heavy baggage to be withdrawn to Veurne (Furnes), then at a Council of War on the 8th it was decided to lift the siege of Dunkirk. Souham had rendered the canal unusable for transport, so the 24-pounder naval guns had to be spiked and abandoned. At 11.00 on the evening of the 8th York's corps began withdrawing to the coastal city of Veurne in Belgium, with Erskine commanding the rearguard. Progress was hindered by the weather and baggage, much of which was abandoned, Furnes was reached by 7.00 the next morning where contact was made with the remnants of Wallmoden's troops. York then moved off towards Diksmuide, leaving Abercromby behind at Veurne with 3,000 men, which remained until the 14th before marching through pouring rain to Thurout.Powell p.14 Aftermath On 11 September MacBride's fleet finally appeared off Nieuport, three weeks too late.Fortescue p.240 Out of a total of 29,700 infantry and 5,400 cavalry in the whole operation, the Coalition forces lost 2,000 killed and wounded, plus a great many more to sickness due to the swampy environment. The Officer of the Guards estimated a total loss of 10,000 men (which probably includes the casualties from Hondschoote). In addition, they abandoned the 32 requisitioned naval guns to the French. The 8,000-man French garrison suffered 1,000 casualties, plus 14 guns, two mortars, six ammunition wagons, 17 colors, and three standards captured. Assessment Alfred BurneBurne p.73-83 devotes several pages assessing the Siege of Dunkirk and Hondschoote, including much of the Duke of York's subsequent correspondence to the King. York ends his report: \\"I think therefore that I am justified in saying that there were three grand causes which made this expedition miscarry: the first owing to the promises and assurances I received from your Majesty's Ministers not being in any way fulfilled; the second owing to the alteration made in the plan of campaign by the Armies of the King of Prussia and of General Wurmser, by which means the enemy was able to bring the whole of the Army of the Moselle against the Field Marshal and Me; and the third owing to the Field Marshal's (i.e. Freytag's) own conduct.\\" An officer wrote to the Morning Chronicle just two days after the battle of Hondschoote: \\"There is but one sentiment throughout the whole camp. If the gun-boats and floating batteries had been ready, according to the express promise to co-operate with the Duke of York, and if his alacrity had been at all seconded on the part of the officers in England there is no doubt that Dunkirk would have fallen at the first attack. Every man that has since perished... is to be set down to the score of the ministers, who have sacrificed their duty to the holiday mummery of camps or to the amusements of partridge shooting\\".quoted in Burne p.80 Burne also points out the oft-overlooked fact that the French broke the terms of capitulation at Valenciennes, which dictated that released prisoners were not to fight again, and sent repatriated prisoners-of-war straight to reinforce the garrison of Dunkirk. \\"Had the French not broken the terms of capitulation of Valenciennes and used its garrison for the relief of Dunkirk, that town would probably have fallen.\\"Burne p.82 Historian Digby Smith argues that Dunkirk represented a missed opportunity. He blames the British government for its insistence on mounting this operation instead of properly supporting their Austrian allies against the French field armies.Smith, p 54 Burne, however, believes that although it transgresses the principle of concentration, in this case, it is extremely doubtful whether the Austrians would have marched on Paris without first taking Maubeuge and Quesnoy; therefore the British army was better employed capturing Dunkirk than helping the Austrians take Quesnoy.Burne p.82 References=FootnotesBibliography= *. *. *. *. * Harvey, R.

This plot continues in Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Hard Luck, where he ditches Greg for his new girlfriend Abigail. At the end of the book, the couple breaks up and he becomes friends with Greg again. Rowley has what Greg considers strange interests for his age and gender, such as liking a singer for \\"six-year-old girls\\" named Joshie and action figures Greg believes are for younger kids. Rowley is also the owner of the comic strip Zoo Wee Mama. Rowley claims that Greg had nothing to do with the comic strip in the first book, a rare antagonistic move from him. In the movie series, Rowley is portrayed by Robert Capron, in the first three movies and Owen Asztalos in The Long Haul. Frank Heffley Frank Heffley is Greg's overactive but well-meaning father. He is 36 years old in the first book and he is interested in U.S. history, and his replica of a Civil War battlefield is a plot point in the series. Frank is edgy around Rowley, does not appreciate Greg's skill at video games, loathes heavy metal, and adolescents. He tries to toughen Greg up and threatens to send him to a military academy in The Last Straw, although ultimately this does not come to fruition, much to Greg's relief. However, Greg and Frank grow together in Dog Days, despite a brief period when Frank does not speak to Greg after almost getting arrested. Frank is addicted to junk food; in The Last Straw, he makes a New Year's Resolution to go on a strict diet, but Greg later catches him in the garage eating brownies. After Greg is forced to go for several days without any snacks due to a thief taking them, he eventually decides to catch the thief, and discovers that it is Frank. Frank is portrayed by Steve Zahn in the first three films of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid film series. In Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul, he is played by Tom Everett Scott. Susan Heffley Susan Heffley (known as Ann Heffley in the online version) is the mother of Manny, Gregory, and Rodrick. She is a loving and caring mother but can be embarrassing, bossy, hypocritical, dimwitted, overprotective, and naive. Susan doesn't like technology thinking it doesn't make people socialize. She seems to have a very small knowledge of kid's Rodrick and Greg's age and constantly humiliates and ignores them. She constantly tries to get the family together which never works out. She and her husband Frank also shows immense favoritism towards their youngest son Manny. Susan is portrayed by Rachael Harris in the first three films and Alicia Silverstone in the fourth film. Manny Heffley Manny Heffley is Greg and Rodrick's three-year-old brother who is constantly spoiled and pampered by his parents. Manny has many uncaring and selfish grudges like nearly killing the family by knocking out the power of the house in Cabin Fever and having tantrums when not getting things his way. It is also likely Manny knows his parent's favoritism towards him and he often takes advantage of it like making money out of the no swearing rule, breaking Greg's items and getting away with it, never getting in trouble for his actions and often passing the blame towards Greg or Rodrick, etc. Despite being a spoiled three year old, Manny has proven to have more intelligence then he poses like figuring out how to sell all of Greg's items in Net Kritterz account and managed to change the password and locks out the whole family from watching TV by using the parental lock to only watch his favourite cartoons. However, Manny's strange behavior can also help the family as in the Long Haul he speaks fluent Spanish to help the family get home. He is played by Owen Fielding in the first three films and is played by Wyatt Walters in the Long Haul. Rodrick Heffley Rodrick Heffley is Greg's lazy and aggressive older brother. He is 16 years old in the first book and he is the drummer in a garage band called \\"L√∂ded Diper\\" (loaded diaper), noted for their substandard heavy metal concerts and limited musical abilities. Rodrick is not an exception to Frank's notorious distrust of all teenagers. Rodrick is infamous for his stereotypical rebellious nature, feigning illness in Rodrick Rules so as to be allowed to remain at home to throw a chaotic house party during his parents' absence, only for the evidence to appear in newly developed photographs that are discovered by the boys' parents just after Thanksgiving. He bullies Greg a lot and pulls awful pranks that ruin Greg's and his family's life. Rodrick also possesses incompetent tendencies, as his school assignments are notoriously crude and inadequate. Rodrick also makes numerous idiotic mistakes, such as believing a mini-safe is a microwave and cinnamon bun dough which had exploded all over the car was his brains. His spelling abilities are also poor, and he devotes a lot of time to tormenting Greg. He also does not know how to type, and on one occasion, when he has to type one of his assignments, he types one letter a minute and repeatedly has to ask Frank where the space bar is. In the books, Rodrick owns and drives a white van, which sports his band's name written in large black letters, on either side of it and lacks any back seats, the reason being that Rodrick needs room for his band equipment. In the movie series, the van is revealed to be a 1996 Chevrolet Astro AWD van, which also sports a diaper's pin drawn on the rear doors. In Rodrick Rules, Greg is haunted by the fact that Rodrick knows about his most mortifying experience during the summertime. This haunts him when he returns to school. However, his fears are quickly eased after the story becomes distorted to Greg's advantage due to it being passed around by so many people, temporarily boosting his popularity. By the end of the film adaptation of Rodrick Rules, he is much closer to Greg, and his actions to him become much less aggressive. This is also shown in the film adaptation of Dog Days when Rodrick thanks Greg for getting him a gig at Heather Hills' Sweet 16, also this was not seen in the book. In the first three films in the film series based on the books, Rodrick is played by Devon Bostick. In the fourth film, Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul, Rodrick is played by Charlie Wright. Greg's extended family Family tree of Greg's extended family =Gramma= Gramma is Susan's mother and Greg's maternal grandmother. Gramma is known to drive a car like the Heffleys'. Greg often calls her to his home as a way to avoid his dad's scoldings, since his father will not do this when she is around. Her favorite grandchild is Manny, although she denies and lies about this despite overwhelming evidence in the form of pictures on her refrigerator and many of Manny's drawings around her house. She also seems to have a passion for bingo and knitting. Gramma has a dog named Sweetheart, usually shortened to Sweetie. It has be said and shown that she overfeeds Sweetie. =Grandpa Heffley= Grandpa is Greg's unpredictable paternal grandfather, who is asked to babysit Rodrick and his brother in Rodrick Rules. He lives in a retirement home called Leisure Towers and enjoys playing games such as \\"Gutbusters\\" and \\"Rummy\\", which the two boys find boring. He never watches any real shows on the television; instead he constantly has his television tuned to the CCTV in the retirement home lobby, which he spends his time watching. In Old School, he moves out of Leisure Towers because the rent is too high and moves in with the Heffleys. Grandpa has a girlfriend named Darlene in the Hard Luck and broke up with her in Old School. Grandpa dates online. Grandpa eventually accumulates a large number of girlfriends online, culminating in him accidentally inviting all of them over and throwing a party with them. Greg is his favorite. Grandpa is known for preparing what he calls \\"Watercress Salad\\", a disgusting dish consisting of cold green beans and cucumbers floating in vinegar. Greg hates Watercress Salad, and Rodrick is aware of this, so he pretends that Greg loves it and puts a large helping onto his plate. It's stated that Grandpa never spent much time with Frank when he was a boy, and they seem to have a poor relationship. Grandpa once accidentally ran over Frank's dog with his car and lied to him about it (claiming that the dog ran away) before telling him many years later, expecting a laugh, and constantly criticizes Frank during his stay at the Heffleys' house. He has not been seen since Double Down, implying that he possibly moved out. =Joe Heffley= Joe Heffley is Frank's brother and Greg's uncle. Frank has a sibling rivalry with Joe due to his actions. When Manny started potty training, Uncle Joe told him to watch out for the \\"potty monster\\", causing him to fear using the bathroom, forcing Frank to change his diapers for a longer time. Uncle Joe's children call their uncle \\"Aunt Fwank\\", which Frank swears he told them to do on purpose. Susan thinks it's cute, though. In Dog Days, Greg mentions that he tried to make Uncle Joe convince Frank to get a dog, but that did not work out. He also mentions that Joe's dog, Killer ate most of his birthday cake. =Joe Heffley's Wife= Joe Heffley's wife is a dark-haired woman and Greg's aunt. Her name is not revealed. =Joe Heffley's Children= Joe Heffley has at least three children, who all appear to be a bit older than Manny, and are Greg's cousins. They all call Frank \\"Aunt Fwank.\\" =Great-Uncle Charlie= Charlie is Nana's brother and Greg's great uncle. He is also Greg's \\"secret weapon\\" at Christmas, as he asks him to buy him presents that his parents have forbidden him from receiving. However, this backfires as he is usually given the wrong thing. Charlie is a bachelor and spends his spare money well. Greg says he wants to follow in his footsteps. In The Last Straw, Charlie got Greg a laundry hoop, hinting that he is tired of being Greg's secret weapon at Christmas, as the events that transpired meant that Greg effectively got a chore for Christmas. =Loretta (n√©e Heffley)= Loretta is Greg's great-aunt and the sister of Grandpa, Arthur, and Reba. She got a thank you note for some pants she gave Greg at Christmas. She appeared mainly in Rodrick Rules at the Thanksgiving dinner. She also appeared a couple of times in the Do It Yourself Book and The Ugly Truth. It is implied that Greg and Rodrick dislike her, as they fight over who has to greet her first when she visits. =Aunt Veronica= Aunt Veronica is Greg's aunt and Susan's sister. Greg states that she has never been seen in person since he was three or four years old, probably because being with the family in person stresses her out, but calls her family members on video chat. When Greg was sitting on the toilet playing games on his new phone (which was actually a hand-me-down from his mother), she accidentally started a video chat with him. This startled him, leading to him dropping the phone into the toilet. She appears in Hard Luck multiple times ‚Äì often in person ‚Äì but on other occasions by video conference on a tablet and the used phone that Susan gave to Greg. =Gammie Heffley= Gammie is Greg's great-grandmother and the unofficial head of the Heffley family. She only appears in The Ugly Truth, as a minor character. She also has Lego building bricks that Susan bought so that her kids had something to do at her house. Gammie is a trickster and knows a lot because of \\"experience\\". When someone in the family is about 12 or 13 years old she gives them The Talk, which is about how kids should not be hurrying to grow up. Gammie loves having visitors for dinner. One day she bought a scratch ticket, and matched up two pictures and told all her family members that she had won a lot of money. Everyone was in a big rush to visit her. When they all arrived Frank told Gammie that to win, she had to match up three pictures. When she found this out, she did not care. She pulled a roast right out of the oven, and Greg figures she got what she wanted anyway. Gammie is the mother of Grandpa, Arthur, Reba, and Loretta Heffley. Gammie is briefly mentioned by Greg in Cabin Fever when he says she gave a miniature carousel that held spoons from all over the world to Greg's family five or six years before. =Reba (n√©e Heffley)= Reba was Greg's great-aunt. Gammie forgot to give her an invitation at Christmas, but she came anyway. She only appeared in The Ugly Truth. She is stubborn. She and Loretta are identical twins. Reba was the sister of Grandpa, Loretta, and Arthur Heffley. In Wrecking Ball, it was revealed that she died in her sleep, and Greg's family attended someone else's funeral instead of hers by mistake. Greg forgot about Reba at first, until Susan reminded him that she used to send him angry letters for forgetting to send her thank-you notes for his birthday money. =Gary Heffley= Garrison \\"Gary\\" Heffley is Greg's uncle and has been married four times. In The Ugly Truth it is revealed that all of his wives divorced him as soon as they found out about his financial situation and job. He has had so many weddings that Greg's family does not need to use a growth chart. In The Third Wheel he comes to live with Greg's family after he discovers his job selling shirts in Boston was a ripoff. Later in the book he is chosen to be the DJ at Greg's Valentine's Day dance. =Aunt Dorothy= Dorothy is Greg's great aunt who always kisses him on the lips. Greg's mother, Susan, says it is rude to wipe off the kisses Dorothy gives him, but Greg wipes his face on the nearest available curtain when no one is looking. She is overweight and sometimes passes gas loudly. = Arthur Heffley = Arthur Heffley is Greg's great- uncle. He only speaks in grunts or makes random sounds. He never has an actual conversation with anybody, but sometimes Greg tries to respond to him just in case he is trying to communicate. Arthur is the brother of Reba, Grandpa, and Loretta Heffley. =Great Uncle Bruce= Great Uncle Bruce is Greg's deceased great-uncle. He is a character who is mentioned in Cabin Fever and The Third Wheel. Greg is presented with a rather luxurious blanket as a Christmas gift, only to be repelled by it upon learning that it had formerly belonged to Great Uncle Bruce before his death. In The Third Wheel, Greg uses Great Uncle Bruce's old cologne on Valentine's Day, which ends up attracting some old ladies. =Byron Heffley= Byron is Frank's cousin whom Greg is not excited to see because, at Gammie's last family meeting, he was sent out to get milk, but hit a pothole halfway home, and got a flat tire. Greg had to get him. He needed supplies, so Greg returned to Gammie's. Because of his muddy shoes, the ladies needed to warn him because he was about to track mud into the house. Unfortunately, he forgot about Byron's tire, and he was not happy when he got to Gammie's. He only appears in The Ugly Truth. =Aunt Audra= Aunt Audra is one of Susan's sisters. She believes in crystal balls and took Greg along with her to see her fortuneteller a few times. Susan thinks Audra is wasting her money. The fortuneteller also told Audra that Meemaw's ring was inside a photo album. It turned out the fortuneteller did not mean it literally. =Aunt Gretchen= Aunt Gretchen is Susan's youngest sister. She has two out-of- control twin sons, Malvin and Malcolm. Aunt Gretchen has at least thirty pets. In Hard Luck, her rabbit has a litter of bunnies, angering Frank. =Malvin and Malcolm= Malvin and Malcolm are Gretchen's two sons. They are out-of- control kids. Once, they played throw and catch with a strong sharp piece of concrete. Malvin had to go to the emergency room to get stitches in his forehead. Malcolm is the wilder. He once got hold of Frank's shaving kit and shaved himself. He also called the police to report Greg's family for running out of ketchup. This results in Frank angrily making them leave. =Meemaw and Peepaw= Meemaw and Peepaw are the parents of Gramma and her two sisters and are the maternal grandparents of Susan. Their first appearance was in Hard Luck. Peepaw is portrayed as old and batty. Meemaw is dead, while Peepaw is still alive. Meemaw was in charge of putting prizes in the Easter eggs and wore a diamond ring, which was extremely valuable because it had been in her family for three generations. Before she died, she accidentally put her ring in an Easter egg that was found by Greg at the end of the book. Meemaw appears in the film adaption of The Long Haul played by Mimi Gould. Meemaw's birthday results in Susan's \\"great Heffley road trip\\". Rowley's family=Robert Jefferson= Mr. Jefferson is Rowley's father and is far more shrill than Mr. Heffley. He is extremely rude and paranoid and does not accept any criticism from anyone of himself or his property. He is the strictest father in the series so far. He will not let Rowley play any video game with the slightest bit of violence or fighting in it, as he thinks doing this could change Rowley into a different person. Mr. Jefferson dislikes Greg, whom he thinks is a \\"bad influence\\" on his son. After Greg and Rowley invent their own secret language, which Mr. Jefferson cracks, he sends Greg home early. It is also shown that Mr. Jefferson had a close bond with Rowley. He shows little interest in sports until Dog Days, where he is found playing tennis with Rowley and golf with a caddy. In Dog Days, it is revealed that Mr. Jefferson's first name is Robert. When Susan emailed him because of the note Greg sent her, it had Mr. Jefferson's first name on it. In \\"Old School\\", he is stuck chaperoning the group of extra kids (which includes Rowley and Greg), much to Greg's dismay. Later, Rowley adds poison ivy to a fire started by him and he has problems breathing the next morning, which means he and Rowley (who had spots on his body) would be going back home. In the film series, Mr. Jefferson has not spoken until the third film, implying that he is a man of a few words. =Linda Jefferson= Mrs. Jefferson is Rowley's mother. She often seems to be concerned about Rowley, such as the time he broke his big toe after Greg put one of his dad's dumbbells under a pillow that Rowley kept kicking at Greg's sleepover. She also had Greg apologize to her for what he did to Rowley. Despite this, Mrs. Jefferson always enjoys Greg's company with Rowley. Although Mrs. Jefferson loves Greg, she does not let him come over because her husband dislikes him. On day 24 of the online version, it is revealed that her first name is Linda from Greg's The Boy Whose Family Thinks He's a DOG comic. In the film adaptations, Rowley's mother is portrayed by Kaye Capron in Diary of a Wimpy Kid (who in turn is the real-life mother of Robert Capron, the actor who plays Rowley) and by Bronwen Smith in Dog Days. Other characters=Fregley= Fregley is Greg's acquaintance and neighbor noted for his many odd or disgusting eccentricities. He has been known to perplex others with his behavior and does not have any known friends. Greg has been forced to hang around with Fregley on several occasions, to his chagrin or aggravation. It has been mentioned that Fregley is prohibited from eating sugar by his parents, and the consumption of it in large quantities will send him into hysterical, uncontrollable frenzies. After Greg inadvertently causes the Snella family to move away due to a foul smell which (unknown to the Snellas) was caused by Greg dumping deviled eggs into a plastic plant, he decides that he should find a way of sneaking deviled eggs into Fregley's house. In the film adaptations of the books, Fregley is played by Grayson Russell. =Preston Mudd= Preston Mudd is one of Greg's classmates. He is said to have been the best player in the basketball unit of gym class during sixth grade at Westmore Middle School. Unfortunately, when his name was displayed as \\"P. Mudd\\", this led to his classmates making fun of him, calling him \\"Pee Mud\\". =Christopher Brownfield= Christopher Brownfield is one of Greg's friends and is shown to have been a great mosquito magnet while hanging out with Greg in the summer. However, Greg does not see him as a close friend because he is \\"not a school-year friend\\". Later in \\"The Ugly Truth\\", he is on Greg's team for a game and hides behind a soda machine after the teachers threaten to call all of their parents. =Tyson Sanders= Tyson Sanders is a friend of Greg who appears in \\"The Ugly Truth\\". He is mentioned at the beginning along with Christopher when Greg is considering new best friends, and mentions that although Tyson is nice and into the same video games as Greg, he is turned off by the fact Tyson pulls his pants all the way down when using the urinal. When they play a game of \\"Guess Who?\\", the team takes a picture of Tyson's bent arm, which gets them disqualified as the chaperones think the picture is of his buttocks. However, the misunderstanding is later cleared up after a mole near Tyson's elbow is matched to one shown in the picture. Greg remarks that everyone should know what Tyson's buttocks look like due to his habit of pulling his pants all the way down when using the urinal. =Holly Hills= Holly Hills is one of Greg's classmates; an older girl who primarily serves as Greg's unrequited romantic interest and also Heather Hills' younger sister. She is the youngest daughter of Mr. Hills and Mrs. Hills. A minor character, she earns a prominent role in The Last Straw as the object of Greg's most recent infatuation. He is continuously motivated to impress her to no avail. Virtually oblivious to Greg's existence or identity (Greg stops trying to impress her after she mistakes him for Fregley), she appears to take an interest in Rowley's sweetness, judging by an enthusiastic message which she had signed in his yearbook (as opposed to the note that she had written for the envious Greg). She seldom appears afterward. Greg's interest in her is seemingly damaged by events such as this and he starts showing an interest in other girls, including Holly's older sister Heather. Whereas her personality is hardly explored in the books, Holly's role was increased in film adaptions, debuting in Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules as a newcomer to Greg's school with whom he is instantly besotted. She is depicted as being friendly and good-natured. The relationship she shares with Greg and Rowley is emphasized and exaggerated in the film portrayals, to the extent it can be assumed that the feelings Greg has for her may be mutual. She reappears in Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days. Holly seems to enjoy the boys' companionship and shows gratitude for Rodrick Heffley's unintentional blunders that wind up destroying the undeserving Heather's birthday party. The party ends with Holly slipping her hand into Greg's, implying that she likes him as well, and she, Greg and Rowley had a pool party not long after. Holly is portrayed in the movies by Peyton R. List. =Chirag Gupta= Chirag Gupta is an Indian American who serves as one of Greg's schoolmates and a minor character in the books. He is characterized by his short stature. Although he and Greg are well-acquainted and generally amiable to one another, Greg started the \\"Invisible Chirag\\" prank in Rodrick Rules. During the summer the Gupta family were to move away but an unexplained alteration in their plans changed this. As a result, Chirag's classmates teasingly ignore his presence for days on end, which aggravates and shocks him. Greg is called into Mr. Roy's office and is severely reprimanded, but Mr. Roy gets the identity of the victim wrong. After Greg apologises to a completely different student, who does not understand why Greg is apologising, Mr. Roy lets him go. However, after Susan gets a phone call from Chirag's father, she brings Greg to Chirag's house and orders him to apologise. Mr. Gupta is not impressed, but Chirag accepts the apology and forgives Greg. Though Chirag has forgiven Greg and his fellow schoolmates for concocting the prank, it is mentioned in one book that he takes advantage of his family's non-observance of the Christmas holiday, and no obligation to behave for Santa Claus, to pick on Greg. In the movie adaptions, Chirag's role is enhanced and he is a close friend of Greg and Rowley. He also plays a considerably more prominent role in these films, appearing in adaptions of books in which he is absent or hardly mentioned. He is portrayed by American actor Karan Brar, who is of Indian ancestry. =Patty Farrell= Patty Farrell is a minor character who shares an intense rivalry with Greg, which is showcased on a few occasions. It is implied she is a hardworking but sanctimonious and domineering student. She earns Greg's animosity after she suggests a map of the United States displayed in the classroom be covered during a geography quiz. Greg had planned to cheat using the map and this causes great difficulties for him, and makes him agitated. Motivated by his lust for revenge, he volunteers to play a tree in the school's upcoming production of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\"after viewing the movie adaption for the first time. He believes the role entails having to bombard the character of Dorothy Gale (whom Patty would be portraying in the play) with apples, only to learn that this scene was deleted for the school production. He winds up re-enacting this scene, despite the script, and the other trees join in. However, the play has to be shut down after Patty's glasses are broken, as Patty is short-sighted. She has yet to play quite as significant a role in the book series again. She has become something of a minor recurring character whose appearances are rare. In the film adaptions of the books, Patty's role is enhanced slightly. She is depicted as being monstrously demanding. Her parents are involved with the school board in this portrayal. The motivation given for her hatred of Greg is his recital of an offensive playground chant poking fun at her that sent her bursting into tears in elementary school. She appears in the film adaptations of all three films Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Diary of a Wimpy Kid; Rodrick Rules and Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days. Alterations made to the books include her talent for both wrestling and playing tennis. She snatches any opportunity to assault Greg somehow while engaged in either sport with him. She is portrayed in the movies by Laine MacNeil. =Heather Hills= Heather Hills is the attractive elder sister of Holly Hills, with whom Rodrick is infatuated. A minor character in the books, but the main antagonist in the third film, Heather is only featured in several books as the object of Greg's unrequited infatuation. However, she seems oblivious to this. A student attending Westmore High School with Rodrick, she has had several minor occupations throughout the books, during each of which Rodrick fecklessly attempts to grab her attention or to impress her. Little insight into her personality is provided in the book series. Heather only appears in the third movie in the film series, Dog Days wherein personality and role is further enhanced similar to her younger sister, Holly. In a modification of the events of the books, she is depicted as the spoiled, obnoxious, rude, ignorant, selfish, conceited, ungrateful, unforgiving, cold- hearted, and demanding oldest daughter of the Hills family who often mistreats her family and acquaintances. A lovelorn Rodrick Heffley and his band are hired to perform at Heather's ostentatious upcoming sixteenth birthday party on the suggestion by Greg himself. In an attempt to earn her admiration, Rodrick sings lead on the band's cover of Justin Bieber and Ludacris's hit song \\"Baby\\" (while his bandmate plays drums), which he claims is her favorite song, but chaos ensues when the band switches from the song's original, dance- infused pop tempo to an extremely wild, boisterous, punk rock version of the song wherein Rodrick inadvertently messes with the decorations. This angers Heather and the party ends in disaster. She is portrayed in Dog Days by Melissa Roxburgh. =Albert Sandy= Albert Sandy is a minor character, who talks often about rumors he has heard. The validity of his statements is unconfirmed. One of the statements which were not confirmed by Greg was when Albert told him that \\"it was medically impossible for a girl to fart\\". Some make no sense, for example, he said a man got decapitated when he sneezed. Albert has appeared in The Last Straw, The Ugly Truth, Old School, Double Down, The Meltdown, and Wrecking Ball. =The Snellas= First appearing in The Last Straw, The Snellas are a family that lives in the Heffleys' neighborhood. They have a lot of children, all of whom are male, with names beginning with the letter S. Five of the children's names are revealed, and they are (from oldest to youngest): Shawn, Shane, Sam, Scott, and Seth. In The Last Straw, it is revealed that each Snella child has a half birthday party at which the adults perform funny stunts, to attempt to make the babies laugh. According to Greg, however, no baby has laughed once. Mr. Snella then sends the videos to America's Funniest Families, a spoof and parody of America's Funniest Home Videos, and has never won anything (though after Greg is filmed wearing Wonder Woman underwear hanging off a tree with his trousers below his ankles at the end of The Last Straw, the footage is sent, and it is never explained if Mr. Snella won with it). Their most recent appearance was in The Ugly Truth when they move to another house because of a strange smell they cannot get rid of in their home. The smell was deviled eggs, which Greg hates and threw into one of their plant pots when he was having dinner at their house. Despite trying to find the cause of the smell, the Snellas cannot figure it out and eventually just move. Greg feels guilty when he sees that they are taking the plant pot with them, but he resolves to try to find a way to sneak deviled eggs into Fregley's house. =Scotty Douglas= Scotty is a first grader from Rowley's karate class. In Rodrick Rules, Scotty was going to do a magic act in the Talent Show with Rowley as his assistant. But after Greg breaks Rowley's big toe, he has to fill in for Rowley. Greg complains about being a magician's assistant to Scotty, but Susan tells Scotty's mother that Greg would be happy to replace Rowley. Scotty has a remarkably similar appearance to Greg's comic character, Creighton The Cretin, except Creighton's eyes are wide open and Scotty's eyes are beady just like all the other characters that do not wear glasses. In The Ugly Truth, he becomes the new Peachy Breeze kid, yet cannot say the slogan right. Between Rodrick Rules and The Ugly Truth it appears that Scotty has two siblings - an unnamed baby sister and an older brother. In The Third Wheel, when Greg and Rowley become private investigators Greg looks through the window at his house to find him playing one of Greg's video games with Rowley. He appeared in the film adaptation of Rodrick Rules, with only a few lines. He is portrayed by Jakob Davies. =Mr. Underwood= Mr. Underwood is Greg's P.E. coach. In the film series, he is named Coach Malone. He is portrayed by Andrew McNee. =Bill Walter= Bill Walter is a 35-year-old unemployed high school drop out, guitarist and professional singer, who has a rude attitude towards everyone he meets. Rodrick idolizes him and his lifestyle. In the novel Rodrick Rules, he was voted \\"Most Likely to Be a Rock Star\\" which influenced Rodrick to persuade him to join the band. Frank Heffley strongly dislikes Bill because he disapproves of his lifestyle, and is afraid Rodrick will follow in his footsteps. In the movie version of Rodrick Rules, he is portrayed by Fran Kranz and is an antagonist. He agrees to join Rodrick's rock band Loded Diper and later attempts to kick him out for an unknown reason. After performing the song Exploded Diper, Rodrick retaliates and kicks him out. In the book Greg describes him as unemployed and still living with his parents. Also, in Rodrick Rules Bill appears to be a slob, as he \\"slorks\\" pot roast. =Dr. Salazar Kagan= Dr. Kagan, Frank's dentist, makes his debut in The Ugly Truth. Frank takes Greg to Dr. Kagan instead of his usual dentist, a pretty woman named Rachel on whom Greg has a crush. Dr. Kagan has a very different approach to dentistry than Rachel. When Greg admits to drinking soda, Dr. Kagan is infuriated, and shows Greg a jar of liquid with a badly eroded tooth in it, telling him that it is a real tooth that was left in a jar of soda for 24 hours. Greg accidentally bites Dr. Kagan's finger when his teeth are being checked. In what Greg believes to be an act of revenge, Dr. Kagan tells Frank that Greg needs headgear to correct his overbite. Greg later loses his headgear, and discovers that Manny took it. He declares that he will never wear the headgear again irrespective of what Dr. Kagan says. Greg says Dr. Kagan is scary and evil and that he never fools around. He has sharp metal tools, which he leaves on full display, and never smiles. The billboards for Dr. Kagan's dental practice make Greg freak out every time he sees one of them on the highway. Dr. Kagan later makes a cameo in Double Down, in a scene where Greg describes how a Spineticklers book has made going to the dentist an even more frightening experience for him. =Lenwood Heath= Lenwood Heath only appears in The Last Straw. He is a rebellious teenager, who was Greg's father's arch-enemy for about three months before he was sent to military academy. This resulted in him becoming a fine young man who works at the movie theater. Greg's Dad now admires Lenwood, despite the history between the two of them. To Greg's horror, Dad decides to sign Greg up for the same military academy that Lenwood attended, leading to Greg taking measures to convince him to change his mind. In the Dog Days film, he is portrayed by Tom Stevens and is seen working as a lifeguard at the community pool the Heffleys go to. =Taylor Pringle= Taylor Pringle is a minor character who only appears in the films, Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules and Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days and does not appear in the books. She is a very rude little girl and is first seen at the end of the opening scene in Rodrick Rules in which during her birthday party at the roller rink, Rodrick embarrasses Greg, prompting Greg to try and tackle him, but he misses and face-plants in Taylor's birthday cake, destroying it. As a result of this, Taylor gets angry and she and her friends begin beating up Greg as the intro begins. Later in the film, during church, when Rodrick intentionally pulls down the sweater around Greg's waist to reveal the chocolate stain on Greg's pants, Taylor points it out to everyone, mistaking it for poop. Then, in Dog Days, when Greg attempts to impress Holly by jumping off the high diving board, he becomes nervous, due to it being very high above the water. Taylor then comes up behind Greg and states that he is talking to himself, due to being scared. When Greg gives Taylor a brush-off that he is not scared and that she would not understand since she is \\"just a little kid\\", she pressures him to jump. When Greg jumps, he loses his swimsuit on the board, and Taylor chucks it onto a nearby fence to get back at Greg for brushing her off. As a result, Greg is forced to borrow a girl's swimsuit that reads Holly on it until he goes to the fence to retrieve his own swimsuit, and as he does so, he gets taunted by Patty. Taylor is portrayed by Dalila Bela. =Jordan Jury= Only appearing in The Ugly Truth, Jordan Jury is the popular boy in the grade above Greg, who's known for always throwing huge parties that have little to no adult supervision. Greg is amazed when he discovers that he has been given a textbook that used to belong to him. Jordan invites Greg and Rowley to his latest party, but Greg cannot not go because of his Uncle Gary's fourth wedding. But at the end of the book, Greg discovers that he is lucky that he didn't go, because the only reason Jordan invited the kids in Greg and Rowley's grade was to use them as servants. =Angie Steadman= Angie Steadman only appears as an additional character in the Diary of a Wimpy Kid film. She is in seventh grade, has a pink streak of hair, works for the school newspaper, and hates middle school. In the film, Greg and Rowley meet her under the bleachers during a game of \\"Gladiator\\". She gets along with Rowley, but starts a rocky relationship with Greg after he egotistically declines her offer to join the school newspaper. Greg later tells the whole school he ate the cheese instead of Rowley and she compliments and accepts him when she sees that Greg is learning the errors of his ways. In the film, she is portrayed by Chlo√´ Grace Moretz. =Pete Hosey= Pete Hosey is the leader of the teenagers who attacked Greg and Rowley on Halloween. He is an antagonist in the first film. He is unnamed in the first book and he is replaced by Herbie Reamer in the online version. After hassling Greg and Rowley on Halloween, Greg yells that he will call the cops, and they chase him to Greg's grandmother's house. In the book, Greg and Rowley sneak back home, but in the movie, they try to intimidate Pete and his friends with a weed hacker, before Pete scratches his car and they are chased into the woods. In both the book and the movie, the teens hold a vendetta against Greg and Rowley. Near the end they corner them on the school field and decide to force them to eat the moldy cheese. Rowley is forced to eat the cheese, but Greg avoids it by saying he's lactose intolerant. In the movie they are chased off by the coach. =The Warrens= Although his family is vaguely referenced in the books, the Warren's are what got Frank thinking of making Greg more manly. In the books, Mr. Warren is Frank's boss. Frank is deeply jealous of the Warrens. In stark contrast to Greg, the Warrens' children are shown to be athletic and sporty. In the third film, Stan, the father of the family, is shown to be a neighbor of the Heffleys. He had a minor childhood rivalry with Frank, that they appear to have gotten over as adults. In the movie, Mr. Warren is the troop master of the Wilderness Explorers, and invites everyone over for an Independence Day party. They only appear in Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw. =The Beardos= Only appearing in The Long Haul, the Beardos are the main antagonists of the book. They are a couple with three sons. The Heffleys indirectly met them during their road trip, though only Greg knows who they are. Their first encounter is at a motel, where Greg angrily berates one of the Beardo children, who then tells his father on him, causing Greg to fear running into them again. Greg and his family are convinced that the Beardos have stolen their luggage and belongings at a place they both attended called \\"Soak Central.\\" They try to track them down though it was revealed at the end that Greg actually had the key to their locker in Soak Central, and that he got the number in the lottery. Their belongings were there. The family's real surname is unknown, as Greg himself does not who they are. It is likely he dubbed them this because of the patriarch's noticeably long beard. In the film adaption of The Long Haul, Mr. and Mrs. Beardo are portrayed by Chris Coppola and Kimberli Lincoln and have a daughter named Brandi and two sons named Brandon and Brent. The Beardos are depicted as much more malicious, with Mr. Beardo chasing Greg around through the carnival to get revenge. =Chris= Chris is a friend of Rodrick and the bassist of L√∂ded Diper. =Joshie= Joshie is a singer who is famous in Europe and is Rowley's favorite singer and idol. Greg believes that Joshie is for six-year-old girls, but Rowley ignores him, saying that Greg is jealous because he was the one who \\"discovered\\" Joshie. However, despite Rowley's opinion, Joshie appears to be a singer that is mainly idolized by females. =Maddox Selsam= Maddox Selsam is a boy who lives in the middle of the woods. He is not allowed to have any screen time, and does not have a TV at his house. He enjoys playing with his Legos and practicing his violin. He met Greg in Double Down when he found Greg's balloon for the Balloon Brigade at his school. Susan only likes him because he doesn't have electronics in his house and wants Maddox to be a role model for Greg; however, Maddox was rude to Greg. She gets angry at Greg instead of admitting her mistake about Maddox. Pets=Sweetie= Sweetie is a dog that first appeared in Dog Days. Greg's dad buys him after discovering that his father lied about accidentally killing his childhood dog, Nutty. Sweetie wreaks havoc in the Heffley household and is given to Gramma at the end of the book. Sweetie undergoes drastic weight gain at Gramma's house because he is fed many table scraps. Eventually Gramma dresses him up like a little human. Greg and Rodrick like playing with him by going up behind him and making flatulence sounds. He will then sniff his rear end until he goes to sleep. =The Pig= The Heffleys‚Äô pet pig was introduced in The Long Haul, in which Manny Heffley won it at a country fair for correctly guessing the weight of a hog. To the annoyance of Greg, the pig exhibits extraordinary intelligence and gains human characteristics. One running gag is that despite not having opposable thumbs, the pig opens objects such as soda cans. In The Meltdown the Pig throws a tantrum for being excluded from the trip to Isla de Corales in The Getaway. Frank sends it to obedience school, only for the Pig to escape on its second day there. The Pig is never found by the Heffleys despite numerous missing posters, and the pig's fate is left unclear.

She is now the chair of the Japan PEN Women Writers Committee and a member of the Science Fiction Writers of Japan.  \\"Textual harassment\\" lawsuit  On 1997, the publisher Media Works published a reference book, Alternative Culture, which contained an article describing Kotani's book Evangelion as the Immaculate Virgin describing her name as a pseudonym for her husband Takayuki Tatsumi a professor of English at Keio University. When her complaints were ignored, she sued the author of the entry (Hiroo Yamagata), the publisher and Shufu-no-Tomo-sha, the distributor of the book, for what she termed \\"textual harassment.\\" The lawsuit was broadly supported by Japanese writers. The Japan PEN Club established a Women Writer's Committee, with feminist critic Kazuko Saegusa as chair, and Kotani as sub- chair. During this period, Kotani and Maki Honda's translation of Joanna Russ' How to Suppress Women's Writing received by major feminist critics in Japan including Chizuko Ueno, Fukuko Kobayashi, Yuko Matsumoto, and Kazuko Takemura. In 2001 the defendants were ordered to pay Kotani 3,300,000 yen (roughly $27,500), and to publish an apology on the top page of their respective website.Report by Kotani on lawsuit results  Cosplay  Kotani was not the first cosplayer in Japan but she is the earliest documented instance of cosplay at a fan event in that country. She attended a costume party at the 17th Nihon SF Taikai (also known as \\"Ashinocon\\") science fiction convention in 1978 wearing a costume based on the cover art for Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel A Fighting Man of Mars. This costume has sometimes been misreported as a Triton costume (from the manga Triton of the Sea) due to its visual similarity and because Kotani was known at the time as a member of the TRITON fan club. She was one of about the twenty people at the event wearing a costume; the others were either members of the same Triton of the Sea fan club or of , the antecedent of the Gainax anime studio.

He ranks as one of the most prominent and successful generals in the thirty- year war between Emperor Basil II (r. 976‚Äì1025) and Samuel of Bulgaria (r. 997‚Äì1014), helping to end the long conflict by blinding and capturing the last Bulgarian leader, Ibatzes, in 1018. Biography The main source describing Daphnomeles's life, and indeed the Bulgarian campaigns (986‚Äì1018) of Emperor Basil II, is the late 11th century Synopsis Historion of John Skylitzes, whose chronology is often problematic to reconstruct. Daphnomeles came from the landed aristocracy of Asia Minor, which for centuries provided the Byzantine military elite. Traditional historiography places his first appearance in circa 1005, when the Adriatic port city of Dyrrhachium is said to have been surrendered by John Chryselios, a local magnate, to the Byzantines. Daphnomeles, at the head of a fleet, took possession of the city. Given the chronologically unclear narrative of Skylitzes, however, it is possible that this episode reflects his later appointment (after 1018) as strategos (military governor) of the city.. Map of the Byzantine‚ÄìBulgarian wars in the time of Emperor Basil II and Tsar Samuel of Bulgaria Daphnomeles participated in the subsequent conflicts against Tsar Samuel, but his greatest feat was the capture of the Bulgarian leader Ibatzes in 1018, for which he is given a prominent position in Skylitzes's work.. Following the defeat at the Battle of Kleidion in 1015, Bulgarian resistance began to collapse. By 1018, most Bulgarian commanders had surrendered, and only Ibatzes, who had retreated with his followers to the royal estate of Pronishte, a naturally strong and defensible highland position, continued to resist.. He rejected both bribes and threats from the Byzantines, and for 55 days, the Byzantine army under Emperor Basil II remained encamped at Deabolis nearby, waiting for his surrender. At that point, and as local crowds gathered to Ibatzes's palace for the feast of the Dormition, Daphnomeles, now strategos of nearby Achrida, on his own initiative, resolved to end the impasse. With only two escorts, he climbed the way to the estate, and announced himself to Ibatzes. Ibatzes, believing that Daphnomeles would not have come alone unless he intended to forge an alliance against Basil, retreated with the strategos to a secluded wooded glade in the gardens for a private discussion. There, Daphnomeles and his two hidden associates sprang on the Bulgarian general, blinded him, and carried him to the upper story of the palace, through the assembled crowds who were too stunned to react. When the Bulgarians recovered, they gathered underneath the building crying for revenge. Daphnomeles, however, addressed them and managed to convince them of the futility of further resistance, and to lay down their arms and seek the emperor's pardon... Ibatzes' capture on 15 August 1018 brought to an end the long conflict between Byzantium and Bulgaria,.. and according to the Byzantinist Paul Stephenson, secured for Daphnomeles, along with Nikephoros Ouranos and Nikephoros Xiphias, the reputation of one of the most prominent and successful generals in the Bulgarian wars of Basil II.. Following his feat, Daphnomeles was appointed strategos of the thema of Dyrrhachium by a grateful emperor, and given all of Ibatzes's movable wealth as a reward. In 1029, however, he was accused of conspiring with other prominent governors of the Balkans to overthrow Emperor Romanos III Argyros (r. 1028‚Äì34) in favour of doux Constantine Diogenes. The accused were then recalled to Constantinople, beaten, paraded through the Mese, and banished. Nothing further is known of him..

Nchanga Open Pit Mine  The Open Pits at Nchanga Mine are situated in a crescent shaped structure 11 km long around the municipal town of Chingola in Zambia. Covering nearly 30 km¬≤ it is the second largest open cast mine in the world. The deepest part of the pit is 400 m lower than the surrounding plateau. Open Pit mining at Nchanga started in 1955, in the main Nchanga Open Pit. Subsequently, nine medium sized open pits, called satellite pits, have also been mined at one time or the other. At present, mining is concentrated on the main Nchanga pit, with satellite planned for future extensions, as economics and processing technological developments unfold. Together they are termed generically as the Nchanga Open Pits.  Nchanga Underground Mine  The Nchanga underground mine accounts for approximately 45% of the total copper production at Nchanga. Over the past 10 years the annual production has averaged 93,00 tonnes of contained copper. Currently, there are three distinct ore bodies from which mining is taking place, namely, the lower orebody (LOB), Block \`A' and Chingola \`B'. These contribute 63%, 35% and 8% copper ore production respectively.  Nchanga Process Plants  The Nchanga processing plants consist of two concentrators, East Mill and West Mill and the tailings leach plant. The East Mill treats ore from the open pit while the West Mill treats ore from underground. In addition cobalt is treated at the West Mill Cobalt Plant.

Taki Unquy (Quechua, hispanicized and alternative spellings Taqui Ongoy, Taki Oncoy, Taqui Honcoy, Taqui Onccoy, Taki Onqoy) was a millenarian indigenous movement of political, religious and cultural dimensions which arose in the Peruvian Andes during the 16th century (c. 1564 - c. 1572) in opposition to the recent Spanish arrival. Historical background The literal translation of Taki Unquy from Quechua is \\"sickness of the chant\\" or \\"dancing sickness\\". The intrinsic Andean connotation is difficult to translate. The name comes from the Andeans contemporary to the Conquista, who believed that the wak'as were annoyed by the expansion of Christianity. The wak'as, Andean spirits, began taking possession of the Indigenous people, making them dance to music and announce divine will to restore the pre-Hispanic culture, mythology and politics. Taki Unquy arose in the 1560s in Huamanga, Ayacucho, Peru, from where it spread to Huancavelica, Lima, Cusco, Arequipa, Chuquisaca, and La Paz. At the outset the movement was called \\"The revolt of the Wak'as\\", which promulgated the rejection of the Christian god that had been imposed by way of violent coercion during Spanish conquest. Furthermore, the movement promoted the return to worship of the huacas, which are dually the pre-Hispanic gods and the grounds in which their worship was practiced. Guam√°n Poma(1615:862[876]) possibly referring to Taki Onqoy. The woman in the text is scolding the Devil, who has possessed the man drinking heavily. The Quechua text reads ‚ÄúAuaya ayauaya! Machac, machaclla. Tucuy cay upyac, upyaclla. Tucuy cay quimnac, quipnaclla. Tucuy cay camca serui, suyulla. Mina suyulla.‚Äù In English, this translates to ‚ÄúAwaya, ayawaya! The drunk is just a drunk, the drinker just a drinker, the vomiter only vomits. What you do is serve yourself, devil. The mines are where you belong‚Äù = Religious characteristics = According to the new belief, the wak'as' powers were within neither stones nor trees nor lagoons as in time of the Incas, instead they would enter into the bodies of people: Paraphrased Translation: =Transformation into Political Revolt= From a rebellion against Christianity, the Taki Unquy devolved rapidly into a political revolt with an ideology in keeping with Andean tradition. It was believed that the huacas would return with all their might and would defeat the Spanish God, as well as the peninsular invaders, re-establishing the equilibrium to a world wracked by the conquest. =Repression= The visible leader of the movement was an Indian by the name of Juan Chocne. The revolt was harshly suppressed by the Catholic surveyor (visitador) Crist√≥bal de Albornoz, who collaborated with the future chronicler Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala. He took Chocne and the other spiritual leaders to Cusco where they were to reject their beliefs in public. The women participants were imprisoned in convents and the Kurakas were fined for their participation in the revolt. =Conclusion= The movement declined in a few years, it is estimated that the practice ended in 1572, but the hope of a \\"reconquest\\" survived in the folklore and in intellectual circles. Bruce Mannheim argues that the fear may have so strong that fifty years later, when Juan P√©rez Bocanegra printed the Quechua hymn \\"Hanacpachap cussicuinin,\\" he conspicuously avoided the term unquy, though it would fit well into the theme alongside other names of the Pleiades.Bruce Mannheim, \\"A Nation Surrounded,\\" in Native Traditions in the Postconquest World, ed. Elizabeth Hill Boone and Tom Cummins, 383-420 (Dumbarton Oaks, 1998), 400-401. Transcendency and importance of the movement The topic had remained in obscurity for decades, and was reinvigorated by the work of Peruvian historian Luis Millones in 1964. Since that time it has been the subject of revision and analysis, having aided in understanding problems in the contemporaneous Peru, such as the historical process of Andean insurrections against the Spanish. Until that date, it was believed that other movements such as that led by Manco Inca II, Juan Santos Atahualpa, or even the late Tupac Amaru II rebellion, had only political aspects, and the cultural and religious dimensions were not given salience, which the study of Taki Unquy has allowed. The concept of Taki Unquy transcended the borders of Peru when the Argentine singer/composer Victor Heredia published an album titled Taki Ongoy in 1986. The playwright, director and actor Hugo Bonnet Rodriguez, born in Azangaro, Puno, crafted a play titled \\"Taki Onqoy\\". The play was about the repentance shown by the Andeans after having helped the Spanish destroy the Incas, and their sorrow for the subsequent historical changes. The play may be found in the book by the same name, Taki Onqoy, along with other works by the author. See also * Inkarri * Syncretism * Ghost Dance NotesBibliography * Doig, F. K.. (2002).

Collishaw was born at Nottingham City Hospital.\\"Stephan Collishaw interview\\", BBC.co.uk, June 2004. He studied at Goldsmiths, University of London, where he wrote several other substantial unpublished works, and based on an interest in history and literature, decided to become a teacher in 1991. On a whim, he relocated to Vilnius in 1995, where he met and married a Lithuanian woman named Marija, who had been teaching him Lithuanian.Ochser, Tim. \\"Keeping a wry eye on Lithuania\\", The Baltic Times, October 27, 2004. Marija already had two daughters, Kristina and Gabriele. The family lived in Palma de Mallorca for two years, where Marija gave birth to Collishaw's son Lukas, and then the family relocated to Nottinghamshire in 1989. By this time, he had written a total of three unpublished novels, and at his wife's urging, began taking his writing more seriously and took an MA in Creative Writing at Nottingham Trent University. His first novel, The Last Girl, about an elderly and impoverished poet in Vilnius, was completed in 2001 and published in 2003. In a favourable review for The Guardian, Julie Myerson described it as \\"astoundingly complex for a first novel\\", and also commented favourably on the reserved and un- flashy tone of Collishaw's prose.Myerson, Julie. \\"Pictures of Vilnius\\", The Guardian, March 22, 2003. He followed with a second novel, Amber, in 2004. Also set in Vilnius, it was inspired in part by (and contained numerous references to) Christopher Marlowe's play Tamburlaine, which had been a favorite of Collishaw's as a young man. Collishaw's third novel, The Song of the Stork was published by Legend Press. The Song of the Stork is set in Lithuania during the Second World War and tells the story of the brittle, unlikely relationship between a 15-year-old girl, Yael, and the mute outcast Aleksei against the background of the Jewish partisan resistance. The novel is a love story and a coming-of-age tale. It is about a young woman finding her voice as around her the voices of her community are extinguished. In 2018 Legend Press published Collishaw's fourth novel, A Child Called Happiness. Rosie Garthwaite wrote that it was, 'An incredibly timely book about the human upheaval in all its emotional forms', whilst Celeste Hicks wrote that 'Collishaw's characters are delicately created and endearingly human'. Set in Zimbabwe, the story explores two stories of struggle over a farm in the Bindura valley. In 2010 a young British girl goes to stay with her uncle on his family farm as tensions with the local authorities and the War Veterans reach boiling point. 115 years earlier, village chief Tafara struggles to keep control of his land as white settlers move into the area. Collishaw 'Deftly weaves together two stories set in different periods of Zimbabwe's history, always taking the reader with him.

The village is located 12 km east of Kayes on the left bank of the S√©n√©gal River just downstream of the F√©lou Falls. The site of the village was historically important as the falls were the furthest point up the S√©n√©gal River from Saint Louis that could be reached by boat. Navigation was only possible after the rainy season when the river was in flood. History Eugene Mage's view of the lifting of the siege of Fort du M√©dine, from Voyage dans le Soudan occidental (1868). In 1855 Louis Faidherbe, the French governor of S√©n√©gal, constructed a fort at M√©dine to strengthen French control of the S√©n√©gal River and to act a base in the expansion into the interior. The Siege of the Fort du M√©dine took place two years later in 1857 when the Toucouleur forces of al-HƒÅjj Umar Taal unsuccessfully besieged French colonial troops under Faidherbe. =Background= France at this time was struggling to create a West African empire to rival the holdings of its powerful neighbor England. The previous year, the French legislature had voted the first funds for what would become the Dakar-Niger railway line, a key transportation system to link France's colonies. As the railroad line expanded toward the east, the army established a series of forts, moving troops and cannon into them by steamship where possible and overland where not. In 1848, Umar Tall launched his jihad against neighboring Malink√© regions. By 1855, his rapid expansion had led to several skirmishes with the French army. With the authorization of his ally, Khasso Quene Hawa Demba Diallo, Governor Faidherbe ordered a fort built at the Khasso village of M√©dina. =Siege= In April 1857, Umar Tall declared war against the Khasso kingdom, and marched on M√©dina Fort, their nearest outpost, with an army of 20,000 to 25,000 riflemen. He laid siege to the fort and began a series of assaults that resulted in hundreds of casualties for the Toucouleur army. In the 97 days that followed, the defenders' food supplies soon ran low, and the fort was on the verge of surrendering when Faidherbe arrived by steamboat with supplies and 500 reinforcements, breaking the siege. =Consequences= The M√©dine train station along the Dakar-Niger Railway, c. 1895 Realizing the difficulties of attacking the well-equipped French, Umar Tall turned his attention to the neighboring Bambara Empire, soon conquering most of its territory including its capital of S√©gou. However, the French continued to expand their West African presence, conquering S√©gou and the Toucouleur Empire less than thirty years after Umar Taal's death. Today On 19 March 2009 the Malian Government submitted the M√©dine Fort to be added to the tentative list of heritage sites of the UNESCO World Heritage Centre. The Fort du M√©dine is open to the public. There is also an old railroad station on the Dakar-Koulikoro line 2 km to the west of the village and a European-style cemetery with graves from the mid-19th century. The village population is around 1800 with a small market daily. References *B.O. Oloruntimeehin. The Segu Tukulor Empire. Humanities Press, New York (1972).

It was a four-coupled tank locomotive for shunting duties. There were two types, of which the later one entered the Deutsche Reichsbahn fleet and became Class 98.74.  T 1  The first variant, called the T 1, emerged from a joint project with the firm of Krauss in their railway company's own workshop. The 12 locomotives built between 1871 and 1873 belonged to the few engines that were developed specifically for the Oldenburg railways. They had a boiler pressure of 98.1 kN and maximum permitted speed of 40 km/h. These engines had already been retired on the formation of the Deutsche Reichsbahn.  T 1.2  Between 1888 and 1892 the Oldenburg State Railways acquired another 18 locomotives, which were grouped into Class T 12. This time it was not built by them, the locomotives were supplied by Hohenzollern AG. They were however designed specially for the Oldenburg railways. Unlike the earlier version, these engines had a 2 bar higher boiler pressure and larger coupled wheel and cylinder diameters. In addition the top speed was not 45 km/h. An unusual feature was the driver's cab roof, that was rounded front and back and not, as was then common, at the sides. Five examples were taken over by the Deutsche Reichsbahn as 98 7401‚Äì98 7405. The last two engines were retired by 1933.

(2003). Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. . This condition is also known as arylsulfatase E deficiency, CDPX1, and X-linked recessive chondrodysplasia punctata 1. The syndrome rarely affects females, but they can be carriers of the recessive allele. Although the exact number of people diagnosed with CDPX1 is unknown, it was estimated that 1 in 500,000 have CDPX1 in varying severity. This condition is not linked to a specific ethnicity. The mutation that leads to a deficiency in arylsulfatase E. (ARSE) occurs in the coding region of the gene. Absence of stippling, deposits of calcium, of bones and cartilage, shown on x-ray, does not rule out chondrodysplasia punctata or a normal chondrodysplasia punctata 1 (CDPX1) gene without mutation. Stippling of the bones and cartilage is rarely seen after childhood. Phalangeal abnormalities are important clinical features to look for once the stippling is no longer visible. Other, more severe, clinical features include respiratory abnormalities, hearing loss, cervical spine abnormalities, delayed cognitive development, ophthalmologic abnormalities, cardiac abnormalities, gastroesophageal reflux, and feeding difficulties. CDPX1 actually has a spectrum of severity; different mutations within the CDPX1 gene have different effects on the catalytic activity of the ARSE protein. The mutations vary between missense, nonsense, insertions, and deletions. Cause The only known cause of this condition is a mutation in the X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata 1 (CDPX1) gene. Mutations in this gene result in a deficiency of arylsulfatase E. Only 50-60% of cases have been shown to have mutations in this gene and the cause of the remaining cases is not yet known.The CDPX1 gene is located on the short arm of the X chromosome (Xp22.3) on the Crick (minus) strand. It is 33,614 bases in length. The mature protein has a molecular weight of 68 kiloDaltons. It is glycosylated and is located in the Golgi apparatus. Its activity may be inhibited by warfarin. It seems likely that warfarin induced embryotoxicity may be due at least in part to this inhibition. Brachytelephalangic chondrodysplasia punctata (BCDP) is the non-genetic, or environmentally produced, phenocopies associated with CDPX1. Causes of BCDP can also come from genetic effects, mainly due to mutations. Keutel syndrome, deficiency of vitamin K epoxide reductase subunit 1 (VKORC1), gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX), Xp contiguous deletion syndromes, and multiple sulfatase deficiency are all genetic conditions that are associated BCDP. Diagnosis This condition occurs almost exclusively in males. The mutation may be spontaneous or inherited from the mother. The typical clinical features are: *flat nasal tip *short columella *maxillary hypoplasia *involvement of terminal phalanges *stippled chondrodystrophy =Biochemical confirmation= The activity of arylsulfatase E can be measured with the substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate. Treatment CDPX1 activity may be inhibited by warfarin because it is believed that ARSE has enzymatic activity in a vitamin K producing biochemical pathway. Vitamin K is also needed for controlling binding of calcium to bone and other tissues within the body.

Early years Born in Douglas, Arizona, United States, on December 18, 1918, William Brenton (Bill) Boggs relocated to Noranda, Quebec with his parents in 1927. He graduated from McGill University, mechanical engineering, and became an Engineering Officer of the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1940. During his World War II service, he notably served as Senior Engineering Officer of 331 Wing of Wellington bombers dispatched to Tunisia, North Africa to support the Allied landings in Sicily and Italy, for which contributions he was appointed to the Order of the British Empire (O.B.E.) in 1944. Civilian career Boggs' early civilian career included positions with Trans-Canada Airlines (1945-1950) and Canadair (1950-1957) before he joined Can-Car, a subsidiary of Hawker Siddeley Canada, and became vice president of Hawker Siddeley. In 1965, he became President of de Havilland Canada (DHC). During this term, he was involved with the development of the 30-seat Dash-7 commuter aircraft. He then became President and eventually Chairman of Canada Systems Group (CSG), and, in 1983, President and CEO of The Canadian Data and Professional Service Organization.

GroupLens also works with mobile and ubiquitous technologies, digital libraries, and local geographic information systems. The GroupLens lab was one of the first to study automated recommender systems with the construction of the \\"GroupLens\\" recommender, a Usenet article recommendation engine, and MovieLens, a popular movie recommendation site used to study recommendation engines, tagging systems, and user interfaces. The lab has also gained notability for its members' work studying open content communities such as Cyclopath, a geo-wiki that was used in the Twin Cities to help plan the regional cycling system. History= Formation = In 1992, John Riedl and Paul Resnick attended the CSCW conference together. After they heard keynote speaker Shumpei Kumon talk about his vision for an information economy, they began working on a collaborative filtering system for Usenet news. The system collected ratings from Usenet readers and used those ratings to predict how much other readers would like an article before they read it. This recommendation engine was one of the first automated collaborative filtering systems in which algorithms were used to automatically form predictions based on historical patterns of ratings. The overall system was called the \\"GroupLens\\" recommender, and the servers that collected the ratings and performed the computation were called the \\"Better Bit Bureau\\". This name was later dropped after a request from the Better Business Bureau. \\"GroupLens\\" is now used as a name both for this recommender system, and for the research lab at the University of Minnesota. A feasibility test was done between MIT and the University of Minnesota and a research paper was published including the algorithm, the system design, and the results of the feasibility study, in the CSCW conference of 1994. In 1993, Riedl and Resnick invited Joseph Konstan to join the team. Together, they decided to create a higher-performance implementation of the algorithms to support larger-scale deployments. In summer 1995 the team gathered Bradley Miller, David Maltz, Jon Herlocker, and Mark Claypool for \\"Hack Week\\" to create the new implementation, and to plan the next round of experiments. In the Spring of 1996, the first workshop on collaborative filtering was put together by Resnick and Hal Varian at the University of California, Berkeley. There, researchers from projects around the US that were studying similar systems came together to share ideas and experience. = Net Perceptions = In the summer of 1996, David Gardiner, a former Ph.D. student of Riedl's, introduced John Riedl to Steven Snyder. Snyder had been an early employee at Microsoft, but left Microsoft to come to Minnesota to do a Ph.D. in Psychology. He realized the commercial potential of collaborative filtering, and encouraged the team to found a company in April 1996. By June, Gardiner, Snyder, Miller, Riedl, and Konstan had incorporated their company, and by July they had their first round of funding, from Hummer Winblad Venture Partners venture capital company. Net Perceptions went on to be one of the leading companies in personalization during the Internet boom of the late 1990s, and stayed in business until 2004. Based on their experience, Riedl and Konstan wrote a book about the lessons learned from deploying recommenders in practice. Recommender systems have since become ubiquitous in the online world, with leading vendors such as Amazon and Netflix deploying highly sophisticated recommender systems. Netflix even offered a $1 million prize for improvements in recommender technology. When the EachMovie site closed in 1997, the researchers behind it released the anonymous rating data they had collected, for other researchers to use. The GroupLens Research team, led by Brent Dahlen and Jon Herlocker, used this data set to jumpstart a new movie recommendation site called MovieLens which has been a very visible research platform, including a detailed discussion in a New Yorker article by Malcolm Gladwell, and a report in a full episode of ABC Nightline. Between 1997 and 2002 the group continued its research on collaborative filtering, which became known in the community by the more general term of recommender systems. With Joe Konstan's expertise in user interfaces, the team began exploring interface issues in recommenders, such as explanations, and meta- recommendation systems. = Studying online communities = In 2002, GroupLens expanded into social computing and online communities with the addition of Loren Terveen, who was known for his research of social recommender systems such as PHOAKS. In order to broaden the set of research ideas and tools they used, Riedl, Konstan, and Terveen invited colleagues in social psychology (Robert Kraut and Sara Kiesler, of the Carnegie Mellon Human Computer Interaction Institute), and economic and social analysis (Paul Resnick and Yan Chen of the University of Michigan School of Information) to collaborate. The new, larger team adopted the name CommunityLab, and looked generally at the effects of technological interventions on the performance of online communities. For instance, some of their research explored technology for enriching conversation systems, while other research explored the personal, social, and economic motivations for user ratings. In 2008 GroupLens launched Cyclopath, a computational geo-wiki for bicyclists within a city. . In 2010, GroupLens won the annual ACM software system award. Brent Hecht joined the GroupLens faculty in 2013, focusing on geographic human-computer interaction. Lana Yarosh joined the GroupLens faculty in 2014; she works with social computing and child-computer interaction. A third professor, Haiyi Zhu, joined in 2015. Haiyi has published research on Facebook and other social networks. Contributions * The MovieLens recommender system: MovieLens is a non- commercial movie recommender system that has been running since 1997 with over 164,000 unique visitors as of 2009, who have provided over 15 million movie ratings. * MovieLens ratings datasets: In the early days of recommender systems, research was slowed down by the lack of publicly available datasets. In response to requests from other researchers, GroupLens released three datasets:http://www.grouplens.org/node/73 the MovieLens 100,000 rating dataset, the MovieLens 1 million rating dataset, and the MovieLens 10 million rating dataset. These datasets became the standard datasets for recommender research, and have been used in over 300 papers by researchers around the world. The dataset is also being used for teaching about recommender technology. * MovieLens tagging dataset: GroupLens added tagging to MovieLens in 2006. Since then, users have provided over 85,000 applications of 14,000 unique tags to movies. The MovieLens 10 million ratings dataset also includes a 100,000 tag applications dataset for researchers to use. * Information leakage from recommender datasets: a paper in the information retrieval conference analyzed the privacy risks to users of having large recommender datasets released. The basic risk discovered is that an anonymized dataset might be combined with public information to identify a user. For instance, a user who has written about his preference for movies on online forums could be associated with a specific row in the MovieLens datasets. In some cases, these associations might leak information the user would prefer to keep private. * Wikipedia research: The study of value and vandalism in Wikipedia published in 2007 described the concentration of contribution across Wikipedia editors. This paper was one of the first to focus on the length of time that a contribution survives within Wikipedia as a measure of its value. The paper also investigated the effects of vandalism on Wikipedia readers, by measuring the probability that a view of a page would capture that page in a vandalized state. GroupLens has also explored ways to help editors find pages which they can effectively contribute to with the SuggestBot recommender. The group has also explored the evolution of the norms in Wikipedia that determine which articles are accepted or rejected, and the effect of changes in those norms on the Long Tail of Wikipedia articles. GroupLens has also explored the functioning of the informal peer review system within Wikipedia to discover ways the decisions being made appear to be influenced inappropriately by ownership, and that experience does not seem to change editor performance very much. GroupLens researchers have also explored visualizations of the edit history of Wikipedia articles. In 2011, the GroupLens researchers completed a scientific exploration of gender imbalance in Wikipedia's popular editors, resulting in finding that there was a large gap between male and female editors. * Shilling recommender systems: GroupLens has explored ways that users of recommender systems can attempt to inappropriately influence the recommendations given to other users. They call this behavior shilling, because of its relationship to the practice of hiring associates to pretend to be enthusiastic customers. They showed that some types of shilling are likely to be effective in practice. One concern about shilling is that the false predictions may change the reported opinions of later users, further corrupting the recommendations. * Cyclopath: Beginning in 2008, GroupLens launched Cyclopath, a computational geo-wiki for local bicyclists. Cyclopath has since been used by hundreds of cyclists within the Twin Cities. More recently, Cyclopath has been adopted by the Twin Cities Metropolitan Council to help plan the regional cycling system.

Prykarpattia (–ü–†–ò–ö–ê–†–ü–ê–¢–¢–Ø). Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine. Located at the outer foot of the Eastern Carpathian Mountains (Outer Subcarpathia), consisting of today's Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast (predominantly) and Lviv Oblast (partially), it forms part of the larger historic region of Galicia (Haliczyna); which before the 14th century was a part of the Kingdom of Russia (see Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia). Along with the Lviv, Chernivtsi and Zakarpattia regions, Prykarpattia is a component of the Carpathian Euroregion. History Initially a part of Kyivan Rus and one of its successor states, Halych-Volhynia, the area was occupied by the Kingdom of Poland. Following the Partitions of Poland of 1772, Prykarpattia fell under the Habsburg Monarchy. In the wake of the World War I and the fall of Austria- Hungary, it became disputed between Poland and a short-lived West Ukrainian People's Republic. After the Polish-Soviet War was concluded, it remained in Poland. After the 1939 invasion and partition of Poland between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, the area was attached to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (falling to Nazi control after the start of Operation Barbarossa and until 1944). It remains a part of modern Ukraine, incorporated into the western Ukrainian oblast of Ivano-Frankivsk, roughly corresponding to the southern half of the oblast. Geography The region of Pokuttya today is used interchangeably with Prykarpattia. There are no official borders established between both of them. When referring to Prykarpattia it is understood that it is the whole Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast. As for Pokuttya, it is only for the eastern part of the same region. Sometimes the southern Lviv Oblast is considered part of Prykarpattia such as cities of Stryi, Truskavets, and Drohobych. The Dnister river is the major waterway in the region to where series of other minor rivers flow. The other major cities in the region from the earlier mentioned are Halych, Kalush, Ivano-Frankivsk and many others. The region is home to such Ukrainian cultures as Hutsuls, Lemky, Boyky, and others.

It is the principal church of the Melkite Greek Catholic Eparchy of Newton, which encompasses the entire United States, the seat of its hierarch, currently Bishop Nicholas Samra, and the parish church of the Melkite Greek Catholic community in Greater Boston. Its present structure and its status as a cathedral date to 1966; previous to that, Our Lady of the Annunciation Melkite Catholic Church was a parish church in the South End of Boston.The Melkite Handbook: Introducing the Melkite Greek Catholic Church. Published by the Office of Educational Services, Melkite Greek Catholic Eparchy of Newton (2008) Melkite immigration to Boston In the 1890s, Christians from Syria and the Levant (now Lebanon) emigrated to the United States in search of better economic opportunities and to escape Ottoman rule in their homelands. Among the immigrants were Melkite Greek Catholics. Boston was among the northeastern cities in which the Melkites settled, attracted to it by opportunities in the city's garment district.Melkites in America: A Directory and Informative Handbook. Published by the Melkite Exarchate (1971) The majority of the Melkite immigrants to Boston, and elsewhere in eastern Massachusetts, hailed from in and around Zahl√© in the Levant. As was typical in that era, they were soon joined by a priest dispatched from the region in which they originated. Thus, Father Joseph Simon, a hieromonk of the Basilian Salvatorian Order (BSO), which had responsibility for many of the parishes in Zahle, arrived in 1896. However, he remained only briefly in Boston, moving on to settle in Lawrence, Massachusetts, where the Melkites were more populous than in Boston. Although both he and his Basilian successors, Father Philip Batal and Archimandrite Basil Nahas, periodically ministered to those in Boston, the community was anxious to have its own church and a permanently assigned priest. Since there was no Melkite hierarch in the United States at the time, they petitioned John Williams, Catholic Archbishop of Boston, who had canonical jurisdiction of them, to address their pastoral needs. The Archbishop, however, was unconvinced that their numbers were sufficient to support a priest or church and declined to act on the request. Parish church A decade after Father Simon's arrival, the Melkite Catholic Archbishop of Zahle Cyril Moghabghab (later Melkite Patriarch) conducted a pastoral visit to the emigrant communities of North and South America, including that at Boston. Meeting with Coadjutor Archbishop William O'Connell, he obtained agreement that the Melkite congregation would be afforded a church as soon as O'Connell succeeded to the episcopal throne of Boston. Two years later, in 1908, Archbishop O'Connell approved the purchase of a commercial structure at 178 Harrison Avenue in the South End of Boston, the neighborhood in which the majority of Melkites resided.\\"Our Community's Story\\" in Annunciation Melkite Cathedral: 25th Anniversary 1966-1991 Published by Our Lady of the Annunciation Melkite Greek Catholic Cathedral (1991) The building required remodeling to be suitable for worship. A photograph taken subsequent to the renovations shows a rudimentary iconostasis, absent doors,\\"Annunciation Melkite Cathedral: A History 1908-1998\\" in That All May Be One - 37th National Melkite Convention, July 1‚Äì5, 1998: 90th Anniversary of the Melkite Church in Boston Published by Our Lady of the Annunciation Melkite Greek Catholic Cathedral (1998) suggesting that its interior had only superficial resemblance to the traditional styling of Byzantine churches. This was common in a time when such church furnishings were typically omitted from Eastern Catholic churches, as they were foreign to the predominant Latin Catholics, the majority of whom were unaware of their religious significance to their Eastern counterparts. The church was titled as Our Lady of the Annunciation Syrian Catholic Church and the Divine Liturgy was first served there in November 1908, although the building and its altar were not formally dedicated until June 27, 1910. Archimandrite Nicholas Ghannam, BSO, Superior of the Salvatorian monastic community in Zahl√© prior to arriving in Boston, was named as its first pastor. He served in that role, assisted by his brother, Father Athanasius Ghannam, BSO, for the next seventeen years. He was succeeded in 1925 by Father Peter Abouzeid, BSO. During the latter's eight-year tenure the mortgage was retired and both church and rectory were remodeled; however, it became increasingly apparent that a larger church was required. The existing building was inadequate to house a congregation that had grown in numbers, as Melkites relocated to the city, perceiving that employment opportunities were more plentiful in the urban setting than elsewhere. Despite this perceived need, the economic crisis in the aftermath of the 1929 Stock Market Crash precluded taking any action on the matter. Relocation to Warren Avenue In 1933, Father Abouzeid was transferred to Lawrence, Massachusetts, and replaced by Archimandrite Flavian Zahar, BSO. The new pastor was likewise frustrated in his desire to build a replacement church, initially by the financial constraints of a post-Depression economy and, subsequently, by entry of the United States into World War II. A vacant Protestant church on nearby Warren Avenue, at the corner of West Canton Street, offered a viable solution to wartime restrictions on non-essential civilian construction and the parish purchased it. The new church was renovated and dedicated on May 3, 1942. Photographs of its interior show a high altar at the rear of the sanctuary, statuary, and an altar railing; there is no iconostasis. The highly Latinized appearance offers no suggestion that the parish was anything other than a typical Catholic church. The failure to employ traditional forms of Byzantine church architecture, decor, and furnishings was reflective of prevailing attitudes that Eastern Catholics in the diaspora should largely conform to the styles and customs of their Latin Catholic counterparts. Parishioners were generous in meeting the parish's financial needs and celebrated by burning the mortgage on the new church only three years after its purchase. However, a few months later, they mourned the death of Archimandrite Zahar, who had led them in achieving the goal of a new church. Father Beshara Thalage, BSO, administered the parish until Protosyncellos Eftimios Saba, BSO, was named as its fourth pastor in the early months of 1946. Like his predecessors, Father Saba had a distinguished background, having been both a seminary rector and First Secretary to Patriarch Cyril IX Moghabghab. Father served the parish for ten years. Particularly during the last half of that decade, many Melkites moved from the South End, although they continued to travel back to their old neighborhood to attend Divine Liturgy and parish functions. When Father Saba died in 1956, Archimandrite John Jadaa and Father Elias Kweiter, both Salvatorians, had responsibility for administering the parish until mid-1957, when Archimandrite Nicholas Borkhoche, BSO, was appointed pastor. Reflective of both the growing parish and the demands on the time of Father Borkhoche, who was simultaneously serving as Regional Superior of the Salvatorians, Father Georges Coriarty, BSO, was assigned as his assistant. For the second time in the parish's half- century of existence, the need for larger quarters was raised; this time, the issue was also discussed as to whether the time had come to seek a location more conveniently situated to the new neighborhoods in which parishioners had settled.Finn, Brendan, \\"History of the Parish\\" in Cathedral of Our Lady of The Annunciation: Dedication April 24, 1966 Published by Our Lady of the Annunciation Melkite Greek Catholic Cathedral (1966) However, Father Borkhohe's responsibilities to his religious order necessitated that he relocate to St Basil's Monastery in Methuen, Massachusetts, only three years after being named pastor. Consequently, the questions of rebuilding and possibly relocating were not pursued beyond the most preliminary stages of discussion. Subsequent to his departure, Father Coriaty administered the parish for a brief period. Construction of the church in West Roxbury In 1960, Father Coriaty was transferred to Canada and Archimandrite John Bassoul, BSO, was named as sixth pastor of the church. His term was also brief, lasting only two years, but he is credited with initiating the process of relocating the church. Following up on the earlier discussions that had been had, it was immediately apparent to him that the Melkite faithful were not only no longer concentrated in Boston's South End neighborhood, but that they had not been for some time. As early as 1942, when they first occupied the building on Warren Avenue, a program book produced for a parish celebration already reflected significant dispersion of the parishioners among Boston's neighborhoods and suburbs, particularly those to the south. Almost twenty years later, travel demands, a shortage of parking, neighborhood deterioration, and the need for extensive and expensive repairs, necessitated that an alternative site be identified. A census of registered parishioners confirmed that substantial numbers of them were living in Boston's West Roxbury neighborhood. A property on the VFW Parkway in West Roxbury was identified as promising, in its proximity to West Roxbury, easy road access, and suitability of the terrain for building. There were, however, complicating factors involved. The land was owned by the City of Boston and, assuming the city's willingness to sell a parcel designated as conservation land, its ability to enter into a sale was pre-conditioned on legislative approval under restrictive home-rule provisions applicable to the city under Massachusetts General Law. Father Bassoul's negotiations with the city, aided and encouraged by Cardinal Richard Cushing, Archbishop of Boston, who had a history of affording support to the Eastern Catholic communities within his archdiocese, were successful. Legislative approval for the sale was secured and Governor John Volpe signed the bill authorizing the city to set a price and transact the sale. At this point, Father Bassoul's efforts were halted by an announcement that the Holy Synod of the Melkite Church had elected him to head the Archeparchy of Homs, Hama, and Yabroud in Syria. Before departing for his new position, he was ordained to the episcopate at Boston's Cathedral of the Holy Cross on April 28, 1962, at a Divine Liturgy presided by Cardinal Cushing, garbed in Byzantine hierarchal vesture. Father John Elya, BSO (later Bishop), briefly administered the parish until appointment of Father Lucien Malouf, BSO, as its seventh pastor on November 1, 1962. Having twice previously constructed parish churches, Father Malouf was undaunted by the prospect of doing so a third time. Within weeks of taking office, he and his newly appointed assistant, Father Charles Aboody, undertook to ascertain the status of the proposed purchase. In discussions with the Cardinal and chancery officials, it quickly became evident that, after the announcement of Father Bassoul's election as archbishop, critical momentum had been lost and the city of Boston had failed to act on the final crucial step, setting a purchase price. With a construction boom then underway in the northeast region, the priests feared that rising costs, already in excess of what had been planned, would become prohibitive if action was not taken quickly to finalize the sale and commence building. With the Cardinal's encouragement, they renewed negotiation with city officials. Finally, these efforts produced agreement at a price that the parish deemed affordable and Mayor John Collins signed the deed, transferring ownership of the land to the parish. A building committee was formed and Lawrence J. Cuneo was retained as the principal architect for the design of the church. A groundbreaking ceremony, held on May 31, 1964, was followed by a banquet at which Cardinal Cushing announced a building fund drive. He then immediately pledged $300,000 of personal funds, an amount equal to one-half of the projected building costs, to launch that drive. Four and a half months later, on October 15, 1964, a contract was awarded to Rich Construction Company, to serve as general contractor for the project. From parish church to cathedral In January 1966, the Holy See announced the appointment of Father Justin Najmy, pastor of St. Basil the Great Church in Central Falls, Rhode Island, as the first Exarch for Melkites in the United States. He chose the Church of the Annunciation as the cathedral for the new exarchate, and on March 25, 1966, the Feast of the Annunciation, the cathedral celebrated its inaugural Divine Liturgy. The altar was consecrated by Boston Auxiliary Bishop Thomas J. Riley on April 23, 1966, and the following day the building was solemnly dedicated. Bishop Najmy was enthroned in the new cathedral in June 1966 and delegated Fr. Lucien Malouf, BSO as its rector. Later events In 1976, the Melkite Greek Catholic Church in the United States was elevated from the status of an Exarchate to that of an Eparchy. On May 8, 1977, at a Patriarchal Liturgy served at the Cathedral, the Melkite Greek Catholic Eparchy of Newton was canonically erected with Archbishop Joseph Tawil as Eparch.

His tenureship to command the Pakistan Air Force is notable during the events involving the short-lived military conflict with the Indian Army in Kargil in 1999. He is credited for advising against the all-out war with India to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, eventually providing an exit to Pakistan Army to deescalate the situation through diplomacy with India. Biography Parvaiz Mehdi Qureshi was born in Phalia, Punjab, India, into a Punjabi family on 1 October 1943. After graduating from a local high school, Mehdi joined the Pakistan Air Force in 1961, and shared a room with Pervez Musharraf and Aziz Mirza, whom he enjoyed his lifelong friendship, when he being was selected for their respected military academies. After their interview with the local commandants, Mehdi, Musharraf, and Mirza went to see the world-claim Urdu movie, \\"Savera (lit. Dawn)\\". The next day, all three were called to reported back to their respected academies and were selected for their respected training in their arms of commission. Mehdi entered in the famed Pakistan Air Force Academy in Risalpur, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, and passed out in the class of 38th GD Pilot course where he was also conferred with the Sword of Honour by the commandant of the Air Force Academy in 1964. After gaining commissioned in the No. 16 Squadron Black Panthers of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) as P/Off, he qualified as the fighter pilot, flying the F-86 Sabre jet. =Between the wars and prisoner of war= F-86 in flight: Flight Lieutenant Mehdi was fired down by Indian Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 in 1971. In 1965, P/Off Mehdi participated in the closed air combat operations during the second war with India where he flew his F-86 Sabre against the Indian Folland Gnat. After the war, P/Off Mehdi was promoted as F/Off in 1966; and Flight-Lieutenant in 1969. In 1969, Flt-Lt. Mehdi was then dispatched to serve in the Dacca airbase of the Pakistan Air Force in East-Pakistan, serving in the No. 14 Squadron Tail choppers. In 1970, Flt-Lt. Mehdi took over the command of a flight of the squadron, stationed in Dacca airbase. In 1971, Flt-Lt. Mehdi actively took participation in the air operations in East Pakistan against the Indian Army and their supported insurgent group, Mukti Bahini. On 22 November 1971, Flt. Lt. Mehdi flew his combat mission while flying his F-86 Sabre in support of operation in Garibpur against the Indian Air Force. Flt. Lt. Mehdi's capture and subsequent imprisoned occurred on 23 November 1971 when he was flying with the finger-four formation of the ground attack/bomber unit near the Eastern India when his F-86 Sabre was shot down by the .20 mm machine gun mounted on the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21. His Wingmen, F/Off Khalil Ahmad and OIC of 14 Sqn. Wg-Cdr Choudhri, who were also shot down, were fortunate enough to escape towards the Pakistani side of the Indo-East Pakistan border. Flight Lieutenant Mehdi parachutted 50 yrs. behind the Chaugachha Upazila where he was pulled by the Indian Army soldiers, and he was physically attacked by the Indian Army soldiers before being rescued by the Captain H. S. Panag, the section commander of the Indian Army. His capture as POW made him the first Pakistani POW and was eventually taken under the custody of Captain H.S. Panag who later sent him to Fort Williams. At the time of his capture, his 9 mm pistol, survival kit, aviator glasses, and the photo of his wife was recovered by Captain H.S. Panag. His status as the first prisoner of war made the front pages of the Indian newspapers, and the photos of his capture were widely circulated in the black-and-white television screens of the Pakistani news media. Upon hearing and watching the news, President Yahya Khan imposed the state of emergency, and ordered the military for the preparation of war with India on 23 November 1971. According to the East-Pakistani sources, the No. 14 Squadron Tail choppers suffered with minor casualties due to lack of effective radars that would provide them with an early warning, whereas the attacking Indian Air Force planes were directed by Indian radar controllers at Barrackpore.  Repatriation, war and command appointments in the military  The population transfer agreement signed between the Governments of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh made it possible of war prisoner to be transported back to Pakistan from India in 1973‚Äì75. Upon his return, FLt. Lt. PQ Mehdi was directed to attend the war course at the Air War College where he attained master's degree in War studies in 1976. In 1977, Squadron-Leader, Mehdi served to join the faculty of the Combat Commanders School (CCS), a TOPGUN training school, which he remained associated with several years. From 1977‚Äì79, Wing- Commander Mehdi served as the commanding officer when he commanded the No. 9 Squadron Griffins, stationed in Sargodha Air Force Base. In 1981‚Äì83, Group- Captain Mehdi was appointed as the base commander of the Sargodha AFB. During this time, Group Captain Mehdi qualified as a combat pilot to fly the F-16s. In 1991‚Äì93, Air-Cdre Mehdi was appointed AOC of the Southern Air Command, based in Sindh, Pakistan, and was promoted to the two-star rank, moved to command the Northern Air Command. In 1993, AVM Mehdi took over the command of the Air Defence Command, then-based in the Chaklala AFB. In 1995, Air Vice Marshal Mehdi was eventually promoted to the three-star rank, posted at the Air AHQ in Islamabad when he was appointed as DCAS (Operations), which he remained in this capacity until 1997. In 1997, Air-Marshal Mehdi was elevated and appointed as the Vice Chief of Air Staff (VCAS) under then-air chief Air Chief Marshal Abbas Khattak. Chief of Air Staff Contingency plan of Kargil in 1999. On 7 November 1997, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif approved the promotion papers of Air-Mshl PQ Mehdi to be elevated to the four-star rank, Air Chief Marshal, and subsequently took over the command of the Pakistan Air Force as its Chief of Air Staff (CAS) on 8 November 1997. As an air chief, ACM PQ Mehdi played a crucial role in expanding the educational scope of the Air War College in Karachi, and backed up the military's plan for enhancing its communication capabilities between the branches of the Pakistani military. In 1998, ACM PQ Mehdi backed and spoke in favor of authorizing the nuclear weapon testing during the national security meeting with the civilian cabinet. Gen. Mehdi issued directives to the F-16s belonging to the No. 11 Squadron Arrows to escort the C-130H to strategically airlift six-to-seven nuclear device in tight finger-four formation to the weapon-testing sites in Balochistan, Pakistan. ACM Mehdi did not comment or offered any opinion when Prime Minister Sharif relieved the military commission of then-Chairman Joint chiefs General Jehangir Karamat in 1998. =Kargil conflict= ACM Mehdi commanded the air force during the two-month long military confrontation with the Indian Army in 1999. During this conflict and meeting with the chairman joint chiefs, ACM Mehdi advised against having the air force involved with the Indian Air Force, quoting: \\"(sic)...any intervention by the Pakistan Air Force into disputed land of Indian Kashmir would be perceived as an escalation to all-out declared war.\\" Despite the strong urings of the JS HQ, the Air AHQ issued orders to their commanders to restrict the war efforts, knowing that \\"cross-border attacks either on the side of the LoC or the international border would invite an immediate response from the Indian Air Force, possibly in the shape of a retaliatory strike against the home base of the intruding fighters‚Äìthus starting the first round.\\". Furthermore, the aerial embargo placed by the United States in 1989‚Äì91 had badly affected the operational capabilities of the air force to carry out day-and-night combat missions. After much discussions, the F-16s were deployed but under the country's airspace and did not part in the war, although the aircraft began patrolling the Skardu air force base only to protect the base from any Indian Air Force incursion. After the aerial mission flew to support the Indian Army, the F-16s from the Northern Air Command were deployed for combat air patrol that began patrolling the Skardu Air Force Base only to protect the base from any Indian Air Force incursion. At several meetings, ACM Mehdi had objected Gen. Musharraf's grand strategy when he pointed out the aftermath of Chengiz Khan, a successful mission of PAF but it led the start of 1971 war which end up as a disaster for Pakistan. Therefore, Mehdi objected any direct confrontation mission but favoured the patrolling missions and remaining silent in support of other officers who gave vital criticism of Musharraf. Retirement In the military and political circles, ACM Mehdi's image was widely known to have an imposing personality, and a direct but strict attitude towards his principles. His retirement was eventually confirmed when a junior-most air force general was promoted take succeed him, leading to speculations that \\"PQ Mehdi's rather straight-faced and forthright dealings with a somewhat junior-general Pervez Musharraf (although both graduated with same class) particularly during Kargil conflict was a good reason to believe that the general decided to appoint a not-very-senior air chief marshal whom he could order around like one of his Corps Commanders.\\". Therefore, General Musharraf favoured to superseded five senior air force generals and appointed a sixth-in-line to the four-star rank once Mehdi was due for retirement.

Branched polymers can form links between the chains, which lead to progressively larger polymers. As the linking continues, larger branched polymers are obtained and at a certain extent of the reaction links between the polymer result in the formation of a single macroscopic molecule. At that point in the reaction, which is defined as gel point, the system loses fluidity and viscosity becomes very large. The onset of gelation, or gel point, is accompanied by a sudden increase in viscosity. This \\"infinite\\" sized polymer is called the gel or network, which does not dissolve in the solvent, but can swell in it.  Background  Gelation is promoted by gelling agents. Gelation can occur either by physical linking or by chemical crosslinking. While the physical gels involve physical bonds, chemical gelation involves covalent bonds. The first quantitative theories of chemical gelation were formulated in the 1940s by Flory and Stockmayer. Critical percolation theory was successfully applied to gelation in 1970s. A number of growth models (diffusion limited aggregation, cluster- cluster aggregation, kinetic gelation) were developed in the 1980s to describe the kinetic aspects of aggregation and gelation.  Quantitative approaches to determine gelation  It is important to be able to predict the onset of gelation, since it is an irreversible process that dramatically changes the properties of the system. = Average functionality approach = According to the Carothers equation number-average degree of polymerization DP_n is given by DP_n= frac{2}{2-p.f_{av}} where p is the extent of the reaction and f_{av} is the average functionality of reaction mixture. For the gel DP_n can be considered to be infinite, thus the critical extent of the reaction at the gel point is found as p_c=frac {2}{f_{av}} If p is greater or equal to p_c, gelation occurs. = Flory Stockmayer approach = Flory and Stockmayer used a statistical approach to derive an expression to predict the gel point by calculating when DP_n approaches infinite size. The statistical approach assumes that (1) the reactivity of the functional groups of the same type is the same and independent of the molecular size and (2) there are no intramolecular reactions between the functional groups on the same molecule. Consider the polymerization of bifunctional molecules A-A, B-B and multifunctional A_f, where f is the functionality. The extends of the functional groups are p_Aand p_B, respectively. The ratio of all A groups, both reacted and unreacted, that are part of branched units, to the total number of A groups in the mixture is defined as rho. This will lead to the following reaction A-A + B-B + A_f rightarrow A_{f-1}-(B-BA-A)_nB-BA-A_{f-1} The probability of obtaining the product of the reaction above is given by p_A[p_B(1-rho)p_A]^np_Brho, since the probability that a B group reach with a branched unit is p_Brho and the probability that a B group react with non- branched A is p_B(1-rho) . This relation yields to an expression for the extent of reaction of A functional groups at the gel point p_c= frac {1}{{r[1+rho(f-2)]}^{1/2}} where r is the ratio of all A groups to all B groups. If more than one type of multifunctional branch unit is present and average f value is used for all monomer molecules with functionality greater than 2. Note that the relation does not apply for reaction systems containing monofunctional reactants and/or both A and B type of branch units. = Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi model = Gelation of polymers can be described in the framework of the Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi model or the Lushnikov model, which answers the question when a giant component arises.

Givan (1921‚Äì2009) served as the 96th Justice of the Indiana Supreme Court from January 6, 1969 until his retirement December 31, 1994. He served as Chief Justice from 1974 until March 1987. Early life Givan was born June 7, 1921 in Indianapolis. He graduated from Decatur Central High School in Indianapolis in 1939. He received an LL.B. from Indiana University in 1951, and was admitted to the Indiana bar in 1952. While he was a law student, he was assistant librarian for the Indiana Supreme Court in 1949, and then became a research assistant for the Indiana Supreme Court. He was appointed deputy public defender of Indiana after graduation from law school and served in that post until 1954. Career From 1954 to 1966, he was Assistant Attorney General of Indiana, pleading cases before both the Indiana and Supreme Courts. In 1967, he was a representative and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee in the Indiana Legislature. He was elected to the Indiana Supreme Court in 1968 and served continuously until his retirement in December 1994. He was also Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Indiana Judicial Conference from 1974 to 1987, served on the Board of Managers of the Indiana Judges Association from 1975 to 1987, and became an Indiana Judicial College Graduate in 1989. In addition to his legal career, Givan served as a pilot in the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II and was later a flight instructor with the Air Corps Reservists. Controversy In 1984, a group known as \\"Remember Baby Doe - Retire Judge Givan Committee\\" sought to ouster Givan from his position as Chief Justice after the Indiana Supreme Court refused to hear a case regarding the death of an infant with Down syndrome. The group placed several advertisements in Indiana newspapers and asked voters to oppose Givan in the November 6 election. Givan denied claims that the decision established \\"quality of life\\" as a judicial criterion. Givan explained that the Supreme Court was only asked to determine if the original court had jurisdiction over the matter. Death Richard Givan died on July 21, 2009, in Plainfield, Indiana. On July 23, 2009, Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels ordered all flags at the Statehouse and across the state be flown at half-mast as a tribute to Chief Justice Givan. The flags were to remain at half-mast through July 28, 2009, the date of Givan's funeral.http://www.wishtv.com/dpp/news/indiana/Flags_lowered_for_Ind_chief_justice_20090723  References  1921 births 2009 deaths Politicians from Indianapolis Members of the Indiana House of Representatives Chief Justices of the Indiana Supreme Court United States Army Air Forces officers United States Army Air Forces pilots of World War II 20th-century American judges ","title":"Richard M.

Brannen is heralded as an \\"underground legend,\\" and has been active as a songwriter and performer since the early 1980s. Biography=Early life= Brannen was born into a prominent and storied Southern family in Savannah, Georgia, United States. His parents first met at a diplomatic function in China, where his mother worked for the American consulate. Brannen's father, a cotton broker of some note, died unexpectedly and under strange circumstances in Brazil shortly before John was born. After his father's death, Brannen's mother moved to the coastal town of Bluffton, South Carolina where she would later raise John with help from her father. It was through his maternal grandfather ‚Äì a man of stature with a predilection for classic poets, especially Tennyson and Longfellow ‚Äì that Brannen first came into touch with his passion for lyricism and, subsequently, music. By the time he turned eighteen, Brannen had hitchhiked across the United States, surfed extensively in Hawaii, and sailed the West Indies. It was around this period in time that he became acquainted with Waylon Jennings, who he cites as \\"the voice,\\" and his paramount influence. After a brief stint at The College of William & Mary where he planned to major in political science, Brannen abandoned secondary education for a career in music. =Career= In the 1980s, Brannen spent time in New York City and Nashville before being wheedled into a move to the West Coast by Joe Walsh, guitarist for the Eagles, who had become a friend and mentor of Brannen's. The move to Los Angeles quickly paid off, as Brannen landed an artist deal at the Capitol Records imprint, Apache Records. His Apache debut, Mystery Street found its way into the Top 20, and the music video for his first single \\"Desolation Angel\\" garnered considerable attention as an MTV Hip Clip. By 1993, in the wake of the success of Mystery Street, Brannen was signed by the recently renamed Mercury Nashville Records. His eponymous debut for Mercury Nashville contained the single \\"Moonlight and Magnolias,\\" which became a Top 10 hit on VH1. In an effort to launch Brannen's career, Mercury Nashville chose him for one of three slots on the Triple Play Tour. The remaining two slots were filled by Shania Twain and Toby Keith. In the wake of the Triple Play Tour, Brannen went on a self-imposed hiatus, settling in Charleston's French Quarter and \\"burying himself in the sand,\\" as he has put it. Seven years passed between his eponymous Mercury Nashville debut and Scarecrow, his 2000 release for Corazong Records. After Scarecrow, Brannen was signed by Sly Dog Records. Since his return to the limelight in 2000, Brannen has been compared to Bruce Springsteen, John Mellencamp, Tom Petty, and Jackson Browne. Of these comparisons, Springsteen is the most frequently posited. The Good Thief and Twilight Tattoo, released in 2004 and 2006, respectively, are his most recent records. Twilight Tattoo, which features \\"A Cut So Deep,\\" a duet with Lucinda Williams, was co-produced by Brannen and David Z. Most recently, Brannen has had success as the songwriter of \\"Somebody\\" which appeared on Eagles album, Long Road Out of Eden, and was co-written with Brannen's longtime collaborator and friend, Jack Tempchin.

As Scholar-in- Residence for the 2008 Bard Music Festival, he edited the essay collection Sergey Prokofiev and His World (Princeton University Press, 2008). Among his other publications are essays on Ravel's ballet Daphnis et Chlo√©, Rimsky- Korsakov, Scriabin, Shostakovich's ballet The Bolt, numerous reviews and shorter articles, including pieces for the New York Times, New York Review of Books, and London Review of Books. Morrison is actively engaged in the performing arts, most notably ballet, and has translated his archival findings into new productions. In 2005 he oversaw the recreation of the Prokofiev ballet Le Pas d'Acier at Princeton University and in 2007 co-produced a world premiere staging of Alexander Pushkin's drama Boris Godunov featuring Prokofiev's incidental music and Vsevolod Meyerhold's directorial concepts. In 2008, Morrison restored the scenario and score of the original (1935) version of Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet for the Mark Morris Dance Group. The project involved orchestrating act IV (featuring a happy ending) from Prokofiev's annotations and rearranging the order and adjusting the content of acts I-III. This version of the ballet was premiered on July 4, 2008 and began an international tour in September. He has also recently brought to light Prokofiev's score Music for athletes/Fizkul‚Äôturnaya muzyka (1939), which Morrison describes as \\"cheerful, sardonic music composed for a scary political cause: a Stalinist (totalitarian) display of the physical prowess of Soviet youth.\\" In the spring of 2010, he staged Claude Debussy's final masterpiece, the ballet The Toy-Box (La bo√Æte √† joujoux), using a version of the score premiered in 1918 by the Moscow Chamber Theater that features a previously unknown \\"jazz overture.\\" Also newly staged was the original version of John Alden Carpenter's jazz ballet, Krazy Kat (1921), based on the iconic comic strip. In February 2012, Morrison oversaw a world-premiere performance of Prokofiev's incidental music for Eugene Onegin, set to a playscript by Sigizmund Krzhizhanovsky. A concert version was performed by the Princeton Symphony Orchestra, and the play staged by Princeton faculty and students. Both performances were part of a conference Morrison co-organized at Princeton, \\"After the End of Music History\\", celebrating the career of musicologist Richard Taruskin. Recently Morrison collaborated with the Penguin Cafe Orchestra to present a revival of Within the Quota (1923), a ballet with music by Cole Porter. The production was featured on NPR, the BBC World News America, and in a news story by the AP.

Then, it was proposed to be carried to Jupiter by the Jupiter and Trojan Asteroid Explorer (Trojan Asteroid Explorer). The discussion for the international collaboration for a Jupiter mission between ESA and Japan (JAXA) started in 2006. By 2007, the orbiter was proposed for a lift-off in 2020 together with ESA's Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter (JGO) from which it would undock upon its arrival at Jupiter in 2025/2026.JMO - Orbit and Operation (2008)New Projects in Progress¬∏ Solar Sails.

The JMO objective was to undertake detailed in situ studies of the magnetosphere of Jupiter as a template for an astrophysical magnetised disk for \\"3-point\\" investigations of the Jupiter system via synergistic observations with other orbiters. The size and weight of the JMO would have been limited to carry a payload up to 10 kg, equivalent to 2 to 3 scientific instruments. In order to conduct observations never made before, the spacecraft would have carried an X-ray imaging spectroscope, featuring different wavelengths from instruments onboard NASA's Juno probe. In November 2013, Japan's JAXA scientists stated that ‚Ä≥it is difficult for JAXA to launch the outer planet mission by itself to meet the time constraint for cooperative observation with JUICE. Therefore, direct collaboration with European groups/team should be necessary for Japanese scientists to participate in this attractive Jupiter system mission.‚Ä≥ The outcome was the selection of four Japanese instrument development teams for 4 of the 10 Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE) mission instruments.

Contribution Samartha was acknowledged as a leading authority on inter- religious dialogue. S. Wesley Ariarajah quotes Samartha on dialogue: =Criticism= Criticism wasn't too far. Sunand Sumithra in his doctoral dissertation defended at the University of T√ºbingen, Germany in 1981 criticised (page 217) the work of Samartha arguing that Samartha failed to project Christ's distinctness in a pluralistic context. However, Samartha responded that Sunand Sumithra was not aware of the beliefs of other faiths. Kirsteen Kim believed that Sunand Sumithra was indeed aware of the beliefs of others and only wanted to distinguish Christ from others. Further, Sunand Sumithra in a book on Christian Theology from an Indian Perspective evaluated Samartha's writings. He summarised that Samartha resorted to Advaitic system not on theological grounds but on mere empirical enquiry.Sunand Sumithra, Christian Theology from an Indian Perspective, Theological Book Trust, Bengaluru, 1995 (Revised Edition). pp.187-197. Similarly, Ken Gnanakan of the South Asia Institute of Advanced Christian Studies, Bengaluru argued that Samartha's writings failed to uphold the Biblical Text in a setting of theology of religions. Sunand Sumithra and Ken Gnanakan may have been right in their argument if one looks into a recent doctoral work by Dirk GriffioenDirk Griffioen, Christian Mission and Worldreligions: The Theology of Religion of Gustav Warneck, Hendrik Kraemer and J.E. Lesslie Newbigin in Context, Doctoral Dissertation submitted to the Utrecht University, 2007. p.583. submitted to the Utrecht University where Dirk brings to light the fact that Samartha rejected the Dutch Reformed Theologian Hendrik Kraemer's version of Christology stating that it was Christomonistic and not theocentric. Samartha first met Hendrik Kraemer in Bossey during his sabbatical in Basel. Stint at WCC After being relieved as Principal of Serampore College, Serampore in 1968, Samartha served as Associate Secretary, Department of Studies in Mission and Evangelism in Geneva up to 1971 working closely with Hans-Jochen Margull, Professor of Missions at the University of Hamburg, Hamburg. It was at the Central Committee meeting at Addis Ababa in 1971 that a sub-unit of the WCC Dialogue with People of Living Faiths and Ideologies was set up with Samartha as its first Director.S.

Rugby career  Phillips came to note as a rugby player while playing for first class club Cardiff and in the 1879/80 season he was elected as club captain for the first team. Phillips would keep the captaincy for three seasons in total, the first player to regain the captaincy in the club's history.Marshall, Francis Football; the Rugby union game (1892) Cassell and company Ltd. pg 265 In 1881, Phillips was selected to play for the first representative Welsh international team, in a game against England. Phillips was one of four Cardiff players in the first match, along with B. B. Mann, Barry Girling and Leonard Watkins. The Welsh team were humiliated when the English scored 13 tries without reply, and the press attacked the Welsh Union secretary Richard Mullock for choosing a 'private' team of friends and elitists rather than the best players available.Smith (1980), pg 470. Phillips himself was a strong supporter of Mulloch, and when Mulloch was challenged in his position as secretary, it was Phillips, along with Horace Lyne, who voiced their opinion strongest in his support.Smith (1980), pg 52. Despite the heavy defeat, Phillips was re-selected to play for Wales in the next game against Ireland, one of only four players to hold their place. Under the captaincy of Charles Lewis, Wales beat the Irish by two goals and two tries to nil. Despite the win, Phillips would miss the next two Wales games, but was back in the squad for all three of the matches in the 1884 Home Nations Championship.

A central result of CSV approach is that it is generally optimal to commit to a partial, state- contingent disclosure rule. Robert M. Townsend (1979) has shown that under few strong assumptions the optimal financing mechanism is a standard debt contract for which there is no disclosure of the debtor's performance as long as debt as honored, but there is full disclosure (verification) in case of default. Viewed from the CSV perspective, the main function of bankruptcy institutions is to establish a clear inventory of all assets and liabilities and to assess the net value of the firm. The standard setup for financial contracting problems in CSV framework involves two risk-neutral agents, a wealth- constrained entrepreneur with an investment project, and a wealthy investor with capital available. The fixed capital invested in the project generates random cash flow at future time t with probability distribution over the possible range of profits. The entrepreneur has private information about realized cash flows from the project, but it can credibly disclose them to the investor by incurring certain cost. The solution to this problem should provide ex-ante optimal contract structure which specify in which scenario realized cash flow should be audited and certified. With no audit the entrepreneur would never be able to raise any money from investor since rational investor anticipates that the entrepreneur will lie about realized profit to avoid paying back to the investor. However, in CSV framework regulated mandatory periodic disclosure of entrepreneurial performance is not efficient and imposes excessive disclosure costs. The optimal financial contract in CSV model gives the creditor the right to all assets of the project in the event of default at fixed bankruptcy cost that must be incurred to collect the proceeds. The results that standard debt contract is optimal does not hold in case of multiple investors or multiple risky projects undertaken by the entrepreneur.

Further series include My Weird School Daze (2008-2011), My Weirder School (2011-2014), My Weirdest School (2015-2018) and My Weirder-est School (2019-). The series takes place in a school whose teachers display bizarre traits, with each title focusing on a specific teacher. The main character, A.J., is a boy who hates school. His rival is a girl named Andrea, who loves school and who has a friend, Emily, that A.J. considers a \\"crybaby.\\" Much of the humor is derived from the plot's unlikely situations and the teachers' personalities which are written to be \\"outlandish.\\" Gutman was initially inspired to write the books after being exposed to the Junie B. Jones series by Barbara Park and wanted to write something similar from a boy's point of view. Gutman says that he has been inspired by visiting real-life schools, going to 60 schools a year to gather material. He has also stated that his goal in writing the books is to interest children in reading and especially to make reading fun for children who have difficulty in school. The series' defining characteristic of strange teachers comes from Gutman's belief that children enjoy reading about \\"grownups doing dumb things.\\" Gutman feels that along with having his own son, the series My Weird School helped launch his writing career.

Audiobook versions of My Weird School have been bundled together with books 1-4 released together. During lockdowns associated with COVID-19, Gutman has hosted a \\"My Weird Read-A-Loud\\" series. Gutman has also read online from the My Weird School series for #OperationStoryTime on Instagram, Facebook and YouTube. =Reception= Kirkus Reviews said that the first book, Miss Daisy is Crazy!, is \\"a sure-fire hit for the most reluctant reader.\\" Publishers Weekly also notes that the series is a good choice for beginning readers. The Reading Teacher mentioned the series in their 2008 article on choosing books for children that they will enjoy reading. Some books, such as Class Pet Mess!, do contain more challenging vocabulary. Mrs. Cooney Is Looney! uses homophones to provide humor. My Weirder School continues the trend of using humor that began in the My Weird School series. Booklist calls the series habit forming, writing, \\"Fortunately, the habit is reading.\\" Booklist has also called the depiction of some of the adults in the series as \\"satire.\\" The Weird School Fast Facts series has been reviewed favorably. School Library Journal called the drawings \\"hilarious\\" in both My Weird School Fast Facts: Sports and My Weird School Fast Facts: Geography. School Library Journal also noted that Gutman's writing was especially suited to his audience of younger readers. Booklist wrote that Sports was entertaining and informative. My Weird Writing Tips is a book written to help students become better writers. School Library Journal wrote that the book makes \\"grammar entertaining,\\" but criticized the introduction for not being sensitive to the issues faced by bilingual students and others who have trouble with grammar. Booklist, however, felt that My Weird Writing Tips was extremely funny and informative for a broad group of young readers. Kirkus Reviews found the book to have useful information even if the tone of the book was \\"disingenuous at times and too self-consciously fun.\\" The first four books released as an audiobook in 2005 were read by John Beach. His narration was good at capturing the voices of the characters in the stories, according to Booklist. School Library Journal praised the narration of Jared Goldsmith on the audiobook, Miss Cooney Is Looney!, for capturing the voice of A.J. in a way that \\"brings him to life.\\" The series has been very successful with young readers, although Common Sense Media notes in a review that the series sometimes reinforces gender stereotypes. The series also receives criticism for characters having caricatured personalities and repetitive plots.

From the multiplicity of invertebrates and vertebrates, two have been chosen as symbols of Saskatchewan. Cenozoic vertebrate fossils reveal the geological evolution of the interior plains and its prehistoric biogeography. Today, Saskatchewan's ecosystems range from the sub-arctic tundra of the Canadian Shield in north Saskatchewan to aspen parkland, the Mid-Continental Canadian forests in the centre of the province and grassland prairie. Fauna inhabit areas unique to their own specific and varied breeding, foraging and nesting requirements. With a large land and water area, and small population density, the ecoregions of Saskatchewan provide important habitat for many animals, both endangered and not. Naturalists observing wildlife have enumerated shrinking and growing wildlife populations. They advocate programs and methods to preserve or re- introduce endangered species and identify programs of control for outbreaks of wildlife populations. A broad diversity of wildlife habitats are preserved as parks and reserves protecting the feeding and breeding grounds of protected and indigenous fauna of Saskatchewan. Provincial symbols The sharp-tailed grouse (Pedioectes phasianellus jamesi) was declared the symbol of Saskatchewan in 1945. As of 2001, the provincial animal is the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Ancient fauna - paleontology Mercycoidodon culbertsoni prehistoric camel type mammal Fossils have been uncovered which have dated back to the Paleocene, Eocene, Oligocene, Miocene, and Pleistocene periods. These Cenozoic vertebrates include mammals, amphibians and reptiles. There have been fossils of birds unearthed as well which have dated back (55.8¬±0.2 to 33.9¬±0.1 Ma) to the Eocene and 23.03 to 5.33 Ma to the Miocene period. Historically mammoths and mastodons which migrated across the Bering land bridge from Eurasia roamed the plains. Black bear, Bison antiquus, Bison latifrons, bobcat, Bos bison, caribou, cheetah, Columbian mammoth, elk, grizzly bear, horse, ice age elephant, llama, lion, moose, one-hump camel, pronghorn, saber-toothed cat steppe bison (Bison priscus), white-tail and mule deer, woolly mammoth populated the plains in pre-historic eras. American bison, commonly known as \\"buffalo\\" is the largest and most notable mammal found in Saskatchewan dating back to its ancestors Bison antiquus, and Bison latifrons. Large reptiles such as mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs and sea turtles lived in the seas which covered Saskatchewan, Triceratops fossils were also unearthed. A scampering non-hopping rabbit Palaeolagus Temnodon and Megalagus were some of the Eocdene-Oligocene mammalian paleofauna uncovered at the Cypress Hills Formation of Saskatchewan. An abundance of Calf Creek Local Fauna has been unearthed at the Cypress Hills Formation. Eastend is about southeast of this site. The following microvertebrates have been located Daphoenacyon dodges, Daphoenus, Daphoenine or bear dog; Parictis parvas, P. Nimravid or small bear; Hesperocyon gregarious or small fox-dog; Hemipsalodon grandis or subjective synonym of Pterodon, and Hyaenodon horridus H. microdon or carnivorous hyaena. Artiodactyls are even toed hoofed mammals such as deer, pigs, camels, goats and cattle. Among the 53 mammalian taxa of fossils from the Swift Current area are the Cypretherium coactatum or terminator pig;Adrienne Mayor. Fossil Legends of the First Americans. Princeton University Press, 2005. p. 213 Ibarus storer, I. ignotus, or herbivorous fast running small deer the size of a rabbit; Merycoidodon culbertsoni Leidy or camel type mammal that lived in herds; Limnenetes anceps or a cud chewing plant eating sheep sized hippopotamus; Hendryomeryx esulcatus, Leptomeryx speciosus and L. mammifer or small hornless ruminant; Didelphodus serus or meat eating marsupial about the size of a Virginia opossum or house cat; Thylacaelurus campester; Wallia scalopidens is a fossilised proscalopid insectivore bat; Auxontodon processus; Microparamys solidus The Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary marks the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event which saw the extinction of many of these prehistoric animals which remain only as fossil remnants. Native species=Vertebrates=Mammals - Mammal fauna Mammal species differ between the various ecoregions of Saskatchewan. Members of six orders of placental mammals which inhabit Saskatchewan. They are the bats, carnivores (including the pinnipeds), artiodactyls, cetaceans, insectivores, and rodents (including the lagomorphs). Barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus) There are fewer varieties of species as elevation increases which corresponds to the Taiga and Boreal Shield and Cypress Hills Uplands econzones. Mammals which endure the harsh environment in the far north Taiga shield, Boreal Shield and Boreal Plain ecozones are American black bear (Ursus americanus), barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus), western moose (Alces alces anderson), hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus), wolverine (Gulo gulo), American marten (Martes americana), timber wolf (Canis lupus occidentalis), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), mink (Neovison vison), snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), and red-backed vole (Myodes). The Athabasca Plain ecoregion supplies lichen as winter forage for the woodland caribou. The Arctic fox as their predator is also found in this region. As well as the mammals of the Taiga Shield ecozone, little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus), Canadian lynx (Lynx canadensis), timber wolf, Canadian beaver (Castor canadensis), muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) are found in the Boreal Shield ecozone The beavers dam small streams throughout Saskatchewan. The muskrat and beaver were exploited for their fur and beaver pelts. Beavers are still trapped for the fur trade industry and were almost extirpated in the first half of the 20th century. The Mid-Boreal Upland ecoregion within the Boreal Plains Ecozone features white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus), silver-haired bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans) and the other mammals of the northern boreal forests. There is a lower population of mammalian wildlife amidst the fens, marshes, bogs and swamps that demark the muskeg area of the Mid-Boreal Lowland. The large mammals of the northern Taiga Shield and Boreal ecozones can still be supported in this transitional area, however elk, reindeer, wolf are animals of the boreal forest.American badger (Taxidea taxus) As well smaller mammals such as Keen's myotis (Myotis keenii), northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus), fisher (Martes pennanti), ermine (Mustela erminea), North American river otter (Lontra canadensis), least chipmunk (Tamius minimus) and short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) are sighted along with snowshoe hares, and white-tailed deer in the Boreal Transition ecoregion. Carnivores which prey on these creatures such as lynx and wolves are also located in the area. The Aspen Parkland is agricultural land. The most prominent wildlife species which may be found are coyote (Canis latrans), hare, striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum), Richardson's ground squirrel (Spermophilus richardsonii), snowshoe hare, cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), northern pocket gopher (Thomomys talpoides), Franklin's ground squirrel (Spermophilus franklinii) and red fox. The Aspen Parkland is the environment of choice for the white-tailed deer. jack rabbit The Moist Mixed Grassland ecoregion is characterized by white-tailed deer, pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), coyote, rabbit, American badger (Taxidea taxus), red bat (Lasiurus borealis) and ground squirrel such as black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus). Animal populations of the Mixed Grassland enumerate pronghorn, white-tailed and mule deer, long-eared myotis (Myotis evotis), small-footed myotis (Myotis subulatus), jack rabbit, coyote, Richardson's ground squirrel. The only Canadian site of black-tailed prairie dog is in the Mixed Grassland prairie ecoregion. The raised elevation of the Cypress Upland results in white spruce and aspen forests and an ecoregion more resembling the boreal forested areas than the prairielands. Moose, pronghorn, mule and white- tailed deer, elk, rabbit, and ground squirrel coyote are common in this ecoregion. Birds - avifauna Across Saskatchewan there are breeding, wintering, migration, breeding and wintering, and summering (non-breeding) grounds for 414 species of birds.(recorded 1998) migrants follow flyways which can be determined by banding.Common loon owls, grouse, and finches overwinter in the province. Bird species which can be found in the northern Taiga Shield ecozone, Selwyn Lake Upland ecoregion, include Harris's sparrow (Zonotrichia querula,), pine grosbeak, (Pinicola enucleator), grey-cheeked thrush, Catharus minimus, tree sparrow (Passer montanus), spruce grouse (Dendragapus canadensis), willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus), sandhill crane (Grus canadensis), waterfowl and shorebirds. As a part of the Tazin Lake Upland, prominent birds are common loon, greater yellowlegs (Tringa melanoleuca), white-crowned sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys) and golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos). The Athabasca Plain ecoregion in the Boreal Shield provides breeding grounds for the Bohemian waxwing (Bombycilla garrulus), white-winged crossbill (Loxia leucoptera), Cape May warbler (Dendroica tigrina), Canada goose (Branta canadensis) and blackpoll warbler (Dendroica striata). In the south west area of the Boreal Shield ecozone lays the Churchill River Upland which has the second highest population of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). American white pelican (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) Its arrival is a sign of spring arriving. This Upland area is home to waterfowl, such as the common loon (Gavia immer), red-breasted merganser (Mergus serrator), as well as other ducks, and geese on the many lakes of the region. The raven (Corvus corax), spruce grouse, Canada jay (Perisoreus canadensis), Connecticut warbler (Oporornis agilis), northern three-toed woodpecker (Picoides dorsalis), osprey (Pandion haliaetus) and hawk owl (Surnia ulula) can be sighted in the boreal forests. The Mid-Boreal Upland ecoregion features these characteristic birds: white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis), red- tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), American redstart (Setophaga ruticilla), bufflehead (Bucephala albeola), ovenbird, (Seiurus aurocapillus) and hermit thrush (Catharus guttatus). The ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus), Canada warbler (Wilsonia canadensis), ruby-crowned kinglet (Regulus calendula) and white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis), American white pelican (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) are common sightings in the Mid-Boreal Lowland ecoregion. Burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) Diverse bird species populate the Boreal Transition ecoregion such as black and white warbler (Mniotilta varia), boreal chickadee (Poecile hudsonicus), great-crested fly-catcher (Myiarchus crinitus) and neotropical migrant bird species. The predominant avifauna of the Aspen Parkland are house wren (Troglodytes aedon), least flycatcher ( Empidonax minimus), yellow warbler (Dendroica petechia) and western kingbird (Tyrannus verticalis). Sharp-tailed grouse (Tympahuchus phasianellus), ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus), black-billed magpie (Pica pica), cormorant (Phalacrocorax spp.), ring-billed gull (Larus delawarensis), glaucous-winged gull (Larus glaucescens) and neotropical migrant bird species. The Aspen Parkland with its many sloughs and saline lakes provides breeding grounds for ducks and other waterfowl, black tern (Chlidonias niger), Forster's tern (Sterna forsteri), American white pelican. American robin, (Turdus migratorius) The arrival signals one of the first signs of spring. Typical birds of the Moist Mixed Grassland ecoregion include waterfowl around ponds and sloughs and the western meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta), yellow-headed blackbird (Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus), piping plover (Charadrius melodus), sharp-tailed grouse, eastern kingbird (Tyrannus tyrannus), and Franklin's gull. The Mixed Grassland in southern Saskatchewan features these characteristic birds ferruginous hawk Buteo regalis, long- billed curlew (Numenius americanus), yellow-breasted chat (Icteria virens), chestnut-collared longspur (Calcarius ornatus), burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) and sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). Characteristic birds of the Cypress Upland ecoregion are trumpeter swan (Cygnus buccinator), sage grouse, golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), yellow-rumped warbler, MacGillivray's warbler (Oporornis tolmiei), dusky flycatcher (Empidonax oberholseri) and Townsend's solitaire (Myadestes townsendi). There is one species of avifauna found only in the Cypress Upland, Audubon's warbler (Dendroica coronata auduboni). Amphibians and reptiles - herpetofauna Leopard frog (Rana pipiens) Typical reptiles in the Mixed Grassland ecoregion are the horned lizard (Phrynosoma), common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis), common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina), and prairie rattlesnake, and western painted turtle (C. p. bellii). The leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) and chorus frogs (Pseudacris) are typical amphibians of the Grasslands National Park. Fish - ichyofauna The lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus), white sucker (Catostomus commersoni), longnose sucker (Catostomus catostomus), burbot (Lota lota), lake herring (Coregonus artedi), lake whitefish, (Coregonus clupeaformis), walleye or pickerel (Sander vitreus), and northern pike (Esox lucius) are fish found in the freshwater lakes in Saskatchewan. Perch (Perca flavescens) swim alongside the northern pike, walleye, lake trout in the Mid-boreal lowland. The lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), goldeye (Hiodon alosoides), and bigmouth buffalo (Ictiobus cyprinellus) are fish species of the Saskatchewan river.Lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) Streams and ponds throughout the Saskatchewan prairies may be stocked with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), brook (Salvelinus fontinalis), and brown trout (Salmo trutta morpha fario and S. trutta morpha lacustris). Catfish (Sluriformes) and carp (Cyprinidae) range through the Frenchman river. There are significant commercial fisheries for both freshwater and salt-water species. The Fort Qu'Appelle Fish Culture Station stocks lakes and streams in this way winter killed lakes are replenished. =Invertebrates= Monarch (Danaus plexippus) Amongst the invertebrates, typical insects of the Moist Mixed Grassland ecoregion are monarch (Danaus plexippus), mosquito (Anopheles quadrimaculatus), rose curculi, yellow jacket wasp (Vespula pennsylvanica), sow bug (Malacostraca isopoda), bumblebee (Bombus ternarius), blue-winged olive (Ephemerella cornuta), daddy longlegs (Opiliones), dragonfly, grasshopper (Melanoplus differentialis), harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex), and two-spotted lady beetle (Adalia bipunctata). Gardeners and horticulturists have identified various hemipterans during the growing season affecting their cash crop such as aphids, including the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), English grain aphid (Macrosiphum avenae), and green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), spruce gall adelgid (Adelges cooleyi), fairy shrimp (Anostraca) pine needle scale (Chionaspis pinifoliae), tomato psyllid (Bactericera cockerelli), greenhouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum), aster leafhopper (Macrosteles quadrilineatus) alfalfa plant bug (Adelphocoris lineolatus), tarnished plant bug (Lygus lineolaris), and black grass bug (Labops hesperius). Freshwater invertebrates of Saskatchewan typically consist of clams (Pelycypoda) (Mollusca Bivalvia), mollusca (Gastropoda and Pelecypoda), leech (Hirudinea), freshwater earthworm Oligochaeta, virile crayfish (Orconectes virilis), Scud (Amphipoda), fairy shrimp (Anostraca), Copepod, water flea (Cladocera), clam shrimp (Conchostraca), water mite (Hydrachnida) caddisfly (Trichoptera), damselfly (Zygoptera), mayfly (Ephemeroptera), alderfly (Megaloptera), seed shrimp (Ostracod), and tadpole shrimp (Notostraca). Invasive species The zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), a non-native species is currently posing a serious threat to Saskatchewan waterways, as it has overtaken nearby freshwater habitats. zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) During the 1930s gophers (Richardson's ground squirrel, Spermophilus richardsonii, and thirteen-lined ground squirrel, Spermophilus tridecemlineatus) by the thousands were eating crops and burrowing holes which injured horses. The government offered a nickel for every tail turned in. The Rocky Mountain locust (Melanoplus spretus) was a small invertebrate which darkened the skies. In 1875 they covered the American and Canadian plains eating everything in the grasslands. By 1902 they disappeared mysteriously and became extinct. Growing resistant crops, and utilising oats and peas are new methods of control where and when there are grasshopper (Camnula pellucida) outbreaks. Protected species The burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) is an endangered species.swift fox (Vulpes velox) They inhabit holes created by other animals such as Richardson's ground squirrel (gopher), prairie dog, fox, coyote, and badger. Their decline is due to habitat loss due to agricultural, residential and highway lands, and pesticide spraying. Another endangered species, the swift fox (Vulpes velox), has been bred in captivity and re-introduced into protected habitat areas. Lake sturgeon is a Species at Risk in the prairie provinces. buffalo (bison bison) In 1691 the buffalo (bison bison) roamed the prairies by the thousands. \\"The Buffalo (were) so numerous (that the riders were) obliged to make them sheer out of our way.\\" -Henday Bone beds have been uncovered showing mass kills of bison herds at the base of buffalo jumps and within wood and stone corrals. Habitat destruction from homesteaders breaking the land combined with hunting practices brought the huge population to near extinction. Similarly, vast flights of passenger pigeons (Ectopistes migratorius) were reported by Peter Fidler in the early 19th century. The sky darkened for hours as flocks of migrating pigeons passed. Forest habitat destruction and wholesale hunting brought the passenger pigeon to extinction. The eskimo curlew (Numenius borealis), a shorebird who was also seen historically in great numbers met a similar extinction due to changing habitats and diminishing numbers from hunting. Black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes) Associated with the eradication program of the prairie dog (gopher) in the 1930s was the dramatic decline in population of the black- footed ferret (Mustela nigripes) which relied on the prairie dog as its main source of food. The lowered population was hastened as the natural habitat of the ferret was also being taken over by agricultural machinery and practices. Biodiversity conservation Piping plover (Charadrius melodus) Chaplin, Old Wives, Reed Lakes (Hemispheric) - Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network (WHSRN) Site is a designated Hemispheric Shorebird Reserve Network protecting three saline lakes, saline and freshwater marshes. This area is a breeding site for the endangered piping plover. 67,000 other birds in over 30 species make use of this area. The Prince Albert National Park affords protection to a breeding ground of the American white pelican which has been designated as a threatened species. Quill Lakes International Bird Area which houses over one million shorebirds annually is a RAMSAR international wetlands area recognized by the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network Site (WHSRN). Redberry Lake World Biosphere Reserve is a United Nations saline lake bird sanctuary. Last Mountain Lake or Long Lake the first federal bird sanctuary, and the Dundurn Military Reserve are preserved areas of natural habitat. Protected areas include Cypress Hills Provincial Park, Douglas Provincial Park, Danielson Provincial Park, Blackstrap Provincial Park, Pike Lake Provincial Park. Approximately 80% of the wetlands in this ecoregion have been lost. The only Canadian colony of prairie dogs is protected in the Grasslands National Park. Ord's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ordii) is found only in the Great Sand Hills. High populations of sharp-tailed grouse and mule deer reside in the Great Sand Hills area. The Aspen Parkland has been mainly converted to agricultural cropland and grazing lands. Bronson Forest is original parkland, Pasquia Hills provincial forest, Porcupine Forest, and Nisbet Forest are reserved tracts of land. mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) Highways are threat to wildlife populations. The porcupine's defense mechanism against predators is to crouch and raise quills which results in highway accidents and roadkill of this rodent. Deer and other large ungulates are a hazard to traffic resulting in potential animal or human deaths especially in the autumn mating months or when deer are searching for feeding grounds in the spring. The defense mechanism of deer in the face of a threat is to freeze. There are over 3,500 deer - auto collisions per year in Saskatchewan. A number of measures have been implemented to increase awareness such as fencing, feeding programs, automobile whistles. Saskatchewan Wildlife Federation has launched \\"Slow Down and Save a Buck\\" sign campaign. Deer mirrors along the edges of highways were installed for reducing deer-vehicle collisions. The Wildlife Warning System is triggered by highway vehicles, setting off lights, sounds and or odours ahead of the approaching vehicle to frighten away animals. A system that detects vehicle was installed in 2002 near Harris to reduce the quantity of mule deer - automobile accidents for a two-year testing period. (repositories.cdlib.org) Another system detects large animals and sets off a warning system to drivers of vehicles alerting them that an animal is on or near the highway ahead of time. The major threats to natural habitat are logging, pesticide use and oil and gas exploration. Destruction of habitats by forestry or agriculture change population levels. Removal of forests raising prairieland increases the population of Aspen Parkland and prairie habitat animals. Increasing prairieland and reducing the boreal forest reduces animals which depend on the forest for survival. Trapping, shooting and poisoning are direct threats to mammals. Dumping sand, clearing vegetation on shorelines, leaking septic tanks, dams and weirs are threats to fish populations. Removal of forests to increase agricultural lands creates a habitat loss which is a threat to the avifauna population. Naturalists Peter Fidler (1769‚Äì1822) naturalist, surveyed and mapped Saskatchewan and wrote reports on wildlife observation. Loring Woart Bailey (1839‚Äì1925), naturalist studied algae and identified diatoms in Saskatchewan. Archibald Stansfeld Belaney, Grey Owl (1888‚Äì1938) conservationist lived in the Prince Albert National Park and appeared in films advocating wildlife preservation.

History The aftermath of the Second Vatican Council saw many religious communities re- evaluating their roots and the particular charism of their founders. In the summer of 1975, the Sacred congregation for Religious and Secular Institutes found that the Sisters of Christian Charity and the group of sisters led by Provincial Superior Cook held very different views of religious life. The solution was for the latter to separate and form a distinct congregation.Shea SLW, Genevieve. \\"Sisters of the Living Word: 1975-1995\\" Living Word Center One of the consequences of the separation in 1975 was a sense of being pilgrims. Traditionally, most congregations have what is known as \\"motherhouses.\\" There was no way the new Community could establish that kind of headquarters for administration purposes. In the first year of foundation, the Leadership Team and the administrative staff of the SLW moved into a partially used convent at St. Juliana Parish, Chicago. By 1981, a search for a more permanent site began. An intensive investigation led to the 1985 purchase of Ridge School, a closed public school in Arlington Heights, Illinois. A massive reconstruction project was completed in 1990 and the Leadership Team and administrative staff moved into the Living Word Center in February, 1990. Formal Approval The Constitution Committee led the congregation through the various stages of writing. The final draft, written by Annamarie Cook, was sent to Rome. On August 6, 1992, Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, Archbishop of Chicago, presented the Sisters of the Living Word their document of final approval as a religious community in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago. During the Liturgy, each Sister received her copy of the Constitutions and renewed her vows as a member of the newly approved Community. The day was a culmination of seventeen years of shared vision. The Leadership Team is made up of three sisters, elected by the congregation, who serve for a term of five years.\\"Leadership Team\\", SLW Apostolate In the beginning, the founding members continued to work in education.

It is one of seven games released for the DSi's Art Style series of video games. It was announced on January 26, 2009, was released two days later alongside Somnium, another Art Style game, and was released in North America and PAL regions in the same year, on May 18 and May 22 respectively. In Picopict, players use the touchscreen to move coloured blocks into a formation, such as a four-block line or a 2x2 square. This contributes to an 8-bit image, which consist of various Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) characters, such as Mario, Link, and Bowser. Picopict was an anticipated release due to its presentation. Since its release, Picopict has received a very positive reception from publications such as IGN, GameSpy, and writer Stephen Totilo. It was nominated for best DS puzzle game of the year from IGN and won best DSiWare game of the year from Nintendo Life. It had critics, including Pocket Gamer and GameSpot, the latter finding it too difficult and imprecise. A fellow developer of downloadable video games, Gaijin Games, praised it for its gameplay and presentation. It received some attention in sales, appearing on the DSiWare's top 20 best- selling games chart for several weeks following its release, peaking at 10. It has been compared to Tetris by several people, though UGO's Paul Furfari bemoaned such a comparison, saying that its presentation set it apart. Gameplay The objective of Picopict is to move coloured blocks from the bottom of the touchscreen under falling blocks of corresponding colors. If a shape is made using the added block, the blocks add to an image on the top screen. For example, if players form a red block sequence, the image will gain as many red blocks as has been cleared, assuming that any blocks of that colour remain to be added. If blocks fall as a result of clearing blocks that were attached to it, they are added to the blocks at the bottom and can be used, though a special variety of block exists that cannot be picked up, forcing players to either clear them before they land or wait for the right blocks to fall on them. As players clear more blocks, they will eventually form an image. These images are of 8-bit renditions of characters from NES games, such as Mario, Link, and Bowser. Players' performances are judged on two qualities - their score and their time taken to complete a level. A high score is often achieved by comboing clears, a task accomplished by either clearing blocks before a clear from before has finished, or having blocks fall and form a clear as a result of a previous clear. On the side of the touchscreen is an item called a \\"POW Block\\", which players may use to clear the bottom two lines and drop all midair blocks, but sacrifices a reserve space with each use. Coins earned in the stage can be used to regain the lost reserve spaces. There is a more difficult version of each stage called \\"Ura\\", \\"Dark\\" or \\"Remix\\". These stages are locked initially, and can only become playable by using coins, which are achieved by clearing certain kinds of blocks. These coins can also be used to purchase songs that appear in the in- game store; the initial purchase includes only the original version of the song, while the remixed version can be purchased for an increased price. These songs can also be listened to while the Nintendo DSi is closed. Development Picopict was revealed in a display of DSiWare titles by Satoru Iwata on January 26, 2009, alongside Code, Aquia, and Nemrem. Both it and Nemrem were released two days later in Japan. It was developed by Skip Ltd. and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DSi's DSiWare service. The North American release came on May 18, 2009. It was later released in PAL regions on May 22, 2009. While the European release of Picopict retained the Japanese name, the Australian and North American releases changed the name to Pictobits and Pictopict respectively. Reception Picopict has received a positive reception. It holds an aggregate score of 83/100 and 84.64% from Metacritic and GameRankings respectively. This made it the 37th best Nintendo DS game and the 1,201st best video game on GameRankings. For the weeks ending June 10 and June 17, Picopict was the 10th best-selling DSiWare game. It was the 15th best-selling DSiWare game for the week ending June 24, and 18th for the week ending July 2. It ranked 20th the next week, falling off the charts the week afterward. Nintendo Life's Brody Olimar called Picopict one of the first great title on the DSiWare service, commenting that it was a good value and had nothing to complain about. Nintendo Life also named it the best Nintendo DSiWare game of the year.http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2010/01/nintendo_life_game_of_the_year_results Giant Bomb's Brad Shoemaker commented that it looked like the \\"best thing on DSiWare\\". In his review, Shoemaker called it a \\"tough, rewarding puzzle game that will take you a while to master, and even longer to unlock all the available content\\". N-Sider's Matt Behrens called it one of the best Art Style games, along with Cubello. He added that if they make more DSiWare like it, he would recommend the DSi to more people. Nintendo World Report's Nick DiMola called it one of the DSiWare and Art Style games, calling it a \\"fun but challenging\\" game. Developer of the Bit.Trip series, Gaijin Games, praised it for its music and its \\"simple yet intuitive\\" gameplay. Though they criticized it for its touch controls and its difficulty level, they add that players become more skilled as the game goes on, making the latter not much of a problem. Official Nintendo Magazines Chris Scullion praised it for its retro graphics and music, as well as calling it \\"fiendishly addictive\\" and a \\"great value\\". However, they noted it as a \\"very difficult\\" game. In his impressions of Picopict, IGN's Craig Harris called it \\"one of the most ambitious \\"match three\\" style puzzle games I've ever played\\". Harris later reviewed it, calling it \\"unique, clever, fast-paced, and highly addictive\\". IGN awarded it as the Game of the Month for the Nintendo DS in May 2009, commenting that players will \\"have a hard time putting this unique puzzle game down\\". They also nominated for best Nintendo DS puzzle game of 2009 for both their award and the readers' choice award. They ranked it as the fifth best DSiWare game as of April 7, 2010. Stephen Totilo gave it overwhelming praise, citing specifically its challenge, old-school presentation, and the abundance of content; he adds that he could not come up with any cons, wishing that they would make a 16-bit sequel. In a later article, he praised the composers YMCK, who he forgot to mention in his review. He suggested that Picopict had the best video game soundtrack of 2009 up to that point. He later called it one of his favourite games of the first half of 2009. In an article on fine art, Totilo discussed designers' urge to create games with realistic appearances, praising Picopict as a \\"rare modern game with retro graphics\\". Kotaku's Brian Ashcraft listed it on his \\"DS and DSi gift guide\\", calling it a game with a \\"Tetris twist\\" and an \\"artsy retro style\\". He also praised it as one of the best values for the DSiWare, recommending it for anyone who gets nostalgic for the Nintendo Entertainment System. UGO Networks' Paul Furfari called it \\"pure retro love packaged in a clever puzzler\\", commenting that comparing it to Tetris is a \\"disservice\\" due to it putting \\"enough twist on the falling block formula to provide a stylish and full experience\\" as well as the inclusion of an NES theme and YMCK-made retro music. In another article, he included it in his list of 25 video games that went overlooked in 2009, commenting that its chiptunes give it a \\"ton of character\\". Game, Set, Watch's Eric Caoli commented that it was \\"criminal\\" that Picopict did not end up on many game of the year lists in 2009. In discussing the Art Style series, GamePros Dave Rudden commented that it was one of the series' games that seemed like a \\"potential classic\\". GamePro called it a \\"great downloadable hit\\" for the DSiWare. GameSpy's Brian Altano called it \\"highly recommended\\". PALGN's Adam Ghiggino called it \\"totally awesome\\", calling its gameplay \\"addictive and unique\\". 1UP.com's Steve Watts recommended PiCOPiCT for Nintendo fans. In spite of all the positive reception, Pocket Gamer's Jon Jordan commented that it wasn't the \\"most welcoming or spectacular game in the DSi Shop\\" due to its \\"plonky music\\" and \\"8-bit inspiration\\". Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell, in his impressions of Picopict, commented on the presentation, calling the visuals \\"warm\\" and the soundtrack \\"immersive\\". Similarly, GameSpot's Tom Mc Shea found fault in the title; while he enjoyed the Nintendo cameos and the concept behind the game, he found the controls imprecise and the difficulty too high.

It aired on January 26, 2009. Plot Sarah, a 29-year-old special education teacher, coughs up blood and collapses. ITP (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura) and lymphoma are considered. House orders the team to start Sarah on methotrexate for the ITP and also wants to give her total body irradiation. Cameron has been hired by Cuddy as a temporary replacement. The methotrexate is not working. House therefore has his team double the dose and add prednisone, as well as fake the radiation treatment. While she is being \\"irradiated\\", she needs to urinate. When she gets up, she collapses. Thirteen and Taub discover that she has no pulse and defibrillate her. Meanwhile, Wilson visits Cuddy. Cuddy reveals that she is having trouble bonding with Rachel. Wilson tells her to just give it time. Also, Foreman is troubled by his discovery that Thirteen is on a placebo, and consults with Chase about surreptitiously switching her to the real thing. Chase tells him that this is unwise. Tests revealed no structural heart defects, and after some deliberations the possibility of cold agglutinin disease is raised. House wants to give the patient an ice bath to confirm, and goes to Cameron again. Cuddy stops by at the hospital. She has found out about Cameron's permissiveness with House and admonishes her. House barges in while the two are talking. He brings up Cuddy's bonding problem, and suggests giving Rachel up. Cuddy leaves, and Cameron tells House to perform a test on a sample of the blood before trying the cold bath. The blood clots when exposed to cold, but when the patient is put in the cold bath, her vital signs remain normal. While she is in the cold bath, Sarah recounts a story about how she became a special needs teacher. Six years ago, she transposed a room number and went to the wrong class. House decides that this is a sign of a left hippocampal lesion due to multiple sclerosis and wants a brain biopsy. Kutner suspects a pancreatic tumor and wants to perform an ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography). Both go to Cameron, who orders him to scan the patient's brain first. The MRI is normal, but when Kutner performs the ERCP, Sarah begins to have trouble breathing ‚Äì she has pleural effusions. House now suspects equine encephalitis and tries to get approval for a nerve conduction test. He goes to Cameron again, who stands up to House and denies the procedure. Thirteen and Foreman go to the school to look for any sign of equine encephalitis but find nothing. Thirteen expresses her interest in being a mother. Wilson again visits Cuddy's house, with a picture frame of what Rachel will roughly look like in 18 years. He tries to convince her that, right now, Rachel is only a baby who is not able to interact with Cuddy in the way she expected, but in time she will. After this, House goes to Cameron again, and pressures her into letting him run the nerve conduction study. A skeptical Kutner calls Cuddy and puts her on speakerphone in the middle of the procedure. Cuddy talks to House and the team. Sarah reveals that she is becoming annoyed by the crying, but her blood pressure falls significantly and the test is ended. The annoyance intrigues House, however, as it seems that Sarah is normally very tolerant of annoyance. While the procedure is ongoing, a desperate Cuddy pleads with Rachel to stop crying. Rachel stops crying, and Cuddy finally feels a bond. Also, Foreman, having asked everyone else he knows, goes to House about switching Thirteen's drugs. House tells him that rationally it is not worth it. Cuddy stops in his office with Rachel. She lets House hold Rachel, who throws up on House's shirt. Suddenly, House realizes what is wrong with Sarah: a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The ductus arteriosus allows blood to bypass the lungs while developing (since there is no air and the lungs are filled with fluid). When the infant is born, it normally closes, but Sarah's opens during periods of stress, draining deoxygenated blood into her aorta. This means that her brain does not get normal levels of oxygenated blood (the explanation for this causing unilateral brain damage is impossible due to the Circle of Willis). It also disrupts normal pulmonary blood flow resulting in the pleural effusions and causes excessive turbulence in the bloodstream causing the damaged platelets. At Cuddy's house, Cameron decides to quit, saying that she will always say \\"yes\\" to House due to their relationship, and that any other person would always say \\"no\\" ‚Äì Cuddy is the only one that can do the job. Finally, Foreman decides to risk his medical career for Thirteen's sake and switches her from the placebo to the real drug, while Cuddy is shown rushing to work again, leaving Rachel at home with a caregiver (but not before giving her baby a kiss). As Cuddy walks toward the door, the baby suddenly starts crying again. Cuddy pauses a moment with the strain of separation showing in her face, but then continues without looking back.

Members of the superfamily are small to large browsing mammals, roughly pig- like in shape, with short, prehensile snouts. Their closest relatives are the other odd-toed ungulates, including horses and rhinoceroses. Taxonomically, they are placed in suborder Ceratomorpha along with the rhino superfamily, Rhinocerotoidea. The first members of Tapiroidea appeared during the Early Eocene, 55 million years ago.

A Bajrang Dal member in his early life, he formed the Karnataka unit of the Shiv Sena after being expelled from Bajrang Dal. He quit Shiv Sena over the Belgaum border dispute, and then formed Sri Ram Sena. He gained media attention when around 40 activists of the Ram Sena barged into a Mangalore pub and attacked young men and women, insisting that these people were violating the traditional Indian values. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state government banned him from entering Mangalore, following which he campaigned against the party in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections. In March 2014, he joined the Karnataka unit of BJP, but was forced to quit within hours due to widespread criticism and protests from other members. He contested the 2014 Lok Sabha elections as an Independent Candidate from Bangalore South and Dharwad constituencies in Karnataka, but lost both.  Hindutva activism  Pramod Muthalik was born in 1963 to a Brahmin family in Hukkeri in the Belgaum district of Karnataka.A fast mover, peddling his brand of Hindutva, Hindustan Times He joined the RSS in 1975. In 2004, he became the convenor for South India for the Bajrang Dal. The cases are relating to making inflammatory speeches, inciting hatred between religious groups, conducting training with intent to carry out violence. Pramod Multhalik has over 45 cases pending against him, and is wanted by the police in 11 districts of Karnataka. Most of these cases are still under investigation and relate to subversive activities, defiling religious books, unlawful assembly, violating prohibitory orders, and evading judicial warrants. Most were filed between the years 2000 and 2008. A look at the chargesheet makes it clear that he has never been arrested for any of these cases. On 19 February 2000, Muthalik spoke at Malebennur in Harihar taluk of Davanagere district. He remarked at minority communities and questioned their loyalty to the nation. The Harihar police filed a case under Section 153A of the Indian Penal Code. Two years later, the district magistrate banned his entry into Malebennur and surrounding areas. On 10 January 2002, he was banned from entering the Bailhongal taluk in relation to communal incidents in Kittur. The ban also included fellow Bajrang Dal leaders Vilas Pawar and Manoj Hanagal. Muthalik is an admirer of Nathuram Godse, who assassinated Mahatma Gandhi and regularly attends an annual function in Pune to mark the death anniversary of Godse.  Shiv Sena  In 2005, Muthalik was expelled from Bajrang Dal. Subsequently, in August 2005, he set up the Shiv Sena's Karnataka unit, stating that he wanted a political platform to advance the objectives of Hindutva. He was accompanied by the former district president of the Bajrang Dal for Belgaum, Vilas Pawar, and some 5,000 workers belonging to the Bajrang Dal, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Bharatiya Janata Party. This marked the formation of the Shiv Sena in Karnataka. Muthalik quit the Sena in 2006 after the party revived its demand for the merger of the Marathi speaking areas like Belgaum with Maharashtra. He then formed the Rashtriya Hindu Sena.NDTV.com: What is Sri Ram Sena?  Sri Ram Sena  After quitting Shiv Sena, Muthalik established Sri Ram Sena in 2006. In 2009, the Ram Sena men led an attack on a Mangalore pub, where women were beaten. Muthalik defended the attack saying that girls going to pub was against Indian culture. He also questioned the media and the government on their silence on the illegal Bangladeshi infiltrators. Following the attack, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state government banned him from entering Mangalore. In response, he campaigned against BJP in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, calling it \\"corrupt and anti- Hindu\\", but refused to contest the polls himself. In 2014, he joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Karnataka state unit, but was forced to exit in hours after protests from other members. After Goa's Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar banned his entry to the state, he said \\"BJP has become a Bharatiya Jesus Party\\".https://web.archive.org/web/20140829092247/https://www.mangalorean.com/news.php?newstype=broadcast&broadcastid;=506251 In 2018, he along with 24 others were acquitted by the court from the charges related to 2009 Mangalore pub attack.

The organization heading this attempt refers to itself as the nascent Sanhedrin or developing Sanhedrin, and regards itself as a provisional body awaiting integration into the Israeli government as both a supreme court and an upper house of the Knesset. The Israeli secular press regards it as an illegitimate fundamentalist organization of rabbis. The organization, which is composed of over 70 rabbis (similar to the composition of the original Sanhedrin), claims to enjoy recognition and support from the entire religious Jewish community in Israel. However, it is totally ignored by the Haredi community, and has stirred debate in both religious and secularist circles. There has not been a \\"full meeting\\" of the Sanhedrin since 2005.  Precedents  The 12th century scholar, Maimonides, discussed the seeming incompatibility of the essential requirement of Jewish Law for a Sanhedrin, and the inability to form one due to the loss of semikhah. In his magnum opus, the Mishneh Torah, he proposed a procedure to re-establish a Sanhedrin. This later became the subject of legal rulings by Rabbi Jacob Berab, Rabbi Yosef Karo and others. There have been several attempts to implement Maimonides' recommendations. The current attempt is the sixth in recent history. It is modeled after the attempt by Rabbi Jacob Berab in 1538, and follows attempts by Rabbi Yisroel of Shklov in 1830, Rabbi Aharon Mendel haCohen in 1901, Rabbi Zvi Kovsker in 1940 and Rabbi Yehuda Leib Maimon in 1949.  The election process and selection of Rav Halberstam  Maimonides and other medieval commentators suggested that, although the line of semikhah (Biblical ordination) from Moses had been broken in 425 CE, if the sages in the land of Israel agree upon a single candidate being worthy of semikhah, that individual would have semikhah, and could then grant it to others, thus enabling the re-establishment of the Sanhedrin. According to the new Sanhedrin's website,\\"The idea behind the restoration of the Great Court, and the halakhic foundations for operation\\" the process of election was explained by Rabbi Dov Levanoni, a member of the new Sanhedrin. He said the most recent attempt to renew the institution of semikhah in 2004 was made through a consensus of hundreds of the most influential and scholarly rabbis living in Israel. While Rabbi Yaakov Beirav and Rabbi Yosef Karo laid an excellent halachic (Jewish law) foundation for understanding this teaching of Maimonides, the current attempt to re-establish the Jewish Sanhedrin has tried to learn from previous attempts and avoid some of the pitfalls. For example, to avoid claims that not all the rabbis of Israel were aware of the latest attempt to set up the Sanhedrin, an initial enormous expenditure was spent on a publicity campaign of the upcoming semikhah process, 50,000 copies of a detailed flier were distributed among 4,500 Jewish centers in Israel, outlining that a vote of a first samuch was going to be held, along with contact information of the Va'ad ha-Mechonen la-Sanhedrin. Not long afterwards, seven hundred leading Rabbonim were contacted either in person or by written letter. R' Levanoni explained that Rabbi Moshe Halberstam, a senior Rabbi on Jerusalem's Edah HaChareidis, became the first samuch after receiving approval by Israel's leading rabbis ‚Äì those followed by most of Israel's religious Jews ‚Äì and there were no objections from the hundreds of rabbis consulted via written letters. The website also claims that leading sages have supported the semikhah directly or indirectly or abstained, and specifically mentions these names, though with no proof: Rabbi Yosef Shalom Eliashiv, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Rabbi Zalman Nechemia Goldberg and many others gave their blessing but did not join the Sanhedrin. The son of Rabbi Mordecai Eliyahu is one of the rabbis ordained. Former Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi and Rosh Yeshiva of Merkaz HaRav Kook Rabbi Avraham Shapira chose to abstain on the issue but also refused to discourage it. Rabbi Halberstam (April 1, 1932 - April 26, 2006), who was selected to receive Semikhah by consensus, was a relatively well known figure and widely respected. Rabbi Halberstam was the son of Grand Rabbi Yaakov Halberstam of Tshokava (a scion of the Sanz dynasty) and of the daughter of Rabbi Sholom of Shotz of London. He was the rosh yeshiva of the Tshokava Yeshiva in Jerusalem and one of the most prominent members of the Edah Charedis Rabbinical court of Jerusalem. He was known as a tremendous Torah scholar and a decisor of halachic law. He wrote approbations to many works of Torah literature. Rabbi Halberstam served at the President of Hatzolah Israel. He was also the Rabbi of the Shaarei Tzedek Hospital in Jerusalem. He was known for his tolerance towards other streams of thought in Orthodox Judaism. Despite his own Chareidi anti-Zionist background, he also maintained contacts with Modern Orthodox, religious Zionist leaders. The website does not claim that these figures supported the creation of a Sanhedrin, only that they supported the reinstitution of Semikhah. Rabbi Dov Shtein, the secretary for the Sanhedrin project, claimed that Rabbi Halberstam understood where his actions would lead. Rabbi Dov Shtein said \\"Without Rabbi Halberstam's efforts toward renewing semikhah, it would not have happened the way it did. ... By agreeing to be the first to be ordained, he took a serious risk of being rejected and condemned by his community for taking part in such a project, which set the ball rolling for the foundation of a Jewish legal body that seeks to eventually supersede the Badatz. But despite the serious pressures put on him following his agreement and granting of semikhah to others, he never went back on it or even tempered his agreement with the act of renewing semikhah.\\"  The formation of a placeholder Sanhedrin  The Sanhedrin website explainsRabbi Yaakov Beirav's attempt to re-establish a Sanhedrin in 1538 \\"To avoid disagreements over who was worthy to sit on the Sanhedrin, a Beis din of 71 was immediately formed. It was formed with the best scholars available, with the public announcement every one of them has agreed to step aside the moment a more deserving candidate should step forward. Lastly, the Nasi has indicated that the Beis din would wait until the best scholars of Eretz Yisroel were represented on the Beis din before beginning to fully function halachically as the Sanhedrin of old.\\" Inauguration of the Sanhedrin in 2004 In October 2004, a group of over few hundred rabbis representing varied communities in Israel undertook a ceremony in Tiberias, where the original Sanhedrin was disbanded, with about one hundred of them at the time having proper Semikhah. This was one year after the re-establishment of Semikhah. A Beth Din of 71 was formed. Rabbi Tzvi Eidan, the author of Asot Mishpat (on the laws of reestablishing the Sanhedrin) was appointed as first interim Nasi. Rabbi Adin Steinzaltz, a noted Talmudic scholar and a well-known Jewish philosopher is the currently elected Nasi. The Sanhedrin's spokesmen said that due to concerns that external pressure would be brought to bear upon individuals not to take part in the establishment of a Sanhedrin, the names of most participants would not be made public. Some of its more known members were:Current members of the Sanhedrin * Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, a well-known Talmudic scholar who began translating and commentating on the Talmud in 1965, established a network of schools in Israel and Russia, and has received honorary degrees from Yeshiva University, Bar Ilan University, Ben Gurion University and Florida International University * Rabbi Nachman Kahane, a graduate of Yeshivat Mir,and Novardok Yeshiva a rabbinic scholar and the rabbi of the Young Israel of Jerusalem's Old City. He is the brother of slain Jewish leader and Knesset member Rabbi Meir Kahane, who founded the American Jewish Defense League and the Israeli Kach party. He is currently working on an interpretation of the Tosafot of the Talmud. He is also the director of the Institute for Talmudic Commentaries and has created a database of reliable Kohanim in Israel. * Rabbi Yoel Schwartz, a graduate of Ponevezh yeshiva in Bnei Brak and Mir yeshiva in Jerusalem, a well-known Torah scholar and a prolific writer of over 200 Jewish books. * Rabbi Dov Levanoni, a Holocaust survivor, a prolific author and the author of Hamikdash, a description and model of the Second Temple according to Maimonides and other opinions. * Rabbi Yisrael Ariel is the founder of the Temple Institute (Machon HaMikdash), which focuses on preparations for the rebuilding of the Third Temple. As a young man, he served in the paratroop unit that liberated the Western Wall (kotel) in the Six-Day War. For the 1981 Knesset elections, Rabbi Ariel ran as number 2 on the Kach list. His involvement predates the party's split after the death of party leader Rabbi Kahane in 1990 (who was assassinated by Egyptian El Sayyid Nosair), and the party's later designation as a terrorist Jewish group by the United States and Israel in 2001.Individuals and Entities Designated by the State Department under E.O. 13224: (75) * Rabbi Yehuda Edri is a Torah scholar, supervisor and principal for the Chareidi Shas Party's El Hamaayan Educational system. He is an expert on the location of the Temple and its measurements. * Rabbi Yosef Dayan the author of several books in Hebrew, Spanish and Italian. He also worked to translate modern Spanish literature into Hebrew. Yosef Dayan emigrated to Israel in 1968 and became a member of the right wing Kach movement. Some Jewish genealogists consider him to be a patrilineal descendant of King David and thus a \\"prince\\" or Nassi of the ancient Davidic royal line. Yosef Dayan is the founder of \\"Malchut Israel\\", a right wing monarchist political group in Israel advocating a return of the monarchy.  The acceptance of office of Nasi by Rabbi Steinsaltz  Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz On the other hand, apparently few Sanhedrin members see the nascent Sanhedrin with such an extreme messianism. The acceptance of office of Nasi by Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz was marked with an apparent change in direction. The newspaper Haaretz reported that in his speech accepting the position of Nasi, Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz said that the task of building the Sanhedrin will take some time. He spoke about gradually building up the ancient institution, which would take several generations. Steinsaltz said that the Sanhedrin would not get involved in politics: \\"I'm not afraid of the Supreme Court, the police or the attorney general. A rabbi is also permitted to engage in public issues, but to do so he has to have all the appropriate material before him, whether he is dealing with the kosher status of a chicken or the disengagement.\\" Under the influence of Rabbi Steinsaltz, the Sanhedrin project shifted away from idealistic projects of its first year and tried to move toward broadening participation. Steinsaltz requested that the new Sanhedrin not be referred to as \\"the Sanhedrin\\", but requested modest references to the current institution as the nascent Sanhedrin, the developing Sanhedrin, the Sanhedrin project, or simply the Rabbinical Court of 71 judges (Beis din shel 71). Steinsaltz was reportedly changing the direction of the new Sanhedrin, widening the scope and acceptance of the Court with the intention of moving towards becoming the full Sanhedrin. According to their website, the strategy to gain wider acceptance and \\"provide a smooth transition from current halachic leadership to a full Sanhedrin\\", is to follow these guidelines: absolute adherence to traditional Rabbinic authorities and procedure; caution and conservatism; independence from any other organization; scholarship; and an open dialog with the Torah sages and current halachic leadership (with the eventual goal of their participation). On their forum it was put this way, \\"the [new] Sanhedrin should hold no surprises. It should be as comfortable as opening a Gemara [Talmud] or as familiar as reading the Shulchan Arukh. It should be the embodiment of Judaism as we know it today.\\"Sanhedrin Forum In 2008, Rabbi Steinsaltz resigned from his position.  The current Sanhedrin's view of government  The new Sanhedrin's website portrays the Sanhedrin as a form of Rabbinic Parliament, part of a bicameral system that they claim reflects traditional Jewish government.Special Court For Matters Concerning The Nation and the State They claim that this model has influenced the organizational structure of many Western European legislatures.Examples are given concerning division of authority, the name \\"Senate\\", even semicircle seating. They describe the roles of an upper and lower house: * The Sanhedrin is described as a \\"House of Scholars\\". This body represents the \\"rights and obligations\\" of the people to the \\"Torah Constitution\\" which they define as including \\"the Torah, Talmud and body of Rabbinic Jurisprudence that has been built up over our history as a people\\".Sanhedrin Forum * A parallel \\"Congressional Assembly\\" represents the \\"democratic needs of the population\\". It is conceived as being derived from the royal court of a constitutional monarchy, in a democratic society it would consist of an assembly of regionally elected representatives, represented by voting power. (The head of the lower house was traditionally the Monarch, or in a modern times a Prime Minister. He would have the power to collect taxes and would be the head of the executive branch of government. He would be subordinate only to the Sanhedrin.) The Sanhedrin would function as an equal legislative body to a democratically elected body, but it would also function as a supreme judicial body with regard to interpreting basic law, or what they call a \\"Torah Constitution\\". It appears that this structure in the Sanhedrin context implies a democracy functioning within a Torah Constitution. From an Israeli point of view this implies adding a second house to the Legislature, changing the Knesset electoral system from nationwide Proportional Representation to First-past-the-Post voting, and declaring a Basic Law requiring Israeli civil law to function within Jewish law. = Torah constitution = This agenda requires a focus on efforts to institute a theocratic or critocratic system of government in which \\"the authority of government depends on Jewish law\\", so that secular government institutions and laws would be subordinate to, and function within, Jewish law as determined by the Sanhedrin. The Sanhedrin has declared itself to have authority to veto democratically enacted laws which it determines are contrary to the laws of Torah. It has made this very clear in, among other pronouncements, its \\"Decision of the Sanhedrin concerning the State Elections\\". The Sanhedrin announced that it is seeking a state in which any matters contrary to what Jewish law defines are \\"issues that cannot be decided by vote\\": > Torah \\"Basic Law\\": Laws which are contrary to the laws of the Torah are not > laws of the Jewish people, and therefore they are invalid. Any law which is > contrary to the laws of Torah, legislated by the \\"Knesset\\" (including > legislated amendments) or interpreted as such by judicial sources is a > disqualified law. The authority to decide in these matters has been > unconditionally expropriated by the central religious court based on the > Torah (Bible) [the Sanhedrin]. In an exercise of its claim to authority over \\"matters concerning the Land of Israel\\", the Sanhendrin has issued a series of decisions declaring the Israeli pullout from Gaza invalid. In a statement, the Sanhedrin prohibited Jews from cooperating with the Government, saying: \\"The Prime Minister's program of uprooting stands in direct contradiction to the Torah of Israel\\", \\"the decision of this government ... is null and void\\", \\"No Jew is permitted to cooperate\\" and \\"Any Jew ‚Äì including a soldier or policeman ‚Äì who supports the uprooting ... transgresses a large number of Torah commandments.\\" Commenting on the war against Hizbollah in August 2006, the new Sanhedrin also claimed that it is the only authorized national institution to deal with the legal aspects of warfare and to give policy directives to the State concerning warfare. It claims that enacting legislation concerning warfare always has been a distinguishing feature of the historical Sanhedrin.  The current attempted Sanhedrin's actions  Sanhedrin in session, 2005 A great deal of discussion on the Sanhedrin forum appears to indicate that the new Sanhedrin is currently taken up with philosophical discussions about the theory of Jewish Law. The point is repeatedly made that the Sanhedrin \\"must solve many complex halakhic issues\\" before it can begin to make any statement or decision in terms of Jewish law. It claims its projects are \\"coordinated in complete consultation with the Gedolei Hador (leading halachic authorities of the generation) as well as with the Israeli Government Authorities, academics and professionals.... The Sanhedrin Initiative seeks to empower Jews to perform national mitzvot that thanks to technological advances and/or sociological developments are currently or imminently in the realm of the possible.

Eliyahu Warns Bush: Jews Never Forget  Controversy  According to their website, they explain that they do not seek controversy. Their spokesman said, \\"The rebirth of the Sanhedrin is a slow, ongoing process. Although it makes headlines and many like to highlight its controversy, it is in truth a humble project by rabbis from all sides of the Torah world joining together simply to fulfill a Torah commandment. Rather than a source of religious division, G-d forbid, it is a vehicle to bring about Jewish unity and civil justice, to help repair some of the deepest rifts in our society, and to provide an active, exemplary and unified Torah leadership so lacking in our times.\\"TheSanhedrin.org: The idea behind the restoration of the Great Court, and the halachic foundations for operation While not actually creating division among the different Jewish groups, the new Sanhedrin has generated a great deal of debate about its purpose and potential. While most Jews see the new Sanhedrin as an attempt by a fringe group to re-establish the Temple, many have seen it as a potential vehicle to champion a specific cause. = The debate stirred within the National Religious camp = The National Religious camp took great interest in the new Sanhedrin with the hope that it may be useful in preventing the disengagement from Gaza. The Arutz-7 news service ran approximately 30 articles covering the actions of the new Sanhedrin in a positive light. The new Sanhedrin came out with several strongly worded, yet muted, rulings against \\"disengagement\\". They strongly disagreed with the government action, advocated non-violent protests, but fell short of condoning any form of stronger protest to prevent expulsion from Gaza or Hebron as had been hoped for by some members of the National Religious camp. Coverage of the new Sanhedrin since \\"disengagement\\" by the Arutz-7 news service has been almost non-existent since that event. During the 2006 Israeli elections, the new Sanhedrin was widely expected by the National Religious to fully endorse the political party of Baruch Marzel. Instead the Sanhedrin released a general statement, echoing statements by most of the Hareidi parties, that \\"one is obligated to vote, and one must vote for a religious party\\". In 2006, representative leadership of the new Sanhedrin issued a statement against the permissibility of conscientious objection to participation in the war in LebanonShould military call-up orders be heeded for the war in Lebanon with mixed reactions from the National Religious camp. = The debate stirred within the Haredi camp = Haredi Leadership  When Rabbi Yehudah Leib Maimon in 1949 tried to form a Sanhedrin out of the Israeli Chief Rabbinate, leading rabbis of the Haredi world repeatedly voiced their strong opposition in a number of declarations. The Brisker Rav, the Chazon Ish and others were some of the more vocal opponents of that initiative. Rabbi Avraham Yeshayah Karelitz, (the Chazon Ish) quotes the Radvaz that no one is fit to renew the Sanhedrin. He concluded that any discussion of the topic in this \\"orphaned generation\\" is ludicrous.Chazon Ish: Choshen Mishpat Likutim 1Dei'ah veDibur: Opinion & Comment, \\"Meoros HaDaf HaYomi\\" Insights into the Week's Learning However, although there is clear Haredi opposition to the new 'Sanhedrin', unlike the case of Rabbi Yehudah Leib Maimon's attempt, there has been no official response by any Haredi leader or Jewish Court (Beit Din) to this 'Sanhedrin'. The 'Sanhedrin' itself claims that the current attempt is very different from the previous attempt and that leading sages like Rabbi Yosef Sholom Eliashiv, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Rabbi Moshe Halberstam, and Rabbi Zalman Nechemia Goldberg, have expressed support for, and consented to, the renewal of Semikhah. To date, none of these Rabbis have commented on these claims. It has been met, in public at least, by silence. The new Sanhedrin itself and its supporters claim that it proves there is quiet support. The Haredi community however interprets this to mean that the new Sanhedrin is simply another fringe group not worthy of comment, or even a fabrication.  Haredi community and media  The lack of response by the leadership has given pause, but has generally reinforced the feeling in the Haredi world that the 'Sanhedrin' is a complete non-issue, and it is generally ignored by the Haredi press. It is considered a fringe group and is considered unrelated to the Haredi community. The members of the new Sanhedrin are not considered as belonging to the Haredi community. The Lithuanian Haredi Yated newspaper, which expresses the official opinion of the Lithuanian Haredi rabbinical establishment, has run several articles condemning Rabbi Yisrael Ariel and his 'Temple Institute' using the expression \\"poisonous opinions\\".Dei'ah veDibur: Opinion & Comment, What is Geulah?Dei'ah veDibur: Beis Din Rejects Machon Hamikdash Petition Against Yated Ne'eman It appears, however, that this opinion is not shared by all the Haredi communities.The Temple Institute: The Rabbinical Guests The Yated has also run articles condemning Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, referring to strongly worded comments made by Rabbi Elazar Shach in 1989.Letter dated Erev Shabbos Kodesh Pinchos 5749, Michtovim Umaamorim vol. IV.Dei'ah veDibur: Opinion & Comment, Purity in Education by Rabbi N.Z. Grossman It is disputed whether Rabbi Elazar Shach really opposed Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz in his final days, as it is claimed that Rabbi Steinsalz met with the rabbinical court in Jerusalem (Edah HaChareidis) making required changes and thereby resolving the issue. It is clear that Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz' untraditional and 'university oriented' approach is at odds with the Haredi approach. While not all leading members of the Sanhedrin have generated such controversy, and some members like Rabbi Yoel Schwartz are generally recognized as scholars within the Haredi community, they are generally unknown figures. In addition, the new Sanhedrin is seen as identifying with the extreme-right factions of the National Religious movement because some of its members ascended to a portion of the Temple Mount. While there is disagreement between various orthodox groups on this point,Temple Mount: Jewish Religious Law Concerning Entry to the Site and MaimonidesMaimonides specifically states that there are areas on the temple mount that we are permitted to enter today even when all Jews are ritually unclean. He writes that in 1165 he visited Jerusalem and went up on to the Temple Mount and prayed in the great, holy house (probably the Al-Aqsa mosque). (Sefer HaCharedim Mitzvat Tshuva Chapter 3) and the RadbazShaarey Teshuvah, Orach Chaim 561:1, cf. Teshuvot Radbaz 691 ascended to the Temple Mount, modern Haredi legal opinions as well as many National-Religious authorities, including the Israeli Chief Rabbinate, do not allow this. As Yated Neeman writes, \\"all halachic authorities categorically forbid it.\\"Dei'ah veDibur: Opinion & Comment, Don't Be Conspicuous, by Yisroel Spiegel  Conclusion  Although the new Sanhedrin claims that it is in touch and even coordinating with some Haredi leaders, no basis to support these claims can be found. The overriding response to the new Sanhedrin by the Haredi community has been driven by the fact that leadership of the new Sanhedrin is unknown or controversial, and the decisions of the new Sanhedrin are perceived as identifying with the extreme wings of the National Religious community. The Haredi community tends to simply ignore the new Sanhedrin or ridicule it. = Yemenite opinion = Rabbi Yosef Qafih, former Chief Rabbi of Yemen, wrote in his commentary to the Mishnah tractate Sanhedrin that it would be a very good thing to reinstate the Sanhedrin in our days. However, he held, according to the position of the Rambam, that this could only be done by assembling all leading Torah scholars physically together at one time.Cf. Maimonides' Mishneh Torah, Hilchos Sanhedrin, Rabbi Yosef Qafih edition = The debate stirred within the Kahanist camp = Rabbi Nachman Kahane is a leading member of the new Sanhedrin. His brother Rabbi Meir Kahane was widely known for his outspoken political views. Rabbi Nachman Kahane, a graduate of Yeshivat Mir, is not known for his political views and is generally acknowledged to be an accomplished Torah scholar by the Mizrachi (Religious Zionism) and Haredi communities. The new Sanhedrin is often mentioned on political websites run by movements associated with the late Rabbi Meir Kahane, and in general it seems that they support both the concept of the new Sanhedrin, and the possibility of religious government of the State of Israel. = The debate stirred within the \\"Temple Mount Faithful\\" camp = In the first year of operation, the new Sanhedrin was involved with discussions about the Temple Mount. It formed a committee to collect opinions as to its exact location. Some of its members ascended to a portion of the Temple mount that was added by Herod and considered by rabbis associated with the Temple Mount Faithful movement to be permitted to Jews. This visit culminated in a declaration that the \\"Jewish people should begin collecting supplies for the rebuilding of the Temple\\".TempleMount.org: Recent Developments in the News Since the acceptance of the position of Nasi by Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, discussion of issues concerning the Temple Mount has greatly diminished. These early actions by the new Sanhedrin were announced and followed closely by websites associated with the Temple Mount Faithful movement. However, for at least a year since the new Sanhedrin's \\"Temple supplies\\" declaration, it appears that no additional material or discussions concerning the new Sanhedrin have been added to these websites. = The debate stirred among non-Jews, especially Evangelical Protestants = Some Christians, like evangelist Hal Lindsey see the reinstated Sanhedrin as good news, believing that the Sanhedrin would be responsible for the rebuilding of the Temple, which would eventually be desecrated by the false Messiah during the end times and inhabited by the true Messiah during the period of Christian eschatology referred to as the Millennial Reign. The Sanhedrin has also selected a group of non-Jewish advisors, scholars and teachers from the Noahide movement - including Vendyl Jones, to form a High Council of Noahides responsible for outreach education from within the non-Jewish world.Sanhedrin Recognizes Council to Teach Humanity ¬¥Laws of Noah' Christian apocalyptic and eschatalogical claims about the End Times, the Last Judgment, and the End of the World, have inspired a wide a range of conspiracy theories. Many of these deal with the Antichrist, the foremost figure of worldly evil from the Book of Revelation. This Antichrist is supposed to be a leader who will create a world empire and oppress Christians. The new Sanhedrin and its connection with the Noachide movement have become the subject of speculation by numerous apocalyptic conspiracy theories on the Internet.

Path Press is a non-profit entity, which handles legal matters and holds the copyrights of all Ven. √ëƒÅ·πáavƒ´ra Thera's writings together with some the writings from others; Path Press Publications is an independent non-profit publisher of books by Ven. √ëƒÅ·πáavƒ´ra Thera and the writings of Samanera Bodhesako. It has its office in the Netherlands. The Path Press is also a society whose goal is to explain and spread the doctrine of the Buddha. It was founded in Sri Lanka in 1987 by Samanera Bodhesako. Originally conceived as a limited effort to publish Clearing the Path but later become an entity who is holding copyrights of writing of √ëƒÅ·πáavƒ´ra Thera and it consist of the small group of 4 bhikkhus and 5 layman (upƒÅsakas) who are aspiring to make late Ven. √ëƒÅ·πáavƒ´ra Thera's teachings more available for those who are interested.  About  Path Press was a name of convenience, originally intended to include those who, through the years, have contributed their various talents to bring Clearing the Path to realization. Path Press was not planned to be an ongoing publishing house. However, it now turns out that there remains sufficient worthwhile materials from the writings of the Venerable Ven. √ëƒÅ·πáavƒ´ra Thera to issue other volumes to the present work; and there are a few other writings, unpublished or now out of print, which, like Clearing the Path, are of high quality, worthy of publication or reprinting. Therefore, it was established a publishing house, called 'Path Press Publications'. These writings are probably not commercially viable; nor do they represent the views of any established sect, school or university which might sponsor their publication. The idea has been put forward that inasmuch as Path Press has already published one book of this type it could use that experience as a basis for issuing those occasional writings which are of exceptional merit and yet do not attract established publishers.  Clearing the Path (1960‚Äì1965)  Ven. √ëƒÅ·πáavƒ´ra Thera. Clearing the Path was the most important work for Path Press. In 1963, √ëƒÅ·πáavƒ´ra Thera completed a book called Notes on Dhamma (1960‚Äì1963), which was privately published by the Honourable Lionel Samaratunga in the same year (250 copies). Following production of that volume, the author amended and added to the text, leaving at his death an expanded typescript, indicated by the titular expansion of its dates, (1960‚Äì1965). Notes on Dhamma has been variously described as \\"arrogant, scathing, and condescending\\",op. cit., p.161 (Letter 3) as \\"a fantastic system\\", and as \\"the most important book to be written in this century\\". √ëƒÅ·πáavƒ´ra Thera himself remarked of the book that \\"it is vain to hope that it is going to win general approval... but I do allow myself to hope that a few individuals... will have private transformations of their way of thinking as a result of reading them\\".op. cit., p.353 (Letter 84) And the influence of Notes on Dhamma on Buddhist thinkers continues to increase more than three decades after its publication. This book has aroused extreme interest and controversy. The Notes \\"attempt to provide an intellectual basis for the understanding of the Suttas without abandoning saddhƒÅ (faith)\\";op. cit., p.305 (Letter 60) that they \\"have been written with the purpose of clearing away a mass of dead matter which is choking the Suttas\\";op. cit., p.339 (Letter 76) and that, above all, \\"the Notes are designed to be an invitation to the reader to come and share the author's point of view\\". The Notes assume that the reader's sole interest in the Pali Suttas is a concern for his own welfare. However, the Notes, with their admitted intellectual and conceptual difficulties, are not the only way to discuss right view or to offer right-view guidance. Letters are a selection of 150 letters written by √ëƒÅ·πáavƒ´ra Thera from his kuti in the Bundala Forest Reserve to local and foreign readers of the Notes who had requested explanation and clarification. Some are thinly disguised essays in a wholly modern idiom. The letters which are collected and published in Clearing the Path are not only something of a commentary on the Notes; they are, independently, a lucid discussion of how an individual concerned fundamentally with self-disclosure deals with the dilemma of finding himself in an intolerable situation, where the least undesirable alternative is suicide. With openness, calmness, and considerable wit √ëƒÅ·πáavƒ´ra Thera discusses with his correspondents (including his doctor, a judge, a provincial businessman, a barrister, a British diplomat, and another British citizen) the illnesses that plague him and what he can and cannot do about them, and about his own existence. His life as a Buddhist monk in a remote jungle abode is not incidental to the philosophy he expounds: the two are different aspects of the same thing, namely a vision that penetrates into the human situation both as universal and as particular, and recognizes that it is this situation which it is the business of each of us to resolve for ourselves. In presenting this view √ëƒÅ·πáavƒ´ra Thera offers a contemporary exposition of the Teaching of the Buddha. In living this view he evokes a dramatic situation wherein an individual resolutely faces those questions which every lucid person must eventually face. The letters are in language, idiom and quotations from a galaxy of thinkers such as Camus, Heidegger, Kierkegaard, Sartre, Kafka. Though familiar to a Western reader, it can be incomprehensible in part, to anyone without such background. Most of the editorial work connected with √ëƒÅ·πáavƒ´ra Thera's writings was performed by SƒÅmanera Bodhesako (Robert Smith), who died in Kathmandu in 1988. During the last years of his life in Sri Lanka he founded Path Press which published Clearing the Path: Writings of √ëƒÅ·πáavƒ´ra Thera (1960-1965). He also worked as editor for the Buddhist Publication Society in Kandy which published The Tragic, The Comic & The Personal: Selected Letters of √ëƒÅ·πáavƒ´ra Thera (Wheel 339/341)The Tragic, The Comic & The Personal: Selected Letters of √ëƒÅ·πáavƒ´ra Thera (Wheel 339/341), Buddhist Publication Society (1987) in 1987.

The Afrasiab painting, also called the Ambassadors' Painting, is a rare example of Sogdian art. It was discovered in 1965 when the local authorities decided the construction of a road in the middle of AfrƒÅsiƒÅb mound, the old site of pre-Mongol Samarkand. It is now preserved in a special museum on the AfrƒÅsiƒÅb mound. The painting dates back to the middle of the 7th century CE. On the four walls of the room of a private house, three or four countries in neighbouring Central Asia are depicted. On the northern wall China (a Chinese festival, with the Empress on a boat, and the Emperor hunting), on the Southern Wall Samarkand (i.e.; the Iranian world: a religious funerary procession in honor of the ancestors during the Nowruz festival), on the eastern wall India (as the land of the astrologers and of the pygmies, but the painting is much destroyed there). The topic on the main wall, the western wall facing the entrance is debated between specialists. K√∂kturk soldiers are escorting ambassadors coming from various countries of the world (Korea, China, Iranian principalities etc.). There are three main hypotheses. The leading expert on Sogdian painting, the excavator of Panjikent, B. Marshak points out that Sogdian painting, gods are always depicted on the top of the main wall. However, as the Turks are guiding the embassies but are not themselves ambassadors, it has been suggested also that the Turkish Qaghan, then lord of inner and central Asia, might be depicted there. A Chinese text is indeed saying that the idea of the \\"Four Lords of the World\\", here China, India, Iran and Turks, is depicted on the walls of palaces near Samarkand precisely during this period, and this would perfectly fit the four walls of this room. The last hypothesis makes use of an inscription mentioning the king of Samarkand to propose the idea that the ambassadors are presenting their gifts to him. In early 2014, France declared that it would finance the restoration of the Afrasiab painting.http://old.archeo-news.ru/2014/02/blog-post_8042.html Image:Afrasiab - details from The Ambassadors' Painting 1 - Northern wall.- Chinese boat.JPGChinese boat Image:Afrasiab - details from The Ambassadors' Painting 2.JPGEnvoys References Royal Nawr≈´z in Samarkand: Acts of the Conference held in Venice on the Pre-Islamic AfrƒÅsyƒÅb Painting, ed.

It was built between the years 1019 and 1040, and is located in the center of the Castle of Cardona. History The church has its origins in the chapel of the Castle of Cardona, which was property of House of the Viscounts of Osona. (The family later took their name from this castle.) This first church was documented in 980, and was protected under the patronage of the viscounts. During the 11th century, a number of stone churches‚Äîseveral as a part of Benedictine monastic complexes‚Äîbegan to be built in the area, though the earliest of these churches still had wooden trusses supporting the roofs. The church of St. Vincent was begun about 1019 and consecrated in 1040, under the patronage of viscount Bermon I. Architecture Interior of the church. The church was built as a showpiece, and is impressive for its scale‚Äîwith a height of more than . Its building material is cut stone, and the stonework is both austere and sophisticated, given the uniform size of the cut blocks and the quality of the masonry. =Interior= In the interior, a barrel vault of stone covers the nave, which is flanked by two side-aisles. Along the nave, three transverse arches, which are evenly spaced, add support. Their arches continue down the piers as pilasters, complete with capitals at the springing of the arch. Rounded arches, supported by piers, open into the side aisles, which are covered with stone groin vaults. Above the nave arcade, small rounded lancet- shaped windows pierce the stone walls. The windows are evenly spaced over the arch openings. A dome resting on squinches is over the crossing in front of the altar. The dome has an oculus opening at the top and small rounded lancet windows in the drum. This is the first known example of a basilica-plan church built with a dome in Western Europe, which represents the synthesis of sacred- building and meeting-hall typologies in the Roman tradition. Apses, transept, and lantern tower, with typical Lombard details At the crossing, the nave meets the transept, which is actually slightly wider than the nave. The transept, however, is short, barely emerging from the sides of the church, but still giving the structure a typical cruciform plan. Beyond it, the aisles of the church terminate in three apses, each sized according to the size of the aisle. =Exterior= From afar, the church's exterior is notable for the prevailing regularity of straight lines, excepting the three semicircular apses. Above the whole rises an octagonal lantern tower, which corresponds to the interior dome. Paintings The portico of the church was once covered with murals. Fragments from the three central vaults (of five) were restored in 1960 and are now displayed at the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya (MNAC) in Barcelona. Though the portico was built with the church in the 11th century, the frescoes themselves date to the 12th century.

The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. History The house was commissioned by newlyweds Seamour and Gerte Shavin in 1949 and the home at 334 North Crest Road on Missionary Ridge in Chattanooga was completed in 1952. Seamour was a building materials salesman. It is the only building designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in Tennessee. Both the exterior and interior of the house use primarily crab orchard stone and treated Louisiana cypress wood. The stonework is reminiscent of Fallingwater: laid horizontally, stones are allowed to protrude (or \\"stick out\\") at points from the line of the wall, resembling stone ledges. The house is sited on top of a hill to take advantage of the view of the Tennessee River and Lookout Mountain. The home features a kitchen, den and bathroom at the top of the hill, and sleeping areas down some stairs on the lower, or eastern, side of the hill. The den/living room is the focal point of the home, featuring a large stone fireplace. Mitered glass in one corner and wood framed corner glass doors that open outward allow the eyes to wander both outside the home and around the interior. There are many classic Wright details, such as a stunning example of a 12'√ó16'√ó16' cantilevered roof over the carport that is similar to the Goetsch‚ÄìWinckler House. There are double clerestory windows with cut-wood light screens. The home has a hidden entrance. The Shavins' house contains built-ins and furniture designed by Wright, resulting in a unified design scheme. Wright, who died in 1959, never visited the site of the Shavins' house during or after its construction. Marvin Bachman, an apprentice of Wright, supervised the construction. In 1951, Bachman was killed in an automobile accident. During the summer of 1952, Bachman's sister, Gloria, and her husband, Dr. Abraham Wilson visited Seamour and Gerte Shavin and helped them move into their new home. On the drive back to New Jersey, the couple decided to commission Wright to design the Bachman‚ÄìWilson House. References * Storrer, William Allin. The Frank Lloyd Wright Companion.

He served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and then studied at BYU. De Hoyos married Genevieve Edouarette Argault. Genevieve was born in Autun, France. She had served a mission in Uruguay. (Arturo de Hoyos should not be confused with his nephew who is also named Arturo de Hoyos (b. 1959) who is an expert on Freemasonry. This second Arturo de Hoyos was raised in Provo, and is the son of Dr. Benjamin Federico de Hoyos and Josefine Emma Zwahlen). De Hoyos received a Ph.D. from Michigan State University. His wife Genevive de Hoyos received her Ph.D. from Indiana University and Arturo was a member of the psychology faculty at that institution. He also served on the faculty of DePauw University for a time. By 1971 De Hoyos was serving as coordinator of graduate studies for Latino and Native American Students at Brigham Young University. In 1971 Arturo de Hoyos was also serving as a branch president of what was then the Spanish-American branch in the Utah Stake. The Utah Stake was in 1974 renamed the Provo Central Stake and the Spanish- American branch was thus the ancestor of what is today the Pioneer 5th Branch in the Provo Utah Central Stake. De Hoyos later served as president of the Mexico Tijuana Mission of the LDS Church. Arturo and Genevieve conducted several psychological studies related to family structure and stability.

On 9 January 1945, the United States I Corps and XIV Corps performed an amphibious landing at Lingayen Gulf, halfway up the west coast of the island. The Japanese responded with a Kamikaze attack that failed. The operation was concluded with no major contact between the ground forces. =MIKE II= This was a plan for an amphibious landing along the east coast of Luzon early in 1945. It was never executed. =MIKE III= This was a plan for an amphibious assault that was originally scheduled for Batangas, which is southwest of Luzon. This plan was modified by moving the goal to Vigan, but ultimately it was never executed. =MIKE IV= This was a second plan for an amphibious assault on the west coast of Luzon in early 1945. It was never executed. =MIKE V= This was the plan for the consolidation of all operations on Luzon. This included the exceptionally brutal battle of Manila, which was the largest land battle in the Pacific. =MIKE VI= This was the amphibious assault on Luzon at Nasugbu Bay on 31 January 1945. Most of the 11th Airborne Division landed just south of Manila, while the 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment jumped in behind the beach. =MIKE VII= This was the landing of the United States XI Corps at San Antonio on the west coast of Luzon on 29 January 1945. Subic Bay Naval Base was captured almost immediately, but strong Japanese resistance was met farther inland at Zig Zag Pass. Tactical air was used to break through the Japanese defenses on 7 February 1945, and the forces moved on towards Manila.

It had only small-plane operations and mechanical services until 1984, when it acquired concessions to operate at the new Stord Airport, S√∏rstokken, Geilo Airport, Dagali, and eventually from Haugesund to Aberdeen. It soon turned out that the company was not profitable and it filed for bankruptcy in 1988. The estate continued on as Coast Air. History Coast Aero Center Piper PA-31 Navajo at Aberdeen Airport in 1986 Coast Air was founded in 1975, the same year as Haugesund Airport, Karm√∏y. It was one of two initially general aviation companies established with the opening of the airport, the other being Nordsj√∏fly. Coast Aero Center first operated a seaplane out of the harbor at the airport.Reitan: 39 Its early fleet consisted of a Cessna 207Hagby: 187 and two Cessna 206.Hagby: 160Hagby: 189 From 1981 the airline operated a Piper PA-31 NavajoHagby: 157 and the following year it bought a Piper PA-34 Seneca.Hagby: 216 The company remained a local mechanical and small-plane operator until 1984, when it started to apply for concessions to perform regional airline services in Norway. The company was owned and run by Asbj√∏rn Utne. Following the 1984 decision of Scandinavian Airlines System to discontinue their route from Haugesund to Aberdeen in the United Kingdom, Coast Aero Center applied for the concession the route, hoping to use a 15-seat Embraer Bandeirante that would be bought used for NOK 7.5 million. The service would have a morning flight from Haugesund, with return in the evening. While SAS had stated that they were not interested in the route, in November 1985 they altered course and executed their preferential right to start the route themselves. However, in April 1986, SAS announced that they would not operate the route anyway. Following this, Coast Aero Center commenced the service on 20 August. It proved unprofitable and was terminated in April 1987. Coast Aero Center applied, along with Norving and Fonnafly, in October 1984 for the concession to fly out of Stord Airport, S√∏rstokken on routes to Oslo, Bergen and Stavanger. Coast Aero Center succeeded in the application, and service started on 12 August 1986 with a ten-passenger Beechcraft Super King 200. The company received a concession in August, allowing them to fly from Stord via Skien Airport, Geiteryggen to Oslo. By March 1987, traffic had increased so much that the company instead put into service a larger, 20-seater de Havilland Canada Twin Otter aircraft. Additional concessions to fly to Haugesund were also granted the same year, as were direct services to Oslo, making the stops in Skien unnecessary. In 1985, the company joined Commuter Service, a joint venture along with the regional airlines M√∏refly, based in √Ölesund, Tr√∏nderfly, based in Trondheim, and Norsk Flytjeneste, based in Sandefjord. The goal was to coordinate the services, and grow through new, small routes. Coast Aero Center was awarded the concession on 20 June 1986 for flying from Stavanger to Geilo Airport, Dagali until 1991. It was flown using a Beechcraft Super King 200. The ridership from Geilo turned out to be too bad, and both Coast Aero Center and Norving terminated their routes. Wider√∏e and Norsk Air said there was not enough ridership for them to be interested. The airline had a revenue of NOK 14 million and had 24 employees in 1986. That year, they chose to connect to the PNR/Smart booking system. The company bid for operating parts of the Norwegian Air Ambulance in 1987, but failed. The company was thrown into financial distress on 7 February 1988, when Den norske Creditbank (DnC) announced that they would not issue more credit. At the time the company had nine daily routes, and 35 employees. All services were immediately suspended. It had a debt of NOK 23 million, of which DnC demanded NOK 13 million paid by 10 February, but the bank later gave the company three weeks to find the capital. On 17 February a proposal for refinancing was made, where the hangars were sold to the local municipalities, who would also make a guarantee for NOK 2 million. DnC would delete part of the debt, and additional capital would be granted from the Kosmos-owned Norsk Air. This was not sufficient, and on 29 April, Coast Aero Center filed for bankruptcy. Also Asbj√∏rn Utne had to file for personal bankruptcy. Fleet The following is a list of aircraft operated by Coast Aero Center.

Description Their geographical area was partly of the provinces of La Rioja, Catamarca, San Juan, from the mountainous zone understood to be between the limit of La Rioja with Catamarca on Colorado river and the surroundings of J√°chal river-Zanj√≥n, in San Juan, including Andes, in the western part, up to the cords of the Velasco, where they were mixed with the Diaguitas. They occupied the fertile valleys of Famatina, Sanagasta, Yacampis, Guandacol and J√°chal. They had as neighbors in the northern part the diaguitas and in the southern part the huarpes. Language They shared with the diaguitas or paziocas the language Kak√°n, or a derivation of it. Vestiges of their language are in completions as bis, wee or small stone, for example: Yacampis, Quilmebis, Guanchina, etc. Technology The Capay√°n knew the technology of the thread, and spun the wool of guanaco and llamas. Also they knew the metallurgy of copper and gold. They constructed channels and irrigation ditches to water their farmlands. Their cultivars were maize, zapallo, potato and qu√≠noa. They widely used ceramics, principally in the production of funeral urns, decorated geometrically with the colors black, red and white, known as Sanagasta style or Angualasto style. Their houses were of mud and adobe and were sometimes built at the foot of a great tree used as a roof. This technology of construction still lasts in the Riojan zone of Vinchina. Decline About 1480, the Inca invaded the region of the diaguitas and capayanes, incorporating their territories into the Inca Empire (Tawantinsuyu). From 1607, the Spanish conquest resulted in their dispersion and later extinction at the end of the 18th century. The capayanes took part in an uprising in 1632 together with the olongastas and other diaguitas. Today a Catamarca's department takes their name (See Capay√°n Department).  Etymology and ethnic filiation  The etymology of the name started to this people seems to be the word rune simi Kapak √±an (Great way), that is to say usually so called \\" Way of the Inca \\". The explanation for this would be in that the territory that they were living age sedates of a knot of communications very importantly in the south of the Tawantinsuyu. The majority of the authors consider the capay√°n due to the cultural common features (for example the use of the language kak√°n) as one of the parts of the pazioca (\\"diaguitas\\"), in the same way that it were the calchaqu√≠es, olongastas, quilmes, though they would have differed for the genetic and cultural influence of the neighbors huarpes and after 1480 for the presence of Mitmakuna deported persons up to the region for the Incas, many of such mitimaes would have trade and manufacture of alcoholic maize drink and churumata.

It runs for between the towns of Waterford and Norway. Its western terminus in Waterford is at State Route 35 and its eastern terminus in Norway is at the intersection of Main Street and Paris Street, where it is overlapped by State Route 117. Route description SR 118 begins at an intersection with SR 35 north of Waterford, near that route's intersection with SR 5. The highway departs to the east, passing through East Waterford and meeting the northern end of SR 37 before entering the town of Norway. SR 118 continues east into town, passing south of Lake Penneseewassee (Norway Lake) before meeting SR 117 at Harrison Road, which approaches from the south. SR 117 and SR 118 are cosigned on Lake Street, then Main Street, heading east into downtown Norway. At the intersection of Main and Paris Streets the SR 118 designation ends. SR 117 turns east onto Paris Street to meet SR 26 near the Paris town line. Main Street continues southeast for to terminate at Fair Street (SR 26). History When it was first commissioned in 1925, SR 118 extended north along SR 5 into Bethel to end at SR 26. When SR 35 was designated in the early 1930s, it was cosigned along SR 5 and SR 118 along the same stretch of road. In 1938, SR 118 was truncated to its current western terminus in Waterford, eliminating the overlaps and cutting the route's overall length by more than half. In the 1980s, SR 118 was extended along SR 117 (its original eastern terminus) through downtown Norway to its current terminus at the junction of Main and Paris Streets, extending the designation to the east. This remains the current routing. Despite what signage suggests, SR 118 does not appear to have ever connected directly with SR 26 as SR 117 does.

He was the commander of the British troops at the Battle of Harlem Heights. He replaced Cornwallis as commander in the South in 1782. Early life Very little is known of his childhood. Leslie was born in England in 1731 to Alexander Leslie, 5th Earl of Leven, and was brother to Lady Mary Hamilton.  Military career  He enlisted in the 3rd Foot Guards of the British Army in 1753. He was promoted to lieutenant-colonel of the 64th Regiment of Foot in 1766. In 1775, before the American War of Independence broke out, he led troops to Salem, Massachusetts looking for contraband weapons. His advance was delayed by a standoff at a bridge, during which the colonists removed the weapons he was looking for. His force was eventually allowed to proceed, but found nothing of consequence, and was received with hostility during the expedition. In 1776, Leslie was promoted to brigadier-general. He fought in the Battle of Long Island, the Landing at Kip's Bay, the Battle of White Plains and the Battle of Harlem Heights, the Battle of Princeton and the Siege of Charleston during the American War of Independence. At Princeton, his nephew, Captain William Leslie was mortally wounded. In 1780, he was sent to the Chesapeake Bay by Sir Henry Clinton in order to \\"make a powerful diversion in [Earl Cornwallis's] favor by striking at the magazines then collecting by the enemy ... for supplying the army they were assembling to oppose him.\\" He became major general in 1782 and was made Colonel of the 63rd (West Suffolk) Regiment of Foot the same year.

The Act seeks to ensure the fair administration of the death penalty and minimize the risk of executing innocent people.McMillion, R. Seeking a Fair Penalty. ABA Journal Sep 2002, Vol. 88 Issue 9, p70 The Innocence Protection Act of 2001, introduced in the Senate as S. 486 and the House of Representatives as H.R. 912, was included as Title IV of the omnibus Justice for All Act of 2004 (H.R. 5107), signed into law on October 30, 2004 by President George W. Bush as public law no. 108-405. The Justice For All Act is the product of a bi-partisan, bicameral compromise led by then-Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Ranking Member Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), then-House Judiciary Chairman F. James Sensenbrenner (R-WI) and Rep. William Delahunt (D-MA). It passed the House by an overwhelming vote of 393 to 14 on October 6, 2004 and the Senate by voice vote three days later. from The Justice Project The text of the Act amended the United States Code to include procedures for post- conviction DNA testing in federal court. Through the Kirk Bloodsworth Post- Conviction DNA Testing Program, the act established a federal grant program to provide money to states to defray the costs of post-conviction DNA testing. The program is named for the first man to be exonerated by use of post- conviction DNA testing. The act additionally contains provisions for increasing the quality of representation for indigent defendants in state capital cases, and for compensating victims of wrongful conviction.  Death penalty  The Innocence Protection Act is the first federal death penalty reform to be enacted. The United States Supreme Court in 1972 suspended use of existing death penalty statutes because of inconsistencies in how they were applied. It ordered the states to pass new legislation to address its concern, and affirmed a case in 1976 under new law, essentially allowing states to again sentence convicted persons to death under their laws. But by 2002, more than 100 people have been released from death rows across the United States after it was found that they were wrongfully convicted because of procedural errors or newly discovered evidence of their innocence.McMillion, R. \\"Seeking a Fair Penalty\\"], ABA Journal, Sep 2002, Vol. 88 Issue 9, p70 The Innocence Protection Act is a first attempt in federal legislation to ensure that innocent people are not put to death. Thirty-six states and the federal government have enacted legislation that permits the courts to impose death as a criminal sentence.Punishment from Bureau of Justice Statistics Of those thirty-six states, Texas executed the most inmates during 2009 with 24 executions. The total number of executions in the United States in 2009 was 52. In 2009, the total number of inmates serving a death sentence in the United States was 3,173. Many executions are delayed as inmates seek appeals to overturn sentences or convictions.  Post-conviction DNA testing  Advances in science and in particular, DNA testing, have yielded more accurate forensic evidence. In some cases, post-conviction testing has helped innocent people establish that they were wrongfully convicted and to gain exonerations. In the process, comparisons to state and federal databases have sometimes led to identification of the perpetrators of such crimes.Post-conviction DNA Testing from DNA Initiative DNA testing is a predominant forensic technique which makes it possible to obtain conclusive results in cases in which previous testing, such as analysis of hair or fingerprints, had been inconclusive or flawed. Post-conviction testing has been requested not only in cases in which DNA testing was never done (because it did not exist as a practice before the late 1980s), and also in cases in which the more refined technology of the early 21st century may result in indisputable evidence. The Innocence Protection Act allows convicted individuals access to DNA testing if they meet certain conditions, such as the possibility that testing could produce new material evidence that would raise a reasonable probability that the individual did not commit the offense.\\"Attorney General Issues Memoranda to Improve Use of DNA Evidence\\". States News Service, Nov 18, 2010, pNA Among other restrictions, it limits new testing to evidence that was not previously tested and generally requires it to be done within 36 months of conviction.

Biography Born in 1890 in Brighton, and working as a chimney sweep, he became involved in grass-roots social activism from the 1920s until his death in the 1970s. He helped organise the unemployed and moved homeless families into squatted buildings after both world wars with his group the Vigilantes. Cowley was a key figure in confronting fascism in 1930s Brighton. He was put in hospital for eight months when he was alone and ran into a group of fascists on Middle Street, who broke his leg. He took his revenge by organising an attack on a meeting of the Fascist League on the Level, a park in Brighton. Cowley became leader of the 'Barrow Boys' in the 1920s. They sold cheap fruit and vegetables out of wheelbarrows on Oxford Street. When the Council attempted to clear the barrows in response to the complaints of local shops, Cowley made a fiery speech to a crowd and when the police attempted to clear it, the protest became known as 'The Battle of Oxford Street.' The barrow boys were subsequently allowed to sell fruit and vegetables on the Level and then, in 1926, the Open Market was built. In addition, Cowley mobilised pensioners, was involved in running social events and social centres and organised practical aid for the poor and disadvantaged of the town. His actions were based in local neighbourhoods and outside political parties. When Harry died in 1971, 500 people filled St. Peters church on London Road for his funeral. Legacy The Cowley Club in Brighton was named after him as a sign of its aim of furthering this tradition of grass-roots organising and class solidarity.

Biography Majar was born in the small village of Wittenig () southwest of Hermagor in the Gail Valley () in southern Carinthia, then part of the Austrian Empire. He grew up in a bilingual, Slovene-German environment and then attended the lyceum in Klagenfurt and in Graz. During his studies in Klagenfurt, he came under the influence of Anton Martin Slom≈°ek, a Roman Catholic priest and author who propagated the use of Slovene in the public sphere. Majar served as a priest in Slovene-speaking parishes in Carinthia, first in Rosegg and then in the settlement of Camporosso near Tarvisio in the Canale Valley (now in Italy). In 1837, he moved back to Klagenfurt, where he first worked in the administration of the Diocese of Gurk, and from 1843 as the chaplain of Klagenfurt Cathedral. During his Klagenfurt years, Majar came into contact with several Slovene ethnographers and authors who worked on the revival of the Slovene language and culture, such as Urban Jarnik, Anton Jane≈æiƒç, Matija Ahacel, and Davorin Trstenjak. Influenced by the Illyrian Movement in Croatia, especially by the Slovene-Croatian poet and activist Stanko Vraz, Majar started developing Pan-Slavic ideals. In the early days of the revolution of 1848, Majar formulated and published a political manifesto demanding the unification of all Slovene Lands into one single politically autonomous administrative entity, called Slovenia. In the following months, Majar's manifesto was elaborated into a program known under the name of United Slovenia. Because of his radical political activity, Majar was transferred from Klagenfurt to the remote parish of Hohenthurn () on the border with Friuli. After more than decade in isolation, in 1867 Majar took part in a journey to Moscow later nicknamed the \\"Slavic Pilgrimage\\", where he presented the Gail Valley at the Ethnographic Exhibition. Through this four-week absence without leave from his parish he completely fell out with the church authorities. Majar then returned to public life. He even tried to introduce the Cyrillic script among Slovenes. He published his ethnographic research in several Russian journals, and in 1870, he was offered tenure as professor in Odessa, in the Russian Empire. However, since he was still a Roman Catholic priest, this plan failed as the Russian authorities did not grant him entry to the country. Nevertheless, Majar continued to propagate radical pan-Slavic ideas through the magazine Slavjan (The Slav), which he had founded in 1873. The magazine had limited success and was closed in 1875. In 1885, Majar moved to Prague, where he lived until his death in 1892.  See also  *Romantic nationalism  Sources  *Andreas Moritsch, Matija Majar-Ziljski.

The Riggins are one of the Colonial families of Maryland who immigrated to the Chesapeake Colonies from Ireland in the mid 17th century and settled along Pocomoke Sound. The three-part wood frame structure rests on a brick pier foundation and is covered by a series of gable roofs. The main part of the house is a three bay structure with a central door. It is attached to a two bay two story structure with central door and a lower roofline, with a two-bay one-story kitchen wing attached. A large brick chimney rises from the east end of the main block and a smaller stack protrudes through the east end of the kitchen wing. About 95% of the original interior woodwork is intact along with some early paint schemes. The finely crafted house is sheathed in cypress and cedar weatherboards and features late Federal style mantels, doors, chair rails and cupboards. The main room of the house has raised panel wainscoting and over-mantel paneling that survives with an early layer of tiger-maple graining. Also on the property is a small frame outbuilding with a gable roof and a family cemetery. Several other \\"telescope\\" style houses remain on the lower Eastern Shore of Maryland, but this house stands out as one of the least altered examples with highly unusual woodwork. Unlike most telescope style houses on the Eastern Shore all three blocks of this one appear to have been built at the same time. Due to construction features, mature cut nails, and some Greek Revival influence in part of the woodwork, it is thought the house was built as late as 1836 with paneling traditions and Federal mantel designs that were common in earlier decades.

He is most noted for his hand engraving of the Lord's Prayer on the tiny head of a gold pin that was displayed at the 1915 Panama‚ÄìPacific Exposition in San Francisco and won a gold medal in engraving. He engraved the pin in Spokane, Washington between 1913 and 1915.  Early life and military service  Gottfrid Emanuel Lundberg was born in V√§stervik, Kalmar County, Sweden on May 4, 1879. He was the second child of Isak and Edla Maria Lundberg.Royal Vice Consulate of Sweden in Seattle, official translation from Swedish on 4/27/55 of vital statistics for Parish of Uppsala, Province of Uppsala, Kingdom Of Sweden. Father: Isak Lundberg, born 9/4/1845 in Tuna, Uppsala, Kingdom of Sweden. Mother: Edla Maria, born 12/8/1853 in Norrtelje, Kingdom of Sweden. Children: Elin Maria, born 2/13/1877 in Westervik; Gottfrid Emanuel, born 5/4/1879 in Westervik; Signhild, born 12/7/1880 in Westervik; Paul Fabian, born 12/20/1882 in Westervik and died 3/14/1887 in Sweden; Carl Edvard Isak, born 6/4/1885 in Oskarshamn, Kingdom of Sweden; Mauritz Fabian, born 2/26/1887 in Uppsala In 1891 when Lundberg was 12 years old his parents and their five children moved to the United States and settled in Spokane, Washington. Lundberg entered the Spokane public schools and excelled in art and music. As a 14-year-old, one of his pen and ink drawings was good enough to be chosen for exhibit at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893.(February 21, 1915). The Spokesman-Review, Spokane, Washington. Music was a large part of the Lundberg family and all the children were musical. Godfrey Lundberg played the cornet locally in Spokane. He was also a cornet player in the military during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War from 1898 to 1899. He was in the First Washington Infantry Band that saw duty in the Philippines.Karl Irving Faust, William L. Luhn, Peter MacQueen, Alexander Leroy Hawkins, (1899). Official History of the Operations of the First Washington Infantry, U.S.V. in the Campaign in the Philippine Islands, Hicks-Judd Company, p. 63. Following his service in the military, Lundberg returned to Spokane. Few details are available about his life during the first decade of the twentieth century. It is, however, known that two times during that period he studied in Europe under Herberich, a German government engraver, and also, in Germany, engraved banknotes for the German Government. By 1911 he was an established engraver in Spokane working for the E. J. Hyde Jewelry Company.(1911). R. L. Polk Spokane City Directory.  The Lord's Prayer on the head of a pin  In 1907, Paul P. Wentz engraved the Lord's Prayer on a brass pin head with a diameter of 2 mm or .079 inch. Wentz's pin is in the Historical Society of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.Wentz, Paul (February 1950). \\"Engraving Pin Heads\\". American Horologist & Jeweler. Lundberg became aware of this pin in 1912 and was convinced that he could do a much more difficult piece of work, namely engrave the Lord's Prayer on a pin head with a much smaller area. He chose a gold pin with a head diameter of .047 inch, about 1/3 the area of the Wentz pin head. He preferred gold, as it is very stable and does not corrode, rust, or become negatively affected by age. Before commencing the work, Lundberg realized that he needed to be in top physical shape to undergo the rigors of such a long, nerve-racking endeavor. According to a Spokesman-Review article in 1915: \\"First, he went into training. The steadiness of nerve that would be required could come only as the result of a conditioning process stricter than that of the highly trained athlete. Tobacco, coffee and like indulgences were out of the question. Fresh air and exercise were necessary. Complete rest for the eyes had to be assured. When he felt himself 'fit' Lundberg started the next stage, which was the manufacture of a special engraving tool, which had to be of a degree of fineness beyond that attempted by the makers of the most minute instruments. It took six months to perfect the graver. The point had to be of steel and the steel had to be specially tempered so that it would hold an unprecedentedly fine point that would cut and that would not be brittle. The process by which he tempered his steel is one of Lundberg's secrets. When he finished he had a point so fine that it was hardly visible to the naked eye, and yet had sufficient tensile strength to last through the whole long-drawn, nerve- straining process.\\" To keep his arm, hand, fingers, microscope, graver (burin), and pin steady enough for this most delicate job of engraving, Lundberg assembled an original piece of equipment that clamped everything rigid except the tips of his fingers. Alvin H. Hankins, a jeweler and lens grinder that knew Lundberg and eventually was his employer in Seattle, was present during most of the engraving. In the early 1930s he wrote to Ripley's Believe It or Not in response to one of their cartoons (Dec. 16, 1929) that wrongly credited a Mr. Charles Baker with engraving the pin. In Julie Mooney's book The World of Ripley's Believe It or Not it is stated: \\"Shortly after the cartoon was published, Ripley's received a letter from Alvin H. Hankins of Seattle, Washington, who claimed that Baker was a fraud. Hankins insisted that Charles Edward Baker didn't make the pin ‚Äì the late Godfrey E. Lundberg did, before Hankins' eyes. Hankins, a lens grinder, had been present during the entire time Lundberg worked on the pin. He told of the grueling conditions Lundberg imposed upon himself to complete the work. Lundberg worked from a barber's chair, strapping his hands to an iron bar to keep them from shaking. He also bound his wrists tightly with leather straps, because the rhythm of his pulse caused the engraving tool to skip. Lundberg could only work on the pin in the evenings, when the rumbling trolley cars that passed by his shop had stopped running for the day. He destroyed more than two hundred pins in his attempt to create one perfect engraving.\\"Mooney, Julie (1999). The World of Ripley's Believe It or Not. Black Dog & Leventhal Publishers. p. 85. Lundberg only worked on the pin for a short period of time in the late hours of the night or early hours of the morning because there was too much vibration from activity in the area at other times. Even with this professional prudence a tragic setback tested Lundberg's will and determination. \\"In spite of all precautions there were several setbacks, one of them particularly disheartening. Two or three pins Lundberg had started, only to have some unexpected minute jar deflect the needle and spoil the letters that had been drawn. But finally eight of the 12 lines had been completed and the end was in sight. Starting early one morning on the ninth line Lundberg saw through the microscope the graving tool swerve and cut through the completed part. He had felt no jar, but he knew there must have been one. He ran out of the shop, could see no vehicle on the deserted streets, but heard the rumble of a heavy truck. It was two blocks away, but its effect had been as destructive as if it had been in the same room. The work had to be begun all over. 'I came near giving up the job', says Lundberg when he tells about this tragic event. But he started out, a few strokes a night, reaching his home early every morning with each individual nerve on edge and with eyes aching from the strain. He has calculated that 1863 strokes of the graver went into the task.\\" After finishing engraving the Lord's Prayer, Lundberg engraved on the point of a fine gold needle the letters IHS for \\"Iesus Hominum Salvator\\" or \\"Jesus, Savior of Men\\". Nervous strain caused Lundberg to lose weight and culminated in a nervous breakdown after he had finished the pin. He declared, \\"I wouldn't undertake a feat like that again for any amount of money.\\" Being exhausted with nervous prostration and in desperate need of total rest, Lundberg entrusted the task of revealing the pin to the public to his brothers Carl and Mauritz. Spokane dignitaries were the first to see the engravings and official letters of appreciation and authentication were received from the Spokane County Commissioners,Letter dated March 9, 1915, Spokane County Office of County Commissioners. Spokane County Prosecuting AttorneyLetter dated March 18, 1915, Spokane County Office of John B. White, Prosecuting Attorney. and the Spokane County Superior Court.Letter dated March 15, 1915 Superior Court of the State of Washington for the County of Spokane, Judge Henry L. Kennan.  Panama‚ÄìPacific Exposition and tour of country  Brothers Carl and Mauritz exhibited Lundberg's pin at the 1915 Panama‚ÄìPacific Exposition in San Francisco. Along with the pin was a gold needle on the point of which Lundberg had engraved the letters US to honor his adopted country. These two engravings were displayed in the Palace of Liberal Arts. The pin was awarded a gold medal in engraving.(June 12, 1984). Journal-American, Bellevue, Washington. Following the exposition in 1915 brother Mauritz Lundberg (with brother Carl occasionally joining) toured the country for two years displaying the engravings in forty-three states and parts of Canada. In 1916, while on tour, the pin was photographed through a microscope by scholars at a Texas university.According to a 1916 newspaper clipping (in the Lundberg collection) from the St. Joseph, Missouri newspaper, the photo was taken by scholars at the University of Texas. According to a clipping from the Baltimore American (also in the Lundberg collection) the pin was photographed by Professor F. L. Whitney at Texas State University.  Moves to Seattle  In 1919 Lundberg, his wife Anna, and son Edris moved to Seattle, Washington where he was employed by his longtime friend Alvin H. Hankins, who owned a jewelry business. Not long after moving to Seattle, Lundberg and his wife Anna purchased a home in the Roanoke Park neighborhood of Seattle. Lundberg died in 1933 at the Naval Hospital in Bremerton, Washington. He was 53 years old. He is buried at Evergreen-Washelli Memorial Park in Seattle.

Description Inspired by the Goethe poem, Dukas's work is part of the larger Romantic genre of programmatic music, which composers like Franz Liszt, Claude Debussy, Jean Sibelius and Richard Strauss increasingly explored as an alternative to earlier symphonic forms. Unlike other tone poems, such as La mer by Debussy or Finlandia by Sibelius, Dukas's work is, like works such as Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks by Strauss, descriptively programmatic, closely following the events described in the Goethe poem. It was customary, in fact, to publish the poem as part of the orchestral score.Abbate, Carolyn. \\"What the Sorcerer Said\\". 19th-Century Music, Vol. 12, No. 3 (Spring, 1989). University of North Carolina Press. pp. 221‚Äì230. . . Instrumentation The instrumentation of the piece consists of two flutes and piccolo, two oboes, two soprano clarinets and bass clarinet, three bassoons and contrabassoon (or contrabass sarrusophone), four horns, two trumpets (in C), two cornets, three trombones, timpani, glockenspiel, bass drum, cymbals, triangle, harp and strings. The formidable glockenspiel part is sometimes handled by a pianist playing a keyboard glockenspiel or celesta, but is usually played by a percussionist on a traditional glockenspiel making it a common orchestral excerpt for percussion auditions. Dukas also made a transcription for two pianos of this orchestral piece. Fantasia Although The Sorcerer's Apprentice was already a popular concert piece, it was brought to a much larger audience through its inclusion, as one of eight animated shorts based on classical music, in the 1940 Walt Disney animated concert film Fantasia. In the film segment, also called \\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\\", Mickey Mouse plays the role of the apprentice. Disney had acquired the music rights in 1937 when he planned to release a separate Mickey Mouse film, which, at the suggestion of Leopold Stokowski, was eventually expanded into Fantasia. Stokowski's version for the soundtrack of Fantasia remains one of the most famous. Although too early for high fidelity, the performance was recorded using multi-tracks and was the first use of stereophonic sound in a film. It is the only part of the film for which Stokowski conducted a studio orchestra, rather than the Philadelphia Orchestra. In terms of the storyline of the film segment, the sorcerer's final anger with his apprentice which appears in Fantasia does not appear in Goethe's source poem, Der Zauberlehrling. The popularity of the musical piece in Fantasia led to it being used again, in its original form, in Fantasia 2000. Other screen versions A decade prior to Fantasia, in 1930 William Cameron Menzies directed and Joseph M. Schenck produced a series of four short films of classical music. One of the four, based on the Dukas music, was titled The Wizard's Apprentice; this short film has been released on DVD and shown on Classic Arts Showcase. In 1931, the Dukas piece was used in Study No. 8 by Oskar Fischinger.Studie nr 8 (excerpt) by Oskar Fischinger vimeo.com, accessed 24 July 2020 The Dukas piece and Goethe poem were also, by way of the film Fantasia, the inspiration of the 2010 Disney movie, The Sorcerer's Apprentice, starring Nicolas Cage and Jay Baruchel.

As he goes through each chapter, he delves into the personality of each dog as companions and not just animals. It begins with Cookie, a dog which rescued him from a fall through the ice while dog sled racing he Cookie was helped by the other sled dogs gary had. This was ironic since the dog was sick before. How would he have saved him? It next considers Snowball, a dog he owned in the Philippines at age 7 (his first) who was killed in a military truck accident. It then discusses Ike, dog that became attached to him during a hunting trip. Ike continues to accompany him for about a year, but then disappears. Paulsen later discovers that Ike's owner had to leave him when he went to the war. When he returned with an injury, Ike returned to him. Dirk, next, is a dog that adopted him during his adolescence, and served as a protector during a difficult period. While working on a farm, he met Rex, a rough collie, whom he considered one of the smartest dogs he ever knew after observing his activities for a day. He later adopted an exceptionally large Great Dane, Caesar (pronounced See-Zer) who was easily excited, but a gentle giant that loved hot dogs.

At one point, he traded one of his best dogs for Quincy, who was later to save his wife from a bear despite being only nine inches tall. The last chapter is about his current dog at the time, Josh. It is clear that Josh is one of the author's favorite dogs, as he has the most to write about him. At the time the book was written, Josh was about 20 years old.

It is the final of three sequels to the better known How Green Was My Valley. Plot summary Huw Morgan has become a successful businessman in Patagonia, establishing farming and civil contracting enterprises. But with political currents shifting in military-governed Argentina, he and his second wife S√ªs decide to return to Wales. Now a rich man, Huw spares no expense to buy, restore and refurbish his wife's ancestral farmhouse in Mid-Wales and make it into a fine manor house. His apparently limitless wealth also allows him to buy property and land to try to restore the fortunes of the small local town. He becomes aware of nationalist feelings amongst the people, but makes no real attempt to understand them. As news of his arrival spreads, he meets his niece Blodwen, his sister Olwen's daughter, a piano student; he sponsors her to study in Germany. He learns that the descendants of his other siblings live in Australia, America, South Africa and New Zealand. Huw is visited by a woman claiming to be the granddaughter of his brother Davy from Melbourne; she brings Kiri, a French girl, with her. She is later revealed to be a fraud, and an IRA terrorist, seeking an isolated country hideout for bomb-making. Kiri is a Breton nationalist and also a bomb-maker. After his wife dies, Huw marries Teleri, also a descendant of the Patagonian Welsh. The ceremony at the farm is disrupted by a would-be assassin, seeking revenge for Kiri's imprisonment, but the attack is foiled by his many friends. After the marriage, Huw and Teleri slip quietly away on honeymoon, planning to visit Patagonia. Before doing so, Huw finally visits his native valley, which he previously avoided, and is astonished to discover the coal tips gone and the area landscaped. Even fish have returned to the once-polluted river. References *\\"Richard Llewellyn\\" at britannica.com *Green, Green My Valley Now. Published 1975 by Michael Joseph Ltd.

The National Greyhound Association also houses and jointly runs the American Greyhound Council. Its main purposes is to provide humane advocacy, welfare policy and support to the adoption network. The association serves to provide policy and maintain standards of care to preserve the greyhound breed and bloodlines. It is headquartered in Abilene, Kansas. Non-racing greyhounds are registered in the U.S. by the American Kennel Club. History The National Greyhound Association, a voluntary non-profit association operated in accordance with the laws of Kansas, is officially recognized by the entire greyhound racing industry‚Äînamely, all greyhound racetracks and individual racing jurisdictions, as well as foreign greyhound registries and governing bodies‚Äîas the sole registry for racing greyhounds on the North American continent. Organized in 1906, it has functioned in this capacity ever since the inception of greyhound track racing in this country of more than 1,500 greyhound owners and breeders whose greyhounds compete at tracks throughout the continent. Records on all breeding, litters whelped, individual registrations, transfers, leases, etc., are maintained at the association‚Äôs headquarters in Abilene, Kansas. The National Greyhound Association‚Äôs rigid identification system plays a key role in maintaining the integrity of the greyhound racing sport. It is also a primary goal of the association to promote the improvement and development of the greyhound breed itself, through maintenance of pedigree and Stud-book records dating back to the latter part of the 19th century. The organization is an associate member of the World Greyhound Racing Federation and a charter and founding member of the World Alliance of Greyhound Registries and the American Greyhound Council, an organization established in 1987 with the American Greyhound Track Operators Association (AGTOA) to fund and oversee greyhound health, welfare and adoption programs. Greyhound adoption More than 95 percent of all registered racing greyhounds are adopted or returned to the farm as pets or breeders, thanks to exceptional cooperation and communication between greyhound racing and hundreds of dedicated adoption organizations coast to coast. The goal is to achieve 100 percent placement of all eligible greyhounds in the near future. Toward that end, the National Greyhound Association, greyhound tracks and industry organizations spend more than $1 million annually on track-based and independent adoption efforts. They include adoption grants, a national adoption hotline (1-800-366-1472), adoption events and conferences, training and support for adoption volunteers, and transport for greyhounds entering adoption programs.American Greyhound Council website, www.agcouncil.com Greyhound welfare The National Greyhound Association has imposed strict regulations on greyhound owners and kennel operators. People who own a racing or breeding greyhound must register with the association. They must agree to accept full responsibility for their greyhound's welfare at all times, or face severe consequences, including possible expulsion from the association. Such expulsion effectively means permanent banishment from participation in greyhound racing throughout the U.S. To ensure proper greyhound care on greyhound farms and in racing kennels at the track, the association has established comprehensive animal welfare guidelines based on veterinary recommendations. The guidelines cover virtually every aspect of greyhound care, including: Nutrition and diet Kennel facilities Housing Exercise Health management Sanitation and disease control Operational supervision Each year, the nation's 250 greyhound breeding farms and kennels are subject to unannounced inspections by the National Greyhound Association through the American Greyhound Council to verify compliance with the industry's animal welfare guidelines. One full-time inspector travels the country continually. He is assisted by 56 part-time inspectors who are frequently called upon to make unannounced visits to farms in their area. The inspectors file written reports summarizing their findings. Minor violations are noted and corrected. Those who fail to correct the problems may be temporarily suspended from racing. More serious violations are addressed in hearings before the National Greyhound Association's governing body. Those guilty of such violations can be banned from the sport for life. More than 99% of all greyhound owners comply with the guidelines. Fewer than half of one percent of the 2,000 greyhound owners in the country are found guilty of serious violations each year. Board of directors The Association is governed by a board consisting of nine members. The nine directors are elected by nine geographical districts. The President of the Association is Julia Ward. The Vice President is Fred Fulichino. Other members of the Board of Directors are: James Blanchard, Leslie Csokasy, Steven Gilster, H. Hal Gill, Steve Sarras, Byron Jay Childs, Gloria Dorsey.

Photo: The Boston Globe archives. The Golden Outfield, also called the Million Dollar Outfield, were the three starting outfielders of the Major League Baseball Boston Red Sox from 1910 through 1915, considered one of the greatest outfields of all time. The three members of the Golden Outfield were left fielder Duffy Lewis, center fielder Tris Speaker and right fielder Harry Hooper. The three helped the Red Sox win two World Series titles, in 1912 and 1915. Two members of the Golden Outfield, Speaker and Hooper, are enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame. All three were effective hitters, but were especially known for their fielding skill. Baseball writer Grantland Rice said that they were \\"the greatest defensive outfield I ever saw...They were smart and fast. They covered every square inch of the park ‚Äì and they were like three fine infielders on ground balls. They could move into another country, if the ball happened to fall there.\\" Speaker, Hooper, and Lewis all had powerful throwing arms, as well. Both Ty Cobb and Babe Ruth said that it was the best outfield that they had ever seen.Gay, Timothy M. (2007). Tris Speaker: The Rough-and-Tumble Life of a Baseball Legend. Globe Pequot. The Golden Outfield was broken up when Speaker was traded to the Cleveland Indians prior to the 1916 season after a salary dispute with Red Sox owner Joseph Lannin. Members Speaker was the first to join the Red Sox. He joined the team in 1907, and became a regular in 1910. He starred for the Red Sox in center field until being traded to the Cleveland Indians before the 1916 season. Speaker was the American League Most Valuable Player in 1912, and finished in the top 12 in the MVP voting each season from 1911 through 1914. Speaker was known for playing very shallow in center field, allowing him to participate in 64 double plays in 1053 games as a Red Sox outfielder, and set a career record for outfield assists. He was able to play so shallow because he was outstanding at catching balls hit over his head. He batted .337 for the Red Sox, with 1327 hits in 3935 at bats. He also hit 241 of his all-time record 792 doubles for the Red Sox. During his time with the Red Sox, he led the American League in doubles, home runs, extra base hits and on-base percentage in 1912, and in hits, doubles, extra base hits and total bases in 1914. He was one of the first players elected into the Hall of Fame in 1937. Hooper joined the Red Sox in 1909, after attending Saint Mary's College of California, and became a regular in 1910. Hooper's fielding prowess also forced Major League Baseball to change the rules regarding runners advancing when a fly ball was caught. Hooper used to juggle fly balls as he ran back to the infield preventing runners from trying to advance until the ball was finally caught. This forced a rule change in which runners could advance as soon as the ball was touched by the fielder, rather than having to wait until the ball was caught. He received MVP votes in both 1913 and 1914. He led the American League in at bats and sacrifice hits in 1910. With the Red Sox from 1909 through 1920, he batted .272 with 1707 hits in 6270 at bats. He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1971. Lewis also attended Saint Mary's College of California, and joined the Red Sox in 1910, completing the Golden Outfield. Until the 1930s, the Red Sox' home park, Fenway Park had a slope in front of the left field wall. Lewis was so effective at playing balls off the cliff that it was nicknamed Duffy's Cliff. Lewis played with the Red Sox until 1917, and led the American League in sacrifice hits in 1912. He received MVP votes in 1914, finishing tied with Hooper at 20th overall in the voting. During his time with the Red Sox, he batted .286, with 1248 hits in 4325 at bats. Lewis has not been elected to the Hall of Fame, but did receive votes in several elections from 1937 through 1955. His best showing was in 1955 when he received 34 votes and 13.5% of the total, far below the 75% needed for election. Speaker, Hooper, and Lewis made their first start as a trio on April 27, 1910, in an 11‚Äì1 road win over the Washington Senators. World Series play In the 1912 World Series, Speaker batted .300, Hooper batted .290 and Lewis batted .188. All had three extra base hits in the series. In addition, Hooper made a famous bare-handed catch to rob the New York Giants' Larry Doyle of a home run to preserve a Red Sox victory in game 7 of the series. In the 1915 World Series, all members of the trio had solid hitting performances, with Lewis batting .444, Hooper .350 and Speaker .294. In addition Speaker made a spectacular catch to rob Dode Paskert of an extra base hit that would have won game 2 for the Philadelphia Phillies. After the series, which the Red Sox won in five games, sportswriter George R. Holmes proclaimed that the Golden Outfield was the greatest outfield of all time.Holmes, George R. \\"Boston Outfield Best of All Time\\". The Pittsburgh Press. October 14, 1915. p. 21. In October 1965, Baseball Digest wrote that the 1915 Boston performance was the greatest by an outfield in World Series history.Waxman, Wayne. \\"The Greatest Outfield Performance\\". Baseball Digest. October 1965. It would be the last time that all three men played on the same team, as Speaker was traded to Cleveland before the 1916 season. Rivalry During the 1910s, the Red Sox were beset by a religious rivalry, and members of the Golden Outfield were not immune to this. Lewis and catcher Bill Carrigan were leaders of the Catholic faction, while Speaker, pitcher Smokey Joe Wood and third baseman Larry Gardner were leaders of the Protestant faction. Speaker and Lewis, in particular, did not get along. One day in 1913, Speaker annoyed Lewis by repeatedly knocking Lewis' cap off. Lewis said, \\"Do that again and I'll kill you.\\" After Speaker continued to do it, Lewis hit him in the shins with a baseball bat, and Speaker had to be helped off the field.Fleitz, David L.

It was established to replace a failing monastery of Premonstratensian canonesses regular. History=Premonstratensian priory= About 1217 the canonesses of Ahnaberg Priory near Kassel were permitted to establish a daughter-house on the Eppenberg, on the shoulder of the Heiligenberg. This foundation was confirmed on 3 March 1219 by Siegfried II, Archbishop of Mainz, who took it under his protection. The total number of canonesses in Ahnaberg was set at 40, and the remainder moved to a newly established daughter-house at Eppenberg. The relationship of the new priory to its motherhouse was clearly not without friction. In 1223 the provost and community of Ahnaberg re-stated their rights in Eppenberg. On 17 February 1224 Archbishop Siegfried once more confirmed the rights of Ahnaberg Priory. But in 1250, for reasons now unknown, the prioress of Eppenberg openly rejected the rights of Ahnaberg, and Eppenberg became an independent house, now, like Ahnaberg, under the supervision and protection of Spieskappel Abbey. The newly independent priory rapidly flourished, mostly because of gifts and acquisitions of land in the nearby villages of Altenbrunslar, B√∂ddiger, Besse and Gensungen. In 1269 Eppenberg was able to found a daughter house at Homberg an der Efze. Growing prosperity however led to a decline in morals and discipline, and eventually to prodigality, mismanagement, and economic collapse. =Charterhouse= Landgrave Ludwig I of Hesse, greatly offended at the conditions in the priory, the neglected estates and buildings, and the loss of discipline, rigor and order, obtained a Papal bull in 1438 to dissolve the Premonstratensian priory and replaced it by a charterhouse, which was settled by hermits from Erfurt in 1440. The buildings were rebuilt as a hermitage, re-dedicated to Saint John the Baptist, and generously and extensively rebuilt. In 1471 Landgrave Ludwig II of Hesse gave the Charterhouse the estate of Wimmenhof (now Dom√§ne Mittelhof) and the nearby, half-derelict Heiligenburg Castle, on the condition that the hermits should pray weekly in the castle chapel for its salvation. =Secularization= In 1527, in the wake of the Synod of Homberg of 1526, which introduced the Protestant Reformation in Hesse, the monastery was dissolved and taken over by Landgrave Philip I of Hesse for use as a hunting lodge and farm. In about 1610 Landgrave Maurice of Hesse-Kassel had the hunting lodge remodeled in Italian Renaissance style. The buildings and lands were maintained by the nearby Mittelhof. In the Thirty Years' War the building complex was mostly destroyed, and afterwards it became a subsidiary building and sheep-farm to the state-owned Dom√§ne Mittelhof. In the Seven Years' War (1756‚Äì63) French troops were holed up there for seven weeks after losing the Battle of Grebenstein; two dugouts on the slopes of the Heiligenberg remain as a reminder of their camp. Present day In 1957 the principal building was struck by lightning and burnt down, leaving only the bare walls. The buildings and the monastery church fell increasingly into dereliction, until in 1984 the Felsberg Beekeepers' Association took on the task of restoring and caring for the site. In the former gatehouse they established a highly regarded museum of bee-keeping. Of the monastery itself the only remains are those of the church. The area around the charterhouse site and the ruins themselves were declared a nature reserve in December 1988.

The effect is similar to that of applying a capo a standard 12-string guitar at its twelfth fret.

The season premiered in the United States on the Sci-Fi Channel on July 15, 2005, with the UK, Ireland, and Canadian premiere in January 2006. In fall 2005, airing of the second season halted, as it was part of Sci-Fi Channel's standard airing schedule normally used for its Stargate series, which was to split a 20-episode season into two parts (a \\"winter season\\" and a \\"summer season\\") to avoid heavy competition with major networks that follow a spring/fall schedule. Universal Home Video took this break as an opportunity to package the episodes aired thus far into a DVD set, calling it \\"Season 2.0\\". The final episode of the first half, \\"Pegasus\\", was originally 15 minutes too long for broadcast, but according to creator Ronald Moore, the production team decided to cut the episode to time rather than pad it out to fill 90 minutes, as this was deemed impractical. The longer version of \\"Pegasus\\" appears on the Battlestar Galactica Season 2.5 DVD set, which was released in the U.S. on September 19, 2006. Sky did not contribute financially to the second season, though UK broadcasts credit the company at the end of every episode. The second half of season two (\\"Season 2.5\\") began airing on January 6, 2006, after a three-month hiatus, during which the Sci-Fi Channel mounted a huge publicity effort. Battlestar Galactica picked up considerable critical acclaim from the mainstream press, including being named the #1 show of 2005 by Time magazine, and being listed on numerous top ten lists of both 2005 and 2006 by publications such as the Chicago Tribune, Entertainment Weekly, Newsday and TV Guide. The American Film Institute also named it one of the ten best television shows of 2005. There was some criticism that a few episodes following \\"Resurrection Ship, Part 2\\" were not up to par with previous episodes, such as the episode \\"Black Market\\", for which even Ron Moore expressed some disdain. Moore stated in his blog that he felt this was a result of the larger workload the series faced with twenty episodes, instead of thirteen in season one. However, episode 15, \\"Scar\\", was thought to bring the series back up to its high level of quality, and subsequent episodes \\"The Captain's Hand\\", \\"Downloaded\\", and the two part finale \\"Lay Down Your Burdens\\", were hailed by fans and critics alike. Moore expressed that the longer break between seasons two and three (seven months instead of two) would help to ensure that all episodes were up to the high level of quality that the production team strove to maintain.

Season overview  The first season of Burn Notice introduces Michael Westen. He is burned while on a covert operation in Nigeria. After fleeing, he soon finds himself in Miami, where he is reunited with his ex-girlfriend, Fiona Glenanne, and another old friend, Sam Axe. With his entire life in ruins and his former employers refusing to answer the phone to him, Michael begins the hunt for the man who signed the order to burn him, with his biggest source of trouble and information being the government agents assigned to monitor him. In addition to hunting for the people who burned him, Michael works as a freelance spy, helping people with cases involving kidnapping, arms dealers, con artists, and drug traffickers. For several episodes, Michael is tailed by Harris (Marc Macaulay) and Lane (Brandon Morris), two FBI agents who are sent to keep tabs on Michael and to whom Sam reports due to them threatening his pension, mildly straining his relationship with Michael. Eventually after Sam \\"finds\\" a document in Michael's possession that he should not have, Harris and Lane are pulled from the case and replaced by a CSS agent, Jason Bly (Alex Carter). Bly makes Michael's life miserable, even going so far as having his loft raided and his car towed. Michael returns the favour by making Bly's life miserable, such as breaking into his hotel room and concealing a magnet near his government laptop to destroy the memory core. Eventually, Michael reveals he has created falsified documents detailing that Bly and he are criminal partners (partially helped by Bly repeatedly entering his loft without legal permission or reason), and blackmails Bly into providing Michael with a copy of the dossier on Michael's Burn Notice: the document that details why he lost his job. Finally, Michael discovers the identity of the man who burned him: Phillip Cowan (Richard Schiff). Unable to leave Miami without alerting every agency, Michael gets Cowan's attention by having in put on the FBI WatchList after arranging for the Head of the Libyan Secret Police to send Cowan a fruit basket. He gets in touch with Cowan, and they eventually meet. Cowan laughs that Michael thinks that [Cowan] is solely responsible for destroying his career because of a name on a document, and cryptically reveals that he works for a much more powerful entity. However, Cowan is shot by a sniper after saying \\"This is much, much bigger than us, my friend.\\" Michael is later contacted by a mysterious woman (later identified as Carla), who tells him that they should meet. Michael suspects that she is part of the organization that burned him, and he makes a long journey to meet her. The season ends with Michael driving onto a truck to be taken to his new \\"handler\\".

He grew up on his father's potato, grain, and livestock farm in Flathead County, Montana. From 1913 to 1917, he attended Montana State College in Bozeman (now Montana State University - Bozeman). He then served briefly as an Agricultural Extension Agent in Blaine County, Montana before entering the United States Army in the fall of 1917. He was stationed at Fort Sill, Oklahoma where he served as a First Lieutenant in the Field Artillery. Following World War I, Jackman attended Oregon Agricultural College (now Oregon State University). He majored in Agronomy, receiving a Bachelor of Science in 1921.\\"Historical Note\\" , Edwin Russell Jackman Papers, Archives and Records Management Program, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon, August 11, 2008.\\"Jackman, E.R., Papers\\" , University Archives, Oregon State University Library, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon, June 18, 1999.  Agriculture expert  After he graduated from Oregon Agricultural College, Jackman was appointed the state's Agricultural Extension Agent for Wasco County, Oregon. As an extension agent, he worked for Oregon State University as part of the United States Department of Agriculture's Federal Cooperative Extension Service (now known as the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service. In this capacity, he was responsible for advising local farmers and ranchers on modern agricultural techniques, land use, and recommended conservation practices. In 1926, he resigned to enter commercial business, but returned to the Extension Service in 1929. From 1929 until 1953, he served as a farm crop specialist; then from 1953 until his retirement in 1959, he was engaged as a range crop management specialist. Jackman helped organize the Oregon Seed Growers' League, serving as the organization's secretary for many years. He also played a leading role in creating the Oregon Wheat League, which was subsequently copied across the United States. As president of the Pacific Northwest chapter of the American Society of Range Management, Jackman started a Youth Range Camp program in 1950. The camp is now a well established annual event. He was a member of the national extension honorary fraternity, Epsilon Sigma Phi. In 1949, Jackman was awarded the fraternity's Western States Certificate of Recognition. In 1956, he received the United States Department of Agriculture's Superior Service Award for his success in promoting grassland agriculture and for helping to develop Oregon's multimillion-dollar seed industry. In 1957, the Oregon Farm Bureau Federation recognized Jackman with their Distinguished Service to Oregon Agriculture award.\\"E.R. Jackman Papers\\" , University Archives, Oregon State University Library, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon, 18 June 1999.  Books  After he retired from the Extension Service, Jackman wrote four books. In 1962, he wrote Gold and Cattle Country along with Herman Oliver. In 1964, he joined Reub Long to write The Oregon Desert, which remains an extremely popular work over forty years after it original publication. The book highlights Eastern Oregon history, high desert geology, rural culture, and native folklore. It is also filled with Reub Long's humorous stories. As of 2003, the book was in its fourteenth printing. In 1967, Jackman co-authored two other books. First, he worked with Charles Simpson to produce Blazing Forest Trails, then Jackman joined John Scharff to write Steens Mountain in Oregon's High Desert Country.

The convicted traitor was fastened to a hurdle, or wooden panel, and drawn by horse to the place of execution, where he was then hanged (almost to the point of death), emasculated, disembowelled, beheaded, and quartered (chopped into four pieces). His remains would then often be displayed in prominent places across the country, such as London Bridge, to serve as a warning of the fate of traitors. For reasons of public decency, women convicted of high treason were instead burned at the stake. The severity of the sentence was measured against the seriousness of the crime. As an attack on the English monarchy's authority, high treason was considered a deplorable act demanding the most extreme form of punishment. Although some convicts had their sentences modified and suffered a less ignominious end, over a period of several hundred years many men found guilty of high treason were subjected to the law's ultimate sanction. They included many English Catholic priests executed during the Elizabethan era, and several of the regicides involved in the 1649 execution of Charles I. Although the Act of Parliament defining high treason remains on the United Kingdom's statute books, during a long period of 19th-century legal reform the sentence of hanging, drawing, and quartering was changed to drawing, hanging until dead, and posthumous beheading and quartering, before being abolished in England in 1870. The death penalty for treason was abolished in 1998. Treason in England As illustrated in Matthew Paris's Chronica Majora, William de Marisco is drawn to his execution behind a horse. During the High Middle Ages, those in England guilty of treason were punished in a variety of ways, including drawing and hanging. In the 13th century other more brutal penalties were introduced, such as disembowelling, burning, beheading, and quartering. The 13th-century English chronicler Matthew Paris described how in 1238 \\"a certain man at arms, a man of some education (armiger literatus)\\" attempted to kill King Henry III. His account records in gruesome detail how the would-be assassin was executed: \\"dragged asunder, then beheaded, and his body divided into three parts; each part was then dragged through one of the principal cities of England, and was afterwards hung on a gibbet used for robbers.\\" He was apparently sent by William de Marisco, an outlaw who some years earlier had killed a man under royal protection before fleeing to Lundy Island. De Marisco was captured in 1242 and on Henry's order dragged from Westminster to the Tower of London to be executed. There he was hanged from a gibbet until dead. His corpse was disembowelled, his entrails burned, his body quartered, and the parts distributed to cities across the country. The punishment is more frequently recorded during Edward I's reign. The Welsh Prince Dafydd ap Gruffydd became the first nobleman in England to be hanged, drawn, and quartered after he turned against the king and proclaimed himself Prince of Wales and Lord of Snowdon. Dafydd's rebellion infuriated Edward I so much that he demanded a novel punishment. Therefore, following his capture and trial in 1283, for his betrayal he was drawn by horse to his place of execution. For killing English nobles, he was hanged alive. For killing those nobles at Easter, he was eviscerated and his entrails burned. For conspiring to kill the king in various parts of the realm, his body was quartered and the parts sent across the country; his head was placed on top of the Tower of London. A similar fate was suffered by the Scottish leader Sir William Wallace. Captured and tried in 1305, he was forced to wear a crown of laurel leaves and was drawn to Smithfield, where he was hanged and beheaded. His entrails were then burned and his corpse quartered. His head was set on London Bridge and the quarters sent to Newcastle, Berwick, Stirling, and Perth. =Treason Act 1351= Edward III, under whose rule the Treason Act 1351 was enacted. It defined in law what constituted high treason. These and other executions, such as those of Andrew Harclay, 1st Earl of Carlisle, and Hugh Despenser the Younger, which each occurred during Edward II's reign, happened when acts of treason in England, and their punishments, were not clearly defined in common law. Treason was based on an allegiance to the sovereign from all subjects aged 14 or over, and it remained for the king and his judges to determine whether that allegiance had been broken. Edward III's justices had offered somewhat overzealous interpretations of what activities constituted treason, \\"calling felonies treasons and afforcing indictments by talk of accroachment of the royal power\\", prompting parliamentary demands to clarify the law. Edward therefore introduced the Treason Act 1351. It was enacted at a time in English history when a monarch's right to rule was indisputable and was therefore written principally to protect the throne and sovereign. The new law offered a narrower definition of treason than had existed before and split the old feudal offence into two classes. Petty treason referred to the killing of a master (or lord) by his servant, a husband by his wife, or a prelate by his clergyman. Men guilty of petty treason were drawn and hanged, whereas women were burned. High treason was the most egregious offence an individual could commit. Attempts to undermine the king's authority were viewed with as much seriousness as if the accused had attacked him personally, which itself would be an assault on his status as sovereign and a direct threat to his right to govern. As this might undermine the state, retribution was considered an absolute necessity and the crime deserving of the ultimate punishment. The practical difference between the two offences therefore was in the consequence of being convicted; rather than being drawn and hanged, men were to be hanged, drawn, and quartered, while for reasons of public decency (their anatomy being considered inappropriate for the sentence), women were instead drawn and burned. The Act declared that a person had committed high treason if they were: *compassing or imagining the death of the king, his wife or his eldest son and heir; *violating the king's wife, his eldest daughter if she were unmarried, or the wife of his eldest son and heir; *levying war against the king in his realm; *adhering to the king's enemies in his realm, giving them aid and comfort in his realm or elsewhere; *counterfeiting the Great Seal or the Privy Seal, or the king's coinage; *knowingly importing counterfeit money; *killing the Chancellor, Treasurer or one of the king's Justices while performing their offices. The Act did not limit the king's authority in defining the scope of treason. It contained a proviso giving English judges discretion to extend that scope whenever required, a process more commonly known as constructive treason. It also applied to subjects overseas in British colonies in the Americas, but the only documented incident of an individual there being hanged, drawn, and quartered was that of Joshua Tefft, an English colonist accused of having fought on the side of the Narragansett during the Great Swamp Fight. He was executed in January 1676. Later sentences resulted either in a pardon or a hanging. =Treason Act 1695= Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham was executed on 17 May 1521 for the crime of treason. The wording of his sentence has survived and indicates the precision with which the method of execution was described; he was to be \\"laid on a hurdle and so drawn to the place of execution, and there to be hanged, cut down alive, your members to be cut off and cast in the fire, your bowels burnt before you, your head smitten off, and your body quartered and divided at the King's will, and God have mercy on your soul.\\"Smith, Lacey, B. (1954) English Treason Trials and Confessions in the Sixteenth Century, Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. 15, No. 4 (Oct., 1954), pp. 471‚Äì498 Published by: University of Pennsylvania Press, p. 484. The original 1351 Act required only one witness to convict a person of treason, although in 1547 this was increased to two. Suspects were first questioned in private by the Privy Council before they were publicly tried. They were allowed no witnesses or defence counsel, and were generally presumed guilty from the outset. This meant that for centuries anyone accused of treason was severely legally disadvantaged, a situation which lasted until the late 17th century, when several years of politically motivated treason charges made against Whig politicians prompted the introduction of the Treason Act 1695. This allowed a defendant counsel, witnesses, a copy of the indictment, and a jury, and when not charged with an attempt on the monarch's life, to be prosecuted within three years of the alleged offence. Execution of the sentence Once sentenced, malefactors were usually held in prison for a few days before being taken to the place of execution. During the Early Middle Ages this journey may have been made tied directly to the back of a horse, but it subsequently became customary for the victim to be fastened instead to a wicker hurdle, or wooden panel, itself tied to the horse. Historian Frederic William Maitland thought that this was probably to \\"[secure] for the hangman a yet living body\\". The use of the word drawn, as in \\"to draw\\", has caused a degree of confusion. One of the Oxford English Dictionary's definitions of draw is \\"to draw out the viscera or intestines of; to disembowel (a fowl, etc. before cooking, a traitor or other criminal after hanging)\\", but this is followed by \\"in many cases of executions it is uncertain whether this, or [to drag (a criminal) at a horse's tail, or on a hurdle or the like, to the place of execution; formerly a legal punishment of high treason], is meant. The presumption is that where drawn is mentioned after hanged, the sense is as here.\\" Historian Ram Sharan Sharma arrived at the same conclusion: \\"Where, as in the popular hung, drawn and quartered [use] (meaning facetiously, of a person, completely disposed of), drawn follows hanged or hung, it is to be referred to as the disembowelling of the traitor.\\" Sharma is not the only historian to support this viewpoint as the phrase, \\"hanged until dead before being drawn and quartered\\", occurs in a number of relevant secondary publications.Hirsch, Richard S.

In an essay published on his website, he writes that the separate mention of evisceration is a relatively modern device, and that while it certainly took place on many occasions, the presumption that drawing means to disembowel is spurious. Instead, drawing (as a method of transportation) may be mentioned after hanging because it was a supplementary part of the execution. The spiked heads of executed criminals once adorned the gatehouse of the medieval London Bridge. is shown awaiting his execution. In the bottom pane, one regicide is hanged and another quartered, while the latter's head is shown to the crowd. Some reports indicate that during Queen Mary I's reign bystanders were vocal in their support: while in transit, convicts sometimes suffered directly at the hands of the crowd. William Wallace was whipped, attacked and had rotten food and waste thrown at him, and the priest Thomas Pilchard was reportedly barely alive by the time he reached the gallows in 1587. Others found themselves admonished by \\"zealous and godly men\\"; it became customary for a preacher to follow the condemned, asking them to repent. According to Samuel Clarke, the Puritan clergyman William Perkins (1558‚Äì1602) once managed to convince a young man at the gallows that he had been forgiven, enabling the youth to go to his death \\"with tears of joy in his eyes ... as if he actually saw himself delivered from the hell which he feared before, and heaven opened for receiving his soul.\\" After the king's commission had been read aloud, the crowd was normally asked to move back from the scaffold before being addressed by the convict. While these speeches were mostly an admission of guilt (although few admitted treason), still they were carefully monitored by the sheriff and chaplain, who were occasionally forced to act; in 1588, Catholic priest William Dean's address to the crowd was considered so inappropriate that he was gagged almost to the point of suffocation. Questions on matters of allegiance and politics were sometimes put to the prisoner, as happened to Edmund Gennings in 1591. He was asked by priest hunter Richard Topcliffe to \\"confess his treason\\", but when Gennings responded \\"if to say Mass be treason, I confess to have done it and glory in it\\", Topcliffe ordered him to be quiet and instructed the hangman to push him off the ladder. Sometimes the witness responsible for the condemned man's execution was also present. A government spy, John Munday, was in 1582 present for the execution of Thomas Ford. Munday supported the sheriff, who had reminded the priest of his confession when he protested his innocence. The sentiments expressed in such speeches may be related to the conditions encountered during imprisonment. Many Jesuit priests suffered badly at the hands of their captors but were frequently the most defiant; conversely, those of a higher station were often the most apologetic. Such contrition may have arisen from the sheer terror felt by those who thought they might be disembowelled rather than simply beheaded as they would normally expect, and any apparent acceptance of their fate may have stemmed from the belief that a serious, but not treasonable act, had been committed. Good behaviour at the gallows may also have been due to a convict's desire for his heirs not to be disinherited. The condemned were occasionally forced to watch as other traitors, sometimes their confederates, were executed before them. The priest James Bell was in 1584 made to watch as his companion, John Finch, was \\"a-quarter-inge.\\" Edward James and Francis Edwardes were made to witness Ralph Crockett's execution in 1588, in an effort to elicit their co-operation and acceptance of Elizabeth I's religious supremacy before they were themselves executed. Normally stripped to the shirt with their arms bound in front of them, prisoners were then hanged for a short period, either from a ladder or cart. On the sheriff's orders the cart would be taken away (or if a ladder, turned), leaving the man suspended in mid-air. The aim was usually to cause strangulation and near-death, although some victims were killed prematurely, the priest John Payne's death in 1582 being hastened by a group of men pulling on his legs. Conversely, some, such as the deeply unpopular William Hacket (d. 1591), were cut down instantly and taken to be disembowelled and normally emasculated‚Äîthe latter, according to Sir Edward Coke, to \\"show his issue was disinherited with corruption of blood.\\" A victim still conscious at that point might have seen his entrails burned, before his heart was removed and the body decapitated and quartered (chopped into four pieces). The regicide Major-General Thomas Harrison, after being hanged for several minutes and then cut open in October 1660, was reported to have leaned across and hit his executioner‚Äîresulting in the swift removal of his head. His entrails were thrown onto a nearby fire. John Houghton was reported to have prayed while being disembowelled in 1535, and in his final moments to have cried \\"Good Jesu, what will you do with my heart?\\" Executioners were often inexperienced and proceedings did not always run smoothly. In 1584 Richard White's executioner removed his bowels piece by piece, through a small hole in his belly, \\"the which device taking no good success, he mangled his breast with a butcher's axe to the very chine most pitifully.\\" At his execution in January 1606 for his involvement in the Gunpowder Plot, Guy Fawkes managed to break his neck by jumping from the gallows. Sir Thomas Armstrong in 1684 No records exist to demonstrate exactly how the corpse was quartered, although an engraving of the quartering of Sir Thomas Armstrong in 1684 shows the executioner making vertical cuts through the spine and removing the legs at the hip. The distribution of Dafydd ap Gruffydd's remains was described by Herbert Maxwell: \\"the right arm with a ring on the finger in York; the left arm in Bristol; the right leg and hip at Northampton; the left [leg] at Hereford. But the villain's head was bound with iron, lest it should fall to pieces from putrefaction, and set conspicuously upon a long spear-shaft for the mockery of London.\\" After the execution in 1660 of several of the regicides involved in the death of King Charles I eleven years earlier, the diarist John Evelyn remarked: \\"I saw not their execution, but met their quarters, mangled, and cut, and reeking, as they were brought from the gallows in baskets on the hurdle.\\" Such remains were typically parboiled and displayed as a gruesome reminder of the penalty for high treason, usually wherever the traitor had conspired or found support. Salt and cumin seed would be added during the boiling process: the salt to prevent putrefaction, and the cumin seed to prevent birds pecking at the flesh.Kenny, C. Outlines of Criminal Law (Cambridge University Press, 1936), 15th edition, p. 318 The head was often displayed on London Bridge, for centuries the route by which many travellers from the south entered the city. Several eminent commentators remarked on the displays. In 1566 Joseph Justus Scaliger wrote that \\"in London there were many heads on the bridge ... I have seen there, as if they were masts of ships, and at the top of them, quarters of men's corpses.\\" In 1602 the Duke of Pommerania-Stettin emphasised the ominous nature of their presence when he wrote \\"near the end of the bridge, on the suburb side, were stuck up the heads of thirty gentlemen of high standing who had been beheaded on account of treason and secret practices against the Queen.\\" The practice of using London Bridge in this manner ended following the hanging, drawing, and quartering in 1678 of William Staley, a victim of the fictitious Popish Plot. His quarters were given to his relatives, who promptly arranged a \\"grand\\" funeral; this incensed the coroner so much that he ordered the body to be dug up and set upon the city gates. Staley's was the last head to be placed on London Bridge. Later history Another victim of the Popish Plot, Oliver Plunkett the Archbishop of Armagh, was hanged, drawn, and quartered at Tyburn in July 1681. His executioner was bribed so that Plunkett's body parts were saved from the fire; the head is now displayed at St Peter's Church in Drogheda. Francis Towneley and several other captured Jacobite officers involved in the Jacobite Rising of 1745 were executed, but by then the executioner possessed some discretion as to how much they should suffer and thus they were killed before their bodies were eviscerated. The French spy Fran√ßois Henri de la Motte was hanged in 1781 for almost an hour before his heart was cut out and burned, and the following year David Tyrie was hanged, decapitated, and then quartered at Portsmouth. Pieces of his corpse were fought over by members of the 20,000-strong crowd there, some making trophies of his limbs and fingers. In 1803 Edward Despard and six co- conspirators in the Despard Plot were sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered. Before they were hanged and beheaded at Horsemonger Lane Gaol, they were first placed on sledges attached to horses, and ritually pulled in circuits around the gaol yards. Their execution was attended by an audience of about 20,000. A contemporary report describes the scene after Despard had made his speech: The severed head of Jeremiah Brandreth, one of the last men in England sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered At the burnings of Isabella Condon in 1779 and Phoebe Harris in 1786, the sheriffs present inflated their expenses; in the opinion of Simon Devereaux they were probably dismayed at being forced to attend such spectacles. Harris's fate prompted William Wilberforce to sponsor a bill which if passed would have abolished the practice, but as one of its proposals would have allowed the anatomical dissection of criminals other than murderers, the House of Lords rejected it. The burning in 1789 of Catherine Murphy, a counterfeiter, was impugned in Parliament by Sir Benjamin Hammett. He called it one of \\"the savage remains of Norman policy\\". Amidst a growing tide of public disgust at the burning of women, Parliament passed the Treason Act 1790, which for women guilty of treason substituted hanging for burning. It was followed by the Treason Act 1814, introduced by Samuel Romilly, a legal reformer. Influenced by his friend, Jeremy Bentham, Romilly had long argued that punitive laws should serve to reform criminal behaviour and that far from acting as a deterrent, the severity of England's laws was responsible for an increase in crime. When appointed the MP for Queensborough in 1806 he resolved to improve what he described as \\"Our sanguinary and barbarous penal code, written in blood\\". He managed to repeal the death penalty for certain thefts and vagrancy, and in 1814 proposed to change the sentence for men guilty of treason to being hanged until dead and the body left at the king's disposal. However, when it was pointed out that this would be a less severe punishment than that given for murder, he agreed that the corpse should also be decapitated, \\"as a fit punishment and appropriate stigma.\\" This is what happened to Jeremiah Brandreth, leader of a 100-strong contingent of men in the Pentrich rising and one of three men executed in 1817 at Derby Gaol. As with Edward Despard and his confederates the three were drawn to the scaffold on sledges before being hanged for about an hour, and then on the insistence of the Prince Regent were beheaded with an axe. The local miner appointed to the task of beheading them was inexperienced though, and having failed with the first two blows, completed his job with a knife. As he held the first head up and made the customary announcement, the crowd reacted with horror and fled. A different reaction was seen in 1820, when amidst more social unrest five men involved in the Cato Street Conspiracy were hanged and beheaded at Newgate Prison. Although the beheading was performed by a surgeon, following the usual proclamation the crowd was angry enough to force the executioners to find safety behind the prison walls. The plot was the last crime for which the sentence was applied. Reformation of England's capital punishment laws continued throughout the 19th century, as politicians such as John Russell, 1st Earl Russell, sought to remove from the statute books many of the capital offences that remained. Robert Peel's drive to ameliorate law enforcement saw petty treason abolished by the Offences against the Person Act 1828, which removed the distinction between crimes formerly considered as petty treason, and murder. The Royal Commission on Capital Punishment 1864‚Äì1866 recommended that there be no change to treason law, quoting the \\"more merciful\\" Treason Felony Act 1848, which limited the punishment for most treasonous acts to penal servitude. Its report recommended that for \\"rebellion, assassination or other violence ...we are of opinion that the extreme penalty must remain\\", although the most recent occasion (and ultimately, the last) on which anyone had been sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered was in November 1839, following the Chartist Newport Rising‚Äîand those men sentenced to death were instead transported. The report highlighted the changing public mood toward public executions (brought about in part by the growing prosperity created by the Industrial Revolution). Home Secretary Spencer Horatio Walpole told the commission that executions had \\"become so demoralizing that, instead of its having a good effect, it has a tendency rather to brutalize the public mind than to deter the criminal class from committing crime\\". The commission recommended that executions should be performed privately, behind prison walls and away from the public's view, \\"under such regulations as may be considered necessary to prevent abuse, and to satisfy the public that the law has been complied with.\\" The practice of executing murderers in public was ended two years later by the Capital Punishment Amendment Act 1868, introduced by Home Secretary Gathorne Hardy, but this did not apply to traitors.Kenny, p. 319 An amendment to abolish capital punishment completely, suggested before the bill's third reading, failed by 127 votes to 23. Hanging, drawing, and quartering was abolished in England by the Forfeiture Act 1870, Liberal politician Charles Forster's second attempt since 1864 to end the forfeiture of a felon's lands and goods (thereby not making paupers of his family). The Act limited the penalty for treason to hanging alone, although it did not remove the monarch's right under the 1814 Act to replace hanging with beheading. Beheading was abolished in 1973,Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1973 (c. 39), Sch. 1 Pt. V. although it had long been obsolete. The death penalty for treason was abolished by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, enabling the UK to ratify protocol six of the European Convention on Human Rights in 1999. In the United States In some of the places where the American War of Independence developed into a fierce civil war among American factions, there are recorded cases of both sides resorting to hanging, drawing, and quartering ‚Äì both Loyalists and Patriots finding reasons to construe their opponents as being \\"traitors\\" deserving of such a fate.Armitage, David. Every Great Revolution Is a Civil War . In: Keith Michael Baker and Dan Edelstein (eds.). Scripting Revolution: A Historical Approach to the Comparative Study of Revolutions. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2015. According to Armitage, \\"The renaming can happen relatively quickly: for example, the transatlantic conflict of the 1770s that many contemporaries saw as a British \\"civil war\\" or even \\"the American Civil War\\" was first called \\"the American Revolution\\" in 1776 by the chief justice of South Carolina, William Henry Drayton.\\"  See also  * Dismemberment * List of people hanged, drawn and quartered References Footnotes Notes Bibliography             =Further reading= Execution methods Torture English criminal law Medieval English law ","title":"Hanged, drawn and quartered"},{"id":"21304250","text":"Burn Notice is an American television action-drama series created by Matt Nix and starring Jeffrey Donovan, Gabrielle Anwar, Bruce Campbell, and Sharon Gless. The second season premiered July 10, 2008. The season was split into two parts, with episodes 1‚Äì9 airing in the summer of 2008 and episodes 10‚Äì16 being broadcast in early 2009. A burn notice is a document issued by intelligence agencies to discredit or announce the dismissal of agents or sources who are considered to have become unreliable. The television series is a first-person narrative (including frequent stream of consciousness voice- overs providing nuggets of exposition) from the viewpoint of covert-operations agent Michael Westen, played by Jeffrey Donovan. Michael Westen often delivers tips on unrelated subject matters, such as on burglar-proofing houses or getting promoted during commercial breaks.  Season overview  The second season of Burn Notice continues the plot lines of the first season. Michael Westen had struggled to find out why he had been burned and by whom. Westen continues his work as an unlicensed private investigator and freelance spy for anyone in town who can pay him any money in order to fund his personal investigation into his own situation as a blacklisted agent. Westen battles and outwits an array of mobsters, con artists, contract killers, professional thieves, drug traffickers, arms dealers and kidnappers. Michael must also battle personal demons, chief among which is his relationship with Fiona. Season 2 introduces a mysterious woman named \\"Carla\\" (Tricia Helfer), an agent of the organization behind Michael's burn notice who is now trying to get him to work for that organization. Although he resists, she assigns him various tasks (which he later learns are preparation for an assassination), while he also attempts to find out who she is. She often coerces him into working for her by threatening the people he cares about with violence. Midway through the season, Michael is almost assassinated by an unknown group. Carla gets the assignment to discover who placed the hit, as the mystery assassin also killed the operative involved in her assassination, while Michael digs around for the mastermind to find what could be either a potential ally or a dangerous new enemy. Carla's operation is sabotaged by a rogue agent in her organization, and Michael is assigned to find out who it was: Victor Stricker-Epps (Michael Shanks), another agent of the organisation who was trying to destroy them from within after he learned that Carla had his wife and child killed as part of his recruitment. He also reveals that Carla is trying to kill them both because Victor has proof that Carla is corrupt: using the organisations resources for personal profit and to settle old vendettas, and Michael is helping him. At the end of Season 2, after Carla is killed by Fiona and Michael kills Victor in an act of mercy, He has an encounter with Carla's superior, simply known as \\"Management\\" (John Mahoney). Putting the pieces together, Michael realizes that Management falsified records to paint him as both corrupt and unreliable, forcing the government to burn him. When Michael demands Management leave him alone, Management complies. While it frees Michael from their grasp, it also removes the organization's protection, which now exposes Michael to police attention and allows enemies he made as a U.S. covert operative to track him down.  Cast  Jeffrey Donovan returned as the still-burned spy Michael Westen. Gabrielle Anwar reprised her role as ex-IRA operative Fiona Glenanne, and Bruce Campbell returned as ex-Navy SEAL Sam Axe. Sharon Gless also returned, as Madeline Westen, Michael's mother. The second season saw even more recurring guests than the first. The most prominent of these was Tricia Helfer, who appeared in many episodes as Michael's handler, Carla. Paul Tei also made several appearances returning as money-launderer Barry Burkowski. Seth Peterson returned as Michael's brother, Nate Westen. Michael Shanks was introduced as wrangler Victor Stecker-Epps. Silas Weir Mitchell made two appearances as the quirky arms dealer Seymour. Marc Macaulay and Brandon Morris returned for one episode as Agents Harris and Lane, two FBI agents who were formerly in charge of Michael's surveillance. Agent Jason Bly, another FBI agent, also returned for one episode, portrayed by Alex Carter. Gary Weeks made various appearances as Campbell, Fiona's boyfriend, while Audrey Landers made a single appearance in her previous role as Sam's girlfriend, Veronica. Virgil Watkins, a former client, made an appearance, portrayed by Chris Ellis. Various other characters were introduced, who later became important recurring characters. These included John Mahoney as Management, Tim Matheson as Michael's former mentor-turned-assassin \\"Dead\\" Larry Sizemore, and Jay Karnes as arms dealer Tyler Brennen. Notable one-time guest stars included Kevin Alejandro, Erick Avari, Rob Benedict, Assaf Cohen, Patrick Fabian, Oded Fehr, Method Man, Larry Miller, Amy Pietz, Clarence Williams III, and Fawad Siddiqui.

The implication of such a phrase is that the circumstances in question (the adynaton, and the circumstances to which the adynaton is being applied) will never occur. The phrase has been used in various forms since the 1600s as a sarcastic remark. Meaning John Moore-Brabazon, 1st Baron Brabazon of Tara took a small pig with him on board an aeroplane in 1909 \\"When pigs fly\\" is an adynaton, a way of saying that something will never happen. The phrase is often used for humorous effect, to scoff at over-ambition. There are numerous variations on the theme; when an individual with a reputation for failure finally succeeds, onlookers may sarcastically claim to see a flying pig. (\\"Hey look! A flying pig!\\") Other variations on the phrase include \\"And pigs will fly\\", this one in retort to an outlandish statement. An example occurs in the film The Eagle Has Landed: an Irish secret agent working for the Nazis replies to a German general speaking of Germany's shortly winning World War II, \\"Pigs may fly, General, but I doubt it!\\" Later, when the Irishman sees German soldiers parachuting before an attack, he says to himself, \\"Mother of God! Flying pigs!\\" An identical phrase, used to express impossibilities, exists in Romanian, C√¢nd o zbura porcul, literally meaning \\"When the pig shall fly\\"; an equivalent also implying an animal is La Pa»ôtele cailor, literally: \\"on horses' Easter\\". Similar phrases in English include \\"when hell freezes over\\", the Latin expression \\"to the Greek calends\\", and \\"and monkeys might fly out of my butt\\", popularized in Wayne's World skits and movies. They are examples of adynata. In Finnish, the expression \\"kun lehm√§t lent√§v√§t\\" (when cows fly) is used because of its alliteration. In French, the most common expression is \\"quand les poules auront des dents\\" (when hens will have teeth). In medieval Hebrew manuscripts, the expression \\"until the donkey ascends the ladder\\" is attested. The idiom is apparently derived from a centuries-old Scottish proverb, though some other references to pigs flying or pigs with wings are more famous. At least one appears in the works of Lewis Carroll: American literature author John Steinbeck was told by his professor that he would be an author when pigs flew. When he eventually became a novelist, he started to print every book he wrote with the insignia \\"Ad astra per alas porci\\" (to the stars on the wings of a pig).John Steinbeck: A Biography, Jay Parini, Holt Publishing, 1996 He sometimes added an image of a flying pig, called \\"Pigasus\\". Incidentally, a pig finally flew on 4th November 1909, when John Moore-Brabazon, 1st Baron Brabazon of Tara took a small pig with him on board an aeroplane.

This crystal oscillator creates a signal with very precise frequency, so that quartz clocks are at least an order of magnitude more accurate than mechanical clocks. Generally, some form of digital logic counts the cycles of this signal and provides a numeric time display, usually in units of hours, minutes, and seconds. The world's first quartz clock was built in 1927 by Warren Marrison and J. W. Horton at Bell Telephone Laboratories. The world's first quartz watch, however, was unveiled by Japanese watchmaker Seiko as the Astron in December 1969. Since the 1980s, when the advent of solid-state digital electronics allowed them to be made compact and inexpensive, quartz timekeepers have become the world's most widely used timekeeping technology, used in most clocks and watches as well as computers and other appliances that keep time.  Explanation  Chemically, quartz is a specific form of a compound called silicon dioxide. Many materials can be formed into plates that will resonate. However, quartz is also a piezoelectric material: that is, when a quartz crystal is subject to mechanical stress, such as bending, it accumulates electrical charge across some planes. In a reverse effect, if charges are placed across the crystal plane, quartz crystals will bend. Since quartz can be directly driven (to flex) by an electric signal, no additional transducer is required to use it in a resonator. Similar crystals are used in low-end phonograph cartridges: The movement of the stylus (needle) flexes a quartz crystal, which produces a small voltage, which is amplified and played through speakers. Quartz microphones are still available, though not common. Quartz has a further advantage in that its size does not change much as temperature fluctuates. Fused quartz is often used for laboratory equipment that must not change shape along with the temperature. A quartz plate's resonance frequency, based on its size, will not significantly rise or fall. Similarly, since its resonator does not change shape, a quartz clock will remain relatively accurate as the temperature changes. First European quartz clock for consumers \\"Astrochron\\", Junghans, Schramberg, 1967 (German Clock Museum, Inv. 1995-603) Seiko Astron, Caliber 35A, Nr. 00234, Seiko, Japan, 1969 (German Clock Museum, Inv. 2010-006) In the early 20th century, radio engineers sought a precise, stable source of radio frequencies and started at first with steel resonators. However, when Walter Guyton Cady found that quartz can resonate with less equipment and better temperature stability, steel resonators disappeared within a few years. Later, scientists at NIST (then the U.S. National Bureau of Standards) discovered that a crystal oscillator could be more accurate than a pendulum clock. The electronic circuit is an oscillator, an amplifier whose output passes through the quartz resonator. The resonator acts as an electronic filter, eliminating all but the single frequency of interest. The output of the resonator feeds back to the input of the amplifier, and the resonator assures that the oscillator \\"howls\\" with the exact frequency of interest. When the circuit starts up, even a single shot can cascade to bringing the oscillator to the desired frequency. If the amplifier is too perfect, the oscillator will not start. The frequency at which the crystal oscillates depends on its shape, size, and the crystal plane on which the quartz is cut. The positions at which electrodes are placed can slightly change the tuning as well. If the crystal is accurately shaped and positioned, it will oscillate at a desired frequency. In nearly all quartz watches, the frequency is , and the crystal is cut in a small tuning fork shape on a particular crystal plane. This frequency is a power of two ( = 215), just high enough to exceed the human hearing range, yet low enough to permit inexpensive counters to derive a 1-second pulse. A 15-bit binary digital counter driven by the frequency will overflow once per second, creating a digital pulse once per second. The pulse-per-second output can be used to drive many kinds of clocks. Although quartz has a very low coefficient of thermal expansion, temperature changes are the major cause of frequency variation in crystal oscillators. The most obvious way of reducing the effect of temperature on oscillation rate is to keep the crystal at a constant temperature. For laboratory-grade oscillators an oven-controlled crystal oscillator is used, in which the crystal is kept in a very small oven that is held at a constant temperature. This method is, however, impractical for consumer quartz clock and wrist-watch movements. The crystal planes and tuning of a consumer-grade clock crystal are designed for minimal temperature sensitivity in terms of their effect on frequency and operate best at about . At that temperature the crystal oscillates at its fastest. A higher or lower temperature will result in a ‚àí0.035 ppm/¬∞C2 (slower) oscillation rate. So a ¬±1 ¬∞C temperature deviation will account for a (¬±1)2 √ó ‚àí0.035 ppm = ‚àí0.035 ppm rate change, which is equivalent to ‚àí1.1 seconds per year. If, instead, the crystal experiences a ¬±10 ¬∞C temperature deviation, then the rate change will be (¬±10)2 √ó ‚àí0.035 ppm = ‚àí3.5 ppm, which is equivalent to ‚àí110 seconds per year. Quartz watch manufacturers use a simplified version of the oven- controlled crystal oscillator method by recommending that their watches be worn regularly to ensure best performance. Regular wearing of a quartz watch significantly reduces the magnitude of environmental temperature swings, since a correctly designed watch case forms an expedient crystal oven that uses the stable temperature of the human body to keep the crystal in its most accurate temperature range.  Mechanism  Basic quartz wristwatch movement. Bottom right: quartz crystal oscillator, left: button cell watch battery, top right: oscillator counter, top left: the coil of the stepper motor that powers the watch hands. Picture of a quartz crystal resonator, used as the timekeeping component in quartz watches and clocks, with the case removed. It is formed in the shape of a tuning fork. Most such quartz clock crystals vibrate at a frequency of . In modern quartz clocks, the quartz crystal resonator or oscillator is in the shape of a small tuning fork (XY-cut), laser-trimmed or precision lapped to vibrate at . This frequency is equal to 215 cycles per second. A power of 2 is chosen so a simple chain of digital divide-by-2 stages can derive the 1 Hz signal needed to drive the watch's second hand. In most clocks, the resonator is in a small can or flat package, about 4 mm long. The resonator has become so common due to a compromise between the large physical size of low-frequency crystals for watches and the large current drain of high-frequency crystals, which reduces the life of the watch battery. During the 1970s, the introduction of metal‚Äìoxide‚Äìsemiconductor (MOS) integrated circuits allowed a 12-month battery life from a single coin cell when driving either a mechanical Lavet-type stepping motor, a smooth sweeping non-stepping motor, or a liquid-crystal display (in an LCD digital watch). Light-emitting diode (LED) displays for watches have become rare due to their comparatively high battery consumption. The basic formula for calculating the fundamental frequency (f) of vibration of a cantilever as a function of its dimensions (quadratic cross-section) is :f = frac{1.875104^2}{2pi} frac{a}{l^2} sqrt{frac{E}{12 rho}}, where : 1.875104 (rounded) is the smallest positive solution of the equation cos(x) cosh(x) = ‚àí1, : l is the length of the cantilever, : a is its thickness along the direction of motion, : E is its Young's modulus, : œÅ is its density. A cantilever made of quartz (E = 1011 N/m2 = 100 GPa and œÅ = 2634 kg/m3) with a length of 3 mm and a thickness of 0.3 mm has thus a fundamental frequency around 33 kHz. The crystal is tuned to exactly 215 = or runs at a slightly higher frequency with inhibition compensation (see below).  Accuracy  The relative stability of the quartz resonator and its driving circuit is much better than its absolute accuracy. Standard-quality 32,768 Hz resonators of this type are warranted to have a long-term accuracy of about six parts per million (0.0006%) at : that is, a typical quartz clock or wristwatch will gain or lose 15 seconds per 30 days (within a normal temperature range of ) or less than a half second clock drift per day when worn near the body. =Inhibition compensation= Many inexpensive quartz clocks and watches use a technique known as inhibition compensation.\\"The Accuracy and Stability of Quartz Watches\\" by Michael Lombardi (2008). The crystal is deliberately made to run somewhat faster. After manufacturing, each module is calibrated against a precision clock at the factory and adjusted to keep accurate time by programming the digital logic to skip a small number of crystal cycles at regular intervals, such as 10 seconds or 1 minute. For a typical quartz movement this allows programmed adjustments in 7.91 seconds per 30 days increments for 10-second intervals (on a 10-second measurement gate) or programmed adjustments in 1.32 seconds per 30 days increments for 60-second intervals (on a 60-second measurement gate). The advantage of this method is that using digital programming to store the number of pulses to suppress in a non-volatile memory register on the chip is less expensive than the older technique of trimming the quartz tuning-fork frequency. The inhibition-compensation logic of some quartz movements can be regulated by service centers with the help of a precision timer and adjustment terminal after leaving the factory, though many inexpensive quartz watch movements do not offer this functionality. =Internal adjustment= Omega 4.19 MHz Ships Marine Chronometer, French Navy issued Some premium movement designs self-rate and self-regulate. That is, rather than just counting vibrations, their computer program takes the simple count and scales it using a ratio calculated between an epoch set at the factory, and the most recent time the clock was set. These clocks become more accurate as they age. It is possible for a computerized high-accuracy quartz movement to measure its temperature and adjust for that as well. Both analog and digital temperature compensation have been used in high-end quartz watches. In more expensive high-end quartz watches, thermal compensation can be implemented by varying the number of cycles to inhibit depending on the output from a temperature sensor. The COSC average daily rate standard for officially certified COSC quartz chronometers is ¬±25.55 seconds per year at 23 ¬∞C. To acquire the COSC chronometer label, a quartz instrument must benefit from thermo-compensation and rigorous encapsulation. Each quartz chronometer is tested for 13 days, in one position, at 3 different temperatures and 4 different relative humidity levels.COSC quartz movements Thermocompensated quartz movements, even in wrist watches, can be accurate to within ¬±5 to ¬±25 seconds per year and can be used as marine chronometers to determine longitude by means of celestial navigation.In Pursuit of Perfection : Thermocompensated Quartz Watches and Their Movements =External adjustment= If a quartz movement is \\"rated\\" by measuring its timekeeping characteristics against a radio clock's time broadcast, to determine how much time the watch gains or loses per day, and adjustments are made to the circuitry to \\"regulate\\" the timekeeping, then the corrected time will easily be accurate within ¬±10 seconds per year. This is more than adequate to perform celestial navigation. Quartz crystal ageing Clock quartz crystals are manufactured in an ultra-clean environment and protected by an inert ultra-high-vacuum environment in hermetically sealed containers. Still the frequency of a quartz crystal can slowly change over time causing the frequency to increase or decrease over time. The effect of ageing is much smaller than the effect of frequency variation caused by temperature changes and manufacturers can estimate its effects. Generally, the ageing effect eventually decreases the frequency. Factors that can cause a small frequency drift over time are stress relief in the mounting structure, loss of hermetic seal, contaminations contained in the crystal lattice, moisture absorption, changes in or on the quartz crystal, severe shock and vibrations effects, exposure to very high temperatures.Introduction to Quartz Frequency Standards - Aging Crystal aging tends to be logarithmic meaning the maximum rate of change of frequency occurs immediately after manufacture and decays thereafter. Most of the aging will occur within the first year of the crystals service life. Crystals do eventually stop aging (asymptotically), but it can take many years. Movement manufacturers can pre-age crystals before assembling them into clock movements. To promote accelerated ageing the crystals are exposed to high temperatures.Quartz Crystal Ageing If a crystal is pre-aged, the manufacturer can measure its ageing rates (strictly, the coefficients in the ageing formula) and have a microcontroller calculate out the corrections over time. The initial calibration of a movement will stay accurate longer if the crystals are pre-aged. The advantage would end after subsequent regulation which resets any cumulative aging error to zero. A reason more expensive movements tend to be more accurate is that the crystals are pre-aged longer and selected for better ageing performance. Sometimes, pre-aged crystals are hand selected for movement performance.Is The Citizen Caliber 0100 The World‚Äôs Most Accurate Watch?  Chronometers  Quartz chronometers designed as time standards often include a crystal oven, to keep the crystal at a constant temperature. Some self-rate and include \\"crystal farms\\", so that the clock can take the average of a set of time measurements.  History  NIST) that became the first quartz frequency standard for the United States in 1929. Kept in temperature-controlled ovens to prevent frequency drift due to thermal expansion or contraction of the large quartz resonators (mounted under the glass domes on top of the units) they achieved accuracy of 10‚àí7, roughly 1 second error in 4 months. The first Swiss quartz clock, which was made after WW II (left), on display at the International Museum of Horology in La Chaux-de-Fonds The piezoelectric properties of quartz were discovered by Jacques and Pierre Curie in 1880. The first quartz crystal oscillator was built by Walter G. Cady in 1921. In 1923, D. W. Dye at the National Physical Laboratory in the UK and Warren Marrison at Bell Telephone Laboratories produced sequences of precision time signals with quartz oscillators. In 1927, the first quartz clock was built by Warren Marrison and J. W. Horton at Bell Telephone Laboratories. The next 3 decades saw the development of quartz clocks as precision time standards in laboratory settings; the bulky delicate counting electronics, built with vacuum tubes, limited their use elsewhere. In 1932 a quartz clock was able to measure tiny variations in the rotation rate of the Earth over periods as short as a few weeks.Marrison , 1948. In Japan in 1932, Issac Koga developed a crystal cut that gave an oscillation frequency with greatly reduced temperature dependence. The National Bureau of Standards (now NIST) based the time standard of the US on quartz clocks between the 1930s and the 1960s, after which it transitioned to atomic clocks. The wider use of quartz clock technology had to await the development of cheap semiconductor digital logic in the 1960s. The revised 14th edition of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica stated that quartz clocks would probably never be affordable enough to be used domestically. The world's first prototype analog quartz wristwatches were revealed in 1967: the Beta 1 revealed by the Centre Electronique Horloger (CEH) in Neuch√¢tel Switzerland, and the prototype of the Astron revealed by Seiko in Japan (Seiko had been working on quartz clocks since 1958).Carlene Stephens and Maggie Dennis Engineering time: inventing the electronic wristwatch. In December 1969, Seiko produced the world's first commercial quartz wristwatch, the Seiko-Quartz Astron 35SQ which is now honored with IEEE Milestone. The Astron had a quartz oscillator with a frequency of 8192 Hz and was accurate to 0.2 seconds per day, 5 seconds per month, or 1 minute per year. The Astron was released less than a year prior to the introduction of the Swiss Beta 21, which was developed by 16 Swiss Watch manufacturers and used by Rolex, Patek and Omega in their electroquartz models. The inherent accuracy and low cost of production has resulted in the proliferation of quartz clocks and watches since that time. By the 1980s, quartz technology had taken over applications such as kitchen timers, alarm clocks, bank vault time locks, and time fuzes on munitions, from earlier mechanical balance wheel movements, an upheaval known in watchmaking as the quartz crisis. Quartz timepieces have dominated the wristwatch and clock market since the 1980s. Because of the high Q factor and low temperature coefficient of the quartz crystal, they are more accurate than the best mechanical timepieces, and the elimination of all moving parts makes them more rugged and eliminates the need for periodic maintenance. A quartz clock hung on a wall Commercial analog and digital wall clocks became available in 2014 that utilize a double oven quartz oscillator, accurate to 0.2 ppb. These clocks are factory-synchronized with the atomic time standard and typically do not require any further time adjustments for the life of the clock.

DOS primarily consists of Microsoft's MS-DOS and a rebranded version under the name IBM PC DOS, both of which were introduced in 1981. Later compatible systems from other manufacturers include DR DOS (1988), ROM- DOS (1989), PTS-DOS (1993), and FreeDOS (1998). MS-DOS dominated the IBM PC compatible market between 1981 and 1995. Dozens of other operating systems also use the acronym \\"DOS\\", beginning with the mainframe DOS/360 from 1966. Others include Apple DOS, Apple ProDOS, Atari DOS, Commodore DOS, TRSDOS, and AmigaDOS.  History = Origins = Screenshot showing Digital Research Apple CP/M on a Z-80 SoftCard for the Apple II IBM PC DOS (and the separately sold MS-DOS) and its predecessor, 86-DOS, was based on Digital Research's CP/M‚Äîthe dominant disk operating system for 8-bit Intel 8080 and Zilog Z80 microcomputers‚Äîbut instead ran on Intel 8086 16-bit processors. The IBM Personal Computer (IBM 5150 PC) When IBM introduced the IBM PC, built with the Intel 8088 microprocessor, they needed an operating system. Seeking an 8088-compatible build of CP/M, IBM initially approached Microsoft CEO Bill Gates (possibly believing that Microsoft owned CP/M due to the Microsoft Z-80 SoftCard, which allowed CP/M to run on an Apple II). IBM was sent to Digital Research, and a meeting was set up. However, the initial negotiations for the use of CP/M broke down; Digital Research wished to sell CP/M on a royalty basis, while IBM sought a single license, and to change the name to \\"PC DOS\\". Digital Research founder Gary Kildall refused, and IBM withdrew. SCP 86-DOS session (simulated). IBM again approached Bill Gates. Gates in turn approached Seattle Computer Products. There, programmer Tim Paterson had developed a variant of CP/M-80, intended as an internal product for testing SCP's new 16-bit Intel 8086 CPU card for the S-100 bus. The system was initially named QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System), before being made commercially available as 86-DOS. Microsoft purchased 86-DOS, allegedly for . This became Microsoft Disk Operating System, MS-DOS, introduced in 1981. Within a year Microsoft licensed MS-DOS to over 70 other companies, which supplied the operating system for their own hardware, sometimes under their own names. Microsoft later required the use of the MS-DOS name, with the exception of the IBM variant. IBM continued to develop their version, PC DOS, for the IBM PC. Digital Research became aware that an operating system similar to CP/M was being sold by IBM (under the same name that IBM insisted upon for CP/M), and threatened legal action. IBM responded by offering an agreement: they would give PC consumers a choice of PC DOS or CP/M-86, Kildall's 8086 version. Side-by-side, CP/M cost more than PC DOS, and sales were low. CP/M faded, with MS-DOS and PC DOS becoming the marketed operating system for PCs and PC compatibles. Microsoft originally sold MS-DOS only to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). One major reason for this was that not all early PCs were 100% IBM PC compatible. DOS was structured such that there was a separation between the system specific device driver code (IO.SYS) and the DOS kernel (MSDOS.SYS). Microsoft provided an OEM Adaptation Kit (OAK) which allowed OEMs to customize the device driver code to their particular system. By the early 1990s, most PCs adhered to IBM PC standards so Microsoft began selling MS-DOS in retail with MS-DOS 5.0. In the mid-1980s Microsoft developed a multitasking version of DOS. This version of DOS is generally referred to as \\"European MS-DOS 4\\" because it was developed for ICL and licensed to several European companies. This version of DOS supports preemptive multitasking, shared memory, device helper services and New Executable (\\"NE\\") format executables. None of these features were used in later versions of DOS, but they were used to form the basis of the OS/2 1.0 kernel. This version of DOS is distinct from the widely released PC DOS 4.0 which was developed by IBM and based upon DOS 3.3. Digital Research CP/M-86 for the IBM Personal Computer Version 1.0 Digital Research attempted to regain the market lost from CP/M-86, initially with Concurrent DOS, FlexOS and DOS Plus (both compatible with both MS-DOS and CP/M-86 software), later with Multiuser DOS (compatible with both MS-DOS and CP/M-86 software) and DR DOS (compatible with MS-DOS software). Digital Research was bought by Novell, and DR DOS became PalmDOS and Novell DOS; later, it was part of Caldera (under the names OpenDOS and DR-DOS 7.02/7.03), Lineo, and DeviceLogics. Gordon Letwin wrote in 1995 that \\"DOS was, when we first wrote it, a one-time throw-away product intended to keep IBM happy so that they'd buy our languages\\". Microsoft expected that it would be an interim solution before Xenix. The company planned to over time improve MS-DOS so it would be almost indistinguishable from single-user Xenix, or XEDOS, which would also run on the Motorola 68000, Zilog Z-8000, and LSI-11; they would be upwardly compatible with Xenix, which BYTE in 1983 described as \\"the multi-user MS-DOS of the future\\". OS/2 1.0 featured a text mode interface similar to MS-DOS IBM, however, did not want to replace DOS. After AT&T; began selling Unix, Microsoft and IBM began developing OS/2 as an alternative. The two companies later had a series of disagreements over two successor operating systems to DOS, OS/2 and Windows. They split development of their DOS systems as a result. The last retail version of MS-DOS was MS-DOS 6.22; after this, MS-DOS became part of Windows 95, 98 and Me. The last retail version of PC DOS was PC DOS 2000 (also called PC DOS 7 revision 1), though IBM did later develop PC DOS 7.10 for OEMs and internal use. The FreeDOS project began on 26 June 1994, when Microsoft announced it would no longer sell or support MS-DOS. Jim Hall then posted a manifesto proposing the development of an open-source replacement. Within a few weeks, other programmers including Pat Villani and Tim Norman joined the project. A kernel, the COMMAND.COM command line interpreter (shell), and core utilities were created by pooling code they had written or found available. There were several official pre-release distributions of FreeDOS before the FreeDOS 1.0 distribution was released on 3 September 2006. Made available under the GNU General Public License (GPL), FreeDOS does not require license fees or royalties. = Decline = Early versions of Microsoft Windows ran on a separate version of MS-DOS. By the early 1990s, the Windows graphical shell saw heavy use on new DOS systems. In 1995, Windows 95 was bundled as a standalone operating system that did not require a separate DOS license. Windows 95 (and Windows 98 and ME, that followed it) took over as the default OS kernel, though the MS-DOS component remained for compatibility. With Windows 95 and 98, but not ME, the MS-DOS component could be run without starting Windows. With DOS no longer required to use Windows, the majority of users stopped using it directly. = Continued use = DOSBox Available DOS systems in 2012 are FreeDOS, DR-DOS, ROM-DOS, PTS-DOS, RxDOS and REAL/32. Some computer manufacturers, including Dell and HP, sell computers with FreeDOS and DR-DOS as OEM operating systems.  Embedded systems  DOS's structure of accessing hardware directly makes it ideal for use in embedded devices. The final versions of DR-DOS are still aimed at this market. ROM-DOS was used as the embedded system on the Canon PowerShot Pro 70.  Emulation  On Linux, it is possible to run copies of DOS and many of its clones on DOSEMU, a Linux-native virtual machine for running DOS programs at near native speed. There are a number of other emulators for running DOS on various versions of Unix and Microsoft Windows such as DOSBox. DOSBox is designed for legacy gaming (e.g. King's Quest, Doom) on modern operating systems.  Design  MS-DOS and IBM PC DOS related operating systems are commonly associated with machines using the Intel x86 or compatible CPUs, mainly IBM PC compatibles. Machine-dependent versions of MS- DOS were produced for many non-IBM-compatible x86-based machines, with variations from relabelling of the Microsoft distribution under the manufacturer's name, to versions specifically designed to work with non-IBM- PC-compatible hardware. As long as application programs used DOS APIs instead of direct hardware access, they could run on both IBM-PC-compatible and incompatible machines. The original FreeDOS kernel, DOS-C, was derived from DOS/NT for the Motorola 68000 series of CPUs in the early 1990s. While these systems loosely resembled the DOS architecture, applications were not binary compatible due to the incompatible instruction sets of these non-x86-CPUs. However, applications written in high-level languages could be ported easily. DOS is a single-user, single-tasking operating system with basic kernel functions that are non-reentrant: only one program at a time can use them, and DOS itself has no functionality to allow more than one program to execute at a time. The DOS kernel provides various functions for programs (an application program interface), like character I/O, file management, memory management, program loading and termination. DOS provides the ability for shell scripting via batch files (with the filename extension \`.BAT\`). Each line of a batch file is interpreted as a program to run. Batch files can also make use of internal commands, such as GOTO and conditional statements. The operating system offers an application programming interface that allows development of character-based applications, but not for accessing most of the hardware, such as graphics cards, printers, or mice. This required programmers to access the hardware directly, usually resulting in each application having its own set of device drivers for each hardware peripheral. Hardware manufacturers would release specifications to ensure device drivers for popular applications were available. = Boot sequence = * The bootstrap loader on PC-compatible computers, the master boot record, is located beginning at the boot sector, the first sector on the first track (track zero), of the boot disk. The ROM BIOS will load this sector into memory at address :, and typically check for a signature \\"\\" at offset . If the sector is not considered to be valid, the ROM BIOS will try the next physical disk in the row, otherwise it will jump to the load address with certain registers set up. *If the loaded boot sector happens to be a Master Boot Record (MBR), as found on partitioned media, it will relocate itself to : in memory, 090912 dewassoc.com otherwise this step is skipped. The MBR code will scan the partition table, which is located within this sector, for an active partition (modern MBRs check if bit 7 is set at offset , whereas old MBRs simply check for a value of ), and, if found, load the first sector of the corresponding partition, which holds the Volume Boot Record (VBR) of that volume, into memory at : in the similar fashion as it had been loaded by the ROM BIOS itself. The MBR will then pass execution to the loaded portion with certain registers set up. * The sector content loaded at : constitutes a VBR now. VBRs are operating system specific and cannot be exchanged between different DOS versions in general, as the exact behaviour differs between different DOS versions. In very old versions of DOS such as DOS 1.x, the VBR would load the whole IO.SYS/IBMBIO.COM file into memory at :. 090912 pagetable.com For this to work, these sectors had to be stored in consecutive order on disk by SYS. In later issues, it would locate and store the contents of the first two entries in the root directory at : and if they happen to reflect the correct boot files as recorded in the VBR, the VBR would load the first 3 consecutive sectors of the IO.SYS/IBMBIO.COM file into memory at :. The VBR also has to take care to preserve the contents of the Disk Parameter Table (DPT). Finally, it passes control to the loaded portion by jumping to its entry point with certain registers set up (with considerable differences between different DOS versions). * In modern DOS versions, where the VBR has loaded only the first 3 sectors of the IO.SYS/IBMBIO.COM file into memory, the loaded portion contains another boot loader, which will then load the remainder of itself into memory, using the root directory information stored at :. For most versions, the file contents still need to be stored in consecutive order on disk. In older versions of DOS, which were still loaded as a whole, this step is skipped. * The DOS system initialization code will initialize its built-in device drivers and then load the DOS kernel, located in MSDOS.SYS on MS-DOS systems, into memory as well. In Windows 9x, the DOS system initialization code and built-in device drivers and the DOS kernel are combined into a single IO.SYS file while MSDOS.SYS is used as a text configuration file. * The CONFIG.SYS file is then read to parse configuration parameters. The variable specifies the location of the shell which defaults to COMMAND.COM. * The shell is loaded and executed. * The startup batch file AUTOEXEC.BAT is then run by the shell. 090913 academic.evergreen.edu The DOS system files loaded by the boot sector must be contiguous and be the first two directory entries. 090912 arl.wustl.edu As such, removing and adding this file is likely to render the media unbootable. It is, however, possible to replace the shell at will, a method that can be used to start the execution of dedicated applications faster. This limitation does not apply to any version of DR DOS, where the system files can be located anywhere in the root directory and do not need to be contiguous. Therefore, system files can be simply copied to a disk provided that the boot sector is DR DOS compatible already. In PC DOS and DR DOS 5.0 and above, the DOS system files are named IBMBIO.COM instead of IO.SYS and IBMDOS.COM instead of MSDOS.SYS. Older versions of DR DOS used DRBIOS.SYS and DRBDOS.SYS instead. Starting with MS- DOS 7.0 the binary system files IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS were combined into a single file IO.SYS whilst MSDOS.SYS became a configuration file similar to CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT. If the MSDOS.SYS BootGUI directive is set to \`0\`, the boot process will stop with the command processor (typically COMMAND.COM) loaded, instead of executing WIN.COM automatically. = File system = DOS uses a filesystem which supports 8.3 filenames: 8 characters for the filename and 3 characters for the extension. Starting with DOS 2 hierarchical directories are supported. Each directory name is also 8.3 format but the maximum directory path length is 64 characters due to the internal current directory structure (CDS) tables that DOS maintains. Including the drive name, the maximum length of a fully qualified filename that DOS supports is 80 characters using the format drive:pathfilename.ext followed by a null byte. DOS uses the File Allocation Table (FAT) filesystem. This was originally FAT12 which supported up to 4078 clusters per drive. DOS 3.0 added support for FAT16 which used 16-bit allocation entries and supported up to 65518 clusters per drive. Compaq MS-DOS 3.31 added support for FAT16B which removed the 32 MB drive limit and could support up to 512 MB. Finally MS-DOS 7.1 (the DOS component of Windows 9x) added support for FAT32 which used 32-bit allocation entries and could support hard drives up to 137 GB and beyond. Starting with DOS 3.1, file redirector support was added to DOS. This was initially used to support networking but was later used to support CD-ROM drives with MSCDEX. IBM PC DOS 4.0 also had preliminary installable file system (IFS) support but this was unused and removed in DOS 5.0. DOS also supported Block Devices (\\"Disk Drive\\" devices) loaded from CONFIG.SYS that could be used under the DOS file system to support network devices.  Drive naming scheme  In DOS, drives are referred to by identifying letters. Standard practice is to reserve \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" for floppy drives. On systems with only one floppy drive DOS assigns both letters to the drive, prompting the user to swap disks as programs alternate access between them. This facilitates copying from floppy to floppy or having a program run from one floppy while accessing its data on another. Hard drives were originally assigned the letters \\"C\\" and \\"D\\". DOS could only support one active partition per drive. As support for more hard drives became available, this developed into first assigning a drive letter to each drive's active primary partition, then making a second pass over the drives to allocate letters to logical drives in the extended partition, then a third pass to give any other non-active primary partitions their names (where such additional partitions existed and contained a DOS-supported file system). Lastly, DOS allocates letters for optical disc drives, RAM disks, and other hardware. Letter assignments usually occur in the order the drivers are loaded, but the drivers can instruct DOS to assign a different letter; drivers for network drives, for example, typically assign letters nearer the end of the alphabet. Because DOS applications use these drive letters directly (unlike the /dev directory in Unix-like systems), they can be disrupted by adding new hardware that needs a drive letter. An example is the addition of a new hard drive having a primary partition where a pre-existing hard drive contains logical drives in extended partitions; the new drive will be assigned a letter that was previously assigned to one of the extended partition logical drives. Moreover, even adding a new hard drive having only logical drives in an extended partition would still disrupt the letters of RAM disks and optical drives. This problem persisted through Microsoft's DOS-based 9x versions of Windows until they were replaced by versions based on the NT line, which preserves the letters of existing drives until the user changes them. Under DOS, this problem can be worked around by defining a SUBST drive and installing the DOS program into this logical drive. The assignment of this drive would then be changed in a batch job whenever the application starts. Under some versions of Concurrent DOS, as well as under Multiuser DOS, System Manager and REAL/32, the reserved drive letter L: will automatically be assigned to the corresponding load drive whenever an application starts.  Reserved device names  There are reserved device names in DOS that cannot be used as filenames regardless of extension as they are occupied by built-in character devices. These restrictions also affect several Windows versions, in some cases causing crashes and security vulnerabilities. The reserved names are: * \`CON\`, for console * \`AUX\`, for auxiliary * \`PRN\`, for printer * \`LST\`, for lister; introduced with 86-DOS 0.74. * \`NUL\`, for null devices; added in 86-DOS 1.10 and PC DOS 1.0. These names (except for NUL) continued to be supported in all versions of MS-DOS, PC DOS and DR-DOS ever since. \`LST\` was also available in some OEM versions of MS-DOS 1.25, whereas other OEM versions of MS-DOS 1.25 already used \`LPT1\` (first line printer) and \`COM1\` (first serial communication device) instead, as introduced with PC DOS. In addition to \`LPT1\` and \`LPT2\` as well as \`COM1\` to \`COM3\`, Hewlett-Packard's MS-DOS 2.11 for the HP Portable Plus also supported \`LST\` as alias for \`LPT2\` and \`82164A\` as alias for \`COM2\`; it also supported \`PLT\` for plotters. Otherwise, \`COM2\`, \`LPT2\`, \`LPT3\` and the \`CLOCK$\` (still named \`CLOCK\` in some issues of MS-DOS 2.11 (NB. While the publishers claim this would be MS-DOS 1.1 and 2.0, it actually is SCP MS-DOS 1.25 and a mixture of Altos MS-DOS 2.11 and TeleVideo PC DOS 2.11.)) clock device were introduced with DOS 2.0, and \`COM3\` and \`COM4\` were added with DOS 3.3. Only the multitasking MS-DOS 4 supported \`KEYBD$\` and \`SCREEN$\`. DR DOS 5.0 and higher and Multiuser DOS support an \`$IDLE$\` device for dynamic idle detection to saving power and improve multitasking. \`LPT4\` is an optional built-in driver for a fourth line printer supported in some versions of DR-DOS since 7.02. \`CONFIG$\` constitutes the real mode PnP manager in MS-DOS 7.0-8.0. \`AUX\` typically defaults to \`COM1\`, and \`PRN\` to \`LPT1\` (\`LST\`), but these defaults can be changed in some versions of DOS to point to other serial or parallel devices. Op702src.zip is an unofficial renamed distribution of the ibmbioa3.zip file --> \`PLT\` was reconfigurable as well. Filenames ended with a colon () such as \`NUL:\` conventionally indicate device names, but the colon is not actually a part of the name of the built-in device drivers. Colons are not necessary to be typed in some cases, for example: ECHO This achieves nothing > NUL It is still possible to create files or directories using these reserved device names, such as through direct editing of directory data structures in disk sectors. Such naming, such as starting a file name with a space, has sometimes been used by viruses or hacking programs to obscure files from users who do not know how to access these locations. = Memory management = DOS was originally designed for the Intel 8086/8088 processor and therefore could only directly access a maximum of 1 MB of RAM. Due to PC architecture only a maximum of 640 KB (known as conventional memory) is available as the upper 384 KB is reserved. Specifications were developed to allow access to additional memory. The first was the Expanded Memory Specification (EMS) which originally allowed memory on an add-on card to be accessed via a 64 KB page frame in the reserved upper memory area. 80386 and later systems could use a virtual 8086 mode (V86) mode memory manager like EMM386 to create expanded memory from extended memory without the need of an add-on card. The second specification was the Extended Memory Specification (XMS) for 80286 and later systems. This provided a way to copy data to and from extended memory, access to the 65520-byte High Memory Area (HMA) directly above the first megabyte of memory and the Upper Memory Block (UMB) area. Generally XMS support was provided by HIMEM.SYS or a V86 mode memory manager like QEMM or 386MAX which also supported EMS. Starting with DOS 5, DOS could directly take advantage of the HMA by loading its kernel code and disk buffers there via the DOS=HIGH statement in CONFIG.SYS. DOS 5+ also allowed the use of available UMBs via the DOS=UMB statement in CONFIG.SYS. = DOS under OS/2 and Windows = The DOS emulation in OS/2 and Windows runs in much the same way as native applications do. They can access all of the drives and services, and can even use the host's clipboard services. Because the drivers for file systems and such forth reside in the host system, the DOS emulation needs only provide a DOS API translation layer which converts DOS calls to OS/2 or Windows system calls. The translation layer generally also converts BIOS calls and virtualizes common I/O port accesses which many DOS programs commonly use. In Windows 3.1 and 9x, the DOS virtual machine is provided by WINOLDAP. WinOldAp creates a virtual machine based on the program's PIF file, and the system state when Windows was loaded. The DOS graphics mode, both character and graphic, can be captured and run in the window. DOS applications can use the Windows clipboard by accessing extra published calls in WinOldAp, and one can paste text through the WinOldAp graphics. The emulated DOS in OS/2 and Windows NT is based upon DOS 5. Although there is a default configuration (config.sys and autoexec.bat), one can use alternate files on a session-by-session basis. It is possible to load drivers in these files to access the host system, although these are typically third-party. Under OS/2 2.x and later, the DOS emulation is provided by DOSKRNL. This is a file that represents the combined IBMBIO.COM and IBMDOS.COM, the system calls are passed through to the OS/2 windowing services. DOS programs run in their own environment, the bulk of the DOS utilities are provided by bound DOS / OS2 applications in the OS2 directory. OS/2 can run Windows 3.1 applications by using a modified copy of Windows (Win-OS/2). The modifications allow Windows 3.1 programs to run seamlessly on the OS/2 desktop, or one can start a WinOS/2 desktop, similar to starting Windows from DOS. OS/2 allows for 'DOS from Drive A:', (VMDISK). This is a real DOS, like MS-DOS 6.22 or PC DOS 5.00. One makes a bootable floppy disk of the DOS, adds a number of drivers from OS/2, and then creates a special image. The DOS booted this way has full access to the system, but provides its own drivers for hardware. One can use such a disk to access cdrom drives for which there is no OS/2 driver. In all 32-bit (IA-32) editions of the Windows NT family since 1993, DOS emulation is provided by way of a virtual DOS machine (NTVDM). 64-bit (IA-64) versions of Windows do not support NTVDM and cannot run 16-bit DOS applications directly; third-party emulators such as DOSbox can be used to run DOS programs on those machines.  User interface  DOS systems use a command-line interface. A program is started by entering its filename at the command prompt. DOS systems include utility programs and provide internal commands that don't correspond to programs. In an attempt to provide a more user-friendly environment, numerous software manufacturers wrote file management programs that provided users with menu- and/or icon- based interfaces. becoming a self-contained program loader, and replacing DOS as the most-used PC-compatible program loader. Text user interface programs included Norton Commander, DOS Navigator, Volkov Commander, Quarterdesk DESQview, and Sidekick. Graphical user interface programs included Digital Research's GEM (originally written for CP/M) and GEOS. Eventually, the manufacturers of major DOS systems began to include their own environment managers. MS-DOS/IBM DOS 4 included DOS Shell; DR DOS 5.0, released the following year, included ViewMAX, based upon GEM. = Terminate and Stay Resident = DOS is not a multitasking operating system. DOS did however provide a Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) function which allowed programs to remain resident in memory. These programs could hook the system timer and/or keyboard interrupts to allow themselves to run tasks in the background or to be invoked at any time preempting the current running program effectively implementing a simple form of multitasking on a program-specific basis. The PRINT command did this to implement background print spooling. Borland Sidekick, a popup personal information manager (PIM), also used this technique. Terminate and Stay Resident programs were also used to provide additional features not available by default. Programs like CED and DOSKEY provided command line editing facilities beyond what was available in COMMAND.COM. Programs like the Microsoft CD-ROM Extensions (MSCDEX) provided access to files on CD-ROM disks. Some TSRs could even perform a rudimentary form of task switching. For example, the shareware program Back and Forth (1990)Version 1.47 is archived at and says \\"(C) 1990 by Progressive Solutions, Inc.\\" had a hotkey to save the state of the currently-running program to disk, load another program, and switch to it, hence it was possible to switch \\"back and forth\\" between programs, albeit slowly due to the disk access required. Back and Forth could not enable background processing however; that needed DESQview (on at least a 386).

During \\"fertilisation\\", haploid gametes come together to form a diploid zygote, and the original number of chromosomes is restored. Sexual reproduction is a type of reproduction that involves a complex life cycle in which a gamete (such as a sperm or egg cell) with a single set of chromosomes (haploid) combines with another to produce an organism composed of cells with two sets of chromosomes (diploid).John Maynard Smith & E√∂rz Szathm√°ry, The Major Transitions in Evolution, W. H. Freeman and Company, 1995, p 149 Sexual reproduction is the most common life cycle in multicellular eukaryotes, such as animals, fungi and plants. Sexual reproduction does not occur in prokaryotes (organisms without cell nuclei), but they have processes with similar effects such as bacterial conjugation, transformation and transduction, which may have been precursors to sexual reproduction in early eukaryotes. In the production of sex cells in eukaryotes, diploid mother cells divide to produce haploid cells known as gametes in a process called meiosis that involves genetic recombination. The homologous chromosomes pair up so that their DNA sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information between them. Two rounds of cell division then produce four haploid gametes, each with half the number of chromosomes from each parent cell, but with the genetic information in the parental chromosomes recombined. Two haploid gametes combine into one diploid cell known as a zygote in a process called fertilisation. The zygote incorporates genetic material from both gametes. Multiple cell divisions, without change of the number of chromosomes, then form a multicellular diploid phase or generation. In human reproduction, each cell contains 46 chromosomes in 23 pairs. Meiosis in the parents' gonads produces gametes that each contain only 23 chromosomes that are genetic recombinants of the DNA sequences contained in the parental chromosomes. When the nuclei of the gametes come together to form a fertilized egg or zygote, each cell of the resulting child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent, or 46 in total. In plants only, the diploid phase, known as the sporophyte, produces spores by meiosis that germinate and then divide by mitosis to form a haploid multicellular phase, the gametophyte, that produces gametes directly by mitosis. This type of life cycle, involving alternation between two multicellular phases, the sexual haploid gametophyte and asexual diploid sporophyte, is known as alternation of generations. The evolution of sexual reproduction is considered paradoxical, because asexual reproduction should be able to outperform it as every young organism created can bear its own young. This implies that an asexual population has an intrinsic capacity to grow more rapidly with each generation.John Maynard Smith The Evolution of Sex 1978. This 50% cost is a fitness disadvantage of sexual reproduction.Ridley M (2004) Evolution, 3rd edition. Blackwell Publishing, p. 314. The two-fold cost of sex includes this cost and the fact that any organism can only pass on 50% of its own genes to its offspring. One definite advantage of sexual reproduction is that it impedes the accumulation of genetic mutations. Sexual selection is a mode of natural selection in which some individuals out-reproduce others of a population because they are better at securing mates for sexual reproduction. It has been described as \\"a powerful evolutionary force that does not exist in asexual populations.\\" Evolution The first fossilized evidence of sexual reproduction in eukaryotes is from the Stenian period, about 1 to 1.2 billion years ago. Biologists studying evolution propose several explanations for the development of sexual reproduction and its maintenance. These reasons include reducing the likelihood of the accumulation of deleterious mutations, increasing rate of adaptation to changing environments, dealing with competition, DNA repair and masking deleterious mutations. All of these ideas about why sexual reproduction has been maintained are generally supported, but ultimately the size of the population determines if sexual reproduction is entirely beneficial. Larger populations appear to respond more quickly to some of the benefits obtained through sexual reproduction than do smaller population sizes. Maintenance of sexual reproduction has been explained by theories that work at several levels of selection, though some of these models remain controversial. However, newer models presented in recent years suggest a basic advantage for sexual reproduction in slowly reproducing complex organisms. Sexual reproduction allows these species to exhibit characteristics that depend on the specific environment that they inhabit, and the particular survival strategies that they employ. Sexual selection In order to sexually reproduce, both males and females need to find a mate. Generally in animals mate choice is made by females while males compete to be chosen. This can lead organisms to extreme efforts in order to reproduce, such as combat and display, or produce extreme features caused by a positive feedback known as a Fisherian runaway. Thus sexual reproduction, as a form of natural selection, has an effect on evolution. Sexual dimorphism is where the basic phenotypic traits vary between males and females of the same species. Dimorphism is found in both sex organs and in secondary sex characteristics, body size, physical strength and morphology, biological ornamentation, behavior and other bodily traits. However, sexual selection is only implied over an extended period of time leading to sexual dimorphism.Dimijian, G. G. (2005). Evolution of sexuality: biology and behavior. Proceedings (Baylor University. Medical Center), 18, 244‚Äì258. Sex ratio Apart from some eusocial wasps, organisms which reproduce sexually have a 1:1 sex ratio of male and female births. The English statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher outlined why this is so in what has come to be known as Fisher's principle. This essentially says the following: :# Suppose male births are less common than female. :# A newborn male then has better mating prospects than a newborn female, and therefore can expect to have more offspring. :# Therefore parents genetically disposed to produce males tend to have more than average numbers of grandchildren born to them. :# Therefore the genes for male-producing tendencies spread, and male births become more common. :# As the 1:1 sex ratio is approached, the advantage associated with producing males dies away. :# The same reasoning holds if females are substituted for males throughout. Therefore 1:1 is the equilibrium ratio. Animals=Insects= Australian emperor laying egg, guarded by the male Insect species make up more than two- thirds of all extant animal species. Most insect species reproduce sexually, though some species are facultatively parthenogenetic. Many insects species have sexual dimorphism, while in others the sexes look nearly identical. Typically they have two sexes with males producing spermatozoa and females ova. The ova develop into eggs that have a covering called the chorion, which forms before internal fertilization. Insects have very diverse mating and reproductive strategies most often resulting in the male depositing spermatophore within the female, which she stores until she is ready for egg fertilization. After fertilization, and the formation of a zygote, and varying degrees of development, in many species the eggs are deposited outside the female; while in others, they develop further within the female and are born live. =BirdsMammals= There are three extant kinds of mammals: monotremes, placentals and marsupials, all with internal fertilization. In placental mammals, offspring are born as juveniles: complete animals with the sex organs present although not reproductively functional. After several months or years, depending on the species, the sex organs develop further to maturity and the animal becomes sexually mature. Most female mammals are only fertile during certain periods during their estrous cycle, at which point they are ready to mate. Individual male and female mammals meet and carry out copulation. For most mammals, males and females exchange sexual partners throughout their adult lives.Research conducted by Patricia Adair Gowaty. Reported by =Fish= The vast majority of fish species lay eggs that are then fertilized by the male.BONY FISHES - Reproduction Some species lay their eggs on a substrate like a rock or on plants, while others scatter their eggs and the eggs are fertilized as they drift or sink in the water column. Some fish species use internal fertilization and then disperse the developing eggs or give birth to live offspring. Fish that have live-bearing offspring include the guppy and mollies or Poecilia. Fishes that give birth to live young can be ovoviviparous, where the eggs are fertilized within the female and the eggs simply hatch within the female body, or in seahorses, the male carries the developing young within a pouch, and gives birth to live young. Fishes can also be viviparous, where the female supplies nourishment to the internally growing offspring. Some fish are hermaphrodites, where a single fish is both male and female and can produce eggs and sperm. In hermaphroditic fish, some are male and female at the same time while in other fish they are serially hermaphroditic; starting as one sex and changing to the other. In at least one hermaphroditic species, self-fertilization occurs when the eggs and sperm are released together. Internal self-fertilization may occur in some other species. One fish species does not reproduce by sexual reproduction but uses sex to produce offspring; Poecilia formosa is a unisex species that uses a form of parthenogenesis called gynogenesis, where unfertilized eggs develop into embryos that produce female offspring. Poecilia formosa mate with males of other fish species that use internal fertilization, the sperm does not fertilize the eggs but stimulates the growth of the eggs which develops into embryos. =Reptiles= Common House Geckos mating, ventral view with hemipenis inserted in the cloaca =AmphibiansMollusks=Plants Animals have life cycles with a single diploid multicellular phase that produces haploid gametes directly by meiosis. Male gametes are called sperm, and female gametes are called eggs or ova. In animals, fertilization of the ovum by a sperm results in the formation of a diploid zygote that develops by repeated mitotic divisions into a diploid adult. Plants have two multicellular life-cycle phases, resulting in an alternation of generations. Plant zygotes germinate and divide repeatedly by mitosis to produce a diploid multicellular organism known as the sporophyte. The mature sporophyte produces haploid spores by meiosis that germinate and divide by mitosis to form a multicellular gametophyte phase that produces gametes at maturity. The gametophytes of different groups of plants vary in size. Mosses and other pteridophytic plants may have gametophytes consisting of several million cells, while angiosperms have as few as three cells in each pollen grain. =Flowering plants= Flowers are the sexual organs of flowering plants. Flowering plants are the dominant plant form on land and they reproduce either sexually or asexually. Often their most distinguishing feature is their reproductive organs, commonly called flowers. The anther produces pollen grains which contain the male gametophytes that produce sperm nuclei. For pollination to occur, pollen grains must attach to the stigma of the female reproductive structure (carpel), where the female gametophytes (ovules) are located inside the ovary. After the pollen tube grows through the carpel's style, the sex cell nuclei from the pollen grain migrate into the ovule to fertilize the egg cell and endosperm nuclei within the female gametophyte in a process termed double fertilization. The resulting zygote develops into an embryo, while the triploid endosperm (one sperm cell plus two female cells) and female tissues of the ovule give rise to the surrounding tissues in the developing seed. The ovary, which produced the female gametophyte(s), then grows into a fruit, which surrounds the seed(s). Plants may either self-pollinate or cross- pollinate. In 2013, flowers dating from the Cretaceous (100 million years before present) were found encased in amber, the oldest evidence of sexual reproduction in a flowering plant. Microscopic images showed tubes growing out of pollen and penetrating the flower's stigma. The pollen was sticky, suggesting it was carried by insects. Nonflowering plants like ferns, moss and liverworts use other means of sexual reproduction. =Ferns= Ferns mostly produce large diploid sporophytes with rhizomes, roots and leaves. Fertile leaves produce sporangia that contain haploid spores. The spores are released and germinate to produce short, thin gametophytes that are typically heart shaped, small and green in color. The gametophyte thalli, produce both motile sperm in the antheridia and egg cells in archegonia on the same or different plants. After rains or when dew deposits a film of water, the motile sperm are splashed away from the antheridia, which are normally produced on the top side of the thallus, and swim in the film of water to the archegonia where they fertilize the egg. To promote out crossing or cross fertilization the sperm are released before the eggs are receptive of the sperm, making it more likely that the sperm will fertilize the eggs of different thallus. After fertilization, a zygote is formed which grows into a new sporophytic plant. The condition of having separate sporophyte and gametophyte plants is called alternation of generations. Other plants with similar life cycles include Psilotum, Lycopodium, Selaginella and Equisetum. =Bryophytes= The bryophytes, which include liverworts, hornworts and mosses, reproduce both sexually and vegetatively. They are small plants found growing in moist locations and like ferns, have motile sperm with flagella and need water to facilitate sexual reproduction. These plants start as a haploid spore that grows into the dominant gametophyte form, which is a multicellular haploid body with leaf-like structures that photosynthesize. Haploid gametes are produced in antheridia (male) and archegonia (female) by mitosis. The sperm released from the antheridia respond to chemicals released by ripe archegonia and swim to them in a film of water and fertilize the egg cells thus producing a zygote. The zygote divides by mitotic division and grows into a multicellular, diploid sporophyte. The sporophyte produces spore capsules (sporangia), which are connected by stalks (setae) to the archegonia. The spore capsules produce spores by meiosis and when ripe the capsules burst open to release the spores. Bryophytes show considerable variation in their reproductive structures and the above is a basic outline. Also in some species each plant is one sex (dioicous) while other species produce both sexes on the same plant (monoicous). Fungi Puffballs emitting spores Fungi are classified by the methods of sexual reproduction they employ. The outcome of sexual reproduction most often is the production of resting spores that are used to survive inclement times and to spread. There are typically three phases in the sexual reproduction of fungi: plasmogamy, karyogamy and meiosis. The cytoplasm of two parent cells fuse during plasmogamy and the nuclei fuse during karyogamy. New haploid gametes are formed during meiosis and develop into spores. The adaptive basis for the maintenance of sexual reproduction in the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota (dikaryon) fungi was reviewed by Wallen and Perlin. They concluded that the most plausible reason for maintaining this capability is the benefit of repairing DNA damage, caused by a variety of stresses, through recombination that occurs during meiosis. Bacteria and archaea Three distinct processes in prokaryotes are regarded as similar to eukaryotic sex: bacterial transformation, which involves the incorporation of foreign DNA into the bacterial chromosome; bacterial conjugation, which is a transfer of plasmid DNA between bacteria, but the plasmids are rarely incorporated into the bacterial chromosome; and gene transfer and genetic exchange in archaea. Bacterial transformation involves the recombination of genetic material and its function is mainly associated with DNA repair. Bacterial transformation is a complex process encoded by numerous bacterial genes, and is a bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer. This process occurs naturally in at least 40 bacterial species. For a bacterium to bind, take up, and recombine exogenous DNA into its chromosome, it must enter a special physiological state referred to as competence (see Natural competence). Sexual reproduction in early single-celled eukaryotes may have evolved from bacterial transformation,Bernstein H, Bernstein C, Michod RE. (2012) \\"DNA Repair as the Primary Adaptive Function of Sex in Bacteria and Eukaryotes\\". Chapter 1, pp. 1‚Äì50, in DNA Repair: New Research, Editors S. Kimura and Shimizu S. Nova Sci. Publ., Hauppauge, New York. Open access for reading only. or from a similar process in archaea (see below). On the other hand, bacterial conjugation is a type of direct transfer of DNA between two bacteria mediated by an external appendage called the conjugation pilus. Bacterial conjugation is controlled by plasmid genes that are adapted for spreading copies of the plasmid between bacteria. The infrequent integration of a plasmid into a host bacterial chromosome, and the subsequent transfer of a part of the host chromosome to another cell do not appear to be bacterial adaptations. Exposure of hyperthermophilic archaeal Sulfolobus species to DNA damaging conditions induces cellular aggregation accompanied by high frequency genetic marker exchange. Ajon et al. hypothesized that this cellular aggregation enhances species-specific DNA repair by homologous recombination. DNA transfer in Sulfolobus may be an early form of sexual interaction similar to the more well-studied bacterial transformation systems that also involve species- specific DNA transfer leading to homologous recombinational repair of DNA damage.

Kowalski wrestled for numerous promotions during his career, including the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF, now WWE), and was a known villain professional wrestler. He held numerous championships including the WWWF World Tag Team Championship with Big John Studd billed as The Executioners and managed by Lou Albano. After retiring in 1977, Kowalski started a professional wrestling school in Malden, Massachusetts and trained many professional wrestlers, including Studd, Triple H, Chyna, Eddie Edwards, Kofi Kingston, Damien Sandow, Fandango, Brittany Brown, April Hunter, John Kronus, Perry Saturn, and Tommaso Ciampa. In the 1960s, Kowalski claimed to be the only vegetarian professional wrestler. Early life Born Edward W≈Çadys≈Çaw Spulnik, Kowalski was the son of Polish immigrants Antoni Spulnik and Maria Borowska; he, his older sister Wanda, and his younger brother Stanley were born and raised in Windsor, Ontario. Years later, he told interviewers that he never expected to be a wrestler - by the age of 14, he was already , and because he was thin for his height, he began working out at the local YMCA, but had no plan to go into athletics at that time. When he entered college, his major was electrical engineering. He worked part-time at the Ford plant in Detroit to help pay his way. Professional wrestling career There are several stories of how he became a wrestler. The most common one is that while attending the University of Detroit (some sources say Assumption College in Windsor), he heard that there was an opportunity to make good pay by wrestling. He was only being paid $50 a week at the Ford plant and was told he could make more as a wrestler. Since he already had an athletic build, he decided to give wrestling a try and began attending a wrestling school. When he first wrestled professionally, he was known as Tarzan Kowalski, but was also called Hercules Kowalski, Killer Kowalski (this nickname is used as early as 1950) and even The Polish Apollo, according to newspaper reports from 1950‚Äì51. During the Cold War his name was changed to Wladek Kowalski, which was supposed to sound more menacing. Kowalski wrestled from 1947 to 1977 in a number of organizations, including the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and American Wrestling Association (AWA) as a heel. Kowalski's rise in the business came quickly. His first recorded match occurred on May 6, 1948, and by November 29 of the same year, Kowalski was facing NWA champion Orville Brown in a heavyweight championship match. Kowalski stood out in his era for his larger-than-normal size, and for a faster-paced style in the ring. He wrestled as a demonstrative \\"heel,\\" or villain, except when facing the even-more-hated Buddy Rogers. In his matches with Rogers, Kowalski would adopt a more serious \\"babyface\\" approach. Out of the ring, however, Kowalski was considered so friendly and polite that some wrestling promoters complained about the way he would \\"drop character\\" in public. =Incidents= On October 15, 1952, in a match in Montreal versus Yukon Eric, Kowalski ripped off a part of Yukon Eric's ear while performing a knee drop. In reality, Eric's ears were already badly cauliflowered due to years of abuse and the injury was an accident, but it fortified Kowalski as being a ruthless villain who gleefully maims his opponents. Kowalski attempted to visit his opponent in the hospital and began laughing along with Eric at how silly the bandages looked, with Kowalski recalling years later, \\"I swear, the first thing I thought of was Humpty Dumpty on the wall. Yukon Eric looked at me, shook his head, and smiled. I started laughing and he laughed, too.\\" When the incident was reported in the paper the next day, it stated that Kowalski showed up at the hospital and laughed at his victim rather than with him, furthering Kowalski's image as a heel. The incident sparked a long- running series of grudge matches between the two wrestlers which took place throughout North America. By the time the feud had run out of steam several years later, Yukon Eric joked to Kowalski about the small size of an audience, \\"God, that's a lousy house. I might have to sacrifice another ear.\\" Kowalski also gained some notoriety in Boston for an incident in late June 1958 when he was wrestling Pat O'Connor. The guest referee was former boxing great Jack Dempsey, who suffered a kick to the diaphragm and had to be hospitalized. Dempsey did not blame Kowalski, and both said it was an accident, but this further cemented the Killer's reputation as a villain. In 1967, the top-rated Australian television talk show host Don Lane irritated Kowalski during an apparently friendly interview and was attacked with the Kowalski claw hold. Also in the late 1950s, Kowalski fought what was supposed to be a best two out of three match in Fall River, Massachusetts against Mr. Moto. Just before the bell starting the first fall, Kowalski had his back turned to Moto while doing some stretches in his corner. Moto raced across the ring and hit Kowalski over the head with one of the clogs with which he had walked into the ring. Of course, the referee did not see this happen. The bell rang and a seemingly dazed Kowalski staggered around the ring and was quickly pinned by Moto. Kowalski was billed as the heavyweight champion at that time (at least in eastern Massachusetts) and, as such, was not supposed to lose the match. Just after the second fall started, Kowalski was hit in the right eye with a pea or bean shot by someone in the audience using a pea shooter. Semi-blinded and genuinely stunned, Kowalski staggered around the ring covering his eye with his right hand. Moto did not know what to do. Finally, he approached Kowalski, bumped into him and fell to the mat. Kowalski reached down, applied the claw hold and Moto was not only counted out, but deemed by the referee too hurt to continue. The two raced out of the ring to a chorus of boos from the audience and dodged various objects being thrown at them. As a side note, the two had arrived 45 minutes late for the match. The Fall River Herald News reported in its next day morning edition that these two \\"mortal enemies\\" were late because the car in which they had ridden together to the match had broken down on the way. In December 1972, Kowalski became the first wrestler to pin Andr√© the Giant in North America, in what was billed as a \\"Battle of the Giants.\\" Photographs from the Quebec City match helped to establish Andr√©'s reputation in American wrestling magazines, since they showed him towering over the better-known Kowalski. Kowalski had done much the same to boost Giant Baba's fame in Japan, with a televised 1963 match. =World Wide Wrestling Federation= Kowalski became the main antagonist of Bruno Sammartino in the World Wide Wrestling Federation in the 1960s and 1970s. Kowalski formed a tag team with fellow heel Gorilla Monsoon and took Red Berry as his manager; Monsoon and Kowalski held the WWWF United States Tag Team Championship, winning the belts in two straight falls from Skull Murphy and Brute Bernard on Washington, D.C. television, and later losing to The Tolos Brothers in two straight falls in Teaneck, New Jersey in December 1963. On May 11, 1976, Kowalski won the WWF World Tag Team Championship with Big John Studd. Both men wore black masks and tights and called themselves \\"The Executioners\\". However, they were stripped of the championship, following the interference of a third Executioner during a title defense against Chief Jay Strongbow and Billy White Wolf. The Executioners lost a match for the vacant title on December 6 to Strongbow and White Wolf and never regained the championship. =Retirement and training= John Quinlan and The Boston Brawler in 2000 After his WWF retirement in 1977, Kowalski started a professional wrestling school in Malden, Massachusetts. Due to his health, he ceased to be involved with it in 2003, and the school subsequently moved to North Andover, Massachusetts. Among the alumni of this school are Triple H, Chyna, Perry Saturn, John Kronus, Brittany Brown, Big John Studd, Damien Kane, Killer Kowalski Jr., Ron Zombie, Christopher Nowinski, Matt Bloom, April Hunter, Ace Andrews, RJ Brewer, Kazarian, Nicole Raczynski, Cadillac Joe D, Kenny Dykstra, Tommaso Ciampa, Damien Sandow and Fandango. Kowalski returned to wrestling on independent shows in 1982, and worked only sparingly after that. His last match took place in 1993, when Kowalski was 66 years old. Kowalski would remain a fixture on the Northeast independent wrestling scene taking autograph and personal appearances. His last appearance was on March 14, 2008 for Top Rope Promotions at an event in North Adams, Mass., where he came to the ring and put the claw on local wrestler \\"Gorgeous\\" Gino Giovanni and was declared the winner of the segment. He also made numerous post-retirement television appearances, including Late Night with David Letterman in 1982, and was featured in a comic role in Michael Burlingame's surrealist film To a Random in 1986. \\"Lost in the B-Zone\\", a music video for Birdsongs of the Mesozoic which was derived from this film, also prominently featured Kowalski. On June 14, 2007, Kowalski was inducted into The National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame.http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070411/UPDATE/704110454 Personal life Kowalski married Theresa Ferrioli on June 19, 2006. He became a vegetarian after being influenced by middle-distance runners Roger Bannister and John Landy in 1953.\\"Vegetarian Travel Guide exclusive interview with the world-famous wrestler...

The Sun received the report on Kowalski from his friend, wrestling legend Bruno Sammartino, that Kowalski had to go to a rehabilitation center in Everett, Massachusetts, where he was recovering from a knee injury. It seemed he was getting better, until he suffered a heart attack on August 8, 2008. According to Slam! Sports, the Quincy Patriot Ledger, and other sources, Kowalski's family was apprised that he would not recover. When Kowalski was taken off life support on August 18, subsequent news reports erroneously stated that he had died. Kowalski died on August 30, 2008. He was survived by his wife and family.

In scholarly studies, nativism is a standard technical term, although those who hold this political view do not typically accept the label. Oezguer Dindar wrote, [...] do not consider themselves [to be] nativists. For them it is a negative term and they rather consider themselves as 'Patriots'.  Arguments presented for immigration restriction  According to Joel S. Fetzer, opposition to immigration commonly arises in many countries because of issues of national, cultural, and religious identity. The phenomenon has been studied especially in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as in continental Europe. Thus nativism has become a general term for opposition to immigration based on fears that immigrants will \\"distort or spoil\\" existing cultural values.

Housing: Immigrants reduce vacancies, causing rent increases. *Cultural  Language: Immigrants isolate themselves in their own communities and refuse to learn the local language.  Culture: Immigrants will outnumber the native population and replace its culture with theirs.  Patriotism: Immigrants damage a nation's sense of community based on ethnicity and nationality. *Environmental  Environment: Immigrants increase the consumption of limited resources.  Overpopulation: Immigration contributes to overpopulation. Examples by country and region=Australia= Many Australians opposed the influx of Chinese immigrants at time of the nineteenth-century gold rushes. When the separate Australian colonies formed the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901, the new nation adopted \\"White Australia\\" as one of its founding principles. Under the White Australia policy, entry of Chinese and other Asians remained controversial until well after World War II, although the country remained home to many long-established Chinese families dating from before the adoption of White Australia. By contrast, most Pacific Islanders were deported soon after the policy was adopted, while the remainder were forced out of the canefields where they had worked for decades.After 1905, 4000 \\"Kanakas\\" were repatriated and the remaining 2500 were pushed out of the canefields by labour unions.

The country encouraged European immigration, but non-white immigration always faced considerable backlash. On July 28, 1921, representatives Andrade Bezerra and Cincinato Braga proposed a law whose Article 1 provided: \\"The immigration of individuals from the black race to Brazil is prohibited.\\" On October 22, 1923, representative Fid√©lis Reis produced another bill on the entry of immigrants, whose fifth article was as follows: \\"The entry of settlers from the black race into Brazil is prohibited. For Asian [immigrants] there will be allowed each year a number equal to 5% of those residing in the country.(...)\\".RIOS, Roger Raupp. Text excerpted from a judicial sentence concerning crime of racism. Federal Justice of 10¬™ Vara da Circunscri√ß√£o Judici√°ria de Porto Alegre, November 16, 2001 (Accessed September 10, 2008) In the 19th and 20th centuries, there were negative feelings toward the communities of German, Italian, Japanese, and Jewish immigrants, who conserved their language and culture instead of adopting Portuguese and Brazilian habit (so that nowadays Brazil has the most number of communities in the Americas of speakers of Venetian and second-most of German), were seen as particularly tendentious to form ghettos, had high rates of endogamy (in Brazil, it is regarded as usual for people of different backgrounds to miscegenate), among other concerns. It affected more harshly the Japanese, because they were Asian, and thus seen as an obstacle of the whitening of Brazil. Oliveira Viana, a Brazilian jurist, historian and sociologist described the Japanese immigrants as follows: \\"They (Japanese) are like sulfur: insoluble\\". The Brazilian magazine \\"O Malho\\" in its edition of December 5, 1908 issued a charge of Japanese immigrants with the following legend: \\"The government of S√£o Paulo is stubborn. After the failure of the first Japanese immigration, it contracted 3,000 yellow people. It insists on giving Brazil a race diametrically opposite to ours\\".SUZUKI Jr, Matinas. Hist√≥ria da discrimina√ß√£o brasileira contra os japoneses sai do limbo in Folha de S.Paulo, 20 de abril de 2008 (visitado em 17 de agosto de 2008) In 1941, the Brazilian minister of justice, Francisco Campos, defended the ban on admission of 400 Japanese immigrants in S√£o Paulo and wrote: \\"their despicable standard of living is a brutal competition with the country's worker; their selfishness, their bad faith, their refractory character, make them a huge ethnic and cultural cyst located in the richest regions of Brazil\\". Some years before World War II, the government of President Get√∫lio Vargas initiated a process of forced assimilation of people of immigrant origin in Brazil. The Constitution of 1934 had a legal provision about the subject: \\"The concentration of immigrants anywhere in the country is prohibited; the law should govern the selection, location and assimilation of the alien\\". The assimilationist project affected mainly German, Italian, Japanese and Jewish immigrants and their descendants. During World War II they were seen as more loyal to their countries of origin than to Brazil. In fact, there were violent revolts in the Japanese community of the states of S√£o Paulo and Paran√° when Emperor Hirohito declared that Japan surrendered and he was not a deity, which was thought as a conspiracy trying to hurt Japanese honour and strength. Nevertheless, it followed hostility from the government. The Japanese Brazilian community was strongly marked by restrictive measures when Brazil declared war against Japan in August 1942. Japanese Brazilians could not travel the country without safe conduct issued by the police; over 200 Japanese schools were closed and radio equipment was seized to prevent transmissions on short wave from Japan. The goods of Japanese companies were confiscated and several companies of Japanese origin had interventions, including the newly founded Banco Am√©rica do Sul. Japanese Brazilians were prohibited from driving motor vehicles (even if they were taxi drivers), buses or trucks on their property. The drivers employed by Japanese had to have permission from the police. Thousands of Japanese immigrants were arrested or expelled from Brazil on suspicion of espionage. There were many anonymous denunciations because of \\"activities against national security\\" arising from disagreements between neighbours, recovery of debts and even fights between children. Japanese Brazilians were arrested for \\"suspicious activity\\" when they were in artistic meetings or picnics. On July 10, 1943, approximately 10,000 Japanese and German immigrants who lived in Santos had 24 hours to close their homes and businesses and move away from the Brazilian coast. The police acted without any notice. About 90% of people displaced were Japanese. To reside in Baixada Santista, the Japanese had to have a safe conduct. In 1942, the Japanese community who introduced the cultivation of pepper in Tom√©- A√ßu, in Par√°, was virtually turned into a \\"concentration camp\\" (expression of the time) from which no Japanese could leave. This time, the Brazilian ambassador in Washington, D.C., Carlos Martins Pereira e Sousa, encouraged the government of Brazil to transfer all the Japanese Brazilians to \\"internment camps\\" without the need for legal support, in the same manner as was done with the Japanese residents in the United States. No single suspicion of activities of Japanese against \\"national security\\" was confirmed. Nowadays, nativism in Brazil affects primarily migrants from elsewhere in the Third World, such as the new wave of Levantine Arabs (this time, mostly Muslims from Palestine instead of overwhelmingly Christian from Syria and Lebanon), South and East Asians (primarily Mainland Chinese), Spanish-speakers and Amerindians from neighbouring South American countries and, especially, West Africans and Haitians. Following the 2010 Haiti earthquake and considerable illegal immigration to northern Brazil and S√£o Paulo, Carta Maior ‚Äì International News Section ‚Äì Brazil, hope for Haitian illegal immigrants a subsequent debate in the population was concerned with the reasons why Brazil has such lax laws and enforcement concerning illegal immigration. According to the 1988's Brazilian Constitution, it is an unbailable crime to address someone in an offensive racist way, and it is illegal to discriminate against someone on the basis of his or her race, skin colour, national or regional origin or nationality, thus nativism and opposition to multiculturalism would be too much of a polemic and delicate topic to be openly discussed as a basic ideology of even the most right-leaning modern political parties. =Canada= Nativism was common in Canada (though the term originated in the U.S.). It took several forms. Hostility to the Chinese and other Asians was intense, and involved provincial laws that hindered immigration of Chinese and Japanese and blocked their economic mobility. In 1942 Japanese Canadians were forced into detention camps in response to Japanese aggression in World War II.W. Peter Ward, White Canada Forever: Popular Attitudes and Public Policy toward Orientals in British Columbia (1978); Roger Daniels, Concentration Camps North America: Japanese in the United States and Canada During World War II (1993); Throughout the 19th century, well into the 20th, the Orange Order in Canada attacked and tried to politically defeat the Irish Catholics.Cecil J. Houston and William J. Smyth, The Sash Canada Wore: A Historical Geography of the Orange Order in Canada (1980); The Ku Klux Klan spread in the mid-1920s from the U.S. to parts of Canada, especially Saskatchewan, where it helped topple the Liberal government. The Klan creed was, historian Martin Robin argues, in the mainstream of Protestant Canadian sentiment, for it was based on \\"Protestantism, separation of Church and State, pure patriotism, restrictive and selective immigration, one national public school, one flag and one language‚ÄîEnglish.\\"Martin Robin, Shades of Right: Nativist and Fascist Politics in Canada, 1920‚Äì1940 (1991), quote on pp. 23‚Äì24. Robin p 86, notes the Klan in Canada was not violent. In World War I, Canadian naturalized citizens of German or Austrian origins were stripped of their right to vote, and tens of thousands of Ukrainians (who were born in the Austro-Hungarian Empire) were rounded up and put in internment camps.Frances Swyripa and John Herd Thompson, eds. Loyalties in Conflict: Ukrainians in Canada During the Great War (1983); and Bohdan Kordan, Enemy Aliens, Prisoners of War: Internment in Canada During the Great War (2002) Hostility of native-born Canadians to competition from English immigrants in the early 20th century was expressed in signs that read, \\"No English Need Apply!\\" The resentment came because the immigrants identified more with England than with Canada.Ross McCormack, \\"Cloth Caps and Jobs: The Ethnicity of English Immigrants in Canada, 1900‚Äì1914,\\" in Jorgan Dahlie and Tissa Fernando, eds. Ethnicity, Power, and Politics in Canada (1981); Susan Jackel, A Flannel Shirt and Liberty: British Emigrant Gentlewomen in the Canadian West, 1880‚Äì1914 (1982) p. xx; Basil Stewart, \\"No English Need Apply\\": Or, Canada as a Field for the Emigrant (1909) In the British Empire, traditions of anti-Catholicism in Britain led to fears that Catholics were a threat to the national (British) values. In Canada, the Orange Order (of Irish Protestants) campaigned vigorously against the Catholics throughout the 19th century, often with violent confrontations. Both sides were immigrants from Ireland and neither side claimed loyalty to Canada.Robert McLaughlin, \\"Irish Nationalism and Orange Unionism in Canada: A Reappraisal,\\" √âire-Ireland 41.3&4 (2007) 80‚Äì109; Cecil J. Houston and William J. Smyth, The Sash Canada Wore: A Historical Geography of the Orange Order in Canada (1980) The Orange Order was much less influential in the U.S., especially after a major riot in New York City in 1871. =Hong Kong= Nativism in Hong Kong, which is often used as a synonymy with localism, strives for the autonomy of Hong Kong and resists the influence in the city of Chinese authorities. In addition to their strong anti-communist and pro-democracy tendency, nativists often hold strong anti- mainland and anti-Mandarin sentiments, especially opposing the influx of the mainland tourists and Mandarin-speaking immigrants, seeing them as a threat to Hong Kong's Cantonese culture and identity. =European countries= For the Poles in the mining districts of western Germany before 1914, nationalism (on both the German and the Polish sides) kept Polish workers, who had established an associational structure approaching institutional completeness (churches, voluntary associations, press, even unions), separate from the host German society. Lucassen found that religiosity and nationalism were more fundamental in generating nativism and inter-group hostility than the labor antagonism. Once Italian workers in France had understood the benefit of unionism and French unions were willing to overcome their fear of Italians as strikebreakers, integration was open for most Italian immigrants. The French state, which was always more of an immigration state than Prussia and the other German states or Great Britain, fostered and supported family-based immigration and thus helped Italians on their immigration trajectory with minimal nativism.Lucassen 2005 Many observers see the post-1950s wave of immigration in Europe was fundamentally different from the pre-1914 patterns. They debate the role of cultural differences, ghettos, race, Muslim fundamentalism, poor education and poverty play in creating nativism among the hosts and a caste-type underclass, more similar to white-black tensions in the US. Algerian migration to France has generated nativism, characterized by the prominence of Jean-Marie Le Pen and his National Front. =Pakistan= The Pakistani province of Sindh has seen nativist movements, promoting control for the Sindhi people over their homeland. After the 1947 Partition of India, large numbers of Muhajir people migrating from India entered the province, becoming a majority in the provincial capital city of Karachi, which formerly had an ethnically Sindhi majority. Sindhis have also voiced opposition to the promotion of Urdu, as opposed to their native tongue, Sindhi. These nativist movements are expressed through Sindhi nationalism and the Sindhudesh separatist movement. Nativist and nationalist sentiments increased greatly after the independence of Bangladesh from Pakistan in 1971. =Taiwan= After the Chinese Civil War, Taiwan became a sanctuary for Chinese nationalists who fled from communists who followed a Western ideology. =United Kingdom= London was notorious for its xenophobia in the 16th century, and conditions worsened in the 1580s. Many immigrants became disillusioned by routine threats of violence and molestation, attempts at expulsion of foreigners, and the great difficulty in acquiring English citizenship. Dutch cities proved more hospitable, and many left London permanently.Bich Luu Lien, \\"Taking the Bread Out of Our Mouths\\": Xenophobia in Early Modern London,\\" Immigrants and Minorities, July 2000, Vol. 19 Issue 2, pp. 1‚Äì22 Regarding the Irish in 20th- century Great Britain, Lucassen argues that the deep religious divide between the Protestants and Catholics was at the core of the ongoing estrangement of the Irish in British society. =United States=Early Republic Nativism was a political factor in the 1790s and in the 1830s‚Äì1850s. There was little nativism in the colonial era, but for a while Benjamin Franklin was hostile to German Americans in colonial Pennsylvania; He called them \\"Palatine Boors.\\" However, he reversed himself and became a supporter.John B. Frantz, \\"Franklin and the Pennsylvania Germans,\\" Pennsylvania History, 65#1 (1998), 21‚Äì34 online Nativism became a major issue in the late 1790s, when the Federalist Party expressed its strong opposition to the French Revolution by trying to strictly limit immigration, and stretching the time to 14 years for citizenship. At the time of the Quasi-War with France in 1798, the Federalists and Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts, including the Alien Act, the Naturalization Act and the Sedition Act. The movement was led by Alexander Hamilton, despite his own status as an immigrant from a small Caribbean island. Phillip Magness argues that ‚ÄúHamilton‚Äôs political career might legitimately be characterized as a sustained drift into nationalistic xenophobia.‚ÄùPhillip Magness, \\"Alexander Hamilton as Immigrant Musical Mythology Meets Federalist Reality\\", The Independent Review 21#4 (2017) pp 497-508, quote on p 500. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison fought by drafting the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions. The two laws against aliens were motivated by fears of a growing Irish radical presence in Philadelphia, where they supported Jefferson.Douglas M. Bradburn, \\"'True Americans' and 'Hordes of Foreigners': Nationalism, Ethnicity and the Problem of Citizenship in the United States, 1789-1800.\\" Historical Reflections/R√©flexions Historiques (2003): 19-41. online However, they were not actually enforced.James Morton Smith,\\"The Enforcement of the Alien Friends Act of 1798.\\" Mississippi Valley Historical Review 41.1 (1954): 85-104. online President John Adams annoyed his fellow Federalists by making peace with France, and splitting his party in 1800. Jefferson was elected president, and reversed most of the hostile legislation.Douglas Bradburn, \\"A clamor in the public mind: Opposition to the Alien and Sedition Acts.\\" William and Mary Quarterly 65.3 (2008): 565-600. online 1830‚Äì1860 The term \\"nativism\\" was first used by 1844: \\"Thousands were Naturalized expressly to oppose Nativism, and voted the Polk ticket mainly to that end.\\"Oxford English Dictionary (under \\"Nativism\\"), citing Whig Almanac 1845 4/2. Nativism gained its name from the \\"Native American\\" parties of the 1840s and 1850s. In this context \\"Native\\" does not mean indigenous Americans or American Indians but rather those descended from the inhabitants of the original Thirteen Colonies. It impacted politics in the mid-19th century because of the large inflows of immigrants after 1845 from cultures that were different from the existing American culture. Nativists objected primarily to Irish Roman Catholics because of their loyalty to the Pope and also because of their supposed rejection of republicanism as an American ideal.Ray A. Billington, The Protestant Crusade, 1800‚Äì1860: A Study of the Origins of American Nativism (1938) Nativist movements included the Know Nothing or American Party of the 1850s, the Immigration Restriction League of the 1890s, the anti-Asian movements in the West, resulting in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the \\"Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907\\" by which Japan's government stopped emigration to the United States. Labor unions were strong supporters of Chinese exclusion and limits on immigration, because of fears that they would lower wages and make it harder for workers to organize unions.Tyler Anbinder, Nativism and Slavery: The Northern Know Nothings and the politics of the 1850s (1992). Historian Eric Kaufmann has suggested that American nativism has been explained primarily in psychological and economic terms due to the neglect of a crucial cultural and ethnic dimension. Furthermore, Kauffman claims that American nativism cannot be understood without reference to an American ethnic group which took shape prior to the large-scale immigration of the mid-eighteenth century. Guardians of Liberty, 1943, by Bishop Alma White Nativist outbursts occurred in the Northeast from the 1830s to the 1850s, primarily in response to a surge of Irish Catholic immigration. In 1836, Samuel Morse ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of New York City on a Nativist ticket, receiving 1,496 votes. In New York City, an Order of United Americans was founded as a nativist fraternity, following the Philadelphia Nativist Riots of the preceding spring and summer, in December, 1844.Billington, The Protestant Crusade, 1800‚Äì1860 The Nativists went public in 1854 when they formed the 'American Party', which was especially hostile to the immigration of Irish Catholics and campaigned for laws to require longer wait time between immigration and naturalization. (The laws never passed.) It was at this time that the term \\"nativist\\" first appears, opponents denounced them as \\"bigoted nativists.\\" Former President Millard Fillmore ran on the American Party ticket for the Presidency in 1856. The American Party also included many ex-Whigs who ignored nativism, and included (in the South) a few Catholics whose families had long lived in America. Conversely, much of the opposition to Catholics came from Protestant Irish immigrants and German Lutheran immigrants who were not native at all and can hardly be called \\"nativists.\\"Anbinder, Nativism and Slavery: The Northern Know Nothings and the politics of the 1850s This form of nationalism is often identified with xenophobia and anti-Catholic sentiment (anti-Papism). In Charlestown, Massachusetts, a nativist mob attacked and burned down a Catholic convent in 1834 (no one was injured). In the 1840s, small scale riots between Catholics and nativists took place in several American cities. In Philadelphia in 1844, for example, a series of nativist assaults on Catholic churches and community centers resulted in the loss of lives and the professionalization of the police force. In Louisville, Kentucky, election-day rioters killed at least 22 people in attacks on German and Irish Catholics on Aug. 6, 1855, in what became known as \\"Bloody Monday.\\"Smith, Peter. \\"Recalling Bloody Monday; Events to mark 1855 anti-immigrant riots in city,\\" The Courier-Journal, Louisville, Ky. (July 30, 2005); Crews, Clyde: An American Holy Land: A History of the Archdiocese of Louisville (1990). The new Republican Party kept its nativist element quiet during the 1860s, since immigrants were urgently needed for the Union Army. Immigrants from England, Scotland and Scandinavia favored the Republicans during the Third Party System, 1854-1896, while others were usually Democratic. Hostility toward Asians was very strong from the 1860s to the 1940s. Nativism experienced a revival in the 1890s, led by Protestant Irish immigrants hostile to Catholic immigration, especially the American Protective Association.Donald L. Kinzer, Episode in Anti-Catholicism: The American Protective Association (1964) Anti-German nativism From the 1840s to 1920 German Americans were distrusted because of their separatist social structure, their German-language schools, their attachment to their native tongue over English, and their neutrality during World War I. The Bennett Law caused a political uproar in Wisconsin in 1890, as the state government passed a law that threatened to close down hundreds of German- language elementary schools. Catholic and Lutheran Germans rallied to defeat Governor William D. Hoard. Hoard attacked German American culture and religion: :\\"We must fight alienism and selfish ecclesiasticism.... The parents, the pastors and the church have entered into a conspiracy to darken the understanding of the children, who are denied by cupidity and bigotry the privilege of even the free schools of the state.\\"Quoted on p. 388 of William Foote Whyte, \\"The Bennett Law Campaign in Wisconsin,\\" Wisconsin Magazine Of History, 10: 4 (1926‚Äì1927), p. 388 Hoard, a Republican, was defeated by the Democrats. A similar campaign in Illinois regarding the \\"Edwards Law\\" led to a Republican defeat there in 1890. In 1917‚Äì1918, a wave of nativist sentiment due to American entry into World War I led to the suppression of German cultural activities in the United States, Canada, and Australia. There was little violence, but many places and streets had their names changed (The city of \\"Berlin\\" in Ontario was renamed \\"Kitchener\\" after a British hero), churches switched to English for their services, and German Americans were forced to buy war bonds to show their patriotism.Frederick C. Luebke, Bonds of Loyalty: German-Americans and World War I (1974); Terrence G. Wiley, \\"The Imposition of World War I Era English-Only Policies and the Fate of German in North America,\\" in Barbara Burnaby and Thomas K. Ricento, eds.

Kazal, Becoming Old Stock: The Paradox of German-American Identity (2004) In Australia thousands of Germans were put into internment camps.Stuart Macintyre, The Oxford History of Australia: vol. 4, The Succeeding Age, 1901‚Äì1942 (1993), pp. 153‚Äì55; Jurgen Tampke, The Germans in Australia (2007) pp. 120‚Äì24. (See also: World War I Anti-German Sentiment) Anti-Chinese nativism In the 1870s and 1880s in the western states, ethnic whites, especially Irish Americans and German Americans, targeted violence against Chinese workers, driving them out of smaller towns. Denis Kearney, an immigrant from Ireland, led a mass movement in San Francisco in the 1870s that incited attacks on the Chinese there and threatened public officials and railroad owners. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was the first of many nativist acts of Congress which attempted to limit the flow of immigrants into the U.S.. The Chinese responded to it by filing false claims of American birth, enabling thousands of them to immigrate to California.Erika Lee, At America's Gates: Chinese Immigration during the Exclusion Era, 1882‚Äì1943 (2003) The exclusion of the Chinese caused the western railroads to begin importing Mexican railroad workers in greater numbers (\\"traqueros\\").Jeffrey Marcos Garcilazo, \`Traqueros': Mexican Railroad Workers in the United States, 1870 to 1930. PhD U. of California, Santa Barbara 1995. 374 pp. DAI 1996 56(8): 3277‚Äì78-A. DA9542027 Fulltext: online at ProQuest Dissertations & Theses 20th century In the 1890s‚Äì1920s era, nativists and labor unions campaigned for immigration restriction following the waves of workers and families from southern and eastern Europe, including Italy, the Balkans, Poland, Austria-Hungary, and Russia. A favorite plan was the literacy test to exclude workers who could not read or write their own foreign language. Congress passed literacy tests, but presidents‚Äîresponding to business needs for workers‚Äîvetoed them. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge argued need for literacy tests and its implication on the new immigrants: :It is found, in the first place, that the illiteracy test will bear most heavily upon the Italians, Russians, Poles, Hungarians, Greeks, and Asiatics, and lightly, or not at all, upon English-speaking emigrants, or Germans, Scandinavians, and French. In other words, the races most affected by the illiteracy test are those whose emigration to this country has begun within the last twenty years and swelled rapidly to enormous proportions, races with which the English speaking people have never hitherto assimilated, and who are most alien to the great body of the people of the United States. Responding to these demands, opponents of the literacy test called for the establishment of an immigration commission to focus on immigration as a whole. The United States Immigration Commission, also known as the Dillingham Commission, was created and tasked with studying immigration and its effect on the United States. The findings of the commission further influenced immigration policy and upheld the concerns of the nativist movement. Following World War I, nativists in the twenties focused their attention on southern and eastern Europeans due to their Catholic and Jewish faith, and realigned their beliefs behind racial and religious nativism. The racial concern of the anti-immigration movement was linked closely to the eugenics movement that was sweeping the United States in the twenties. Led by Madison Grant's book, The Passing of the Great Race nativists grew more concerned with the racial purity of the United States. In his book, Grant argued that the American racial stock was being diluted by the influx of new immigrants from the Mediterranean, the Balkans, and the ghettos. The Passing of the Great Race reached wide popularity among Americans and influenced immigration policy in the twenties. In the 1920s a wide national consensus sharply restricted the overall inflow of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe. The second Ku Klux Klan, which flourished in the U.S. in the 1920s, used strong nativist, anti-Catholic, and anti-semitic rhetoric, but the Catholics led a counterattack, such as in Chicago in 1921 where ethnic Irish residents hanged a Klan member in front of 3,000 people.Todd Tucker, Notre Dame Vs. the Klan: How the Fighting Irish Defeated the Ku Klux Klan (2004) After intense lobbying from the nativist movement the United States Congress passed the Emergency Quota Act in 1921. This bill was the first to place numerical quotas on immigration. It capped the inflow of immigrations to 357,803 for those arriving outside of the western hemisphere. However, this bill was only temporary as Congress began debating a more permanent bill. The Emergency Quota Act was followed with the Immigration Act of 1924, a more permanent resolution. This law reduced the number of immigrants able to arrive from 357,803, the number established in the Emergency Quota Act, to 164,687. Though this bill did not fully restrict immigration, it considerably curbed the flow of immigration into the United States, especially from Southern and Eastern Europe. During the late twenties an average of 270,000 immigrants were allowed to arrive mainly because of the exemption of Canada and Latin American countries. Fear of low-skilled Southern and Eastern European immigrants flooding the labor market was an issue in the 1920s, and in the first decade of the 21st century (focused on immigrants from Mexico and Central America). An immigration reductionism movement formed in the 1970s and continues to the present day. Prominent members often press for massive, sometimes total, reductions in immigration levels. American nativist sentiment experienced a resurgence in the late 20th century, this time directed at undocumented workers, largely Mexican resulting in the passage of new penalties against illegal immigration in 1996. Most immigration reductionists see Illegal immigration, principally from across the United States‚ÄìMexico border, as the more pressing concern. Authors such as Samuel Huntington have also seen recent Hispanic immigration as creating a national identity crisis and presenting insurmountable problems for US social institutions.Huntington, Clash of Civilizations (1997) Noting the large-scale Mexican immigration in the Southwest, the Cold-war diplomat George F. Kennan in 2002 saw \\"unmistakable evidences of a growing differentiation between the cultures, respectively, of large southern and southwestern regions of this country, on the one hand\\", and those of \\"some northern regions\\". In the former, he warned: :the very culture of the bulk of the population of these regions will tend to be primarily Latin-American in nature rather than what is inherited from earlier American traditions ... Could it really be that there was so little of merit [in America] that it deserves to be recklessly trashed in favor of a polyglot mix- mash?\\"Bill Kauffman, Free Vermont , The American Conservative December 19, 2005. Mayers argues that Kennan represented the \\"tradition of militant nativism\\" that resembled or even exceeded the Know Nothings of the 1850s.David Mayers, George Kennan and the Dilemmas of US Foreign Policy (1990) ch 3 Mayers adds that Kennan also believed American women had too much power. 21st century In the years leading up to 2010, many experts on trade liberalization and globalization expected the Great Recession to cause a resurgence in nativism, both in terms of America's trade openness and the mobility of humans into the country. However, in the immediate aftermath there was no major spike in nativist economic policies, even though the economic contraction did trigger some culturally nativist sentiments among the American public. By late 2014, the \\"Tea Party movement\\" had turned its focus away from economic issues, spending, and Obamacare, and towards President Barack Obama's immigration policies, which it saw as a threat to transform American society. It planned to defeat leading Republicans who supported immigration programs, such as Senator John McCain. A typical slogan appeared in the Tea Party Tribune: ‚ÄúAmnesty for Millions, Tyranny for All.‚Äù The New York Times reported: :What started five years ago as a groundswell of conservatives committed to curtailing the reach of the federal government, cutting the deficit and countering the Wall Street wing of the Republican Party has become a movement largely against immigration overhaul. The politicians, intellectual leaders and activists who consider themselves part of the Tea Party have redirected their energy from fiscal austerity and small government to stopping any changes that would legitimize people who are here illegally, either through granting them citizenship or legal status.Jeremy W. Peters, \\"Obama‚Äôs Immigration Action Reinvigorates Tea Party,\\" New York Times Nov 25, 2014 In his 2016 bid for presidency, Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump has been accused of introducing nativist themes for his controversial stances on temporarily banning foreign Muslims from six specific countries entering the United States and erecting a substantial wall between the US-Mexico border to halt illegal immigration. Journalist John Cassidy wrote in The New Yorker Trump is transforming the GOP into a populist, nativist party: :Trump has been drawing on a base of alienated white working-class and middle-class voters, seeking to remake the G.O.P. into a more populist, nativist, avowedly protectionist, and semi-isolationist party that is skeptical of immigration, free trade, and military interventionism.John Cassidy, \\"Donald Trump Is Transforming the G.O.P. into a Populist, Nativist Party.

History=Monastery= The charterhouse was established in 1397. The estates with which it was endowed reached as far as Scharbeutz on the Bay of L√ºbeck. During the Reformation the monastery was secularised, and with its estates fell into the hands of John II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg, in 1584, who had the buildings demolished. =Castle= The building materials were used between 1593 and 1601 for the construction of the castle in Ahrensb√∂k, Schloss Hoppenbrook, which was the principal residence between 1623 and 1636 of the ruler of the newly formed Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Pl√∂nCreated in 1623 by partition between co-heirs of a larger duchy. The new duchy existed until 1761, when the last duke, Friedrich Karl, died without legitimate surviving male issue. The territory then passed to the King of Denmark, in accordance with a familial agreement which the two monarchs had concluded a few years earlier. while Duke Joachim Ernst I's new castle in Pl√∂n (Schloss Pl√∂n) was under construction. Once Schloss Pl√∂n was finished, the ducal residence was moved there from Ahrensb√∂k, leaving Schloss Hoppenbrook as a secondary residence. After the death there in 1740 of Duchess Juliane Luise, widow of Joachim Frederick, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Pl√∂n, Schloss Hoppenbrook was demolished. The Rathaus of Ahrensb√∂k now stands on its site, in a park in which ditches from the previous castle complex can still be made out. Monastery church The only surviving building from the time of the Carthusians is the Brick Gothic St. Mary's church - Marienkirche - which in fact was begun in the first quarter of the 14th century and thus predates the monastery itself: when the charterhouse was established it was taken over for use as the monastery church. It was extended several times, and in 1400 the polygonal quire was added. The tower, with an inscribed sandstone tablet over the portal, was not added until 1761.

He lives in Oslo. __TOC__ Writing career=Fiction= Harstad was born in Stavanger. He made his literary debut in 2001, with a collection of short prose entitled Herfra blir du bare eldre ('From here on in you only get older'). The following year he published a collection of short stories called Ambulanse ('Ambulance') and 2005 saw the publication of his first novel, Buzz Aldrin, hvor ble det av deg i alt mylderet? ('Buzz Aldrin, What Happened to You in All the Confusion?'). The novel is mainly set in the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic Ocean. It deals with a person who, instead of trying to be best, decides to be second best in life, like his hero, Buzz Aldrin, the second man on the moon. In 2009 the novel was made into a television series, starring Chad Coleman as well as other, well known Scandinavian actors, including P√•l Sverre Valheim Hagen and Bjarne Henriksen.http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/08/10/kultur/tv_og_medier/the_wire/chad_coleman/buzz_aldrin/7585708/ Rights to the book have been sold to United States, Australia, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Germany, the Faroe Islands, Italy, Russia, Turkey, South Korea and France. Demanding that the book be translated into English, an editor in the publishing house Simon & Schuster likened Harstad's work with that of Jonathan Safran Foer. The book was published in English by Seven Stories Press in New York in June 2011, and was named a Kirkus Reviews Best Fiction Title of 2011 and one of Electric Literature's Most Beautiful Books of the Year. In 2007, Harstad published H√§sselby, a novel about the children's book character Alfie Atkins' life as an adult, who ultimately is held responsible for the end of the world. The novel is influenced by David Lynch's TV series Twin Peaks, the theory of Synchronicity and Arthur Koestler's book The Roots of Coincidence. In 2008 he published his first sci- fi / horror novel, 172 Hours on the Moon, a crossover between young adult fiction and adult fiction. The novel, dealing with a return to the moon in 2012 (2019 in the US edition), is partly a homage to sci-fi and horror films from the 1970s and 1980s. For DARLAH he was awarded the 2008 Brage Prize in the category children's literature. The rights to the novel has been sold to United States, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Germany, the Faroe Islands, Turkey, South Korea, France, Mexico, Taiwan and Brasil. In 2015 he published Max-Mischa-Tetoffensiven, a more than a 1000 pages long novel centered around the life of the playwright and theatre director Max Hansen who moved from his native Norway to the U.S. as a teenager. The Dutch translation of this work was awarded the 2018 Europese Literatuur Prijs https://www.europeseliteratuurprijs.nl/2018/winnaar.php, a prize for translated European literature. Harstad was awarded the Dobloug Prize in 2019. =Plays= Harstad is also a playwright, and four of his works was published in 2008 as Bsider ('B-sides'). In late 2008 Harstad was hired as an in-house playwright at the National Theatre of Norway, as the first to hold such a position. During his time at the National Theatre he started working on an extensive two part play which was published in 2010 as Osv. ('Etc.'). The play, which in its Norwegian edition is over 500 pages long, is set in 1994 and centers around an American family whose relationship is falling apart. The father, a Vietnam War veteran, suffers a nervous breakdown more than two decades after his homecoming and moves into the park at Constitution Gardens in Washington D.C., next to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall. The daughter struggles in London, after the loss of her husband and the son is a war photographer, covering conflicts in Europe and Africa. The Bosnian War, the first Chechen war and the Rwandan genocide plays a big part in the play, both as a setting and as examples of growing conflicts in the mid-1990s. For this play, Harstad received, in 2014, the Norwegian Ibsen Award. Also, he was nominated for another Brage Prize Award. In 2011 Harstad oversaw the first production of the complete Memoirs of a Breadman-trilogy at Black Box Teater in Oslo, a theater known for its focus on modern and contemporary theater. The plays are all a mix between comedy, tragedy and absurdism. The first part, Akapulco, takes place in a fictitious Swiss village in Mexico around 1920-1930. The second part, Ellis Iland is set in Manhattan between 1906 and 1917 and focus on two immigrants, a German man called Barker and a Ukrainian man called Stoklitsky, who struggles to make a life for themselves in the city. Barker is an accountant, but is forced by their landlady to work in the New York City sewer hunting alligators while Stoklitsky, who just happens to be tone deaf, tries to compose a symphony for theremins, containing only perfect fifths. The trilogy was one of three candidates for the 2012 Norwegian Ibsen Award.http://www.ibsenawards.com/nyheter/ibsenprisen-2012-tre-nominerte Though no official explanation has been given by the author, many of the geographical names in Harstad's plays are intentionally misspelled (e.g. Washingtin, Akapulco, Ellis Iland, Mattrhorn). In the Memoirs of a Breadman, references are also made to places such as Ithalia, Mexicoo, U.E.S.A, Zyrich, Miilano, Providense and Chikago. =Non-fiction= In 2012 Harstad published his first non-fiction work, Blissard - A Book About Motorpsycho. The book is a mix between a biography of the Norwegian band Motorpsycho and their 1996 album Blissard, a personal account of the author's long time relationship with the band's music and his own teenage years. More than 140 pages of the books total of 330 is made up by footnotes, where Harstad expands on band trivia, details, digressions, literary detours and personal stories as well as including interviews with people affiliated with the band, poetry, reviews and newspaper clippings.

It was the only facility of its kind in the province of Saskatchewan. Sask Railway museum Eaton Hawker memorial marker Under the War Measures Act (1914), 8,579 enemy aliens ‚Äî nationals of countries at war with Canada ‚Äî were interned in Canada during World War I as prisoners of war. Primarily immigrant settlers of Ukrainian origin, they were sent to prisoner of war camps‚Äîmost located in the Canadian hinterland‚Äîwhere they would work on government public projects as military conscript labour. Toward the end of the war however, the majority of internees were conditionally released to industry, the result of the growing labour shortage. This led to some camps being dismantled, others consolidated, as well as to the relocation of those internees considered undesirable. As part of this relocation process, sixty- five internees were sent in October 1918 to an internment facility at Munson, Alberta where they laboured on the railway. However the outbreak of the 1918 flu pandemic (Spanish Influenza) and disciplinary issues forced the relocation of the Munson camp. On February 25, 1919, the internees were removed to a hastily constructed camp on the site of the railway siding at Eaton, Saskatchewan. It was thought that the move would placate the inmate population. It had little effect. Growing resistance among the internees and lack of confidence in the military guard prompted authorities to abandon the Eaton siding location for more secure facilities. On March 21, twenty-four days after the facility was initially established, the internees were transported by rail to a military installation at Amherst, Nova Scotia where they were to be processed for deportation. The Eaton Internment Camp was dismantled shortly afterwards. The site of the original camp is on the grounds of the present-day Saskatchewan Railway Museum, situated at the junction of Highway 60 and the Canadian National Railway, four kilometers southwest of Saskatoon. In 2005, as part of a national campaign to seek official acknowledgement and redress for the World War I internment of Ukrainians and others, the Prairie Centre for the Study of Ukrainian Heritage, an academic unit at the University of Saskatchewan, in association with the Saskatchewan Railway Museum commissioned and unveiled on the original site a bronze and tindal-stone memorial.

(born circa 1501 in Paris and died 1540), rector of the University of Paris in late 1533, from 10 October 1533, was a Swiss Protestant Reformer and friend of John Calvin. Nicolas Cop and his brother Michel Cop, sons of the king's physician, had become Calvin's friends during their shared time at the Coll√®ge de Montaigu. They were sons of Guillaume Cop, a native of Basel who became physician to the king of France, Francis I. Around 1533, when Calvin had returned to Paris, tensions were rising between the humanistic and religious reformers of the Coll√®ge Royal and the conservative senior faculty members. The Coll√®ge Royal was later to become the Coll√®ge de France. Nicolas Cop, one of the reformers, had been elected rector of the University of Paris although the institution generally condemned Martin Luther. On All Saints Day, November 1, 1533, Nicolas Cop as rector delivered his inaugural address, in which he revealed himself as being in sympathy with Luther.Concio academica nomine rectoris universitatis Parisiensis scripta. CO 10b:30-36; OS 1:4-10. See also Eberhard Busch et al., eds., Calvin--Studien Ausgabe vol.1/1, Reformatorische Anfange (1533-1541). Neu Kirchen: Vly Vluyn 1994, pp. 10-25. Cop discussed the need for reform and renewal in the Roman Catholic Church and highlighted differences between the Beatitudes of the Gospels and the theology and practices of the Roman Catholic Church pre-Counter Reformation. Calvin certainly influenced but did not write Cop's address, which defended the doctrine of justification by faith alone. Calvin is thought to have been complicit because he had fled from Paris just before Cop's delivery of the inaugural address. Nicolas Cop's inaugural address as rector of the University of Paris provoked a strong reaction from the faculty, many of whom denounced it as heretical. Within just two days, on 3 November 1533, two Franciscans filed a complaint in the Parlement de Paris against Cop for heresy. Cop appeared before the parlementThis was a French institution not equivalent to the English parliament. and, upon failing to obtain the support of the king or the university, was forced to flee. He fled in secret, arriving in time at Basel. Cop traveled until reaching Basel in February 1534 and then went to Freiburg with Erasmus and Ludwig Baer. He made contact with the reformers in Strassburg and Ludovicus Carinus or Ludwig Carinus, whom he had known well in Paris. King Francis I during the furor created by Cop's brief tenure as rector referred to \\"the cursed Lutherans.\\" Calvin, implicated in Cop's offense, was himself forced into hiding for the next year. Nicolas Cop was befriended by the King's sister Marguerite de Navarre. He used his post to rehabilitate her work \\"Le miroir de l'√¢me p√©cheresse\\" (The mirror of the sinful soul). In January 1535, Calvin joined Cop in Basel, a city that had come under the influence of the reformer Johannes Oecolampadius. Cop traveled again to Paris where he earned his medical licence in May 1536. In the following year he was called to Scotland, where illness had struck the newly married Madeleine of France. Nicolas Cop also taught medicine at the university of Paris, but died suddenly in the winter of 1539/1540.Much of this paragraph is a translation from the German-language entry on Wikipedia.

For example, if a driver in an automobile accident boasts publicly that they were speeding, it may represent a legal admission of liability. It is analogous to the criminal equivalent, the statement against penal interest which is a statement that puts the person making the statement at risk of prosecution.

He was executed for crimes against humanity committed at the Mauthausen camp.  Concentration camp career In the autumn of 1941, Krebsbach became Standortarzt (garrison doctor) of Mauthausen concentration camp, tasked with supervising medical care and all medical personnel of the camp. He was responsible for initiating mass killing by lethal injection to the heart on handicapped and sick prisoners. Under his supervision approximately 900 Russian, Polish and Czech prisoners were murdered by lethal injections of gasoline. Because of this inmates nicknamed him 'Dr Spritzbach' (Dr Injection). Krebsbach was also responsible for the construction of a gas chamber in the basement of the hospital in the Mauthausen camp. Krebsbach often inspected the prisoners and conducted selections for execution. A former inmate recalled Krebsbach's actions during such an inspection: \\"As the senior SS doctor in the camp, Dr Krebsbach sometimes came to block 5 and had the still surviving Jews paraded before him. He then asked if any of them were doctors. If there were, he would say: 'You Jewish pig, you‚Äôre just an abortionist.' The next day they were done away with by the kapos. If a Jewish inmate was lying on the floor with a broken limb - a not uncommon occurrence at work - he was usually thrown over a wall by a kapo. If Dr Krebsbach were passing, he would say ironically: 'Yes, this broken foot is a hopeless case.'\\" Josef Herzler, former Mauthausen inmate (AMM V/3/22). Krebsbach was transferred to the Kaiserwald concentration camp in Latvia during the autumn of 1943, as it is believed he shot Josef Breitenfellner in his home. Breitenfellner was a German soldier from Langenstein on vacation when he and his friends awoke Krebsbach from his sleep on 22 May 1943. Here he conducted selections by forcing the prisoners to perform physical exercises to check their strength and then identifying the two thousand weakest to be killed. Following the camp's closure, Krebsbach resumed a career as ‚ÄúEpidemic Inspector for Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania‚Äù. Soon after he transferred to the regular army as a senior staff doctor, serving until late 1944. However this was short lived and at the end of 1944 he left the army and worked once again as a company doctor in a spinning mill in Kassel. Dachau War Crime Trial Following the end of World War II he was arrested and given the death penalty during the Dachau trials conducted by the US military on 13 May 1946 and was executed by hanging on 28 May 1947 at Landsberg Prison in Landsberg am Lech.

It was released in the United Kingdom in July 2009. The collection is made up of rare works previously published in magazines and out-of-print anthologies, including a Christmas dinner with Trainspotting's psychotic Francis Begbie, science fiction tale \\"The Rosewell Incident\\", and a story following Terry \\"Juice\\" Lawson in Florida. All of the stories in Reheated Cabbage with the exception of the novella \\"I Am Miami\\" had been published in the 1990s in now unavailable media. Stories=A Fault on the Line= This story is Welsh's gruesome exposition of a dysfunctional marital relationship. Malky's partner Claire persuades him to take her and their children to the pub. After a few drinks and a shortcut back home through the station, a train approaches just as the family are crossing the line and rips off her legs. He is distraught, as there is a Hibs-Hearts game on television at 2pm that he does not want to miss. =Catholic Guilt (You Know You Love It)= A homophobic Scots gay basher builder living in London dies while having sex, and in his afterlife is condemned by St Peter to eternally participate the sex acts he deplored - buggering his friends. =Elspeth's Boyfriend= The sociopathic Frank Begbie's sister Elspeth has a new boyfriend, to whom Begbie does not take kindly. Begbie subsequently ruins his family's Christmas dinner. =Kissing and Making Up= An unnamed man has a misogynistic internal monologue about his recent breakup. He enters a strip club, but is beaten heavily by the owner, Seeker, after offending one of the dancers. =The Rosewell Incident= A civilisation of telepathic aliens kidnap a teenager from Rosewell, Midlothian and learn to speak Scots. Many years later, a teenage, cigarette-addicted alien makes contact with a gang of bored drug using teenagers, in order to put on a rave concert for the entire planet, much to the chagrin of the elder alien in charge of observing Earth, who does not want to interfere with the planet's course of events. =The State of the Party= Two friends, Crooky and Calum, take acid in a bar before running into their old friend Bobby (\\"Boaby\\"), who is on heroin. After the three arrive at a party, Bobby dies of overdose, and the two, along with a couple of other partygoers, are kicked out of the flat before being assaulted by a group of youths. =Victor Spoils= Two acquaintances, Gavin and Victor, over pills of ecstasy and pints of lager, discuss their respective claims to a mutual sexual partner, Sarah, who meanwhile is at the dentist getting her wisdom teeth extracted. The two resolve to allow Sarah to choose between them, only to find upon her return that she is offended by their possessive attitude and is not interested in either of them. =I Am Miami= The novella reunites former problem student now turned successful DJ Carl Ewart and his old school friend Terry \\"Juice\\" Lawson with their former teacher. Reception The book was positively received by James Walton of the Telegraph who noted that \\"while the book is unlikely to bring Welsh new readers, fans will notice that his customary strengths are in place.

St. Martin's Press, 1997, , 9780312169688 Garvey was a former Buzzcocks, Teardrops and Bok Bok member, while Rowbotham was previously in The Durutti Column and then in The Mothmen. History The band was formed by Steve Garvey, Dave Rowbotham, Snuff and Dave Price by 1980. The first two had some trajectory in the Manchester musical scene at the time: Garvey was famous for being the bassist of the punk band Buzzcocks, although he was involved in two new wave groups at the time, The Teardrops and Bok Bok, and Rowbotham was in the early line-up of post-punk band The Durutti Column, sharing the guitarist role with Vini Reilly, and after departing, he alongside other ex-members of the band formed The Mothmen, in which he was still involved at the time Motivation formed. The band were managed by former Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon. Boon claimed in an interview at the time that Motivation sounded like 1976 bands, which indicated the group sounded like pre-punk formations or the first punk bands. Andy Hieke and Colin Robinson from Night Visitors were their sound engineers. By 1983, Garvey (who was playing with Blue Orchids, in parallel with Motivation) and Price moved to New York, but the band continued, with Garvey as the only known remaining member.[ Allmusic.com - Buzzcocks] Steve Garvey moved to New York, where he played with Motivation for a few years. The band was forced to change their name to Shy Talk and was signed to Columbia records in the U.S., releasing one album, Shy Talk, in 1985. The album was produced by Procol Harum's Pete Solley. At this time the line up consisted of Dave Price (vocals), Michael Nehra (guitars), Phil Garmyn (bass), David Bravo (keyboards) and John Morelli (drums). Steve Garvey is thanked in the album credits but did not perform on the album. Snuff joined Distant Cousins in the late 1980s. Garvey reformed Buzzcocks in 1989 but quit in 1992 due to health problems. In 1991, Rowbotham, who passed in the 1980s as a session musician for Factory Records, was killed by an axe murderer in his flat. ReferencesBibliography * Gimarc, George. Post punk Diary: 1980-82.

The book was originally published in Norway on September 15, 2008 by Cappelen Damm, with an English language translation being published by Little, Brown in New York City on July 10, 2012. Rights to DARLAH have also been sold to sixteen other countries: Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, Faroe Islands, France, the Netherlands, Germany, UK, Turkey, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Taiwan, South Korea, Mexico and Brazil. In 2008 Harstad's work on DARLAH won him a Brage Prize. Plot After a prologue set in 2010, the book begins in 2012, after NASA has announced its intent to hold a contest for teenagers between the ages of 14 and 18. Three winners will be selected from all over the world, with the prize being a coveted spot on an upcoming mission to return to the Moon. The stunt is believed to be a way of increasing both funding and public interest, but the real reason is that NASA intends to study a mystical phenomenon with a sinister edge that was previously discovered during the original Moon landings. This is the reason that NASA stopped sending people to the Moon in the 1970s. Three teenagers from Norway, Japan, and France (Mia, Midori, and Antoine respectively) are excited at the rare opportunity to see the Moon firsthand as well as stay in the formerly secret lunar base DARLAH 2, which was built in the 1970s during Operation DP7. Their excitement is short-lived as they realize that this base might become their tomb, discovering what keeps other from visiting the Moon: beings that can only be described as doppelg√§ngers, which are revealed to have appeared in Earth's history before. Before the Moon landings, they were harmless, but after a radio telescope receives what has been called the \\"6EQUJ5\\" signal, humans decide to investigate. The code \\"6EQUJ5\\" has been following the three teenagers everywhere since shortly after they are selected to travel to the Moon, with Mia seeing \\"6E\\" written on a hobo's jacket, Antoine seeing \\"QU\\" on a crashing plane, which never existed, and Midori seeing \\"J5\\" as the airport gate leading to where she is to depart for the United States. Ever since the first Moon landing, the doppelgangers have attacked any and all astronauts, nearly killing the crew of Apollo 13, and after analyzing a detached doppelg√§nger arm, NASA finds that the beings are not living, as they are composed of an unknown inorganic material. Meanwhile, a retired NASA custodian from the era of the first Moon landings, living in a retirement home, slowly remembers the horrible secret that will mean the teenagers' imminent death if they are allowed to travel to the Moon. Back on Earth, after the doppelg√§ngers attack the Moon base, the children and their \\"chaperones\\" are declared dead, leaving no hope for them. One by one, each are killed by their doppelg√§ngers: the two engineers on the mission are locked in an airless room to suffocate; Antoine and Mia's short-lived romance is extinguished by his disappearance with the mission commander; the lunar module pilot, a young woman, is murdered by Antoine's doppelg√§nger, leaving Mia and Midori to fend for themselves. The retired NASA worker tries to alert the military, but because of an inability to speak, fails, and dies shortly afterwards. Mia and Midori run to the kitchen of DARLAH 2 to hide from the doppelg√§ngers, which have infiltrated the base, first posing as Mia. They hide in the kitchen and then run to the greenhouse, finding the moonbase commander camped out under a tree. He tells them to run to the escape pod in the underground moonbase DARLAH 1, which can only carry three people. Mia tries to persuade him to join them, since there is room, but he believes he should die on the base, saying he has a gun and can defend himself. Mia and Midori find spacesuits and go outside, having to traverse some of the moonscape to get to the pod. Along the way, they find the bodies of Antoine and the astronaut he disappeared with. Mia pauses to mourn Antoine, and moves on. Once inside the room leading to the pod, Midori suddenly acts childish and tries to thwart Mia's attempts to make it to the pod. Mia realizes Midori is dead and has been replaced with a doppelg√§nger, having been killed when they were hiding in the kitchen. The Midori doppelg√§nger muses about how \\"silly\\" Midori was, believing in urban legends, including the legend of Kuchisake-onna. Imitating the legend, the Midori doppelg√§nger splits her mouth, leaving two scars, and asks \\"Watashi kirei?\\" (\\"Am I beautiful now?\\") Mia makes a desperate escape to the pod, the doppelg√§nger changing its shape to match Mia's. The two Mias fight, and Mia gets into the escape pod, with the other Mia desperately beating on the sides, trying to get access, but failing and shrieking as the pod takes off. The pod crash-lands on Earth several days later, and Mia's parents rent her the most expensive hotel room in New York. She runs into the hobo from the beginning of the book and kills him, revealing that the Mia on Earth is a doppelg√§nger, and can make a copy of itself with every person it kills. Mia's family comes to visit her, and her little brother is frightened by her, saying her eyes are scary. She kills Mia's family, making many copies of herself, and proceeds to kill everyone in the hotel. A mission report appears at the end of the book from the spacecraft Providence, returning to the Moon on the way to Europa in 2081, finding the bodies of Mia, the lunar module pilot, the engineers and the moonbase commander. The commander shot himself, and the rest were either suffocated (the two engineers and Mia) or had an unknown cause of death (the lunar module pilot). The Providence has not encountered the doppelg√§ngers, and says they have found the cause of the \\"DP7 event on Earth in 2019\\" (Mia killing everybody) and have found a letter written by Mia. She says goodbye in this letter, saying she has very little time left and that the space suit's gloves make it hard to write. The report ends. US marketing campaign Prior to the US release of 172 Hours on the Moon in July 2012, Little, Brown, the publishing house, created an extensive media campaign to promote the book. A website was made, where visitors were met by the text \\"Do you want to go to the moon? Are you between the ages of 14 and 18? Spend 172 Hours on the moon at moon base Darlah 2\\", trying to get them to believe that the upcoming mission to the Moon was in fact real.172 HOURS ON THE MOON  Return to moon base DARLAH 2 on 4.17.12 Visitors were asked to submit their e-mail in order to compete for a ticket allowing them to come along on the expedition into space. In addition, a Facebook- profilehttp://www.facebook.com/172HoursontheMoon was created, as well as a Twitter account where Mia, Midori and Antoine, the three teenage protagonists in the novel updated followers in real-time about the last preparations leading up to the announced liftoff, which was in fact just the date and time for the release of the book. During the media campaign Little, Brown also put up a number of video clips on YouTube, further enhancing the experience of a real upcoming mission by allowing the viewers (and potential readers of the novel) to meet the three main characters through found footage-style snippets of private video logs, press conferences, home video and footage apparently shot on the Moon itself.Midori Yoshida packs for her trip...TO THE MOON! - YouTubeAntoine Devereux has a 'vision' before moon trip - YouTubeMia Nomeland reacts to moon trip win (Doesn't go so well) - YouTubeMoon trip winner Midori Yoshida meets the press - YouTubeAntoine tackles media's questions about lunar base DARLAH 2 - YouTubeMia Nomeland's feisty reaction to the press - YouTubeMia Nomeland's final transmission from the moon - YouTubeLast footage taken of Midori Yoshida on the moon - YouTubeAntoine Devereux's final transmission from the moon - YouTube Harstad also attended the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con, taking part in panel discussions with other sci-fi/horror novelists, such as Mark Z. Danielewski, as well as doing signings. At the Hachette Book Groups booth on the main expo floor, Little, Brown gave away packs of custom designed Space ice cream, with the sentence \\"This could be your last meal\\" on the front, along with a picture of the Moon on a pitch black background and the title of the book. Reception Reception for the various translations of DARLAH has been positive, with The Guardian calling it \\"out of this world\\". The Hollywood Reporter also gave a positive review, citing the mixture of horror and sci-fi as a highlight of the novel. Kirkus Reviews and Publishers Weekly praised the book, with Publishers Weekly stating that although \\"readers don‚Äôt get to know the characters terribly well\\" that this lent to the book's atmosphere. The book received the 2008 Brage Prize for children's literature.

The quarry is a limestone and aggregate mining operation and cement plant, owned by Lehigh Southwest Cement, a subsidiary of Heidelberg Cement. Since 1939 the plant has been in operation and is responsible for the production of more than half of the cement used in the Bay Area. Roughly 70 percent of the cement used in the communities of Santa Clara County is acquired from the cement plant.Cupertino cement quarry to pay $7.5 million to settle water pollution violations ‚Äì The Mercury News Located in the foothills above Cupertino on the northeast slopes of Black Mountain, the quarry runs east-west parallel to the upper watershed of Permanente Creek to the south and to Permanente Ridge and Rancho San Antonio Open Space Preserve to the north. The limestone rock found in the Permanente Creek valley and on the summit of Black Mountain is relatively unique in the Bay Area. Microfossils in the limestone deposits suggest that the mountain originated as a seamount at 22 degrees north in the tropical Pacific about 100 million years ago and was transported to Los Altos by the Pacific Plate. These rocks occur as jagged gray boulders and outcrops just southwest of the radio towers on the summit of Black Mountain, as well as in the Permanente Quarry. History The quarry was founded by Henry J. Kaiser as the Kaiser Permanente Cement Plant in 1939, taking the name of the business from the Permanente Creek in whose valley it lies. Kaiser intended to use the quarry to provide the majority of the cement used in the construction of the Shasta Dam, supplying the of cement.Shasta Dam ‚Äì Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Additionally, Kaiser Cement Company built Highway 101, Highway 85 and other major Northern California landmarks from the quarry.Frequently Asked Questions ‚Äì City of Cupertino The cement plant is the primary reason for the lone railroad line that runs through the city. Hanson Cement acquired Kaiser Cement for $200 million in 1986.Kaiser Cement OKs Bid by Unit of Hanson Trust : Competitor, Lone Star, Will Sell Some Holdings to Another British Firm ‚Äì LA Times The cement company was renamed Hanson Permanente Cement in 1999. At the time of sale, Kaiser Cement was the 5th largest producer of cement in the entire United States.‚Äì Hanson to Acquire Kaiser Cement ‚Äì New York Times =Economic problems and bankruptcy= Hanson Permanente Cement filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy with the US Bankruptcy Court in 2016. The bankruptcy is related to more than 14,000 injury lawsuits.Hanson Permanente Cement files for bankruptcy ‚Äì Global Cement The previous year Hanson Permanente Cement was ordered to spend $5 million to install an advanced wastewater treatment plant along with $2.55 million in civil penalties. Pollution=Mercury emissions= The cement plant at the quarry has been fueled by petroleum coke since 2007, the latter (along with the limestone itself) is a major source of mercury emissions. The cement plant is responsible for 29 percent of total Bay Area airborne mercury emissions and was shown to impact a rural site, Calero Reservoir, away. Mercury, a neurotoxin and pollutant which is concentrated in the aquatic food web, was found to be 5.8 to 6.7 times higher in precipitation near the cement plant than at a control location away. =Selenium discharge= Groundwater fills the current quarry and is pumped into Permanente Creek. Selenium pollution in the creek downstream from the quarry ranged from 13 to 81 micrograms/liter (Œºg/L). A North Quarry water sample in January 2010 had a dissolved selenium concentration of 82 Œºg/L, indicating that the quarry is the source of the selenium pollution. Selenium is bioaccumulated in the aquatic food web. Safety standards for selenium concentrations in fresh water are 5 Œºg/L under the California Toxics Rule (same as the National Toxics Rule set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in 2000 and 2012. =Sediment discharges= Anthropization related to quarry operations and the cement plant have resulted in sediment discharges into Permanente Creek that are 3.5 times what would be expected under undeveloped conditions. Sediment loads in the upper Permanente Creek mainstem are 15 times those in the West Fork Permanente Creek, which drains mostly parkland. These sediment loads could threaten the resident rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) population in the creek. Opposition Under the terms of a 1985 reclamation plan, the quarry was not supposed to dump quarry waste materials more than 100 feet higher than the natural chaparral ridge known as Permanente Ridge. This waste material storage area, or WMSA, was piled on and above the Permanente Ridge and this brownish-gray scar is visible from much of the southern Bay Area ‚Äì despite claims from the 2004 owner, Hanson Cement, that it was hydroseeded annually with native grass mix and that they planted 80% of the area in trees and shrubs, it remains (see photo inset) a barren zone, degrading the aesthetic value of the adjacent Rancho San Antonio Open Space Preserve. This barren ridge line, referred to by Lehigh Southwest as the West Materials Storage Area (WMSA) is visible to much of the Silicon Valley. On December 19, 2011, the Sierra Club sued Lehigh Southwest Cement Company and Heidelberg Cement in federal court to stop its unpermitted discharges of selenium and other toxic water pollutants into Permanente Creek. The Sierra Club maintains that Lehigh has been polluting Permanente Creek in violation of the clean water act for years. Lehigh's own water quality analyses have demonstrated that quarry pit wastewater that Lehigh discharges into the creek has been 16 times higher than Clean Water Act stream standards. Such pollution would be especially harmful to aquatic life in downstream areas such as Rancho San Antonio County Park, where selenium concentrations are often more than five times higher than state and federal standards allow. On June 7, 2012, the County of Santa Clara Board of Supervisors approved amendments to the 1985 Permanente Quarry Reclamation Plan for Lehigh Southwest Cement Company, including approval of a new waste material storage area (EMSA) at the east end of the quarry. The newly approved Reclamation Plan has 89 conditions (significantly more than the 73 conditions in the 1985 Amendment), and calls for higher performance standards for re-vegetation of all disturbed areas, minimizing selenium runoff and an increased level of reporting and monitoring. The Board also ratified the Final Environmental Impact Report in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act. In December 2012 the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District filed a lawsuit against Santa Clara County, challenging the reclamation plan for Lehigh Southwest Cement's Permanente Quarry near Cupertino, saying its environmental impact report failed to analyze and mitigate the project's impacts on air quality, hazardous materials, recreation, groundwater and endangered species. =2011 shooting= On October 5, 2011, the Lehigh Southwest Cement plant was the site of a shooting committed by a disgruntled employee, 47-year-old Shareef Allman. During a safety meeting at 4:00 a.m., Allman opened fire with a .223-caliber semiautomatic rifle and a .40-caliber handgun, killing three coworkers and wounding six others. He later shot and wounded a woman and attempted to carjack her a few hours after the shooting. The shooting prompted a manhunt which caused a lockdown to some schools and businesses in nearby communities. Allman was confronted by Santa Clara County sheriff's deputies the next day in a neighborhood in Sunnyvale, in which he pointed a firearm towards them and three deputies responded with gunfire. It was initially reported that Allman died from the officer's gunshots, but it was later determined he died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

Most of his life is known to us only through medieval hagiography, legends, and sectarian works. It is generally agreed, though, that during his time at TiƒÅnt√≥ng Mountain he befriended D≈çgen who was also studying under Rujing. After Rujing's death in 1228, Jakuen immigrated to Japan in order to join his friend's emerging S≈çt≈ç school, but did not receive dharma transmission from D≈çgen directly, rather his disciple Koun Ej≈ç. Jakuen outlived D≈çgen and became embroiled in the sandai s≈çron, a dispute over orthodoxy and succession. In 1261 he left Eihei-ji, leaving the other monks to resolve the power struggle amongst themselves, but allegedly taking with him many treasures of Eihei-ji entrusted to him by D≈çgen. He arrived on a remote mountain in Fukui prefecture, where he became famous to the locals for his ascetic meditation on a mountainside without the benefit of any monastic community. During this time, according to medieval legend, he gained the friendship of a cow and dog who would follow him into town during almsrounds. The rock that he sat on has also become a local landmark. Eventually he built a monastery called H≈çky≈ç-ji (ÂÆùÊÖ∂ÂØ∫) in the style of TiƒÅnt√≥ng, which today owns the only surviving early treasures of Eihei-ji, and serves as a training center for Japanese and international S≈çt≈ç Zen Buddhists. In medieval Japan Jakuen's monastic community split into two separate lineages, one at H≈çky≈ç-ji and one at Eihei- ji which was responsible for some of the corruption that went on there. Today, there are communities of monks in both China and Japan who claim descent from Jakuen. His disciple Giun became abbot of Eihei-ji. In Japan, there is a temple in Tokyo named Jakuen-ji. H≈çky≈ç-ji is officially in communion with the official S≈çt≈ç lineage through Keizan, but unofficially consider Jakuen their patriarch. References * William M. Bodiford.
