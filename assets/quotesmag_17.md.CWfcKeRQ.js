He is reported to have the largest collection of renal stones in India, exceeding one million in number, which has earned him a mention in the Limca Book of Records. He is a recipient of several honours including the fourth highest Indian civilian award of the Padma Shri.  Biography  Nabakishore Singh was born on 1 March 1938 to L. Gouramani and Dhani at Sagolband Khanam Leirak, in the Northeast Indian state of Manipur, in a financially poor family. His parents were daily wage labourers and though he started his schooling at Budhimanjuri High School, he had to stop it at 8th standard. Singh learned traditional medicine from his father, who used to practice herbal medicine and enhanced his knowledge by his own researches of indigenous plants. While working as a teacher at the Government Primary School, he discovered that he had kidney stone which he is reported to have successfully treated with his own medicines. Singh pursued medical practice at his residence at Sagolband Khamnam Leirak in Imphal West, along with his regular job as a Hindi teacher at the Government School and turned to full-time practice after his retirement from the school. He is known to have treated over 200,000 persons, using home- made herbal medicines. He started collecting the kidney stones of the patients he treated as a hobby and the collection is reported to be exceeding 1.2 million in number; Limca Book of Records have recorded the achievement. He is also known to be a philanthropist, and the poor patients are reported to be provided free medical treatment. He has written a book of medicine, Role of Herbals in Urinary Tract and Stone Case Treatment and a book of poems, Chummi Haina Loubra, Lalli Haina Loubra?, which has run into its 15th edition. The Personification or Incarnation of Sacrifice is a documentary on the life and medical practice of Singh. He received the Press Information Bureau Award of the Government of India in 1996. The Government honoured him again, in 2001, by including him in the Republic Day honours list for the civilian honour of the Padma Shri. He is also a recipient of Manipur Voluntary Health Association Award (1999), Karmayogi Award (2005) and Dr. Ambedkar Fellowship (2006).

It aired in the United States on Fox on November 13, 2016. Plot When Grampa accidentally urinates on the carpet, the Simpsons try to get him medical help but find the nursing home has no resources or personnel at all, and the Veterans Administration tells Abe they can't see him for an appointment for 23 years. On the advice of another elderly ex-soldier, the family goes to Havana, Cuba to get Grampa cheap medical care. As they arrive there a friendly doctor sadly says there is nothing that can be done to help Abe, but the sights of cars and music from the 1950s leads to him feeling much healthier. While the family enjoys the sights of Havana, including Homer making a drinking game out of old speeches by Fidel Castro, Grampa meets a bar matron, Isabella, whom he fancies. He also runs into an old friend of his, a pilot who was thrown out of the Air Force for nearly detonating an atomic bomb by accident and stayed in Cuba after hijacking a plane and diverting it to there in the 1970s. He brings Grampa to a plane hidden in the jungle which he turned into a secret nightclub, where such nefarious types as drug lords and the founder of Ticketmaster (who is the only person everyone immediately punches in the face) are enjoying their exiles. Seeing how much fun life is there Grampa decides he wants to stay in Cuba. The Simpsons family tries to talk him out it. As they all board the plane it turns out that Isabella is a C.I.A. agent who tries to search for and arrest American refugees and transport them back to the U.S. Thus, Grampa and the family are brought back home but Grampa does retain some better feelings when he's back in the U.S. Production The chalkboard gag in this episode is a response to the unexpected victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. The season eleven episode \\"Bart to the Future\\", an episode set in the future, jokingly mentions Trump as being president. Reception Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave a positive review of the episode, giving it a 4/5, adding, \\"'Havana Wild Weekend' is a fun episode in what is shaping up to be a far better than average season. The jokes come fast, there are a few great setups and the locations are great. The Simpsons have visited almost-countless countries in their time. (We recently went over a partial list a few weeks ago when they visited Boston, but still refuse to count). There, as here, well, not here but in Cuba, the Simpsons fall in love with the locations and are far more respectful than they have been in the past.\\" Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C+ stating, \\"in the long and storied history of Simpsons travelogues, 'Havana Wild Weekend' is as sure to be forgotten as is poor old Abe.\\" \\"Havana Wild Weekend\\" scored a 3.1 rating and was watched by 7.13 million people, making it Fox's highest rated show of the night.

The official starting date for the work of TC 292 was 2015-01-01, when the three committees were disbanded and their work incorporated into ISO/TC 292. The committee was also assigned the responsibility for the area of supply chain security, including the ISO 28000 series previously developed by ISO/TC 8\\\\. The creation of ISO/TC 292 clarifies ISO's structural organization on security matters, and prepares ISO to tackle future topics in this field by creating a de facto coordination body within the TC central structure. This structure is optimized to limit and prevent conflict or duplication of work. It will assist public administrations/authorities with a general interest and protective mission to optimize their participation in ISO's work in this sector.

But two cases caught my attention, that of Edith Thompson and Frederick Bywaters in 1922, and of Alma Rattenbury and Percy Stoner in 1935 – both cases involving a husband, his wife and her young male lover, in which a moment’s reckless violence had fatal consequences for almost everyone concerned.\\"\\"Sarah Waters: ‘I wanted The Paying Guests to be sexy without being a romp’\\", The Guardian, 2015-06-06.

Reception *Lucy Daniel in The Telegraph is full of praise: \\"One of the things that brings her characters to life is that Waters is very good at describing physical contact, gestures, deeds. People recede from each other even as they become more physically entangled. Even living at such close quarters, her characters remain a mystery to one another. Finally the novel seems a discussion of the very nature of intimacy. As charming as the period details are, it would be easy to fall into quaintness, with appealing costumes, Edwardian parlance, and slipping into the pantry for a quick fondle. But Waters saves it by the eerie power of her writing.\\"\\"The Paying Guests by Sarah Waters, review: 'eerie, virtuoso writing', Sarah Waters’s sensational novel won’t disappoint her legion of fans\\", The Telegraph, 2014-08-30.

Its pastiche propriety and faux-Edwardian prose (people are forever \\"colouring\\" and \\"crimsoning\\" and \\"putting themselves tidy\\") become irritants; and the novel's descent into melodrama as a murder is committed – and the inspector called – turns this engaging literary endeavour into a tiresome soap opera.\\" *Arifa Akbar in The Independent also has some reservations, concluding: \\"Waters's historical fictions have shown her to be adept at tight, intricate plotting, most dazzlingly illustrated in the breathtaking plot twist in Fingersmith. If this is Waters’s early 20th-century crime novel, it does not match the imagination of this earlier Victorian crime novel. Perhaps Waters does not want to put on a fireworks display of plot surprises. She does give us a poignant love story which symbolically sees in the death of the old order, the death of the old-fashioned husband and maybe the birth of an era of love without secrets. Yet we find ourselves wishing for a few more fireworks all the same.\\"Novel tackles big themes but lacks bite, The Independent, 21 August 2014 Retrieved 2015-11-09.

The CNN2 gene is located at 19p13.3 in the human chromosomal genome, encoding the protein calponin 2. Calponin 2 is one of the three isoforms of calponin and an actin filament-associated regulatory protein with wide tissue distributions. Human calponin 2 is a 33.7-kDa protein consisting of 309 amino acids with an isoelectric point (pI) of 7.23. Accordingly, it is also known as neutral calponin.  Evolution  Figure 1: Evolutionary lineage of vertebrate calponin 2 deduced from alignment of amino acid sequences. Calponin isoforms are conserved proteins whereas calponin 2 has diverged from calponin 1 and calponin 3 mainly in the C-terminal variable region. Phylogenetic lineage of calponin 2 showed that calponin 2 is conserved among mammalian species but more diverged among amphibian, reptile and fish species (Fig 1).  Tissue distribution  CNN2 is expressed in a broader range of tissue and cell types, including developing and remodeling smooth muscle as well as adult mature smooth muscle, epidermal keratinocytes, fibroblasts, lung alveolar cells, endothelial cells, myeloid white blood cells, platelet, B lymphocyte, and myoblasts. These cell types can be classified as a) cells that are physiologically under high mechanical tension (e.g., smooth muscle in the wall of hollow organs, epithelial and endothelial cells), b) cells that have high rates of proliferation (e.g., myoblasts), and c) cells that are actively migrating (e.g., fibroblasts and macrophages). Therefore, the tissue distributions of calponin 2 imply its potential role in regulating cytoskeleton functions and cell motility.  Interaction with other proteins  thumb559x559px Figure 2. Proteins interacting with calponin. Calponin binds actin filaments through two actin-binding sites (ABS1 and ABS2), tropomyosin via the N-terminal CH domain, and gelsolin via the region of actin-binding sites. Calponin interacts with microtubules through the region including the actin-binding sites and the repeating motifs and with desmin through the region from N-terminal domain to the end of actin-binding sites. The segment of amino acids 144-182 in calponin interacts with myosin. In the presence of Ca2+, calmodulin and S100 bind calponin at the region of actin- binding sites and reverse calponin’s inhibition of myosin MgATPase. An N-terminal 22-kDa fragment of calponin interacts with phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol. *The interaction between calponin and caldesmon is controversial. In vitro protein binding studies have demonstrated that calponin binds actin and cross-links actin filaments. Calponin also binds tropomyosin, tubulin, desmin, Ca2+-calmodulin, Ca2+-S100, myosin, and phospholipids. Calponin also interacts with caldesmon and a-actinin, which however may only reflect their co-localization on actin filaments. The variable C-terminal segment regulates actin-binding affinity, and calponin 2 is shown to have the lowest affinity for F-actin among the three isoforms.  Function = Cell proliferation  Significant amounts of calponin 2 are found in growing smooth muscle tissues such as embryonic stomach and urinary bladder as well as the uterus during early pregnancy. The expression of calponin 2 decreases to lower levels in quiescent adult smooth muscle cells while the expression of calponin 1 is up-regulated. Transfective over- expression of calponin 2 inhibited cell proliferation. A hypothesis is that higher level of calponin 2 is required in fast proliferating cells to maintain the dynamic equilibrium of the actin cytoskeleton.  Cell motility  Primary fibroblasts and peritoneal macrophages isolated from Cnn2 knockout mice migrate faster than that of wild type control cells. Calponin 2 may affect cell migration differently in different cell types and in different biological processes. A study showed that forced expression of calponin 2 in endothelial cells enhanced angiogenic cell migration in vivo and anti-sense calponin 2 RNA reduced chemotaxis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells in culture. A hypothesis is that a proper level of calponin 2 may be required to maintain the physiological motility of different cell types in different biological processes. Calponin 2’s regulation of cell motility is based on inhibition of actin activated myosin motor function, as fibroblasts isolated from Cnn2 knockout mice showed increased cell traction force generated by myosin II motors.  Cell adhesion  A significant level of calponin 2 is found in human and mouse platelets. Platelet adhesion is a critical step in blood coagulation and thrombosis. In a microfluidic flow-based thrombosis assay, the time to initiation of rapid platelet/thrombus accumulation was significantly longer in blood samples from Cnn2 knockout versus wild type mice. The effect of calponin 2 on facilitating the velocity of cell adhesion was also shown with prostate cancer cells expression high or low levels of calponin 2.  Immune cells  Significant amounts of calponin 2 are found in blood cells of myeloid lineage. Monocytes derived from Cnn2 gene knockout mice proliferated faster than wild type control cells. Calponin 2-null macrophages migrated faster and exhibit enhanced phagocytosis. In global as well as myeloid cell-specific Cnn2 knockout mice, the development of inflammatory arthritis induced by anti-glucose-6-phosphate isomerase serum was significantly attenuated as compared with that in wild type mice . Deletion of calponin 2 in macrophages also significantly attenuated the development of atherosclerosis lesions in apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE-/-) mice  Regulation by mechanical tension = Gene expression  The expression of calponin 2 is significantly increased in cells cultured on hard versus soft gel substrates that produce high or low traction force and cytoskeleton tension. The expression of calponin 2 in NIH/3T3 cells was decreased when cytoskeleton tension was reduced after blebbstatin inhibition of myosin II motors. To demonstrate the Cnn2 promoter-specific regulation, transfective expression of calponin 2 using a cytomegalovirus promoter was independent of the stiffness of culture substrate. A binding site for transcriptional factor HES-1 (hairy and enhancer of split 1) has been identified in the 5’-upstream region of mouse Cnn2 promoter, responsible for the mechanical regulation. HES-1 is known to function downstream of the Notch-RBP J signaling pathway, which has been suggested to mediate cellular mechanoregulations. Deletion or mutation of the HES-1 site abolished the mechanical regulation and resulted in a substrate stiffness independent high level of transcription. Therefore, the regulatory mechanism is a low tension-induced repression. Corresponding to the down-regulation of Cnn2 gene expression, the level of HES-1 increased in cells cultured on soft gel substrate in comparison with that in cells cultured on hard substrates.  Degradation  Calponin 2 is also regulated by mechanical tension at the protein level. A rapid and selective degradation of calponin 2 occurs in lung tissues after a short period of deflation. This low cytoskeleton tension-induced degradation of calponin 2 in collapsed lung was completely prevented in post mortem mouse lung simply by air inflation to maintain tension applied to the alveolae. The cytoskeleton tension-dependent stability of calponin 2 was further confirmed in monolayer cells cultured on expanded elastic membrane by its rapid degradation after a reduction of the dimension of the cultural substrate to acutely reduce cytoskeleton tension.

It is constructed from quarried chalk. Designed and built by architect Edwin Lutyens between 1901 and 1905, it is a Grade I listed building. The gardens, designed by Lutyens and Gertrude Jekyll, are Grade II* listed in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. House=Construction Ground floor plan, 1921 (North front at bottom) Lutyens built Marshcourt for Herbert \\"Johnnie\\" Johnson, a trader/stockjobber on the London Stock Exchange, where he had accumulated a fortune of half a million pounds. He bought a hillside site overlooking the River TestBrown (1996), p. 119. (on a ridge above a much older manor house in the valley bottom, Marsh Court Manor), and approached Lutyens after seeing his work portrayed in Country Life. They became lifelong friends.Brown (1982), p. 72. The house was built on the hillside, out of locally-quarried chalk cut as ashlar,Ridley (2002), pp. 145–6. known as clunch. Lutyens interspersed pieces of black flint and red tiles in the masonry.Amery (1981), pp. 106–7. The exterior design of the house is Tudor, with mullioned and transomed windows,Lloyd and Pevsner (1973), pp. 312–3. and twisted brick chimneys. \\"Elizabethan bricks\\" were supplied by the Daneshill Brick and Tile Company, an enterprise set up by another Lutyens client, Walter Hoare.Brown (1996), pp. 136–7. The north, entrance front on the higher ground is two-storey, in an E-plan with the facades displaying predominantly horizontal lines. The south, garden front is taller, less symmetrical, and with emphatic vertical lines. The west end of the south front is dominated by chimney stacks. At the east end of the south front, a wing projects forward, enclosing a service courtyard. neoclassical hall, 1921 Internally, a long corridor runs east to west, with the main rooms all south-facing. The interior design is neoclassical.Wilhide (2012), p. 32. The oak-panelled hall features two friezes carved in chalk, with classical festoons. The dining room is panelled in walnut veneer. Ceilings have highly decorative plasterwork.Wilhide (2012), pp. 149–52. There are chalk fireplaces and even a chalk billiard table. Lutyens also designed the light fittings.Gradidge (1981), pp. 112–3. Wartime use In the First World War, Marshcourt became a 60-bed military hospital, run by Johnson's wife, a local widow who had been known as Violet Meeking before their marriage in 1912, and had been born Violet Fletcher.Skelton (2008), p. 80. She also ran a military hospital in Stockbridge. In 1919, Herbert Johnson instigated the construction of the Grade II listed Stockbridge War Memorial, designed by Lutyens and unveiled in 1921 by Violet Johnson, and King's Somborne War Memorial, also designed by Lutyens, unveiled in 1921 and Grade II listed. Violet Charlotte Johnson was awarded an MBE, for her services in the care of wounded soldiers, but died in 1921. Lutyens designed her Grade II listed memorial in Winton Hill cemetery, Stockbridge. Later years In 1924–6,Richardson (1981), p. 193. Lutyens added a ballroom to the southeast corner of the house, in the same architectural style. Johnson later installed a full-size organ there.Brown (1996), p. 240. In 1932, after falling on hard times Johnson sold Marshcourt for £60,000, having paid £150,000 originally.Ridley (2002), p. 383. It later became a preparatory school,Brown (1982), p. 165. known as Marsh Court School. In 1993 Marshcourt was bought by the Belgian car importer Joska Bourgeois for £630,000. Bourgeois allowed the British businessman and politician Geoffrey Robinson to appear as the owner of the house, he would eventually inherit it after Bourgeois' death, some eight months later. Robinson sold Marshcourt in 1999 to its present owners.Country Life, May 3, 2007 Gardens The sunken pool garden, 1914 Gardens with terraces, pools and pergolas surround the house, connected by paths paved in stone inset with herringbone pattern brickwork panels. Main gardens include the Piazza, a lawned area immediately to the south of the house, with a central sundial, and a sunken pool garden adjacent to the Piazza to its west. There are extensive views from a west- facing loggia over the Piazza and the sunken garden towards the Test valley,Brown (1982), pp. 72–7. an arrangement similar to an earlier Lutyens work, Orchards in Surrey, and other Lutyens houses.Brown (1982), pp. 105–8. The sunken garden has a rectangular pool containing a dolphin fountain and surrounded by concentric stone steps and flowerbeds. It is Grade II* listed. Sculptures of seahorses and tortoises around the pool were created by Julia Chance, the owner of Orchards.Tankard (2004), pp. 121–2.

The CNN3 gene is located at 1p22-p21 in the human chromosomal genome. CNN3 gene contains 7 exons and encodes calponin 3, a 36.4-kDa protein consisting of 329 amino acids with isoelectric point (pI) of 5.84. Calponin 3 is known as acidic calponin. Among three isoforms of calponin, less is known for the gene regulation and function of calponin 3. Nonetheless, much has been learned from extensive studies on the homologous genes CNN1 and CNN2 that encode calponin 1 and calponin 2.  Evolution  thumb382x382px Figure 1. Evolutionary lineage of vertebrate calponin 3 isoforms deduced from alignment of amino acid sequences. CNN3 is one of the three homologous calponin isoform genes. Calponin 3 is significantly diverged from calponin 1 and calponin 2 in the C terminal variable region. The higher degree of divergence among vertebrate CNN3 genes than that in the CNN1 and CNN2 gene families suggests possibly earlier emergence of CNN3, indicating that calponin 3 may represent a prototype of calponin ancestral of the three present-day isoforms (Fig. 1).  Structure-function relationships  The primary structure of calponin 3 is similar as that of calponin 1 and calponin 2, consisting of a conserved N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain, a conserved middle region containing two actin-binding sites, and a C-terminal variable region. The unique length amino acid sequence of the C-terminal segment of the three calponin isoforms are responsible for their size and overall charge differences. Calponin 3 has been shown to participate in actin cytoskeleton-based activities such as that in embryonic development and myogenesis. Unlike calponin 1, calponin 3 has little effect on actomyosin Mg2+-ATPase activity and does not cause actin filaments bundling at the same condition as calponin 1 does.  Tissue distribution  Calponin 3 is found in the brain with expression in neurons, astrocytes, and glial cells, where it may function in regulating the actin cytoskeleton with a proposed role in the plasticity of neural tissues. Calponin 3 is also present in embryonic trophoblasts and myoblasts with functions in cell fusion during embryonic development and myogenesis Calponin 3 is also expressed in B lymphocytes.  Function  Calponin 3 was found in stress fibers of skin fibroblasts and myofibroblasts during wound healing. Cnn3 knockdown in primary fibroblasts impaired stress fiber formation, resulting in decreased cell motility and contractile ability.> Calponin 3 in the brain has a potential function in regulating actin filaments during neuronal remodeling. Calponin 3 was also found in dendritic spines of adult hippocampal neurons to regulate dendritic spine plasticity. While mice with systemic knockout of Cnn1 or Cnn2, or both Cnn1 and Cnn2 survive to adulthood and fertile, systemic knockout of calponin 3 in mice results in embryonic and neonatal lethality due to defect in the development of central nervous system. CNN3 was found in the trophoblasts of human placenta and plays a role of negative regulator of trophoblast fusion. Knockdown or dissociation of calponin 3 from cytoskeleton in response to PKC phosphorylation promoted fusion of trophoblasts. Consistently, calponin 3 was also present in myoblasts as an inhibitory regulator of cell fusion. Overexpression of calponin 3 in mouse C2C12 myoblasts inhibited cell fusion during in vitro differentiation, whereas Cnn3 gene knockdown promoted cell fusion and the expression of skeletal muscle myosin. The inhibitory effect of calponin 3 was reversed upon phosphorylation by Rho-associated kinase 1/2 (ROCK1/2).

It is a concept that is used in an effort to improve the efficiency and reliability of the power system, pointing towards a more intelligent and interactive future for the energy industry. Transactive energy promotes a network environment for distributed energy nodes as opposed to the traditional hierarchical grid structure. The network structure allows for communication such that all levels of energy generation and consumption are able to interact with one another, a concept that is also known as interoperability. In transactive energy, interoperability refers to the ability of involved systems to connect and exchange energy information while maintaining workflow and utility constraints. The network is exponentially more complex than traditional control of generating sources because the demand side of the grid offers millions points of control in contrast with an average 10 to 20 power plant points of control on the supply side. Europe-based Efforts=Energy Flexibility Platform and Interface (EF-Pi) The goal of the Energy Flexibility Platform and Interface (EF-Pi) approach is to decouple Smart Grid services from the customer appliances. This opens up the markets and gives the customer freedom of choice in Smart Grid services. The End user should be able to combine it with all the connected appliances he already owns in his house, without losing control and ownership. The EF-Pi is an open-source software platform that runs on low-power hardware located at a convenient place in the building. The EF-Pi communicates directly with smart appliances inside the building. The EF-Pi has an easy to use interface, which the end user can use to configure and control his own appliances and get insight in how his appliances are functioning. The core of the EF-Pi is the Energy Flexibility Interface (EFI). The EFI is a generic interface which appliance manufacturers can use to describe energy flexibility, and which Smart Grid service developers can use to describe how they want to use this flexibility. The EFI effectively provides a common language for both sides, facilitating interoperability between all Smart Grid services and smart appliances. United States-based Efforts=Pacific Northwest Demonstration Project The Pacific Northwest Demonstration Project is a 5-year U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) funded research and development project created for the purpose of exploring transactive energy concepts at the regional scale that was completed in June 2015. The project participants included 11 utilities, two universities, and multiple technology companies to span five Pacific Northwest states: Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. The project evaluated 55 different technologies that could help reduce energy use and power bills, including smart meters, advanced energy storage, and voltage controls. It also tested and determined the potential benefits of transactive controls within a regional power grid. Transactive control is a technology developed by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) that entails \\"automatic, electronic transactions between energy providers and users about whether or not to sell or buy power.\\" In order to test this, transactive signals were used that would exchange information about predicted price and availability of power in real-time. This information was updated every 5 minutes. When peak power demand was predicted, the transactive control was designed to reduce power use. The project confirmed that transactive control technology works and can help improve energy efficiency and reliability, as well as reduce energy cost and encourage renewable energy usage. Public involvement was determined as a key parameter for smart grid deployment. Participants of the project emphasized the importance of customer engagement when new technologies are being implemented.Platform for a Modern Grid: Engaging the Customer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBaV8Zu6Dr0 The results of the project defined the next steps for implementing and improving transactive energy technologies. Several of the project participants have decided to continue smart grid programs on their own, even though the demonstration project is now complete, and new projects have also arisen from the results of the demonstration. GridSMART Demonstration Project The gridSMART® Demonstration Project was implemented by AEP Ohio from 2009 to 2013. The project tested various new technologies for smart grid implementation on a local level including smart meters, distribution automation, volt-var optimization, consumer programs, plug-in electric vehicles, and smart appliances. AEP utilized Grid Command, a tool that was developed in partnership with Battelle in order to model much of the gridSMART circuit layout. The next steps for the next phase of gridSMART were identified to be upgrading current technologies in order to better manage supply, reduce costs, and minimize the number of customers affected by outages. This has been proposed through the installation of smart meter technology, distribution automation circuit reconfiguration (DACR), and volt var optimization (VVO). Testing included SMART Shift, a time-of-day rate plan that helps customers save money by load shifting and SMART Cooling, an air- conditioning technology that helps reduce peak demand in the summer. During the project, eView was developed to assist customers in monitoring their electric use and costs as well as estimating current month usage to measure against their energy budget. eView< is an in-home device that communicates with the smart meter through wireless technology and informs the consumer of the price of electricity and how much was being used. The project helped AEP Ohio in determining what methods and solutions would best help the company move forward in the growing industry. It was emphasized that customer experience and feedback is a very valuable and effective method of learning how to deliver electricity efficiently to customers. NIST Transactive Energy Challenge The NIST Transactive Energy (TE) Challenge was designed to bring together researchers, companies, utilities and other grid stakeholders in order to explore the modeling and simulation platforms of TE, and the techniques that may be used to apply TE to real grid problems. This challenge is intended to encourage and promote the development of modeling and simulation tools for transactive energy, as well as the development of a transactive energy community in which organizations and individuals can work together to share data and knowledge in order to cooperatively advance transactive energy. It will demonstrate various transactive energy approaches and how it may improve the reliability and efficiency of the electric grid. Various teams were formed to explore different pathways for TE: *Business/Regulatory Models led by Edison Electric Institute (EEI) *Reference Grids and Scenarios for TE Simulation led by National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) * TE Demo for Microgrid Energy Management * TE Interoperations and Abstract Interaction led by Navigant and Energy Mashup Lab The NIST TE Challenge is expected to be completed in September 2016.  Standards  There are no current global standards to facilitate transactive energy. In the United States, the IEEE has a working group called P825 — Meshing Smart Grid Interoperability Standards to Enable Transactive Energy Networks to develop transactive energy guidelines.

Her noted work in trying to determine what constitutes \\"normal\\" gut bacteria, led to her creation of the UniFrac algorithm, used by researchers to plot the relationships between microbial communities in the human body. Biography Catherine A. Lozupone earned a Bachelor of Science from Villanova University in 1997 and went on to obtain a master's degree from Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado in 1999. She went on to complete her doctoral work at the University of Colorado Boulder studying under Rob Knight, who is the founder of the American Gut Project. At the time of her doctoral research, little was known about the microbiome (genes of the bacteria, archaea, microscopic eukaryotes, and viruses interacting in an environment) of the gut and the symbiotic relationship between host and bacteria. Her thesis delineated the UniFrac algorithm which has allowed researchers to visualize the relationships between microbial communities in the human gut, how they interact, and how they might be related to specific diseases. Lozupone's work, detailed in a 2012 paper which appeared in Nature entitled \\"Diversity, Stability and Resilience of the Human Gut Microbiota\\", was noted for its attempt to analyze what is the \\"normal\\" bacterial state in the human gut. By approaching the gut as an ecosystem, scientists are then able to factor in the effects of lifestyle, diet, health status which might change the bacterial makeup present in the gastrointestinal tract. In 2013, after completing her post-doctoral research in Knight's lab, Lozupone started her own lab at the University of Colorado Denver, where she works in the Department of Medicine as an associate professor. She has begun evaluating the composition differences in the microbiome of healthy individuals versus those of HIV positive individuals. She is attempting to determine if T cell loss causes change in the bacteria levels, thus prompting chronic inflammation for people living with HIV.

Patrons may also remotely access a variety of online databases. Architecture and history The library is located on the south side of Main Street, in the eastern part of Grafton's village center. It is in a 2-1/2 story wood frame house, with a gable roof, clapboard siding, and a granite foundation. It is roughly rectangular, set parallel to the street, with a five bay facade that has an entrance at its center. The building's main entrance, however, is on the building's eastern facade, which features a two-story portico underneath an extension of the main roof, with polygonal columns as support, and a wrought iron railing on the second floor. The building's cornices and gable rakes are studded with scrolled modillions. An older 1-1/2 story ell extends to the south. The oldest portion of the house, a portion of its ell, may have been standing on the property when it was purchased by John Butterfield in 1811, as it exhibits Federal period styling and workmanship. The main block of the house achieved its present appearance in the 1860s, having possibly been built as a 1-1/2 story Cape style house by Butterfield and then had a second floor added. The styling, a combination of Greek Revival and Italianate features, is not unusual for houses of the 1860s in Vermont. The house has served as the town library since the 1950s.

The CNN1 gene is located at 19p13.2-p13.1 in the human chromosomal genome and contains 7 exons, encoding the protein calponin 1, an actin filament-associated regulatory protein. Human calponin 1 is a 33.2-KDa protein consists of 297 amino acids with an isoelectric point of 9.1, thus calponin 1 is also known as basic calponin. Evolution 400x400px Three homologous genes, Cnn1, Cnn2 and Cnn3, have evolved in vertebrates, encoding three isoforms of calponin: calponin 1, calponin 2, calponin 3, respectively. Protein sequence alignment shows that calponin 1 is highly conserved in mammals but more diverged among lower vertebrates. Smooth muscle-specific expression The expression of CNN1 is specific to differentiated mature smooth muscle cells, suggesting a role in contractile functions. Calponin 1 is up-regulated in smooth muscle tissues during postnatal development with a higher content in phasic smooth muscle of the digestive tract. Structure- function relationship thumb534x534pxFigure 2. Structural and functional domains of calponin. The linear structural map summarized primarily from studies of chicken calponin 1 illustrates the structural and functional domains of calponin. The CH domain, two actin-binding sites, three repeating sequence motifs, and the C-terminal variable region are outlined. The CH domain overlaps with the ERK signaling binding region. Amino acid sequences of the two actin-binding sites in the three isoforms and the three repeating motifs of calponin 1 are shown in the insets. The regulatory phosphorylation sites Ser175 and Thr184 are located in the second actin-binding site that overlaps with the first repeating motif. Potentially phosphorylatable serine residues corresponding to Ser175 are conserved in repeats 2 and 3, while a Thr184 equivalent is conserved in repeat 2. Different from calponin 1 and calponin 3, calponin 2 has a potentially phosphorylatable additional serine at position 177. The majority of structure-function relationship studies of calponin were with experiments using chicken calponin 1. Primary structure of calponin consists of a conserved N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain, a conserved middle region containing two actin-binding sites, and a C-terminal variable region that contributes to the differences among there isoforms. The CH domain The CH domain was found in a number of actin-binding proteins (such as α-actinin, spectrin, and filamin) to form the actin-binding region or serve as a regulatory structure. However, the CH domain in calponin is not the binding site for actin nor does it regulate the modes of calponin- F-actin binding. Nonetheless, CH domain in calponin was found to bind to extra-cellular regulated kinase (ERK) for calponin to play a possible role as an adaptor protein in the ERK signaling cascades. Actin-binding sites Calponin binds actin to promote and sustain polymerization. The binding of calponin to F-actin inhibits the MgATPase activity of smooth muscle myosin. Calponin binds F-actin through two sites at residues 144-162 and 171-188 in chicken calponin 1. The two actin-binding sites are conserved in the three calponin isoforms. There are three repeating sequence motifs in calponin next to the C-terminal region. This repeating structure is conserved in all three isoforms and across species. Outlined in Fig. 2, the first repeating motif overlaps with the second actin-binding site and contains protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation sites Ser175 and Thr184 that are not present in the first actin-binding site. This feature is consistent with the hypothesis that the second actin-binding site plays a regulatory role in the binding of calponin to the actin filament. Similar sequences as well as potential phosphorylation sites are present in repeats 2 and 3 whereas their function is unknown. C-terminal variable region The C-terminal segment of calponin has diverged significantly among the three isoforms. The variable lengths and amino acid sequences of the C-terminal segment produce the size and charge differences among the calponin isoforms. The corresponding charge features rendered calponin 1, 2 and 3 the names of basic, neutral and acidic calponins. The C-terminal segment of calponin has an effect on weakening the binding of calponin to F-actin. Deletion of the C-terminal tail strongly enhanced the actin-binding and bundling activities of all three isoforms of calponin. The C-terminal tail regulates the interaction with F-actin by altering the function of the second actin-bing site of calponin. Regulation of smooth muscle contractility Numerous in vitro experimental data indicate that calponin 1 functions as an inhibitory regulator of smooth muscle contractility through inhibiting actomyosin interactions. In this regulation, binding of Ca2+-calmodulin and PKC phosphorylation dissociate calponin 1 from the actin filament and facilitate smooth muscle contraction. In vivo data also support the role of calponin 1 as regulator of smooth muscle contractility. While aortic smooth muscle of adult Wistar Kyoto rats, which naturally lacks calponin 1, is fully contractile, it has a decreased sensitivity to norepinephrine activation. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 proteolysis of calponin 1 resulted in vascular hypocontractility to phenylephrine. Vas deferens smooth muscle from calponin 1 knockout mice showed faster maximum shortening velocity. Calponin 1 knockout mice exhibited blunted MAP response to phenylephrine administration. Phosphorylation regulation There is a large collection of in vitro evidences demonstrating the phosphorylation regulation of calponin. The primary phosphorylation sites are Ser175 and Thr184 in the second actin-binding site (Fig. 2). Experimental data showed that Ser175 and Thr184 in calponin 1 are phosphorylated by PKC in vitro. Direct association was found between calponin 1 and PKCα and PKCε. Calmodulin-dependent kinase II and Rho-kinase are also found to phosphorylate calponin at Ser175 and Thr184 in vitro. Of these two residues, the main site of regulatory phosphorylation by calmodulin-dependent kinase II and Rho-kinase is Ser175. Dephosphorylation of calponin is catalyzed by type 2B protein phosphatase Unphosphorylated calponin binds to actin and inhibits actomyosin MgATPase. Ser175 phosphorylation alters the molecular conformation of calponin and dissociates calponin from F-actin. The consequence is to release the inhibition of actomyosin MgATPase and increase the production of force. Despite the overwhelming evidence for the phosphorylation regulation of calponin obtained from in vitro studies, phosphorylated calponin is not readily detectable in vivo or in living cells under physiological conditions. Based on the observation that PKC phosphorylation of calponin 1 weakens the binding affinity for the actin filaments, the phosphorylated calponin may not be stable in the actin cytoskeleton thus be degraded in the cell.

Suspected by security forces of playing a role in numerous killings, including the Sean Graham shooting, he was shot dead by the Irish Republican Army on the Ormeau Road in 1994. Early life A native of Belfast, Elder grew up in the Annadale Flats, an Ulster loyalist area in South Belfast close to the Ormeau Road.Cusack & McDonald, p. 224 Although some individual districts in the Ormeau Road were divided along sectarian lines there were no peace lines, several mixed streets and the main road was frequented by both Protestants and Catholics. As such, Elder knew many Catholics and in his youth was involved in sectarian bullying and street fights before he graduated to UDA membership.Cusack & McDonald, p. 184 He was nicknamed \\"Snowy\\" on account of his blond hair.Lister & Jordan, p. 225 Ulster Defence Association Elder was the right-hand man of Joe Bratty, the officer in command of the UDA's south Belfast Brigade during the early 1990s, a period of intense UDA activity. He was charged in relation to the Sean Graham shooting on the lower Ormeau Road in 1992. He had been identified as one of the gunmen by numerous witnesses. Elder was charged for his involvement in the attack although all charges were dropped due to a lack of evidence.Lister & Jordan, p. 134 Elder was close personally to sometime UDA West Belfast Brigade leader Johnny Adair and sometimes partied with Adair's group of C Company associates at shebeens on the Shankill Road.Lister & Jordan, p. 117 Soon after the charges relating to the Sean Graham attack (which Adair had helped to plan) were dropped, Elder accompanied Adair to a UDA ceremony in Scotland where the West Belfast leader presented Elder with a gold ring inscribed with the letters \\"UFF\\" as a memento of the attack. Elder's unit, commanded by Joe Bratty, killed numerous Catholics in this period, including Michael GilbrideMcDonald & Cusack, 2004, p. 238 and Teresa Clinton, the wife of a local Sinn Féin councillor in the lower Ormeau district.McDonald & Cusack, 2004, p. 255 Death On 31 July 1994, Elder was shot dead along with Joe Bratty by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). Two men armed with AK-47 assault rifles leapt from a van that was parked in front of their car and fired at Elder and Bratty. The getaway car was pursued by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in an unmarked patrol car, who also fired shots, and brought to a halt at the bottom of Hatfield Street, where the police were surrounded by a crowd which allowed the gunmen and getaway driver to escape on foot. The two were known to drink at the same establishment every Sunday morning and had been observed by IRA members doing so, allowing the attack to be planned well in advance.McDonald & Cusack, pp. 269–270 Two of Bratty's cousins were also present at the attack but were not fired on. Reaction Contemporaneous graffiti celebrating the killings of Elder and Bratty, still extant in 2017. Lower Ormeau Road In the short-term the killing of Elder was greeted with relief, even by some nationalist residents of the Lower Ormeau normally opposed to violence. However, the aftermath saw three Catholics killed by the UDA in separate attacks with these sparking a series of IRA bomb attacks on loyalist bars, thus bringing about a temporary return to the spiral of tit-for-tat killing.McDonald and Cusack 2004, pp. 259–70 The killings of Bratty and Elder, along with that of Ulster Democratic Party (UDP) leader Ray Smallwoods earlier the same month, played a central role in delaying the Combined Loyalist Military Command (CLMC) ceasefire. The CLMC had been considering declaring a ceasefire following the shootings in Loughinisland, but reversed their decision after these three killings as they believed that any cessation of violence would have been seen by the IRA as a sign of weakness.Taylor 2004, p. 231 This was confirmed by the UDP's David Adams, who said the CLMC was ready to call a ceasefire in late June/early July 1994, although his party colleague Gary McMichael admitted the killings of Elder, Bratty and Smallwoods convinced him that an IRA ceasefire was near as he felt these were long-standing targets who were being killed before calling a halt to hostilities.Wood 2006, p. 189 Certain hardline elements with the UDA would later claim that Elder's killing had been sanctioned by members of the CLMC who were eager to see a ceasefire as Bratty had been an outspoken opponent of the initiative, although these allegations were never proven. Pastor Kenny McClinton, a dissident former UDA gunman who was variously associated with the Ulster Independence Movement, the Loyalist Volunteer Force and the Orange Volunteers, even suggested in a pamphlet that Elder's killing had been arranged by the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP). This was part of a wider theme in McClinton's writing arguing that the PUP was a front for MI5 activity.McDonald and Cusack 2004, p. 283 Elder and Bratty were commemorated in a wall plaque erected outside the Kimberley Bar. The pub, where the pair had been on the day they were killed, was known as a UDA stronghold in the area.Wood 2006, pp. 288–89 An August 2014 march commemorating the pair was condemned by both nationalist politicians and the Ulster Unionist Party after it ended with a ceremony in a Housing Executive-funded First World War garden of remembrance close to the Annadale Flats.

Kuri stated he wanted to make a manga like that when he grew up. This had an influence on his manga and anime character design style. He attended Kyoto Municipal Rakuyō High School (now Kyoto Municipal Rakuyō Technical High School), but left in 1958 before graduating in order to join his older brother Kenji in Tokyo to work as a manga artist. He worked as an assistant for his older brother Tatsuo, who was already a successful illustrator and manga artist. Kuri made his manga debut in 1959 with , published as an akahon and in the Japanese magazine Z-Boy from Shueisha. From 1960–1961, Kuri worked on with creator Minoru Kume. In 1962, Kuri co-founded the animation production company Tatsunoko Productions with his brothers Kenji and Tatsuo. Since then, he has worked in many different roles, including as an animation producer, in planning and design, and as a director. Kuri was appointed the managing director of Tatsunoko Pro subsidiary Anime Friend in 1977. In 1987, due to the retirement of his brother Kenji, Kuri became the president of Tatsunoko Pro. Anime Friend was dissolved in 1990. Tatsunoko Pro became a subsidiary of the major toy manufacturer Takara on July 1, 2005, and Kuri stepped down as president at that time. The Yoshida brothers' involvement in the company has since been very limited. At the 10th Animation Kobe event in October 2005, Kuri was awarded the special award for lifetime contributions to anime as a general producer at Tatsunoko Pro. Kuri is currently a guest professor at the Kyoto University of Arts and Crafts. Works Listed in chronological order.

Overview  An estimated 20-40% of youth have a psychiatric disorder, yet up to 80% of those in need do not receive mental health services. Preventing mental health problems and promoting healthy behavior among youth has become a critical policy issue. The Report of the Surgeon General’s Conference on Children’s Mental Health stated the importance of fostering a solid emotional foundation in children in order to facilitate learning.U.S. Public Health Service, 2000, p. 3 However, children and families face significant barriers to accessing and receiving community-based mental health services. As a result, schools have been identified as ideal avenues through which to reach youth. Universal prevention programs are offered to the general population, while selective prevention programs are intended for groups identified as at risk for developing a problem. This differentiates them from intervention or treatment programs, which are intended for individuals who already have a problem or meet criteria for a disorder.  Approaches  A number of school-based programs have been developed to target specific outcomes, including problems such as bullying, substance use, and antisocial behavior. Others have been developed to foster positive youth development and academic performance. While each of these programs focuses on distinct issues and outcomes, research suggests that in adolescent-focused initiatives, many utilize the same practice elements, including communication skills, problem solving, insight building, and assertiveness training. These results suggest that certain core skills may be critical to seemingly disparate desired outcomes, which may have implications for clinical decision making as well as policy. A meta-analysis of 213 school-based prevention programs promoting social and emotional learning (SEL) looked at outcomes in six different domains: social and emotional skills, attitudes toward self and others, positive social behaviors, conduct problems, emotional distress, and academic performance. Findings suggested that SEL programs had positive effects across all six domains, demonstrating the broad impact of universal school-based prevention programs  Challenges  While 59% of schools in the U.S. report having programs that foster children’s social and emotional needs, evidence-based initiatives have not been widely implemented. Schools may be unaware of the evidence base, reflecting the gap between research and practice. Schools that are aware of effective programs may lack funding necessary to implement the program. Should schools receive funding for implementation, research shows that programs are often poorly implemented, resulting in low fidelity and weak outcomes. Additionally, some prevention programs may not be a good fit with the local context and may require tailoring. Finally, schools may struggle to sustain programs due to limited resources.  Implementation strategies  While there are significant challenges to implementing evidence-based prevention programs into school settings, there are strategies to increase the success of introducing and sustaining such programs. These strategies include assigning highly committed individuals as project directors or coordinators; encouraging support and cooperation from school administrators, community members and principals; motivating and gaining the support and enthusiasm of teachers; training which will provide knowledge, skills, and desire to continue further; retraining a few years after to reinforce knowledge and continue the commitment of the teacher or school; and gathering feedback to provide instructors with how to improve their skills. Properly implemented programs are likelier to have good outcomes, which may incentivize policymakers to allocate more funding to these initiatives. Including explicit cost-benefit analysis should be considered when designing programs. Having more structure in the program and implementation process - from training to materials to supervision - may also be beneficial and lead to sustainment.

The Accounts were written by the chaplain (or \\"Ordinary\\") of Newgate Prison, recounting the statements made by the condemned during confession. Over 400 editions were published, containing biographies of some 2,500 executed criminals. William Hogarth – Industry and Idleness, Plate 11; The Idle 'Prentice Executed at Tyburn Although target of many objections and criticism during the 18th century, since much of their contents can be verified from external sources, if carefully used the Accounts provide an important source of knowledge on many aspects of 18th century English history. All surviving accounts relating to convicts tried at sessions of the Old Bailey court and published under the name of the Ordinary of Newgate can be consulted on the Old Bailey Proceedings Online website.  Form of the Accounts  The external form of the Accounts underwent several changes during the century, in its size, format and layout. In only twenty years, from something close to a broadside they became a small pamphlet, indicating both consolidation as a specific genre and the permission given by the City Officials. They were published at the price of 2 or 3 pence as folio broadsheets until 1712, when they were expanded to six folio pages. During the 1720s the type size was reduced and a third column was added. By 1734 they comprised sixteen or twenty-eight quarto pages and they were sold for 4 or 6 pence. On the other hand, the internal form of the Accounts remained almost unchanged through the century. They were divided into five sections: the first contained the basic facts of the trial, its date, the magistrates present at the trial, the members of the two juries and a summary of the proceedings; the second offered the synopsis of the sermon given by the Ordinary and cited the biblical texts from which he preached to the condemned; the third can be divided in two, its first part a description of the life of the condemned with vital information, and its second part a summary of his conversations with the Ordinary regarding his crimes; the fourth was composed of various items, sometimes narratives supposedly written by the condemned themselves, a brief essay on some topic like smuggling that the Ordinary or his printer thought appropriate, or copies of letters sent to the condemned; the fifth was a recount of the events of the hanging itself, the psalms sung and the condition of the condemned or his potential attempts to escape. In the early 18th century they included advertisements, which appeared less often in the 1720s.  Main purposes = Judicial value  Since at the time the administration of justice depended on private prosecutions, the Accounts could lead to valuable judicial discoveries, for instance the names of potential accomplices. Information obtained from confessions was given to the authorities by the Ordinary, who sometimes took an active role in arranging the return of stolen goods to robbery victims. The Accounts also had the power to legitimate the Court's decision, seeking positive statements of guilt to a particular crime, and to justify the hanging with life stories filled with a general range of immoral conduct.  Moral value  The Accounts, even more than other criminal biographies, had the purpose of teaching readers about the wages of sin and often follow a similar pattern that can be called a 'Sinner to saint' type of biography. They took the form of inverted parabolas, recounting the protagonist's descent from immorality to criminality, from minor delinquencies and skipping church to a life of crime. The condemned, brought in front of the Ordinary, confesses in detail his wrongdoings, repents and welcomes death hoping for salvation after having set an example for the audience. Accepting the judgment of the jury, coming to terms with their guilt and confessing their crimes led the criminals to a sort of reintegration into society, working as a repayment of their debts to the community and a preparation for salvation. The confession was for contemporaries indispensable as proof of sincerity of one’s repentance and as a rigorous self-examination which was the necessary precondition of spiritual regeneration. Most believed that whoever died without acknowledging his crimes was damned. The gallows scene was a moment of public reconciliation and mutual forgiveness as well: the condemned participated actively in his execution, healing the fractures in the spiritual and social order caused by his sins and crime. Those who weren't able to attend the hanging could still participate thanks to the Ordinary's Account.  Spiritual importance and the 'Everyman' criminal  In the late 17th and 18th century, the last dying words and behaviour of the condemned had a profound metaphysical and political significance. The general idea and principle of the confessional genre was that dying men did not lie. The Accounts presented the most compelling truth claims, speaking to the spiritual state and eternal prospects not only of the condemned but of the reader too, asking the audience to place themselves in the shoes of the criminal. The condemned was presented in the light of a universal and generic sinner, the 'Everyman': the public sinner, the criminal, was different from the private sinner, the reader, only in degree not in kind. The Accounts presented themselves as a mirror, a looking glass for young Gentlemen and Gentlewomen, a seamark to all the readers so that they could avoid the fatal rocks of Sin, because even the best of men could find himself deep amidst death-threatening dangers. The dangers and temptations of sin were faced by all men, including readers, and suggested that salvation was available to all.  Value for the Ordinary  The Accounts were frequently used by the Ordinaries to refute personal slights and display their diligence and efforts. They stressed their manly fortitude and the firm manner in which they confronted the most hardened malefactors, repeatedly reminding the reader of their constant visits to the condemned in spite of their poor health and of the epidemic typhus which was common in 18th century prisons. They tended to exaggerate the bad behaviour of the criminals to emphasise how much they improved under the Ordinaries' care. Ordinaries were also anxious to be seen to discriminate between true repentance and a too superficial and transitory last-minute deathbed repentance; they often expressed doubts regarding the sincerity of the condemned repentance.  The Ordinary and his office  The Ordinary of Newgate was the Newgate Prison chaplain. He was always a clergyman of the Established Church and was appointed by the Court of Aldermen of the City of London. The Court often issued orders to better define the Ordinary's duties, due to his neglect or absence. Newgate Prison, Inner Court, 18th century. Wellcome L0001330 The Ordinary read prayers, preached and instructed the prisoners, but his most important duty was to attend upon those condemned to die: he made special arrangements to give them the sacrament, delivered to them and those who paid for seats the condemned sermon in the prison chapel, rode with them to Tyburn, and led the condemned and the crowd in the singing of hymns on the hanging site. The income from the office of the Ordinary was irregular in both forms and payment. He received a salary of £35 and two, three or four 'freedoms' to the city each year (which could be sold for about £25 each) from the City of London, earned from interests on various bequests and his house on Newgate Street was clear of the land tax. But he had other opportunities of profit beside his salary and usual gifts: several Ordinaries exploited their position to publish religious guides and individual recounts of lives of notorious malefactors. Evidence suggests that the income from the Accounts must have been substantial too: many criminals refused to confess their crimes on the grounds that the Ordinary would profit from them, and in one of the Ordinary's Accounts one Charles Brown alluded to how every number of the Accounts earned him £25, which the Ordinary did not deny. Due to his office, the Ordinary could be placed between the judge, who sentenced to death, and the hangman, who carried out the sentence: his task was to justify the decisions of the former and to confer Christian sanction to the work of the latter. The Ordinary's office was also invested with spiritual importance by the contemporaries, importance testified by the frequency and vehemence of the attacks on the prison chaplain.  List of Ordinaries from 1676 to 1799  Hereunder is a list of the Ordinaries who regularly published the Accounts during the 17th and 18th centuries. * Samuel Smith, Ordinary from 15 June 1676 until 24 August 1698. He is the first Ordinary to publish regular accounts of confessions, behaviour and last speeches of the condemned in Newgate Prison. His son officiated between Smith's death and the appointment of his successor. * John Allen, Ordinary from 10 October 1698 until 30 May 1699. He was dismissed for corruption, extortion and 'undue practises'. * Roger Wykes, Ordinary from June 1700, officiated only for a few months until his death in October of the same year. * Paul Lorrain, Ordinary from 7 November 1700 until his death on 10 October 1719. He converted the Accounts in a profitable publication through the addition of advertisements, which under him became a periodical and semi-official publication. He printed his sermons and biographies of famous malefactors as well, and translated comprendia and funeral rites. Ordinary during the incarceration of Daniel Defoe in 1703, he's probably the object of Defoe's \\"A Hymn to the Funeral Sermon\\". Thomas Browne acted as temporary replacement between his death and the appointment of his successor. * Thomas Purney, Ordinary from 17 November 1719 until he ceased to act as Ordinary due to ill health in September 1725 and died on 14 November 1727. Born in Kent in 1695, he took the Holy Orders in 1718 and acquired the position in Newgate Prison through the intervention of the Bishop of Peterborough. Besides the Accounts he published volumes of pastoral poetry and was frequently object of satire, presumably because during his office many famous criminals were executed, such as Jack Sheppardand Jonathan Wild. During his leaves of absence for illness in the summer of 1724 and in the winter of 1724 and 1725, James Wagstaff officiated in his stead. * James Guthrie was officially instated as Ordinary on 19 February 1733/1734 but officiated from 29 September 1725 to 1746 since Purney left the care of Newgate Prison to him while he was in the country. Formerly he held curacy of Coleman Street and had been a schoolteacher of Latin. In 1746 the Court found him rendered incapable by his age and other infirmities and he was dismissed with an annual pension of £40. * Samuel Rossel, Ordinary from 17 June 1746 until he died on 12 March 1747. Formerly curate of St Giles, Cripplegate for twenty years. James Paterson officiated between his death and the appointment of the new Ordinary. * John Taylor, Ordinary from 12 July 1747 until 28 June 1757. He presented his resignation pleading his great debts. * Stephen Roe, Ordinary from 12 July 1757 until his death on 22 October 1764. * Joseph Moore, Ordinary from 20 November 1764 until his death on 20 June 1769. There are few of his Accounts after 1765, maybe suggesting that it was briefly discontinued in this period.[3] * John Wood, Ordinary from 18 July 1769 until he took a leave of absence in May 1774 and officially resigned in January 1774 due to ill health. During his office the Accounts are published sporadically. Silas Told, Methodist minister, officiated in Wood's absence. * John Villette, Ordinary from 8 February 1774 until 25 April 1799. He did not resume the regular publication the Accounts, but compiled the \\"Annals of Newgate\\" in 1776, a few pamphlets on the executions of famous malefactors and early in his office, between 1774 and 1775 provided accounts of confessions and speeches of the condemned to several newspapers.  Objections and attacks  The Accounts and the Ordinary had an almost universal bad press. The critics came not only from the condemned but from official channels too. Ordinaries were often accused on the newspapers by competing writers of criminal lives of fabricating the last dying speeches of the condemned and of manipulating their position to extract confessions from them. Paul Lorrain was accused of confessing the criminals for his economical profit and Purney was attacked for literary incompetence. Accusations of withholding the sacrament under the pretense of the criminals not being prepared but in reality with the goal to get an account of their lives and transactions were common. Even if some of the condemned were really compelled to confess sins which laid heavily on their conscience, most of them did so only to qualify for the sacrament, acknowledging a catalogue of general misdeeds and stopping short of admitting to more serious crimes, especially the one of which they were accused of for fear of jeopardising their chances of a reprieve. Most of the contemporaries' critics to the Ordinary reprimanded him not for his office or for being insensitive or too rigorous and persistent in obtaining confessions, but for slackness and negligence and for being too lax. 19th and 20th century commentators characterised him as morally lax, drunken and dissolute, an incompetent minister, weak and ineffectual, unable to exert any control over the condemned. Victorian and Edwardian writers conflate the Ordinary and his Accounts with the corruption and depravity of 18th century Church. We have proof of the corruption of some Ordinaries as well: Samuel Smith and John Allen were discharged by the Court of Aldermen for undue practices, such as fabricating false confessions and dying speeches, pocketing charitable donations and money sent to the condemned, soliciting bribes under the pretext of obtaining reprieves for the criminals. Modern scholars tend to view the Accounts as too sensational and scripted to constitute an accurate or reliable source, forgetting how they were the principal source of later publications generally assumed to be reliable, like the Newgate Calendar, and that they were a mainstream publication, beginning as a sister publication of the Proceedings.  Decline of the Accounts  The reasons for the declining success of the Accounts were several and of different nature. The Ordinary's morality was often perceived as dubious, because of the profit that the Accounts provided him and because of suspected corruption (he was often accused of bribing the condemned to have their confessions). Another cause would be the competition represented by not only other authors of accounts but by ministers of other denominations too, who could assist the condemned in prison. The notion of 'Everyman' criminal was declining, as well as the notion of the gallows as a sacred place in which the words and actions of the condemned were invested with metaphysical and political consequence. Tyburn tree  Decline of popular demand  In the 1760s there was a decline of popular demand for the confessional genre that could be connected to the crisis of the notion of 'Everyman' criminal. By the middle of the 18th century, there was a growing tendency to make explicit distinction between the condemned and the reader. The condemned was increasingly relegated to his social sphere; he was not seen as a sinner, someone to whom the audience could relate to, but as someone who came from an intellectually and morally inferior class. By the 1760s it was common for the Ordinary to put emphasis on grammatical and orthographic errors of the condemned and to apologise for having as subjects such mean individuals. The Ordinary frequently made claims that the condemned were creatures deserving of pity, suggesting that common criminals lacked the moral and intellectual faculties of the readers and so emphasising the distance between the reader and the condemned. The notion of the criminal as 'Everyman', morally no different from the audience, was then totally abandoned; the reader could comfort himself with the knowledge that he at least, unlike the criminal, was saved.  Reconfiguration of morality and Methodism  From the 17th century, the idea of rational religion and of the man as rational creature created by a reasonable benevolent and distant creature gradually came to replace the older pessimistic conception of mankind as frail and degenerate and the divinity as a vengeful and interventionist judge. Morality was increasingly internalised in the conscience of the rational individual, which was seen as the natural magistrate in every man's heart. The older Calvinistic emphasis on free grace was given new life in Methodist publications, preaching God's wonderful method of saving even the worst of sinners. It was viewed with suspicion and distrust by mid and late 18th century Anglican priests, since it carried with it the belief that salvation could be obtained without adherence to the moral law as delivered in the Ten Commandments. Men were not damned for the crimes they committed but for not believing in the great truths of the Gospel. If men had faith in the efficacy of Christ's sacrifice, they might be under no dread of what they did, because he stood clean before the eyes of God from the day in which Christ died upon the cross. At the same time, by the early 18th century, Anglican clergymen had increasingly more difficulty in justifying the traditional notion that one's final moments were of critical significance and that a good death could outweigh a less than exemplary life.  Religious toleration at Newgate Prison  The rise of effective religious toleration at Newgate brought the end of the Ordinary's monopoly over the confessions of the condemned. Many criminals took a functional approach to religion: numerous Catholics, dissenters and Jews were willing to conform to Anglican services. There was an almost universal desire to receive the sacrament, even if it was seen only as a charm, or passport to the next world. For the majority of 17th and 18th century prisoners, the Ordinary was the only means of obtaining that necessary passport, in exchange of their confessions. From 1735, ministers of other denominations were allowed to counsel the criminals by the Court of Aldermen. Most officials were willing to uphold the principle that criminals were entitled to be attended by a minister of their own communion at the place of execution. Because of that, Ordinaries found themselves unable to give any report of the lives of criminals who were under the care of another priest, especially in the case of Catholics, who didn't want the secrets of their confessions to be promulgated. Complains of other priests \\"poaching\\" the condemned confessions mounted over the course of the 18th century.  Verification  The contents of the Accounts can be for the most part verified from external sources. The same information regarding the trial (such as the nature of the offence, the date, the verdict and the sentence of the Court, specification of the goods stolen and their value in cases of theft) can be found in The Proceedings of the Old Bailey, in the Middlesex or London City's record offices and in parishes registers. The description of the trial is confirmed in all its particulars. The vital information included in the short biographies, the criminal's birthday, his birthplace and age, can be confirmed by the Proceedings and parish registers and there is external evidence regarding other miscellaneous facts like his religion, aliases used and potential reputation as a particular type of criminal as well. Finding corroboration of the criminal's work history is more difficult: since in the 18th century work relations underwent fundamental changes and much work was casual, seasonal or conducted outside of traditional juridical standards, written documents attesting work transactions are hard to come by. Still, where we can find some external evidence it confirms the condemned account. Speaking of the other extended narratives, it is certainly possible that some could have been written by the condemned themselves as stated by the Accounts. They provided an account of the crimes committed as single episodes without exterior framework of life or work that might place them in a casual order and with a great deal of details about every crime. Cant language (or Cant tongue) was often employed; born in spoken speech, it was a language used by criminals for the purpose of concealment and mutual recognition. Its presence makes it likely that whoever composed the narratives wrote them in close association with the criminal. The enjoyment in exposing techniques and in explaining particular types of thieving and the way in which the repenting tone that appears everywhere else in the Accounts is minimised are other characteristics which could point to a different author than the Ordinary. Where there are exaggeration, errors and embellishments we could attribute them to the bluster or self-deception of men speaking their last words before their execution. The contradictions between the Ordinary's and other accounts can be found in the differences of tone used; the real problem is not the Ordinary's imaginative power, but his credulity or sensitivity to the fantasies of criminals sentenced to die.

DAT/EM Systems International develops solutions for the photogrammetry, engineering & GIS industries. DAT/EM History In mid-1985, three Pacific Northwest photogrammetric firms combined resources to create DAT/EM Systems International based in Anchorage, Alaska. By the spring of 1987, DAT/EM Systems International had produced its first viable digital mapping product. The first product allowed AutoCAD software to accept 3D coordinate data input from an analog stereoplotter. A similar interface to MicroStation CAD software followed, as well as support for analytical stereoplotters. DAT/EM Systems immediately moved its stereoplotter interface and support services into the global marketplace and became a leader in the global digital photogrammetry industry. At the 1999 ASPRS Conference in Portland, Oregon, DAT/EM released its first all-digital stereoplotter, the Summit PC digital softcopy stereo workstation. Using the knowledge acquired from designing Summit PC, DAT/EM Systems moved forward to create its well-known 3D digital stereoplotter, Summit Evolution. In addition to working with the evolved forms of the AutoCAD and MicroStation interfaces, Summit Evolution is capable of 3D digitizing and editing with ESRI’s ArcGIS and Blue Marble Global Mapper products. This capability opened DAT/EM software products to the GIS marketplace. Because DAT/EM Systems offered client solutions for both their photogrammetric and GIS needs, this increased the number of users for the Summit Evolution softcopy system worldwide. Since 1985, DAT/EM had grown from a small Alaskan company to an international network of resellers including two independent sales and support branches: DAT/EM Systems Europe and DAT/EM Systems Indonesia. DAT/EM headquarters is still in Anchorage, Alaska. Public Recognition and Community Involvement In 1993, DAT/EM Systems International was awarded the Alaska International Exporter of the Year Award, now called the Alaska Governor's North Star Awards for International Excellence. The award is given to companies in the state of Alaska who have a large volume of worldwide distribution of goods. In 2014, DAT/EM Systems International won the award again for its contribution to Alaska and worldwide distribution of goods and services. In 2004, DAT/EM donated three Summit Evolution mapping systems to the University of Alaska Anchorage Geomatics Department in the School of Engineering to provide local students access to the best equipment and latest technologies. To recognize the donation, Chancellor Elaine Maimon held a celebration on Friday, April 22, 2005. The celebration was held in conjunction with the new BS Degree in Engineering Program at UAA. DAT/EM products and company overviews are found in several world publications. In 2014 alone, DAT/EM products and company articles have appeared in GeoSpatial World, GeoInformatics, xyHt Magazine and more.

Risks affecting organizations can have consequences in terms of economic performance and professional reputation, as well as environmental, safety and societal outcomes. Therefore, managing risk effectively helps organizations to perform well in an environment full of uncertainty. Earlier safety oriented risk management has today been developed into a comprehensive management approach to maximize opportunities and minimize threats. Contemporary management of risk ensures survival and sustainability in all activities concerning decision making at all levels of any organization. Therefore, effective and efficient risk management today is closely linked to business continuity management and to compliance management. Attitudes to risk still vary substantially around the world but 57 National Standards Organizations have adopted ISO 31000 as their national Standard for the management of risk.

She served the Bangladesh Navy for about nine years. Electronics The ship uses a Pot Head radar as primary electronics. It is a surface search radar which is effective in performing mine laying operations. For ASW operations, she uses Chinese SJD-3 telescoping high frequency active sonar. Instead of being fixed to the hull, SJD-3 has a telescoping arm, so when not in use, the sonar is stored in the hull, and when deployed, the sonar is lowered into water several meter below the hull, thus increasing the detection range by avoiding buffeting generated by the hull. Armament The primary armaments of the ship are two twin 57mm 70-cal Type 76 DP guns and two twin 25mm 60cal Type 61 guns. Besides these, she carries a variety of weapons to perform ASW missions.

He has been actively competing in international Quake competitions since February 24, 2006. Cypher was most notably the first one to win the QuakeCon 1v1 tournament four times (in 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014). He has been a champion of many other tournaments, including Electronic Sports World Cup, Intel Extreme Masters, Dreamhack and Asus Cups. Career Originally a Quake III Arena player, Yanushevsky gained prominence with successes in Eastern European competitions in Quake IV shortly after the game's release. At the age of 16 he successfully qualified for the Electronic Sports World Cup in his native Belarus and defeated twofold world champion Russian Anton \\"Cooller\\" Singov in Moscow competitions. He subsequently entered the Electronic Sports World Cup and was considered a dark horse contestant at the world championship, Yanushevsky eventually reached the finals of the event, where he was defeated, taking second place at the event at an age at which he was too young to enter Cyberathlete Professional League or World Series of Video Games competitions. Afterwards, Cypher was signed to professional video gaming team Fnatic. He made top five finishes at QuakeCon as well as the World Cyber Games. The following year he was one of the more successful players in international competition, taking 2nd and 3rd at two World Series of Video Games stops. After the World Series of Video Games disbanded mid-season, Yanushevsky started focusing primarily on Quake III again, which eventually culminated in victory at the Electronic Sports World Cup Masters in July, 2008. He was then signed to the team Serious Gaming. On August 3, 2008, Yanushevsky won the Quake Live 1v1 Championship at QuakeCon 2008 his second major title. On August 27 he won the Electronic Sports World Cup 2008. Cypher left Serious Gaming in December 2012. During this time he tried out the game Shootmania in Team Millenium, placing 3rd at the Cyberathlete Summit in Paris. In December 2013, Cypher beat Shane \\"Rapha\\" Hendrixson to win DreamHack Winter 2013. In July 2014 Cypher won his fourth QuakeCon, QuakeCon 2014, without losing a single map in the play-offs stage. During 2015, Cypher tried out Counter Strike: Global Offensive and achieved a good level, but as he was looking for a team, Overwatch came out in beta and he decided to play that instead. During 2016 he played Overwatch and also achieved a good level (his team ANOX was top 6 in Europe during the ESL Overwatch Atlantic Showdown, and top 16 in the world during the Overwatch Open), but again he had to switch games as he was starting to find his form, this time because of the announcement of Quake Champions, due to come out in 2017.

It is one of his most widely reproduced and exhibited paintings.  2015 sale  The painting realized $170,405,000 at a Christie's New York sale on 9 November 2015, a record for a Modigliani painting and placing it high among the most expensive paintings ever sold. The purchaser was the Chinese businessman Liu Yiqian.. Liu is believed to have paid for the painting using his American Express card.  Painting  The painting is one of a famous series of nudes that Modigliani painted in 1917 under the patronage of his Polish dealer Léopold Zborowski. It is believed to have been included in Modigliani's first and only art show in 1917, at the Galerie Berthe Weill, which was shut down by the police. Christie's lot notes for their November 2015 sale of the painting observed that this group of nudes by Modigliani served to reaffirm and reinvigorate the nude as a subject of modernist art.  Commentary  * The Guardian art critic Jonathan Jones notes that Modigliani continues the tradition of Titian's Venus of Urbino. That tradition of glorifying the human body infuses the sexuality of Modigliani's nude, reinvented a decade before by the paintings of Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse. Jones remarks that Modigliani was a religious artist and his religion was desire.

The intention was to shoot the special on location. In 2014, \\"The Musical Monsters of Turkey Hollow\\" was adapted into a graphic novel. When Turkey Hollow went into production, the original puppets in storage were refurbished by Jim Henson's Creature Shop with their designs updated by Robert Bennett (the winner of Jim Henson's Creature Shop Challenge) and Peter Brooke, the fabrication done by Julie Zobel, and the animatronics provided by John Criswell as seen in the Google+ Hangout tour.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_4df8-sOBw#t=1938 Principal photography was set to begin in the spring of 2015 in Nova Scotia, Canada.

She was taught to fly by the notable pioneer aviator Wiley Post. She was a stunt pilot. In 1972 she became one of the Chickasaw Nation's first community health representatives; her mother was an original enrollee of the Chickasaw Nation. Scott was elected to the Chickasaw legislature in 1983 and served three terms there. Early life Pearl was born to George and Lucy Carter on December 9, 1915 in Marlow, Stephens County, Oklahoma. She was the youngest of three girls, and also had a younger brother named George Carter, Jr. Her father was a wealthy businessman, while Lucy was an original enrollee of the Chickasaw Nation. Pearl evidently eschewed many of the traditional activities of young Chickasaw women. Instead, she acquired her own automobile when she was only eleven years old, and had learned to drive herself by the age of twelve. Pearl said late in her life that her father was blind, and that she had served as his eyes, so she accompanied him everywhere, whether in his office or collecting rents out on the farms. She also said that she spent her whole childhood talking with adults.\\"Pearl Carter Scott.\\" Chickasaw Nation Hall of Fame. Accessed 2018-03-08. Pearl in the air Noted pioneer aviator Wiley Post was a friend of the Carter family and visited their home from time to time. One of his visits occurred in 1928, when Pearl was twelve years old. He gave Pearl and her father their first ride in an airplane. She was totally enthralled by the experience, later saying: > \\"I knew right then, while I was in the air with Wiley that first day, that I > would fly someday. I asked him a hundred questions while we were up in the > air, and as soon as he set(sic) the plane down, I ran over and told Daddy > that I wanted to learn to fly.\\" Post agreed to teach Pearl how to fly. After several months of lessons, her father surprised her with her own Curtis Robbins airplane. On September 12, 1929, she took off on her first solo flight, becoming the youngest person in Oklahoma at that time to accomplish this feat. Not long afterward, she began to perform as a stunt pilot. In 1931, Post flew into the local airstrip with another man, whom Pearl did not recognize. Moments later Post introduced her to the already world famous Will Rogers. Devotion to children Pearl married at age 16, and quickly started a family of her own. She continued to fly after her first baby, but after she bore a second, she realized that the babies would have to grow up without a mother if there were an accident. She abruptly quit flying. She apparently relented once, when Wiley Post allowed her to take to the air flying his famous \\"Winnie Mae,\\" in which he had set two world records. Service to Chickasaw Nation In 1972, Pearl began her \\"second career\\" as an active worker for the Chickasaw Nation. After studying at the Desert Willow Indian Training Center in Tucson, Arizona, she became one of the tribe's first community health representatives. In 1983, she was elected to the Chickasaw Legislature, where she served three terms. Recognition of her accomplishments She was inducted into the Chickasaw Nation Hall of Fame, a member of the International Women's Air & Space Museum, and the Oklahoma Aviation and Space Hall of Fame, and is a charter member of the National Museum of the American Indian at the Smithsonian. In 2014 a portrait of her was unveiled in the Oklahoma House of Representatives.

Isentia also purchased China- based China Newswire, which was formerly owned by global rival Cision before Cision divested the business to Matoka Capital.  History  Neville Jeffress, the owner of a firm that managed the sale and publication of classified advertising, began acquiring clipping services in 1982, including NSW Country Press, Lynch Pidler Pty and the Australian Press Cutting Agency. This service operated as Neville Jeffress/Pidler Pty Ltd. from 1982 to 1993 when it purchased and amalgamated Media Monitors Australia, and began operating as Media Monitors. By the time Neville Jeffress/Pidler Pty Ltd changed its name to Media Monitors Australia Pty Ltd in 1993, the company had established itself as one of Australia's largest media monitoring companies. Media Monitors stepped out of Australasia by opening an office in Singapore in 2006. In 2011 Media Monitors Group was purchased by Australian private equity company Quadrant. On 9 February 2012, the company unified its brands under one corporate name, Sentia Media, and in 2013 the company moved under one name across the Asia-Pacific region, Isentia. In February 2018, long-time CEO John Croll stepped down and was succeeded by former Yahoo7 Australia head Ed Harrison in July 2018. In 2019, Isentia made further executive appointments with James Merritt (CEO of Asia) and Russ Horell as the new Chief Commercial Officer. Acquisitions In August 2013 Isentia bought social media agency Two Social, extending the reach of the company in the social media sphere. In June 2016, Isentia acquired Social Net Creator Ltd, expanding its market into South Korea. The company has also completed a bolt-on acquisition in Thailand and is close to finalising two further acquisitions in Vietnam and Hong Kong.http://www.proactiveinvestors.com.au/companies/news/69048/isentia-group- ltd-expands-media-intelligence-business-into-south-korea-69048.html In December 2016, Isentia acquired Shanghai-based China Newswire, a SaaS platform providing news monitoring and content marketing distribution services to clients in China. With the acquisition, China Newswire's CEO Danny Levinson became Isentia's new Regional Director for Asia, as the operations chief and evangelist for the company's artificial intelligence data services in its 10 Asian offices across China, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore, Vietnam, and Malaysia. Australian Securities Exchange listing In May 2014, Isentia lodged a prospectus in preparation for a listing on the Australian Securities Exchange. Isentia listed on the ASX in June of the same year.

He is best known for management positions at the Copacabana nightclub in New York City in the 1940s and early 1950s, and at the iconic Sands Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas from the early 1950s. He is closely associated with Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack in the history of Las Vegas, Nevada. Biography Entratter (second from left) Born to a Jewish family, Entratter began working in the French Casino in Miami, Florida as a reservation clerk as a teenager. He later worked as a bouncer at the Stork Club in New York City in the 1930s. In 1940, he was appointed as an assistant to Jules Podell at the Copacabana nightclub, and was later general manager of the club. By 1949, he had a controlling interest in the nightclub, and he was still at the club in July 1952. Sands Hotel and Casino Entratter became general manager of the Sands Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas when it opened in December 1952. At the time, it was the most luxurious hotel on the Las Vegas Strip and among the world's best hotels. Entratter made many show business friends during his time as a manager at the Copacabana, where he gained renown for his smoothness in dealing with its performers and patrons. He was able to use these connections to sign performers for the Copa Room at the Sands, a nightclub that he built especially for Sinatra. Entratter offered entertainers an additional incentive to perform at the Sands. Headlining stars received \\"points\\", or a percentage of ownership in the hotel and casino. Entratter's personally selected \\"Copa Girls\\" wore $12,000 worth of costumes on the hotel's opening night (). This surpassed the salary of the Copa Room's star, Danny Thomas. Due to the American Mafia involvement in the development of Las Vegas, Entratter was associated with mobsters such as Meyer Lansky and Hyman Abrams in the financing of the Sands, which he ran with Carl Cohen, who was its entertainment director and vice president. Nancy Sinatra wrote in her 1986 autobiography: \\"Sands was the place. Jack Entratter, Nick Kelly, Carl Cohen, they were quite a team. They knew what talent to book, what food to serve. They also knew how to be generous, and they weren't afraid to be. There were always free drinks for the gamblers\\". Entratter was still the manager of the Sands in 1966 when Sinatra's live album, Sinatra at the Sands, was recorded, as during the \\"Tea Break\\" Sinatra mentioned that Entratter had told him that many of the hotel suites of the new hotel block being built at the time would be given names to glamorize it, including the Danny Thomas, Red Skelton, Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis suites.Sinatra at the Sands (1966), Reprise Records Personal life Entratter (5th from left) with the Rat Pack at the Sands in 1960 Entratter was married to Dorothy James until her death in 1961; they had two daughters, Caryl Entratter Palin and Michelle Entratter Walkoff. His second wife was model and actress Lari Laine (Corinne Cole). He was described as being a large man of in height and in weight, with a \\"deep, baritone voice\\". He reportedly had a \\"slightly menacing character with the demeanor of an ex-boxer\\", yet was \\"smooth and courtly\\" to those he liked. Known as \\"Mr. Entertainment\\", Entratter did not drink alcohol, and he was not a gambler or smoker. Entratter served as congregation president of Temple Beth Sholom from 1959 through 1963, and again in 1966. In film, Entratter appeared as himself in Pepe (1960), and served as a technical advisor on Sinatra's 1955 film, The Man with the Golden Arm. Entratter was one of the founders of the Jewish Federation of Las Vegas.

She was awarded the South African Chemical Institute Gold Medal in 2012, and named one of the top 10 most influential women in science and technology in Africa by IT News Africa. She is currently researching photo-dynamic therapy, an alternative cancer treatment method to chemotherapy. In 2007, she was one of the top three publishing scientists in South Africa, and in 2013 she was awarded the National Research Foundation's Lifetime Achievement Award. Education In high school, she chose arts subjects, but just two years before her matric year she changed to the sciences. She managed to overhaul the backlog of work, developing an enduring love for chemistry as she worked. She received her Cambridge Overseas School Certificate in 1972. Nyokong came from a poor background. She had to wear second-hand clothes and was barefoot. As a young girl she was sent to live with her grandparents in the mountains of Lesotho. She learnt about science by observing the wildlife whilst she worked as an eight-year-old child caring for sheep. Nyokong says that she would spend one day at school and then one day with the sheep as someone had to care for them.Video interview with Tebello Nyokong, 21 icons, Retrieved 9 November 2015 Nyokong says that one of her childhood ambitions was to own her own pair of shoes.Behind the Icon – Tebello Nyokong: The compassionate scientist, 10 May 2014, News24, Retrieved 9 November 2015 When she started school she was steered away from science as she was told that it was too hard.

She went on to earn her master's in chemistry from McMaster University in Ontario, Canada. In 1987, she received her Ph.D in chemistry from the University of Western Ontario. After earning her PhD, she received a Fulbright fellowship to continue her post-doctoral studies at the University of Notre Dame in the United States. Career After finishing her Fulbright fellowship in the United States, Nyokong returned to Lesotho, briefly as it turned out, to take a position at the University of Lesotho. In 1992, she took a position as a lecturer at Rhodes University. The National Research Foundation gave her a high rating and helped Nyokong obtain a research laboratory at the university. Soon, she moved from lecturer to professor, and then distinguished professor. She is known for her research in nanotechnology, as well as her work on photo- dynamic therapy. Her pioneering research in the latter is paving the way for a safer cancer detection and treatment, without the debilitating side effects of chemotherapy. Nyokong published an open letter that she wrote nominally aimed at her 18-year-old self (who would have been working hard to complete a three- year science course in courage as her family may not realise the opportunities ahead.

It is a symbolic math library, and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks.\\"TensorFlow: Open source machine learning\\" \\"It is machine learning software being used for various kinds of perceptual and language understanding tasks\\" — Jeffrey Dean, minute 0:47 / 2:17 from YouTube clip It is used for both research and production at Google. TensorFlow was developed by the Google Brain team for internal Google use. It was released under the Apache License 2.0 on November 9, 2015.  History = DistBelief  Starting in 2011, Google Brain built DistBelief as a proprietary machine learning system based on deep learning neural networks. Its use grew rapidly across diverse Alphabet companies in both research and commercial applications. Google assigned multiple computer scientists, including Jeff Dean, to simplify and refactor the codebase of DistBelief into a faster, more robust application-grade library, which became TensorFlow. In 2009, the team, led by Geoffrey Hinton, had implemented generalized backpropagation and other improvements which allowed generation of neural networks with substantially higher accuracy, for instance a 25% reduction in errors in speech recognition.  TensorFlow  TensorFlow is Google Brain's second-generation system. Version 1.0.0 was released on February 11, 2017. While the reference implementation runs on single devices, TensorFlow can run on multiple CPUs and GPUs (with optional CUDA and SYCL extensions for general-purpose computing on graphics processing units). TensorFlow is available on 64-bit Linux, macOS, Windows, and mobile computing platforms including Android and iOS. Its flexible architecture allows for the easy deployment of computation across a variety of platforms (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs), and from desktops to clusters of servers to mobile and edge devices. TensorFlow computations are expressed as stateful dataflow graphs. The name TensorFlow derives from the operations that such neural networks perform on multidimensional data arrays, which are referred to as tensors. During the Google I/O Conference in June 2016, Jeff Dean stated that 1,500 repositories on GitHub mentioned TensorFlow, of which only 5 were from Google. Machine Learning: Google I/O 2016 Minute 07:30/44:44 accessdate=2016-06-05 In December 2017, developers from Google, Cisco, RedHat, CoreOS, and CaiCloud introduced Kubeflow at a conference. Kubeflow allows operation and deployment of TensorFlow on Kubernetes. In March 2018, Google announced TensorFlow.js version 1.0 for machine learning in JavaScript. In Jan 2019, Google announced TensorFlow 2.0. It became officially available in Sep 2019. In May 2019, Google announced TensorFlow Graphics for deep learning in computer graphics.  Tensor processing unit (TPU)  In May 2016, Google announced its Tensor processing unit (TPU), an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC, a hardware chip) built specifically for machine learning and tailored for TensorFlow. A TPU is a programmable AI accelerator designed to provide high throughput of low-precision arithmetic (e.g., 8-bit), and oriented toward using or running models rather than training them. Google announced they had been running TPUs inside their data centers for more than a year, and had found them to deliver an order of magnitude better-optimized performance per watt for machine learning. In May 2017, Google announced the second-generation, as well as the availability of the TPUs in Google Compute Engine. The second-generation TPUs deliver up to 180 teraflops of performance, and when organized into clusters of 64 TPUs, provide up to 11.5 petaflops. In May 2018, Google announced the third-generation TPUs delivering up to 420 teraflops of performance and 128 GB high bandwidth memory (HBM). Cloud TPU v3 Pods offer 100+ petaflops of performance and 32 TB HBM. In February 2018, Google announced that they were making TPUs available in beta on the Google Cloud Platform.  Edge TPU  In July 2018, the Edge TPU was announced. Edge TPU is Google's purpose-built ASIC chip designed to run TensorFlow Lite machine learning (ML) models on small client computing devices such as smartphones known as edge computing.  TensorFlow Lite  In May 2017, Google announced a software stack specifically for mobile development, TensorFlow Lite. In January 2019, TensorFlow team released a developer preview of the mobile GPU inference engine with OpenGL ES 3.1 Compute Shaders on Android devices and Metal Compute Shaders on iOS devices. In May 2019, Google announced that their TensorFlow Lite Micro (also known as TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers) and ARM's uTensor would be merging. TensorFlow Lite uses FlatBuffers as the data serialization format for network models, eschewing the Protocol Buffers format used by standard TensorFlow models.  Pixel Visual Core (PVC)  In October 2017, Google released the Google Pixel 2 which featured their Pixel Visual Core (PVC), a fully programmable image, vision and AI processor for mobile devices. The PVC supports TensorFlow for machine learning (and Halide for image processing).  Applications  Google officially released RankBrain on October 26, 2015, backed by TensorFlow. Google also released , which is a TensorFlow Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup to use.  Machine Learning Crash Course (MLCC)  On March 1, 2018, Google released its Machine Learning Crash Course (MLCC). Originally designed to help equip Google employees with practical artificial intelligence and machine learning fundamentals, Google rolled out its free TensorFlow workshops in several cities around the world before finally releasing the course to the public.  TensorFlow 2.0  As TensorFlow's market share among research papers was declining to the advantage of PyTorch TensorFlow Team announced a release of a new major version of the library in September 2019. TensorFlow 2.0 introduced many changes, the most significant being TensorFlow eager, which changed the automatic differentiation scheme from the static computational graph, to the \\"Define-by-Run\\" scheme originally made popular by Chainer and later PyTorch. Other major changes included removal of old libraries, cross-compatibility between trained models on different versions of TensorFlow, and significant improvements to the performance on GPU.  Features  TensorFlow provides stable Python (for version 3.7 across all platforms) and C APIs; and without API backwards compatibility guarantee: C++, Go, Java, JavaScript and Swift (early release). Third-party packages are available for C#, Haskell, Julia, MATLAB, R, Scala, Rust, OCaml, and Crystal. \\"New language support should be built on top of the C API. However, [..] not all functionality is available in C yet.\\" Some more functionality is provided by the Python API.  Applications  Among the applications for which TensorFlow is the foundation, are automated image- captioning software, such as DeepDream.

The game is for two to four players. Rules Hooop! is a game about frogs hopping on lily pads in a pond. Each player receives three frogs of a specific colour. The board consists of 25 lily pads arranged in a 5×5 rectangular grid. Each player's frogs start from the player's own base at his/her edge, and the object of the game is to get all three frogs to the bases on the edges belonging to the other players. The lily pads are connected by wooden plank bridges. Each time a frog jumps to another lily pad, the bridge between them is removed. Frogs can only jump to other lily pads over bridges. A player can also use his/her turn to put a bridge back into place instead of moving a frog. Only one frog can be on one lily pad at a time. Moving into a pad already containing a frog causes that frog to jump to another pad, and if that pad is also occupied, the effect cumulates. Special one-time cards allow a player to move a frog twice in a row, put two bridges back in place, remove a bridge from anywhere on the board without moving a frog, or move a frog without needing a bridge. The first player to get all three of his/her frogs to the other players' bases wins.

Michelangelo Caetani, (1804–1882). Michelangelo Caetani, Duke of Sermoneta and Prince of Teano (Rome, 20 March 1804 – Rome, 12 December 1882) was a notable political figure and an Italian scholar with great interest in literature, sculpture and goldsmith. Life He was a descendant from the Italian noble Caetani family, which played a great role in the history of Pisa and Rome. According to the practice of his time, he was educated at home by private tutors. However, his interest in arts led quickly him to study in the studios of sculptors Bertel Thorvaldsen and Pietro Tenerani, the painter Tommasso Minardi and the goldsmith Fortunato Pio Castellani. The last of the three transformed Caetani’ s drawings into actual antique-style jewelries which today are partly preserved in the National Etruscan Museum in Rome. Caetani was also a scholar of Dante Alighieri. He published relevant works, such as La Materia nella Divina Commedia and Carteggio Dantesco and designed a series of topographic maps to be used by students of the Divine Comedy. His work was printed by the monks at Monte Cassino, using early Chromolithography. He was a cosmopolitan. His house was the meeting place of national and international scholars, such as François-René de Chateaubriand, Stendhal, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Franz Liszt, Honoré de Balzac, Renan, Hippolyte Taine, Frédéric Ozanam, Jean-Jacques Ampère, George Ticknor, Ferdinand Gregorovius, Alfred von Reumont, Démosthène Ollivier. In 1840, Caetani married the Polish Countess Calixta Rzewuski, the daughter of Wacław Seweryn Rzewuski, a well-known Polish orientalist. Their son, Onorato, was Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Italy, while their daughter Ersilia was an archaeologist and the first woman who was admitted to the oldest scientific academy, the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei.Ersilia Lovatelli, Grace Mary Crowfoot, Brown.edu, Retrieved 12 October 2016 His second wife was the English Margherita Knight and his third was Harriette Ellis, the daughter of Charles Ellis, 6th Baron Howard de Walden. His political views subscribed to the ideology of moderate liberalism. He did not condone extremists and he was aligned with Pellegrino Rossi. He served as Minister of police in the government of Cardinal Bofondi (1846-1848), in collaboration with Carlo Troya and Michele Amari. After the capture of Rome and its annexation to Italy as its third capital, Caetani became the Governor of Rome. He was elected twice to the Italian Parliament and was awarded the Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation due to his service to the Kingdom of Italy. GalleryWorks *Sermoneta, M. Caetani. (1821).

It also explicitly supports secularist positions. Its official abbreviation is A.H.A. Lëtzebuerg; usually this is shortened to AHA, sometimes with an extra exclamation mark. The AHA was founded on 13 May 2010 as an association without lucrative purpose (asbl). AHA is a member of the European Humanist Federation and the International Humanist and Ethical Union. From 2010 up to 10th May 2019, the association was chaired by biologist Dr. Laurent Schley. The current chair is psychologist Dr. Robert A.P. (Bob) Reuter.  History  For historical reasons, especially because of the century-long subordination to the House of Habsburg, a great part of the Luxembourgish population is formally a member of the Roman Catholic Church (2002: 94%Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993-2002) s.v. Luxemburg: feiten en cijfers. Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum (in Dutch).). Their position is strengthened to this day by several privileges granted to this religious community, be it by treaty or informally. The traditionally strongest party in the Luxembourgish Parliament, the Christian Social People's Party (CSV), tends to support the Catholic Church. The Luxemburger Wort, the country's largest newspaper, belongs to the Saint-Paul Luxembourg publishing group, of which the Catholic Church is also the largest shareholder. However, new surveys show that an increasing share of the population no longer feels connected to Catholicism. A process began in mid-2000s in which increasingly the tight entanglement between church and state in Luxembourg was questioned. This was partially stimulated by several events, such as the debate on Catholic Church sexual abuse or the Grandduke's religiously motivated refusal to sign a euthanasia bill adopted by Parliament. This led to the 2007 formation of an alliance of eight organisations, who made the separation of church and state their goal. Meanwhile, a lot of people were increasingly estranged by the Church's belief system, and yet were still members of it, solidifying the current situation. This caused both the association Liberté de conscience (\\"Freedom of Conscience\\") and the Internet portal sokrates.lu to launch the website Fraiheet.lu (\\"Freedom.lu\\") in 2009, to inform citizens about the options for religious disaffiliation. In 2010, a petition was launched under the name of Trennung.lu (\\"Separation.lu\\"), that demanded the separation of church and state in Luxembourg. It was supported by, amongst others, the youth wings of several political parties. These advances eventually led to the foundation of the AHA in the spring of 2010. It intended to unite the hitherto scattered organised activities by humanist, atheist, agnostic, skeptical and secularist thinking people into one force. The foundation was also explicitly welcomed by, amongst others, politicians from several parties. Soon after, several actions, regular press releases and debate contributions resulted in resonance in the country's media. A questionnaire action held in April 2011, in which the MPs were asked about their opinion on the financial separation of church and state, as well as a philosophically neutral moral education in schools, was answered by members of all factions except the CSV. The website Fraiheet.lu was taken over by the AHA in May 2011. The AHA is also recognised as an interlocutor from the side of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Luxembourg. In December 2011, members of the Alliance met with the Luxembourgish Archbishop Jean-Claude Hollerich and other representatives of the Archdiocese. Although this meeting clearly showed distinct positions, there were also areas of common ground to be found. It was agreed to henceforth remain in dialogue with each other. In January 2015, AHA was amongst seven nonreligious organisations that demanded a say in the negotiations about the future financing of religions by the state and the continuation of religion classes in public schools, both of which they demanded to be abolished.  Positions  The AHA has four main goals: * Separation between church and state: the AHA strives towards restriction of the state's church subsidies, as well as becoming philosophically neutral. It values secular education instead of the currently existing religious instruction in schools. * Ethics free of dogma: a morality grounded in humanism is to be preferred over a religion-based one, which discriminates people positively or negatively based on their religious affiliation. * Knowledge instead of faith: scientific insights should not be questioned by religious dogmas. This is the case with, for example, the theory of evolution, that is rejected by advocates of creationism. * Celebrating – without \\"God\\": the AHA supports a celebratory culture, which does not align itself with religious traditions such as baptism, communion or church weddings; instead, it propagates secular alternatives. With its programme, it is closely following the German Giordano Bruno Foundation.  Activities  Bus campaign Luxembourg, spring 2011: \\"Not religious? Stand up for it!\\" One of the first bigger actions of the AHA was the independent initiative of a poster action in spring 2011, in the frame of the globally held Atheist Bus Campaign. Having chosen the slogan Net reliéis? Stéi dozou! (\\"Not religious? Stand up for it!\\") it sought to persuade people to no longer hide their nonbelief in religious ideas, but to publicly stand up for it. The campaign led to a heated debate on free speech versus religious discrimination, with some people calling for the campaign to be suspended. Parliamentarians from The Greens, The Left, the LSAP and the Democratic Party asked Transport Minister Claude Wiseler whether, and if so why, the campaign would be interrupted. Because the campaign fell within the constitionally enshrined freedom of expression, however, the government would not have been able to prohibit it; only the transport companies could refuse or cancel advertisements, and they saw no reason to do so. The AHA also participates intensively in the public debate about the overhaul of the Luxembourgish Constitution. In its present form, the Constitution goes back to the situation of 1868, and important societal and political actors consider it to be outdated and no longer fitting current times. (Information on the constitutional reform debate) The AHA's main focus about the contents again lies at the achievement of a pure separation of church and state. In a letter to Minister of Religious Affairs François Biltgen of 25 November 2012, the AHA demanded: # Introduction of a unique ethics course for all pupils; # Strict financial separation between the state and religious or philosophical convictions; # Abolition of all conventions that are currently in force; # Repeal of articles 22, 106 and 119 of the Constitution; # Introduction of a constitutional article stipulating a secular state; # Reallocation/transformation of a number of religious buildings for social, cultural, commercial or sportive purposes; # Financing of the remaining religious buildings is to be done by the religious convictions themselves. Since 2012, the AHA stages several public actions during Easter, at which it also provides information on leaving the church. This occurs analogous to similar events in Germany, and with allusions to the Easter Bunny, as Huesefest (\\"Bunny Festival\\").  Literature  * Fiona Lorenz: AHA! Auftakt der Humanisten in Luxemburg.

Construction on the cathedral began in the 1340s, and it was consecrated in 1411. It was still under construction in the 15th and at the beginning of the 16th century, until its completion in 1526. It is one of the greatest treasure troves of funerary art in Poland next to the cathedrals in Gniezno, Poznan and Cracow.  Background information and the history of the cathedral = The first places of worship in Wloclawek  When Wloclawek became a bishopric, there may already have been two places of worship in the city. One of them was probably a castle chapel, and the other was St. John the Baptist Church with which the parish functioned that was administered then by Benedictines. The castle chapel, which was under the auspices of the prince, played the role of the first cathedral. According to the chronicler Jan Dlugosz, bishop Swidger (around 1133) equipped the new cathedral in Wloclawek, and adapted the castle chapel which was dedicated to St. Mary of the Assumption. However, the first written information about the cathedral in Wloclawek comes only from 1185. Because of its location the cathedral often suffered damage. The waters of the Vistula River, and fires also contributed to its destruction, which finally led to the building of a new cathedral under the guidance of the bishop Michal Godziemba (1222-1252). He decided to set up the new cathedral in place of the first cathedral. It is not known for certain when this second cathedral was set up. It was probably a three-aisle building made of stone in the Romanesque style with a wooden ceiling. It lasted until 1329 when the Teutonic Knights destroyed it. Zglowiaczka river, picture by Adolf Kozarski Research into the history of the first cathedrals in Wloclawek is as yet incomplete. It requires further investigation and excavations. The situation is slightly better when it comes to the third – still extant– basilica cathedral.  The current cathedral  The history of the cathedral of St. Mary of the Assumption begins during the episcopate of Bishop Maciej of Golancz (1323-1364). He was a canon of Wloclawek, Gniezno, Poznan, Plock, Cracow, and Wroclaw. Maciej was the first initiator and the builder of the cathedral. On 7 May 1329 Teutonic troops captured Wloclawek, and destroyed the borough, concentrating in particular on the bishop’s property. The Teutonic Knights forbade restoring the bishop’s town and the cathedral on pain of death. On 24 August 1330 Maciej of Golancz decided to sign a pact with the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, Werner von Orseln, who allowed him to resume public religious activities. To this end, a small church beyond the city was built as a temporary solution. But Maciej Golanczewski still wanted to build a cathedral, and collected funds and created plans to do so. On 25 March 1340 he consecrated the cornerstone to begin building the new cathedral. During the next 25 years, the construction on the walls of the cathedral was ongoing; Maciej’s nephew - Zbylut (1365-1383) succeeded to the bishopric, and continued building the cathedral. The details of the construction process are uncertain. The first stage, including the presbytery, southern vestry and treasury, were most likely completed under the guidance of Maciej Golanczewski. During Zbylut’s incumbency in the diocese the roofs of the lofts and vestry were finished, and the high altar with the figure of the Mother of God was set up. The cathedral in 1842, picture by Georg Ferdinand Gregorivovus  Changes made to the cathedral  On 13 May 1411 a ceremonious consecration of the cathedral attended by the king of Poland Wladyslaw Jagiello took place. But the cathedral was not yet finished. Construction continued over the course of the next centuries. There are mentions that prelates and canons of the chapter in Wloclawek gave up part of their income for the further building and conservation of the cathedral. In the second part of the 15th century work was started on the chapels around the main body of the church. Next to the southern nave, St. Martin's Chapel and chapterhouse were built in 1527 and the Cibavit chapel in 1541. At the beginning of the 16th century these two chapels were remodelled in the Mannerist style which included covering them with cupolas with lanterns. Over time, the cathedral needed renovation. In the second part of the 18th century the roof was renovated while in the 19th century the cathedral was regothicised. The bishop Wincenty Teofil Chosciak wanted the cathedral to look more monumental and decided to enlarge the towers. The works began in 1878. They enlarged the towers, and finished them off with pointed cupolas. In 1907 the cathedral was honoured with the title of minor basilica. The title was given by the Pope Pius X. An important event in the history of the cathedral was the visit of Pope John Paul II, who stayed in Wloclawek on 6 and 7 June 1991 during his fourth journey to his home country.  The cathedral as a treasure trove of art  The three-aisle interior is maintained in the gothic style, but has baroque and neo-Gothic elements in it. The cathedral contains some great pieces of art from different centuries, including the following: The presbytery in the cathedral * The tomb of Piotr of Bnin Moszczynski, dating from about 1496, funded by Kallimach and made by the famous sculptor Veit Stoss. It is now located in St. Joseph’s chapel. Examples of Renaissance art such as the tombstone of bishop Krzeslaw Kurozwecki made of marble in 1516 and the tombstone of bishop Jan Karnkowski made in 1536 * Wooden sculptures of the Mother of God from the beginning of the 15th century and a polychrome group of the Last Supper from 1505 * An early baroque sepulchral memorial of two bishops Pstrokonski and Lubienski from 1629 by Augustin von Oyen. It was made of multicolour marble and alabaster, and is situated in the eastern Manneristic niche. In the entrance of the niche, there is a great portal from the 17th century * Gothic stained glass from about 1360 made probably in Toruń and funded by the bishop Zbylut Golanczewski * Art Nouveau stained glass designed by Jozef Mehoffer made in 1938/1939 * Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary – a picture dating to around 1475 ascribed to Francis of Sieradz * The Assumption of St. Mary by Jan Wielki from 1480Stained glass in the Basilica Cathedral Tomb of the bishop Piotr from Bnin by Veit Stoss The Assumption of St. Mary by Jan Wielki from 1480  The organization of the church  In 2015 Michal Krygier became the new parish priest. Paweł Skowron - vicar Sebastian Adamczyk - vicar Monument to Mateusz Pstrokonski and Mateusz Lubienski in Wloclawek cathedral's aisle.  The choir  When the orchestra which had functioned in the cathedral since the 18th century closed down, the priest Leon Moczyński formed a choir out of seminarians. After some time, some people from the city expressed willingness to join in. Therefore, the cathedral had two choirs – the one formed by priests, and the mixed one formed by lay boys and men. They often performed together as cathedral choirs. In 1925 part of the choir broke away from the cathedral and became the Association of Former Cathedral Choirs “Lute” (Lutnia) (which still exists today). The priest Andrzej Nodzynski reformed the cathedral choir and continued to work with it. In 1938 Tadeusz Guzenda became the conductor of the choir. In the 60s he formed, alongside the male choir, a female one. When the priest Zbigniew Szygenda was conductor, he united both choirs. Since 1983 Jozef Nowak has been the conductor of the choir that consists of 45 people.

Two teams compete by each having a \\"spymaster\\" give one-word clues that can point to multiple words on the board. The other players on the team attempt to guess their team's words while avoiding the words of the other team. In a variant with 2–3 players, one spymaster gives clues to the other player or players. In 2016, Codenames won the Spiel des Jahres award for the best board game of the year. Rules Codenames is a game of guessing which codenames (i.e., words) in a set are related to a hint-word given by another player. Players split into two teams: red and blue. One player of each team is selected as the team's spymaster; the others are field operatives. Twenty-five Codename cards, each bearing a word, are laid out in a 5×5 rectangular grid, in random order. A number of these words represent red agents, a number represent blue agents, one represents an assassin, and the others represent innocent bystanders. The teams' spymasters are given a randomly-dealt map card showing a 5×5 grid of 25 squares of various colors, each corresponding to one of the code name cards on the table. Teams take turns. On each turn, the appropriate spymaster gives a verbal hint about the words on the respective cards. Each hint may only consist of one single word and a number. The spymaster gives a hint that is related to as many of the words on his/her own agents' cards as possible, but not to any others – lest they accidentally lead their team to choose a card representing an innocent bystander, an opposing agent, or the assassin. The hint's word can be chosen freely, as long as it is not (and does not contain) any of the words on the code name cards still showing at that time. Code name cards are covered as guesses are made. The hint's number tells the field operatives how many words in the grid are related to the word of the clue. It also determines the maximum number of guesses the field operatives may make on that turn, which is the hint's number plus one. Field operatives must make at least one guess per turn, risking a wrong guess and its consequences. They may also end their turn voluntarily at any point thereafter. After a spymaster gives the hint with its word and number, their field operatives make guesses about which code name cards bear words related to the hint and point them out, one at a time. When a code name card is pointed out, the spymaster covers that card with an appropriate identity card – a blue agent card, a red agent card, an innocent bystander card, or the assassin card – as indicated on the spymasters' map of the grid. If the assassin is pointed out, the game ends immediately, with the team who identified him losing. If an agent of the other team is pointed out, the turn ends immediately, and that other team is also one agent closer to winning. If an innocent bystander is pointed out, the turn simply ends. The game ends when all of one team's agents are identified (winning the game for that team), or when one team has identified the assassin (losing the game).

Early life and political career Antonino Paternò Castello was born in Catania, Sicily, in a family of ancient Sicilian nobility. In his younger years he studied economics and sociology, and published articles on agriculture, industry, population, labour legislation, and emigration in various journals.Sarti, Italy: a reference guide from the Renaissance to the present, pp. 539-40 In 1882 he was elected to parliament and aligned himself with Sidney Sonnino, representing the conservatives who identified with the old Historical Right. In the early years of the 20th century, he focused on foreign policy in the years of the polarization of European powers into the Triple Alliance and Triple Entente blocs. He was convinced that Italy's national interest could best advanced by balancing itself between the two competing alliances. Foreign policy He conducted a policy of friendship toward France, while remaining faithful to Italy's commitments to Austria- Hungary and the German Empire. He served as foreign minister (1905–1906), ambassador to London (1906–1909), ambassador to Paris (1909–1910), and foreign minister (1910–1914). An advocate of colonial expansion, his diplomacy cleared the way for the occupation of Libya during the Italo-Turkish War (1911–1912). He resisted the expansion of Austria-Hungary in the Balkans, supported Italian economic penetration of Montenegro, and the independence of Albania. World War I When World War I broke out, he implemented a policy of neutrality but did not rule out intervention, according to Prime Minister Antonio Salandra's policy of \\"sacred egoism\\" (sacro egoismo).Clark, Modern Italy: 1871 to the present, p. 219 Negotiating with both the Triple Entente and Triple Alliance powers, he insisted on gaining maximum territorial concessions for participation in the war to fulfill Italy’s irrendentist claims. He became seriously ill in October 1914 and retired. His successor, Sidney Sonnino, followed the negotiating strategy set by San Giuliano, leading to the secret Treaty of London or London Pact () with the Triple Entente.

He was Minister of Health in several cabinets in 1951–53, Minister of Commerce for a few weeks in 1953, Minister of Justice in 1953–54, and Minister of Industry and Commerce in 1957–58. Early years Paul François Ribeyre was born on 11 December 1906 in Aubagne, Bouches-du-Rhône. After his primary education in Vals-les-Bains he attended the Collège du Sacré-Cœur in Marseille for his secondary education. He succeeded his father as general manager of Vals-Reine, a small company that bottled mineral water from a source in Vals-les-Bains, and held this position until Vals-Reine merged with three other local bottling companies in 1968. During World War II (1939-45) he was appointed mayor of Vals-les-Bains on 18 July 1943 during the German occupation. On 16 June 1944 a German armored column occupied the town, and demanded a list of hostages from Ribeyre. He refused and was arrested, for which he later received the Legion of Honour. With the Liberation of France he was replaced as mayor on 14 August 1944. Regional politics Ribeyre ran in the municipal elections of 29 April 1945 and was elected as councilor. He was appointed mayor of Vals-les-Bains on 18 May 1945, holding this office until 1983. Ribeyre founded the center-right Union républicaine ardéchoise (URA, Ardèche Republican Union) and the conservative journal La Gazette des Cévennes. On 9 November 1947 he was elected to the general council of Ardèche for the canton of Saint-Pierreville. He was a general councilor until 1979, and president of the general council of Ardèche from 1951 to 1955 and from 1959 to 1979. National politics Ribeyre was elected to represent Ardèche in the National Constituent Assembly on 21 October 1945 on the Républicaine Liberté et Concorde list. He joined the Entente Républicaine group in the chamber. After this he joined the Parti Paysan, which became the Centre national des indépendants et paysans (CNIP), and remained with this party for the rest of his political career. He did not support the draft constitution, which was rejected in the subsequent referendum. Ribeyre was reelected to the second National Constituent Assembly on 2 June 1946, and was elected as deputy to the National Assembly on 10 November 1946. He was reelected deputy for Ardèche on 17 June 1951 and on 2 January 1956, remaining a deputy until 8 December 1958 at the end of the French Fourth Republic. He became president of the Parliamentary Association for Freedom of Education. On 28 October 1949 Ribeyre was appointed under- secretary of state for Public Health and Population in the cabinet of Georges Bidault. He resigned on 4 December 1949 in protest against a decree on agricultural prices. Ribeyre was appointed Minister of Public Health and Population on 11 August 1951 in the cabinet of René Pleven and remained in office until 7 January 1953 in the subsequent cabinets of Edgar Faure and Antoine Pinay. On 23 April 1952 Ribeyre sent instructions to the staff of the Ministry of Population on applications for naturalization. He said \\"Requests by citizens of far-away countries and especially those made by foreigners from exotic countries must be greeted with the greatest reserve.\\" In September 1952 Ribeyre proposed a European Health Community modeled on the European Coal and Steel Community. It would facilitate trade, standards, research and development in the field of medicine between the member states. The response from the other cabinet members was lukewarm, and the bureaucrats and industry lobby groups resisted the proposal. In the end, nothing was done. Ribeyre was Minister of Commerce in the cabinet of René Mayer from 9 January 1953 to 11 February 1953. After André Boutémy resigned, he was Minister of Health in Mayer's cabinet from 11 February 1953 to 27 May 1953. He was Minister of Justice and Population from 28 June 1953 to 19 June 1954 in the cabinet of Joseph Laniel. He played a central role in having Xavier Vallat, former Vichy commissioner for Jewish Affairs, released from prison. Ribeyre was Minister of Industry and Commerce from 6 November 1957 to 1 June 1958 in the cabinet of Félix Gaillard. Paul Ribeyre was a senator from 1 January 1959 to 1 January 1980. He was chairman of the European Health Club, which was granted consultative status to the Council of Europe in 1982. He died at the age of 81 on 14 January 1988 in Valence, Drôme.

Thought In addition to speaking around the world, Azumah has written a number of books and has contributed to a large range of publications. He is a strong advocate for ecumenical dialogue between Islam and Christianity. He identifies five faces of Islam as: “the missional face (the face that seeks to convert the world to Islam), the mystical face (the face that focuses more on spiritual things), the ideological or political face (the face that seeks to occupy the public sphere by implementing sharia or Islamic law), the militant face (this is the face of Islam that seeks to achieve its ends by the use of violence), and the progressive face (this face is usually self-critical and seek to reread the Koran in light of present realities).” He believes that many Christians only see Islam through one of these faces and urges them to see Islam instead as an amalgamation of them all. Azumah grew up as a Muslim, in a Muslim family, and converted to Christianity so he understands the importance of nurturing dialogue between the two traditions. This is especially true in the context of today's world, where many people misunderstand the Islam faith. He states that “during difficult times foolish people build walls and wise people build bridges. My hope is that we have many more people who’ll be willing to build bridges.” He continues to be a leader throughout the world in facilitating and encouraging interfaith dialogue and understanding.

She is the elected MPP for the riding of York—Simcoe in the 2018 election as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario and was a candidate in the 2018 Ontario Progressive Conservative Party leadership election, placing third. She served as Attorney General of Ontario from 2018 to 2019. Mulroney grew up in Ottawa, before being educated at Harvard University and the New York University School of Law. She lived and worked in the United States for 12 years until 2005 when she returned to Canada, worked in financial services and became involved in charitable work. She also served on the board of directors of the Windsor–Detroit Bridge Authority. Mulroney is the only daughter and the oldest child of the 18th Prime Minister of Canada, Brian Mulroney, and his wife, Mila Mulroney. Early life and education Mulroney is the eldest of four children and only daughter of former Prime Minister of Canada Brian Mulroney and his wife, Mila. One of her younger brothers is CTV morning host Ben Mulroney. Her father won the 1983 PC leadership race on her 9th birthday. Her maternal grandfather, Dimitrije Pivnički, was a Montreal psychiatrist whose patients included Margaret Trudeau. From ages 10 to 19, she lived in 24 Sussex Drive, the home of the prime minister, and attended French school. Her father said in his biography that he believed that she was the most like him \\"in her mindset\\". He also mentioned in an interview with La Presse that she would have been the most likely to follow his footsteps and that he \\"would not want to be a candidate against her\\". Mulroney has an undergraduate degree in Government from Harvard and a J.D. degree from New York University School of Law. During her time in law school, she developed an interest in public-interest law and interned at the New York Attorney General's office. Mulroney is fluent in French, English, Spanish and Serbian. Career After university, Mulroney worked as a financial analyst at Bear Stearns.https://ca.linkedin.com/in/carolinelapham She briefly worked as a lawyer and associate at Shearman & Sterling then as an associate director of the NYU Center for Law & Business. In July 29, 2002, Mulroney was admitted into the New York Bar. Mulroney was reinstated as an American lawyer in September 29, 2017 after her law licence had lapsed. She is not qualified as a lawyer in Ontario or any other Canadian jurisdiction. In 2011, she and her three sisters-in-law, Jessica Mulroney, Vanessa Mulroney and Katy Mulroney, co-founded The Shoebox Project, a non-profit that provides toiletries to women living in shelters. In 2015, she was a blogger for the website, GoGoNews, an online newspaper for children. In addition, she has been a member of the board for the SickKids Foundation, a governor of the National Theatre School of Canada, and a member of the board of directors of the Fraser Institute. In 2015, Mulroney became vice president at BloombergSen, a Toronto investment counselling firm, until 2 August 2017, when she took a leave of absence upon announcing her candidacy. On July 30, 2014, Minister of Transport Lisa Raitt appointed Mulroney to the Windsor–Detroit Bridge Authority, a body to oversee a second bridge across the Detroit River that separates Windsor, Ontario, from Detroit, Michigan. The authority will oversee the new bridge's $4 billion construction, and the management of the bridge, once it has been completed, including setting the bridge tolls. Public life When she was 14, Mulroney campaigned for Lucien Bouchard during the 1988 Lac St. Jean by-election. After his victory, Bouchard sent her a handwritten thank-you note for her efforts in getting him elected to the PC government. She felt betrayed after Bouchard defected from her father's party to the Bloc Québécois. In 1990, she helped canvass for Ontario PC candidate Alex Burney in the 1990 Ontario election. On September 20, 2017, she attended the ground-breaking of the Brian Mulroney Institute of Government at St. Francis Xavier University with her father and mother. Speculation about political career On December 12, 2015, the Toronto Sun published a profile of Mulroney, in which journalist Christina Blizzard speculated as to whether her father's party would choose her as their new leader, to go head to head with Justin Trudeau, the current Prime Minister, the son of her father's old rival, Pierre Trudeau. Blizzard quoted an unnamed \\"Tory insider\\", on Mulroney's performance, when she was the surprise keynote speaker at a 2009 event celebrating the 25th anniversary of her father's administration. That unnamed source said: \\"She certainly has the smarts and the glamour to offset the current prime minister in any future election.\\" Blizzard described her lack of political experience as a benefit, since she \\"won't wear any of the mistakes of the Stephen Harper government\\". Andrew MacDougall, former director of communications to Stephen Harper, noted \\"But there's a reason Tories—both provincially and federally—have dreamt for a Mulroney candidacy for years\\" because \\"she's the closest thing the Tories have to royalty\\". When Mulroney served as joint master of ceremonies for the federal Conservative Party leadership convention in May 2017, she joked about Trudeau, \\"Who would want to run for their dad's old job?\\", but also said in a news interview, \\"I think politics is definitely something that I've always thought about as a career.\\" Mulroney responded to Blizzard with an email informing her that politics is not currently her priority telling her in an email: \\"While I am committed to public service and I am flattered by the suggestion, I am focused on my four young children and my work\\". Entry into politics Patrick Brown recruited Mulroney as a star candidate for the PCs after meeting her when he helped collect donations for her charity. On August 2, 2017, Mulroney announced that she would seek the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario nomination in the York—Simcoe constituency for the 2018 provincial election by releasing a video in which she stated that the government needs to \\"get out of the way\\", manage taxes properly and focus on affordability. She explained that she chose Mulroney as her political name because Mulroney Lapham was too long and she didn't run as Caroline Lapham because, \\"no matter what I do, people just always call me Caroline Mulroney.\\" On September 10, 2017, Mulroney was acclaimed the PC candidate in York—Simcoe. Her father had previously revealed that she had consulted him over a career in politics and that she had decided to enter provincial instead of federal politics to be closer to her family.  2018 Ontario PC Party leadership bid  Mulroney at a leadership campaign event in 2018. Following the sudden resignation of Ontario PC leader Patrick Brown on January 25, 2018, due to allegations of sexual misconduct, Mulroney's name was raised as a possible successor. On February 4, 2018, she declared her candidacy for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario by releasing a video online. Mulroney has the most support from the federal Conservative caucus with 10 members. She was supported by at least four former Patrick Brown advisers: PC campaign chair Walied Soliman, ex-campaign manager Andrew Boddington, ad guru Dan Robertson, and strategist Hamish Marshall, the former director of controversial website The Rebel Media and the Conservative Campaign Chair for the 43rd Federal Election. Her campaign vice-chair was Derek Vanstone, Stephen Harper's former deputy chief of staff and a former Air Canada executive. On February 4, 2018, Mulroney expressed concern to the Toronto Star that sending her children to private school might be used as political fodder, and after the leaders' debate on February 28, 2018, she walked away from the post debate scrum when being asked about why she sends her children to private schools by the Ottawa Citizen's David Reevely. Mulroney was criticised by some, including Doug Ford, for living most of her adult life in the United States, but she dismissed that by saying: \\"I've lived the majority of my life in Canada and Ontario\\". Also running for the leadership were Ford, Christine Elliott, Tanya Granic Allen and, for a time, Patrick Brown who registered as a candidate on February 18, 2018, before withdrawing a week later. Notwithstanding her previous statements of having \\"great confidence\\" in Brown, Mulroney tweeted disapproval of his decision to run. Mulroney urged Brown to resign from the leadership race and asked the other candidates to join her call. However, Ford and Elliott did not do so with Elliott specifically saying that the party had decided who could run for leader. Mulroney criticised Ford and Elliott for their stance. Two workers in Mulroney's camp privately admitted to CBC News in separate conversations that she was not in the lead while two former MPs who had endorsed Mulroney, Paul Calandra and Parm Gill, moved their support to Elliott. In the leadership election held March 10, 2018, Mulroney came in third, behind winner Doug Ford and runner-up Christine Elliott, and was eliminated after the second ballot. 42nd Parliament of Ontario In the 2018 Ontario Election, Mulroney was elected to serve as the MPP for York—Simcoe during the 42nd Parliament of Ontario. On June 29, 2018, Premier Doug Ford appointed Mulroney to be the Attorney General of Ontario, despite never having practised law in Canada, and Minister of Francophone Affairs in his Executive Council. Mulroney voted in support of the Ford government's September 2018 proposal to use Section 33 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, commonly called the \\"notwithstanding clause\\", to overrule a judge's decision that legislation intended to shrink the size of Toronto City Council was in fact in violation of Charter rights. For this position, she faced widespread condemnation from constitutional experts and politicians of all parties, particularly with respect to her duty to ensure the sanctity of the judicial process as Attorney General. In April 2019, as Attorney General of Ontario, Mulroney led a sweeping implementation of the budget austerity measures of the Ford administration on the justice file. This included a $133 million cut to Legal Aid Ontario, cutting over 30 percent of their anticipated $456-million provincial allocation for basic access to justice services for Ontario's low-income citizens. The cuts were targeted at the community legal clinics serving the most vulnerable communities according to advocates. One group called the cuts a \\"directed attack\\" against Toronto and groups linked with challenges to the Ford political agenda. Cabinet positions= Political positions  After winning her riding nomination, Mulroney criticized the Liberal government for its minimum wage hike. During the leadership, Mulroney stated that she was in favour of using the \\"People's Guarantee\\" as a \\"starting point\\" for the PCPO's 2018 election campaign. She is opposed to the introduction of a carbon tax. She supports cuts in hydro rates and child care rebates, and remained committed to spending $1 billion to build Hamilton's light rail transit system. until Dec 23, 2019 when she publicly announced that the province was withdrawing the promised funding.  Personal life  Mulroney is married to Andrew Lapham, former executive advisor at Blackstone Canada, former principal at Onex Corporation, and the son of former Harper's Magazine editor Lewis H. Lapham and grandson of Lewis A. Lapham. Mulroney and Lapham met at a blind date at a pub which was set up by one of her Harvard friends. They were married on September 16, 2000, at Church of Saint-Léon-de-Westmount in Westmount, Quebec. It was covered by The New York Times as well as Canadian media.

He worked with the Middlebury Men's Varsity Lacrosse Team and other Middlebury sport teams for several decades. In 2004, Kohn was inducted into the Lacrosse Hall of Fame. He is one of the few people who did not play the sport to have been inducted into the Hall of Fame. In 2005, a movie was created about Kohn, called Keeper of the Kohn. In his later years, Kohn spent his winters in Cape May, NJ and Florida, returning to Middlebury each spring to work with the lacrosse team. At age 77, Peter Kohn died at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, PA. Kohn was unable to recover from a heart attack, which occurred while on a fishing trip near his home in Cape May, N.J., on August 1, 2009.  Early life  Kohn was born in Baltimore, Maryland to Bernard Kohn, whose family owned the Hochschild Kohn's department store chain. As a boy, Kohn struggled athletically and academically due to undiagnosed autism.  Professional career  In 1954, Kohn began as a field manager at Baltimore's Park School. He moved to Middlebury becoming the manager of the men's lacrosse team from 1981-1988. He was also the equipment manager until 2003.  Legacy  Peter was always determined and led by example. Even through a rainy day, Peter always gave it his all. Peter would walk up and down the sideline offering water, dry towels and items from his canvas tote bag. He would crawl through bushes and under bleachers to retrieve lost lacrosse balls. And occasionally, Peter would even lead the team stretch, counting in all sorts of languages from \\"German\\" to \\"Alien\\". Before a game, Peter would rehearse his pregame speech in his hotel room. Before every game, a team member would ask him, \\"Hey Pete what time is it,\\" and Peter would respond with: \\"It's time to beat (team in competition that day).\\"  Peter Kohn Award  Every year an award is given to a member of the national lacrosse community who best represents the idea that \\"Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.\\" (John 15:13).

A. McEvoy and N.Correll. Materials that couple sensing, actuation, computation, and communication, Science Vol. 347 no. 6228 DOI: 10.1126/science.1261689 Robotic materials can be considered computational metamaterials in that they extend the original definition of a metamaterialR.

That is, unlike in a conventional metamaterial, the relationship between a specific excitation and response is governed by sensing, actuation, and a computer program that implements the desired logic. History The idea of creating materials that embed computation is closely related to the concept of programmable matter, a term coined in 1991T. Toffoli, N. Margolus, Programmable matter: Concepts and realization. Physica D 47, 263–272 (1991). 10.1016/0167-2789(91)90296 by Toffoli and Margolus, describing dense arrays of computing elements that could solve complex finite- element like simulations of material systems, and then later developed to describe a class of materials consisting of identical, mobile building blocks, also known as catoms that are fully reconfigurable, therefore allowing materials to arbitrarily change their physical properties. Robotic materials build up on the original concept of programmable matter, but focus on the structural properties of the embedding polymers without claim of universal property changes. Here the term \\"robotic\\" refers to the confluence of sensing, actuation, and computation. Applications Robotic materials allow to off- load computation inside the material, most notably signal processing that arises during high-bandwidth sensing applications or feedback control that is required by fine-grained distributed actuation. Examples for such applications include camouflage, shape change, load balancing, and robotic skinsRobotic materials: Changing with the world around them, phys.org, March 19, 2015. as well as equipping robots with more autonomy by off-loading some of the signal processing and controls into the material.Autonomous Materials will let future robots change color and shift shape, Popular Science, March 19, 2015. Research challenges Research in robotic materials ranges from the device- level and manufacturing to the distributed algorithms that equip robotic materials with intelligence.Materials that Couple Sensing, Actuation, Computation and Communication, Computing Community Consortium (CCC) \\"Great Innovative Ideas\\", November 2, 2015. As such it intersects the fields of composite materials, sensor networks, distributed algorithms, and due to the scale of the involved computation, swarm intelligence. Unlike any individual field, the design of the structure, sensors, actuators, communication infrastructure, and distributed algorithms are tightly intertwined. For example, the material properties of the structural material will affect how signals to be sensed propagate through the material, at which distance computational elements need to be spaced, and what signal processing needs to be done. Similarly, structural properties are closely related to the actual embedding of computing and communication infrastructure. Capturing these effects therefore requires interdisciplinary collaboration between materials, computer science, and robotics.

History  Sigma Beta Delta was founded by Beta Gamma Sigma on January 16, 1994, in La Jolla, California. Beta Gamma Sigma, itself an honor society for students enrolled in AACSB-accredited business schools, formed Sigma Beta Delta to recognize the achievements of students at regionally accredited universities that lacked AACSB accreditation. Since its formation, Sigma Beta Delta has been considered the \\"sister\\" honor society of Beta Gamma Sigma. The organizations have many shared goals, including the promotion and recognition of scholarship in business-related fields of study. Initially a small, U.S.-based honor society, Sigma Beta Delta's three founding chapters were established at Belmont University, North Carolina State University, and Morehouse College. Sigma Beta Delta was admitted to the Association of College Honor Societies in 1994, shortly after it was founded. As of January 16, 2016, Sigma Beta Delta has 277 active chapters across the United States, and a total membership of 68,658 undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral degree members.  Membership  Eligibility for membership in Sigma Beta Delta applies to all students at a non-AACSB, regionally accredited school of business in the United States, who rank in the upper 20 percent of their undergraduate or graduate class. All students enrolled in a regionally accredited doctoral program in business are eligible to join the honor society upon graduation. Generally, undergraduate and graduate students must have completed at least half of their coursework in order to be considered for membership. An offer of membership, once accepted, is a lifetime distinction for high-achieving students of business programs.  Publications  The national office of Sigma Beta Delta publishes the Aspirations newsletter each semester. This newsletter, distributed among members nationwide, reviews the honor society's achievements, fundraising goals, new chapters, and fellowship awards to students at chapters across the country.

The Magic Labyrinth is a labyrinth game with the objective of finding treasures hidden in the labyrinth. The twist in the game is that the labyrinth's walls are invisible. Rules The game has a wizard setting and is played over a 6x6 rectangular grid representing a labyrinth. The labyrinth's walls are actually placed under the board, invisible to the players. The player's pieces consist of a wizard piece on top of the board, and a metal sphere underneath the board, connected to the wizard piece by a magnet. The pieces start out from the four corners of the board. At the start of the game, a treasure is randomly selected, and the players have to get to the square representing the treasure. On his/her turn, a player throws a die deciding how many spaces his/her piece can move. If the player's piece hits a wall, the metal sphere underneath the board falls off, audible to the player. When this happens, the player forfeits his/her turn, having to move his/her piece back to the starting corner. The idea of the game is that the players can't actually see the walls, only learning of them when they hit them. To be able to proceed, players must learn to memorise the locations of the walls. If a player successfully reaches a treasure, he/she claims it as his/her own, and another treasure is randomly dealt. The first player to claim five treasures wins.

It also aims to improve the safeguards on the exercise of those powers.  Drafting and scrutiny  In 2014 the UK government asked David Anderson, the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, to review the operation and regulation of investigatory powers available to law enforcement and intelligence agencies, in particular the interception of communications and communications data, and to recommend change. This report was published in June 2015 and recommended a new law to clarify these powers. The Draft Investigatory Powers Bill was published in November 2015, with a large number of accompanying documents, and a Joint Committee of the House of Commons and House of Lords was established to scrutinise the draft bill. Some parts of the bill referring to bulk personal datasets came into effect in November 2015, before parliamentary scrutiny began. The Joint Committee published its pre- legislative scrutiny report in March 2016. The Government accepted the vast majority of its 198 recommendations, together with the recommendations of two other parliamentary committees that had scrutinised the draft Bill, and the revised bill was introduced in the House of Commons, where it was subject to debate by Members of Parliament. In March 2016 the House of Commons passed the Investigatory Powers Bill on its second reading by 281 votes to 15, moving the bill to the committee stage.Ryan Gallagher, U.K. Parliament Debates 'Snoopers' Charter, The Intercept (March 15, 2016).

At the committee stage constitutional, technology, and human rights issues were examined. The Labour Chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, Harriet Harman, said: At this stage, at the insistence of the Labour Party, the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation was commissioned to conduct a further review of the operational case for the bulk powers reserved under the Bill to the UK intelligence agencies: bulk interception, bulk collection of metadata, bulk equipment interference and the retention and use of bulk datasets. That review was conducted with the help of a small, security-cleared expert team, and together with 60 case studies, was published in August 2016. Like the 2014-15 reports of the PCLOBhttps://pclob.gov/library/215-Report_on_the_Telephone_Records_Program.pdf (s215); https://pclob.gov/library/702-Report-2.pdf (s702). and National Academy of Sciences in the US, it is a significant information source for the utility of so-called mass surveillance techniques On 16 November 2016 the House of Lords approved the final version of the Investigatory Powers Bill, leaving only the formality of Royal Assent to be completed before the Bill became law. On 21 December 2016, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) declared that the generalised retention of certain types of personal data is unlawful, although little is known as to how this will affect the Investigatory Powers Act at this stage. As of 29 January 2017, many sources have since reported on the Investigatory Powers Act as if it is currently in action. Draft codes of practice laid out by the Home Office in February 2017 did not provide insight on the Government's communications data code of practise, as it was for the Court of Appeal to decide how to apply the December ruling of the ECJ on data retention in member states. It was then reported in late February 2017 that the aspects of the Bill forcing communications service providers to retain data had been \\"mothballed\\" due to the ECJ ruling on the \\"general and indiscriminate\\" retention of communications data being illegal.  Provisions of the Act  The Act:; ; * introduced new powers, and restated existing ones, for UK intelligence agencies and law enforcement to carry out targeted interception of communications, bulk collection of communications data, and bulk interception of communications;; ; * created an Investigatory Powers Commission (IPC) to oversee the use of all investigatory powers, alongside the oversight provided by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament and the Investigatory Powers Tribunal. The IPC consists of a number of serving or former senior judges. It combined and replaced the powers of the Interception of Communications Commissioner, Intelligence Services Commissioner, and Chief Surveillance Commissioner; * established a requirement for a judge serving on the IPC to review warrants for accessing the content of communications and equipment interference authorised by a Secretary of State before they come into force; * required communication service providers (CSPs) to retain UK internet users' \\"Internet connection records\\" – which websites were visited but not the particular pages and not the full browsing history – for one year; * allowed police, intelligence officers and other government department managers (listed below) to see the Internet connection records, as part of a targeted and filtered investigation, without a warrant; * permitted the police and intelligence agencies to carry out targeted equipment interference, that is, hacking into computers or devices to access their data, and bulk equipment interference for national security matters related to foreign investigations; * placed a legal obligation on CSPs to assist with targeted interception of data, and communications and equipment interference in relation to an investigation; foreign companies are not required to engage in bulk collection of data or communications; * maintained an existing requirement on CSPs in the UK to have the ability to remove encryption applied by the CSP; foreign companies are not required to remove encryption; * put the Wilson Doctrine on a statutory footing for the first time as well as safeguards for other sensitive professions such as journalists, lawyers and doctors; * provided local government with some investigatory powers, for example to investigate someone fraudulently claiming benefits, but not access to Internet connection records; * created a new criminal offence for unlawfully accessing internet data; * created a new criminal offence for a CSP or someone who works for a CSP to reveal that data has been requested.  Investigatory Powers Commissioner  The Act created the role of Investigatory Powers Commissioner to provide independent oversight of the use of investigatory powers by intelligence agencies, police forces and other public authorities. In March 2017 Lord Justice Sir Adrian Fulford, a Court of Appeal judge, was appointed as first Commissioner for a three-year term. His office (IPCO) will have fifteen senior judges as judicial commissioners, a technical advisory panel of scientific experts, and around 50 staff. In January 2019 the Home Office blocked the appointment of Eric King as head of investigations at IPCO, citing national security grounds. King had previously been director of the Don't Spy On Us coalition, and deputy director of Privacy International for five years. King commented \\"The problem, at its heart, is that there’s a conflict as to whether my previous work and views are a positive or negative thing.

Although the Home Office said the Bill will be compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, the content of the draft Bill has raised concerns about the impact on privacy. Privacy campaigners say the bill clearly lays out the mass surveillance powers that would be at the disposal of the security services, and want it amended so that the surveillance is targeted and based on suspicion and argue that the powers are so sweeping, and the bill's language so general, that not just the security services but also government bodies will be able to analyse the records of millions of people even if they are not under suspicion. In January 2016 a report published by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament recommended that the bill should focus on the right to privacy. Committee chairman, Conservative MP Dominic Grieve, said: \\"We have therefore recommended that the new legislation contains an entirely new part dedicated to overarching privacy protections, which should form the backbone of the draft legislation around which the exceptional powers are then built. This will ensure that privacy is an integral part of the legislation rather than an add-on.\\" The committee also recommended that Class bulk personal dataset warrants are removed from the legislation.

Legal challenge and ruling  In November 2016, a petition demanding the law be repealed gained 100,000 signatures. In December 2016, pornographic media site xHamster redirected UK traffic to the petition. In March 2017, Liberty, a human rights organisation, raised £50,000 via crowd funding towards legal actions against the bill. Silkie Carlo, policy officer at Liberty, said: In April 2018 the UK high court ruled that the Investigatory Powers Act violates EU law. The government had until 1 November 2018 to amend the legislation. On 31 October 2018 The Data Retention and Acquisition Regulations 2018 came into force to address this ruling. These regulations increased the threshold for accessing communications data only for the purposes of serious crime (defined as offences which are capable of being sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 12 months or more) and requires that authorities consult an independent Investigatory Powers Commissioner before requesting data. The regulations also included a loophole where rapid approval can be made internally without independent approval but with a three-day expiry and with subsequent review by the independent body. Most debates about the regulations have been about the definition of \\"serious crime\\" with many arguing that the threshold should be at three years.

When a product has the Safer Choice label, it means that every intentionally-added ingredient in the product has been evaluated by EPA scientists. Only the safest possible functional ingredients are allowed in products with the Safer Choice label. Safer Choice is a voluntary partnership program that is grounded in more than 40 years of EPA experience in evaluating the human health and environmental characteristics of chemicals. As of January 2015, more than 2,000 products qualify to carry the Safer Choice label. Businesses can apply to become partners by submitting their products to the Safer Choice program for review.  Introduction  Since the mid-2000s, EPA's label for safer chemical products has been known as the Design for the Environment, or the DfE label. After spending more than a year collecting ideas and discussing new label options with stakeholders, such as product manufacturers and environmental and health advocates, the EPA took its ideas to consumers and asked what worked best. The result is the new Safer Choice label. Products that carry the Safer Choice label must meet requirements for: * Safer chemical ingredients * Product performance * Packaging sustainability * Ingredient disclosure * Surveillance and audits * Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) emissions  History  EPA’s Safer Choice Program is a renaming of the Design for the Environment (DfE) Safer Product Labeling Program. DfE began in the early 1990s as an innovative, voluntary program to help companies consider human health, environmental, and economic effects of chemicals and technologies. DfE started the Safer Product Labeling Program as a project with the chemical-based products industry (e.g. cleaners and detergents) to help leading companies use safer chemicals to make high-performing products. DfE developed this certification program based on its Standard for Safer Products and safer chemical criteria, allowing companies to differentiate their products in the marketplace and making it easier for consumers and business purchasers to identify products that are safer for workers, families, pets, and the environment. Using its science-based criteria that defines safer chemistry by chemical class, Safer Choice has helped the industry innovate and develop safer chemicals and chemical-based products. A number of companies have designed new chemicals to meet Safer Choice criteria, or invested in research to show that existing chemicals are safer. In March 2015, the Safer Choice label replaced the DfE product label, marking the transition from the Safer Product Labeling Program to the Safer Choice Program. The new Safer Choice label helps consumers, businesses and institutional buyers easily recognize products that have earned EPA’s Safer Choice certification. In addition to the Safer Choice label above, Safer Choice offers an optional label that product manufacturers may use on products designated for businesses, office buildings, sports venues and schools. Safer Choice also has a label that indicates that a product is fragrance-free, to help consumers who prefer products without fragrance.  Meaning of the label  When a product carries the Safer Choice label, it means that every intentionally added ingredient—no exceptions, no de minimis—in the product has been reviewed by EPA scientists. Only products that meet the Safer Choice Standard, which includes stringent human health and environmental criteria, are allowed to carry the label. Safer Choice evaluates the individual constituents of every proprietary component of a product to ensure that it does not contain chemicals that may present potential health or environmental effects, including ingredients used in small percentages, like fragrances, preservatives, and dyes. Safer Choice further requires its partners to undergo annual reviews, including on-site audits, to verify product ingredients and ensure compliance with all Safer Choice Program requirements.  Qualifications to receive the label  Companies that enter into partnership with the Safer Choice Program and meet the Safer Choice Standard do so voluntarily. Companies that manufacture Safer Choice products have invested heavily in research and reformulation to ensure that their ingredients and finished products line up on the greener end of the health and environmental spectrum. These companies are leaders in safer products and sustainability.  Types of products Safer Choice labels  Safer Choice labels a wide range of products for consumer and industry use, including: * All-purpose cleaners * Athletic field paints * Bathroom cleaners * Car cleaners * Carpet cleaners * Degreasers * Dish detergents and hand soaps * Floor care products * Glass cleaners * Laundry products * Metal cleaners * Pet care products * Septic treatment products * Wood cleaners * Fragrances  Safer Chemical Ingredients List  The Safer Chemical Ingredients List (SCIL) is a list of chemical ingredients that the Safer Choice Program has evaluated and determined to be safer than traditional chemical ingredients used for the same function. This list is arranged by functional-use class and is designed to help manufacturers find safer chemical alternatives that meet the criteria of the Safer Choice Program. Safer Choice ensures that no confidential or trade secret information appears in the list. The Safer Choice Standard and the Criteria for Safer Chemical Ingredients are protective and address a broad range of potential toxicological effects (e.g., carcinogenicity, chronic toxicity and aquatic toxicity). All chemicals in the listing are among the safest for their functional use.  Safer Choice Partner of the Year Awards  In 2015, the Safer Choice Program launched its Partner of the Year Awards to recognize program participants who have demonstrated leadership in furthering safer chemistry and products.

It was designed by Belgian pioneer Louis de Monge and built in France in the mid-1920s. Design and development The Buscaylet-de Monge 7-4 was built in 1923 as a one third scale flight model of the proposed de Monge 72 (or 7-2) tri-motor. The de Monge 7-5 was a development of the 1923 aircraft, retaining its configuration but with new engines and revised wings, tail, accommodation and undercarriage. Structurally the de Monge 7-5 was an all-wood aircraft. It had no fuselage but instead a thickened section of wing between the two booms which supported the tail. This rectangular inner panel had an airfoil section profile and an increased span of , 15% larger than on the 7.4 but with the same chord and thickness of . The increase in span allowed the engines, new Bugatti water-cooled car-type , inline engines to be placed far enough apart that the propeller disks did not overlap, obviating the need for engine canting. Each engine had a rectangular radiator under it. As before the centre-section contained two side-by-side seats but their cockpits were now separate and provided with windscreens and faired headrests. As before they were positioned between the two spruce and plywood box spars, with fuel tanks on either side. Forward of the cockpit the centre-section was ply skinned, with fabric covering elsewhere. The much thinner section cantilever outer wing panels beyond the booms had the strong straight taper of its predecessor but with elliptical, instead of straight, clipped, tips. They carried long but not full-span ailerons. Like the centre-section the outer wings were built on pairs of spars. The 7-5's twin booms were attached to brackets on the rear corners of the centre-section; the booms were longer than on the 7-4, placing the elevator hinge about further behind the centre-section trailing edge. Curved, balanced control surfaces replaced the earlier unbalanced ones. Its elevator was elliptical in plan with the straight-edged tailplane projecting forward. It had a tailskid undercarriage with independently mounted wheels apart. Each wheel was mounted on its own axle, about long and hinged at its inner end to a vertical strut from the inboard fuselage underside and another, outward leaning one above the axle to the centre-section near its edge. A faired vertical leg with a steel tube core from near the edge supported the outer axle end on a rubber shock absorber. Four cables supplied fore-and-aft rigidity. The de Monge 7-5 was exhibited at the 1924 9th Paris Salon as an experimental type. The exact date of its first flight is not known but flight trials were ongoing in July 1925. By January 1926 the type was described as powered by Vaslin engines, with a top speed of and an endurance at full power of 3.50 hrs. It was \\"readily covertible\\" into an ambulance aircraft with room for one wounded man and a nurse, or for two wounded. It is not known if these engines were ever fitted nor if any examples beyond the prototype were completed. Even though its primary purpose was to assist the design of the de Monge 72, because of its low power and aerodynamic cleanliness the de Monge 7-5 was, like the de Monge 7-4 before it, seen as a contender in fuel economy based competitions and for endurance and distance flight records. In May 1926 Captain Cousin was preparing for an endurance record attempt, flying continuously between Paris and Rouen. In July 1926 the 7-5, sponsored by its propeller maker Lumière, was one of seventeen aircraft from six countries entered in the Concours d'Avions Economique, held in August. There was a suggestion in December 1926 that the 7-5, re-engined with Salmson radials of and carrying of fuel might have a range of .

Tallahassee, Florida, Anti- Corruption Act  In 2014, voters in Tallahassee, Florida, approved a city charter amendment modeled after the AACA. The law established a city ethics commission, imposed stricter contribution limits on candidates for city office, and created a public financing system. The initiative passed with the support of a politically diverse coalition of local advocates, including the Chair of the Florida Tea Party Network, the former President of the Florida League of Women Voters, the Chairman of Florida Common Cause, and a former Democratic County Commissioner. The new ethics laws put in place by the Tallahassee Anti-Corruption Act limit campaign contributions to city candidates to $250 per donor, provide each voter with a tax rebate of up to $25 to contribute to the candidate of their choice, enact an ethics code that includes conflict-of-interest policies, and establish an ethics board to enforce the rules.  Gil Fulbright and the Honest Gil Campaign  Gil Fulbright is a satirical presidential candidate created by RepresentUs designed to bring attention to corruption. Played by actor Frank Ridley, Gil ran a fake Senate campaign in Kentucky in 2014. In 2016, the character announced a run for president of the United States. Gil Fulbright's presidential launch video garnered over 1 million views in less than 24 hours. Fulbright went on to beat several real candidates in a 2016 presidential straw poll, and out-fundraised Democratic presidential candidate Lincoln Chafee.  Justice for Sale  In June 2020, RepresentUs launched a campaign focused on highlighting various problems in America's criminal justice system. Actor Omar Epps and voting rights activist Desmond Meade narrate a video aimed at educating the public about these problems.  Annual conference  RepresentUs held its first conference called the \\"Unrig Summit\\" in February 2018 in New Orleans. In March 2019, 2,000 attended the conference in Nashville, including United Nations official Kate Gilmore, gun control advocate Emma González, voting rights activist Desmond Meade, and actress and comedian Sasheer Zamata, who spoke to attendees. Leading up to the conference, actress Jennifer Lawrence (who is a RepresentUs board member) released a short film detailing the organization's political aims to a general audience. According to RepresentUs, the summit is the largest national event that attempts to address underlining causes of dysfunction in US government.

It was built from to . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 March 2007.  History  The Second World War buildings at Maryborough airport were constructed during the early 1940s as part of the facilities of a military aerodrome serving Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) No 3 Wireless Air Gunner School and No 3 Air Navigation School. Following the war, Maryborough City Council redeveloped the aerodrome as a civil airport retaining these buildings in use. Maryborough was established in the late 1840s to supply sheep stations on the Burnett River and provide an outlet for their wool. The Port of Maryborough was a port of entry and during the 1860s and 1870s Maryborough flourished as the principal port of the nearby Gympie goldfield and as an outlet for timber and sugar. The establishment of manufacturing plants and primary industries sustained its growth as a major regional centre. As such, it had a small civil airfield before the Second World War. In 1938, in response to the threatened outbreak of war, an Australian Air Force was developed, which included the establishment of a major base at Amberley in southern Queensland. Following the First World War and the development of civil aviation in the 1920s and 1930s, it had become apparent that air power would play an important role modern warfare. At the outbreak of war in 1939, urgent consideration was given not only to the construction of aeroplanes, but also to the training of technicians, pilots and aircrew. It was realised that although British factories could step up production of aeroplanes and equipment, it would not be able to train all of the aircrew needed to operate them. The Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS) was set up in December 1939 and was an agreement between Britain and the Dominions, particularly Canada, Australia and New Zealand, for aircrews to be trained in those countries for service with the Royal Air Force. Australia agreed initially to provide 28,000 personnel over three years; a time span later extended, and eventually trained some 37,000 airmen. All Australian trainees did their initial training in Australia; 7/9ths completed their training here and 2/9ths doing advanced training overseas before being posted to squadrons involved in the defence of Britain and the conduct of the war in Europe, North Africa and the Mediterranean. The EATS scheme was conducted through 49 airfields in Australia, Queensland having EATS units at Amberley, Archerfield, Bundaberg, Kingaroy, Maryborough and Sandgate. Maryborough was chosen as a base for a Wireless Air Gunner School (3 WAGS) and an Air Navigation School (3 ANS). The site was secured for RAAF use in December 1940 under the provisions of National Security (General) Regulations, but the existing airfield was inadequate and the Air Board set about acquiring more land to extend runways and facilities. The aerodrome covered an area of approximately 355 acres comprising the civil aerodrome on State land vested in the trusteeship of Maryborough City Council (133 acres), several holdings owned by the Council (84 acres), land held by 15 different private owners and public roads (138 acres). The land acquired was partially developed and included a sawmill, service station and several dairies. £257,928 was allocated for buildings, construction works, engineering services, furniture and fittings. By April 1941 the land was being cleared and runways and buildings constructed. The training school was opened 18 September 1941 and the first intake was on 16 November when work was still being carried out. On 7 December 1941 the United States of America entered the war following the bombing of American ships by Japanese aircraft at Pearl Harbour in Hawaii. The EATS scheme was suspended for reassessment in response to the perceived threat to Australia. However, Australia initially had few planes and it was decided in February 1942 by the War Cabinet to continue the scheme but retain enough aircrew in Australia to crew home and Pacific based squadrons and recall some experienced aircrew. Australian and American personnel poured into Queensland as plans for the defence of Australia and the conduct of the war in the Pacific were quickly implemented. The demand on materials, services and labour was beyond the scope of local resources and manufacture. Queensland had a small population and no heavy manufacturing, as the southern states had. The first buildings erected at the outbreak of war were \\"P\\" series huts, pre-cut of timber and galvanised iron and assembled on site. There are three huts of this type remaining at Maryborough. A prefabrication scheme was then proposed whereby components were made in the south, shipped to where they were needed and assembled on site. Designs took into account the scarcity of labour and of some materials. Bellman aircraft hangars were such prefabricated buildings and contracts were let for the construction of two Bellman hangars for Maryborough. The war in the Pacific quickly escalated as the Philippines and Singapore were attacked by Japan. Darwin was first bombed on 19 February 1942 and 14,000 Australians were taken prisoner following the fall of Singapore in February 1942. From April 1942, Maryborough's activities included Recruit Training. No 3 Recruit Depot operated at Maryborough until July 1943 and No 6 Recruit Depot from November 1944 to June 1945. These units gave basic training to about 4000 recruits. Women (WAAAFs) were also stationed at Maryborough. The strategic air bases moved north following the theatres of the air campaign. The Battle of the Coral Sea took place in early May 1942 and the Battle of Midway in June 1942. Japanese troops landed at Gona on the north coast of Papua New Guinea on 21 July 1942. Hospitals at airfields were to be readied as field hospital for expected incoming battle casualties. Maryborough aerodrome facilities were also used for airframe overhaul and a third and fourth Bellman hangar were erected at Maryborough sometime in 1944, though on 15 August 1944 it was decided to close number 3 WAGS Maryborough and train Wireless Operators at Ballarat instead. The facilities at the base were then used by RAAF 1 Radar School. The training school closed on closed on 6 December 1944. Following the victory in Europe in May 1945 the Royal Navy formed the British Pacific Fleet. In June 1945 HMS Nabstock unit arrived in Maryborough. This was a MONAB, a mobile naval air base for training crew and the assembly of aircraft for the British Pacific Fleet. A number of Royal Navy Air Squadrons were based in Maryborough until late 1945. The RAAF station was closed after the departure of the last of these, MONAB VI HMS Nabstock in November 1945. Following the cessation of hostilities, control of the aerodrome was transferred to the Department of Civil Aviation on 31 July 1946. There were 127 buildings on site at its peak and all those not needed by Civil Aviation needs were processed for disposal. Civil Aviation elected to retain the hospital, motor transport garages, two hangars, a flight office, a workshop, store, inflammables store and two latrines. One of the hangars was later removed, though most of the selected buildings remain on site. Some concrete slabs and other traces of RAAF buildings can still be seen dotted about the airport. The runways have been resurfaced and the third cross strip existing during the war has gone. The tree lined entrance drive is still the main access to the airport. The airport is owned and operated by Fraser Coast Regional Council (which replaced Maryborough City Council). It is an active civil facility regularly used by private and chartered aircraft, crop sprayers and maintenance enterprises and by the Maryborough Aero Club.  Description  Second World War RAAF Buildings, 2006 The Maryborough Airport is located to the north west of the city centre off Saltwater Road. It has two runways; the main runway is bitumen surfaced and is long. The cross strip is grassed and is long. There are trees dotted along the entrance road, though it is unknown if any of the trees are wartime plantings. To the left of the drive is an open area. To the right hand side of the drive is a row of Second World War structures. These comprise : * Building A - the former inflammables store, is a small building, square in plan, and set on a concrete slab. It is clad in fibrous cement sheeting and has a hipped roof clad in corrugated iron and topped with a large ventilator. It is currently used for storage. * Building B, the former Motor Transport Garage, is a rectangular building with a skillion roof. Its walls and roof are clad in corrugated iron and it has six narrow roller doors along the long axis facing away from the drive. It has casement windows on the northern side, two of which have sheet metal sunhoods with scalloped edges. It is now used for storage. * Building C is a set of latrines and is a rectangular building clad in corrugated set on a concrete slab. It has a gabled roof clad in corrugated iron. There is a narrow band of glass louvres set below the eaves. * Building D is an adapted P1 hut and was the former Hospital/Sick Quarters, now used for community purposes. It is a rectangular building set on low stumps and clad in horizontal corrugated iron. sheeting. It has a gabled roof clad in corrugated iron and what appears to have been a wide front verandah is now built in with casement windows. There is an extension at the rear. There are sheet metal canopies with scalloped edges suspended over the doors. * Building E is also a P1 hut and was formerly used as a parachute-packing shed. It is now the airport terminal and has had some alterations made for this purpose, including the adding of a covered baggage area. To the north of the terminal and near the edge of the tarmac are: *Bellman hangar located at Maryborough Airport, 2010Building F, a Bellman aircraft hangar. This is a prefabricated galvanised iron structure with a concrete floor. It has a low-pitched gabled roof and large sliding doors running along channels across the front. * Building G, which is also a P1 hut and is probably the most intact. It has a wide veranda facing the runways and was formerly a Flight Office. The Maryborough Aero Club now uses it.  Heritage listing  The Second World War RAAF Buildings at Maryborough Airport was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 March 2007 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The surviving RAAF buildings at Maryborough airport are important in illustrating the measures taken for the training of aircrew during the Second World War under the Empire Air Training School scheme. Aircrew trained at Maryborough served with the RAF in many theatres of war and with the RAAF. The base was also used for training naval pilots to serve with the British Pacific Fleet. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Bellman hangar and field hospital are now uncommon in Queensland as examples of their type still in their original locations. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Although most of the buildings that were on site during the Second World War have been removed, those remaining are indicative of the types of buildings and facilities constructed and which were necessary for the operation of a wartime air base. These include a hangar, flight office, field hospital, parachute packing shed, motor transport garage, inflammables store and latrines. In conjunction with wartime records and plans these buildings demonstrate the function of the aerodrome.

() commonly known as Abu Muhammad al-Sufyani () was an Umayyad nobleman and a pretender to the Umayyad Caliphate, which had been overthrown by the Abbasid Caliphate in early 750. Abu Muhammad led a revolt against the Abbasids, but his forces were defeated and he fled to Arabia, where he was killed in the early part of the Abbasid Caliph al-Mansur's reign. Biography=Origins Genealogical tree of the Sufyanids, the ruling family of the Umayyad Caliphate between 661 and 684, showing Abu Muhammad's ancestry. Abu Muhammad was a member of the Umayyad family, related to Caliph al-Walid II ( 743–744) through the latter's grandmother. He adopted the name \\"al-Sufyani\\" as both a reference to his descent from Mu'awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan and a claim to being the early Islamic messianic figure, al-Sufyani. Abu Muhammad's messianic claim was embraced by many in Islamic Syria, particularly the people of Homs, who believed him to be a messiah-like figure who would destroy the rising Abbasid Caliphate.Cobb 2001, p. 47. Umayyad Caliph Marwan II (r. 744–750) had Abu Muhammad imprisoned in Harran for much of the second half of his reign. Abu Muhammad did not escape his incarceration when other inmates broke out; those inmates who did were caught and killed by Harran's inhabitants. Marwan released Abu Muhammad after his defeat by the Abbasids at the Battle of the Zab in January 750.Najeebabadi 2001, p. 246. Revolt Later in 750, the Qaysi general, Abu al-Ward, launched a revolt to defeat the Abbasids, rallying his kinsmen and other Qaysis and disavowing his allegiance to the Abbasid governor of Syria, Abdullah ibn Ali. Abu Muhammad joined the revolt as a leader of the Yamani tribal confederation of Homs and Palmyra. Abu Muhammad assumed political leadership of the revolt and issued a claim to leadership of the Umayyad Caliphate, reaching out for support from other Umayyad nobles. Abu al-Ward, meanwhile, served as the revolt's military commander. Although the intent of the revolt was to combat the Abbasids, particularly their Khorasani soldiers, it became a joint Qaysi–Yamani effort to gain control of the Umayyad Caliphate. al-Saffah as he receives pledges of allegiance in Kufa Despite an initial victory against the Abbasids led by Abd al-Samad ibn Ali at Qinnasrin, Abu Muhammad's forces were defeated near Homs. In the latter battle, Abu al-Ward and many of his kinsmen and Qaysi soldiers were killed, while Abu Muhammad fled to the desert town of Palmyra. The Abbasid commander Bassam ibn Ibrahim attempted and failed to capture Palmyra, but Abu Muhammad fled again, this time heading for Arabia. There, he found a safe haven near Uhud. Abu Muhammad and his family remained in Arabia until they were tracked down and killed during Caliph al-Mansur's reign (r. 754–775). Abu Muhammad's revolt, although short-lived, was the most significant threat the Abbasids faced in the period immediately following their successful revolution against the Umayyads. The revolt motivated the Abbasids to track down and eliminate other remnants of the Umayyad dynasty.Cobb 2001, p. 48. Sufyani The origin, role and identity of the Sufyani in Islamic tradition and Abu Muhammad's place in it is much debated. In the local Syrian context, the Sufyani was seen as a deliverer who would herald a golden age. But in Shi'ite tradition, due to his descent from Abu Sufyan—originally an opponent of Muhammad and the father of Mu'awiya, who was responsible for the downfall of Ali—he was an anti-Muslim figure, a sort of Islamic Antichrist and the opponent of the Mahdi.Cobb 2011, pp. 275–276 Scholars have debated the roots of this figure, with some claiming the existence of the legend already during Umayyad times. Henri Lammens suggested that Abu Muhammad was the origin of the legend, and that Syrians believed that after his execution he went into hiding—much like the Shi'ite Mahdi—and would reappear. Wilferd Madelung championed the view that the Sufyani was from the beginning an anti-Mahdi figure, and that he only acquired positive connotations in Syria at a later date.Roggema 2009, pp. 72–76 Several later rebels in Syria, from Abu Harb al-Mubarqa in the 840s all the way up to the 15th century, claimed the mantle of the Sufyani.Cobb 2011, p. 276 ReferencesBibliography  * Umayyad dynasty 8th-century deaths Rebellions against the Abbasid Caliphate Syria under the Abbasid Caliphate 750s conflicts People of the Third Fitna 8th-century Arabs ","title":"Abu Muhammad al-Sufyani"},{"id":"48509457","text":"Eduard (War) Van Overstraeten (8 May 1891, Wetteren – 9 December 1981, Brugge) was a Flemish communist activist and painter.

According to the Handbook of Texas, 50 people lived in the community in 2000. It is a part of the Palestine, Texas micropolitan area. History Originally, land was granted to José de Jesús Grande on October 28, 1828 with an understanding that he would attract people to populate and cultivate the land. The first African American settlers came to settle in this land as part of a Baptist migration to the area in 1833, and the organization of this community couldn't occur until it was over. By the early 1850s the community had a general store and a blacksmith shop. A post office was established at Bethel in 1852, and remained in operation until 1914. The first postmaster was named Charles Gilmore. The 1860 federal census recorded 300 inhabitants. After arriving in the community in 1848, a church building was erected on land donated by Henry Rampy on July 13, 1859, as well as a cemetery. It was given to three men named F.S. Jackson, Thomas Hudson, and Isaiah King so that Baptists, Methodists, and Cumberland Presbyterians could use both of them. The church was used for about forty years, after which it was abandoned and the building was torn down. The church cemetery was still in use in 1990, maintained by a voluntary association including descendants of the original grantor. For many years the cemetery was marked by a grove of huge cedar trees. Local legend says that during the Civil War the Confederacy had a campground near the cemetery. Soldiers who died were buried without grave markers. Instead, the cedar trees were planted so that after the war people could return and place markers. The economy of the area has always been largely agricultural. During the Great Depression of the 1930s the population dropped to thirty. After World War II there was a slight increase during the time of major oil discoveries, in which it had 90 occupants. It had 30 inhabitants from the 1970s to 1990. The cemetery is still in the community to this day. As of 2000 the population was fifty people.

According to the Handbook of Texas, 33 people lived in the community in 2000. It is a part of the Palestine, Texas micropolitan area. History A Primitive Baptist church was located in Blackfoot and was preached by a family member of a resident named Cynthia Anne Parker. The community's first settlers came from South Carolina and Mississippi and included Isaac Brown, Abe Hoff, and D.M. Crisp. The community was supposedly named when Uncle Hamp Hanks, Sr., was told that he was in the \\"Blackfoot nation\\" when he arrived there in 1870. Friendship Baptist church was the oldest church in the community, established in 1860. It stood on the line between Ward and Blackfoot. A man named Josh Taylor donated land to the community to build a First Christian church there in 1890, but one was already established a few years earlier. A post office was established at Blackfoot in 1886, and remained in operation until 1907. William U. Stafford was the postmaster, and mail was then routed through Montalba after the post office's closure in 1907. The most common agriculture raised in Blackfoot were hogs, corn, cattle, and cotton. The community's first cotton gin was built around 1880, and both Obe Childress and A.M. Kay operated it for over 60 years. The community then received electricity in 1941 when the REA New Area Co-op was established, and it eventually received telephone service in 1959. A field was uncovered in the area during a strike in the East Texas Oil Field in 1930, and had wells that continued to produce oil in the late 1950s. In 1935, a justice of the peace courthouse was established in the settlement and was used for precinct court at the start of the 20th century. This building stood on the Isabell farm until a windstorm blew it down in 1973. Before the Civil War, a total of 40 people lived in Blackfoot. It then decreased to 30 in 1896, and increased dramatically to 200 by 1936. The Friendship Baptist Church, a cemetery, and two dairies were located in Blackfoot in 1988.

According to the Handbook of Texas, the community had a population of 50 in 2000. It is located within the Palestine, Texas micropolitan area. History The area in what is now known as Brushy Creek today was first settled around 1840, and was originally part of Frankston and Montalba. A wagon train ended a long journey to the settlement in 1873, and held settlers from South Carolina. A post office was established at Brushy Creek that same year, and sources differ whether the community and post office were named for the nearby Brushy Creek, or a settler named Charles Murphy who named the community for his original home in South Carolina. The settlement had three churches, steam-powered gins and gristmills, grain and livestock that were shipped into the community, and a population of 300 settlers by 1884. A sawmill was built in the community in 1890, and it had a population of 100 inhabitants, as well as two coal mines operating just west of Brushy Creek. In 1900, it had a population of 131 inhabitants, and a year later, it had a Masonic lodge. Telephone service began operating in the community 13 years later, in 1914. The population returned to 100 and remained at that level from 1925 to 1948. The post office shut down in 1925. There were two churches, two to four businesses, and several homes in the 1930s and 1940s. The community lost 70% of its population in the late 1940s and 1950s, but the development of several oilfields in the community in the early 1960s caused a revival in the community. The population of the community then grew dramatically to 200 residents in 1964. The boom looked to be temporary, as the community's population plunged to 70 from 1970 to 1988. It had two churches, the Pisgah church and Brushy Creek church, as well as several homes in 1982. Both of these churches were still standing in 1985. Its population in both 1990 and 2000 was 50. Geography Brushy Creek stands at the junction of Farm to Market Roads 315 and 837 on a tributary of Brushy Creek northeast of Palestine in northeastern Anderson County. Education Brushy Creek had its own school in 1884. The community's schools in 1932 served 102 White students and 82 African American students living in the community. It had two schools in the 1930s and 1940s. Today the community is served by the Frankston Independent School District.

Scott was an American Great Lakes freighter that sank during the Great Lakes Storm of 1913 in Lake Huron, northeast of Thunder Bay Island (), while she was traveling from Cleveland, Ohio, United States to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States with a cargo of coal.  Construction and description  Isaac M. Scott was built in 1909 at the American Shipbuilding Co. shipyard in Lorain, Ohio, United States and launched on 12 June 1909. She was completed on 2 July 1909. The vessel was named for the president of the La Belle Iron Works, she served from 12 July 1909 until her demise on 11 November 1913. The ship was long, with a beam of and a draft of . The ship was assessed at . She had a triple-expansion steam engine driving a single screw propeller. At the time of her completion the Toledo Blade called her \\"One of the handsomest of the large freighters on the great lakes.\\"  Maiden voyage disaster  Isaac M. Scott after the collision with John B. Cowle Isaac M. Scotts maiden voyage was marred by tragedy. At 4:00 AM on 12 July 1909, while traveling northwest about off the Whitefish Point lighthouse in a dense fog, Isaac M. Scott rammed . John B. Cowle sank within a few minutes taking 14 of her 24 crewmen with her to the bottom. The survivors were picked up by Isaac M. Scott and taken back to port. Isaac M. Scott suffered damage to about 25 plates, which cost $30,000 in repairs. In March 1910, the Virginia Steamship Company settled claims filed by relatives of men lost in the sinking of John B. Cowle in the amount of $20,000. Following an investigation and hearings, the United States Steamboat Inspectors at Marquette suspended Captain Rogers of John B. Cowle, as well as its pilot, Edward E. Carlton, for 30 days. They further ruled that both ships had been sailing too fast for the weather conditions, and that John B. Cowle had failed to properly signal. F. W. Wertheimer, who had been piloting Isaac M. Scott that day, was subsequently beached for one year.  Great Lakes Storm of 1913 and sinking  In the pre- dawn hours of 9 November 1913, Isaac M. Scott, loaded with a cargo of coal worth $22,000 bound for Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States left Port Huron, Cleveland, Ohio, United States for the last time. She was one of several big freighters that passed out of the St. Clair River into Lake Huron and straight into the path of the deadliest storm in the Great Lakes history. Captain A. McArthur had been master of Isaac M. Scott since her maiden voyage back in 1909 and sailed with 27 other men on Isaac M. Scotts last voyage. On 9 November 1913 at around 10:30 a.m. H. B. Hawgood was running before the storm when they spotted Isaac M. Scott, still heading north and making heavy weather of it, off Tawas Point, Michigan, just hours before the brunt of the storm struck. When communication was restored and newspapers began carrying accounts of the storm Isaac M. Scott was only listed as missing. The body of Captain McArthur washed up at Southampton, Ontario, Canada on 11 December 1913 while still wearing his life preserver. One of her lifeboats was found north of the Chantrey Island lighthouse, off Southampton, Ontario. All 28 crew members perished in the disaster. The sinking of Isaac M. Scott resulted in increased efforts by the U.S. Weather Bureau toward better weather forecasting and more rapid communication of storm warnings. Isaac M. Scott was one of twelve vessels lost during the Great Lakes Storm of 1913. A storm described in the book: Lore of the Lakes, as \\"The most disastrous that has ever swept our Great Lakes, both from loss of life and property this unprecedented.\\" The storm of heavy snow, bitter cold winds and frightening high waves took the lives of an estimated 235 mariners, 178 of which were lost on Lake Huron alone.  Wreck  Isaac M. Scott remained missing for 63 years. Located by divers in 1976 about off Northpoint, Michigan, she rests upside down and is half buried in mud under of water with her nose still pointed into the storm.

She lives inGraeme and Sarah Lorimer, Stag Line, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1934. or near Philadelphia with her parents and—for a while—her older sister, Sylvia.Jack French, “Mary Mason, Star of Maudie’s Diary”, Radio Recall, Metropolitan Washington Old Time Radio Club, October 2008; accessed 2015.09.11. In Men Are Like Street Cars, she is sixteen.Graeme and Sarah Lorimer, Men Are Like Street Cars, Little, Brown and Company, Boston, 1934. In Stag Line, she is seventeen. She is eighteen in Heart Specialist, “practically a grown-up”, and remembers being “a naïve child of sixteen.” She is 18Graeme and Sarah Lorimer, First Love Farewell, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1940. or 19and anticipates her next birthday (in May) in First Love, Farewell. Many young adults come into Maudie's life, but the most constant presence is her friend, David (Davy) Dillon, with whom there are recurring romantic possibilities;E.g., Men Are Like Street Cars, pp. 187, 217; Stag Line, pp. 44-45, Heart Specialist, pp. 89, 240 (since she was 12), 243 (loved him my whole life), 275 (“faithful to Davy since I was twelve except for occasional exceptions”) she strings him along, but seems to settle on him more seriously late in the series. She has a comfortable upper-middle class life, and spends much of her time in romantic schemes and manipulations,E.g., Heart Specialist, p. 29. sometimes joined by such friends as Pauline. She says Davy has suspected her motives since she was 11. Numerous facts about Maudie and her family are disclosed in the course of the series, some of them showing the inconsistency of a serial work. Maudie is blonde, and proud of it; she weighs . Maudie's friends include Alix (her best female friend), Julie Purviance, who “has just about as much brains as beauty” (not much), Pauline (Pauly) Howard, and Mary Brandt and her brother Bill. Maudie's father is called variously Dick and Franklin. He is on the board (possibly the chair) of Memorial Hospital. Her mother's name is not revealed. Maudie's sister Sylvia marries Jerry, who is pointedly not a native Philadelphian. Davy has an older sister, Ting. His car is nicknamed the Fallen Arch, and he manages his school boxing team. He later goes to “the university” (presumably Penn), where he manages the tennis team and is probably a year or two older than Maudie.He is a sophomore (Heart Specialist p. 38) when she is 18 (Heart Specialist p. 121). Maudie has a cousin Joy from Baltimore, who visits and causes problems. Her other relatives include an Aunt Esther and Uncle Arthur in Philadelphia, and Aunts Rachel and Benevolence. Her godfather, “Uncle Ned” Chace, lives in Chicago after doing “something awful”, but redeems himself and reappears later. Maudie worries about “unfair discrimination against women” and observes that “it’s all right to have a mind if you use it to tell a man how wonderful he is.” Nevertheless, she opines that “A girl owes it to herself to occasionally get a man into a jam, but she owes it to him to always get him out.” She has a parody version of “The Star Spangled Banner”, and is a Republican. She is not much for books, “as personally I prefer to live life than to read about it.” She is quick with snappy banter, read Little Black Sambo as a child, and has an appendectomy. She has a coming-out garden party in June; she is the first girl in “our crowd” to have one. She had a crush on “Baldy” Baldridge, a steeplechase rider, “for years”. Background and development Graeme and Sarah Lorimer were a husband-and-wife author team, “two members of Philadelphia main line society”, who married in 1926 and had four children of their own.Vesta Kelling, “Slangsters of Subdebese Put Their Maudie On Air: ‘You Reprobate’ Is Not Criticism, It Is Really ‘Pouring On the Roses’”, The Milwaukee Journal, Sep. 12, 1941, “Green Sheet” p. 1. They specialized in literary works in the romantic comedy theme, such as “The Plot Sickens” and “Feature for June”, which became the movie June Bride. Graeme Lorimer was the fiction editor of the Ladies’ Home Journal and the son of George Horace Lorimer, long-time editor of The Saturday Evening Post.George Horace Lorimer family papers, Hargrett Rare Book & Manuscript Library, University of Georgia; accessed 2015.09.12. Sarah Lorimer was the daughter of Frank H. Moss, a Philadelphia housing developer and mortgage banker.Michael M. van Beuren. “Sarah M. Lorimer (Moss)”; accessed 2015.09.12. The Lorimers wrote at least 36 short stories featuring “Maudie” for the Ladies’ Home Journal in the 1930s and 1940s. According to family tradition, Graeme devised the plots, and Sarah provided the dialogue.See also Kelling, op.cit. (recounting that Sarah’s first try was rejected: it was funny, but the plot too complicated; Graeme suggested dropping the plot, and the story was published). Many of the characters and situations came from the authors’ own lives and those of their friends, who formed the basis of a number of the characters and plots. Sarah Lorimer's brother, Hunter Moss, and his wife Dora were the inspiration for Sylvia and Jerry, and Graeme Lorimer borrowed at least one of his younger brothers’ entanglements for a plot. When they ran low on their own witty banter, the Lorimers offered to pay teens they knew for any wisecracks that got published. They were sufficiently successful that Life magazine called them “lexicographers to the independent young American female.”“Subdebese: America’s Teen-Age Girls Speak Language of Their Own That Is Too Divinely Super”, Life, Jan. 27, 1941, p. 78. The books are written as a set of chapters, each a story in itself, and with little connection between them; they were essentially reprints of the magazine stories.Compare, e.g., “A Mighty Man Was He”, in the July 1940 Journal with \\"A Mighty Man Was He\\", Chapter 4 of First Love, Farewell, or “Davy-Galahad”, November 1939, with Chap. 7 of First Love Farewell. Numerous of the stories were adapted for the stage by the Lorimers and others.Kristin Sergel, Maudie and the Opposite Sex: from the Maudie Stories by Graeme and Sarah Lorimer, 1955.E.g., “Men Are Like Streetcars” (sometimes known as “It Couldn’t Happen To a Nicer Girl”) book by Graeme and Sarah Lorimer, stage play by Christopher Sergel; Books *Men Are Like Street Cars (1934); dedicated “to Hunter and his crowd” *Stag Line (1934); dedicated to Hugh MacNair Kahler *Heart Specialist (1935); dedicated to Frank H.

Another review mentioned the stories had \\"gay flavor\\" and \\"spontaneity\\".Kirkus review, Acquittal, Feb. 18, 1937. Kirkus' review of Heart Specialist said its stories \\"are irrespressible, bubbling over with good humor and a keen appreciation of the mirth and the pathos, the drama and the imaginative qualities of the sub deb, 1935 edition. And what an ear for the lingo they have. Ask your young fry what they think of them.\\"Kirkus review, 1935. Maudie’s Diary The books' popularity gave rise to a radio series, Maudie’s Diary. The show, described as a “juvenile comedy”, began August 14, 1941, airing at 7:30 p.m. on Thursdays on CBS. Albert G. Miller wrote the scripts; the show starred Mary Mason as Maudie and Robert Walker as Davy. Betty Garde and Bill Johnstone played Maudie's parents, and Marjorie Davies portrayed her sister, Sylvia. In July 1942, the network replaced the pregnant Mary Mason with Charita Bauer; the program was canceled September 24 of that year. Each episode of the program began, and ended, with Maudie reading an entry from her diary. This opened into, or wound up, each story presented. The story lines revolved around the characters’ difficulties with such adolescent concerns as dates, cars, allowances, homework, annoying siblings, and meddlesome relatives.Jack French, “Maudie’s Diary”, Old Radio Times, December 2007; accessed 2015.10.20.

History The first formal Village was founded in the Beacon Hill neighborhood of Boston in 2001.Jane Gross, \\"A Grass-Roots Effort to Grow Old at Home\\", The New York Times, August 14, 2007; accessed 2013.05.17.Haya El Nasser, 'Villages' let elderly grow old at home, USA Today, July 26, 2010; accessed 2013.05.17. Approximately one dozen residents of the historic neighborhood wanted \\"to remain at home\\" once transportation and household chores became difficult, dangerous, or even impossible. They also wished to avoid becoming dependent on their children, but did not want to move to an old-age facility. They founded an organization to provide these services to the organization's members, who must live in Beacon Hill or the adjacent Back Bay neighborhood.Jane Gross, \\"Aging at Home: For a Lucky Few, a Wish Come True\\" The New York Times, February 9, 2006; accessed 2013.05.17.

The organization grew slowly, learning from its mistakes. After four years in existence, Beacon Hill Village was the subject of an article in The New York Times, and the idea spread. Beacon Hill Village prepared a how-to manual for sale to those who would found other Villages. By 2010, there were more than 50 Villages in the United States.

Villages tend to operate on one of three models. The first, pioneered in the 1990s by Community Without Walls in Princeton, N.J., has numerous members, each of whom belongs to one of a number of \\"houses\\". Annual dues are very low or non-existent, and much of the activity of such a group is social. Nearly all services are provided by volunteers. Members pay additional dues for further assistance and services needed. The second form delivers both volunteer and paid help. Dues are higher (and often subsidized for low-income members), and the level of services (which are typically provided without additional charge) tends to be more comprehensive. This has been termed the \\"classic village model\\". A third model amounts to being a service exchange. One member might pick up groceries for a neighbor; a second volunteer might then fix the first's leaky faucet. Historically, Villages have tended to operate in urban areas, with significant concentrations of both service providers and recipients, but they are spreading.Nell Bernstein, Elder Villages Offer Independence Plus Community, Caring.com; updated Oct. 21, 2008; accessed 2013.05.17. Many experts believe that the second model, with both paid staff and volunteers, has the most widespread applicability. Currently, Villages are largely found in middle- class and upper-income neighborhoods; the movement has received some criticism for its perceived failure to reach more diverse communities to date. The Washington, D.C., area, with its large proportion of people who moved from elsewhere and thus do not have a local family network, has a particularly high concentration of Villages;Tara Bahrampour, \\"Through a growing number of senior villages in the D.C. area, aging in place becomes easier, The Washington Post, Feb. 6, 2014. the District of Columbia Office on Aging has a Web page dedicated to \\"Senior Villages\\" and has produced a \\"how to\\" guide for establishing a new Village.D.C. Office on Aging, \\"Senior Villages\\"; accessed 2015.10.27. The issue of sustainability, with the related issue of growth, has arisen in a number of Villages. In some, the founders have been surprised at the difficulty they experience in their efforts to expand membership beyond the initial group, which can impair efforts to grow the membership to the point at which a Village can become self-sustaining. Many people approached by a Village do not feel ready to join, while the people most in need of a Village's services are less likely to hear about them.Alex Pianin, Cleveland Park gym spotlights senior athletes in photo display\\", The Northwest Current, Feb. 27, 2013, p. 5. Individual Villages may share ideas and experiences through the Village to Village (\\"VtV\\") network. VtV was established in 2010 by Beacon Hill Village and Capital Impact in response to requests from a number of Villages. At the end of 2014, Capital Impact withdrew from the partnership and in March 2015, the organization, formally organized as a limited liability company, was converted to a corporation, named Village to Village Network, Inc.Village to Village Network homepage; accessed 2015.04.20. It serves as a clearinghouse for inter-Village communications, and provides information to help communities establish and operate their own Villages.

The Beacon Hill Village in Boston began as a community of older adults joining forces to create \\"programs and services that will enable them to live at home, remaining independent as long as possible.\\" The ‘Village’ model for aging in place is based on the Beacon Hill Village established in Boston in 2001. The ‘Village’ model is a grassroots, consumer driven, and volunteer first model.McDonough, K. E., & Davitt, J. K. (2011). It takes a village: Community practice, social work, and aging-in-place. Journal of Gerontological Social Work, 54(5), 528-541. The ‘Village’ is a self-governed organization of older adults who have identified their desire to age in place. The model relies on informal network of community members. Volunteers are the backbone of the model, while the ‘Village’ staff is responsible for administration including vetting, training, and management of volunteers. Vendors provide home health care and professional home repairs. Volunteers provide transportation, shopping, household chores, gardening, and light home maintenance. The ‘Village’ model relies on the collective abilities of the community to respond to challenges face in the aging process. The ‘Village’ also works to build a shared sense of community through social activities including potluck dinners, book clubs, and educational programs. , there were over 50 fully operational ‘Villages’ and nearly 149 in the developmental stage.

It was designed by Francis Drummond Greville Stanley and built from 1878 to 1921. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  St Paul's Anglican Church and bell tower, Maryborough, 1891 St Paul's Anglican Church was constructed as the third Maryborough Church of England, replacing a timber church on the same site. The building was designed by prominent Queensland architect, FDG Stanley in 1879. A large memorial hall, designed by local architect, P.O.E. Hawkes, was added to the church site in 1921. The original township of Maryborough was situated, not in its current place, but on the north of the Mary River, after wharves were established in 1847–1848 providing transport for wool from sheep stations on the Burnett River. In 1850 Surveyor, Hugh Roland Labatt arrived in Maryborough with instructions to \\"examine the River Mary...to suggest ...the best site or sites for the laying out of the town, having regard to the convenience of shipping on one hand and internal communication on the other...also...point out the spots desirable as reserves for public building, church, quay and for places for public recreation.\\" The site recommended by Labatt was not where settlement was established but further east and from the early 1850s this is where the growing town developed. The first Maryborough Church of England was constructed at the early settlement in 1852 and this was a timber slab building with shingled roof not exceeding £30 in cost. Much of the material and labour of this early church was provided without cost by the local community and in this year the first pastor, Reverend E. Tanner arrived in Maryborough. In 1853 the Parish of Maryborough was formed as the most northerly outpost of the Diocese of Newcastle. With the movement of the town following Labatt's survey, the timber church was dismantled and re-erected on land in Lennox Street which has been variously described as being donated to the church by early Maryborough citizen, ET Aldridge or as being secured for £21 by the church in early land sales in Maryborough. The Church of England retains this land as their principal Maryborough property to this day. Upon re-erection of the first timber church, a timber belfry complete with bells were added to the site. This newly erected church remained in use for ten years, until it was replaced with another timber church dedicated as St Paul's Episcopal church on 27 May 1866. This church was designed by Maryborough architect, William Montgomerie Davenport Davidson, who as a church warden provided his services without charge. Maryborough flourished in the late 1860s as a result of the discovery of gold in Gympie in 1867, for which Maryborough was the port. The trade of supplying the gold field went through Maryborough leading to the establishment of several secondary industries and a consequent growth in the population. During the 1870s immigration schemes and the introduction of indentured labour caused more population increases in Maryborough. By 1877 a decision was made by the parish to construct a new permanent masonry building and the foundations tone of this new structure was laid by Sir Arthur Kennedy in March 1878. The services of Colonial Architect, Francis Drummond Greville Stanley were sought and he furnished the church with a design. Although Stanley was employed by the Queensland Government as the Queensland Colonial Architect, effectively from 1871 until 1881, he was allowed to continue with private commissions but this remained a contentious point throughout his employment as other architects complained. In October 1877, Stanley submitted a resignation to the government detailing how he needed to supplement his income with private work which was causing him health problems. When granted a salary increase he withdrew his resignation but argued that he was committed to the work at St Paul's, Maryborough which he then brought to completion. Stanley resigned officially and vacated his position in July 1881. The design Stanley provided to the Church of England for their church in Maryborough was very similar to his design for the Holy Trinity Church of England in Fortitude Valley. Both churches are constructed of brick on a masonry foundation and have a similar traditional church floorplan of central nave flanked by aisles with apsidal chancel and porch entrance. The clerestory in both buildings is supported on a cast iron pointed arched arcade extending for the length of the nave, with cedar panels set in the spandrels of the arches. St Paul's Church of England was opened on 30 August 1879 by the bishop of Brisbane, Matthew Hale, and the bishop of North Queensland, George Stanton. The building was constructed at a cost of about £6000, and a report in the local newspaper described the completed building as Queensland's cathedral in reference to its size, architecture and prominence, thought to be greater than other Churches of England built in Queensland to that date. The report continues on to detail some of the internal decoration: > \\"The chancel has a neatly framed roof with quarter diagonals decorated with > rosettes in alternating spaces ... The lower windows in the sides, with the > western ad wheel windows are of the new diamond glass - one whole sheet each > with false diamonds and with the stained glass windows of the chancel were > imported expressly for the church. The upper windows in lead frames were > made in Maryborough. By night the church is lit by means of rose lights > containing 12 jets one of which stands in every arch.\\" The church was constructed by local contractors: Mr Caldwell who was responsible for the masonry work and Mr Taylor, responsible for carpentering. The report does state that the building is similar to the Holy Trinity Church but calls St Paul's \\"a vast improvement being very much larger and less costly\\". By 1883 an organ gallery was added to the north western end, also designed by FDG Stanley. The next substantial addition to the church was in 1887 when a large free-standing bell tower was erected near the church. The structure, with nine bells cast by Mears White Chapel Bell Founders of London, cost £3500, which was donated by ET Aldridge, at whose suggestion the tower was constructed in memory of his wife, Maria. According to the National Trust of Queensland, the bell tower is believed to house the only full peal of bells in Queensland. Another large addition was made to the site in 1921 when a memorial Hall designed by local architect, POE Hawkes was constructed. The hall was dedicated to the \\"glory of God and the memory of those who fell in the Great War\\". The foundation stone was laid on 3 August 1920 to coincide with a visit to Maryborough by the Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII). The building, which was designed to harmonise with the church, housed a hall with a stage, two dressing rooms and two vestries along with two wide verandahs which would serve to provide supper rooms and open-air classrooms. The hall was constructed by local contractor WE Ferguson at a cost of £5980. POE Hawkes was an innovative local architect responsible for many fine inter-war buildings in Maryborough, including residences and commercial buildings. Within the church a Warrior's Chapel was dedicated on 3 July 1960 and Our Lady's Chapel was dedicated on 17 March 1963. Both the church and the hall remain substantially intact.  Description  Church, 1995 St Paul's Anglican Church and Hall are prominently located on the corner of Lennox, Ellena and Adelaide Streets in Maryborough. The site comprises three principal elements, the church, facing north west to Lennox Street, the hall, aligned with the church along Ellena Street but facing south east to Adelaide Street, and a large detached tower in the western corner, adjacent to the Lennox and Ellena Streets corner. St Paul's Church is a large nineteenth-century Gothic revival building constructed of face brick with polychrome brick and stuccoed detailing. The building has a traditional cruciform plan, with nave flanked by aisles running parallel to Ellena Street, shallow transepts bisecting the nave and an apsidal chancel at the south eastern end. The modern Zincalume-like clad roof is steeply pitched over the nave, with gabled projections over the transepts and hipped over the chancels. The side aisles of the church are skillion roofed and abut the nave below the trefoiled clerestory window openings. The principal facade of the church has a centrally located shallow porched entrance, formed by a steeply pitched gable, within which is a heavily moulded pointed arched doorway. Flanking the doorway, at ground floor level are thin lancets detailed like all of the other openings on the church, with contrasting brick quoining and a stuccoed head and sill. The nave of the church is framed on this elevation by attached buttressing which projects above the roofline and terminates in pinnacles decorated with crockets. On the face of the side aisles, flanking this central bay of the church, are traceried window openings, comprising two trefoiled lancets and quatrefoils above. Over the central entrance of this facade is a large traceried window comprising four lancets and three foiled windows above. Surmounting the apex of the gable on this elevation is a stone finial-like element which comprises a circular disc with a quatrefoil cutout. Internally, the church is divided into nave and aisles by a nave arcade of pointed arched openings supported on clustered cast iron columns. In the spandrels of the arched openings are timber panels with foiled cutouts. Arched braced timber roof trusses support the roof and these also feature timber panels with foiled cutouts. Entrances from the transepts are concealed with timber panelled boxes around the doors. Above these boxes are large wheel windows, glazed with coloured glass. Lining the side aisles are lancets generally glazed with stained glass panels. The chancel is divided from the nave by a pointed arch chancel screen. Within the chancel which has a semi-domed timber-framed ceiling, are four panels of early stained glass. The tower, adjacent to the church, is a three-storeyed battlemented structure which is missing a spire. Attached buttressing strengthens the corners of the structure, which has string coursing defining the floor levels. The many lancet openings, in a group of three on the first floor and paired on the floor above, are all surrounded with stuccoed detailing. The tower is surmounted by a battlemented parapet above a moulded cornice which projects from the line of the building. St Paul's Hall is a substantial brick building, of similar proportion and massing to the church, housing a central auditorium with a steeply pitched gabled roof, clad with terracotta tiles. The hall is flanked by side aisles and the building has transept elements at the north western end and apsidal chapels flanking the principal, south eastern, facade. The building is constructed of brick with stuccoed detailing. The principal facade features a central projecting porch to which entrance is through the two return sides. The porch is surmounted by a wide band of rough cast stuccoed panelling, with a central pediment, acting as a parapet. This facade has bands of stucco, and is divided into bays by buttressing terminating in pinnacles above the roof line. The side elevations of the building, are lined with semi-open verandahs, above which on the face of the body of the hall are large arched clerestory window openings. Penetrating the roof are small hipped roof ventilators. Light modern extensions have been made to the south eastern end of the hall.  Heritage listing  St Paul's Anglican Church and Hall was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. St Paul's Anglican Church, constructed as the third Church of England in Maryborough demonstrates the growth of the town during the nineteenth century. The size and quality of design of the building are evidence of the prominence of Maryborough as a port and centre for the Burnett region in the nineteenth century. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The hall is an unusual example of a memorial hall built as part of a church complex. The bell tower houses a rare example of a full peal of bells in Queensland. The church and hall have considerable architectural and aesthetic merit as well composed prominent Maryborough buildings. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The church is characteristic of a substantial nineteenth-century Gothic revival ecclesiastical building.

Flammarion, 1901. A Marinoni press from 1883; at the Musée des Arts et Métiers Hippolyte Auguste Marinoni (1823, Paris – 7 January 1904, Paris) was a builder of rotary printing presses; most of which used the rotogravure process. He was also a media patron and owned several periodicals; notably Le Petit Journal. His is considered to be one of the first to apply modern printing technology to mass-produced publications.  Biography  His father was originally from Brescia and had served as a dragoon in the Napoleonic armies. At the time of his birth, his father was serving as a brigadier in the National Gendarmerie of Paris, and he was born in the barracks of at the Barrière d’Enfer. After his father's death in 1830, he was apprenticed to a turner mechanic. In 1837, aged only fourteen, he received a patent on a device for husking rice and cottonseeds. The following year, he found employment at the firm of Pierre-Alexandre Gaveaux (1782–1844); a manufacturer of printing equipment. In 1847, he built his first press with two cylinders, dubbed \\"The Jet\\", which was able to print 1,500 sheets per hour. In 1850, he worked with Jacob Worms, a German immigrant who was experimenting with ways to improve the rotary printing process at the offices of La Presse. Shortly after, Worms moved to New York and, although he received several patents, his improvements never saw widespread commercial application.Excerpt from White Magic: The Age of Paper by Lothar Müller, Wiley & Sons, 2015 @ Google Books Marinoni built on Worms' work, however and, in 1866, filed for patents on a duplex press (one that prints on both sides) with a six-cylinder feeder known as the \\"presse rotative à plieuse\\" (rotary press folding machine). In 1872, he installed his new press at La Liberté, a short-lived journal published by Émile de Girardin, then installed five of them at Le Petit Journal. A year later, the Millaud family put its interests in the paper up for sale. It was acquired by a group of investors headed by Girardin and Marinoni. In 1882, Marinoni took sole control of the Journal. He introduced a Sunday supplement in 1889 that was one of the first to have illustrations in color. With sensational stories on crimes, accidents and gossip, it was also one of the world's first tabloids. \\"Presses Marinoni\\" became one of the principal suppliers of offset presses in France. In 1921, it merged with the Voirin company of Montataire, founded by Henri Voirin (1827–1887), a press- builder for the firm of Rousselet-Normand.\\"Fonds Marinoni – Voirin (Heidelberg) – historique\\" @ Musée de l'Imprimerie of Lyon.

It was built in 1869. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The shop at 134 Wharf Street was built in 1869 as one of three shops in the midst of the wharf precinct of the Port of Maryborough. Settlement at Maryborough commenced in September 1847 when George Furber established a woolstore on the south bank of the Mary River at the head of navigation. He was followed in June 1848 by ET Aldridge and Henry and RE Palmer, who established their own wharves on the opposite riverbank, at a location now known as the original Maryborough town site at Baddow. In 1850 a new town site was surveyed to the east, at a downstream position which provided better access for shipping. The first sale of land at this new site occurred in 1852, but most residents did not shift to the current centre of Maryborough until 1855 and 1856. Maryborough was gazetted a Port of Entry in 1859 and was proclaimed a municipality (the Borough of Maryborough) in 1861. During the 1860s and 1870s it flourished as the principal port for the nearby Gympie goldfield and as an outlet for timber and sugar. The establishment of manufacturing plants and primary industries sustained growth in the town into the twentieth century. The small building was originally one of three identical shops with shingle roofs adjoining one another in a row fronting Wharf Street. The other two were located on its eastern side where a small office building is presently located. It is not known whether remnants of the former shops exist under the facade of this building. The shop at 134 Wharf Street has always been used for small business purposes and has changed hands many times. It continues to operate as a retail store.  Description  The building at 134 Wharf Street is a simple one-storeyed, rendered brick building with a steeply pitched hipped roof clad with corrugated metal sheeting. A small awning at the front of the building is incorporated into the principal roof and is supported on timber brackets. According to the reports of local people there is a shingle roof extant underneath the corrugated iron.

He and his colleagues researched the problem with files and digital photos and were able to develop a solution. Memon developed an automated software program that can retrieve and reassemble fragmented digital photographs, even when the directions for locating them have been deleted. His software is an example of file carving, which is the restoring of file contents after identifying information has been removed or lost. In 2006, Memon and two of his students, Pasha Pal and Kulesh Shanmugasundaram founded Digital Assembly, which sells a consumer version of the software, Adroit Photo Recovery, to restore deleted images. Digital Assembly has competed and won the NSF Phase I and Phase II SBIRs as well as an NYSTAR TTIP grant. Digital Assembly’s software was featured in an ABC news article regarding the use of technology in the fight against child pornography in 2010.  Biometrics and human behavior  In 2011, Memon led a project to develop gesture based alternatives to passwords on touch screen devices. The project demonstrated that the owners of a device can be authenticated by the unique touch of their fingers to either supplement or remove the need for a password He created iSignOn, an app sold in Apple’s App Store that uses the motion of a person’s actual written signature to authenticate him or her. The app is able to distinguish the user’s pattern from forgers after the user signs the screen with their finger five times.  Network security and steganography  In 2005, Memon was featured in the NBC investigative report on terror alerts raised due to bogus analysis. He discussed the art of secret writing called steganography, which allows two parties to communicate with each other without others knowing they are communicating, and how steganalysis software can be used to locate those hidden messages, but it is not always reliable. In 2009, Memon developed INFER,a network-based infection detection system to identify compromised host computers on large networks primarily for corporate and government systems. This program focuses on detecting systems inside the network infected by malware rather than detection or prevention at the point of entry. INFER was used to track the behavior of 3,000 PCs on The Polytechnic Institute of NYU network. Memon and his students started a company called Vivic to commercialize INFER, which resulted in the U.S. Army Research Laboratory becoming their first paying customer. INFER also has Westchester County, New York government, and the New York City IT Department as customers.  Lossless compression  In 1995, Memon co-developed the novel context based lossless compression scheme named CALIC with Xialoin Wu. CALIC ranked first in the evaluations conducted by the International Standards Organization (ISO) of the techniques submitted in response to its call for a new lossless image compression standard. The final ISO standard, JPEG-LS, was significantly influenced by the concepts utilized in CALIC.  Other activities  Memon created the Information Systems and Internet Security lab, a hackerspace for students to work both on cyber offense and defense. He is the editor-in-chief of the IEEE Transactions on Information Security and Forensics. Memon has also been an associate editor for IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, the Journal of Electronic Imaging, the ACM Multimedia Systems Journal, the LNCS Transaction on Data Hiding, IEEE Security and Privacy Magazine, IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, and the International Journal on Network Security.  Recognition  Memon has received several awards for his research and lectureship. In 2002, he received the Jacobs Excellence in Education Award from Polytechnic University. In 2010, he became an IEEE Fellow and received the IEEE Signal Processing Society Distinguished Lecturer award for 2011-2012. Memon became a SPIE Fellow in 2014 and was awarded Best Research in Advanced ID Systems: Online Authentication of Digital Signature through Mobile Phones in 2014. He has won best paper awards from IEEE and the Digital Forensics Research Conference. Memon was recognized for his research with the NSF CAREER Award and the Emirates ID Best Research in Advanced ID Systems.  Bibliography  *Sencar, H., & Memon, N. (2013).

The platform has more than 300 thousand active users across the United States. The company is headquartered in Montreal, Quebec and has operations across North America.  History  Originally named GradeSlam, Paper was founded in 2014 by McGill University graduates Philip Cutler and Roberto Cipriani. Cutler, a former teacher and tutor, recognized that many of his students were seeking additional support through tutors or homework help programs. These services were reserved for the wealthiest of families, with hardly any options available for the general student population. He felt that education should be focused on access and equality, so he left teaching to start the company with a mission to deliver true educational equity and level the playing field for all students. In August 2016, the company announced that it raised $1.6 million from venture capitalists in August 2016. Over the following years, their product offering evolved beyond tutoring to include a comprehensive suite of tools to support both students and teachers. The conversational nature of Paper's platform is designed for ease of use to ensure the widest net of accessibility for students. Google's AI Assistant fund led an investment into the company in 2019. The company officially announced a rebrand from GradeSlam to Paper in March 2020. At the same time they announced a $7.5 million dollar financing that was backed by investors including Reach Capital, Bullpen Capital, Birchmere Ventures, Google and others. Paper is credited with the creation of the Educational Support System category.  Software and product  Paper provides a comprehensive Educational Support System. The ESS consists of a number of student, teacher and administrator tools. They are best known for the online tutoring that provides 24/7 live help and essay review. For students, Paper provides schools with the ability to offer students with chat-based access to tutors. Tutors working for Paper are regarded as an extension of each school’s individual teaching staff. Teachers are granted access to see their student's tutoring interactions. Teachers also receive insights to help inform their teaching and have a pulse on their class' assessments. In March 2020, Paper launched an education industry focused blog. The Paper blog includes educator spotlights, industry interviews, and series about coping with school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Educational impact  Paper has conducted a number of efficacy studies to identify the educational impact of their ESS. A study conducted with 5th grade students saw students using Paper experience 30% more growth in English language development than peers without access to the ESS. During the extended school closures caused by COVID-19, Paper was heavily depended upon by schools looking to provide remote teaching and learning for students. The company reported record months of student engagement in March 2020 and April 2020 as a result of distance learning initiatives.  Media reception  Paper has been featured on Breakfast Television and The National (CBC) as an innovative and cost effective way for students to get ahead in school. Paper’s online tutoring component has also been written about in La Presse, Tech Crunch. Les Affaires, TechVibes and EdTech Review. In September 2015, the company was selected by Tourism Montreal as one of the Top 10 Startups In Montreal. In July 2017, GradeSlam was selected by MindShare Learning as one of the Top Ten News Stories Of The Summer Paper is the winner of many awards including the 2020 EdTech Award for Best Tutoring Solution.

Luna, 577 U.S. ___ (2015), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that a police officer who shot a suspect during a police pursuit was entitled to qualified immunity., slip op. at 12 (2015) (per curiam). In a per curiam opinion, the Court held that prior precedent did not establish \\"beyond debate\\" that the officer's actions were objectively unreasonable.Mullenix, slip op. at 9 (per curiam) (citing Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, . Background=Pursuit and death of Israel Leija, Jr. On March 23, 2010, officers in the Tulia, Texas Police Department engaged Israel Leija, Jr. in a high-speed pursuit where Leija's vehicle reached speeds between 85 and 110 miles per hour.Mullenix, slip op. at 1 (per curiam). During the pursuit, Leija made two telephone calls to the Tulia, Texas police dispatcher stating that he had a gun and that he would shoot officers if they did not abandon the pursuit. The dispatcher relayed these calls to pursuing officers, as well as an additional report that Leija may have been intoxicated. Texas Department of Public Safety trooper Chadrin Mullenix responded to the pursuit and positioned himself on an overpass above the freeway on which Leija was traveling.Mullenix, slip op. at 2 (per curiam). In an attempt to disable Leija's vehicle, Mullenix fired six shots in the direction of Leija's vehicle. Four of those shots struck and killed Leija.Mullenix, slip op. at 2-3 (per curiam). Trial and appeal to Fifth Circuit Leija's family sued Mullenix under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming that Mullenix conducted an unconstitutional seizure by using excessive force against Leija.Mullenix, slip op. at 3 (per curiam). Mullenix filed a motion for summary judgment in which he argued that he was entitled to qualified immunity. The district court denied Mullenix's motion, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling.Mullenix, slip op. at 3 (per curiam) (citing Luna v. Mullenix, 765 F.3d 531 (2014)). The Fifth Circuit held that the \\"immediacy of the risk posed by Leija is a disputed fact that a reasonable jury could find either in the plaintiffs’ favor or in the officer’s favor, precluding us from concluding that Mullenix acted objectively reasonably as a matter of law\\".Mullenix, slip op. at 3 (per curiam) (citing Luna v. Mullenix, 765 F.3d at 538). Mullenix then petitioned the Fifth Circuit for rehearing en banc, but the court reaffirmed the denial of qualified immunity.Mullenix, slip op. at 4 (per curiam) (citing Luna v. Mullenix, 777 F.3d 221 (2014)). The Fifth Circuit concluded that \\"the law was clearly established such that a reasonable officer would have known that the use of deadly force, absent a sufficiently substantial and immediate threat, violated the Fourth Amendment\\".Mullenix, slip op. at 4 (per curiam) (citing Luna v. Mullenix, 773 F.3d 712, 725 (2014)). Opinion of the Court On November 9, 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States issued a per curiam opinion that addressed only the qualified immunity question; the Court did not address whether Mullenix's actions violated the Fourth Amendment.Mullenix, slip op. at 4 (per curiam). The Court began its analysis by noting that police officers are entitled to qualified immunity in suits filed under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 as long as the officer's conduct does not violate \\"clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known\\".Mullenix, slip op. at 4 (per curiam) (citing Pearson v. Callahan, ). The Court explained that there need not be \\"a case directly on point, but existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate\\".Mullenix, slip op. at 5 (per curiam) (citing Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, . Applying these principles to the facts of this case, the Court held that prior precedent did not establish \\"beyond debate\\" that Mullenix's actions were objectively unreasonable.Mullenix, slip op. at 9 (per curiam). Consequently, the Court reversed the Fifth Circuit's determination that Mullenix was not entitled to qualified immunity.Mullenix, slip op. at 12 (per curiam). Concurring and dissenting opinions Justice Antonin Scalia wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment; he argued that Mullenix did not actually apply deadly force in this case.Mullenix, slip op. at 1 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). Because Mullenix intended only to stop Leija's car by destroying its engine, the gunshots were not \\"deadly force\\" because they were not \\"applied with the object of harming the body of the felon\\".Mullenix, slip op. at 1-2 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). Justice Scalia claimed, \\"It does not assist analysis to refer to all use of force that happens to kill the arrestee as the application of deadly force\\". Additionally, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissenting opinion in which she argued that Mullenix was not entitled to qualified immunity because \\"it was clearly established under the Fourth Amendment that an officer in Mullenix’s position should not have fired the shots\\".Mullenix, slip op. at 1 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). She argued, \\"It is clearly established that there must be some governmental interest that necessitates deadly force\\" and that in this case, \\"neither petitioner nor the majority can point to any possible marginal gain in shooting at the car over\\" other nonlethal alternatives.Mullenix, slip op. at 4-5 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). She wrote, \\"[b]y sanctioning a 'shoot first, think later' approach to policing, the Court renders the protections of the Fourth Amendment hollow\\".Mullenix, slip op. at 7 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting).

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. The house was included as a contributing property in the West Hill Historic District in 2008. History A native of Massachusetts, Pliny Fay was one of the first settlers in the town of Bloomington, later renamed Muscatine. He joined his brother Edward here in 1837, a year after the town was surveyed and platted. The brothers were involved in the economic, political, and social life of the new town. They opened the second pharmacy in town and operated it together until Edward died in 1848. Pliny took on Frederick H. Stone as a partner, and they remained in business for at least another ten years. Adelia St. John was another New Englander who settled in Bloomington in its early years. She was the sister of William and Hamilton St. John, who were early land speculators in the area. She and Pliny were married in 1840. The Fays become prosperous enough to buy this property on the bluff overlooking the Mississippi River in 1853. According to property tax records, the house was built the following year. Its architect and builder are unknown. The house had to be moved from its original location sometime between 1866 and 1874 because of severe erosion along the bluff. Pliny and Adelia lived here with their two daughters and one son. The two daughters were married in 1867. Pliny's mother lived with them until her death in 1871. The Fay's sold the house in 1872 or 1873 and relocated to Santa Cruz, California for health reasons. Architecture The Italianate style is found in the porch, vestibule, round- headed window on the main facade, and the bracketed eaves of the house. It also has a low pitched roof, Palladian window, and symmetrical interior chimneys that are more typical of the Georgian style. This combination of styles is an example of the fluidity and variety of the architecture found in Iowa's river towns. The inclusion of the Georgian style reflects the continuity between the frontier areas and the established settlements of New England from which the early settlers came.

It was founded in 2004 by a merger of the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights and the Court of Justice of the African Union. It is the primary judicial agency of the African Union.protocol on the statute of the african court of justice and Human Rights , Art 2. The court is based in the city of Arusha, Tanzania, as is the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and as was its predecessor the Court of Justice of the African Union. The court has two chambers, one for general legal matters and one for rulings on the human rights treaties. Within this the court has both an advisory opinion role and adjudicative role. The court is competent to interpret its own judgments in an appellate chamber.  History  The African Court of Justice and Human Rights is an international court based in Arusha, Tanzania. A merging of the African Court on Human and People's Rights and the Court of Justice of the African Union was proposed by the chairperson of the Assembly of the African Union and the head of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, President Olusegun Obasanjo, in 2004. This idea of uniting the two courts was raised because of the African Union's insufficient funds. In January 2005, a panel of legal experts assembled in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia to formulate a draft protocol that honored the integrity of the two independent courts, yet established a way to regulate the decorum of the now merged court. Afterwards, a panel met in Nigeria to propose a draft protocol to the Executive Council of the African Union. In March 2005, the draft was approved and was passed to legal experts for their recommendations. The recommendations were presented at the African Union Summit in Sirte, Libya. It was decided that operations should begin, and the headquarters would be in the East region of Africa by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government.  Functions of the New Court  The African Court of Justice and Human Rights ultimately reviews cases of war crimes, trafficking people and/or drugs, genocide, crimes against humanity, terrorism, and piracy. The Court is essentially divided into two different sections: the Human Rights section and the General affairs section. The judges are split up evenly between the two. If there is a case pending from the previous African Court of Human and People's Rights, they will proceed to the Human Rights section of the court and the justice cases from Court of Justice of the African Union will go to the General Affairs section. Because the uniting of the African Court on Human and People's Rights and the Court of Justice of the African Union occurred in the middle of the quinquennial election times, previous judges of the two courts were sworn into office until new officers could be elected and sworn in. The court consists of sixteen judges, all of which are from different Member States. Even though the judges of the African Court of Justice and Human Rights are expected to uphold high morality, they are granted full immunity from international laws, throughout and after office.

Williams, a Native American woodcarver, was shot four times by Officer Ian Birk of the Seattle Police Department. Williams died at the scene. The shooting was ruled \\"unjustified\\" by the police department's Firearms Review Board. The department's actions were scrutinized by the United States Department of Justice as a result of the incident. Biography John T. Williams was born in 1960. He was a member of the Nuu-chah-nulth tribe, and during his childhood, lived in Seattle, and Victoria and Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada. According to Williams' family, he was a seventh-generation woodcarver. Williams was an extremely talented artist. Williams had hearing difficulties, and had battled problems with alcohol much of his adult life. He had spent time at the mental institution Western State Hospital. Shooting At about 4:15 p.m. on August 30, 2010, Birk was driving his patrol car and saw Williams near Boren Avenue and Howell Street. The dashboard camera of Birk's patrol car showed Williams walk \\"through the crosswalk, hunched over (with) something in his hands, then disappear(ing) offscreen\\". Birk emerged from his patrol car with his pistol drawn. Birk yelled, \\"Hey\\", \\"Hey… Hey!\\", \\"Put the knife down\\", \\"Put the knife down. Put the knife down!\\" Less than 5 seconds after the first \\"Hey\\", the sound of gunshots was recorded on the camera. Williams had been holding a \\"scrap of wood\\" and \\"a single-blade pocketknife\\". Officers who arrived on the scene after the shooting and nearby witnesses later observed that the knife Williams was carrying was closed. Investigation Birk stated to the Firearms Review Board that Williams appeared to be impaired, and that he had an open knife in his hand. Birk also stated that when Williams began to turn toward Birk that Williams was \\"brandishing\\" the knife in a \\"very confrontational posture\\" and that Williams did not obey Birk's orders to drop the knife. Birk stated that he was mindful of the fact that Williams was approximately away from him and might attack before Birk had the opportunity to react, and at that point Birk made the decision to fire. The report of the Firearms Review Board concluded that Birk acted appropriately in contacting Williams, but that the decision to use deadly force was unjustified. The Firearms Review Board found a number of problems in Birk's actions and his subsequent testimony. The FRB found that when Birk first made the decision to contact Williams that Birk was in the safety of his patrol car and that his radio communication to police dispatchers indicated that he was conducting a routine stop of a suspicious person, but the correct action would have been for Birk to indicate explicitly to dispatchers that he \\"observed a man with a knife\\", to request backup, and to wait for backup to arrive before initiating contact. The FRB also found that Birk's decision to exit his vehicle with his firearm drawn were inconsistent with a routine assessment of a suspicious circumstance; that Birk failed to adequately identify himself as a police officer in his verbal commands to Williams; that there were inconsistencies in Birk's testimony; that whether or not the knife was open was the subject of debate but the FRB based its findings with the belief that Birk was correct in stating that the knife was open when he confronted Williams; that Birk made the decision to move to approximately within 10 feet of Williams and that this close distance is insufficient to establish a justification for the use of deadly force; that based on Williams' posture \\"Officer Birk's decision to use deadly force was premature\\", and the unanimous conclusion that Birk's discharge of his firearm was \\"unjustified and outside of policy, tactics and training\\". Aftermath Birk resigned from the Seattle Police Department on February 16, 2011, one day after King County prosecutor Dan Satterberg decided not to press criminal charges against him. Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn declared February 27, 2011 to be \\"John T. Williams Day\\" in the city. In August 2011, the City of Seattle paid Williams' family a settlement of $1.5 million. A high totem pole honoring Williams was erected at the Seattle Center on February 26, 2012. In 2016, a crosswalk painted in the style of a white deer was unveiled at Boren Avenue and Howell Street, where Williams was shot, and dedicated to him.

Life Born into an old Breton family, in 1757 he joined the naval administration as part of the comte de Moras's ministry. Commissioner to Le Havre and Martinique, he was made naval controller at Rochefort in 1777 by Louis XVI on the suggestion of M. de Sartine. During the maréchal de Castries's ministry, he was made commissioner general and intendant of the port of Brest in 1784, a post he retained until the French Revolution. Suspected of being a royalist, he was persecuted during the Reign of Terror, deprived of his property in 1791, arrested and imprisoned at Brest then Carhaix (1793 to end of 1794). He was only freed after 9 thermidor. After the Constitution de l'an III was adopted, he was a member of the executory committee for the navy and the colonies (6 July 1795 - 5 November 1796). In 1797 he became a candidate for the moderate faction in the French Directory. An experienced administrator who favoured the 18 brumaire, he was made a counsellor of state attached to the naval section, then president of the 'conseil des prises' on 4 April 1800. There he defended the course system as conforming to the French spirit of adventure. On 20 July 1800 he became maritime prefect of Lorient and on 25 prairial year 12 he was made a member of the Légion d'honneur, rising to commander in the order on 14 June 1804. In 1805 he joined the counsel of state. In April 1808 he was made a count of the empire and on 5 February 1810 a member of the Sénat conservateur. He did not attend the 1 April 1814 sitting and thus did not sign the senate's address to the French people to absolve them of their loyalty oath to Napoleon I, but he voted for Napoleon's deposition the following day. On 4 June 1814 he was made a peer of France by Louis XVIII. He died only a few weeks before Napoleon's escape from Elba.

Operating from 1942 to 1944, it was closely associated with singer Frank Sinatra, who made his solo nightclub debut there in 1943.  Location  The club was located on East 57th Street near Third Avenue in Manhattan.  History  The Riobamba was owned by American Mafia boss Louis \\"Lepke\\" Buchalter. While Buchalter was awaiting execution on death row, his wife ran the club. From 1942 to 1944 the club was managed by Linton D. Weil and Arthur Jawitz. There was a claim that the Duke of York owned the real estate where the club was located. Patterned after the larger Copacabana, the Riobamba was a \\"glitzy jewel box of a joint\\" with a small dance floor on which stood a baby grand piano. There was no stage; the performers stood near the tables at which patrons sat. The room seated 400. Shows typically featured a stand-up comedian, a dance troupe, and an orchestra in addition to the main act. At the beginning of the set, a line of chorus girls came out singing a song called \\"Riobamba\\", which had been written by Leonard Bernstein and which the club had purchased for $50; Bernstein recycled the musical trope in his 1944 ballet \\"Fancy Free\\". Floor shows were held at 8:30 pm, 12 am, and 2 am, while dance troupes and relief bands performed at other times.  Acts  Among the acts that performed at the Riobamba were singer Jane Froman, vaudeville performer Grace Hayes, singer-actress Hannah Williams, and the Chandra-Kaly Dancers. Dean Martin appeared as a last-minute substitute for Frank Sinatra in September 1943.  Frank Sinatra debut  Frank Sinatra Riobamba postcard, 1943 In 1943 Frank Sinatra's managers tried, unsuccessfully, to book him into the Copacabana, which was then \\"the hottest of the hot\\" of Manhattan's nightclubs. They settled for a three-week engagement at the Riobamba, which was experiencing serious financial trouble. Sinatra was offered $750 a week. The singer did not receive top billing; he was advertised as an \\"extra added attraction\\" under monologist Walter O'Keefe, singer-comedian Sheila Barrett, a dance troupe, and a choir. Though Sinatra was unnerved by the small size of the performance area and was gripped with stage fright, he leaned against the piano and began singing. According to columnist Earl Wilson, who was present, \\"Frank was in a dinner jacket and he was wearing a wedding band. He had a small curl that fell almost over his right eye. With trembling lips – I don't know how he made them tremble, but I saw it – he sang 'She's Funny That Way' and 'Night and Day' and succeeded in bringing down the house\\". Before the week was out, Sinatra was attracting standing-room-only audiences even for his 2:30 am show, and Barrett had been demoted to second-billing under Sinatra and had quit. When O'Keefe announced that he was quitting, too, he told his last audience, \\"When I came to this place, I was the star and a kid named Sinatra, one of the acts. Then suddenly a steamroller came along and knocked me flat. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the rightful star – Frank Sinatra\\". The club increased Sinatra's pay to $1,000 and then $1,500, and he performed for a total of ten weeks, becoming \\"one of the biggest draws in any New York club\\". The gig served to prove Sinatra's appeal to more mature audiences than his \\"bobby soxer\\" fan base, while autograph seekers thronged outside on the sidewalk. In the wake of Sinatra's success, other clubs rushed to hire \\"crooners\\". La Martinique hired Argentine vocalist Dick Haymes, jumpstarting his career. In August 1943 the Riobamba ranked in the top three clubs in New York in Billboard fifth annual poll; the others were the Stork Club and the Latin Quarter.  Closure  In spring 1944 the Riobamba was shut down by the Federal government for nonpayment of taxes, including the amusement tax, alcohol tax, withholding tax, and Social Security tax, amounting to a back claim of $24,000. The club was also reportedly delinquent in paying musicians and performers, as well as on its mortgage. In September 1944 it was announced that the club would reopen under the lease of Harold Jacobs and Julius Yablok; in December 1944, Café Society nightclub owner Barney Josephson was said to be interested in assuming the lease. In March 1945, theatrical producer George H. Kondolf and a group of other interested parties purchased the Riobamba, but the club was not immediately opened due to a curfew issue. By 1946, the Riobamba had been replaced by the Embassy Club. The year after Louis Buchalter was executed, his widow Betty married the former manager of the club, Arthur Jarwood, also known as Arthur Jawitz.

The station was originally known as 1XH which was the stations original callsign. 1XH was started by Radio New Zealand (which at the time was known as the National Broadcasting Service) in 1949, broadcasting on 1310 AM. In 1968 the station callsign was changed to 1ZH and the station known on air as this name. In 1978 after AM band in New Zealand was changed from 10 kHz spacing to 9 kHz spacing, as a result 1ZH was moved to 1296AM. On air names included 1300 1ZH and Hits and Memories 1ZH during the 1980s. On 25 May 1990 1ZH switched to FM broadcasting on 98.6FM at this time the station became known as ZHFM. A television advertisement for the switch to FM used the song Time Warp from The Rocky Horror Show with the line \\"Let's switch ZHFM\\" instead of \\"Let's do the Time Warp again.\\" A similar advertisement was used for 4ZB Dunedin when this station switched to FM in September 1990, with the line \\"Let's switch ZBFM.\\" The 98.6 ZHFM frequency can also be heard in Tauranga, the outskirts of Auckland and in a number of places in Northland due to its high power and the high elevation of its transmission site. In 1993 Radio New Zealand rebranded many of their heritage stations as Classic Hits. For ZHFM the station became known as Classic Hits ZHFM. At the same time Radio New Zealand began rolling out Newstalk ZB across the country. The original 1296AM frequency was replaced with Newstalk ZB. In July 1996 the New Zealand Government sold off the commercial arm of Radio New Zealand, which included, among other things, the Classic Hits branded stations. The new owner was The Radio Network, a subsidiary of APN News & Media and Clear Channel Communications, which operated as a division of the Australian Radio Network. The original studios were located in Broadcasting House in Alma Street, the basement of this building also housed The Rock 93FM when this station launched in Hamilton in 1991. In 1996 Classic Hits ZHFM moved to its current location on Hardley street. In 1998 Classic Hits ZHFM was reduced to just 4 hours of local programming between 6 and 10 am 7 days a week. Outside this time nationwide shows based from Auckland took over, and the network announcers simply called the station Classic Hits. The breakfast show was shortened to a 3-hour show in 2012 on all Classic Hits. On April 28, 2014 all stations part of the Classic Hits network were rebranded as The Hits. A networked breakfast presented by Pauline Gillespie and Grant Kareama was introduced to almost all The Hits stations, with the former breakfast announcer moved to present a 6-hour show between 9am and 3pm. Waikato originally kept its local breakfast presented by Mark Bunting. However, just prior to the rebranding Bunting had tendered his resignation with The Radio Network and accepted a position on rival station The Breeze Waikato. A week after rebranding Mark Bunting left the station and Sunday night network announcer Blair Dowling became the new Waikato local announcer. However, he presented the daytime 9am – 3pm show instead and Waikato began taking the network breakfast.

Both non-rechargeable primary cell and rechargeable secondary cell chemistries have been investigated. Magnesium primary cell batteries have been commercialised and have found use as reserve and general use batteries. Magnesium secondary cell batteries are an active topic of research, specifically as a possible replacement or improvement over lithium- ion–based battery chemistries in certain applications. A significant advantage of magnesium cells is their use of a solid magnesium anode, allowing a higher energy density cell design than that made with lithium, which in many instances requires an intercalated lithium anode. Insertion type anodes ('magnesium ion') have also been researched. Primary cells Primary magnesium cells have been developed since the early 20th century. A number of chemistries for reserve battery types have been researched, with cathode materials including silver chloride, copper(I) chloride, palladium(II) chloride, copper(I) iodide, copper(I) thiocyanate, manganese dioxide and air (oxygen). For example, a water activated silver chloride/magnesium reserve battery became commercially available by 1943. The magnesium dry battery type BA-4386 was fully commercialised, with costs per unit approaching that of zinc batteries – in comparison to equivalent zinc-carbon cells the batteries had greater capacity by volume, and longer shelf life. The BA-4386 was widely used by the US military from 1968 until c.1984 when it was replaced by a lithium thionyl chloride battery. A magnesium–air fuel cell has theoretical operating voltages of 3.1 V and energy densities of 6.8 kWh/kg. General Electric produced a magnesium air fuel cell operating in neutral NaCl solution as early as the 1960s. The magnesium air battery is a primary cell, but has the potential to be 'refuelable' by replacement of the anode and electrolyte. Magnesium air batteries have been commercialised and find use as land based backup systems as well as undersea power sources, using seawater as the electrolyte. Secondary cells=Overview Magnesium is under research as a possible replacement or improvement on lithium-ion battery in certain applications: In comparison to lithium as an anode material magnesium has a (theoretical) energy density per unit mass under half that of lithium (18.8 MJ/kg vs. 42.3 MJ/kg), but a volumetric energy density around 50% higher (32.731 GJ/m3 vs. 22.569 GJ/m3). In comparison to metallic lithium anodes, magnesium anodes do not exhibit dendrite formation, which may allow magnesium metal to be used without an intercalation compound at the anode; the ability to use a magnesium anode without an intercalation layer raises the theoretical maximum relative volumetric energy density to around 5 times that of a lithium ion cell. Additionally, modeling and cell analysis have indicated that magnesium based batteries may have a cost advantage over lithium due to the abundance of magnesium on earth and the relative scarcity of lithium deposits. Potential use of a Mg based battery had been recognised as early as the 1990s based on a V2O5, TiS2, or Ti2S4 cathode materials and magnesium metal anodes. However observation of instabilities in the discharge state and uncertainties on the role of water in the electrolyte limited progress was reported. The first successful rechargeable cell was reported in 2000, based on Chevrel-type Mo6S8 cathode with a magnesium organohaloaluminate / THF based electrolyte. As of 2018 secondary magnesium battery research had not produced a commercialisable battery, with specific challenges being the electrolytes and cathode materials. As of 2015 the barriers to producing a commercially useful magnesium battery were the lack of demonstrated practical electrolytes and high energy density cathode materials for magnesium ions. ResearchAnodes and electrolytes= A key drawback to using a metallic magnesium anode is the tendency to form a passivating (non conducting) layer when recharging, blocking further charging (in contrast to lithium's behaviour); The passivating layers were thought to originate from decomposition of the electrolyte during magnesium ion reduction. Common counter ions such as perchlorate and tetrafluoroborate were found to contribute to passivation, as were some common polar aprotic solvents such as carbonates and nitriles. Early attempts to develop magnesium batteries explored the use of 'magnesium insertion electrodes', based on reversible insertion of magnesium metal into metal alloy anode (such as Bismuth/Antinomy or Tin). These have been shown to be able to prevent anode surface passivation, but suffered from anode destruction due to volumetric changes on insertion, as well as slow kinetics of insertion. Examples of insertion anode types researched include Sn, Mg2Sn. Grignard based ethereal electrolytes have been shown not to passivate; Magnesium organoborates also showed electroplating without passivation. The compound Mg(BPh2Bu2)2 was used in the first demonstrated rechargeable magnesium battery, its usefulness was limited by electrochemical oxidation (i.e. a low anodic limit of the voltage window). Other electrolytes researched include borohydrides, phenolates, alkoxides, amido based complexes (e.g. based on hexamethyldisilazane), carborane salts, fluorinated alkoxyborates, a Mg(BH4)(NH2) solid state electrolyte, and gel polymers containing Mg(AlCl2EtBu)2 in tetraglyme/PVDF. The current wave of interest in magnesium- metal batteries started in 2000, when an Israeli group reported reversible magnesium plating from mixed solutions of magnesium chloride and aluminium chloride in ethers, such as THF. The primary advantage of this electrolyte is a significantly larger positive limit of the voltage window (and, thus, a higher battery voltage) than of the previously reported Mg plating electrolytes. Since then, several other Mg salts, less corrosive than chloride, have been reported. One drawback compared to lithium is magnesium's higher charge (+2) in solution, which tends to result in increased viscosity and reduced mobility in the electrolyte. In solution a number of species may exist depending on counter ions/complexing agents – these often include singly charged species (e.g. MgCl+ in the presence of chloride) – though dimers are often formed (e.g. Mg2Cl3+ ). The movement of the magnesium ion into cathode host lattices is also (as of 2014) problematically slow. In 2018 a chloride free electrolyte together with a quinone based polymer cathode demonstrated promising performance, with up to per kg energy density, up to 3.4 kW/kg power density, and up to 87% retention at 2,500 cycles. The absence of chloride in the electrolyte was claimed to improve ion kinetics, and so reduce the amount of electrolyte used, increasing performance density figures. A promising approach could be the combination of a Mg anode with a sulfur/carbon cathode. Therefore, a non-nucleophilic electrolyte is necessary which does not convert the sulfur into sulfide just by its reducing properties. Such electrolytes have been developed on the basis of chlorine containing and chlorine-free complex salts. The electrolyte in is a Mg salt containing Mg cation and two boron-hexafluoroisoproplylate groups as anions. This system is easy to synthesize, it shows an ionic conductivity similar to that of Li ion cells, its electrochemical stability window is up to 4.5 V, it is stable in air and versatile towards different solvents. =Cathode materials= For cathode materials a number of different compounds have been researched for suitability, including those used in magnesium primary batteries. New cathode materials investigated or proposed include zirconium disulfide, cobalt(II,III) oxide, tungsten diselenide, vanadium pentoxide and vanadate based cathodes. Cobalt based spinels showed inferior kinetics to insertion compared to their behaviour with lithium. In 2000 the chevrel phase form of Mo6S8 was shown to have good suitability as a cathode, enduring 2000 cycles at 100% discharge with a 15% loss; drawbacks were poor low temperature performance (reduced Mg mobility, compensated by substituting Selenium), as well as a low voltage, c. 1.2V, and low energy density (110mAh/g). A molybdenum disulfide cathode showed improved voltage and energy density, 1.8V and 170mAh/g. Transition metal sulfies are considered promising candidates for magnesium ion battery cathodes. A hybrid magnesium cell using a mixed magnesium/sodium electrolyte with sodium insertion into a nanocrystalline iron(II) disulfide cathode was reported in 2015. Manganese dioxide based cathodes have shown good properties, but deteriorated on cycling. Modified manganese-based spinels (\\"post spinels\\") are an active topic of research (2014) for magnesium-ion insertion cathodes. In 2014 a rechargeable magnesium battery was reported utilising an ion exchanged, olivine type MgFeSiO4 cathode with a bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide/triglyme electrolyte – the cell showed a capacity of 300mAh/g with a voltage of 2.4V. MgMnSiO4 has also been investigated as a potential Mg2+ insertion cathode. Cathodic materials other than non-inorganic metal oxide/sulfide types have also been investigated : in 2015 a cathode based on a polymer incorporating anthraquinone was reported; and other organic, and organo-polymer cathode materials capable of undergoing redox reactions have also been investigated, such as poly-2,2'-dithiodianiline. Quinone based cathodes also formed the cathode a high energy density magnesium battery reported by researchers in 2019. In 2016 a porous carbon/iodine combination cathode was reported as a potential alternative to Mg2+ insertion cathodes - the chemistry was reported as being potentially suitable for a rechargeable flow battery. Commercialisation In Oct 2016, Honda and Saitec (Saitama Industrial Technology Center) claimed to have a commercialisable Mg battery, based on a xerogel cathode of vanadium pentoxide/sulfur. A commercialisation date of 2018 was also claimed.

There are four described species placed into the genus, Cyrtopone curiosa, Cyrtopone elongata, Cyrtopone microcephala, and Cyrtopone striata. Cyrtopone is one several Lutetian Ponerinae genera. History and classification When described, Cyrtopone was known from four fossil insects which are compression-impression fossils preserved in layers of soft sedimentary rock. Along with other well preserved insect fossils, the Cyrtopone specimens were collected from layers of the Lutetian Messel pit World Heritage Site. The formation is composed of brown coals, oil shales, and bituminous shale, which preserved numerous insects, fish, birds, reptiles, and terrestrial mammals as a notable lagerstätten. The area is a preserved maar lake which initially formed approximately 47 million years ago as the result of volcanic explosions. At the time of description, the four holotype specimens were preserved in the Senckenberg Research Station Messel fossil collections. The fossils were described by Gennady Dlussky and Sonja Wedmann in a 2012 paper on the poneromorph ants of Messel, with the genus and four species named in it. The genus name is a combination of the ant genus Ponera and the Greek word cyrtos, meaning curved. Cyrtopone is one of five extinct genera from three subfamilies which have species described from Messel Formation fossils by Dlussky and Wedmann in 2012. Three of the other genera Cephalopone, Messelepone, and Protopone are also placed in Ponerinae. The genus Casaleia is placed in Amblyoponinae, while the last genus Pseudectatomma is in Ectatomminae. Description The Cyrtopone queens from Messel are described as having approximate body lengths ranging between . Species have heads that are distinctly small, the mesosoma being about 2 times greater in length. The subtriangular mandibles are up to one half the head length and have toothed chewing faces. Like Protopone species, the antennae sockets are widely placed on the head, in contrast to those seen in Pachycondyla which are close together. The node shaped petiole is shorter than the height, with a helcium that projects of the front face of the gasteral segment. C. curiosa C. curiosa The only C. curiosa fossil is of a wingless gyne preserved in profile view with a body about long. The head is slightly rectangular and 1.8 times shorter than the mesosoma. The sides are mostly straight, while the back corners are rounded the back edge is convex and the eyes are placed just behind the middle point of the head. The antennae have a scape which reaches just past the back edge of the head. The frons stretches across a quarter of the head front. The mesosoma is massive, and 3.2 times longer than the scutum. The species name \\"curiosa\\" is derived from the Latin curiosus which means funny. C. elongata C. elongata The described C. elongata fossil is the only queen preserved as dorsal impression. The body length of the winged queen is approximately long with a node shaped petiole and a mesosoma that is double the length of the head. As with C. curiosa, the head has nearly parallel sides rounded back corners and a convex back margin, though the head in C. elongata is distinctly rectangular. The oval eyes are placed just to the front of the heads midpoint and the gena are bigger than the maximum eye width. The antennae have a scape which reaches the back edge of the head, while the segments gradually thicken from scape to tip. but they do not form a distinct club at the tip. Each of the antenna segments are about the same width as they are long. The mandibles are approximately 45% to 50% the length of the head. Dlussky and Wedmann coined the species name elongata from the Latin \\"elongates\\" meaning elongated. C. microcephala C. striata C. microcephala is known from a single fossil, a winged gyne preserved in profile view. The body has an approximate length of with an essentially square head. The head is 1.5 times shorter than the mesosoma and has a sculpturing of small pits. The clypeus has a trapazohedral shape to the lower edge, and the eyes are placed at the middle point of the head. The antennae have segments that are 2 times as long as they are wide, with a scape which reaches to the back edge of the head. The mandibles are small, being under half the head length and each chewing side is toothed. The species name is taken from the Greek \\"microcephalos\\", which translates to \\"with a small head\\". C. striata The largest of the Cyrtopone species, C. striata has a body length of about and has the biggest difference between head and mesosoma, the head being 2.5 times shorter. The winged gyne is a dorsal impression showing distinct sculpturing on the head and scutum made of longitudinal ridges. The eyes are small, placed near the center of the head, and the gena below them are nearly one and a half times longer than the eye diameter. The scape is longer than in the other species with one third of its length extending past the back margin of the head. The metatibiae shows two spurs, a simple and a pectinate one.

Typically, possession in science fiction involves extraterrestrial parasitic organisms that can take control of a human host. During the Cold War era in the western world, this was often a metaphor for the threat of communism.  Print = The Puppet Masters (1951)  In Robert Heinlein's novel The Puppet Masters, slugs from Titan, the largest of Saturn's moons, can take over human bodies and know everything their hosts know.  Animorphs  In the Animorphs universe created by author K.A. Applegate, the Yeerks are a parasitic species capable of controlling human beings and compatible other species. Individuals controlled (infested) by Yeerks are known as \\"Controllers.\\" Yeerks have access to the memories and personalities of their hosts, and can exist undetected by friends and family. The Yeerks are conquerors, and use infestation as a means of infiltration on still-unconquered worlds (such as Terra). Yeerks can relatively easily move from one host to another, and in fact have to leave their hosts regularly (every three days) in order to feed on Kandrona rays.  Film and television = Invaders from Mars (1953)  In Invaders from Mars, mind-control crystals at the base of the skull enable the Martians to turn their victims into saboteurs.  Star Trek  In the Star Trek universe, the Trill are a symbiotic pair of species consisting of parasites and hosts. The Trill Dax is a main character in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, first joined with Jadzia Dax, then after she is killed, with Ezri Dax. The parasitic species can also control human beings, but not for extended periods of time (see episode \\"The Host\\" of Star Trek: The Next Generation).  Stargate  In the Stargate universe, the Goa'uld are a parasitic species which can control human beings and other compatible species. The Goa'uld forcibly take hosts, whereas the Tok'ra, though the same species, exist consensually as symbiotic beings with their hosts. Goa'uld have access to the memories and personalities of their hosts, and can exist undetected by friends and family. Goa'uld are often power-hungry and take on the roles of gods from the mythologies of the humans that they infest. Infestation is also used as a means of infiltration or access to information. Goa'uld can move from one host to another, but with some difficulty. Goa'uld also have the ability to kill or torture their hosts.

Its flagship station, One Double X, reaches the entire Bay of Plenty, with specific frequencies Ōhope and Te Puke and live streaming on its website. It also owns and operates subsidiary network Bayrock in the Bay Of Plenty and Ōhope, with an additional frequency in Wanaka in the South Island and similar live-streaming on a separate website. The New Zealand radio market is mostly consolidated into large nationwide networks with powerful brands and limited local content. Radio Bay of Plenty produces independent local programming and news coverage for the Bay of Plenty with a specific focus on the eastern part of the region. The stations carry and contributes to national news bulletins produced by NZME Radio through Newstalk ZB. One Double X began broadcasting to the Eastern Bay Of Plenty on 1240 kHz at 10:30 am on 30 June 1971. The original company name was Radio Whakatane but changed to Radio Bay Of Plenty in 1978 when the station's AM frequency also changed to 1242 kHz. In the mid- late 1970s 1XX 1240 was also known on air from time to time as Coastline Radio, Coastline One 24, Coastline 1-2-4, One 24 Double X or Coastline Double X. 1XX began broadcasting on 90.5 MHz at 12:12:12 pm on 12 December 1988. History=1971-1982 The Strand in Whakātane, about four years after the station started in 1971. The idea of a locally based and privately owned Eastern Bay of Plenty station was first floated in 1969, prompted by the efforts of pirate station Radio Hauraki, broadcasting to Auckland from boats in the Hauraki Gulf. One Double X was granted a broadcasting license in 1970, with the 1 in the call-sign signifying the upper North Island location, the first X representing private ownership and the second X chosen by the station. Its original slogan included the words \\"from the Eastern Bay of Plenty, wherever you may go, the entertainment's better when you dial 1 2 4 0\\". Broadcasting Minister H.J. Walker officially opened the station at 10.30am on Wednesday 30 June 1971. It initially broadcast 19.5 hours of live original local content from 5.00am to 12.30am each day with additional 24-hour licenses granted during some summer holiday seasons. The station was not allowed to broadcast advertising on Sundays and did all its own local and international news and sports reporting. It gave away one of the country's first colour televisions in a contest in 1974. It was also the feature of a television documentary in July 1977. 1982-1987 In January 1982 1XX ran a short term station as the first FM stereo radio station in New Zealand, under the name FM 90.7. It ran from 5 January until 31 January 1982, and over the summer of 1982 to 1983. It was only on the air from 16:00 to midnight and outside these broadcast times the station was simply off the air, as 1XX was not allowed to broadcast their programme on this FM frequency. The programme was completely separate to the 1XX programme that continued to broadcast on AM, and 1XX did not begin permanently broadcasting on FM until 1988. The station only operated during the late afternoon and evenings from 4pm to midnight operating 2 shifts. Each night of the week FM 90.7 would play a different format programme to cater to different audiences. Monday was country music, Tuesday was album rock, Wednesdays were classical music, Thursdays were jazz music and Fridays were rock music and soul music. On Saturdays, top 40 music got its first play on FM radio in New Zealand, while Sundays were dedicated to big band music and \\"beautiful music\\". 1987-2001 Edgecumbe earthquake One Double X became a major source of information for Bay of Plenty residents during the 1987 Edgecumbe earthquake. Local newsreader Chris Bullen provided an initial report on 2 March that \\"a series of what the D.S.I.R. describes as major earthquakes have hit the Eastern Bay of Plenty this afternoon\\". The station was taken off- air for 30 to 40 minutes due to a landline disconnection, but a radio link allowed the station to get back on air. Announcer Cliff Stockwell and newsreader Chris Bullen hosted around-the-clock coverage, while outdoor broadcast equipment allowed staff to provide live updates from the Civil Defence bases in Whakatāne, Kawerau and Edgecumbe. A similar approach was taken to reporting a mini tornado in Whakatāne later that year. In Summer 1987/1988 1XX ran another summer FM station from Ōhope – 93 Splash FM. Splash FM began broadcasting in December 1987 and ran to May 1988. The Splash FM programme was simulcast on 1XX between 7pm and 6am the next morning while Splash FM was on the air. During this time the Rock N Roll 500 was played. In Summer 1991-1992 99.3 Moro FM was also run from Ōhope by 1XX, under sponsorship from Moro chocolate bar manufacturer Cadbury. The 1XX programme was played on Cadbury Moro FM between 11pm and 6am the next morning. The complete transition to FM broadcasting was made on 12 December 1988. Announcer Terry Casserly had to ad-lib during the opening broadcast, when a live cross to company chairman Ross Neiderer was lost to dead air. The 90.5 FM from Mount Putauaki was the most powerful FM signal in the Bay of Plenty and was used as the station's main frequency, with a simulcast on the station's previous AM frequency. Another frequency on 93.0 FM was used to relay 1XX in Ōhope from Waitangi Day 4 February 1989. 2001- In September 2001 Radio 1XX started a small local station in Te Puke called 92.9 Kiwi FM as a short term station for the annual Kiwifruit Festival, the station went back on the air in September 2002 and 2003. A local breakfast show was broadcast to Te Puke residents between 6 am and 10 am and outside these times the 1XX programme was played. The station reached Puke, Tauranga, Mount Maunganui, Rotorua and Matata and was not related to Kiwi FM network stations operated by MediaWorks New Zealand. In November 2004 92.9 Kiwi FM extended to round-the-year broadcasting, with local programming 6am-6pm Monday–Friday and 6am–10am Saturday. Outside this time the 1XX programme was simulcast. Kiwi FM changed frequency to 89.0FM in early 2011 but shut down local operations on 27 May 2011 and now broadcasts the 1XX programme 24/7. Station founder Debbie Chote said the station was \\"all about the positives, we just don't talk negative\\" and was all about making people smile. She put the closure down the economic climate reducing demand for advertising, and said the station was no longer commercially viable and the closure was \\"a sign of the times\\". The closure was also met with disappointment from local businesses that had advertised on the station. Stations=One Double X This is the logo of One Double X.

It was designed and built in 1921 by Andrew Lang Petrie. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Apple Tree Creek War Memorial was unveiled on 20 March 1921. It was designed and produced by Andrew Lang Petrie of Toowong, Brisbane at a cost of . The stone memorial honours the 77 local men who served during the First World War, including the 15 who died. Apple Tree Creek developed as a farming community in the 1870s and 80s. The Central Sugar Mill opened in 1895 boosting the economy of the district and by the outbreak of the First World War there were fifty farmers registered in the Post Office Directory, a school, hotel, and store. The 77 men who volunteered from this district represented a substantial proportion of their generation and a movement to commemorate their participation began in 1917. Prior to the erection of war memorials, Queensland had little public sculpture and there were few statues or monuments of note even in Brisbane. Although Queensland did send a contingent of men to South Africa during the Boer War (1899 - 1902) memorials to soldiers who served in this war are uncommon. Australia's participation in the First World War (1914 - 1918) however, had an immense impact on the population. The national loss was 60,000 dead and 152,000 wounded from a population of approximately 5 million. Almost 1 in 5 men who went to fight died and their bodies were not returned for burial. The battles were fought in countries far from Australia and even after the war visiting cemeteries in the countries where Australians fought was not possible for most families. The impetus for the creation of memorials as an expression of public mourning was therefore very strong and they became a focus for an outpouring of grief. As substitute war graves they became symbols of remembrance which were treated with reverence and respect. The prominent siting of war memorials and the materials, designs and symbolism used in their construction were meant to honour those who served, ensure lasting remembrance of the dead and draw the attention of the \\"rising generation\\" to their noble example. The memorials also served as an acknowledgment of what was seen as a coming of age for Australia as a nation and memorials honour those who died as having made \\"the supreme sacrifice \\" for the good of nation and empire. As memorials were funded by the community, they are true public expression of both grief and national pride and were erected in almost every community. No war since has triggered this kind of response; the dead of World War Two being commemorated largely by adding their names to World War One memorials or by dedicating practical projects to their memory. The Apple Tree Creek memorial was funded by public subscription and prominently positioned in the local recreation reserve. This not only provided an attractive setting, but was a community gathering place and was sited opposite the local school. It was unveiled on 20 March 1921 and was originally crowned with a \\"digger\\" statue. Although not highly regarded by artists or architects, this design was the popular choice of Queensland communities, perhaps seeming more personal to families and representing the qualities of the ideal Australian. Most statues were constructed by local masonry firms, although some were imported. They varied slightly in design, presumably to suit the needs of the communities who commissioned them. Originally a captured gun or \\"war trophy\\" contributed to the setting; however, this has now gone. The pedestal of the memorial is a standard A L Petrie design, first used in 1918 at Ebbw Vale. Andrew Lang Petrie was the grandson of Andrew Petrie, an early colonist of Queensland and a prominent architect-builder. When Petrie Senior died in 1872, he was succeeded by his son John Petrie. In 1880, A L Petrie joined his father to form the partnership John Petrie and Son, based at Fortitude Valley with branch masonry works at Toowong Cemetery and Townsville. In 1888, A L Petrie became general manager of the firm but was forced into insolvency in 1894. It was not until 1903 that he was able to re-open the monumental masonry business at Toowong Cemetery where many Queensland memorials were produced. In the mid 1970s the memorial was vandalised. The surviving pieces of the statue were removed and put in storage at the RSL sub-branch at Childers. The statue was replaced by a concrete obelisk until a new digger was unveiled on 18 August 1999 by the Honourable Bruce Scott. The reserve also contains a band rotunda in the vicinity of the memorial. This was built in 1911 for the Apple Tree Creek Citizens' Brass Band. It was in regular use for the first decades because many houses lined the creek at that time. By 1975 it had become derelict and underwent extensive repair and reconstruction in 1983. It is one of the few buildings remaining from the early settlement of the area and contributes to the aesthetic qualities of the park.  Description  The First World War Memorial is situated facing the road in a landscaped area within the Apple Tree Creek sports ground which encompasses a cricket ground, rodeo ring and small band rotunda. The memorial comprises a pedestal surmounted by a small concrete obelisk. It is surrounded by an octagonal enclosure of concrete kerbing with a decorative cast iron fence comprising thin pickets with fleur-de-lis finials. The posts are also cast iron and surmounted by Latin crosses. In front of the enclosure is a painted timber fence with a centrally placed cast iron gate. The monument is of Helidon sandstone and sits on a granite base with rough stone faces, margined and chiselled around. Surmounting this are another two steps, both smooth-faced. The lower step has a chamfered top and the words Apple Tree Creek Roll of Honour carved in high relief on the front face. The upper step has plain faces and is capped by cyma recta mouldings. Surmounting this is the pedestal dado comprising a recessed square marble pillar with engaged columns at each corner. It has recessed marble plaques to each side recording the leaded names of the 77 local men who served in the First World War, the names of the 15 who fell being on the front face. The columns have capitals of scrollwork and acanthus leaves which support a large cornice made up of cyma recta and torus mouldings. Above this is a small square pedestal with crossed flags carved in relief on the front face and capped by a small cornice. This forms the base for a small concrete obelisk with tapered sides and a flat top. The nearby band rotunda is constructed of timber with a corrugated iron pavilion style roof topped by a finial. It is octagonal in shape and is raised on high stumps. It is accessed by a staircase on one side and a simple timber balustrade spans between iron columns which are located at each point of the octagon. There are acroteria at each corner.  Heritage listing  Apple Tree Creek War Memorial was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. War memorials are important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history as they are representative of a recurrent theme that involved most communities throughout the state. They provide evidence of an era of widespread Australian patriotism and nationalism, particularly during and following the First World War. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The war memorial is important as a documentary record of those who volunteered for war service in the Apple Tree Creek area as other records are generally organised by name or unit, making it difficult to determine the origin of individuals. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It is also a demonstration of popular taste in the inter-war period. Unveiled in 1921, the memorial at Apple Tree Creek demonstrates the principal characteristics of a commemorative structure erected as an enduring record of a major historical event. This is achieved through the appropriate use of various symbolic elements including columns and flags. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It is of aesthetic significance both for its high level of workmanship and design and as a complementary structure within the park setting. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The memorial has a strong association with the community as evidence of a major historic event which had a personal impact on most families in the district.

It was the country's provisional parliament between 1971 and 1973. In 1972, it drafted and adopted the Constitution of Bangladesh. The assembly was dominated by the Awami League, with a minority being independent lawmakers. Creation Prior to the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, the first general election of Pakistan saw 169 seats in East Pakistan being contested for the National Assembly of Pakistan and 300 seats for the East Pakistan Provincial Assembly. The Awami League party ran on the platform of developing a new Pakistani constitution based on the 1966 Six Points. The Awami League won 167 out of 169 seats in the National Assembly and 288 out of 300 seats in the Provincial Assembly. Despite gaining the right to form a government, it was not allowed to take power by the erstwhile military junta in West Pakistan. The delay in the transfer of power sparked the liberation war. During the war, elected representatives met in Mujibnagar on 17 April 1971. They signed the Proclamation of Bangladeshi Independence, which was declared as a provisional constitution. The elected representatives were transformed into a constituent assembly. After the war ended, the assembly convened in January 1972. Members The initial tally of members was 469. However, the tally dropped to 404 after the war. Ten legislators had died, of whom five were killed by the Pakistan Army. 23 were disqualified or expelled from their party, the Awami League; and two defected to Pakistan. Shah Abdul Hamid was elected as the assembly's speaker and Mohammad Mohammadullah as deputy speaker. Rules of Procedure The Rules of Procedure was adopted in the first two-day plenary session. Drafting committee The Constitution Drafting Committee was formed on 11 April 1972. It had 34 members with Kamal Hossain as chairman. Razia Banu was its only female member. Barrister Amirul Islam and Advocate Suranjit Sengupta were among the prominent members on the committee. Sengupta was a vocal member of the opposition bench.

Larma said in his speech that \\"Under no definition or logic can a Chakma be a Bengali or a Bengali be a Chakma… As citizens of Bangladesh we are all Bangladeshis, but we also have a separate ethnic identity...\\". Article 70 Under the interim constitution, law making powers resided with the executive branch. When K. M. Obaidur Rahman, an Awami League lawmaker, raised a question as to why the constituent assembly was not given legislative powers, Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman became annoyed. Subsequently, on the advice of the prime minister, President Abu Sayeed Chowdhury introduced the Bangladesh Constituent Assembly (Cessation of Membership) Order 1972. The order stipulated that any resolution by a lawmaker without the approval of his/her party would result in expulsion from the assembly. The order inspired Article 70 of the Constitution of Bangladesh, which bans free votes and crossing the floor.http://cpd.org.bd/pub_attach/To%20Amend%20Article%2070%20or%20not.pdf Enactment The Assembly approved the constitution on 4 November 1972, and it took effect on 16 December 1972—a day commemorated as Victory day in Bangladesh. Once the constitution took effect, the constituent assembly became the provisional parliament of Bangladesh until the first elections under the new constitution took place in 1973. Legacy The constitution founded the unitary parliamentary republic in Bangladesh. It laid down a list of fundamental rights in Bangladesh. The original 1972 constitution is often cited as the most democratic in Bangladesh's history, given later amendments which undermined the constitution's democratic credentials, including the separation of powers, the independence of the judiciary and the freedom of MPs to vote and debate in parliament. However, the constitution left wide powers for judicial review and judicial precedent, making Bangladesh a part of the common law world. The first blows to the original constitution came in 1973 and 1974, when Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's government passed amendments that gave the state the power to suspend fundamental rights during a state of emergency. In 1975, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman enacted a presidential government under a one party state. Following his assassination, quasi- military rulers continued the presidential form of government, but restored multiparty politics. An executive presidency lasted till 1990, when parliamentary democracy was restored; and the presidency returned to its ceremonial nature. As a result of the controversial Article 70, Bangladesh has never seen a no-confidence motion to remove a prime minister, even though the country's prime ministers are often accused of dictatorship and incompetence. The lack of checks and balances is often criticized. The dominance of left- wing parties led by the Awami League in the constituent assembly resulted in numerous references to socialism in the document. The socialist influence contradicts with Bangladesh's largely free market economy. The citizenship debate of \\"Bengali v Bangladeshi\\" contributed to a sense of alienation among the indigenous hill population in the country's southeast, and was seen as a factor behind the Chittagong Hill Tracts conflict, which lasted for two decades until 1997. The unitary state laid down by the constitution has been a stumbling block for decentralizing Bangladesh's judiciary. When the government created High Courts in cities like Sylhet, Rajshahi and Chittagong in 1988, the Supreme Court ruled that it was in contradiction of the unitary state.

She was the daughter of the Marchese Andrea Paleotti and his wife Christina (née Dudley), who was descended illegitimately from Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester. Her first marriage (or possibly a liaison) was with a Count Roffeni, who was said to be in the service of Queen Christina of Sweden.Mosley, Charles, editor. Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, 107th edition, 3 volumes. Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 2003. She was apparently widowed when she met the duke in Italy; he claimed to have converted her to Protestantism by lending her a Bible. She married the duke at Augsburg, Bavaria, on 20 August (or September) 1705. He told only his closest friends, saying that he knew that the circumstance of her \\"being a foreigner and without fortune\\" would arouse criticism. Shortly afterwards, on 23 January 1706, an Act came before Parliament to enable her to be naturalised. After their return to Britain, the duchess became known in London society and was favoured by Queen Anne, with whom she is said to have sympathised on the death of Prince George of Denmark, saying: \\"Oh, my poor Queen, I see how much you do miss your dear husband\\". She was an equally big success with King George I, who arranged for her to become a Lady of the Bedchamber to Caroline of Ansbach, Princess of Wales. This situation aroused the jealousy of other court ladies, including Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who satirised the duchess in \\"Roxana\\", one of her \\"Town Eclogues\\". The Duchess of Marlborough, who belonged to a different political camp from the duchess, commented on her lewd behaviour. It was also suggested that she had an affair with Charles Mohun, 4th Baron Mohun, a well-known philanderer. The duchess charmed the French during an official visit to Paris by her husband in 1713. Louis de Rouvroy, Duc de Saint-Simon, thought that her eccentricity bordered on madness, but he agreed with her criticisms of the extreme of French ladies fashions and praised the simple, practical hairstyle which she made fashionable. Shrewsbury and his wife had no children, and at his death the dukedom became extinct, while the earldom passed to a cousin, Gilbert Talbot.

The dance is played by two people in a lion-like costume (called Singo) and accompanied by music. This traditional dance originally came from Blimbing village, Klabang district, Bondowoso Regency, East Java, Indonesia Introduction Singo Ulung is a masked dance arts using barongan, which is the traditional art of Bondowoso regency that usually performed at the annual anniversary of Bondowoso. After several years, this traditional art is also used for entertainment. Its creator Singo came from Blambangan Kingdom. His original name was Juk Seng, because of his ability to turn into a lion. At first glance, this art form looks similar to Barongsai, the lion dance, but the costumes and the equipment are quite simple. The players wear training pants and T-shirts, and the lion- shaped costume is made of rope. History The traditional dance was created by a respected man named Singo, who came from Blambangan. He ran from Blambangan to save himself and stayed in Blimbing village, Klabang district Bondowoso. Singo Ulung and his wife Nyi Moena with Ki Jasiman, were helping and cooperating to create a prosperous life of society at Blimbing village. He cared about the rice field and other people's daily needs. Many people were proud of him. That's why he was chosen to become the first village head of Blimbing village. One day, he had an idea to create a public traditional dance called Singo Ulung played by two people. This dance is accompanied with particular music which makes the audience feel astonished. This art and Pojian art and Ojung art are always shown at the traditional ceremony of Bersih Desa Blimbing held every year in the month of Syaban / Ruwah). On the other hand, this art performance can be enjoyed in the annual moment of Hari Jadi Bondowoso precisely on 16 August. Costume Singo Ulung dancers have a different costume for each role. For the lion “Singo Ulung’s” dancer costume, two people wear the lion costume together, like in Barongsai. The difference between Barongsai and Singo Ulung is that normally Singo Ulung's costume is plain white and sometimes it's a mix of black and white, or yellow and white color. The material of the costume is raffia string decomposed until it looks like fur. Panji and Jasiman wear a costume similar to Tari Topeng's. The female dancers wear traditional dress like kebaya and sampur as the accessories. The warok dancers wear all black with Madhure red-white shirt and bring cemethi as an attribute for their dancing. Development Singo ulung is a unique performance and it is attractive. Singo Ulung Art has become a tradition that is routinely performed in Blimbing village. A ritual village ceremony which performs the art performing of singo ulung traditionally. Research shows that the ritual village ceremony in Blimbing is conducted once a year, it is on 13-15 of the month of Sya’ban (it is believed as the existence of Blimbing Village). It is necessary to perform Singo Ulung in the ritual village ceremony, because it is considered as a main mean and it is not able to be replaced by others. In addition, Singo Ulung is also often featured in the anniversary event of Bondowoso. Singo Ulung dance is still being preserved and studied by several art galleries there. Besides the displays at the big event, the dance is also shown in other events such as welcoming guests and at festivals, in an effort to preserve and introduce to the public the traditional art from Bondowoso.

The temple finds mention in Brahmanda Purana, which mentions that Vishnu appeared as Narasimha to the sages performing penance at this place after killing the demon king Hiranyakasipu. Hiranyakasipu was troubling the Devas as he got a boon from Brahma that no human can kill him. His son Prahlada was an ardent devotee of Vishnu, which Hiranyakasipu discouraged. He also tried to slay Prahalad by various means, but was saved by the divine grace of Vishnu. Vishnu took the avatar of Narasimha and appeared from a pillar. Narasimha was a human with lion face and slayed Hiranyakasipu on an evening time in a doorway, which was neither land nor air. His anger was not quenched even after slaying the demon king, but Prahalad sang and prayed Narasimha to calm down, which he acceded to. He is also believed to have quenched his anger by bathing at the temple tank in this place. The water is believed to have turned red after the incident. History Narasimha temple towers. Steps leading up the hill to reach the Narasimha temple. Singaperumalkovil was originally called by various names like Azhwar Narasingadevar and Narsinga Vinnagar Azhwar. The original temple is believed to have been built in Rock-cut architecture by the Pallavas, who built cave temples of similar kind in the area. The inscriptions on the walls of the temple are from the chola regime during the 10-11th centuries. The inscriptions are made in Telugu, Grantha and Tamil scripts. The oldest inscription is found from the period of Raja Raja Chola (985-1016 CE), the most famous Chola emperor from Thanjavur in 990 indicating a gift of 26 sheep for the perpetual lighting of the temple. Another inscription from Andal shrine is mutilated, but indicates a gift by an individual to the presiding deity. The third inscription is mutilated, presumably from the 11th century indicating gifts to the temple. Architecture thumb The temple is built in Rock-cut architecture, occupies around and has two precincts. It is located in Singaperumalkoil, a suburb located from Chennai, the capital of the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The presiding deity housed in the sanctum in a cave is a rock-cut image, in seated posture with his right leg bent and left leg left hanging. Narasimha has four hands with two of the top hands holding his conch and Chakra, while the other two hands showing Abaya Mudra and Uru hasta (resting on his lap). Ugra Narasimha is sported with a third eye on his forehead, which is usually a feature of Shiva temples. The sanctum is guarded by two Dvarapalas image on either sides. The shrine of his consort, Ahobilavalli is located in the second precinct, which is believed to be a later addition. There is a shrine of Andal located to the right of the sanctum. While the two shrines of Ahobilavalli and Andal have precincts, unlike the shrine of Narasimhar. The shrine of Garuda facing Narasimhar, the eagle mount of Vishnu, is located axial to the central shrine. The central shrine is approached through Mahamandapa, the worship hall and a narrow Ardha mandapam. The flagpost is located behind the shrine of Garuda, axial to the central shrine and the gateway tower. There are images of Azhwars in the worship hall on both sides and the shrine of Ahobilavalli is located in the second precinct. The vimana, the roof over the sanctum, has stucco images of various avatars of Vishnu. There are separate shrines of Lakshmi Narasimha, Ramanuja, Manavala Mamunigal and Vishwaksena. Worship practices and festivals left The temple follows Thenkalai tradition of worship based on Vaikasana Agamic tradition. The temple is open from 6:30 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Ushathkalam at 8 a.m., Kalasanthi at 10:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 5:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 8:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Narasimhar and his consort Ahobilavalli. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. Various festivals are celebrated in the temple, with the Chittirai Brahmotsavam during April–May, Narasimha Jayanthi, Pavithra Utsavam during Aani (June–July) and Maasi float festival during February–March being the most prominent. During Aani Brahmotsavam, the temple car housing the festival deities of Narasimhar and Ahobilavalli is drawn around the streets of Singaperumalkoil. During the float festival in February–March, the presiding deities are drawn in a float in the temple tank. There are festivals almost every month in the temple. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.

In the midst of the guerrilla war between the people of Bondowoso and the Dutch colonizer, 100 men were arrested on suspicion of being revolutionaries. The men where stuffed into 3 railway cars headed from the Bondowoso train station to the Kalisosok Prison in Surabaya, about 250 kilometers away because of alleged overcrowding at the local jail. The sealed cars, made of timber and corrugated iron, allowed little oxygen and created an extreme heat. Based on the testimony of one of the survivors, when the train stopped at sidings along the 16-hour journey, the prisoners hit the walls and shouted for food and water. They were told only bullets were available and nothing would be supplied until the train reached Surabaya. However, when the train reached its destination only 12 were left unharmed by lack of oxygen and heat stress. All the men in the first car were alive though some were seriously sick. In the second car, eight were dead. In the last wagon no one had survived.  Monument  The monument is located in the centre of the city of Bondowoso, between the alun-alun (city central square) and the regency government office.

Early life and education  Born David Ejikeme Uzochukwu in Innsbruck, Austria, to an Austrian mother and a Nigerian father. He was raised in Innsbruck, before moving to Luxembourg and Brussels. He has since lived in Vienna and Berlin where he studies towards a Bachelor of Fine Arts in philosophy at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin.  Work  Uzochukwu started with self-portraiture and evolved to photographing portraits in nature. His photography combines post-production and intimate portraiture, frequently imparting images with an aura of isolation hanging over his body in physical manifestations of smoke, clouds, water, and fire. His surreal images present, for example, blue skies that become walls, crystals that float in mid-air, volcanic sand that becomes a comforting shroud, or blood that turns into a mask. His work has often channeled his observations on race and queerness. At Unseen Amsterdam, for instance, he premiered a series of photographs which used the image of humanoid water creatures, equipped with fins, tails, or sharp teeth. In 2019, Uzochukwu was quoted saying that these works express 'what it means to be dubbed 'black,\\" to have an oppressive notion of race imposed upon, and to thrive nonetheless.' His latest project is a celebration of Nigerian creatives. Each portrait focuses on the 'disruptive energy' these artists use to push boundaries and make things happen. His work is inspired by artists such as American photographer Gregory Crewdson and Kenyan-American artist Wangechi Mutu, whose works construct personal universes that conflate gender, race, art history, and personal identity. In 2016, his series A Familiar Ruin was shown at BOZAR Center for Fine Arts as part of the group show Dey Your Lane!, curated by Nigerian Azu Nwagbogu.

Before focusing on photography as a tool for social justice, Matika received her teaching certification and worked in primary education at The Tulalip Heritage High School for 5 years. There, she experienced firsthand the lack of educational resources to teach indigenous intelligence and dismayed that the curriculum being taught did not provide Native youths with positive imagery and understanding. Thus began the momentum behind Project 562. Life Wilbur was born on April 28, 1984. She grew up in La Conner, Washington and graduated from La Conner High School. She received her bachelor's degree from the Brooks Institute of Photography in 2006. Art career Wilbur's three initial photographic projects include We Are One People, a photograph collection of Coast Salish elders; We Emerge, a photograph collection of Native people in contemporary settings, and Save the Indian and Kill the Man, a collection of Native youth expressing their identities. Her other work includes \\"\\", presenting images interwoven with cedar bark. The artist specializes in hand-tinted, black-and-white silver gelatin prints. She plans on publishing a book about her photography.  Project 562  Project 562 is Wilbur's fourth major project to document contemporary Indigenous peoples. She began traveling throughout the US in November 2012 with the goal of photographing members all US tribes on their tribal lands. She has traveled 250,000 miles documenting indigenous people. She raised over $35,000 for her expenses in a Kickstarter campaign. The title Project 562 refers to the number of Indigenous North American tribes officially recognized by the United States at the time Wilbur began the work. That number has since changed, reflecting the ongoing legal efforts of individual tribes to regain legal status after the decimation of tribal status under the United States Termination policy. Wilbur notes that her grandmother came to her in a dream suggesting she do this work of photographing a member from every federally recognized tribe. She works collaboratively with tribal leaders and members to create the photographs. Wilbur conceives of Project 562 as an answer to Edward Curtis' photographs, a century earlier, of Indigenous Americans. Project 562 shows Indigenous Americans through the lens an Indigenous American photographer.  Podcast  Wilbur also hosts the podcast \\"All My Relations\\" with Adrienne Keene.

Until 1999, there were intermittent battles, and the area was unsafe as the last remaining Khmer Rouge still had control of nearby Anlong Veng. In 2003, an international border crossing was opened between O Smach and the adjacent town of Chong Chom in Thailand's Surin Province. There has since opened a strip of casinos between the Cambodian and Thai passport control counters, enabling Thais to gamble in Cambodia without needing to go through Cambodian immigration. Gambling is illegal in Thailand and gambling in Cambodia is legal only for foreign passport holders. O Smach is at the northern terminus of Road 68 which turns north off National Highway 6 at Kravanh in Siem Reap Province. Border crossing Most of Cambodia's northern border with Thailand is formed by the escarpment of the Dângrêk Mountains. A natural pass cuts through the mountains between O Smach and Chong Chom. This pass has been used since ancient times to travel between the plains of lower Cambodia and the Khorat Plateau. Beginning with the Cambodian Civil War and lasting until the surrender of the last remaining Khmer Rouge who had taken refuge in Anlong Veng, the Khmer Rouge controlled the area and generated income by illegally trading Cambodian timber across the border in Thailand. After the final surrender of the Khmer Rouge in 1999, the region surrounding the O Smach pass once again became stable and safe for travelers and, in 2003, the Cambodian and Thai governments opened an international border crossing. The border crossing suffered intermittent closures again between 2008 and 2011 during the Cambodian–Thai border dispute. The Thai government agreed to fund the extension of Cambodian National Road 68 from the provincial capital of Samraong to O Smach with an unspecified loan amount. Immediately, two casino hotels and a market were built in a strip between the Cambodian border control checkpoint and the Thai border crossing checkpoint at Chong Chom in Kap Choeng District, Surin Province to cater to Thai nationals coming to Cambodia to gamble. Gambling in Thailand is illegal but in Cambodia it is legal, although only for holders of foreign passports. This arrangement ensures Thai citizens can leave Thailand to gamble in O Smach and then return home without having to pass through Cambodian immigration. Thais living close to Chong Chom are responsible for the bulk of cross border activities. The O Smach border crossing is the least used among the Thai/Cambodian checkpoints. Most tourists en route to Siem Reap and Angkor Wat, cross the border at Poipet which is also the more popular gambling destination due to its relative ease of access from Bangkok. O Smach benefits more from international trade. , O Smach and its Thai counterpart, Chong Chom, had all the necessary customs facilities except for an agricultural quarantine officer. The main product exported from Cambodia through O Smach is cassava. There is also a large market for second-hand bicycles which are imported to Cambodia from Japan, taken to O Smach and sold across the border to Thais at the Chong Chom market. The primary imports at O Smach is used farm equipment, mostly tractors and trucks. Construction materials and petroleum products are also imported to Cambodia through O Smach. Future development As of 2015, the only vehicle crossing between Cambodia and Thailand was at Poipet.

Career Hardy studied at Auburn University during the 1970s. At that time he was interested in theater.Alabama dentist pursues acting after ‘Troll 2', The Auburn Plainsman, 3/9/2018 He took acting classes, but gave up the idea of becoming an actor because he was feared that it wouldn't be a practical career.Alabama dentist pursues acting after ‘Troll 2', The Auburn Plainsman, 3/9/2018 Hardy eventually became a dentist. He was practicing in Salt Lake City when he auditioned for Troll 2 at the urging of some of his patients. He ended up winning the role of farmer Michael Waits, head of the family that falls victim to the titular villains. After the film's dismal reception following a direct- to-video release, he returned to practicing dentistry full-time and did not pursue acting any further. Word of mouth slowly spread about Troll 2 regarding how laughably poor it was, allowing a loyal fanbase to develop. This reached a head with the Upright Citizens Brigade's 2006 \\"Troll 2 Experience\\" screening, where Hardy was thrust back into the limelight as a guest of honor (along with several other cast members). He and fellow co-star Michael Stephenson collaborated shortly thereafter on the behind-the-scenes documentary Best Worst Movie (2009). This film has gone on to receive widespread critical and audience acclaim and was the centerpiece of an international tour that both Hardy and Stephenson engaged in between 2009 and 2010. Following the success of Best Worst Movie, Hardy revived his acting career and has been involved in numerous projects. These include Eric Hordes' yet-to-be-released film Goblin 2, in which he reprises his Troll 2 role of Michael Waits. Hardy had his first leading role since Troll 2 when he played Sgt. Travis Delmore in Texas Cotton (2018), which he also executive produced.

She has served as a Member of the National Assembly of Quebec since 2015, representing Saint-Henri–Sainte-Anne. She was the first woman to lead the Quebec Liberal Party, the first black woman to lead a provincial party in Quebec, and the first person of Haitian descent to be a cabinet minister in Canada. She is the daughter of the academic Georges Anglade. Early life and education Anglade was born in Montreal to Georges Anglade and Merille Anglade. Georges Anglade was a founder of the Université du Québec and a longtime professor there, as well as a special advisor to both Jean-Bertrand Aristide and René Préval. Dominique Anglade spent much of her youth in Haiti, but returned to Canada to attend university. Anglade holds an MBA from HEC Montréal and a Bachelor of Industrial Engineering from the École Polytechnique de Montréal.\\"Qui est Dominique Anglade?\\". TVA, January 28, 2016. Before she entered politics, Anglade worked for the consulting firm McKinsey & Company in Montreal. Political career=Coalition Avenir Québec Anglade was formerly associated with the Coalition Avenir Québec. She ran as the CAQ candidate in Fabre in the 2012 election, losing to Liberal Gilles Ouimet. She served as the president of the CAQ from 2012 to 2013.\\"Dominique Anglade abandons CAQ over identity, immigration views\\". CBC News, September 25, 2015. She left that position to become CEO of Montreal International. Québec Liberal Party In 2015, Anglade joined the Quebec Liberal Party, and stood as their candidate in a by-election for Saint-Henri–Sainte-Anne. She explained her political shift by citing objections to the CAQ's positions on ethnic identity and immigration. She was elected on November 9. She served in the cabinet of Philippe Couillard as the Minister of Economic Development, Innovation and Export Trade from 2016 to 2018. This made Anglade the first person of Haitian descent to exercise a ministerial function in Canada. In 2017, Anglade was named Deputy Premier of Quebec, holding that office until the Liberal government's defeat in the 2018 election. On June 27, 2019, following the departure of Philippe Couillard as party leader, Anglade announced her candidacy for the 2020 Quebec Liberal Party leadership election. She ran on a platform of returning the party to the nationalism associated with previous leaders Robert Bourassa and Jean Lesage. She also emphasized expanding the support base of the PLQ beyond Montreal, since the 2018 defeat of the Liberal Party was largely attributed to an overwhelming rejection by voters who lived outside of Montreal. To that end, she campaigned on a Charter of Regions that made dozens of specific commitments to communities across the province. She was acclaimed leader on May 11, 2020, after her opponent, Alexandre Cusson (Fr), dropped out of the race. Anglade is the first woman to lead the Quebec Liberal Party, and the first black woman to lead a provincial party in Quebec. Other activities Anglade has served on the Board of Directors of several organisations including the Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal, the United Way of Canada, and the Centre hospitalier universitaire Sainte-Justine. Anglade's mother, father, uncle, and cousin were killed in the 2010 Haiti Earthquake.

This station was run by Radio New Zealand (formally the NZBS/NZBC/BCNZ) and eventually spawned a second FM station called B98FM. Today 3ZB and B98FM are part of a nationwide networks Newstalk ZB and The Hits History=Early years The station was started by Radio New Zealand (which at the time was known as the National Broadcasting Service) in 1937 originally broadcasting on 1110AM. The station was branded from the stations callsign 3ZB. ZB stations were assigned to the four main regions in New Zealand, Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin. While content was local some network shows were heard such as Aunt Daisy up until 1963. In 1978 the station moved to 1098AM after New Zealand changed from 10 kHz spacing on the AM band to 9 kHz spacing. Switch to FM 3ZB began broadcasting on 96.1FM in 1990 in additional to the 1098AM frequency. For a short period in 1990 the station also broadcast on 93.7FM. In July 1991 broadcasting on 96.1FM was discontinued and at the same time a decision was made to launch a new station on 97.7FM. Launch of B98FM A secondary station was launched in July 1991 called B98FM, broadcasting on 97.7FM. The new station shared some programming with 3ZB such as both 3ZB and B98FM had the same breakfast show presented by John Dunne and Ken Ellis. B98FM was a music station originally playing an adult contemporary music format. In 1993 B98FM changed format to an oldies with the brand name Good Time Oldies B98FM, a similar station called Good Time Oldies B90FM was also launched in Wellington which was run in tandem with 2ZB similar to 3ZB and B98FM. 3ZB becomes Newstalk ZB Following the launch of B98FM in 1991 the 3ZB 1098AM station made a move towards a talkback format. Auckland station 1ZB and Wellington 2ZB had also moved to a talkback format and 4ZB Dunedin continued to run a FM music station called ZBFM and a talk station on the original AM frequency. By 1993 Radio New Zealand had moved most of their local AM radio stations around the country to an FM frequency in addition to the original AM frequency. At this point a decision was made to network Auckland's Newstalk 1ZB station across the country utilizing the AM frequencies once used by the local stations. In 1993 3ZB became Newstalk ZB, the station continued to run local talkback programming throughout the day. B98FM becomes Classics Hits B98 In 1993 Radio New Zealand consolidated their local FM stations into a single brand called Classic Hits taking on similar branding to Classic Hits 97FM in Auckland. As part of the rebrand most stations adopted the heritage name into the station, for Goodtime Oldies B98FM the station became known as Classic Hits B98. A similar move was made in Wellington with Goodtime Oldies B90FM in Wellington becoming Classic Hits B90. Unlike other stations rebranded as Classic Hits, the Christchurch and Wellington stations played music from mostly the 1960s and 1970s, originally Classic Hits stations in other markets played music from the 1960s to the 1990s. Change of ownership In July 1996 the New Zealand Government sold off the commercial arm of Radio New Zealand, which included, among other things, the Classic Hits and Newstalk ZB branded stations. The new owner was The Radio Network, a subsidiary of APN News & Media and Clear Channel Communications, which operated as a division of the Australian Radio Network. Around 1996 Classic Hits B98 became Classic Hits 98FM with the station moving towards the same format as the other Classic Hits stations. Unlike other Classic Hits station, local programming was not reduced to just a local breakfast show in 1998 and the station remained live and local 24 hours a day up to 2002. The Classic Hits Christchurch station also ran its own playlist with a Classic rock slant in the early 2000s, the station also ran its own local competitions. Local content was reduced from 2003 onwards and by 2006 the only local show was the breakfast show, as with all other Classic Hits stations at the time. Stations todayNewstalk ZB Christchurch= The original 1098AM frequency used for 3ZB is still used to broadcast Newstalk ZB Christchurch. Since 2011 Newstalk ZB Christchurch can also be heard on 100.1FM. Local content on the station has been reduced over the years, by 2008 local content had been reduced to a local breakfast show presented by John Dunne & Ken Ellis and a morning show presented by Ali Jones. The local breakfast show was dropped following Ellis's departure from the station. The local morning show was also dropped at the end of 2009 with the station losing all local programming except news for a short period in 2010. The local morning show was reinstated in July 2010 due to listeners complaints and a drop in audience. =The Hits 97.7 Christchurch= The Classic Hits brand that B98FM became part of in 1993 was rebranded as The Hits in 2014. Between 2012 and 2013 the Christchurch studios were used to broadcast a nationwide drive show on the Classic Hits network, presented by Jason Gunn and Dave Fitzgerald, in addition to the local breakfast show presented by AJ Funnell, Chloe Emirali and Andy Ellis. On April 28, 2014 all stations part of the Classic Hits network were rebranded as The Hits. A networked breakfast presented by Pauline Gillespie and Grant Kareama was introduced to almost all The Hits stations with the former breakfast announcer moved to present a 6-hour show between 9am and 3pm. At this point local breakfast presenter AJ Funnell began presenting a local show between 9am and 12pm followed by a network show presented by Dave Fitzgerald from the Christchurch studio with separate voice breaks for Christchurch listeners. With Polly and Grant leaving The Hits in 2017 all South Island stations reverted to local breakfast programming. Today Brodie Kane and Dave Fitzgerald present the breakfast show from 6am, followed by network programming from 9am. Studio location The original 3ZB studios were located at 205 Gloucestor Street, the building was also used for other Radio New Zealand stations such as National Radio and 91ZM. Following the arrival of television in New Zealand the National Broadcasting Service converted their existing radio studio buildings for television, the building was used as studios for CHTV3 which eventually became TV ONE. In the 1980s TVNZ and Radio New Zealand used a building on Worcester Street located behind the Gloucestor Street building to produce many of their TV and radio shows. From the 1990s onwards The Radio Network Christchurch stations were housed in the Worcester Street building. Following the devastating earthquake on 22 February 2011, the studio moved temporarily to Riccarton Road, Christchurch. Both stations are now located on a new purpose- built facility on Midas Place, Middleton, Christchurch.

His work focuses on visual cultural studies and the connection between contemporary art and Cold War iconography. He is also the host and consulting producer of the Travel Channel series Lost Secrets. Early life and education Jampol was born in Los Angeles, California in 1978. He graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2000 with a B.A. in History. Jampol attended graduate school at Oxford University where he received a Master of Philosophy in Russian and East European Studies, and a Doctor of Philosophy in Modern History. In addition to his leadership role at The Wende Museum, Jampol is adjunct professor at Claremont Graduate University and a frequent commentator on art as well as East European and Russian design. Career In 2002, at the age of 24, Jampol founded The Wende Museum (“Wende” is a German word that means transition or change) while studying visual culture at Oxford University. Since opening, the museum has become the largest collection of Cold War era artifacts and artwork outside of Europe. The Wende Museum is known for its large-scale and often provocative installations. In 2009, in honor of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, Jampol brought ten segments (24 tons) of the original Wall from Germany, and placed them along Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles, directly across the street from LACMA. At midnight on November 9, 2009, thousands of Angelenos blocked the street to celebrate the monument, which was painted by notable graffiti artists such as Shepard Fairey, RETNA, Heraku, Thierry Noir, and D*Face. In 2013, Jampol's contribution to Jeremy Deller's UK Pavilion at the Venice Biennale sparked controversy through its implication of Russian oligarchs in the corrupt process of privatization following the collapse of the USSR. In 2014, further controversy followed with the publication of a New York Times Op-Ed article written by Jampol on the political crisis in Ukraine and the destruction of Soviet statues. In summer 2014, Jampol co-curated Competing Utopias at the Neutra VDL House in Silver Lake, California, installing three floors of modernist Eastern Bloc design in the former home of California-based architect Richard Neutra. The show was #3 in Hyperallergic's annual \\"Top Ten Exhibitions Across the United States.\\" In fall 2015, Jampol guest-edited a special supplement of The Art Newspaper on Los Angeles art. As Executive Director of the Wende Museum, Jampol oversaw the museum's relocation to a former United States National Guard Armory building in Culver City. A 75-year lease of the armory site was unanimously approved by the City Council of Culver City in November 2012. After renovations, the Wende Museum reopened to the public in its new location in November 2017 with an inaugural exhibition titled Cold War Spaces. In December 2019, Foreign Policy published an article written by Jampol titled \\"Why the Berlin Wall Still Matters.\\" In January 2020, Jampol was appointed as the Los Angeles Chapter President of the Heidelberg Club International. Jampol's writing has been featured in The Atlantic, Foreign Policy, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, and The Times of London. He is a “Notable Alumnus” of UCLA.  Film and TV production  Jampol has produced several films about the Cold War and is a frequent guest on various Travel Channel programs, including Hotel Secrets & Legends (2014) and Mysteries at the Museum (2014). From 2015–2018, he was a guest historian on the Cooking Channel program Food: Fact or Fiction? narrated by Michael McKean. Jampol is the host and consulting producer of the Travel Channel program Lost Secrets, a six-part series that premiered on November 10, 2019.  Publications  In 2014, Jampol published a 904-page encyclopedia of the Wende Museum's East German collection titled Beyond the Wall: Art and Artifacts from the GDR. The book was produced by Benedikt Taschen and published by Taschen Books. It received an overwhelmingly positive review in the New York Times Sunday Book Review. The book was launched on November 9, 2014 to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. In 2019, a smaller second edition of the book, The East German Handbook, was published with text in both English and German.

Coined by the users of Chinese social networks Douban and Weibo in mid-2014, it refers to conservative men who unapologetically upholds traditional patriarchical values and belittles women's movement and gender equality, and are usually nationalistic and variably hostile to foreigners and ethnic minorities. The term originated from mainland China. It became popular in 2015 when scholar Zhou Guoping was accused of having the syndrome after a Weibo post. However in recent years, the use of the term has been accused of misandry and is met with significant backlash on social media with counter-insults like \\"feminist cancer\\" (, the Chinese equivalent of \\"feminazi\\") or \\"feminist whore\\" (, implying Chinese feminists tends to only criticize Chinese men harshly but behave rather warm towards foreign men).

Since men have advantages in physical strength, some occupy positions in the main production sectors and some women are relegated to a secondary position in production.

It was initially introduced in January 1965 by Sir John Pople, , during the Symposium of Atomic and Molecular Quantum Theory in Florida. The Pople Diagram can be either 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional, with the axes representing ab inito methods, basis sets and treatment of relativity. The diagram attempts to balance calculations by giving all aspects of a computation equal weight.  History  John Anthony Pople John Pople first introduced the Pople Diagram during the Symposium on Atomic and Molecular Quantum Theory held on Sanibel Island, Florida, in January 1965. He called it a \\"hyperbola of quantum chemistry\\", which illustrates the inverse relationship between the sophistication of a calculational method and the number of electrons in a molecule that can be studied by that method. Alternative (reverse) arrangement of the vertical axis or interchange of the two axes are also possible.  Three-Dimensional Pople Diagrams  The 2-dimensional Pople diagram describes the convergence of the quantum-mechanical nonrelativistic electronic energy with the size of the basis set and the level of electron correlation included in the wavefunction. In order to reproduce accurate experimental thermochemical properties, secondary energetic contributions have to be considered. The third dimension of the Pople diagram consists of such energetic contributions. These contributions may include: spin–orbit interaction, scalar relativistic, zero- point vibrational energy, and deviations from the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. The three-dimensional Pople diagram (also known as the Csaszar cube.) describes the energy contributions involved in quantum chemistry composite methods.

She was the first woman in Japan to receive a doctoral degree in agriculture. Biography Tsujimura was born in 1888 in what is now Okegawa in Saitama Prefecture. She attended Tokyo Prefecture Women's Normal School, graduating in 1909, and the Division of Science at Tokyo Women's Higher Normal School. There, she was taught by the biologist Kono Yasui, who inspired in Tsujimura an interest in scientific research. She graduated in 1913 and became a teacher at Yokohama High School for Women in Kanagawa Prefecture. In 1917, she returned to Saitama Prefecture to teach at Saitama Women's Normal School. Tsujimura's research career began in 1920 when she joined Hokkaido Imperial University as a laboratory assistant. At the time, the university did not accept female students, so Tsujimura worked in an unpaid position at the Food Nutritional Laboratory of the university's Agricultural Chemistry Department. There, she researched the nutrition of silkworms before transferring to the Medical Chemical Laboratory at the Medical College of Tokyo Imperial University in 1922. The laboratory was destroyed in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, so she transferred to RIKEN as a research student in October 1923. She worked in the laboratory of Umetaro Suzuki, a doctor of agriculture, and researched nutritional chemistry. Tsujimura and her colleague Seitaro Miura discovered vitamin C in green tea in 1924, and published an article titled \\"On Vitamin C in Green Tea\\" in the journal Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry. This finding contributed to an increase in green tea exports to North America. In 1929, Tsujimura isolated the flavonoid catechin from green tea. She extracted tannin in crystal form from green tea in 1930. Her thesis on the constituents of green tea, titled \\"On the Chemical Components of Green Tea\\", earned her a doctorate in agriculture from Tokyo Imperial University in 1932, making her the first woman in Japan to receive such a degree. She went on to isolate gallocatechin from green tea in 1934 and registered a patent on her method of extracting vitamin C crystals from plants in 1935. She was promoted to the role of junior researcher at RIKEN in 1942 and then researcher in 1947 before becoming a professor at Ochanomizu University when it was established in 1949. She was a professor at Tokyo Women's Higher Normal School from 1950 and was the school's first dean of the Faculty of Home Economics. Tsujimura retired from Ochanomizu University as a professor in 1955, but continued lecturing part-time until 1961. She was a professor at Jissen Women's University in Tokyo from 1955 to 1963, when she became a professor emeritus. She was awarded the Japan Prize of Agricultural Science in 1956 for her research on green tea and was conferred the Order of the Precious Crown of the Fourth Class in 1968. She died in Toyohashi on 1 June 1969 at the age of 81.

They hailed from Oak Park, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. Their lineup consisted of Ron Nelson (Ron Lefko) lead guitar and vocals, Stu \\"Hirshfield\\" Howard on guitar and vocals, Marty Lewis on bass, Mark Finn on drums.

Johnston, May 12, 1959, State File No. 135-59-017058, Oklahoma State Department of Health. Certified copy in possession of author.) is an American evangelical Christian pastor, author, and docu-filmmaker. Johnston is currently vice president for Innovation and Strategic marketing at Houston Baptist University in Houston, Texas, and director of Christian Thinkers Society. Johnston and his wife Cristie Jo Huf Johnston are professors of theology and co-producers of a documentary in production about the \\"Nones\\" phenomenon. Early life and education Johnston was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and moved with his family when he was in the third grade to Overland Park in suburban Johnson County, Kansas. As a struggling boy, he contemplated suicide by taking valium but was converted to Jesus Christ in the summer of 1973 at the age of fourteen at a Baptist camp in Roach in Camden County in central Missouri. Within two months, he accepted the call to Christian ministry and was thereafter speaking some twenty-five times weekly to organizations while he was still in high school. Concurrent to Johnston’s senior year in high school, he took courses and graduated from Youth for Christ’s Christ Unlimited Bible Institute, and he ultimately received a General Equivalency Diploma. He was accepted on a scholarship to then named Liberty Baptist College in Lynchburg, Virginia. While at Liberty, Johnston became an \\"associate evangelist\\" for the college. Jerry received his B.A. from Midwestern Baptist College in Kansas City, Missouri, and his Master of Divinity from Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. In May 2012, Johnston and his wife each earned Doctor of Ministry degrees from Acadia Divinity College in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, an entity affiliated with the Convention of Atlantic Baptist Churches. Johnston's doctoral thesis is entitled An Exploration of Rates and Causes of Attrition among Protestant Evangelical Clergy in the United States. In 1998, Johnston delivered Liberty University's baccalaureate speech, and Liberty Baptist Theological Seminary awarded Johnston an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree. Johnston controversially used the title \\"Doctor\\" based on this honorary degree before earning even his undergraduate degree. Career= Evangelism  Through his Jerry Johnston Ministries (JJM), a nonprofit organization, Johnston traveled from 1978 to 1996 across the United States and Canada. His evangelistic crusades were particularly focused on struggling teen issues, including problems with narcotics, suicide, and Satanism. During his full-time evangelism years, Jerry prepared various videos and wrote eight books on these very issues. Among those converted in the Johnston crusade was the Texas evangelist Jay L. Lowder Jr. (born 1966), of Wichita Falls. In 1984, JJM had assets totaling $206,000; by 1990, $383,000; by 1996, $454,000. During these eighteen years, Johnston spoke worldwide to five million people at more than three thousand colleges and universities. He preached revivals in many churches. By 1993, according to his biography, more than 500,000 copies of Johnston's books, 62,000 videos, and a million cassettes of his sermons were in circulation. His sermons have been broadcast worldwide via satellite and web video streaming.  Pastor  Launched in 1996, First Family Church saw exponential growth, and the church broke ground in 1999. The sanctuary was completed at a cost of $10.1 million. Another $8.5 million was spent in 2006 on expanded facilities. The congregation peaked at four thousand members and was described as among the fastest growing churches in America. In 2007, the Kansas City Star reported issues relating to concerns over financial accountability within First Family Church, leading to hundreds of members leaving. In his doctoral dissertation, Johnston attributed the negative media attention to his political conservatism, such as his pro-life convictions and his support for the Kansas constitutional amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage. In 2004, Johnston hosted Jerry Falwell, founder of Liberty University, at First Family Church to rally Christian support in the general election in which then U.S. President George W. Bush narrowly defeated John Kerry. At the gathering, Falwell encouraged pastors to be politically involved in their communities. After the constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage in Kansas passed in 2005, Johnston was highlighted as a proponent of the amendment and openly voiced his opposition to abortion. Journalist Jack Cashill, executive editor of Ingram’s Magazine, agreed with Johnston’s assertions that the pastor was a political media target because of his position as an influential conservative. Tax liens filed by the Internal Revenue Service related to more than $107,000 in unpaid payroll taxes from 2007 were resolved quickly in 2008. The Attorney General of Kansas investigated complaints but no violation of the Kansas Consumer Protection Act was found. A blog reported that Johnston ordered one church member asking for financial records to repent. In September 2011, the church creditor, Regions Financial Corporation, foreclosed on the property. The bank pressed for payment of more than $14 million in outstanding mortgage payments. The elders of the church stated that even while the church was current in its monthly payments, Regions Bank accelerated the mortgage maturity from 30 to five years due to the 2008 banking crisis and demanded the full payment of the loan. The elder board said that AG Financial made a cash offer to Regions Bank to finance First Family Church's mortgage, but Regions Bank rejected the offer. The Blue Valley School District, with plans to use the structure as an early childhood facility, paid $9 million for the 51-acre church complex located at U.S. Highway 69 and 143rd Street in Overland Park. Regions Financial Bank had not yet repaid the 2008 TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program) loan from the federal government when it sold First Family Church’s loan to Blue Valley School District. The bank paid back its $3.5 billion in the spring of 2012. 2011 marked a dramatic increase of church property foreclosures; 138 churches were sold by banks compared to just 24 in 2008. Some of Johnston's relatives also served on staff at First Family Church, making up about ten percent of the ″nearly one hundred employees″ claimed by Johnston. Wife Cristie Jo Huf Johnston, a native of Zeeland in southwestern Michigan, whom he met on an evangelistic tour in the fall of 1978 and wed five months later, was the director of Open Arms & Chesalon Comfort Circles. Their only son, Jeremy Johnston, was the executive pastor and the chief operating officer of the media. The older son-in-law, Christian Newsome, husband of the Johnstons' daughter, Danielle, was the associate pastor of family and youth. Danielle was a contemporary worship leader. The younger son-in-law was the pastor for preteen boys; his wife, Jenilee, the Johnstons' younger daughter, held similar duties for girls. Joyce Johnston, Jerry's mother, was an executive secretary of the church. Christian and Danielle Newsome left First Family Church in 2011 before the bank's foreclosure to begin a new congregation in Lee's Summit in western Missouri. For a year afterward, Johnston was the founding pastor of a second congregation, New Day Church KC, which was located, respectively, in two school buildings in Olathe near Kansas City, Kansas. The church closed in September 2012. The Johnstons were living in Branson, Missouri, rather than Olathe, and a blog claimed that New Day Church paid their commuting expenses each weekend even as the congregation continued to lose money.

It is in close proximity to the Capitol Records Building. Opened on October 15, 1925, it was a popular venue for film, radio, and theatre stars of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. It was converted into a retirement home in the 1970s. History The site was previously occupied by the residence of Jacob Stern. Joseph Stern, the hotel owner, leased the hotel to the Vine Street Hotel and Investment Company, led by Harold Stern. Description Designed by Walker & Eisen in Renaissance Revival style, the hotel was built in 1924 at a cost of US$1 million. The plan was T-shaped and 10 stories in height, of reinforced concrete, ornamental plaster, and stone. There were two garden plazas and a street-level ballroom. The name \\"Plaza\\" appeared on a large neon signboard atop the roof. The lobby, which was modernized after World War II, originally featured an Italian-style coffered ceiling and bronze chandeliers. The hotel's \\"Russian Eagle\\" nightclub was renamed the \\"It Cafe\\" by Clara Bow and her husband, Rex Bell, in 1937. Though Bow promised to appear three times a week at the cafe, her interest gradually waned and the cafe closed in 1943. It later became a coffee shop. The hotel featured vaudeville acts, and during the 1950s, the television game show Queen for a Day set up a live remote broadcast location in the ballroom. Disc jockey Johnny Grant broadcast his daily show from the Hollywood Plaza Bar. Clientele Being located in the vicinity of many broadcast studios, the hotel was popular with radio performers and live theatre actors visiting Los Angeles, including Jackie Gleason, Doris Day, Marilyn Monroe, and Edward Everett Horton, as well as top bandleaders like Harry James, Paul Whiteman, and Hal McIntyre. Bette Davis resided in the hotel with her mother when she arrived in Hollywood in 1930. A fresh contract in hand, Ava Gardner checked into the Hollywood Plaza in 1941, but was forced to move to the cheaper Wilcox Hotel. In the 1940s and 1950s, a barber shop in the basement was frequented by singer Frank Sinatra, who enjoyed playing gin rummy with the barber. Comedian George Burns maintained an office at the top of the hotel in the late 1930s. The silhouette of a hotel seen from the window of Lucy Ricardo's flat in several I Love Lucy episodes is that of the Hollywood Plaza. Notoriety The hotel had its share of notoriety. In 1937 Ern Westmore, released from detainment for a drunk-driving charge, checked into a 10th-floor room and threatened to leap out the window; his brother Frank came to calm him down. That same year, an airline stewardess was found dead in her room. In 1954, an Alaskan woman indicted for the murder of her husband and released on bail committed suicide in her room with an overdose of sleeping pills. In 1959 a woman survived an 8-story fall down the hotel's stairwell. Present day By the early 1970s, the hotel had become derelict. The building was converted into a retirement home. Original palm trees occupy the rear of the building. The building and its neon signboard were designated Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument No. 665 on September 29, 1999.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 for having local significance in the themes of architecture and education. It was nominated as an example of the early schoolhouses built throughout rural Wright County in the late 19th century. It is now vacant. Description District No. 48 School is a simple wood-frame building with clapboard siding. It has a rectangular footprint with a small vestibule at the main entrance topped with a little belfry. Sited on a hill, the building consists of one story over a walk-out basement. Ornamentation is limited to Doric pilasters, fascia boards, and flared window jambs. History The first schools in Wright County were held in rough log cabins or private homes. District No. 48 School was built in 1871, part of a wave of school construction to replace the earlier structures as settlement increased and communities were established. Wright County peaked at having 140 schoolhouses divided into 19 school districts. In the 20th century Wright County's numerous schools were consolidated into fewer, larger schools situated in cities and towns. This was a factor of decreasing rural populations, changing educational requirements at the state level, and higher standards for school facilities. The District No. 48 schoolhouse became the meeting hall for Franklin Township. At the time of its nomination to the National Register in 1979 the building was still in use as a township hall and \\"in an excellent state of maintenance and preservation\\". Township functions have since been relocated, and the building has stood vacant for several years.

For water services, majority of the residents get their supply from the Tarlac Water District. Some residents still rely on the traditional water pump.  Administration  Originally, Sitio Proper was the Barangay San Rafael, until its area expanded. Barangay San Rafael then was being administered by the first Tenyente Del Barrio, Mr. Mariano Feliciano, followed by Mr. Elias Castro, Ponciano Fausto, Rufino Maglalang,Felix Calara, Abelardo Cruz and Benjamin Quinto. Their selection was simply through the raising of hands or \\"Viva Voce\\". Election of Barangay Chairman/Captain came after the first elected chairman Mr. Victorio Soliman, followed by Col. Rodrigo Abono (Ret), Raymundo Dimatulac, Pacifico Gomez, Martin Salamida and now the newly elected Barangay Chairman Hon. Cernan M. Cruz.  Internal administrative structure  The barangay consists of 16 Sitios: # Allied City States # Calle Once # Filomena Subdivision # LJB Subdivision # Northern Hills Subdivision # Sitio Estrella # Sitio Homesite # Sitio Lavista # Sitio Pagasa # Sitio Proper # Sitio Sapang Bulo # Sitio Tarvet # Sitio Valdez # Sta.

Featuring heavy armour and a long range 120 mm rifled gun, the T57 was supposed to serve as a replacement to the M103 in service with American heavy tank units in Europe. Armor on the hull front was to range between 137-203mm in thickness and the turret was to be 152mm at maximum on all sides. Like the French AMX 50 project, it was to feature an oscillating turret and was also to receive a 153mm gun. Experiments were also conducted to look into the possibility of the tank being able to mount a 203mm gun, but this was soon found to be infeasible. When multiple problems were discovered in the turret oscillation system on account of the excess weight of the heavily armored turret and the gun, the project was dropped. Design=Armament The T57 was armed with the 120 mm T179 rifled tank gun, a derivative of the T123E1 gun found on the failed T43 tank. The gun was mounted to the T169 mount located inside the vehicle's oscillating turret, which allowed for a maximum of 15 degrees of gun elevation or -8 degrees of depression by shifting the turret structure up and down rather than the gun itself. The T169 featured a hydrospring gun recoil system. The T179 was able to fire a variety of ammunition, including T284 armor piercing (AP) shells, T308 HEP shells, T275 high explosive (HE) and T309 high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rounds. The AP rounds were tested to be able to penetrate 10.8 inches of homogeneous plate at 2000 yards or 9.8 inches at 1000 yards, while the HEAT round was able to penetrate 16 inches of plate. The T179 was reloaded by an autoloader system that had an estimated firerate of 30 rounds per minute. Due to the large size of the one-piece ammunition, a maximum of 18 rounds were able to be carried. Protection The T57 was well protected for a tank at its time; it featured armour heavier than the M103 heavy tank despite using a hull based on its design. All of the armour of the tank was of cast homogeneous armour. The frontal upper glacis featured upwards of 127 mm of armour sloped at 60 degrees while the lower glacis featured 114.3 mm of armour at 45 degrees. The sides of the vehicles were 76.2 mm thick while the rear was 38.1 to 25.4 mm thick. The oscillating turret was the most armoured section of the vehicle, with a 127 mm plate angled at 60 degrees. The gun mantlet was 254 to 101.6 mm thick at 45 degrees. The sides of the turret were 136 to 69.85 mm thick at 20 to 40 degrees of angling while the rear of the turret was 38.1 mm thick as was the roof of the tank. The belly of the vehicle was 12.7 to 38.1 mm thick. The hull of the vehicle retained the iconic rounded cast steel \\"beak\\" design of the frontal hull seen on both the M103 and M48 tanks. The armour of the T57 was supposed to provide immunity for the vehicle against all existing Soviet anti- tank weapons at the intended engagement ranges of the vehicle. Heavy emphasis was placed on the turret armour due to the intention for the T57 and other NATO heavy tanks to provide long range fire in hull down positions. Propulsion The T57 was powered by a Continental AV1790 12 cylinder air- cooled gasoline engine that could propel the vehicle to a maximum of 35 km/h, a comparable speed to the M103 tank which utilised the same engine. This was however far slower than medium tanks at the time such as the M48 and Soviet T-54/T-55, which could easily reach 40–50 km/h of speed. A significant downside of the T57 was its very low range of 80 miles or 130 km due to its very inefficient engine, a similar issue that had also befallen the M103. History The T57 project was commenced on 12 October 1951 to design a 120 mm armed tank with an oscillating turret and autoloader. The initial design of the autoloader was cylindrical, however this was rejected by the Army Field Forces because such a design would take up an enormous space inside the turret bustle and limit round capacity to a maximum of 11. The Rheem Manufacturing Company was contracted to design and produce two pilot vehicles. However, the T57 was never completed and only two turrets were constructed, with both being mounted on T43 hulls for trials. On January 17 the US Ordinance Committee cancelled the project with both turrets scrapped and the hulls returned to a supply depot for future usage. Another project arose with the T77 120mm Gun Tank, which planned to mount the T57 turret to a M48 Patton tank hull, which was never completed. The failure of the T57 has been attributed to shifting doctrines in tank design at the time, with American designers progressing to the modern concept of main battle tanks that combined the mobility of medium tank, armour and firepower of a heavy tank in a lighter package, rendering heavy tanks obsolete.

It was written by Michael Grassi and Rachel Shuker, and directed by Dermott Downs. The episode centers on Kara taking on Reactron, who has come to National City to seek revenge on Superman by killing Supergirl, while at the same time take on Cat's plans to do an exposé on Supergirl. Plot Cat interviews Supergirl, asking uncompromising questions about the timing of her appearance and her relationship to Superman, causing Kara to accidentally reveal he is her cousin; this fact makes the news the next day. Cat writes an exposé on Supergirl, painting her as having all the stereotypical negative traits of a millennial, which Alex and Hank are not pleased about. Supergirl is attacked by Reactron, a disfigured man in nuclear-powered armor. Kara manages to damage his armor but he escapes. The DEO refuse to act against him because he is not an alien threat. Winn and James build a high-tech lab in a disused CatCo. office to use as a base of operations. At Lord Technologies, Reactron storms in looking for someone who can repair his suit. Maxwell offers himself in place of another scientist, and Reactron takes him hostage. Kara and the DEO discover Reactron is Ben Krull, who worked in a nuclear reactor where Superman prevented a meltdown, managing to save everyone except Krull’s wife. Blaming Superman for her death, Krull created the Reactron armor to seek revenge, targeting Supergirl to hurt Superman. Kara goes to Reactron's hideout, where Reactron overpowers her before she is saved by Superman. When she recovers, Kara is angry that James called in Clark to help her, and asks him to leave. At the launch party for the Supergirl issue of CatCo magazine, Kara shares a dance with James and they begin to reconcile, but Reactron breaks in searching for Supergirl. Kara saves Maxwell and Winn, while James distracts Reactron. She learns Reactron is powerless without his power core, which needs to be encased in lead to prevent a meltdown. Kara saves James, then melts a lead statue and coats her hand to extract the core. At CatCo, Kara overhears James’ conversation with his ex-fiancé Lucy Lane, and believes Lucy wants to resume their relationship. Kara receives an apology text from Clark, and Alex reads the article on Supergirl, telling Kara that Cat was impressed. Reception=Ratings The episode attracted 1,045,000 viewers for its British premiere, making it the 2nd most watched programme on Sky One for the week. Critical response Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly notes in his assessment of the review, \\"Every week, Supergirl seems intent on addressing its critics and naysayers. This scene here is its explanation for why Superman isn’t a stronger presence on the show. Supergirl, like Kara, is intent on proving that it can stand on its own and doesn’t need Superman to make people interested in it.\\"\\"Supergirl: Fight or Flight\\" from Entertainment Weekly (November 9, 2015) Cliff Wheatley of IGN gave the episode a 7.2, saying, Supergirl's third episode leaves the Kryptonian villains behind and instead focuses on Supergirl's desire to prove herself. It's a good episode that takes a few too many missteps with James and gives a lot of screen time to an unlikable Maxwell Lord, but it also goes to great lengths to endear us to Winn – a character that's been underserved thus far – and give Supergirl some real solid internal drama to wrestle with. Caroline Siede of The A.V. Club gave the episode a positive review, giving it a B+. In her assessment of the episode: \\"To put it frankly, I don’t think Supergirl needed to address Superman as directly as it does tonight. The showrunners clearly think the Man Of Steel looms large over viewers’ expectations of the series, but I’m not actually sure that's the case. Had the show simply mentioned Superman in the pilot and then moved on I don’t think viewers would have been particularly upset (outside of the usual “Why isn’t the hero from one city helping the hero in another?” complaints that get lodged against every connected universe). But Supergirl clearly wants to clear the air when it comes to Superman, and all things considered I think they do that fairly well. If the concept of bringing Superman into this universe is a little shaky, at least the execution mostly works. \\" Stacy Glanzman of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.5 out of 5 stars.\\"Supergirl Season 1 Episode 3 Review: Fight or Flight\\" from TV Fanatic (November 9, 2015) ReferencesExternal links * 2015 American television episodes Supergirl (TV series) episodes ","title":"Fight or Flight (Supergirl)"},{"id":"48512804","text":"Navrang Lal Tibrewal (born 17 January 1937 in Jhunjhunu district, Rajasthanis an Indian judge and former acting Governor of Rajasthan.Navrang Lal Tibrewal former Governor of Rajasthan He has also served as the acting Chief Justice of the Rajasthan High Court.

As one of the few Hong Kong schools with over a hundred years of history, it aims at nurturing young women to \\"speak confidently and think critically in bilingual learning environment\\". Pooi To Middle School is located at 2 Inverness Road, Kowloon City, Hong Kong. In 2006, it was temporarily relocated to 101 Castle Peak Road, Sham Shui Po. The school has moved back to the current location on 18 March 2009, after the new campus was constructed.  History  Missionary Emma Young, sent by Southern Baptist Convention based in USA, set up ‘Pooi To Academy’ in Guangzhou. Most women in Hong Kong at that time didn’t have the chance to learn about Christianity. Also, they didn’t have the opportunity to receive education, as the society was dominated by the ancient Chinese thinking that women should not be educated. Only five people enrolled in the first lesson on 3 March 1888. In 1907, the school was relocated to Dongshan, Canton. Later in 1918, Pooi To Kindergarten, Primary School, Secondary School and Elementary Teacher Training School were established. Pooi To Academy was registered in 1930, and from then onwards it was managed by local Chinese. Ms Chan Yuen-so was appointed as principal in the same year. In 1937(during World War II), an air raid occurred in Guangzhou after Lugouqiao Incident. Teachers and students fled to Zhaoqing where the school was reopened on 27 September 1937. By that time the number of students had increased greatly to 75. One year later, in 1938, the school was relocated again to Kwong Wah Street in Hong Kong. In 1941, the school collaborated with Pui Ching Secondary School to set up Pooi To Joint Secondary School in Ping Shek, Hong Kong. However, Hong Kong was occupied by the Japanese a year later, and Pooi To Middle School was then moved to Macau. In 1945, war ended, Pooi To Middle School was reopened in Dongshan, Guangzhou. On the other hand, in September, a Hong Kong branch school was set up. In 1946, the Hong Kong branch was officially renamed as Hong Kong Pooi To Girls’ School. Again, it was relocated to No. 37 Grampian Road, Kowloon City, where the campus was shared by primary and secondary school students. In 1952, the school successfully applied for the land in 2-8 Inverness Road to build a new campus, which was later officially opened by Madam Grantham (Maurine Samson, wife of Hong Kong Governor, Sir Alexander Grantham) on the opening ceremony. In 1959, a new building - ‘The Seventieth Anniversary Memorial Hall’ was constructed. Later in 1984, ‘Pooi To Corridor’ was built to link between the Main Hall and Memorial Hall. Pooi To Middle School adopted the 5-year New Academic Structure in 1961. Four years later, in 1965, students sat for HKCEE (Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination) and the passing rate was 95%. In 1975, Pooi To Middle School gradually became an Aided Secondary School.  School Song  The school song is basically the same with the one of Guangzhou No.7 Middle School. However, Pooi To Middle School only takes the third verse as their school song. It is sung in Putonghua. The school song is a reminder for all students that no matter what happens, they should stay strong and keep the school motto -\\"Love, Integrity, Purity and Perseverance\\" in mind. \\"培道同學兮，愛誠貞毅。 四德俱備兮，無往而畏。 當茲社會兮，釜鳴而螗沸。 毋惶毋惑兮，毋悲毋歔欷。 培道同學兮，記取愛誠貞毅\\"  School motto  \\"Love, Integrity, Purity and Perseverance\\" is the school motto of Pooi To Middle School. The school aims at nurturing students to become loving, honest, pure and persevering girls. The school also hopes that students could keep these qualities as their future goals, even after they graduated from school.  House  Unlike the other schools in Hong Kong, Pooi To Middle School runs a \\"one form-one house\\" system in which a form of students is grouped as one house only, i.e. each grade level works together in all inter-school competitions. Therefore, there will be a new house every year. The Chinese name of the house must include the ‘山(shan)’ ‘日(ri)’ ‘羽(yu)’.  Campus  The campus of Pooi To Middle School has an area of about 15512 m². After completion of construction works in 2009, the campus now has four building(A to D). The facilities include : * 30 classrooms * 3 small group teaching classrooms * Student Activity Centre * Meeting room * Staff room * Hall * Lecture theatre * Gymnasium * Library * Basketball court * Green garden * School's History Gallery * Dancing room * Canteen  School emblem, and badge = School emblem  The four-leaf clover in the middle of the school emblem symbolizes love, faith, hope and blessing. It encourages students to cherish the grace and love of God, and to build an energetic life with faith and hope from God.  School badge  The school badge is composed of three colours: red, yellow and blue. Each colour conveys a different symbolic meaning - red represents passion and bravery; yellow represents energy and gentleness; blue represents rationality and calmness.  Achievements = Academic  In the 2015 HKDSE (Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education), students of Pooi To Middle School achieved remarkable results. The percentages of number of students achieving level 2 in 15 subjects were higher than the overall average of Hong Kong. Also, 100% pass was achieved in 8 subjects (including English Language, Mathematics Module II, History, BAFS(Accounting), BAFS(Business), Economics, Chemistry and Visual Arts).  Extra-curricular Activities  Students of Pooi To Middle School also have outstanding performance on different extra-curricular activities, For example, students have achieved great results in Inter-school Athletics Competition, including: * Inter-School Athletics Competition - (Group A Team) 2nd runner-up * Inter-School Athletics Competition - (Group B Team) 3rd runner-up * Inter-School Athletics Competition - (Overall) 4th runner-up * Inter-School Swimming Competition - (Group A 4x50 Free-Style Relay) 2nd runner-up  Language policy  Pooi To Middle School is a CMI school (Chinese as Medium of Instruction School) which focuses on Bilingual (Chinese and English) education. By applying such strategy, the school aims to let students learn better, as Chinese is the mother language of students. Still, students’ English subject results are comparable to, or even better than students from EMI schools (English as Medium of Instruction School). Pooi To Middle School has been acknowledged by the Hong Kong Education Bureau of its mastery of bilingual education.  Curriculum  The school implements Bilingual education policy.

In a wayang kulit performance, the puppet figures are rear-projected on a taut linen screen with a coconut-oil (or electric) light. The dalang (shadow artist) manipulates carved leather figures between the lamp and the screen to bring the shadows to life. It's mainly about good vs evil. Wayang kulit is one of the many different forms of wayang theatre found in Indonesia; the others include wayang beber, wayang klitik, wayang golek, wayang topeng, and wayang wong. Wayang kulit is among the best known, offering a unique combination of ritual, lesson and entertainment. Today, it is spread out, in various forms and guises, across Asia - from Turkey and China to Thailand and Malaysia. On November 7, 2003, UNESCO designated wayang kulit from Indonesia as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.  Etymology  Gunungan in Javanese wayang kulit performance, marked the opening and the separations between scenes. The perforated wayang creates exquisite shadow. The term wayang is the Javanese word for \\"shadow\\"Mair, Victor H. Painting and Performance: Picture Recitation and Its Indian Genesis. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1988. p. 58. or \\"imagination\\". Its equivalent in Indonesian is bayang. In modern daily Javanese and Indonesian vocabulary, wayang can refer to the puppet itself or the whole puppet theatre performance. Kulit means \\"skin\\" or \\"leather\\", the material from which the figures are carved.  History  Hinduism arrived in Indonesia from India before the Islamic and Christian era. Sanskrit became the literary and court language of Java and later of Bali. Wayang kulit was later assimilated into local culture with changes to the appearance of the characters to resemble cultural norms. When Islam began spreading in Indonesia, the display of God or gods in human form was prohibited, and thus this style of shadow play was suppressed. King Raden Patah of Demak, Java, wanted to see the wayang in its traditional form, but failed to obtain permission from Muslim religious leaders. Religious leaders attempted to skirt the Muslim prohibition by converting the wayang golek into wayang purwa made from leather and displayed only the shadow instead of the puppets themselves.Inna Solomonik. \\"Wayang Purwa Puppets: The Language of the Silhouette\\". Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde, 136 (1980), no: 4, Leiden, pp. 482-497. The Malaysian version of wayang kulit was derived from the Thai version, with partial Javanese influences. Wayang puppet figures The puppet figures of a Javanese wayang kulit The wayang comes in sizes from 25 cm to 75 cm. The important characters are usually represented by several puppets each. The wayang is usually made out of water buffalo hide and goat hide and mounted on bamboo sticks. However, the best wayang is typically made from young female buffalo parchment, cured for up to ten years. The carving and punching of the rawhide, which is most responsible for the character's image and the shadows that are cast, are guided by this sketch. A mallet is used to tap special tools, called tatah, to punch the holes through the rawhide. Making the wayang sticks from horn is a complicated process of sawing, heating, hand-molding, and sanding until the desired effect is achieved. When the materials are ready, the artist attaches the handle by precisely molding the ends of the horn around the individual wayang figure and securing it with thread. A large character may take months to produce. There are important differences between the three islands where wayang kulit is played (due to local religious canon): Claire Holt.

Dumont Taschenbuecher. * In Java (where Islam is predominant), the puppets (named ringgit) are elongated, the play lasts all night and the lamp (named blencong) is, nowadays, almost always electric. A full gamelan with (pe)sinden is typically used.James R. Brandon. On Thrones of Gold, Javanese Shadow Plays. Harvard University Press. * In Bali (where Hinduism is predominant), the puppets look more real, the play lasts a few hours and, if at night, the lamp uses coconut oil. Music is mainly by the four gender wayang, with drums only if the story is from the Ramayana. There are no sinden. The dalang does the singing. Balinese dalangs are often also priests (amangku dalang). As such, they may also perform during daylight, for religious purposes (exorcism), without lamp and without screen (wayang sakral, or \\"lemah\\")Religion in Bali, by C. Hooykaas, University of Leiden * In Lombok (where Islam is predominant and Bali's influence is strong), vernacular wayang kulit is known as wayang sasak, with puppets similar to Javanese ringgits, a small orchestra with no sinden, but flutes, metallophones and drums. The repertoire is unique to the island and is based on the Muslim Menak Cycle (the adventures of Amir Hamzah). In the gallery below, the Mahabharata character shown in all pictures except the last is Kresna.

Wayang kulit played by children in Jakarta. The stage of a wayang performance includes several components. A stretched linen canvas (kelir) acts as a canvas, dividing the dalang (puppeteer) and the spectator. A coconut-oil lamp (Javanese blencong or Balinese damar) – which in modern times is usually replaced with electric light – casts shadows onto the screen. A banana trunk (Javanese gedebog, Balinese gedebong) lies on the ground between the screen and the dalang, where the figures are stuck to hold them in place. To the right of the dalang sits the puppet chest, which the dalang uses as a drum during the performance, hitting it with a wooden mallet. In a Javanese wayang kulit performance, the dalang may use a cymbal-like percussion instrument at his feet to cue the musicians. The musicians sit behind the dalang in a gamelan orchestra setting. The gamelan orchestra is an integral part of the Javanese wayang kulit performance. The performance is accompanied by female singers (pesinden) and male singers (wirasuara). The setting of the banana trunk on the ground and canvas in the air symbolizes the earth and the sky; the whole composition symbolizes the entire cosmos. When the dalang animates the puppet figures and moves them across the screen, divine forces are understood to be acting in his hands with which he directs the happening. The lamp is a symbol of the sun as well as the eye of the dalang.Kathy Foley: \\"My Bodies: The Performer in West Java\\". TDR, Vol. 34, No. 2, Summer 1990, pp. 62–80, here p. 75f. A traditional wayang kulit performance begins after dark. The first of the three phases, in which the characters are introduced and the conflict is launched, lasts until midnight. The battles and intrigues of the second phase last about three hours. The third phase of reconciliation and friendship is finished at dawn.Constantine Korsovitis: \\"Ways of the Wayang\\". India International Centre Quarterly, Vol. 28, No. 2 (\\"The Everyday, the Familiar and the Bizarre\\") Summer 2001, pp. 59–68, here p. 60. Wayang shadow plays are usually tales from the two major Hindu epics, the Ramayana and Mahabharata. The puppet master contextualizes stories from the plays, making them relevant to current community, national or global issues. Gamelan players respond to the direction of the dalang.

It is located 22 km from the state capital Chennai. Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple was built during the 11th century by Chola king Kulothunga Chola II. Shiva is worshipped as Othandeeswarar and his consort Parvathi as Kulirvithanayaki. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines. The temple has a five-tiered rajagopuram, the gateway tower. The Vijayanagar and Vijayanagar kings made further expansion to the temple during the 16th century. The temple is open from 6 am - 11:30 am and 4:30 - 8:00 pm on all days. Four daily rituals and many yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the Brahmotsavamfestival during the Tamil month of Panguni (March - April) and Sani Peyarchi (transit of planet Saturn) being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend temple tank and the tower As per another legend, Chola king Kulothunga Chola II was hunting in the forest and while returning from Thirumullaivasal, found a blockade on his way. He tried to remove it using his sword and found blood stain in it. He later found that it emanated from the image of lingam (an iconic form of Shiva) in the place. The king wanted to expiate his sin of cutting the image and cut his hand. Shiva was pleased with the devotion and appeared to him at this place as Othandeeswarar along with his consort Parvathi as Kulirvithanayaki. Othandeeswarar also restored the hand of Kulothunga Chola and hence got the name Kai Thantha Piran. The presiding deity at the temple is still believed to have a scar on it. As per another legend, since the presiding deity relieves the devotees off their curses and impinges strength the deity is also called Manuanukuleeswarar. History The temple has many inscriptions from the Chola period during the 11th century. Kulothunga Chola II is believed to have built the temple and the shrines in the current form. Historians believe that the shrine of Vishnu seems to be a later addition. Sengunda Mudaliyars built many shrines in the temple and refurbished the tank. The Vijayanagara kings, who ruled the region, have done benevolent endowments to the temple. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Architecture Othandeeswarar temple has a seven- tiered rajagopuram, the gateway tower piercing the rectangular granite walls around the temple. The presiding deity Othandeeswarar, in the form of Lingam is housed in the sanctum. The sanctum is approached from the main entrance through the flag staff hall, Maha mandap and Artha mandap. The flag staff is located in the flagstaff hall axial to the sanctum. An image of Nandi faces the main shrine in the Maha Mandapa. There are shrines of Vinayaka, Muruga before the Mahamandap and the sanctum is guarded by Dwarapalas. The shrine of Kulirvithanayaki is located in the second precinct. The temple has a shrine of Nataraja (dancing form of Shiva) and his consort Sivakami facing each other. The vimana, structure over the sanctum is in the form of Gajabrushta, the shape of an elephant in its sitting posture. Vinayaka in the temple is called Prasanna Vinayaga. There is a shrine for Vishnu in the second precinct. There also shrines of Shani, Vrusabha Nayaka, Durga, Chandikeswara, Dakshninamurthy and Navagraha around the sanctum. Festival The various shrines of the temple The temple follows Saivite tradition. The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Shaivaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Kalasanthi at 8:30 a.m., Uchikalam at 11:30 p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., and Sayaratchai between 8:00  8:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Othandeeswarar and Kulirvithanayaki. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The temple is open from 6am - 11:30 am and 4-8:30 pm on all days.

Priority seats can be found on various public transportation, including the mass transit railways, buses, minibuses, and trams. The slogan \\"Please offer your seat to anyone in need\\" is often displayed beside the seat. The elderly, disabled, pregnant, and injured have priority to take these seats. In most cases, there is no regulation (English version: LCQ5: Priority seats and barrier-free facilities provided by public transport modes) to restrict the use of priority seats, but people are expected to offer their seats to those in need. Background Under the principle of \\"Barrier Free Environment\\", the idea of \\"priority seats\\" was first introduced in northern Europe . Providing unimpeded, effortless access and ideal living environment to all people is the final goal. Over the past centuries, the idea of priority seats spread to Asian countries such as Japan, Taiwan and Korea. These three are the most significant examples, owing to their cultural emphasis on politeness that teaches the younger generation to offer seats to the elderly. Failing to do so would be regarded as disrespectful. Countries such as Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and China have similar traditions. In addition, railways in some countries – for instance the Southern and Great Northern routes in England – allow qualifying passengers to apply for and obtain priority seat cards which they can show to fellow passengers to prove their eligibility. Objectives Priority seats motivate people to offer seats to people with special need. Taking the initiative to give seats to them can prevent them from accidents when travelling on public transports. According to the Press Release of The Kowloon Motor Bus in 2011, priority seats are designed to provide people with special need a safe and enjoyable journey. Such passengers, including the elderly and people with mobility obstacles, may face special inconvenience and difficulties during travelling. Introducing priority seats encourages individuals to bear the social responsibility of caring for others in need. According to the Press Release of The Kowloon Motor Bus in 2011, promotion of priority seats aims to enhance the awareness of offering seats to the people with special need so as to cultivate a culture of care. The motion encourages people to be sensitive about other people's needs and take actions of empathy and altruism. In different localities The \\"yield the seat culture\\" has been around for many years in various countries in the world, but different countries have great relations because of their nationality, education policy, and public order.  Australia  Priority seats on public transport are an aspect of Australian culture. It is expected in Australian culture for students with state-sponsored transport passes, who usually attend schools outside of their local area, to give up their seats to paying passengers, who are usually working adults, local residents, etc. It is considered polite to give up seats to the elderly, though many young people do not expressly follow this custom. In Melbourne, passengers who do not concede their seats to standing passengers with special needs, when asked to do so, will be fined AUD $147.61.  Hong Kong In Hong Kong, Priority seats were first introduced in the MTR in 2009 with the \\"Priority Seats Campaign\\". The Smiley World Characters, large red stickers with big smiley faces, were stuck on the top of the priority seats so as to attract people’s attention. After the setup of priority seats in MTR, bus companies started to follow. Priority seats were introduced to the Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) in May 2011, and then followed by Citybus and New World First Bus (NWFB) in June 2012. In accordance with the press releases, the KMB first introduced priority seats to 87 of their buses. In each bus, several priority seats were located at the front of the lower deck. The headrests of such seats are in green with words of \\"PRIORITY SEAT\\" and symbols of elderly, handicapped, pregnant women, and people with infants or young children to help passengers identify them. Advertisements were also broadcast in order to raise the awareness of passengers to offer seats. Receiving positive and supportive feedback after the 6-month trial, in the year 2012, the KMB decided to have priority seats set up in all of its buses and the headrests of such seats were changed into dark purple. According to press releases from the government, for the minibus, priority seat is provided at the first single seat near the door. And for the tram, there are a few priority seats offered near the driver in the lower deck. Also, there is priority seating offered by the Cathay Pacific airline, for passengers with disabilities. But since other transportations such as taxi and ferry which usually do not allow standing, there are no specifically designated priority seats.  South Korea  Korean culture strongly recommends reserving seats for the elderly. Even if the entire car is overcrowded, the elder seat will be empty. Seoul Metropolitan Government announced that it will apply new design for pregnant women at Seoul Subway lines 2 and 5. Seoul Metropolitan Government expects that the change could allow passengers to yield their seats to pregnant women more easily. In order to help people recognize that the seat is for the pregnant women, the seat will change its color into pink from the back of the seat with a note that says ‘This is the seat for a future protagonist’ written on the bottom.  Taiwan  thumb In Taiwan, priority seats are installed on public transportation. Some banks, airports, or hospital elevators will also mark the icons that are given priority to the elderly and the weak women and children, and have signs to that effect. Taiwanese children are also taught to give up priority seats. A Yield the seat' culture is deeply rooted, and even become a reflex action. The priority seat system in Taiwan originated in the Republic of China in the late 1940s or early 1950s. At that time, there were many consecutive accidents in which elderly people boarded a bus and accidentally fell. Therefore, the Taipei City Government began to plan to set up a priority seat on the bus. On major transportation vehicles, it is provided for those with mobility difficulties or needs. In the 2010s, the media have reported on disputes and controversies about priority seats, leading everyone to choose to stand, as no one was willing to sit on the priority seat. With the popularization of smartphones and social platforms, \\"social justice warriors\\" have sometimes tried to dox the passengers sitting in priority seats, uncovering their identity.  United Kingdom  In British culture, leaving the seat to the people who need it most can fully interpret their yield the seat culture. It is completely normal for elderly people in the UK to give seats to students and youth.  United States  In American culture, the elderly and the pregnant are regarded as \\"ordinary people\\" without seat priorities, but children are regarded as a group that needs to be seated. It is normal for an elderly person to give a seat to a child. Controversies and disputes There are two major controversies regarding priority seats. First of all, people think that only people in need can sit on the priority seats. Even if the train is full, priority seats are still left empty. This situation is common in Taiwan and Hong Kong. People, especially young people, are not willing to sit on the train as they are afraid of being morally criticized, scolded or even cyberbullied (like uploading their scenes of occupying priority seats to social networking websites which is sometimes not the truth). However, the priority seats are first-come-first-served. Priority seats are designed to promote the culture of offering seats to the needy. If there are no needy on the public transport, people are free to sit on the priority seats. Also, many passengers currently have little awareness of offering seats to people in need. They pretend not to notice other passengers in greater need for a seat. This situation is more common in China. People seated on priority seats refuse to move for people in greater need for a seat (the issue of cyberbullying mentioned in the previous paragraph is common due to such refusal). Some suggest mandating the offer of seats to people in need by law just like some cities in the United States, Canada and Australia. But according to press release published by HKSAR government, the government would like to promote such an act through the advocacy of a culture of courtesy rather than through legal means. Other related information Some disabilities are more unfamiliar and uneasily recognized. The Toronto Transit Commission reminds everyone of the possibility that people who refuse to offer their seat may have a hidden disability that is either not likely to be recognized or a disability that is uncomfortable to discuss in public. Legislation In some jurisdictions, priority seating is mandated by legislation. The Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005 in Ontario, Canada stipulates that all transport providers must provision \\"clearly marked courtesy seating for persons with disabilities [...] located as close as practicable to the entrance door of the vehicle\\".

Vietnam War Lt Col Cheatham served as commander of the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines during the Vietnam War. On 2 February 1968 Cheatham was at Phu Bai Combat Base when he was ordered into Huế to take command of his companies already engaged in the Battle of Hue. Before leaving for Huế, Cheatham reviewed Marine urban fighting doctrine which recommended staying off the streets and moving forward by blasting through walls and buildings. He proceeded to gather the necessary equipment including M20 Bazookas, M40 106mm recoilless rifles mounted on M274 Mules, C-4 explosive, flamethrowers, tear gas and gas masks. This equipment was loaded onto a convoy which arrived at the MACV Compound at 1pm on 3 February, Cheatham then joined his Company commanders in Huế University and they proceeded to develop the tactics to be used in recapturing southern Huế. Cheatham led his forces as they methodically cleared the Viet Cong and People's Army of Vietnam forces from the western area of southern Huế. He was awarded the Navy Cross for his heroism leading 2/5 Marines during the battle. His Navy Cross citation reads: \\"The President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Cross to as Colonel [then Lieutenant Colonel] Ernest C. Cheatham, Jr. (MCSN: 0-58120), United States Marine Corps, for extraordinary heroism while serving as Commanding Officer of the Second Battalion, Fifth Marines, FIRST Marine Division (Reinforced)\\", Fleet Marine Force, in the Republic of Vietnam from 3 February to 3 March 1968. \\"During Operation Hue City, Colonel Cheatham led his battalion in extremely heavy house-to-house fighting against a numerically superior North Vietnamese Army force. Advancing through the city on 4 February to assault the well-fortified Treasury Building/Post Office complex, his unit came under intense fire from concealed enemy positions. The enemy resistance halted the Marines' advance during two days of bitter fighting. Nevertheless, Colonel Cheatham remained steadfast in his determination to secure the enemy stronghold. Skillfully deploying a 106-mm. recoilless rifle squad into advantageous firing positions, he personally pinpointed the targets with M-16 tracer rounds and directed accurate fire on the enemy, which significantly reduced the pressure on his assaulting force. Completely disregarding his own safety, he joined the assaulting unit and aggressively led his men in routing the North Vietnamese from their entrenched positions. While proceeding through the city on 6 February, he organized his battalion for an assault on the enemy-held Provincial Headquarters Building. Ignoring the hostile fire all around him, he directed his men to covered positions while he fearlessly advanced to an exposed position from which he could locate the sources of enemy fire. Calling an M50 Ontos forward, he directed effective suppressive fire on the enemy and then courageously led his unit as it continued the assault. Colonel Cheatham's dynamic and heroic leadership and his unflagging example inspired all who observed him and contributed greatly to the defeat of the enemy and to their subsequent withdrawal from the city. His dauntless courage and unfaltering devotion to duty upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.\\" Post Vietnam He was promoted to Colonel in 1973 and Brigadier general in 1977. He served as the Commanding General, Landing Force Training Command, Atlantic and Commanding General, 4th Marine Amphibious Brigade. He was promoted to Major general in 1981 and on 13 August 1982 assumed command of the 1st Marine Division from MajGen James L. Day. He would command the division until 13 June 1985. He served as the Commanding General 1st Marine Amphibious Force, Camp Pendleton, California. He was promoted to Lieutenant general in June 1985 and served as Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower at Headquarters Marine Corps until his retirement in January 1988. In 1987 Cheatham was considered as a potential successor to replace General Paul X. Kelley as Commandant of the Marine Corps, however LtGen Alfred M. Gray Jr. was ultimately selected.

HKOW) is a tall Ferris wheel located at the Central Harbourfront, Central, Hong Kong. It has 42 gondolas including one VIP Gondola with leather seats and a clear glass bottom floor. All gondolas are equipped with air conditioners and communication systems. Each ride included two to three spins and takes about 15 minutes. Each gondola can seat a maximum of eight people, other than the VIP Gondola which can seat 5 people. It is currently operated by The Entertainment Corporation Limited (TECL). TECL has officially partnered with AIA Group, to present the AIA Vitality Park as part of the attraction. Background leftIn May 2013 the Lands Department of Hong Kong leased 9,620 square metres of land between Central Pier No. 9 and Pier No. 10. for the attraction. It is situated on the Central and Wan Chai Reclamation overlooking Victoria Harbour in Hong Kong. 90% of the site surrounding the wheel is accessible to the public with food and beverages available for purchase. Also, live entertainments are held at the event plaza throughout the year, which is suitable for all ages. The wheel is designed to suit Hong Kong’s climate and weather. It is built within the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department and TUV standards.Task Force on Harbourfront Developments on Hong Kong Island The wheel has had two owners. The previous owner was Swiss AEX and the current owner is The Entertainment Corporation Limited (TECL). In 2014, Swiss AEX expected 1 million riders per annum which is approximately aimed at an average of 2,740 passengers daily. After the ownership transfer in 2017, TECL announced that they have achieved 1 million riders in less than 7 months since the opening.  Ownership  International Finance Centre The Ferris wheel was first presented by Swiss AEX, a company who claims their experience in Ferris wheel operations for more than a decade in their proposal contract. Swiss AEX had partnered with Hong Kong Telecom (HKT). In 2017, the government awarded the second term of operating contract to The Entertainment Corporation Limited (TECL) which was set to commence in September 2017. TECL then issued a statement saying it will “offer a substantially lower ticket price per ride”. The wheel closed to the public in August, when the dispute over transfer of its ownership resulted in a deadlock between the original and new operators. The Secretary for Development stated the wheel could be dismantled and closed for 2 years until a replacement is built by TECL. Swiss AEX, the former owner of the wheel, described the company “with no experience of operating observation wheels whatsoever”. On 6 September 2017, a deal was struck between TECL & Swiss AEX which saved the wheel from demolition. In November 2017, TECL announced that the wheel will be re-opened to public on 20 December 2017 as part of the new AIA Vitality Park, with a range of health and wellness-related events, attractions and activities organised nearby. Controversy The government's decision to build a Ferris wheel here was controversial.Hong Kong Observation Wheel at night, August 2018 Some questioned the necessity of building such a tourist attraction, considering it seemed useless since the view is easily affected by varying weather conditions. The chairman of the Harbourfront Commission, Nicholas Brooke, showed support of this development project in the interview. However, the Harbourfront Commission has no executive power so the controversy continues. Apart from that, although the contract to operate this sightseeing spot was awarded in 2013, the project was delayed several times. There were many complaints from the public about the lack of promotion and information. Security has also been controversial after the release of a photo taken by one daredevil climber showing himself sitting on the top of the wheel. This picture was taken down before the opening day of the wheel to the public. It has brought the security concerns of wheel into the limelight.

It was built by brothers Doug, Theodore and Nicholas Froebe in the 1930s. Marker near Homewood, Manitoba The machine was constructed on a custom- made steel tubular frame using spare parts and equipment from automobiles, farm machinery and elsewhere. Fitted with a de Havilland Gipsy aero engine, it had twin concentric contra-rotating rotors of stainless steel tubing with fabric covering and with full cyclic and collective pitch control. The 98 hp available from the engine proved inadequate, but several test flights were made, the machine showing severe vibration. Work was then interrupted by the outbreak of the Second World War. The helicopter was stored in a granary and forgotten. A later generation of the Froebe family rediscovered it and donated it to the Royal Aviation Museum of Western Canada. Development The Froebe family moved from Chatsworth, Illinois to the Homewood area in 1921. In 1927, the Froebe brothers (Nicolas, Theodore and Douglas) purchased and assembled a Heath Parasol fixed-wing aircraft kit and learned to fly. They later purchased and restored another fixed-wing aircraft and flew it until 1933, when it was damaged. In the winter of 1936–1937, the brothers traveled to Oakland, California to learn about rotary-wing aircraft and commenced construction of their own helicopter in 1937. The first short test flight was carried out on December 20, 1938. Vibration problems and bearing failures occurred after only a few more hours of test flights of up to five feet in altitude and 50 feet distance, so experiments were discontinued in early 1939. Theodore Froebe was killed in the crash of a Heath Parasol in 1943, and Nicolas died in 1959 while crop dusting.

European Union Data Retention Directive (2007–14)  As a member of the European Union, the United Kingdom is subject to EU policies and directives on surveillance and participates in its programmes. Since October 2007 telecommunication companies have been required to keep records of phone calls and text messages for twelve months under the European Union's Data Retention Directive. Though all telecoms firms already keep data for a period, the regulations are designed to ensure a uniform approach across the industry. This has enabled the Government and other selected authorities within the UK such as Police and Councils amongst others to monitor all phone calls made from a UK landline or Mobile upon request. In April 2014, the European Court of Justice ruled that the European Union's Data Retention Directive was invalid. The European Court of Justice found it violates two basic rights, respect for private life and protection of personal data.  Communications Data Bill (2008–10)  In 2008 plans were being made to collect data on all phone calls, e-mails, chat room discussions and web- browsing habits as part of the Labour government's Interception Modernisation Programme under Prime Minister Gordon Brown. It was thought likely to require the insertion of thousands of black box probes into the country's computer and telephone networks. The proposals were expected to be included in the Communications Data Bill 2008. The \\"giant database\\" was to include telephone numbers dialled, the websites visited, and addresses to which e-mails are sent, but not the content of e-mails or telephone conversations. Chris Huhne, Liberal Democrat Home affairs spokesman, said, \\"The government's Orwellian plans for a vast database of our private communications are deeply worrying.\\" In November 2009, ministers confirmed that the estimated £2 billion project would proceed as planned. A consultation found that 40% of people were against the plans which would also include monitoring communications in online games.  Draft Data Communications Bill (2010–15)  The Interception Modernisation Programme was renamed the Communications Capabilities Development Programme by the Conservative-led government under David Cameron in 2010, and development of a new Draft Communications Data Bill began under Home Secretary Theresa May. The Draft Communications Data Bill was discussed between 2010 and 2013 but not formally introduced to Parliament as a Bill. It addressed the retention of communications data (not the content of messages) and proposed broadening the types of data retained by internet providers for example to include web browsing history. It was nicknamed the 'Snooper's Charter' and was abandoned by the government in 2013 after opposition from the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and his party of Liberal Democrats.

Nonlinear multidimensional signal processing is a subset of signal processing (multidimensional signal processing). Nonlinear multi-dimensional systems can be used in a broad range such as imaging, teletraffic, communications, hydrology, geology, and economics. Nonlinear systems cannot be treated as linear systems, using Fourier transformation and wavelet analysis. Nonlinear systems will have chaotic behavior, limit cycle, steady state, bifurcation, multi-stability and so on. Nonlinear systems do not have a canonical representation, like impulse response for linear systems. But there are some efforts to characterize nonlinear systems, such as Volterra and Wiener series using polynomial integrals as the use of those methods naturally extend the signal into multi-dimensions. Another example is the Empirical mode decomposition method using Hilbert transform instead of Fourier Transform for nonlinear multi-dimensional systems. This method is an empirical method and can be directly applied to data sets. Multi-dimensional nonlinear filters (MDNF) are also an important part of NMSP, MDNF are mainly used to filter noise in real data. There are nonlinear-type hybrid filters used in color image processing, nonlinear edge-preserving filters use in magnetic resonance image restoration. Those filters use both temporal and spatial information and combine the maximum likelihood estimate with the spatial smoothing algorithm.  Nonlinear analyser  A linear frequency response function (FRF) can be extended to a nonlinear system by evaluation of higher order transfer functions and impulse response functions by Volterra series. Suppose we have a time series y(t), which is decomposed y(t) into components of various order y(t)=y_0+y_1(t)+y_2(t)+\\\\cdots+y_n(t). Each component is defined as y_n(t)=\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty}\\\\cdots\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty}h_n(\\\\tau_1,\\\\tau_2,\\\\cdots,\\\\tau_n)\\\\displaystyle\\\\prod_{i=1}^{n}x(t-\\\\tau_i)d\\\\tau_i , for n=1, y_1(t) is the linear convolution. h_n(\\\\tau_1,\\\\tau_2,\\\\cdots,\\\\tau_n) is the generalized impulse response of order n. The 1D Fourier transform of y_n(t) is Y_{(n)}(\\\\omega)=\\\\int_{-\\\\infin}^{+\\\\infin}[\\\\int_{-\\\\infin}^{+\\\\infin}\\\\cdots\\\\int_{-\\\\infin}^{+\\\\infin}h_n(\\\\tau_1,\\\\cdots,\\\\tau_n)\\\\prod_{i=1}^{n}x(t-\\\\tau_i)d\\\\tau_i]\\\\exp(-j\\\\omega t)dt. Schetzen suggested the definition of nth output component as n time variables y_n(t_1,\\\\cdots,t_n) so as to permit the application of the n-dimensional Fourier transform, Y_n(\\\\omega_1,\\\\cdots,\\\\omega_n)=\\\\int_{-\\\\infin}^{+\\\\infin}\\\\cdots\\\\int_{-\\\\infin}^{+\\\\infin}[\\\\int_{-\\\\infin}^{+\\\\infin}\\\\cdots\\\\int_{-\\\\infin}^{+\\\\infin}h_n(\\\\tau_1,\\\\cdots,\\\\tau_n)x(t-\\\\tau_1)\\\\cdots x(t-\\\\tau_n)d\\\\tau_1\\\\cdots d\\\\tau_n]\\\\times\\\\exp(-j\\\\omega_1t_1\\\\cdots-j\\\\omega_nt_n)dt_1\\\\cdots dt_n. Taking the inverse Fourier transform of Y_{(n)}(\\\\omega) and Y_n(\\\\omega_1,\\\\cdots,\\\\omega_n) and equalizing t_1=t_2=\\\\cdots=t_n=t, we obtain the following equation, Y_{(n)}(\\\\omega)=\\\\int_{-\\\\infin}^{+\\\\infin}\\\\cdots\\\\int_{-\\\\infin}^{+\\\\infin}Y_n(\\\\omega-\\\\omega_2-\\\\cdots-\\\\omega_n,\\\\omega_2,\\\\cdots,\\\\omega_n)d\\\\omega_2d\\\\omega_3\\\\cdots d\\\\omega_n.  Transfer function  Applying the nth dimensional Fourier Transform to h_n(\\\\tau_1,\\\\tau_2,\\\\cdots,\\\\tau_n) obtain the transfer function H_n(\\\\omega_1,\\\\cdots,\\\\omega_n)=\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty}\\\\cdots\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty}h_n(\\\\tau_1,\\\\cdots,\\\\tau_n)\\\\exp(-j\\\\omega_1\\\\tau_1-\\\\cdots-j\\\\omega_n\\\\tau_n)d\\\\tau_1\\\\cdots d\\\\tau_n  Multi-dimensional nonlinear filter = Nonlinear-type hybrid filters  One example of nonlinear filters is the (generalized directional distance rational hybrid filter (GDDRHF)) for multidimensional signal processing. This filter is a two-stage type hybrid filter: 1) the stage L_p norm criteria and angular distance criteria to produce three output vectors with respect to the shape models; 2) the stage performs vector rational operation on the above three output vectors to produce the final output vectors. The output vector \\\\underline{y}(\\\\textbf{x}_i) of the GDDRHF is the result of a vector rational function taking into account three input sub- function which form an input function set \\\\\\\\{\\\\underline{y}_1,\\\\underline{y}_2,\\\\underline{y}_3\\\\\\\\}, \\\\underline{y}(\\\\textbf{x}_i)=\\\\underline{y}_2(\\\\textbf{x}_i)+\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{j=1}^{3}\\\\beta_j\\\\underline{y}_j(\\\\textbf{x}_i)}{h+kD[\\\\underline{y}_1(\\\\textbf{x}_i),\\\\underline{y}_3(\\\\textbf{x}_i)]}, where D[\\\\cdot] plays an important role as an edge sensing term, \\\\beta=[\\\\beta_1,\\\\beta_2,\\\\beta_3] characterizes the constant vector coefficient of the input sub-functions. h and k are some positive constants. The parameter k is used to control the amount of the nonlinear effect.  Multidimensional nonlinear edge-preserving filter  This kind of multidimensional filter has been used for MRI imaging processing. This filter uses MRI signal models to implement an approximate maximum likelihood or least squares estimate of each pixel gray level from the gray levels. It is also employs a trimmed mean spatial smoothing algorithm that uses a Euclidean distance discriminator to preserve partial volume and edge information; corresponds to using intra frame information .  Multi-dimensional ensemble empirical mode decomposition method  A multi-dimensional ensemble empirical mode decomposition method was applied to multi-dimensional data including images and solid with variable density. The decomposition is based on the application of ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) to slices of data in each and every dimension involved. The final reconstruction of the corresponding intrinsic mode function is based on a comparable minimal scale combination principle. For a two-dimensional signal f(m,n) using EEMD, the signal is first decomposed the y-direction to obtain g_j(m,n), each row of g_j(m,n) is decomposed using EEMD. Let f(x,y) be sampled as f(m,n)=\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cccc} f_{1,1} & f_{2,1} & \\\\cdots & f_{M,1}\\\\\\\\\\\\ f_{1,2} & f_{2,2} & \\\\cdots & f_{M,2}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ f_{1,n} & f_{2,N} & \\\\cdots & f_{M,N} \\\\end{array} \\\\right), The EEMD decomposition of the mth column of f(m,n) is f(m,\\\\sim)=\\\\sum_{j=1}^{J}C_j(m,\\\\sim)=\\\\sum_{j=1}^{J}\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c} c_{m,1,j}\\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{m,2,j}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{m,N,j}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array}\\\\right), after all the columns are decomposed we get j th matrix being g_j(m,n)=\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cccc} c_{1,1,j} & c_{2,1,j} & \\\\cdots & c_{M,1,j}\\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{1,2,j} & c_{2,2,j} & \\\\cdots & c_{M,2,j}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{1,N,j} & c_{2,N,j} & \\\\cdots & c_{M,N,j}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array}\\\\right). This is the j^{th} component of the original data f(m,n) n^{th} row of g_j(m,n) decomposition using EEMD is g_j(\\\\sim,n)=\\\\sum_{k=1}^{K}D_{j,k}(\\\\sim,n)=\\\\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cccc} d_{1,n,j,k}& d_{2,n,j,k}& \\\\cdots& d_{M,n,j,k}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array}\\\\right), rearrange the component as h_{j,k}(m,n)=\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cccc} d_{1,1,j,k} & d_{2,1,j,k} & \\\\cdots & d_{M,1,j,k}\\\\\\\\\\\\ d_{1,2,j,k} & d_{2,2,j,k} & \\\\cdots & d_{M,2,j,k}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ d_{1,N,j,k} & d_{2,1,N,k} & \\\\cdots & d_{M,N,j,k}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array}\\\\right), So f(m,n)=\\\\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\\\sum_{j=1}^{J}h_{j,k}(m,n). For a multi-dimension decomposition with an n-dimensional function we can use the same method above. The picture is download from Internet and code using is from Zhaohua, Wu et.al. The MDEEMD for a picture C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 are five mode components after decomposition.

Based in Toronto, it was founded in 1993 as a partnership between Peter Oliver and Michael Bonacini when they opened their first collaboration — a restaurant named Jump. In the years since, the company has expanded and it currently owns multiple venues and properties in and around Toronto. According to a 2013 The Globe and Mail piece, the company employs a staff of 1,200 people. Restaurants=Jump In operation for more than two decades, Jump is O&B;'s flagship restaurant. During that time it became a well known business lunch and dinner spot in Toronto's Financial District. When it opened at the corner of Bay & Wellington West in late 1993 during the early 1990s recession in Canada, Jump was a major investment by the 44-year-old South African-born former stockbroker and real estate entrepreneur Peter Oliver who had been an active restaurateur in Toronto since 1978 and 33-year-old Michael Bonacini who had made his name as chef at Centro, a popular Franco Prevedello-owned Italian cuisine fine dining spot at Yonge and Eglinton.Centro Toronto (1987-2013) Furthermore, at the time, Oliver owned successful midtown and uptown Toronto restaurants Oliver's Old Fashioned Bakery and Oliver's Bistro (also in the Yonge and Eglinton area), Bofinger Brasserie (near Yonge & St. Clair), and Auberge du Pommier (in North York near Yonge and York Mills); though he opened Jump as a partnership with Bonacini in 1993, Oliver kept the sole ownership of those four restaurants. Their collaboration occurred almost by chance - Oliver had been setting up the Jump project for years before his chef-to-be fell through and he turned to Bonacini who was the executive chef at Centro, across the street from Oliver's Old Fashioned Bakery. Located adjacent to the old glass-covered walkway in Commerce Court East, Jump aimed to bring a New York- style restaurant/bar with an offbeat menu and vibe. Launched with a blowout party with 600 guests and a rock band, the restaurant quickly established itself as the favourite of the business lunch crowd. In February 2013, ahead of its twentieth anniversary, the restaurant closed down for a month in order to undergo a C$1 million upgrade including the installation of state-of-the- art audio visual equipment to better meet the needs of clients who book space for private business meetings as well as renovation to the dining room, bar, and kitchen.Jump Canoe In 1995, following the quick failure of Chapeau (O&B;'s first project since Jump took off), the company accepted an offer from the TD Bank Tower landlord about opening a restaurant on the building's 54th floor where a struggling vine bar had been operating up to that point. A new restaurant called Canoe opened on 21 September 1995O&B; blog and quickly turned into another big winner for O&B;, by the late 2000s generating between C$6 and 7 million in revenue annually. In May 2015, nearly 20 years after the restaurant opened its doors, The Globe & Mail's Chris Nuttall-Smith awarded Canoe four stars, calling the restaurant \\"fresher, more ambitious, better- polished and more committed today to its cool Canadian mission than ever.\\" Auberge du Pommier Auberge du Pommier in Toronto's York Mills neighbourhood. Opened in 1987 in North York's affluent York Mills neighbourhood, under Peter Oliver's sole ownership, the fine dining French cuisine spot Auberge du Pommier operated under his command until 1997 when Oliver's partner in the rising O&B; company Michael Bonacini entered into its ownership structure as a co-owner. The restaurant thus after ten years got placed under the O&B; banner. Located in a mid 19th century cottage that was originally built in nearby Hoggs Hollow before getting relocated to its present location, the restaurant offers refined and modern interpretations of classic French dishes. Its executive chef is Marc St. Jacques who took over the post in 2011 having previously worked under celebrity chef Michael Mina at his restaurant Michael Mina at Bellagio in Las Vegas.

He participated in the suppression of the Jiajing wokou raids from 1547 to 1562, during which he fought the Portuguese smugglers who settled in pirate havens on the outlying islands of the Chinese coast. The Portuguese called him Luthissi, a combination of his surname Lu and the position he held, \\"dusi\\" (), or regional military commander. As a seasoned general, Lu Tang was a skilled strategist but suffered many setbacks on the battlefield. His career was not only affected by his military fortunes, but also the fates of the numerous commanders that he served. Raze of Shuangyu A native of Runing, Henan, Lu Tang began his career by inheriting a minor military position from his father. By 1548, he rose to the post of Regional Military Commander () of Fujian, where he gained the confidence of the Zhejiang grand coordinator Zhu Wan. On 15 April 1548, Zhu Wan ordered Lu Tang and Ke Qiao () to lead a fleet from Wenzhou to attack the pirate haven Shuangyu, which was being used as a trading post by Chinese pirates and merchants from Japan and Portugal. The fleet descended onto Shuangyu one night in June, under the cover of thick weather. Fifty-five to a few hundred smugglers perished, but the lieutenants such as Li Guangtou () and Wang Zhi were able to escape. Lu Tang then razed the town and rendered the harbour permanently unusable by filling it in with stones under Zhu Wan's orders. Zhu Wan and his generals were greatly rewarded in silver for the victory, but they also drew the ire of his political enemies among the gentry, whose profits were directly affected by the destruction of Shuangyu. The Zoumaxi affair After the loss of Shuangyu, the smugglers scattered along the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian to find good hideouts to trade. The deep water inlet of Zoumaxi (走馬溪, \\"Running Horse Creek\\") by the Dongshan Peninsula near the Fujian-Guangdong border was found to be a suitable place for trade since the terrain sheltered the ships from the winds. On 19 March 1549, Lu Tang and Ke Qiao ambushed two junks in Zoumaxi while the smugglers were trading with the Portuguese aboard. Lu and Ke lured the Portuguese guards away from the junks by feigning to attack from the shore, then set upon the junks the Ming fleet previously hidden behind a promontory. The junks were captured after a brief and feeble resistance, resulting in 33 deaths and 206 smugglers captured. Among the captured were Li Guangtou and a number of Portuguese men, and Lu Tang had four of the more good-looking Portuguese pretend to be kings of Malacca in order to make the victory seem more complete. Fearing that the captives might bribe their way out, Zhu Wan executed 96 of the Chinese smugglers using his discretionary powers. The Portuguese record of this incident by the crewman Galeote Pereira allege that Lu Tang, Ke Qiao, and possibly Zhu Wan exaggerated their victory in hopes of being rewarded with the goods they found on the junks, and killed the Chinese crew to prevent the ruse of the \\"Malaccan\\" kings from being exposed. On April 27, Zhu Wan was impeached for exceeding his authority since executions had to be sanctioned by the emperor. The Jiajing Emperor dismissed Zhu Wan from his post and ordered a full investigation on the matter. Seeing that the odds were against him, Zhu Wan committed suicide by drinking poison in January 1550. The investigation uncovered the ruse of the \\"Malaccan\\" kings, so Lu Tang and Ke Qiao were put in prison and condemned to death for their part in the affair, while the Portuguese smugglers were exiled to Guizhou. Later career The death of Zhu Wan was followed by the wholesale reversion of his policies. For three years the position held by Zhu Wan remained vacant, and the wokou raiders took full advantage of the military vacuum. In 1552, the Grand Coordinator of Shandong Wang Yu () was summoned to take Zhu Wan's old grand coordinator position in Zhejiang in the face of the escalating wokou crisis. As grand coordinator, Wang Yu released Lu Tang and Ke Qiao from prison to make use of their experience against the wokou. However, Wang Yu's armies suffered repeated defeats during his tenure, while Lu Tang also suffered military defeats against the pirates off the coast of Zhejiang in 1554. For this, Wang Yu and Lu Tang were sacked from office for their failure. A short time later, Lu Tang was recalled to serve under Zhang Jing, the new supreme commander of the six coastal provinces from Shandong to Guangxi. He was put in charge of the Miao troops from Baojing, and won a spectacular victory at Wangjiangjing () in May 1555 with the generals Yu Dayou and Tang Kekuan (). Later in September that year he captured the pirate chief Lin Bichuan (). He continued fighting in the field despite his superiors being replaced three times over two years, and finally came to serve under a supreme commander stable in his position, Hu Zongxian. Under Hu Zongxian, Lu Tang participated in the suppression of the raid of 1556, where he won a decisive victory in Taizhou south of Ningbo and helped defeat and kill the ringleader Xu Hai () at the Shen Family Estate () in late September. He also took an active part in Hu's plan to capture the most powerful pirate lord Wang Zhi, cooking up schemes such as using the offer of free trade to induce Wang to surrender, and attempting to turn Wang's Japanese collaborators against him. Eventually, Wang Zhi surrendered in 1557 and was executed in 1559. However, Lu Tang was impeached for simply chasing the pirates away from the coast instead of annihilating them. He was briefly demoted, but was reinstated in his post of regional commander of the Southern Metropolitan Region (Nanzhili) and Zhejiang () through the influence of Tang Shunzhi (), the vice director of the bureau of operations. In addition, Lu Tang was finally recognized for his role in the capture of Wang Zhi, and was promoted in rank to vice commissioner-in-chief of the central military commission (). When Hu Zongxian was charged with corruption in December 1562, Lu Tang was also implicated. He was stripped of his commissions but was otherwise unpunished. Lu Tang returned to his home village and little is known about his later activities.

He showed promise as a juvenile in 1992 but became increasingly temperamental and was gelded. He was off the course for ten months before returning to win three of his four races in the following year. As a four-year-old he showed steady improvement, winning the Grade III Kinko Sho and the Grade II Kyoto Daishoten before defeating a strong international field in the Japan Cup. He remained in training until 1997 but made only five more appearances before his career was ended by injury. He died in 2007. Background Marvelous Crown was a chestnut gelding with a white blaze bred in Japan by Hayata Bokujo. He was sired by Miswaki, a Florida-bred stallion who won the Prix de la Salamandre in 1980. Miswaki went on to become a very successful breeding stallion, siring many important winners including Urban Sea and Black Tie Affair. Marvelous Crown's dam Maurita was a New Zealand-bred mare who won the New Zealand Oaks in 1982 and also produced the Hollywood Turf Handicap-winner Grand Flotilla. During his racing career Marvelous Crown was owned by Sadao Sasahara and trained by Makoto Osawa. Racing career=1992: two-year-old season Marvelous Crown began his racing career by winning a maiden race over 1200 metres on the dirt at Hanshin Racecourse on 19 September 1992. When moved up in distance to 1600 metres and switched to turf at Kyoto Racecourse in October he finished third to Biwa Hiyahide a colt who was voted Japanese Horse of the Year in the following year. In his two other starts in 1992, Marvelous Crown finished fourth at Kyoto in November and second when moved up to 2000 metres at Hanshin in December. Marvelous Crown began to show serious behvioural problems and was becoming dangerous to handle: his owner therefore took the decision to have him gelded. 1993: three-year-old season As a gelding, Marvelous Crown was ineligible to contest many of the major Japanese races for three-year-olds including the Satsuki Sho, Tokyo Yushun and Kikuka Sho. He did not appear as a three-year-old until 16 October 1993 when he won a race over 1600 metres at Kyoto, beating Center the Eagle and fourteen others. At the same track in November he won the Kitaoji Tokubetsu and the Hiei Stakes, both over 2000 metres. On his final appearance of the season he was moved up in class and distance for the Grade II Naruo Kinen over 2500 metres at Hanshin on 11 December and finished second of the sixteen runners behind Roubles Act. 1994: four-year-old season At Hanshin in January 1994 Marvelous Crown finished second to Eishin Tennessee in the Grade III Sports Nippon Sho Kim Pai over 2000 metres and then ran fourth over 2500 metres in the Grade II NIkkei Shinshun Hai. Later in spring he finished second to North Flight in the Yomiuri Milers Cup at Chukyo Racecourse, sixth in the Sankei Osaka Hai and second to Golden Hour in the Niigata Daishoten. After six consecutive defeats the gelding recorded his first major success when he defeated Fuji One Man Cross, Towa Darling and seven others in the Grade III Tokai TV Hai Kinko Sho over 1800 metres at Chukyo on 19 June. At the same course in July he ended the first part of his four-year-old campaign by finishing third to Nice Nature and Star Ballerina in the Takamatsunomiya Hai. On 9 October Marvelous Crown was one of ten horses to contest the Grade II Kyoto Daishoten over 2500 metres at Hanshin. He won from Ayrton Symboli and Machikane Allegro in a record time of 2:31.0. The thirteenth running of the Japan Cup at Tokyo Racecourse saw four Japanese-trained horses face ten challengers from abroad in front of 165,930 spectators. The North American challenge comprised Sandpit (the 7/2 favourite), Paradise Creek, Fraise, Grand Flotilla (Marvelous Crown's older half-brother) and Johann Quatz (winner of the Prix Lupin when trained in France). The European contingent comprised Hernando, Apple Tree (Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud, Coronation Cup) and Raintrap (Canadian International Stakes). The other overseas runners were Jeune from Australia and Rough Habit from New Zealand. Starting at odds of 9.6/1 Marvelous Crown, with Katsumi Minai in the saddle, was the most fancied of the Japanese horses ahead of Royce and Royce, Nice Nature and Fujiyama Kenzan. Sandpit went to the front in the early stages and established a clear lead as Minai settled Marvelous Crown on the inside in third place alongside Johann Quatz and Fujiyama Kenzan. Sandpit gave way in the straight and Paradise Creek took the lead from Royce and Royce, but Marvelous Crown continued to make along the rail. The Japanese gelding caught the American challenger in the final stride and won by a nose with Royce and Royce taking third ahead of Hernando. Hinai admitted \\"I was not sure if I won until I saw the scoreboard\\". 1995, 1996 & 1997: later career Marvelous Crown remained in training but made few appearances and never threatened to repeat his form of 1994. As a five-year-old his best effort in three races came when he finished fourth behind Kanetsu Cross in the Naruo Kinen. He returned after an absence of a year to run sixth on dirt at Urawa in December 1996 and was pulled-up with an injury on his final start at Funabashi on 27 January 1997. Marvelous Crown did not race again and lived in retirement in Hokkaido before dying on 2 June 2007 at the age of seventeen. Pedigree *Marvelous Crown was inbred 4 × 4 to Princequillo, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

Matagarup is the Noongar name for Heirisson Island which is situated in the centre of Perth. On 1 March 2015 more than 100 Aboriginal protesters and homeless people established a \\"refugee protest\\" camp at Heirisson Island in response to the threat by State Government of forced closures of small remote communities. The City of Perth Shire has refused the right of the protesters to camp, protest and to shelter the homeless. The City of Perth raided the island camp nine times between March and August 2015, usually escorted by a large police presence, and confiscated the tents and belongings of the campers and the homeless. During some of the raids police have been accused of \\"an excessive use of force\\". Some of the raids have led to police arresting campers, handing out move-on notices and in court appearances but the campers and the homeless continue to return. On each occasion the camp has re-established itself, led by Nyungah Elder, Bella Bropho, who has camped on the island since 1 March 2015. Bropho said that the homeless camp had to be fought for \\"because if this fails, I don't know where the people are going to go to.\\" The refugee camp is seen as both illegal and unwanted by ordinary Perth residents but claimed to be accepted by some workers with the homeless, particularly Jennifer Kaeshagen of the First Nations Homelessness Project and Tanya Cairns, director of HAND. Matagarup Refugee Camp has attracted international attention and support. On 31 May 2015, the Matagarup Concert for the Homeless was held on Heirisson Island despite the protestations of the City of Perth Shire. Social justice campaigner and homeless worker, Jennifer Kaeshagen coordinated the Concert. The City of Perth Shire Chief Executive Officer Gary Stevenson stated \\"authorities were compelled to act due to the recent amount of activity on the island\\" and that \\"facilities are not designed to cope with large groups of people continuously congregating at Heirisson Island\\". Matagarup has elevated media attention to Perth's increasing homelessness and advocates for the homeless such as Kaeshagen and Gerry Georgatos have established campaigns for Homeless Friendly Precincts and have even secured the support of the City of Perth Council. The campaign has expanded nationally. Georgatos said that homelessness on the streets includes significant numbers of large families \\"of 5,6,7,8, and 9 children\\". Since the August 2015 raid, the City of Perth officially refers to this as \\"de-camping\\", in August 2015, the City of Perth desisted from confiscating the tents. The camp has grown and continues to shelter the homeless. Since August 2015, advocates alongside the campers led by Bella Bropho have brought the right of the homeless to camp at Heirisson Island before various tribunals, mediation and courts, each time unsuccessfully. Kaeshagen and Cairns coordinated Christmas for the homeless camp at Heirisson on December 22, 2015 once again without securing permits from the City of Perth.

It supports solutions, technology, management and distribution of branded value such as gift cards, telecom and financial service products. Blackhawk's network reaches people through a number of different channels including in-store, online, mobile, and incentive. Blackhawk is headquartered in Pleasanton, California and was incorporated in 2006. The company began by selling gift cards through Safeway stores in 2001 and then expanded to other partners in the United States. The Nordstrom gift card was one of the first items launched by the group. The company grew dramatically over the following years by expanding content, channels and markets through organic growth and acquisition. This included the acquisition of the German startup Retailo and the purchase of Parago Inc. for $290 million. In 2013, the company filed for a $200 million IPO on NASDAQ. In 2014, Safeway divested the rest of its Blackhawk Network shares to make Blackhawk a fully independent company. History Blackhawk was formed in 2001 as a subsidiary of Safeway Inc., following the company's decision to diversify into other markets that weren't focused around grocery, in an attempt to grow its portfolio and turnover. The subsidiary of Safeway began as a simple idea to sell gift cards in Safeway Inc. stores across the United States. The idea for the company came about after the group originally called Safeway Marketing Services and run by Donald Kingsborough came up with the concept of selling gift cards at Safeway stores while researching ways Safeway could grow its business, away from traditional grocery-related products. The idea was to launch gift cards during the holidays in 2001. At the time of launch, the gift card market was relatively small, but it began to grow quickly when Safeway Inc. customers began to become more interested in convenience. Over the next few years, Blackhawk used the successful gift card program in Safeway and other global retailers as a platform to partner with more merchants and today has over 700+ partners in 25 countries. Brands operating under Blackhawk included The Home Depot, Barnes & Noble and McDonald’s. During this period, Blackhawk launched GiftCardMall.com, an online store where consumers could purchase gift cards. The company continued to grow its digital profile over the coming years, with a major acquisition in 2011. Cardpool was acquired for an unknown amount by Blackhawk. Cardpool purchases pre-owned gift cards and sells them at large discounts. At the time of the purchase, it was decided that Cardpool would remain as a brand under the Blackhawk umbrella to further develop its gift card marketplace. In August 2010, it was announced that Bill Tauscher would become the CEO of Blackhawk. Prior to this, he served as executive chairman from 2009 onwards. Blackhawk promoted Talbott Roche to become its president in 2010. Roche had been part of the company since it was founded in 2001. Prior to her becoming president, she was nominated for the Stevie Award Women in Business, and was also recognized by Progressive Grocer as a Top Woman in Grocery. Roche also won the prestigious Paybefore Industry Achievement Award and was named one of the Top 5 Most Interesting People in Prepaid by Paybefore News. It was announced in 2013 that Blackhawk would be filing its IPO and launching on the NASDAQ. The stock was floated at a total value of $200 million, following sales hitting $959 million for the previous financial year. Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Citi and Deutsche Bank were the joint bookrunners on the deal. Blackhawk made another acquisition in 2013, buying the company InteliSpend. The acquisition was seen as an expansion in a similar market to gift cards, with InteliSpend providing corporate incentives and consumer promotion products. Around a similar period of time, the company also announced a partnership with PayPal to provide gift card services through PayPal's digital wallet. Following the IPO announcement, Blackhawk announced the purchase of the German-based startup, Retailo. The acquisition in late 2013 was estimated to be around $50 million. Retailo would remain in Germany, operating as a subsidiary of Blackhawk. Blackhawk announced one of its most significant acquisitions in 2014 with the $290 million purchase of Parago Inc. The incentives and rewards solutions company would be a major step into incentives for Blackhawk and make up the majority of their incentives branch. Parago would provide expertise for Blackhawk in designing incentive programs, with Parago Inc. already designing reward-based incentive programs for companies including Dell, General Electric, and Toyota. Blackhawk's parent company, Safeway Inc., completed a spin-off of Blackhawk in April 2014. This was done by distributing 37.8 million shares of Blackhawk stock to Safeway shareholders. Later that year, Blackhawk announced that they would be acquiring Dallas, Texas-based CardLab. In January 2015, Blackhawk launched Blackhawk Engagement Solutions. The division focuses on engagement, incentive and rebate programs. Blackhawk Engagement Solutions was also formed to group together a number of incentive providers Blackhawk Network had acquired, including Incentec Solutions, Incentive CardLab, InteliSpend, and Parago. Blackhawk also announced the acquisition of Achievers and Netherlands-based DIDIX Gifting & Promotions in 2015. In early 2016, it was announced that Talbott Roche would become the CEO while remaining in her current role as President. The move came after Blackhawk had experienced rapid growth over the previous five years, tripling its revenue. Around the same time, Blackhawk also acquired the ecommerce company, NimbleCommerce. A couple of months later, Blackhawk announced that they would be acquiring extrameasures. No terms of the deal were disclosed. Blackhawk announced in September 2016 that they would be acquiring Grass Roots Group Holdings Ltd., a provider of customer and employee engagement solutions. According to Incentive magazine, the acquisition totaled $118 million. Following the acquisition, Grass Roots confirmed they would operate as a subsidiary company of Blackhawk's, with operations in Europe and Asia-Pacific continuing as they did prior to the acquisition. On Aug. 30, 2017, Blackhawk announced the acquisition of Portland, Maine-based CashStar, which provides digital gift card solutions to major retailers and restaurants, for $175 million in cash. On Jan. 16, 2018, Blackhawk announced that it would be acquired by Silver Lake and P2 Capital Partners for $3.5 Billion. On April 8, 2020, Blackhawk acquired SVM Cards, a provider of gas station and retail branded gift cards in the gift and B2B spaces. Market Blackhawk announced two major partnerships in 2015. The first was with Stockpile, to distribute gift cards on their behalf. The move was seen as innovative by the Palo Alto-based startup, as it allowed consumers to purchase a gift card that can be redeemed to open and fund an account with stock. By partnering with Blackhawk, Stockpile would sell their gift card products in retail stores already partnered with Blackhawk. Blackhawk and Samsung announced a partnership deal later the same year to allow gift cards to be integrated into Samsung Pay. The deal meant 50 global retailers would now have their gift cards accessible in Samsung's mobile wallet. Startups have begun to partner with Blackhawk to provide their users with gift rewards. One example is with Jay S. Walker's Upside, where rewards are given to people that were flexible with their hotel and flight bookings. According to Fortune magazine, a business traveler might earn a gift card for staying at a hotel that is farther away from a convention center or taking a flight that leaves 30 minutes earlier. In May 2016, Upside and Blackhawk announced a partnership to allow businesspeople to receive gift rewards through Blackhawk. Recognition Blackhawk is the recipient of numerous awards, including the 2015 Paybefore Europe Awards Change Agent of the Year, which recognized Blackhawk’s global expansion efforts in mCommerce and gifting, as well as the 2015 Paybefore Best in Category for Top Digital Dollars award, which recognized Blackhawk’s Reloadit Safe, a product that facilitates the loading of cash on a reloadable prepaid card. Blackhawk was also named the 2014 Company of the Year by The Stevie International Business Awards and the American Business Awards. Talbott Roche, Blackhawk’s CEO and president, was selected as an Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year finalist. In 2015, Blackhawk's female executives were recognized by Pay magazine and featured on the cover of its fall issue. The issue focused on Women Driving Payments Change. The company was also recognized at the Pay Awards in the same year for its Gift Card for Stock, winning \\"Product of the Year.\\" Talbott Roche was again recognized by PYMNTS, winning the Woman Innovating Technology Award in 2016.

For ten years she was the editor of The American Museum Journal, which was renamed Natural History during her editorship. She published two books: Moths and Butterflies (1901) and The Frog Book (1906) as well as numerous popular and scientific articles. She described over 20 species of reptiles and is commemorated in the scientific names of four lizards. Early life and career  Mary Cynthia Dickerson was born in Hastings, Michigan, on March 7, 1866 to parents Wilbur and Melissa Dickerson. In her early life she cared for her three small brothers. In a memorial, Maud Slye wrote \\"She put herself through college at a time when it was not easy for a girl to do this.\\" She attended the University of Michigan from 1886 to 1887 and from 1889 to 1891, after which she taught high school biology in Michigan and Illinois from 1891 to 1895. She then attended the University of Chicago, earning a Bachelor of Science in 1897. From 1897 to 1905 she was head of zoology and botany at Rhode Island Normal School, where she led students on nature walks in Providence and collected observations for her books Moths and Butterflies (1901) and The Frog Book (1906). Cover to Moths and Butterflies Moths and Butterflies, illustrated with Dickerson's photographs, was well received. A reviewer for The American Naturalist opened \\"This is really an excellent book, both in conception and in execution.\\" A review in the Journal of Education stated \\"This work must, simply on the ground of merit, be placed in the front rank of nature studies... Not only is its descriptive matter free from everything like pedantry and professionalism, but the illustrations fairly make the study eloquent.\\" A mixed review by the American Journal of Psychology wrote Dickerson \\"has the fatal error of the pedagogue that the number of topics and range must be sacrificed to thoroughness of method. Happily, however, she does not carry this principle, which has trivialized so many text books, so far as to interfere with the really great merit of her book.\\" The Frog Book, published in 1906, explored the frogs and toads of North America. \\"For many years amateur naturalists and nature-study teachers have been asking for a popular reference book on our common amphibians\\" wrote a reviewer in The Independent, \\"However, the need of a popular frog book is now well met\\". A reviewer for Science wrote: \\"Not only are the habits of the common frogs well portrayed, but the eggs and tadpoles are figured, as has not been done before\\". A more mixed review for The Nature Study Review writes \\"the work is more than interesting, it is quite accurate and very usable,\\" but notes \\"the life-histories are a disappointment from the viewpoint of the scientist. It would seem that the 'ten years of observation and study' to which the author confesses should have furnished more accurate data on such fundamental points as breeding seasons, number of eggs laid, quantity and kinds of food, etc.\\" From 1907 to 1908 she was an instructor at Stanford University, where she co- authored three papers with ichthyologist David Starr Jordan, including the description of a new species of halfbeak. She began working at the American Museum of Natural History in November 1908, and spent the remainder of her career at the institution. American Museum of Natural History At the American Museum, Dickerson was first hired as an assistant in the department of Woods and Forestry, where one of her early publications was a guide to the forestry hall. She was appointed to curator in 1911. In July 1909, a Department of Ichthyology and Herpetology was formally established by the Museum, with Dickerson as the sole herpetologist alongside ichthyologists Bashford Dean, John Treadwell Nichols, and Louis Hussakof. In November 1909, Dickerson became associate editor of The American Museum Journal and became editor the following year, a position she held until 1920. Dickerson promoted the growth of the herpetological collections, and was known for her lifelike amphibian and reptile dioramas or \\"groups\\". She attracted a trio of notable herpetologists to the American Museum: Karl Patterson Schmidt, Gladwyn Kingsley Noble, and Charles Lewis Camp. Under Dickerson's direction, the herpetology collections grew to nearly 50,000 specimens. In February, 1920, herpetology was separated from ichthyology and a new Department of Herpetology was formally created, with Dickerson as its first curator. She was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, American Forestry Association, American Ornithologists' Union, and the New York Academy of Sciences. Dickerson considered exhibition work to be of equal importance to research and she developed the concept of herpetological \\"habitat groups\\" by employing a variety of preparation techniques, most notably wax casting to create life like models and create a more integrated exhibit. Dickerson described over 20 new species of reptiles, including the San Esteban chuckwalla and the Cuban sharp-nosed amphisbaena. She is commemorated in the names of four lizard species or subspecies: Cnemaspis dickersonae, Aspidoscelis tigris dickersonae, Holbrookia maculata dickersonae, and Crotaphytus dickersonae. Later years By around 1919, Dickerson was showing signs of mental disturbance, attributed to the stress of holding dual curatorial and editorial duties. Her behavior became erratic, and she experienced auditory hallucinations of the Arctic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson, an associate of the Museum, to whom she wrote several letters indicative of mental disturbance. She was pressured to take time off work, which she refused, and in November 1920 was removed from the museum after a medical evaluation and placed in the custody of her brother. She re-appeared at the museum in December 10, acting peculiarly, and was taken to a hospital for observation. On December 24 she was committed to a psychiatric institution on Wards Island, where she spent the rest of her life, dying at the age of 57 on April 8, 1923.

It was built circa 1884 by South Sea Islander labour. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 1 October 2001.  History  The South Sea Islander Wall at Mon Repos was constructed in the probably using South Sea Islander labour. Mon Repos Sugar Plantation was established in 1884. By 1887 Mon Repos was Millaquin Refinery's major juice supplier. A relative latecomer to Bundaberg's sugar boom, Mon Repos Plantation was owned by Augustus Purling Barton. Barton was born into upper class English society in 1834 and arrived in Melbourne in 1855. In 1863 Barton had taken up Moolboolaman station in the Kolan district. Barton led the life of a squatter for about twenty years. Then, in the early 1880s, he acquired a stake in the Woongarra district. He constructed a large home which he intended as a coastal retreat or town house, where his family could get away occasionally from station life. He named the home \\"Mon Repos\\" (French for 'My Rest'). The first cane from Mon Repos plantation was harvested in 1882 and crushed at neighbouring mills. By 1884, Barton was operating his own juice mill. Over the years, he expanded his plant. During 1886, Barton had acquired Drynie, a small mill in the Burdekin district and re-erected it with additions in the Woongarra. Mon Repos plantation soon absorbed its neighbour Duncraggan. In 1887, Barton's juice mill was one of Millaquin refinery's major suppliers of juice. Mon Repos juice mill was converted to a complete sugar mill in 1887-88 and Barton continued to expand. Summerville mill and plantation were acquired in 1892, with the mill closing and the cane from the plantation crushed at Mon Repos. Two years later, Barton absorbed The Grange plantation. Horsedrawn cart at weighbridge in front of Qunaba Sugar Mill, 1909 In 1896, the Queensland National Bank gained control over the Millaquin refinery. In 1899, the negotiations began between Barton and the Queensland National Bank, an agreement was reached, and the Bank purchased Mon Repos mill and plantation. The name Mon Repos was changed to Qunaba (from QUeensland NAtional BAnk). Bundaberg Sugar Pty still owns a parcel of land on which the wall is located. Barton was very much in favour of using South Sea Islander labour. The Woongarra area was covered with rocks, which were gathered and stone walls built around the cane fields. South Sea Islanders had been working on other sugar plantations in the Bundaberg district from at least the mid-1870s. They were not brought directly to Bundaberg until 1879, but prior to this planters obtained Islanders via Maryborough, whose sugar industry had been established in the late 1860s. Herbert Turner later wrote of the work of South Sea Islanders in clearing the land on Woongarra farms: > . . . a large portion of the Woongarra land contained more or less loose > rocks. After the tree stumps had been collected in heaps and burnt, the next > job was to deal with the stones. Where possible they would be broken into > convenient size for handling, loaded onto drays, and carted to the farm > boundary lines, and there built up as stone wall boundary fences averaging > five feet in height and four feet in width. A number of these stone walls > are still in existence. The large stones would either be drilled and blasted > with dynamite to a convenient handling size, or snigged by horse team to the > boundary line. Local tradition also records that: > Wooden sleds, pulled by draught horses, followed around the paddocks as the > land was being cleared. Rocks unearthed during this process were placed on > the sled. Big rocks which would not fit on the sled would be broken up with > spalling hammers. These pieces would then be placed on corn bags, an > Islander on each corner, which would then be carried to the sled. When full, > the sleds were taken to the end of the paddock where they were unloaded. The dry-rubble boundary walls were constructed in layers, with larger stones placed around the outside and smaller stones used for the infill. This seems to have been a common construction method in the Woongarra, but the origin of the technique has yet to be established.  Description  The South Sea Islander Wall at Mon Repos, is approximately in length, of which is within the Mon Repos Conservation Park. Approximately of the eastern or seaward end of the wall has been covered by drifting sand. A gap of exists in the wall near its midpoint, with no obvious evidence that a wall previously existed in the area. The wall has an average height of approximately , an average width of approximately at the base and an average width of approximately at the top surface. The wall is of similar construction to that at the former Sunnyside Sugar Plantation on Windermere Road. There are believed to be only 6 similarly intact dry-rubble walls surviving in the Bundaberg district, of which the Mon Repos wall is a good example.  Heritage listing  The South Sea Islander Wall was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 1 October 2001 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The South-Sea Islander Wall survives as important evidence of the enormous contribution made by South Sea Islanders to the establishment of a viable sugar industry in Queensland. In particular, it remains as testament to their contribution to the development of the sugar industry in the Bundaberg region, one of the most affluent sugar districts in the state. The wall is also important physical evidence of the manual nature of this contribution, for without the availability of indentured labour, Woongarra Scrub farmers could not have converted their lands to an activity as initially labour-intensive as sugar growing. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The boundary wall, which is over one and a half kilometres metres in length, survives as one of the longest, most intact examples of its type in the Bundaberg district, which around the turn-of-the-century was chequered with such structures. Further, the South Sea Islander Wall, Mon Repos is significant for its rarity. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The place is significant also for its potential to contribute to further study, and better understanding, of the role of South Sea Islanders in Queensland history. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Although diminished in length, what survives is substantially intact, and provides a good example of dry-rubble wall construction employed in the Bundaberg district in the late 19th century. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Importantly, it has a strong association for the present local South Sea Islander community with the experiences of their ancestors in Queensland. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The place has an important association with the exploitation of the large South Sea Islands workforce employed in the Bundaberg district in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

It has a low population.  Geography  Most of the coastline of Mon Repos is part of the Mon Repos Conservation Park, established to protect the nesting areas of turtles. Inland of the conversation park, much of the land is state reserves or subject to other restrictions designed to support the wildlife objectives of the conversation park. There is a small amount of built environment, a caravan park on the coast and a small residential area inland from it.  History  Mon Repos is French for \\"My Rest\\" and was the name of the homestead established by Augustus Purling Barton in the early 1880s. In the 1890s, the governments of France, Queensland and New South Wales decided to construct an undersea telegraph cable to link Australia to North America across the Pacific Ocean via New Caledonia, Fiji, Samoa, and Hawaii. The cable came ashore at Mon Repos, where a cable station was constructed. The cable was used until the 1920s when it was replaced by a radio service via Sydney and the cable station demolished.

In this episode, Snow is reunited with Hercules; and Henry and Cruella are reunited. In flashbacks, Hercules trains Snow. Plot=Opening sequence The underworld cemetery makes an appearance in the red tinted forest. Event chronology The Enchanted Forest events take place after \\"Quite a Common Fairy\\" and before \\"Enter the Dragon\\". The Underworld events take place after \\"Souls of the Departed\\". In the characters' past In the early days of the Enchanted Forest, a young Snow White is asked to defend her kingdom from bandits who are working with the Evil Queen but flees into the forest, believing she cannot help them with her father away. After she falls into a hunting trap Snow is saved by Hercules, who is on a quest to complete the final part of his Twelve Labors, which is to hunt down Cerberus. He encourages Snow White not to give up, and he even offers to train her for battle, suggesting that she fight the bandits herself. When Snow faces the bandits, she foolishly drops her arrows, then loses her dignity when Hercules defends her. Using his past mistakes and learning from them, Hercules inspires her to try again, and she successfully aims at the bandits' weapons, prompting the bandits to leave the kingdom, and setting up her future as the bandit princess. Snow White thanks Hercules for helping her and says she will make a great Queen and Olympus will have a great hero like him and they kiss goodbye. In the Underworld Deep inside Hades' lair, an injured Hook awakens and notices a young woman who is also trapped with him in the chamber. As he struggles to move Hook convinces the young woman to run for help and asks for Emma. As they reach the exit, a three-headed hellhound creature, Cerberus, chases after the two. Above at the cemetery, Mary Margaret and David look at the gravestones of those who Mary Margaret felt she had failed as alluded in the flashback, But David is confident that they can protect Emma and tells Mary Margaret that she can be able to succeed. When she sees the tombstone of Hercules, David is surprised to learn that she knew the Demi-God, and believes that he has unfinished business with her, which gives them the idea to help him while seeking out Hook. Regina and Robin meet up with Emma and Henry. Regina tells Robin that she has maps at the Mayor's office and Henry and Robin head there but when Regina turns around Emma has took off and calls for her. Emma notices fresh blood and traces the direction, but instead they find the young woman and she says she knows Killian. As soon as they hear the roar of Cerberus, Emma uses her magic to take them to the Underworld version of Mary Margaret's apartment. Later on at Granny's Diner, Emma and Regina are joined by Mary Margaret, and thanks to the Blind Witch, they find Hercules, who they hope he will complete his Twelve Labors before he can move on, being Cerberus. At the Mayor's office, Henry breaks in to get the maps as Robin stands guard. Instead of finding the map, Henry sees Cruella, who explains to him that because he is now the Author, he can bring her back to life, and despite the fact that he broke the Quill, it’s still alive in the Underworld as it has unfinished business to write people's stories. She tells Henry if he helps her escape the Underworld, it will be as if she never died, and therefore, Emma’s soul will be pure again. Unfortunately when Robin asks Henry if he found the map as they leave the office, Henry lies to Robin that he didn’t find anything or anyone. As they reached the tunnel with Cerberus waiting for them, Hercules starts to lose his courage in front of Emma, Mary Margaret and Regina. Hades then appears and tells the women that Cerberus was the creature responsible for killing Hercules (who happens to be Hades' nephew), then gives Emma Hook's bloodied hook as a gift. Back at the apartment, Mary Margaret believes its time for Hercules, who regretted fighting Cerberus alone, to fight the creature as a team. When Cerberus enters the apartment, everyone splits up, leaving Hercules, Mary Margaret, and the woman trapped inside the library. Hercules suddenly gives the woman his dagger, then grabs a pipe for himself, and Mary Margaret readies her arrows. The trio then use their weapons on Cerberus and successfully kill the creature. The woman faints and Hercules catches her, and when she comes to they introduce each other, as she revealed to Hercules her name is Megara, or as her friends called her, Meg. As everyone meets back at Granny's Diner, they learn that it was their \\"unfinished business\\" for Hercules to rescue Meg from Cerberus, as he died during his fight with the creature and Meg later died after he failed. The crew takes them to the crossing, and Hercules and Meg ascend together to Olympus. As the clock ticks twice, Hades has decided that it's time for the outsiders to pay by punishing them. He arrives to see his prisoner Hook, and tells him that for each soul his friends help escape, one of them will have to stay forever. Hades forces Hook to decide which of his friends will pay for this by creating new tombstones for him to engrave with a chisel.

Reception The episode received good reviews in how they reimagined the Hercules angle and the structured storylines. In a review from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, \\"This just might have been the best Once Upon a Time so far this season, despite “Labor of Love” largely focusing on two people we’ve only just met. This episode had the perfect balance of well-paced drama, strong character arcs, and a solid twist or two to compel us to come back next week. This essentially recaptured that adventurous, yet emotionally grounded feeling of the first two seasons. To say I loved this would be one of the big understatements of the TV season so far.\\"‘Once Upon A Time’ Season 5 Episode 13 Review: ‘Labor of Love’ Is Awesome TV\\" from Rickey.org (March 13, 2016) Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly notes in her assessment of the review: \\"Once isn’t exactly a novice when it comes to turning fairytales on their heads, and rarely do they follow stories to the letter.

Its mouth was at an elevation of 2,999 feet / 914 meters at its confluence with Cajon Canyon. Its source was at an elevation of 4200 feet at near Cajon Summit. The canyon runs southward just west of the top of Cajon Pass then turns southwestward to meet Cajon Canyon. History As Coyote Canyon, what is now Crowder Canyon, was the route that first the Old Spanish Trail and then the Mormon Road passed through the Cajon Pass. Antonio Armijo, who pioneered the Old Spanish Trail, did not cross over the San Bernardino Mountains by the Mojave Trail route over Monument Peak but followed a route he called \\"Cañon de San Bernardino\\" from the upper Mojave River west through Cajon Pass and down Crowder Canyon and then Cajon Canyon. It was known to the vaqueros of the San Bernardino de Sena Estancia who had come to the aid of Armijo's party with food.LeRoy R.

The 1851 Mormon Waybill, a pamphlet for travelers on the Mormon Road, written by Joseph Cain, one of the earliest travelers on the route in 1849, described conditions on this route as \\"Road bad down the canon.\\"LeRoy Reuben Hafen, Ann Woodbury Hafen, Journals of Forty-niners: Salt Lake to Los Angeles: with Diaries and Contemporary Records of Sheldon Young, James S.

Brower, Salt Lake City, 1851. Originally the route of herds of horses and a trail for pack horse trains in single file, the first wagons had difficulty passing along the old horse trail, rocks had to be moved, trail widened or the wagons taken apart and carried over intractable obstructions. Soon an alternate and marginally less difficult but longer route on a narrow ridge was found some miles to the west in the upper Cajon Canyon. In 1855 the state of California funded a passable road a mile or so farther west called the Sanford Cutoff. In 1861, as a result of the Holcomb Valley gold rush, the difficult but shorter, Crowder Canyon route was made into a good road and a toll charged. Today California State Route 138 now passes along Crowder Canyon between Cajon Junction on Interstate 15 and the summit of Cajon Pass.

Education  Mlinar finished high school in Ljubljana and graduated from the Ljubljana Faculty of Law in 1958. As a postgraduate student, he studied sociology at the Institute of Social Sciences in Belgrade. In 1960, he became an assistant professor in Sociology at the Faculty of Law in Ljubljana, and earned his PhD in 1967.  Career  From 1963 to 1968, he worked as a researcher at the Institute of Sociology and Philosophy. He joined the Faculty of Social Sciences in 1968, first as an associate professor and then in 1974 as a full professor until his retirement in 1997. Between 1974 and 1976, he was dean of the faculty. As a researcher, Mlinar founded the Centre for Spatial Sociology, which focuses on the interdisciplinary studies of spatial, urban, and landscape planning. Mlinar was elected an associate member of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SASA)http://www.sazu.si/ in 1981 and a full member in 1987. He was head of the Department of Social Sciences and the secretary of the first Section for Historical and Social Sciences. Spatial sociology Mlinar was the first person to internationally conceive the research and lecturing of spatial sociology. He considered it in the broader context of the multi-level interpretations of socio-structural change and the role of actors in it. In doing so, Mlinar integrated and transcended the frameworks of urban and rural sociology, local self-government, and regional research, revealing the regularities of social change, particularly in terms of individualization and socialisation processes, globalisation, and informatisation. He studied the dynamics of the interpenetration and exclusion of opposites, transcending the outdated notions of the zero-sum game logic between local and global, homogenisation, diversification, and de-territorialisation and re- territorialisation. He interpreted social transformation as the freeing up of actors and their overcoming of divisions arising from spatial, temporal, sectoral, and hierarchical organisation. He explored changes in the spatial organisation of public and private life, with a focus on the genuine sphere of the life of the inhabitants’ actual participation, influence and contacts in space. With Henry Teune, he co-authored The Developmental Logic of Social Systems (1978) which Encyclopedia Britannica listed among the \\"grand theories\\" concerning social development in the context of centuries of change. Founder Mlinar is considered to be one of the key founders and visionaries enforcing spatial sociology both nationally and internationally. He has worked towards professionalization and socialization of sociology (public sociology). He is one of the co-founders and the first President of the Slovenian Sociological Society and was President of the Yugoslav Sociological Association. He conceptualized and led a series of scientific meetings in Slovenia and during eight world congresses of the International Sociological Association (ISA), in which he was also Chairman and Vice- Chairman of two of its research committees and co-founder of the working group of Sociology of local-global relations. Collaborations As a professor and researcher, Mlinar collaborated with numerous universities and scientific institutions around the world, including the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, University of Oregon, Eugene, State University of New York at Buffalo, Centre for International Studies – Cornell University, Ithaca, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Institute of Development Studies – University of Sussex, Brighton, Circom (Centre International de Recherches sur les Communautés Coopératives Rurales ), Tel Aviv, Istituto di sociologia internazionale, Gorizia, Instytut Filozofii i Socjologii, PAN, Warsaw, The Rockefeller Foundation Bellagio Center, Inter-University Centre for Postgraduate Studies Dubrovnik, \\"Inter-Agency Mission\\" (ILO, FAO, UNESCO, UNIDO) in Ceylon, Colombo, Wiener Institut für Entwicklungsfragen, Vienna, Bartlett School of Architecture and Planning, London, and the Faculty of Architecture, Belgrade.

History  As LGBT tourism began to expand more into the LGBT society as a new cultural phenomenon, LGBT cruises became one of the growing trends. Before the start of all-gay cruises, gay couples would go on predominantly straight cruises, then later on had small LGBT groups aboard on mainstream cruises. Now, the LGBT cruising phenomenon expanded its scale, resulting in the establishment of all-gay or all-lesbian cruises. It is contributing a great portion in the LGBT tourism, as the demand of gay and lesbian cruising companies and itineraries has been in a constant increase over the last 10 years. Some of the major LGBT cruising companies were established in the 1990s. Currently, there are over 15 U.S. companies that specifically specialize in LGBT cruising and over 75 itineraries. The LGBT cruises are preferred by gays and lesbians of all ages, as can be seen in the variation of age groups, from 20s up to 60s, 70s, and even 80s. It is said by Rich Campbell, the president and chief executive of Atlantis Events, that the average age out of 2,000 passengers on one of the cruises was around 40.  Services & facilities  LGBT cruising companies serve LGBT passengers on first-class cruises. LGBT cruises are international cruises, in which the passengers may visit 4 or 5 destinations abroad in about one week’s time. The cruises also provide personalized onboard assistance while visiting port cities, and also receive guidance on money exchange and anything else needed in traveling abroad. * Additional entertainment/ venues/ events on LGBT cruises # gay comedian performances # leading cabaret performances # special guest speakers # costume parties # toga parties # dating/newlywed games # disco and country dances  People on LGBT cruises & their behaviors = Customers  Passengers allowed on LGBT cruises must be at least 18 years old. If guests are within the age of 18 to 21, they must travel with a passenger over 25 years old in the same cabin. Single or couple, all gays and lesbians are welcomed to enjoy their journey on the cruises. There are few restrictions on customers depending on the types of cruises they want to join. For all-gay cruises, those are exclusively for gays, with only a small proportion of women and/or lesbians. On the other hand, if the cruises are lesbian-orientated, only lesbians can board them. For LGBT-friendly cruises, the passengers may be both LGBT and straight. The gay and lesbian family cruises allow LGBT parents to sail with their kids. = Customer behavior (reasons in choosing LGBT cruises) = There are few reasons in which the LGBT travelers choose LGBT cruises. First, they have opportunities to spend their vacation in a more LGBT-friendly environment, as they consider being in the atmosphere as a more significant factor than the destinations. Second, LGBT can be themselves in LGBT cruises with suitable security, atmosphere, and camaraderie, because they find that it is different from their daily lives of feeling stressful and constrained by the heterosexual environment. Third, the LGBT travelers can make other LGBT friends during the vacation. Fourth, the staff are friendly, polite, respectful and welcoming to its LGBT passengers. LGBT couples with children trend to join the LGBT cruises because being in a gay-friendly environment is an important factor to them. Since they have their children to care for, the homosexual parents would be conscious about how others treat their families as it could be effective on their children. Moreover, LGBT parents would actually consider the destinations of the cruises, in which the trip could be both family-friendly and gay-friendly. It is said that LGBT cruises will become a bigger trend in the coming future as the homosexual marriage are legalized in many countries, such as Canada and the Netherlands and the United States of America.  Staff  LGBT cruises’ staff members are responsible for organizing the events held on the cruises. They are trained to serve the LGBT passengers in a courteous and respectful way, just as in the same way as serving straight passengers.  Routes/Destinations  There are various routes for LGBT travelers to choose from, as more gay travel companies and agencies are organizing LGBT cruises to build up LGBT tourism. Some of the itineraries would be like the heterosexual cruises, with its destinations being just be the same like the normal one, which majority of tourists would choose when it comes to cruise holiday, like the Caribbeans. However, LGBT-friendly destinations are more welcomed by the LGBT travelers, which are called gay \\"hotspots\\", such as Mykonos or Ibiza in the Mediterranean. These areas are common destinations for homosexual travelers, especially during the summer. There are also cultural capitals like Barcelona, Venice, and Rome which are also popular, as these cities are filled with fabulous nightlife and delicate dining. Though the Caribbeans is a typical destination for most cruises, gay-friendly cities like the Dutch Antilles (Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao) would be specifically preferred by LGBT travelers.  Price/Promotion strategies  Comparing to the mainstream cruises, LGBT cruises’ price is more expensive. It may be due to the extra onboard parties and entertainers for the services and entertainment on the cruises. The main promotion strategy used by the cruise providers is the Internet. A home web page is used to give a general introduction, provide cruising schedules and make reservations. Some online networks are dedicated to connect the LGBT travelers to available businesses. The easy access of information and convenience benefit the customers.  Controversy surrounding the LGBT cruises  LGBT cruise may associate and arouse some negative behaviors caused by drunk passengers. There are also problems when LGBT cruises port on the countries that are not generous or acceptable about homosexuality. For example, like the Caribbean government refused LGBT cruises to land on their islands in the late 1990s, and the unwillingness still exist to this day. In addition, some residents of ports may be unhappy when the LGBT travelers show physical affection in public. Such as in Roseau, Dominica, in 2012, 2 gay men on a cruise were arrested, while in a port.

Its main purpose is to predict congestion states of a specific urban transport network and propose improvements in the traffic network. Researches rely on three different informations. Historical and recent information of a traffic network about its density and flow, a model of the transport network infrastructure and algorithms referring to both spatial and temporal dimensions. The final objective is to provide a better optimization of the traffic infrastructure such as traffic lights. Those optimizations should result into a decrease of the travel times, pollution and fuel consumption. To survey and manage traffic infrastructures, cities can provide themselves with Intelligent transportation system (ITS) which are especially meaningful in densely urbanized areas. They provide the possibility to better analyze and manage a transport network impact of external factors within a short term vision, with the daily fluctuate density of the transport network. And over a long term vision, with changes as th increase of motorization, urbanization, population growth and changes in population density. At another end, motorists can use Advanced traveler information system (ATIS) which bring processed data to the end user to help him taking the best directions. Researchers work on different level to make progress into traffic analysis, by collecting traffic data from different sources, modeling traffic flows and network, and developing algorithms to either predict traffic states in a far or a short-term future.  Data Source  The sources of which data can be collected to create a model are a key choice to the model and algorithms. Data can be collected through non embedded traffic monitoring devices as loop detectors. Those devices can register the number of vehicles passed in an interval giving the occupancy. Other sources are literally embedded into vehicles and collect position or other vehicle behavior during its full trip. Such devices can be wireless sensors like Global positioning system (GPS), floating car data (FCD) and mobile phones. These data can eventually be collected in real-time.  Traffic Flow Models = Level of detail classification  Depending on how much details a model provide, it can be classified into several categories. = Microscopic models = Vehicles and drivers behavior are described with high details and individually on the traffic stream.  Car-following models  Based on the process of a vehicle following another, car-following models appeared in the sixties, being one of the first microscopic modelling approach.  Safe-distance models  Used to determine the distance headway between a vehicle and its predecessor. One of the simplest model in this category is the Pipe's rule, the basic assumption of this model is \\"A good rule for following another vehicle at a safe distance is to allow yourself at least the length of a car between your vehicle and the vehicle ahead for every ten miles per hour (16.1 km/hr) of speed at which you are traveling\\" According to Pipe's car-following model, the minimum safe distance headway increases linearly with speed. A similar model was proposed by Forbes et al, Forbes' model considered the reaction time needed for the following car's driver to perceive the need to accelerate or decelerate. When compared to field measurement, a slight difference in the minimum distance headway at low and high speeds is observed.  Stimulus-response car-following models  Drivers try to conform to the behavior of the preceding vehicle, this process is based on the following principle : > response = sensitivity × stimulus Usually the response correspond the acceleration or braking of the following vehicle, delayed by a reaction time. Driver's sensitivity has been denoted in numerous work including the work of Chandler et al. (1958), Gazis et al. (1961) and Leutzbach (1988).  Psycho-spacing models  Car-following models presume that the driver react to small changes in the precedent vehicle velocity even when the headway distances are very large or small. To address this problem, perceptual psychology insights have been used to show how drivers are subject to limitation in the perception of stimuli to which they are subjects. Basic behavioral rules of such models are : * At large spacings, the following driver is not influenced by velocity differences. * At small spacings, some combinations of relative velocities and distance headways do not yield a response of the following driver, because the relative motion is too small. The psycho-spacing models ability of describing transient traffic flow behaviour like capacity drop, and stability of wide jams (jams in which the velocity of traffic is near zero, and which propagate upstream with a near constant velocity) has been addressed by Krauss et al. (1999).  Microscopic Simulation models  Nowadays availability of fast personal computers has seen the development of a large number of microscopic simulation models usually based on the psycho-spacing modelling paradigm.  Cellular automaton models  Appeared recently in the domain of microscopic traffic flow theory, the cellular automaton describe the traffic system as a lattice of cells of equal size (typically 7.5m). A CA-model will describe the way a vehicle moves from cell to cell.  Particle models  Although these models distinguish and describe the vehicles individually, their behavior is described by aggregate equations of motions like in a macroscopic traffic flow model. = Submicroscopic models = Like microscopic models, vehicles and drivers behavior are described but submicroscopic models go even further by describing the vehicle control behavior and the functioning of specific parts of the vehicle. = Mesoscopic models = A mesoscopic model does not distinguish nor trace individual vehicles, but expresses the probability of having a given vehicle at a given position, time and velocity. = Macroscopic models = Traffic is represented at a high level of aggregation, thus not distinguishing vehicles individually.  Scale of application  The scale of application is determined by the size of the area on which the model is applied, from the portion of a roadway to an entire city or an even bigger area.  Urban traffic analysis  In recent articles, percolation theory has been applied to study traffic in a city. The quality of the global traffic in a city at a given time can be characterized by a single parameter, the percolation critical threshold. The critical threshold represents the velocity below which one can travel in a large fraction of the city network. Above this threshold the city network break into clusters of many sizes and one can travel within relatively small neighborhoods. This novel method is also able to identify repetitive traffic bottlenecks . Critical exponents characterizing the cluster size distribution of good traffic are similar to those of percolation theory. It is also found that during rush hours the traffic network can have several metastable states of different network sizes and the alternate between these states. An empirical study regarding the spatial-temporal size distribution of traffic jams has been performed by Zhang et al . They found an approximate universal power law for the jam sizes distribution in different cities. A method to identify functional clusters of spatial-temporal streets that represent fluent traffic flow in a city has been developed by Serok et al..  Traffic prediction algorithms  Having models of traffic network data gathering several characteristics depending of its nature, there are many approaches and algorithms to harness them into practical cases.  Forecast algorithms  The methods historically used to determine forecast traffic states and density were thought to render a single- point forecasting result. These methods use only past measurements of identical situations. So, they can predict a density at a specific location. The following methods and algorithms uses this simple past-data approach but distinguish themselves by different criteria. To begin with, statical methods are based on auto-regression and moving average methods. They are implemented in algorithms such as ARMA, ARIMA (Integrated ARMA) or SARIMA (seasonal ARIMA). Other statistical methods based on non-parametric regression and variants exists as well. Using machine learning to forecast traffic models is being used based on multiple different algorithms including Vector regression (SVR), time-delay neural network (TDNN) or Bayesian network. Newer methodologies taking into account data relational structure, forecast traffic density in time relying on linked data from multiple spatial positions at different moments in time, event future already predicted data. Studies using data relational structures have mainly used STARIMA models (space-time ARIMA), Kalman filters and Structural Time Series model. The use of a Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) framework is very effective to improve predictive accuracy of relational structured data. Statistical Relational Learning matches very well this field of research by its ability to describe dependencies and relations and include background knowledge in the model, as in a transportation network. Models generated with a Statistical Relational Learning method can represent a wide set of location thanks to its ability to perform concurrent grouping and regressions on its multiple sources and information levels. This makes it possible to such model to predict traffic conditions out of a network in a single interference process.  Specifications of model traffic characteristics  The existing multiple process algorithms use different proven methodologies, approaches and characteristics. Some of them have been noticed previously. Algorithms may differ depending on the data of their model is based on or the way they structure and link these data. So, models, often close to the way they manage data, can focus on either traffic volumes, travel speed, occupancy, road capacities etc. To do so, models often range from ARIMA to Dynamic Generalized Linear Models (Dynamic GLM) and Neural Networks. To output useful data for ITS, algorithms which often are closely linked to the structure and capabilities of their model, will use a range of specifications considering the capabilities of the model. Algorithms often wants to forecast data in a long term or short term perspective. To do so, their specifications ranged from Kalman filtering , exponential filtering, nonparametric statistical methods, spectral and cross-spectral analyses and sequential learning, to cusp catastrophe theory.

Systemic design intends to develop methodologies and approaches that help to integrate systems thinking with design towards sustainability at environmental, social and economic level. It is a pluralistic initiative where many different approaches are encouraged to thrive and where dialogue and organic development of new practices is central. The systemic design dialogue is driven by the Relating Systems Thinking and Design (RSD) symposium series resulting in published proceedings and several special issues on systemic design in the scientific design research journal FORMakademisk. Academic groups Systemic design is being developed within the design practice and through the Systemic Design Research Network, focusing on different aspects of the issue. Different academic groups have been facing Systemic Design both in their teaching and researching activities: * Systems oriented design is an example of a systemic design approach being used at the Oslo School of Architecture and Design. Systems Oriented Design seeks to train the designers ability to cope with a larger degree of complexity and to take more responsibility for the consequences of their actions. Holistic perspectives, ethics and sustainability as well as cultural, organizational, economic, and technical considerations are central. * At Politecnico di Torino, the Master of Science in Systemic Design is active and it is named after Aurelio Peccei, in that place didactics and research are growing up together.Barbero, S. (2016). Opportunities and challenges in teaching Systemic Design. The evolution of the Open Systems master courses at Politecnico di Torino. Proceedings of the 6th International Forum of Design as a Process, Universitat Politècnica de València, Valencia, pp. 57-66. This approach, put forward by Luigi Bistagnino, focuses on the relationship between the inputs and the outputs of a system, by viewing waste as a valuable resource.http://www.systemicdesign.org/ Research on Systemic Design at Politecnico di Torino is now led by Silvia Barbero. * The Strategic Foresight and innovation master program at OCAD University http://www.ocadu.ca/academics/graduate-studies/strategic-foresight-and- innovation.htm/ Toronto is a well known systemic design initiative led by Peter H. Jones. Emphasis is placed on teaching complex problem finding, framing and solving, to envision and develop sustainable futures. * At the National Institute of Design (NID) India there is a group of academics at the design department, established by late Prof M.P. Ranjan and now led by Praveen Nahar among many other faculty. Systems Thinking and Design is part of the academic programme at NID, it involves the application of the systems approach towards complex issues and wicked problems from socio-cultural-economic- environmental perspective with high level of ambiguity, uncertainty and complexity. * Alex Ryan is leading a group of systemic designers at the Government of Alberta. They combine systemic design and strategic foresight to redesign the policy development process in government. * At the University of Montreal, the Master's degree in Applied Science in Design, Design and Complexity (DESCO) https://admission.umontreal.ca/programmes/maitrise-en- amenagement-option-design-et-complexite/ track focuses on design activities and aims to train students in complex thinking, so as to prepare them to act and think as true integrators, in contexts that are increasingly complex. Areas of focus include: sustainable design and eco-design, social design, project management, digital design, new technologies, innovation, strategic design, game design, interaction design, service design, experience design and collaborative design. History= From complexity theories to systemic design  The theories about complexity help the management of an entire system and the suggested design approaches help the planning of different divergent elements. The complexity theories evolved on the basis that living systems continually draw upon external sources of energy and maintain a stable state of low entropy, on the basis of the General Systems Theory by Karl Ludwig von Bertalanffy (1968).von Bertalanffy, K.L. (1968) General System theory: Foundations, Development, Applications, George Braziller, New York Some of the next rationales applied those theories also on artificial systems: complexity models of living systems address also productive models with their organizations and management, where the relationships between parts are more important than the parts themselves. Treating productive organizations as complex adaptive systems allows a new management model to emerge in economical, social and environmental benefits (Pisek and Wilson, 2001 Pisek, P.E. and Wilson, T. (2001) Complexity, Leadership, And Management In Healthcare Organizations, British Medical Journal, Vol.323, pp.746-749.). In that field, Cluster Theory (Porter, 1990 Porter, M.E. (1990) Competitive Advantage of Nations, Free Press, New York.) evolved in more environmentally sensitive theories, like Industrial Ecology (Frosh and Gallopoulos, 1989 Frosh, R.A. and Gallopoulos, N.E. (1989) Strategies for Manufacturing, Scientific American, Vol.3 No.189, pp.94-102. ) and Industrial Symbiosis (Chertow, 2000 Chertow, M.R. (2000) Industrial Symbiosis: Literature and Taxonomy, Annual Review of Energy and Environment, Vol.25, pp.313-337). In 1994, Gunter Pauli and Heitor Gurgulino de Souza founded the research institute Zero Emission Research and Initiatives (ZERI), starting from the idea that progress should embed respect for the environment and natural techniques that will allow production processes to be part of the ecosystem. The design thinking, as Buchanan (1992) said,Buchanan, R. (1992) Wicked Problems in Design Thinking, Design Issues, Vol.8 No.2, pp.5-21. means the way to creatively and strategically reconfigure a design concept on a situation with systemic integration. This needs a strong inter- and trans-disciplinarity during the design phase (Fuller, 1981 Fuller R.B. (1981), Critical Path, St. Martin’s Press, New York.), with the increasing involvement of different disciplines including urban planning, public policy, business management and environmental sciences (Chertow et al., 2004 Chertow, M. R., Ashton, W. and Kuppali, R. (2004) The Industrial Symbiosis Research Symposium at Yale: Advancing the Study of Industry and Environment, Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, New Haven.). Systems and complexity theories and design thinking redesign a pretty new discipline: the Systemic Design, which is located as a human-centred systems-oriented design practice (Bistagnino, 2011;Bistagnino, L. (2011) Systemic Design: Designing the productive and environmental sustainability, 2nd ed., Slow Food, Bra. Sevaldson, 2011;Sevaldson, B. (2011).

Toso at al., 2012 Toso D., Barbero S., Tamborrini P. (2012) Systemic Design: Beyond Ecodesign. Proceedings of the 18th Annual International Sustainable Development Research Conference, University of Hull, UK).  Systemic design today  The contemporary debate on Systemic design started with the Relating Systems Thinking and Design Symposia series (RSD) on the initiative of Birger Sevaldson at the Oslo School of Architecture and Design in 2012. Amongst the invited participants were Harold G. Nelson, Peter H. Jones and Alex Ryan. An initial meeting was held in Oslo to consolidate the possibility of building a future network. Other participants were Michael Hensel, Colleen Ponto and others. The RSD seminars started in the context of Systems Oriented Design (SOD). In 2013-14 a discussion was initiated by Birger Sevaldson questioning the framework of the new emerging network. The network changed its name to Systemic Design allowing it to grow more pluralistically while SOD could develop more specially. The Systemic Design Research Network was founded shortly after on the initiative of Peter H. Jones and with Harold Nelson, Alex Ryan and Birger Sevaldson as co-founders. Background Systems thinking in design has a long history with people like Christpher Alexander, Horst Rittel, Russl Ackoff, Bela Banathy, Ranulph Glanville, M.P.Ranjan, Harold Nelson and others. Also the main systems theories and models were known and applied in design since their beginning. Despite this Systems Thinking has never become mainstream in design. The reasons for this might be that the prescribed techniques and approaches were too technical and did not fit well to an organic design process. The systemic design initiative is addressing this problem by seeking new connections and relations between systems thinking and designerly ways of working.

The company was one of the 100 largest in the county of Buskerud.http://www.laagendalsposten.no/nyheter/de-100-storste- bedriftene-1.8092510 The privately owned company operates in Norway and Sweden and employs 260. The company's main office is located in Drammen, it also has offices in Trondheim and Strängnäs. The company name Eneas was coined in 2005 when Norsk Energirevisjon AS and Encom AS merged. It has contributed with funding for the local cultural life and sporting organizations such as Bellona, Strømsgodset Bandhttp://www.stromsgodsetmusikkorps.no/ and other sporting clubs.  History  Eneas Energy was founded in 1995 by Thomas Hakavik, Olav Sølverud and Bjørn-Aksel Hjelmtvedt, under the name Norsk Energirevisjon AS (NERAS). The company dealt solely in energy auditing its first year. In 1996, NERAS established Encom AS, a company that introduced an electricity metering service for commercial buildings. In 1998, NERAS developed energy optimizing services and their first Energy Performance Contracting (EPC) project was signed. NERAS expanded into Sweden in 1999 and established an office in Gothenburg to serve the Swedish commercial market with energy auditing services. The same year, they opened the call-center NERAS Direkte AS in Trondheim to sell their internal and external services via telemarketing. NERAS later moved the Swedish head office from Gothenburg to Strängnäs in 2006. In 2001, the founders sold 50% of the company to Statoil. The 50-50 ownership continued for five years until 2005 when management bought out Statoil ASA and opened the door for strategic investors with backgrounds from industry (mainly from Orkla ASA) and large-scale real estate. The employees now owned approximately 30% of the company and the new ownership brought about the merger between NERAS and Encom, thus resulting in Eneas Energy AS. As a product of the merger they created Samköp av El in 2006 and established Neras Direkt AB with TM business from the Swedish city of Hackås, their business concentrated more on the internal services. The company later moved to the Swedish city of Östersund. Looking to increase focus on ENØK and expertise on building automation, Eneas Energy bought Intent AS I 2007. At the same time, they established a power management environment by founding Powertrade I Norway and Sweden. Powertrade was sold in its entirety to Ringeriks-Kraft AS after three years. In 2009, Eneas Energy bought up EnergiCompaniet AS to supplement their growing expertise in ENØK and project management. Now both EngergiCompaniet and Intent have merged with Eneas Energy AS. In 2009, Eneas Energy also established a strategy to gain ground in Germany. They purchased Nord Energie GmbH in Berlin and transferred their power management services to a collaboration with a German telemarketing agency. After the buy-out, the name was changed to Eneas Energy GmbH and the company has since expanded its product line to include energy auditing services. Business in Germany was shut down during the summer of 2012. In September 2010, London-based Palamon Capital Partners Ltd bought up 80% of Eneas Energy AS, making them the largest shareholder. The employees owned the remaining 20% of the shares. On January 3, 2012, after 17 years of leading the company, Thomas Hakavik handed over his role as CEO to Andrè Løvestam and took on the position of Director of Development. This did not last long as Løvestram resigned from CEO in the summer of 2013 and Hakavik was back at the reins as CEO. In November 2010, Eneas Energy started a new focus area – insurance brokerage, and on June 15, 2011, the Norwegian Ministry of Finance approved the entity Eneas Broker as a cross-border insurance provider able to operate in both Norway and Sweden.

It is a Hindu pilgrimage centre located in the Bay of Bengal. As per Hindu legend, the nine mud images of the planetary deities, have been believed to have built by Rama, an avatar of Vishnu. The temple is a famous pilgrimage centre in the region where pilgrims perform rites for their forefathers. It is also a part of popular tourist circuit in the region along with the Ramanathaswamy Temple at Rameswaram and Adi Jagannatha Perumal Temple at Thirupullanai. The temple was originally maintained and administered by the Sivaganga Devasthanam till 2012, when it was taken up by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend Image of the Navagrahas in the Bay As per Hindu legend, Ravana, a king, obtained boons from Brahma that he should be killed by any celestial deity or gods. To slay the demon, Vishnu took a human avatar Rama. Ravana came to the forest where Rama and Sita were staying incognito and abducted her. Rama was trying to build a bridge to Lanka to relieve his wife Sita from Ashokavana where Ravana held her hostage. The bridge was proposed to be built from Dhanushkodi, the nearest point to reach Lanka. Rama started doing pooja seeking favours from Hindu god Ganesha, as is done first during any Hindu religious worship. The place where he did the worship is believed to be the Vinayagar temple at Uppur. The second step for Hindu worship ritual is the Navagraha pooja, worshipping the nine planetary deities, which was done at Navapashanam. Rama is believed to have installed the Navagrahas with his own hands with the clay from the place. Architecture Navapashanam is located in Devipattinam, a town located on the East Coast Road. The nine image of the planetary deities is located in a matrix arrangement in the Bay of Bengal. There is an entrance arch on the shores and a pathway long leads to the sanctum. There is a pathway and four stepways leading to the waters in the four cardinal directions. Festivals The temple was originally maintained and administered by the Sivaganga Devasthanam till 2012, when it was taken up by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. The temple is open from 4:30 a.m. to 6:30 pm on all days. The major festivals celebrated in the temple are the ten-day Aadi Amavasai, the full moon day on the Tamil month of Aadi (June - July) and Thai amavasai during the Tamil month of Thai (January - February). During these days, there are close to one lakh pilgrims who visit the place. The place is commonly visited by pilgrims doing their rites for their forefathers. It is also a part of popular tourist circuit in the region along with the Ramanathaswamy Temple at Rameswaram and Adi Jagannatha Perumal Temple at Thirupullanai. The practise of offering nine different type of grains specific to each of the nine planets is commonly followed in the temple. Unlike other South Indian temples, where people are not allowed to touch the presiding deities, pilgrims can do their own worship on the images.

The Nolan amphora is a variant style of the amphora jar, a common artifact of Greek and Roman pottery. Nolan amphorae are characterized by a neck that is longer and narrower than in traditional neck amphorae, along with ribbed handles or straps that join the piece at the base of the neck. They are named for the archaeological site at Nola, Italy, where an abundance of these vessels have been unearthed.  Historical origins  The distinct shape and style of the Nolan amphora is thought to have emerged from two styles of older Attic black-figure pottery: the black-figure panel amphora and the red-bodied amphora. It has been theorized that the former is the closest predecessor of the Nolan shape, given that it has both the elongated neck of the red-bodied amphora and the smaller size associated with Nolan amphorae. Nolan vessels, however, do not always have decorated palmettes characteristic of black-figure panel amphora. Both black-figure and red-figure neck amphorae were first created in Athens, with roots in Protoattic vases. Nolan amphorae feature almost exclusively red-figure ornamentation. The style would have been disseminated throughout Greece, Italy, and later the Roman Empire via trade with Greek, particularly Athenian, artisans. Early examples of such vases were known to have been created for trade in Etruscan markets.

Life Bondarev was born a serf in southern Russia. When he was 37, his owner signed a commission to send him to the army for a 25-year conscription period. The conscription forcibly separated Bondarev from his wife and children. In the military, he renounced his Russian Orthodox faith and joined the Subbotniks, a Sabbatarian sect. In 1867 he was arrested for apostasy, discharged from the army, and sentenced to a life in exile on the Yenisei River in far eastern Russia.Bartlett, Rosamund (2011) Tolstoy: A Russian Life, pp. 318–320.

He also developed his philosophy of labor, which he wrote about in his treatise, The Triumph of the Farmer or Industry and Parasitism. His philosophy centered on the concept of \\"bread- labor\\", by which all men, regardless of social status, are morally obligated to perform the manual labor necessary to sustain themselves.Alston, Charlotte (2013) Tolstoy and his Disciples: The History of a Radical International Movement, pp. 23–24.

The work details Bondarev's labor philosophy, in particular his idea of \\"bread-labor\\", by which every man is responsible for the physical labor required to sustain himself. The treatise captivated writer Leo Tolstoy, who began a long correspondence with Bondarev and endeavored for years to see the work published. An abbreviated version was published in 1888, and the full work was published in 1906. Contents The work details Bondarev's philosophy on morality and labor. In particular, Bondarev explicates the theory of \\"bread-labor\\", arguing that all men, regardless of social position, are morally obligated to perform the physical labor necessary to sustain themselves.Bartlett 2011, p. 318. Bondarev took his inspiration from Genesis 3:19, in which God tells Adam after banishing him from the Garden of Eden: \\"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken.....\\" Bondarev interprets this not as a curse, but as a commandment that will lead to salvation if followed. According to Bondarev, social inequality, exploitation, and strife are the product of society's failure to adhere to the principal of bread-labor, which he regards as an inexorable moral and religious imperative.Donskov 2005, p. 52.Holman 2011, pp. 199–200. Published versions of the text also generally include an essay by Leo Tolstoy, sometimes known as \\"Industry and Idleness\\", which introduces and elaborates upon the work and its ideas. History Bondarev was born a serf in southern Russia. In the 1850s, his owner commissioned him into the army for a 25-year term, forcibly separating Bondarev from his wife and children. In the army he abandoned his Russian Orthodox faith and became a Subbotnik. In 1867, he was arrested for apostasy and exiled to a remote village on the Yenisey River for life.Bartlett 2011, p. 320. As the village's only literate resident, Bondarev founded a school. He spent the next 30 years teaching, farming and developing his philosophy of labor. The culmination of his life's work was his treatise The Triumph of the Farmer or Industry and Parasitism, which he composed primarily in the late 1870s and early 1880s.Alston 2013, pp. 23–24 In July 1885, another political exile sent a copy of The Triumph of the Farmer to Leo Tolstoy, who had read of it earlier in a journal. Tolstoy was captivated, saying he agreed with \\"everything in\\" the manuscript, and started a correspondence with Bondarev, which lasted until Bondarev's death in 1898.Bartlett 2011, pp. 318–320.Donskov 2005, pp. 47–48. Tolstoy went to great lengths to get the work published, but its radical content ran it afoul of government censors. Censors excised it at the last moment from the journal Russian Wealth in 1886 and from Russian Antiquity in 1888. Later in 1888, the weekly Russkoye Delo (The Russian Cause) published an abbreviated version edited by Tolstoy, who also provided a supplementary essay, in issues 12 and 13. The Ministry of Internal Affairs issued a caution and all copies were later destroyed. Editions and translations The Triumph of the Farmer or Industry and Parasitism was translated into French and English in 1890. Tolstoy worked with the French publishers to produce the translation by V. Tseytline and A. Pages, released in Paris as Le'on Tolstoi et Timothe' Bondareff: Le travail. That year Mary Cruger produced an English translation in Toronto under the name Labour: The Divine Command. This was based not on the original Russian, but on Tseytline and Page's French version. The same year in Chicago James F. Alvord produced another English translation, also adapted from the French version, under the title Toil.Leo Tolstoy, Timofeĭ Bondarev (1890). Toil. Trans. James F. Alvord. Charles H. Sergel & Co. Bondarev was unhappy with the quality of the translation and with the abridgments, and communicated his displeasure to both Tolstoy and to Gleb Uspensky. Finally in 1906, eight years after Bondarev's death, Tolstoy's publishing house The Intermediary published The Triumph of the Farmer or Industry and Parasitism in full, along with Tolstoy's introduction.

Background The centre was founded by Dashnor Kokonozi, also its first director, in the early 1990s after the breakdown of law and order in Albania following the ousting of the Communist regime led to looting of cultural heritage objects. Requests to Interpol for help tracing looted objects revealed a lack of records in Albania and Kokonozi persuaded the World Bank to fund the creation of the first national inventory.Albania Struggles to Catalogue its Unknown Treasures. BalkanInsight, 30 October 2010. Retrieved 10 November 2015. Scope An icon attributed to Kostandin Shpataraku, bought by Hetem Ramadani in 2010 from a private collection, that had not previously been entered on the NCCPI. The centre aims to register all of Albania's cultural assets held by museums, galleries, art institutes, religious communities and private collectors by creating an illustrated \\"passport\\" for each item recording the item type, name, author, owner, where it was found, the current location and the period or movement to which it belongs. Coverage Although the registration of objects held by institutions is almost complete, the registration of objects in private ownership has hardly begun due to a lack of public awareness of the scheme, the lack of awareness by the public of the value of items held privately, and the wish of some individuals to keep their ownership of heritage items private so that they can be traded confidentially on the illegal art market. The register is divided into two parts, those where the location is known, and those which are lost. Staff The first director of the NCCPI was Dashnor Kokonozi. The director in 2010 was Izet Duraku.

People hope to beg for peace and be blessed from the gods. It is one of the most important pieces of cultural heritage in Hong Kong. Background The Fire Dragon Dance in Pok Fu Lam is similar to Tai Hang's. The origin of Fire Dragon Dance can be traced to over hundred years ago in Tai Hang. After suffering from a storm, the people of Pok Fu Lam Village were attacked by a snake that destroyed the village's peace. The villagers then caught the snake and killed it. In the days following the snake's death, plague broke out in Tai Hang. At that time, an elderly villager received Buddha's guidance in his dream that told them to hold The Fire Dragon Dance in the Mid-Autumn festival to drive away the plague. This succeeded and people began to believe that The Fire Dragon Dance could drive away bad luck and plague. So the tradition of The Fire Dragon Dance has been upheld until now and the location spread from Tai Hang to Po Fu Lam. The Fire Dragon Dance is the main activity of the Mid-Autumn celebration in Pok Fu Lam, and is a traditional custom of the Hakka ethnic group from China. The Fire Dragon Pok Fu Lam fire dragons are incense-lit, straw- filled dragons. The bodies and heads of the Fire Dragon are made of bamboo sticks, metal wire and straw (pearl grass) imported from China, with a length over 10 meters. The Dragon is supported by bamboo poles which will become handles for the dancers. Villagers adhere burning incense sticks to the skeletons and the burning incense sticks constitute the body of the Fire Dragon. Several large balls or pomelos pierced with wooden sticks are used for dragonballs. In tradition's centennial anniversary in year 2010, leader of Pok Fu Lam village fire dragon dance team, Mr. Ng Kwong-nam, made an attempt for Guinness World Records. He made a dragon which was officially measured to be over 73 meters long. It used 40 000 incense sticks and had 36 segments and two people for each segment. Activities The fire dragon dance starts at 6:30 p.m. on the mid-autumn Festival. At the entrance of Pokfulam village, there will be an altar, and incense will be burned at the altar to worship the fire dragon. Then, the villager will paint the eyes of the dragon, which is called \\"waak lung dim zing\\" in Chinese. At 7 o'clock p.m., the fire dragon dance starts. The fire dragon will first dance around the Pokfulam road. It will then go to the Lin Ning Spirit and Xi Guo Da Wang Temple to pray, and enter the village after the pray. In fact, the fire dragon will pass through main streets: Wai Tsai, Lung Zi Duk and Coi jyun to visit each family in the village and bless the villagers. Afterwards, the fire dragon will return to the entrance of the village and other people can incense at the fire dragon and pray for bless there. The fire dragon will then be moved to the Waterfall Bay beach through Pokfulam road, Wah Fu Road and Waterfall Bay Road. spinning on the bus stop at the Pokfulam road twice and swaying at the Wah Fu Road in front of the Wah Lok House twice again. Finally, when it is arrived to the Waterfall Bay beach, the villagers will wear life jacket and bring back the dragon to the sea, which means \\"cong lung kwai hoi\\" in Chinese. The whole event will end at 11:30 p.m. Location=Layout and History of Pok Fu Lam Village Pok Fu Lam village is located on Hong Kong Island on Pok Fu Lam Road. The village is characterized by its narrow lanes and twisting alleys that form a complex network of paths through a collection of traditional one- storey buildings that feature walls of hay and stone and pitched roof tiles, some of which have been there since 1886, the establishment date for the original dairy farm company. The village houses around two thousand villagers today. The village is also home to some religious structures such as the Li Ling Pagoda and the Bogong Shrine. Transport The most direct route to Pok Fu Lam village would be to take Citybus route 91 from Central Ferry Pier Bus Terminus. The bus ride will take around 13 minutes with favorable traffic. Pok Fu Lam is the 21st stop. The bus ride will cost $6.5. Values The tradition of fire dragon dance began in Pokfulam village about 200 years ago, it witnessed the changes of both the village and Hong Kong, thus the historical culture of the dance to villagers and Hong Kong people is significant and momentous. To the villagers Pokfulam's fire dragon dance is not as popular as Tai Hang's, but the process of constructing the dragon is a whole community participation. Despite the secret making method, other villagers can take part in the event: help carry buckets, move heavy stones, prepare turnip puddings. In fact, it aims to build a sense of community through the division of work, and strengthen the bonding among villagers. Moreover, the fire dragon dance is literally meant blessing to the village as it will pass through each houses and lanes, which symbolizes the dismissal of pestilence and wish the health for all villagers. To Hong Kong Pokfulam's fire dragon dance is a historical architecture, the villagers promote their community as part of industrial and agricultural heritage of Hong Kong. The villagers also willing to introduce visitors the ancient design, structure and reconstructions of the houses as education. The outsiders, men or women, could even be involved in part of the ‘dancing’ process, for instance, putting the incense sticks into the dragon, holding it and rushing down to the sea with other villagers. This is unlike the Tai Hang's. It is an important folk custom that expresses fraternity and social harmony. The World Monument Fund claimed it as the modern appearance of the village belies its importance to the history of Hong Kong, contributing to the preservation of the diversity of this urban space.

Students are requested to complete an individual project in written (between 1,500 and 4,000 words) or non-written form and either in Chinese or English based on the Liberal Studies Curriculum. With the aims of enhancing students to be ‘independent’ and ‘self-directed’ learners, the project requires students to integrate knowledge, concepts and skills and analyze their issues from multiple perspectives in the study.  Content  The Independent Enquiry Study (IES) is divided into three parts : Project proposal, Data collection and Product . Students are required to choose a topic on their own which is specific and feasible enough for study . After setting up the topic and title, students can start the learning and study process through the collection of useful and helpful data by various ways, such as questionnaire, interview, observation, survey etc. During the process of collection of data, students are required to perform their skill of data analysis in multiple perspectives and the record the result of data they have collected . After all, when it comes to the final products, students are required to hand in their final products in two forms : written and non-written forms . For written forms, students need to hand in all the materials and data they have collected with the learning reflection in their final products in 1,500 and 4,000 words. For non-written form, students need to present their final products to their teacher in the class using powerpoint with diagrams which can help them to present their data and topic .  Marks Allocation  IES contributes to 20% of the final score of Liberal Studies in HKDSE. There are three types of assessments, including ‘Process’, ‘Project Proposal’ and ‘Product’. Each stage consists of nine marks. For ‘Process’, students are tested on their content, independent thinking, communication skills and effort. In ‘Project Proposal’ stage, students getting high marks require to define the issue well, collect relevant information, use appropriate concepts and develop a comprehensive plan (P.39). ‘Product’ stage assesses students’ performances of providing data, findings, new ideas, suggestions and reflections.  Moderation of IES score in the HKDSE  According to Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority (2010), moderation guarantees the comparability of assessment standards and scores across schools and from year to year. It determinates the performance levels of individual students and also schools compared to the other students in the same school and other schools by statistical moderation and expert judgement moderation. Statistical moderation uses students’ scores in the public examination as reference and analyses the samples sent by the schools. Expert judgement moderation adjusts group performance level with reference to review of samples of students’ work, assisted with statistical techniques(P.10).  Intended Learning Outcomes  Developing student’s higher-order thinking and communication skills After completing The Independent Enquiry Study, students will be able to analyze appropriate findings from various perspectives or stakeholders related to the concerned topic. Developing student’s a sense of exploration, discovery and independent thinking In IES, students are required to collect greatly practical data in the assessment of “ Data collection’’. As a result, students will be able to classify and deploy the data and construct their own ideas after this process. Generalizing feasible solutions and outcomes in a structured way When compiling the assessment of “Product’’, students should construct fruitful opinions with reasonable arguments and well-supported reflections. Therefore, students will be able to develop effective solutions and appraise the learning progress. Demonstrating the use of hypotheses and focus questions in studying an issue For the assessment of “Project Proposal’’, students should hypothesize the foreseeable implications and questions they focused for the inquiry. They will be able to generate plans for writing by hypotheses and focus questions consequently. Broadening their horizons As regard to IES, it aims to explore knowledge of an issue, which affects our society and the world. Students will be able to demonstrate knowledge in the study of Liberal Art through researching different perspectives of an issue. Moreover, they would be likely to widen their horizons. Catering for student’s interest and inclination Every student should design their own topics, methodology and scope by themselves. It provides an opportunity for them to be self-reliant learners. Thus, they will be able to set plans, systemize the plans and dealing with problems. Preparing students for lifelong learning and challenges Whichever topics are used, students will be able to understand the influence of social, national and global changes and its implications. The duration of IES gives students longer consideration to analysis the inquiry which cannot be easily accessed by conventional written examination.  Arguments of Cancelling IES  Some students and schools have doubts about the teaching value of the IES. Some students even claim that they are suffering from the IES. The IES contributes to 20% of the final score of Liberal Studies in HKDSE, which will not affect the final score of the student as a whole subject. However, students needed to spend their whole senior secondary school life which may take them 3 years to deal with the IES in order to guarantee this 20% of marks. Students and teachers are complaining because it is time- consuming and it is too difficult for a secondary school student. Therefore, some people suggested to cancel the IES for the students best interest. After the major review on April 2014, a new guideline has been introduced which will help students to compete their IES in a “more focused manner”. In another word, the IES will be easier for students starting from September 2014. However, the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority still has no plan on cancelling the IES as students and teachers wanted to.

The little information we have about him derives from the Satires of Horace and some letters of Cicero.

Such identification was rejected by André Dacier, in his edition of the works of Horace, but few scholars agreed with him until Karl Kirchner presented a detailed argument for the interpretation of Dacier.De utroque Tigellio in Karl Kirchner, Questiones horatianae, Leipzig, 1834 According to Berthold Ullman however, the version of the scholiasts can not be excluded nor Kirchner's arguments are irrefutable. The Tigellius mentioned in some verses of Satires is in fact the same mentioned by Cicero in some of his letters.B. Ullman, cit., p. 270 Cicero, Horace and Licinius Macer Calvus used to call him either Tigellius or Sardus Tigellius (\\"Tigellius the Sardinian\\"), and never Hermogenes.

The few alleged ink inscriptions showing his name are drawn very sloppily, and the reading and thus whole existence of king \\"Crocodile\\" are highly disputed. His tomb is unknown.  Name sources  The proposed existence of Crocodile is based on Günter Dreyer's and Edwin van den Brink's essays. They are convinced that Crocodile was a local king who ruled at the region of Tarkhan. According to Dreyer, Crocodile's name appears in black ink inscriptions on burnt earthen jars and on several seal impressions found in tomb TT 1549 at Tarkhan and tomb B-414 at Abydos. He sees a crawling crocodile and a rope curl beneath it and reads Shendjw (\\"the subduer\\"). Van den Brink thinks alike and reads Shendjw, too, but sees only a large rope curl sign inside the serekh.  Reign and datation  Almost nothing is known about Crocodile's reign. If he existed, he might have had his capital at Tarkhan, where his proposed tomb was excavated. Dreyer places him in a time shortly before the kings Iry-Hor, Ka and Narmer. He points to guiding inscriptions on the jars mentioning a Hen-mehw (\\"brought from Lower Egypt\\"). This specific diction of designations of origin is archaeologically proven for the time before three mentioned kings, from King Ka onward, it was Inj-mehw (with the same meaning). One interesting artifact that possibly depicts King Crocodile, was found at Hierakonpolis in the so- called Main deposit. The artifact is a piece of a broken mace head which shows traces of a once completed relief scene. The conserved part of the relief shows the head and upper torso of a seated king figure inside a hebsed- pavilion. It wears the Red Crown of Upper Egypt, a hebsed cloak and a flail. Right before the face of the king traces of a golden rosette (the predynastic crest of the kings) and a certain hieroglyph are visible. Unfortunately, all but the hieroglyph are damaged, leaving room for interpretations. Mainstream Egyptologists consider the sign to be either the name of Crocodile or King Scorpion II. A clay seal impression from Minshat Abu Omar is also of special interest to Egyptologists: in the centre of the impression it shows a serekh- like frame with a bucranium above and a crocodile crawling through grass inside. Right of this crest a divine standard is depicted, a recumbent crocodile with two projectings (either lotus buds or ostrich feathers) sprouting out of its back and is sitting on that standard. The whole arrangement is surrounded by rows of crocodiles with rope curls beneath, which seems to point to the proposed reading of Crocodile's royal serekh. But Egyptologists Van den Brink and Ludwig David Morenz argue against the idea that the seal impression talks about the ruler. In their opinion, the inscription celebrates the foundation of a shrine for the god Sobek at a city named Shedyt (alternatively Shedet). The city and the shrine are known from Old Kingdom inscriptions; the main cult centre was located at Medinet el- Fayum. For this reason, Sobek was worshipped during early dynasties as \\"Sobek of Shedyt\\".

Crellin is also a faculty member at the Australian National Academy of Music (ANAM). Jeffrey Crellin was born in Brisbane, Queensland, and first studied the oboe with Frank Lockwood at the Queensland Conservatorium of Music (also piano with Max Olding), and then with Jiří Tancibudek at Adelaide University. In 1973 he was the overall winner of the ABC Instrumental and Vocal Competitions, after which he travelled to Europe to study, most significantly with Heinz Holliger in Germany for two years on a Churchill Fellowship. There he won first prize in the Freiburg Musikhochschule Oboe Competition.http://www.mso.com.au/about-us/the-orchestra/jeffrey-crellin/ There was a time when Crellin's career might have taken a very different turn: \\"I had plans to move careers to opera singing at one point in my late twenties.

It currently comprises 42 species in five genera. Until recently, Lathrotelinae have been treated within the subfamily Spilomelinae. However, recent studies concluded that Lathroteles obscura J.F.G Clarke, 1971 and several other species are misplaced in Spilomelinae and require a separate subfamily. According to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature's Principle of Priority, the family group name Lathrotelidae J.F.G. Clarke, 1971 applies to this subfamily. Characteristic features of the Lathrotelinae are the undulating wing outline, the absent chaetosemata on the imaginal head, the completely reduced gnathos, and the male genitalia's aedeagus with a strongly spiculose \\"manica\\" on its posterior end. Lathrotelinae are suggested to be closely related to Acentropinae based on two synapomorphies in the second sternum of the abdomen, but no phylogenetic analysis has been undertaken investigating this hypothesis.

It is a tax efficient regime offering full tax transparency and neutrality. In addition, the SLP offers a high degree of contractual flexibility and is cost efficient, as the fundraising and investment structuring is in one jurisdiction.  Key Characteristics of the SLP = A limited Partnership  The SLP is composed of at least one general partner (\\"GP\\") and one or several limited partner(s). The partner may be a GP and an LP at the same time. While the GP is jointly and separately liable for any commitments of the company on his private assets and property, the liability of the LP is limited to the extent of their contributed participation interest. Thus, any liability incurred by the SLP within its incorporation, operational business or its liquidation will be considered as a commitment of the SLP in this respect.  Absence of legal personality  The SLP does not have any legal personality distinct from its partners.  Management of the SLP  A GP may but is not obliged to act as a manager of the SLP. An LP may act as manager, director, or agent of a manager of the SLP. In addition, the management of the SLP may be delegated by the GPs to an AIFM, which shall for the execution of its mandate be appointed as manager.  Limited Partnership Agreement (LPA) = Contractual flexibility  One of the main advantages of the SLP is its contractual flexibility. The GPs and LPs define all the terms and conditions in the relevant limited partnership agreement (LPA), including the operational and organisational minutiae. The LPA can take the form of a notarial deed or a private agreement. Furthermore, only an extract of the LPA must be filed with the Luxembourg Trade and Companies Register and subsequently published in the Memorial C. The mandatory content of the extract comprises only the denomination, the time period, a precise designation of the GPs and designation of the managers and their signatory powers.  Voting rights and majority rights  The partners of the SLP are granted voting rights proportionally to their participation interests held in the company. However, the allocation of the voting rights may be freely determined by the partners in the LPA. Therefore, it is possible that participation interest even may have no voting right at all.  LPA Aspects  An LPA should typically cover at least the following aspects * Voting rights; * Partners decision; * Transfer of partnership interests; * Addition of partners; * Increase in capital commitment; * Amount and priority of distributions; * Special allocation; * Repayment of partners loans or capital; * Management; * Excuse and exclusion procedures; * Reports to Partners; * Confidentiality; * Audit; * Rights of Partners; * Liability of Partners; * Dissolution; * Termination; * Dispute Jurisdiction  Differences between Luxembourg and the UK  The main difference between the UK legislation and the Luxembourg SLP lays in the governance and liability rules. The Luxembourg Law foresees a list of internal actions that can be undertaken by the LPs without constituting illicit acts of management and allowing them to maintain their limited liability. This is not the case for limited partnerships set up in the UK. In addition, the Luxembourg SLP does not require a profit share to be distributed to the GPs contrary to the UK where all partners receive a part of the profit. There is no limitation on the proportion of financing provided by equity or partners loans in the SLP whereas there must be at least 1% of equity financing in the UK.  Regulatory framework  Luxembourg partnerships are not per se subject to a specific regulatory status. It is, therefore, possible to use the SLP for setting up a regulated investment entity either in form of a SICAV under the specialized investment fund regime or an Investissement à capital risque (SICAR) in accordance with the law of the 15 June 2004 on investment companies in risk capital. An SLP set up under the SIF Law or the SICAR Law will have to comply, in addition to the rules of the Company Law, with the rules set out in the relevant fund regulation.  Accounting requirements = Unregulated SLP  The annual accounts do not have to be filed nor consolidated under the Luxembourg Trade and Companies Register. The SLP is free to choose the accounting principles to apply(LuxGeneral accepted accounting principles, IFRS or others). The appointment of an auditor is not required.  Regulated SLP  If the SLP is used as an investment vehicle, it must comply with the accounting requirements provided by the SIF and SICAR laws.  Tax = Regulated SLP  The SLP set up as a SIF benefits from an exemption of income and wealth taxes. It will only be subject to the subscription tax of 0,01% per annum calculated on the net asset value.  Unregulated SLP  The unregulated SLP is transparent for CIT(Corporate Income Tax) and NWT (Net Worth Tax). The partners are indeed considered to carry out individually the activity of the entity. In order to achieve full tax transparency, it should, however, still be ensured that the unregulated SLP does not perform a commercial activity per se. While the management of private wealth is regarded as falling outside the definition of commercial activity, an analysis would have to be made on a case-by-case basis.  Conclusion  With the introduction of the SLP as a new type of investment vehicle in Luxembourg, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg increased its power of competition as it enables Luxembourg to position itself on the market on equal footing with jurisdictions offering the Anglo-Saxon limited partnership regime.

Various types of jewelry were worn by different genders and social classes in Rome, and were used both for aesthetic purposes and to communicate social messages of status and wealth.  Materials and style  While much emphasis is placed on fine gold and silver pieces of antiquated jewelry, many pieces worn by lower social classes in Rome would have been made out of bronze or other less expensive metals. Gold and silver pieces would have been worn by the wealthy. Unlike ancient Greek jewelers, Roman manufacturers would have dealt primarily with mass-produced pieces created using molds and casting techniques. This allowed more people to afford such accessories. Roman aesthetic values led to the increased use of precious and semi-precious gemstones as well as colored glass in jewelry. Ostentatious and creative use of color was valued over fine metalwork. Glass makers were supposedly so skilled that they could fool the public into thinking that glass beads and ornaments were actually gemstones. When genuine gems were utilized, the stones preferred by Roman women were amethyst, emerald, and pearl.  Social implications  Solid gold snake bracelets, among the most popular types of Roman jewelry. Snake bracelets were often worn in pairs, around the wrists as well as on the upper arms The focus on showiness and imitation of fine materials demonstrates the fact that Romans were highly conscious of how they presented themselves in public. While living, Roman men and women frequently used ornamentation of their houses and bodies to demonstrate wealth, power, influence, and knowledge.  Gender  As with many societies, ancient Roman accessorizing varied along boundaries of gender and age, in addition to social standing. = Women = Roman women collected and wore more jewelry than men. Women usually had pierced ears, in which they would wear one set of earrings. Additionally, they would adorn themselves with necklaces, bracelets, rings, and fibula. One choker-style necklace, two bracelets, and multiple rings would be worn at once. Jewelry was particularly important to women because it was considered to be their own property, which could be kept independently of their husband's wealth and used as the women saw fit. They had the right to buy, sell, bequeath, or barter their own jewelry. = Men = Typically Roman men wore less jewelry than their female counterparts. Finger rings and fibulae were the most common forms of jewelry worn by men, but they would also sometimes wear pendants. Roman men, unlike Greek men, wore multiple rings at once. = Children = Roman children's jewelry served special purposes, especially in the form of amulets. These were worn draped around the neck, and had specialized purposes to protect the children from illness and misfortune. For example, a phallic fascinus was commonly placed on or near a young boy to ward off the evil forces.  Beyond accessories  Collections of jewelry represented great wealth and power to the Roman owners. The use of this jewelry was not limited to simply wearing it, but also extended to spiritual purposes. Hoards of gold, silver, and bronze jewelry have been found at Greek and Roman temples, providing evidence that worshipers would have offered some of their jewelry to the god or goddess of the temple, much as they would have offered other objects.

It was built on the remains of a timber church said to have been built by Fortiarnán (Fortchern, Fortcheirn) in the 5th century AD. Location Killoughternane Church is located in southern County Carlow, northwest of Mount Leinster and about 6 km northeast of Borris. History and archaeology St Fortichern, a bishop, one of the smiths of St Patrick and teacher of St Finnian of Clonard, founded a monastery on this site is the in the 5th Century. The monastery became a site noted for its learning for a millennium after its founding. The only visible sign remaining of this are the ruins of the oratory built in the 10th century. However, an archaeological survey in 2001 found traces of monastic buildings beneath the road. These were a chapel and three support buildings which were constructed from wood, had thatched roofs and wall made of clay or wattle. This site was on either side of the road and centred around Killoughternane Cross. The survey also found indications that before the building of the now ruined oratory it was the site of an earlier 8th century timber-framed church which wasthe same length as the ruined oratory but was considerably wider. They also discovered a Neolithic burial beneath the oratory. The survey found that there was as many as 25 buildings on the site at Killoughternane. The monastery had a round tower which was located to the north west of the Oratory's eastern wall at a distance of about 20 yards, it had a height of and was destroyed in the 13th century after it was struck by lightning. The monsatery was expanded in the Middle Ages when a large church was built of stone with a wood shingle roof was constructed along with an infirmary, a dormitory and classrooms. In the 14th century the final buildings were added, again of stone, and these were a lecture hall, a washroom and a residence. The building The church is made of local hammer-dressed granite, with walls 80 cm (2⅔ ft) thick. A baptismal font is in one corner, and there are antae on either side. Archaeological work showed evidence of a Neolithic burial ground. St. Fortcheirn's Well A holy well and altar stand across the road. Formerly pilgrims came from County Wexford across the Blackstairs Mountains seeking miraculous cures. In the 19th century a chalice (called the Braganza Chalice, after the bishop's house in Carlow) and paten, both of silver inlaid with gold, were found hidden in the well. The chalice bore an inscription dating to 1595 and is believed to have been hidden during the Penal era when Irish Catholicism was repressed. Both are held at the parochial house in Muine Bheag.

History  LendingPoint was founded in 2014 by Tom Burnside, Franck Fatras, Victor J. Pacheco, and Juan E. Tavares. The founders saw that the aftermath of the Great Recession was a polarizing force in consumer lending, as consumers were divided into either \\"prime\\" or \\"subprime\\" asset classes as defined by their FICO scores. Banks continued to compete for prime customers by offering low interest rates and loyalty programs, but consumers below the 700 FICO dividing line were grouped together and remained stuck between bank declines and very few responsible borrowing choices. The founders recognized financial behaviors and characteristics that were more distinctive than FICO scores, which defined an asset class that could be seen as an emerging market with predictive behaviors and risk profiles. LendingPoint was created with the goal of providing access to more affordable loans for these consumers with credit scores between 580–700, a class which LendingPoint names \\"NearPrime\\". LendingPoint officially launched its first consumer loan product in January 2015. In October 2015, LendingPoint announced a $100 million credit facility with funds managed by the Tradable Credit and Direct Lending groups of Ares Management. Just two months later, LendingPoint signed an additional credit facility for $5 million of incremental financing with Aeterna Capital Partners. This money was raised to help the company expand its loan portfolio to even more consumers and grow with the demands of the market as it continued rollout across the U.S. In August 2016, former American Express executive Houman Motaharian joined LendingPoint as Chief Revenue Officer. By the end of 2016, within two years of its public launch, LendingPoint had funded more than $100 million in consumer loans across 13 states. LendingPoint signed an exclusive partnership with ezVerify in June 2017 to provide a new service called ezCarePoint, which allows patients to predict their out-of-pocket expenses and apply for flexible payment plans and loans to cover the costs of medical procedures. On August 22, 2017, LendingPoint closed an up to $500 million credit facility arranged by Guggenheim Securities. The company took down $138.5 million of the facility at the closing and on September 15, 2017, it took down an additional $32.7 million. This was one of the largest credit facilities raised in 2017 in the online consumer lending industry for a balance sheet lender, and it provided LendingPoint with additional capital to expand its products and services nationwide, at a significantly lower cost of funds. Guggenheim Securities, the investment banking and capital markets division of Guggenheim Partners, arranged the transaction and served as bookrunner. CBIZ MHM is the Administrative Agent, and U.S. Bank is the Note Agent and Paying Agent. On January 11, 2018, the company announced that it acquired the merchant portal technology and other assets of LoanHero, a fintech platform for point of sale finance. LoanHero's retail financing technology allows merchants to close more transactions while providing consumers more payment options. LendingPoint noted that the LoanHero assets would help accelerate the company's expansion into point-of-need and point-of-sale financing, by combining LoanHero's merchant onboarding and reporting tools and installed merchant base with LendingPoint's credit underwriting and risk management expertise. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. On May 17, 2018, LendingPoint announced that it had closed another credit facility—this one up to $600 million—also arranged by Guggenheim Securities. This second credit facility brought LendingPoint's total Senior Credit availability to $1.1 billion raised in nine months. The financing will continue to fuel LendingPoint's growth and ability to serve more customers. On June 28, 2018, LendingPoint upsized its mezzanine financing, bringing the total of its mezzanine credit facility to $52.5 million. The upsized mezzanine allows LendingPoint to more efficiently manage its equity by warehouse financing its originations before selling them into its Senior Credit Facilities. To-date, the company has issued almost 70,000 loans, totaling nearly $500 million in consumer loans. Products LendingPoint built a proprietary credit risk model which allows it to offer more loans to consumers with FICO scores between 580–700. Using hundreds of data points, LendingPoint looks at a person's complete financial picture, taking into consideration credit history, employment history, earning potential and other data to determine creditworthiness. Installment loans can be used for a number of purposes including home and car repair, renovations, weddings, medical or veterinary bills, travel, or debt consolidation. In partnership with ezVerify, LendingPoint provides patients and medical providers a service called ezCarePoint, which aims to make it easier and more affordable for consumers to pay their medical bills. ezCarePoint helps patients verify their insurance coverage and payment responsibility for health care services before the procedures take place, preventing incidents where patients unexpectedly find themselves responsible for bills outside of their insurance coverage. If the patient can't pay the out-of-pocket costs up front, they can apply for a loan and payment plan quickly and easily from the ezCarePoint platform. Patients are notified of approvals in a matter of seconds, and upon approval, LendingPoint pays the loan proceeds to medical practitioners within one business day to pay the patients' out-of-pocket medical costs up front. The LendingPoint Merchant Solutions platform provides merchants a fully integrated, one-stop retail financing product to convert more customers at the point of sale. LendingPoint Merchant Solutions combines the merchant onboarding and reporting tools acquired in January 2018 from LoanHero, with LendingPoint's credit underwriting and risk management expertise. On 16 July 2020, LendingPoint introduced a merchant lending platform called which provides an online consumer loan pre-approval portal for companies of all sizes providing inexpensive borrowing solutions to their consumers' broadest loan spectrum.

Many owners of the Instagram shops make use of the venues to turn their online business into physical retail stores. Weekend markets in Hong Kong consist of stalls hawking everything from jewelry to beauty products, from clothing to shoes and from traditional food to organic vegetables which will be mentioned as follows. Origin and history The idea of weekend markets in Hong Kong come from London retail markets and have become popular since 2000s. The Hong Kong government has made great contribution to this retail culture. In 2013, The Hong Kong Cultural Centre launched the \\"Creative Market in Partnership” for creative talents to showcase their works. Experienced civil organizations including Po Leung Kuk and the Hong Kong Young Women’s Christian Association were asked to set up thematic creative markets and provide helpers there. In short, the weekend markets provide a platform for young people to unleash their talent, for the racial minority to promote their cultural products and for the mentally disabled to make a living, together making our culture more diverse. Features Weekend markets have always been a channel for people to spend time with friends and family. The sellers specialize in a particular type of goods, below are some examples of weekend markets in Hong Kong. organic vegetables grown locally are sold Organic products - Organic Farmers’ Markets There are about seven weekend Farmers’ Markets in Hong Kong selling organic vegetables that are grown locally, including Tai Po Farmers’ Markets on Tai Wo Road and Tuen Mun Farmers' Market on Castle Peak Road. The stall holders are farmers who came from the New Territories. They cooperate with the organizer Federation of Vegetable Marketing Co-operative Societies to run their markets which attract over 3000 citizens every weekend. stalls selling well-designed clothes, handicrafts and accessories Handicrafts and DIY products - D2 Place Weekend Markets D2 Place is the new cultural and creativity hub in West Kowloon where people regularly organize weekend markets, aiming to promote local culture and encourage young people to develop their own business with the mission of \\"Small Shops with Big Ideas\\". There are over 125 stalls selling well-designed clothes, handicrafts, accessories, snacks and an array of free workshops teaching customers to make natural skin care products by themselves. More than that, it gets citizens closer to the latest fashions news, music performances and shopping experiences. Food and gallery - PMQ Night Markets This night-time market is a cluster of chefs, craftspeople, musicians and artists food stalls in PMQ selling extraordinary food This night-time market is a cluster of chefs, craftspeople, musicians and artists, and will be housed in the select weekends throughout the year in the former police building in Central (known as the Police Married Quarters, or PMQ for short). The night market consists of booths displaying well-designed products of local artists, live performances by children and local singers. There are food stalls selling extraordinary food including cupcakes, wedding cookies and artisan bread, they could be instantly made according to customer's requests. Chances The society benefits from weekend markets on the following three aspects. Cultural aspect As most of the weekend markets in Hong Kong are promoting unique handicrafts and gadgets such as DIY phone cases, DIY natural soaps and traditional commodities, It encourages the development of local creative industry and cultural preservation when more people appreciate the handmade traditional products. There have been Israeli designers exchanging ideas with the local brands to create jewelries and paper toys in the weekend markets, and this foster cultural exchange between Hong Kong and other countries. Economic aspect Weekend markets encourage the growth of gross domestic product by encouraging people to purchase the merchandise there. Also, they become tourist attractions and bring benefits to the shops nearby to increase tourism revenue in Hong Kong. In PMQ Night Markets, pop-up design shops provide a platform for the overseas designers to crossover ideas and do business with the local brands, which help develop the local retail industry. Social aspect In the weekend markets, people are recruited to operate the booths there. Teenagers, freelance workers and retailers can promote their innovative and exclusive products, as well as farmers can sell fresh organic vegetables. Due to these two advantages, the employment number can be increased.This helps improve the living standard of Hong Kong people. Challenges=Promotion Most products sold in weekend markets are created by young people and are not considered as famous brands. Sellers there need to seek different ways to promote their shops and products. Most of the sellers rely on online promotion and need to update the Instagram and Facebook page frequently through using large number of hashtags, seeking sponsored posts and product reviews on YouTube to grab customers’ attentions, which is quite time-consuming. Stability of location Due to limited land supply in Hong Kong, available lands and booths are limited. Most of them are rented for 1 to 3 months, which is a short period of time. Sellers need to search for new sites and change their selling places continuously which may not be easy for customers to find and visit. Therefore, this may discourage them from purchasing. Accessibility For organic farmers’ markets, in order to reduce the transportation distance and perishability of agricultural products, many farmers’ weekend markets are located around rural areas such as Tai Hang, Sai Kung. However, these far off rural districts are relatively hard to be visited by travellers or citizens due to inconvenient traffic, which may then reduce the popularity and profit of the weekend markets.

Food waste is defined as all parts of food, inedible and edible, created before, during, and after food processing, production, and consumption. Greenhouse gases, especially methane can be reduced by food waste recycling. Food waste recycling can also alleviate the saturation of landfill sites in Hong Kong. Background=Current situation of food waste in Hong Kong The amount of food waste accounts for 38% of the municipal solid waste in Hong Kong. According to the statistics published by the Environmental Protection Department, Hong Kong generates approximately 3,648 tonnes of food waste each day. About one-third of the food waste comes from the commercial and industrial sectors while the remaining part is from households. The situation of food waste disposal in Hong Kong has become more serious in recent years. The amount of food waste from the commercial and industry sectors increased from 400 tonnes in 2002 to 1033 tonnes in 2014. Three steps of food waste recycling in Hong Kong Food waste recycling typically involves a three-step strategy that includes separation, collection and recycling. These three steps are interdependent and equally important in efficiently generating useful resources from food waste recycling. =Separation= The collected food waste is separated into two categories: pre-consumer food waste and post-consumer food waste. Pre-consumer food waste includes animal food waste, vegetable food waste, and waste from industrially- processed food. Post-consumer food waste refers to leftover food, such as from an unfinished restaurant order. Source separation also involves removing any food packaging and utensils. =Collection= Food waste vehicles, managed by the government, collect and deliver food waste to governmental recycling facilities. These recycling facilities, known as Organic Waste Treatment Facilities (OWTFs), will be spread across Hong Kong's districts. The government plans to construct 5–6 OWTF networks, with a goal of recycling 1300–1500 tonnes of food waste between 2014–2024. The first facility is planned to be built in Siu Ho Wan to serve Lantau Island and districts nearby. The second and third are projected to be built in Sha Ling and Shek Kong so as to serve the New Territories and West Kowloon. The Environmental Protection Department also plans to construct two Organic Resources Recovery Centres (ORRCs) to collect the food waste and turn it into compost for recovery. These two centres will collectively be able to treat 500 tonnes of organic waste and divert 200–300 tonnes of waste from the landfills daily. The first Centre will also be located in Siu Ho Wan. The construction works commenced in December 2014 and it is expected to be commissioned in early 2018. =Recycling= Two technologies are used to turn food waste into biogas and useful products. The first technology is a low-carbon method that processes 100–300 tonnes of food waste per day. By applying this technology, it produces a source of the renewable energy biogas. It is estimated that the first Centre will be able to provide 14 million kWh of electricity to Hong Kong's power grid every year, which can power 3,000 households. The second technology converts food waste into succinic acid by using enzymes and bacteria. The residues can be processed to be animal feed, fertilizers and environmental-friendly cleansing products. Hong Kong Food Waste Recycling program=The Hong Kong GovernmentFood Waste Recycling Partnership Scheme= Food waste recycling partnership scheme is introduced by the Environmental Protection Department in 2009. The scheme was designed to promote a good practice on food waste management and enhance people’s experiences of separating and recycling food waste sources. The scheme collaborated with commercial and industrial sectors. Some members from the Hong Kong Government and that of the commercial and industrial sectors formed a working group for planning and managing the operation of the project. There are about 20–30 public and private organizations that participate in the scheme every year. In the project, all the participants will have a chance to practice separation process of food waste sources. The collection process of separated food waste will be carried out by the Environmental Protection Department and the Kowloon Bay Pilot Composting Plant will be responsible to the recycling part. The scheme also consists of discussion sessions for the participating parties to share their experience of recycling food waste. All participants will receive a commendation certificate at the end of the project. =Food Waste Recycling Projects in Housing Estates= From November 2012 to July 2014, The Hong Kong Housing Authority implemented a trial scheme, named as Food Waste Recycling Projects in Housing Estates, with an aim to promote waste recycling in housing estates. The scheme involved 14 estates with about 3,200 households. There were two modes adopted in the scheme: One is to convert food waste to fish grain by transporting them to a Central Food Waste Recycling plant. The other is to convert food waste into compost for farm by using micro-organisms. =Food Waste Recycling Scheme on Cheung Chau and Lamma Island= On 31 March 2012, The Environmental Protection Department introduced a recycling scheme on Cheung Chau and Lamma Island. The purpose of the scheme is to promote and encourage food waste recycling on both islands. Food waste collected from shops and restaurants would be transported to the food waste treatment facilities on the islands. The food waste would be converted to organic compost. Non-governmental organizationHong Kong Organic Waste Recycling Centre= Hong Kong Organic Waste Recycling Centre (HKOWRC) was established in 2011 as the first organic waste management consulting firm in Hong Kong. It combines local and foreign technologies to provide one-stop organic recycling services to customers. The assistance in collection of food waste solves problems of companies in immature recycling. Through commitment to different types of people, HKOWRC can promote and provide waste management training for particular customers. Daily Food Waste Recycling Service The objectives of the collection and recycling routine are to educate the general public in cherishing food as well as making good use of resources. The service encourages two-way cooperation for food waste recycling. HKOWRC aims to provide 24 hour recycling services particularly to livestock breeders, farmers, catering industry, schools and large-scale housing estates. For most of the cases, the recycled food waste is to be used by the service targets again for other purposes, therefore avoiding wastage of resources. For livestock breeders and farmers, the recycled food waste is converted to animal feeds and fertilizers that contain richer nutritional values than the conventional ones. It possibly gives higher yield. For catering industry, the recycled food waste is converted to crops which are grown from organic compost from HKOWRC for latest organic food at a special prize. For schools and housing estates, it aims to raise the awareness of food waste reduction when the recycling service reveals the huge amount of food wastes accumulated.

Biography Isaac Sabbá was born into a Jewish family of Moroccan origin, he was the third son among five children of Primo Sabbá and Fortunata (née.Benayon) Sabbá. His father was son of Moroccan immigrants born in Cametá when it was the capital of the state of Grão-Pará (present Pará). His mother was born in Faro, Portugal her parents were both Jewish immigrants from Morocco. His family moved Manaus for his older sister wedding, because his future brother in law had offered employment, he was 12. Soon began working as an office assistant representation of his brother in law. The workload did not allow him to study, interrupting their school life in the second grade.However, he reserved his spare time for reading, a habit that he cultivated all his life. Personal life Sabbá married Irene (née. Assayag) Gonçalves Sabbá (1925-2006) in 1942. The couple had 5 children, Moises Gonçalves Sabbá (b.1944), Alberto Mimon Gonçalves Sabbá (b. 1945), Mario Gonçalves Sabbá (b.1947), Ester Gonçalves Sabbá (b.1949) and Débora Gonçalves Sabbá (1963-1963). He took as a pupil his nephew Moyses Benarrós Israel, who was his right hand during all of his life. Career Sabbá founded the firm IB Sabbá, an exporting firm and later changing the name to IB Sabbá & Cia. Ltda. his most successful company was the Petróleo Sabbá, the company had the participation of his nephew Moyses Israel. The group had diversified its business portfolio created over 42 factories, as FiteJuta (beneficiation Jute), alligator leather benefiting Co., oil refinery and distribution of petrol .They exported rosewood, Brazil nut, Oil refinery among other products of the extractive industry. Early career In 1930 he joined in partnership with one of his brothers, and founded the firm J.Sabbá representations & Cia. He soon realized the limited potential of this line of business, and moved to an export firm. Began, then a sort of interstate commerce while exporting firms of Amazonas then existing employed its activities almost exclusively in foreign trade. =World War II= With the outbreak of World War II, the Federal Government established the monopoly of rubber, a time when Isaac Sabbá company accounted for 64% of export of the Amazon. This would not be the only time that the government would nationalize his companies. In 1942, Isaac Sabbá had founded the Companhia Mercantil Comissionária e Exportadora, transformed later in Devel - Amazon Development Society Ltda., in order to increase the elastic-tire businesses. That company was equipped vessels that sailed all state rivers in search of latex. Also created during the war, the company Jacy Paraná, in the current state of Rondônia, aiming to increase rubber production. =After World War II= With the rapid increase in consumption of chewing gum after World War II, he set up a raw materials dehydration plant, with the aim of ensuring the placement of the Amazon product in the international market. He did the same with Brazilian nuts. Business Expansion Isaac Sabbá and Brazilian President Juscelino Juscelino Kubitschek Understanding the weaknesses of the Amazonian business environment, characterized by poverty and lack of financial resources that could be used for the exploitation of its immense natural wealth, he studied and put in action a funding system that benefited the producer. After analysing the situation of the local industries, he saw that it was not possible to increase the production of raw materials without a fuel supply, at an affordable price on the Amazon region. Hence came the idea of building an oil refinery in Manaus which became Reman. He was called by the Time Magazine and the Los Angeles Times as \\"The King of the Amazon\\". =Oil Business= The Oil Refinery Isaac Sabbá, built on the shores of the Rio Negro in Manaus, began operations on September 6, 1956 under the name Companhia de Petroleo do Amazonas(Copam - Petroleum Company of the Amazon). The refinery was officially opened on January 3, 1957, with the presence of President Juscelino Kubitschek. However, only to produce fuel was not enough, most important was to make them accessible to other consumer centers, his aim was the integration of the Amazon region in the economic life of the country. In 1971 IB Sabbá partnered with Royal Dutch Shell and formed the society Petróleo Sabbá SA, which took over the activities of the Petroleum department of IB Sabbá & Cia. Ltda. In the same year COPAM was nationalized by the military government, and was renamed Refinaria de Manaus(REMAN) which means Manaus Refinery, only in 1996 after his death it was renamed Refinaria Isaac Sabbá. On May 31, 1974, Copam it was incorporated into the Petrobras System as Manaus Refinery (Reman). A soccer team was named after a Petroleo Sabbá gas station the Associação Atlética Cori-Sabbá. Death Isaac Sabbá died on March 26, 1996 of pneumonia. He was survived by his wife Irene and his four children, eight grandchildren and three great grandchildren. Philanthropy Sabbá built the Military Hospital of Manaus the federal funding for the construction of the hospital would be returned, the hospital that still serves up to its objectives. When the CEM - Manaus Electricity Company - was implemented in the city it had Isaac Sabbá as a guarantor. He also surveyed the necessary resources with banks in order to pay the payroll of the employees. In order to help, he putted the equipment and machinery of his refinery at the disposal of the new company, without charge. Isaac Sabbá also helped create and was the one who helped the BEA - Amazonas state bank - in the most difficult moments, lending you money whenever the cash needs of the isntituição required.

They were * the Fife and Kinross Railway from Ladybank to Kinross; * the Kinross-shire Railway from near Cowdenbeath to Kinross; and * the Devon Valley Railway from Tillicoultry to Kinross, although the last-named was not completed until 1872. These single-track rural lines became part of the main line network when the first Tay Bridge was opened in 1878, and then the Forth Bridge in 1890. For the Forth Bridge route two new sections of route were constructed, a cut-off line near Cowdenbeath, and the Glenfarg line connecting Mawcarse and Bridge of Earn, near Perth. All the local passenger services were discontinued by 1964, and the through Glenfarg route to Perth closed in 1970. History=Kinross In the interior of the country, Kinross, the county town of Kinross-shire, had developed little before the railway age. By 1829 its population was only 7,762 and cotton weaving had only lately become the industry.The Edinburgh Gazetteer or Compendious Geographical Dictionary, Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown and Green, Edinburgh 1829 Nonetheless it became the destination of choice for the builders of three independent railways. By 1850 main line railways had been built surrounding it: * the Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway running from Edinburgh to Perth and Dundee (but with two ferry crossings of the Firth of Forth and Firth of Tay, and with a branch from Thornton to Dunfermline; * the Scottish Central Railway running from Central Scotland to Perth; * the Stirling and Dunfermline Railway. Coal workings had been undertaken for some time in the southern part of the area around Dunfermline, at this time the greater extent of the deposits was being discovered. The Fife and Kinross Railway The Kinross lines in 1872The Fife and Kinross Railway was authorised by Act of Parliament on 16 July 1855 to build a 14-mile line, to build a branch line from the Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway at Ladybank to Kinross. There was provision for future extension to Tillicoultry, where a connection could be made with the Stirling and Dunfermline Railway line to Alloa. The line was to be single throughout. Authorised capital for the scheme was £70,000.E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959William Scott Bruce, The Railways of Fife, Melven Press, Perth, 1980, The proposal had encountered considerable opposition in Parliament, especially from the EP&DR; and the Scottish Central Railway, who both feared expansion of the line into a competing through route. The Act having been secured, a contract for construction was let in the sum of £47,818; the first sod was cut among considerable rejoicing at Auchtermuchty on 14 January 1856.Thomas, Forgotten Railways, page 109; Thomas and Turnock say 12 January. Application was made to Parliament in November 1856 to make a deviation at Milnathort, and a new line from the deviation to the EP&D; near South Lumphinnans, and a branch to Kelty colliery. The South Lumphinnans connection would have been a direct duplication of the Kinross-shire Railway route, and the latter was authorised while the F&KR; proposed amendment was refused. As the date of opening drew near, the Directors found that the EP&DR; was unwilling to spare a locomotive to work the line, as had been hoped, although they were prepared to hire rolling stock to the little company. The F&KR; was approached by R and W Hawthorn, who had acquired the Leith Engine Works, with an offer of a locomotive. The F&KR; ordered two 0-4-0 tender engines, and part-paid in shares. When delivered the locomotives were named Loch Leven Castle and Falkland Castle. Rolling stock was procured locally, and the EP&DR;'s offer was not taken up. The line was opened from Ladybank to Strathmiglo on 6 June 1857, and extended to Milnathort on 9 March 1858,Thomas and Turnock; also Thomas page 110; Brice says (page 93) it opened as far as Milnathort on 15 March 1858 and to Kinross on 26 August 1858. Ross says (page 53) between Ladybank and Kinross on 15 March 1858. and finally to Hopetown of Kinross on 20 August 1858. The line was single throughout.John Thomas, Forgotten Railways: Scotland, David and Charles (Publishers) Limited, Newton Abbot, 1976, John Thomas and David Turnock, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 15, North of Scotland, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1989, David Ross, The North British Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, The access at Ladybank was by a curve leading southwards on the Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway main line; it joined that line some distance south of Ladybank station, and passenger trains arriving at Ladybank reversed on the main line to a bay platform there.From Archivist of the North British Railway Study Group. Cobb shows a northwards spur at Ladybank, but this is not supported by available large scale maps.Col M H Cobb, The Railways of Great Britain -- A Historical Atlas, Ian Allan Publishing Limited, Shepperton, 2003, The line was authorised to be extended to meet the Kinross-shire Railway at a joint Kinross station by Act of 28 June 1858. The extension was opened on 20 September 1860, when the original F&KR; station was renamed Hopefield. The working of the F&KR; railway was finally taken over by the EP&DR; on 5 April 1861; the F&KR; was always short of money and it secured absorption by the EP&DR; by Act of 29 July 1862. The Kinross-shire Railway The Kinross-shire Railway was authorised on 10 August 1857 to construct a single line route 7 miles long from the Dunfermline branch of the Edinburgh, Perth and Dunfermline Railway near Lumphinnans to Kinross. Authorised capital was £53,000. In the 1858 Parliamentary session a joint Bill was presented by the two companies to make a connection between the two lines and to make a joint station. The Kinross-shire Railway opened its line on 20 June 1860 to a temporary station about a quarter mile south of the now-authorised joint station,Actually on the south-east side of the Cowdenbeath Road. and the extension to the joint station with the Fife and Kinross Railway was opened on 20 September 1860. The EP&DR; had agreed to work the line provided that the Kinross-shire acquired its own locomotive, and it did so, obtaining one similar to the F&KR; engines, also from R & W Hawthorn. Just before opening the contractor threatened to prevent it until his bill was paid. The passenger timetable on the two Kinross lines worked in harmony, with trains making good connections at Kinross. There was a traffic agreement between the two railways determining which route traffic originating or terminating on the line should take; this occasionally led to some counter- intuitive routings. The company obtained an Act of July 1861 to build a branch from Kelty to Kingseat, where it was intended to make a junction with the West of Fife Mineral Railway. the line opened in 1863. The financial performance of the little company was poor, and inevitably it had to seek absorption by its larger neighbour; Parliamentary authority to amalgamate with the EP&DR; was obtained on 1 August 1861. Devon Valley Railway The Devon Valley Railway was incorporated on 23 July 1858 to build a line from the Stirling and Dunfermline Railway station at Tillicoultry to Hopefield (Kinross); the authorised capital was £90,000. A further act of 1 August 1861 authorised several deviations, and then an Act of 1863 brought about a £10,000 reduction of capital. The Scottish Central Railway and the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway each had powers to contribute £30,000 to the share subscription, but on 4 August 1858 both those companies declared a change of mind. Nonetheless by 1864 the NBR contributed £40,000 fearing an incursion into Fife by the rival Caledonian Railway. The first sod was cut on 4 August 1860, but then nothing much was done as it proved difficult to raise the money. Eventually on 1 May 1863 the 6 1/2 mile section between Kinross and Rumbling Bridge was opened. The next section was to traverse exceptionally difficult terrain, and it was decided to build from the other end of the route, at Tillicoultry. Work started there and the line was opened to Dollar on 3 May 1869. The NBR paid £10 for life membership of Dollar Water Supply Association for DVR engine water. The Devon Valley Railway Act of 1866 obliged the North British Railway to pay £60,000 for completion of the DVR line; this had been agreed to when the NBR was in expansionist mood and desired to exclude the Caledonian Railway from the area. Now the NBR had to make good on its promise. The NBR decided that the Rumbling Bridge station configuration was inconvenient for the extension, and it altered the proposed alignment, easing the ruling gradient from 1 in 50 to 1 in 63. The difficult intermediate section was completed and the line was opened throughout on 1 May 1871.John Thomas, The North British Railway, volume 1, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1969, The DVR line joined the Fife and Kinross Railway line at Hopefield, now renamed Kinross Junction. The DVR company was independent but the line was worked by the NBR, until it absorbed the DVR in 1875. The DVR was vested in the NBR on 1 January 1875, with £100 DVR shares being exchanged for £62 10s NBR ordinary shares. The Tay Bridge Completion of the three Kinross lines gave the NBR a route from Ladybank to Alloa. The opening of the first Tay bridge enabled through carriages to be run from Edinburgh and Glasgow to Dundee and Aberdeen, via Kinross. Completion of the second Tay bridge transformed Fife, enabling the North British Railway to run fast trains from Dundee to Glasgow and Edinburgh. Some trains ran from Glasgow to Perth via the Devon Valley (portrayed for publicity purposes as the \\"Picturesque route\\"), and ten trains ran daily between those places, half on the Devon Valley route and half on the traditional route. The Forth Bridge The Kinross in 1890 when the Forth Bridge openedThe Forth Bridge was fully opened for all traffic on 2 June 1890. It required a number of enhancements to the main line routes of the North British Railway leading to it. The Kinross route was transformed into part of the main line from Cowdenbeath to Perth, and the entire route section from Kelty to Mawcasrse Junction was doubled and upgraded for main line running. The Glenfarg Line The Glenfarg Line is the name often given to the line between Kinross and Perth (actually Mawcarse Junction and Hilton Junction). As early as 1863, long before the construction of the Forth or Tay bridges, the North British Railway had obtained Parliamentary powers to build a line through Glenfarg, linking the proposed Dunfermline and Queensferry Railway and the Kinross lines, which were to be doubled. From Glenfarg the line would run directly to Perth, by-passing the Caledonian route from Hilton Junction through Moncrieffe tunnel. At the Queensferry end, there would be train ferries across the Forth. In 1867 nothing had been done and the Company had to ask for authority for extra time to build the line; meanwhile shareholders were becoming concerned about the financial commitment to numerous new construction schemes, and the project was dropped. The scheme was revived during the preparation for the construction of the Forth Bridge. It was obvious that this would fundamentally change traffic patterns: NBR traffic was still crossing the Firth of Forth by ferry steamer. As well as the immediate approach railways at Queensferry, a new line was built from Saughton, some distance west of Edinburgh, to Dalmeny. In Fife the Glenfarg line was being built, connecting Mawcarse, on the Fife and Kinross line, with Bridge of Earn on the NBR route from Ladybank, close to Hilton Junction from where the NBR had running powers to Perth. Leaving the north side of the Forth Bridge, trains would reach Inverkeithing over the approach railway, and then Touch Junctions at Dunfermline by the 1866 line. Joining the Dunfermline branch of the old EP&DR; company, trains could run eastwards for a few miles before running on to another section of new route at Cowdenbeath giving access at Kelty South Junction to the old Kinross-shire Railway. The route then continued through Kinross on to the Fife and Kinross-shire line, diverging at Mawcarse on to the new Glenfarg route, and thence to Perth. All this was double track, and the relevant sections of the Kinross railways, which had been quiet backwaters, were doubled and upgraded to main line running standards. On 2 June 1890 the Forth Bridge was opened to through traffic, and on the same day the Glenfarg line and the deviation line by-passing Cowdenbeath were also opened. Cowdenbeath improvements The cut-off line at Cowdenbeath, from Cowdenbeath South Junction, used a new, more convenient, Cowdenbeath station, named Cowdenbeath New, and from 2 June 1890 the original station was named Cowdenbeath Old. There were numerous colliery connections off the old main line in the Cowdenbeath area, and congestion there prompted the construction of a short connection from the new Cowdenbeath line returning to the original line at Lumphinnans. This was operational by 1915,Ordnance Survey of Great Britain, 1:2,500 plan, Fifeshire and through trains towards Thornton were diverted to it. It was known as the Cowdenbeath Loop. There were now two passenger stations in Cowdenbeath, \\"Old\\" and \\"New\\" and on 31 March 1919 Cowdenbeath Old station was closed and Cowdenbeath New was renamed Cowdenbeath.Although the 1938 \\"Bradshaw\\" still uses \\"Cowdenbeath (New)\\".Bradshaws July 1938 Railway Guide, David & Charles Publishers, Newton Abbot, 1969, The section of the original main line was downgraded to mineral line status and remained open at least to 1960.British Railways, Scottish Region, Sectional Appendix to the Books of Rules and Regulations: Section 1 - East, Glasgow, 1960, pages 79 and 82 The deviation route remains in use today: ordinary passenger trains towards Glenrothes diverge from the original main line at what had been Cowdenbeath South Junction on the 1890 new line, calling at what had been Cowdenbeath New station; they then follow the Cowdenbeath Loop at Cowdenbeath North Junction and rejoin the original main line at the former Lumphinnans South Junction. This is the only part of the network described in this article that remains open to traffic. 1938 passenger trains service In 1938 the passenger service on the Kinross lines was on two axes. The first was from Edinburgh via Dunfermline and Cowdenbeath to Kinross and Perth. There were six fast trains on the route including two sleeping car trains from Kings Cross to Inverness. Most daytime trains called at Dunfermline and Kinross. In addition there were four through stopping trains and some short workings. The second was from Alloa and Tillicoultry to Kinross and Ladybank. There were four stopping trains each way, with some short workings. For the few years between the opening of the Tay Bridge and the Forth Bridge, this had been a significant route for the North British Railway between Glasgow, Alloa, Kinross and Dundee but that importance had vanished after 1890. Closure The Devon Valley Railway route closed on 15 June 1964, although goods services continued between Tillicoultry and Alloa until 25 June 1973. The Fife and Kinross line closed between Ladybank and Mawcarse Junction on 5 June 1950 to passengers, and to goods on 5 October 1964. The Kelty - Kinross - Glenfarg - Hilton Junction line closed on 5 January 1970, although goods traffic continued to Kinross and Milnathort until 4 May 1970. When the Glenfarg line closed the Perth to Edinburgh services were diverted along the Bridge of Earn to Ladybank line was reopened (it had closed in September 1955) Gordon Stansfield, Fife's Lost Railways, Stenlake Publishing, Catrine, 1998, The original section of the Kinross-shire Railway between Lumphinnans Central Junction and Kelty South Junction closed to passengers on 2 June 1890 when the cut-off line opened, but remained open for mineral traffic at least until 1960.

The West Kowloon Bamboo Theatre has been held since 2012 by the WKCDA which aims to promote Cantonese opera and the West Kowloon Cultural District (WKCD). Due to its popularity, the WKCDA continues to organise the West Kowloon Bamboo Theatre annually after 2012. Starting from 2013, apart from Cantonese opera, the theatre also provides performances of modern music and Chinese dance. There was a New Year Fair being provided as well.  Location  Since 2012, a temporary bamboo theatre, covering 1,800 square metres, has been set up by the WKCDA during the Chinese New Year for the performances. It is located next to the Tsim Sha Tsui Fire Station, at the junction of Canton Road and Austin Road, which is the future site of the Xiqu Centre. In 2014, the performing stage has moved to the West Kowloon Waterfront Promenade in the WKCD.  History = 2012  The West Kowloon Bamboo Theatre is the first cultural event organized by the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority to celebrate the Chinese New Year with theatrical inspiration. The cost of land levelling and bamboo scaffolding is about HK$1,000,000. The Bamboo Theatre was constructed traditionally using over 10000 bamboo stalks by 10 bamboo scaffolders within 2 weeks to provide 800-seat auditorium. In addition, it is the largest bamboo theatre built in Hong Kong. The Cantonese opera actors from The Chinese Artists Association of Hong Kong performed a total of 11 Cantonese operas from 20 January 2012 to 23 January 2012, including “Prime Minister of Six States” and “The Sassy Princess and Her Blunt Husband”. The Authority decided to put on two extra performance since the tickets of 6 original performance sold out within half an hour. In order to attract local people, each ticket cost relatively low (HK$10). It is estimated that the Authority had to pay for about one million as allowance. An exhibition of newly commissioned works by five contemporary artists, including Chu Hing-wah, Gaylord Chan, Michael Wolf, Samson Young and Henry Chu, is held in M+ (the future Museum of Visual Arts). Five rarely-seen opera-themed film classics, including John Woo's Princess Chang Ping (1976) and Ann Hui's Spooky Bunch (1980), also be shown in back-to-back outdoor screenings with English subtitles.  2013  The West Kowloon Bamboo Theatre 2013, themed \\"City Memories\\" was held between January 30 and February 16, 2013 at the West Kowloon Cultural District, attracting a hundred thousand visitors. The 2013 Bamboo Theatre was covered by a golden orange nylon net so as to make the venue look like an ancient palace-like architecture, holding various performances, a fair and an exhibition during the 3-week period. A crossover of tradition and innovative Augmented Reality (AR) technology was also introduced in 2013's West Kowloon Bamboo Theatre. Visitors only needed to pay for some of the performances this year while the other activities are free of charge. Performances at the Bamboo Theatre included 14 Cantonese operas (of which four had free admission), one Chinese dance performance (free admission as well) and 2 contemporary music concerts. The Cantonese opera performances were provided by different local opera troupes including Golden Glory Cantonese Opera Troupe (with Law Ka-Ying as one of the cast), Lung Fei Cantonese Opera Troupe (with Tse Suet-sum as one of the cast), Sun Moon Star Cantonese Opera Troupe, Golden Dragon Cantonese Opera Troupe, Sum Mei Cantonese Opera Troupe, Hong Kong Young Talent Opera Troupe and The Young Academy Cantonese Opera Troupe. 2 music performances, namely \\"A Cappella Platter\\" and \\"Flower Music\\" were performed by A Cappella Zhong Yue Feng and SIU2 respectively. Finally, the dance performance was by Hong Kong Dance Company. The newly introduced AR technology allowed visitors to interact with the venue. For the exhibition, the designs of the future Xiqu Centre was displayed. With the AR Xiqu Centre App, visitors could scan the AR code of the winning design of the Xiqu Centre Design Competition and watch an animation of the design. Apart from the exhibition, the world’s first AR Code Floral Panels were available at the Bamboo Theatre too. Scanning it with their smartphones or tablets, visitors could have a look of the AR blueprint of the Xiqu Centre on their devices.  2014  The 2014 West Kowloon Bamboo Theatre was held during 17 January to 9 February. The location was changed to West Kowloon Waterfront Promenade due to the construction of Xiqu Centre. The venue of 2014 West Kowloon Bamboo Theatre was 4 times bigger than that in 2012 and 2013. Different kinds of Chinese operas such as kunqu and jingkunqu were performed on a free-of-charge basis. Experienced and amateur artists were invited to participate in the performance. Classical Chinese movies, which were mainly about Chinese opera songs, were shown in the theatre.

During her internship, she designed and built a device to measure single-atom conductance across a nanowire; the materials cost $35. She won the Siemens Competition national finals in 2000 with the device she built at Yale and her research on quantum mechanics. She went on to win first place in the 2001 Intel Science Talent Search. This made her the first student to win first place in both the Intel Science Talent Search and the Siemens Competition, and she was included in the MIT Technology Review TR35 list of the world's top under-35 innovators in 2002, when she was 18 years old. Lisanti completed her bachelor's degree in condensed matter physics at Harvard University and earned a Ph.D. in high-energy physics at Stanford University. In 2010, she joined the Princeton University Center for Theoretical Science as an associate research scholar, and became an assistant professor in 2013. Her best-known research has been on the phenomenology of collider physics. She has encouraged the use of simplified search strategy models in the observation of new particles from collider data, an approach that was consequently adopted by groups using the Large Hadron Collider. She has also described theoretical models concerning dark matter, and in 2014 she co-authored a paper predicting the times of year when dark matter particle density is greatest. She was a 2013 regional finalist in the Blavatnik Awards for Young Scientists.

The cause of the accident was determined to be pilot error. There were two people killed in the crash, and two survivors.  Accident  Flight 4821 was a regularly scheduled early morning USAir Express flight from Plattsburgh, New York, to Newark, New Jersey, with intermediate stops in Saranac Lake and Albany, New York. The crew for Flight 4821 were Captain Kevin St. Germain, 30, and First Officer Dean Montana, 23. There were two passengers on board, one of which was a CommutAir employee. During the descent into Saranac Lake, the crew descended below the glide slope and crashed into a hill at 5:45am. First Officer Montana and the company employee passenger were killed. Captain St. Germain and the other passenger survived the crash with injuries.  Investigation  The NTSB blamed the pilots for the crash. Captain St. Germain failed to stabilize the approach, cross check the instruments, and descended below the minimum altitude. First Officer Montana failed to monitor the approach. The contributing factors to the crash were weather and possible precipitation static interference, which could have caused unreliable glide slope indications.

During the Second World War she served as a convoy rescue ship until a U-boat sank her in February 1943. History The ship was built by Earle's Shipbuilding of Hull and launched in 1912. In 1923 she passed into the ownership of the London and North Eastern Railway, and in 1935 to the Associated Humber Lines. On 11 August 1937 she was in collision with the Hull steam trawler Lady Beryl in the Humber off Immingham in thick fog. Both vessels were damaged but not below the water line. Her convoy rescue service began on 22 October 1941. She rescued 413 survivors from sunken ships while sailing with sixteen convoys, including convoy SC-107. On 21 February 1943 she was part of convoy ON 166 and went to the assistance of which had straggled behind the convoy in the Atlantic Ocean north of the Azores, Portugal.

Early life Sanicola was born into an Italian-American family that had its roots in Sicily. Physically large, he was a boxer in his youth and entered the music business as a roadhouse piano player. Work with Frank Sinatra Sanicola was Sinatra's original manager and \\"song plugger\\" from the late 1930s onwards. The two met in 1936 when Sanicola was promoting records for Warner Bros. Records. Due to their similar backgrounds, the two began working together with Sanicola finding jobs where he played the piano and Sinatra would sing. Sanicola was one of Sinatra's closest friends, and also served as his bodyguard during Sinatra's performances with the Tommy Dorsey band. The two were involved in several business ventures, including a partnership with Ben Barton of Barton Music Corp, and several boxing promotions. The two had a permanent falling-out in 1963 following pressure from the authorities on Sinatra to sell his Cal Neva Lodge & Casino, in which Sanicola had a 33 percent share. Sinatra once said that Sanicola was \\"one of the five most important people in my life. I couldn't have made it without him\\". In return, Sanicola said: > I was always his right arm, the strong right arm. I know how to fight. I was > an amateur fighter. I used to step in and hit guys when they started ganging > up on Frank in bars. We were both of Sicilian origin, both Italians, so we > became good friends. When Frank wasn't working, I would arrange a club date > for him and go along to accompany him. We knew, both of us, that it was only > a question of time until somebody bought Frank. Many credited Sanicola with helping Frank diversify his business interests as a hedge against the rise and fall of popularity. Sanicola and Sinatra co-wrote several songs, including \\"Mistletoe and Holly\\" (1957) (with Doc Stanford); \\"Mr. Success\\" (1958) (with Edwin Greines), which charted in the Top 50 in the U.S. and the Top 30 in the UK; and \\"This Love of Mine\\" (1941) (music by Sol Parker), which they sold to Tommy Dorsey. Later work and death After the split with Sinatra, Sanicola continued representing singers, including Billy Andre and Tony Gato, but none with the same success as Frank. Sanicola also had business interests in the Puccini restaurant. Sanicola died of a heart attack at the age of 60 in October 1974 and was buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Cathedral City. He was survived by his wife Paula and a son and daughter Joan Alicata. In popular culture Sanicola was portrayed by actor Vincent Guastaferro in the 1992 biographical miniseries Sinatra, alongside Philip Casnoff as Frank Sinatra.

Established about 1790, it is one of the few surviving 18th-century farms in the town, and was in the hands of two families for about 200 years. It is now operated as the Old Farm Christmas Place, with some of its land devoted to the cultivation of Christmas trees. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Description and history The Dyer–Hutchinson Farm is located in a rural area of Cape Elizabeth, its farmstead on the east side of Sawyer Road, a through road running north-south on the town's west side. The main farmhouse is a 1-1/2 story wood frame Cape style structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, off-center chimney, stone foundation, and a combination of shingle and clapboard siding. The main facade faces to the south, its center entrance flanked by sidelights and topped by a modest entablature. An ell extends to the right, joining the house to a garage. About to the south stands a garage- like building, with both a track-mounted garage door and a pedestrian entrance; this building was used historically for the manufacture of boxes, and houses original early 20th-century equipment for doing so. The house's interior follows a central-chimney plan, with a parlor to one side of the chimney and the kitchen to the other, with three small chambers in the back. Fireplaces have Federal period mantels, while the kitchen cabinets are of late 19th century vintage. The first of the farm were purchased in 1790 by William Dyer, who had married in that year, and the house was probably built soon afterward. According to a survey done by the town, this house is believed to be the oldest in western Cape Elizabeth. By 1850 the farm had grown to its present size, about . Dyer's children sold the property in 1864, and it was acquired by Edwin Hutchinson in 1864. It was occupied by his descendants until the 1990s, and it was by them that the box-making operation was established in the early 20th century. After standing vacant for several years, the property was rehabilitated, and is now protected by a preservation easement. It is currently used as a Christmas tree farm.
