The songs present sagas of heroes such as Aromal Chekavar and Thacholi Othenan, and heroines like Unniyarcha. They exemplify the heights of folk-poetry and are also sometimes associated with deities. Almost all these ballads show strong connections with Kalaripayattu. The oldest compositions do not date earlier than 16th century but their idiom and vocabulary seems older. The Malayalam used is devoid of Tamil and Sanskrit, and thus is probably closest to spoken idiom.Sujit Mukherjee, A Dictionary of Indian Literature (Orient Longman Publications, 1998, ), page 406Vadakkan and Thekkan Pattukal.(Sri Rama Vilasom Press, 1967), pages 128‚Äì148 However, like any other oral cultural forms that are sung by communities even today, these songs show great flexibility and a repetitive pattern in their lexicon that is typical of the simplicity of folksongs in general.

Prelude In the year 1487, for unknown but petty reasons, Bishop Jost von Silenen entered into dispute with the Count of Arona, whose seignory was the Duke of Milan. The Knight Albin von Silenen, brother of Bishop Jost von Silenen, was appointed the leader of this military expedition. As soon as the Simplon pass was passable, the Swiss crossed into the Val d'Ossola; here they were joined by another 1,000 Swiss, who were returning from Savoy. Battle The Swiss besieged Domo, occupied the castle of Mattarella, and terribly ravaged the impoverished valleys. The Duke of Milan, however, ordered the Ossolani to keep the Swiss inactive with false peace negotiations, until the duchy could dispatch a sufficient army. Once the troops were assembled, they were split into three separate corps under the command of Renato Trivulzio, Count Borromeo, and Gio. Pietro Bergamino. The Swiss were once again marauding in the villages of the Valle Vigezzo, when they were assaulted by the ducal Milanese troops from three sides. The Swiss formed a square and a murderous combat ensued, in which the Swiss lost 800-1000 men and all their baggage. The rest of the Swiss troops were allowed to flee into the impassable mountain range. The corpses of the dead Swiss were desecrated by the local peasants: the heads and fingers were cut off, the heads put on pikes and the fingers used as hat decorations. Aftermath Further bloodshed was however prevented, when a legation of the Old Swiss Confederacy negotiated a peace treaty with the Duchy of Milan on July 23, 1487. At ponte di Crevola, the Ossolani dedicated an Oratory to Martyr Saint Vitalis in honour and remembrance of this victorious battle.

In that time it was part of the Syrmia County within the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. According to 1495 data, the village was mainly populated by Serbs. In 1521, the village became part of the Ottoman Empire. In 1527-1530, it was part of the vassal Ottoman duchy of Syrmia of Serb duke Radoslav ƒåelnik and was subsequently included into the Sanjak of Syrmia. In 1718, the village became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. It was placed under military administration and was part of the Habsburg Kingdom of Slavonia. Civil administration was introduced in 1745 and the village was included into the newly formed Syrmia County. This county was part of the Habsburg Kingdom of Slavonia, which in 1744 was administratively included into the Habsburg Kingdom of Croatia and the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. In 1848-1849, the village was part of autonomous Serbian Vojvodina, and in 1849-1860 part of Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar, a separate Austrian land. After the abolishment of the voivodeship in 1860, the village was again incorporated into Syrmia County of the Kingdom of Slavonia, which was a separate Austrian land in this time. In 1868, Kingdom of Slavonia was joined with the Kingdom of Croatia into the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, which was included into the Kingdom of Hungary within the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary. The village was part of the Ruma district within the Syrmia County. In 1910, ethnic Serbs were in absolute majority in the village. In 1918, the village firstly became part of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, then part of the Kingdom of Serbia and finally part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later known as Yugoslavia). From 1918 to 1922, the village was part of the Syrmia county, from 1922 to 1929 part of the Syrmia oblast, and from 1929 to 1941 part of the Danube Banovina. During World War II, from 1941 to 1944, the village was occupied by Axis troops and was included into the Paveliƒá's Independent State of Croatia. During the war, Yugoslav partisan resistance movement was active in the area and the village was part of the partisan liberated territory in Syrmia. After defeat of the Axis troops, in 1944, the village was included into Yugoslav Vojvodina, which (from 1945) was an autonomous province of new socialist Serbia within Yugoslavia.

The Dende coconut, closely related to the Licuri palm nut, exhibits a much deeper brown complemented by light beige streaks. The Piasava coconut, with its hazel-brown shell, is the largest coconut that can be used for jewelry. This allows production of larger hoops.

However, the illuminance level is not the only factor governing visibility. Contrast is also important, and a poorly positioned light source may cause contrast reduction, resulting in loss of visibility. The most important purpose of task lighting in the office is not increasing illuminance, but improving contrast. General lighting can be reduced because task lighting provides focused light where needed. Different strategies for task lighting exist. The three main approaches are: * Localized average lighting, where a lamp supplies both ambient light and task light * Freely adjustable task light such as a gooseneck, balanced-arm lamp, or swing-arm light. * Asymmetric task light, where the lamp is placed at the side of the work area There are also other approaches to task lighting, for example under- shelf luminaires. Other instances of task lighting are in machinery, where a specific work area needs illumination, and in workshops, where a task light may illuminate the actual working area. Special instances of task lighting are examination and operation lights for medicine and surgery, as well as the dentist's lamp. Task lamps are also used for many home tasks such as sewing, reading, small repairs, model construction, crafts, writing, and many other activities. The actual task may range from very small up to about as far as you may reach with your hands or available tools. Lighting of larger areas is beyond the scope of task lighting.  Task lighting  = Localized average lighting = Localized lighting consists of a luminaire that provides ambient light as well as task light. Often it is an uplighter with a light source that is directed downward. It is intended to be mounted immediately over the workplace, lusu = Fixed task lighting = Fixed task lighting refers to a non-movable light source dedicated to lighting a specific task. In kitchens, a homeowner may install several recessed \\"can\\" lights or under cabinet lighting to provide clear lighting onto the counters for cutting and preparing food. Having proper lighting when working with sharp knives is a critical component of injury prevention. Another form of fixed task lighting may simply be a table lamp positioned over one's reading chair. = Freely adjustable task lights = The main feature of the freely adjustable task light is evident; one may adjust it freely at any whim or to suit one's needs. The lamp presents few limits to how one may position or orient the light. A freely adjustable lamp may include means for glare control, as a honeycomb or parabolic louvre that restricts the light output angle. A common form of home task lighting is a goose-neck lamp or swing arm light fixture. The adjustable neck allows light to be focused on the exact task needed, and the swing-arm wall sconces can be positioned next to a bed or chair, and adjusted to shine light on a printed page. Free standing, adjustable desk lamps are commonly used in home office applications. = Magnifying Task Lights = Some task lights also come with built in magnifying glasses for detailed tasks. It is hard to overstate the benefits of having focused light alongside magnification for small, precise operations such as model building, sewing, or other high-detail activities. Dentists often use a task light with magnification to perform dental cleanings. = Asymmetric task lighting = The asymmetric task light is intended to be placed at the side of the actual task. The luminaire directs the light obliquely over the desk, with the highest illuminance typically about 1' to 1¬Ω' to the side of the lamp head. It mostly has an arm system that holds the lamp head horizontally irrespective of the arm movement - a parallel arm. Asymmetric lamps often cause more reflected glare than other lamps. In workplaces where people use different table heights, an asymmetric lamp may cause direct glare due to its absence of means for glare control (ref:1).  Home task lighting Task lighting can also be applied to home uses. Many people benefit from dedicated lighting for specific tasks such as cooking, sewing, reading, or paperwork. Home task lighting can be found in fixed or adjustable forms.  Contrast reduction  Contrast reduction in the office workplace refers to reading objects having decreased contrast compared to an estimated ideal contrast. If a lamp is placed so that printed letters reflect some of the light, their contrast against the paper background will decrease. This happens when a light source is reflected as in a mirror from the print into the eyes of the observer. A poorly placed lamp may render text illegible, regardless of illuminance level. For older persons, increased lighting and contrast is a necessary aid to performing daily tasks such as paying bills or reading.

They were about long. Description Dolichopteridae, which lived in the Silurian and Devonian periods, had outer surfaces that were either smooth with pustules and semilunar scales. Their compound eyes were arcuate and located anteriorly on the prosoma (head). Their abdomens had epimers (lateral projections). The telson, (tail) was lanceolate. Their chelicerae were small, and the first three pairs of walking lags were stout, with powerful spines.

Penclawdd Rugby Club officially formed in 1888, but rugby has been played in the village since 1880‚Äì81, the same year as the founding of the Welsh Rugby Union. In its formative years the club had no permanent pitch, but played on suitable available ground in various areas of the village. It initially used the Dunraven Field, later Cae Dono (Dono's field) on top of the Graig, and during the years preceding the First World War, a field at Graig-y-Coed was favoured. During the 1906-06 season Penclawdd were unsuccessful in its application to join the WRU. The club was disbanded during the First World War years but re-formed once the war ended. In 1922 the club obtained its own pitch for the first time. It leased the Welfare ground known as the Rec., situated at the foot of the Graig, behind the Tabernacle Chapel. A pavilion was built on the land for the use of the Penclawdd Rugby and Cricket Clubs. In 1927 Penclawdd received Welsh Rugby Union membership, twenty two years after its initial application. The 1946‚Äì47 season saw the establishment of the Penclawdd Rugby Youth.  Club badge  The club badge is a shield divided into quarters. Each quarter contains an image associated with the area.

It was built in 1907 under the direction of William D. Fargo by the Grand Rapids - Muskegon Power Company, a predecessor of Consumers Energy. The dam impounds 7.2 billion U.S. gallons (6 billion imp. gal/27 billion L) of water in its reservoir and is capable of producing 8,850 kilowatts at peak outflow. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.  History  The history of the Croton dam is intertwined with the history of William A. Foote (1854‚Äì1915) and James B. Foote (1867‚Äì1924), brothers from Adrian, Michigan, with a burgeoning electric power empire, along with William G. Fargo, a Jackson-based civil engineer who designed similar hydroelectric plants throughout the Midwest. William A. Foote was a 30-year-old grist mill operator in Adrian, Michigan, in 1884 when, in what was then a common occurrence, he provided space and shaft power from his mill wheel to Thomson - Houston, a local electric utility startup, to light 12 streetlights. Fascinated by the potential, within a year he enlisted his then 17-year-old brother James and moved to Jackson, Michigan, and in 1886 they jointly founded Jackson Electric Light Works (a predecessor company to Consumers Energy), which began by lighting downtown Jackson electrically. The Foote brothers set up similar city specific companies in Battle Creek and Adrian within a few years. In many cases dams already built for grist mills, sawmills and the like were refit for electric generators, but in some cases, new dams were constructed. As the familiarity with the technology, and the technology itself, improved, the scope of projects became more ambitious. = Predecessor projects = The Foote brothers' first projects in Jackson, Battle Creek and Adrian, like most pre-1900 electric power projects, were created for street lighting, with some limited residential and business lighting. Since transmission of electricity over long distances was not well understood, they were situated near the cities they served. But the demand for power was growing, driven by among other things, the advent of the streetcar and increased industrial use of electricity, outstripping the capacity of smaller rivers and existing dams. So larger rivers were sought. In 1898 the Foote brothers, working with engineering partner Fargo, constructed the Trowbridge Dam across the Kalamazoo River in order to supply the city of Kalamazoo. The dam was located near Allegan, about away from the city, an unheard of distance at the time, and was the first major hydroelectric project in Western Michigan. Initially beset by power loss during transmission and other problems, the Trowbridge dam successfully provided power to a larger area than previous dams, after the Foote brothers advanced the state of the art in insulators and electric transmission equipment. = Damming the Muskegon = Location of Croton Dam (red dot). The Little Muskegon comes in from the east, while the Muskegon flows generally north to south. Vintage postcard of Croton Dam powerhouse (prior to the second 2 generating units added in 1915) Grand Rapids was a large power market to which the Footes next turned their attention. Fargo advised the Foote brothers about possible hydropower locations on the Muskegon River, which has the second largest outflow of an inland (non Great Lakes connecting) river of Michigan after the Grand River (which has a larger basin and the largest outflow of Michigan's inland rivers). An image of Michigan's inland drainage basins is here Unlike the Grand, the Muskegon is not navigable, so dams would not cause difficulty with river traffic. Through a subsidiary of their holding company, Commonwealth Power, the Grand Rapids ‚Äì Muskegon Power Company, in 1904 they commissioned the construction of Rogers Dam and Croton Dam on the Muskegon, as well as Webber Dam on the Grand River. Rogers, upstream of the Croton, was finished first, in 1906, but Croton, located where the Little Muskegon joins from the east, was a more ambitious project. One third of the village of Croton would be submerged by the impoundment lake as it began filling in August 1907. William D. Fargo was dispatched to oversee construction and served as the Chief Engineer. = Construction = Fargo developed new methods for construction of earth embankment dams on foundations of soft soils, which made use of hydraulic sluicing. The dam was built during the summer, between 25 June and 3 September 1907. The powerhouse and spillway sections of the dam were completed first, and used conventional contemporary engineering designs. Fargo then built a pumping plant employing seven electric powered rotary pumps, to move river water up a pipeline to a bluff about above the Muskegon River. A diameter reduction to increased the pressure to about 80 PSI, and the water was fed into nozzles via flexible rubber hoses. The high pressure streams of water carried away a soil water mix into iron troughs which routed the material about at a slight downgrade back to the dam site. As the material was deposited it was layered, and the water allowed to drain off, compacting it. During this phase, the river was allowed to run through the powerhouse raceways and out the spillway. Generator section of powerhouse, showing original Westinghouse generators Turbine section of powerhouse, showing newer vertical generators The Croton Dam is one of the earliest examples of the use of this technique east of the Mississippi River. The chief advantage of the hydraulic sluicing method was its cost. The total cost of constructing the embankment, which contained of material, was only $7,076, or about 7 cents per cubic yard of material moved. Fargo also used this method to construct a fill of for a highway bridge crossing the Muskegon River immediately downstream from the dam. The fill Fargo built for the highway bridge approach cost roughly the same. The Croton powerhouse has two adjoining asymmetrically connected buildings: the generator building on the west and the turbine building to the east arranged in an L shape. About 3,000 oak timber pilings support a concrete foundation, with the perimeter walls supported on sheet steel pilings, which also prevent water from undercutting the foundation. The two buildings are about in height, with Warren trusses supporting the roofs, and extend about . Two reinforced concrete retaining walls extend upstream from the northeast and northwest corners of the generator building, forming a triangle and serve as an anchor for a floating trash boom which keeps refuse out of the turbine pits. A similar triangle is formed by two reinforced concrete retaining walls extending downriver from the south side of the generator building. A concrete retaining wall extends an additional south from the tip of this triangle. When the generator building first went into operation, it housed two Westinghouse horizontal generators originally rated at 6,600 volts, operating at 225 rpm and producing 3 phase 60 cycle AC. They were driven by turbines. The voltage was stepped up to 100,000 volts using three delta-connected oil-cooled transformers of 3,000 kilowatt capacity. These were regulated with oil switches, and the transformers and switch gear were housed in the south end of the generator building. The Croton Dam and hydro plant were completed in 1907, and a grand opening was held on September 7, 1907 in the village (named after Croton-on-Hudson, New York). Contemporary accounts report that \\"Grand Rapids Mayor George Ellis and a large contingent of city and business officials journeyed north to the village of Croton on a special train. After touring the big dam, they adjourned to a nearby field for a fine dinner, followed by cigars and a friendly baseball game.\\" In order to achieve efficient power transmission over to Grand Rapids, a 100,000-volt high voltage line was built, then the highest-voltage transmission line in the world. Dr. Charles Steinmetz, the \\"wizard\\" of General Electric, visited the site and conducted tests on the transmission lines in 1908. The line voltage was increased to 110,000 volts in early 1909. = Modifications = A significant revamping and expansion of generating capacity was carried out in 1915. Additional turbines and generators were added, blurring the distinction between the buildings. The generator building got pairs of Allis-Chalmers quadriplex horizontal turbines to drive the Westinghouse horizontal generators. Each pair of turbines is rated at 4,000 horsepower when operated at 225 RPM with a hydraulic head of . The operating voltage of the two original Westinghouse horizontal generators was raised to 7,500 volts, with a corresponding increase in the line voltage from 110,000 to 115,000 volts. The turbine building was modified to take more equipment, resulting in a rearrangement of the walls to enlarge it and addition of a gable to it, similar in appearance to that on the generator building. It has a much higher floor than the generator building and received a pair of vertical turbine/generator sets. West switchyard added in 1930 The transformers and switching equipment were removed from the generator building in 1930, when a separate switchyard/substation went into service to the west of the spillway. Shortly thereafter, in 1931, Croton and Rogers dams were joined by the Hardy Dam, situated between them. The Hardy was the last major hydroelectric project constructed in Michigan by Consumers Energy. Once completed, the -high dam would later impound 7.2 billion U.S. gallons (6 billion imp. gal/27 billion L) of water in its reservoir and is capable of producing 8850 kilowatts at peak outflow. = Legacy = A historical marker sign was placed at the Croton Dam, after its completion. It read: > The Grand Rapids - Muskegon Power Company (a predecessor to today's > Consumers Energy Company) built the Croton Hydroelectric Plant in 1906 - > 1907.

The marker was replaced with a new one in 2005. The site was then listed with the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 as structure ID #79001165.  Impact and controversy  While Croton advanced the state of the art in hydroelectric engineering, it also submerged significant sections of scenic and fast-flowing stretches of the Muskegon and Little Muskegon rivers. Some conservationists believe that Croton Dam and the other dams on the Muskegon divide the long river into shorter, ecologically dysfunctional units. It blocks passage of fish from one river section to the next. It allegedly causes potentially harmful changes in water temperature and oxygen levels in a stretch of the river downstream of the dam, according to company data. Spillway and powerhouse from downstream The dam was threatened by rainfall during the flood of September 1986. The Croton and Hardy nearly failed during the peak of the flood, caused by a storm that dumped of rain on West Michigan in 48 hours. Consumers Energy officials stated that \\"had the Hardy Dam failed, the Croton Dam would have been washed away and every community from Croton to Muskegon would have been submerged under several feet of water\\". Subsequently, in 1989, Michigan state fisheries director John Robertson characterized hydroelectric dams as \\"concrete and steel monsters\\" and suggested 11 Consumers Energy dams be removed from the Muskegon, Manistee and AuSable rivers. Local officials then gathered petition signatures from 14,000 people who supported keeping the dams. The federal government has relicensed the dams through 2034, but has required operating changes reducing their harmful effects on the Muskegon River.  Current status  The Croton Dam and hydroelectric plant is owned and operated by Consumers Energy, an electric power company headquartered in Jackson, Michigan. Croton generated 44 million kilowatt hours of electricity in 2006, which would satisfy the annual electric consumption of about 6,000 residential customers. The three dams, Rogers, Hardy, and Croton (all owned and operated by Consumers Energy), are operated in different modes but in concert give a net run of river effect on water flow. The Rogers itself has little or no impoundment and runs in run of river mode, passing through as much water as it receives. The Croton and Hardy work in concert. The Hardy, which has a larger capacity reservoir, larger turbines, and is upstream of the Croton, runs in full peaking mode, meaning that the river flow is impounded and used to generate electricity during peak demand periods. This causes wide fluctuations in water flows and reservoir levels, typically with low outflow during the night when power demand is lowest. Full peaking was once very common but because of the outflow fluctuations, is now less common. However, with the Croton immediately downstream, and with no river segment (the Croton impoundment stretches back to the Hardy outlet), it can be run in re- regulation mode, allowing a natural flow rate to exit. The Croton reservoir level fluctuates inversely with the Hardy, rising during the day and lowering at night. Since the Hardy reservoir is so large, its reservoir level fluctuates about in total, while the Croton reservoir fluctuates about . During the winter and spring runoff, the Hardy is allowed to fluctuate much more. It can be drawn down up to to meet winter power demand but is required to return to normal levels by the end of April each spring. Together, the three dams (Rogers, Hardy and Croton) can generate about 45,500 kilowatts, with about 30,000 of that from the Hardy.

Early life and family Born in Little River, New Zealand in 1914, he received his education at the Christchurch Technical College. When he was 12 his father died and the burden of financial provision for his family fell to him at an early age which curtailed his aspiration of training to be a teacher which in later life he admitted still causing him to feel embittered. He came from a deeply political family with his father, Morrison Barclay, being a Liberal Party member and his uncle John was a Reform Party member. Barclay's other uncle Jim Barclay represented the electorate for the Labour Party from until his defeat in 1943. His cousin Bruce Barclay represented Christchurch Central for the Labour Party from until his death in 1979. He himself joined the Labour Party and in 1933 he was a campaign committee member for Dan Sullivan's mayoral campaign in Christchurch. Likewise in he was a campaign committee member for Tim Armstrong in . Barclay married Joy Margaret Lusty in 1940 and they had one son and one daughter. Barclay was on home service during World War II. Following the war he became a farmer, purchasing land in Kaiwaka. In 1955 he and his family moved to New Plymouth and took over ownership of a shoe store at the suggestion of mayor Everard Gilmour. He was a member of the Auckland Education Board (1949‚Äì1954) and the New Plymouth High School board (1958‚Äì1960). He was a member of the Taranaki Hospital board from 1960 to 1966. He was a trustee of the TSB Bank from 1958, and was the bank's president in 1963 and 1974. Political career Upon his discharge from the army he became active in his local branch of the Labour Party and was on the party campaign committee in the electorate in both the 1946 and 1949 elections. He was invited to be Labour's candidate in Rodney at the 1951 election but declined, citing family responsibilities. He was likewise offered the candidacy in 1954 but again refused as he was preparing to leave the electorate and was already in the process of selling his farm. Barclay eventually agreed to stand for the House of Representatives in 1957 for the Taranaki electorate of New Plymouth, but was narrowly defeated. He stood twice more unsuccessfully in 1960 and 1963 before finally winning the seat on the fourth attempt in 1966. He served as Senior Government Whip in Norman Kirk's 1972‚Äì1975 Government, and colleague Warren Freer said Barclay was an outstanding whip. When Barclay realised that Arthur Faulkner had the votes to win the first ballot for deputy to Bill Rowling in 1974, he got Freer (who was not interested in the position, but who agreed that Faulkner was not leadership material) nominated to split the first ballot vote. They both preferred either Colin Moyle (Barclay) or Bob Tizard (Freer), and Tizard won on the fourth ballot. He was the first Deputy Chairman of Committees (1975). He was unexpectedly defeated in the swing against Labour in the . He declined the offer to stand for New Plymouth in and subsequently he entered local politics serving as a New Plymouth city councillor from 1977 to 1989, including three years as deputy mayor. Honours and awards Barclay was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the community, in the 1978 New Year Honours. In the 1986 New Year Honours, he was made a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for public services. In 1990, Barclay was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. Death and legacy Barclay died in New Plymouth on 29 April 2003 and his ashes were buried in Awanui Cemetery. He was survived by his wife Joy.

Akbar Khan (Sanjay Khan' brother), directed the first 20 episodes over a span of 18 months. The remaining episodes were directed by Sanjay Khan, and he also played the leading role of Tipu Sultan. A total of 52 episodes were shot, some of them in the Premier Studios in Mysore, Karnataka. Whereas, the Music was composed by legendary Naushad and was photographed by Basheer Ali. The drama was based on a novel of the same name, written by the Montreal-based author Bhagwan S Gidwani. The novel was a best-seller, having sold about 200,000 copies, translated into many languages and reprinted in 44 editions. Apart from being the author, Gidwani also wrote the screenplay and script for the 60 episodes. The last few episodes were shot after the fire accident, a few years later.

Other countries included Iran, Indonesia and Mauritius. An original pack of 12 DVDs was later released.The Sword of Tipu Sultan A still from The Sword of Tipu Sultan with Sanjay Khan as Tipu Sultan (right) Controversies =Fire= A major fire accident took place on 8 February 1989, in the Premier Studios of Mysore where the drama was being shot. Unavailability of firefighting equipment and ignorance of fire safety standards have been quoted as the major reasons. Loose wiring and absence of ventilators were further causes for the fire to spread. Instead of fire-proofing material, the walls had gunny bags and the temperature rose to around 120¬∞C (248¬∞F) because of huge lights being used for the shooting. All these factors contributed to the massive fire; the final death toll was 62. Sanjay Khan himself suffered major burns and had to spend 13 months in hospital and undergo 72 surgeries. An ex- gratia amount of Rs.5000 was paid to the victims. Awards For his work on this drama, Sanjay Khan received the Gem of India Award.

Beaumont, A French-English Dictionary of Technical Terms Used in Classical Ballet (London: Beaumont, 1959), p. 4. Typical in the Romantic style of ballet from the nineteenth century, ballets blancs are usually populated by ghosts, dryads, naiads, enchanted maidens, fairies, and other supernatural creatures and spirits.Ivor Guest, The Romantic Ballet in Paris (Alton, Hampshire: Dance Books, 2008). History A precursor of the genre was Ballet of the Nuns, an episode in act 3 of Giacomo Meyerbeer's opera Robert le Diable. The ghosts of cloistered nuns who, in life, were unfaithful to their vows are summoned from their graves to tempt the hero, Robert, with dancing, gambling, drink, and love making.\\"Robert le Diable,\\" in The New Kobb√© Opera Book, 11th ed., edited by the Earl of Harewood and Antony Pettie (New York: Putnam's, 2000), p. 466. Choreographed by Filippo Taglioni and first presented in Paris in November 1831, it starred his daughter, Marie Taglioni as Helena, the abbess of the ruined convent of Saint Rosalia. Costumes in modern productions are usually white dresses with black sashes and headpieces. The next year, 1832, Marie Taglioni appeared in the title role of La Sylphide, the story of a wood nymph (a sylphide) who tempts a Scottish farmer, James, to abandon his rural sweetheart and follow her into the woods, in pursuit of ethereal beauty. Dance historians consider this work, as the first fully- fledged ballet blanc, to be the beginning of the Romantic movement in ballet.Horst Koegler, \\"Sylphide, La,\\" in The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Ballet, 2nd ed. (Oxford University Press, 1982). The name of the genre is derived from the white costume designed by Eug√®ne Lami for Taglioni, which became the recognized dress for dancers of the academic school. The skirt of the Romantic tutu is either mid-calf or ankle length in design.A knee-length \\"bell tutu\\" was often depicted by Edgar Degas in his paintings of Parisian ballet dancers of the 1870s. See Richard Kendall, Degas Dancers (New York: Universe/Vendome, 1996). Despite the introduction of Romantic elements of otherworldly spirits, the dancing in La Sylphide was of the purely classical school.Beaumont, A French-English Dictionary (1959), p. 4. Ghosts, shades, shadows, spirits, and other elemental beings dominated ballet stages for decades after La Sylphide. Famous ballets blancs were staged in act 2 of Giselle (1842), in acts 2 and 4 of Swan Lake (1877/1895), in act 3 of La Bayad√®re (1877), and in act 1 of The Nutcracker (1892). In modern productions, dancers in the lakeside scenes of Swan Lake and the Kingdom of the Shades scene of La Bayad√®re sometimes wear short, classical tutus rather than the traditional calf-length or ankle-length ballet dresses, but the visually stunning effect of the ballet blanc is undiminished. In 1908, Michel Fokine revived the genre in a ballet set to the music of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin that he entitled Chopiniana. When a revised version was presented in Paris in 1909 by the Ballets Russes of Sergei Diaghilev, it was given the more Romantic title of Les Sylphides.George Balanchine and Francis Mason, 101 Stories of the Great Ballets (New York: Doubleday, 1954), passim. It has remained a popular staple of the ballet repertory for the past century and more.

It had several forerunning organisations that coordinated trade union support for the Labour Party at election times such as Trade Unions for a Labour Victory and Trade Unionists For Labour. TULO is different in that, as a more formal organisation, it serves the dual purposes of not only coordinating trade union support for the Labour Party at elections, but also of acting as the channel of communication between the Party Leadership and its affiliated trade unions. Since 2002 TULO has taken a more visible role within the Labour Party, speaking up for pro-union policies. This work lead to the Warwick One Agreement (2004), which formed part of Labour's 2005 manifesto, and the Warwick Two Agreement (2008). It also led the campaigns to secure rights for Agency Workers (2007), increase statutory redundancy pay (2009), and to win compensation for sufferers of pleural plaques, a form of asbestosis (2010). Since 2010 it has rebranded its campaigning activities as UnionsTogether, and has led the way on large-scale union digital campaigning. Key campaigns have included advocating improved pensions rights for older female workers, exposing coalition attacks on working rights, the NHS Condition Critical Campaign, and the Jobs & Fair Pay campaign. It has placed a particular emphasis on exposing UKIP policies to cut workers rights such as maternity, paternity, and sick pay. TULO has been especially active on the issue of party funding, where it has sought to protect the engagement of trade unions in politics and to defend the role of the trade unions inside the Labour Party against the Conservative Party. National TULO Committee There are 13 trade unions currently affiliated to the Labour Party at national level. On affiliation to the Labour Party every union automatically becomes a member of the National Trade Union and Labour Party Liaison Organisation and its General Secretary is entitled to sit on the National TULO Committee if he or she is an individual member of the Labour Party. The Committee is jointly chaired by a member from the union side, currently Mick Whelan, and the Labour Party Leader, Keir Starmer. Between 2002 and 2016 the TULO National Officer was Byron Taylor, a former trade union officer and Labour leader on Basildon Council.

The club is a member of the Welsh Rugby Union and is a feeder club for the Llanelli Scarlets. Club history Formed in the mining village of Tumble in 1897 Tumble RFC were one of the most successful rugby teams in the old West Wales Rugby Union, and are still highly regarded for all that they achieved. The club's peak in terms of success came during the 1980s when under coaches Clive and Allan John they managed the feat of winning the President Cup five times, the Challenge Cup four times and the West Wales Championship three times. The club first won the Challenge Cup in 1933, and retained ownership of the trophy for a further two seasons. In season 1937/38 the club was crowned West Wales Champions for the first time. In season 1945/46 the club won its first post war trophy when it picked up the Challenge Cup for the fourth time. Tumble successfully defended the trophy the following season. The club won the Challenge Cup in 1946/47 and the Championship again in season 1949/50. During the next three decades the club's success waned a little. Tumble only won the Challenge Cup twice, in seasons 1962/63 and 1971/72. Then came the Eighties ‚Äì what can be seen as the club's Golden Era. In 1983/84 Tumble were crowned West Wales Champions for the first time in 34 years, a title they reclaimed the following year, along with the Challenge Cup. They held onto the cup for a further four years and in 1987/88 they won the West Wales Championship for the last time. In 1990 Tumble gained Heineken National League status. In 1991/92 the club won the Heineken League Division 4 Championship. In 1995/96 the club reclaimed the Challenge Cup for the twelfth time. The club celebrated its centenary in season 1996/97. In 2006/07 the club won the WRU Division 3 West Championship and the Brains SA Bowl. The club suffered successive relegations in seasons 2007/08 and 2008/09 and found themselves in Division 4 West at the beginning of season 2009/10. The return of brothers Arwel and Gareth Davies was the catalyst for a revival of fortunes. The 1st XV won both the 2009/10 Division 4 West title and the WWRU Brains SA Plate. League restructuring and the retirement of a number of senior players saw the club go through another period of restructuring playing in the newly created Division 3 West B. After a season of consolidation the Magpies clinched the Division 3 West B championship in 2015/16 and play 2016/17 in Division 2 West. The club has a fine history of producing players that have gone on to make a name for themselves at a higher level. One of Tumble's most notable players, was Welsh international Archie Skym. Although Skym had already moved to Llanelli RFC at the time he was first capped, he came to the attention of larger clubs when representing Tumble. He joined the team from a local side at Drefach, and in December 1926 left Tumble for the Scarlets.A Century of Welsh Rugby Players 1880-1980, Wayne Thomas; Ansell (1979) pg. 72 British Lion Gareth Davies is a native of the village and played for Tumble before making a name for himself in the 1970s and 80s with Cardiff RFC and Wales. In more recent times fellow Lion Dwayne Peel started his career with the club and played through the junior system before representing Llanelli Scarlets, Sale Sharks, Bristol, Wales and the Lions. Other notable former players from recent years are Richard Rees the Neath, Newport, Swansea, Scarlets and Wales wing, Darren Allinson the London Irish scrum half, Hugh Gustafson the Ospreys hooker, Nicholas Cudd the Newport Gwent Dragons flanker and Daniel Evans the Ospreys and Wales full back.

It is one of the newer settlements in the region, since the space where this village was located was abandoned for a long time after Ottoman rule had ended. The Hungarian population that settled here came from Dorozsma, and Fels≈ëmegye, which are located in modern-day Hungary. The first settlers had planted the hills with grapes and fruit trees, hence they named it Fels≈ësz≈ël≈ëhegy. After the desolation of grapes, the name of the settlement was shortened into Fels≈ëhegy. Economy The main occupation of the resident population is agriculture. The majority deals with vegetables and market gardening as well as glasshouse culture.

It is the opposite of leveraging, which is the practice of borrowing money to acquire assets and multiply gains and losses. At the macro-economic level, deleveraging of an economy refers to the simultaneous reduction of debt levels in multiple sectors, including private sectors and the government sector. It is usually measured as a decline of the total debt to GDP ratio in the national account. The deleveraging of an economy following a financial crisis has significant macro-economic consequences and is often associated with severe recessions. In microeconomics The leverage ratio, measured as debt divided by equity, for investment bank Goldman Sachs from 2003-2012. The lower the ratio, the greater the ability of the firm to withstand losses. While leverage allows a borrower to acquire assets and multiply gains in good times, it also leads to multiple losses in bad times. During a market downturn when the value of assets and income plummets, a highly leveraged borrower faces heavy losses due to his or her obligation to the service of high levels of debt. If the value of assets falls below the value of debt, the borrower then has a high risk to default. Deleveraging reduces the total amplification of market volatility on the borrower's balance sheet. It means giving up potential gains in good times, in exchange for lower risk of heavy loss and nasty default in bad times. However, precaution is not the most common reason for deleveraging. Deleveraging usually happens after a market downturn and hence is driven by the need to cover loss, which can deplete capital, build a less risky profile, or is required by nervous lenders to prevent default. In the last case, lenders lower the leverage offered by asking for a higher level of collateral and down payment. It is estimated that from 2006 to 2008, the average down payment required for a home buyer in the US increased from 5% to 25%, a decrease of leverage from 20 to 4., John Geanakoplos, The Leverage Cycle, Cowles Foundation, July 2009. To deleverage, one needs to raise cash to pay debt, either from raising capital or selling assets or both. A bank, for example, can cut expenditure, sell liquid assets, absorb off-balance-sheet structured investment vehicles and conduits, or allow its illiquid assets to run off at maturity, which, however, can take a long time. Deleveraging is frustrating and painful for private sector entities in distress: selling assets at a discount can itself lead to heavy losses. In addition, dysfunctional security and credit markets make it difficult to raise capital from public market. Private capital market is often no easier: equity holders usually have already incurred heavy losses themselves, bank/firm share prices have fallen substantially and are expected to fall further, and the market expects the crisis to last long. These factors can all contribute to hindering the sources of private capital and the effort of deleveraging. In macroeconomics U.S. households and financial businesses began de-leveraging in the years following the subprime mortgage crisis. Deleveraging of an economy refers to the simultaneous reduction of leverage level in multiple private and public sectors, lowering the total debt to nominal GDP ratio of the economy. Almost every major financial crisis in modern history has been followed by a significant period of deleveraging, which lasts six to seven years on average. Moreover, the process of deleveraging usually begins a few years after the start of the financial crisis. As in January 2012, four years after the start of the 2008-09 global financial crisis, many mature economies and emerging economies in the world had just begun to go through a major period of deleveraging., The Economist, Deleveraging: You ain't seen nothing yet, July 2011 This is mainly because the continuing rising of government debt, due to the Great Recession, has been offsetting the deleveraging in the private sectors in many countries. McKinsey Global Institute, Debt and deleveraging: Uneven progress on the path to growth, January 2012. =Historical episodes of deleveraging= The McKinsey Global Institute defines a significant episode of deleveraging in an economy as one in which the ratio of total debt to GDP declines for at least three consecutive years and falls by 10 percent or more. According to this definition, there have been 45 such episodes of deleveraging since 1930, including: * The Great Depression in the United States: 1929-43 * United Kingdom: 1947-80 * Malaysia: 1998-2008 * Mexico: 1982-92 * Argentina: 2002-2008 Based on this identification of deleveraging and Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff‚Äôs definition for major episodes of financial crisis,Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly, Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2009. it is found that almost every major financial crisis during the period of study has been followed by a period of deleveraging. After the 2008 financial crisis, economists expected deleveraging to occur globally. Instead the total debt in all nations combined increased by $57 trillion from 2007 to 2015 and government debt increased by $25 trillion. According to the McKinsey Global Institute, from 2007 to 2015, five developing nations and zero advanced ones reduced their debt-to-GDP ratio and 14 countries increased it by 50 percent or more. As of 2015, the ratio of debt to gross domestic product globally has increased by 17 percent after the crisis. =Macro-deleveraging process= According to a McKinsey Global Institute report, there are four archetypes of deleveraging processes: #\\"Belt- tightening\\": this is the most common path of deleveraging for an economy. In order to increase net savings, an economy reduces spending and goes through a prolonged period of austerity. # \\"High inflation\\": high inflation mechanically increases nominal GDP growth, thus reducing the debt to GDP ratio. E.g. Chile in 1984-91. # \\"Massive default\\": this usually comes after a severe currency crisis. Stock of debt immediately decreases after massive private and public sector defaults. # \\"Growing out of debt\\": if an economy experiences rapid (off-trend) real GDP growth, then its debt to GDP ratio will decrease naturally. E.g. US in 1938-43. =Macro-economic consequences of deleveraging= Massive deleveraging in corporate and financial sectors can have serious macro-economic consequences, such as triggering Fisherian debt deflation and slowing GDP growth. \\"Assessing the private sector deleveraging dynamics,\\" Quarterly Report on the Euro Area, 12(2013)1: 26-32. Cuerpo C., I. Drumond, J. Lendvai, P. Pontuch and R. Raciborski (2013), \\"Indebtedness, Deleveraging Dynamics and Macroeconomic Adjustment\\", European Economy, Economic Papers, 477 (April). In the financial market, the need to deleverage causes financial intermediaries to shed assets and stop lending, resulting in a credit crunch and tighter borrowing constraint for business, especially the small to medium-sized enterprises. Many times, this process is accompanied by a flight to quality by the lenders and investors as they seek less risky investment. However, many otherwise sound firms could go out of business due to the denied access to credit necessary for operation. Moreover, firms in distress are forced to sell assets quickly to raise cash, causing asset prices to collapse. The pressure of deflation increases the real burden of debt and spreads loss further in the economy. In addition to causing deflation pressure, firms and households deleveraging their balance sheet often increase net savings by cutting expenditures sharply. Households lower consumption, and firms fire employees and halt investment in new projects, causing unemployment rate to rise and even lower demand of assets. Empirically, consumption and GDP often contracts during the first several years of deleveraging and then recovers, which in some cases cause a fall in total savings in the economy, despite the individuals' higher propensity to save. This is known as the paradox of thrift. =Government regulation and fiscal policy= According to the theory of leverage cycle of John Geanakoplos and originally by Hyman Minsky, in the absence of intervention, leverage becomes too high in boom times and too low in bust times. As a result, asset prices become too high in boom times and too low in bad times, rather than correctly reflecting the fundamental value of assets. This recurring leveraging-deleveraging cycle is one of the most important amplifying mechanism contributing to the credit cycles and business cycles. Deleveraging is responsible for the continuing fall in the prices of both physical capital and financial assets after the initial market downturn. It is part of the process that leads the economy to recession and the bottom of the leverage cycle. Therefore, some economists, including John Geanakoplos, strongly argue that the Federal Reserve should monitor and regulate the system-wide leverage level in the economy, limiting leverage in good times and encouraging higher levels of leverage in bad times, by extending lending facilities. Moreover, it is more important to restrict leverage in ebullient times to prevent the crash from happening in the first place. In addition, in the face of massive private sector deleveraging, monetary policy has limited effect, because the economy is likely to have been pushed up against the zero lower bound, where real interest rate is negative but nominal interest rate cannot fall below zero. Some economists, such as Paul Krugman, have argued that in this case, fiscal policy should step in and deficit-financed government spending can, at least in principle, help avoid a sharp rise in unemployment and the pressure of deflation, therefore facilitating the process of private sector deleveraging and reducing the overall damage to the economy. Gauti B. Eggertsson and Paul Krugman, Debt, Deleveraging, and the Liquidity Trap: A Fisher-Minsky-Koo approach, preliminary draft, November, 2010. Note that this comes at the expense of higher government debt, which will compromise the overall deleveraging of the economy. This view is in contrast with some other economists, who argue that a problem created by excessive debt cannot be ultimately solved by running up more debt, because unsustainably high government budget deficit could seriously harm the stability and long-run prospect of the economy.

Military career Carter served in the United States Army Reserve and the National Guard from 1974 through 2012. In the Guard, he has held numerous positions including: *Commander, Army National Guard Training Site at the Massachusetts Military Reservation, Camp Edwards, Massachusetts *Assistant Adjutant General for the Joint Force Headquarters for the Massachusetts Army and Air National Guard. In August 2007 it was announced that he had been selected by Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick to succeed Brigadier General Oliver Mason and become the first African-American TAG in the 370-year history the state's Guard. He took over the position on September 21, 2007, but was officially sworn into the job on October 26, 2007 by Governor Patrick at a ceremony conducted at the Massachusetts State House. During the ceremony Carter received a 13 gun howitzer salute from the 101st Field Artillery Regiment, and was awarded the Legion of Merit. During his tenure as TAG he received a state (but not federal) promotion to Major GeneralMartin Finucane, Boston Globe, T Police Chief Will Lead State Guard, August 16, 2007 and Massachusetts has been twice recognized for excellence in Diversity and Equal Opportunity.Sgt. Jerry Saslav, Massachusetts National Guard Public Affairs , Mass Guard receives diversity award, March 16, 2011 =Suspension and retirement= On March 29, 2012 he was suspended with pay from the National Guard by Governor Patrick pending the outcome of an investigation into an allegation that he raped a servicewoman in his unit in 1984 during training at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. The accusations resurfaced in 2010 during court martial proceedings against Lt. Col. Mark Murray who serves as the Massachusetts National Guard's quartermaster. Carter initiated court martial proceedings against Murray \\"after state and federal investigations uncovered a range of alleged improprieties, including misusing federal money, hiring a convicted felon to do legal work, and threatening a whistleblower\\" and after Murray refused to resign in lieu of court martial. During the court martial, Murray alleged that the charges against him were retaliation by Carter for his role as investigating officer when the charges were first raised two years after the alleged attack. The court martial found that Murray had \\"failed to comply with federal law in managing Guard funds\\", but they voted 3 to 2 to allow Murray to retain his job. After the verdict, Murray was stripped of most of his responsibilities. It was alleged that Carter also retaliated against two of the judges in that court martial by trying to have them forced out because he was not happy with the verdict. Further investigation into the rape accusations was in part the result of a background check required for Carter's federal promotion to Major General. The promotion \\"must be approved by the Army and confirmed by the US Senate\\". During the investigation, Carter alleged that the rape charges against him are part of a long running smear campaign against him. He states that the accusations are the result of his efforts to change a law that made firing certain state military division employees impossible without a court martial. He also claims senior officials were also angry with him for changing the National Guard's work week from a ten-hour-a-day four-day-a-week work schedule to an eight-hour-a-day five-day-a-week work schedule. Carter claimed he did not remember the soldier who made the accusations and had \\"categorically denied the allegation\\". Carter also claimed to have not known of the allegations until they were raised during the 2010 court martial. This is in contrast to a statement by Murray who claims Carter was questioned during the investigation about the incident and stated \\"Well I hope this doesn't impact me some time in my future.\\" Part of Carter's denial was also contradicted by his former company commander who stated he recalled the night in question and remembered Carter helping the woman after a night of socializing. He stated that Carter and the victim got out of a car near the beach, and that Carter later returned alone. On April 3, 2012, Governor Patrick selected Massachusetts Air National Guard Major General L. Scott Rice to serve as acting Adjutant General during Carter's suspension. On September 19, 2012 BG Carter agreed to retire from the Massachusetts National Guard after a report from military investigators that \\"found probable cause that he indecently assaulted a subordinate while the two were on a training exercise in Florida in 1984\\". Investigators stated that they did not find evidence to substantiate a charge of rape, but concluded that \\"he probably touched her inappropriately, engaged in conduct unbecoming of an officer, and later made false claims about the incident\\". Carter released a statement stating that he was \\"vindicated because the Army did not deem the most serious allegation against me to be credible\\" but was \\"disappointed that the Army has found probable cause for other alleged offenses. I never assaulted anyone, and I cooperated fully with CID's investigation and told the truth\\". He further stated that he was retiring to prevent the \\"unfounded allegations\\" from becoming a distraction to the National Guard.

Traditionally, monastics observed the basic moral code in Buddhism, the PrƒÅtimok·π£a (such as that of the Dharmaguptaka), but in the Mahayana tradition, monks may observe the Bodhisattva Precepts as well. Sets of Precepts =Brahmajala Sutra= The Brahmajala Sutra, translated by KumƒÅrajƒ´va (c. 400 CE), has a list of ten major and forty-eight minor Bodhisattva vows. The Bodhisattva Precepts may be often called the \\"Brahma Net Precepts\\" (), particularly in Buddhist scholarship, although other sets of bodhisattva precepts may be found in other texts as well. Typically, in East Asian Mahayana traditions, only the ten major precepts are considered the bodhisattva precepts. According to the sutra, the ten major bodhisattva precepts are in summary: # Not to kill or encourage others to kill. # Not to steal or encourage others to steal. # Not to engage in licentious acts or encourage others to do so. A monk is expected to abstain from sexual conduct entirely. # Not to use false words and speech, or encourage others to do so. # Not to trade or sell alcoholic beverages or encourage others to do so. # Not to broadcast the misdeeds or faults of the Buddhist assembly, nor encourage others to do so. # Not to praise oneself and speak ill of others, or encourage others to do so. # Not to be stingy, or encourage others to do so. # Not to harbor anger or encourage others to be angry. # Not to speak ill of the Buddha, the Dharma or the Sangha (lit. the Triple Jewel)) or encourage others to do so. Breaking any of these precepts is described as a major offense in the sutra. A fuller description is as follows: =Bodhisattvabhumi= Asanga (circa 300 CE) delineated 18 major vows and forty-six minor vows in the \\"Bodhisattvabhumi\\" section of the YogƒÅcƒÅrabh≈´mi ≈öƒÅstra.Gyatso 1995, pp.13-34 These Bodhisattva vows are still used in all four major traditions of Tibetan Buddhism. The eighteen major vows (as actions to be abandoned) are as follows: # Praising oneself or belittling others due to attachment to receiving material offerings, praise and respect. # Not giving material aid or (due to miserliness) not teaching the Dharma to those who are suffering and without a protector. # Not listening to others' apologies or striking others. # Abandoning the Mahayana by saying that Mahayana texts are not the words of Buddha or teaching what appears to be the Dharma but is not. # Taking things belonging to the Buddha, Dharma or Sangha. # Abandoning the holy Dharma by saying that texts which teach the three vehicles are not the Buddha's word. # With anger depriving ordained ones of their robes, beating and imprisoning them or causing them to lose their ordination even if they have impure morality, for example, by saying that being ordained is useless. # Committing any of the five extremely negative actions: (1) killing one's mother, (2) killing one's father, (3) killing an arhat, (4) intentionally drawing blood from a Buddha or (5) causing schism in the Sangha community by supporting and spreading sectarian views. # Holding distorted views (which are contrary to the teaching of Buddha, such as denying the existence of the Three Jewels or the law of cause and effect etc.) # Destroying towns, villages, cities or large areas by means such as fire, bombs, pollution or black magic. # Teaching emptiness to those whose minds are unprepared. # Causing those who have entered the Mahayana to turn away from working for the full enlightenment of Buddhahood and encouraging them to work merely for their own liberation from suffering. # Causing others to abandon their PrƒÅtimok·π£a vows. # Belittling the ≈örƒÅvakayƒÅna or PratyekabuddhayƒÅna (by holding and causing others to hold the view that these vehicles do not abandon attachment and other delusions). # Falsely stating that oneself has realised profound emptiness and that if others meditate as one has, they will realize emptiness and become as great and as highly realized as oneself. # Taking gifts from others who were encouraged to give you things originally intended as offerings to the Three Jewels. Not giving things to the Three Jewels that others have given you to give to them, or accepting property stolen from the Three Jewels. # Causing those engaged in calm-abiding meditation to give it up by giving their belongings to those who are merely reciting texts or making bad disciplinary rules which cause a spiritual community not to be harmonious. # Abandoning either of the two types of bodhicitta (aspiring and engaging). According to Ati≈õa, the PrƒÅtimok·π£a vows are the basis for the Bodhisattva vows. Without keeping one of the different sets of PrƒÅtimok·π£a vows (in one of the existing Vinaya schools), there can be no Bodhisattva vow. =The Sixteen Bodhisattva Precepts in S≈çt≈ç Zen= In the S≈çt≈ç school of Zen, the founder D≈çgen established a somewhat expanded version of the Bodhisattva Precepts for use by both priests and lay followers, based on both Brahma Net Sutra and other sources.

The Ten Grave Precepts  *Respect life ‚Äì Do not kill *Be giving ‚Äì Do not steal *Honor the body ‚Äì Do not misuse sexuality *Manifest truth ‚Äì Do not lie *Proceed clearly ‚Äì Do not cloud the mind *See the perfection ‚Äì Do not speak of others' errors and faults *Realize self and others as one ‚Äì Do not elevate the self and blame others *Give generously ‚Äì Do not be withholding *Actualize harmony ‚Äì Do not be angry *Experience the intimacy of things ‚Äì Do not defile the Three Treasures Traditional uses =Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese traditions= The Chinese Chan monk, Yin Shun, wrote of the Bodhisattva Precepts, \\"To cultivate bodhi mind means to accept the bodhisattva precepts and practice the ten good deeds.\\" In practice, the acceptance of and ordination of the Bodhisattva Precepts varies greatly depending on the school of Mahayana Buddhism. In East Asian Buddhism, a fully ordained monk or nun ordains under the traditional prƒÅtimok·π£a precepts first according to the vinaya of the Dharmaguptaka. In the Chinese tradition, this is called the Four Part Vinaya (). Then as a supplement, the same disciple would undertake the Bodhisattva Precepts as well. Monks and nuns are not considered \\"ordained\\" by the Bodhisattva Precepts, but rather by the \\"Four Part Vinaya\\", while the Bodhisattva Precepts served to strengthen the Mahayana ideals. Similarly, the Bodhisattva Precepts are given to lay disciples to strengthen their devotion to Buddhism as well. Such disciples often take the basic Five Precepts and then the Bodhisattva precepts as a supplement. =Japanese traditions= In Buddhism in Japan, the \\"Four-Part Vinaya\\" was deemphasized with the rise of Saich≈ç and the Tendai sect and a new monastic community was set up exclusively using the Brahmajala Sutras Bodhisattva Precepts. All Vinaya ordinations at the time were given at T≈çdai-ji in Nara and Saich≈ç had wanted to both undermine the power of the Nara Buddhist community and to establish a \\"purely Mahayana lineage\\", and made a request to the Emperor to Later Buddhist sects, which was granted 7 days after his death in 822. Later Buddhist sects in Japan, including the S≈çt≈ç school of Zen, J≈çdo-sh≈´ and Shingon Buddhism, adopted a similar approach to their monastic communities and exclusive use of the Bodhisattva Precepts. By this time in Japan, the Vinaya lineage had all but died out and Japan's remote location made it difficult to reestablish though limited efforts by J≈çkei and the Shingon Risshu revived it for a time. This was further enforced during the Meiji period, when the of 1872 decriminalized clerical marriage and meat- eating.Horii, Mitsutoshi (2006).

He was the patron saint of several professions, locales, and kingdoms. He is also a revered saint in the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria and other churches of Oriental Orthodoxy. Hagiography =Early life= According to the hagiographical material, Maurice was an Egyptian, born in AD 250 in Thebes, an ancient city in Upper Egypt that was the capital of the New Kingdom of Egypt (1575-1069 BC). He was brought up in the region of Thebes (Luxor). =Career= Maurice became a soldier in the Roman army. He was gradually promoted until he became the commander of the Theban legion, thus leading approximately a thousand men. He was an acknowledged Christian at a time when early Christianity was considered to be a threat to the Roman Empire. Yet, he moved easily within the pagan society of his day. The legion, entirely composed of Christians, had been called from Thebes in Egypt to Gaul to assist Emperor Maximian in defeating a revolt by the bagaudae.Mershman, Francis. \\"St. Maurice,\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia, Vol. 10. New York City: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 6 Mar. 2013 The Theban Legion was dispatched with orders to clear the Great St Bernard Pass across the Alps. Before going into battle, they were instructed to offer sacrifices to the pagan gods and pay homage to the emperor. Maurice pledged his men‚Äôs military allegiance to Rome. He stated that service to God superseded all else. He said that to engage in wanton slaughter was inconceivable to Christian soldiers. He and his men refused to worship Roman deities. =Martyrdom= However, when Maximian ordered them to harass some local Christians, they refused. Ordering the unit to be punished, Maximian had every tenth soldier killed, a military punishment known as decimation. More orders followed, the men refused compliance as encouraged by Maurice, and a second decimation was ordered. In response to the Theban Christians' refusal to attack fellow Christians, Maximian ordered all the remaining members of his legion to be executed. The place in Switzerland where this occurred, known as Agaunum, is now Saint-Maurice, Switzerland, site of the Abbey of St. Maurice. So reads the earliest account of their martyrdom, contained in the public letter which Bishop Eucherius of Lyon (c. 434‚Äì450), addressed to his fellow bishop, Salvius. Alternative versions have the legion refusing Maximian's orders only after discovering innocent Christians had inhabited a town they had just destroyed, or that the emperor had them executed when they refused to sacrifice to the Roman gods. Historicity There is a difference of opinion among researchers as to whether or not the story of the Theban Legion is based on historical fact, and if so, to what extent. The legend, by Eucherius of Lyon, is classed by Bollandist Hippolyte Delehaye among the historical romances. Donald F. O'Reilly, in Lost Legion Rediscovered, argues that evidence from coins, papyrus, and Roman army lists support the story of the Theban Legion.O'Reilly, Donald F., Lost Legion Recovered, Pen & Sword Military, 2011 Denis Van Berchem, of the University of Geneva, proposed that Eucherius' presentation of the legend of the Theban legion was a literary production, not based on a local tradition.Van Berchem, Denis, The Martyrdom of the Theban Legion, Basel, 1956. The monastic accounts themselves do not specifically state that all the soldiers were collectively executed; an eleventh-century monk named Otto of Freising wrote that most of the legionaries escaped, and only some were executed.Donald F. O'Reilly. The Theban Legion of St. Maurice. Vigiliae Christianae. Vol. 32, No. 3, Sep., 1978. Afterlife =Veneration= Saint Maurice became a patron saint of the German Holy Roman Emperors. In 926, Henry the Fowler (919‚Äì936), even ceded the present Swiss canton of Aargau to the abbey, in return for Maurice's lance, sword and spurs. The sword and spurs of Saint Maurice were part of the regalia used at coronations of the Austro-Hungarian emperors until 1916, and among the most important insignia of the imperial throne. In addition, some of the emperors were anointed before the Altar of Saint Maurice at St. Peter's Basilica. In 929, Henry the Fowler held a royal court gathering (Reichsversammlung) at Magdeburg. At the same time the Mauritius Kloster in honor of Maurice was founded. In 961, Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor, was building and enriching Magdeburg Cathedral, which he intended for his own tomb. To that end, Maurice is traditionally depicted in full armor, in Italy emblazoned with a red cross. In folk culture he has become connected with the legend of the Holy Lance, which he is supposed to have carried into battle; his name is engraved on the Holy Lance of Vienna, one of several relics claimed as the spear that pierced Jesus' side on the cross. Saint Maurice gives his name to the town St. Moritz as well as to numerous places called Saint-Maurice in French speaking countries. The Indian Ocean island state of Mauritius was named after Maurice, Prince of Orange, and not directly after Maurice himself. Over 650 religious foundations dedicated to Saint Maurice can be found in France and other European countries. In Switzerland alone, seven churches or altars in Aargau, six in the Canton of Lucerne, four in the Canton of Solothurn, and one in Appenzell Innerrhoden can be found (in fact, his feast day is a cantonal holiday in Appenzell Innerrhoden). Particularly notable among these are the Church and Abbey of Saint-Maurice-en-Valais, the Church of Saint Moritz in the Engadin, and the Monastery Chapel of Einsiedeln Abbey, where his name continues to be greatly revered. Several orders of chivalry were established in his honor as well, including the Order of the Golden Fleece, Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus, and the Order of Saint Maurice. Additionally, fifty-two towns and villages in France have been named in his honor.Butler's Lives of the Saints, New Full Edition, September, p.206. Collegeville, MN:The Liturgical Press, 1999. . Maurice was also the patron saint of a Catholic parish and church in the 9th Ward of New Orleans and including part of the town of Arabi in St. Bernard Parish. The church was constructed in 1856, but was devastated by the winds and flood waters of Hurricane Katrina on 29 August 2005; the copper-plated steeple was blown off the building. The church was subsequently deconsecrated in 2008, and the local diocese put it up for sale in 2011. By 2014, a local attorney had purchased the property for a local arts organization, after which the building served as both an arts venue and the worship space for a Baptist church that had been displaced following the hurricane. On 19 July 1941, Pope Pius XII declared Saint Maurice to be patron Saint of the Italian Army's Alpini (mountain infantry corps).Esercito Italiano: I Patroni delle Armi Corpi e Specialit√† - Gli Alpini The Alpini have celebrated Maurice's feast every year since then. The Synaxarium of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria does not mention Saint Maurice, although there are several Coptic churches named for him. =Apparition= The Our Lady of Laus apparitions included an apparition of Saint Maurice. He appeared in an antique episcopal vestment and told Beno√Æte Rencurel that he was the one to whom the nearby chapel was dedicated, that he would fetch her some water (before drawing some water out of a well she had not seen), that she should go down to a certain valley to escape the local guard and see Mary, mother of Jesus, and that Mary was both in Heaven and could appear on Earth.\\"Our Lady of Laus\\", Magnificat Vol. XL, No. 5 and Vol. XXXVI, No. 5. Coptic icon of St.Maurice and Theban Legion =Patronage= Maurice is the patron saint of the Duchy of Savoy (France) and of the Valais (Switzerland) as well as of soldiers, swordsmiths, armies, and infantrymen. In 1591 Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy arranged the triumphant return of part of the relics of Saint Maurice from the monastery of Agaune in Valais. He is also the patron saint of weavers and dyers. Manresa (Spain), Piedmont (Italy), Montalbano Jonico (Italy), Schiavi di Abruzzo (Italy), Stadtsulza (Germany) and Coburg (Germany) have chosen St. Maurice as their patron saint as well. St Maurice is also the patron saint of the Brotherhood of Blackheads, a historical military order of unmarried merchants in present-day Estonia and Latvia.Rannu, Elena. 1993. The Living Past of Tallinn. 3rd ed. Tallinn: Perioodika Publishers. pp. 23-29. In September 2008, certain relics of Maurice were transferred to a new reliquary and rededicated in Schiavi di Abruzzo (Italy). =Portrayal= St. Maurice began being portrayed as a dark- complexioned African in the 12th century. The oldest surviving image that depicts Saint Maurice as a black African in knight's armorSuckale-Redlefsen and Robert Suckale ,(c1987), Mauritius der heilige Mohr/ The Black Saint Maurice,Houston, Texas, Menil Foundation, page 19. was sculpted in mid-13th century for Magdeburg Cathedral; there it is displayed next to the grave of Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor. Jean Devisse, The Image of the Black in Western Art, laid out the documentary sources for the saint's popularity and documented it with illustrative examples. When the new cathedral was built under Archbishop Albert II of K√§fernberg (served 1205-32), a relic said to be the head of Maurice was procured from the Holy Land. The image of Saint Maurice has been examined in detail by Gude Suckale-Redlefsen,Suckale- Redlefsen and Robert Suckale, Mauritius der heilige Mohr/ The Black Saint Maurice. English translation of foreword and introduction by Genoveva Nitz. (Houston/Zurich) 1988. A catalogue of 205 images of St. Maurice is included. who demonstrated that this image of Maurice has existed since Maurice's first depiction in Germany between the Weser and the Elbe, and spread to Bohemia, where it became associated with the imperial ambitions of the House of Luxembourg. According to Suckale-Redlefsen, the image of Maurice reached its apogee during the years 1490 to 1530. Images of the saint died out in the mid- sixteenth century, undermined, Suckale-Redlefsen suggests, by the developing Atlantic slave trade. \\"Once again, as in the early Middle Ages, the color black had become associated with spiritual darkness and cultural 'otherness'\\".Dorothy Gillerman, reviewing Suckale-Redlefsen 1988 in Speculum 65.3 (July 1990:764 ).

Not very much is known about them. They settled in what became East Sussex sometime before the end of the 8th century. A 12th-century source suggested that they were conquered by Offa of Mercia, in 771. They were also recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (ASC) as being an autonomous grouping as late as the 11th century. History The foundation legend of the Kingdom of the South Saxons is given by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which states that in the year AD 477 √Ülle arrived at a place called Cymenshore in three ships with his three sons.ASC 477. English translation at Project Gutenberg. Accessdate 19 December 2012. Traditionally Cymenshore is thought to have been located around the Selsey area, in the south west of Sussex. However the archaeological evidence indicates that the principal area of settlement in the 5th century, for the South Saxons, has been identified as between the lower Ouse and Cuckmere rivers in East Sussex, based on the number of Anglo-Saxon cemeteries there.Martin Welch. Early Anglo-Saxon Sussex in Peter Brandon's. The South Saxons. pp. 23-25. The Anglo-Saxon settlements of south east Britain c. 572 AD To the east of Pevensey, beyond the Saxon Shore fort of Anderitum, on the other side of the estuary and marsh and from there to the border with the Kingdom of Kent, were a group of people who settled that were known as the Haestingas.Armstrong. A History of Sussex. p. 39Peter Hunter Blair, Roman Britain and Early England, 55 BC-AD 871. p.177 They gave their name to Hastings. Not very much is known of the Haestingas but they were believed to be a separate people to the South Saxons, however there is no archaeological evidence for occupation by Anglo-Saxons in that area of Sussex between the 5th and 8th century. Medieval sources and place name evidence suggest that there were people living there by the late 8th century.Martin Welch. Early Anglo Saxon Sussex in Peter Brandon's. The South Saxons. pp. 33-34 Some of the Saxon charters that date from the Kingdom of Sussex provide evidence which suggests the existence of two separate dynasties in Sussex.

Charters of Selsey. p. lxxix Towards the end of the 8th century, Kent did not have a secure leadership and the kingdom of Wessex was pursuing an expansionist campaign under C√¶dwalla; the result was that Kent found itself being raided frequently by the West Saxons.Kirby.

The agreement may have included some ceding of border territory, and it has been hypothesized that the overlordship of Haestingas would have been ceded to Ine as part of this treaty. The southern kingdoms lived in relative peace for the next quarter century. The peace was shattered by the ascent of Mercian power; the chronicler Simeon of Durham records the defeat of the gens Hestingorum (the people of Hastings) by Offa of Mercia in 771.Simon of Durham. Historia Regum. Ch. 47Simeon of Durham's. History of the Kings. p. 450 Mercian overlordship was ended when they were defeated in 825, by Egbert of Wessex, at the Battle of Ellandun.

The Earliest English Kings. p. 155 However it is known that the Haestingas retained a distinct identity till the 11th century as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records the Haestingas as having been harried by the Danes in 1011. The 19th century writer, Grant Allen argued that the Hastings region was predestined to be a separate region between the rest of Sussex and Kent, to later join with Sussex.Grant Allen. An English Shire in Urban Sylvanus. The Gentleman's Magazine .v252. January‚ÄìJune. pp. 49-70. Retrieved 2 December 2013 Effectively isolated, the region was separated from the rest of Sussex and England by the marshland of the Pevensey Levels lying to the west and the forest of the Weald to the north, while Romney Marsh separates the region from Kent to the east. The kingdom of the Haestingas went on to join Sussex and become the rape of Hastings. Origins It has been suggested that the Haestingas were of Frankish origin, based on Watt being a sub-king to the South Saxons and there being a place-name of Watten in northern France. However, the more probable explanation is that the Haestingas were Jutes who migrated from Kent. Kent was the earliest Anglo-Saxon kingdom to be evangelized, at the beginning of the 7th century, and it was at this time that the simplified Christian burial was introduced. As there is little archaeological evidence for the Haestingas it is likely that they were already Christian, when they moved to Sussex . Etymology Haestingas is from Old English and means settlement of Haesta's People. Haesta would have been the chieftain or ruler and -ingas means People.Ayto. Brewer's Britain and Ireland. p. 520Gelling. Place-Names in the Landscape. p. 2 It is possible that the founder may have been a forebear of the Viking leader Hastein (who invaded Kent in 892), but there is no evidence to support this hypothesis.

FUF was organized as a response to San Francisco's lack of trees. The group's first tree planted was a glossy privet on arbor day, 1981, in Noe Valley. As of 2006, the organization had planted approx. 40,000 trees.  Background  San Francisco was originally mostly sand dunes and had only a small population of native trees. Fog, wind, cold weather, and salty air made it difficult for native and planted trees to survive. Only buckeye and Pacific willow were common. Most of the 90,000 trees in the city were planted in the 1880s through 1920s as part of large parks and properties. Monterey Pines and Eucalyptus trees were planted in the San Francisco Presidio, Stern Grove, and Golden Gate Park. However, these Monterey Pines have been affected by pitch pine canker and have been dying.  Importance  At 12%, San Francisco's tree canopy cover remains considerably under the 22% national average. Benefits to planting more trees include aesthetics, improved property values (mature trees are said to increase surrounding property values by approximately 1%), helping with global warming by absorbing carbon dioxide and providing oxygen, and energy savings due to increased tree canopy. Even at more than 5,000 trees per year as of 2006, San Francisco's tree-planting efforts were modest compared to other cities in California and throughout the world. That year Los Angeles announced plans to plant one million trees, and the United Nations had raised funds to plant 121 million trees towards a goal of one billion trees.

The Church of Santa Maria di Costantinopoli is a 16th-century Roman Catholic church located on the street of the same name in Naples, Italy, and located a block north of the Academy of Fine Arts of Naples. History Its name is allied to the cult of St Mary of Constantinople, the icon image of the virgin attributed originally to St Luke, which rose to prominence in 1527-1528, during one of the frequent attacks of plague afflicting the city. During this time, an elderly woman experienced an apparition of the Virgin who pleaded for the construction of a church where her image stood on a wall. Legend holds the image that was discovered prevented further outbreaks of the plague in Naples. Construction began in 1575, and continued till completion in the first years of the 17th century under the intervention of the Dominican architect Giuseppe Nuvolo. The fa√ßade was completed in 1633. The design is generally conservative with a central linear nave and two aisles, each with five chapels. The interior was decorated in stucco by Domenico Antonio Vaccaro; the vaulting uses gilded wood. The chapel entries have carved lintelpieces by Niccol√≤ Tagliacozzi Canale (1728). The first chapel on the right has an altarpiece of the Madonna of the Purity (17th century); the fourth chapel has a painting of the Martyrdom of St. Bartholemew (c. 1585) by the Flemish painter Aert Mytens.

It is in communion with other members of the worldwide Anglican Communion. ACT began with the Parish of Christ Church Bangkok. From 1991 onwards, new daughter churches and ministries were planted, as part of a process of growing to becoming a Diocese of Thailand. History =English Language= On 26 July 1861, at the request of a group of mostly British non-Roman Catholic Christians, King Mongkut granted land near the Protestant Cemetery on the Chao Phraya River to the ‚ÄúCommunity of foreigners who are of Protestant Christian faith‚Äù to be used for a church building. The \\"Protestant Union Chapel\\" or informally the \\"English Church\\" opened for worship on 1 May 1864. Except during 1869 -1892, when services were mostly of a Presbyterian nature, services were conducted according to the Anglican rite. On 16 February 1896, George Hose, Anglican Bishop of Singapore, Labuan and Sarawak conducted the first confirmation in the chapel. On 7 April 1904, King Chulalongkorn granted permission to sell the river site and gave land off North Sathorn Road for the erection of a new church. The new church, named ‚ÄúChrist Church‚Äù, was dedicated on 30 April 1905. Christ Church Bangkok was upgraded from a Chaplaincy to become a Parish of the Diocese of Singapore in 1963 when the Archdeacon of North Malaya, on behalf of the Bishop of Singapore, instituted and inducted J. E. Ironside as the first vicar. Numerous English-speakers have worshipped at Christ Church including Elizabeth II and Margaret Thatcher. =Thai Language= Worship in Thai began during the years 1934‚Äì1940 using a prayer book translated by C. W. Norwood with the help of Thai nationals, but it was more than fifty years before the church was able to find a Thai-speaking clergyman. In 1991, Gerry Khoo was appointed as assistant priest. The first meeting of a Thai congregation was attended by seven people in a small conference room. Since then the Thai congregation has grown markedly. The Rainbowland Child Development Centre, a ministry of the Thai congregation, opened at Christ Church in 1998. There has also been a massive expansion of the church in other parts of Thailand. Christ Church Banchang was established in 1996. Christ Church Sawang Daendin was established in 1999. A Church was planted in Korat Province in 2002. Registration The Anglican Church in Thailand was registered with the Evangelical Fellowship of Thailand on 9 May 1994.

The meeting was held from August 11‚Äì15, 1980, at the Glacier View Ranch, a church-owned retreat and conference centre in Colorado, United States. The event is referred to informally as \\"Glacier View\\". The outcome was Ford losing his job. It was also the largest investment of money and time of church workers ever given to a doctrinal issue in Adventist history.Hammill, 1992:197; as quoted in Ballis, Leaving the Adventist Ministry At the time, one scholar stated it was the most significant Adventist meeting of its type since the 1888 Minneapolis General Conference Session. Ford's firing was a controversial and emotionally charged issue, and the church experienced the largest exit of teachers and ministers in its history. One modern commentator describes 'Glacier View' as \\"Adventist shorthand for pain, dissension and division\\".\\"Twenty-Five Years After Glacier View\\" by Arthur Patrick. Adventist Today 13:6  Background  The investigative judgment doctrine has been criticized, in part or whole, by a few vocal Adventists since the late nineteenth century, such as D. M. Canright, A. F. Ballenger, W. W. Fletcher, W. W. Prescott, Louis R. Conradi, and Raymond Cottrell.Des Ford, Daniel 8:14, The Day of Atonement and the Investigative Judgment Many of these individuals ultimately left the Adventist church. Issues with the traditional Adventist interpretation of Daniel 8:14 were acknowledged by a number of North American theologians in the 1950s, with the result that a special committee was formed to discuss \\"problems in the book of Daniel\\". In the 1970s, dissident Australian former church member Robert Brinsmead attempted to convince leading Adventist theologians Desmond Ford and Edward Heppenstall to write a refutation of it.Where is Robert Brinsmead? by Larry Pahl; Adventist Today 7:3 (May/June 1999) Brinsmead said he hesitated \\"blasting this theology because I thought someone from within Adventism should do it.\\" After Ford and Heppenstall declined his request, Brinsmead returned to Australia and wrote the critical work \\"1844\\" Re-Examined which he published in July 1979. Desmond Ford, described by Time magazine as \\"a prominent Australian theologian\\", had been lecturing in theology at Avondale College in Australia. However due to criticisms of his theology the church moved him to the United States in 1977, where he began lecturing at Pacific Union College.L. R. Tarling, The Edges of Seventh-day Adventism (Bermagui South: Galilee, 1981), 215-16; D. Ford, \\"The Historical Background of the Crisis,\\" in D. & G. Ford, The Adventist Crisis of Spiritual Identity (Newcastle, Cal.: Desmond Ford Publications, 1982), 23. Though Ford and Brinsmead had known each other on friendly terms since their student days at Avondale in the 1950s, Ford had spent years in his capacity as a minister and theology professor employed by the Adventist church being asked to respond to Brinsmead's views and opposing his perfectionistic doctrines. When Brinsmead repudiated his earlier views by the early 1970s and embraced more traditional Protestant views of salvation that had been championed by Ford, the men found themselves in substantial agreement on many points. By invitation in response to the circulation of Brinsmead's new book, on 27 October 1979 Ford delivered an address to the Association of Adventist Forums (now Adventist Forums), held at Pacific Union College, in which he outlined the major problems that he perceived with the doctrine and briefly suggested his solution, in which he attempted to apply the \\"Apotelesmatic Principle\\" to the traditional Adventist interpretations of the ministry of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary, the Day of Atonement, Daniel 8:14, and Hebrews 9 and 10. Ford argued Adventist church co-founder Ellen White had already set a precedent in this regard. The talk was entitled, The Investigative Judgment: Theological Milestone or Historical Necessity?.Desmond Ford, The Investigative Judgment: Theological Milestone or Historical Necessity? Ford claims that he had been granted immunity to speak his views publicly at this conference. However, the meeting was taped, and copies of the tape were quickly circulated widely by Brinsmead with his book and by others. Already a controversial figure among Adventists in Australia and linked in many minds with Brinsmead, Ford's talk was rumored to be a coordinated attack with Brinsmead on church teachings. The church‚Äôs leadership responded by summoning Ford to a meeting of 111 theologians and church administrators to evaluate his views. Before the meeting, he was given 6 months of paid leave during which he prepared a 991-page manuscript entitled Daniel 8:14, the Day of Atonement, and the Investigative Judgment, which began \\"The present writer has as his intent the defense of the church.\\" It is also known as the \\"Glacier View manuscript.\\"Dr. Desmond Ford's reply to Dr. Richard Davidson by Desmond Ford. Richard M. Davidson's article was, \\"Desmond Ford and Church Reconciliation\\", Adventist Today Ford later summarised the manuscript in an article for Spectrum. The Glacier View meeting The \\"Sanctuary Review Committee\\" met at Glacier View Ranch near Denver in Colorado from August 11‚Äì15, 1980. Ford presented his views to the Glacier View attendees as presented in his document. According to Time, he \\"made the case that Ellen G. White's 'sanctuary' explication of 1844 no longer stood up in the light of the Bible, and that 'investigative judgment' undercut the whole basis of Protestantism: belief in salvation by God's grace apart from good works.\\" His criticisms included, * The \\"year-for-a-day\\" principle is an incorrect method for interpreting prophecy. (The 1844 date for the commencement of the judgment is thus invalidated.) * The prophecy of Daniel chapter 8 is primarily concerned with events in the 2nd century BC (namely, the persecution of the Jews by the Syrian king Antiochus Epiphanes), and there is no contextual or linguistic support for linking it to the heavenly sanctuary. The \\"cleansing\\" in Daniel 8:14 relates to the removal of the desecration caused by the \\"little horn\\" (i.e. Antiochus Epiphanes); it has nothing to do with the sins of Christians. In fact, the Hebrew word translated \\"cleansed\\" in the KJV (sadaq) is different from the word used for \\"cleansing\\" (taher) in the book of Leviticus in connection with the sanctuary; it is more accurately translated \\"vindicated\\" or \\"restored\\", as in most modern Bible versions. * The epistle to the Hebrews teaches that the Day of Atonement was fulfilled by the death of Jesus on the cross. In particular, Hebrews 6:19, 9:12 and 10:19-20 teach that Jesus entered into the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary immediately after his ascension, not 1800 years later. Hebrews thus contradicts the traditional Adventist idea of a two-stage heavenly ministry of Christ. The Glacier View meeting ultimately produced two consensus statements, entitled ‚ÄúChrist in the Heavenly Sanctuary‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Role of Ellen G. White in Doctrinal Matters.‚Äù In addition, a ten-point summary was formulated by six of the attendees, outlining the main points of difference between Ford‚Äôs positions and traditional Adventist teaching.Spectrum volume 11, no. 2 (Nov 1980) One month after Glacier View, Ford's employment with the Adventist church was terminated, and his ministerial credentials revoked. This paper was presented to the Sydney Adventist Forum in 2005 After counsel from the General Conference, the Australasian Division withdrew \\"Ford's ministerial credentials, noting that this does not annul his ordination...\\" Ford has claimed that Glacier View initially \\"produced a consensus statement that moved towards Dr. Ford's conclusions in seven out of ten of his major positions\\", but that by the conclusion of the meeting the church \\"reverted to their former traditional positions\\".See biography of Des Ford, from the Good News Unlimited website. Others have claimed that although theologians present at Glacier View sympathised with Ford's position, they were \\"intimidated into silence by ecclesiological pressure\\"; the Adventist church has denied this to be the case.W. H. Johns, The ABCs of Dr. Desmond Ford's Theology, Copyright ¬© 2006 Biblical Research Institute, General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists These events were well documented by the independent Adventist journal Spectrum in its November 1980 issue. :\\"Ford [later] recalled the moment Raymond Cottrell came to him at Glacier View and with some foreboding said, 'Des, the administrators have not read your manuscript.' Cottrell may have overstated the case but it was a disturbing observation.\\"\\"Report: Sydney Australia Adventist Forum Remembers Glacier View Twenty-Five Years Later \\" by Dr. Milton Hook, former president of Sydney Adventist Forum, January 16, 2006 Ford has suggested that allegations of collusion with fellow controversial Australian figure Robert Brinsmead were a part of the proceedings. According to one report, towards the end of the meetings \\"a small group of church executives\\" confronted Ford with ultimatums such as \\"Publicly denounce Robert Brinsmead as a troublemaker and heretic or hand in your credentials.\\" According to the report, \\"intense pressure brought to bear on Parmenter by a group of ultra-conservative members in Australia\\" added to the eventual dismissal of Ford from ministry. Ford would not denounce Brinsmead, who had \\"converted\\" from his perfectionist views. According to Ford, \\"John Brinsmead, brother of Robert, had evidently spun [then Australasian Division president Keith] Parmenter the allegation that Ford and Robert Brinsmead were in cahoots and determined to bring the SDA church down.\\" According to Ford, Parmenter had apparently accepted this \\"allegation without verification\\". = Consultation I = A number of delegates and others met on the evening of August 15, a meeting which came to be known as \\"Consultation I\\".Warren C. Trenchard, \\"In the Shadow of the Sanctuary\\".

Spectrum 12:2 ( 1981), pp.40‚Äì52  Aftermath and legacy  Following Glacier View, Ford ultimately formed his own ministry Good News Unlimited. It also led to the founding of the \\"dissident bimonthly\\" Evangelica, which was based in Napa, California. The Adventist church formed a committee called the \\"Daniel and Revelation Study Committee\\" (often abbreviated DARCOM) in order to restudy the investigative judgment and the interpretation of these Biblical books. This committee has produced a seven volume series, which is available from the Bookshop of the General Conference's Biblical Research Institute. The main contributing authors are William H. Shea and Frank B. Holbrook. In June 1981 a group of Adventist theologians wrote a protest, \\"The Atlanta Affirmation\\". According to Time in a 1982 article, the church soon obtained the resignation of 120 clergy and teachers who refused to support SDA teachings. This was presumably for their support of Ford's theology. Peter Ballis, professor of sociology at Monash University and an ex-pastor himself, wrote the definitive study on the subject, Leaving the Adventist Ministry, One review (DjVu) of the book is George R. Knight, Andrews University Seminary Studies 38:1 (Spring 2000), 132‚Äì33 which grew out of his doctoral studies. He found that 180 pastors left the Adventist ministry in Australia and New Zealand over the succeeding 8 years and calls it \\"the most rapid and massive exit of Adventist pastors in the movement‚Äôs 150-year history\\" (although he cautions that the fallout may have involved more than one factor).Ballis, as quoted by Arthur Patrick in \\"Twenty-five years after Glacier View\\" He claims the primary reason for exiting was not theology or personal reasons, but treatment by administrators.According to the review by Knight It is further speculated by Ford that a number of current ministers privately agree with Ford but refrain from speaking publicly on the issue for fear of losing their employment. Some in the Adventist church feel that the events of 1980 represent a major milestone in the theological development of the church, and that the effects of this controversy continue to be felt today. The church news magazine Adventist Review received \\"many very angry letters\\" during the 1980s.In His Own Words: An Interview with William Johnsson, Editor of the Adventist Review from Adventist Today Ford opined in 2002 that when Edward Heppenstall received the Glacier View manuscript, \\"he declared, 'The church will never be able to answer this,' and the last 22 years have proved him right.\\" In 2005, the Sydney Adventist Forum held a seminar to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Glacier View meeting. Approximately 250 people attended. Two presentations were given by Desmond Ford, as well as a paper delivered by Arthur Patrick, and a paper by Norm Young was read (although he was not present).

Promoters of these hypotheses are associated with the Toronto School of Communication, such as Marshall McLuhan, Harold Innis, Walter Ong and more recently Robert K. Logan; the term \\"alphabet effect\\" comes from Logan's 1986 work (see the bibliography below which references the 2004 second edition). Overview The theory claims that a greater level of abstraction is required due to the greater economy of symbols in alphabetic systems; and this abstraction and the analytic skills needed to interpret phonemic symbols in turn has contributed to the cognitive development of its users. Proponents of this theory hold that the development of phonetic writing and the alphabet in particular (as distinct from other types of writing systems) has made a significant impact on Western thinking and development precisely because it introduced a new level of abstraction, analysis, coding, decoding and classification. McLuhan and Logan (1977) while not suggesting a direct causal connection nevertheless suggest that, as a result of these skills, the use of the alphabet created an environment conducive to the development of codified law, monotheism, abstract science, deductive logic, objective history, and individualism. According to Logan, \\"All of these innovations, including the alphabet, arose within the very narrow geographic zone between the Tigris-Euphrates river system and the Aegean Sea, and within the very narrow time frame between 2000 B.C. and 500 B.C.\\" (Logan 2004). The emergence of codified law in Sumer as exemplified by the Hammurabic code actually coincided with the reform of the Akkadian syllabic system and is not directly influenced by the alphabet per se but rather by a phonetic writing system consisting of only sixty signs. Also it has to be pointed out that there was a robust scientific tradition in China but that science as practised in ancient China was not abstract but concrete and practical. In fact the impetus for formulating the Alphabet Effect was to explain why abstract science began in the West and not China despite the long list of inventions and technology that first appeared in China as documented by Joseph Needham in his book The Grand Titration (Needham 1969). The Alphabet Effect provides an alternative explanation to what is known as Needham's Grand Question, namely why China had been overshot by the West in science and technology, despite its earlier successes. Another impact of alphabetic writing was that it led to the invention of zero, the place number system, negative numbers, and algebra by Hindu and Buddhist mathematicians in India 2000 years ago (Logan 2004). These ideas were picked up by Arab mathematicians and scientists and eventually made their way to Europe 1400 years later. Prior to the written word there was a monopoly of knowledge by priests. (Innes: 1991, p. 4) This was because literacy was seen to be very time consuming. Therefore, all literacy was left in the hands of priests. With the priests monopolizing the content of religious texts there would be little or no dissention among the public. Thus the introduction of the alphabet substantially limited the power of the priests and religious texts were now open to society for questioning. A social ramification of the introduction of the alphabet was the creation of social distinctions within society. Scholar Andrew Robinson supports this point by stating that those who are illiterate within society are seen as being deficient and ‚Äòbackward‚Äô (Robinson: 1995, p. 215). Consequently, the development of the alphabet allowed for distinctions to be formed within society between the literate upper class and the illiterate lower class. The development of the alphabet and hence the written word has also affected the impact of emotion. This point is also shared by Marshall McLuhan who believes that to translate a beautiful picture into words would be to deprive it of correctly articulating its best qualities (McLuhan: 1964, p. 83). Therefore, the written word has deprived both images and beautiful objects of the correct level of emotion with which to express their exact appearance. The fact that the alphabet introduced the idea that a person‚Äôs writing could live on long after they died was another social ramification of the alphabet. This argument is also shared by Andrew Robinson. Robinson believes that the need for ‚Äòimmortality‚Äô has always been of extreme importance for many authors. (Robinson: 2006, p. 83) As a result, the development of the written word allowed for the ‚Äòimmortality‚Äô of authors and their written works. Criticism of the theory as ethnocentric Grosswiler (2004) notes that many scholars (including former adherents of the theory such as Goody) have pointed out that the theory is based on a particular Hellenocentric account of science, which neglects how different cultures have had hegemony scientifically irrespective of writing system Criticism of the theory's account of Chinese writing Several scholars have pointed out that the logographic account of Chinese writing is obsolete and incorrect. John DeFrancis suggests the use of the term semasiographic rather than logographic, because the idea of Chinese characters as pictorial in nature is only partially true. From Dominic Yu's account: :Take, for example, the character ‰ªñ, representing the third person singular pronoun \\"tƒÅ\\". The left hand component, the \\"person\\" radical, indicates that this character vaguely has something to do with a person or people. I say \\"vaguely\\" because this is a very common radical is also used in characters such as ‰ªΩ, ÂÅá, and ÂÅö, meaning, \\"portion,\\" \\"fake,\\" and \\"to do,\\" respectively. The right side is a phonetic component indicating that (at some earlier stage of Chinese), this character rhymed with ‰πü, now pronounced \\"yƒõ.\\" Nothing in this character indicates the idea of \\"third person singular pronoun.\\" From this example, we can see that Chinese characters mainly represent sounds, and only represent ideas in a rather insignificant way. Thus, Logan's claim that Chinese characters represent the \\"idea of a word\\" is baseless. Criticism of the theory from alternate paths to alphabetic script It has been suggested (by e.g. Grosswiler 2004) that Schmandt-Besserat's research into the origin of writing from three-dimensional tokens gives an alternative to the progressivist account of the Alphabet Effect theory. Grosswiler suggests that it is the potential for recording memory, not any one system of it, that propels a culture towards scientific thought.

It heads away from the River Lea Navigation to pass through Enfield Island Village to follow the River Lea through Gunpowder Park to the A121 to Waltham Abbey. It links with the proposed cycle route NCR 13 at Chelmsford, and the proposed NCR 16 route at Witham. It also connects with NCR 51 heading east at Colchester for access to Harwich International Port and the Regional route 41 coastal route via Felixstowe. =Colchester to Norwich= Colchester  Ipswich  Woodbridge  Framlingham  Halesworth  Beccles  Norwich From Colchester take NCR 51 to Harwich International Port or continue to Ipswich along minor roads. Note that (as of December 2007) the route is being changed, and part is still unsigned. The old route passes to the north of Ipswich, the new route comes into the centre of the town and along the Waterfront. From Ipswich take the NCR 51 west towards Cambridge, or NCR 51 east for Felixstowe and then either to Harwich and the Harwich International Port via a foot ferry or north using RCR 41 via Bawdsey Ferry (summer only) into Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty to connect back up with NCR 1 further north. As NCR1 (the new route) leaves Ipswich it passes along a good off-road cycle route through the Grange Farm area and out to Woodbridge along minor roads. =Norwich to Lincoln= Norwich  Fakenham  King's Lynn  Wisbech  Holbeach  Boston  Lincoln Links with NCR 13 near Fakenham for access south to Thetford and with NCR 11 near King's Lynn for access to Ely and Cambridge =Lincoln to Scarborough= Lincoln  Market Rasen  Humber Bridge  Hull  Beverley  Driffield  Bridlington  Scarborough The route passes through the east of Lincoln before using cycle lanes and cycle paths along the A46. Once out of the city it makes use of country lanes to Market Rasen. After which it rises up on to the Lincolnshire Wolds before descending in to Barton-upon-Humber where it crosses the Humber Bridge to Hessle in Yorkshire. The route here is mainly on country lanes with a one section of bridal path at Hendale Wood. At Hessle the route meets Route 65 on the eastern Leg of the Trans Pennine Trail. Route 1 continues north through west Hull suburbs before reaching the town of Beverley. Using mainly country lanes via Driffield, the route reaches the North Sea coast at Bridlington. Between Bridlington and Scarborough the route climbs over the Yorkshire Wolds. The of Route 1 between the junction of Route 164 in Beverly and the junction with Route 166 in Hunmanby are part of the Yorkshire Wolds Cycle Route. Between Hutton Cranswick and Bridlington Route 1 is the eastern end of the Way of the Roses Challenge Ride. =Scarborough to South Shields= Scarborough  Whitby  Redcar  Middlesbrough  Stockton on Tees  Sunderland  South Shields From Scarborough to Whitby, the route directly follows the course of the former Scarborough and Whitby Railway, now known locally as The Cinder Track. The terrain is mostly off-road and passes over the Larpool Viaduct. At Whitby, the route drops back onto the road and follows the coast road to Redcar and through the south of Middlesbrough. Crossing the Tees Barrage at Stockton on Tees, the route then snakes through the town before joining the former Castle Eden Railway, now The Castle Eden Walkway. This travels directly north to Sunderland, snakes through the city and crosses the River Wear over the Wearmouth Bridge before heading towards the coast, where it then follows the coast road all the way to South Shields and reaching the River Tyne. The final part of this section of the route enters the Pedestrian and Cyclist Tyne Tunnel to cross the river to Newcastle upon Tyne. =South Shields to Edinburgh= South Shields  Tynemouth  Lindisfarne  Berwick upon Tweed  Scottish Border  Dalkeith  Edinburgh =Edinburgh to John o' Groats= Edinburgh  Dundee  Aberdeen  Inverness  Thurso  John o' Groats The route heads northwest out of Edinburgh with NCN 76, which diverges at Cramond Brig through Dalmeny Estate to follow the coast. NCN 1 instead takes a more direct route to South Queensferry, alongside the A90 and through Dalmeny. It then crosses the Forth Road Bridge and heads through Inverkeithing, again linking with NCN 76, and onwards north across the M90. The journey through Dunfermline's eastern suburbs is on traffic-free paths. Near Dunfermline Queen Margaret railway station it links with NCN 764, which travels west towards Clackmannan. Out of Townhill the route uses country lanes and some B-roads, climbing into the Cleish Hills and passing through Blairadam Forest, then back under the M90 on its way to Kinross. NCN 1 now uses the Loch Leven Heritage Trail around the loch, before making its way east around the base of the Lomond Hills. In Falkland it links with NCN 776, which travels north towards Newburgh. =John o' Groats to Shetland= John o' Groats  Orkney  Kirkwall  Stromness  Shetland  Lerwick  Yell, Shetland  Unst Orkney Mainland near Evie Churchill Barrier No 1  Orkney  On the Orkney Islands Route 1 starts in Stromness on Mainland, when arriving via ferry from Scrabster, or Burwick on South Ronaldsay, when arriving by ferry from John o' Groats. Starting in Stromness, the Route follows roads along the coast of northwestern Orkney Mainland, passing several sites of Heart of Neolithic Orkney and other interesting places in following order: * Standing Stones of Stenness * Ness of Brodgar * Ring of Brodgar * Skara Brae * Brough of Birsay The route then leads around the coast of Mainland via Evie, goes back to the Loch of Harray for passing Maes Howe, heading to the south coast passing Loch of Kirbister, before it reaches Orkney's capital Kirkwall.

He is remembered today mainly because he appears as one of the figures in Galileo's controversial work the Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (1632).Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems Galileo Galilei, translated by Stillman Drake Family background and early life Salviati was the son of Averardo di Filippo and Alessandra di Giovambattista Nerli, who died shortly after his birth. His family was wealthy and powerful, related to of the grand dukes of Tuscany by numerous marriages; Cosimo de' Medici, son of Maria Salviati, was the cousin of his grandfather, Senator Filippo Salviati, who in turn was married to the uterine sister of Pope Leo XI. Filippo was taught grammar, Latin, geometry and mathematics by a tutor, but his real loves were horsemanship, appearing in tournaments, fencing, hunting, and swimming, He also loved music and was a proficient player of several instruments. In 1595, on the death of his father, he became a pupil of his uncle Antonio, who began training him in the family's business. On 5 September 1602 he married Ortensia, daughter of Francesco Guadagni and Laura Bandini; their marriage was agreed and sponsored by the Grand Duke and Cardinal Medici. On 28 August 1603 their only daughter Alessandra was born, who died on 31 October 1610. At court, Salviati took part in the celebrations for the wedding of Marie de' Medici Maria Medici with Henry IV of France in 1600. In 1608, he took part in the preparation of the festive games for the wedding of Prince Cosimo with Maria Maddalena of Austria. As part of these, following a mock naval combat entitled The Argonauts the bride was offered precious minerals from an allegorical rock of Arno. In the same year, he was the chaperone of prince Francesco de' Medici (1594‚Äì1614) during the ballet- spectacle of the Giostra de' venti. Intellectual development From the second half of 1606, Salviati began to immerse himself in study: for ten hours a day he kept himself away from other people and neglected his usual activities, buying many books. He first perfected his knowledge of Greek and Latin through the reading of the classics, initially under the guidance of Giulio Libri, member of the Accademia della Crusca with the nickname 'Abburattato' ('Sifted'), However he soon abandoned these Peripatetic teachings and embraced the views of Copernicus and the new natural philosophy. After a long period of disputes with his uncle he finally decided, in 1610, to withdraw from involvement in the family business in order to devote his time to natural philosophy. On 7 July 1610 Salviati himself became a member of the Accademia della Crusca (founded by his ancestor Lionardo Salviati) with the nickname of 'Affidato' ('Trusted') His ceremonial membership spade bears the image of a Roman spearhead from which hangs a bundle of wheat with the motto \\"sotto 'l qual si trionfa\\" taken from a line in Petrarch's Canzone XLIX ('O solid shield for the oppressed peoples / against the blows of Death and Fortune / under whom we triumph'). He contributed to the successful completion of the Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca, as the major financier of the first printing in 1612. Collaboration with Galileo By 1610 Salviati's close relationship with Galileo Galilei was also firmly established. In July 1611, Salviati's Florence residence in via del Palagio was chosen as the location for an experimental competition between Galileo and the Aristotelian Lodovico delle Colombe about the physics of floating bodies. From January 1611, he hosted Galileo for long periods in his villa Le Selve in Lastra a Signa, where Galileo continued his observations on the 'Medicean planets' and developed his theories on sunspots. This led to the writing of the three famous letters to Marcus Welser (Letters on Sunspots, 1613). As their relationship developed, Galileo sponsored and supported Salviati's membership of the Accademia dei Lincei in September 1612. In 1617 Federico Cesi, founder of the Lincei, married Salviati's cousin Isabella. Feud with the Medici At the same time as Salviati was assisting Galileo, he became involved in an unusual dispute with some of the Medici family. On 26 April the carriage of Don Bernardetto de' Medici was taking part in a procession ordered by rank on the Via Romana when it was overtaken by an anonymous carriage. This later turned out to be Salviati's, although he was not present and it was occupied by friends of his. The Medici responded by sending their servants to chase the carriage down and insult the occupants on the public street with threats of a beating. The offense worsened the next day when the same group, again without Salviati, threatened the staff of Bernardetto's brother the abbott Ottaviano de' Medici. Don Ottaviano was gravely offended, and this was the origin of long-standing rancour against Salviati. Despite the intervention of many influential intermediaries the matter could not be satisfactorily resolved. In November 1611 the Grand Duke himself tried to reconcile the parties, but as he made his way to the agreed meeting, Salviati was attacked and wounded by Don Ottaviano's men. On 2 January 1612 the Grand Duke finally managed to arrange peace by imposing perpetual silence concerning the matter on both parties. Salviati immediately left for Le Selve with Galileo. Berdardetto and Ottaviano de' Medici, dissatisfied with the agreed truce, ordered Salviati's murder, sending assassins from the kingdom of Naples. Their plan was discovered and Salviati had grilles placed over the windows of Le Selve. In 1613 a complaint against Salviati was received by the Holy Office. Perhaps warned, on 23 October 1613 Salviati left Florence suddenly, never to return. He travelled across northern Italy, meeting scholars and influential people, telling them about Galileo's discoveries. In November he was in the Republic of Venice, where he met Cesare Cremonini, and in December, Genoa, where he met Giovanni Battista Baliani. Death and legacy Embarking in January for Spain, Salviati 1614 died of an asthma attack in Barcelona on 22 March 1614. He was buried temporarily in the convent of St. Francis until 15 May, when his body was returned to Florence and buried in the family chapel in S. Marco. Niccol√≤ Arrighetti delivered his funeral oration; in Rome Federico Cesi paid him solemn tributes and commissioned his biography from :it:Josse De Rycke, who composed only a poem and a cenotaph. A statue of him stands in Padua. Many years after his friend's death Galileo recreated him as a character in his controversial Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (1632) and in the later Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences (1638). In these works The character of Salviati is an expert Copernican mathematician, whom Galileo uses to argue controversial or potentially heretical views, and ultimately win the argument.

She produced several English translations of poetry and literary works, including the first English translation of H√©l√®ne Cixous's The Exile of James Joyce or the Art of Replacement,Toril Moi Sexual/Textual Politics, Routledge 2002, p101 and published at least six volumes of her own poetry. Biography Born in Aston Fields, Worcestershire in 1944, Purcell attended Bromsgrove High School and became the first pupil of the school to win an open scholarship to Oxford University, where she studied Mediaeval and Modern French at Lady Margaret Hall. After graduation she remained in Oxford, working as a typist, barmaid, researcher and writer until her death, at age 53, from a rare lymphoma of the brain.\\"She feared not the night for she carried the sun\\" - obituary in The Times, by Libby Purves, November 19, 2002 Her contemporaries remarked on Purcell's old-fashioned style of diction, which never used contractions. She told a reviewer for Isis magazine \\"I know that my English is 200 years out of date, but I think that I speak it more pleasantly than most.\\" In 1971 Purcell co-edited (with Libby Purves, then an undergraduate student) The Happy Unicorns,The Happy Unicorns reference at the Library of Congress a volume of work by poets under 25 years old. She published a number of translations and several selected editions of poetry, including Monarchs and the Muse (Carcanet, 1972), editions of George Peele and Charles d'Orl√©ans (also for Carcanet), and a selection of Proven√ßal Poems. With William Leaf she published Heraldic Symbols (1986) for the Victoria and Albert Museum. Her own poetry was regarded by some of her contemporaries at least as of outstanding importance, precisely because it stood apart from the realism of the late twentieth century. There was a strange blend of influences from folklore, the Classics and modern French. There is a surreal Arthurian streak to much of Purcell's work, which may owe something of its beginning to another Oxford poet with a scholarly background, Charles Williams, though she always retains a strong individuality. The style was notably more lyrical and sonorous than many of her contemporaries, though it used an increasingly spare free verse, which was well described in a review of her last volume Fossil Unicorn (by Douglas Clark in Lynx): \\"Sally Purcell writes brilliant snowflakes of poems. Her sharp crystal language is perfect for the short gasp of her work.\\" Her books appeared from the early seventies till her death in 1998, in several cases from Peter Jay's Anvil Press. Her main volumes are The Holly Queen (1971), Dark of Day (1977), Lake and Labyrinth (Taxvs, 1985) and \\"Fossil Unicorn\\" (1997).

Together with 115 other African captives, he was brought to the United States on board the ship Clotilda in 1860. The captives were landed in backwaters of the Mobile River near Mobile, Alabama, and hidden from authorities. The ship was scuttled to evade discovery, and was not found again until 2019. After the Civil War and emancipation, Lewis and other members of the Clotilda group became free. A number of them founded a community at Magazine Point, north of Mobile, Alabama. They were joined there by others born in Africa. Now designated as the Africatown Historic District, the community was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. In old age Kossola preserved the experiences of the Clotilda captives by providing accounts of the history of the group to visitors, including Mobile artist and author Emma Langdon Roche and author and folklorist Zora Neale Hurston. He lived to 1935 and was long thought to be the last survivor of the Clotilda, until a pair of studies by historian Hannah Durkin identified two longer-lived Clotilda survivors: Redoshi, who died in 1937, and Matilda McCrear, who died in 1940. Early life and enslavement A map drawn by Lewis to illustrate his capture He was born as Kossola or Oluale Kossola (Americans would later transcribe his given name as \\"Kazoola\\"), around 1841 in West Africa. Analyzing names and the other words attributed to the Africatown founders, historian Sylviane Diouf has concluded that he and many other members of the community belonged to what is now known as the Yoruba people, and lived in the Bant√© region of what is now Benin. His father was named Oluwale (or Oluale) and his mother Fondlolu; he had five full siblings and twelve half-siblings, the children of his father's other two wives. Interviewers Emma Langdon Roche and Zora Neale Hurston, and those who used their work, referred to Lewis and his fellow-captives as \\"Tarkars,\\" based on his account. Diouf believes that the term \\"Tarkar\\" might have come from a misunderstanding of the name of a local king, or the name of a town. During April or May 1860, Lewis was taken prisoner by Dahomey Amazons of the Kingdom of Dahomey as part of its annual dry-season raids for slaves. Along with other captives, he was taken to the slaving port of Ouidah and sold to Captain William Foster of the Clotilda, an American ship based in Mobile, Alabama, and owned by businessman Timothy Meaher. Importation of enslaved persons into the United States had been illegal since 1808, but slaves were still being smuggled in from Cuba. Some reports suggest that Meaher intended to break the law, and that he had reportedly bet a businessman $100,000 that he could evade the prohibition on transporting slaves. In a similar situation, the owners of the Wanderer, which had illegally brought enslaved people to Georgia in 1858, were indicted and tried for piracy in the federal court in Savannah in May 1860 but acquitted in a jury trial. By the time the Clotilda reached the Mississippi coast in July 1860, government officials had been alerted to its activities, and Timothy Meaher, his brother Burns, and their associate John Dabney were charged with illegal possession of the captives. However, there was a gap of almost five months between the end of July 1860, when summonses and writs of seizure were issued against the Meahers and Dabney, and mid- December when they received them. During the intervening period the captives were dispersed and hidden, and without their physical presence as evidence, the case was dismissed in January 1861. Until the end of the Civil War (1861‚Äì65), Lewis and his fellows lived as de facto slaves of Meaher, his brothers, or their associates. Lewis was purchased by James Meaher, for whom he worked as a deckhand on a steamer. During this time he became known as \\"Cudjo Lewis.\\" He later explained that he suggested \\"Cudjo,\\" a day-name commonly given to boys born on a Monday, as an alternative to his given name when James Meaher had difficulty pronouncing \\"Kossola.\\" The name ‚ÄúCudjo‚Äù sounds similar to ‚ÄúKodjoe‚Äù, a popular name in Ghana, West Africa, also given to those born on Monday. Historian Diouf posits that the surname \\"Lewis\\" was a corruption of his father's name Oluale, sharing the \\"lu\\" sound; in his homeland, the closest analog to what Americans understood as a surname would have been a patronymic.  Life in Africatown  = Establishment of Africatown = Lewis and fellow Clotilda survivor Abach√© (Clara Turner) c. 1914. By then there were eight surviving members of the Clotilda group. During their time in slavery, Lewis and many of the other Clotilda captives were located at an area north of Mobile known as Magazine Point, the Plateau, or \\"Meaher's hammock,\\" where the Meahers owned a mill and a shipyard. Although only three miles from the town of Mobile, it was isolated, separated from the city by a swamp and a forest, and easily accessible only by water. After the abolition of slavery and the end of the Civil War, the Clotilda captives tried to raise money to return to their homeland. The men worked in lumber mills and the women raised and sold produce, but they could not acquire sufficient funds. After realizing that they would not be able to return to Africa, the group deputized Lewis to ask Timothy Meaher for a grant of land. When he refused, the members of the community continued to raise money and began to purchase land around Magazine Point. On September 30, 1872, Lewis bought about two acres of land in the Plateau area for $100.00. They developed Africatown as a self-contained, independent black community. The group appointed leaders to enforce communal norms derived from their shared African background. They also developed institutions including a church, a school, and a cemetery. Diouf explains that Africatown was unique because it was both a \\"black town,\\" inhabited exclusively by people of African ancestry, and an enclave of people born in another country. She writes, \\"Black towns were safe havens from racism, but African Town was a refuge from Americans.\\" Writing in 1914, Emma Langdon Roche noted that the surviving founders of Africatown preferred to speak in their own language among themselves. She described the English of adults as \\"very broken and not always intelligible even to those who have lived among them for many years.\\" However, the residents also adopted some American customs, including Christianity. Lewis converted in 1869, joining a Baptist church. = Marriage and family life = During the mid-1860s Lewis established a common-law relationship with another Clotilda survivor, Abile (Americanized as \\"Celia\\"). They formally married on March 15, 1880, along with several other couples from Africatown. They remained together until Abile's death in 1905. They had six children, five sons and a daughter, to each of whom they gave both an African name and an American name. Their eldest son, Aleck (or Elick) Iyadjemi (which translated from Yor√πb√° means \\"I suffered\\"), became a grocer; he took his wife to live in a house on his father's land. Diouf describes this arrangement as a Yor√πb√° -style \\"family compound.\\" Another son, Cudjoe Fe√Øchtan, was fatally shot by a black sheriff's deputy in 1902. Lewis outlived his wife and all of his children. He allowed his daughter-in- law Mary Wood Lewis, his grandchildren and eventually her second husband Joe Lewis (no relation) to remain in their house in the compound. Lewis worked as a farmer and laborer until 1902, when his buggy was damaged and he was injured in a collision with a train in Mobile. As he was unable to work at heavy labor, the community appointed him as sexton of the church. In 1903 it took the name of the Union Missionary Baptist Church. = Participation in American institutions = Although native-born American former slaves became citizens upon the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in July 1868, this change in status did not apply to the members of the Clotilda group, who were foreign-born. Cudjo Kazoola Lewis became a naturalized American citizen on October 24, 1868. Lewis used the American legal system in 1902 after being injured in the buggy-train collision. When the Louisville and Nashville Railroad refused to pay damages, he hired an attorney, sued the railroad, and won a significant settlement of $650.00. The award was overturned on appeal.  Role as storyteller and historian  In the first quarter of the 20th century, Lewis began to serve as an informant for scholars and other writers, sharing the history of the Clotilda Africans, and traditional stories and tales. Emma Langdon Roche, a Mobile-based writer and artist, interviewed Lewis and the other survivors for her 1914 book Historic Sketches of the South. She described their capture in Africa, enslavement, and lives in Africatown. They requested that she use their African names in her work, in the hope that it might reach their homeland \\"where some might remember them.\\" By 1925, Lewis was thought to be the last African survivor of the Clotilda; he was interviewed by educator and folklorist Arthur Huff Fauset of Philadelphia. In 1927 Fauset published two of Lewis' animal tales, \\"T'appin's magic dipper and whip\\" and \\"T'appin fooled by Billy Goat's eyes,\\" and \\"Lion Hunt,\\" his autobiographical account about hunting in Africa, in the Journal of American Folklore. Lewis' commemorative marker in Plateau Cemetery, Africatown In 1927 Lewis was interviewed by Zora Neale Hurston, then a graduate student in anthropology who became a folklorist. The next year she published an article, \\"Cudjoe's Own Story of the Last African Slaver\\" (1928). According to her biographer Robert E. Hemenway, this piece largely plagiarized Emma Roche's work, although Hurston added information about daily life in Lewis' home village of Bant√©. In 1928 Hurston returned with additional resources; she conducted more interviews with Kossula, took photographs, and recorded what was thought to be the only known film footage of an African who had been trafficked to the United States through the slave trade. Based on this material, she wrote a manuscript, Barracoon, which Hemenway described as \\"a highly dramatic, semifictionalized narrative intended for the popular reader.\\"Hemenway, Zora Neale Hurston, pp. 100‚Äì101. After this round of interviews, Hurston's literary patron, philanthropist Charlotte Osgood Mason, learned of Lewis and began to send him money for his support. Lewis was also interviewed by journalists for local and national publications. Hurston's book Barracoon: The Story of the Last \\"Black Cargo\\" was not published until 2018, in an annotated edition.  Legacy  Cudjo Lewis died on July 17, 1935, and was buried at the Plateau Cemetery in Africatown. Since his death, his status as one of the last survivors of the Clotilda, and the written record created by his interviewers, have made him a public figure of the history of the community. *In 1959 a memorial bust of Lewis was erected in front of Africatown's Union Missionary Baptist Church atop a pyramid of bricks that had been made by the Clotilda captives. It was made on behalf of the Progressive League of Africatown. *In 1977 the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (now the Association for the Study of African American Life and History) commemorated Lewis and the Clotilda group. *Around 1990 the City of Mobile and Mobile alumnae chapter of Delta Sigma Theta sorority erected a commemorative marker for Lewis in the Plateau Cemetery. *In 2007 two African filmmakers donated a bust of Lewis to the Africatown Welcome Center. It was severely damaged by vandalism in 2011. *In 2010, archaeologists from the College of William and Mary excavated Lewis' homesite in Africatown, along with those of two other residents, to search for artifacts and evidence of African practices in the founders' daily lives in the United States. *Barracoon: The Story of the Last \\"Black Cargo\\", Zora Neale Hurston's account of Lewis' life, was published for the first time in 2018.

Crossing into Wales, the high quality track crosses the Dee at the side of Hawarden Bridge and then enters the town of Shotton. At this stage the National Cycle Route heads inland and follows a series of quiet roads. Unfortunately the road surfaces are sometimes poor and gradients steep. There are plans to create a better quality route following the coast. At Talacre the coastal route improves again. It passes through a large caravan site and golf course en route to Prestatyn. From Prestatyn westwards the route hugs the coast and in many places one is just a few metres from the sea. The path continues through Rhyl where it crosses the River Clwyd and then to Kinmel Bay, Pensarn, Llanddulas, Colwyn Bay and Llandudno. The Llandudno promenade, although not on the official route, is a much better route than the official line which was created before the promenade was opened to cyclists after a long campaign. The path was much improved West of Conwy in September 2012 by the creation of a traffic free cycle path which now bypasses a particularly dangerous stretch of the A55. Heading further west, the path is highly engineered around the Penmaenmawr area before following quiet lanes into Bangor. It crosses (with road traffic) the Menai Suspension Bridge and terminates in Holyhead. Much of the road across Anglesey follows country lanes rather than dedicated bike tracks.

The towpath alongside the canal between Paddington and Northolt is already designated as a local cycle path, and will eventually form part of Route 6 when the route is completed. The canal continues to Uxbridge where the National Cycle Route 6 joins National Cycle Route 61 at Cowley, near Brunel University, sharing the same path until the two routes diverge at St Albans. The route continues along the Grand Union Canal and the Colne Valley on mainly traffic-free routes. At Rickmansworth it joins the Ebury Way, a rail trail which runs along a former line of the Watford and Rickmansworth Railway. Entering central Watford, the route continues north via St Albans with some on-road sections to Harpenden, where it intersects with National Cycle Route 57 and the Chiltern Cycleway. It then progresses along the River Lea via Luton, along the Sewell Greenway before joining the road network to reach Leighton Buzzard. At this point it re-joins the Grand Union Canal (Grand Junction Branch) to Milton Keynes. Milton Keynes The Milton Keynes cycleway network. NCR routes 6 and 51 are highlighted in red. (Openstreetmap.org) Route 6 enters Milton Keynes from the south following the Grand Union Canal through southern Bletchley. After a loop through central Bletchley close to Bletchley railway station and Bletchley Park, it resumes its track northwards via Fenny Stratford along the valley of the River Ouzel (near The Open University and the Milton Keynes University Hospital) to Campbell Park (where it intersects National Cycle Route 51 heading west to Central Milton Keynes and Milton Keynes Central railway station). At Great Linford, NCR6 heads west along the former Wolverton to Newport Pagnell Line (now a rail trail). At Old Wolverton (near Wolverton railway station), the route crosses the River Great Ouse to leave the Milton Keynes Urban Area for the rural villages of Castlethorpe and Hanslope before crossing into Northamptonshire. =Milton Keynes to Derby= Route 6 between Milton Keynes and Derby is the core section of the Sustrans route of the South Midlands. After passing through Northampton the route follows the Brampton Valley Way for to Market Harborough, first opened in 1993 it is one of the longest railway paths in the country and uses two long tunnels. From Market Harborough the route uses the towpath of the Grand Union Canal to reach Foxton Locks from where it is on street to south Leicester. Using the River Soar towpath the route passes south to north through the city. On reaching Watermead Country Park the route returns to the streets to pass through Loughborough and on to Worthington. From here the to Derby follow the Cloud Trail and Derby Canal Path. =Derby to Castleton= From Derby the route heads east through Long Eaton and then turns north in the western suburbs of Nottingham. Passing Beeston, Bulwell, Hucknall and Newstead railway stations before heading northeast through the grounds of Newstead Abbey. From Blidworth the route is northbound and predominantly traffic free as far as Worksop as it passes through Sherwood Pines Forest Park, Sherwood Forest Country Park and Clumber Park. Using the canal towpath between Worksop and Shirebrook the route heads east on country roads to the Rother Valley Country Park. Here it turns north to Rotherham, from where it becomes traffic free joining a towpath for a southwesterly route to Sheffield. Climbing through the streets of Sheffield the route enters the Peak District National Park at Ringinglow and uses the dam wall of Ladybower reservoir to reach Castleton. =Castleton to Reddish= Castleton  Reddish The route between Caslteton and Reddish has yet to be decided. =Reddish to Bury= From Reddish, National Route 6 enters Manchester via the Fallowfield Loop.

She was the founding principal of the Khalil Gibran International Academy, a New York Arab-themed public school, named after the Christian Arab poet Khalil Gibran. Biography Almontaser founded and is a former principal of the Khalil Gibran International Academy. A veteran of New York City's public school system, she taught special education, trained teachers in literacy, and served as a multicultural specialist and diversity advisor. She co-designed a curriculum for the Muslim Communities Project at Columbia University and for Educators for Social Responsibility/Metro. In addition, she has contributed a chapter in The Day Our World Changed: Children's Art of 9/11 for New York University's Child Study Center and the Museum of the City of New York and in Forever After: New York City Teachers on 9/11 for Teachers College Press as well as articles and essays in several magazines. As of September 2016, Almontaster is the president of the Muslim Community Network. Controversy Almontaser was forced by the Department of Education and the Mayor of the City of New York to resign after a controversy arose over a T-shirt created by Arab Women Active in the Arts and Media, an organization that ran its youth program from office space at Saba: The Association of Yemeni Americans, of which Almontaser is a board member.The t-shirt and its organization had no ties to the school or Almontaser as the school's principal.\\"Principal at New NYC Arabic-Language School Forced to Resign\\", August 13, 2007, Interview with Mona Eldahry, co-founder of AWAAM (Arab Women Active in the Arts and Media), on the meaning of the \\"Intifada NYC\\" t-shirt. The T-shirt had the words, \\"Intifada NYC\\" on it, which, according to the New York Post, was \\"apparently a call for a Gaza-style uprising in the Big Apple\\". In an interview with the same newspaper, she was asked the Arabic root word of the word \\"intifada\\". She explained that the word \\"comes from the root word that means 'shaking off'. That is the root word if you look it up in Arabic.\\" To a follow-up comment that the girls at AWAAM are planning a Gaza-style uprising, she added that she understood that \\"it is developing a negative connotation due to the uprising in the Palestinian-Israeli areas\\" and that she does not believe the intention is to have any of that kind of [violence] in New York City.\\" The Post quoted her as saying, \\"I think it's pretty much an opportunity for girls to express that they are part of New York City society... and shaking off oppression.\\" The \\"it's\\" in her statement referred to the training the girls received at this youth program. She denied using the phrase \\"shaking off oppression\\" and a federal appeals court ruled that the Post had quoted her \\"incorrectly and misleadingly.\\" Shortly thereafter, the NYC Board of Education issued the following statement on Almontaser's behalf, purportedly without her authorization: \\"By minimizing the word's historical associations I implied that I condone violence and threats of violence.... That view is anathema to me and the very opposite of my life's work.\\" On August 9, 2007, Randi Weingarten, then Head of the United Federation of Teachers (the NYC teachers' union), as well as Chancellor Klein and Mayor Bloomberg, demanded Almontaser's resignation by 8:00 the next morning threatening to nix the school if she did not resign. The full account was highlighted in a frontpage New York Times article, \\"Critics Cost Muslim Educator Her Dream Job\\". In a The New York Times article, journalism professor Samuel G. Freedman wrote, \\"For anyone who bothered to look for it, Almontaser left a clear, public record of interfaith activism and outreach across the boundaries of race, ethnicity and religion. Her efforts, especially after the September 11 attacks, earned her honors, grants and fellowships. She has collaborated so often with Jewish organizations that an Arab-American newspaper, Aramica, castigated her earlier this summer for being too close to a 'Zionist organization,' meaning the Anti- Defamation League. Almontaser has twice been profiled on Voice of America as an accomplished Muslim American.\\" In 2004 Almontaser received the Revson Fellowship award for her contributions to City life. Almontaser told her story in her own words on National Public Radio (Brian Lehrer Show) and Democracy Now! Brooklyn Borough President, Marty Markowitz expressed support for Almontaser, calling for her to be reinstated, noting Almontaser \\"was dumped on, and she doesn't deserve it\\" and that he has \\"witnessed her work, bringing Muslims and Jews and other religions together.\\" Then New York City Councilman John Liu noted that the Department of Education \\"and this administration acted totally irresponsibly and violated the trust placed in them in what they allowed to happen to Debbie Almontaser.\\" Along with local politicians, there was an outpouring of community support for Almontaser, with hundreds of individuals and organizations signing statements in support of Almontaser and the Khalil Gibran International Academy (KGIA). A diverse community group called Communities in Support of the Khalil Gibran International Academy (CISKGIA) formed in order to show support for the school as well as Almontaser's rights. The group maintains that KGIA requires more and better support from the Department of Education and New Visions in order to succeed, and it was a strong voice for Debbie Almontaser's reinstatement throughout the controversy. CISKGIA organized an event celebrating the original vision of the school on January 29, 2008 in which a few hundred people attended to support Almontaser and the school that she envision with her design team that were honored that evening, and maintains an informational website.kgia.wordpress.com In 2011, the group noted with disappointment the downsizing of the school as a sign of the lack of political support about which it had warned. A film called Shouting Fire: Stories from the Edge of Free Speech from HBO Films uses Almontaser's case as an example of a violation of the First Amendment rights. Subsequent legal action On November 19, 2007, Almontaser brought a lawsuit claiming that in forcing her to resign because of her interview with the New York Post and denying her the opportunity to be considered for the position of permanent principal at the Khalil Gibran International Academy, the Department of Education violated her First Amendment rights.Almontaser v.

Despite the findings of the EEOC, Almontaser announced that she would not sue the Department of Education, citing the personal costs of pursuing a lawsuit over a number of years. Personal life and community activism According to the Jewish Week, Almontaser invited hundreds of Jews and Christians to her own home after the 9/11 attack. She had joined organizations to form social action groups, such as We Are All Brooklyn, an interethnic initiative supported by the Jewish Community Relations Council, to combat hate crimes in Brooklyn. She trained with the Anti-Defamation League's anti-bias program, \\"A World of Difference\\", as a facilitator for diversity training and inter-group dynamics in the public schools. Almontaser has conducted sensitivity training and presentations in Churches, Synagogues and other houses of worship. She also has worked as a liaison between the Muslim community and the NYPD.

At Scarva station there is a second link with another branch of National Cycle Route 91. From Newry it passes through Camlough to the base of Slieve Gullion. The Belfast to Lisburn section is a slow and winding route along a path that is not suitable for road bikes as the surface is of varying quality made of tarmac or gravel. It does make an ideal cycle for young and old, and since bicycles can be taken on trains running on the adjacent railway line, you can choose the length of your route easily. The easiest route if taking your bicycle by train is going to Newry railway station then cycling to Portadown railway station, therefore avoiding going up a steep hill from Newry city centre to Newry railway station. =Newry to Dublin= Newry  Dublin Proposed route only.

Michael Rose Michael Rose, played by Russell Floyd, first appears in Walford as a Market Inspector in 1996. He initially has very few storylines, but he is chosen to be the best man at Terry Raymond (Gavin Richards)'s wedding (which is later called off). He has a crush on April Branning (Debbie Arnold) but no relationship ever develops between them. Then there is the arrival of his teenage son Matthew (Joe Absolom) and former wife Susan Rose (Tilly Vosburgh) in 1997. His ex-wife Susan is suffering from multiple sclerosis and Michael ends up caring for her. Eventually he and Susan get back together and seem happy until the arrival of Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin) who is also a Market Inspector. He and Lisa become attracted to each other and have an affair behind Susan's back. Michael ends the affair and decides to leave Walford with Susan and start a new life in Leeds, with Susan unaware of the affair. He returns occasionally in 1999 when his son Matthew is wrongly imprisoned for the murder of Saskia Duncan (Deborah Sheridan-Taylor). Michael's last appearance is in December 1999, visiting Matthew in prison. Dan Zappieri Dan Zappieri, played by Carl Pizzie, made his first screen appearance on 19 March 1996. Pizzie was out of work and had just opened a bar with fellow actor Nick Pickard when he was cast as Dan. EastEnders was his first major television role. Pizzie relished the chance to play a bad guy role, as he had only ever played \\"regular guys\\" before. Dan was a drug dealer, who befriended Tony Hills (Mark Homer). They sold drugs together and Pizzie commented that Tony was easily drawn into Dan's world as he thought it was exciting and he liked having money. When two of Dan's customers suffered serious side effects from his drugs, he was unconcerned and Pizzie noted that all Dan cared about was money. He said \\"He likes playing the bad guy, he thinks his life is a bit like an Al Pacino movie.\\" Pizzie found parts of Dan's storylines challenging to play, as he did not touch drugs. But he liked that the show was tackling the subject matter and the negative effects taking drugs had on people. An Inside Soap columnist branded the character \\"Desperate Dan\\" and \\"Walford's latest villain\\". Aunt Sal Aunt Sal is played by Anna Karen, and has appeared sporadically since 21 March 1996, usually for only one or two episodes at a time. She is Peggy Mitchell's (Barbara Windsor) sister. Ben Mitchell Ben Mitchell has been played by five different actors. Matthew Silver appeared as an infant Ben from 1996 to 1998, and Morgan Whittle played him as a toddler from 1999 to 2000. After a six-year absence from the series, Charlie Jones assumed the role of Ben in 2006. Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood axed Jones as part of a series revamp in 2010; the role was recast to Joshua Pascoe later that year. Pascoe portrayed Ben until 24 August 2012, when he was sent to prison for the murder of Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison). Ben returned to the serial in September 2014, with the role recast to Harry Reid, before departing on 12 January 2018. Havingously appeared as a baby and a toddler, Ben returned to EastEnders in 2006 played by child actor Charlie Jones. Jones was cast alongside Megan Jossa, who would play his cousin Courtney Mitchell. While Ben is partially deaf, Jones is a hearing actor. The Guardian Rebecca Atkinson suggested that, as only the second disabled character in EastEnders history, Ben was introduced to fulfil a BBC quota. She criticised Jones' casting, and opined, \\"The use of able-bodied actors to play disabled characters is endemic. Maybe in theory there's nothing wrong with that, but while real disabled people are invisible it is downright offensive to persistently cast able-bodied people in disabled roles.\\" Joe Wicks Joe Wicks, played by Paul Nicholls, appears on screen between 25 March 1996 and 14 November 1997. EastEnders was praised for the character's portrayal of schizophrenia. EastEnders story editor, Ian Aldwinkle, decided to introduce a character with schizophrenia after working on the drama series Casualty, which featured violent and dramatic incidents involving people with the illness, but only focussed on the medical side. Aldwinkle researched the illness and says he was shocked to discover that it affects one in 100 people, but it was rarely spoken about. He said: \\"Because it has a continuing storyline, EastEnders was able to look at the effect that schizophrenia has on a family and on individual relationships. I wanted to humanise it and look at the emotional impact it has on people.\\" He said he hoped that the storyline would be helpful, saying \\"It seems to me that mental illness is one of the last subjects that you can still make jokes about without being labelled politically incorrect, and that seems wrong. If I get just one letter from one person saying that the character of Joe Wicks has helped to change their life for the better, then I will be pleased.\\" Lorraine Wicks Lorraine Wicks, played by Jacqueline Leonard, is introduced in April 1996, as the former wife of the already established character David Wicks (Michael French). She is brought into the serial along with her son Joe Wicks (Paul Nicholls). Author Kate Lock has described Lorraine as \\"relentlessly sensible, fair and nice\\" but with a \\"rogue gene\\" that prompted her to select the wrong kind of men. As well as a high-profile storyline concentrating on Joe's diagnosis of schizophrenia, Lorraine's most prominent storyline is a love triangle between herself, Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) and Grant's wife Tiffany (Martine McCutcheon). In the storyline, Lorraine discovers that Tiffany is keeping a secret from Grant ‚Äì that he is potentially not the father of her unborn child. When Tiffany refuses to tell Grant the truth, Lorraine does, making way for them to become a legitimate couple, albeit briefly. Leonard commented in December 1996, \\"Lorraine has had a year on her own and she feels that she probably needs a bit of contact ‚Äì and Grant's quite macho. It was very interesting from my point of view because Lorraine could be perceived as being bitchy and she's not. She genuinely cares about Tiffany and their marriage and the baby and she wants the whole situation sorted out. But she and Grant do like each other and care about each other and it loses control a bit.\\" Alistair Matthews Alistair Matthews, played by Neil Clark, is a store manager who catches Sarah Hills (Daniela Denby-Ashe) shoplifting in April 1996, but promises not to call the police if she attends his Christian fellowship and turns her back on her sinful ways. Sarah is captivated by Alistair's Christian preachings and joins his fellowship. Frankie Pierre (Syan Blake) is drawn to Alistair too, and when he turns her advances down, she spreads rumours that they were sexually involved; although Alistair publicly denies this, causing Frankie's downfall in Walford. Alistair condemns Sarah for having pre-marital sex with Robbie Jackson (Dean Gaffney) during a crisis of faith. However, Sarah is hurt to discover that Alistair does not practice the piety that he preaches, and when she realises that he is having pre-marital sex with his girlfriend Sue Taylor (Charlotte Bellamy), she denounces him publicly in front of his congregation. Jim Branning Jim Branning is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by John Bardon. First appearing on 29 April 1996 and becoming a regular character in 1999, he remains in the series right until 2011. Jim was written out of the show in August 2007 due to Bardon suffering a stroke. A storyline was created where Jim also suffers a stroke. Bardon returned to film four episodes in the latter half of 2008. He returned permanently from the episode broadcast on 20 August 2009. On 1 April 2011 it was reported by the Daily Mirror that Bardon had filmed his final scenes and had left. He departed on 26 May 2011. On the behest of producer John Yorke in 2000, Jim was paired romantically with pensioner Dot Cotton, played by June Brown; a slow courtship is featured, with Dot often shown to be outraged by Jim's advances, resulting in numerous rejections. Dot finally succumbs and accepts his marriage proposal in an episode that first aired in November 2001; the scenes were filmed inside one of the carriages of the London Eye on the South Bank of the River Thames. Their wedding first aired on 14 February 2002, Valentine's Day. The Guardian critic, Nancy Banks-Smith, described the wedding as \\"uniquely uneventful [...] For Dot and Jim 'In sickness and health... till death do us part' seemed to carry more resonance than for most.\\" Suzy Branning Suzy Branning (originally known as Sue) is the daughter of Jim and Reenie Branning (John Bardon and Joy Graham). She is first seen in 1996 for her sister April Branning (Debbie Arnold)'s wedding to her fianc√© Nikos, along with her children, Rebecca and Kevin. Initially played by Julie Christian- Young in 1996, Maggie O'Neill took over the role in 2008. O'Neill began filming in May 2008, and she made her first on-screen appearance as Suzy on 8 July 2008.\\"'Shameless' actress joins 'EastEnders'\\", Digital Spy. Retrieved 23 April 2008. She made her last appearance on Boxing Day 2008. Derek Branning Derek Branning, played by Terence Beesley in 1996 and Jamie Foreman from 2011 to 2012, is the eldest child of Jim Branning (John Bardon) and Reenie Branning (Joy Graham). Derek made his first appearance on 29 April 1996 and departed not long after. The character returned as a regular character on 24 November 2011, played by Foreman. Derek is originally portrayed as a racist and is against his sister Carol (Lindsey Coulson) marrying Alan (Howard Antony). Derek is described as a \\"charmer\\" and \\"proper East-End\\". In an interview with Daybreak, Foreman said he wants viewers to \\"like Derek\\". Discussing Derek's personality, Foreman told TV Choice: \\"There's always this little undercurrent of, 'This guy isn't who we want around for long', if you see what I mean. Derek's just come back from a 10-year prison sentence for armed robbery. He's a very complicated character, who could either be perceived as a bully or as someone who cares for his family very much.\\" The character was killed off on Christmas Day 2012, after suffering a heart attack. Reenie Branning Reenie Branning played by Joy Graham, is the first wife of Jim Branning (John Bardon), and mother of Derek Branning (Terence Beesley/Jamie Foreman), April Branning (Debbie Arnold), Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson), Suzy Branning (Julie Christian-Young/Maggie O'Neill), Max Branning (Jake Wood) and Jack Branning (Scott Maslen). Reenie is said to be very maternal and dotes on all of her children, despite their faults. She is particularly close to her oldest daughter April, whilst her relationships with daughters Carol and Suzy are notably strained due to their choice of lifestyle. Reenie appears on-screen in April 1996, in the lead-up to April's wedding to her fianc√© Nikos. She does not appear alongside her children Max or Jack, as they were written into the series much later. Off-screen, in October 1999 it is revealed that Reenie is critically ill, and her daughter Carol leaves Walford to care for her. A few weeks later Reenie dies. Huw Edwards Huw Edwards, played by Richard Elis, is introduced in 1996 and remains on- screen till 1999. Welsh actor Richard Elis was cast in the minor role of Huw for a period of three episodes in 1996; however, producers enjoyed the character and his contract was extended. It was reported in December 1998 that executive producer Matthew Robinson had axed Huw because the character was \\"going nowhere\\". However, Elis claimed in 2010 that he decided to leave the role in 1999 after three years playing Huw as he feared being typecast. Elis has commented, \\"My agent at the time told me that if you are in a soap for three years, it takes three years for the viewers to forget you, whereas if you are in one for five years, it takes another 10 years before they forget you. I just felt it was time to go. It was great to be on it but it was just a job to me.\\" Lenny Wallace Lenny Wallace is played by Desune Coleman from 28 May 1996 to 6 July 1999. Coleman was appearing in a West End production of Miss Saigon when he was cast as Lenny. He spent a fortnight filming for EastEnders and appearing in the musical at the same time. Colemen commented, \\"My first two weeks on EastEnders were probably the most hectic time of my entire life.\\" Lenny was introduced around the same time as Huw Edwards, played by Richard Elis. Colemen thought they were not \\"huge storyline characters\\" and likened them to the B-side of a record, as they would prop up other plots. Lenny is a fun loving individual, who does not take life too seriously. He has a penchant for loud music and an eye for the ladies. He is first seen in Walford in May 1996. Lenny, along with his Welsh friend, Huw Edwards (Richard Elis), are employed by George Palmer (Paul Moriarty) as barmen for the Cobra Club. Lenny has a keen interest in speedway motorbike racing, and takes Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) along with him on one occasion. Ricky turns out to be quite a skilled racer and Lenny is soon persuading him to take up speedway racing professionally so he can be his manager. He is sacked shortly after when Ricky's wife Bianca (Patsy Palmer) decides to take over the job in his place. Lenny begins work as a barman again in 1998, firstly for Annie Palmer (Nadia Sawalha) until she fires him, and then for Steve Owen (Martin Kemp). Lenny and Huw soon move to Albert Square and begin renting 55 Victoria Road from Mark and Ruth Fowler (Todd Carty and Caroline Paterson). The house is situated next to Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt)'s and they manage to make an enemy of him by continually playing their music extremely loudly in the evening, and they also operate a pirate radio station from the premises for a while. As well as his bar work, Lenny is also hired as a cab driver by Barry Evans (Shaun Williamson) in 1997. Lenny spends most of his time drinking, playing poker and throwing parties. Lenny is also a womaniser, and he takes an immediate shine to Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer). He constantly pursues her and even though she is dating Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) at the time, they have a one-night stand, which results in a pregnancy scare. Lenny is mortified at the idea of being a father, but it turns out to be a false alarm. Bianca opts not to tell Ricky about her infidelity, and marries him instead. After the Cobra Club closes following a police raid, Lenny loses his job and both he and Huw are unable to pay their rent on time. Mark and Ruth decide to ask them to vacate the property, but they refuse and claim squatters' rights instead. Although it is initially Huw's idea to claim squatters' rights, when Barry Evans offers him a room at his flat, he jumps at the chance and leaves Lenny alone. Lenny is furious, but as it is now just him in the house, Mark and Ruth decide to let him stay on as a lodger and they move back in. He stays with them for several months until he patches up his differences with Huw and they both then decide to squat in one of the flats at 47 Albert Square. Lenny has a keen interest in speedway motorbike racing, and takes Ricky Butcher along with him on one occasion. Ricky turns out to be quite a skilled racer and Lenny is soon persuading him to take up speedway racing professionally so he can be his manager. He is sacked shortly after when Ricky's wife Bianca decides to take over the job in his place. Lenny returns to work as a barman in 1998, firstly for Annie Palmer (Nadia Sawalha) at the Market Cellar until she fires him, and then for Steve Owen (Martin Kemp) at the e20. In 1998 Lenny's womanising catches up with him when his ex-girlfriend, Alice McMahon (Carli Norris), arrives in Walford with the news that she has tested positive for the sexually transmitted disease, Hepatitis B. She fears that he may also be carrying the disease and instructs him to get tested. Robbie Jackson (Dean Gaffney) overhears their conversation, and immediately informs his sister, Bianca. Bianca is mortified, thinking that her prior tryst with Lenny has put her at risk. This leads to Bianca admitting to Ricky that she had sex with Lenny years earlier, and this puts their relationship under severe strain. With everyone on the Square turning against him, Lenny feels isolated and depressed. However Huw is supportive and to Lenny's relief, his test results for Hepatitis B are negative. Later in the year Lenny busies himself with the promotion of Mick McFarlane (Sylvester Williams)'s band and also goes to France with Huw, Barry, and Robbie to watch the 1998 World Cup. He also begins a relationship with Teresa di Marco (Leila Birch), though it soon ends when Teresa's brother, Gianni (Marc Bannerman), finds out about it. Gianni is aware of Lenny's womanising past, and refuses to allow Teresa to see Lenny. After Huw leaves Walford in April 1999, Lenny remains behind working at the e20. When Steve Owen, his boss, is imprisoned for the murder of Saskia Duncan (Deborah Sheridan-Taylor), Lenny earns the wrath of his friends for supporting Steve, instead of Matthew Rose (Joe Absolom), whom Steve has falsely named as the real murderer. Shortly after, Lenny is offered work in a West End club, so he decides to take the offer and leaves Walford in July 1999. Simon Raymond Simon Raymond, played by Andrew Lynford, is introduced in 1996 as the homosexual brother of Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon). His relationship with the bisexual character Tony Hills (Mark Homer) featured a gay kiss that caused controversy in the UK; numerous complaints were made because of its broadcasting. Simon remained in the serial until 1999, at which time it was mutually agreed between Lynford and executive producer Matthew Robinson, that the character had run its course. The character is given a happy ending, reuniting with his former boyfriend Tony to travel Europe. Lynford has suggested that he and the writers of EastEnders intended to portray Simon as a \\"perfectly normal\\" young gay man who would entertain and educate and for whom sexuality was \\"no big deal\\". Frankie Pierre Frankie Pierre appeared between 1996 and 1997, played by Syan Blake. Frankie is introduced as a \\"super-bitch\\" and home wrecker. She attempts to ruin the established relationships of several characters during her year in the soap, purposefully seducing attached men. Frankie's arrival in June 1996 is part of a storyline that breaks up the marriage of the characters Alan and Carol Jackson (Howard Antony and Lindsey Coulson). Frankie eventually departs in March 1997 amidst a failed attempt at seducing a religious evangelist, Alistair Matthews (Neil Clark), who had been trying to make her change her promiscuous lifestyle. Off-screen it was reported that Syan Blake and the producers of EastEnders had decided to write the character out of the serial, as the actress was receiving death threats from angry fans that could not separate fact from fiction, and blamed Blake for her character's home- wrecking. The official EastEnders book Who's Who states that Frankie \\"had a carnivorous approach to relationships, hunting down her quarry, devouring her victim in two gulps and then moving onto the next kill.\\" Mick McFarlane Mick McFarlane is played by Sylvester Williams from 24 June 1996 to 22 January 2002. Williams admitted that he was attracted to the role because of Mick's background, which he thought was interesting. Mick is a musician and he arrives in Albert Square in June 1996, when his jazz band comes to audition for a regular gig in the Bridge Street caf√©'s night Bistro. Alan Jackson (Howard Antony), manager of the night caf√©, hears them play and instantly hires them. Mick's ex-girlfriend Frankie Pierre (Syan Blake) is the singer in the band, and she maliciously ruins several relationships on the Square before she quits the band, and leaves Mick with no band, and no source of income. He is forced to seek work elsewhere, so he starts work at the caf√© in May 1997. In 1998, Mick decides to reform his band and holds auditions for another singer. After turning down many hopefuls, he finds a young female soloist named Lola Christie (Diane Parish). Mick is immediately attracted to Lola and eventually the two start dating. However, later in the year Lola is offered a contract as a professional singer, so she dumps Mick and the band. Later that year Mick is visited by his mother, Josie McFarlane (Joan Hooley), on holiday from Jamaica. Mick is nervous about Josie's visit as he has led her to believe that he is a successful musician. She is not pleased to discover Mick is working in a caf√©. However, Josie has secrets of her own. She brings a young girl named Kim (Krystle Williams) with her, claiming she is a distant relative. However, eventually Josie admits that Kim is Mick's half sister ‚Äì the result of an affair that Mick's late father had had many years before. Kim's mother is dead and Josie took Kim in rather than see her go into care. Josie also confesses that she had been conned in a Jamaican property scam and is now penniless. Mick is extremely shocked to discover that his parents had deceived him for so long, but he welcomes his mother and half-sister into his life and home. Mick soon warms to the idea of having a little sister. although he does find Kim's tagging around after him a little irksome at first. Later that year, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) fires Mick after several residents suffer a bout of food poisoning. In January 1999, Mick makes friends with the new doctor, Fred Fonseca (Jimi Mistry), and moves in with him. Fred later gives Mick a loan when he decides to take over Matthew Rose's (Joe Absolom) CD stall. Later that year, Mick, Fred and a few other Walford residents go to Brighton, where Fred attends a medical convention. Whilst away, it becomes apparent to everyone, bar Mick, that Fred hsd something he wants to reveal. Fred is gay and is too afraid to admit his sexuality to Mick, so takes him to a gay club in the hope that Mick might 'cotton on'. Mick doesn't realise what Fred is trying to tell him and is extremely shocked when Fred finally confesses. Mick is hurt that Fred has felt unable to confide in him and that Fred doesn't fancy him! The friendship stays intact, despite Mick's mother (also Fred's receptionist) denouncing Fred's lifestyle as immoral. Mick later starts dating barmaid/ex-prostitute, Nina Harris (Troy Titus-Adams). However, Mick's judgmental mother causes problems here too, when she discovers Nina's past. Mick and Josie's relationship is sorely tested, culminating in Mick branding his mother a 'lonely, bitter, old woman'. Soon after Josie is forced to leave England after a mix-up with her visa, leaving Kim in Mick's care. Mick and Nina's relationship ends as Nina leaves Walford to look after her dying father. With the added financial responsibility of caring for his young sister, Mick gets a part-time job as a limousine driver for Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). However, he is sacked when Phil finds dog hair in the car, sparking a feud between them with Phil doing everything he can to undermine Mick. However, despite his dislike of Phil, Mick's constant money problems make him swallow his pride and ask for his job at the caf√© back. He also has a spell as the radio controller for Barry Evans' (Shaun Williamson) cab firm. Early in 2002, Mick is offered a gig as a touring saxophone player in a band, but has to turn it down, due to being Kim's legal guardian. Soon after, he needs money to send Kim on a school trip and pleads with Phil for an advance on his wages. Phil refuses and Mick is forced to sell his saxophone to raise the money instead. When Kim discovers this, she buys his saxophone back with the money for her school trip, contacts Mick's musician contact and accepts the gig on his behalf. Kim is adamant that Mick should follow his dream, and so Mick leaves Kim with a relative away from the Square, and leaves Walford himself in January 2002. George Palmer George Palmer, played by Paul Moriarty, appears between 1996 and 1998. Actor Paul Moriarty was asked to read for the role of George along with 10 other actors. Moriarty was called back instantly and asked to begin working on the role the following day. He has commented to an American fan-based publication, \\"[It was] quite overwhelming. I had watched the show but not religiously [...] So I show up at [the studios in] Borehamwood the very next day, straight to make-up and then onto [the soap's setting of] Albert Square to do my first bit [...] I might just as well have landed on Mars.\\" George had been described as \\"shady\\". The character was one of many to be axed in 1998 by Executive Producer Matthew Robinson, following a dip in ratings. Betty Betty, also known as Auntie Betty, is played by Vivienne Martin. She is Arthur Fowler's (Bill Treacher)'s aunt from Leigh-on-Sea. Betty is mentioned several times prior to her appearance; in 1986, Arthur, his wife Pauline (Wendy Richard) and daughter Michelle (Susan Tully) tell Pauline's mother, Lou Beale (Anna Wing), that they are visiting Betty, when in reality they are searching for their missing son Mark (David Scarboro) in Southend-on-Sea. Later in the year, Arthur considers begging Betty for money towards Michelle's wedding to Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt); he does, but instead of money she sends Michelle a note about \\"what to expect of married life\\". In 1988, an ailing Lou spends some time in Leigh-on-Sea with Betty, before returning home to die. Arthur and Pauline also recuperate at Betty's in late 1989, while Pauline recovered from both fibroids and being hit by Ricky Butcher's (Sid Owen) car. Betty appears in 1996 for Arthur's funeral, with her boyfriend Gerard. Betty is greeted by Pauline and Mark (now Todd Carty), while Gerard makes rude and insensitive remarks about Arthur despite never meeting him, disturbing many of those present. Betty clashes with Nellie Ellis (Elizabeth Kelly), continuing a long-standing feud dating back to World War II, when Betty had relationships with several men, including Nellie's boyfriend at the time. In 2004, Pauline names her dog after her. Charlie Mason Detective Chief Inspector Charlie Mason, played by Campbell Morrison, is a detective who first appears when Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) is shot by hitman John Valecue (Steve Weston), working for his wife, Cindy (Michelle Collins). He later appears when Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon) falls down the stairs at The Queen Victoria public house, and arrests Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) for her attempted murder on Christmas Day 1998. He later appears at the inquest into Tiffany's death in January 1999. He also investigates Saskia Duncan (Deborah Sheridan-Taylor)'s disappearance in March 1999 and appears at Steve Owen (Martin Kemp) and Matthew Rose (Joe Absolom)'s trial for her murder in October 1999. This is his last appearance. Terry Raymond Terry Raymond, played by Gavin Richards, is initially introduced briefly in 1996 as the drunken father of Tiffany (Martine McCutcheon) and Simon Raymond (Andrew Lynford). He is reintroduced as a full-time character in 1997 and remains in the serial until 2002, when actor Gavin Richards decided to leave. Terry was not killed off in the soap; he departed in 2002 in search of his estranged wife. Tim Randall from the Daily Record suggested in 2001 that Terry and Irene's double-act was \\"EastEnders at its best\\", but that the relationship between Terry and Janine was \\"enough to turn your stomach\\".

He does so and Cindy is arrested and charged for attempted murder. } References 1996 *, EastEnders EastEnders ","title":"List of EastEnders characters (1996)"},{"id":"12810942","text":"EastEnders logo The following is a list of characters that first appeared in the BBC soap opera EastEnders in 1997, by order of first appearance. Many were introduced by the show's executive producer, Jane Harris. Neelam Kapoor Neelam Kapoor is played by Jamila Massey. Neelam and her husband built themselves a profitable clothing business but left it in the hands of their son, Sanjay (Deepak Verma), in the late 1980s and emigrated to their native India. However Sanjay proved to be a poor businessman and after some bad monetary investments, his business went bankrupt. Sanjay kept this from his parents and moves to Walford to open a clothing stall in 1993. In February 1997 Sanjay hears news that his father has died. He travels to India for the funeral and returns early in March with his mother in tow. Sanjay's wife Gita (Shobu Kapoor) is horrified. She had always had a tempestuous relationship with Sanjay's interfering mother and she is furious that he has brought her to live with them without her consent. Neelam, sensing Gita's disapproval, goes out of her way to be as obliging as possible and she is even understanding upon hearing the clothing business had floundered. Gita begrudgingly begins to accept Neelam's presence but finds her domineering mannerisms a little irksome.\\"EastEnders TUE 04-MAR-97 episode description\\", Walford.net. Retrieved 30 March 2007. Neelam helps with the running of the Kapoor's market stall, before buying the First Til Last grocery store in August 1997. Neelam is adamant that the shop should be run as a family business, so she fires the resident shop assistant, Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson). Neelam continues to irritate Gita as the year wears on by instructing her on the upbringing of her daughter, Sharmilla (Priya Bilkhu), and accusing her of being a bad wife to Sanjay. Sanjay allows Neelam to pamper him and cater to his every whim, which infuriates Gita further. By October Gita can take no more so she decides to leave Walford with Sharmilla for a holiday with her sister, but not before telling Neelam a few home truths about Sanjay's adultery before departing. Neelam is appalled, but she is only to happy to believe her precious son when he claims Gita was merely lying. Gita and Sharmilla are due to return in January 1998, but they go missing in suspicious circumstances and the police suspect foul play. It transpires that Gita had merely run away after falling pregnant with another man's baby. Sanjay tracks her down and Gita is persuaded to return to Walford with Sharmilla and her new baby. Neelam is furious about Gita's immoral behaviour and will not condone Sanjay taking on another man's child as his own. She tries to convince him to divorce Gita and fight for custody of Sharmilla. Sanjay defiantly refuses to do this, so Neelam sells her shop to Terry Raymond (Gavin Richards) and leaves Walford to live with her extended family in Bristol, disowning her son on the way out. Her last appearance is in July 1998.\\"EastEnders TUE 28-JUL-98 episode description\\", Walford.net. Retrieved 30 March 2007. Courtney Mitchell Courtney Mitchell is the daughter of characters Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) and Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon). From her on-screen birth in 1997 until 1999, Courtney is played by identical twins Carissa and Josephine O'Meara. She was written out of the soap when Kemp decided to quit. When Grant and Courtney return in 2006, Courtney is played by Megan Jossa until they depart once again in June that year. Courtney made an unannounced return on 4 August 2016, played by Alice Nokes, and departed on 9 September 2016. Courtney is born prematurely by caesarean section in March 1997. At first it is unknown whether her father is Grant Mitchell or Tony Hills (Mark Homer), but a DNA test reveals that Grant is her father. Grant and Tiffany separate and Tiffany is about to leave with Courtney on New Year's Eve 1998, but while chasing Grant who has snatched Courtney, Tiffany is struck and killed by Frank Butcher's (Mike Reid) car. Grant and Courtney move to Rio de Janeiro in October 1999, and Courtney lives with her dad and stepmother Carla Mitchell (Christianne Oliveira). Courtney returns to London on 27 March 2006 with Grant. Beyond mischievous, Courtney often refuses to do as she's told, backtalks, and argues with her cousin Ben Mitchell (Charlie Jones). Ben actually tells Courtney that her father killed her mother. Initially she refuses to believe Grant's claim that Tiffany's death was an accident. When Grant's wife Carla arrives, Courtney shows her blatant dislike. Grant decides that they should move to Portugal for a fresh start. But he dumps Carla on 9 June 2006 after discovering that she plans to fleece him and run off with another man, so just Grant and Courtney move to Portugal. In 2010, Courtney is heard on the phone to talking to her grandmother Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor). In August 2016, Courtney reads a text on Grant's phone from his sister-in-law and former wife, Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean), and meets her at a caf√©, saying that Grant is not coming. Courtney asks why she and Grant were not invited to Peggy's funeral, to which Sharon says that they were. Courtney follows Sharon to the police station, where she sees Grant outside. Grant tells Courtney he got arrested for being drunk and rude to a police officer and takes an instant dislike to Belinda Peacock (Carli Norris) when Grant flirts with her. When they talk about the past, Grant tells Courtney that his brother Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) killed Peggy. Courtney storms off when Grant gets angry about her meeting Sharon. Annoyed with the lack of attention from Grant, Courtney refuses to let him stay with her. Courtney visits Phil and Sharon to see if they have heard from Grant as he owes her money, and Sharon gives Courtney some money. Courtney tells Sharon she knows what Phil did to Peggy, but Sharon tells her it is not true. Courtney takes a liking to Mark Fowler (Ned Porteous), not knowing he is her half-brother, and they both admit at Shakil Kazemi's (Shaheen Jafargholi) party they like each other. Louise Mitchell (Tilly Keeper) tells Sharon about them, prompting her and Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) to find them. Sharon, Ian and Phil find out nothing happened between Courtney and Mark. Courtney and Louise merely become witnesses when the Mitchell house is being broken into in order for Ben and Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick) to be kidnapped. Courtney and Louise both hide in the bedroom and in the midst of the panic, Courtney rings Grant for help during the struggle. Shortly afterwards Mark comforts Courtney only to be confronted by Grant who assumes he is one of the attackers. Grant tells Courtney that he is going back to Portugal and Courtney pretends not to care but later she catches up with Grant at the tube station and decides to go to Portugal with him. =Development= Of her casting in 2006, Jossa said: \\"I couldn't believe it when I heard I had got the part... it's going to be amazing and I can't wait.\\" Described as \\"charming, intelligent yet spoilt\\", Courtney \\"loves being the centre of attention and hates sharing the spotlight with anyone\\". Of her casting in 2016, Nokes said, \\"I was so excited [when I got the part]! To be a part of such an experienced cast and in one of the most renowned families in British soaps... it was a dream come true!\\" Nokes was unaware which part she was auditioning for as the scripts she was given had a different character's name. Nokes said that she is similar to Courtney, who is \\"very kind-hearted and very much like her mum, Tiffany. I think she's vulnerable but in an endearing way. However, Courtney is confident and likes to party!\\" She also added that Courtney \\"adores her dad and their relationship is strong. But I think she wants to hate him and teach him a lesson all the time. She feels like the adult in the relationship.\\" Nokes confirmed she would appear in \\"a few episodes\\" and was not sure if she would return in the future, although Nokes seems keen to reprise the role on a full-time basis. Polly Becker Polly Becker, played by Victoria Gould, is a journalist who turns up in Albert Square in March 1997 to report the local happenings for the Walford Gazette. Author Kate Lock has described Polly as \\"hard-bitten, cynical, ambitious\\" and someone who \\"never allowed sentiment to get in the way of a good story.\\" As well as reporting on the scandalous private lives of a few Walford residents, Polly is embroiled in a love triangle storyline with bi-sexual Tony Hills (Mark Homer) and gay Simon Raymond (Andrew Lynford).

Alex's most notable storyline is a love affair with Kathy Mitchell (Gillian Taylforth) who is married to Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Discussing the storyline, Driscoll has suggested that Alex had been \\"wracked by emotional and spiritual turmoil ever since\\" sleeping with Kathy. He added, \\"Alex has got a lot of conflict. He's been suggesting to his father that he should work at his relationship with his wife ‚Äì but there he is having an affair with a married woman. He feels a bit of a hypocrite ‚Äì he feels guilty and ashamed. But the inescapable fact is he's attracted to Kathy. Something strange and wonderful happens to him when he's around her.\\" Annie Palmer Annie Palmer, played by Nadia Sawalha, is the daughter of George Palmer (Paul Moriarty), and arrives to help George manage his dodgy businesses.

Josh was introduced as part of a storyline to aid the departure of the long-running characters, Nigel and Clare Bates (played by Paul Bradley and Gemma Bissix). Actor Paul Bradley had decided to leave the serial, reportedly for fear of being typecast. The writers of EastEnders wanted to give Nigel a happy ending, so a character named Julie Haye (Karen Henthorn) was invented to be a love interest for Nigel, whilst her son, Josh, was invented to be a love interest for Nigel's daughter, Clare. Josh, is played by Jon Lee, who went on to find greater fame as a singer in the successful pop group, S Club 7. Lee has said that he won a part in EastEnders \\"by complete accident really.\\" He played the role of Josh for six months. As the storyline reaches its end, the Bates family join Josh and his mother for a new life in Scotland.

Clare develops an instant crush on Josh, and she spends the following few weeks trying to impress him. They start dating, despite initial objections from Clare's father, Nigel. It transpires that Josh is actually the son of Clare's teacher, Julie Haye. Clare is mortified by this initially, and she refuses to speak to Josh for a brief period. However, she soon comes to accept the situation, and is even pleased when her father begins dating Josh's mother. Josh finds himself caught in the middle of his warring parents‚Äîhis father, Eliot (Lawrence Lambert), is furious when Julie announces that she is planning to move to Scotland with Josh in 1998. Eliot is Jewish, and Josh is obliged to have a Bar Mitzvah to appease his father before he leaves for Scotland. Josh is initially opposed to this, as he is not remotely interested in religion. He starts missing his Bar Mitzvah tutorials, which does not please his father, but he ultimately decides to go ahead with the Bar Mitzvah. It takes place in March 1998 and Clare is present as his guest. Nigel and Julie's relationship ends when Nigel begins to have second thoughts, and Julie and Josh leave Walford for Scotland in April 1998. Clare is upset to see Josh go, they say their goodbyes, but just at the last minute, Nigel changes his mind again, and asks Julie if he and Clare can move to Scotland with her and Josh.

Lola Christie Lola Christie is played by Diane Parish. Lola was introduced as a love interest for Mick McFarlane (Sylvester Williams). Parish notably returned to EastEnders in 2006 playing a different character, Denise Fox. Lola Christie auditions as a singer for Mick McFarlane (Sylvester Williams)'s band. Mick is impressed with her singing talents and offers her the job. Mick is attracted to Lola, they start dating, but she is always rushing off without warning and Mick is surprised to discover that Lola has a secret young son named Carl whose father, Neil, had abandoned Lola when she was 5 months pregnant. Mick proves supportive, but Lola eventually leaves Mick and the band when she gets her own recording contract as a soloist. =Creation= At the time, Lola was the highest profile role for actress Diane Parish. The character was a singer in Mick's jazz band; Parish had worked her way through drama school at RADA by doing session singing at a recording studio, though she had never seriously considered singing as a career. Parish has commented, \\"The only reason I took on the role of Lola was because her storyline wasn't really to do with her singing, that was just incidental. There was a bit of interest at the time ‚Äì but I have to confess I didn't exactly have Island Records beating my door down with a contract!\\". In a televised interview in 2020, Parish described the singing aspect of the role as \\"excruciating\\", claiming it made her unsuited to play Lola. Following the end of her initial six-month contract, Parish decided to leave EastEnders. In a 1998 interview she revealed, \\"I had made a decision that I would stay only six months, whatever happened. But I was tempted to stay longer because it is such a great show and lovely people. Leaving was like ripping away from real friendships ‚Äì but I'm not in this business to settle down. I get itchy feet and I left to do Picking Up the Pieces which is a real challenge. Being a part of EastEnders is like nothing else, a whole different beast from other shows because practically everyone has watched it at some time and you get to be known wherever you go. I thought that would end when I left, but I still get it even now.\\" She has since revealed that she found it hard to cope with the fame of being in such a high-profile soap, and in a 2002 interview with the Daily Mirror it was reported that she \\"hated\\" her time in the soap so much, that she had no qualms about turning down a long- term contract: \\"I resented being a 'star' and I resented acting like one. It is cliquey, and once you are in a soap, that is it. The soap just clings on to you. People say: 'Everything you do before a soap and after does not matter.' It is true. EE made me odd. I was bobbing along happily as a jobbing actress, and then EE came along. I found it strange to lose my anonymity. People really believe they own you. They grab you, scream at you. I did not cope well. I became introverted and I stayed in a lot. I felt a bit depressed, too. I felt I had lost something. In the end I just had to get out. I lost the point as to why I was doing the job, and to be perfectly frank it just got messy.\\" However, in the same interview, Parish said she would consider returning to EastEnders if they asked her: \\"I'd handle things better. I love watching it. Jim Branning is fab.\\" Parish did return to the soap in 2006, but playing a completely different character, Denise Fox. On her decision to return, Parish said, \\"EastEnders was different back then. There was a spotlight on anyone in it ‚Äì some actors were akin to pop stars. It's calmer now.\\" Beppe di Marco Beppe di Marco, played by Michael Greco, is first seen when local residents George Palmer and Peggy Mitchell (Paul Moriarty and Barbara Windsor) attend his father's funeral. He soon moves to Albert Square with the rest of his family. Beppe is his family's pride and joy, so it is a big shock to them when he is fired from the police force for attempting to frame his sworn enemy and Peggy's youngest son Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) for GBH on his long-suffering wife Tiffany Raymond (Martine McCutcheon). The character Beppe is ta heart- throb and he becomes involved in numerous relationships, which of all ended in disaster.

Nicky makes the first move on her tutor and he initially reciprocates, but then takes things too far and sexually assaults Nicky, who then tells her family what has happened, but doesn't reveal she is partly to blame. This leads to her overprotective brother Gianni attacking Rod. Gianni is charged with assault but the charges are dropped when Nicky admits that she has not told the whole truth. Nicky then admits that she was afraid that her family wouldn't have believed that she had been molested if she had admitted she'd made the first move. When she realises her family have doubts of her innocence, she decides to leave home, and is last seen explaining that she has received the address for a hostel. Most of the di Marco family leave Walford soon after for a new life in Leicester in August 2000. The charges on Rod are also dropped. Rosa di Marco Rosa di Marco, played by Louise Jameson.

It is later revealed that Rosa and George had a fling many years ago during the time her husband was in prison. This leads George to believe that Rosa's son Gianni could be his son. Teresa di Marco Teresa di Marco, played by Leila Birch, is Rosa di Marco (Louise Jameson)'s eldest daughter and a wild child, despite the fact she has her overprotective, big brothers Beppe and Gianni (Michael Greco and Marc Bannerman) looking out for her. She first appears at her father's funeral in January 1998, and had recently failed her A-level exams, making her mother suspicious that she had done this on purpose, so she can stay as a waitress in the family restaurant. However, Teresa has higher aspirations than working in the family business, and so gets her own stall on the market. Teresa also knows how to find trouble. She is caught with drugs by the police, finds out that her bisexual boyfriend Tony Hills (Mark Homer) had an affair with his ex-boyfriend Simon Raymond (Andrew Lynford). Teresa also had flings with Lenny Wallace (Desune Coleman) and the married Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen). Teresa then runs away with her then boyfriend, Matthew Rose (Joe Absolom), who is suspected of murdering Saskia Duncan. When they are finally found, Matthew is found guilty and Teresa is crushed. She campaigns to get him freed, and when he is the two are reunited, but his desire for revenge on the real murderer Steve Owen (Martin Kemp) scares her and they break up. Following her sister Nicky (Carly Hillman)'s accusations of assault, most of the di Marcos decide to leave for Leicester and, after a heart to heart with brother Beppe, makes Teresa realise she needs a new start. She then joins her family and heads out of Walford. Joe di Marco Joe di Marco is played by Jake Kyprianou between 1998 and 2002. Joe's most notable storyline is being \\"the focus of a tug-of-love\\" between his mother and father. Joe, along with his father Beppe di Marco (Michael Greco), was axed by the executive producer of EastEnders, John Yorke. The Italian di Marco family were introduced early in 1998 by executive producer Jane Harris. They were heralded as the \\"family that would rival the Mitchells\\"‚Äîwho are one of the most successful and long-running families to have been featured in EastEnders. The di Marcos \\"landed with an almighty thud in January [1998], turning out in force for the funeral of patriarch Giuseppe\\", Joe's grandfather. The following month, the family moved to the area in which the soap is set, Walford. Joe is featured in various storylines that focus on his relationship with his father, Beppe, and Beppe's struggles as a single parent. \\"There was a flurry of interest\\" in 2000, when Joe's estranged mother Sandra (Clare Wilkie) was introduced into the serial. She vows to take Beppe to court for custody of Joe, but after a lengthy battle, and a tug-of-love that leads to Joe getting injured, this does not occur. In the storyline, Joe remains with his father after Beppe agrees to give Sandra visitation rights. The majority of the di Marcos stayed in EastEnders until 2000, when a new executive producer, John Yorke, decided to cull them all, except Joe, Beppe and his estranged wife Sandra (though she was also written out early in 2001 when the custody battle storyline ended). The di Marcos were reportedly \\"slaughtered because of a shortage of ideas for what to do with them.\\" However, a spokesperson at the time commented: \\"These changes‚Ä¶are just part of [John Yorke's] plans to revamp the series and give it a new look.\\" The cuts paved the way for the arrival of the \\"hugely popular\\" Slater family. Beppe and Joe remained until 2002, when they were also axed. The characters departed in June, two months earlier than contracted. This was due to Beppe's actor Michael Greco, who requested to be released early from his contract. The boy who played Joe, Jake Kyprianou, reportedly gave up acting after leaving the role. The di Marcos are now deemed as something of a failure for EastEnders. =Storylines= Joe di Marco is the son of Beppe and Sandra di Marco (Michael Greco and Clare Wilkie). Sandra abandoned Joe when he was young due to Beppe's interfering family. Joe was raised by his father, his grandmother Rosa (Louise Jameson) and his great grandmother Luisa (Stella Tanner). Sandra comes back into Joe's life in 2000. He bonds with his mother, and despite initial hostilities Beppe also welcomes Sandra back into his life. However it transpires that Sandra is only using Beppe to get access to Joe and she later reconciles with her former lover, Jack Robins (Chook Sibtain). She and Jack plan to abscond with Joe, however Beppe catches her in the act. Beppe and Sandra are then involved in a custody battle for Joe. The constant rowing has a negative effect on Joe and he finds it difficult to choose between his warring parents. This culminates in him getting hit by a car when he disobeys his father and runs across the road to be with his mother. Joe is not seriously hurt, but the accident makes his parents rethink their behaviour. Beppe eventually allows Sandra visitation rights and Joe remains with his father. Beppe's serial womanising has a negative effect on Joe in 2001, when he walks in on his father being seduced by his teacher, Kay Bradshaw (Vanessa Earl). Joe is so unsettled that he refuses to go to school the following day. In 2002, Joe leaves with his father to live in Leicester following Rosa's death. Nicole Moore Nicole Moore is played by Sara Stephens. She is the mother of Jessie Moore (Chelsey Padden), the foster daughter of Mark (Todd Carty) and Ruth Fowler (Caroline Paterson). Nicole was in prison, and asks her solicitor if she can see her daughter Jessie whilst in prison. Mark and Ruth initially refuse, but Nicole was granted her wish. Mark and Ruth later hear from their solicitor that Nicole will be released in a couple of weeks time, and will be granted permission to see Jessie once a fortnight. Mark and Ruth are devastated by this, and are forced to face the fact that Jessie may not be with them for much longer. On Jessie‚Äôs birthday, Mark and Ruth host a party for her. Nicole turns up at the party, leaving Mark and Ruth furious. However, Jessie is over the moon to see her mother. Mark later asks his solicitor if Nicole was allowed to walk in like that, and his solicitor explains that this should have been done through social services first. Ruth later takes pity on Nicole the next time she visits, when she explains that she is getting herself together and cannot wait to be reconciled with her daughter. Ruth allows her to visit whenever she likes, but Mark is furious at this. Ruth reminds Mark that he should not be getting emotionally attached to Jessie, and this causes them to argue. Nicole gains custody of Jessie, and they both move back in together in April 1998. A month later, Nicole and Jessie visit Ruth, and she tells Nicole that her and Mark have split up. Eliot Saunders Eliot Saunders, played by Lawrence Lambert, is the father of Josh Saunders (Jon Lee) and former husband of Julie Haye (Karen Henthorn). Eliot is angry about Julie taking Josh to live in Scotland. As Eliot is Jewish, Josh is obliged to have a Bar Mitzvah to appease his father before he leaves for Scotland. Josh is initially opposed to this, as he is not remotely interested in religion. He starts missing his Bar Mitzvah tutorials, which does not please Eliot who says he and his family will not support Josh in his life if he does not go through with it. Josh ultimately decides to go ahead with the Bar Mitzvah. It takes place in March 1998. Hayley Edwards Hayley Edwards, played by Karin Diamond, is the sister of Huw (Richard Elis), who tries to contact her brother in February 1998 to tell him that their father has died. She leaves messages with Huw's friend Lenny Wallace (Desune Coleman), but Huw denies knowing anyone called Hayley (he had fallen out with his family when he was caught in bed with his fianc√©e's sister). Hayley then arrives in Walford to persuade him to attend the funeral, but he flatly refuses until the last minute, when he takes the train home to Wales with her. Louise Raymond Louise Raymond, played by Carol Harrison, is the estranged wife of Terry Raymond (Gavin Richards) and mother of Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon) and Simon Raymond (Andrew Lynford). She is first seen during the wedding ceremony of Terry and Irene Hills (Roberta Taylor), when Louise stops proceedings to announce that she and Terry are still married. Harison has described Louise as \\"very strong and resilient but deep down she has a very vulnerable streak [...] there are two sides to her. She is a lot of fun but she carries a lot of pain. Louise is a woman of the world who has had very high highs and very low lows. She is also a woman who sees people's flaws and accepts them without judgment.\\" Josie McFarlane Josie McFarlane, played by Joan Hooley, is the mother of Mick McFarlane (Sylvester Williams). She is described as \\"well- groomed...confident\\" and someone who \\"set high ‚Äì if not impossible ‚Äì standards, and inevitably people failed her.\\" Josie fosters a young girl named Kim (Krystle Williams), who she claims is a distant relative of Mick's. Kim is actually the illegitimate daughter of Josie's philandering husband, and after her mother's death, Josie kindly takes her in instead of seeing her go into care. Kim McFarlane Kim McFarlane, played by Krystle Williams, first arrives in Albert Square in August 1998 along with her guardian Josie McFarlane (Joan Hooley). Both have supposedly come over from Jamaica to visit Josie's son, Mick (Sylvester Williams), however it soon becomes clear that the purpose for their visit is not as innocent as Josie initially makes out. Mick is expecting his mother, but is surprised when she turns up with Kim, whom he has never met or heard of before. Josie claims that Kim is a distant relative, whom she is looking after for a while. However, it is subsequently revealed that instead of being a distant relative, Kim is actually Mick's half-sister. Kim is the product of an affair Mick's father had when he was temporarily estranged from Josie. Her mother had died when she was eight and Josie ‚Äì who had lost her husband by then too ‚Äì adopted Kim, rather than see her taken into care. Mick is shocked at this revelation, but he is a pretty easy going guy, so he soon accepts Kim as his new little sister, although he find Kim's tagging around after him a little irksome at first. Kim attends Walford High School and soon becomes friendly with local girls Sonia Jackson and Nicky di Marco (Natalie Cassidy and Carly Hillman), although she is a bit younger than them, so she often gets excluded from their more mature conversations. Later on in her time in Walford, Kim attends a modelling audition with Nicky to give her moral support. However, it is Kim who is successful and not Nicky. Ambitious Josie is delighted and sets about trying to get Kim to attend as many auditions as possible. However, Kim is rejected at a casting for not being slim enough and so she starts cutting out food, developing an eating disorder that threatens to spiral dangerously out of control. It takes the combined efforts of Mick and Dr Fred Fonseca (Jimi Mistry) to get Kim back on the road to recovery. In 2000, Josie is deported back to Jamaica for forgetting to renew her visa and Kim remains living in Walford with her brother. Kim appears infrequently after this, occasionally showing up to visit Sonia and she also gets a part-time job washing cars for Roy Evans (Tony Caunter). Kim is also very upset when Sonia decides to give up her newborn daughter, Chloe, for adoption, as Kim herself had been an adoptee. When Mick is offered a job touring with a band in 2002, he initially rejects it because of his responsibility towards Kim. However, she is adamant that he should take the job and so he leaves Walford, leaving Kim in the care of their aunt Winnie, who lives away from the square. (This was in contrast to press reports at the time, which stated Kim would move in with the Jackson family.) Kim disappears after this and her current whereabouts have never been revealed. Her last appearance is in January 2002. Fred Fonseca Fred Fonseca, played by Jimi Mistry, is \\"an attractive young doctor\\", who becomes the local GP in 1998, after the retirement of Dr. Legg (Leonard Fenton). Fred befriends Mick McFarlane (Sylvester Williams), and comes out as a homosexual, and as a result is subjected to homophobia from several of the local residents, including teenager Martin Fowler (James Alexandrou). Carrie Swann Carrie Swann, played by Holly Atkins, is an artist and friend of Teresa di Marco (Leila Birch). She holds an exhibition in the night caf√© in 1998, and returns in 1999 and starts dating Huw Edwards (Richard Elis).

Mel Owen Melanie \\"Mel\\" Owen, played by Tamzin Outhwaite, who arrives in Albert Square to reunite with her brother, Alex Healy (Richard Driscoll).

In 2001, she is kidnapped by her former lover, Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass). Billy Mitchell Billy Mitchell, played by Perry Fenwick, is a distant relative of Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden).

In 2011, he makes contact with his granddaughter, Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold) for the first time. Lilly Mattock Lilly Mattock, played by Barbara Keogh, is first seen in Albert Square in 1998 when she moves into a flat with fellow senior-citizen Dot Cotton (June Brown), after both of their respective homes have burnt down. Lilly likes to forget her age and concentrates on having fun. This is in stark contrast to Dot, and the two often tease each other with their obvious personality differences. Lilly has a rude awakening when she is mugged in 1999, and she is never quite the same again. Jamie Mitchell Jamie Mitchell, played by Jack Ryder, is the nephew of Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick), who is also Jamie's legal guardian. Billy physically abuses Jamie, so he is taken in by his godfather, Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). \\"Cockney totty\\" Jamie has brief flings with Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) and Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan), but it is Sonia Jackson (Natalie Cassidy) who proves to be Jamie's first and only true love.

Gina and Ian later reminisce about Cindy and kiss. She then reveals that she cannot have children, and Ian decides to let her care for Cindy Jnr. Ian later visits Gina to see the eclipse in 1999, and she nearly kisses him again, but is interrupted by Melanie Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite), who later proposes to Ian. Gina is seen again in September 2007. Ian visits her as he suspects that she has been harassing him by pretending to be his deceased wife Cindy and sending malicious emails and packages. He enters her house without permission and is shocked to see that Gina has made a shrine to Cindy on her living-room wall. Gina greets Ian from behind a shotgun, but she then assures him that both she and her dead sister have put the past behind them. Ian is concerned when Gina says she regularly \\"converses with\\" her dead sister, who had even told her to expect Ian's visit. Ian accuses Gina of stalking him and isn't convinced when she denies responsibility. He advises her to seek professional help. He is later kidnapped by the real stalker: Cindy's son Steven Beale (Aaron Sidwell). Ian's wife Jane (Laurie Brett) becomes frantic, and when Gina arrives in Walford to give Ian a photo of Cindy Jnr, Jane accuses Gina of terrorising Ian and they nearly come to blows. Gina returned to the show on 25 April 2014, after Ian calls her to come to Walford and collect Cindy Jnr following the death of Gina's niece Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater).

Steve Owen Steve Owen, played by Martin Kemp, arrives in Walford and buys the Market Cellar club, which he renovates and names E20. His ex-girlfriend Saskia Duncan (Deborah Sheridan-Taylor) arrives and tries to come between Steve and his new girlfriend Melanie Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite). This leads to Steve and Saskia fighting one night, where Steve hits Saskia over the head with an ashtray, killing her instantly. This is witnessed by Steve's assistant Matthew Rose (Joe Absolom), who helps Steve dispose of the body. However, when the police find the body, Steve frames Matthew, who is consequently found guilty of manslaughter. Saskia Duncan Saskia Duncan, played by Deborah Sheridan-Taylor, arrives in Walford in December 1998 as the obsessive ex-girlfriend of new e20 club owner Steve Owen (Martin Kemp). Steve isn't happy to see her and he tells Saskia he doesn't want her anymore, but she continues to stalk him regardless - up to the point when Saskia resorts to break up Steve's relationship with his new girlfriend Mel Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite). She eventually succeeds in seducing him, and subsequently refuses to listen when Steve insists it was a mistake. On e20's launch night, Saskia breaks into Steve's office and kisses him. As Mel storms out of the room, it is revealed that Saskia had been pregnant with Steve's baby - but had an abortion when he said he that he didn't want it. Saskia blames him for \\"making her kill the baby\\". When Steve tries to throw her out of the office, she attacks him with a champagne bottle and attempts to strangle him with his tie. It is at that moment when local resident Matthew Rose (Joe Absolom), who works in the club as Steve's employed DJ, walks in the altercation. He promptly tries to separate Saskia from Steve, but she hysterically fights him off and goes for Steve again. Steve reaches for the nearest object, an ashtray, and gives Saskia a brutal blow to the head, killing her instantly. Steve and Matthew then bury her body in Epping Forest. Saskia's disappearance is investigated by police, and her sister Claudia Fielding (Rolma Walker) arrives and suspects that Steve is involved with her disappearance.

Matthew then leaves the Square. In 2018, Saskia's murder was brought up by Ciara Maguire (Denise McCormack) when she told Steve and Mel's son Hunter Owen (Charlie Winter) about who his father really was. Hunter has spent his whole life believing his dad was a hero, but Ciara threatened Mel and said she would tell him the truth if her money wasn't given to her in full. When Mel refuses to discuss about Saskia, Hunter manages to find an old news article on the internet.

Many were introduced by the show's executive producer, Matthew Robinson. Nina Harris Nina Harris, played by Troy Titus-Adams, appears between 1999 and 2000. The character was axed by John Yorke, making her final appearance in June 2000. Titus-Adams was critical about the lack of material given to her, accusing the BBC of tokenism. Nina arrives in Walford looking for a fresh start away from her past as a prostitute. Nina helped imprison her violent pimp Vinny, a former boyfriend who had got her addicted to drugs and then persuaded her to turn to prostitution so she could feed their habit. Nina stays with her aunt Irene Raymond (Roberta Taylor) and settles in by becoming a barmaid in The Queen Victoria public house. Claudia Fielding Claudia Fielding (n√©e Duncan), played by Romla Walker, is the sister of Saskia Duncan (Deborah Sheridan-Taylor), who arrives in Walford after her sister's death on 14 February 1999. She arrives in Walford as it was the last place Saskia was seen, and her disappearance is being investigated by the police. Claudia is suspicious of Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), her sister's former fianc√© (and killer), but then becomes dependent on him, alternating between the two and irritating Steve. Matthew Rose (Joe Absolom), who witnessed Saskia's death, is worried that Claudia will discover that her sister is dead. She eventually returns home after Saskia's body is found buried in Epping Forest. Claudia testifies at Steve's trial and is devastated when he is cleared of Saskia's murder, with Matthew found guilty instead. After Matthew wins an appeal against his sentence and returns to Walford to get his revenge on Steve, he claims to have murdered Claudia and planted evidence to frame Steve. Matthew later reveals this was merely a ruse to scare Steve. Dan Sullivan Dan Sullivan, played by Craig Fairbrass, arrives in Albert Square as Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson)'s latest boyfriend in 1999 and they plan to marry on discovering she is expecting his child. Carol's daughter Bianca Butcher (Patsy Palmer) is stunned to see him, as they had a fling when she was a teenager on holiday, many years before.

Susie Price Susie Price, played by Viva Duce, is the older sister of Natalie Price (Lucy Speed) and she is first seen in EastEnders in August 1999, when Natalie, who has been estranged from her family for some time, returns to her family home to introduce her new fianc√©, Barry Evans (Shaun Williamson). Natalie and Susie do not get along. Their mother, Andrea (Cindy O'Callaghan), had always favoured Susie, and the two of them like nothing better than to pick holes in Natalie. Susie is angry with Natalie because she has been absent for several years and she constantly jibes Natalie about her appearance and how unattractive Barry is. Susie's last appearance is in December 1999, when she attends Natalie and Barry's wedding. Jackie Owen Jacqueline \\"Jackie\\" Owen, played by Race Davies, appears from 1999 to 2000. Davies quit the role in 2000 after only four months on the soap. She commented, \\"I've really enjoyed myself working on EastEnders but I feel that I've done as much as I can on the show and I'm looking forward to new challenges.\\" Jackie arrives in Walford in September 1999, looking for her brother, Steve (Martin Kemp), after hearing that he is to stand trial for murdering Saskia Duncan (Deborah Sheridan-Taylor). Jackie's husband, Doug (a hotelier and club owner), was sent to prison for manslaughter after accidentally killing a violent punter. Whilst there, he committed suicide, so Jackie is determined that her brother will not share the same fate. Jackie believes her brother is innocent, but aware of the hostility towards him in the Square, she initially refrains from revealing her connection to him. She takes a job as a waitress at Giuseppe's Italian restaurant, owned by the di Marco family. In between shifts, Jackie starts questioning the residents of Walford about Steve, hoping to find something that will exonerate him. When Gianni di Marco (Marc Bannerman) discovers a prison visiting order in Jackie's belongings, he reveals her true identity, infuriating the locals. During Steve's trial, Jackie realises that Steve is lying about murdering Saskia. She is furious but still gives tearful and moving testimony that undoubtedly sways the jury in Steve's favour and probably buys his freedom. Steve is found not guilty, whilst Matthew Rose (Joe Absolom), whom Steve has framed, is found guilty of manslaughter and is sent to prison for a crime he didn't commit. Jackie and Steve are the targets of regular animosity on the Square, regarding Steve's actions. Martin Fowler (James Alexandrou) in particular, has it in for Jackie, and after goading her in the restaurant one day, Jackie finally loses it and fiercely orders him to leave. Martin proceeds to steal a customer's money from a nearby table and then does a runner. Jackie and Gianni follow him into a half-demolished building and as Martin looks back from outside, he hears Jackie shriek as a huge piece of piping falls towards her. Jackie is trapped but awake and Gianni lays half-conscious beside her. Whilst they wait to be rescued, they begin sharing life stories and begin to bond. The firemen have difficulty moving the debris as any wrong move could bring the whole roof down. Amidst all the chaos, Jackie and Gianni manage to kill time by flirting and just as the two lean in to kiss, the roof collapses. Steve rushes into the building to save them and neither is badly injured. Over the following months, Jackie gets involved with the free Matthew Rose campaign, possibly to relieve her guilt for her part in his imprisonment. She and Gianni begin a relationship and it seems as if the womanising Italian is really falling for Jackie. However, Jackie isn't the easiest woman to please. She has a quick temper and a jealous streak and as time goes by, these tendencies became more and more apparent. Jackie begins taking everything Gianni says the wrong way, resulting in screaming matches for seemingly no reason. After Jackie manages to scald Gianni by tipping hot coffee over him in a fit of rage, she finally explains she suffers with severe Premenstrual Tension (PMS) for a week every month which makes her enraged and violent. Gianni is uncharacteristically sympathetic and he tries making allowances for Jackie's behaviour. Later, after injuring Gianni by punching him in the face and smashing up the restaurant, Jackie seeks medical help. She is given medication and hopes that this will solve her problem but it doesn't. After hitting Gianni with a saucepan one night, Jackie decides to end the relationship as she cannot stand the thought of harming him. Gianni is stunned, as he has fallen deeply in love with her. Gianni makes one last attempt to save their relationship, but when his mother, Rosa (Louise Jameson), discovers the abuse Jackie has put him through, she forbids Jackie from having anything more to do with him. Jackie leaves Walford after learning of her brother's drug habit in June 2000. Steve returns from rehab alone. When their mother, Barbara (Sheila Hancock), falls ill a year later, she relays that Jackie has refused to help her and it is subsequently revealed that they hate each other. Jackie refuses to attend her funeral in 2001 and doesn't attend Steve's funeral in 2002 either. In April 2002, Steve's widow, Mel Owen (Tamzin Outhwaite), discovers she and Jackie are being investigated by the police for money laundering and drug trafficking. Steve was actually guilty of these crimes but had set them up as company directors of his illegitimate businesses, and following his death, they are held accountable.  Troy Harvey Troy Harvey, played by Jamie Jarvis, is a friend of Tony Hills (Mark Homer), who had attended school with his older brother. Troy arrives in Albert Square looking for Tony, but has missed him as he has gone to Amsterdam with his boyfriend and stepbrother, Simon Raymond (Andrew Lynford). Troy begins staying with Tony's mother Irene Raymond (Roberta Taylor) and her husband Terry (Gavin Richards) at 87 George Street and begins helping out in their shop. It becomes apparent that Troy is attracted to Irene and begins flirting with her. Soon the two of them begin an illicit affair, behind Terry's back. The affair ends on Christmas Day 1999 when Terry discovers an engraved watch given to Troy by Irene and begins to realise his wife is cheating on him. After punching Troy, Terry offers Irene to him, stating that he loves her enough to give her up if that is what she wants. Seeing that Troy is unwilling to accept Irene, Terry throws him out of the house and threatens to kill him if he ever attempts to contact Irene or show his face again. Asif Malik Asif Malik, played by Ashvin Luximon from 1999 to 2003, is a school friend of Martin Fowler (James Alexandrou). Together they get into much trouble such as shoplifting and vandalism, getting into trouble with Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), but almost always when Martin is caught, Asif leaves him behind to explain himself to his mother Pauline (Wendy Richard). His own family are never seen on-screen but are mentioned occasionally. He rarely has storylines which centre only on him and all his storylines are linked with Martin or with his fellow schoolmates Nicky di Marco (Carly Hillman) and Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks). He goes on a few dates with Nicky but it doesn't turn into anything serious. He also has a crush on Janine which is not reciprocated. He is last seen in October 2003 when he passes his A-levels and goes to university. He has not appeared since. It is revealed in 2004 that Asif is living in Edinburgh and is getting married; he invites Martin to his stag party off-screen.  Enrico di Clemente  Enrico di Clemente, played by Francois Pandolfo, is an Italian foreign exchange student, who stays with the Fowler family in 1999. He makes a big impression on Sonia Jackson (Natalie Cassidy), particularly when she discovers that he is a fellow trumpet player with a penchant for jazz music. However, he also receives a lot of unwanted attention from Sonia's friend, Nicky di Marco (Carly Hillman), which causes several arguments. Sonia is sure that Enrico prefers Nicky and so she shuns him when he asks her on a date. Nicky eventually grows tired of Enrico constantly talking about Sonia, so she tells him to tell her how he feels. He does, and Sonia is overjoyed. However their romance is short-lived, as Enrico returns home to Italy the following day, but not before he takes her for a romantic meal and a dance at Giuseppe's Italian restaurant. They share a kiss, and Sonia confesses that it had been her first.

One origin was a clan name taken from a fief north of Shaanxi granted to Ji Sun, a descendant of King Wen of Zhou. Some members descend from Ji Sun himself, others from his vassals. Another source was a cadet branch of the ruling House of Mi () of the State of Chu during the Spring and Autumn period. Among these Pans, Pan Chong served as regent and advisor for the state of Chu. When King Cheng of Chu decided to make a younger son the crown prince, Pan Chong aided the elder prince Shangchen instead. Shangchen forced King Cheng to commit suicide and ascended the throne as King Mu of Chu. Pan Chong was made the \\"Royal Tutor\\".

It is located on Krautmaart, an irregularly shaped street in the historic heart of the city, in Ville Haute quarter. Next to the Chamber is the Grand Ducal Palace, the official residence of the Grand Duke of Luxembourg. Due to the H√¥tel's location, 'Krautmaart' has become a metonym for the Chamber of Deputies itself. History Until 1860, the Chamber of Deputies had no regular meeting place, variably holding sessions in the Grand Ducal Palace, Luxembourg City Hall, and the H√¥tel du Gouvernement. For a period after the promulgation of Luxembourg's constitution in 1848, the Chamber met in a primary school in Ettelbruck, in the north of the country. By the late 1850s, this was becoming untenable, and to restore the Grand Ducal Palace to the use of the Grand Ducal Family, plans were laid for the construction of a dedicated home for the Chamber in 1857 by Antoine Hartmann. Construction began on 27 July 1858, and the building was inaugurated on 30 October 1860, upon the opening of a new parliamentary session. The plenary meeting room; middle: orator's pulpit, behind: seat of the President; on the sides: benches of the deputies. During the German occupation during the Second World War, the Chamber of Deputies was suspended and the building's functions made subservient to those of the occupation forces. The building was turned into the headquarters of the Luxembourgish branch of the Gau Propaganda Office (). The balcony was decorated with a large sign hailing the Heim ins Reich, while, later on, large Swastika flags were flown on the outside. Between 1997 and 1999, major renovations were undergone, and the building expanded to accommodate the public. The dilapidated wooden decor was replaced by replicas in the original style, with the structural supports strengthened and reconfigured to comply with more stringent health and safety standards. Meanwhile, the expansion, to receive the public and perform ancillary functions, was built in a modern style. During this time, the Chamber convened in the City Hall, just as it had 140 years previously.

Allaire. It is notable as one of the earliest American examples of a company town. Allaire purchased the Howell Works property to provide pig iron for his Allaire Iron Works in New York, which was at the time a leading manufacturer of marine steam engines. The Howell Works also manufactured its own lines of cast iron products. Allaire eventually transformed the Howell Works into an almost completely self-sufficient community, with its own housing and food supply for the workforce, its own post office, church, school and company store, even its own currency. After bog iron was made redundant by the increasing availability of iron ore, Allaire closed the Howell Works and eventually retired there with his family. The property remained in private hands until being bequeathed to the state in 1941. Today, the Howell Works is a registered historic site known as Allaire Village. Background James Peter Allaire founded his first company, a brass foundry, at 462 Cherry Street, New York, in 1804. In 1807, Allaire received an order from steamboat pioneer Robert Fulton for brass fittings for the North River Steamboat, the world's first commercially successful steam-powered vessel. Allaire subsequently became interested in marine steam engine technology, and in 1815 he established a plant in New York for the production of such engines, the Allaire Iron Works.Swann, p. 5. Allaire soon ran into supply problems with his new ironworks. With little demand in the United States for the high quality pig iron necessary for building marine steam engines, the local pig iron industry was in its infancy and unable to supply him with either the quantity or quality he required. The best quality pig iron was imported from the United Kingdom, but high tariffs made it too expensive to purchase.Swann, pp. 5-6. Allaire's solution was to become a manufacturer of pig iron. In 1821, a friend and business associate of Allaire's, Benjamin B. Howell, began leasing a bog-iron furnace in Monmouth County, New Jersey, which was known as Monmouth Furnace. After Howell informed Allaire of the property, Allaire decided to raise the capital to purchase it. On 27 April 1822, he purchased the furnace along with of the surrounding land from its owner William Newbold for the sum of $19,000.Swann, p. 6. Allaire's initial capital raising fell through and Newbold promptly sued for the balance, but Allaire was able to refinance. He took full possession of the property in 1823. He renamed the property Howell Works, in honor of Benjamin Howell.James Peter Allaire , Allaire Village website. Operational period, 1822-1850 The property purchased by Allaire contained a large swathe of swampland ‚Äî from which the renewable resource of bog iron was harvested ‚Äî along with forests to process for charcoal to fuel the bog iron conversion. Allaire eventually purchased an additional of woodland to increase the supply for charcoal making. =Workforce= The basic workforce was divided into three different groups: *ore raisers for mining the bog iron from the swampland, *woodchoppers and woodsetters for charcoal production, and *furnace workers, who included casters and molders. Because of the area's isolation, Allaire realized he had to provide virtually all the facilities of a small town to satisfy the daily needs of his employees. Consequently, he hired additional artisans: a blacksmith, carpenters, brickmakers to supply bricks for new buildings on the grounds, farmers to grow food and raise cattle, millers, bakers, butchers and so on. In effect, Allaire built an almost entirely self-contained community.Swann, pp. 6-7. =Financial restructure= In 1824, Allaire sold 50% of the Works to his brother-in-law John Haggerty, who in turn sold his share of the business in 1827 to Thomas P. Wallworth. Allaire and Wallworth incorporated the business in 1828 as the Howell Works Company, with a capital of $150,000.Swann, p.6. By 1833, Allaire was the sole owner once again.Allaire Family Papers, 1808-1901 , processed by Lois R. Densky and edited by Gregory J. Plunges, The Monmouth County Historical Association. =Post office and company scrip= Howell Works Company $1 note Company tokens In 1831, the Howell Works secured a US Postal contract and opened its own Post Office. In the same year, the New Jersey Legislature passed an act prohibiting the use of \\"tickets\\" - in effect, banning the use of currencies other than the state's official currency. Allaire had been planning to issue his own scrip prior to passage of the act.Sources differ as to the reason why Allaire wanted to issue his own scrip. Sitkus attributes it to a shortage of the official currency, while Allaire Village Inc. indicates that it was merely to assist with company bookkeeping. See Sitkus, p. 17, and the Allaire Village website's Company Scrip and Tokens page. In 1832, he initiated a test case. The courts found that the Allaire scrip did not violate the Act because they were \\"due bills\\" (IOU's). Allaire began issuing his workers the scrip, which was redeemable at the company store on the grounds, as well as accepted as payment by businesses in the local area. The scrip was issued in a variety of denominations, from tokens worth a few pennies to notes with a value of between $1 and $10.Company Scrip and Tokens, Allaire Village website. =Transportation hub= As Allaire's business grew, Howell Works became a major transportation center. In 1833 Allaire upgraded the original wooden carriage house, built in 1825, with a larger brick building. He established a stagecoach company that ran a freight-wagon line between Howell Works and his depot at Eatontown Dock (modern-day Oceanport). Later he built another depot at Red Bank further north. To transport the pig iron from Red Bank to New York, Allaire purchased Cornelius Vanderbilt's steamer BellonaSwann, p.7. and established the first regular steam packet service between the two localities. Other steamboats used by Allaire to transport goods and supplies to and from the Howell Works included the Frank, David Brown, Osiris, Iolas and Orus.Sitkus, p. 18. =Company store= Allaire expanded the Howell Works Company Store in 1835 by constructing a new four-story brick building at a cost of $7,000 to house the steadily expanding range of goods for sale.Sitkus, p. 12. The Store's goods included meat, fish and dairy products stored in the basement; hardware, flour, coffee, wine, liquor, groceries, ironware and other goods on the ground floor; and a wide range of furniture to suit buyers of different means on the second floor. The top floor held bulk items and was also used a storage area. The Store also contained the Howell Works Post Office, an apothecary, and an early example of a soda fountain. Customers came from miles around to shop there. At this time, the Store may have been the largest in the entire state of New Jersey.Howell Works Company and General Store, Allaire Village website. =Philanthropy= Allaire was not only interested in the physical wellbeing of his employees. In 1832, he built a church on the Howell Works grounds. The Church was Episcopal in keeping with Allaire's personal faith; however, he was tolerant of other faiths and did not require his employees to attend services.Historic Chapel at Allaire . A strong believer in education, Allaire did require the children of his employees to attend school, which he provided free of charge. Lessons were held three days a week, from dawn to dusk, for children of both sexes between the ages of about five or six to eleven or twelve. Children old enough to train as apprentices could continue their schooling on a part-time basis if they so desired. Lessons were held inside the chapel and provided by the resident minister‚Äîretained by Allaire at a salary of $500 per year‚Äîand an assistant.Education and the Lancastrian system, Allaire Village website. =Peak period= Panoramic view of Howell Works, 1853, showing coal depot and furnace at top, store and other buildings center, and residential buildings at bottom. By 1836, Howell Works had expanded to its peak operation and size. By this time, the Works employed 400 to 600 workers, including not only those who lived in the Works community but many people from the surrounding region. The Works had expanded to over sixty buildings, including a large three-storey charcoal depot storing charcoal, bog iron and flux; the company store and the church; a carriage house and stables; a bakery, gristmill and slaughterhouse; a blacksmith, carpentry shop and wheelwright; an enamelling furnace; numerous row houses for married employees; and finally Allaire's mansion, which included a dormitory wing for the Works bachelors, managed by a housekeeper.Sitkus, pp. 12-14. The blast furnace now included two smaller furnaces or cupolas in addition to the main furnace, all of which were housed in a large casting shed and adjoined by an office, bridgehouse and wheelhouse (the latter containing a large waterwheel to pump air into the furnace). The cupolas were added for the production of cast-iron products, which Allaire was able to manufacture as a result of the surplus pig iron from the Works. His company manufactured items including pots, pans, skillets, kettles and other holloware; along with andirons, pipes, tools and machine castings. Some of these items were sold at the company store, but most were shipped north for sale in New York.The Blast Furnace, Allaire Village website. Allaire established file and screw factories, the latter of which manufactured the first screws made on mechanical lathes. =Decline and closure= At the peak of Howell Works' production, however, Allaire's business empire suffered a series of financial and other setbacks from which it would never fully recover. In October 1836, his steamship the William Gibbons ran aground and was destroyed. In May of the following year, the Panic of 1837 began, triggering a prolonged recession throughout the United States. At about the same time, the Howell Works furnace blew out.Swann, p. 9. The loss of the William Gibbons, along with difficulties in obtaining loans and the loss of product demand caused by the Panic, prevented the Works from returning to full production for two years. Allaire was unable to obtain loans to take possession of his latest steamship, Home, for more than a year after its construction. Soon after he did so, Home sailed only a few voyages before foundering and sinking off North Carolina in October 1837. One hundred people died and the ship was uninsured. The accident cost Allaire $89,708, but his reputation suffered more because of the loss of life.Swan, pp. 9-10. Howell Works was rendered redundant by the discovery in the early 1830s of abundant deposits of iron ore and anthracite coal in the state of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvanian pig iron was cheaper to produce than that of the Works. As coal burns hotter than charcoal, the iron was processed to higher quality. The Howell Works furnace was extinguished for the last time in 1846. Some operations continued until about 1850, when the Works was formally declared bankrupt. Later history Entrance to the \\"deserted village\\" of Howell Works Company, c. 1905 In 1850, James Allaire was forced out of the management of the Allaire Iron Works in New York by his erstwhile business partners, and retired with his second wife Calicia and their only son Hal to the former Howell Works property. After Allaire's death in 1858, ownership of the property passed first to his wife and later to their son Hal.Sitkus, p. 19. Hal Allaire lived as something of a recluse, leaving the property largely unchanged but lacking the funds to fully maintain it.Sitkus, pp. 19-20. As the derelict buildings gradually fell into disrepair, locals dubbed the location \\"Deserted Village\\". After Hal Allaire's death in 1901, the property was purchased by W. J. Harrison. Harrison sold it in 1907 to Arthur Brisbane, then the world's wealthiest journalist, for the sum of $68,000.Sitkus, p. 33. Brisbane leased the Deserted Village to the Monmouth Council of Boy Scouts for twenty years. Following Brisbane's death in 1936, his widow bequeathed the property's to the State in 1941, in accordance with her late husband's wishes. It thereby became known as Allaire State Park.Arthur Brisbane, Allaire Village website.

Description Ottawa Treaty members: Mine action is commonly represented as comprising five complementary groups of activities: *Humanitarian demining, i.e. mine and ERW survey, land release, mapping, marking and clearance *Risk education (RE), i.e. the communication to the public of the risk of ERW and how to act in the presence of ERW *Victim assistance, including rehabilitation and reintegration *Stockpile destruction *Advocacy to promote policies and practices that will reduce the threat from landmines and ERW, usually in the context of disarmament and international humanitarian law. The most commonly applied treaties including the 1997 anti- personnel Mine Ban Treaty (Ottawa Treaty), the Convention on Cluster Munitions, and the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. The objective of these activities is to provide a safe environment in which landmines and ERW do not impede economical, social and health development, and to address the needs of victims. Gender mainstreaming will ensure that the different needs of women, girls, boys and men are taken into account and inequality is not perpetuated. The coordination of mine action activities in affected countries is commonly conducted by Mine Action Coordination Centers (MACC) managed either by the United Nations or the host country government.  Clearance  In its broad sense, mine clearance includes surveying, mapping and marking of minefields and removal of mines from the ground. This range of activities is also sometimes referred to as demining. Humanitarian mine clearance aims to clear land so that civilians can return to their homes and their everyday routines without the threat of landmines and unexploded remnants of war (ERW), which include unexploaded ordnance and abandoned explosive ordnance. This means that all the mines and ERW affecting the places where ordinary people live must be cleared, and their safety in areas that have been cleared must be guaranteed. Mines are cleared and the areas are thoroughly verified so that they can say without a doubt that the land is now safe, and people can use it without worrying about the weapons. The aim of humanitarian demining is to restore peace and security at the community level. = Methods =  Surveying  Non-technical surveying, or the formal gathering of mine-related information, is required before actual clearance can begin. Impact surveys assess the socio-economic impact of the mine contamination and help assign priorities for the clearance of particular areas. Impact surveys make use of all available sources of information, including minefield records (where they exist), data about mine victims, and interviews with former combatants and local people. Technical surveys then define the minefields and provide detailed maps for the clearance operations.  Maps  Maps resulting from the impact surveys and technical surveys are stored in an information management system, including a variety of programme databases, and provide baseline data for clearance organisations and operational planning.  Minefield marking  Minefield marking is carried out when a mined area is identified, but clearance operations cannot take place immediately. Minefield marking, which is intended to deter people from entering mined areas, has to be carried out in combination with mine awareness, so that the local population understands the meaning and importance of the signs.  Manual clearance  Manual clearance relies on trained deminers using metal detectors and long thin prodders to locate the mines, which are then destroyed by controlled explosion.  Mine detection dogs  Dog search for mines in Bosnia and Herzegovina Mine detection dogs, which detect the presence of explosives in the ground by smell. Dogs are used in combination with manual deminers.  Mine detection Rats  As well as dogs, rats detect the presence of explosive in the ground by smell. Rats are used in combination with manual deminers or mechanical demining  Mechanical clearance  Mechanical clearance relies on flails, rollers, vegetation cutters, and excavators, often attached to armoured bulldozers, to destroy the mines in the ground. These machines can only be used in certain terrains, and are expensive to operate. In most situations they are also not 100% reliable, and the work needs to be checked by other techniques.  Mine- risk education (MRE)  Participant reading a risk education leaflet during a UNMAS event in Goma, North Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Roman Catholic festival in Madhu, Sri Lanka. Mine-risk education, or MRE, refers to efforts to raise awareness and promote behavioural change through public- information campaigns, education and training, and liaison with communities. MRE ensures that communities are aware of the risks from mines, unexploded ordnance and/or abandoned munitions and are encouraged to behave in ways that reduce the risk to people, property and the environment. Objectives are to reduce the risk to humans and to restore an environment where economic and social development can occur free from the constraints imposed by landmine contamination. According to the Landmine Monitor Report (2009), Landmine Monitor Report (2009) in 2008, MRE was provided in 57 states and areas, compared to 61 states and areas in 2007. However, in the 1999 MRE programs were identified in just 14 states. MRE activities increased significantly in Yemen and Somaliland, and also increased to some degree in 10 other states. In Palestine, RE decreased in 2008 but rose sharply in response to conflict in Gaza in December 2008‚ÄìJanuary 2009. Some of the main players in MRE include Catholic Relief Services, German Caritas international, the Mines Advisory Group, Handicap International, Save the Children, INTERSOS, DanChurchAid, Norwegian People's Aid, the Mines Awareness Trust, Association for Aid and Relief, Japan and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Within the UN system UNICEF is the lead agency for MRE and supports programmes in 30 countries. International standards have been developed to guide the management of MRE programmes. These standards emphasize that MRE should typically not be a stand-alone activity; it is an integral part of overall mine-action planning and implementation. = Public information dissemination = \\"Public information\\" in the context of mine action describes landmine and unexploded ordnance situations and informs and updates a broad range of stakeholders. Such information may focus on local risk-reduction messages, address broader national issues such as complying with legislation or raise public support for mine-action programmes. Public information \\"dissemination\\", however, is primarily a one-way form of communication transmitted through mass media. Initiatives may be stand-alone MRE projects that are implemented in advance of other mine-action activities. = Education and training = \\"Education and training\\" is a two-way process that involves the imparting and acquiring of knowledge and the changing of attitudes and practices through teaching and learning. Education and training activities may be conducted in formal and non-formal environments: teacher-to-child education in schools, information shared at home from parents to children or from children to their parents, child-to-child education, peer-to-peer education in work and recreational environments, landmine safety training for humanitarian aid workers and the incorporation of landmine safety messages in occupational health and safety practices. = Community liaison = Community liaison refers to the systems and processes used to exchange information between national authorities, mine- action organisations and communities on the presence of mines, unexploded ordnance and abandoned munitions. It enables communities to be informed about planned demining activities, the nature and duration of the tasks, and the exact locations of marked or cleared areas. Furthermore, it enables communities to inform local authorities and mine-action organizations about the location, extent and impact of contaminated areas. This information can greatly assist the planning of related activities, such as technical surveys, marking and clearance operations, and survivor-assistance services. Community liaison ensures that mine-action projects address community needs and priorities. Community liaison should be carried out by all organizations conducting mine-action operations. Community liaison services may begin far in advance of demining activities and help the development of local capacities to assess the risks, manage information and develop risk-reduction strategies.  Stockpile destruction  Iraqi army soldiers prepare for a controlled detonation of ordnance (Nov. 23, 2009 at Mahmudiyah). Stockpiled anti- personnel landmines (APM) far outnumber those actually laid in the ground. In accordance with Article 4 of the anti-personnel mine-ban treaty, State Parties that accede to the treaty must destroy their stockpiled mines within four years. Sixty-five countries have now destroyed their stockpiles of antipersonnel landmines, destroying a combined total of more than 37 million mines. Another 51 countries have officially declared that they do not have a stockpile and a further three countries are scheduled to destroy theirs by the end of the year. There are many options available to states in destroying their stockpiles. Stockpiles are usually destroyed by the military, but an industrial solution can also be employed. The techniques used vary depending on the make-up of the mines and the conditions in which they are found. = Laser cutting = Still in the research phase in the USA. = Microwave melt- out = This technology is also under development in the USA. It utilises microwaves to heat up TNT based explosive fillings. It is a rapid, clean technique but has one major disadvantage, the lack of control over heating can lead to the formation of \\"hot spots\\" with a resultant initiation of the filling. Work continues on its development, but it is not yet a feasible production technique. It is more energy efficient that steam and improves the value of any recovered explosives. = Destruction technology = \\"Silver II\\" An electro-chemical oxidation process. The organic waste is treated by the generation of highly oxidising species in an electro-chemical cell. The cell is separated into two compartments by a membrane that allows ion flow but prevents bulk mixing of the anolyte and catholyte. In the anolyte compartment a highly reactive species of silver ion attacks organic material ultimately converting it to CO2, H2O and non-toxic inorganic compounds. Biological degradation This technology has been demonstrated at the pilot level for the destruction of perchlorate contaminated aqueous streams. The potential exists for bacteria to be used to consume the explosive content of APM, converting it into inert material. It requires extensive storage capacity whilst bio-remediation is taking place and only has limited applications. There is also a requirement for an element of mechanical breakdown prior to the addition of the bacteria. Molten salt oxidation Only demonstrated at prototype scale. Can destroy finely divided and consistent organic waste, therefore significant pre-processing required. These wastes can be destroyed by incineration anyway. A purely technical solution, but too expensive and impracticable at the moment.  Mine victim assistance  Land mine victim in Mozambique. Mine victim assistance is a humanitarian effort which aims to organize a collaborative support for injured victims from mine and ERW as well as their families, thus enabling them to live normal lives. The approaches include physical rehabilitation, psychological support, and recovery of the victimized family and community. The work involves different level of actors, various organizations and State Parties who are obliged to perform the task under the Article 6 of the Mine Ban Treaty and Article 5 of the Convention on Cluster Munitions. United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) is another active participant cooperating with other actors under United Nations, recently presenting the 6-year plan according to mine action, \\"The Strategy of the United Nations on Mine Action 2013-2018\\".

His life encompassed the transition from Spanish colonial, to Mexican, and finally, American society.  Early life  Gonz√°lez Rubio was born in Guadalajara, New Spain, on June 6, 1804. His Spanish-born parents were Jos√© Mar√≠a Gonz√°lez Rubio and Manuela Guti√©rrez. He had at least two siblings. Upon completing his primary education, Gonz√°lez Rubio studied at the Seminario Conciliar of Guadalajara. He continued at the University of Guadalajara, where he graduated on July 20, 1820, with a degree in philosophy. In 1821, Mexico gained its independence from Spain. In 1824, he applied to the Colegio de Nuestra Se√±ora de Zapopan, seeking admission to the Franciscan Order. He began his novitiate and was accepted into the Order on January 10, 1825 with the religious name \\"Jos√© Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s\\" and the title of Fray (Friar).  Missions in California  On February 13, 1833, Gonz√°lez Rubio was named to replace Father Narciso Dur√°n at the Mission San Jos√© in California, consistent with a policy of replacing Spanish-born clergy with those born in Mexico. He arrived at the Mission two months later to begin his new duties. During his tenure, the Mexican government began to implement a policy to secularize the California missions. In 1842, Gonz√°lez Rubio was transferred to the Mission Santa Barbara, eventually becoming its chief administrator. He served as the Apostolic administrator of the Diocese of the Two Californias after Bishop Francisco Garcia Diego y Moreno's death in 1846 until bishop Joseph Alemany's appointment as Bishop of Monterey in 1850. Gonz√°lez Rubio continued to serve as the administrator of Mission Santa Barbara and came into conflict with the presiding bishop of the Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles, Bishop Thaddeus Amat, over the question of jurisdiction over the Mission. Gonz√°lez Rubio argued that the Mission was rightfully under the Franciscan order, not the diocese. During the dispute, the United States annexed California as a result of the Mexican American War. On March 18, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln restored the California missions to the Catholic Church. The deed to Mission Santa Barbara was given to the diocese, not the Franciscans. Gonz√°lez Rubio protested, but Bishop Amat refused to give up the deed to the Mission. However, in 1925, Bishop John J. Cantwell handed the deed over to the Franciscans at Mission Santa Barbara. Death Having lived long enough to become the oldest survivor of the early California missionaries, he died on November 2, 1875 at Mission Santa Barbara, where he is interred.

Dordrecht: Kluwer, 2003; S. 49.  History  In the early 1930s, under the influence of latinisation in the Soviet Union, a draft alphabet on a Latin basis was developed in the Mongolian People's Republic. This alphabet was used in several articles in the Ynen newspaper, but did not receive official status.The Latinization Attempt in Mongolia On February 1, 1941, Mongolia officially switched to a modified Latin alphabet, which was successfully used for some time to print books and newspapers. However, two months later, on March 25, this decision was canceled. According to official explanations, the adopted writing system was not well thought out: it did not cover all the sounds of the Mongolian language and was difficult to use. The adoption of the Cyrillic alphabet occurred almost simultaneously with the Cyrillization in the USSR, therefore, the rejection of the Latin alphabet could be due to political considerations. In the Mongolian version of the Latin alphabet, there were additional letters ‚Äú”©‚Äù, ‚Äú√ß‚Äù (‚Äú—á‚Äù), ‚Äú≈ü‚Äù (‚Äú—à‚Äù) and ∆∂ (‚Äú–∂‚Äù); \\"Y\\" corresponded to the Cyrillic \\"“Ø\\". \\"K\\" transliterated the sound that would later come to be represented in Cyrillic by \\"—Ö\\" in native Mongolian words. The letters f, h, p, v were rarely used except in Russian loanwords, and q, w, and x were almost never used. In 1975, preparations began for the romanization of Mongolian writing in China. According to the plan, the Latinized alphabet should have been introduced in 1977, but the death of Mao Zedong and the changes in domestic policy that had begun did not allow the project to materialize.http://www.zakon.kz/our/news/print.asp?id=10367 Although neither widely enforced nor maintains official status, Mongolians use the Latin alphabet in smartphones and social networking services on the onset of 2010s.  Characters  First Latin alphabet was using \\"y\\" as feminine \\"u\\", with additional feminine \\"o\\" (\\"”©\\") and with additional consonants \\"√ß\\" for \\"ch\\", \\"≈ü\\" for \\"sh\\" and \\"∆∂\\" for \\"j\\", it successfully served in printing books and newspapers. A few of the letters (f, k, p, v) were rarely used, being found only in borrowings, while q, w and x were excluded altogether. Since k transcribed in loans, it is unclear how loans in were written. \\"j\\" is used for vowel combinations of the [ja] type. Letter \\"c\\" is used for the sound [ts] and \\"k\\" is used for the sound [h]. The first version was inspired by the Yanalif script used for the Soviet Union's Turkic languages. The second version of Latin alphabet made few minor changes to make the way it works to look more familiar to European languages. That change was including replacement of \\"y\\" by \\"√º\\", \\"”©\\" by \\"√∂\\", \\"∆∂\\" by \\"j\\", \\"j\\" by \\"y\\" and also \\"k\\" by \\"x\\" in native words. Also reduced the number of letters in the alphabet by erasing \\"√ß\\" \\"≈ü\\" and write them as a combination of ch and sh. And the rest of the alphabet and orthography kept same. = List of characters = {class=\\"wikitable Unicode\\" style=\\"text-align: center\\" ! colspan=\\"2\\" IPA ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Mongolian            colspan=\\"2\\"  colspan=\\"2\\"   - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Latin !1931 - 1939 A E IOU”® YNMLBPF colspan=\\"2\\" KGS ≈û TDC √á Z∆µJRH - !1939 - 1941 A E I O U √ñ √ú N M L B P F K X G S Sh T D C Ch Z J Y R H - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Cyrillic –ê –≠ –ò –û –£ ”® “Æ –ù –ú –õ –í –ü –§ –ö –• –ì –° –® –¢ –î –¶ –ß –ó –ñ –ô –† –• } The unaspirated stops are often realized as voiced .

It preserves short final vowels. It does not drop unstressed vowels in the closing syllables when the word is conjugated. The suffixes and inflections without long or i-coupled vowels are made open syllables ending with a vowel, which is harmonized with the stressed vowel. The rule for the vowel harmony for unstressed vowels is similar to that of the Mongolian Cyrillic. It does not use consonant combinations to denote new consonant sounds. For both of the version, letter \\"b\\" is used both in the beginning and in the middle of the word. Because it phonetically assimilates into sound , no ambiguity is caused.

This leads to her gaining contact with Rebecca again. Jill Marsden Detective Chief Inspector Jill Marsden is played by Sophie Stanton. She makes her first appearance on 5 March 2001, when she investigates who shot Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) which is part of the whodunit storyline, Who Shot Phil?. She returns in 2002 and 2003, and returns again in 2009 for another whodunit storyline, Who Killed Archie? and returns again on 5 January 2012 for her third whodunnit storyline, 'Who's Stalking Phil?'. When brought back in 2009, Marsden feelings are further explored in a segment of the BBC EastEnders homepage entitled 'Marsden's Video Diaries', documenting the character's thoughts on the storyline she is involved in. Marsden's relationship with Phil has been explored since her first appearance, the BBC describing their relationship as \\"romance in negative\\" and \\"Her ultimate dream is that some day she'll get [Phil]‚Ä¶ behind bars.\\" DS Burton DS Burton, played by Cyril Nri, is a policeman who assisted his fellow chief detective Jill Marsden (Sophie Stanton) with investigating the shooting of Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) ‚Äî the criminal hardman of Albert Square, a local community of the fictionalized borough Walford in East London. The events of Phil's shooting occurred on 1 March 2001 after he antagonized several of his neighbors and fellow residents by the time his archenemy, Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), had married his wife Mel Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite) ‚Äî who had a one-night stand with Phil on Christmas Day 2000. At the point where DS Burton joined Marsden in questioning Steve and Mel over Phil's shooting, he encountered Phil's cousin Billy (Perry Fenwick) and grew curious with his belief over the identity of two other suspected assailants; Phil's stepson Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and love rival Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) over different reasons. Nonetheless, Steve was implicated as the prime suspect. However, it was soon revealed over a month after Phil's shooting that the assailant was in fact his ex-girlfriend Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin). After gradually forgiving Lisa for the incident, Phil decided to frame his fellow nemesis Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass) for the crime ‚Äî after Dan tried to extort money from Phil and his godson Jamie (Jack Ryder). His plan to do so was first halted when DS Burton visited Phil at his house to try and get information on who shot him, but Phil stalled him by claiming to have no idea about his shooter. Once DS Burton left the house, Phil contacted Dan's old crime boss Ritchie Stringer (Gareth Hunt) and they hatched a plot to incriminate Dan behind the shooting. Later on that night, Phil phoned DS Burton ‚Äî telling him that Dan was the shooter and planning to finish him off for good. By the time Dan threatened to shoot Phil and extort money from him and Jamie again, DS Burton and his fellow police unit rushed over to the scene and were on stand-by to take charge of the situation. Their presence alerted Dan, and he was consequently arrested; DS Burton and Marsden later charged Dan for Phil's shooting. Ritchie Stringer Ritchie Stringer, played by Gareth Hunt, is a mob boss who knows Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). He first appears in April 2001 when Phil contacts him to request a favor; conspiring with Phil against their mutual acquaintance, Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass). It transpires that Dan had worked for Ritchie in the past, and so he does not suspect anything untoward when Ritchie provides him with a gun to do a raid on Phil. However, it is all part of Phil's plan, and Dan is caught by the police in the middle of the armed robbery. It soon becomes clear that the gun Ritchie had given Dan is the same gun that was used to shoot Phil, even though Dan never shot Phil and the gun itself had belonged to their common nemesis Steve Owen (Martin Kemp); earlier on, it was revealed that the shooter was in fact Phil's ex-girlfriend Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin). Nonetheless, Dan is consequently blamed for the shooting when Phil confirmed this to the police without exposing Ritchie's involvement behind the crime. Ritchie Stringer was 10/3 at Ladbrokes bookmakers as the culprit in the \\"Who Shot Phil?\\" storyline, despite not being one of the named suspects.\\"Gareth will have you hooked?\\", BBC. Retrieved 14 March 2007. When the BBC announced that actor Gareth Hunt was appearing in EastEnders, there was a massive betting flurry on Ritchie being the culprit. Bookmakers William Hill even \\"closed the book\\". William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe commented that there were \\"dozens of calls\\" within half an hour of a 16/1 price being quoted and the bookmakers had nearly been \\"knocked over in the rush of punters wanting to place bets of hundreds of pounds on the actor\\".\\"Betting flurry on EastEnders killing\\", BBC. Retrieved 14 March 2007. William Hill decided to reopen the book later in the week after \\"information from unofficial BBC sources had convinced them that [Gareth Hunt's] character [was] not the killer.\\"\\"Hunt 'ruled out' of EastEnders shooting\\", BBC. Retrieved 14 March 2007. Paul Trueman Paul Trueman, played by Gary Beadle, appears between 2001 and 2004. Paul is introduced as part of the already established Trueman family. He is portrayed as a bad boy. Beadle left the role in 2004, following a suspension, reportedly for failing to learn his lines. In his exit storyline, Paul becomes a drug dealer, and Beadle has been critical of the storyline, suggesting it played into black, racial stereotyping. It is implied that Paul is killed upon his exit, though his death is not screened. Donna Andrews Donna Andrews, played by Allison Senior (2001) and Paula Jennings (2001‚Äì2002), is the mistress of Trevor Morgan (Alex Ferns), who first appears on 24 April 2001. Donna first appears when Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) spots her and Trevor entering Donna's house. A few days later, after much agonising over whether to tell Little Mo Morgan (Kacey Ainsworth), Trevor's wife, Billy takes Little Mo to see for herself. On 28 August, Little Mo's sisters, Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) and Lynne Hobbs (Elaine Lordan), reveal that Donna is pregnant with Trevor's baby. Little Mo visits Donna several days later, and is urged by her not to let Trevor hurt her any more. The following summer, Donna appears at Little Mo's trial for assaulting Trevor with an iron and gives evidence against Trevor. This proves fruitless as Little Mo is found guilty and given a prison sentence, although her conviction for attempted murder is quashed on appeal and she is released from prison within weeks of the verdict. Donna next appears in October, when Trevor forces his way into her home in Swindon, attacks her and kidnaps their son, Sean. On his return to Walford, Trevor also captures Little Mo and attempts to kill them all in a house fire, only for Little Mo and Sean to be rescued, but Trevor and local fireman Tom Banks (Colm √ì Maonla√≠) die in the resulting explosion, leaving Donna feeling Little Mo should be grieving for Tom, rather than Trevor. Donna makes her last appearance on 8 November, a week after Trevor's death. Harry Slater Harry Slater, played by Michael Elphick, is the younger brother of Charlie Slater (Derek Martin). Dale Hayes portrays Harry in a flashback on 25 December 2018. It transpires that Harry groomed his niece Kat (Jessie Wallace) as a child and it is later revealed that he had raped her when she was 13 years old, thus making Kat pregnant with their daughter Zoe (Michelle Ryan) and son Dermott Dolan (Ois√≠n Stack). Zoe is initially presented as Kat's sister but she is in fact Kat and Harry's daughter. Charlie didn't know the father was Harry so he decided to raise Zoe as his own daughter and Kat had to become her sister. Harry fled to Spain soon after the incident and didn't reappear until the death of his sister Violet - in 1988. After Violet's funeral, Harry quickly left again. =Storylines= Harry arrives in Walford to visit his older brother, Charlie. Most of the family welcome him, but Kat leaves the room without explanation whenever Harry enters. He starts a relationship with Charlie's close friend Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), and they soon get engaged and Peggy plans to emigrate to Spain, where Harry lives. Zoe announces that she is going with Harry to Spain but a furious Kat refuses to let her go. Zoe storms out saying she's leaving and Kat follows. The two argue and Kat shouts that she is her mother. When Zoe demands that Kat tell her who her real father is, Kat shocks her by revealing that it's Harry. Zoe tells Charlie as he was under the impression that Zoe's birth father was a boy Kat had gone to school with. He goes to find Harry and attacks him in The Queen Victoria public house, but is restrained by the punters. Charlie tells Harry to leave Walford and that if he ever sees him again he will kill him. He also tells him to end his relationship with Peggy and he does so by writing her a letter. Harry tells Charlie he is ashamed of his actions and that it's ruined his life. He admits that Charlie's late wife Viv (April Martin) knew what happened and told him to leave, ruining Charlie's idealised image of Viv in the process. He goes to shake Charlie's hand to say goodbye, but Charlie - disgusted by him - spits in his face and calls him a monster. Kat confronts Harry and he says she must hate him. She denies that she hates him but just thinks he's a pervert. Kat reveals that she got pregnant and that Zoe is the child. She says that Zoe hates him for what he did to her. Harry calls Kat a bitch and leaves in a taxi. Kat later attempts suicide, but is found in the park by Zoe and rushed to hospital. The following year, Charlie receives news that Harry has died from a heart attack in Spain. Harry leaves Zoe ¬£18,000 in his will, but when Zoe sees how much the idea of taking anything from Harry is upsetting Kat, she burns the cheque - saying she doesn't need his money. In January 2015, Mo receives a cheque from Harry's will for ¬£19,500 to Kat and gives it to her. Kat is upset but refuses to mention it to anyone. After Alfie tells her to consider using the cheque to make a fresh start for their children, she ponders it and later tears up the cheque in front of Alfie. It later emerges that Harry had abused other young people when Kat is visited by a compensation lawyer requesting her to give a statement. In May 2015, Kat visits the convent where she give birth to Zoe and it is revealed to the viewers that Kat had twins ‚Äì meaning Harry has another child. Later that same day, the nun who had helped Kat when she gave birth gives her advice which culminates in Kat finally giving the police a statement on Harry. In 2015, it is revealed that Zoe is a twin and Kat also gave birth to a son, who was secretly adopted. Gary Bolton Gary Bolton, played by Bruce Byron, is the biological father of Robbie Jackson (Dean Gaffney), who appears in three episodes between 17 May and 10 July 2001. Gary lived with Robbie's mother, Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson), as her boyfriend, and her daughter Bianca (Patsy Palmer) until a year after Robbie's birth. When David Wicks (Michael French) is revealed as Bianca's father in 1994, Carol tells Robbie she had left his father because he was having relationships with under- age girls; however, this is retconned when the character appears on-screen for the first time in 2001. He tries to get in touch with Robbie on his eighteenth birthday by phoning Carol's father Jim Branning (John Bardon), but Jim refuses to give Gary Carol's number. In May 2001, Robbie and his half sister Sonia (Natalie Cassidy) go to Portsmouth to find Gary. They find his number when they see an advert for a builder called G. Bolton. When they go to his house, Gary gives Robbie a present he has saved from his first birthday and a cheque to make up for \\"backdated pocket money\\". Robbie then meets his half brother, Gary's son Kevin (Rupert Hill), and when he realises that Gary had left Carol to be with Kevin's mother, he throws the cheque back at Gary and leaves. In June, Gary arrives in Walford to talk to Robbie. He tells Robbie he will pay for him to go to college, but Jim tells him to leave. Later, in July, Gary returns to Walford and is happy to see old friend Mo Harris (Laila Morse). Gary and Mo spend the day reminiscing in The Queen Victoria pub, and when Robbie comes in, Gary gives him a cheque for ¬£10,000. This is the last time Gary is seen.

Margaret is not perturbed and vows to beat Janine at her own game, leading to numerous squabbles. When Janine discovers a photo of Margaret and another man, she immediately assumes the worst and informs Terry that Margaret is cheating on him. Margaret explains that the man in the photo is her brother, David Walker (Michael Fenner) who is dying of cancer and she is paying for his placement in a drug trial in America. After continued hostility, Margaret tries to persuade Terry to throw Janine out, and he eventually gives in and arranges for Janine to move into one of his bedsits. Janine is aware of Terry's paternal feelings towards her, and she begins using emotional blackmail to manipulate him. Margaret eventually grows tired of all the game playing and so she and Terry book a trip to Paris to spend some time alone together. Janine is furious and Margaret goads her further by telling her that she plans to propose to Terry while they are away. To prevent this, Janine goes to Margaret's property to steal Terry's passport, and whilst there she witnesses Margaret kissing her supposed brother goodbye. Janine becomes suspicious and when Terry tells her that he is planning to give Margaret ¬£10,000 to help her brother, David ( she tells him that Margaret is conning him and informs him about the kiss she'd witnessed.

She puts him into a taxi and tells him that he is all that matters to her. Although sources prior to the filming of this storyline had suggested that Margaret would be a sophisticated conwoman,\\"EastEnders welcomes George\\", BBC. Retrieved 11 July 2007. this is never actually confirmed on-screen.

Retrieved 11 July 2007. Angel Hudson Angel Hudson, played by Goldie, is a gold-toothed gangster who is first seen in June 2001 when he attends a poker game that Steve Owen (Martin Kemp) is holding. His appearance is a huge shock to one of the other gamblers, Paul Trueman (Gary Beadle), and it is soon clear that they have unresolved issues. Later, during a break from the game, Angel tells Paul that he wants what he is owed: ¬£30,000. He tells Paul that he has a week to pay up or he will make sure he disappears for good. Goldie (pictured) portrayed Angel Hudson from 2001 until 2002. Paul tries to get the money by stealing property from his mother, Audrey Trueman (Corinne Skinner-Carter), pawning the goods and gambling the money he receives. This fails and he ends up with less money than he began with. At the end of the week, Angel comes to collect his money, and when Paul fails to pay, Angel gives him a severe beating and trashes his mother's bed and breakfast. After more threats from Angel, Paul blackmails his brother, Anthony Trueman (Nicholas R. Bailey), into giving him the money. Anthony is the local GP, a respectable man with a worthy profession, but he has a dark secret. When he was 15 years old, after a heavy drinking session, Anthony had driven a car, hit a pedestrian and then left the scene. Not wanting to ruin his brother's chance of a successful career, Paul took the blame and subsequently served 18 months in prison. Paul threatens to tell their mother the truth unless Anthony gives him the money he needs. Anthony feels he has no choice but to oblige, so he takes out a loan and Paul pays Angel. Satisfied, Angel leaves, but tells Paul they will meet again. Angel returns in June 2002 with more orders for Paul. Angel is soon to stand trial for murder and is using his wife, Precious Hudson (Judi Shekoni), as a fake alibi. He wants Paul to guard her until she can testify. Paul obliges and Precious moves to Albert Square. Paul is initially unaware that Precious is Angel's wife, so when she sets about seducing him, he has no qualms about having sex with her. When he discovers the truth, he is terrified of what Angel will do if he finds out. However, Precious does a runner, leaving Paul to face a furious Angel. Paul goes to get Precious back, while Angel holds his father, Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker), and his brother's girlfriend, Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan), hostage. Luckily, Paul persuades Precious to return before Angel does any real harm. Their affair continues and it soon blossoms into love. Later in the month, the family of the man that Angel had killed, tries to silence Precious by placing a bomb under her car. Garry Hobbs (Ricky Groves) receives minor injuries but, furious, Precious tells Angel she will only provide his alibi if he promises to divorce her. Angel agrees but, days later, Precious is kidnapped by the victim's family. They convince her that Angel will never let her go and that the only way to be rid of him is to get him locked up. Precious agrees and at the trial, denies being with Angel at the time of the murder. Precious assumes that this will be enough to put Angel away, but is shocked when he is found not guilty. Paul and Precious decide to leave the country. However, Angel catches up with Precious before she can get away. He tells her that her betrayal doesn't bother him enough to kill her and that she can have her divorce on one condition ‚Äì she stays away from Paul. If he ever finds out she and Paul are together, he promises to kill them both. Precious has no choice but to finish with Paul and leave Walford alone. Angel's last appearance is in July 2002. Patrick Trueman Patrick Trueman, played by Rudolph Walker, makes his first appearance on 13 September 2001. The character was introduced by John Yorke as a replacement parental figure to the Trueman brothers, Anthony (Nick Bailey) and Paul (Gary Beadle), following the departure of Audrey Trueman (Corinne Skinner-Carter), a character killed off in the serial in September 2001. Patrick first appears at Audrey's \\"rum-fuelled wake\\" as her estranged husband. Walker was keen to play a comic element to the character, telling Larry Jaffee of Walford Gazette, \\"Before joining, I told the producer [comedy] is an area I would like to explore [with the character] because there was not enough of it [in the show]. [Patrick] treats a lot of things with a certain amount of humour. His way of escaping a problem is to find something funny to do or say or sometimes to get himself out of a tight corner. That's really the sort of foundation. I try to put as much humour as possible into the character.\\" Belinda Peacock Belinda Peacock (also Slater), portrayed by Leanne Lakey between 2001 and 2003 and Carli Norris in 2016, is introduced as the fifth Slater sister following the family's introduction in 2000. Additionally, the character also appears as a baby in a flashback on 25 December 2018. Belinda is the second youngest Slater sister and rejects her working-class roots, believing herself to be superior to her sisters, although she is not as classy as she makes out.

Norris thanked her fans and added that she \\"loved\\" the role and hoped \\"to be back one day\\". Carli Norris portrayed Belinda in 2016. =Storylines= Belinda is married to Neville Peacock (Gary Webster) who is wealthy and Belinda frequently brags about this to her sisters. She wears a blonde wig and speaks in an exaggerated accent, but reveals her true self at Lynne's hen night under the influence of alcohol. Belinda usually turns up in Albert Square when she is having marriage problems. She has brief flings with Jamie Mitchell (Jack Ryder) and her brother-in-law Garry Hobbs (Ricky Groves). Although Belinda resides in Kent, within driving distance of Walford, she makes great use of her villa in Lanzarote. She often holidays there and her grandmother Mo Harris (Laila Morse) frequently visits, although Belinda often lets down her father Charlie. Belinda is mentioned 2008 when she promises Charlie that she is returning to spend some time with him, only then to cancel, leaving Charlie very upset. Belinda also makes a small cameo appearance in the DVD spin-off Slaters in Detention, where she is arrested after Charlie says she is the only normal daughter he has, but sees Belinda at the station and withdraws the remark. She is mentioned in December 2012 by her sister, Kat, when Mo and Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) take Kat's son Tommy Moon to visit her, and in February 2014 when Kat tells her husband Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) that she was with Belinda while she was actually trying to track down Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner). Belinda returns in January 2016 after Charlie dies of a heart attack, and accuses Kat of killing him as she was arguing with him when he died. An explosive argument then ensues between Belinda and Kat over Charlie and Mo, which leads to Kat revealing that she had another son when she gave birth to Zoe, and that Mo knew about him. Belinda believes that Kat is just making excuses and leaves with Mo. Belinda returns later in January for Charlie's funeral, and eventually manages to make amends with Kat. However, when she makes a thoughtless comment about Stacey, who is suffering from postpartum psychosis, Kat throws a drink over Belinda and then storms off. Belinda catches up with her, and recalls the time when she, Viv, Little Mo and Zoe visited Ireland and saw Viv visit a couple with a boy; Kat realises that was in fact her son. When Stacey is discharged from the mother and baby unit, she arranges a family lunch and invites Belinda, Jean and Jean's new husband Ollie Walters (Tony O'Callaghan). Belinda learns that her cousin Kyle Slater (Riley Carter Millington) is transgender and when Jean is convinced Kyle is lying, Belinda encourages Stacey to stand up to her. Belinda then tells Stacey and Martin they will have to move out as Kat and Alfie promised to pay their rent for a year, which has now ended. Belinda visits Stacey and Buster Briggs' (Karl Howman) realises she is wealthy. He gets her address by offering a fish delivery and later goes with his grandson Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) to her house to steal her koi carp. Lee tells his father Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) where they are, so Mick stops them and returns the fish as Belinda returns home and sees him through her window. The next day, Belinda visits the Carters and invites Mick and his wife Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) to her house for dinner; when they get there, Neville makes it clear to Mick that the couple are into swinging and will not allow Mick to refuse because they have CCTV footage of him in their garden. Mick tells Linda this, so she confronts Neville, accusing him of not having real intimacy in his relationship and wanting power over women. Belinda realises this is true so leaves with Mick and Linda, revealing Neville's CCTV cameras are fake. Neville follows them to Walford, where Belinda ends their relationship because she does not feel loved. He insults her and Mick punches him, forcing him to leave. Belinda then moves in with Stacey, Martin and Kyle. Neville gives Belinda ¬£50,000 as a divorce settlement and she uses the money to open a beauty salon. In August 2016, Belinda flirts with Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp), much to the annoyance of his daughter Courtney Mitchell (Alice Nokes). They meet again and they later head to Belinda's flat to have sex, but are interrupted by her family. Stacey later discovers that Belinda's new beauty business, Elysium, is severely struggling financially after all of Neville's money was used to set it up. Due to Belinda's money being relied on to pay the rent monthly, Stacey's husband Martin Fowler (James Bye) rages at Belinda, ordering her to find the money. Belinda resorts to attempting to prostitute herself to wealthier men, however after joining forces with Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa) to help her reduce costs and advertise through social media, Belinda eventually manages to find the rent money. Belinda begins a relationship with Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra), although he initially fears she is after his money and they have sex. However the relationship doesn't last when Belinda asks Masood to call his ex-wife Zainab Masood (Nina Wadia) who is in the process of a divorce. Belinda finds an old card from her schoolfriend Maggie O'Shea (Zee Asha) who has recently been through a divorce and contacts her. They both come to a conclusion they should start a new life with their newfound freedom by travelling around Italy and they both leave Walford together. Viv Slater Viv Slater is the late wife of Charlie Slater (Derek Martin), portrayed by Debi Gibson. Viv appears in her daughter Kat Slater's (Jessie Wallace) flashbacks in a near-death sequence when Kat attempts suicide. Additionally, Laura Curnick portrays Viv in a flashback on 25 December 2018 and Natasya Rush portrayed her as a child in the spin-off episode EastEnders: Pat and Mo. Viv's parents are Mo Harris (Laila Morse) and Stuart Mullins, and is the result of a one-night stand; she is brought up by Mo and stepfather Jimmy Harris (Alex King), with little contact with her father. After leaving school at 15, Viv meets Charlie Slater at a dance. They began dating and get engaged. After losing her virginity to Charlie, Viv becomes pregnant at 16. Mo, believing Charlie will not want to marry her, tries to force her to have an abortion; however, Charlie proves supportive and Viv gives birth to daughter Lynne (Elaine Lordan). Charlie and Viv marry and Viv goes on to have three more daughters: Kat, Belinda (Leanne Lakey/Carli Norris), and Little Mo (Kacey Ainsworth). As the girls are growing up, Viv becomes a hard, bitter, cold woman. With the death of her stepfather Jimmy, she has no fatherly guidance and resents the fact that she has no sons. She favours her oldest daughter Lynne, whilst Kat, Belinda, and Little Mo all vie for Charlie's attention, making Viv feel second-best to her daughters. When Viv catches 13-year-old daughter Kat trying to run away, it emerges that Kat was raped by her uncle Harry (Michael Elphick) and is pregnant. When Kat says Harry raped her, Viv pretends not to believe her, then secretly orders Harry to leave and he flees to Spain. She then sends Belinda and Little Mo to live with Charlie's sister, Violet, to hide Kat's pregnancy. When Kat's daughter Zoe (Michelle Ryan) is born, Viv decides to raise Zoe as her and Charlie's youngest daughter. Viv dotes on Zoe but continues to treat her own daughters with contempt; although they loyally stick by her, they come to resent her harsh discipline. Eventually, Viv suffers a stroke and is nursed mostly by Charlie and Little Mo. She manages to make amends with all of her daughters before she dies at the age of 48. In May 2015, it is revealed that Zoe is a twin and Viv had Kat's son adopted. Kat learns the truth: as Kat had passed out during Zoe's birth, Kat did not know about her son. Viv decided they could not pass off both being hers and she called for Mo to help. She did not tell Kat and only took Zoe so the boy did not become like his father, Harry. Louise Mitchell Louise Mitchell (also Fowler), played by Rachel Cox from 2001 to 2003, Danni Bennatar in 2008, Brittany Papple in 2010 and Tilly Keeper since 2016, is a member of the Mitchell family and briefly part of the Fowler family. She is the daughter of Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) and Lisa Fowler (Lucy Benjamin), stepdaughter of Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), granddaughter of Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor) and the half-sister of Ben Mitchell (Charlie Jones, Harry Reid). Louise's early storylines include Lisa lying about her paternity, her being caught up in her parent's relationship and her feud with Ben and him physically torturing her. Since her return in 2016, Louise's storylines have included her blackmailing Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) over her fake pregnancy, the death of Peggy, forming a friendship with Bex Fowler (Jasmine Armfield) and bullying Bex with as well as being the victim of bullying by Alexandra D'Costa (Sydney Craven) and Madison Drake (Seraphina Beh). Lisa returned after the prom disaster, where Louise suffered burns. Louise's storylines have also included relationships with Travis Law-Hughes (Alex James-Phelps) and Hunter Owen (Charlie Winter). Nathan Williams Nathan Williams is a character played by Doug Allen. The character was axed after 6 months, reportedly because of Allen's failure to learn his lines adequately.soap gossip Nathan is the illegitimate son of Roy Evans (Tony Caunter), born, unbeknownst to Roy, out of an extramarital affair with his former employee Jane Williams (Ann Mitchell). Nathan makes his first appearance in Albert Square in 2001, after his mother, who is terminally ill with cancer, confesses to Roy that Nathan is actually his son. Nathan initially refuses Roy's attempts to get to know him. However, after Jane dies (on the same day that Roy's grandson Jack was born), Nathan is left penniless with a bankrupt business, so he begrudgingly turns to Roy for help. Soon after, he moves in with the Evanses, much to the annoyance of Roy's other son Barry (Shaun Williamson), who resents Nathan and is furious with his father for betraying his dead mother. It also becomes clear that Nathan equally dislikes Barry and resents the fact that he had known and been brought up by his father, whilst he has only just met him. The pair spend much time winding each other up, with Barry usually ending up looking the fool. Nathan quickly integrates into life in Albert Square, growing closer to his father and having a brief relationship with Walford resident Mel Owen (Tamzin Outhwaite). He starts working in the car lot with Roy, whilst Barry stays at home playing at house-husband and looking after his son Jack. Barry resents him even more for this and feels that Nathan is taking over his role as dutiful son. It seems as if Nathan can do no wrong, but it is the petty jealousy and sibling rivalry between him and Barry that is eventually his undoing. In an attempt to exclude Barry and take his place in his father's heart, Nathan makes a plan to set Barry up and steal the affections of Barry's wife Natalie (Lucy Speed). His first advancement towards Natalie results in the pair kissing, but Natalie is adamant that it will go no further and despite further flirtations from Nathan, their kiss is a one-off occurrence. Undeterred, Nathan continues with his plan. Aware of Barry's past monetary blunders, and knowing that any subsequent mistakes will not be tolerated by Roy, Nathan steals money from the car-lot and sets Barry up for the blame. The plan seems to be working, until Natalie pieces it together and uncovers his ploy. With Nathan's true character unveiled, Roy decides that he wants nothing more to do with him and Nathan is banished from Albert Square in mid-2002. Nita Mistry Nita Mistry, played by Bindya Solanki, first appears in the episode originally broadcast on 5 November 2001. She is introduced as a love interest for Robbie Jackson (Dean Gaffney). The character was written out of the series with Robbie in 2003. In a press report, executive-producer Louise Berridge commented \\"Dean and Bindya have contributed an enormous amount to the programme. However, we feel that the characters have reached the end of their natural course in the show, and they will both be leaving in Spring 2003. [...] It is always sad to be saying goodbye to a good double act, so we will be leaving the door open for both characters\\". On 28 May 2019, it was announced that Solanki had reprised the role for one episode, and Nita returned on 13 June 2019. When Nita arrives, she is a single mother to Anish Mistry (Ali Zahoor) and a widow. She gets a job at the local shop, the Minute Mart, and becomes involved in the community theatre, where she meets Robbie.

Nita, Robbie and Anish leave for India. In February 2010, Robbie returns for his sister Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer)'s wedding and reveals that Nita is six months pregnant. Nita later gives birth to a boy, Sami Jackson (Shiven Shankar) who appears in Walford in September 2015 with Robbie. Robbie reveals that he and Nita have separated. Three years later, Robbie visits Nita and Sami, returning with his son. He ignores phone calls and messages from Nita, so she returns to Walford to collect Sami. When Robbie barricades himself and Sami inside his flat, Nita threatens to call the police, but Robbie's sister, Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy), persuades her not to. Robbie then unlocks the door and returns Sami to Nita. After saying goodbye, they leave again.

It was brilliant to work with some old friends again, especially those who I only briefly got to work with before.\\" He returned from 15 November to 29 December 2016 and again on 23 March 2017. It was announced on 17 December 2017 that Lavender would not be returning to the show. Ian Lavender appeared as Derek Harkinson between 2001 and 2005, before reprising the role in 2016 and 2017. Derek, a childhood friend of Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard), reappears in her life through her involvement in the Community Theatre. Pauline makes a play for him but he reveals he is gay.

Derek and Kathy meet again at Geraldine Clough's (Gwyneth Strong) play rehearsal and Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker) introduces them to each other. Derek and Kathy are both cast as a pantomime horse in the Christmas play, and he sides with Kathy when Geraldine asks who should be the director. Derek is overjoyed at the prospect of directing the play but during rehearsals, he is forced to reprimand Dennis Rickman Jnr (Bleu Landau) for watching Louise Mitchell (Tilly Keeper) and other girls undress. Much to Derek's disappointment, the first night of the performance isn't successful, after which, all the residents refuse to do the play any more. They eventually agree and the following performances are a success. After the show, Patrick fears that Derek fancies him and he feels uncomfortable when Derek invites him to stay with him and Alex. Patrick says he will think about it and Derek leaves Walford. Derek returns a few months later to help Denise Fox (Diane Parish) with a meeting in the community centre. Derek and Denise organise an Easter fair and he tries to get Carmel and Denise talking again after they fall out.

When Derek confronts shoplifter Keegan Baker (Zack Morris), Honey is pleased to have him working at the shop. While talking with Honey, Derek reveals that he has been chosen as the new face of the Minute Mart. Yolande Trueman (Angela Wynter) then visits and asks to speak with Derek and she informs him that he could lose his job and be kicked out of the back to work programme for failing to disclose his criminal record. Derek has another run-in with Keegan when he tries to steal a magazine and Keegan throws the magazine at Derek and calls him a queer. When Honey leaves Derek in charge of the shop Yolande calls and tells him that he is sacked. Upset, Derek lashes out at Johnny Carter (Ted Reilly) and berates him for not standing up to Keegan and tells him about the struggles of being a gay man while it was illegal. Johnny tracks Derek down at his flat and questions why he quit at the Minute Mart. Derek explains that he has a conviction that he failed to disclose from when he was younger as he had a boyfriend who was twenty, which was below the age of consent for homosexuals and that he was arrested and imprisoned for nine months.

Some days later, Zoe's mother, Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) comes looking for Zoe along with Anthony Trueman (Nicholas Bailey). They find her and try to take Zoe home, but Roxy tries to prevent Kat taking Zoe. This leads to Kat headbutting Roxy in the face. A humiliated Roxy then gets in her car and drives away, and has not been seen since. Kelly Taylor Kelly Taylor, played by Brooke Kinsella, was introduced by executive producer John Yorke, in 2001. She was only due to appear in eight episodes as part of a prostitution/homelessness storyline featuring Michelle Ryan's established character, Zoe Slater, who runs away from home in late 2001 and lives at the same brothel as Kelly. However, the viewer response to Kelly was positive, so she was reintroduced as a regular at the end of 2002. The character remained in the serial until 2004, when executive producer Louise Berridge decided that her storylines had come to a natural end. In the past, Kinsella had auditioned for the parts of Janine Butcher, Zoe Slater and Sonia Fowler, but had been unsuccessful. Kinsella has commented, \\"I went up for the part of every girl in the Square. I was closest to getting the part of Zoe. I did workshops with all the Slater girls but you have to say they are all dark and look very alike while I'm blonde. Obviously that wasn't the right one for me. It was hard at the time but I'm very glad because I love playing Kelly. She's totally different from any other character and she's good fun to play.\\" Tom Stuart The Reverend Tom Stuart is a recurring character, played by Shaun Dooley.

She refuses to press charges so they cannot arrest him, and they have to leave, deflated. Price appears again in May 2003 when Kate returns to work and is asked to choose between her job and Phil. She chooses to resign, and asks Price for one last favour as a leaving present: to get George Peters (Andy Beckwith) arrested for dealing cocaine. George is a heavy employed by Jack Dalton (Hywel Bennett), who had been sent to rape Kate. Price and Marsden later appear in November 2003, when Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) and his son Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) set Phil up for armed robbery; this time they are successful in convicting him, keeping him in custody until his case collapses in 2005. In late 2004, an off-duty Price visits Kate, now running a salon, and she tells him she is bored of her career. He finds her another job in the police, based in Brighton, which causes her to leave Walford the next day.

His storylines involve his difficult past and childhood, relationship with his infamous father, Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), clashes with the rival Mitchell family, and a forbidden romance with his adopted sister, Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean).

A divorc√©e, she has three sons, now grown up; two are in the army and the other lives in New Zealand. She works at the Walford Bookies and lives with her cat, Boots, at 89a George Street. Dan Ferreira (Dalip Tahil) needs a date for an upcoming wedding, so he asks Shirley and she agrees. Dan tells Shirley that his wife, Pushpa (Madhur Jaffrey), is dead, when they have only separated, following Pushpa's infidelity. At the wedding, everyone is enjoying the day until Pushpa introduces herself to Shirley. She is mortified to discover Dan's lies, telling him that her ex-husband was a liar and she is not prepared to put up with lying again. She also tells Dan that she wants nothing more to do with him. In August that year, Shirley has problems with her new neighbour, Gavin Sharp (Steve Nicolson). He lives in the flat above hers and plays extremely loud music at all hours, meaning Shirley cannot sleep. She tries reasoning with him several times but he laughs at her, only playing his music louder, so she complains to the council. Maddened, Gavin threatens to make her life a misery as payback. Days later, Shirley's cat disappears and Shirley fears that Gavin is responsible. Whilst Dan confronts Gavin about Boots, Little Mo (Kacey Ainsworth) walks into The Queen Victoria pub, cuddling Boots. Shirley rewards her with money but later that day, Shirley finds Boots on her doorstep ‚Äì dead in a plastic bin bag. Shirley turns to the Ferreiras for help, and Dan confronts Gavin again. Gavin denies killing Boots and says that he found her lying dead in the road and left her on Shirley's doorstep so she could bury her. Shirley, however, is not convinced. Gavin's taunting continues when he puts her telephone number on a card, advertising her as a prostitute, and distributes it across Walford. Later, while she is at work, Gavin breaks into her flat and tips rotten rubbish all over the floor. Shirley is distraught, and seeing her angst, Ash Ferreira (Raji James), decides to help. He plays Gavin at his own game, borrowing his brother's amplifier and speakers and playing dance music extremely loudly. He then breaks into Gavin's flat and lets a rat loose. Gavin is petrified of rats and when he discovers it, he agrees to call a truce if they remove it. The saga brings Ash and Shirley closer together and it is not long before they start a relationship. Ash wants to keep it a secret because he knows his father will be furious if he finds out. Shirley begins to get irritated with Ash's inability to tell Dan, particularly when Dan tries to woo Shirley for a second time. Ash explains that he had been a compulsive gambler, and Dan had bailed him out of serious financial difficulties after he lost his house and his wife. He owes his father everything and is unwilling to hurt him. However, when Dan tries kissing Shirley she told him that she is with his son, Ash. This revelation causes huge rows at the Ferreiras' and although Ash loves Shirley, he feels he has no choice but to finish with her to keep the peace. In February 2004, Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs) takes over the bookies where Shirley works. Shirley does not like the way Andy runs things and after she complains repeatedly about his conduct, Andy fires her. Shirley demonstrates about her unfair dismissal with a placard outside the bookies. Eventually Andy offers her a large sum of money to leave. Shirley is thrilled with the pay-off and decides to go to New Zealand to visit her son. Jack Dalton Jack Dalton, played by Hywel Bennett, is a gangland boss and the leader of the criminal organisation known as \\"The Firm\\". He first appears in EastEnders in May 2003, although the events surrounding the apparent death of the character Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), who was supposedly murdered in February 1989 were then retconned to include him. Dalton was a fearsome and legendary kingpin of the Walford criminal underworld. In addition to this and his status as head of The Firm, Dalton was responsible for ordering Den's death 14 years earlier. In the late 1980s, Den became involved with \\"Walford Investments\\", aka The Firm, and was forced to become the titular manager of Strokes wine bar (formerly Henry's), which was owned by The Firm and was really a front for illegal gambling. Strokes had a rival bar in the form of The Dagmar, fronted by James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde), who went on to rape his employee Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) - the wife of Den's best friend Pete (Peter Dean). In response to this, Den used his connections with The Firm to arrange for The Dagmar to be torched. The fire drew attention to the illegal goings-on at Strokes, and thus greatly angered The Firm. Den refused to take the blame and The Firm believed that he had informed the police about them. Consequently, Dalton decided to have Den murdered, and two of their members followed him to Manchester in September 1988 when he went there to seek refuge with a friend. However, he managed to outrun them in his friend's car and handed himself into the police; Den was then held under remand in custody on an arson charge until he appeared in court the following February. In one of the series' most famous exits, Den - who just hours earlier had escaped after members of The Firm had intercepted the taxi taking him to court - was shot as he walked by the canal by a member of The Firm, who was walking with a woman and had a gun hidden in a bunch of daffodils. Three weeks later, spots of blood were found on the canal towpath and the police identified this as Den's blood, and believed that he had been murdered. However, an initial search of the canal failed to uncover his body. In April 1990, Billy (Danny Brown), a local boy was fishing in the canal when he discovered Den's distinctive signet ring, prompting another search of the canal which this time uncovered a body which was identified as Den's. In 2003, it is revealed that Den had indeed been shot - but the shot had only wounded him. Aided by his mistress Jan Hammond (Jane How), he was able to escape to Spain where he forged a new life. Den finally returns to Walford on 29 September 2003. The body which had been found, wrongly-identified and buried had actually been the body of the unseen Mr. Vinnicombe, who was said to have been Dalton's predecessor as head of the Firm during the 1980s. Dalton had been displeased with Vinnicombe's failure to murder Den, and so ordered a member of The Firm to kill him and dump his body in the canal at the location where Den had been shot - his teeth were then bricked out to prevent dental identification; this implied a power struggle for control of \\"The Firm\\" at the time between Dalton and Vinnicombe. He also dumped Den's distinctive ring in the canal to further increase the likelihood of the body being identified as that of Den. Upon Vinnicombe's demise, Dalton was able to gain firm control of the organisation. During his brief spell on screen, Dalton shows a Machiavellian and ruthless streak. This is first evident when he first appears onscreen at his nightclub, the \\"Imperial Room\\", and receives a visit from Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) ‚Äì the local hardman of Albert Square, a community from East London and it's fictionalized borough: Walford. Following Phil's visit, Dalton arranges for one of his neighbours Spencer Moon (Christopher Parker) to get beaten up for using forged currency in his club though Spencer's brother Alfie (Shane Richie) takes the beating by pretending to be Spencer. Later on, Dalton discovers that his personal secretary Kate Morton (Jill Halfpenny) is actually a policewoman working undercover at his nightclub. In response, he summons his bouncer George Peters (Andy Beckwith) with the task of killing Kate by raping and murdering her in the latter's house. This is nearly successful until Phil, who previously had a one-night stand with Kate, comes to her rescue by knocking out Peters. The two men later return to Dalton, who blames Peters for failure and confronts Phil over his relationship with Kate. Though he is eventually persuaded by Phil to let Kate live scot-free, Dalton tells Phil that he now owes him a favor. At somepoint, Dalton receives a visit from Phil's love rival: Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman). It soon transpires that Dennis is Dalton's most dedicated employee, having been taken under Dalton's wing since he was 16-years-old. Moreover, Dennis had recently served 18 months in prison for covering up Dalton's criminal activities without exposing his involvement. Dennis soon begins to blackmail Dalton for ¬£20,000 in compensation for serving his prison sentence for him. After giving Dennis his ¬£20,000 compensation, Dalton plans to have him killed and summons Phil to carry out the task by reminding him of the favor he owes him. When Phil goes to kill Dennis, however, he ends up changing his mind when Dennis offers to kill Dalton himself - so the two of them will be free of him. Using the gun that Dalton originally gave Phil to kill him, Dennis confronts Dalton at his nightclub and forces him to drive Phil's car into the woods - where Dalton is ordered to park the edge of a railway track. Dalton is initially unfazed with Dennis' attempt to kill him and attempts to brainwash him in teaming up against Phil, with Dalton going as far as to recount all the things they've done together. When Dennis mentions Den and his family, pointing out that his future with Den's adopted daughter Sharon (Letitia Dean) is what matters to him now, Dalton begins to badmouth Sharon and her family before admitting to have arranged for Den to be killed. However, Dalton's mood changes from composure to fear when Dennis makes a confession: that Sharon's father is actually his father as well. Confirming that Den is his father, Dennis continues to point the gun at Dalton - who desperately attempts to reason with Dennis by revealing the truth about Den Watts; that he is in fact alive. Dalton begs Dennis that this \\"has to make a difference\\" in the hope that he will not shoot him, but Dennis tells him that it doesn't and - before Dalton can react - proceeds to shoot him, killing Dalton. Dalton appears to be somewhat nihilistic. When Dennis tells Dalton that he wants a new life away from a life of crime, Dalton responds \\"There isn't any new life! Just the old humdrum life bobbing along, making a living, getting old, waiting to die.\\" nonchalantly, echoing Dot Branning's (June Brown) words when she is depressed. Dalton's death would later be avenged at the end of 2005 when Dennis is murdered by Danny Moon (Jake Maskall) on the orders of his crime boss Johnny Allen (Billy Murray), who himself had killed Dalton's representative Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs) nearly a year before; ironically, Andy died on the same night Den was ultimately killed by his wife Chrissie (Tracy Ann Oberman). Alas, Dalton's legacy ultimately ends with Phil and his younger brother Grant (Ross Kemp) seeking to avenge Dennis' murder on Sharon's behalf - which culminates in Danny getting killed by his brother Jake (Joel Beckett), while Johnny later dies of a heart attack after being imprisoned for the murders of both Andy and Dennis respectively.

Eddie Eddie, played by Daren Elliott Holmes, made his first appearance in 5 July 2004 as the right-hand man and personal bodyguard of Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs), the reigning crime kingpin of Albert Square in Walford - a fictionalized borough in East London. Throughout his duration on the show, Eddie helps Andy expand his criminal empire and gangland reign upon Walford. This involves Andy ordering Eddie to get the upper hand over his rivals, as well as celebrate his wedding to local businesswoman Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf) - which is nearly ruined after her cousin Billy (Perry Fenwick) and ex-boyfriend Minty Peterson (Cliff Parisi) try to warn Sam's mother Peggy (Barbara Windsor) about Andy's scheme to extract control of the Mitchell family assets. However, they fail and Andy later sends Eddie to warn off Billy and Minty. It is at this point where Eddie has crossed path with Andy's best-friend Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) and sworn nemesis Alfie Moon Alfie Moon (Shane Richie). Towards Christmas 2004, Eddie observes Andy employing Billy's friend Paul Trueman (Gary Beadle) into the business so he could expand his criminal empire on drug dealing. When Eddie approaches the rendezvous point to carry out Andy's preparations, however, Andy deduces that Paul has set them up in a police sting operation - which prompts him to have Eddie leave the area and get rid of all evidence that traces their would-be involvement in the apparent drug operation. Eddie does so and Andy later has Paul killed in retribution, which inevitably sparks a conflict between Paul's adopted father Patrick (Rudolph Walker) and Andy himself when Paul's body is recovered the following month. Soon afterwards, Andy orders Eddie to investigate Alfie's two cousins Jake (Joel Beckett) and Danny (Jake Maskall) upon becoming enemies with them. In doing so, Eddie finds out that Jake and Danny are henchmen working for their mob boss Johnny Allen (Billy Murray). He subsequently informs Andy, who thereupon alerts Johnny to the square so he can take care of Jake and Danny. It is then Johnny begins to usurp Andy from his gangland reign, up to the point where Andy rants against Johnny in front of Eddie and their fellow neighbours in The Queen Victoria public house. Andy's outburst towards Sam prompts Johnny and his friend Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), the pub's landlord, to ban Andy from the pub and throw him out along with Eddie. Thereafter Andy tells Eddie that he plans to con Johnny out of his ¬£750,000 in a criminal transaction between them. While Eddie attempts to warn Andy about crossing Johnny with his plan, Andy insists that it is doing ahead regardless. This causes Eddie to observe Andy's go-ahead with his plot by having Danny help out, after Jake was originally authorized to help until Johnny cut him out of getting involved at the last minute. On the night Andy puts his scheme into motion, Eddie appears to contribute after helping Andy flee Walford with the ¬£750,000. However, as they drive out of the city, Eddie pulls over near a motorway bridge and claims that he needs to go to the toilet. Andy gives him permission to go, but it later turns out Eddie has actually betrayed Andy by alerting Johnny of his plan and location. Off- screen, Eddie witnesses Johnny and Jake arrive at where Andy is to intercept him - with Jake retaking Johnny's ¬£750,000 from Andy whilst Johnny himself orders Andy to take a walk with him on the motorway bridge. This causes Andy to discover Eddie's betrayal too late, and he reluctantly does so. Moments later, with Jake and Eddie watching from their cars, Johnny kills Andy by forcing him off the motorway bridge - which causes Andy to fall to his death. Johnny then returns to his car with Jake and they flee from the scene, though not before Johnny tells Eddie \\"I don't wanna see you again\\"; which implies that Johnny has ordered Eddie to leave Walford for good in order to destroy all traces of his involvement to Andy's death. Eddie complies with Johnny's orders regardless, and leaves Walford for good. The character Eddie makes his final appearance on 18 February 2005, the show's 20th anniversary episode where Andy is ironically killed off towards the broadcast's climax.

Demi and Leo take her with them when they run away together. They leave her with Pauline when they have to move into a squat. This leads to Leo's death from a heroin overdose, when Demi takes some heroin to numb her pain and Leo overdoses because he thinks she is dead. Aleesha leaves Walford with Rosie and Demi in July 2006 to live in the Cotswolds. Leo Taylor Leo Taylor, played by Philip Dowling, is Demi Miller's (Shana Swash) boyfriend. He first appears in October 2004 visiting his and Demi's new born baby daughter Aleesha (Freya and Phoebe Coltman-West). In May 2005, the Millers return to their former home in a block of flats whilst a rat problem in the square is being dealt with. Demi is reluctant, as it means she is likely to see Leo. Upon their arrival, Leo's father Ray (Dorian Lough) and his wife Trisha (Cathy Murphy) are the first people they see, and they receive a cold reception. Whilst taking Aleesha for a walk, Demi is teased by some of her brother Darren's (Charlie G. Hawkins) old friends, who mock her and refer to her as \\"Vicky Pollard\\". Upon heading back to the flats, Demi sees Leo and tries to escape in a lift, but Leo stops her. They realise their split had been due to their parents meddling and denying contact between the two, and they reunite. Demi tells Leo that it is Aleesha's christening the following day. Despite appearing reluctant, Leo and Trisha attend the christening, however the service is interrupted by Ray, who viciously drags his wife and son away whilst a heartbroken Demi looks on. The christening continues back at Clint's (Huggy Leaver) flat, and Demi and Leo meet later that evening from their balconies. As the feud between the Millers and the Taylors escalates, Leo plans to run away, and begs Demi to come with him. Demi agrees, but Leo abandons her when she insists on taking Aleesha. Demi returns to Walford, devastated, but is delighted when she meets Leo near the swings. Leo promises her he will keep in contact, and will wait as long as it takes to be with her. Leo, Demi and Aleesha run away, and Leo starts dealing drugs. Demi takes some of the drugs to numb her pain and she passes out. Leo returns to her and thinks she has died, so takes a heroin overdose and dies in hospital. This ending is a modern interpretation of that of Romeo and Juliet as much of the related storyline had been. Stacey Slater Stacey Slater, played by Lacey Turner, makes her first appearance on 1 November 2004.\\"Billy plans a new life\\", BBC. Retrieved 18 May 2008. The character is introduced as a feisty and troublesome teenager, an extension of the already established Slater clan.

Freddie Slater Freddie Slater (also Mitchell), played by twins Alex and Tom Kilby, was conceived in late 2003 when his mother, Little Mo Mitchell (Kacey Ainsworth), was raped by her friend, Graham Foster (Alex McSweeney). Her refusal to abort the baby caused the break-up of her marriage to her husband Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick). Little Mo stayed with her sister, Belinda Peacock (Leanne Lakey), where she gave birth to Freddie. In November 2004, after Graham is sentenced to eight years imprisonment, Little Mo and Billy make another attempt at their marriage, but they separate again after Billy admits that he struggles to accept Freddie. Freddie then lives at the Slater household with Little Mo, her grandmother Mo Harris (Laila Morse), her father Charlie Slater (Derek Martin) and her cousin Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner).

A few days before the hospital admission, Little Mo admits to her boyfriend Oliver Cousins (Tom Ellis), who is also a GP, that she sometimes gets very irritated with Freddie when he cries. When Oliver hears that Freddie's injury must have been caused by shaking or rough handling, he admits what Little Mo has told him to a paediatrician, Briony Campbell (Rae Hendrie), at the hospital. While the hospital believes that Little Mo may have shaken Freddie, Little Mo suspects that Ben Mitchell (Charlie Jones) may have hurt him in some way as they were left unsupervised together just before the incident. Little Mo confronts Ben and shakes him in irritation when he tries to run away. After extensive tests at the hospital, it is discovered that Freddie has a temporary low platelet count, due to an infection, meaning that any minor injury could hurt him badly, as his blood isn't clotting properly. Little Mo is no longer suspected of hurting Freddie. Freddie leaves Walford in May 2006 with Little Mo, who wants to start a new life in Barnstaple, Devon. Deirdre Foster Deirdre Foster, played by Patricia Brake, is the mother of Graham Foster (Alex McSweeney), who attends his rape trial in November 2004.

A serpentine path leads to the top, approximately above sea level, with a panoramic view of the Vistula River and the city. History Ko≈õciuszko Mound, 1930s Ko≈õciuszko Mound (video) It was completed in November 1823. The location selected for the monument was the natural Blessed Bronis≈Çawa Hill (), also known as Sikornik, situated in the western part of Krak√≥w's Zwierzyniec District. Ko≈õciuszko Mound is one of Krak√≥w's four memorial mounds, consisting of two prehistoric mounds, Krakus Mound and Wanda Mound, and two modern ones, Pi≈Çsudski Mound and Ko≈õciuszko Mound. The founding ceremony of the Ko≈õciuszko Mound took place on 16 October 1820. The construction was financed by donations from Poles living in all territories of Poland under foreign occupation. For three years, people of all ages and class voluntarily constructed the mound to the height of . Work was supervised by a Committee for the Construction of the Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko Monument. At the base of the mound, the Founding Act was deposited in a glass and marble case. At the top, a granite boulder, brought from the Tatra Mountains, was placed, bearing the inscription \\"Ko≈õciuszce\\" (To Ko≈õciuszko). Inside the mound, urns were buried with soil from the Polish and American battlefields where Ko≈õciuszko fought. In 1860, on the 30th anniversary of the Polish November Uprising, the top of the mound was crowned with a boulder (545 kg) of granite from Tatra mountains which had engraved upon it: TO KO≈öCIUSZKO. Initially, the grounds around Ko≈õciuszko Mound were planned to be turned into a colony settlement for the peasant families that fought alongside Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko in the uprising of 1794. In the late 1830s, those families began to settle at the foothills of Ko≈õciuszko Mound, but the process came to a halt when Austrian authorities decided to turn this area into a part of city's fortification. Between 1850 and 1854, the Austrian authorities built a brick citadel around the mound and began using it as a strategic lookout. As compensation for an earlier historical church that had been demolished, a neo-Gothic chapel of Blessed Bronis≈Çawa was also built. However, the Austrian fortifications, including the gateway and the southwestern rampart and entrenchment were eventually dismantled following World War II, between 1945 and 1956. Next to the mound there is a museum devoted to Ko≈õciuszko, that displays artefacts and mementoes of his life and achievements. In 1997, heavy rains eroded the mound, thus threatening its existence. It went through a restoration process from 1999 till 2003 in which state-of-the-art technology and modern materials were used. The mound was equipped with a drainage system and a new waterproofing membrane. Ko≈õciuszko Mound inspired Count Paul Strzelecki, Polish patriot and Australian explorer, to name the highest mountain in Australia Mount Kosciuszko, because of its perceived resemblance to the Ko≈õciuszko Mound in Krak√≥w.Mt Kosciuszko.

Cardijn was best known for his lifelong dedication to social activism and working towards the improvement of the working class; since his ordination he made a particular focus of his life the effort to evangelize and bring the core messages of faith in the Gospel back to the working class, whom he believed were neglected. He was not wrong in that assessment since old schoolmates working in the mines and mills believed the Church had abandoned them, which prompted Cardijn to found a social movement dedicated to this task despite the opposition that it faced. His movement received vocal praise and encouragement from Pope Pius XI. He demonstrated great zeal even after he had been imprisoned during World War II, which served to empower his positions on social change and to oppose rising inequalities. Cardijn was also an extensive traveller (visiting places such as Costa Rica and Australia) and was a recipient of several recognitions for his work in social activism. He served as a critical contributor to the Second Vatican Council, working closely with Pope John XXIII and Pope Paul VI. The latter named Cardijn as a cardinal in 1965. Cardijn died in a Leuven hospital in 1967. The cause for the cardinal's beatification was initiated in 2014 and he is titled as a Servant of God. Life =Childhood and education= Tomb in 280x280px Joseph Cardijn was born on 13 November 1882 in Schaerbeek as the second of four children to Henri Hieronimus Cardijn (1840‚Äì1903) and Louise Maria Ester Van Daelen ( 1850‚Äì1923). His siblings were: Jeanne (1881‚Äì1912), Victor (1884‚Äì1908), and Charles (1888‚Äì1975). He lived with his grandparents in Halle until his parents quit their jobs as caretakers and his father (who was illiterate) started a business as a coal merchant while his mother opened a caf√©. But he also lived with his grandparents because his mother's frail health meant she could not nurse him. He received his First Communion in 1895. His mother would often gather her children to read scriptural stories to them such as Creation or Pentecost or fairy tales such as Little Red Riding Hood. Both parents were devout and agreed to let him continue his studies to become a priest instead of going to work. One night in 1895 he went to his shared bedroom with his siblings and then crept downstairs barefoot to the kitchen to the fireside to speak with his parents regarding his desire to become a priest. He pleaded with his father, who relented after two tears fell down his cheeks; Cardijn affirmed: \\"I've felt within me a call from God. I want to be a priest\\". He commenced his ecclesial education in 1897. His parents had wanted him to have a good job since it would add to their income and ensure the Cardijns were better off. He studied in Halle before going in September 1903 to Mechelen for his education; his father died a few months prior to this. During his vacations he visited his old schoolmates working in the mills and the mines. But his old friends scoffed at his desire to become a priest, believing he joined those that oppressed the working class. =Priesthood= Cardijn was ordained a priest in St. Rumbold's Cathedral on 22 September 1906 from Cardinal D√©sir√©-Joseph Mercier. It was around this time that fellow priest Adolf Daens befriended him, becoming a major influence on Cardijn's life. He had also decided to spend his life evangelizing and bringing the faith back to the working class, whom he felt had been neglected. Mercier sent him to the Universit√© catholique de Louvain on 4 August 1906 for sociological and political sciences education but recalled Cardijin in 1907 for a teaching position in mathematics and literature; he called the position a \\"providential misfortune\\". He travelled during his vacations to France and England, where he visited Manchester and London. He became a teacher in Wavre in 1907 and travelled abroad during vacation periods, meeting people such as Baden Powell and Ben Tillett (August 1911). In 1912 (after being ill for a time), he was appointed to the parish of Laeken near Brussels where he started creating and improving workers' organizations in earnest. He was twice imprisoned during World War I for so-called patriotic activities. He left Laeken in 1919 and dedicated himself to social work from then on. In August 1914 he gathered food and medicine for soldiers and war victims. He was arrested in November 1916 and sentenced to thirteen months imprisonment on 6 December; his mother suffered a nervous breakdown upon learning of this. Cardijin used his time in prison to read the Bible and Karl Marx and smuggled his writings out of prison. In turn he received books and other materials through the underground. He was arrested again in 1918 on an espionage charge and sentenced to a decade of hard labor but was released following the November 1918 armistice that ended the war. In 1919 he suffered from tuberculosis due to his imprisonment and was sent to Cannes in France for several months of recuperation before going back to Belgium. In 1919 he started the (\\"Young Trade Unionists\\"). This group at first met resistance from within the Church but after a while the organization and Cardijn became accepted; in fact Cardijn received a blessing from Pope Pius XI in March 1925 who encouraged his work. Following their meeting the pope said: \\"Here at last is someone who comes to speak to me about the masses!\\" adding that \\"the Church needs the workers and the workers need the Church\\". In an autographed letter in 1935 the pope backed the Jocistas as an \\"authentic model\\" for activism and social action. He received permission in 1924 from Cardinal Mercier to meet the pope with Clemente Micara (the then nuncio to Belgium) helping to facilitate the March 1925 meeting. The pope blessed the movement and affirmed that \\"we make it our own!\\" He and the pope met again in 1927. The noted theologian Yves Congar likened the pope's approval for Cardijin's movement as reminiscent of that of Pope Innocent III confirming the Order of Friars Minor for Saint Francis of Assisi centuries prior. In 1924 the organization's name was changed to Jeunesse Ouvri√®re Chr√©tienne (JOC, or \\"Young Christian Workers\\"). The organization grew at a rapid pace throughout the world; its members were often known as \\"Jocists\\" (the movement was often called \\"Jocism\\"). In 1938 there were 500,000 members throughout Europe; in 1967 this had increased to two million members in 69 different countries. His opponents often called him a communist or a pied piper. In January 1938 he sent a petition to the pope asking for him to initiate the causes of canonization for Margaret Sinclair and Pier Giorgio Frassati. In 1940 the Gestapo arrested him but released him from jail in September 1942. He refused to leave unless those captured and jailed alongside him were released with him. The Nazis refused this request and forced his departure from the prison. On 1 September 1944 the Nazis burst into the JOC headquarters to take him as their prisoner but he learned of this beforehand and fled out the back door to hide. Pope Pius XII made him a Privy Chamberlain of His Holiness on 30 April 1950 and Pope John XXIII later named him as a Protonotary Apostolic on 25 September 1962. =Council and cardinal= Pope Paul VI announced that he would create Cardijn a cardinal in 1965; he had to first be consecrated as a bishop. He received his episcopal consecration and a week later Paul VI made him Cardinal-Deacon of San Michele Arcangelo. Leo Joseph Cardinal Suenens consecrated him as the Titular Archbishop of Tusuros in the chapel of the Pontificio Collegio Urbano de Propaganda Fide. Cardijn had first come into contact with Paul VI when he was Father Montini serving in the Secretariat of State. The two corresponded over time afterwards, but Cardijn‚Äôs concern was evident when Montini was transferred as the Archbishop of Milan since Cardijn lost a supporter and friend within the Secretariat. He likewise expressed his nervousness at the election of John XXIII since he did not know him and did not know how the new pope would respond to his movement. But the two soon became good friends and he was all the more pleased when John XXIII named Montini as a cardinal over a month after his election. Montini became pope in 1963 and sent him an letter on 4 November 1963 praising Cardijn's work. In 1964 the pope asked Cardijn to submit his thoughts on ecumenism and dialogue for Ecclesiam Suam. Cardijn gave a ten-page reflection to the pope as well as 40 additional pages of citations he thought would help in the document's drafting. He participated in the Second Vatican Council. Cardinal Basil Hume (in a 13 November 1982 speech to the Jocists) later noted that the council was Cardijn's \\"monument\\" due to the great and lingering contributions he made to it. Cardijn succeeded in ensuring that Apostolicam Actuositatem was named as the \\"Decree on the Lay Apostolate\\" rather than the \\"Decree on the Laity\\" for he felt the latter title did not address the faithful to an adequate degree. Pope John XXIII had named Cardijin as a member of the Preparatory Commission on Lay Apostolate and had written Mater et Magistra in 1961 based on Cardijn's model for social teaching as well as on his recommendation to commemorate seven decades since Rerum Novarum of Pope Leo XIII. He drafted more than 25 formal detailed notes for the commission advocating his vision for the faithful and these ideas later became incorporated into both Apostolicam Actuositatem and Lumen Gentium. He gave three interventions in the council. One such intervention was made on religious liberties on 20 September 1965. =Global visits= Cardijn was also a frequent traveller around the world and made his first trip to Australia in 1958 where he spoke at public rallies in both Melbourne and Adelaide; he returned to Australia one more time in 1966 to attend other rallies. He made his first trip to the Americas in June 1946 and visited Costa Rica during the trip and made a visit in 1948 to Northern Africa. In 1950 he received a distinction of the L√©gion d'honneur (French Legion of Honour). Cardijn made his first visit to Asia in 1953 and visited India and Sri Lanka visiting New Delhi and Colombo. He left Belgium on 20 November 1952 and returned on March 4 1953 having gone first to Beirut and Baghdad before heading to Karachi. Following India and Sri Lanka he was in Japan and Honolulu before visiting Chicago and New York after visiting Washington, D.C. On 24 February 1967 he left for Hong Kong and Japan on what would be his last international visit. =Illness and death= Cardijn died due to renal complications on 24 July 1967; his remains were interred in the Notre-Dame parish church in Laeken. On 19 June 1967 he was stricken with a terrible illness causing great pain; he had once had an operation in 1952, which led some to believe the illness was related to that operation. Cardijn suffered from a high fever and even fell down the stairs several times believing the pain would soon disappear. His diagnosis was not clear at first as his temperature increased, which worried those around him. He was taken to hospital where it was discovered he had a severe renal infection. He knew his time was short and dated his final letter to Paul VI on 25 June 1967. He had an operation in late June and his condition made a slight improvement to the point that he could have a little beer or coffee. Cardinal Suenens came to the hospital to give him the Anointing of the Sick not long prior to Cardijn's death. On 14 July he lapsed into a coma (also suffering from cardiac weakness); HM King Baudouin came for a long bedside visit despite the cardinal not recognizing him due to the severe nature of his illness. He fell into delirium on 15 July, breaking into fragments of a sermon on Populorum Progressio (a document he hailed upon its release). The nurse tending to him felt his pulse on 24 July noticing that the cardinal had died just moments earlier. The then-Prince Albert II attended his funeral. Pope John Paul II visited his tomb on his visit to Belgium in 1985. Legacies Cardijn's model (\\"See, Judge, Act\\") influenced a number of movements around the world, such as the Young Christian Workers (YCW), Young Christian Students, the Student Catholic Action, the Paulian Association and Palms Australia. In North America his approach was applied in Catholic Action movements. It had been adopted in South America as something compatible with the Liberation Theology movement. In Noarlunga Downs, Australia, the Cardijn College has been named in his honour. The school's motto is adopted from Cardijn's model. In South Africa it was used to support the development of the first black trade unions in Durban in the 1970s. =Recognitions= The cardinal received several doctorates and recognitions during his career; in 1950 he received a distinction of the L√©gion d'honneur (French Legion of Honour). His awards include: * ‚Äîfrom Universit√© de Montr√©al (1947) *‚Äîfrom Universit√© d‚ÄôOttawa (23 June 1947) * Unknown‚Äîfrom Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (1948) * Unknown‚Äîfrom Universidad de Santiago de Chile (1948) * Unknown‚Äîfrom Universidad de S√£o Paulo (1948) * Doctor honoris causa‚Äîfrom Universit√© catholique de Louvain (2 February 1951) *‚Äîfrom Universit√© Laval (23 December 1956) *‚Äîfrom Universit√© de Sherbrooke (23 December 1959) * Unknown‚Äîfrom Universit√© de Moncton (1962) Beatification process In December 2013 the then-Archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels Andr√©-Joseph L√©onard announced that he would launch the cause of beatification for Cardijn. The official request was lodged with the archbishop on 16 December and the archbishop launched the diocesan investigation on 16 January 2014; the cause is ongoing on the diocesan level. The current postulator for the cause is Mr. Guy Tordeur and the vice-postulator is Father Felix Van Meerbergen.

It is a slender, slightly compressed fish that is very similar to other species of Sillago, with detailed spine, ray and lateral line scale counts needed to distinguish the species between its nearest relative Sillago analis. The sand whiting is distributed along the east coast of Australia from Cape York south to Tasmania, as well as Lord Howe Island and New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean. The sand whiting commonly inhabits shallow sandy substrates in bays, estuaries and surf zones where it preys on polychaete worms, small crustaceans and bivalve molluscs. Reproduction in the species is variable over its range, generally spawning twice between September and April. Young fish inhabit shallow sand flats, both along the coast and well into the upper reaches of estuaries. First described in 1829, the species has long been prized as a table fish and is commonly sought by both recreational and commercial fishermen in New South Wales and Queensland. The sand whiting fishery is most prolific in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales where the species is most abundant, often caught along other species of whiting in estuaries and from beaches. Due to its importance as a commercial fish, substantial research has been carried out on the species, especially feasibility studies involving the use of sand whiting in aquaculture. Taxonomy and naming The sand whiting belongs to the genus Sillago, a division of the smelt whiting family Sillaginidae containing 29 individual species. The Sillaginidae are in the suborder Percoidei, a division of the Perciformes. The species was first identified and named by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1829 after receiving a specimen that was listed as having been collected in the \\"Southern seas\\". This holotype specimen was apparently taken near the coastline of Tasmania, Australia. Four junior synonyms were subsequently placed on the species, with Castelnau applying both S. insularis and S. terra-reginae, Thiolli√®re applying S. diadoi and Whitley S. ciliata diadoi to the species. All of these names are invalid under the ICZN nomenclature rules, which states that the first correct naming is the one to be used. Many of these synonyms were applied due to confusion over S. ciliata and the nearly identical, closely related species S. analis. The species was also misidentified as S. gracilis, a synonym of S. maculata, the trumpeter whiting; and also S. bassensis, the southern school whiting. S. ciliata is most commonly called the 'sand whiting' in reference to its preference for sandy substrates compared to some members of the genus which prefer muddy, silty, or grassy substrates. Other common names include the 'blue-nose whiting' in reference to the colour of the nose in fish of larger sizes, and 'summer whiting', a name often applied to S. analis as well. This name is applied to these species as they move from deeper offshore waters into shallow beach and estuarine waters in summer, where they become a target for recreational fishers. Description Three sand whitingThe sand whiting has a very similar profile to other members of the genus Sillago, with a slightly compressed, elongate body tapering toward the terminal mouth. The dorsal fin is in two parts, the first made of feeble spines and the second of soft rays headed by a single feeble spine, while the ventral profile is straight. The species is known to grow to a maximum size of 51 cm and around 1.25 kg weight. The fin anatomy is highly useful for identification purposes, with the species having 11 spines in the first dorsal fin, with one spine and 16 or 18 soft rays on the second dorsal fin. The anal fin has two spines with 15 to 17 soft rays posterior to the spines. Lateral line scales and cheek scales are also distinctive, with sand whiting possessing 60 to 69 lateral line scales and cheek scales positioned in 3-4 rows, all of which are ctenoid. The amount of vertebrae are also diagnostic, having 32 to 34 in total. The swim bladder has rudimentary tubules projecting anteriorly and a series laterally that diminish in size and become sawtooth-like posteriorly. The posterior extension is a single, tapering projection that extends well into the caudal region. A duct like process extends from the ventral surface to the urogenital opening. Swim bladder morphology is useless when determining between S. ciliata and S. analis, as they are nearly identical. The body is a pale brown or silvery brown colour, transitioning to white below, with green, mauve and rosy reflections when the fish is first removed from the water. An indistinct silver-yellow mid-lateral band extends across some specimens. The spinous dorsal fin is olive green with faint darker blotches, the second dorsal fin also a pale olive with rows of dark brown to blackish spots. The anal and ventral fins are pale yellow, the pectorals are pale yellow to pale brown with a well defined dark blue-black blotch at the base. The caudal fin is yellow to olive in colour with darker margins. Juveniles less than 90 mm may have darker blotches along their sides and backs. Sand whiting are a popular eating fish although can be dangerous to fishermen and children, when removing a hook from a whiting, if not handled properly may lead to the loss of finger due to their head rotation.source? Distribution and habitat The sand whiting inhabits a range along the east coast of Australia from Cape York, Queensland, southward along the coast and the Great Barrier Reef to eastern Victoria and the east coast of Tasmania down to Southport. The species also inhabits a number of islands; Lord Howe Island, New Caledonia, and Woodlark Island, Papua New Guinea. The species is most abundant in lower Queensland and New South Wales, where studies show it inhabits every estuary sampled throughout the course of a study, while in north Queensland, the species is very patchily distributed along the coast. The sand whiting is an inshore species, inhabiting exposed coastal areas such as beaches, sandbars and surf zones as well as quieter bays, estuaries and coastal lakes. Sand whiting enter estuaries, including intermittently open ones, and penetrate far upstream to the tidal limits of rivers and creeks where juveniles and adolescent fish may be abundant. The adults congregate around the mouths of estuaries, bars, and spits, in depths down to 5 m where they may constitute a large percentage of the icthyofauna of such regions. As implied by their name, they are often found exclusively over sandy substrates, with occasional appearances in Zostera seagrass beds. Individuals are occasionally taken in offshore waters to 40 m during winter. Biology =Behaviour= The sand whiting is a schooling species, whose movements are associated with a variety of factors including prey, lunar patterns and spawning movements; although there appears to be little consistency in its movements in relation to these factors. Studies on the species over the period of a year have shown the species does not change its local distribution over the course of a day, generally being of the same abundance during both night and day. Seasonal abundance due to spawning is variable, with studies conducted in Moreton Bay, Queensland finding the species recruits heavily to shallow waters and increase numbers during winter months, while studies in the Noosa River estuary have shown no difference in numbers recruited over the course of a season. Like other sillaginids, they have the ability to 'burrow' into the sand and remained hidden until a predator or seine net has passed by. =Diet= The sand whiting's distinctive body shape and mouth placement is an adaptation to bottom feeding, which is the predominant method of feeding for all whiting species. All larger whiting feed by using their protrusile jaws and tube-like mouths to suck up various types of prey from in, on or above the ocean substrate, as well as using their nose as a 'plough' to dig through the substrate. There is a large body of evidence that shows whiting do not rely on visual cues when feeding, instead using a system based on the vibrations emitted by their prey. S. ciliata is a benthic carnivore that feeds predominantly on polychaetes and various crustaceans. Like other species of Sillago, the diet of the species is related to the size and age of the individual, with three distinct size classes identified in a study conducted in Botany Bay, NSW. The smallest fish of 0‚Äì10 cm take large amount of amphipods and few polychaetes, while fish between 11 and 20 cm consume mostly neried polychaetes and few amphipods. The largest fish over 21 cm take large amounts of bivalve molluscs and shrimps of the genus Callianassa. =Reproduction= As with many species of fish, the timing of spawning varies over the range of the species, with gonad development indicating that spawning in the southern New South Wales region occurs from December to April, while spawning in southern Queensland occurs from September to February. Spawning takes place twice a year, evident by the two classes of egg size found in the ovaries and by the two recruitment pulses observed each year as young fish enter their juvenile habitats. The spawning takes place at the mouths of estuaries or in surf zones, with the larvae occurring in fully marine waters. Juveniles reach 16.5 cm in length after their first year of life, 26.7 cm after their second year and 30.5 cm after their third year. After the beginning of the spawning season young whiting of 10 mm and over can be observed swimming actively in small droves of from 10 to 20 on the sand flats and beaches to which they are recruited, moving up and down with the tide, swimming in very shallow water to depths of 1 m. Unlike closely related sillaginids, the juveniles usually prefer unprotected sand substrates, while other species tend to use seagrass and mangroves as protection. As they grow older they keep further from the shore. Relationship to humans The sand whiting is a highly prized table fish often rated equal to the King George whiting, making it a common target for both commercial and recreational fisheries. The flesh is white, tender and has a moist, low oil content composition, making it easily digestible. Investigations into the aquaculture of the species began in the 1980s, and has led to the development of farmed sand whiting. =Commercial fishery= Although the sand whiting ranges down to Victoria and Tasmania, the species is not common enough to make up a significant part of their fisheries, with other sillaginids such as school whiting and stout whiting making up the bulk of the catch. In New South Wales and Queensland, however, it is one of the most common species taken, especially in lower Queensland. The species is often not differentiated from golden-lined whiting or trumpeter whiting, meaning fisheries statistics do not reflect the total catch for the species. In 2000, 238 tonnes of whiting were taken in Queensland, a decrease from the past 4 years. The species is primarily taken in estuaries in New South Wales, and is also included under the general heading of 'school whiting' when taken from beaches. Research showed that the average commercial harvest from individual estuaries was around 1-2 tonnes per year, with an increase in most rivers during the 1970s and 80's. The species is commonly taken by a number of fishing methods, with the most common being seine nets. Ring, fence, fyke netting and beam trawling are also used occasionally, but more often associated with sampling the entire population for research purposes. Research has focused on the effectiveness of different mesh sizes used to net the species in order to prevent juvenile individuals dying after becoming enmeshed. Associated research has also shown that those whiting that survive and are discarded tend to have much lower survival rates due to scale loss, which is a major issue, as many young fish are regularly taken in such nets and released by the fisherman after sustaining scale loss. These studies have led to a number of proposals and subsequent changes to net regulations. At market, sand whiting is medium priced fish, sold fresh or frozen; whole and in fillet form. In abundance, sand whiting is moderately priced, with fillets being slightly more expensive. The recovery rate of fillets from whole fish is about 40%. Sand whiting may be used as sashimi. =Recreational fishery= Sand whiting are commonly sought after by anglers due to their reputation as a food fish, and due to their relative accessibility, with large catches possible from many shore-based locations. The catches of recreational fishermen may exceed the catches of professionals, with studies showing Queensland had over twice the amount of fish taken by anglers in 2000. The species is commonly caught throughout its habitat, with sand flats, tidal gutters in estuaries and surf beaches commonly having producing good catches. Excessively shallow water, especially in proximity to Zostera beds may produce numerous undersized fish, and may be avoided if the young fish are too prevalent. Due to their preferred habitat, light lines with minimal weight added are employed to avoid spooking the fish, with a small running bean or ball sinker commonly rigged above a size 4 or 6 hook. Specialist whiting fishermen often use a red piece of tubing or beads to attract the whiting; whether this works has yet to be proved, but anecdotal evidence shows the fishermen's catches don't suffer. Baits used resemble the species natural prey, with prawns, nippers, a variety of bivalves and beach worms most often used, with more successful catches obtained using live bait. In New South Wales, sand whiting have a minimum legal length of 27 cm to be taken and a daily personal bag limit of 20 applies, while in Queensland there is a minimum size of 23 cm and a combined bag limit of 30 for all whiting species. Sand whiting are used themselves as live bait for larger species such as mulloway, mangrove jack and large flathead, although anglers must still adhere to the minimum size limit. =Aquaculture= The aquaculture potential for sand whiting was first investigated in the late 1980s, with a number of reports detailing both successful trials and also a number of problems with such trials. A 1988 study showed that sand whiting were more likely to grow in captivity than other whiting species, but the mortality rate of over 50% was unacceptable for use in an economic setting. A number of problems with diseases such as ulcerative dermatitis and the failure of the swim-bladder to inflate properly were also documented, however many of these initial problems have been overcome, and some facilities are breeding around 2000 larvae with a 95% survival rate. Some of these fingerlings are used to restock depleted estuaries, while others form the basis of commercial fish crops.

History  The lighthouse on a late 19th century postcard The first lighthouse in the location was built in 1828 when the town was part of the Kingdom of Prussia and called Swinem√ºnde. The current structure is from 1857. The cross- section of the entire 1857 tower was octagonal. However, in 1902‚Äì1903 the tower was restored to repair spalled brickwork. This converted the shape of the tower above the first gallery to the current round shape. The tower was damaged during World War II. In 1945, during the retreat of the German troops, an order was given to destroy the lighthouse. However, the German keeper refused the order and the tower survived. The damage was only repaired in 1959, some fourteen years after the town was annexed by Poland. In 1998‚Äì2000, for the new Millennium, the lighthouse was restored. It was reopened to the public in August 2000, along with a lighthouse museum in the keeper's house.  Construction  The tower is built of yellow bricks and is unpainted.

Ayer had travelled to Bangkok in November 1940 as a Special correspondent for Reuters before joining the Indian Independence League. In October 1943, Ayer was appointed the Minister of publicity and propaganda in the nascent Azad Hind Government. Following the successful Allied Burma Campaign and the fall of Rangoon, Ayer retreated out of Burma with Bose and about 100 members of the Rani of Jhansi Regiment by foot for Bangkok and onwards to Singapore. After the Japanese surrender, Ayer was chosen to leave Singapore for an unknown destination together with Bose and two other members of the Azad Hind cabinet. On Bose's last flight from Formosa to an unknown destination, there was no room for Ayer. The plane crashed on August 17, 1945 and Bose died the following day. Ayer was flown from Tokyo to Delhi in November 1945 to give evidence in the Red Fort Trials and became a key defence witness in the first trial.

In a class lecture, he said that despite the advent of the airplane, the cavalry was still best for gathering information, patrolling, reconnoitering, and harassing the enemy. The leader any given horse-mounted scouting unit had to be equipped with a compass, a map, field glasses, pencil and notebook, message blanks, and a watch.E.G.B.

Erwin, \\"Negro Troops Charged With Rank Cowardice,\\" The Chattanooga News, Tennessee, May 26, 1919, page 9 According to historian Robert H. Ferrell, Greer also sent letters to \\"officers he thought might enlighten the department on the use of African-American troops\\" in the Army. He gave out copies of his letter to reporters in Washington with the aim of getting publicity for his views, not only \\"from a military point of view but from that which all southerners have. I refer to the question of negro officers and negro troops.\\" He noted that he had been chief of staff of the mostly black 92nd Division since it was organized in October 1917, The letter stated: > To start with, all company officers of infantry, machine guns and engineers > were negroes, as were most of the artillery lieutenants and many of the > doctors. Gradually as their incompetence became perfectly evident to all, > the engineers and artillerymen were replaced by white officers. ... The letter said that the black soldiers of an American regiment attached to a French corps failed \\"in all their missions, laid down and sneaked to the rear, until they were withdrawn. Thirty officers of this regiment alone were reported for cowardice or failure to prevent their men from retreating.\\" Greer claimed that the 92nd Division had \\"had about thirty cases of rape, among which was one where twenty-two men at Camp Grant (Illinois) raped one womam, and we have had eight (I believe) reported in France with about fifteen attempts besides.\\" > There have been numerous accidental shootings, several murders, and also > several cases of patrols or sentinels shooting at each other. . . . at the > same time, so strict has been the supervision and training that many > officers passing through our areas would remark that our men actually had > the outer marks of better discipline than the other divisions. . . . Gen. > Bullard asked me my estimate[,] and I said they could do anything but fight. Of the black troops, Greer said, \\"Accuracy and the ability to describe facts is lacking in all[,] and most of them are just plain liars in addition.\\" He stated: \\"They have, in fact, been dangerous to no one but themselves and women.\\"\\"Calls Negroes Rank Cowards,\\" The Charlotte Observer, North Carolina, May 15, 1919, page 3\\"War Department Asked to Dismiss Officer,\\" The Gaffney Ledger, South Carolina, May 17, 1919, page 3\\"The Negro in the War,\\" The Robesonian, Lumberton, North Carolina, page 3 Historian Ferrell wrote: > But what was surprising was his [Greer's] animus against African-Americans > on the rape question. One might well ask how he could have said such things. > On this point, he provided no answers, only statements. . . . The colonel > blamed black misconduct of this sort entirely on black officers. In > regiments of engineers and artillery where supervised by white officers > there had been only a single case of rape. He quoted Greer as writing: \\"The undoubted truth is that the colored officers neither control nor care to control the men. They themselves have been engaged largely in the pursuit of French women, it being their first opportunity to meet white women who did not treat them as servants.\\" Response Editors of black publications The Crisis of New York and The Eagle of Washington, D.C., began a movement to have Greer fired from the Army. According to W.E.B. Dubois, the publisher of The Crisis, the Post Office Department held up the magazine's distribution of its May 1919 issue because of \\"articles in the magazine related to prejudice alleged to have been shown toward American negro officers in France by white officers.\\" That issue contained the full text of Greer's letter.\\"'Crisis' Magazine Held Up in Mails Pending Query,\\" New York Tribune, May 2, 1919, page 7 The League for Democracy, an organization of Negro officers, wrote an objection to Secretary of War Newton D. Baker, stating: \\"We cannot permit our descendants to read this letter [Greer's] in future histories and look upon our graves with scorn and contempt. . . . In this matter our slogan is 'Greer must be tried and the race vindicated.'\\"\\"The War,\\" The Crisis, May 1919, page 151 =Oath of allegiance= Lieutenant- Colonel Greer was a prosecutor in the noted June 1922 court-martial of Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson, who was convicted of violating the 96th Article of War in publishing an open letter to President Warren G. Harding critical of the Army's high command.Douglas Wheeler-Nicholson interview, p. 13 Wheeler- Nicholson based his defense on freedom of speech, but, as The New York Times put it, Greer argued \\"that when an officer or soldier took the oath of allegiance [,] he waived these rights. He said he would sum up the whole history of the case in the words of a song, 'Everybody's Out of Step but Jim,' referring to Major Nicholson.\\"\\"Major Nicholson Nicholson Guilty, Is Fined,\\" The New York Times, June 6, 1922, image 4 Greer said that the Army way of doing things might not be perfect but constructive criticism was always welcome. He said of Nicholson's stance: \\"[A]ny attempt to restrain him has been tyranny. Any orders applying to him which he does not like are styled Prussianism. The service at large apparently meant nothing to him.\\" =Type of cannon= According to Greer, while serving under Gen. Douglas MacArthur after 1927, Greer promoted the use of the 105 mm cannons over the 75 mms by writing an article which drew the support of his commander-in-chief.\\" \\"I knew I was right or I would not have written the article,\\" he told MacArthur.

It presented artworks produced after the year 2000 only and it focussed especially on the early work of artists. Artists also did not necessarily have to be fully established. A risk with regard to long term art historical relevance was taken for the sake of art historical speculation. The MOYA also functioned as a springboard for many young artists.

Represented countries In the MOYA, mainly contemporary young European art was presented even though there was a concentration on regional art from Vienna and Austria and its neighbouring countries. The MOYA functioned as a gate the east with its many exhibitions and artists from Eastern Europe. The annual show \`Young Art Global¬¥ regularly put the regional context in a broader spatialtemporal perspective with international artists from all over the world. The MOYA was closely related to the diplomatic circle in Vienna and collaborated with cultural institutes and international art institutions in the countries. In 2014 the MOYA received the Flame of Peace, an award given by members of the Habsburg family for contributions to world peace. The following countries were represented in the MOYA by artists in cooperation with ministries, embassies and cultural institutes and institutions of the following countries: Andorra, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Brazil, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Luxemburg, Malaysia, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Panama, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine.

Formerly abandoned and left to decay for four decades, it has been recently repaired, renovated / restored and beautified. It is currently the headquarters of Humanim Inc., a regional social services agency. History Built in 1887 by John Frederick Wiessner, a German immigrant, for his Weissner Brewing Company, the Northeast Baltimore brewery was one of the largest breweries in the state of Maryland. At its peak, the brewery employed 61 workers: 16 in brewery work, 17 drivers, 14 in the bottling house, 8 garage men, and 6 office workers. The central tower of the building housed a 10,000-bushel grain elevator.Mitchell IV, Alexander D. Baltimore Then & Now (2002) p. 132-33. Thunder Bay Press, San Diego, California. Prohibition forced the shutdown of the facility in 1920. In 1931 the Wiessner family sold the brewery to the American Malt Company, which modernized the interior equipment and operated the brewery until 1973. The building was listed that year in the National Registry of Historic Sites. The Brewery has become the new home for Humanim, a Columbia, Maryland, nonprofit organization, secured $22.5 million for renovations of the American Brewery complex into its new headquarters. The City of Baltimore approved the building permit in early 2004, and work is now complete. The American Brewery is situated in the center of one of East Baltimore's most blighted neighborhoods. Redevelopment The front facade of the newly renovated American Brewery building. Struever Bros. Eccles & Rouse, Humanim Inc., and Gotham Development LLC have announced plans to redevelop the Brewhouse building and bottling plant into a social and human services center and a new Baltimore headquarters for Humanim Inc. > The project consists of two phases: the Brewhouse and the Bottle Building. > The Brewhouse, a building that once served as the main brewing facility, > will be transformed into Humanim's Baltimore headquarters.

The Brewhouse is scheduled to start construction > in summer 2007 with completion scheduled for the summer 2008. The Bottle > Building is scheduled to start construction in 2008 with completion in 2009. The once-vibrant neighborhood around the brewery building has long been in decline and was largely forgotten by politicians and the media during the latter half of the 20th century. About half of the homes and other buildings in the area have been demolished or are vacant. Basic services such as grocery stores and restaurants have disappeared as well. In 2006, the City of Baltimore moved to acquire 200 abandoned properties in the area for future demolition or rehabilitation.Baltimore Sun - May 17, 2007 The rehabilitation of the American Brewery may serve as an impetus for further investment in the East Baltimore neighborhood. Due to its central location in a struggling neighborhood, interior space, and architectural quality, the brewery is seen by urban planners as an anchor for future community and economic development initiatives in the area. It is hoped that new employment and social services will attract additional investors, improving the quality of life for current and future residents.

Seagull is the oldest camera maker in China. The product line of Seagull includes TLR cameras, SLR cameras, folding cameras, CCD and SLR camera lenses, large-format cameras, film, night vision scopes, and angle viewfinders. Seagull's cameras usually use basic, time-tested mechanical designs that require no batteries. Seagull has made 21 million cameras since it was founded in 1958. Some Seagull cameras are distributed through the Lomography company. Seagull adopted the SR lens mount from Minolta's manual focus SLRs and camera design under license, and continues to produce it long after Minolta moved on to autofocus Alpha lens mount cameras. On June 10, 2012, Shanghai Museum of Old Camera Manufacturing opened to the public. The museum features historic items of the company, most noticeable the production line of Seagull 4A and collections of more than 200 cameras.  Major models  * Seagull 4 (4¬∑4A¬∑4B¬∑4B1¬∑4C) Seagull has been producing a series of Twin-lens reflex camera since the 1960s and it is believed that they are still producing; the latest model is 4A-109 featuring modern lens coating and some other improvements. Seagull 4 is the first model from 1967. The predecessor is Shanghai 4. Seagull 4A is the second model from 1968. Some Chinese amateurs consider the 4A and the later 4A-1 variants professional, partly because the camera was unaffordable for most Chinese citizens in the 1960s and 1970s. The 4A sold for 230 RMB and the 4A-1 for 290 RMB, whereas a worker earned only 20 RMB per month. The camera was unavailable to ordinary people, and only those working for government and press could afford one. Seagull 4A-1 from the 1970s and later 4A-1XX models feature Tessar type lenses. Another noticeable feature is the long-awaited hot shoe. The later 4A-1XX models are mainly for selling overseas, hence the absence of Chinese characters is no surprise. Seagull 4B and 4B-1 are simplified models of 4A. The 4B-1 may take 645 formats. The focus screen of 4B-1 is Fresnel lens achieving bright viewing. Unlike 4A, the original lenses for 4B and 4B-1 are three-element cooke triplet. As some Chinese vendors are selling proclaimed Tessar lenses components for upgrading old cameras, one may come up with 4B-1 featuring four-element lenses. Seagull 4C can load 135 films.

Researched by American psychologists Andrew N. Meltzoff and M. Keith Moore, this capability plays an underlying part in neonatal imitation (infant capacity to model observable adult behavior).  Origin  Modern investigation into the field of neonatal imitation and intermodal modeling began with Meltzoff and Moore‚Äôs seminal study in 1977, investigating 12 to 21-day-old infants and their ability to replicate adults‚Äô facial and manual gestures. They acknowledge opposing voices who argues replication of observed behaviors is ‚Äúmerely arousal of oral activity,‚Äù with the evidence of imitation of three facial gestures and one manual gesture. The history of the intermodal model began when Meltzoff and Moore defined it as an innate human ability, essential to imitation. They hypothesized intermodal mapping acted as a sequence in which an infant observes an adult‚Äôs facial acts and creates a ‚Äúsupramodal‚Äù framework. With proprioceptive feedback, an infant can then distinguish whether their actions are equivalent to those they see. Therefore, stimuli are not necessarily restricted to a singular sense, but allow them to exist universally in the brain and integrate in ways to produce complex outcomes. This is illustrated specifically in how visual and proprioceptive systems (senses) integrate to aid imitation. Meltzoff and Moore‚Äôs studies typically mirror the Headturn Preference Procedure (HPP) as they observe both behavior in relation to response time in infants.  Criticism  Criticisms of this approach typically question the innate, or inborn, claims Meltzoff and Moore make. Overall, researchers doubt the possibility that infants have the inherent ability to observe and create their own sequence of movements producing the same ‚Äúconfigurations‚Äù or actions of the adults they‚Äôre modeling. In addition, critics question how the link between visual input and motor faculties can be made so early in the infant‚Äôs development.  Neurological Explanation  Meltzoff and Moore describe a neurological explanation claiming mirror neurons as the true mechanism linking ‚Äúsensory input from observed actions to motor programs.‚Äù Found in the adult rhesus monkey cortex, similar areas in the human cortex are thought to also contain these neurons, although evidence is still debated. Theoretically, both the intermodal mapping model and mirror neurons function through automatic low-level processes meant to facilitate imitation. With Hebbian Theory in mind, mirror neurons cannot be innate. They could, however, gain responsiveness through ‚Äúpostnatal experience,‚Äù which Meltzoff acknowledges as a part of the intermodal model‚Äôs nature as an imitation mechanism.  Replication  Several French institutions have involved themselves in this hypothesis and tested its relation to infants, specifically the Centre des Sciences du Go√ªt et de l'Alimentation, Dijon, France; the Centre Emotion, H√¥pital de la Salp√™tri√®re, Paris, France, and the Unit√© de Psychiatrie P√©rinatale, Maternit√© Ambroise Par√©, Bourg-La-Reine, France. In the Soussignan, et. al. 2011 study ‚ÄúHuman newborns match tongue protrusion of disembodied human and robotic mouths‚Äù, researchers replicate the Meltzoff and Moore position with 2D stimuli. As a result, this research reinforces the intermodal mapping hypothesis, adding that repeated experience and associative sequence learning are crucial components to this hypothesis. However, other studies have failed to replicate Meltzoff and Moore‚Äôs findings. Maurer, Stager, and Mondlock‚Äôs study ‚ÄúCross- modal transfer of shape is difficult to demonstrate in 1-month-olds‚Äù (1999) first criticized Meltzoff for ‚Äúlacking important controls.‚Äù Yet, after those were included, Maurer et al. (1999) failed to replicate Meltzoff‚Äôs findings.

The kelch domain generally occurs as a set of five to seven kelch tandem repeats that form a Œ≤-propeller tertiary structure. Kelch-repeat Œ≤-propellers are generally involved in protein‚Äìprotein interactions, though the large diversity of domain architectures and limited sequence identity between kelch motifs make characterisation of the kelch superfamily difficult.  Structure  The N-terminus of several Kelch proteins contain other protein domains, including Discoidin, F-box, and Broad- complex, Tramtrack, Bric-a-Brac/Poxvirus Zinc finger (BTB/POZ) domains. Kelch proteins may also only have a Œ≤-propeller architecture. The BTB domain of kelch proteins (if present) allows the formation of homo- or heterodimers that mediate protein‚Äìprotein interactions. The C-terminus of Kelch proteins contains kelch repeats. Each kelch repeat is a sequence of 44‚Äì55 amino acids in length, usually occurring in clusters of 4 ‚Äì 7 repeats. Each kelch repeat forms a \\"blade\\" of the Œ≤-propeller fold, consisting of a four-stranded antiparallel Œ≤-sheet secondary structure, arranged radially around a central axis, packed onto its adjoining repeats via hydrophobic contacts.

Ivy League is a style of men's dress, popular during the late 1950s in the Northeastern United States, and said to have originated on college campuses, particularly those of the Ivy League. It was the predecessor to the preppy style of dress.Fashion design Origins President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, a style icon for followers of the Ivy League look. Ivy League clothing is derived from the casual attire worn by the British and American upper classes during the 1920s, for sporting pursuits such as golf, polo, sailing, rugby football, hunting, Water Polo, and tennis. Typical summer attire for this time included navy two button blazers with gold buttons, striped college blazers, Ascot ties, cable knit tank tops, Oxford shirts, Breton striped shirts, and wingtip shoes. For fall, trendsetters such as the Prince of Wales combined the latest American fashions with traditional British country clothing such as brogue boots, Argyle socks and jumpers, and tweed cloth sportcoats, Irish walking hats and plus fours in houndstooth, herringbone, or the Prince of Wales check popularized by Edward VII. During the mid to late 1950s, many young college men adopted the Ivy League look due to its association with the upper classes at leisure.Gentlemans Gazette The clothing stores J. Press and Brooks Brothers represented perhaps the quintessential Ivy League dress manner, the former with two of its four locations found at Harvard and Yale universities (the Princeton branch closed in 1943). The Ivy League style was epitomized by the sack suit, which is defined as being a 3-to-2 (3 buttons with the top button \\"rolled\\" back to reveal only two usable buttons) jacket without darts and a single \\"hooked\\" vent. The pants were typically cuffed and without pleats. It was also characterized by the use of natural fabrics, shirts with button-down collars, and penny loafers. In suits, the Ivy League style was promoted by clothier Brooks Brothers and included natural shoulder single-breasted suit jackets. In 1957 and 1958, about 70% of all suits sold were in the \\"Ivy League\\" style. Typical hairstyles included the crew cut, Harvard clip, and regular haircut,Boys Life 1959 and common clothing items included cardigan sweaters, sweater vests, Nantucket reds, khaki chino pants, knitted ties, white Oxford shirts,Life Magazine 1959 Tootal or Brooks Brothers ties, Ascot neckties, tartan, grey tweed cloth or flannel sportcoats,Life Magazine 1954 and seersucker blazers in the South.Removing the Ivy League stigma Mainstream popularity and decline Mod band the Small Faces wearing Ivy League inspired Glen plaid sportcoats. From the late 1950s until the mid 1960s, Ivy League clothing was considered desirable mainstream apparel for middle class adults in the US. In Britain during the mid and late 60s, the Mod subculture combined the latest Italian fashions with the attire worn by the heroes in contemporary American films such as Steve McQueen, James Dean or Paul Newman.Newman and McQueen Particularly popular were the grey flannel, Tonic, or houndstooth suits, polo shirts, chino pants, Argyle socks, sweater vests, cardigan sweaters, basketweave loafers, Madras plaid, and narrow brimmed Irish walking hats and Trilbys.Claudio De Rossi The style remained fashionable in America until it was supplanted by more casual everyday clothing influenced by the hippie counterculture during the late 1960s and early 1970s.Gentlemans Gazette Revival An American style known as preppy is similar to Ivy League but intended for today's mainstream culture. Preppy style tends to be more colorful, especially in spring and summer, and incorporates more casual chic attire. It was first popularized in the early 1980s as a return to Ivy League styles after a decade of more modern trends, but today, preppy differs from historic Ivy League. Preppy fashion is influenced by traditional collegiate trends, rather than reproducing them exactly, and various clothing items can be considered preppy based on how they are worn or accented. During the 1990s and 2000s Polo Ralph Lauren, Vineyard Vines, J. Crew and J. Press were large marketers of preppy clothing, modernised to accommodate new trends inspired by indie pop and urban fashion. Controversially, in a recently revised form, a version of this style is sometimes promoted and marketed as \\"American Trad\\" or simply \\"Trad,\\" although there are marked differences between the two styles. Trad is narrower in scope than the intermediate preppy style. By the 2010s, many American preps opted to dress in a more classic, tailored style closer to the original Ivy League look. Popular clothings include loafers, Sperry Top- Sider boat shoes, Aran sweaters, cardigans, Oxford shirts, Cricket pullovers, wingtips, stripy polo shirts, hats like the fedora, khaki or pastel colored Vineyard Vines, Nantucket Reds, white or bright pastel color socks, colored jeans, baseball jackets, khaki cargo shorts, and tapered chinos. Blazers, especially those made from seersucker, had made a comeback as informal or smart casual wear by the mid 2010s, and the traditional two button style was updated with throwback styling inspired by The Great Gatsby. In popular culture During the 1950s, the wealthy and clean cut Squares, Rahs and Socs (Soc being short for social) with their Ivy League clothes were the rivals to the working class Greaser subculture.Cool cars high art The conflict between the two groups features in Grease, The Outsiders,Fantastic racism Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull, and Cry-Baby.Cry Baby In a scene in The Godfather, set in 1946, Michael Corleone is derided as an unlikely assassin because he is a \\"college boy\\" who wears an \\"Ivy League suit.\\" The style was parodied in Clark Gesner's song The Ivy League Look from the 1957-58 Princeton Triangle Club musical \\"After A Fashion\\".Princeton Triangle Club: the original \\"Ivy League Look\\" See also *Take Ivy *Jock *Preppy *Popular clique *Subcultures of the 1950s Notes Fashion aesthetics 2000s fashion 1950s fashion ","title":"Ivy League (clothes)"},{"id":"12811935","text":"James Michael Derrick (September 19, 1943 ‚Äì January 14, 2009\\"James Michael Derrick Sr.\\"The State obituaries, January 16, 2009 ) was a left fielder and first baseman in Major League Baseball who played briefly for the Boston Red Sox during the season.

He was MP for Taunton in 1529 and 1536. Origins and early career Portman was the son of John Portman, who was buried in the Temple Church on 5 June 1521, by Alice, daughter of William Knoell of Dorset. His family was long established in Somerset, having given its name to the former manor and present village of Orchard Portman, and he served as Justice of the Peace for that county from time to time. He was a barrister who was successful enough to be personally known to King Henry VIII. In 1532 he acquired 270 acres adjacent to the NW of the City of London, which estate stretching from today's Oxford Street to the Regents Canal, known as the Portman Estate, is still held by his descendants the Viscounts Portman. In 1533 Henry VIII gave him a wardship, and he was one of the administrators of the will of Catherine of Aragon. Judicial career He was made a judge in 1547, and knighted by King Edward VI. When Richard Rich, later 1st Baron Rich was ill, Portman was one of those who, by letters patent of 26 October 1551, were commissioned to despatch chancery matters; and in the following January he was commissioned to aid the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, Thomas Goodrich, Bishop of Ely, in similar affairs. He seems to have been reluctant to adopt the new protestant religion, and found no difficulty in keeping office under the catholic Queen Mary. He followed Day, the Bishop of Chichester, in persuading Sir James Hales to abjure Protestantism in 1554. The same year he was made Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales. He died early in 1556‚Äì7, and was buried, with a stately funeral, on 10 February 1556‚Äì7 at St Dunstan-in-the-West, London. Marriage and progeny He married Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of John Gilbert, who was connected by descent with the eminent legal family of Fitzjames.

Biography He was educated at Waldorf school (based on the Rudolf Steiner system). He matriculated from South African College Schools (SACS) in 1991 and completed a Bachelor of Commerce degree at the University of Cape Town in 1994. He qualified as a paragliding instructor and managed an active paragliding school in Cape Town. He worked in the film industry, and as a paragliding instructor in the UK. Upon returning to South Africa he began to write sports articles for various magazines, mostly to the international free-flying magazine Cross Country. He also worked at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (2008‚Äì2010). His first novel Beyond The Invisible was published in 1998 by Eternity Press. This was followed by a non- fiction guidebook for Paragliding in South Africa (1999), The Fresh Air Site Guide. His epic fantasy series, The Tale of the Lifesong, began with The Riddler's Gift (published 2007) and continues with Second Sight (published 2010). Writing influences He mentions that his writing comes to him visually, and on his website he lists The Matrix and The Lord of the Rings as having been particularly memorable films (see profile). His work shows elements of magical realism and has a vivid visual style. Although taking some inspiration from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, he writes with a more contemporary approach similar to Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind. In an interview he referred to Stephen Donaldson and Robin Hobb as having influenced his work, as well as the satirical Discworld novels of Terry Pratchett. In an interview (Something Wicked Magazine, Winter 2007) he commented on his motivation to write: \\"For me it's a very personal joy. I really enjoy being in the mental state one reaches when writing creatively. It's a kind of meditation, and one I find invigorating. It feels that I'm wiser when writing than in the normal everyday world.\\" Paragliding He began flying in 1992, and took part in world record attempts in 1994 and 2007 in the X-SA Challenge. He flew in the Paragliding World Cup circuit in 1997. His passion for open- distance cross country flying has taken him to many countries around the world and seen him set site records in South Africa. His experience in exploration and bivouac flying led to the filming of Fresh Air Riders (2000), a collaboration with South African Hang-gliding Champion Johan Anderson, directed by extreme sports documentary film-maker Nic Good of the Fresh Air Crew. This was followed by his directorial debut The Journey produced by Eternity Press in 2008. Bibliography *Beyond the Invisible - Flying from fear to freedom. (Literary novel. English. Published by Eternity Press, 1998). :Written in the first-person narrative style of Richard Bach, this loosely autobiographical story blends descriptive imagery of flying paragliders with meditations on the metaphysics of dealing with fear. A recurrent theme in this work is the enervating atmosphere of the modern city-life contrasted with the freedom of the wilderness tramp. Although there seem to be many references to real experiences, the reader is confronted with passages which tend towards the fantastical, but in the context of the story they serve to demonstrate a shift of perception. As a piece of fiction dealing with paragliding it is considered rare (Joe Schofield, Skywings Magazine review). *Fresh Air Site Guide - Paragliding and Hanggliding in South Africa. (Guidebook.

Aims  The charity aims to improve the use of energy in buildings. This statement simplified the earlier stated mission to mobilise individuals, businesses and communities to make their contribution to reducing carbon dioxide emissions through energy efficiency and use of sustainable energy sources (notably renewable energy) to maintain affordable energy services and combat global climate change.  Activities  NEF was founded in 1988 by Milton Keynes Development Corporation to preserve for the future benefit of the UK public some of the energy initiatives that had been undertaken within the new city. Its initial projects included extending a technical home energy label (known as the Milton Keynes Energy Cost Index ‚Äì MKECI) into a more generally applicable home energy rating called the National Home Energy Rating (NHER), and technical energy monitoring work on low energy homes in the Milton Keynes Energy Park. In 1994, the NHER Scheme was injected into a subsidiary company (sold in 2011) to run the business on behalf of the charity. In recent years, many of its projects have more of an applied research element, including collaborative projects with UK universities. From 1993‚Äì2001 NEF worked closely with the Energy Saving Trust, setting up the UK's network of Energy Efficiency Advice Centres (EEACs) on their behalf, and managing the network for the first five years. But as domestic energy efficiency moved more into the mainstream, NEF expanded its interests into Renewable Energy (from 1995) and non-domestic energy efficiency, through its management of the Energy Efficiency Accreditation Scheme from 1998 onwards. In 2005 this scheme was transferred to the Carbon Trust but still managed by NEF; in 2008 it was relaunched as the Carbon Trust Standard with some NEF administrative involvement until 2013. NEF's current focus includes post-occupancy building performance evaluation, as well as identifying strategies to minimise the performance gap between the design and in-use energy consumption of buildings. It also works with housing stock owners (such as UK local authorities and housing associations) to minimise tenants' housing use, and operates a number of regional programmes to combat fuel poverty. After around 2002, most local and regional domestic energy efficiency activities were handed over to the United Sustainable Energy Agency (formerly Milton Keynes Energy Agency ‚Äì MKEA), but NEF retained involvement in projects such as Milton Keynes' Low Carbon Living (formerly ThimkAgain!) campaign, and in 2013 agreed to merge with USEA. The Foundation undertakes work with local communities across the UK in partnership with the Sustainable Energy Academy, most notably through the Superhomes project (originally known as Old Home Superhome), and through its involvement with the Local United and Communities & Climate Action Alliance projects. NEF's former offices in Milton Keynes, England Most of the charity's work is within the UK, although it participates in a number of EU projects, has undertaken some work in SE Asia and actively supports international standardisation work through CEN and ISO.  Renewable Energy  NEF has also been active in the area of renewable energy and, in particular, with integrating it into buildings and assisting local authorities and other bodies to create the right environment for a wider uptake of sustainable energy. Since 2015, it has operated the formerly independent Yougen website, targeted mainly at UK households wishing to install small-scale renewable energy measures. Historically, it also provided secretariat functions to trade associations such as the Solar Trade Association and the Ground Source Heat Pump Association, as well as running from 2010-15 the Green Energy Supply Certification Scheme that implemented Ofgem's guidelines for marketing \\"green\\" electricity.  Work with young people  Although working mainly with organisations and the general public, NEF has from time to time run projects aimed at educating young people. This includes the Energy Envoys project, aimed at encouraging students undertaking the Duke of Edinburgh's Award to become involved in saving energy.http://www.dofe.info/en/content/cms/leaders/approved- providers/The_National_Energy_/ In 2007-8 it launched a global warming game called Logicity, funded by the Defra Climate Challenge Programme, in an attempt to raise interest in the subject among young adults. For several years it ran a mobile education unit called the Green Energy Machine.  Buildings  Until 2019, NEF occupied a purpose built low energy building designed to demonstrate some of the features that it espouses. Built in 2002-3, the building is heated by a Ground Source Heat Pump, with hot water being partly provided by an evacuated tube solar water heating system. There is a winter back-up heating system in the form of a wood pellet stove. The building is naturally ventilated, with brise-soleils to prevent overheating in summer, and use of daylight is encouraged through Light tubes ('SunPipes'). Around a fifth of the office's energy is supplied by a 6.47kWp photovoltaic array. As well as energy features, its environmental credentials include the use of rainwater for toilet flushing and a low thermal mass sustainably sourced timber frame structure. The adjacent low energy building was constructed in 1999 for NEF on land provided by the Commission for New Towns. This was designed to show how super-insulation could enable a 1,000m2 building to be heated from a single gas condensing boiler little larger than would be used in a typical UK home. This served as NEF's headquarters until 2004. A 39kWp photovoltaic array was added to this building in 2012, taking advantage of special fixings that had been designed into the original building. Both buildings are now owned by Return on Investment Ltd, and NEF operates from offices in Bletchley.

History The Coast Guard's presence in Port Angeles began 136 years ago on August 1, 1862 with the arrival of the SHUBRICK, the first Revenue Cutter to be home ported on the Olympic Peninsula. Ediz Hook, a level sand spit extending from the mainland north and east into the Strait of Juan de Fuca, was declared a Federal Lighthouse Reservation by President Lincoln in 1863. The first lighthouse was commissioned on 1 April 1865. The Air Station was commissioned on 1 June 1935, becoming the first permanent Coast Guard Air Station on the Pacific Coast. Its location was chosen for its strategic position for coastal defense of the Northwest. The first aircraft, a Douglas RD-4 amphibian, arrived 11 June 1935 and flew the first \\"mercy hop\\" on August 1935. The 75-foot patrol boats were also stationed at the new unit. During World War II, the Air Station expanded to include a gunnery school, training aerial gunners and local defense forces. A short runway was added to train Navy pilots for carrier landings. It also hosted independent units such as Naval Intelligence and was Headquarters of the Air Sea Rescue System for the Northwest Sea Frontier Area. By the end of 1944, the Air Station had 29 aircraft assigned. In September 1944 the station officially became Coast Guard Group Port Angeles, with several sub-units including the Air Station, Station Bellingham, Station Neah Bay, Station Port Angeles, Station Quillayute River, USCGC ADELIE, USCGC BLUE SHARK, USCGC CUTTYHUNK, USCGC OSPREY, USCGC SEA LION, USCGC SWORDFISH, USCGC TERRAPIN, and USCGC WAHOO. In 1946, the first helicopter, a Sikorsky HO3S-1G arrived. This was replaced in 1951 with the Sikorsky HO4S helicopter (the \\"Eggbeater\\"). The last fixed wing aircraft, the Grumman HU-16E Albatross (the \\"Goat\\") was retired in 1973. Since then the Air Station has been home to helicopters only, starting with the HH-52A Seaguard, first acquired in 1965. The HH-52A was replaced in 1988 with the new American Eurocopter HH-65A Dolphin twin turbine helicopter. During a typical year, Group Port Angeles units carry out over 400 search and rescue missions, saving 35 lives and assisting 500 persons. Each year, property valued at over $2 million is saved. Coast Guard Group and Air Station Port Angeles continues its untiring vigil, true to the Coast Guards motto \\"Semper Paratus\\" ( Always Ready ).

St√§helin, M.D. (20 October 1925 ‚Äì 5 July 2011) was a Swiss pharmacologist with an outstanding record in basic and applied cancer and immunology research. He discovered two important drugs: etoposide and ciclosporin. Early life Both St√§helin's parents were medical doctors. After preparatory school and a classical education with the emphasis on Greek and Latin, St√§helin studied medicine in Basel, Z√ºrich and Florence (1944‚Äì1950). His first position after graduation was at the Institute of Microbiology of the University of Basel (1951‚Äì1954) where he investigated the morphology and sporulation of anthrax bacilli with the help of the then-new phase-contrast microscope. In May 1951, St√§helin was the first to observe naked anthrax bacilli protoplasts, called gymnoplasts, which had left behind their empty cell walls. A year later, during his studies of their osmotic behavior, he discovered and described the occasional fusion of naked protoplasts. This seminal paper in German immediately caught the attention of the bacterial geneticist Joshua Lederberg, who personally requested a copy. Early career In 1954, St√§helin successfully applied for a 12-month postdoctoral fellowship sponsored by the Swiss National Foundation (SNF) to work on a project on phagocytosis inspired by Emanuel Suter (then at Harvard, later second Dean of the University of Florida Medical School). In 1955, St√§helin rediscovered the respiratory burst in leucocytes in Manfred L. Karnovsky's laboratory at the Department of Bacteriology and Immunology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, U.S.A.; ; His experiments stirred the interest of Karnovsky, who was at the time unaware of this metabolic phenomenon (which had first been described more than twenty years earlier in 1933 by C. W. Baldridge and R. W. Gerard). St√§helin's elegant work subsequently paved the way for the famous investigations of A.J. Sbarra and Karnovsky on the role of oxygen in the defense against microorganisms.; see also references related to St√§helin's work in: ISI Citation Classic CC/27:25‚Äì25, July 4, 1983 While at Boston, the biomedical talent of the 27-year-old St√§helin was spotted by the director of the pharmacology department of the Sandoz Corp. (now Novartis AG.) Basel, who visited Suter's Harvard Medical School laboratory. After 6 months of training in the state-of- the art tissue-culture techniques in John F. Enders' laboratory in Boston, sponsored by Sandoz, St√§helin joined its pharmacology department in Basel to head the newly created laboratory, then a research group working on cancer and immunology (1955‚Äì1979). Discovery of Podophyllum derivatives St√§helin quickly assumed the leading role in the discovery and development of Podophyllum compounds; four of them, including etoposide (Vepesid), were later marketed. He was able to detect in a partially purified, chemically modified extract of the Podophyllum plant the presence of a then-unknown agent with interesting properties, which had at first been considered by the chemists to be \\"dirt\\". The chemists, under the direction of A. von Wartburg, analysed this impurity. Guided by St√§helin's in-vitro and in-vivo assays, they found the active compound responsible for the good antitumor activity of SP-G (Proresid oral) and SP-I (Proresid intravenous; discovered in April 1959, commercialized 1963). Further chemical modifications led to the well-known thenylidene derivative VM-26 (teniposide, Vumon, discovered in October 1965, commercialized by Sandoz in 1976) and to the ethylidene derivative VP-16-213 (etoposide, Vepesid, discovered on 21 October 1966), which remains very clinically successful. Teniposide and etoposide were found by St√§helin to have a new mechanism of action: they blocked the entry of cells into mitosis (with arrest in late S or G2 phase), in contrast to SP-G and SP-I, which were spindle poisons. His subsequent investigations showed that the early biochemical effect of the two epipodophyllotoxins on proliferating cells in vitro differed from that of the alkylating agents, antimetabolites and Vinca alkaloids. After a landmark clinical comparative analysis by F. Muggia and M. Rozencweig, etoposide and teniposide were licensed to Bristol-Myers in 1978 for further clinical development. A few years later, in November 1983, etoposide was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Etoposide is still considered a potent, well-tolerated combination partner in innumerable hematologic and solid tumor treatment schedules, including those for malignant lymphomas and lung cancer. It is also indispensable in the cure of testicular carcinoma. New screening process and the discovery of immunosuppressants St√§helin was also instrumental in the discovery process of several microbial products inhibiting cell proliferation, including cytochalasin B, brefeldin A, verrucarin A, anguinine and chlamydocin, which have played an important role in basic cancer research. In 1969, St√§helin made the key decision to include a test system for immunosuppression into the general screening program at Sandoz for compounds and extracts. He invented a new procedure which permitted the use of the same mice for testing both anticancer activity (L-1210) and immunosuppression (inhibition of antibody formation) in an \\"all in one in-vivo test system\\". This considerably reduced both the number of experimental animals and the quantity of test substances required, and also decreased the labour involved. St√§helin's invention of this procedure initiated an innovative screening system for discovering immunosuppressant drugs lacking bone marrow toxicity ‚Äì the first such screen to be discovered. This screening process was first used in the pharmacology department in January 1970, before Jean F. Borel joined St√§helin's group. St√§helin had used a similar screen to discover the nonmyelotoxic immunosuppressant ovalicin. Applying the revised screen led to the discovery of the potent biological activity of ciclosporin on 31 January 1972. This drug was to revolutionize organ transplantation in the 1970s and the paper became a citation classic (CC/6:16-16, 6 February 1984). The \\"St√§helin Screen\\" was rapidly and very successfully adopted by the Japanese pharmaceutical company Fujisawa (now Astellas), which subsequently discovered tacrolimus (FK-506, Prograf), the second clinically used calcineurin inhibitor. On receiving the American Association for Cancer Research Bruce F. Cain Award jointly with his colleague A. von Wartburg in 1990, St√§helin wrote: \\"...there are an astonishing number of coincidences between etoposide and cyclosporine. The first coincidence was that etoposide and cyclosporine were both found and developed on the chemical and biological side by the same groups, those of the present authors and their specific biological effects were discovered by one of us; second, both compounds were approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration on the same day in November 1983, although they had been submitted by different companies; furthermore, both drugs act via an effect on an intranuclear isomerase, topoisomerase II, and peptide cis-trans-isomerase, respectively; both compounds are potent immunosuppressants; etoposide as well as cyclosporine are used in the treatment of leukemias or other malignancies; the latter after bone marrow transplantation to prevent graft-versus-host disease, the former also being used in conjunction with bone marrow transplantation; sometimes, the two compounds are used concomitantly, exploiting the capacity of cyclosporine to reduce certain types of multidrug resistance or to modify immunity against tumors cured by etoposide; in the development of both drugs, galenical problems arose, related to poor water solubility and absorption from intestinal tract, and experience gained with etoposide in this area was crucial for overcoming, several years later, difficulties of a similar type with cyclosporine. It is left to the reader to make assumptions about the heuristic aspects of these surprising coincidences...\\" Personal and later life Married to a distant cousin (Irene Staehelin, who is also a member of an old Basel family dating back to 1520) and the father of four adult children, St√§helin retired in 1990. He still occasionally wrote about his discoveries.Sandimmune: Dr. Hartmann St√§helin: Person/Career/Development . Retrieved on 2007-08-28.

Through her daughter Elizabeth Charlotte, Duchess of Orl√©ans, she was the direct ancestress of House of Orl√©ans and the Houses of Habsburg-Lorraine and Habsburg-Este.  Life  Born in Kassel, Charlotte was the seventh child and fourth (but second surviving) daughter of William V, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel and Amalie Elisabeth of Hanau-M√ºnzenberg. She is said to have been a beautiful, but very vain and intellectually undemanding young woman. =Marriage= At the urging of her widowed mother, she married on 22 February 1650 at Heidelberg Castle with Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine, the son of the late \\"Winter King\\" of Bohemia, who only a few months earlier by the Peace of Westphalia after decades of exile returned to a devastated Electoral Palatinate, the reconstruction of which he set out with great energy. However, Charlotte did not reciprocate the love and attentions of her bridegroom, but instead confessed that she ‚Äúdid not like to take him‚Äù. Dowager Landgravine Amalie Elisabeth had already warned Charles I Louis that her daughter was cold- tempered and stubborn. Charlotte, in turn, soon felt that her husband was ten years her senior and that she was being persecuted and monitored with unjustified jealousy. The marriage with Charles I Louis became very unhappy and disputes soon arose. Despite the marital disputes and to the joy of the Electoral Palatinate, Charlotte gave birth three children in quick succession: Charles (born 31 March 1651 and later Elector Palatine), Elisabeth Charlotte (born 27 May 1652 and by marriage Duchess of Orl√©ans) and Frederick (born 12 May 1653, died 13 May 1653 aged 1 day). After the birth of her third child, the Electress Palatine expelled her husband from the bedchamber and refused to resume their conjugal duties. Charles I Louis accused his wife of having ridden and hunting too often, as well as being addicted to gambling and excessive cleaning. Charlotte, who was prone to tantrums and loud scenes, provoked her husband, who finally took one of her ladies-in-waiting, Marie Luise von Degenfeld as his official mistress; this event led to fits of jealousy by Charlotte, which the Electoral Palatinate responded to with domestic violence. =Divorce= Due to his princely position and church belief, Charles I Louis couldn't get a divorce without Charlotte's consent, although he tried again and again in vain despite her disobedient, stubborn, morose and unruly demeanor. Unlike her ancestor Christine of Saxony, who in 1540 accepted the morganatic second marriage of her husband Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse (who subsequently fathered children with both women), Charlotte strictly refused to this. Charles I Louis, as the owner of the highest executive and judicial power in the Electoral Palatinate, finally on 14 April 1657 decided to unilaterally and officially divorce his wife and proclaimed this publicly. Then he determined his court preacher to bless the wedding with his mistress Marie Luise von Degenfeld as a morganatic marriage; however, Marie Luise and her brother had insisted on a regular and equal marriage. Unlike the Electress Palatine, Marie Luise gentle and submissive. Between 1658 and 1675, she bore the Elector 13 children; they received the title of 'Raugrave', but dynastically were considered illegitimate and excluded from the line of succession. Charlotte initially didn't return to Kassel after her \\"divorce\\" but lived in a wing of Heidelberg Castle, still hoping that her marital bond could be restored. Little is known about her relationship with her two surviving children, Charles and Elisabeth Charlotte. Her daughter was sent by her father to live with his sister Sophia at her court in Hanover in 1659, apparently to remove the child from her mother's sphere of influence. According to another opinion, Charles I Louis send his daughter to Hanover to spare her from the marital disputes. Sophia, who had lived at the Heidelberg court for a few years prior to her marriage, had seen it enough: she hated and despised her sister-in-law and was happy to help her brother take her daughter away from Charlotte, presumably to persuade her to return to Kassel. The only one at the Heidelberg court who openly sided with Charlotte was her eldest sister-in-law, Elisabeth. There are two touching letters from Charlotte to her daughter from the time she was traveling to Hanover, and several others to her tutor, in which she inquired about the child's condition and complained that she was no longer getting an answer. It's likely that Elisabeth Charlotte's letters were withheld from her mother in order to break off contact between each other. After Charlotte finally left Heidelberg in June 1663, her daughter was allowed to return to the Palatinate court. The two only met again many years later in two encounters in 1681 and 1683. =Later years and death= After Marie Luise von Degenfeld died in 1677 following complication from her 14th pregnancy, Charles I Louis tried in vain to obtain the consent of his first wife to an official divorce so that he could marry again equally and ensure the succession of the Electoral Palatinate, since the marriage of his eldest and only legitimate son, the Electoral Prince Charles with Princess Wilhelmine Ernestine of Denmark had been childless for seven years. However, Charlotte firmly refused. Charles I Louis died on 28 August 1680 and was succeeded by his son Charles II. Once her son took the government, Charlotte inmediately returned to Heidelberg and took her place as Dowager Electress Palatine, but remained ill-tempered and difficult. After the death of her son on 26 May 1685, Charlotte retired to an apartment in Neuburg Abbey, where she lived on a meager pension until her death ten months later, on 26 March 1686 aged 58. =Charlotte from the perspective of Sophia of the Palatinate= Charlotte was considered difficult and stubborn. Her sister-in-law Sophia (who, however, may not have been entirely objective, but seems to have had a complete aversion to Charlotte) describes her as vain, superficial and a bit stupid. In her memoirs, Sophia also tells of the marriage drama and the arguments at the electoral court after Charlotte found a box with two rings and two letters with the elector's promise of marriage to Marie Luise von Degenfeld and vice versa: When Charlotte, after her death, was dressed for burial, Sophia commented: Ancestry Notes Bibliography * Robert Geerdts (ed.): Die Mutter der K√∂nige von Preu√üen und England.

In 1969, he was posthumously inducted into the ANA Hall of Fame. An award is named in his honour and awarded by the ANA on an annual basis. His contributions to numismatics include the founding of the Pacific Coast Numismatic Society in San Francisco in 1915. Early life He was born in Tyrone, Pennsylvania. Louisiana Purchase Exposition gold dollar To commemorate the centennial of the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, and the subsequent Lewis and Clark expedition, two World's Fairs were held: the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis Missouri in 1904, and the Lewis and Clark Exposition in Portland Oregon in 1905.‚ÄúNumismatics of the Lewis and Clark Expedition‚Äù, Jim Hunt and Jim Wells, p. 41, The Numismatist, March 2004, Part of the souvenirs included numismatic items, and the ANA's proponent Farran Zerbe was at the center of promoting it. Zerbe avidly sought to popularize coin collecting through his travelling exhibit, ‚ÄúMoney of the World.‚Äù He publicized the United States first commemorative coins ‚Äì the Isabella Quarter and Columbus Half Dollar ‚Äì issued for the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. He backed the gold dollars for the 1904 St. Louis Fair, with two versions being produced: Jefferson and McKinley. He was also placed in charge of distributing the entire mintage of Louisiana Purchase Exposition gold coins.‚ÄúNumismatics of the Lewis and Clark Expedition‚Äù, Jim Hunt and Jim Wells, p. 42, The Numismatist, March 2004, Zerbe spearheaded the initiative to have US gold $1 coins struck to commemorate the Lewis and Clark Exposition. He supported a commemorative with Lewis‚Äô bust on one side, and Clark's on the other. The appropriations bill for the Lewis and Clark Centennial Celebration was passed by Congress on April 13, 1904. It provided the mintage of 250,000 gold dollars that would bear likenesses of the two explorers. All dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint. Zerbe was placed in charge of the distribution of the coins at the exposition. He enthusiastically trumpeted the coins when sales were sluggish for the Louisiana Purchase pieces at $3 each. The Lewis and Clark dollars sold for $2 each when the fair opened on June 1, 1905. Zerbe soon raised the price to $2.50 by claiming that the 1904 issue was almost sold out. Not satisfied with the US gold dollar as the sole numismatic commemorative of the occasion, Zerbe had private quarter and half dollar tokens struck in gold.‚ÄúNumismatics of the Lewis and Clark Expedition‚Äù, Jim Hunt and Jim Wells, p. 43, The Numismatist, March 2004, These pieces depict Mt. Hood, and very little is known about them. It is believed that they were manufactured in Chicago and are akin to the quarter and half dollar tokens that were distributed at the St. Louis fair. Purchase of the Numismatist On June 16, 1908, Dr. George F. Heath, founder of the American Numismatic Association suddenly died. Farran Zerbe, then president, assumed the task of editing and publishing The Numismatist, and soon purchased the publication from Heath's heirs.Money.org  ANA History In 1911, through the generosity of W.C.C. Wilson of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, THE NUMISMATIST was purchased from Zerbe and presented to the ANA and since that period, the magazine has been owned and published monthly by the ANA.  1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition  In 1915, the Panama-Pacific International Exposition was held in San Francisco to celebrate the opening of the Panama Canal along with San Francisco's emergence from the devastating earthquake and fire of 1906. Zerbe oversaw the Exposition's official Coin and Medal department. The United States Congress authorized the San Francisco Mint (also known as \\"The Granite Lady\\") to issue a series of five commemorative coins. Said coins were the 1915S silver Panama-Pacific half dollar and four gold coins. The denominations of the gold coins were 1 dollar, 2¬Ω dollars (quarter eagle), a 50 dollar round coin, and an unusual 50 dollar octagonal coin. Zerbe also supervised the creation of a series of commemorative medals, an award medal, a souvenir medal, and diplomas. The Pan-Pac coins have the distinction of being the first commemorative coins to bear the motto \\"In God We Trust\\", and were also the first commemoratives to be struck at a branch mint. In the same year, Zerbe founded the Pacific Coast Numismatic Society in San Francisco in 1915. It is the oldest numismatic organization in the Western United States, and fosters a strong tradition of research and literary publication. The Peace Dollar Zerbe (right) with his successor as head of the Chase Manhattan Bank Money Museum, Vernon Brown, c. 1939 Frank G. Duffield, editor of The Numismatist, prepared a paper for the 1918 Philadelphia convention of the American Numismatic Association. The paper called for a general circulation coin to commemorate America's inevitable victory in World War I. The ANA convention was not held that summer because of the 1918 flu pandemic, which took 100,000 lives along the East Coast and tens of millions worldwide. On August 25, 1920, at the ANA convention in Chicago, Waldo C. Moore, President, called on Moritz Wormser, Chairman of the Board, to read a paper from Farran Zerbe of California. Zerbe's proposal asked for a general circulation commemorative coin and the object of the coin was to be America's influence for peace. Zerbe's letter said: \\"Our example as a democracy... was a mighty moral force that won battles without number in the hearts and in the minds of those who ultimately proved that they had the power to topple thrones...\\" Zerbe reminded the convention that \\"liberty and rule by will of the majority gave equal opportunity for energy and thrift, time and talent, bringing contentment, prosperity and honour as merited.\\" Farran Zerbe's proposal also included a call for a popular competition in which he asked for either a half dollar or a dollar, to allow for a maximum field for the artist. Zerbe's intent was clearly an allegorical or symbolic design although it would be a point of contention when the coin finally came out. Zerbe's original proposal that the designer come from outside the United States Mint presented obstacles. The Congressional resolution of May 9 said nothing about a design competition. Despite objections, a contest was held and the announcement was made on November 23, 1921. The first Peace Dollar was presented to President Warren G. Harding on January 3, 1922. The Numismatist for February included words of criticism. Disappointment and thin consolation was expressed came from Anthony de Francisci, Farran Zerbe, and Judson Brenner (chairman of the ANA Peace Coin Committee), and ANA president, Moritz Wormser. Among the faults was the fact that the coin was not symbolic or allegorical. The sunrise could be interpreted as heralding a new day of peace, and, of course, there was the word itself carved on a rock. The olive branch adorns most American money. It is likely that the ANA was hoping for something more like the Panama- Pacific issues. He died in 1949 in New York City.

After this hard fought operation she continued on to Hollandia, New Guinea, discharged her cargo, and 13 October sailed for the Philippines. Hercules remained in the Philippines, with several trips back for supplies, for both the initial invasion of San Pedro Bay 20 October and the landings on Lingayen Gulf 9 January 1945, as American forces returned victorious to the Philippines.  Supporting Iwo Jima operations  Reaching Ulithi 24 January 1945, Hercules embarked troops with cargo and 17 February sailed for Iwo Jima. The invasion of that rugged island began 2 days later, and Hercules steamed in the retirement area until 27 February when she disembarked reserve troops on the beach and received wounded. After discharging her cargo, she remained in the Iwo Jima area until 20 March when, loaded with U.S. Marines and their equipment, she sailed for Pearl Harbor. Reaching Pearl 4 April, Hercules carried cargo to Guam and Eniwetok before reaching San Francisco 22 June for a much-needed overhaul.  End-of-war operations  The war in the Pacific ended while Hercules was still undergoing repairs, but she sailed west again 24 October 1945. Loading ammunition in the Philippines and the Admiralty Islands, she transited the Panama Canal 16 March 1946 and docked at Norfolk, Virginia, 26 March. After a brief trip up the coast to New York and New Jersey, Hercules sailed to Norfolk 18 May and hauled down her commissioning pennant 28 June 1946. Hercules was transferred to the Maritime Commission 18 July. Returning to merchant service, she was renamed SS Exermont, and later SS Bostonian.

The other two members were Jo√£o Ricardo, founder and main songwriter of the group, and Gerson Conrad. History The first line-up, consisting of Jo√£o Ricardo, G√©rson Conrad and Ney Matogrosso, plus various musicians as John Flavin (guitar), Willy Verdaguer (electric guitar), Marcelo Frias (drums), Sergio Rosadas (flute), plus a special participation of Z√© Rodrix was short- lived - only two albums were released, one in 1973 and one in 1974, both self- titled. This line-up achieved success, appearing in several television broadcasts and remains highly influential today. Matogrosso's unusual high- pitched voice helped create a distinct identity as well as the band's eccentric heavy make-up and outfits (developed by Matogrosso himself, with influences ranging from Brazilian indigenous peoples to kabuki theater). In typical Tropic√°lia fashion, Secos & Molhados's style was one marked by a broad fusion of genres, including glam rock, MPB, fado and experimental music, among others. Most lyrics for both studio albums were adapted from the work of poets such as Manuel Bandeira and Vinicius de Moraes. In reference to their MPB musical style, ‚ÄúAnother group that expressed its disagreement via the physicality of its performance style‚Äîand, inevitably, via rock music, was the Secos & Molhados. Mixing progressive rock and blues, incorporating Luso- Brazilian folk references (in ‚ÄúO vira‚Äù ‚Äì [name of a Portuguese dance]) and by the constant inclusion of poetry‚Äîby names like Vinicius de Moraes, Manuel Bandeira and Fernando Pessoa, among others‚Äîthe trio enjoyed a meteoric career, with two albums released between 1971 and 1974, and an enormous popular success driven by the visual appeal of their makeup and the sexually ambiguous theatricality of vocalist Ney Matogrosso. The Secos & Molhados appear at Maracan√£ stadium in 1974 Ronald Fonseca/ Ag√™ncia O Globo. The black-and-white makeup that marked the signature look of the group was chosen almost by chance. Prior to the success of the Secos & Molhados, Ney Matogrosso had been an actor and, in a show by the group at the Casa da Badala√ß√£o e T√©dio, a club next to the Ruth Escobar Theatre, he arrived late, having come straight from a children's play in which he had been acting. In his haste, he took the stage still in full makeup. Jo√£o Ricardo, founder and lead composer of the band, and bandmate G√©rson Conrad were excited by the audience reaction and decided to adopt that style. That artifice was amplified by Matogrosso's stage and television performances themselves. Early in the 1970s, he had demanded a newly hegemonic role. In the article Corpo e performance no experimentalismo do grupo Secos & Molhados (Body and performance in the experimentalism of the group the Secos & Molhados), Vargas describes the singer's posture with precision: ‚ÄúHis figure is arrogant (bulging bare chest, head held high), even with bare feet. His eyes are wide open, the shrill voice is remarkable, the exaggerated movements of his mouth emphasize the pronunciation of the words, hip movements insinuate other codes, feathers, beads and sequins jangle with his body, a series of dance movements or completely free movements on the stage become codes for freedom. These weren‚Äôt rehearsed moves, that always stayed the same.‚Äù Instead of driving away the public in a country that was still conservative, the effect was the opposite: sold-out shows all over Brazil, a tour in Mexico, hundreds of thousands of albums sold. ‚ÄúThe two LPs by the Secos & Molhados were perhaps the biggest phenomenon experienced by the Brazilian recording industry in that period,‚Äù Zan observes. ‚ÄúI think the experience of that group set new standards for the staging of songs at a time when television was coming into its own as the principal medium of mass communication in this country. At the same time, the performances anticipated the invention of the video clip, a new component of the language of popular music.‚Äù Explaining, Only to Confuse, by Amauri Stamboroski Jr. Issue # 202 Dec. 2012 from Pesquisa FAPESP (San Paulo Research Foundation) Magazine From 1974 onwards, the group remained active, with only Jo√£o Ricardo as the only steady member. They have released several albums through the years. Their most recent release is an autobiographic album called \\"Chato-boy\\", featuring founding member Jo√£o Ricardo with the addition of a new member - guitarist Daniel Iasbeck. MACIEL, Luiz Carlos.

He played college football at Texas A&M; University. Early years Cannon attended Broadmoor High School where he lettered in four sports. In baseball, he played shortstop and was a two-time All-State and an All-American selection. In football he played quarterback, running back, safety, special teams and even kicked a few times. In his senior year, he received All-State and All-American honors, while helping his team to an undefeated regular season. On Halloween night in 1979, he returned a punt against Istrouma (his father's alma mater) 89 yards for a touchdown and a 20‚Äì18 win, exactly 20 years after his father had his famous 89 yard punt return for Louisiana State University to beat Ole Miss 7‚Äì3. As an 18-year-old senior with ability and a marquee name, he was a probable first-round draft choice in the 1980 Major League Baseball Draft as a shortstop/outfielder. His father had previously sent telegrams to all major league teams advising not to invest a draft selection on his son, because he was going to attend college. After the New York Yankees drafted him in the third round, teams filed grievances citing that they were misled by the telegrams, while there were secret meetings with the Yankees to negotiate a contract agreement. Then baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn vetoed the contract, forfeited the Yankees draft pick and called for a special draft to be held for his rights. The Cleveland Indians selected Cannon in the special draft. College career After the Yankees selection was voided, he committed to Texas A&M; University to the dismay of LSU fans. As a freshman, he started 6 games as a flanker, making 11 receptions for 118 yards (fourth on the team). He ranked second in the conference in kickoff returns with a 20.8-yard average. As a sophomore, he was moved to free safety and led the secondary with 58 tackles. He also had a publicized incident, after he knocked an A&M; cadet to the ground, when he threatened an SMU cheerleader with his sabre. As a junior, he played at strong safety, while registering 64 tackles (fifth on the team). He finished third in the conference in punt returns with a 9-yard average on 31 returns. As a senior, he was switched to outside linebacker, but even then as a key member of the defense, he still returned kicks and punts. He posted 60 tackles (seventh on the team), 4 sacks and 3 fumble recoveries. He finished his college career with 86 punt returns for a 7.6-yard average, one punt return touchdown and 22 kickoff returns for a 21.1-yard average. He also was a starter in the outfield for the baseball team. He was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers. Professional career Cannon was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the first round (25th overall) of the 1984 NFL draft, becoming the first player from Texas A&M; University drafted by the Cowboys. It was reported that the Washington Redskins also had him as their desired selection in the round. He was also selected by the San Antonio Gunslingers in the 1984 USFL Territorial Draft. Eight games into his rookie season, he was a reserve right outside linebacker alternating with Anthony Dickerson, when an existing congenital spinal condition was complicated after he tackled New Orleans Saints running back Wayne Wilson. He was knocked unconscious, suffered damage to two vertebrae near his neck and experienced a brief paralysis of his arms and legs. He never started and appeared in just eight games before this injury forced him to retire in order to avoid risking paralysis. Personal life Cannon filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit claiming negligence by the Cowboys, after he informed them of experiencing numbness in his upper body when making tackles. The team denied ever receiving such claims but settled in 1992. His father, Billy Cannon, was a Heisman Trophy winner who played in the American Football League.

Plot summary After a quick narration by director Stabile, as well as a flash forward, the film's plot begins with Zane, Mikey, Ray, and Chicken spending a Saturday night in Ray's basement. Throughout the film, the backgrounds of the four young men are explained by Stabile during scenes which pertain to the respected characters the most: Ray's parents died while he was young, which left him to be raised by his older brother Mark. Their upbringing together was bitter and would result in violent tendencies to grow between them. Zane grew up without a father, and had trouble staying in schools before ultimately being kicked out of his mother's house due to his behavior. Chicken developed drug habits at an early age as a result of witnessing the murder of his older brother, and his mother abandoned him when he was 15. Mikey, who experienced his parent's miserable marriage firsthand, was often humiliated and abused by the rest of the group and had at least two previous instances in which he attempted to commit suicide. Early into their night, the four get into an argument which wakes up Mark and leads to him getting into a fight with Zane. In attempt to intimidate Mark, Zane points what he believed to be an unloaded pistol at him, resulting in Mark being fatally shot by accident. The group contemplates sending Mark to a hospital or contacting authorities, however Zane instead forces the group to have the corpse be buried by his associate JoJo the Junkie out of fear of being arrested for murder. Naturally this would cause severe tensions to grow between Ray and Zane, with the two splitting the group into factions throughout the rest of the movie. After getting into a fight and avoiding getting their car towed away, the group convinces JoJo to help. JoJo, a local drug dealer with a history of violence and arrests, agrees to bury Mark's body for a payment of $500 and a severed thumb. The group spends the rest of the night doing various criminal acts in attempt to scrap up money, such as a failed drug deal and an armed robbery at a convenience store. Eventually, the group goes to Mikey's home to borrow money from his father, where they find him having an affair with another woman. Getting into a heated argument, Mikey takes Zane's pistol and kills both his father and the woman he's with, adding to the group's bodycount. Finally, Mikey manages to borrow the money from his sister. JoJo, however, refuses to bury all three bodies. Instead, the group leaves two of them at his basement and drives off with one in the trunk. They park the car nearby the beach, sleeping for the rest of the night. The next morning, Mikey leaves the group to jump off a bridge onto a freeway below, killing himself. Zane shoots Ray, and Chicken shoots Zane while he attempts to dump Ray's body in the car. Chicken finally douses the car and the bodies in gasoline, setting it on fire which kills him as well. The film concludes with Stabile explaining that he moved out of Gravesend afterwards, and that the police investigation ended after a few months of questioning. Production Gravesend initially started as a novel written by Salvatore Stabile at the age 15, with the characters partially inspired by close friends of his. Stabile, who later attended a film course at New York University, was inspired to turn the story into a movie after watching Kevin Smiths Clerks. Using $5,000 in inheritance he received from his grandmother's passing, filming for the feature began in 1994 and took about three years to complete, with only a 16mm camera utilized due to costs. Due to the tight budget, Stabile was only able to hire actors willing to perform for free. After gaining the attention of investors with the yet-to-be-finished material, Stabile was granted an addition $60,000 to use for post-production, and eventually Steven Spielberg and Oliver Stone convinced Manga Entertainment and Island Digital to distribute it after meeting Stabile. Release and reception The film made its screen debut during the 1996 Seattle International Film Festival, and it later made its European debut at the London Film Festival. After acquiring the distribution deal, the film received another screening in New York on September 5, 1997, and later began screening in Los Angeles later that month. In 1998, the film was released on home video VHS and DVD formats through Palm Pictures. =Critical Reception= On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a \\"certified fresh\\" score of 60% based on 10 critic reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of a possible four, concluding his review by stating that \\"there are flashes of life here, a feeling of immediacy in the camera style, a lot of energy--and promise. But it‚Äôs not yet the movie he‚Äôs probably capable of.\\" Writing for The New York Times, Stephen Holden criticized the movie's plot and characters, ultimately dismissing it. Soundtrack To promote the film, a soundtrack album was released through Island Records. It combines the score (composed by Bill Laswell) with tracks contributed by various artists.

Development of the SS.4 was abandoned after the prototype crashed on its second flight. Development Sergio Stefanutti had already experimented with canard aircraft with the S.C.A. SS.2 and S.C.A. SS.3 Anitra (\\"Duck\\"), light aircraft built by Stabilimento Costruzioni Aeronautiche (SCA) at Guidonia (a new city focused on aviation). The single-seat SS.2 had a canard wing configuration, fixed undercarriage and was powered with a 2-cylinder Keller engine rated at . The SS.2 first flew in 1935, and one of the two prototypes was converted into a two-seater with a larger CNA II engine built by Compagnia Nazionale Aeronautica. This new aircraft first took to the air on 2 October 1937 and was officially revealed in Milan at an international air exposition and the small fixed-undercarriage SS.2 was sent to Passignano for evaluation. Experience with this machine and the study of its aerodynamics led Stefanutti to design a canard style interceptor and air superiority fighter, designated SS.4, very similar in layout to the SS.2 and SS.3. The SS.3 had a span of and was long with an overall height of . With a engine it was capable of a maximum speed of and able to reach an altitude of altitude. Stalling speed was : A prototype SS.4 was built at the Societ√† Aeronautica Italiana - Ambrosini factory in Passignano sul Trasimeno, Umbria. The first flight took place on 7 March 1939, but in its second flight next day the aircraft crashed killing Ambrosini's chief test pilot Ambrogio Colombo. A second prototype was ordered, but development priority was placed on more easily developed wooden aircraft, and the SS.4 design was abandoned in 1942. Design The SS.4 was a single- seat fighter of all-metal construction with a canard configuration wing with twin fins mounted on the wing trailing edges, retractable tricycle undercarriage and short fuselage with rear-mounted engine driving a pusher propeller. The pilot was accommodated in an enclosed cockpit in the centre of the fuselage forward of the two fuel tanks and aft of the armament in the nose. Visibility from the cockpit was excellent to the sides and front, but restricted to the rear by the large main wing, engine and large twin fins positioned at approximately the half-span position. Flying controls consisted of elevators on the trailing edges of the canard fore-plane controlling pitch, rudders on the large fins controlling yaw and ailerons on the main wings to control roll. Pitch trim was set by adjusting a trim tab on the starboard elevator. The moderately swept, tapered, high aspect ratio wings had no sweep on the trailing edge and a cut back to give clearance for the propeller, with the large fins with rudders extending past the trailing edge at the ends of the cut-backs, to ensure enough moment to give adequate control and stability. The delta fore-plane was of low aspect ratio with the elevators sited below the trailing edge similar to the method used by contemporary Junkers aircraft like the Junkers Ju 87. The engine was a powerful liquid-cooled Isotta- Fraschini Asso XI R.C.40 engine capable of driving a three-bladed metal propeller. The engine was cooled by two radiators either side of the fuselage in ducts just behind the cockpit. Fuel for the engine was housed in two fuel tanks located mid-fuselage along with an oil tank. Armament was to be two cannon and one cannon, clustered in the nose. Operational history Colombo's memorial at the crash site. It also commemorates the \\"death\\" of the SS.4 The prototype SS.4 was built by SAI Ambrosini, Passignano sul Trasimeno, and then sent to Eleuteri airport, Castiglione del Lago, also in the Trasimeno area. There, the aircraft was successfully flown for the first time on 7 March 1939. The next day the SS.4 prototype was scheduled to be transported to Aviano airbase by rail, but Ambrosini's chief test pilot Ambrogio Colombo wanted a second test flight. After 45 minutes, an aileron malfunctioned just from Eleuteri. Colombo attempted to land but was unable to reach the runway and crashed near Campagna, hitting a tree. Colombo was killed when the engine pushed through the rear bulkhead and crushed him against the front of the cockpit. A memorial to him was erected near the site of the crash. The investigation into the crash concluded that the accident was due to imperfect construction which led to a faulty installation of the aileron which had failed. The study also pointed out the excessive vibrations transmitted by the engine to the wing.

Wehrt Euch! Kauft nicht bei Juden!\\" (\\"Germans! Defend yourselves! Don't buy from Jews!\\"). The Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses () in Germany began on April 1, 1933, and was claimed to be a defensive reaction to the Anti-Nazi Boycott,The History Place (2 July 2016), ‚ÄúTriumph of Hitler: Nazis Boycott Jewish Shops‚Äù which had been initiated in March 1933. It was largely unsuccessful, as the German population continued to use Jewish businesses, but revealed the intent of the Nazis to undermine the viability of Jews in Germany.Pauley, Bruce F (1998), From Prejudice to Persecution: A History of Austrian Anti-Semitism, University of North Carolina Press, pp. 200‚Äì203 It was an early governmental action against the Jews of Germany by the new National Socialist government, actions that culminated in the \\"Final Solution\\". It was a state-managed campaign of ever-increasing harassment, arrests, systematic pillaging, forced transfer of ownership to Nazi Party activists (managed by the Chamber of Commerce), and ultimately murder of owners defined as \\"Jews\\". In Berlin alone, there were 50,000 Jewish-owned businesses. Earlier boycotts Antisemitism in Germany grew increasingly pervasive after the First World War and was most prevalent in the universities. By 1921, the German student union Deutscher Hochschulring barred Jews from membership. Since the bar was racial, it included Jews who had converted to Christianity. The bar was challenged by the government, leading to a referendum in which 76% of the student members voted for the exclusion. At the same time, Nazi newspapers began agitating for a boycott of Jewish businesses, and anti-Jewish boycotts became a regular feature of 1920s regional German politics with right-wing German parties becoming closed to Jews. From 1931‚Äì32, SA Brownshirt thugs physically prevented customers from entering Jewish shops, windows were systematically smashed and Jewish shop owners threatened. During the Christmas holiday season of 1932, the central office of the Nazi party organized a nationwide boycott. In addition, German businesses, particularly large organizations like banks, insurance companies, and industrial firms such as Siemens, increasingly refused to employ Jews. Many hotels, restaurants and cafes banned Jews from entering and the resort island of Borkum banned Jews anywhere on the island. Such behavior was common in pre-war Europe;Karpf, Anne (8 June 2002), ‚ÄúWe've been here before‚Äù, The GuardianEncyclopedia.com (28 Sept 2008), ‚ÄúPogroms‚Äù however in Germany, it reached new heights.

In 1933, following the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service the plate was painted black by the Nazis, who boycotted Jewish-owned offices. The Anti-Nazi Boycott commencing in March 1933 was a boycott of Nazi products by foreign critics of the Nazi Party in response to antisemitism in Nazi Germany following the rise of Adolf Hitler, commencing with his appointment as Chancellor of Germany on January 30, 1933. Those in the United States, the United Kingdom and other places worldwide who opposed Hitler's policies developed the boycott and its accompanying protests to encourage Nazi Germany to end the regime's anti-Jewish practices. National boycott SA boycotting Jews, April 1, 1933 In March 1933, the Nazis won a large number of seats in the German parliament, the Reichstag. Following this victory, and partly in response to the foreign Anti-Nazi boycott of 1933,The Anti-Nazi Boycott of 1933, American Jewish Historical Society. Accessed January 22, 2009. there was widespread violence and hooliganism directed at Jewish businesses and individuals. Jewish lawyers and judges were physically prevented from reaching the courts. In some cases the SA created improvised concentration camps for prominent Jewish anti-Nazis. Joseph Goebbels, who established the Nazi Ministry of Propaganda and Public Enlightenment, announced to the Nazi party newspaper on March 31 of 1933 that \\"world Jewry\\" had ruined the reputation of the German people, and wanted to make this boycott a publicly propelled antisemitic action. On April 1, 1933, the Nazis carried out their first nationwide, planned action against Jews: a one day boycott targeting Jewish businesses and professionals, in response to the Jewish boycott of German goods. On the day of the boycott, the SA stood menacingly in front of Jewish- owned department stores and retail establishments, and the offices of professionals such as doctors and lawyers. The Propaganda Ministry wanted to catch violators of this boycott, looking to German citizens to shame other Germans who ignored the announcement and continued using Jewish stores and services. The Star of David was painted in yellow and black across thousands of doors and windows, with accompanying antisemitic slogans. Signs were posted saying \\"Don't Buy from Jews!\\" (Kauf nicht bei Juden!), \\"The Jews Are Our Misfortune!\\" (Die Juden sind unser Ungl√ºck!) and \\"Go to Palestine!\\" (Geh nach Pal√§stina!). Throughout Germany acts of violence against individual Jews and Jewish property occurred. The boycott was ignored by many individual Germans who continued to shop in Jewish-owned stores during the day. Although it marked the beginning of a nationwide campaign against the Jews, the boycott was not actually a success for the Nazis and was called off after one day as a result of the negative impact it was having on the economy. International impact The Nazi boycott inspired similar boycotts in other countries. In Poland the Endeks (founded by Roman Dmowski) organized boycotts of Jewish businesses across the country. In Quebec, French-Canadian nationalists organized boycotts of Jews in the 1930s. In the United States, Nazi supporters such as Father Charles Coughlin (a Canadian immigrant) agitated for a boycott of Jewish businesses. Coughlin's radio show attracted tens of millions of listeners and his supporters organized \\"Buy Christian\\" campaigns and attacked Jews. Also, Ivy League universities restricted the numbers of Jews allowed admission. In Austria, an organization called the Antisemitenbund had campaigned against Jewish civil rights since 1919. The organization took its inspiration from Karl Lueger, the legendary turn-of-the-century antisemitic mayor of Vienna, who inspired Hitler and had also campaigned for a boycott of Jewish businesses. Austrian campaigns tended to escalate around Christmas and became effective from 1932. As in Germany, Nazis picketed Jewish stores in an attempt to prevent shoppers from using them. In Hungary, the government passed laws limiting Jewish economic activity from 1938 onwards. Agitation for boycotts dated back to the mid-nineteenth century when Jews received equal rights. Subsequent events The national boycott operation marked the beginning of a nationwide campaign by the Nazi party against the entire German Jewish population. A week later, on April 7, 1933, the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service was passed, which restricted employment in the civil service to \\"Aryans\\". This meant that Jews could not serve as teachers, professors, judges, or in other government positions. Most Jewish government workers, including teachers in public schools and universities, were fired, while doctors followed closely behind. However, the Jews who were war veterans were excluded from dismissal or discrimination (about 35,000 German Jews died in the First World War). In 1935, the Nazis passed the Nuremberg Laws, stripping all Jews of their German citizenship, regardless of where they were born. Also, a Jewish quota of 1% was introduced for the number allowed to attend universities. In the amendment published on April 11 of Part 3 of the law, which stated that all non-Aryans were to be retired from the civil service, clarification was given: \\"A person is to be considered non- Aryan if he is descended from non-Aryan, and especially from Jewish parents or grandparents. It is sufficient if one parent or grandparent is non-Aryan. This is to be assumed in particular where one parent or grandparent was of the Jewish religion\\". \\"Jewish\\" books were publicly burnt in elaborate ceremonies, and the Nuremberg laws defined who was or was not Jewish. Jewish-owned businesses were gradually \\"Aryanized\\" and forced to sell out to non-Jewish Germans. After the Invasion of Poland in 1939, the German Nazi occupiers forced Jews into ghettos and completely banned them from public life. As World War II continued the Nazis turned to genocide, resulting in what is now known as the Holocaust.

The name Johnson is a corrupted version of the owner's name, which was really Johnston; therefore the ferry was originally called the Johnston ferry (or Johnston's ferry). A historical plaque on the present Johnson Ferry Road documents that ownership. William Marion Johnston, a Georgia native born in 1817, owned the farm at that location during the Civil War and raised thirteen children by two different wives. When he died in 1879, his grave in Marietta was robbed by a janitor from the Atlanta Medical College in order to sell the cadaver to the college. Johnson Ferry Road Johnson Ferry Road in 2017 Johnson Ferry Road -- often incorrectly referred to as \\"Johnson's Ferry Road,\\" as most other local historic ferry names end in -s or -'s -- is now a major arterial road between Cobb County and Sandy Springs. It begins in Chamblee at Georgia 141 and travels northwest, and temporarily terminates in Sandy Springs just south of I-285 at an intersection with Glenridge Drive. Then it returns just north of I-285, also at Glenridge Drive, crossing north/south Roswell Road (Georgia 9 from Atlanta) (Hammond being the original name of Sandy Springs) near its central business district. It becomes four lanes at Abernathy Road, although traffic to and from the northwest generally takes Abernathy rather than the southern leg of Johnson Ferry Road. It continues northwest with various turn lanes and descends to Riverside Drive, then crosses the river, leaving the city of Sandy Springs and crossing the county line from Fulton into Cobb. The scenery changes from tree-lined and park-like to cut-away hillsides covered with invasive kudzu vines and naturalized mimosa trees. This is the result of the 1990s widening to six lanes plus a raised median, with no replanting done except in the median. Upon reaching Paper Mill Road, the steep climb levels off and heavier local traffic begins, passing Lower Roswell Road at Parkaire and then Roswell Road (Georgia 120 from Marietta), the major crossroads of east Cobb, and one of the county's most- traveled and most accident-prone intersections. It is also a major retail business district known as Merchants Walk, for its original shopping center. North of here, it becomes residential and goes back to four lanes and a landscaped median, passing Sewell Mill Road, Post Oak Tritt Road, and then coming to Shallowford Road (not the same as another Shallowford Road in Atlanta), which is an east-west arterial road (connecting with Sandy Plains Road and the city of Roswell). This intersection is a retail business district known as Shallowford Falls. The road continues north as a neighborhood street in the Chimney Lakes neighborhood (the location of the actual \\"Shallowford Falls\\"), finally ending at Childers Road. Bridge widening The Johnson Ferry bridge was widened from four to six lanes in 2013. From Columns Drive on the northwest riverbank of the Chattahoochee River, southeast to Abernathy Road, and continuing east on Abernathy to Roswell Road (SR 9), the roads have been temporarily designated by GDOT as State Route 947.http://www.dot.ga.gov/BuildSmart/Studies/Documents/Bryan_County_Study/IJR_Report.pdf This is due to the heavy volume of rush hour traffic traveling this route to get to and from SR 400 and Perimeter Mall, and the failure of Cobb and Fulton counties to come to an agreement on their own, with Fulton at one time timing the traffic lights to cause further morning backups into Cobb. All but one of the homes along Abernathy were destroyed for widening, but the neighborhoods along the 1¬º miles or two kilometers of Johnson Ferry Road were spared. Johnson Ferry and Abernathy were \\"broken\\", such that they flow directly into each other, and now require a turn at two new intersections to stay straight on the original roads. The bridge at the former ferry location was widened between Columns Drive on the Cobb riverbank to Riverside Drive on the Fulton riverbank, from four lanes to six plus bike lanes, wide sidewalks, and a raised road median. The adjacent section of the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area is the Johnson Ferry unit. It runs along the Cobb side of the river, most of it northeast almost to Morgan Falls Dam, and a small section southwest along Columns Drive.

The botanical descriptions and illustrations became highly valued by the English audience; the finely crafted and illustrated work was of both scientific and horticultural interest. Sibthorp met the botanical illustrator Bauer in Vienna, where he had made a voyage to study a copy of Dioscorides' early botanical work, the renowned Vienna Dioscurides. This was the first part of a journey, to identify medicinal plants used in Greece; Bauer was to join the expedition as the illustrator. They were to record and collect a large number of novel specimens; their publication introduced these to an English audience. From March 1786 to December 1787 they surveyed the plants and animals of the eastern Mediterranean, Sibthorp collecting and describing, Bauer making dried specimens and producing colour-coded sketches. Bauer's work, including around a thousand intricate and annotated sketches, is now regarded as one of the finest examples of botanical illustration. Sibthorp's volumes were to become a botanical publication, the original intention to produce a herbal or medical volume was transformed into a scientific survey. An accompanying volume, Fauna Graeca, and other planned works on the region, was not realised. Sibthorp assembled the descriptions and plates, at his death in 1796 his will included an endowment to see the book published. The task of preparing the works was undertaken by James Edward Smith, who issued the two volumes of the Prodromus in 1806 and 1813, and six volumes as Flora Graeca Sibthorpiana between 1806 and 1828. The seventh appeared in 1830, after Smith's death, and the remaining three were produced by John Lindley between 1833 and 1840. Each volume contained a hundred plates, except the last, and these were engraved by James Sowerby. Only 30 copies of this set were issued, another 50 complete sets were reissued in 1845 by Henry George Bohn. The cost in 1830 was 620 pounds. The scarcity of the early first editions led to doubt of their existence, the rare book is at the higher end of trade. The inherent value has led the Bodleian Libraries to make available a digital scan of the complete set. The publication was issued with tables and indices of the scientific name, the common name in Greek was in this concordance. It was during a period of increasing interest in horticulture and highly desired exotic species were described, many would become perennials of the English flower garden.

Audio signals have frequencies in the audio frequency range of roughly 20 to 20,000 Hz, which corresponds to the lower and upper limits of human hearing. Audio signals may be synthesized directly, or may originate at a transducer such as a microphone, musical instrument pickup, phonograph cartridge, or tape head. Loudspeakers or headphones convert an electrical audio signal back into sound. Digital audio systems represent audio signals in a variety of digital formats.Hodgson, Jay (2010). Understanding Records, p.1. . An audio channel or audio track is an audio signal communications channel in a storage device or mixing console, used in operations such as multi-track recording and sound reinforcement.  Signal flow  Signal flow is the path an audio signal will take from source to the speaker or recording device. Signal flow may be short and simple as in a home audio system or long and convoluted in a recording studio and larger sound reinforcement system as the signal may pass through many sections of a large mixing console, external audio equipment, and even different rooms. Parameters Audio signals may be characterized by parameters such as their bandwidth, nominal level, power level in decibels (dB), and voltage level. The relationship between power and voltage is determined by the impedance of the signal path. Signal paths may be single-ended or balanced. Audio signals have somewhat standardized levels depending on application. Outputs of professional mixing consoles are most commonly at line level. Consumer audio equipment will also output at a lower line level. Microphones generally output at an even lower level, commonly referred to a mic level.  Digital equivalent  The digital form of an audio signal is used in audio plug-ins and digital audio workstation (DAW) software. The digital information passing through the DAW (i.e. from an audio track through a plug-in and out a hardware output) is an audio signal. A digital audio signal can be sent over optical fiber, coaxial and twisted pair cable. A line code and potentially a communication protocol is applied render a digital signal for a transmission medium. Digital audio transports include ADAT, TDIF, TOSLINK, S/PDIF, AES3, MADI, audio over Ethernet and audio over IP.

Anti-Jewish legislation in pre-war Nazi Germany comprised several laws that segregated the Jews from German society and restricted Jewish people's political, legal and civil rights. Major legislative initiatives included a series of restrictive laws passed in 1933, the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, and a final wave of legislation preceding Germany's entry into World War II.  1933 Anti-Jewish Legislation  = Enabling Act = The Enabling Act of 1933 established the power of the Nazi- led government to pass law by decree, bypassing the approval of parliament. It was passed on March 24, 1933, and effectively nullified the Weimar Constitution. = Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service = In April 1933, the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, or 'Civil Service Law', as it was more commonly known when passed, established the ability of the Nazi-led government to legally remove undesirables from the civil service profession, including doctors, teachers and lawyers. Many local governments also did not allow for the Jews to slaughter animals by way of shechita. In turn, this prevented the Jews from obeying Jewish dietary laws. This Law created the basis for the years to come, the Nazi party saw \\"racial purity [as a] condition of superior cultural creation and of the construction of a powerful state\\". The Civil Service Law was used to purify Germany through excluding Jews from key areas of the German community. The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service \\"defined the three groups of undesirable civil servants and provided for their dismissal\\". The first group included those who had been appointed after November 9, 1918, and could be removed if they did not have the proper training, which essentially meant anyone could fit into these standards. The second group were those who were deemed by their past that they would not always support the national state, e.g. members of the Communist Party, or any related or associated organisation. The third group were any \\"non-Aryans\\", a way of excluding the Jews without explicitly mentioning \\"Jews\\" in the legislation. = Law Concerning Admission to the Legal Profession = This act of legislation was also passed in April as a supplement to the Civil Service Law. This law specifically attacked judges and public prosecutors, and forbade any Jews from taking the bar exam which was necessary to become a lawyer. = Decree Regarding Physicians' Services with the National Health Service = This law affected Jewish doctors, and subsequently Jewish health care. Passed also in April, under this legislation, patients who saw a \\"non-Aryan\\" doctor would not be covered under the national health insurance, thus excluding Jewish doctors from German society. = The Law Against the Over-Crowding of German Schools = Looking to further enact their racial agenda, the Nazi party then looked toward curbing educational policy. On April 25, 1933, the Law Against the Over-Crowding of German schools was passed, and required an end to any Weimar teachings that discussed democracy and equality; it enforced the teaching of racial pride. Under the guise of a concern for educational over-crowding, the Nazis limited the number of Jewish students enrolled in German schools to 1.5% of the total enrollment. = July 1933 Citizenship and Denaturalization Law = With the goal of excluding Jews from having full citizenship rights an Advisory Committee for Population and Race Policy met at the ministry of the Interior to discuss a new citizenship law. What followed was the Denaturalization Law passed on July 14. As a result of this law, the Reich government could take away the citizenship of those who were deemed \\"undesirable\\", applying to anyone who had been given citizenship by the Weimar government. Those who saw the results of this law first were the \\"150,000 Eastern Jews in Germany\\". = Hereditary Farm Law = Passed on September 29, 1933, this law \\"excluded Jews from owning farmland or engaging in agriculture\\". It stated that only Germans could now be farmers. Though the law had minimal effect due to the lack of Jews involved in farming, it still displayed a central idea of the Nazi party that, \\"The Reich government passes this law to secure the peasant foundations of our blood line through instituting the ancient customs of land inheritance.\\" = Establishment of the Chambers of Culture = On September 29, 1933, the power of Jewish Cultural life in Germany was transferred to Joseph Goebbels, who established chambers of culture that would regulate activity in their chamber of either film, theater, music, fine arts, literature, broadcasting, and the press. The chambers of the different genres of culture were combined in their umbrella body, the Reich Chamber of Culture. Each Chamber had the power to exclude anyone involved in any of the facets of culture, even without an \\"Aryan clause\\" written into the legislation. For example, the film chamber could dismiss any Jews involved in any stages of the film-making process including the \\"producer, actors and ticket collectors in the theater\\". To continue involvement in the film industry one would need \\"licensed permission from the chamber president\\". As a supplement to the Chambers of Culture, a journalism law went into effect on October 4, 1933, stating that to produce work for the press, journalists and editors would also need specific legal permission.  Nuremberg Laws  At their annual party rally held in Nuremberg in September 1935, the Nazi leaders announced a set of three new laws to further regulate and exclude Jews from German Society. These laws now known as the Nuremberg laws served also as the legality for the arrests and violence against Jews that would come to follow. The Nuremberg Laws were created in response to Hitler's demands for broadened citizenship laws that could \\"underpin the more specifically racial-biological anti-Jewish legislation\\". They were made to reflect the party principles that had been outlined in the points Hitler had written in the National Socialist Program in 1920. = Reich Flag Law = The first law stated that black, red, and white were the national colors, and the swastika flag was the new national flag. Per Hitler, this law was stated to \\"re-pay a debt of gratitude to the movement, under whose symbol Germany regained its freedom, in that they fulfill a significant item on the program of the National Socialist Party\\". = Citizenship Law = The second law established who would be granted full political and civic rights and those who would now be deprived of them. Citizenship rights were to be granted to those who were citizens of the Reich, which were only individuals classified as being of \\"German or related blood\\"; therefore, Jews were excluded from any and all citizenship rights, becoming Staatsangeh√∂rige or state subjects, essentially making them foreigners in their own country. = The Law for the Defense of German Blood and Honour = The third law forbade marriage and any intimate extramarital relations between Jews and non-Jewish German citizens (the latter denigrated as race disgrace).Diemut Majer (2003). \\"Non-Germans\\" under the Third Reich: the Nazi judicial and administrative system in Germany and occupied Eastern Europe with special regard to occupied Poland, 1939-1945 (Uniform title: \\"Fremdv√∂lkische\\" im Dritten Reich, Boppard upon Rhine: Boldt, 1981, ), Peter Thomas Hill, Edward Vance Humphrey, and Brian Levin (translators), Lubbock, Texas: Texas Tech University Press in association with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2003, p. 102. . While the law left existing marriages between non-Jewish and Jewish spouses untouched it banned future such marriages and declared marriages by a non-Jewish German and a Jewish spouse of any nationality contracted after that ban outside of Germany invalid within the Reich. Furthermore, Jews were forbidden from employing non-Jewish German women or women of equivalent racist ranking who were under 45 years old. Under this law, Jews were also forbidden to raise the then German Flag. = Supplemental Decrees = After the Nuremberg Laws were passed, the Nazi Party also introduced supplemental decrees to the Citizenship Law and the Law for the Defense of German Blood and Honor to specifically outline who would be considered a Jew, and who would therefore be subject to the Nuremberg Laws' exclusionary principles On November 14, the first supplemental decree was published, and it defined a Jew as anyone who had at least three full Jewish grandparents, had two Jewish grandparents and were married to a Jewish spouse, belonged to the Jewish religion at the time of the law's publication, or who entered the Jewish religion later. Mischlinge or the German legal term for those who had \\"Aryan\\" and Jewish blood, were also clarified to determine who would be considered a Jew. Those that were three- quarters Jewish were Jewish as well as those who were half Jewish due to their choice of becoming Jewish via a Jewish spouse or through joining a Jewish community. A second decree was published on December 21, which stated that Jewish professors, teachers, physicians, lawyers, and notaries who were state employees, and had previously been exempt, would now be dismissed from their positions. In the first decree to the Law for the Defense of German Blood and Honour, it stated which specific marriages were forbidden. These included those \\"between a Jew and a Mischling with one Jewish Grandparent, between a Mischling and another each with one Jewish Grandparent, and between a Mischling with two Jewish Grandparents and a German\\". Post-Nuremberg legislation  = 1936 Berlin Olympic Games = In order to prevent foreign criticism of Germany, and keep the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, and to prevent economic loss and a blow to German prestige, Hitler eased the anti-Jewish stance momentarily. On December 3, all anti-Jewish signs near the site of the winter Olympics were to be removed. Though, normally, this would be considered a sign of good faith, it was, actually, only an action taken to ensure the Olympics would be held in Germany by preventing international disapproval. = Second wave of anti-Jewish legislation, 1938-1939 = After the Nuremberg Legislations and during 1938, \\"worse than total expropriation was to follow: Economic harassment and even violence would henceforward be used to force the Jews to flee the Reich or the newly annexed Austria. Within the second phase, 1938 was the fateful turning point.\\" De-certification of all Jewish physicians, who were no longer allowed to treat German patients and forced to refer to themselves as \\"sick-treaters\\", a degrading term. March 22, 1938 Jews were forbidden from owning private gardens July 27, 1938 A decree was enforced stating all streets in Germany needed to be renamed November 12, 1938 Jews were forbidden from attending movie theaters, the opera, and concerts. November 15, 1938 Jewish children barred from attending public school The essential robbery of Jews became legal when Jews were forced on February 21, 1939, to turn in all jewelry of any value. In this second wave of legislation, Jews were ostracized even further from society, with strict restrictions living under \\"a German regime that practiced terror and arbitrariness through the judicial system\\".  Kristallnacht  Kristallnacht, example of physical damage Kristallnacht or the night of broken glass refers to Jewish pogroms that took place on November 9 and 10 in 1938. This wave of violence took place in Germany, annexed Austria, and areas of Sudetenland that were occupied by Germany. These attacks took place against synagogues, Jewish-owned businesses, other Jewish establishments, and Jewish citizens in general. More than 100 Jewish people were killed, and thousands more were arrested during these attacks. This was also the start to organized Nazi attacks, and the mass incarceration of the Jews. There was no clear Instructions on how to execute the violence, so it caused the destroying of Jewish property and inhumane treatment of Jewish people. The rioters destroyed 267 synagogues throughout Germany, Austria, and Sudetenland. Firefighters were instructed to prevent the flames from spreading to nearby buildings, but not to put the fires out on the burning synagogues. There was also about 7,500 Jewish-owned establishments that were robbed and had their windows shattered. About 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and moved to prisons or concentration camps as well. What made things even worse is the fact that the German government placed full blame on the Jews for the destructions and imposed a fine of one billion Reichsmark on the Jewish community. The government also took away all insurance payouts that would go to the Jews whose businesses or homes got destroyed. This left the Jews responsible for the costs of all repairs. This led to many decrees in the weeks following. These decrees were designed to deprive the Jews of their means of living. Many of these movements enforced \\"Aryanization\\" policy. This meant that Jewish-owned property would be transferred to \\"Aryan\\" ownership for a fraction of the true value. To further remove the Jews from public life, the Jews were expelled from attending German schools, and they lost the right to have a driver's license or own an automobile. Kristallnacht was essentially the turning point in the Nazis persecution of the Jewish people. It expanded the efforts to remove Jews from German economic and social life. It also led to forced emigration of Jews in order to make Germany free of Jews. Kristallnacht and the events that followed it showed the Nazi regime that they could count on the nationwide support of anti-Semitism from the general public. This showed the Nazis that they could easily move forward with their plans without much opposition from within Germany. The events of Kristallnacht foreshadowed the Holocaust and mass murders of the Jewish people.  Timeline of anti-Jewish legislation and movements in pre-war Germany  During the pre- war Nazi Germany period (1933-1939) there were more than 400 laws, decrees and other type of regulations whose goal was to restrict Jews. There were national laws that affected all Jews, and there were state, region and city laws that only affected the Jews in those communities. These regulations limited Jews in all aspects of life, both public and private. Almost all people were involved in the support of anti-Jewish legislation in some way, whether it was passive agreement or direct involvement. These movements were all part of Hitler's intention and plan to rid the planet of all Jewish population. Hitler's plan started with stripping all Jews of their basic rights, before moving into the mass murdering of the Jewish people. 1933: * March 24: The Enabling Act was passed. This act brought an end to democracy in Germany. It gave the government the power to govern legislation by decree. It gave them the legal right to make discriminatory policies in the future. Hitler was allowed to make laws that violated the Weimar constitution without the approval of the parliament or Reich President with this act. * March 31: A decree in the city of Berlin said that Jewish doctors were suspended from the city's charity services. * April 7: There was a law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service. This law removed all Jews from government service. Also, a law on the Admission to the Legal Profession forbade the Jews from taking the bar exam, which is a test needed to become a lawyer. *April 21: Kosher slaughter outlawed * April 25: A law about over-crowded Schools and Universities limited the number of Jewish students allowed in public schools. The number of Jewish students in one school was limited to no more than 5% of the total population. The schools helped to spread Hitler's ideas. They taught students to love Hitler and to obey the authorities. * May 12: Bernheim petition to League of Nations, based on article 147 of the 1922 German‚ÄìPolish Accord on East Silesia, leads to vacation of most racial provisions of Nazi laws in German Upper Silesia.Brugel, J.

Population According to the 2002 census, the population of the commune counts 1056 inhabitants, out of which 97.7% are Romanians, 1.7% are Hungarians and 0.6% are of other or undeclared nationalities. History Traces of inhabitance on this area dating back to the paleolithic and neolithic have been found in the caverns called \\"Hoanca\\" and \\"Izoi\\". The first documentary record of Moneasa dates back to 1597, while RƒÉnu≈üa was first mentioned in 1556. Economy Moneasa is one of the county's communes that have a high economic potential. The exploitation of black and red marble, the springs of mineral waters with bicarbonate - calcic, sodic, oligomineral and semi-thermal, valorizated already in 1866, lumbering and conversion of timber, as well as the exploitation of other touristic resources are the maintainers of the local economy. Tourism The commune's primary touristic place is the Moneasa health resort. It is working all year round and it is recommended for treatment of different diseases, mainly rheumatic ones, as well as digestive and gynaecological troubles. The cavern named \\"Valea Morii\\", a natural reservation of national interest, along with the one called \\"Liliecilor\\", the water fall \\"Boroaia\\", the \\"Momu»õa\\" peak and the ruins of the blast furnace are the top sights of the commune.

He was beatified as part of Nicholas Tavelic, O.F.M. and companions, which included friars from Italy and France. All four members of his group have been declared saints by the Catholic Church, making Tavelic the first Croatian saint.  Life  Ruins of church and Franciscan monastery in Bribir, where Tavelic became a monk. Most sources mention ≈†ibenik as Tavelic's birthplace, but another possible location is Velim near Stankovci. In 1365, Tavelic became a friar in Bribir, the seat of the ≈†ubiƒá, a powerful Croatian noble family.Srednjovjekovni franjevaƒçki samostan i crkva u Bribiru Tavelic was among 60 friars from various Franciscan provinces who answered an appeal by the Bosnian guardian, motivated by a papal bull, Prae cunctis, issued in 1291 by Pope Nicholas IV, himself a Friar Minor, to work as missionaries in Bosnia, combating the perceived heresies of the Bosnian Church. Tavelic spread Catholicism around Bosnia for 12 years. In his report to the pope, the Bosnian guardian later said that the missionaries converted around 50,000 members of that Church. In 1384, Tavelic went to serve in the Custody of the Holy Land where he met the friars Deodatus Aribert of Rodez, and Stephen of Cuneo. The four lived at the Monastery of Mount Zion, the ancient friary maintained by the Friars Minor in the city, where they spent several years learning Arabic and serving at the holy sites connected to Jesus' life, which had been entrusted to the care of the Order of Friars Minor and which still drew pilgrims from Christian Europe. After having seen few, if any, conversions from the Muslim populace of the city resulting from their quiet pastoral work at the holy sites of Christianity, Tavelic and his colleagues decided to take the option given to them in the Rule of Life of their founder, Francis of Assisi, and to preach openly the Christian faith to the Muslim populace. They went to the regular gathering before the Qadi of Jerusalem and began to preach. Following their arrest for this, they refused the option to convert to Islam and were imprisoned. After again refusing to convert several days later, the group were all sentenced to death. These missionaries were executed near the Jaffa Gate on November 14, 1391, and their remains completely burned.  Veneration  The courtyard of the former Mount Zion Monastery of the Franciscan friars in Jerusalem, where St. Nikola lived. Friar Gerard Chalvet, O.F.M., was the guardian of the Jerusalem friary and saw their executions. Together with Friar Martin of ≈†ibenik, he sent a detailed report to Europe: the pope, Leipzig, ≈†ibenik and elsewhere. Tavelic and his companions were soon celebrated as martyrs by Franciscans all over Europe, especially in ≈†ibenik. Five centuries later, in 1880, Antun Josip Fosco, the Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of ≈†ibenik, started the procedure for the Holy See for the formal beatification of Tavelic. By a special decree, Pope Leo XIII recognized his ancient cultus for the ≈†ibenik Diocese in 1889 and for the entire Franciscan Order in 1898. Two years later, the same thing was done for the Holy Land. The cult of the friars, especially that of Tavelic, grew between the World Wars. The cultus of the other three martyrs was recognized by Pope Paul VI in 1966, with a separate feast day of 17 November. The four friars were canonized together by Pope Paul VI in front of 20,000 Croats in Vatican City, on June 21, 1970, with their conjoined feast day being 14 November.  Churches  Side-altar dedicated to Saint Nicholas Tavelic in the Franciscan Church of ≈†ibenik, Croatia. Most churches dedicated to Taveliƒá are located in Croatia. Some of them are in Banjevci, Cerovac, Li≈°ani, Perkoviƒá, Split, Vinjani, Zagreb, Rijeka and ≈Ωupanja.

At the outset of World War I the ship was interned by the United States and, when that country entered the conflict in 1917, was seized and converted to a troop transport. After decommissioning by the U.S. Navy, the ship was turned over to the Army Transport Service and then to the U.S. Shipping Board. She was sold for scrapping in February 1924.

She operated on both North Atlantic crossings and the Bremerhaven-Australia route. With the outbreak of World War I, she took refuge in Hoboken, New Jersey, and was interned by the United States. She was seized when the United States entered the war 6 April 1917. =U.S. Navy transport= Damage inflicted by her crew prior to seizure was repaired and she was commissioned on 3 August 1917, with Cmdr.

Before the armistice, she had completed seven voyages to France, carrying over 18,000 passengers. After the armistice, she reversed the flow of troops, making eight crossings to return more than 20,000 to the United States. Postwar service After completing her last crossing as a U.S. Navy ship on 19 September 1919, she decommissioned and on 27 September 1919 was turned over to the Army Transport Service for use as an Army transport. The Army in turn transferred her to the U.S. Shipping Board in August 1920. Mercury was chartered by the Baltic SS Corp of America for a proposed service between New York and Danzig, however the service never operated and the ship was returned to the Shipping Board in January 1921, when she was laid up.

The parade held on Saturday morning features the newly crowned Slug Queen. The event has not been held since 2015. Featuring bands and performers from throughout the Pacific Northwest, the three-day festival has been held in early September.  History  The Celebration was created in 1983 as a way to bring together members of the Eugene community for a weekend of music and festivities to celebrate the opening of the $22.5 million Hult Center for the Performing Arts. It attracted as many as 57,000 attendees in 2011. The event was originally sponsored by the city, and for a few years had corporate sponsorship of Centennial Bank. It was managed from 1999 through 2005 by Downtown Events Management, Inc. (DEMI), a Eugene-based non-profit corporation. Management was awarded to Kesey Enterprises, a for-profit company, for the 2013 celebration. Eugene Celebration has brought attention to community issues and concerns regarding environmental responsibility within the greater context of a weekend festival. Recurring features at the celebration include the \\"Community Causeway\\" where nonprofit, charitable and advocacy organizations promote their services and, as of 2007, the \\"Sustainability Village\\" where Celebration participants can learn about sustainable lifestyle choices. A related event, the coronation of the SLUG Queen, occurs prior to the event. In 2014, the event's management company, Kesey Enterprises, initially released a statement in June cancelling the August Celebration, citing new construction and growth in Eugene's revitalized downtown that reduced the space needed for entertainment and food venues. Kesey Enterprises later agreed to partner with the City of Eugene to host a $5 concert at the Cuthbert Amphitheater during the weekend. A free alternative \\"Festival of Eugene\\" at Skinner Butte Park was organized by Krysta Albert, who persisted despite a saga of funding and location uncertainties lasting as late as two weeks before the event. The Festival included \\"health and wellness vendors, nonprofit groups, food booths, live music and poetry readings.\\" The Eugene Celebration Parade featured Lane Community College as the grand marshal, and included 70 groups of \\"school bands and dance troupes, the 2014 Slug Queen and his entourage, the fencers, roller derby skaters and belly dancers, and the primarily liberal politicians and political causes.\\"  References   External links  *Eugene Celebration (official website)  Gallery  image:Eugene Celebration-6.jpg image:Eugene Celebration-7.jpg image:Eugene Celebration Bed Races-3.jpg image:Eugene Celebration Parade-4.jpg image:Eugene Celebration Parade-6.jpg image:Eugene Celebration Parade-7.jpg image:Eugene Celebration Parade-10.jpg Festivals in Eugene, Oregon 1983 establishments in Oregon Annual events in Eugene, Oregon ","title":"Eugene Celebration"},{"id":"12812556","text":"Rhinolithodes wosnessenskii, also called the rhinoceros crab or golf-ball crab, is a species of king crab, the only species in the genus Rhinolithodes.

The book The 'Thaw' in Bulgarian Literature (1981) add the contextual information that his work was censored by the communist state in the 1970s, talking of: \\"Lyuben Dilov's censored science fiction novels.\\" Works Dilov was an author of over 35 books, these being novels for adults, and short story collections. He also wrote some novels for a juvenile audience. His work strove to consciously resemble that of the famous American science fiction writer Clifford D. Simak, and he stated that: \\"I am the Bulgarian Cliff Simak\\".Science Fiction Studies, 1980. By 1990 the official state English language journal Bulgarian Horizons: A Quarterly of Literature, Art and Science stated, of his reputation in Bulgaria at that time, that: \\"Lyuben Dilov is a fiction writer with a fine sense of plot, with a tendency to rationalize socially and philosophically world[-spanning] processes, and with a superb sense of humour\\". His books were translated into neighbouring languages such as Russian, Czech, Polish, German and Hungarian. In his novel The Trip of Icarus (1974) Dilov described the Fourth Law of Robotics, extending the original Three Laws proposed by Isaac Asimov to include: A robot must establish its identity as a robot in all cases.\\" Another Fourth Law of Robotics was proposed by Harry Harrison in the tribute anthology Foundation's Friends in 1989. Dilov stated that the reason for the fourth safeguard was that: \\"The last Law has put an end to the expensive aberrations of designers to give psychorobots as humanlike a form as possible. And to the resulting misunderstandings...\\" In English translation His story Contacts of a Fourth Kind was included in the English language multi-writer novel Tales from the Planet Earth. His story ‚ÄúThe Stranger‚Äù was translated into English in full, and can be found in the book Introduction to modern Bulgarian literature (1969). = Novels = * ¬´–ê—Ç–æ–º–Ω–∏—è—Ç —á–æ–≤–µ–∫¬ª ‚Äî 1958 * ¬´–ö–ª–∞–¥–µ–Ω–µ—Ü—ä—Ç –Ω–∞ —Ç–∞–ª–∞—Å—ä–º–∏—Ç–µ¬ª ‚Äî 1963 * ¬´–ü–æ–º–Ω—è —Ç–∞–∑–∏ –ø—Ä–æ–ª–µ—Ç¬ª ‚Äî 1964 * ¬´–ú–Ω–æ–≥–æ—Ç–æ –∏–º–µ–Ω–∞ –Ω–∞ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ö–∞¬ª ‚Äî 1967 * ¬´–¢–µ–∂–µ—Å—Ç—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ —Å–∫–∞—Ñ–∞–Ω–¥—ä—Ä–∞¬ª ‚Äî 1969 * ¬´–ü—ä—Ç—è—Ç –Ω–∞ –ò–∫–∞—Ä¬ª ‚Äî 1974 * ¬´–ü–∞—Ä–∞–¥–æ–∫—Å—ä—Ç –Ω–∞ –æ–≥–ª–µ–¥–∞–ª–æ—Ç–æ¬ª ‚Äî 1976 * ¬´–ó–≤–µ–∑–¥–Ω–∏—Ç–µ –ø—Ä–∏–∫–ª—é—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –Ω–∞ –ù—É–º–∏ –∏ –ù–∏–∫–∏¬ª ‚Äî 1980 * ¬´–ü—Ä–æ–ø—É—Å–Ω–∞—Ç–∏—è—Ç —à–∞–Ω—Å. –ò–∑ —Å—ä—á–∏–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—è—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ –º–æ—è –∫–æ–º–ø—é—Ç—ä—Ä¬ª ‚Äî 1981 * ¬´–ù–µ–∑–∞–≤—ä—Ä—à–µ–Ω–∏—è—Ç —Ä–æ–º–∞–Ω –Ω–∞ –µ–¥–Ω–∞ —Å—Ç—É–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∫–∞¬ª ‚Äî 1982 * ¬´–î–æ –†–∞–π—Å–∫–∞—Ç–∞ –ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç–∞ –∏ –Ω–∞–∑–∞–¥. –î—Ä—É–≥–∏—Ç–µ –ø—Ä–∏–∫–ª—é—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –Ω–∞ –ù—É–º–∏ –∏ –ù–∏–∫–∏¬ª ‚Äî 1983 * ¬´–ñ–µ—Å—Ç–æ–∫–∏—è—Ç –µ–∫—Å–ø–µ—Ä–∏–º–µ–Ω—Ç¬ª ‚Äî 1985 * ¬´–ë–∏–±–ª–∏—è—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ –õ–∏–ª–∏—Ç¬ª ‚Äî 1999 * ¬´–ì–æ–ª—è–º–∞—Ç–∞ —Å—Ç—ä–ø–∫–∞¬ª ‚Äî 1999 * ¬´–î–µ–º–æ–Ω—ä—Ç –Ω–∞ –ú–∞–∫—Å—É–µ–ª¬ª ‚Äî 2001 * ¬´–î–∞ –∏–∑–±–µ—Ä–µ—à —Å–µ–±–µ —Å–∏¬ª ‚Äî 2002 = Stories and Short Stories = * ¬´–ù–∞–ø—Ä–µ–¥, —á–æ–≤–µ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ!¬ª ‚Äî 1971 * ¬´–¶—è–ª–∞—Ç–∞ –∏—Å—Ç–∏–Ω–∞ –æ–∫–æ–ª–æ —à–∏–º–ø–∞–Ω–∑–µ—Ç–æ –¢–æ–ø—Å–∏¬ª ‚Äî 1976 * ¬´–ù–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ–¥–∏—à–Ω–∞ —Ç—Ä–∞–≥–µ–¥–∏—è¬ª ‚Äî 1978 * ¬´–°—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω–∏—Ç–µ –∫–∞—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –Ω–∞ –ë–æ—Ä–∏—Å –õ–µ–≤–∏—Ç–∞—à–∫–∏¬ª ‚Äî 1979 * ¬´–ï–∫—Å–ø–µ—Ä–∏–º–µ–Ω—Ç –≤ –∫—Ä–∏–º–∏–Ω–∞–ª–Ω–∏—è –∂–∞–Ω—Ä¬ª ‚Äî 1981 * ¬´–û–≥—Ä–∞–±–µ–Ω–∞—Ç–∞ –∏—Å—Ç–∏–Ω–∞¬ª ‚Äî 1981 * ¬´–ü—Ä–µ–¥–∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ –µ–¥–Ω–æ –∑–∞–±–æ–ª—è–≤–∞–Ω–µ¬ª ‚Äî 1981 References External links * http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?133022 * https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1424706/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1 Bulgarian science fiction writers 1927 births 2008 deaths People from Cherven Bryag ","title":"Lyuben Dilov"},{"id":"12812600","text":"Nazi Agent is a 1942 American spy film directed by Jules Dassin, in his first feature-length film for MGM. It stars Conrad Veidt playing identical twins, one loyal to the United States (U.S.), the other a dedicated German Nazi.Eames 1982, p. 172. Plot The U.S. has not yet entered World War II when kindly stamp dealer Otto Becker (Conrad Veidt) is unexpectedly visited by his twin brother, Baron Hugo von Detner, the new German consul to the U.S. and one of the leaders of a spy ring engaged in sabotage. The brothers have not seen each other in years, but now von Detner wants to use Becker's shop to transmit and receive secret messages. Becker refuses, until von Detner threatens to have him deported back to Germany as an illegal immigrant and reveals that Becker's assistant, Miss Harper (Dorothy Tree), is actually a German agent. Becker becomes a prisoner in his own store, watched constantly. When he gives his good friend and fellow stamp enthusiast, Professor Jim Sterling (Ivan F. Simpson), a message to go to the police, Sterling is killed in a \\"traffic accident\\". Von Detner then comes to deal with the betrayal by his brother; the two men struggle and the Nazi is shot dead. Thinking quickly, Becker assumes von Detner's identity. Nobody detects the substitution except Fritz (Frank Reicher), an old family servant and lately von Detner's butler. However, he is faithful to Becker and keeps his secret. Meanwhile, as he continues to pass as von Detner, Becker starts feeding what he learns about the spy ring's operations to the police via anonymous telephone calls. Becker becomes acquainted with Kaaren De Relle (Anne Ayars). She had been a secret agent loyal to the Nazis, but has become disillusioned by what she has seen and now continues with her duties for the spy ring only to prevent the Nazis from taking retribution against her family still in occupied France. She had spurned von Detner's romantic advances in the past. However, she finds the baron changed, and for the better, when Becker shows sympathy for her plight. Information provided by Becker foils a plot to blow up a freighter loaded with explosive chemicals in the Panama Canal. He also learns the names of German agents working in America; he mails the list, omitting De Relle's name, to the FBI. Amid the betrayal and failure of their plans, some members of the spy ring turn against and kill each other; others are arrested. Eventually, the only ones left are Becker, De Relle and Kurt Richten (Martin Kosleck), von Detner's aide at the embassy. Aware now of Becker's true identity and the fact that he was the informant, Richten threatens to punish him by notifying the authorities that De Relle is a spy. Becker sacrifices himself to save De Relle by offering to allow Richten to become Nazi hero by taking Becker, still posing as Consul von Detmer, back to Germany to be turned over to the Nazis as a traitor.

Reception The New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther wrote, \\"The story turns entirely on a neat melodramatic trick. Mr. Veidt as a simple, unpretentious and loyal naturalized American is coerced by his twin, a Nazi consul, into assisting with some spy activities. But the moment comes when he is able to kill his brother without any one seeing the deed, and he takes this opportunity to place himself in the evil brother's shoes. His purpose thereby is, of course, to spy upon the spies ...\\"Crowther, Bosley. \\"Movie review: ' Nazi Agent,' an unpretentious but intriguing spy film, with Conrad Veidt in dual roles, opens at the Rialto.\\" The New York Times, June 13, 1942.

Life He was the eldest son of Nicholas Bagenal and Eleanor Griffith, daughter of Sir Edward Griffith of Penrhyn. His brother was Dudley Bagenal. Bagenal probably matriculated from Jesus College, Oxford when he was 16 (in 1572 or 1573), but left without taking a degree in order to join his father Sir Nicholas who was then marshal of the army in Ireland. In May 1577, Sir Nicholas was appointed chief commissioner of Ulster, with Henry as his assistant. Bagenal was himself knighted in 1578. He was involved in some military disasters, such as a defeat at Glenmalure on 25 August 1580 when Lord Grey led the troops (with Bagenal one of the commanders of the rear) into battle with Fiach McHugh O'Byrne and Viscount Baltinglass in the Wicklow mountain passes. In 1584, Bagenal was colonel of the garrison at Carrickfergus when 1,300 of Sorley Boy MacDonnell's Scots landed on Rathlin Island. Bagenal attacked but was ambushed at Glenarm and had to retreat. In May 1586, Bagenal was sent by his father to the court to report. He sought measures to weaken Hugh O'Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone, an enhancement of the role of the marshal, and a presidency in Ulster with a shire hall and jail to dispense royal justice. Whilst on his visit, he wrote to Edward Manners, 3rd Earl of Rutland (a relative of his wife) on 16 September 1586 to ask whether he had a parliamentary borough to spare; he was elected MP for both Grantham and Anglesey and chose the latter. He returned to Ireland in September 1587 to deputize for his father. He succeeded his father as marshal of the army in Ireland and chief commissioner for Ulster in October 1590, and was sworn of the Privy Council. His proposals for action were not accepted, as a decision had been taken to adopt a conciliatory attempt to O'Neill. To Bagenal's contempt, O'Neill asked for the hand of Bagenal's sister Mabel in marriage; he refused, but they eloped anyway. In May 1595, Bagenal led an army of 1,750 to relieve the garrison at Monaghan. His forces were attacked by O'Neill and sustained heavy losses. Bagenal was forced to withdraw to Newry and had to be resupplied by sea as O'Neill had blocked the Moyry Pass. Bagenal managed to resupply the Armagh garrison in December 1598 and June 1597, but had more difficulty in resupplying a fort on the Blackwater. In an attempt to do so, he was mortally wounded by O'Neill's forces during Battle of the Yellow Ford. Family He married Eleanor Savage, daughter of Sir John Savage and Elizabeth Manners, daughter of Thomas Manners, 1st Earl of Rutland. They had three sons and six daughters. The senior Bagenal line died out in 1712 with the death of Nicholas Bagenal; the junior but better known branch in Carlow, who founded Bagenalstown, survived longer. Legacy Brian Friel's play Making History turns largely on the marriage between Henry's sister Mabel and Hugh O'Neill. Mabel and another sister, Mary Barnewall, are major characters in the play. Henry himself is mentioned often but does not appear on stage.

Sustainable food systems start with the development of sustainable agricultural practices, development of more sustainable food distribution systems, creation of sustainable diets and reduction of food waste throughout the system.Sustainable food systems have been argued to be central to many or all 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Moving to sustainable food systems is an important component of addressing the causes of climate change. A 2020 review conducted for the European Union found that up to 37% of global greenhouse gas emissions could be attributed to the food system, including crop and livestock production, transportation, changing land use (including deforestation) and food loss and waste. Sustainable food systems are frequently at the center of sustainability focused policy programs, such as proposed Green New Deal programs.  Definition  There are many different definitions of a sustainable food system. From a global perspective, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations describes a sustainable food system as follows: The American Public Health Association (APHA) defines a sustainable food system as: The European Union's Scientific Advice Mechanism defines a sustainable food system as a system that:  Academic discipline  The study of sustainable food applies systems theory and methods of sustainable design towards food systems. As an interdisciplinary field, the study of sustainable food systems has been growing in the last several decades.

The European Commission's 'Farm to Fork strategy for a sustainable food system', due to be published in spring 2020, is expected to lay out how European countries will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect biodiversity, reduce food waste and chemical pesticide use, and contribute to a circular economy. In , the EU's Scientific Advice Mechanism delivered to European Commissioners a Scientific Opinion on how to transition to a sustainable food system, informed by an evidence review report undertaken by European academies.  Problems with conventional food systems  Industrial agriculture causes environmental impacts, as well as health problems associated with obesity in the rich world and hunger in the poor world. This has generated a strong movement towards healthy, sustainable eating as a major component of overall ethical consumerism.Mason, J. & Singer, P. (2006). The Way We Eat: Why Our Food Choices Matter. London: Random House. Conventional food systems are largely based on the availability of inexpensive fossil fuels, which is necessary for mechanized agriculture, the manufacture or collection of chemical fertilizers, the processing of food products, and the packaging of foods. Food processing began when the number of consumers started growing rapidly. The demand for cheap and efficient calories climbed resulting in nutrition decline.Nestle, Marion. (2013). Food Politics: How the Food Industry Influences Nutrition and Health.\\" Los Angeles, California: University of California Press. Industrialized agriculture, due to its reliance on economies of scale to reduce production costs, often leads to the compromising of local, regional, or even global ecosystems through fertilizer runoff, nonpoint source pollution,(1993); Schnitkey, G.D., Miranda, M.; \\"The Impact of Pollution Controls on Livestock Crop producers\\", Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics and greenhouse gas emission. Also, the need to reduce production costs in an increasingly global market can cause production of foods to be moved to areas where economic costs (labor, taxes, etc.) are lower or environmental regulations are more lax, which are usually further from consumer markets. For example, the majority of salmon sold in the United States is raised off the coast of Chile, due in large part to less stringent Chilean standards regarding fish feed and regardless of the fact that salmon are not indigenous in Chilean coastal waters.(2001); Bjorndal, T., \\"The Competitiveness of the Chilean Salmon Aquaculture Industry\\", Foundation for Research in Economics and Business Administration, Bergen, Norway The globalization of food production can result in the loss of traditional food systems in less developed countries, and have negative impacts on the population health, ecosystems, and cultures in those countries.(1996); Kuhnlein, H.V., Receveur, O.; Dietary Change and Traditional Food Systems of Indigenous Peoples; Centre for Nutrition and the Environment of Indigenous Peoples, and School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition, McGill University, Quebec, Canada  Sourcing sustainable food  At the global level the environmental impact of agribusiness is being addressed through sustainable agriculture and organic farming. At the local level there are various movements working towards local food production, more productive use of urban wastelands and domestic gardens including permaculture, urban horticulture, local food, slow food, sustainable gardening, and organic gardening.\\"Earth Stats.\\" Gardensofbabylon.com.

At the same time, current and future food systems need to be provided with sufficient nutrition for not only the current population, but future population growth in light of a world affected by changing climate in the face of global warming.  Food waste  According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), food waste is responsible for 8 percent of global human-made greenhouse gas emissions. The FAO concludes that nearly 30 percent of all available agricultural land in the world - 1.4 billion hectares - is used for produced but uneaten food. The global blue water footprint of food waste is 250 km3, that is the amount of water that flows annually through the Volga or 3 times Lake Geneva.  References   Further reading   * AGRIS record.

Early life and career Fineux was the son of William Fyneux of Swingfield, Kent, his mother's name being Monyngs. The family of Fyneux or Fineux (sometimes also written Finiox or Fineaux) was of great antiquity in Kent. The judge is said by Fuller, on the authority of one of his descendants, a certain Thomas Fyneux, to have begun the study of law at the age of twenty-eight, to have practised at the bar for twenty-eight years, and to have sat on the bench for the same period. As he died not earlier than 1526, he must, if Fuller's statements are correct, have been born about 1441. He was a member of Gray's Inn and a reader there, though the dates of his admission, call, and reading are alike uncertain. He was appointed in 1474 one of the commissioners for administering the marsh lands lying between Tenterden and Lydd, and in 1476 seneschal of the manors of the prior and chapter of Christ Church, Canterbury. This is probably the origin of David Lloyd's statement that he 'was steward of 129 manors at once' (Christ Church Letters, Camden Soc. p. 95). On 20 November 1485 he was called to the degree of serjeant-at-law, his motto for the occasion being \\"Quisque suae fortunae faber\\". This is the earliest recorded instance of a motto being assumed by a serjeant on occasion of his call. In 1486 he was sworn of the council. On 18 May 1488 he was appointed steward of Dover Castle, on 10 May 1489 he received a commission of justice of assize for Norfolk, and on 14 August following he was appointed king's serjeant. Lloyd says that he opposed the subsidy of a tithe of rents and goods demanded for the expenses of the war in Brittany. This must have been in 1488‚Äì9. Judicial career On 11 February 1493-4 he was raised to the bench as a puisne judge of the common pleas, when on 24 November 1495 he was transferred to the chief- justiceship of the king's bench. He was one of the triers of petitions in the parliament of 1496, and the same year was joined with the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Archbishop of York and certain other peers as feoffee of certain manors in Staffordshire, Berkshire, Wiltshire, Kent, and Leicestershire to the use of the king. He was one of the executors of the will of Cardinal Morton, who died in 1500. In 1503 he was again a trier of petitions in parliament, and was enfeoffed of certain other manors to the uses of the king's will. In the act of parliament declaring the feoffment he is for the first time designated 'knight.' In 1509 he was appointed one of the executors of the king's will. He was also a trier of petitions in the parliament of 1515. Benefit of clergy In 1512 an act had been passed depriving all murderers and felons not in holy orders of benefit of clergy. This act, though its duration was limited to a single year, was vehemently denounced by Richard Kidderminster, abbot of Winchcombe, in a sermon preached at Paul's Cross in 1505, as altogether contrary to the law of God and the liberties of the church. The defence of the act was undertaken by Standish, warden of the Friars Minors. The general question of the amenability of the clergy to the temporal courts was thus raised and hotly debated, the controversy being further exacerbated by a murder committed by the direction of the Bishop of London on one Richard Hunne, who had rendered himself obnoxious to the clergy. The ferment of the public mind being general and extreme, the judges and the council were assembled by order of the king first at Blackfriars and subsequently at Baynard's Castle, for a solemn conference upon the entire question. On the latter occasion a very dramatic incident occurred in which Fineux played a principal part. Towards the close of the debate the Archbishop of Canterbury cited the authority of 'divers holy fathers' against the pretensions of the temporal courts to try clerical offenders; to which Fineux replied that 'the arraignment of clerks had been maintained by divers holy kings, and sundry good holy fathers of the church had been obedient and content with the practice of the law on this point; which it was not to be presumed they would have been if they had believed or supposed that it was altogether contrary to the law of God; on the other hand they [the clergy] had no authority by their law to arraign any one of felony.' The archbishop having interposed that they had sufficient authority, but without saying when or whence they derived it, Fineux continued that 'in the event of a clerk being arrested by the secular power and then committed to the spiritual court at the instance of the clergy, the spiritual court had no jurisdiction to decide the case, but had only power to do with him according to the intention and purpose for which he had been remitted to them.' To this, the archbishop making no reply, the king said : 'By the ordinance and sufferance of God . . . we intend to maintain the right of our crown, and of our temporal jurisdiction, as well in this point as in all other points, in as ample a manner as any of our progenitors have done before our time; and as for your decrees, we are well assured that you of the spirituality yourselves act expressly against the tenor of them, as has been well shown to you by some of our spiritual council, wherefore we will not comply with your desires more than our progenitors in times past have done.' Shortly after this emphatic declaration, the assembly was dissolved. Fineux's statement of the law on this occasion was referred to by Lord Chancellor Ellesmere in the case of the Post nati in 1608 as a precedent in favour of the authority of the extrajudicial opinions of judges then beginning to be seriously impugned. Later career and death In 1522 Fineux was elected into the fraternity of the Augustinian Eremites of Canterbury. There is evidence that he was living on 5 February 1526‚Äì7; but he likely died or retired in that year.

Description and significance  As its Latin name Pyrobaculum (the \\"fire stick\\") suggests, the archaeon is rod-shaped and isolated from locations with high temperatures. It is Gram-negative and its cells are surrounded by an S-layer of protein subunits. P. aerophilum is a hyperthermophilic and metabolically versatile organism. Different from other hyperthermophiles, it can live in the presence of oxygen and grows efficiently in microaerobic conditions. Pyrobaculum yellowstonensis strain WP30 was obtained from an elemental sulfur sediment (Joseph's Coat Hot Spring [JCHS], 80¬∞C, pH 6.1, 135 ŒºM As) in Yellowstone National Park (YNP), USA and is a chemoorganoheterotroph and requires elemental sulfur and/or arsenate as an electron acceptor. Growth in the presence of elemental sulfur and arsenate resulted in the formation of thioarsenates and polysulfides. The complete genome of this organism was sequenced (1.99 Mb, 58% G+C content), revealing numerous metabolic pathways for the degradation of carbohydrates, amino acids, and lipids. Multiple dimethyl sulfoxide-molybdopterin (DMSO-MPT) oxidoreductase genes, which are implicated in the reduction of sulfur and arsenic, were identified. Pathways for the de novo synthesis of nearly all required cofactors and metabolites were identified. The comparative genomics of P. yellowstonensis and the assembled metagenome sequence from JCHS showed that this organism is highly related (‚àº95% average nucleotide sequence identity) to in situ populations. The physiological attributes and metabolic capabilities of P. yellowstonensis provide an important foundation for developing an understanding of the distribution and function of these populations in YNP.  Genome structure  The first Pyrobaculum species to be sequenced was P. aerophilum. Its circular genome sequence is 2,222,430 Bp in length and contains 2605 protein-encoding sequences (CDS).  Cell structure and metabolism  Under anaerobic conditions, the archaeon reduces nitrate to molecular nitrogen via the denitrification pathway. Most species grow either chemolithoautotrophically by sulfur reduction or organotrophically by sulfur respiration or by fermentation. Cells are rod-shaped with almost rectangular ends and are about 1.5-8 * 0.5-0.6 ¬µm. Pyrobaculum is motile because of peritrichous or bipolar polytrichous flagellation, and its colonies are round and grey to greenish black. The species are either faculatively aerobic or strictly anaerobic. The growth was observed on yeast extract, peptone, extract of meat, but not on galactose, glucose, maltose, starch glycogen, ethanol, methanol, formamide, formate, malate, propionate, lactate, acetate, and casamino acids. The first of the Pyrobaculum species to be genetically sequenced, P. aerophilum (rod- shaped, 3-8 * 0.6 ¬µm), has a rare characteristic for an archaeon because it is capable of aerobic respiration (aerophilum = \\"air-loving\\"). This is evident from the fact that the archaeon grew only in the presence of oxygen when nitrate was absent. It produces colonies that are round and greyish yellow. It utilizes both organic (maximal cell densities were observed with complex organics such as yeast extract, meat extract, tryptone, and peptone as substrates) and inorganic compounds during aerobic and anaerobic respiration. Also, use of elemental sulphur for growth was observed. Further, P. aerophilum grows between 75 and 104 ¬∞C with an optimal growth temperature at 100 ¬∞C.  Ecology  To this date, the strains of Pyrobaculum have been isolated from neutral to slightly alkaline boiling solfataric waters and shallow marine hydrothermal systems. P. aerophilum was isolated from a boiling marine water hole at Maronti Beach, Ischia, Italy. Further studies show that P. aerophilum grows under strictly anaerobic conditions with nitrate as the electron acceptor.See the NCBI webpage on Pyrobaculum.

According to Conrad Schnitzler in a 1980 interview he gave to David Elliott an advertisement by an organist interested in new music led to the recording session being sponsored by a church. Kluster was required to add religious text to the first side of the album to obtain this sponsorship. The text was read by Manfred Paethe. The text was written by Rudolf Bohren, Kurt Marti, Dorothee Solle, Rudolf Otto Weimer, Lisolette Rauner and Hilde Domin. Schnitzler describes the text: \\"If you don't understand the German words, it sounds better.

It stars Fernando Fern√°n-G√≥mez, Cayetana Guill√©n Cuervo and Rafael Alonso. The film, an adaptation of the novel of the same title by Benito P√©rez Gald√≥s, tells the story of an aristocrat's search to discover which of his two putative granddaughters resulted from an extramarital affair by his daughter-in-law. Plot Don Rodrigo, Count of Albrit, an old Spanish aristocrat, returns to turn-of-the-20th-century Spain after losing his fortune in America. The death of his only son has made him come back to his family estate, now in possession of his daughter-in-law Lucrecia. Upon his return, Don Rodrigo is pleased to meet his granddaughters, Dolly and Nelly, both of whom are adorable and attentive towards him. However, there is something nagging Don Rodrigo. His son died heartbroken after he discovered his wife was having an affair with a Parisian painter and he left a letter stating that one of the girls is an illegitimate child, not of his blood, and therefore not entitled to be his true heir or true successor to his name and country estate. To the Count of Albrit, it is a matter of honor to know which of the girls is his real granddaughter. To uncover the truth, he confronts his son's widow, Lucrecia. Lucrecia, now 32, is an English-born beauty with a scandalous reputation, who married the Count‚Äôs son when she was 18 and was unfaithful to her husband during their marriage, having an affair with a Parisian painter. Confronting her, the Count of Albrit, who opposed the match, tells her she killed his son, who died of sadness, loneliness, and shame brought on by her infidelity. Lucrecia replies that life is complicated, as are the emotions between men and women. In any case, she vehemently refuses to discuss the matter of her daughter‚Äôs paternity. Lucrecia is well connected. Her latest liaison with Jaime, a government minister, has benefited the village in which her lands lie. When she sees her family relationships and a future move from the provinces to Madrid threatened, she tries to use her standing with the town‚Äôs authorities and the local clergy to thwart the old man in his quest. Their plan is to have the Count of Albrit confined in a nearby monastery, but the still-formidable Don Rodrigo quickly realizes their intentions and manages to escape their trap. He reminds some of the smarmy villagers of their checkered past in the days when the Count of Albrit was a power to be reckoned with. During his quest to find the true origin of his granddaughters, the Count of Albrit befriends the girl‚Äôs teacher, poor old P√≠o Coronado. Too kind for his own good and saddled with six unseen but abusive and sluttish daughters, Coronado would like to kill himself, but he lacks the courage. The straightforward Count tells the tutor that he will be only too happy to toss him off a cliff into the sea, whenever Coronado is ready. In the meantime, Sen√©n, a mercenary servant, offers an incriminating love letter for sale. The letter implies that Dolly, the eldest of the two girls, who all along has defended forcefully the well being of her grandfather, is the legitimate child. With this piece of information, Don Rodrigo confronts his daughter in law once again. He asks her to allow him to live with Dolly in the family rural estate, but Lucrecia refuses to be parted from any of her daughters without admitting the truth about Dolly‚Äôs paternity. Soon after, Lucrecia‚Äôs confessor reveals to Don Rodrigo that he has been in the wrong. Nelly is his biological granddaughter. Finally reconciling with the Count of Albrit, Lucrecia leaves for Madrid with Nelly. Dolly stays behind with don Rodrigo, who has his wishes fulfilled. Pio Coronado buries his suicidal intentions.

She was the only whaleback ship ever built for passenger service. The ship was designed by Alexander McDougall, the developer and promoter of the whaleback design. Columbus was built between 1892 and 1893 at Superior, Wisconsin, by the American Steel Barge Company. Initially, she ferried passengers to and from the World's Columbian Exposition. Later, she provided general transportation and excursion services to various ports around the lakes. At , the ship was the longest whaleback ever built, and reportedly also the largest vessel on the Great Lakes when she was launched. Columbus is said to have carried more passengers during her career than any other vessel on the Great Lakes. After a career lasting four decades, she was retired during the Great Depression and scrapped in 1936 by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company at Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Note: follow URL, then search by vessel name \\"Christopher Columbus\\" to find page with stats cited. Background and proposal The history of the Columbus is linked with that of the whalebacks, an innovative but not widely accepted ship design of the late 1880s, and of their designer, Alexander McDougall. A Scottish immigrant, Great Lakes captain, inventor and entrepreneur, McDougall developed the idea of the whaleback as a way to improve the ability of barges to follow a towing vessel in heavy seas. Whalebacks were characterized by distinctive hull shapes with rounded tops, lacking conventional vertical sides. Waves thus broke across their hulls with considerably less force than when striking a conventional hull. Water could also flow around the rounded turrets which resembled gun turrets on contemporary warships; the superstructure and deckhouses were mounted on these turrets. (definition 65, Whaleback). The rounded contours of whalebacks gave them an unconventional appearance, and McDougall's ship and barge designs were received with considerable skepticism, resistance, and derision. As they had porcine-looking snouts for bows, some observers called them \\"pig boats\\". Google books has images of those pages in the chapter entitled The Turret Steamship. Retrieved on 2008-03-26. After McDougall was unable to persuade existing shipbuilders to try his designs, he founded the American Steel Barge Company in Superior, Wisconsin in 1888, and built them himself. McDougall actively promoted his design and company by sending the SS Charles W. Wetmore to London, and starting another shipyard in Everett, Washington, which built the SS City of Everett. When the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, to be held in Chicago, Illinois, was in the planning stages, McDougall recognized another opportunity to publicize his design. The Columbus, conceived as an elaborate ferry, was intended to demonstrate that the whaleback design would work well in passenger service, and would be able to travel at high speed. The ship's name honored the explorer Christopher Columbus as did the World's Columbian Exposition itself, timed to coincide with the 400th anniversary of his first voyage to the New World. Construction and Columbian Exposition Hull under construction, showing turrets on which the decks were placed The World's Fair Steamship Company ordered the construction of the Columbus at an estimated cost of $360,000. The job was undertaken at McDougall's American Steel Barge Company works in Superior, Wisconsin, starting in the fall of 1892. The hull framing, which included nine bulkheads, was completed on September 13, 1892. The ship's propulsion mechanisms were next installed, consisting of a single four-bladed, diameter, pitch propeller, the two reciprocating triple-expansion steam engines (with three cylinders of , and diameters in a common frame with a stroke) manufactured by Samuel F. Hodge & Co. of Detroit, Michigan, and six steel tubular return Scotch boilers, ( diameter by long), built by Cleveland Shipbuilding Company. The rounded hull top was then added, followed by the six turrets, which were substantially larger than those employed on freighter whalebacks. The ship was launched on December 3, 1892, after which two superstructure decks were mounted on the turrets along the centerline of her hull to afford access to her two internal decks, one in the turrets and one in the hull below. She was fitted out over the remainder of late 1892 and early 1893. Electric lighting was used, and she was elegantly furnished. Her grand saloon and skylighted promenade deck contained several fountains and a large aquarium filled with trout and other fish of the lakes. The cabins and public spaces were fitted out with oak paneling, velvet carpets, etched glass windows, leather furniture and marble. Shops and restaurants were provided for the passengers. McDougall's American Steel Barge Company had committed in the contract that the Columbus would be built and delivered in three months, making her one of the fastest-built large ships of her time. The builders further promised rapid loading and unloading, predicting that the vessel would be able to embark 5,000 passengers in five minutes, and disembark the same passengers in even less time. The Columbus was specified to be able run the from the dock downtown to the fairgrounds at Jackson Park and 64th Street in 20 minutes. McDougall set up another holding company, the Columbian Whaleback Steamship Company of Duluth, Minnesota, to own and operate the Columbus. She was commissioned on May 13, 1893. Her first captain was John McArthur, who had captained other whalebacks for McDougall's firms, starting with the first powered whaleback, the Colgate Hoyt, built in 1890. McDougall was quoted as having said to McArthur, \\"There is your steamboat; take her down to Chicago and make a success of her.\\" Alex McDougall McArthur did just that. Painted in all white livery, the Columbus made multiple round trips per day, sailing along the Lake Michigan shoreline from the Randolph Street/Van Buren Street dock to the Jackson Park site of the World's Columbian Exposition's Beaux arts \\"White City\\" exposition fairgrounds. A contemporary souvenir booklet called her \\"the greatest marine wonder of its time\\", and another publication dubbed her the \\"Queen of the Lakes.\\" She had an estimated capacity of 4,000-5,000 passengers on her four decks, but it was reported that she carried 7,000 on her maiden voyage. The Goodrich Transit Line steamer Virginia (later the USS Blue Ridge) is said to have raced against her. The Columbus carried between 1.7 and 2.0 million passengers (sources differ) during the exposition, with only one fatality, a crew member. In recognition of that success, the commissioners of the exposition presented Captain McArthur with a gold watch engraved with a representation of the ship. McArthur went on to captain other whalebacks including the , which became the , the only whaleback surviving today. Regular service Day trip advertisement, 1920s After the exposition ended the Columbus entered passenger service, and an additional deck (third superstructure, fifth total) was added during the 1899-1900 winter season. Despite the Columbus success at the exposition, and McDougall's promotional efforts, the whaleback design never caught on. By 1900, the last whalebacks had been built in Superior: the Alexander McDougall in 1899 (the last powered ship), and the John Smeaton, the last whaleback barge. The American Steel Barge Company was sold to the American Ship Building Company, becoming their Superior Works, and switched to more conventional laker designs. In 1899 the Columbus was leased to and operated by the Goodrich Transit Line, Listing shows the Columbus as \\"owned or managed by\\" Goodrich. Image of the Columbus in Goodrich livery. This advertisement features the same image as above. whose steamer Virginia had been a perennial racing rival. Tells of another racing exploit in 1896. She changed hands in 1905 to the Milwaukee & Chicago Transportation company - possibly a Goodrich holding company - and again in 1909 to Goodrich Transit Line. Her livery was at some point between 1906 and 1909 changed to a black hull with yellow accents, and she was placed in service on the route between Chicago and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Columbus remained with the Goodrich line for several years. Although she was used for excursions elsewhere around the Great Lakes, her regular schedule was a daily trip to Milwaukee, leaving Chicago mid-morning, sailing to Milwaukee for a two-hour stopover, and then returning (see advertisement right). She made daily round-trip excursions from the Goodrich docks at the Rush Street Bridge. Columbus had at least three accidents. In June 1895 she suffered an explosion caused by a steam pipe becoming disconnected while she was underway. Accounts differ, but some claim that this happened during a race with her rival, Virginia. This blog cites The Washington Post archive of the story. In July 1905, she collided with the schooner Ralph Campbell in the Chicago River. On June 30, 1917, she was involved in her most serious accident, a collision with a water tower. The collision happened in Milwaukee while she was being maneuvered by tugs away from her dock. The Milwaukee River current caught her, spinning her sideways, and her bow sheared off two legs of the Yahr-Lang Drug Company's water tower, toppling it and flooding Columbus decks with about . The collision killed 16 passengers and severely damaged her pilot house, putting her out of service for the rest of the year. Note, the site gives \\"unknown\\" for the attribution, but partially the same text is found at boatnerd.com and gives \\"Great Lakes Ships We Remember\\" as a possible source. Stability testing The Columbus was one of the first ships to be fitted with an on-board radio, installed by 1909, when she was allocated the call letters \\"KC\\". The 1908 edition does not show her having assigned call letters so the inference is that she did not have one then. Columbus and the SS Chicago used radio to help coordinate the rescue of over 200 passengers from the Goodrich liner City of Racine when the Racine was disabled off Waukegan, Illinois, in Lake Michigan. In 1915, the SS Eastland capsized while docked in the Chicago River, with the loss of over 800 lives. Officials subsequently ordered many passenger ships to undergo stability testing, which the Columbus passed easily. Even with 7,500 sandbags (simulating passengers) piled on one side, and tugboats pulling in that direction, she listed only 12 degrees. \\"Even with tugs trying to pull her over she hardly heeled\\"; quote attributed to Ships and Sailing May 1952. Columbus was featured at the Century of Progress exhibition in Chicago in 1932-33. Disposition The Columbus was taken out of service in 1933, and changed hands twice during the Great Depression, in 1933 and again in 1934. She was scrapped in 1936 at the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. McDougall anchor from SS Christopher Columbus at the Mariners' Museum SS Christopher Columbus carried 1.7‚Äì2 million passengers in her first year alone, and is estimated to have carried more passengers than any other vessel on the Great Lakes. She was one of the most photographed passenger ships on the lakes, and souvenir postcards of her are still widely available. One of her anchors, the design of which was patented by McDougall on February 3, 1891, is displayed at the Mariners' Museum in Newport News, Virginia.

The Sanok museum shows 19th and early 20th century life in this area of Poland.  Story  The park is divided into distinct but similar-looking sections - each featuring an ethnic group who lived in the region prior to the post-World War II forced resettlements. Rusyns (Boykos, Lemkos and Dolinians) and Polish Uplanders (pl. Pog√≥rzanie) homes and churches have been transported there from surrounding villages, restored to their original condition and furnished with authentic objects of the period. The individual ethnographic groups (Boyko, Lemko, Pog√≥rzanie and Dolinians) are arranged in separate sections which perfectly fit the landscape physiography: the Bojko and Lemko architecture was located in the upper part of the Park, whereas that of the Pog√≥rzanie and in the upper part of the area. One can go inside many of the buildings including several homes, a school house and a Roman Catholic or Greek-Catholic church. The museum also possesses a large photographic archive, including authentic photos from the 19th and 20th centuries. Galician market square The ethnographic museum in Sanok has undergone a major transformation in the last two years. A \\"new\\" Rynek (Town Square) has been built just inside the entrance. It is a replica of a Galician town square from the second half of the 19th century, inhabited by Polish Jewish and Rusyn populations. Besides reconstructed houses from various Subcarpathian towns, there is also a genuine Jewish house, firehouse, tavern, post-office, chemist's, shop, barber's and others.

It stars Marsha Hunt and Richard Carlson. Plot The peace and quiet enjoyed by the residents of the exclusive neighborhood of Rock Bay, Long Island is disturbed by a newspaper gossip column tidbit that one of their maids is writing a tell-all book about her employers. Since the author is not identified, each family fears that its secrets will be aired in public. Among those confused and distraught are Dr. Sommerfield and his wife Sophia. Their teenage daughter Miranda, however, is thrilled. Their longtime cook Mrs. McKessic arranges a meeting of the neighborhood servants, in which they decide to band together against the attempts by many of their employers to spy on them to learn who the writer is. The author is the Sommerfields' young maid Martha Lindstrom. She secretly visits her publisher, Joel Archer, to try to get him to stop planting stories in the newspapers to generate interest in the upcoming book. When the Sommerfields' son, Jeff, returns unexpectedly after a year and a half away studying the Eskimos, he introduces the family to his new fiancee, mathematician Sylvia Norwood. This upsets Martha greatly, although she manages to hide it. It turns out that just before he left on his expedition, Jeff got drunk and married Martha. When he sobered up, he had second thoughts. As he had to leave almost immediately, he gave Martha money to get an annulment or a divorce. Unbeknownst to him, she did not do so, as she was in love with him. Instead, she took night classes to make herself more acceptable to his social class. Jeff is surprised to find her still working for his family. When he discovers they are still married, he insists she get the marriage dissolved so he can wed Sylvia. To complicate her life even further, both Archer and local Casanova and handyman Danny O'Brien are strongly attracted to Martha. She is tempted by Archer, as Jeff shows no signs of returning her feelings for him. Finally, Archer crashes the Sommerfields' dinner party, and is provoked by the guests' harsh comments into stating first that he will be publishing the book and then that Martha is the author. After the last revelation, Martha flees with Archer in his car. Jeff realizes he loves her; he chases and catches her, and they are reconciled.

Jacobs Camp is a summer camp run by the Union for Reform Judaism (URJ), serving the Deep South (Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Western Tennessee, and the Florida Panhandle). Since 1970, Jacobs Camp (a.k.a. HSJ) has been providing summertime recreational and cultural activities for Jewish youth. The camp has all sorts of activities and believes a rough schedule of various activity will build stronger youth. The camp is one of 15 camps owned and operated by the URJ, the organizing body for Reform Judaism in North America. Jacobs is a non-profit camp, affiliated with the Mississippi Camping Association. It is accredited by the American Camp Association. Development In 1954, a group of Jewish parents primarily from some small towns of the Mississippi Delta decided that their children should have a Jewish communal experience that they could not receive at home. A summer camp was established where these small-town children could meet each other in a Jewish environment. However, the camp organizer soon realized that they would be unable to raise enough money to build a camp on their own. They contacted Celeste Orkin from Jackson, Mississippi. Mrs. Orkin was an important leader for the state‚Äôs Jewish youth, and she quickly became excited about the prospect of a camp, helping to start the Camp Association of Southern Temples (CAST). Orkin was the driving force behind significant fundraising for the camp's construction, but it was still not enough. She recognized that, despite the leaders‚Äô best efforts, Mississippi Jews alone could not put together the necessary funds, so she called her friend Henry Switzer Jacobs for help. Jacobs was a long-time youth worker, organist and religious school director at Temple Sinai in New Orleans, Louisiana. He quickly got much of the ‚Äúbig city‚Äù energy of New Orleans behind the camp idea. In the early 1960s, Jacobs called upon Rudi Scheidt of Memphis, Tennessee for more help. Scheidt, in turn, suggested that the leaders of CAST call Julian Allenberg to galvanize the Memphis community. In perhaps the most important innovation in making the camp happen, Julian Allenberg developed an idea he called ‚ÄúFair Share‚Äù which called for each congregation in Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and West Tennessee to commit to giving an amount of money proportional to the number of families (members) in the congregation‚Äîall of it whom, it was felt, stood to benefit from the camp‚Äôs existence. The Fair Share System forced the communities to raise the necessary money as well as created community support for the camp. By 1968, the money had been gathered and the land for the camp was purchased. The property in Utica, Mississippi, was originally purchased for $100,000. Construction began in 1969. The gates of Jacobs Camp officially opened the summer of 1970. Jacobs did not live to see the camp. He died of a nervous system disorder in 1965. In honor of his efforts and memory, the camp was named after him. Camp history In 1970, the camp's first summer, there were 93 campers in two sessions (roughly 30 in Session I and 60 in Session II). The early years featured two units. In 1977 a third unit was added. In 1979 the units were renamed Garin, Maskilim and Talmidim. In addition to naming the units, 1979 featured the first Maskilim Mitzvah Day and the introduction of the first Maskilim cheer (\\"We are, we are, Maskilim!\\"). In the late 1970s and early 1980s, some changes were made at the camp. Fitness was also added to the schedule in the late 1970s, and the Berman Center, a gymnasium, was built in 1985. Horseback riding was removed from the activity offerings, and the daily schedule went from six activity blocks to five activity blocks per day. In 1988, the Museum of the Southern Jewish Experience (now part of the Goldring / Woldenberg Institute of Southern Jewish Life) was built. The Olim program was added to Jacobs Camp in 1989, and the Talmidim unit went from two four-week sessions to one six-week session. After the summer of 1999, Macy Hart (originally from Winona, Mississippi) ended 30 years as Director of Jacobs Camp to focus full-time on running the Institute of Southern Jewish Life in Jackson, Mississippi. He was replaced by Jonathan ‚ÄúJC‚Äù Cohen (originally from Tupelo, Mississippi), who had been a dedicated camper and counselor at Jacobs in the 1970s and 1980s. The daily schedule and unit set-up were modified a couple of times in 2000, 2001, and 2002 in an effort to improve the specialty programming at Jacobs. For example, the concept of the Talmidim Intensive first appeared in 2000. Also, in 2002 Talmidim went back to being a four-week, regular-session program and entering 10th graders experienced the six-week Chalutzim program for the first time. Beginning in 2007, Jacobs Camp set out to place itself on the cutting edge of Jewish informal education by fully integrating its Jewish educational program into its recreational offerings through the launch of its Specialty Camp Programs: Sports, Arts, Digital Media, Aquatics, and Adventure Camp. Jacobs Camp celebrated its 50th Anniversary Summer in 2019, followed by the 50th Anniversary Reunion in November in New Orleans, Louisiana.

Description and significance  Vulcanisaeta is an anaerobic, heterotrophic, hyperthermophilic archaeon that grows optimally at 85‚Äì90 ¬∞C and at pH 4.0‚Äì4.5. The organism is isolated from samples collected directly from solfataric fields or piped hot spring water in eastern Japan.  Genome structure  Several Vulcanisaeta genomes have been sequenced, see List of sequenced archaeal genomes. The G + C content of its DNA, which is between 44 and 46%, is predicted to be relatively lower than other members of the Thermoproteaceae genera.  Cell structure and metabolism  The cells of Vulcanisaeta are straight to slightly curved rods, which range from 0.4 to 0.6 ¬µm in width. In some cases, the cells are branched or bear spherical bodies at the terminals. The archaeon utilizes maltose, starch, malate, yeast extract, peptone, beef extract, casamino acids and gelatin as carbon sources, cannot utilize D-arabinose, D-fructose, lactose, sucrose, D-xylose, acetate, butyrate, formate, fumarate, propionate, pyruvate, succinate, methanol, formamide, methylamine or trimethylamine. As electron acceptors, the organism uses sulfur and thiosulfate. Unlike some other genetically similar archaea such as Thermocladium or Caldivirga, Vulcanisaeta grows in the absence of vitamin mixture or archaeal cell-extract solution in the medium.  Ecology  Strains of Vulcanisaeta were found in hot spring areas in Japan. Despite the organisms being the most common rod-shaped crenarchaeote among isolates from hot springs in Japan, it has not isolated from other countries. This contrasts with the genera Thermoproteus and Pyrobaculum, which are distributed worldwide, including the Azores, Iceland, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, the Philippines, Russia, and the United States. Therefore, it is possible that the genus Vulcanisaeta has a restricted distribution that includes Japan.See the NCBI webpage on Vulcanisaeta.

The Latin motto \\"Quid ad sceleratorum curamus\\" translates roughly as \\"What the hell do we care?\\" The Oozlefinch is the unofficial historic mascot of the Air Defense Artillery - and formerly of the U.S. Army Coast Artillery Corps. The Oozlefinch is portrayed as a featherless bird that flies backwards (at supersonic speeds) and carries weapons of the Air Defense and Coast Artillery, most often a Nike- Hercules Missile. Oozlefinch has been portrayed in many different forms and artistic interpretations through its history.  History  There are many legends about the origins of the Oozlefinch. Most agree that the legend began in 1905 at Ft. Monroe, Virginia, then home of the Coast Artillery Corps. A Captain H. M. Merriam, no doubt under the effects of alcohol, first reported seeing a large-eyed, flight-challenged bird outside the officers' club. Soon more people would report seeing this bird, and even sketches were made. Eventually, the legend of this bird would become so great that even a statue was erected at the club in its honor. The Oozlefinch was used on the patch of the Railway Artillery Reserve during World War I; In some descriptions, this bird is instead a pelican. The DUI of the 42nd Field Artillery Brigade later included the oozlefinch, describing the insignia thus: \\"On a wreath of the colors (Or and Gules) an oozlefinch (from the shoulder sleeve insignia worn by the Railway Artillery Reserve in France) Vert, armed, capped and collared on the legs.\\"  Symbolism  The Oozlefinch's eyes are very large, allowing it to see very distant and very clearly in the sky. Its vision is unobstructed by eyelids or eyebrows, and the eyes are said to be able to turn 180 degrees so the Oozlefinch can look inward, symbolizing the need of a good leader for inward reflection. = Heraldry = The heraldic tradition of the Oozlefinch includes a coat of arms, the symbology of which is: Matched Pair of Oozlefinches ca. 1951 by COL John R.

History and usage The Berthier was originally introduced as a partial replacement for the French 1886 Lebel rifle. The Lebel, a revolutionary concept at the time of its introduction because of its smokeless high-velocity, small-caliber cartridge, still used a tube-fed magazine and other details carried over from black-powder designs. By 1900, the Lebel was already obsolete in comparison to other newer magazine-fed rifles introduced by Mauser, Lee, and Mannlicher. With its tube-fed magazine, the Lebel was long, ungainly and distinctly muzzle-heavy when loaded, difficult to manufacture, was overly complex in construction. Most notably, the Lebel proved very slow in reloading compared to newer rifle designs. On horseback, carbine versions of the Lebel proved almost impossible to reload while on the move, while shortening the barrel to carbine length resulted in feeding problems due to an unreliable tube magazine that were never resolved. Mounted security forces, cavalry units, and artillery units in colonial services were forced to use single shot Mle 1874 carbines, most not even converted to fire the modern 8mm Lebel ammunition, against insurrectionist forces who were sometimes better armed than government forces. A replacement for the Lebel was clearly required, at least for mounted troops. Named after its inventor, Emile Berthier, a French civilian engineer in the Algerian railways, the Berthier's three-shot vertical-feed Mannlicher-type en bloc magazine could be loaded by clips, greatly increasing reloading speed, a particular convenience for cavalry and other mounted troops. A spring-loaded arm fed cartridges to the breech, and when all cartridges had been loaded, the empty clip fell out by gravity through an opening in the bottom of the magazine. The small 3-shot magazine capacity was adopted after field testing, where the cavalry expressed a preference for a non-protruding magazine that did not interfere with the balance or handling of the rifle. The Berthier carbine was adopted by the French Army on March 14, 1890, and a short rifle version of the Berthier rifle was adopted in 1907. French records indicate that in excess of two million Berthier rifles and carbines were manufactured by the French State manufactures supplemented by civilian industries. Like the Mle 1886 lebel, the Berthier lacked a mechanical safety; French training protocols called for soldiers to carry their rifle with loaded magazine but without a round in the chamber until ordered to load rifles by an NCO or officer in charge. France employed large numbers of colonial troops with limited technological experience, and since colonial combat conditions in North Africa and Indochina were extremely hard on service weapons, carrying with an empty chamber was considered superior to reliance on a mechanical safety, since a rifle with no round in the chamber could never go off, unlike a rifle whose safety was not properly engaged or had malfunctioned due to grit or wear. At the outbreak of World War I, the Model 1907 Berthier rifle was modified for mass manufacturing, resulting in the Mdle 07/15. The sights, barrel band, and stacking hook were simplified to increase the rate of production. While the original 1907 rifle incorporated a cruciform bayonet, the 07/15 was modified to take the same bayonet as the Lebel, simplifying supply. The turned-down bolt handle was changed to a simpler straight bolt. During World War I, it was quickly recognized that the Berthier's three-shot magazine was simply too small in comparison to foreign weapons, requiring too-frequent reloading. Additionally, it was found that trench mud and grit could enter the weapon through the opening in the bottom of the magazine. To correct these issues, the Model 1916 Berthier rifle was introduced with a five-round en-bloc clip. The clip discharge opening at the bottom of the protruding magazine was replaced by a spring loaded trapdoor to keep out dirt and debris. This improved 5-shot design was then fitted to existing rifle and carbine-length Berthier models (Mle 1907/15, Mle 1890M16, 1892M16 and Mle 1916 \\"mousquetons\\" ). In response to changing combat situations at the front, which had evolved from a war of maneuever into static trench warfare and frequent night raids, many Berthier rifles were also fitted with sights designed specifically for close range or night combat, using radium paint to improve visibility in poor light or darkness. The Kingdom of Greece, fighting alongside the allies, received large number of Berthiers during the war, especially Mle 07/15 rifles and Mle 1892 M16 carbines. = After World War I= Many Model 1916 rifles and carbines were produced too late to see service in World War I, but were used after the war, particularly in colonial service. The Greek Army of Asia Minor received 10,000 Berthier Mle 07/15 and Mle 1892 M16 to fight against the Turks. Czechoslovakia received large numbers of Mle 07/15 rifles after World War I. The Spanish Republic received between 37,400 and 50,000 Berthier rifles and carbines from Poland during the Spanish Civil War. =World War II= Berthier rifles and carbines continued in service during the Second World War in all branches of French service, including infantry and mounted units. Colonial and Foreign Legion forces in particular continued to use the Mdle 1916 Berthier due to a shortage of the new MAS-36 bolt-action rifle. Despite the advent of the MAS-36, the French Army did not have enough of the new rifles to equip even half of its frontline interior troops. Berthier Model 1916 (original and converted) 5-shot rifles and carbines saw action in both France and Norway. After the fall of France in 1940, the Berthier could be found in service with both Vichy and Free French units. Selected Berthier Mle 1907/15-M16 (Fusil Mle 1916) rifles were fitted with telescopic sights and used, along with scoped Mle 1886/M93 rifles, by marksmen detailed to serve with some French units. In September 1938, the French Army also introduced the corps franc, special formations of infiltration and deep reconnaissance soldiers formed into l'equipe or assault teams. These elite reconnaissance and infiltration troops were equipped with a variety of small arms, including a combat knife, a handgun, grenades, and Berthier Mle 1892/M16 carbines. The Mle 1890M16, 1892M16 and Mle 1916 \\"mousquetons\\" ) were again used by French Foreign Legion and some colonial infantry and cavalry units, including the French Spahis. The Greek Army still fielded Berthier Mle 07/15M16 rifles during the Greco-Italian War, most being used in second-line units. The Third Reich issued many captured Berthier carbines to German occupation forces in France, mainly to Atlantic Wall units, the M34 variant received the German identification code Gewehr 241(f). Some were used by police units fighting partisans in various eastern European countries including security units operating at the rear of German front lines in Soviet Union. =Post-war usage= After World War II, most Berthier rifles were retired, except for some rifles held by indigenous units and reserve forces. However, the Berthier carbine with a five-round clip ( Mle 1890 M16, 1892 M16 and Mle 1916 \\"mousquetons\\" ) was again utilized by French Foreign Legion and some overseas colonial infantry and cavalry units, including the French Spahis, French motorized cavalry units, and frontier border guards. Mdle 1916 and later versions of Berthier carbines were retained in some French law enforcement units (e.g. the \\"Compagnies Republicaines de Securite\\" or \\"CRS\\") as late as the 1980s. During the Greek Civil War, partisans were still using Berthier rifles. Vi·ªát Minh forces used both the Mle 1902 and the mousquetons (Mle 1892 and M16). Design Cutaway in the museum of MAS, showing how a Berthier operates Berthiers were chambered in the same cartridge as the Lebel, the 8x50mm Lebel, which was the first to be loaded with smokeless powder (Poudre B). The Berthier used a simplified and smoother version of the Lebel bolt, but the main differences were a great reduction in weight, moving parts, tooling and an increase in operating speed. This is due in no small part to the magazine system, which was redesigned more similar to a Mannlicher-type design, where it was loaded with 3-round (later 5-round) clips, chargers, or packets. Though the Lebel's original capacity of 8 rounds was reduced, the Berthier was more popular due to the efficiency of operation and the increased speed of reloading, which more closely matched the capabilities of foreign rifles such as the Mauser and the Lee-Enfield. The occasional use, outside France, of the term \\"Mannlicher\\" to designate weapons of the Berthier system is due to the \\"en bloc\\" clip disposition which was borrowed from the real Mannlicher rifles and carbines. Otherwise the Berthier weapons, and particularly their bolts, are not derived from Mannlicher rifles or carbines but rather from the Lebel rifle system. Like Carcanos, Berthiers; other than using a Mannlicher-type magazine system, bear no other resemblance to true Mannlichers and should not be addressed as such. Berthier rifles and carbines do not have any form of applied (mechanical) safety. If the bolt is cocked and closed and the trigger is pulled, the firing pin will be released. Extreme care must be exercised when handling a loaded Berthier rifle or carbine. To safely unload a Berthier rifle or carbine once a clip has been inserted in the magazine, point the rifle in a safe direction, open the bolt and depress the clip release button located at the front of the trigger guard. The clip should spring up and out of the rifle. If it appears to stick, insert a finger into the opening at the bottom of the magazine and gently push up on the bottom of the follower, pushing the clip release button at the same time. The loaded clip should slide up out of the magazine. Variants =Berthier Mousqueton (carbine)= The Berthier design began as the \\"Mousquetons Berthier\\" - a series of bolt-action cavalry and artillery carbines with distinctly different actions from the Mle 1886/M93 8mm Lebel rifle. For instance, the Berthier carbine's bolt lugs lock vertically into the receiver instead of horizontally as in the Lebel rifle. Berthier carbines were first issued in 1890 and 1892, and had been designed by Emile Berthier, an engineer at the French Algerian Railways,to be used with standard 8mm Lebel ammunition. The Berthier design was introduced as a replacement for the various aging Mle 1874 Gras single- shot carbines - still standard for French cavalry, artillery, and gendarme forces even after the introduction of the Mle 1886/M93 Lebel. Prior experiments with several carbine versions of the Lebel action proved unacceptably heavy and slow to load while on horseback. While retaining most of the action's strong points, the Berthier carbine improved on the earlier Mle 1886 rifle by using a one-piece stock and a Mannlicher-style, charger- loaded en bloc 3 shot clip. These Berthier carbines were progressively allocated to all cavalry, artillery and gendarmerie troops during the 1890s. After the adoption of the new Lebel Model 1886 rifle, French military authorities attempted to develop a carbine version of the rifle for mounted troops. A prototype carbine was created by simply shortening the existing barrel, forearm, and magazine tube of the Mle 1886 rifle. However, this design was soon rejected for insufficient accuracy, as well as being too slow and cumbersome to reload with single cartridges while on horseback. In response, the French Army held a series of rifle trials in 1887 to select a suitable carbine. One of the prototypes submitted was designed by √âmile Berthier, a mechanical engineer in the Compagnie B√¥ne-Guelma (one of the five subsidiary companies of the Algerian Railway System). Berthier's design for the original carbine was adopted in 1890 as the Mle 1890, utilizing a 3-round en-bloc clip. The first Berthier carbine came into production as the \\"Carabine de Cavalerie Mod√®le 1890\\", which was officially adopted for service on March 14, 1890. The main production facilities were the Manufacture d'Armes de St Etienne or MAS and the Manufacture d'Armes de Chatellerault or MAC. The search for a suitable small arm for mounted troops was given greater urgency by the Germans' development of the Karabiner Modell 1888, a carbine variant of the Gewehr 1888. It was issued to essentially all French artillery and cavalry troops. As the high Command appreciated the performance of the Mle 1890 Berthier carbine, a second version was specifically produced for artillery service, the \\" Mousqueton Mle 1892\\" which could mount a short blade bayonet and thus had a re-designed forend stock. However it continued to feature the 3-round En-bloc clip of the Model 1890 carbine. During the First World War it became obvious that the 3-round clip was a handicap compared to German short weapons such as the German Kar98AZ which had a 5-round clip. The Berthier carbines (and later the rifles) used a lighter, streamlined receiver and a one-piece stock that departed from the Lebel Mle 1886/M93 rifle system. For instance, the locking lugs present on the bolt of Berthier weapons lock into the receiver vertically, instead of horizontally as in the Lebel rifle. Like the Mle 1886/M93, the Berthier carbine was designed for the 8mm Lebel cartridge, but it was loaded by a three-round en-bloc Mannlicher-style clip. In line with the usual Mannlicher magazine design, designers included a large opening at the bottom of the magazine well, in part to verify if the carbine was loaded with a charger of cartridges. During World War I, after complaints from combat troops regarding the limited capacity of the 3-round charger and mud ingress into the well opening, the Berthier's magazine was increased to hold a 5-round \\"en bloc\\" charger. Furthermore, a hinged metal plate covering the bottom opening of the magazine well was added. The final result was the Mle 1892 M16 5-shot carbine which was well received, but did not appear on the front lines until the summer of 1918. Though inferior overall to Mauser's double-column box magazines, the Berthier weapons had to retain the Mannlicher en bloc system, as the rimmed and tapered 8mm Lebel cartridge could not feed properly from a Mauser-style box magazine. The Berthier Mle 1892 M16 carbine, with a 5-round charger, had a deserved reputation of solidity and reliability that kept it in service until the early 1960s. =Fusil Mle 1902 and Mle 1907= Mle 1907/15-M34 Berthier carbine After the success of the Berthier carbines or mousquetons, two full-length Berthier rifles were introduced during the years preceding World War I. They were the fusil Mle 1902 (\\"rifle, model of 1902\\") and the fusil Mle 1907, which were issued respectively to Indochinese and Senegalese Tirailleur troops. Lighter and easier to handle and load than the Mle 1886/M93 Lebel rifle, the Berthier rifles proved more suitable for offhand shooting and easier to maintain in tropical environments. In comparison to the Mle 1886 Lebel, the Berthier's sights were also wider, higher and more substantial. Like their shorter carbine counterparts, these Berthier rifles also featured a Mannlicher-type 3-round en bloc clip-loaded magazine and used 8 mm Lebel ammunition. The Mle 1902 and Mle 1907 were made on special order and in small numbers (altogether about 5,000 rifles) by the Manufacture d'Armes de Ch√¢tellerault. =World War I and the Fusil Mle 1907/15= During World War I, a modified version of the 3-round clip Mle 1907 rifle called Fusil Mle 1907/15 was manufactured in large numbers (altogether 435,000 rifles) and issued to colonial troops, to the French Foreign Legion and to many minor allies (e.g. Russian Legion in France, Serbia, Greece, American Expeditionary Force African-American regiments detached to the French Army). It was also issued to some French regular infantry regiments after 1916 in order to bring relief to an endemic shortage of the Lebel rifle although well over 2 million Lebel rifles had already been produced between 1887 and 1917. Both the MAS (Manufacture d'armes de Saint-√âtienne) and the MAC (Manufacture d'armes de Ch√¢tellerault) were the principal state contractors for the Mle 1907/15 rifle. French civilian contractors (Automobiles Delaunay-Belleville, √âtablissement Continsouza and Manufacture Parisienne d'Armes et de Mecanique Generale) also participated massively in the industrial production of the Mle 1907/15 rifle. Remington UMC also contracted to produce a French Army order for 200,000 Mle 1907/15 rifles. Although very well finished, the Remington order was rejected by French Government acceptance inspectors, who alleged that the rifles did not meet French barrel rifling and chamber dimensional standards. The contract was canceled after approximately half of the rifles were manufactured; and those rifles were sold on the private market. Rifles issued to American 'African-American soldiers of the US 93rd Division', were of French manufacture and not US made (B. Canfield, US Weapons of WW1). Many of these rifles subsequently appeared on the surplus market in the United States, often converted for hunting or sporting purposes. These rifles hold special significance to African-American historians. In combat service, most infantrymen found the Berthier rifles and carbines, with their one-piece stocks and fast-loading en bloc magazine, to be an improvement. However, the limited ammunition capacity of the Berthier Mle 1907/15's magazine (3 rounds) was viewed as a great disadvantage by troops in close contact with the enemy or participating in assaults or trench raids. In response, French military authorities introduced a modified Berthier rifle in 1916, designated Fusil Mle 1907/15-M16 but generally called the 1916 rifle (Fusil Modele 1916). The new rifle had a re-designed magazine well, which now could hold \\"en-bloc\\" clips with a 5-round capacity, though they would still accept the original 3-round chargers. These rifles saw service in all branches of the French army mostly after 1918. They were still used by Compagnies Republicaines de Securite or C.R.S. until the 1960s for law enforcement purposes. The Mle 1916 Berthier infantry rifle only appeared on the front lines in small numbers during the late summer of 1918. With its greater cartridge capacity, it was better received than the Mle 1907/15 rifle and later became widely issued to infantry troops during the post-war years after their production had intensified . Nevertheless, some commanders continued to lobby for reissuance of the older Mle 1886/M93 Lebel for their infantry troops. After World War I, the French Foreign Legion, which carried the 3-shot Mle 1907-15 during most of its post-1916 combat operations, was re-equipped with the older Mle 1886/M93 Lebel rifle. The most successful and long-lived variant of the Berthier system was the short and handy carbine version of the five-shot Mle 1916 Berthier rifle, designated \\"'Mousqueton Berthier Mle 1892/M16\\". Contrary to the Mle 1916 Berthier five-shot infantry rifle whose manufacture had barely started during the late summer of 1918, the mass production ( over 800.000 \\"mousquetons\\" ) of the Berthier Mle 1916 five-shot carbines had begun much earlier, in May 1917, at the Manufacture d'Armes de Chatellerault (MAC) . The Berthier M-16 five- shot carbine immediately proved to be very popular with mounted cavalry, artillery, and reconnaissance troops. It was still in service with some French law enforcement units as late as the 1960s. After World War I, the French military sought to replace the 8mm Lebel cartridge, which was poorly suited to large-capacity rifle magazines and to automatic or semi-automatic weapons. After considerable delay, a modern 7.5mm mle 1929 rimless cartridge was finally introduced for the FM 24/29 light machine gun. Berthier rifles were converted (Fusil Mle 1907/15-M34) or newly manufactured (Fusil Mle 1934) to make use of the new round. However, this was merely an interim measure, as the French Army adopted the MAS-36 as its new standard bolt-action rifle. In the end, the production of converted Mle 1907/15-M34 Berthier rifles was limited to approximately 80,000 units. =Turkish Forestry Carbine= In 1948, The Turkish Forest Service began issuing three-shot Berthier carbines, full-length rifles were altered to utilize a Mannlicher-style stock. These rifles, known to collectors as \\"Turkish Forestry Carbines\\", were used to protect the Caucasian walnut forests from illegal logging.

It was first published in the magazine Sur (#145) in November 1946 and appears in the 1949 short story collection The Aleph. Plot summary The story deals with the life of a young compadrito from Buenos Aires, Benjam√≠n Ot√°lora, who has killed a man and must leave the country. He heads for Uruguay with a letter of introduction for Azevedo Bandeira, a local caudillo. While searching for this Bandeira, he participates in a knife fight and blocks a lethal blow intended for the man he discovers later to be Bandeira himself. Having earned Bandeira's trust and gratitude, Ot√°lora joins his band of gaucho smugglers. Little by little, Ot√°lora becomes more greedy and ambitious, taking more risks, making more decisions, and befriending Bandeira's body guard, Ulpiano Su√°rez, to whom he reveals his secret plan to take Bandeira's place as leader of the group. The plan is the result of his desire to possess Bandeira's most important symbols of power: his horse, his saddle, and his woman with the bright red hair. One day, after a skirmish with a rival band of Brazilians, Ot√°lora is wounded and on that day, he rides Bandeira's horse back to the ranch, spills blood on the saddle, and sleeps with the woman. The end of the story occurs on New Year's Eve in 1894 when, after a day of feasting and drinking, at the stroke of Midnight, Bandeira summons his mistress and brutally forces her to kiss Ot√°lora in front of all the men. As Su√°rez aims his pistol, Ot√°lora realizes before he dies that he had been set up from the very beginning and that he had been permitted the pleasure of power and triumph because in the end, to Bandeira, he never was anything more than a soon-to-be dead man.

Prior to President Krislov‚Äôs appointment at Pace, he served for 10 years as the president of Oberlin College and nine years as the vice president and general counsel of the University of Michigan.  Biography  Krislov was born in Lexington, Kentucky to a Jewish family in 1960. A 1982 Yale College graduate with a degree in political science, Krislov attended Magdalen College, Oxford, as a Rhodes scholar. He then returned to New Haven to attend Yale Law School, where he was editor of the Yale Law Journal. Krislov began his law career as a clerk for Judge Marilyn Hall Patel of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco. From 1989 to 1993 he served in an honors program at the U.S. Department of Justice, prosecuting cases involving police brutality and racial violence. He then spent three years at the White House Counsel's office before moving to the U.S. Department of Labor, where he served as Acting Solicitor of Labor until leaving the office to become vice president and general counsel at the University of Michigan. In 1998, Krislov became the first person to serve as both vice president and general counsel at the University of Michigan. As general counsel to the University, he dispensed legal services on matters ranging from defending affirmative action to appealing penalties levied against the Michigan Wolverines basketball team by the National Collegiate Athletic Association. Krislov led the defense of University of Michigan in Gratz vs Bollinger where the US Supreme Court upheld appeals and lower court findings that the University's admissions practices based on race were unconstitutional although upholding the concepts of affirmative action in admissions. An offshoot of the case was that the plaintiff, Jennifer Gratz, was inspired to later found the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative that led in the passage of Michigan Constitutional Amendment that prohibited discrimination against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting. In addition to managing University of Michigan legal affairs, Krislov served as co-chair of the President's Task Force on Ethics in Public Life, an initiative designed to consider establishing a center for research, teaching and learning that will integrate academic study with \\"real-world problems.\\" He was also an adjunct professor at both the University of Michigan's Law School and its Political Science department, where he taught upper-level seminars on public policy and the law. He is a member of a variety of academic service organizations, including the American Anthropological Association's Project Advisory Board on Race and Human Variation, the Michigan Rhodes Scholars Selection Committee, and the Executive Committee of the University of Michigan Institute for Labor and Industrial Relations. Krislov's community service activities include leadership positions in the Washtenaw County Jewish Foundation and the United Way of Washtenaw County, as well as membership on boards of arts organizations including the Mosaic Youth Theatre of Detroit and the University Musical Society. He also served as an alderman in New Haven shortly after graduating from Yale. He has three children: Zac, Jesse, and Evie Rose.

It was organized once more in November 1967 in the Panama Canal Zone, replacing the 5700th Air Base Wing. The wing assumed operation and maintenance responsibilities for Howard and Albrook Air Force Bases and a special operations mission that included air transport, paramilitary operations, exercise participation, civic actions in Central and South America, search and rescue missions, humanitarian operations, mercy missions, aeromedical evacuation, and support of Army Special Forces, U.S. military assistance units, and training of Latin American air forces. From its activation in 1967 until mid-1972, the 24th Wing operated the USAF Tropic Survival School at Albrook. It also controlled various rotational detachments from 1967‚Äì1987. The wing lost UH‚Äì1 helicopters and control of search and rescue missions in the area after 1 March 1983. The wing inactivated on 31 January 1987, its subordinate components reassigned directly to the USAF Southern Air Division. The 24th was reactivated on 1 January 1989, as the 24th Composite Wing assuming responsibilities for Howard AFB and Albrook AFS. The wing flew combat sorties in the Invasion of Panama, December 1989 ‚Äì January 1990. The wing trained foreign and domestic pilots in forward air control. It again flew search and rescue, aeromedical airlift and disaster relief missions in the Latin American region from 1989‚Äì1990. Members of the wing deployed to Southwest Asia to provide air liaison support between ground forces and air operations from 1 October 1990 ‚Äì February 1991. When the 24th Composite Wing inactivated in 1991, its assets were placed under Air Forces in Panama. On 11 February 1992 the wing again reactivated as the 24th Wing and became the senior USAF organization in Panama and replaced the previous command and division-level Air Force host units. In June 1992, it began operating the only C‚Äì21, CT‚Äì43, C‚Äì27 and special mission C‚Äì130s in Air Combat Command. The wing provided control and support to multi-service units directed by United States Southern Command and United States Southern Air Force from 1992‚Äì1999. Missions included counter-narcotics operations, aerial command and control, intratheater airlift, security assistance and defense of the Panama Canal. The wing operated both Howard Air Force Base and Albrook Air Force Station. On 1 April 1997 the 310th Airlift Squadron was reassigned to Air Mobility Command's 21st Air Force. The 24th Wing was inactivated on 1 November 1999 with the closure of Howard AFB and its turnover to the Panamanian government. =Special tactics= When the wing was reactivated in June 2012 it comprised the 720th Special Tactics Group and the Special Tactics Training Squadron based at Hurlburt Field, the 724th Special Tactics Group based at Pope Army Airfield. The Special Tactics Squadrons are made up of Special Tactics Officers, Combat Controllers, Combat Rescue Officers, Pararescuemen, Special Reconhaissance (formerly Special Operations Weather Technicians), Air Liaison Officers, Tactical Air Control Party operators, and a number of combat support airmen which comprise 58 Air Force specialties. Special Tactics Airmen often embed with United States special forces including Navy SEALs, Army Green Berets and Rangers to provide various skills from combat air support to medical aid and personnel recovery.

He has been studying film in Paris, France, from 1977 to 1980, and in Kiev (then in the former Soviet Union) from 1980 to 1986. Since 1994, he has made several documentary films for various TV channels in France and for Dubai TV in the United Arab Emirates (1999-2004). Biography Layth Abdulamir left Iraq in 1977 to study film at the Sorbonne in Paris, moved to the Soviet Union in 1980, and obtained his MA Degree in 1985 (majoring in film) at the Kiev National I. K. Karpenko-Kary Theatre, Cinema and Television University, where he is in the final stages of finishing his doctorate. He has won a number of International Awards for his films. Layth Abdulamir has become prominent following the emergence of a new generation of Iraqi filmmakers, in exile or still working in the country, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, a period of cultural and artistic achievements which unveiled other notable names including Abbas Fahdel, Hayder Mousa Daffar, and Zahavi Sanjavi. In 2005, after 28 years of absence, Layth Abdulamir returned for the first time to Iraq to make the documentary Iraq: The Song of the Missing Men, but he felt like a complete stranger in the country where he was born and the making of the film was rather difficult in a land still plagued by the harsh realities and consequences of the American military post-occupation. In an interview with AlloCin√©, the director explained: \\"Most of the time I had to ‚Äòsteal‚Äô images of reality, I was never able to install myself in a shot, in an interview, and thereby benefit from the time necessary for this type of operation.\\" He added: \\"Iraqi identity was broken, everyone retreated to hide behind his community, his religion, his religious allegiance.\\" As of 2014, Layth Abdulamir began working as a film critic for a number of Arabic language newspapers, and also as a Master class instructor. Work As a director and screenwriter, Layth Abdulamir made the following films, among others, in a career spanning more than three decades: The Cradle (fiction, 21', 1985) in the former Soviet Union; Yemen, a Time for the Sacred (documentary, 52', 1994), a French-Belgian co-production; a quintet of documentaries for Dubai Television, in the United Arab Emirates, from 1999 to 2004; Iraq: The Song of the Missing Men (documentary, 93', 2005), an ethnological reading of post-occupation realities in Iraq; The Executioner's Tear (documentary short, 26', 2013), a condemnation of barbarian executions in Egypt that was co-produced by French public television channel France 3 and Orok Films. With the exception of a couple of early short fictional films, Layth Abdulamir makes a full-time living as a documentary filmmaker, building a field of specialization in topics related to the Arab world and filming mainly in the United Arab Emirates, Yemen, Egypt, and Irak.

History Strawtown was once an Indian village, but was laid out by white settlers in 1819 to serve travelers. Situated on the Conner Trail which connected the cities of Cincinnati and Indianapolis, it served as the halfway point between Anderson and Indianapolis. Strawtown was officially platted by Bicknell Cole and William Conner in 1836. The area was possibly named after a native Delaware chief named Straw or Strawbridge. (http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=5736) Indian Strawtown was located across the river to the east and north of present-day Strawtown. Miami and Shawnee tribes invited the Delaware to settle in the White River basin after a 1795 treaty. Indian Strawtown was one of 14 Delaware villages established along the West Fork of the river.(Early History of Strawtown: 1787-1861 by Cloe Morris, 1988, p. 3) In 1821, a minimum purchase of per speculator was offered at a price of $1.25 per acre. The following year, five Strawtown settlers went to the Brookville land office and purchased tracts at that price. By 1836, roughly 30 families had purchased land in this area.(Early History of Strawtown: 1787-1861 by Cloe Morris, 1988, p. 10) A post office was opened in 1834 and closed in 1902. It was originally established upstream in Stevensburg on October 13, 1829, as one of the earliest posts in the territory.(Sons of the Wilderness: John and William Conner by Charles N.

Lumber was bound and floated like a raft down towards Noblesville and Indianapolis.(Early History of Strawtown: 1787-1861 by Cloe Morris, 1988, p. 16) Doctor Amos Palmer organized and taught the first school in Strawtown during the winter of 1822-23. The county was separated into two equal townships in 1823, White River to the north and Delaware to the south. Rapid growth, spurred partly by the state‚Äôs plans to run the Central Canal through Strawtown, caused the creation of seven additional townships. The canal in that area never materialized and growth stagnated, thanks in part to the location of the nearest railway four miles to the west.(Early History of Strawtown: 1787-1861 by Cloe Morris, 1988, pp. 22-35) Archaeology Strawtown is the site of a current archaeological dig, funded through Indiana University ‚Äì Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW) by the National Science Foundation. The Archaeological Survey of IPFW received a $10,000 grant for a two-week educational archaeology program at the Strawtown Koteewi Park near Noblesville in Hamilton County. The project will also result in a National Register nomination for a site near the Strawtown enclosure. During the past six years, IPFW has worked with the Hamilton County Parks Department to assess and explore the unique archaeological heritage of the park. The goals of this project are to clarify the Late Prehistoric population dynamics of central Indiana, create a cultural and educational resource at the park for central Indiana, and develop the archaeological resources of the park as a destination for regional tourism.() Geography Strawtown is located at , east of Cicero and northeast of Noblesville at the intersection of State Road 37 and Strawtown Avenue.

The idea of launching Ecosystem Marketplace was borne out of meeting by members of The Katoomba Group, an international working group composed of leading experts from forest and energy industries, research institutions, the financial world, and environmental NGOs dedicated to advancing markets for some of the ecosystem services provided by forests ‚Äì such as watershed protection, biodiversity habitat, and carbon capture and storage. Both Ecosystem Marketplace and The Katoomba Group are initiatives under Forest Trends. Ecosystem Marketplace specializes in market-based approaches to environmental protection‚Äîin the public and private spheres‚Äîregarding greenhouse gases, water, biodiversity, and conservation. Ecosystem Marketplace's website states: \\"We believe that by providing solid and trust- worthy information on prices, regulation, science, and other market-relevant issues, markets for ecosystem services will one day become a fundamental part of our economic and environmental system, helping give value to environmental services that have, for too long, been taken for granted.\\" Ecosystem Marketplace, \\"About Us.\\" Market Coverage Ecosystem Marketplace has covered information on a number of areas, including the following: Carbon Relevant material can be accessed via the main Ecosystem Marketplace website, the carbon markets landing page, and the Forest Carbon Portal. * Kyoto-related carbon markets (EU ETS, CDM, JI) * Voluntary over-the-counter markets * North American state and regional markets * Payments for terrestrial carbon sequestration Water Relevant material can be accessed via the main Ecosystem Marketplace website and Watershed Connect. * Water quality and nutrient trading * Schemes to pay for watershed services * Nitrogen offset programs Biodiversity Relevant material can be accessed via the main Ecosystem Marketplace website and the Species Banking Portal. * Conservation banking in the U.S. * Wetland/stream mitigation banking in the U.S. * Australian biodiversity offset programs * Voluntary biodiversity offsets Communities Relevant material can be accessed via the main Ecosystem Marketplace website and the Communities Portal. * PES program design * community ecosystem management * community buyer relations * poverty equity * community as buyer * payments compensation * land tenure rights State Of Reports Biodiversity * Madsen, Becca, Nathaniel Carroll, and Kelly Moore Brands. 2010 State of Biodiversity Markets.

It is in size and connected by sandbanks to Ceann Iar via Sibhinis at low tide. It is said that it was at one time possible to walk all the way to Baleshare, and on to North Uist, away at low tide. In the 16th century, a large tidal wave was said to have washed this away. Today the islands are a national nature reserve. Human settlement Ruin once used by lobster fishermen at Port Ruadh as a bothy Ceann Ear had been settled for at least a thousand years, before being finally abandoned. Like the other Monach Islands, it was originally abandoned due to overgrazing, and resettled in the wake of the Highland Clearances. In the 13th century, a chapel was established, which had links to Iona. This monastery was probably at Cladh na Beide in the north east. The monks were responsible for maintaining a light on nearby Shillay to warn ships. Ceann Ear was also known as \\"Heisgeir nan Cailleach\\" (\\"Heisker of the Nuns\\") due to a nunnery which may have been established in the 13th century. (Cailleach is usually translated as \\"old woman\\", but originally meant a nun.) Unusually, the islanders had their grain drying kilns inside their houses. This is not common at all in the Hebrides, but more a feature of Shetland. There are still the remains of the village in the south of the island, and the old schoolhouse is upkept as a fisherman's shelter. There was formerly a post office and a school here, but no shops. Geography Loch nam Buadh, with the ruins of the village in the distance A low lying, sandy island, subject to intense coastal erosion. The highest point is Coilleag Mh√≤r nan D√†mh at Gortinish at the north east of the island. Gale-force winds blast the Monach Isles on about 160 days of the year. Only certain plants, such as marram grass, can withstand the constant blown sand and salt spray. Farther inland, there are more permanent patches of damp grassland, the wettest having rushes and moss. There are only a few tiny lochs, all rather salty and some only seasonal.

The school offers grades nine through twelve (offering OAC until its cancellation in 2003) and is run by the Halton Catholic District School Board. History Bishop Reding, commonly called BR or, occasionally, Reding, was founded in 1986. Its namesake is Bishop Paul Francis Reding, Bishop of the Hamilton Diocese for ten years and an ardent defender of Catholic education. The school was the first Catholic high school for Northern Halton. In 1994, the school participated in a 25-year HCDSB time capsule project, opened in 2019. In 2002, many of Bishop Reding's students were transferred to the new school in Halton Hills, Christ the King Catholic Secondary School, a change commemorated with a plaque in the BR Trophy Case. Similarly, in 2013, many BR students were redistricted due to a population swell in Milton, to Jean Vanier Catholic Secondary School. Milton MPP and Wynne Government Education Minister, Indira Naidoo-Harris, announced an $18 million extension to BR that would cut the number of portable classrooms down from 51 to 27, by the 2020-2021 school year. After it was temporarily cancelled by the Ford Government, Milton MPP Parm Gill announced that funding would be reallocated for the Bishop Reding expansion. Bishop Reding has been noted for their student involvement, notably holding walkouts protesting both the controversial HCDSB Sanctity of Life motion, organized by student leaders Karyssa Chan, Margaret Manangan, and Ashwini Selvakumaran, and the Ford Government's cuts to education and OSAP. Athletics Bishop Reding has a storied history of athletics programs, including but not limited to: *Badminton *Baseball *Basketball *Cross Country Running *Curling - 2016, 2019 HCAA Champions *Rugby *Football *Hockey *Ping Pong *Softball *Soccer ‚Äì 2004 OFSAA Champions *Swimming *Ultimate Frisbee ‚Äì 2008 OFSAA Spirit Champions and 2019 HCAA Champions *Volleyball *Track and Field  Extracurriculars  Bishop Reding's extracurricular clubs are notable and numerous. = BR DECA/Business Club = DECA at Bishop Reding was founded by Ann Mathulla, with BR students quickly ascending to the Provincial and in Ann's case, the International level. In 2019, after over 3 years of drought, an unseen-before five students qualified for the DECA International Conference (ICDC) in Orlando, Florida, these five being the only five from the entire Halton Catholic District School Board to attend. Edward Ho, who placed in the top 10 for his event at Internationals in that year, became Co-President of the club. BR DECA goes hand-in-hand with the Business Club, founded in 2019 which raises funds and arranges sales, primarily to run the BR's Got Talent talent show. = Model UN = The BR Model UN club was founded by Nathan Duarte, and it participates in the Southern Ontario Model UN Assembly, hosted at the University of Toronto. Some BR Students, such as Crawford Bonk, received great accolades, winning Best Delegate for his Committee at the Assembly. = BR STEM Team = The BR Stem Team was founded by Meghan Mazer, and works to further studies of sciences, technology, engineering, and math at Bishop Reding and the feeder schools. In 2016, the Team held their first student-run conference at Bishop Reding. BR's STEM team is the envy of the Board, with clubs such as Corpus Christi's robotics team, Notre Dame's STEAM, and Jean Vanier's STEAM, being inspired by BR STEM. The current directors of STEM are Ethan Abraham and Veronika Sustrova. = The Royal Register = Although Bishop Reding has had a newspaper since its inception in 1986, for a long period there was no student publication. However, the BR Newspaper was revived as the Royal Register. Re- founded in 2018 by Ashvini Giridaran, the Royal Register was re-imagined as a primarily online publication, in light of ecological and practical concerns regarding a print newspaper. The current editors-in-chief of the Register are Ashvini Giridaran and Shanzey Ali. = Bishop Reding Televised = Bishop Reding Televised, often stylized as Reding TV or simply BRTV, is a video news series that recorded two episodes in 2019. Wildly successful, its first episode boasted over 1,700 views, the vast majority of BR students. A venture from Jayden Chan and Joshua Rivera, among others. The series was hosted by the Student Council Presidents, in their capacity as the PA Announcers. Due to technical difficulties and production issues, the show was put on indefinite hiatus. = Reach for the Top = Bishop Reding's Reach Team has operated for over 5 years. In the 2018-2019 year, under captains Aniketh Kothandaraman, and later, Captain Holla Smith, the Senior team successfully qualified for the Reach Provincial Competition. The official mascot of the team is James Bui, a fictional anime construct of an ideal reach competitor.

Combat in the Transdanubian Hills lasted from 6 to 21 March 1945. The German attacks failed to achieve their objectives and were then eclipsed by the large-scale Soviet offensive from the area of Lake Balaton to Vienna. Deployment German forces south of Lake Balaton were organized into two groups. The northern group was General de Angelis' 2nd Panzer Army which had the town of Kaposv√°r as its objective. Facing the 2nd Panzer Army's northern flank was General Sharokhin's Soviet 57th Army. The area in front of the 2nd Panzer Army's southern flank was defended by the III Corps of General Stoychev's Bulgarian First Army. The other German group was General von Erdmannsdorff's LXXXXI Corps of Army Group E in northern Yugoslavia. LXXXXI Corps had concentrated near Donji Miholjac and Valpovo. Across the Drava River at Donji Miholjac, the IV Corps of the Bulgarian Army defended the routes leading to P√©cs and Moh√°cs. Northeast of Valpovo and across the Drava, General Naƒë's 3rd Army of Josip Broz Tito's Yugoslav National Liberation Army defended the routes leading to northeast Yugoslavia. Named \\"Forest Devil\\" (), the LXXXXI Corps' operation had as its primary objective the town of Moh√°cs. In tandem with other German attacks that formed a part of Operation Spring Awakening, the German advance south of Lake Balaton aimed to surround and annihilate the 57th Army and First Bulgarian Army west of the Danube. The 57th Army was the southernmost unit of the Red Army on the eastern front. South of the 57th Army, the Germans of 2nd Panzer Army and Army Group E were confronted by Soviet allies‚ÄîBulgarian forces in southern Hungary and Tito's forces in Yugoslavia. An attack in these areas offered the Germans the opportunities of attacking the less well equipped Bulgarians and Yugoslavs as well as potentially rolling up part of the Soviet southern flank. Thus, this region was of particular concern to Soviet Marshal Fyodor Tolbukhin,Endkampf, p. 222 whose 3rd Ukrainian Front was deployed in southern Hungary and which commanded both the 57th Army and the Bulgarian First Army. (The unit south of the Bulgarians was the Yugoslav 3rd Army which was not subordinated to 3rd Ukrainian Front.) Alerted that a German attack south of Lake Balaton was imminent, Marshal Tolbukhin deployed additional artillery units to reinforce the 57th Army and the Bulgarian III Corps. Combat The LXVIII Corps of the 2nd Panzer Army made the main thrust south of Lake Balaton on March 6 with an attack against the Soviet 57th Army and the Bulgarian III Corps' 10th Division. With three infantry divisions (the 16th was redeployed to assist the IV Corps) aided by a thaw that caused muddy ground, the Bulgarians held as did the 57th Army. Although the LXVIII Corps (also called \\"Group Konrad\\" for this operation) attacked across a 10-kilometer wide front, it failed to penetrate the Soviet and Bulgarian defenses and had to be content with pinning down the Soviets and Bulgarians in this region.Endkampf, p. 224 By March 12, LXVIII Corps had moved the axis of its attack against the 57th Army and managed to penetrate some 10 kilometers into the Soviet defense before bogging down.Fremde Heere, p. 217 In the Donji Miholjac area, the German LXXXXI Corps attacked on March 6 with about 35,000 troops. Two infantry divisions of this corps, the 297th and 104th, crossed the Drava and, pressing the sparsely deployedFremde Heere, p. 216 Bulgarian IV Corps' 3rd Infantry Division, occupied an area 18 to 20 kilometers deep and five to six kilometers wide. On March 7, General Stoychev ordered the 16th Infantry Division in the Bulgarian III Corps to reinforce the 3rd Division at Donji Miholjac, but this required a march of 85 kilometers. During March 8‚Äì9, some Bulgarian elements began a military evacuation of P√©cs. At this, Marshal Tolbukhin ordered the Soviet 133rd Rifle Corps out of reserve to reinforce the Bulgarian IV Corps. During the march to the battlefield, the Soviet troops encountered Bulgarian forces and fired upon them because the Bulgarian helmets resembled those of the Germans. The 133rd Rifle Corps, reinforced by Soviet artillery units and supported by ground-attack aircraft, subsequently took up positions at the critical junction of the Bulgarian and Yugoslav forces.Erickson, p. 514 Ironically, the German troops found themselves facing Panzer IV tanks operated by the Bulgarian Army.Schramm, p. 1159 During March 12‚Äì19, after fierce fighting in the villages of Dr√°vaszabolcs, Dr√°vapalkonya and Dr√°vacsehi, the German advance was halted with the help of the 133rd Rifle Corps, the 84th Rifle Division from 3rd Ukrainian Front reserves, and the Bulgarian 16th Division. Realizing the 2nd Panzer Army was not going to break through on its front and under pressure from the Soviets and Bulgarians, the Germans evacuated the bridgehead across the Drava at Donji Miholjac during March 18‚Äì20, 1945. Near Valpovo, the German 11th Luftwaffe Field Division, supported by two regiments of dismounted Cossacks, crossed the Drava and pushed about two kilometers to the northeast by March 8. In the face of resistance by the Yugoslav 12th Partisan Corps, this attack slowed, and by March 21, the Yugoslav 3rd Army had pushed the Germans away from Valpovo. Aftermath The success of the Bulgarians, Soviets, and Yugoslavs during the combat in the Transdanubian Hills led to a failure of the planned German advance in the region and helped prepare the Vienna Offensive of the Red Army. The participation in the offensive of the German LXXXXI Corps of Army Group E required a massing of forces that significantly weakened the overall German defense in Yugoslavia ‚Äì a situation that was rapidly exploited by Tito's Yugoslav National Liberation Army. The overall conduct of Operation Spring Awakening has also been criticized because of the German failure to deploy the stronger units of the 6th SS Panzer Army against the relatively weak Soviet and Bulgarian defenses south of Lake Balaton. The 6th SS Panzer Army was instead deployed north of Lake Balaton in an area the Hungarian military warned was unsuitable for an armored attack. In Bulgaria the battle is also known as the Drava epic ()An example of this usage can be found here because of the bravery shown by the Bulgarians in withstanding the attack of a better trained and equipped adversary.

Early navy career Louis Palander was born in Karlskrona, Sweden. His father Axel Fredrik Palander was a rear admiral in the Swedish Navy, and the director of the Royal Navy shipyard in Karlskrona. His mother was Emelie Jacquette Constance du R√©es. Louis Palander became a naval cadet at the early age of 14. In 1864 he graduated from the Royal Swedish Naval Academy at Karlberg Palace as a second lieutenant and participated in expeditions to the Mediterranean, Sierra Leone and Liberia on the corvette Gefle, as well as in a trip to the United States. After several other appointments at sea, Louis Palander participated in Nordenski√∂ld's expedition to Spitsbergen in 1868, on board the steamer Sofia. The ship's captain was baron Fredrik von Otter. He married Anna Katarina Grischotti the same year. Thereafter, Palander served on the ship Vanadis on an expedition to the Mediterranean in 1869‚Äì1870. He was subsequently promoted to lieutenant and was the ship's captain on the postal steamer Polhem, first during the winter of 1870‚Äì1871 between Gotland and main land Sweden, and then during 1871‚Äì1872 to secure the postal route across the √òresund in severe winter conditions. He was also the ship's captain on the steamer Polhem during Nordenski√∂ld's winter expedition to the Spitsbergen islands in 1872‚Äì1873, where he significantly contributed to the scientific work. From the base camp at Mosselbay, Palander and nine other men accompanied Nordenski√∂ld on the unsuccessful attempt to reach the North Pole in May‚ÄìJune 1873. Upon return to Sweden, Palander's request for an honourable discharge from the navy was granted, and he took employment first as a captain on cargo ships en route to England, and later as a captain for a steamer line based in Gothenburg. Swedish steamship SS Vega Vega Expedition In 1877 Palander returned to the Royal Navy and offered to become the captain on the expedition to navigate the Northeast Passage. For this purpose, Palander secured the whaling ship Vega, and selected the crew and officers. The ship sailed from Karlshamn on June 22, 1878, and arrived in Troms√∂, (Norway) on July 17 where Nordenski√∂ld boarded the ship. The expedition, which was carried out during 1878‚Äì1879, was ultimately successful, and shortly before the end of the voyage, he was promoted to the full rank of captain Upon return to Sweden, he was made a noble by King Oscar II under the surname Palander af Vega, and the Swedish Parliament awarded him an annual pension of 4,000 Swedish crowns. Palander was an accomplished amateur photographer and brought home approximately 60 photographic plates depicting the journey and people encountered during the trip. Later navy and political career During 1881‚Äì1883, Palander served as an aide-de-camp to the director of the Royal Navy shipyard in Karlskrona, as well as to the Department of Sea Warfare during 1886‚Äì1889. In 1889 he was promoted to commander and in 1893 he was appointed as chief of the supply service (intendenturavdelningen) for the Royal Swedish Naval Materiel Administration. In 1896 he was promoted to rear admiral and first aide-de-camp to the king, and subsequently in 1897 appointed as the director of the Royal Navy shipyard in Karlskrona. In 1899 he was made the Chief of the Royal Swedish Naval Materiel Administration and in 1900 promoted to full rank of rear admiral. In 1901 he became a cabinet minister responsible for the Ministry for Naval Affairs. In 1903 he was promoted to vice admiral. On August 2, 1905 he resigned his post as cabinet minister together with the rest of the government (as a consequence of the political crisis arising from the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden) and resumed his post in the Swedish Royal Navy.

The original land was part of Bosque Bonita Farm and was originally owned by Abraham Buford, a Confederate Army General. The land was later bought by horseman John H. Morris. Now owned and operated by the Farish family, Lane's End Farm has become one of the major breeding farms in North America.  History  The original land was part of Bosque Bonita Farm, a name that means \\"beautiful woods\\" in Spanish, and was originally owned by Abraham Buford, a Confederate Army General. The land was later bought by leading horseman, John H. Morris. Leamington, sire of Aristides, winner of the first Kentucky Derby, stood at stud at Bosque Bonita Farm in 1866. Mannie Gray, dam of the great stallion Domino, was raised there. In 1875, the year before the Battle of Little Big Horn, General George Custer came to Bosque Bonita Farm to buy cavalry remounts. The farm was also home to a Springer Spaniel dog named Tug, who in 1989 mated with Millie, the famous White House dog owned by President George H. W. Bush. One of their pups, a female named Spot Fetcher, was born in the White House and later returned to live there with President George W. Bush. The farm is currently owned and operated by the Farish family. The Farish family home, once known as Pleasant Lawn, was built in 1829.  Stallions  = Former Stallions and Notable Residents = The farm has been home to a number of famous horses and stallions including 1987 Belmont Stakes winner Bet Twice, 1999 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner Charismatic, 1999 Belmont Stakes winner Lemon Drop Kid, 1992 Belmont Stakes winner A. P. Indy, 1990 Preakness Stakes winner Summer Squall, 2003 Canadian Triple Crown winner Wando, champion sire Smart Strike, and European runner Law Society. Stephen Got Even, the sire of American Champion Juvenile Stevie Wonderboy, Gr.I winner I Want Revenge, and dual Classic-placed First Dude, stood stallion duties at Lane's End. Pensioned from stud duty in 2015, Stephen Got Even is spending retirement at the farm, along with his sire A.P. Indy. Curlin, the 2007 Preakness and Breeders' Cup Classic winner, U.S. Horse of the Year in 2007 and 2008, and became the leading money-winner in North American Thoroughbred racing history, holding that record until surpassed by California Chrome in 2016, and later Arrogate in 2017, began his stallion career at Lane's End before being moved to stand at Hill 'n' Dale Farms in 2016. Zenyatta, the only mare to win the Breeders' Cup Classic, only horse to win two different Breeders Cup events, one of the leading U.S. money earners, the first horse to break Cigar's 16 consecutive win streak, and the horse that broke the world record set by Rock of Gibraltar for consecutive Grade/Group I victories, resides there as a broodmare. She has lived there since her retirement in 2010. Like Zenyatta, the U.S. Champion 3-Yr-Old Filly of 2006 Wait A While also calls Lane's End home during her retirement.

The administration of the various admiralties was strongly influenced by provincial interests. The territory for which Amsterdam was responsible was limited to the city itself, the Gooi region, the islands of Texel, Vlieland and Terschelling, the province of Utrecht and the Gelderland quarters of Arnhem and of the Graafschap (county) of Zutphen. Amsterdam had developed into the most important of all the admiralties and often compensated for the other admiralties' deficiencies. When the \\"Committee for Naval Affairs\\" (Comit√© tot de Zaken der Marine) replaced the Admiralty Colleges on 27 February 1795 during the reforms by the Batavian Republic, the lower civil servants were kept on, but the officers were dismissed. Foundation Initially, Amsterdam fell under the Admiralty of Rotterdam, as it was located in the Southern Quarter of Holland. However, on 26 July 1586, the Earl of Leicester reorganised maritime affairs and placed Amsterdam, the Northern Quarter of Holland, and the provinces of Utrecht and Gelderland under a single admiralty based in Hoorn. The region's West Frisian towns played a wayward role, and this was aggravated when they engaged with Amsterdam in a dispute over the Republic's admiralty administration. The States of Holland (the government of the province of Holland) backed Amsterdam. That there was a need for reorganisation was not contested, Leicester having placed naval and maritime affairs under a single college designed to curb Holland's influence. Hoorn, Enkhuizen and Medemblik rejected the idea that commissioned officers should be appointed by the States of Holland instead of the cities themselves. As a result, the commissioned officers resolved to remain in Amsterdam. On 28 August 1586, that decision formed the foundation of the Amsterdam Admiralty. The conflict was ended by compromise. In the end, the West Frisian cities gave up their resistance to external appointments, and in 1589 Hoorn instituted its own admiralty college. On 14 June 1597, the States-General of the Netherlands sanctioned the situation as it then was, so that Amsterdam too kept its own admiralty. These measures were intended to have a temporary character, but they remained in force until the end of the Republic in 1795. Organisation and development Under the decisions of 1597, the Admiralty of Amsterdam provided seven commissioned officers, along with four appointed by the States of Holland and three by other provinces. Numbers and proportions later changed, and in 1739 the college provided twelve members, six from Holland and one from each of the six other provinces. Seats in the Admiralties in Amsterdam and Rotterdam were held to be especially lucrative.Gabri√´ls, A.J.C.M. (1990) De heren als dienaren en de dienaar als heer. Het stadhouderlijk stelsel in de tweede helft van de achttiende eeuw, p. 389-90. The Committee of the Admiralty of Amsterdam was nearly always filled by former mayors. Pay amounted to 1,000 guilders per annum, and often much more than that. In practice, remunerations could be greatly increased by a variety of perks and compensations. According to a member from Groningen, commissioning was no \\"witch-finder's work\\" and he gladly kept it on. The administrators resided in the Prinsenhof (named the Zeekantoor after 1795) at Amsterdam's Oudezijds Voorburgwal. This former monastery had been used as a fencing school, and after the fire of 1652 as a temporary city hall, before becoming the administrators' office. Whenever the Prince of Orange visited Amsterdam, in his capacity of Admiral-General he resided in the Admiralty building. By law, the grounds were under his jurisdiction, obviating the need for him to be a guest of the city. It was for this reason that the building acquired, and retained, the name of Prinsenhof. In 1656, the Admiralty took over the entire building and renovated it. On its fa√ßade is the Hollandic Lion, holding the coat of arms of the High College and guarding the Hollandic Yard, the symbol of territorial integrity and security. On the site of the new 1924 development stood a number of fine houses built by Philips Vingboons, previously used by high officials of the Admiralty.Wijnman, H.F. (1974) Historische gids van Amsterdam, p. 156-7. The vroedschap commissioned the great poet Vondel to write verses to be recited at the inauguration of the building. To adorn the interior, Ferdinand Bol was commissioned to paint four huge allegorical paintings, for which he was paid 2,000 guilders. In 1632 and in 1636‚Äì37, stadholder Frederik Hendrik tried to create more unity in the fight against the Spanish Netherlands. Supervision of the fleet blockading the Dunkirkers was no longer placed in the hands of the five admiralty colleges but given to a central organization, which was to operate from a single base at Hellevoetsluis by directors specially appointed for the purpose. The object was to increase efficiency, but the system did not work well and Holland, notably Amsterdam, put up effective resistance, causing it to be abandoned.Plaat, G. van der (2003) Eendracht als opdracht. Lieuwe van Aitzema‚Äôs bijdrage aan het publieke debat in de zeventiende-eeuwse Republiek, p. 125-6. \\"Convooi\\" and \\"Licent\\" The admiralty colleges had first and foremost been entrusted with equipping the Republic's naval fleets. In addition, they had to manage import and export taxes ‚Äì collecting \\"Convooien\\" and \\"Licenten\\". Most important were the \\"Licenten\\", which were licenses on the trade with the enemy, which at that time meant Spain. The proceeds were meant to be spent on building and equipping men-of-war. In 1638 it was decided to lease out the proceeds of these Convooien and Licenten. The region of Holland, however, opposed the decision as it meant that authority for the leases came in the hands of private persons and bring them personal gain. Each province exerted itself to trade internally as much as possible, and thus to evade the rules. Earnings could only be maintained through smuggling and the confiscation of smuggled goods, a lesson especially learnt by the Admiralty in Amsterdam. On the River Oude Rijn there was an outpost of the Arnhem office of the Amsterdam Admiralty. The Rhine customs officer, however, whose jurisdiction extended as far as Lobith on the border with the Holy Roman Empire (since 1648), was under the authority of the Admiralty of Rotterdam. Pay and bonuses Unlike the English naval administration, the Dutch admiralty colleges were not permitted to use impressed sailors to man their fleets, this being deemed incompatible with the freedom that was the proclaimed basis of the Republic. A sailor in the fleet received ten or eleven guilders per calendar month. None of the petty officers or men was in bound service to the admiralty. Sailors who enlisted were housed and fed by it, and had to pay deductions for uniform clothing and equipment. Earnings through plundering or loot dried up in the eighteenth century. Like petty officers and sailors in general, commissioned sea officers were also dependent on their posting, since they received no payment from the admiralty whilst in port. Indeed, even though for officers \\"meals at the captain's table were . . . always free\\", pay was only thirty guilders for a lieutenant and sixty guilders for a commandeur (i.c. acting captain) commissioned on a ship.Bruijn, J.R. (1970) De admiraliteit van Amsterdam in rustige jaren, 1713‚Äì1751: regenten en financi√´n, schepen en zeevarenden, p. 110. It has been rightly observed that their main income was from captured ships.Zwitser, H.L. (1991) 'De militie van den staat'. Het leger van de republiek der verenigde Nederlanden, p. 87-9. In 1652, at the outbreak of the First Anglo-Dutch War, the Admiralty of Rotterdam hired ships in Amsterdam. The Arsenal or 's Lands Zeemagazijn The former Zeemagazijn The 's Lands Zeemagazijn was the arsenal of the Amsterdam Admiralty, built in nine months and containing enormous supplies for the building and equipping of warships. Johann Jakob Wilhelm Heinse saw, when he was travelling in Holland: \\"wood, coils of rope of 150 fathoms in length and as thick as a woman's leg, all sorts of sails, bullets, anchors, cannon, muskets and guns, lamps, compasses and hourglasses\\".Heinse, W. (1784) Reise nach Holland. In: S√§mtliche Werke, herausgegeben von Carl Sch√ºddekopf, 7. Band, Leipzig (1909), S. 309. The First Anglo-Dutch War ended infelicitously for the Dutch, and this added to the city administration's readiness to have the arsenal built. On 12 August 1655, the admiralty was given the entire western strip of Kattenburg island for the construction of a warehouse and timber-wharf, in exchange for so far enclosed grounds it had occupied in the area. In the night of 5/6 July 1791, the Zeemagazijn went up in flames. It was a spectacular fire, and only the main supporting walls remained standing, for after a sack in 1740 extra load-bearing supports had been put in from the outside. The building now houses the Nederlands Scheepvaartmuseum. At the Oosterdok wharf is moored a replica of a ship of the Amsterdam admiralty, the Amsterdam. The admiralty yacht lay in the yacht harbour in the River Amstel. Shipyards The admiralty's yards were initially at Uilenburg, but around 1620 moved to Rapenburg and then around 1655 to the Eastern Islands (Oostelijke Eilanden), Kattenburg and Oostenburg. In time of war, over 1000 shipworkers and sailors worked at the admiralty yard. The admiralty rope-works was established at Oostenburg and was approximately 300 meters in length. Because of the ropes laid alongside each other, sometimes at lengths of up to 220 meters, it was called a kuil or net. Old rope was also hung up, to provide oakum for closing up the seams between ships' boards.

The first National Scrabble Championship of the UK was played by high score rules in 1971, and was won by Steven Haskell.  Rules  In modern \\"match play Scrabble\\" tournaments, players dispute a fixed number of games. In most major tournaments, for example the World Scrabble Championship and the National Scrabble Championship the players are sorted by number of games won and to break ties between players with the same number of wins, the total of the player's scores minus the total of his opponent's score (known as the spread) is calculated. For example a game won 500 ‚Äì 350 would give a spread of +150. In high score Scrabble, wins are not counted. Instead only the total number of points is important. Whether the player wins or loses the game, or what his opponent's score is are not a factor. Thus a player could lose all of his games, could still finish in the top half of a tournament with above average scores. Phil Appleby scored 1049 in a British high score Scrabble game in 1989.

Copeland; purchased on the ways by Moore McCormack Lines and placed in operation by them as SS Mormactern 30 October 1940; acquired by the Navy 20 June 1941; converted, and commissioned as Mercury 1 July 1942, Lt. Comdr. G. W. Graber, Merchant Navy (United Kingdom), in command. Throughout her World War II service, Mercury operated in the Pacific Ocean, beginning with long runs from the west coast to the South Pacific and ending with underway replenishments for the fast carrier forces. The converted merchantman completed her maiden wartime voyage at San Francisco, California, 27 September 1942 having carried a mixed cargo, which included drummed petroleum products, landing mats, dynamite, engineering equipment, and food, to Noumea and Guadalcanal. Over the next 15 months she continued to carry essential materiel to the South Pacific, supporting Allied forces as they pushed through the Solomons and the Gilberts. On 7 January 1944, as plans for the Marshall Islands campaign reached completion, she reported for duty with the U.S. 5th Fleet at Pearl Harbor. Two weeks later, with U.S. Army assault units and combat cargo, she sailed with TG 51.1, the reserve force for Operation Flintlock. Arriving in Kwajalein lagoon 2 February, she remained anchored there, with her passengers and cargo uncommitted, until 15 February, when the island hopping pace was stepped up. The Eniwetok assault date was pushed forward and the Kwajalein Reserve Force became the expeditionary force for Operation Catchpole. On the 17th, Mercury entered the lagoon of strategic Eniwetok, which would become the temporary naval and air base needed to take the Carolines and Marianas. The cargo ship landed men and supplies on both Engebi Island and Eniwetok Island and then returned to Kwajalein to embark Marine casualties for transportation back to the United States. Arriving at San Francisco 17 March, Mercury underwent overhaul and then resumed cargo runs between Pearl Harbor and the U.S. West Coast and among the Hawaiian Islands. On 7 June she got underway once more for the war zone, anchoring south of Garapan, Saipan, on the 26th. Less than 5 hours later, at 2131, a Japanese bomber came through the smokescreen at an altitude of about 92 feet and headed for the ship's superstructure. The plane's torpedo hit the amidships living compartments on the port boat deck and continued on, breaking in two without detonating. The torpedo's main body was found in the 1st lieutenant's room and its fuse was located in the engine room, while the explosive components (TNT) of its warhead were spread over the port boat and bridge decks. The plane itself fell victim to the after starboard boom which stood passively in the enemy's path, knocking the plane out of control upon collision and causing it to crash 500 yards off the starboard quarter. Following repairs at Pearl Harbor, Mercury returned to the western Pacific. She arrived at Manus 3 October and 5 days later became a unit of the U.S. 7th Fleet as task force TF 33 became TF 79 for the reconquest of the Philippines. On the 14th, with Army assault personnel again embarked, she sailed for Leyte Gulf. A week later she discharged her cargo and passengers off the Dulag beachhead and then sailed for Hollandia. Through November and into December she carried reinforcements to Leyte from New Guinea and the Admiralties. On 30 December she got underway for another invasion, this time Luzon. Arriving in Lingayen Gulf 9 January 1945, she unloaded in 2 days and returned to Leyte to embark units of the 38th Infantry Division, assigned to cut off a Japanese retreat into the Bataan Peninsula. Completing the mission off the coast of Zambales Province 29 January, she steamed for Ulithi, joined ServRon 10, and underwent alterations to enable her to transfer cargo at sea. On 26 February she completed her first such operation and for the next 51 days remained at sea replenishing the fast carriers off Okinawa. She then proceeded to San Francisco, California, arriving 12 June for conversion to a store-issues ship. She was reclassified AKS 20, 31 July and completed conversion in September 1945. Detached from the U.S. Pacific Fleet, Mercury sailed from San Francisco 12 October and transited the Panama Canal to begin operations with Service Force, Atlantic fleet. For the next 4 years she plied between the United States and Europe, supporting ashore and afloat units of naval forces, eastern Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean. In 1950 she began operating with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean as the on station fleet issue ship with Underway Support Group, alternating tours in that role with . Arriving at Norfolk, Virginia, 16 October 1958, she completed her last mission in that capacity, a 10-month tour during which she set records for underway transfer rates while supporting the 6th Fleet during the Lebanon crisis. Mercury remained at Norfolk until March 1959 when she steamed to Orange, Texas. There she decommissioned 28 May. Struck from the Naval Register 1 August 1959, she was transferred to the Maritime Administration 5 April 1960. She entered the National Defense Reserve Fleet in February 1961 and was berthed in Beaumont, Texas, in 1969.  Military awards and honors  Mercury received five battle stars for World War II service: * Capture and defense of Guadalcanal * Marshall Islands operation * Marianas operation * Leyte operation * Luzon operation Her crew was eligible for the following medals: * Combat Action Ribbon (retroactive 26 June 1944) * American Campaign Medal * Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal (5 stars) * World War II Victory Medal * National Defense Service Medal * Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal (3-Lebanon)  References  *  External links  * NavSource Online: Service Ship Photo Archive - AK-42 / AKS-20 Mercury Type C2 ships Ships built in Kearny, New Jersey 1939 ships Type C2 ships of the United States Navy Cargo ships of the United States Navy World War II auxiliary ships of the United States ","title":"USS Mercury (AK-42)"},{"id":"12813145","text":"California is an inner-city area of Derby to the south west of the city in between the A516 (Uttoxeter New Road) and A5250 (Burton Road).

Biography  Alliksaar (formerly Alnek) attended elementary school in Tartu in 1931. In 1937, he enrolled in the prestigious secondary school: the Hugo Treffner Gymnasium. Afterwards, he worked for the railway, like his father, for a short period of time in 1942. That same year, he started to study law at the University of Tartu. In 1943‚Äì1944, he served as a conscript in the Estonian Legion of Waffen-SS.Artur Alliksaar: rohkem kui legend In 1944, he saw combat on the Eastern Front against the Red Army. After the Soviet occupation, he joined the underground as a Forest Brother. Eventually, he returned to Tartu and again worked for the railway. In 1949, the Soviet authorities arrested him for abusing his position. The charges were dubious. Alliksaar believes they were politically motivated. In 1954, he was also charged with betraying the homeland. Upon his release, in 1957, Alliksaar was not allowed to return to Estonia and lived in the Vologda oblast. In 1958, he secretly returned to Tartu and worked in a brewery, in construction and for the railway. He also dedicated himself to creative writing. Artur Alliksaar suffered much injustice under Soviet authority. In addition to imprisonment, his house was burned down and he was forced to live in a shed with a dirt floor while his wife and son suffered with pneumonia. Alliksaar died of colon cancer in 1966. Creative life In his poetry, Alliksaar celebrates individual freedom. His poems are innovative and critical of his era. Mainly, he wrote in free verse. His language is innovative and full of wordplay. Alliksaar is idolised by many. His creation is passionate, reckless and bohemian in nature. Few of Alliksaar's poems were published during his lifetime; yet, he was well known. He wrote one play, Nimetu Saar (Nameless Island), which he lived to see in print. The complete collection of his poems, P√§ikesepillaja (Lavishing Sunshine), was published in 1997, and became a bestseller. He also translated poetry.

The Peace Flag initiative  \\"The Peace Flag\\" is an initiative that aims to unify all nations underneath one common symbol on International Peace Day. While there are various icons of peace ‚Äì the olive branch, the dove ‚Äì there is no official world flag of peace adopted by the United Nations. That‚Äôs why this initiative has proposed that, for one day a year on 21 September, every country raises an all-white version of their national flag to represent that we are all one. In 2013, embassies of Colombia, Equatorial Guinea and Ecuador in London officially agreed to support The Peace Flag initiative by raising a colorless version of their respective flags on September 21. The initiative was nominated for a White Pencil in 2012 at D&AD; for its contribution towards peace, in support of Peace One Day.

Banner reads \\"Peace to All Nations\\". The white flag is recognized in most of the world as a flag of surrender, truce or ceasefire. The first mention of a white flag used in this context is made during the Eastern Han dynasty (AD 25‚Äì220). A white flag was also used by the anti-war movement during the US Civil War in 1861. In 1891, the third Universal Peace Congress in Rome devised a generalized Peace Flag design, which was simply the home nation's flag bordered in white to signify non-violent conflict resolution. This was used (although not officially adopted) by the American Peace SocietyUS advocate of peace and the Universal Peace Union. It was designed by Henry Pettit.  The International Council of Women's banner  Button depicting the peace flag In the 1890s, expatriate American Cora Slocomb di Brazza Savorgnan, the Countess Di Brazza, invented a universal peace flag with three upright bands: yellow, purple, and white, which became the peace flag of the International Peace Bureau.Devere Allen, ed., The Fight for Peace (New York: Macmillan, 1930), 553, . Originally, there was a complicated symbol on the middle band: \\"a shield ... surmounted by a man's and a woman's clasped hands, sustained by a pair of dove wings with a white star aloft; on the shield can appear any device chosen by the association adopting the flag, or simply the number of enrollment among the users of the flag, or the motto Pro Concordia Labor (For Peace I Work), or this motto may be placed upon a ribbon on the flag beneath the shield, or on a streamer (white) from the flag staff (blue, the color of promise) surmounted by a star with the motto of the association or individual using the flag upon the other white streamer\\". This flag was adopted by the International Council of Women in 1896. In 1904, it lost the complicated design and became a simple tricolor.  The Earth flag  The Universal Peace Congress' world peace flag. James William van Kirk, a Methodist minister from Youngstown, Ohio designed the first world peace flag of the Earth, using rainbow stripes, stars and a globe. In 1913 and 1929, he made a peace tour through Europe with his flag.Corien Glaudemans, 'Een vredesapostel uit Ohio', in: Den Haag Centraal, 16 oktober 2009; for pictures of James William van Kirk and his peace flag, see Haagse Beeldbank; photocollection of the Municipal Archive of The Hague (the Netherlands) nrs. 1.02811 and 5.12996. He traveled around the world arguing for \\"the brotherhood of man and the Fatherhood of God\\".\\"How One Minister Paid His Way Round The World\\". The Western Christian Advocate. C. Holliday and J.F. Wright, 1906. The Universal Peace Congress eventually came to adopt Kirk's flag as its official World Peace Flag, and it was subsequently adopted by the American Peace Society as well as other groups. It consisted of \\"the earth on a blue field covered with white stars; a white band crossed the globe and to the left was broken up into a spectrum representing the variations of the human race‚Äîdifferent, but united in peace\\". The flag also shows 46 stars surrounding the globe and the spectrum. In 1938, Kirk authored an autobiography, Stranger than fiction : four times around the world, designer of world flag, a world builder, at 80 years makes a new start in life.  The Banner of Peace  Banner of Peace sign The banner of peace is a symbol of the Roerich Pact. This pact was the first international treaty dedicated to the protection of artistic and scientific institutions and historical monuments.Roerich Pact: Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments It was signed on April 15, 1935. The banner of peace was proposed by Nicholas Roerich for an international pact for the protection of culture values.  The Rainbow flag  The most common recent design is a rainbow flag representing peace, first used in Italy at a peace march in 1961. The flag was inspired by similar multi-coloured flags used in demonstrations against nuclear weapons. A previous version had featured a dove drawn by Pablo Picasso. The most common variety has seven colours‚Äîpurple, blue, azure, green, yellow, orange, and red‚Äîand is emblazoned in bold with the Italian word PACE, meaning \\"peace\\". It became popular with the Pace da tutti i balconi (\\"peace from every balcony\\") campaign in 2002, started as a protest against the impending war in the world. The flag was flown from balconies in all Italian cities by citizens against the war. Its use spread to other countries too, and the Italian Pace was sometimes, but not everywhere, replaced with the corresponding translation in the local languages. According to Amnesty International, producer Franco Belsito had produced about 1,000 flags per year for 18 years, and suddenly had to cope with a demand in the range of the millions.'Det nytter!', Amnesty International Norway Common variations include moving the purple stripe down below the azure one, and adding a white stripe on top. The seven-color peace flag is not to be confused with the similar six- color gay pride flag, which does not have azure (it has turquoise) and the colors are in opposite order: with red at the top.

Heinlein, in his 1947 short story The Green Hills of Earth, referred to \\"Terra's [Earth's] rainbow banner\\". = The largest peace flag = Large peace flag in Lecce, 14 November 2009 The first large peace flag was made in Lecce, Salento, Italy by the association \\"GPace - Youth for peace\\" on Saturday, 14 November 2009.

On September the 21st 2012 the Belgian Peace Organisation Vrede vzw, Vredeshuis Ghent and five city schools unfolded the worlds largest peace flag (30 m wide and 50 m long) in the historic center of Ghent.

The books targeted for burning were those viewed as being subversive or as representing ideologies opposed to Nazism. These included books written by Jewish, pacifist, religious, liberal, anarchist, socialist, communist, and sexologist authors among others. The first books burned were those of Karl Marx and Karl Kautsky. Campaign On April 8, 1933, the Main Office for Press and Propaganda of the German Student Union proclaimed a nationwide \\"Action against the Un-German Spirit\\", which was to climax in a literary purge or \\"cleansing\\" (\\"S√§uberung\\") by fire. According to historian Karl Dietrich Bracher: > [T]he exclusion of \\"Left\\", democratic, and Jewish literature took precedence > over everything else. The black-lists ... ranged from Bebel, Bernstein, > Preuss, and Rathenau through Einstein, Freud, Brecht, Brod, D√∂blin, Kaiser, > the Mann brothers, Zweig, Plievier, Ossietzky, Remarque, Schnitzler, and > Tucholsky, to Barlach, Bergengruen, Broch, Hoffmannsthal, K√§stner, Kasack, > Kesten, Kraus, Lasker-Sch√ºler, Unruh, Werfel, Zuckmayer, and Hesse. The > catalogue went back far enough to include literature from Heine and Marx to > Kafka. Local chapters were to supply the press with releases and commissioned articles, sponsor well-known Nazi figures to speak at public gatherings, and negotiate for radio broadcast time. On the same day the Student Union published the \\"Twelve Theses\\", a title chosen to be evocative of two events in German history: *Martin Luther's burning of a papal bull when he posted his ninety-five theses in 1520, and *the burning of a handful of items including 11 books at the 1817 Wartburg Festival on the 300th anniversary of Luther's burning of the bull. Goebbels speaking at a political rally against the Lausanne Conference (1932) This was, however, a false comparison, as the \\"book burnings\\" at those historic events were not acts of censorship, nor destructive of other people's property, but purely symbolic protests, destroying only one individual document of each title, for a grand total of 12 individual documents, without any attempt to suppress their content, whereas the Student Union burned tens of thousands of volumes, all they could find from a list comprising around 4000 titles. The \\"Twelve Theses\\" called for a \\"pure\\" national language and culture. Placards publicized the theses, which attacked \\"Jewish intellectualism\\", asserted the need to \\"purify\\" German language and literature, and demanded that universities be centres of German nationalism. The students described the action as a ‚Äúresponse to a worldwide Jewish smear campaign against Germany and an affirmation of traditional German values.‚Äù On 6 May 1933, the German Student Union made an organised attack on Magnus Hirschfeld's Institute of Sex Research. Its library and archives of around 20,000 books and journals were publicly hauled out. On 10 May 1933, the students burned upwards of 25,000 volumes of \\"un-German\\" books in the square at the State Opera, Berlin, thereby presaging an era of uncompromising state censorship. In many other university towns, nationalist students marched in torch lit parades against the \\"un-German\\" spirit. The scripted rituals of this night called for high Nazi officials, professors, rectors, and student leaders to address the participants and spectators. At the meeting places, students threw the pillaged, banned books into the bonfires with a great joyous ceremony that included live music, singing, \\"fire oaths,\\" and incantations. In Berlin, some 40,000 people heard Joseph Goebbels deliver a fiery address: \\"No to decadence and moral corruption!\\" Goebbels enjoined the crowd. \\"Yes to decency and morality in family and state! I consign to the flames the writings of Heinrich Mann, Ernst Glaeser, Erich K√§stner.\\" German students and Nazi SA members plunder the library of Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld, Director of the Institute for Sexual Research in Berlin The Institute for Sexual Sciences (Institut f√ºr Sexualwissenschaft) raided Opernplatz, Berlin book burnings Books built into the floor at the museum Story of Berlin R√∂merberg Square in front of Frankfurt city hall, Hesse, Germany Book Burning Memorial at the Bebelplatz (former Opernplatz) in Berlin, designed by Micha Ullman Bonner Marketplace Not all book burnings took place on 10 May as the German Student Union had planned. Some were postponed a few days because of rain. Others, based on local chapter preference, took place on 21 June, the summer solstice, a traditional date of celebration. Nonetheless, in 34 university towns across Germany the \\"Action against the Un-German Spirit\\" was a success, enlisting widespread newspaper coverage. And in some places, notably Berlin, radio broadcasts brought the speeches, songs, and ceremonial incantations \\"live\\" to countless German listeners. All of the following types of literature, as described by the Nazis, were to be banned: * The works of traitors, emigrants and authors from foreign countries who believe they can attack and denigrate the new Germany (H.

Wells, Romain Rolland); * The literature of Marxism, Communism and Bolshevism; * Pacifist literature; * Literature with liberal, democratic tendencies and attitudes, and writings supporting the Weimar Republic (Walther Rathenau, Heinrich Mann, Thomas Mann); * All historical writings whose purpose is to denigrate the origin, the spirit and the culture of the German Volk, or to dissolve the racial and structural order of the Volk, or that denies the force and importance of leading historical figures in favor of egalitarianism and the masses, and which seeks to drag them through the mud (Emil Ludwig); * Books that advocate \\"art\\" which is decadent, bloodless, or purely constructivist (George Grosz, Otto Dix, Bauhaus, Felix Mendelssohn); * Writings on sexuality and sexual education which serve the egocentric pleasure of the individual and thus, completely destroy the principles of race and Volk (Magnus Hirschfeld); * The decadent, destructive and Volk-damaging writings of \\"Asphalt and Civilization\\" literati: (Oskar Maria Graf, Heinrich Mann, Stefan Zweig, Jakob Wassermann, Franz Blei); * Literature by Jewish authors, regardless of the field; * Popular entertainment literature that depicts life and life's goals in a superficial, unrealistic and sickly sweet manner, based on a bourgeois or upper class view of life; * Patriotic kitsch in literature. * Pornography and explicit literature by Jewish authors. * All books degrading German purity. Many German students were complicit in the Nazi book burning campaign. They were known as Deutsche Studentenschaft, and when they ran out of books in their own libraries they turned to independent bookstores. Libraries were also asked to stock their shelves with material that stood up to Hitler's standards, and destroy anything that did not. The Nazis also seized many books from Jewish communities in Eastern Europe. They did intend to keep and display a few rare and ancient books in a museum on Judaism after the Final Solution was successfully completed. Lyons, Martyn. Books: A Living History. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum, 2011. chapter 5 p.200-1 Responses The blind writer Helen Keller published an Open Letter to German Students: 'You may burn my books and the books of the best minds in Europe, but the ideas those books contain have passed through millions of channels and will go on.'\\"Baez 2011, p. 211 On May 10, 1934, one year after the book burnings, the Germany Library of Burnt Books founded by Alfred Kantorowicz was opened to assemble copies of the books that had been destroyed. Kantorowicz, A. (1944). Library of the Burned Books. The New Republic, 110(20), 686-688. Because of the shift in political power and the blatant control and censorship demonstrated by the Nazi party, 1933 saw a ‚Äúmass exodus of German writers, artists, and intellectuals‚Ä¶‚Äù. Some went to America, some to England, and some to France. On May 10, 1934, one year to the day after the mass book burning, those writers in exile in France came together and established the Library of the Burned Books where all the works that had been banned, burned, censored, and destroyed were collected. Alfred Kantorowicz, the author of the 1944 article Library of the Burned Books, was one of the key leaders instrumental in creating this library. In his article, he explains first-hand how the library came to be, and how it was finally destroyed. The library not only housed those books banned by the Nazis, the more important mission was to be the ‚Äúcenter of intellectual anti-Nazi activities‚Äù. In addition, it had extensive archives ‚Äúon the history of Nazism and the anti-Nazi fight in all its forms‚Äù. At the start of the war, the Nazis were virtually in control in France so the French government closed down the library and anyone associated was imprisoned or sent to concentration camps. Once the Nazis occupied Paris, the library and archives were turned over and that was the end of the Library. In Kantorowicz‚Äôs words, ‚Äú‚Ä¶the real significance of the Library was not confined to its material existence. When we inaugurated it, we wanted to make that day of shame a day of glory for literature and for freedom of thought which no tyrant could kill by fire. And furthermore, by this symbolic action, we wanted to awaken Europe to the dangers which threatened its spiritual as well as its material existence.‚Äù Persecuted authors Among the German-speaking authors whose books student leaders burned that night were Vicki Baum, Walter Benjamin, Ernst Bloch, Franz Boas, Bertolt Brecht, Max Brod, Otto Dix, Alfred D√∂blin, Albert Einstein, Friedrich Engels, Lion Feuchtwanger, Marieluise Flei√üer, Leonhard Frank, Sigmund Freud, Iwan Goll, George Grosz, Jaroslav Ha≈°ek, Werner Hegemann, Heinrich Heine, Hermann Hesse, Magnus Hirschfeld, √ñd√∂n von Horvath, Heinrich Eduard Jacob, Franz Kafka, Georg Kaiser, Erich K√§stner, Alfred Kerr, Egon Kisch, Siegfried Kracauer, Karl Kraus, Theodor Lessing, Alexander Lernet-Holenia, Karl Liebknecht, Georg Luk√°cs, Rosa Luxemburg, Heinrich Mann, Klaus Mann, Ludwig Marcuse, Karl Marx, Robert Musil, Carl von Ossietzky, Erwin Piscator, Alfred Polgar, Gertrud von Puttkamer, Erich Maria Remarque, Ludwig Renn, Joachim Ringelnatz, Joseph Roth, Nelly Sachs, Felix Salten, Anna Seghers, Arthur Schnitzler, Carl Sternheim, Bertha von Suttner, Ernst Toller, Kurt Tucholsky, Jakob Wassermann, Frank Wedekind, Franz Werfel, Grete Weiskopf, Arnold Zweig and Stefan Zweig. Not only German-speaking authors were burned, but also French authors like Henri Barbusse, Andr√© Gide, Victor Hugo and Romain Rolland; American writers such as John Dos Passos, Theodore Dreiser, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Helen Keller, Jack London and Upton Sinclair; as well as English authors Joseph Conrad, Radclyffe Hall, Aldous Huxley, D. H. Lawrence and H. G. Wells; Irish writers James Joyce and Oscar Wilde; and Russian authors including Isaac Babel, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Ilya Ehrenburg, Maxim Gorki, Vladimir Lenin, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Vladimir Nabokov, Leo Tolstoy, and Leon Trotsky. The burning of the books represents a culmination of the persecution of those authors whose oral or written opinions were opposed to Nazi ideology. Many artists, writers and scientists were banned from working and publication. Their works could no longer be found in libraries or in the curricula of schools or universities. Some of them were driven to exile (such as Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Magnus Hirschfeld, Walter Mehring, and Arnold Zweig); others were deprived of their citizenship (for example, Ernst Toller and Kurt Tucholsky) or forced into a self-imposed exile from society (e.g. Erich K√§stner). For other writers the Nazi persecutions ended in death. Some of them died in concentration camps, due to the consequences of the conditions of imprisonment, or were executed (like Carl von Ossietzky, Erich M√ºhsam, Gertrud Kolmar, Jakob van Hoddis, Paul Kornfeld, Arno Nadel, Georg Hermann, Theodor Wolff, Adam Kuckhoff, Friedrich Reck-Malleczewen, and Rudolf Hilferding). Exiled authors despaired and committed suicide, for example: Walter Hasenclever, Ernst Weiss, Carl Einstein, Walter Benjamin, Ernst Toller, and Stefan Zweig. Heinrich Heine wrote in his 1820-1821 play Almansor the famous admonition, \\"Dort, wo man B√ºcher verbrennt, verbrennt man am Ende auch Menschen\\": \\"Where they burn books, they will in the end also burn people.\\" Denazification In 1946, the Allied occupation authorities drew up a list of over 30,000 titles, ranging from school books to poetry and including works by such authors as von Clausewitz. Millions of copies of these books were confiscated and destroyed. The representative of the Military Directorate admitted that the order in principle was no different from the Nazi book burnings.Read No Evil Time magazine, May 27, 1946 Artworks were under the same censorship as other media; > all collections of works of art related or dedicated to the perpetuation of > German militarism or Nazism will be closed permanently and taken into > custody. The directives were very broadly interpreted, leading to the destruction of thousands of paintings and thousands more were shipped to deposits in the U.S. Those confiscated paintings still surviving in U.S. custody include, for example, a painting \\"depicting a couple of middle aged women talking in a sunlit street in a small town\\". Remembrance Fighting the Fires of Hate: America and the Nazi Book Burnings is a traveling exhibition produced by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Through historical photographs, documents, and films, it explores how the book burnings became a potent symbol in America's battle against Nazism and why they continue to resonate with the public‚Äîin film, literature, and political discourse‚Äîto this day. In 2014, the exhibition was displayed in West Fargo, North Dakota; Dallas, Texas; and Missoula, Montana. When Books Went to War (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt), by Molly Guptill Manning, details the 1933 Berlin book burnings and tells the story of how America responded by printing hundreds of millions of books for Americans serving in World War II.

The psychological drama centers on a secret held by the Callifer family for nearly thirty years. The patriarch of the family is dying and James, his estranged son, appears unexpectedly. He can remember nothing about a mysterious moment that occurred in the family's potting shed when he was 14 years old. Family members who recall the event are unwilling to describe it to him. With the help of a psychoanalyst, James tries to recall just what happened that day that left him rejected by his father, alienated from his family, and alone in the world.

The pater familias, Henry Callifer, is dying and his wife has sent for all their relatives, excepting his long- estranged brother William, and his younger son James, who has been for thirty years mysteriously outcast from the family. Dr Frederick Baston, an old family friend, is preparing a eulogy for Henry's funeral. Henry has expressed a wish that his body be burnt and the ashes cast into their river; the landscape has lost its pleasant aspect over the years but his wife has found a half decent spot where the factories can hardly be seen from the bank. Theatre Productions The Broadway production was directed by Carmen Capalbo. It opened on 29 January 1957 at the Bijou Theatre and later moved to the John Golden Theatre to complete its run of 143 performances. Robert Flemyng starred as James Callifer and Sybil Thorndike, Frank Conroy, Leueen MacGrath, Joan Croydon, Lewis Casson, and Carol Lynley were cast in supporting roles. The Potting Shed was first produced in London on 5 February 1958 at the Globe Theatre, directed by Michael Macowan, starring; Walter Hudd, Sarah Long, Lockwood West, John Gielgud, Peter Illing, Redmond Phillips. The third act of the play differed between the 1957 American and 1958 British productions. An author's note in the British edition of the published play (William Heinemann, 1958) states: :The Potting Shed was produced in New York in 1957 with a different third Act which appears in the American edition of the play. For the English production we have reverted to the last Act as it was originally written and this is the only version authorised for Great Britain. Greene was never pleased with the third act and rewrote it during rehearsals of the American production; he changed it back to the original script for the British premiere.Jon Wise and Mike Hill (2012). The Works of Graham Greene: A Reader's Bibliography and Guide. Continuum Books. p. 32. Time said, \\"The play's emotional power derives from its harassed outcries and silences, from very human bafflements and needs, from a truly serious man's intensities and jocosities alike . . . for two acts, culminating in a superbly dramatic revelation scene, The Potting Shed, by its writing and storytelling alike, more and more grips and stirs its audience.\\" It was revived at the Finborough Theatre in early 2011.

Life  Antoine Berman was born in the small town of Argenton-sur-Creuse, near Limoges, to a Polish-Jewish father and a French-Yugoslav mother. After living in hiding during the Second World War, the family settled near Paris. Berman attended the Lyc√©e Montmorency. Later he studied philosophy at the University of Paris, where he met his wife Isabelle. In 1968 they moved to Argentina, where they remained 5 years. Back in Paris he directed a research program and taught several seminars at the Coll√®ge international de philosophie (International College of Philosophy) in Paris, and published his major theoretical work, L'Epreuve de l'√©tranger (The Experience of the Foreign) in 1984. He died in 1991, at age 49, writing his last book in bed.  Work  Antoine Berman's \\"trials of the foreign\\", which originates from German Romanticism (especially Friedrich Schleiermacher), tries to show the \\"deforming tendencies\\" inherent in the act of (literary) translation. Berman's 'twelve deforming tendencies' in translation were: *Rationalisation *Clarification *Expansion *Ennoblement *Qualitative impoverishment *Quantitative impoverishment *The destruction of rhythms *The destruction of underlying networks of signification *The destruction of linguistic patternings *The destruction of vernacular network or their exoticisation *The destruction of expressions and idioms *The effacement of the superimposition of languages Lawrence Venuti, an American translation theorist, has used Berman's concepts to write a genealogy of translation in an Anglo-American context to introduce the \\"foreignizing\\" strategy that is normatively suppressed in mainstream translation. Influence Berman was active in philosophical and literary circles, nevertheless he has been influential in translatology, especially in translation criticism. He claimed that there may be many different methods for translation criticism as there are many translation theories; therefore he entitled a model of his own as an analytical path, which can be modulated according to the specific objectives of each analyst and adapted to all standardized text types.

It was the last battle to be fought between the Clan Mackay and Clan Sutherland. It was fought \\"beside the water of Garbharry\\", at \\"the foot of the hill called Beinn-mhor, in Berriedale\\".  Background  In 1555 John Gordon, 11th Earl of Sutherland was commissioned by the Queen Regent, Mary of Guise to punish Iye MacKay, chief of the Clan Mackay for his failure to attend her in Inverness. The Earl destroyed the Mackay's main stronghold on the north coast, Borve Castle north of Farr, which the Clan Mackay had used to carry out raids on the Clan Sutherland. The Earl of Sutherland confronted Iye Mackay in Strathbrora, forcing him to surrender himself to imprisonment in Edinburgh. Iye Mackay's first cousin John-More Mackay then assumed power. He led a raid towards Helmsdale in Sutherland, and burnt the chapel of St. Ninian's at Navidale just north of Helmsdale before pulling back. The Clan Sutherland then assembled a force under MacJames, the Terell of the Doil and James MacWilliam and set off in pursuit. They caught up with the Mackays in Berriedale, near Garbharry where the battle took place. The battle According to the account given in Conflicts of the Clans, the Sutherlands overtook the Mackay of Strathnaver men at the foot of the hill called Beinn-mhor, in Berriedale, and invaded them beside the water of Garbharry, where then ensued a cruel conflict, fought with great obstinacy. The Strathnaver men were overthrown and chased; about 120 of them were slain, and some drowned in Garbharry. Aftermath The Battle of Garbharry is cited as being the last battle fought between the Clan Mackay and Clan Sutherland. It would appear that this is the case as far as the chief of Mackays, who was designated as \\"of Strathnaver\\" is concerned, although 35 years later a half-brother of Mackay of Strathnaver fought against the Earl of Sutherland at the Battle of Clynetradwell.

Early years The stallion was born in West Springfield, Massachusetts in 1789. The small, dark colt is believed to have been sired by an English Thoroughbred stallion named \\"True Briton\\", also known as \\"Beautiful Bay\\" and \\"Traveller\\", which was foaled in 1768. Figure's dam was of \\"Wild-Air\\" breeding, sired by Diamond, foaled in 1784 in West Springfield. The dam was bred by Justin Morgan, for whom the breed is named. Figure is thought to have stood about 14 hh (1.42 m), and to have weighed about 950 lb (430 kg). He was known for his prepotency, passing on his distinctive looks, conformation, temperament, and athleticism. Ownership by Justin Morgan In 1792, Figure was advertised for stud before he was given as payment for a debt to Justin Morgan (1747-1798), a singing teacher and one-time Randolph, Vermont, Town Clerk. Morgan owned Figure from 1792-1795, advertising him for stud in Randolph and Lebanon, New Hampshire (1793), and Royalton, Vermont (1794), and Williston and Hinesburg, Vermont (1795). He leased Figure to Robert Evans in the fall of 1795 to clear land for a Mr. Fisk at a rate of $15.00 a year. Morgan later traded the horse to Samuel Allen for land in Moretown, Vermont. Allen sold the stallion later that year to William Rice of Woodstock, Vermont. Accomplishments In 1796, Figure raced in a sweepstakes in Brookfield, Vermont, beating New York horses to win $50. That year, he was advertised at stud by Johnathan Shepard of Montpelier, who also raced him in several match races in which he did well. Figure became known as the \\"Justin Morgan horse.\\" Other owners Figure was traded again in 1797, along with a blacksmith shop, to James Hawkins. In 1801 he was recorded as owned by Robert Evans of Randolph. Evans owned the horse until 1804, using the stallion for logging, racing, and breeding, until he fell into debt to Colonel John Goss. Goss collected the horse as part of the debt, and used him to review troops. He entered the horse in a pulling bee, which the little horse won. In 1805, Goss traded Figure for a mare owned by his brother David. David Goss owned Figure from 1805-1811, where he worked on the farm for 10 months, and was used for breeding for two months each year. He was sold in 1811 to Philip Goss for the breeding season. Philip Goss sold Figure to Jacob Sanderson, who sold him to Jacob Langmeade. Langmeade used the horse to haul freight, and is thought to have abused the aging stallion. Langmeade sold Figure to Joel Goss and Joseph Rogers at the end of 1811. Figure stood at stud for several years, before he was sold to Samuel Stone in 1817. Stone exhibited the stallion in the Randolph fair. Figure was used as a parade mount by President James Monroe later that year. Final years In 1819, Figure was sold to his final owner, Levi Bean of Chelsea, Vermont. Toward the end of his life, Figure was put out to pasture. He died in 1821 from an injury to the flank, caused by a kick, at the age of 32. Figure is now buried in Tunbridge, Vermont. Stories, myths and legends Many myths developed surrounding Figure and Justin Morgan. The popular children's book, Justin Morgan Had a Horse by Marguerite Henry, is a fictionalized account of Figure (called \\"Little Bub\\" in the book) and his early life. Walt Disney Studios adapted the book into a film in 1972.

RKO Pictures and Warner Bros. considered buying the rights, the first intending to assign Charles Laughton in the lead role, but were discouraged from doing so. In March 1940, Columbia Pictures showed interest, but was informed that Tobacco Road was on the list of banned titles. Eventually, 20th Century Fox gained the rights in August 1940, with RKO as its main competitor. It was believed that Fox won due to the success of The Grapes of Wrath (1940). They were the main preference of the copyright holders Erskine Caldwell and Jack Kirkland, who were reluctant to sell the rights unless the film \\"would be picturized honestly and fearlessly.\\"\\"Sensational Screen Play Comes Thurs.

Much to the \\"immense satisfaction of the studio\\", John Ford was signed on as the director as early as March 1940.\\"Hollywood Now Only Talks In Millions\\" by Sheilah Graham, The Miami News, March 31, 1940, p. 2 On production, he commented in a December 1940 interview: \\"We have no dirt in the picture.

What we're aiming at is to have the customers sympathize with our people and not feel disgusted.\\"\\"'Tobacco Road' Cleaned Up For Production as Movie\\" by Frederick C. Othman, St. Petersburg Times, December 15, 1940 The decision was most likely a result of a November 1940 warning that \\"many religious folk throughout the nation may be offended by the religious aspects.\\" Casting was a huge problem, and it was reported that producer Darryl F.

On his role, Tracy commented in a December 1940 interview: \\"It's a swell part. It's one you can sink your teeth in, if you have your teeth.\\" While in production, Tobacco Road was thought to be received as even greater than The Grapes of Wrath. Filming was initially set on location in Georgia, but to avoid any controversy, the studio decided in November 1940 that the film would be shot in the studio on closed sets.\\"'Tobacco Road' Will Be Filmed On Closed Sets\\" by Cameron Shipp, Spartanburg Herald-Journal, November 25, 1940, p. 5 To further prevent the film from being banned before its release, there was no publicity. Reception Many critics compared the film of Tobacco Road to the stage version, which was still running on Broadway at the time of the film's release. Variety wrote, \\"The slightest attempt to clean up Jeeter and his brood dooms the effort to failure... He's better entertainment--and box office --with rough edges.\\" Despite the studio's concerns over the censorship, the film was only banned in Australia for unknown reasons. Although the film received mixed reviews, it became a success at the box office, and it had grossed up to $1.9 million by 1973.

Only the nucleus ruber and the dentate nucleus are shown in this diagram; the olivary nucleus is positioned on the lateral aspect of the brainstem. Palatal myoclonus The myoclonic triangle (also known by its eponym Triangle of Guillain-Mollaret or dentato-rubro-olivary pathway) is an important feedback circuit of the brainstem and deep cerebellar nuclei which is responsible for modulating spinal cord motor activity. The circuit is thus composed: # Fibers of the rubro-olivary tract project from the parvocellular red nucleus via the central tegmental tract to the ipsilateral inferior olivary nucleus. # The inferior olivary nucleus sends its afferents via climbing fibers in the inferior cerebellar peduncle to Purkinje cells of the contralateral cerebellar cortex. # The Purkinje cells send their afferents to the ipsilateral dentate nucleus. # Dentatorubral tract fibers: the dentate nucleus afferents travel via the superior cerebellar peduncle to the contralateral red nucleus, thus completing the circuit. Of note, this circuit contains a double decussation, implying that a lesion in this tract will cause ipsilateral symptoms. The descending rubrospinal tract and reticulospinal tract originate in the red nucleus and reticular formation (which is closely associated with the central tegmental tract) respectively, thereby providing the mechanism by which this circuit exerts its effects on spinal cord motor activity.  Pathologies  = Hypertrophic olivary degeneration = HOD is caused by lesions in the dentatorubral or central tegmental tracts. Lesions of the superior cerebellar peduncle can also result in contralateral HOD, whereas primary lesions of the central tegmental tract cause ipsilateral HOD. Lesions involving this circuit may produce palatal myoclonus, one of the few involuntary movements that do not disappear during sleep. Palatal myoclonus may be seen as a component of the lateral medullary syndrome (a.k.a. Wallenberg Syndrome), if the infarction extends to involve the central tegmental tract.  Holmes tremor  Descriptions of Holmes tremor associated with HOD are scarce. It is most likely that disruption of the disynaptic dentate-rubro-olivary tract degeneration is associated with tremor and disruption of the monosynaptic dentate-olivary tract is associated with HOD. The convergence of both components makes the combination of Holmes tremor and HOD after upper brainstem damage plausible and even likely.

Ace is about to go to prison for his part in the theft of the bonds. He arranges a deal to reduce his sentence by testifying, angering his former partner in crime, Fly Feletti (Elisha Cook, Jr.).

Plot New York city girl Evie O'Connor works as a secretary for the Trojan Shirt Co. in Brooklyn. She has her mind set on finding a tall, strong man to marry - one that can wear a Trojan shirt with a 16 1/2 neck size. She writes a short letter and puts it in a shirt that is to be sent to an army camp. The shirt eventually ends up on private Edgar \\"Wolf\\" Larsen, who has quite a reputation as a ladies' man. Wolf reads the letter aloud to his bunk mate John Phoneas McPherson, then throws it away. John picks it up again and gets interested in finding the woman behind the letter. Although John is not big and strong like Wolf, but short and small, he decides to pursue Evie by writing her back. John and Evie become pen pals, but he sends her a picture of Wolf when she asks for a picture of him, since he is afraid she will lose interest if he admits to not being of the same size and dimension. Some time later John's unit passes through New York, and he goes to see her, posing as his own friend Wolf. When he sees her he is smitten at the first glance. The two get along wonderfully, having a lot of the same interests, but he is afraid that if she discovers his deception she will hate him, so he continues to pretend being someone else. Wolf finds out about the correspondence between him and Evie, and makes a surprise visit at Evie's place when John is there. Wolf takes her in his arms and kisses her, pretending to be the one who wrote the letters. Evie is at first madly in love with him, but feels some chemistry missing that she felt when he wrote the letters. He explains to her that he can only be eloquent when writing, but not when speaking. A commotion occurs as John tries to stop Evie and Wolf from being alone with each other, and at the same time fending off Evie's roommate Barney Lee, who is attracted to him. He eventually pretends to be drunk and forces Wolf and Evie apart. Jealous, John strikes Wolf outside Evie's apartment and tells him to stay away from \\"his\\" girl. Wolf ignores John's command and meets Evie again in secret. John finds out about their meetings when Wolf answers her phone call. John rushes to Evie's apartment building and starts a fire to smoke the couple out. In the ensuing commotion, Wolf trips and falls, hurting his head. Subsequently, when not in his right mind, Wolf asks Evie to marry him. She accepts, but the marriage is postponed, since the unit is shipped overseas the next morning. While away on his mission Wolf meets and marries a French girl, placing the burden on John of telling Evie about the deception. Evie, not receiving any letters from John for several months and becoming worried, goes to visit John's family in New York. While there, she discovers by looking through a photo album that the man whose home she is visiting, and who wrote her the letters, is the short small one, and not the tall strong one. She is heartbroken, and back home she cries to her roommate that she never wants to see either man again. She also confesses to being confused as to which man she had really loved: the one who kissed her, or the one who wrote the letters. Meantime John, who doesn't know that Evie knows, is trying to figure out how to break the news to her. Just released from the army hospital with a wounded leg, he decides to protect both Wolf's honor and Evie's faith by telling her that John is dead, and that he died loving her. He gives Evie the gift of his purple heart. Evie then realizes that all along it was this man who had loved her, and this man whom she had fallen in love with. She is delighted, and they unite in a kiss. The story is a spinoff of Cyrano de Bergerac, updated to a modern setting.

He lived in Waite Hill, Ohio with his wife, Elizabeth Good \\"Betty\\" Augustus until his death in May 1964. Biography He was born on November 23, 1897 in Cleveland, Ohio. Ellsworth, an avid amateur golfer, once beat Bobby Jones at a charity golf event. He was characterized in a 1920 issue of Vanity Fair magazine as being the country's most powerful driver off the tee, demonstrating his golf swing in a series of time lapse photos. Augustus and his wife had four children, Daneen, Albert Anthony Augustus II, Elizabeth (Betsy), and Margaret (Peggy). He served for four years during World War II on active duty as an officer in the United States Navy Reserve aboard the troop ship, USS West Point, which was converted from the ocean liner America. In 1950 he was appointed as the Cuyahoga County coordinator of Civil Defense at the request of Cleveland Mayor Thomas A. Burke and the county commissioners. Although Augustus and his staff had little experience with civil defense and limited guidance from the federal government, the civil defense organization soon developed organizational plans for a county-wide program that called for \\"tens of thousands of volunteers\\" to be \\"the county's defense troops.\\" Augustus hoped to train one member from each family in Cuyahoga County, or 375,000 people, in first aid. Further volunteer opportunities included 30,000 to 40,000 air raid war- dens, 5,000 police auxiliary officers, and 3,000 auxiliary firemen. Local schools also participated in the civil defense program. In February 1951, Cleveland school officials sent a letter to all parents describing the civil defense efforts in schools. Some schools taught their students how to protect themselves by ducking under their desks and covering their heads ‚Äî the well-known \\"Duck and Cover\\" technique. Scouting Augustus began his Scouting service in 1940 and served as vice president (1941‚Äì46) and president (1947‚Äì53) of the Greater Cleveland Council.

The mechanism of action is twofold: next to its antiseptic effect, policresulen promotes the selective coagulation of necrotic and pathologically altered tissues while leaving healthy tissues intact.

Biography Amalie was the fourth child of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and his second wife Caroline of Baden. She was the identical twin sister of Elisabeth Louise, later Queen of Prussia as wife of Frederick William IV of Prussia. Three other sisters married King Frederick Augustus II of Saxony, Archduke Franz Karl of Austria and Maximilian Joseph, Duke in Bavaria. In 1851 Amalie Auguste became chairwoman of Women's Association of Dresden (Frauenverein zu Dresden), an organisation founded by her sister, the then queen. Three years later, her husband inherited the throne and she became queen. In 1859 she reorganized the association as the Zentralausschu√ü obererzgebirgischen und der vogtl√§ndischen Frauenvereine and established a legal basis for it, under which the organisation continued until 1932. A firm believer in divine-right absolute monarchy, the queen despised representative government and liberalism. Although she was an ultraconservative Catholic, it is unclear to what extent she was involved in the government's harsh persecution of Saxon Protestants in the 1860s, which included torture and long periods of incarceration. But later arrested by Willhim I who saw what she did in person for those crimes and tried and convicted by a jury for those crimes and Willhim acting as prosecutor and Bismarck as judge and she was sentenced life in prison without parole and she died in a custom jail in Dresden after a long illness from tuberculosis in Dresden. Marriage and issue Amalie Auguste married on 21 November 1822 Prince John of Saxony, who reigned as King of Saxony between 1854 and 1873.

In addition, Albania did not attend any games from 1976 to 1988, although there was no official explanation for their absence at the 1976 Montreal Olympics and 1988 Seoul Olympics. Politically, Albania allied with China after the Sino-Soviet split, remaining antagonistic towards the Soviet Union; however, it also opposed China's rapprochement with the United States in the late 1970s, resulting in the Sino-Albanian split. A similar antagonism towards both superpowers existed in Iran since 1979. This resulted in Iran and Albania boycotting both the 1980 and 1984 Olympics independently without endorsing the boycott on the opposing side.  Revenge hypothesis  Jimmy Carter declared that the United States would boycott the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow, with 65 other countries joining the boycott. This was the largest Olympic games boycott ever. In 1984, three months before the start of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, the Soviet Union declared it would \\"not participate\\" in the Games. The Soviets cited a number of reasons, namely the commercialization of the games which, in their opinion, went against the principles of the Olympic movement (indeed the XXIII Olympiad ended up being the first Olympics since 1932 to make a profit by a host country) and a claimed lack of security for their athletes. The issue of commercialization did gather some criticism from foreign delegations, who were unfamiliar with this trend in the Olympic movement. However, the IOC later declared the Games \\"a model for future Olympics\\" due to a surplus of US$223 million for the hosts, exclusively private funding (unlike Moscow Olympics that were state- funded), and relying on existing venues instead of building new ones. olympic.org The majority viewed the boycott as more of a retaliatory move by the Soviets. Most of the world's media interpreted the Soviet boycott as retaliation for the US boycott of the 1980 Moscow Games,Tyner, Howard A. U.S. Olympic boycott of 1980 led to Soviet decision of 1984. Chicago Tribune. May 9, 1984. D13. which had been in response to the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, whereas the Soviet media repeated the government line that the boycott was a safety measure to protect their own athletes. However, no threat to Eastern Bloc athletes was ever discovered, and the athletes from the Eastern Bloc country that did attend the 1984 games in Los Angeles--Romania-- encountered no problems, and in fact were widely cheered above all other visiting nations at the Opening Ceremonies when they marched into the Coliseum. Romania ended up finishing third in overall medal count at the Games. Among those subscribing to the \\"revenge hypothesis\\" was Peter Ueberroth, the chief organizer of the 1984 L.A. Games, who expressed his views in a press conference after the boycott was announced, on the same day that the Olympic torch relay in the United States began in New York City. U.S. President Ronald Reagan later stated his belief that the Soviets feared some of their athletes might defect. As well, President Reagan and his administration agreed to meet all of the demands of the Soviet Union in turn for the Soviet Bloc's attendance at the 1984 Olympics, marking a stark contrast in Reagan's \\"hawkish\\" views on Cold War foreign policy. As more countries withdrew, the IOC announced on the deadline week that it would consider extending the deadline for entry into the Olympics.Reich, Kenneth. Olympic Entry Deadline Might Be Extended. The LA Times. May 30, 1984. OC3. The three top medal winners from the 1980 Games (which was the subject of a boycott by sixty six nations) in Moscow were among the boycotters, and media analysis noted this would weaken the field of competitors in a number of sports.‚ÄòEast Germany Joins L.A.

However, it was later disclosed that both the Soviet Union and East Germany boosted their performances with the help of state-run steroid programs.  Soviet doping plan  Documents obtained in 2016 revealed the Soviet Union's plans for a statewide doping system in track and field in preparation for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Dated prior to the country's decision to boycott the Games, the document detailed the existing steroids operations of the program, along with suggestions for further enhancements. The communication, directed to the Soviet Union's head of track and field, was prepared by Dr. Sergei Portugalov of the Institute for Physical Culture. Portugalov was also one of the main figures involved in the implementation of the Russian doping program prior to the 2016 Summer Olympics. Filmmaker and director of 2017 movie Icarus Bryan Fogel has said that stricter doping controls might have been the main reason for the Soviet boycott.

In 1980, China had sent a team to the Winter Olympics in the United States, while boycotting the Summer Olympics in the Soviet Union. * Congo * Mozambique * Romania was the only member of the Warsaw Pact that did not boycott the Games. Its leader, Nicolae Ceau»ôescu, was famous for openly opposing various policies of the Soviet Union; he was awarded the Olympic Order in 1985 for this issue. * Somalia had broken relations with the Soviet Union after the latter's support for Ethiopia in the Ethio-Somali War. * Yugoslavia was a non-aligned country that acted independently of the Soviet Union. Yugoslavia shared friendly relations with both the Soviet Union and the United States, therefore it did not participate in either of the boycotts. It had just hosted the 1984 Winter Olympics. Alternative events The Soviets organized the Friendship Games, a full-scale multi-sport event, for boycotting countries. The Games were contested in 22 Olympic disciplines (all except association football and synchronized swimming), and in non-Olympic table tennis, tennis, and sambo wrestling. The Soviet Union dominated the medal table, winning 126 gold and 282 total medals.

He studied theater in Iraq, and cinematography and directing in England. He is known for his drama films, which focus on political affairs in the Middle East and their effects on interpersonal relationships.  Personal life  Al-Daradji was born and raised in Iraq. His aunt had lost a son in the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, and he cites her grief as a motivation for his films, which address both the terrible suffering and the hopefulness for the future felt by many Iraqis. In 1995, he fled to the Netherlands: ‚ÄúAnd now I am proud. [...] I am a refugee who came to Holland fifteen years ago, with one pair of trousers, dirty clothes, and one pair of shoes. I will tell myself this [...] and I will tell that to my family. I am proud of Holland that gave me this great energy and this great opportunity to find myself - that is really important for me.‚Äù As of May 2008, Al-Daradji is unmarried and does not have children. Education and career His first job in the Netherlands was as a cameraman. Later he studied at Leeds Beckett University's Northern Film School in Leeds, UK where he obtained master's degrees in Cinematography and Directing. During his graduate studies, he created many short films and commercials, which earned him the prestigious Kodak Student Commercial Award for Cinematography. In 2003, he returned to Baghdad, Iraq to begin work on his first feature film Ahlaam which he filmed over in a four-month period during the war. Filming was difficult as electricity would often cut out from time to time. Towards the end of filming, he and three members of his crew were kidnapped but managed to escape being killed by insurgents, who accused them of making a propaganda film in support of the U.S.-backed Iraqi government. The captors were preparing to shoot them before they fled from the sound of police sirens. On the same day, they were said to have been abducted again from a Baghdad hospital by another group of gunmen who beat them up and then turned them over to the U.S. military, who held them in harsh conditions for six days on the suspicion that they were filming insurgent attacks for Al Qaida. Ahlaam screened at more than 125 international film festivals and received more than 22 awards, as well as Academy Award and Golden Globe consideration. In 2008, Al-Daradji became a Sundance fellow. Al-Daradji again came into prominence upon release of his 2009 drama Son of Babylon, which premiered at the Middle East International Film Festival (now known as the Abu Dhabi Film Festival) and was the first feature film to be financially supported by the festival. It was developed through the Sundance Institute. The film made its world premiere at the film festival Berlinale2010 (Berlin International Film Festival), and earned him Variety magazine's Middle East Filmmaker of the Year award, Berlin's Amnesty Award and Peace Prize, the NETPAC Award at Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, and a special mention at Edinburgh International Film Festival. The film was selected as the Iraqi entry for the 2011 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language film nominations, however it did not make the final shortlist. Tim Gray, editor of Variety, said the following upon naming Al- Daradji the Middle East Filmmaker of the Year: \\"We wanted to honour Mohamed Al Daradji, not because he is a great Middle Eastern filmmaker, but because he is simply a great filmmaker.\\" Filmography * 2017 - The Journey * 2013 - In the Sands of Babylon * 2011 - In my Mother's Arms * 2009 - Son of Babylon * 2008 - War, Love, God, & Madness * 2005 - Ahlaam * 2003 - No. 438 * 2003 - The War Awards * 2010 Variety's Middle Eastern Filmmaker of the Year 2010 * 2010 Seattle International Film Festival, Emerging Master * 2010 Amnesty International Film Award at the Berlin Film Festival * 2010 Raindance Award at the British Independent Film * 2006: Brooklyn International Film Festival Spirit Award for Ahlaam References External links CNN Article about Iraqi Film in 2010 *Human Film website 1978 births Living people Iraqi film directors People from Baghdad Dutch people of Iraqi descent Iraqi Shia Muslims Dutch film directors ","title":"Mohamed Al-Daradji"},{"id":"12813874","text":"Diiodohydroxypropane is an antiseptic and disinfectant.

Their teeth, which are by far the most common remains, resemble those of the multituberculates. However, based on Haramiyavia, the jaw is less derived; and at the level of evolution of earlier basal mammals like Morganucodon and Kuehneotherium, with a groove for ear ossicles on the dentary.Butler PM, 2000 If they are early multituberculates, they would be the longest lived mammalian clade of all time. However, a more recent study, in November 2015, may dispute this and suggested the Haramiyida were not crown mammals, but were part of an earlier offshoot of mammaliaformes instead. Relationships Haramiyids show certain similarities to multituberculates, a group of mammals that survived until about 40 million years ago. It is possible that haramiyids are ancestral to multituberculates, although the available evidence is insufficient to be conclusive. Certain characteristics of the teeth seem to rule out a special relationship between the two groups,Monastersky 1996, p.379 although some studies still unite haramiyids (or at least euharamiyids) and multituberculates in the Allotheria hypothesis.Butler & Hooker 2005, p.206 Most recently, haramiyidans have been found to be a monophyletic group of non- mammalian Mammaliaformes.

In many of these taxa, the coracoid bones (absent in modern therians but present in many other mammal groups, albeit highly reduced) are remarkably large and similar to those of birds and pterosaurs, presumably due to impact stresses at landing.Qing-Jin Meng; David M.

Since 2005, the published range extended to Mongolia and China. The age of haramiyid fossils range from Upper Triassic up to Late Cretaceous. This has important implications: the fact that haramiyids were present in the Late Triassic supports the idea that crown-group mammals originated at least 208 million years ago, much earlier than some previous research suggests. The youngest haramiyid fossil genus is Avashishta bacharamensis from the Maastrichtian of India. Cretaceous haramiyids are previously known from the Early Cretaceous of Morocco, suggesting that these animals may have survived in gondwannan landmasses as relics; the presence of the similarly aged Cifelliodon in North America suggests that contact between both landmasses remained for a while. With a temporal range of at least 150 million years, they are the longest lived mammaliaform lineage.Ashok Sahni, New evidence for palaeogeographic intercontinental Gondwana relationships based on Late Cretaceous-Earliest Palaeocene coastal faunas from peninsular India, Washington DC American Geophysical Union Geophysical Monograph Series 01/1987; 41:207‚Äì218.

He has directed television documentaries on philosophy, science and religion, originally broadcast in the United Kingdom by the BBC and Channel 4. Malone lives in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, and was the Green Party's parliamentary candidate for Scarborough and Whitby in the 2015 and 2017 general elections. Documentary career David Malone was born in North Shields and grew up in 1970s London. His father, Adrian Malone, was also a documentary filmmaker, who produced The Ascent of Man with Jacob Bronowski and directed Cosmos: A Personal Voyage with Carl Sagan. Malone spent nine years in America and studied biological anthropology at Swarthmore College before joining the BBC Science Department and working there for nine years. He ended up joining the production team for Horizon, a regular documentary series on science and philosophy. Malone then left and started his own documentary company, I-330 Films, and moved to North Yorkshire. I-330 Films was set up in 1995 by David Malone, and his brother James Malone. Malone was also listed as one of three Directors of becauseyouthink.tv, alongside David Paterson and Jan Klimkowski. Malone's Testing God was shortlisted for the Royal Television Society's best documentary series award in 2002. He is currently a member of the University of Bradford's Film and Media Professional Advisory Board, which ensures the courses and operations of the department remain up-to-date. In 2016, Malone produced, directed, and co-presented the four-part documentary series Why Are We Here? The programmes followed Malone and his co-presenter Ard Louis as they met scientists and philosophers including Frank Wilczek, Roger Penrose, Gregory Chaitin, and Jane Goodall as they attempted to reconcile questions of meaning and purpose with science. Political career In 2008 Malone began commenting on the financial pages of The Guardians website about the credit crunch and the ensuing financial crisis under the pseudonym Golem XIV, the name of a military supercomputer in a novel of the same name by the Polish science fiction writer Stanis≈Çaw Lem. Malone became a fierce critic of the bank bailouts arguing that they would lead to massive cuts in public spending. In November 2010 his book about the crisis, The Debt Generation, was published in the UK by Level Press. It had been edited by Mark Tanner from the different writings he had done in The Guardians comments section, which had totaled 600 pages of material. Malone was interviewed about his book by Max Keiser during Episode 114 of the Keiser Report, a program that features on Russia Today. In 2013 he was also interviewed over his book by Ross Ashcroft on his 'Renegade Economist' talk show. Malone has stood for election several times at various levels in Scarborough as a Green Party candidate: * 2009 County Council election, in Falsgrave and Stepney division, coming third with 21% of the vote * 2011 Scarborough Borough Council election, stood in Falsgrave ward coming fourth with 11% of the vote. * 2013 County Council election, in Falsgrave and Stepney division, coming fourth with 17% of the vote. * 2015 general election, in Scarborough and Whitby, coming fourth with 4.6% of the vote, 2,185 votes. * 2015 Scarborough Borough Council election, in Stepney Ward. * 2017 County Council election, in Falsgrave and Stepney division, coming second with 32% of the vote.http://elections.northyorks.gov.uk/electionresults/election/3/area/26 * 2017 general election, in Scarborough and Whitby, coming fifth with 1.8% of the vote, 915 votes. In 2016, Malone stood in the Green Party leadership election, following the announcement that incumbent leader Natalie Bennett would not be standing. He was running his campaign to encourage the party to focus more on finance and economics. During the campaign, he attended hustings and gave interviews to various news outlets covering the election. Left Foot Forward speculated that \\"he is likely to win the support of many not backing the Bartley-Lucas ticket\\" and \\"to come in the top three.\\" Voting took place from 25 July to 25 August, and the result was announced on 2 September at the party's Autumn Conference. The result was a victory for Jonathan Bartley and Caroline Lucas, who won as a job share candidacy with 86% of the vote. Malone came second with 956 votes, which equated to 6.1% of the vote.

(2002). A History of the World Speedway Championship. Stroud: Tempus Publishing. Career In 1985, his second season with the Reading Racers, the team won six major trophies. In 1993, he won the World Pairs Championship with Tony Rickardsson and reserve Henrik Gustafsson, and also won the British League Riders' Championship. His career was cut short when a crash during a league meeting in Poland in 1994 left him using a wheelchair for the rest of his life. In recognition of his contribution to the city of Toru≈Ñ, in April 2010 one of the streets was named after him. Per Jonsson became the first rider in history to win both the World and World Under-21 Championships. He won the Under-21 title in 1985 at Abensberg, West Germany when the title was still known as the European Speedway Under 21 Championship*. He then added to this with his 1990 World Championship win at the Odsal Stadium in Bradford, England. Per Jonsson's first appearance in a World Final was in 1987 at Amsterdam's Olympic Stadium. The final was held over two days and the 22-year-old finished 5th on both days and was classed as 5th overall. He qualified for the 1988 World Final at Vojens in Denmark and equalled his 1987 result by finishing in 5th place. Also in 1988, Jonsson won the famed Golden Helmet of Pardubice in Czechoslovakia, the oldest speedway race in the world. Jonsson became the first Swedish winner of the Golden Helmet since Leif Enecrona in 1968. Jonsson represented Sweden in the World Pairs Championship, reaching the Final each year from 1988 until 1993. He finished second with Jimmy Nilsen in 1989 in Leszno, Poland, second again Nilsen and Henrik Gustafsson in 1991 in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland, third with Gustafsson and Tony Rickardsson in 1992 in Lonigo, Italy, before winning the last ever World Pairs Championship with Rickardsson and Gustafsson in 1993 in Vojens. He also represented Sweden in the World Team Cup on seven occasions between 1985 and 1993. With Jonsson as part of the team, Sweden finished 4th in 1985 and 1986, 3rd in 1988 and 1989, 2nd in 1991 and 1992 and 3rd in 1993. After both teams had tied on 22 points, Jonsson defeated England's number 1 rider Kelvin Tatum in a runoff for 3rd in the 1988 WTC Final at the Veterans Memorial Stadium in Long Beach, USA, to ensure Sweden's place in the 1989 Final in Bradford. Tatum won the start and led Jonsson for 2 ¬º laps before the Swede moved underneath to give his team a hard-fought 3rd place. Despite riding for Sweden in the World Pairs and Team Cup competitions, Jonsson missed the 1989 British League season, preferring instead to enjoy the joys of fatherhood, though he did ride in Sweden for Elitserien club Stockholm United, winning the Swedish League Championship. He came back to international speedway in 1990, qualifying for his third World Final by finishing 2nd in both the Scandinavian and Intercontinental Finals, and then went one better in Bradford becoming Sweden's first Speedway World Champion since Anders Michanek won in 1974. Then with his British team the Reading Racers (who included Australian rider Todd Wiltshire who had finished 3rd behind Jonsson in the World Final), Per won both the 1990 British League Championship and the British League Knockout Cup. Following this, Jonsson captained the Swedish team on a short tour of Australia in January 1991, the first time since 1971/72 that a Swedish speedway team had toured down under. Sweden, whose lineup was Jonsson, Henrik Gustafsson, Jimmy Nilsen, Tony Rickardsson, Conny Ivarsson, Erik Stenlund and Peter Nahlin defeated the Phil Crump captained Aussies (who fielded 14 riders over the series) 3‚Äì2 in the five match series with Jonsson topping the averages for both teams with 16.4 per test. The Swede's proved a popular draw card in Australia.http://www.internationalspeedway.co.uk/ausvswe.htm Jonsson failed to place in the 1991 World Final at the Ullevi Stadium in G√∂teborg, finishing in 9th place while fellow Swede's Tony Rickardsson and Jimmy Nilsen finished in 2nd and 5th respectively. His 1992 World Final got off to a bad start in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland, when he failed to score in his first ride. He then came back to win three of his last four rides to finish in a clear 2nd place behind England's Gary Havelock. * The European Under 21 Championship was renamed the World Under 21 Championship in 1988.

Route description SR-57 begins at the junction with SR-10 near the Hunter Power Plant, three miles (5 km) southwest of Castle Dale, and runs almost straight north for almost four miles (6 km) until it nears Orangeville. It then bypasses Orangeville heading northwest.

History The road from SR-29 at Orangeville Junction south through Orangeville (along Main Street) to SR-10 was added to the state highway system in 1927 as a spur of SR-29, and in 1931 it was split off as SR-57.

She was responsible for delivering necessary goods and equipment to ships and stations in the war zone. Jupiter (AK-43) was built in 1939 as SS Flying Cloud by Federal Shipbuilding & Drydock Co., Kearny, New Jersey; she was later renamed SS Santa Catalina, She was acquired by the Navy 19 June 1941; the next day renamed Jupiter; and commissioned 22 August 1942, Lt. CDR. D. S. Baker in command.  World War II Pacific Theatre operations  Jupiter departed San Diego, California, 1 September for operations in the Pacific as the American campaign in the Solomon Islands was getting under way. From September through December she carried supplies and troops to staging areas for the Navy's first great offensive in the Pacific Ocean. She continued to discharge cargo in the Solomon Islands through the early part of 1943, bringing invaluable support to the closing phases of the Guadalcanal Campaign. = Transport of Japanese war materiel = Jupiter departed Espiritu Santo 1 February, commencing a series of three cruises to San Francisco for supplies and personnel. On the first of these voyages she returned captured Japanese equipment, including a \\"Betty\\" bomber, a \\"Tony\\" fighter, and several \\"long lance\\" torpedoes. = Island invasion support = The cargo ship returned to battle during the Gilbert Islands invasion late November, landing equipment to aid in the successful assault on Tarawa. Jupiter then continued cargo operations until she was assigned to the 5th Amphibious Forces in April 1944 for the Marianas campaign. She departed Pearl Harbor 30 May and arrived in the Saipan assault area 15 June. She discharged her cargo despite constant enemy air attack and 10 days later proceeded toward Eniwetok. = Invasion of the Philippines = Following a summer of amphibious rehearsals, Jupiter, under Comdr. J. M. Bristol, departed Guadalcanal 8 September to support the invasion of the Palau Islands. She unloaded her cargo without incident and returned to Manus to prepare for the important Philippine invasion. Departing Hollandia 16 October, she arrived at Leyte and commenced unloading cargo 22 October. As other units of the fleet were engaging the Japanese in the famed \\"Battle of Leyte Gulf\\", Jupiter returned to the Marianas to pick up additional material. She continued reinforcing units in the Philippines until she steamed into Ulithi 23 January 1945 to prepare for the next Campaign. When continued progress along the \\"road to Japan\\" required a stop-over base for B-29 raids on Tokyo, Iwo Jima was selected. Jupiter got underway 16 February with cargo and units of the 3rd Marine Division to secure this fortified atoll. After unloading her cargo under most difficult conditions, she remained in the area until Japanese resistance had ceased 16 March. = Supplying troops on Okinawa = After repairs at Pearl Harbor, Jupiter departed Hawaii on 1 May with supplies for American troops fighting for Okinawa.  End-of-war activity  She returned to San Francisco 27 July for conversion to an aviation supply ship and was redesignated AVS-8, 31 July 1945. Following replenishment-at-sea exercises the following year, she supported outlying bases and ships until decommissioning at San Diego 23 May 1947 and joining the reserve fleet.  Reactivated during Korean War  In June 1950 a new threat to world peace exploded in Asia- Communist aggression in South Korea. The United States answered this challenge by dispatching troops and supplies to the war-torn peninsula. USS Jupiter (AVS-8) recommissioned 10 October 1950, CDR. Hugh Robert McKibbin in command, and sailed for Yokosuka, Japan, 8 January 1951. Arriving 29 January, she operated out of Japan, replenishing units fighting ashore until returning to San Francisco 11 August 1952. After operations along the U.S. West Coast, the supply ship returned to the war zone in March 1953 to supply troops and replenish carriers engaged in air strikes on the Korean peninsula. Following the cessation of hostilities, Jupiter returned to the West Coast 3 October.  Operations in the Formosa Straits  This active ship was again deployed to the Pacific in 1954 to replenish ships in the tense Formosa area. The U.S. 7th Fleet prevented any major crisis from developing, and Jupiter steamed into San Francisco 20 October 1954. She resumed her operations in the Far East March 1955; this time for an extended period. For the next 9 years (1955‚Äì63) she operated out of Yokosuka, replenishing units of the 7th Fleet, as it took on greater roles in \\"keeping the peace\\". During Jupiter's service in the Far Pacific, the 7th Fleet averted major crises in Formosa, Indonesia, and Laos; and played an important part in the Vietnam struggle.  Post-Korean War decommissioning  She continued to carry vital supplies to the Far East until struck from the Navy List on 1 August 1965. Jupiter was then transferred to the Maritime Administration and joined the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Olympia, Washington, where she remained. She was struck from the Naval Register, 1 August 1965. Final disposition: sold for scrapping in March 1971.

In 1883 he moved to Fort Saskatchewan for ten years, returning to Edmonton in 1893. Upon his return, he engaged in real estate, building among other things the so-called \\"Heiminck Block\\" in downtown Edmonton. He first ran for office in the 1897 municipal election, running for alderman on the Edmonton Town Council. He was defeated, finishing seventh of nine candidates in a race in which the top six were elected. He was similarly unsuccessful in the 1900 election, when he finished fifth among eight candidates; owing to Edmonton's newly staggered aldermanic terms only the top three candidates were elected in that election. He was finally elected to a two year term in the 1903 election. He did not seek re-election at its conclusion. Phillip Heiminck died September 11, 1922.

The title was described as not taking place in the continuity of All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder. * All Star Comics: \\"The Will of William Wilson\\" ‚Äì An unpublished Justice Society of America story from the 1940s. A good amount of artwork from this story survived and has been reprinted in various publications from TwoMorrows Publishing. * All Star Wonder Woman ‚Äì This series was confirmed at the San Diego Comic Con 2006, with Adam Hughes announced as writer and artist. Hughes intended to retell the character's origin story, and described his approach to the series as an \\"iconic interpretation\\" of the character, but explained at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International that that project was \\"in the freezer\\" for the time being, due to the difficulty involved in both writing and illustrating it himself. As of October 2010, a page on his website indicated that after the current Catwoman series ended with issue #82, Hughes would cease his DC cover work and focus on producing the six-issue All Star Wonder Woman series. * Ambush Bug: Year None #6 ‚Äì A six-issue miniseries, it skipped issue #6 and concluded with issue #7 instead.

The first issue of the series was pencilled, but the project was ultimately shelved due to the character being used in writer/artist Mike Grell's high-profile Green Arrow: The Longbow Hunters series. Elements from the ill-fated project were used for Weisman's DC Showcase: Green Arrow short film. * Blue Beetle direct market series ‚Äì Following the cancellation of Blue Beetle's general market series in the late 1980s, a direct market-only series was set to follow. Originally, the plan was to end the first series with issue #21. However, the planned follow-up was cancelled as well, due to the belief that there was no audience for a \\"1960s-type\\" character like Blue Beetle; as a result, the series ended with issue #24. * Blue Devil #32‚Äì36 ‚Äì Blue Devil #31 was to be the beginning of a six-part storyline intended to revive the title, but it became the final issue of the series instead, presumably containing elements of the unpublished story. * Captain Atom graphic novel ‚Äì A Cary Bates/Pat Broderick graphic novel was listed as \\"upcoming\\" in Amazing Heroes Preview Special #10, but was described as being on \\"permanent hiatus\\" in the following issue. * Captain Atom miniseries ‚Äì A six-issue Captain Atom miniseries was planned to begin in July 1992.

With some changes, Byrne's concept fit in with his 2112 work to become the John Byrne‚Äôs Next Men series published by Dark Horse Comics. *The Great Ten #10 ‚Äì Although The Great Ten (by Tony Bedard and Scott McDaniel) was solicited and advertised as being a 10-issue miniseries, with each issue focusing on a different character, DC chose to end the series at #9 due to low sales. * Green Lantern: \\"Emerald Twilight\\" by Gerard Jones ‚Äì The original storyline for \\"Emerald Twilight\\" (which was written by Gerard Jones and set to run in Green Lantern vol. 3 #48‚Äì50) involved a conflict between two separate groups of the Guardians of the Universe, and members of the Green Lantern Corps choosing sides. Though this story was advertised and even solicited, it was not considered interesting enough by editor Kevin Dooley, and was replaced with a different story (scripted by Ron Marz) that had Hal Jordan becoming Parallax and destroying the Corps. Jones' version of \\"Emerald Twilight\\" has not been published. * Green Lantern: \\"The Image\\" ‚Äì During Len Wein and Dave Gibbons' run on Green Lantern in the 1980s, Wein planned to introduce a superhero called the Image whom he wanted to include in a potential spin-off.

The story was to involve the aftermath of Lucifer's stepping down as a ruler of Hell, with one plot point involving the birth of Swamp Thing's daughter Tef√© Holland. A contract dispute with DC led Veitch to pull out of the crossover. * Holy Terror, Batman! ‚Äì A proposed 122-page graphic novel by Frank Miller, announced in 2006, but no longer a project associated with the Batman character or DC Comics.

The project was never launched for unknown reasons. * Superman 3-D ‚Äì According to DC's promotional giveaway brochure DC Releases #46 (March 1988), a Superman 3-D one-shot was planned for 1988.

Ravven (born 1952) is the Bates and Benjamin Professor of Classical and Religious Studies at Hamilton College, where she has taught her specialization, Jewish Philosophy, and general Jewish Studies since 1983. She is a Fellow in Neurophilosophy of the Integrative Neurosciences Research Program, which is co-directed by Vilayanur Ramachandran and Kjell Fuxe. She has been appointed Visiting Professor of Philosophy in the School of Marxism at Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China, for 2017-20. Professor Ravven holds a Ph.D. from Brandeis University (1984), attended Smith College, and is a 1970 graduate of the Commonwealth School, Boston. Ravven was a founding member of the Society for Empirical Ethics, an organization devoted to promoting dialogue among philosophers, neurobiologists, psychologists, anthropologists, and other social and natural scientists about ethics.  Career  Ravven is a neurophilosopher and specialist on the philosophy of the seventeenth century philosopher, Baruch Spinoza. She was the first to argue that Spinoza's moral philosophy is a systems theory of ethics. Ravven was also the first philosopher to propose that Spinoza anticipated central discoveries in the neuroscience of the emotions. Ravven has published widely on Spinoza's philosophic thought, on the twelfth century philosopher Moses Maimonides, on G.W.F. Hegel and feminism, and on Jewish ethics and Jewish feminism. She has been active in the Academy for Jewish Philosophy, the International Neuroethics Society, the North American Spinoza Society, and is a member of the American Philosophical Association, the Association for Jewish Studies, the International Academy of Law and Mental Health, and the Society for Jewish Ethics. Ravven is a past member of the Advisory Editorial Board of the Journal of Systemics, Cybernetics, and Informatics.Journal of Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics She is responsible for advising and editorial activities in two areas: in Neurophilosophy and also in Ethics. In 2004 Ravven received an unsolicited $500,000 grant from the Ford Foundation to write a book rethinking ethics. That book, The Self Beyond Itself: An Alternative History of Ethics, the New Brain Sciences, and the Myth of Free Will was published by The New Press in May, 2013. It is an extended and multidisciplinary inquiry into moral agency: why we are moral, why and when we are not, and how to get people to be more moral. Ravven concludes with her own theory of moral agency inspired by the philosophy of Spinoza, which she updates to reflect contemporary understandings of how the brain/mind works in moral thinking and action. The book is accessibly written for a generally educated audience rather than just for specialists.  Writings  In The Self Beyond Itself: An Alternative History of Ethics, the New Brain Sciences, and the Myth of Free Will, Ravven challenges the idea of free will. Attributing free will to human beings means that human beings have the capacity to rise above both nature and nurture and even current situation to be good people and choose to act ethically. This capacity to choose our actions‚Äîto rise above our genetic inheritance whatever it might be, above our upbringing no matter how terrible it was, and above our present situation despite its social pressures‚Äîis what is meant by \\"free will.\\" We do moral acts for moral reasons, for no other fully determining reasons, and out of no other fully determining causes‚Äîsuch as brain modules, group pressures, or upbringing. And that is why we can be held morally responsible. Ravven argues that this view is false and also that it is a cultural belief particular to the Western world. She traces the belief in free will to a theological myth and notion of human nature, and exposes the origins of the idea of free will in the Christian theology of the Latin West originating in the Church Father St. Augustine. She describes how that theology became secularized so that many today are unaware than free will presupposes a human person beyond nature and environment who can intervene as if from above (like an all-powerful God). \\"The Self Beyond Itself\\" was translated into Chinese under the direction of Professor Han Quihong of Northeast Normal University in Changchun, China, and published by the People's Publishing House in 2016. Ravven turns to search the new brain sciences to discover new ways that moral agency could be rethought without free will. She concludes that there are three factors that together determine action: nature (biology, etc.), nurture (biography, history, culture, language, etc.), and present situation (social belonging and its demands, incentives, and disincentives, and the like). So the most effective way of changing individual behavior is to intervene in social and cultural and familial systems at every scale. Promoting and bolstering diversity and whistle blowing within all these systems is vital to combating the tendencies to Groupthink that human nature makes us all too prone to. For we are social and contextual beings‚Äîour brains have evolved that way. Nevertheless, as Spinoza anticipated, an arduous path of the education of desire can lead to independence of mind from the tyranny of the immediate local world for those who undertake it. We can learn to be good even if we cannot freely choose to be good. Heidi Ravven has written extensively on the philosophy of Baruch Spinoza. Her articles appear in a number of journals and several have been republished in anthologies. Ravven believes that Spinoza's philosophy is the best starting point for trying to integrate the evidence emerging from the new brain sciences into a viable model of the basic moral brain, the optimal route to its development, and the implications of such a view for how social, legal, political, and other institutions and practices might to be redesigned. Ravven is now engaged in writing a book accessible to a generally educated audience on the relevance of Spinoza, called The Return of Spinoza.

He is a five-times New York Times best-selling author as of 2012. Amen has built a profitable business around the use of SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) imaging for purported diagnostic purposes. His marketing of SPECT scans and much of what he says about the brain and health in his books, media appearances, and marketing of his clinics has been condemned by scientists and doctors as lacking scientific validity and as being unethical, especially since the way SPECT is used in his clinics exposes people to harmful radiation with no clear benefit. Amen has studied brain injuries affecting professional athletes, and has consulted on post- concussion issues for the National Football League. Early life and education Daniel Amen was born in Encino, California, in 1954 to Lebanese immigrant parents. He received his undergraduate biology degree from Southern California College in 1978 and his medical degree from Oral Roberts University School of Medicine in 1982. Amen did his general psychiatric training at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., and his child and adolescent psychiatry training at Tripler Army Medical Center in Honolulu. Amen is double board certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology in General Psychiatry and Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Career in business Amen is the chief executive officer and medical director of the six Amen Clinics. =SPECT scanning= Amen's practices use single-photon emission computed tomography, or SPECT, scans of brain activity in an attempt to compare the activity of a person's brain to a known healthy model. Amen prescribes both medication and non-medicative courses of treatment, depending on the case. He also performs before-and-after SPECT scans, which claim to assess the effectiveness of treatment. Amen's clinics claim to have the world's largest database of functional brain scans for neuropsychiatry. , Amen said he had scanned 50,000 people at an estimated cost of $170 million. John Seibyl of the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging has stated that it is settled that SPECT is of no value for diagnosing psychological disorders. A 2012 review by the American Psychiatric Association found that neuroimaging studies \\"have yet to impact significantly the diagnosis or treatment of individual patients.\\" The review also states that neuroimaging studies \\"do not provide sufficient specificity and sensitivity to accurately classify individual cases with respect to the presence of a psychiatric illness.\\" The American Psychiatric Association has concluded that \\"the available evidence does not support the use of brain imaging for clinical diagnosis or treatment of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents.\\" According to cognitive neuroscience researcher Martha Farah and psychologist S. J. Gillihan, \\"[t]he lack of empirical validation has led to widespread condemnation of diagnostic SPECT as premature and unproven.\\" Ethics of SPECT scanning Questions have been raised about the ethics of selling SPECT scans on the basis of unproven claims: neuroscience professor Martha Farah calls such use \\"profitable but unproven\\" and says: \\"Tens of thousands of individuals, many of them children, have been exposed to the radiation of two SPECT scans and paid thousands of dollars out of pocket (because insurers will not pay) against the advice of many experts\\". Professor of psychology Irving Kirsch has said of Amen's theory: \\"Before you start promulgating this and marketing it and profiting from it, you should ethically be bound to demonstrate it scientifically in a peer-reviewed, respected journal\\" as otherwise \\"you're just going down the path of being a snake oil salesman\\". In a 2011 paper the neuroscientist Anjan Chatterjee discussed example cases that were found on the Amen Clinic's website including a couple with marital difficulties and a child with impulsive aggression. The paper noted that the examples \\"violate the standard of care\\" because a normal clinical diagnosis would have been sufficient and that there \\"was no reason to obtain functional neuroimaging for diagnostic purposes in these cases.\\" Most patients do not realize that the SPECT scans rely on unproven claims. An initial session at one of Amen's clinics costs about $3,500. As reported by The Washington Post in 2012, officials at major psychiatric and neuroscience associations and research centers see Amen's claims for the use of SPECT as \\"no more than myth and poppycock, buffaloing an unsuspecting public.\\" =Work for athletes= One of Amen's clinics provides brain scans for current and former National Football League players. Amen made the initial diagnosis of brain damage in NFL kicker Tom Dempsey. During medical examinations and scans, Amen found three holes in Dempsey's brain, along with other damage. He has also provided diagnosis and therapy for hockey player Paul Kariya, related to his concussion issues; Amen advised Kariya to retire as a professional, which he did. =Dietary supplements= Amen's websites market vitamin supplements and a branded range of other dietary supplements. These supplements have been promoted for a number of health benefits, including a claimed ability to prevent or stop Alzheimer's disease--there is however no known benefit from taking such supplements except for specific substance deficiencies. Neurologist Robert Burton has written that he was \\"just appalled\\" by the things offered for sale on Amen's \\"big business\\" web sites, and Harriet Hall has said that Amen prescribes \\"inadequately tested natural remedies\\" and \\"irrational mixtures of nutritional diet supplements\\" as part of his treatment. Career in media =Writing= Amen's first book, Change Your Brain, Change Your Life, was published in 1999 and unexpectedly reached The New York Times best seller list after selling tens of thousands of copies in the first year. Publishers Weekly noted that the book \\"apparently struck a nerve with readers who love a 'scientific' hook.\\"\\". . . \\"the book's stronger than expected out-of-the-gate success.\\" In his book Making a Good Brain Great, he provided his analysis and recommendations for brain improvement purported to enhance a person's overall happiness and ability. For example, he suggested that hobbies which challenge the brain are important to ensure a happy life, as he believes they force the brain to learn and evolve over time. Davi Thornton characterized the book as consisting of \\"commonplace recommendations for self-improvement.\\" Healing the Hardware of the Soul, written by Amen in 2008, was reviewed in the American Journal of Psychiatry by Andrew Leuchter. \\"Dr. Amen makes a good case for the use of brain imaging to explain and medicalize mental disorders,\\" Leuchter said. \\"However, the reader who has any degree of familiarity with mental illness and brain science is left unconvinced that his [Amen's] highly commercialized use of scanning is justified.\\" Leuchter concluded that Amen \\"has not subjected his treatment approaches to the level of systematic scientific scrutiny expected for scientifically based medical practice.\\" In Amen's The Brain in Love, he described the brain activity that occurs during chanting meditation as similar to that which takes place during the feeling of love and sexual activity. In 2013 Amen co-authored with pastor Rick Warren The Daniel Plan: 40 Days to a Healthier Life, on \\"how to lead a healthy life\\". Amen was one of the people‚Äî others included Mark Hyman and Mehmet Oz‚Äîthat Warren recruited to help devise the program . Warren encouraged adoption of the plan by all member churches in his network of Saddleback churches. According to Janice Norris, \\"The Daniel Plan is ... more than a diet. It is a lifestyle program based on Biblical principles and five essential components: food, fitness, focus, faith, and friends.\\" Amen, Warren, and Hyman appeared on the television show The View to discuss the Daniel Plan, and 3,000 people came to a rally at Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California, to hear the three talk about the plan. In 2013 Amen released an updated version of Healing ADD from the Inside Out: The Breakthrough Program That Allows You to See and Heal the Seven Types of Attention Deficit Disorder. In 2017 Amen and his wife Tana published The Brain Warrior's Way: Ignite Your Energy and Focus, Attack Illness and Aging, Transform Pain into Purpose, which Harriet Hall reviewed; she wrote: \\"Much of the advice in this book is mainstream medical advice, and there are helpful practical hints like putting your food on a smaller plate and not shopping for food when you are hungry. The problem is that the good advice is inextricably mixed with false information and misleading statements, and with detailed recommendations that are not supported by science.\\" =Television programs= Amen has produced television programs about his theories. One of them, \\"Change Your Brain, Change Your Life,\\" was aired by PBS affiliates 1,300 times in 2008 during fund-raising drives. Another, \\"Magnificent Mind at Any Age with Dr. Daniel Amen,\\" was aired before January 1, 2009. Neurologist Michael Greicius, director of the Stanford Center for Memory Disorders and principal investigator of the Functional Imaging in Neuropsychiatric Disorders Laboratory at Stanford stated, \\"The PBS airing of Amen's program provides a stamp of scientific validity to work which has no scientific validity.\\" These programs have been described as infomercials for Amen's clinics. The program's depiction of the \\"wonders of ginkgo and other 'natural' products such as St. John's wort.\\" was also criticized. Alternative-medicine skeptic and physician Harriet A. Hall and neurologist Robert A. Burton criticized PBS for the airing of these programs. Michael Getler, the PBS ombudsman, replied that \\"PBS had nothing to do with the 'Brain' program's content and did not vet the program in any way.\\" Local PBS affiliates \\"make their own editorial decisions based on their own guidelines about what to air,\\" he wrote. Reception of ideas In 2012, The Washington Post Magazine ran a cover story titled \\"Daniel Amen is the most popular psychiatrist in America. To most researchers and scientists, that's a very bad thing.\\" The Washington Post detailed Amen's lack of acceptance among the scientific community and his monetary conflict of interest. Journalist Sanjiv Bhattacharya wrote that Amen's critics likened him \\"to a self-help guru rather than a scientist, on account of all the books, DVDs and nutritional supplements which he hawks so shamelessly on infomercials\\" and that Amen was \\"the most controversial psychiatrist in America [who] may also be the most commercially successful.\\" Amen has responded to such criticism by claiming that the criticism comes from jealousy of his financial success and also claiming that his largest source of referrals is from previous patients. In 2008, Tufts professor and author Daniel Carlat published an article on Amen's use of SPECT imaging. After visiting Amen's clinics, Carlat called Amen's interpretations of the scans \\"spectacularly meaningless.\\" Memberships and recognition Amen is a Distinguished Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association. He has also been an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry and human behavior in the University of California, Irvine, College of Medicine. Amen is the author of more than 30 books with combined sales of about one million copies. Five of his books have been The New York Times bestsellers as of 2012. In 2015, Amen's The Daniel Plan received the Christian Book of the Year Award.

He was extensively quoted in Giovanni Boccaccio's Genealogia Deorum Gentilium, but is otherwise almost unknown. Boccaccio says that he knew Theodontius's work through the Collections of Paul of Perugia, which Paul's wife burnt after his death (Genealogiae XV 6). In telling the legend of Bathyllus, however, Boccaccio complains that Theodontius was illegible except for Bathyllus's birth, from Phorcys and a marine monster (Genealogiae X 7), so he may have seen some of Theodontius's own writings; sources disagree on this. Some authorities think Boccaccio invented him. Outside Boccaccio, there was a Theodontius, who wrote on the wars of Troy, and is quoted by Servius on Aeneid, I, 28; and the fourteenth century author Domenico Bandini, who made an index for the Genealogiae, calls him \\"Teodontius Campanus diligens investigator poetici figmenti\\". Carlo Landi argued in his 1930 monograph Demogorgone that Boccaccio's Theodontius was a Campanian philosopher, from between the 9th and 11th centuries. Theodontius provided Boccaccio with euhemeristic and naturalistic interpretations of mythology, and philosophic speculations about mythology. He quotes the (also lost) Greek historian Philochorus. Most significantly, he is Boccaccio's source for the idea that all the gods were descended from Demogorgon, which Theodontius himself credited to Pronapides the Athenian.

In it, Wordsworth criticises the world of the First Industrial Revolution for being absorbed in materialism and distancing itself from nature. Composed circa 1802, the poem was first published in Poems, in Two Volumes (1807). Like most Italian sonnets, its 14 lines are written in iambic pentameter. Theme In the early 19th century, Wordsworth wrote several sonnets blasting what he perceived as \\"the decadent material cynicism of the time.\\" \\"The World Is Too Much with Us\\" is one of those works. It reflects his view that humanity must get in touch with nature to progress spiritually. The rhyme scheme of this poem is a-b-b-a, a-b-b-a, c-d-c-d, c-d. This Italian or Petrarchan sonnet uses the last six lines (sestet) to answer the first eight lines (octave). The first eight lines (octave) are the problems and the next six (sestet) are the solution. Summary Wordsworth gives a fatalistic view of the world, past and future. The words \\"late and soon\\" in the opening verse describe how the past and future are included in his characterization of mankind. The author knows the potential of humanity's \\"powers\\", but fears it is clouded by the mentality of \\"getting and spending.\\" The \\"sordid boon\\" we have \\"given our hearts\\" is the materialistic progress of mankind. The detriment society has on the environment will proceed unchecked and relentless like the \\"winds that will be howling at all hours\\". The speaker complains that \\"the world\\" is too overwhelming for us to appreciate it, and that people are so concerned about time and money that they use up all their energy. These people want to accumulate material goods, so they see nothing in Nature that they can \\"own\\", and have sold their souls. Unlike society, Wordsworth does not see nature as a commodity. The verse \\"Little we see in Nature that is ours\\", shows that coexisting is the relationship envisioned. We should be able to appreciate beautiful events like the moon shining over the ocean and the blowing of strong winds, but it is almost as if humans are on a different wavelength from Nature. The \\"little we see in Nature that is ours\\" exemplifies the removed sentiment man has for nature, being obsessed with materialism and other worldly objects. Wordsworth's Romanticism is best shown through his appreciation of nature in these lines and his woes for man and its opposition to nature. The relationship between Nature and man appears to be at the mercy of mankind because of the vulnerable way nature is described. The verse \\"This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon\\", gives the vision of a feminine creature opening herself to the heavens above. The phrase \\"sleeping flowers\\" might also describe how nature is being overrun unknowingly and is helpless. The verse \\"I, standing on this pleasant lea, have glimpses that would make me less forlorn\\", reveals Wordsworth's perception of himself in society: a visionary romantic more in touch with nature than his contemporaries. The speaker would rather be a pagan who worships an outdated religion so that when he gazes out on the ocean (as he's doing now), he might feel less sad. If he were a pagan, he would have glimpses of the great green meadows that would make him less dejected. He'd see wild mythological gods like a Proteus, who can take many shapes, and Triton, who can soothe the howling sea waves. Critical analysis  Metaphor The metaphor ‚Äúwe have given our hearts away, a sordid boon‚Äù is also an oxymoron. Sordid suggests the worst aspects of human nature such as immorality, selfishness and greed, while a boon is something that functions as a blessing or benefit. The contradiction between the meanings of the words suggests that materialism is a destructive and corrupt blessing which the industrial revolution has produced. It emphasises the tension between the good exterior and the sordid truth behind materialism. On an exterior level, material goods bring pleasure and are a symbol of man‚Äôs progress; however, in truth, they feed the worst aspects of humanity: thus a \\"sordid boon.\\" Sonnet form Wordsworth employs a strictly structured form, the Italian sonnet, which conforms to a set of strict conventions. As in many sonnets by the Romantic poets, he creates a tension between the emotional, natural, and fluid themes explored in the poem and the structured form of the sonnet. This tension reflects what was occurring during the Romantic Era, in which artists and poets were rebelling in the structured world of the neoclassical period. Employing the familiar with the new and revolutionary-Wordsworth uses the familiar structure of the sonnet as well as referring to familiar ancient Gods (in the authors context they would have been familiar) to persuade the reader to engage in a positive way to the concepts addressed. The unfamiliar or unknown is always feared and suppressed thus by incorporating the familiar with the revolutionary the reader in the 19th century is more likely to engage positively with Wordsworth‚Äôs message. Repetition and rhyming scheme The repetitive rhyme scheme ABBAABBA, and the use of word pairs such as ‚Äúgetting and spending‚Äù and ‚Äúlate and soon‚Äù emphasises the monotonous nature of modern life and materialism. Getting and spending is a cluster of longer emphasised words with many consonants, also possibly emphasising this view. In essence, materialism is just that getting and spending: it is devoid of emotion or a true fulfilling purpose. In many ways the stereotypes of man and woman mirror the difference between the neoclassical and romantic period between civilised and nature. Men in this context are associated with rationality, strength, order and power, whereas women are associated with emotion and the imagination. Music and harmony The line, \\"For this, for everything we are out of tune\\" implies that man is out of tune with nature, unable to live in harmony with the world around him. By describing the harmonious relationship of man and nature as a tune, Wordsworth evokes a sensuous experience of nature. Collective pronouns Wordsworth uses the words \\"we\\" and \\"us.\\" This includes the reader, once again positioning the reader to engage with the poem. Imagery In the simile \\"and are up gathered now like sleeping flowers,\\" sleeping flowers suggest that man is numb and unaware of the beauty and power of the natural world. At the same time, however, there is also a certain optimism: the image of sleeping flowers implies that humans are only dormant, and that there is some hope we will wake up and realise the power of nature.

It is the first book in the ongoing fantasy trilogy The Kingkiller Chronicle, followed by The Wise Man's Fear. It was published on March 27, 2007, by DAW Books. Writing history Rothfuss wrote The Name of the Wind while working on his Bachelor of Arts in English. He drew inspiration from the idea that he wanted a completely new kind of book without the generic characteristics of fantasy. Before its release, an excerpt from the novel was released as a short story titled The Road to Levinshir, which won the Writers of the Future contest in 2002. A sequel entitled The Wise Man's Fear was released on March 1, 2011 by DAW Books. Plot The Kingkiller Chronicle takes place in the fictional world of Temerant, a large continent of which the known part, called the Four Corners of Civilization, is divided into several distinct nations and cultures. Much of the world follows a religion similar, though not identical, to medieval Christianity. Coexisting alongside the mortal world is the realm of The Fae, a parallel universe inhabited by supernatural creatures which can move between the two realms only when the moon is full. Magic exists in Temerant, too, but obeys a well-defined set of rules and principles that can only be exploited by those who have trained in its professional and scientific use. As the novel begins, the reader hears an old storyteller speaking of a famous old wizard called Taborlin the Great, who was captured by evil beings called the Chandrian. Escaping them, Taborlin fell from a great height‚Äîbut since he knew the \\"Name of the Wind\\", he called it and the Wind came and set him down safely. In later parts of the book, characters are often skeptical of such stories. Some kinds of magic are taught in the University as academic disciplines and have daily-life applications (those who can afford it are able to buy magical lamps, for example, much better than the candles used by poorer people). However, most of the population does not have reliable knowledge of the magical disciplines and many still doubt that magicians can truly call upon the Wind. The Chandrian‚Äîwhose appearance is supposedly heralded by flames turning blue‚Äîare often dismissed as mythical bogeymen. In the rural town of Newarre, the Waystone Inn is managed by an innkeeper named Kote and his assistant Bast. It is revealed that Kote is actually the renowned Kvothe: an unequaled sword fighter, magician, and musician, rumored to have killed a king - earning the title Kingkiller - and caused the present war in which the civilized world is embroiled. Bast is Kvothe's assistant and student and a prince of the Fae. Kvothe has gone into hiding and assumed the identity of Kote in order to keep a low profile. Kvothe saves a traveling scribe known as Chronicler from spider-like creatures called scrael, whereupon Chronicler, recognizing Kvothe, asks to record his story. Upon consenting, Kvothe tells Chronicler that this will take three days (corresponding to the planned trilogy of novels). Kvothe begins his story during his childhood, when he lived amongst a troupe of highly reputed traveling performers known as Edema Ruh. His loving parents train him from a young age as an actor, singer, and lute player. He does extremely well in all of these as in every other field to which he turns his hand. The troupe acquires the scholar and arcanist Abenthy, who trains Kvothe in science and sympathy: a discipline that creates links from one physical object to allow manipulation of another. Kvothe also witnesses Abenthy calling the wind to fend off suspicious townspeople and vows to discover the titular \\"name of the wind\\", permitting this control. Kvothe's father, the famous bard Arliden, starts composing what was to be the greatest of his works‚Äîa ballad of the ancient tragic hero Lanre. For this composition, Arliden starts collecting all the various tales of the mythical Chandrian and tries to get at the kernel of truth behind them‚Äîwithout explaining how this is related to Lanre. This inquiry turns out to have fatal consequences. When the troupe makes camp, Kvothe's mother sends him to gather sage in the surrounding woods. Upon returning, he finds his parents and all members of his troupe dead, and the all-too-real Chandrian seated around the campfire, which has turned blue. They disliked Arliden's researches and came to silence him and everybody else with whom he might have shared his findings. The eleven-year- old Kvothe is on the point of being killed by the Chandrian named Cinder when their leader, Lord Haliax, pressures them to depart due to the approach of some mysterious enemies of theirs. The traumatized Kvothe, alive but alone, spends three years in the slums of the city of Tarbean as a beggar and pickpocket. He is nudged out of this life by hearing a storyteller recount a story of how the hero Lanre became a renegade after the death of his beloved wife, went over to the evil forces he had fought and destroyed the cities with whose protection he was charged‚Äîand then changed his name and became himself the fearsome Lord Haliax of the Chandrian. Before Kvothe can ask more, the storyteller is arrested by the dominant Church on charges of heresy. Kvothe then resolves to get into the University, whose vast Archives include all kinds of accumulated knowledge, including, presumably, also on the Chandrian. Having through great effort obtained some minimal funds for both clothing and traveling, he sets out. En route Kvothe becomes enamored with a talented young woman known as Denna, who is a musician like himself. Kvothe enters the University despite his lack of tuition funds and performs admirably as a student, but faces continuous poverty and rivalries with the wealthy student Ambrose Jakis and the arrogant Master Hemme, who sees that Kvothe receives lashing for misbehaviour. A trick by Ambrose causes Kvothe to be banished from the Archives, hampering his research on the Chandrian, though he does very well in other fields of study, advancing extremely fast in academic degrees and gaining some loyal friends. Kvothe buys a lute despite his poverty, and performs brilliantly at a famous musical tavern to earn money, where he also befriends Denna again. Hearing reports of blue fire and murder at a rural wedding, he suspects the Chandrian and visits the site. There, Kvothe and Denna meet a local farmer who reported the blue fire, and later, as they are searching for the Chandrian, they encounter a draccus, which nearly destroys the local town before it is slain by Kvothe. He does succeed in discovering the reason the Chandrian murdered all of the wedding's participants: the bride's father had dug in the earth and discovered an old pot on which were paintings of all seven Chandrian; they came to recover the pot and kill anyone who may have seen it. Back at the University, Ambrose taunts Kvothe and breaks his lute. In a fit of rage, Kvothe unintentionally calls the name of the wind, breaking Ambrose's arm in the process. As a result of the confrontation, Kvothe is sentenced to further lashing but avoids expulsion. Thanks to his clear magical aptitude, he is also promoted in rank as a student under Master Namer Elodin's tutelage. In the inn at the present day, a mercenary possessed by a supposed skin dancer attacks the patrons and kills one of them. When Kvothe seemingly fails to use magic to help, the skin dancer dies after the local blacksmith's apprentice, Aaron, strikes the possessed mercenary with a rod of iron. The first day ends when Kvothe finishes the first chapter of his story and the town settles down for the night after the commotion. At night, Bast breaks into Chronicler's room and reveals Chronicler's coming was part of his plan all along. He threatens Chronicler to focus Kote on the more heroic aspects of his story in the hope that he will abandon his apathy and return to his former heroic self. In the epilogue, it is implied Bast's fears are well- founded, as the present-day Kvothe is described as just a man \\"waiting to die.\\" Awards and honors #Quill Award (2007) ‚Äì Science Fiction/Fantasy/Horror #\\"Best Books of the Year\\" (2007) ‚Äì Publishers Weekly ‚Äì Science Fiction/Fantasy/Horror #Alex Award (2008) ‚Äì Young Adult Library Services Association (YALSA) #Reader's Choice(2008) ‚Äì SF Site In popular culture *Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish wrote and performed a song called \\"Edema Ruh\\" on their album Endless Forms Most Beautiful (2015), named after the traveling people in The Name of the Wind. *In the reboot Mystery Science Theatre 3000: The Return, season 1 episode 8, Crow comments on a scene of travelers with wagons and carts, \\"Oh, it's the Edema Ruh.\\" *The electro-pop band Shaed is named after the magical cloak made of shadows in The Name of the Wind. *In the Tabletop games \\"King of Tokyo\\" and \\"King of New York\\", the Draccus from \\"The Name of the Wind\\" is a playable monster that was released as a special promotional character at GenCon.

Prior to this career, Fell served in the Parachute Regiment.https://ftgetgo.wordpress.com/2014/01/31/exclussive-an-interview- with-stuart-fell/ He has appeared on British television many times, with his earliest role being in the LWT comedy series Hark at Barker, in which he plays the driver of a car that crashes when he's distracted by Ronnie Barker carrying a mannequin. In 1971, he appeared as an uncredited extra in the Doctor Who serial Terror of the Autons, and his last role came in 1998, as a stuntman in Duck Patrol. He worked in over twenty Doctor Who stories in all, from 1971 to 1983, most often as a stuntman or actor, though he served once as a fight arranger in 1981. He was Dennis Moore on horseback in Monty Pythons Flying Circus, literally sitting in for John Cleese. His small size made him ideal for a number of roles. He was able to get inside a number of small, cramped costumes and even doubled for Katy Manning and Louise Jameson (wearing their costumes on both occasions!). His large range of varied skills also earned him considerable praise. In several DVD commentaries, a number of people have remarked that \\"he could do anything\\" from juggling, fire- breathing, acrobatics, stilt-walking and ride a motorcycle. As a relatively young newcomer to stunt work, he was eager to prove himself. One example was in The Claws of Axos, where he is shot and then flipped backwards on a wire rig. He became well known within the series for a number of instances, one being a stunt in which he performed an (unpaid) back flip when he \\"died\\" in The Sea Devils. He also had to stand in for Kevin Lindsay in The Sontaran Experiment when Lindsay's heart condition made it too difficult for him to complete his lengthy fight scene. Another notable instance was in The Invasion of Time, in which he improvised a jump (in full costume) and almost fell down as he landed on a folding chair. He then fell over a chair thrown at him to only narrowly stop himself from rolling into location's swimming pool. The whole sequence ended up being used in the final version. Stuart Fell explained, in a 2004 documentary, that he was encouraged to improvise and the it was felt that these trips made the scenes more interesting. He played minor parts in three episodes of Blake's 7. He appeared in television adaptations of Hamlet, The Mayor of Casterbridge and The Old Curiosity Shop. He has appeared in The Empire Strikes Back, the first two Superman films, three James Bond films, Aliens and Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Most of his film work was as a stunt man. Fell is currently a professional juggler, is a member of The Magic Circle, and appeared on the Antiques Roadshow as an unnamed member of the public demonstrating his collection of yo-yos, diablos and other conjuring toys. He appeared in the Time Quest 2009 Doctor Who convention, where he took part in signings, panels and photo shoots with attendees. He also dressed as a jester and attracted very large queues. His panel was the most visited of the day just behind Tom Baker.

The founder of the school was Dr. James Robert Knox, Apostolic Internuncio of India in 1962. Following the C.B.S.E system of education, St. Mary's is spread over a comfortably sized campus in the heart of Kasauli. The school educates boys and girls of all castes and religions.  History  Initially the school started as a day boarding with just eight students, and consisted of a small building situated near the historic military hospital established in 1861. The school officially came into existence in 1958 under control of the St. Patrick's Church in Kasauli. Baltazar Pereira was the parish priest, in charge of the church. He headed the school for a few years and soon started facing difficulties due to the growing number of students. It was then that the Bishop of the Simla Diocese invited the congregation of The Sisters of the Destitute to take over the school. Since then the school has been under the management of these nuns who belong to the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church. The management also runs the Sacred Heart Convent School at Jagadhri. The school started imparting quality education and the number of students increased rapidly. The main building came into existence in the 1970s near the St. Patrick's Church Kasauli built by the British Army. The school now runs a boarding school for girls. St.Patrick's Church St.Patrick's Church  St. Patrick's Church  St. Patrick's is located at the highest point of the school campus. Built in 1847, it was maintained by the Kasauli garrison. It was run by the Franciscan missionaries of the English province. The church was erected by contributions from the East India Company, Father Candidus, the 32nd (Cornwall) Regiment and Her Majesty's 61st Regiment (61st foot-Irish regt.) The church mainly served the Irish soldiers posted at Kasauli. Candidus was the first priest to run the church. According to the church records the earliest baptism was in 1853. A girl named Fanny (daughter of Edward and Elizabeth) was baptised on 27 February 1853 by Candidus. St. Patrick's is a Roman Catholic church that comes under the administration of the Simla-Chandigarh Diocese where the Bishop is the head. The church is managed by a parish priest who is a member of the diocese. The church still maintains its grandeur and is famous for its unique wooden interiors. The present Parish Priest is Titus Babu of the Simla Chandigarh Diocese. He is also the chaplain for the sisters of the covent.

It was in operations at the turn of the 20th Century and underwent numerous mergers and changes before becoming BMW. Early engines Karl Rapp and Julius Auspitzer founded Karl Rapp Motorenwerke GmbH (Rapp Motorenwerke) with a capital stock of RM 200,000 on 29 April 1913 on the site of Flugwerke Deutschland GmbH (after the company went into liquidation). General Consul Auspitzer was the company's sole shareholder, with the operational side of the company managed by Karl Rapp. The idea was for the new company to build and sell \\"engines of all types, in particular internal combustion engines for aircraft and motor vehicles\\", in addition to building an engine for the second Kaiserpreis (Kaiser's Trophy) rally, but it was not ready in time. Before World War I, Rapp produced both in-line 6-cylinder and V8 cylinder water- cooled aeroengines. The in-line 6-cylinder produced 125 hp @ 215 kg (474 lb); with a 901 cu in (14.8-litre) displacement. Soon, the company made the Rapp II, which increased the power output to 150 hp @ 260 kg (573 lb). Shortly thereafter, early into World War I, the Rapp III 175 hp (actual 162 hp @ 1400 rpm) 295 kg (651 lb) six-cylinder aeroengine was manufactured. The V8 they developed was 1201 cu in (19.7-litre), producing 200 hp @ 300 kg (661 lb). All of Rapp's designs were overhead cam, with forged steel liners screwed to cast steel heads. The aeroengines produced by Rapp were easily distinguished from the other aeroengines (Mercedes, Benz, Basse, Selve, etc.), because the vertical shaft that drove the overhead camshaft came up between cylinders #4 and #5, instead of at the rear. Additionally, all the cylinders were in pairs. When World War I broke out, German military authorities placed orders with Rapp Motorenwerke. With the influx of capital, the company expanded rapidly and employed 370 workers by 1915. In response to a commission from the German military authorities, Karl Rapp increased the output of his Rapp III engine from 150 to 175 horsepower. However, the strengthening which this called for made the engine extremely heavy, and the engines developed severe vibrations; so much so, that it achieved no commercial success. Even a revised version with four valves per cylinder, the Rapp IIIa, was unable to rectify this situation: the name Rapp had suffered to such an extent that the military departments no longer purchased engines from his company. Wartime production At the beginning of the First World War, the company was one of the key Bavarian companies for the war effort, and appeared to have gained a certain reputation, despite the fact that none of the designs and developments achieved any real success (the Prussian Army Administration rejected a delivery of Rapp engines as unsuitable). Franz Josef Popp had noted the facilities of Rapp Motorenwerke were ideal for engine production, having the necessary workforce and equipment. Popp lobbied hard to manufacture, by license, the 12-cylinder Austro-Daimler aircraft engine. Popp succeeded in convincing the Bavarian Army Administration and the Imperial Naval Office of the Imperial Austro-Hungarian Army Administration to order Rapp engines licensed through Austro-Daimler. On behalf the Austrian war Ministry, Popp was delegated to supervise the handling of the order in Munich. Popp was also the person who convinced Max Friz, an aircraft engine designer and engineer at Daimler, to come to Munich to assist in development and expansion. With Friz' arrival in 1916, the original Rapp designs were also worked on to create a \\"high altitude\\" aeroengine that would give the Imperial Army strategic air superiority in combat. 1917 marks the breakthrough by Friz and his team of engineers in developing the type III. BMW Type III On 20 May 1917, Rapp Motorenwerke registered the documentation for the construction design for the new engine, dubbed \\"type III\\". Friz' design, (based on Karl Rapp's original design) was laid out as an in-line six-cylinder, which guaranteed optimum balance, with few small vibrations. The engine was successful, but the real breakthrough came in 1917, when Friz integrated a basically simple throttle butterfly into the \\"high-altitude carburettor\\", enabling the engine to develop its full power high above the ground. This is precisely the reason why the engine, now dubbed \\"type IIIa\\", had unique superiority in air combat. Franz- Zeno Diemer, the pioneering aviator and test pilot for the company, sets a new world altitude record with a 32,000 ft (9,760 m) flight in 1919 flying a DFW F 37/III (experimental two-seater, often referred to as the C-IV) with a BMW Type IV aircraft engine. September of the same year, Diemer set another world altitude record- this one for a passenger aircraft (8 people on board, 6,750 meters) in a Ju F-13 powered by a BMW IIIa aircraft engine. Rapp Motorenwerke changes to BMW GmbH BMW IVa - This engine set the world altitude record in 1919 by Franz Zeno Diemer The decision by the Prussian Army Administration to order 600 units of the innovative high-altitude aeroengine (project name \\"BBE\\"), prompted reorganizing the legal structure of the company. The aeroengine developed by Friz had turned Rapp Motorenwerke into an essential contributor to the war effort virtually overnight. From the middle of 1917 onward, the business, which would probably have disappeared from history never to be heard of again, now enjoyed the undivided attention of the armed services and other governmental bodies. Large subsidies flowed in and the Munich company received well financed production orders. The recognition that Max Friz gained with his engine made it clear to all the senior managers that up to now Karl Rapp and his inadequate engine designs had held the company back from success. In Friz they now had an excellent chief designer on hand and were no longer dependent on Rapp. Therefore, on 25 July 1917 the partners in the company terminated Karl Rapp‚Äôs contract. The end of this collaboration had been coming for a long time. When Rapp‚Äôs departure was finally a certainty, another important decision had to be made. If the man who had lent his name to the company was now leaving it, a new name was naturally required. So, on 21 July 1917, Rapp Motorenwerke GmbH was renamed Bayerische Motorenwerke GmbH. It was thus the first company to bear this name and to use the abbreviation ‚ÄúBMW‚Äù. BMW AG acknowledges this date to be the official beginning of the company we know today. The departure of Karl Rapp enabled a fundamental restructuring of BMW GmbH. While the development side was placed under Max Friz as Chief Designer, Franz Josef Popp took over the post of Managing Director. Until the end of the war, aeroengines remained the company's only product. The BBE aeroengine project was a big success under the designation BMW IIIa.

It was reorganized into Bayerische Flugzeugwerke, which was merged into BMW AG in 1922. Beginnings In 1910, Gustav Otto founded the \\"Aeroplanbau Otto- Alberti\\" workshop at the Puchheim airfield, where Gustav, along with a few others, flew machines made of wood, wire, and canvas and were powered by an engine. Through their passion for these flying machines, they helped transform aviation from a do-it-yourself hobby to a genuine industry vital to the military, especially after the breakout of World War I. Ernst Udet, the second highest scoring German flying ace of World War I (second only to the Red Baron), earned his pilots license from private training with Gustav during this time. Gustav Otto Flugmaschinenfabrik In 1911 Gustav moved the company and renamed it \\"Gustav Otto Flugmaschinenfabrik\\". The official entry appears as No. 14/364: \\"Gustav Otto in Munich, flying machine factory, office at 72 Karlstrasse.\\" Shortly afterwards, Otto moved the workshop from its original location at 37 Gabelsberger Strasse to new premises at 135 Schleissheimer Strasse. Biplane produced by Gustav Otto Flugmaschinenfabrik in 1914 In 1914 construction started on a new factory at 76 Neulerchenfeldstrasse (later Lerchenauer Stra√üe). Gustav moved the company to the new factory on Lerchenauer Strasse just east of the Oberwiesenfeld troop maneuver area in the Milbertshofen district of Munich, later to become the site of Munich's first airport. He wanted to be closer to the German government's procurement process for military sale. In 1915, the company is again renamed to \\"Otto Werke, Gustav Otto, M√ºnchen\\". Shortly thereafter, Otto established another company named AGO Flugzeugwerke at Berlin's Johannisthal Air Field. While the designs by Gustav Otto were initially successful, he was continually experiencing problems related to cost-effective production, as well as generating profits. At the start of the war, Otto Werke was supplying the German Air Force, but as the war progressed so did production problems. Eventually, the government agencies urged the company to nationalize its production. The stress of wartime and ongoing financial problems with the company proved too great a burden for Gustav, who suffered health issues. At the insistence of the Bavarian and Prussian War Ministries (and in particular the Inspectors of the Engineering Corps) the unprofitable aircraft manufacturer was taken over by the German Government, and Gustav Otto was forced to resign from his company. A consortium of banks took over the assets of the company. Otto Werke was reorganized into Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG on 7 March 1916. In the summer of 1916 thirteen Otto C.I twin-boom aircraft were delivered to the Bulgarian Air Force.Yordan Milanov: The aviation in Bulgaria in the wars from 1912 to 1945, Vol.I.

The case raised questions before and after the execution about how the death penalty was applied in Washington state, especially in cases where a defendant refused to present a defense in the penalty phase and refused to allow the filing of any appeals. Crimes In 1964, Elledge robbed a Western Union office in Albuquerque, New Mexico. During this robbery, he also kidnapped a female attendant.Rebekah Denn. Dispute embroils killer's request to die.

He was sentenced to prison in Santa Fe, New Mexico and, after his parole, he moved to Seattle, Washington, where he killed motel manager Bertha Lush in 1974 by beating her to death with a ball- peen hammer in an argument over his bill. While in prison for that crime, he was paroled three times, the last of which happened in August 1995. On April 18, 1998, Elledge invited Eloise Fitzner and her friend, only referred to as \\"S.C.\\", into a Bible-study room of a church where he worked as a custodian. After closing the door, he pulled a knife and bound the two women's wrists and ankles. He put a sweatshirt over S.C.'s head and made her face the wall. When S.C. heard struggling behind her, she tried to see what was happening. Elledge noticed this and threatened to kill S.C. next if she did not remain faced to the wall. Elledge first strangled Ms. Fitzner with his hands and then, not sure if she was dead, he fatally stabbed her in the neck. After hiding the body, Elledge abducted S.C. and drove them home in Ms. Fitzner's car. At his home, he sexually assaulted S.C. and released her the following day. S.C. immediately went to police. Elledge was arrested two days later and confessed. Trial and execution On May 27, 1998, Elledge plead guilty to aggravated first degree murder. He forbade his lawyer from presenting any defense during the penalty phase.Rule, Ann Last Dance, Last Chance and Other True Cases (2003) pp. 391-394JAMES HOMER ELLEDGE: Catholic bishops seek clemency Kitsap Sun (2001-08-23) When he testified himself he said: \\"that there is a very wicked part of me.

Robinson, Vivienne Osborne and Preston Foster. It was based on a successful Broadway play of the same name by Elliott Lester. The title refers to the two seconds it takes the condemned person to die in the electric chair after the executioner throws the switch. Preston Foster reprises the role he played on the Broadway stage.Two Seconds as produced on Broadway at the Ritz Theatre October 9, 1931 to November 1931, 59 performances, IBDb.com; accessed October 17, 2014. Plot Tony (J. Carrol Naish) and John (Edward G. Robinson) in Two Seconds As John Allen (Edward G. Robinson), a condemned murderer, is led to the electric chair, a witness asks the prison warden how long it takes for the condemned person to die. \\"A strongly built man like John Allen?\\" he is told, \\"It'll take two seconds\\". The witness remarks, \\"That'll be the longest two seconds of his life.\\" As the executioner throws the switch, the events that led up to the execution appear in flashback. Allen works with his friend and flatmate Bud Clark (Preston Foster), as a riveter, high up on the girders of a skyscraper under construction, getting paid $62.50 a week, \\"more than a college professor\\". Bud is engaged to be married, and tries to set up a date for Allen that night, but Allen expresses some disinterest, as Bud keeps setting John Allen up with \\"firewagons\\", his term for fat girls. Bud and John go out on the town after Bud winning $38 on the horses. John sees that the girl that Bud's girl has brought along for him to double date is the \\"firewagon\\" (June Gittelson), so he splits off on his own, going to a Taxi dance hall nearby, where he meets dancer Shirley Day (Vivienne Osborne). After dancing and talking to Shirley for some time, he indicates that they should talk some more. \\"Can't. Gotta have a ticket\\". \\"Well OK\\", Allen dozily says. \\"Get a handful so we can dance a lot together\\". In the five minutes Allen is away buying tickets, Shirley has gone off with another customer. That customer gropes her, and Shirley Day causes a scene, shouting at the customer. \\"He paid a dime and he thinks that entitles him to privileges\\". John Allen wades in, punching the customer to the floor. Tony, the dance hall owner (J. Carrol Naish), tells them both to get out, firing Shirley Day. Allen then takes Shirley for a milk shake. Allen had earlier said to Shirley that he wanted a woman with an education, aspirations: \\"Ain't no use both of us being dumb\\". She feigns respectability, telling him that she only works in the dance hall to support her sick parents, who live on a farm in Idaho and that she is educated (\\"I've got a year of high school, wish I'd have stuck it out\\"). Shirley pretends to be interested in attending a lecture with him. Later, Bud is remonstrating with John about him having hooked up with \\"a dance hall dame\\". \\"How much money has she had off you\\" Bud asks. \\"Not a red cent. \\"We're going to a lecture\\", John said. Bud: \\"if a dame tells a guy she's going to a lecture that means one thing, she's got designs on him\\". John indicates that he doesn't want to fall out with Bud, trying to get him to like Shirley: \\"She knows things\\". Bud: \\"That dame don't need to go to school, she knows everything\\". As John leaves, Bud says more cheerily, \\"Come home sober and bring me a lollipop\\". Instead of taking John to \\"a lecture\\", Shirley takes him to a speakeasy where she gets him drunk on \\"tea\\", bootleg gin was served in teapots to disguise its true nature, as alcohol was illegal then, due to prohibition. When John Allen protests, she says stupidly that they can \\"catch the second show\\" of the lecture. John Allen is drunk after the first floor show, drunk, bored and belligerent. He says that Shirley herself shouldn't drink too much. She intones \\"I must, because of my problems\\". \\"What problems\\", John Allen responds. Shirley starts crying: \\"Don't do that\\" John says, \\"not when I'm drunk, I hate that\\". He then brightens up a bit smiling with realisation \\"I'm drunk\\". Liquor was illegal and managing to get \\"blind drunk\\" (sometimes literally, the substances being methanol, not alcohol) was something of an achievement to them. Shirley Day kisses him, cheering him up greatly. \\"You know I like that\\" he says. Shirley responds, \\"Would you like more?\\". Shirley drags John to a justice of the peace (Otto Hoffman). Allen thinks he is still in the speakeasy. He still has a teacup hooked on his finger and is yelling for a waiter to get more drink. The Justice of the Peace says Allen is too drunk, but Shirley bribes him with $10, and indicates that she already has a ring, which she has had for some weeks. When Shirley and a stupefied John Allen return to his apartment, Shirley has a blazing argument with Bud. Bud: \\"You dirty little ape, did you rope him in? Didn't take you long to find out he can't hold his liquor\\". Shirley shows him the ring. \\"We're married, right square and legal, and there's nothing that you or anyone else can do about it\\". Shirley throws Bud out. As Bud is leaving, Shirley is getting undressed to consummate the marriage somehow, to a drunk John Allen. Bud says to the comatose John, \\"You said you'd bring me back a lollipop. You did alright and a red one at that\\". He flicks a lit cigarette at Shirley's naked back. Three weeks later, Bud and John are doing their job riveting, 28 stories up. During a break, they argue about Shirley. Bud berates John for being taken in by a liar: \\"She told you that her parents were living on a farm in I-dee-ho, and all the time they're living in a booze joint on Tenth Avenue\\". John admits that Shirley has had much of his money for clothes \\"which she needed\\". Bud: \\"where do you think she goes in the daytime?\\". John: \\"she goes to the movies!\\". Bud: \\"what about all the money she gets? There aint enough dimes in the day, even if she were on a merry-go-round!\\". John: \\"Don't talk that way about my wife!\\". John angrily lunges at Bud with a spanner and Bud falls to his death, shown spinning, screaming as John Allen flat on his stomach looks over, watching him fall, yelling \\"Bud! Bud!\\". John Allen is a hunched, nervous depressed wreck, with Shirley nagging him. Shirley: \\"How long you gonna keep on being like this? Makes me sick to look at ya. Why don't you go out and get yourself a job?\\". John Allen: \\"I can't get one. I tried\\". Shirley: \\"you can go back to riveting\\". John: \\"I can't go back to that\\" \\"not ever since Bud .. I can't climb .. when I get up there, my head swims, I get sick, afraid, I gotta hold on. One minute he was standing there talking to me and the next he was flying through space, his fingers clawing, trying to catch hold of something and nothing for him to grab. And then when he hit\\". Shirley mocks his nervous condition, sneering, mimicking him: \\"I can't do it, I can't climb, I'm afraid\\". She asks him if he's got any insurance. A kindly doctor (Harry Beresford) is called and gives him a tonic. John Allen says that it's his nerves. The doctor says that John Allen's problem is psychological. Shirley is putting a new dress on, new stockings and going out. \\"Where did you get those things?\\" John Allen asks. \\"Tony\\", Shirley says belligerently. \\"There, how do I look\\", she says to John. \\"Like what you are.\\" John Allen says. John says that she can't go out looking that way, as his wife. Shirley indicates that she has credibility now, \\"with the other girls\\", as she's married, \\"there are things a Mrs. can get away with that a Miss can't\\". Lizzie, the cleaning lady (Dorothea Wolbert) tells Shirley that the landlady is after them for the rent. John Allen indicates that they must put this off, pay her later. Lizzie indicates that they'll get thrown out \\"her brothers a cop you know\\". Shirley pulls a clip of money out of her stocking. \\"Where did you get that from?\\" John asks. \\"Tony\\". Shirley tells him that the money is an \\"advance\\". She then tells John that she is trying to get Buds ex-girlfriend Annie, who she met at Buds funeral, a job at the dance hall. Allen: \\"Not Annie!. \\"Annie was Buds steady company\\" (girlfriend). You can't make a tramp out of Annie!\\". Shirley throws a dollar at John Allen as she leaves. \\"Here's a BUCK, in case you need anything\\". Allen has been betting on horses using techniques of multiple bets (\\"polys\\") used by Tony. The horseracing bookmaker (Guy Kibbee), arrives at John Allens apartment. John Allen: \\"What do you want?\\" Bookie \\"You've won\\". Allen \\"How much\\" Bookie: \\"$388\\". John Allen (brightening up momentarily) \\"$388?\\". Bookie: \\"niftiest little poly I ever saw\\". Bookie: \\"With that kind of money you can clear a lot of debt\\". John Allen \\"I'll clear them ALL off, that's what Bud would have wanted me to do\\". Bookie: \\"Don't talk like that\\". A deranged John Allen insists that he only wants $172 of the winnings. Allen rummages in a cupboard to find his teacup, the one he had on his finger when he married Shirley Day. \\"This teacup was once filled with bootleg liquor, then it was filled with the blood of my only friend\\". He throws the teacup on the ground, smashing it and exclaims \\"I'm going to be FREE!\\". John nervously counts out what Shirley got from Tony and enough for a gun. Allen then strides off purposively to Tony's dance hall, where he finds Shirley in Tony's arms\\". Tony: \\"What is this?, are you trying to play the spurned husband gag on me?\\". John thrusts $162 into the hands of Tony, who doesn't want it, then turns to Shirley: \\"You. You made a Rat out of me. Bud was right, you were born rotten and now you're trying to make other girls as rotten as you are\\". \\"Born crooked\\" was how Bud had described Shirley, when arguing with Allen, just before falling to his death. Shirley turns to Tony in panic: \\"Tony he's going to kill me!\\". Johns sweaty deranged face is shown in closeup: \\"Yeah, i'm going to kill you. If I don't you're going to go on like this, from Tony to another man, always making yourself cheaper and dirtier\\". He fires several bullets into Shirley Day as Tony runs out of the room howling. At his trial, Allen states he should have been \\"burned\\" (electrocuted) when he was at his lowest, a \\"rat\\", living off Shirley Day, not when he had paid off his debts. He makes a pitiful, deranged speech, pleading \\"It isn't fair! It isn't fair to let a rat live and kill a man! It isn't reasonable! It don't make sense! I won't let you do it!\\". The judge informs John Allen that he could have used a defence of insanity, but chose not to. The sentence is death. Cast * Edward G.

LeRoy made five films in 1932. The sound clarity is because of Vitaphone sound on disk technology. Reception Although he called it \\"a sordid and melancholy study\\" that was \\"glum and gruesome\\" and \\"minus any comedy relief\\", New York Times critic Mordaunt Hall also found a lot to like in Two Seconds. \\"Edward G. Robinson contributes a remarkably forceful portrayal,\\" he wrote, adding that the film was \\"adroitly done [and] compels attention.\\" He called LeRoy's direction \\"imaginative and lifelike\\" and praised the supporting cast: \\"Preston Foster plays Bud Clark, a r√¥le he also interpreted on the stage. His acting is capital. Vivienne Osborne is very real as the conscienceless Shirley. J. Carroll Naish makes the most of the part of Tony.\\" In summary, he writes: \\"In spite of its drab tale, it calls forth admiration, for it never falters.\\"Hall, Mordaunt (1932). \\"Edward G. Robinson in a Flash-Back Pictorial Melodrama Telling of the Last Thoughts of a Murderer\\". The New York Times, May 19, 1932; accessed October 11, 2011. Variety's 1932 review was less enamored: \\"General slowness and stodgy overdramatics won't draw the flaps, nor will a tragic finale help.\\"Variety 1932 review excerpted in Halliwell, Leslie and John Walker, ed. (1994). Halliwell's Film Guide 9th Edition. New York: HarperPerennial. . p. 1246 In later years, prolific critic Leslie Halliwell tersely called Two Seconds a \\"competent, pacy crime melodrama\\".Halliwell, p. 1246 The film has been called an early (or first) example of film noir. Cultural references When a girl says to Preston Foster \\"who's the smiling lieutenant over there\\", in reference to a sourfaced John Allen (Robinson), she's making a reference to the 1931 Ernst Lubitsch film The Smiling Lieutenant \\"She ain't no Peggy Joyce\\" Bud Clarke to John Allen (referring to a date he's setting John Allen with ('works in a laundrette')) Later: \\"There I was trying to get you Peggy Joyce and you go and get yourself hog tied to a dance hall dame\\" (Bud Clarke). Peggy Hopkins Joyce (May 26, 1893 ‚Äì June 12, 1957) was an American actress, artist model and dancer. In addition to her performing career, Joyce was known for her numerous engagements, six marriages to wealthy men, subsequent divorces, scandalous affairs, her collection of diamonds and furs and her generally lavish lifestyle. \\"Kewpie\\" doll. Early in the film John Allen is saying that he wants a girl with education. Bud: \\"You got me worried, next thing I know you'll be going sour on me n trippin' with one of them kewpies and a study book\\". Mass produced \\"Kewpie\\" dolls, the representation of a comic strip character, were prolific in the US at the time. Bud is jokingly insinuating that John Allen will become childish: \\"I aint bunking with no lily\\". There's a reference to Cagney (The Public Enemy, 1931) and grapefruit - Bud (Preston Foster) to girl in the street \\"why don't you let me sit across from ya, and squirt grapefruit juice in your eye, like they do in the movies\\". That refers to the notorious scene in The Public Enemy, in which James Cagney viciously mashes a grapefruit into the face of Mae Clarke at breakfast. \\"The old army game\\". Bud (Preston Foster), when Shirley Day brings John Allen back drunk, after having dragged him off to get married (she slipped the priest $10 because he was too drunk to stand) - Bud Foster to Shirley Day: \\"I'm not going to let you pull the old army game on him\\" Shirley: \\"I'm not trying to pull the army game on him. He's married to me, right square and legal. (she shows Bud the ring) and there's nothing you, he or anyone can do about it!\\". The \\"army game\\" is the simplest con-trick, the \\"shell game\\", which, if you didn't know what it was, you would be easily taken in by. WC Fields refers to it when observing a shell (cup and ball) game going on, in the 1926 Silent It's the Old Army Game. \\"That's the old army game\\" he says sagely, exposing the fraudster. The game would have been common in the army (WW1). The Manhattan Municipal Building, which still exists. In the scenes of Bud and John riveting girders and their argument, it's the building shown prominently, centrally in the cityscape. The city marriage bureau was in that building. Bud makes a reference to it when arguing with Shirley Day. Johns demise results from his marriage to Shirley Day, who gets him drunk and drags him there. Johns argument with Bud about it, results in Bud falling his death. A speakeasy, also called a blind pig or blind tiger, in the film as a \\"speak\\", is an establishment that illegally sells alcoholic beverages. Such establishments came into prominence in the United States during the Prohibition era of 1920 to 1933. During that time, the sale, manufacture, and transportation (bootlegging) of alcoholic beverages was illegal throughout the United States. When John Allen understands the true nature of Shirley Day, he says \\"I should throw you out\\". Shirley Day responds mockingly \\"Then the goose would stop laying the golden egg\\", as she was the only one bringing money into the house. That is a reference to one of Aesops fables The goose that laid the golden eggs, an idiom used of an unprofitable action motivated by greed. Latonia Race Track, Kentucky. When the bookmaker (Guy Kibbee) meets Bud and John outside Tonys dance hall, to pay out Tonys winnings of $38, bookie tries to get Tony to bet again: \\"How about something on the nose at Latonia tomorrow\\". Latonia, once regarded as among the United States' top sites for racing was closed in 1939, during the great depression. Reference to Astor Hotel. Bud in talking to the two girls \\"Got anything special on tonight?\\" \\"Yeah, we were just about to get a bite to eat at the Astor\\" (sarcastically) Bud: \\"Don't try to pull no astor stunts on me (that sarcasm) I don't come from the Bronx (poor area). Coupla drinks, the speak (speakeasy), a dance & maybe a movie.\\" Bud is telling them he has money to spend. Hotel Astor was a prestige hotel located in the Times Square area of Manhattan, in operation from 1904 through 1967. Featured a long list of elaborately themed ballrooms and exotic restaurants: the Old New York lobby, the American Indian Grill Room with artifacts collected with the help of the American Museum of Natural History, a Flemish smoking room, a Pompeiian billiard room, the Hunt Room decorated in sixteenth century German Renaissance style, and many other features. \\"Owl dining car\\". Bud, when chatting up two girls in the street: \\"Got anything special on tonight?\\" Girl: \\"Yeah, we were just about to get a bite to eat at the Astor.\\" Bud: \\"You got the Astor mixed up with the owl dining car aintcha?\\" Girl: \\"The owl aint so bad at that\\". What were termed \\"owl wagons\\" from 1888, became furnished, fixed, \\"night owl\\" branded diners; converted streetcars which proliferated in New York City when drinking alcohol was prohibited by the Volstead Act from 1920-1933. The modern 'streetcar' styling of a diner is its first form. When Shirley Day asks John Allen what he does for a living John Allen replies \\"Oh, I'm a riveter.\\" \\"That's where you get those big muscles. How much do you earn?\\", she asks. \\"$62.54\\" (weekly) John responds. \\"You and Rockefeller!\\", Shirley enthuses. That is a reference to John D Rockefeller (1839-1937), who was the richest man in America at the time.

Specifically, it is the volatile product from the hydrolysis of polydimethylsiloxane, which are generally terminated with trimethylsilyl groups: :(CH3)3SiO[Si(CH3)2O]nR + H2O ‚Üí (CH3)3SiOH + HO[Si(CH3)2O]nR TMS and related volatile siloxanes are formed by hydrolysis of silicones-based containing materials, which are found in detergents and cosmetic products. Traces of trimethylsilanol, together with other volatile siloxanes, are present in biogas and landfill gas, again resulting from the degradation of silicones. As their combustion forms particles of silicates and microcrystalline quartz, which cause abrasion of combustion engine parts, they pose problems for the use of such gases in combustion engines.http://epics.ecn.purdue.edu/bgi/Documents/Fall%25202009/Removal_of_Siloxanes_.pdf =Production= Trimethylsilanol cannot be produced by simple hydrolysis of chlorotrimethylsilane, as this reaction leads to the etherification product hexamethyldisiloxane, because of the by-product hydrochloric acid.Didier Astruc: Organometallic Chemistry and Catalysis.

All these lines are operated by Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya, who also run the station. The station has twin tracks, with two side platforms and a central island platform. The side platforms are used for boarding, whilst the central platform is used for alighting, a configuration that is known as the Barcelona solution. In the case of La Bonanova, the centre platform is long enough to accommodate a four car train, but the side platforms are shorter, meaning that it is only possible to board three of the train's cars from them. The station platforms are accessed by a single ticket hall at the western end of the station, which has street accesses to both sides the Via Augusta. A second hall at the east end of the station exists, but is now used only as an emergency exit. The line on which La Bonanova is located opened in 1863, but the first station on the site did not open until 1887.

Samuel Johnson included him in his Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets. Biography The son of Richard West, he was educated at Winchester, Eton and Christ Church, Oxford; his father intended a career in the Church for him. However, he was persuaded by his uncle, Lord Cobham to take a commission in the army but soon left to work under Lord Townshend, a prominent Whig. West left this position when it became clear that he had no prospect of advancement in such a career. West married a Miss Bartlett with whom he lived in Wickham in Kent and was appointed Treasurer of Chelsea Hospital which provided him a modest income. During this period, following dialogue with his cousin George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton he published the essay Observations on the history and evidence of the resurrection of Jesus Christ (1747) for which Oxford University awarded him an LLD. In 1749 West published his translations of the odes of Pindar; his translation of Pindar remained the standard version throughout the following century. Only late in his life did West achieve a measure of financial success when he was appointed to a clerkship of the Privy Council in 1752. He died four years later.

It is served by lines L6 and L12 of the Barcelona Metro, and by lines S1, S2, S5 and S55 of the Metro del Vall√®s commuter rail system. All these lines are operated by Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya, who also run the station. Sarri√† station is the junction point between Barcelona Metro line L6 to Reina Elisenda, and the Metro del Vall√®s lines to Sant Cugat, Terrassa and Sabadell. During off-peak periods it is served by lines L6, S1 and S2, all of which run through to Pla√ßa de Catalunya station. In peak periods additional through service is provide by lines S5 and S55, but in order to provide capacity for this in the tunnel to Pla√ßa de Catalunya, many peak L6 service simply shuttle between Reina Elisenda and Sarri√†. The station has four tracks, with three island platform between them, and three accesses. The western pair of tracks are used by L6 trains to and from Reina Elisenda, whilst the eastern pair are used by trains on lines S1, S2, S5 and S55. The two pairs of tracks join in a flat junction just to the south of the station. The first Sarri√† station opened in 1863 and was situated at ground level. The current station was opened in 1974.

Marianna Martines, also Marianne von Martinez\\"Martinez\\" is often employed in older reference sources; however, there is no primary source in Vienna in which the name of the family is actually spelled thus. The composer always signed herself \\"Marianna von Martines\\". See: Verlassenschaftsabhandlung Maria Theresia Martines, A-Whh, OMaA, Gruppe II, 54/1775. See also the Wiener Diarium of 4 August 1773 (4 May 1744 - 13 December 1812), was a singer, pianist and composer of the classical period, based in Vienna.  Background  Marianna Martines's paternal grandfather was a Spanish soldier who had settled in Naples. Her father, Nicolo Martines, grew up there and for a time pursued a career as a soldier. He later changed careers, serving in Vienna as Maestro di Camera (major-domo) at the papal nuncio; that is, the Pope's embassy to the Austrian Empire. For service to the Empire, Marianna's brothers in 1774 acquired a patent of nobility, hence the \\"von\\" in the family surname.Godt 1995, 539 In his youth in Italy, Nicolo had befriended the poet Pietro Trapassi, who wrote under the name Metastasio. The latter had risen in eminence, to the point that in 1730 he was called to Vienna to serve as the Poet Laureate of the Empire. Metastasio resided with the Martines family for the entire rest of his life (from about 1734 to 1782). His presence would prove crucial to Marianne's career. The Martines family lived in rooms in a large building on the in Vienna, \\"a stately building still standing in the Kohlmarkt\\".Godt 1995, 540 As was common in the days before elevators, the floors of the building corresponded to the social class of the inhabitants. On the lowest floor were the rooms of the dowager princess of the wealthy Esterh√°zy family. The Martines family were on the third floor. Another resident of the middle floors was Nicola Porpora, a well-known Italian singing teacher and composer. At the very top, in a cold and leaky attic room, lived a struggling young composer, Joseph Haydn, who was trying to make his way as a freelance musician. The lives of all of these people ultimately came to be connected, in part through Marianna Martines.The only connection not related is that Haydn ultimately became the Kapellmeister for the Esterh√°zy family, including the dowager's sons Paul Anton and Nicolaus. She was born into this home in 1744. Though baptized Anna Catherina,Godt, 540 she chose to go by the name Marianna. Metastasio, the family friend, made it a practice to help out with the raising and careers of the Martines children; for instance, at one point he helped Giuseppe obtain an important job as custodian of the Imperial Library. In the case of Marianna, he noticed her precocious talents early, and thus came to oversee her education, musical and otherwise. He first arranged for her to take keyboard lessons from Haydn, whom Metastasio had met as a result of their living in the same building. Then, at age ten, Marianna began singing lessons with Porpora, who had also met Haydn and taken him on as his assistant; Haydn played the harpsichord while Porpora taught Marianne. Soon after Marianna began her music lessons she demonstrated a talent for composition, so she began still further lessons with Johann Adolph Hasse and the Imperial court composer Giuseppe Bonno. Metastasio also saw to it that Marianna received a thorough general education, which far surpassed what was considered standard for women of her social class at that time. She was a native speaker of both Italian and German, and in an autobiographical letter to Padre Martini indicated that she had good command of French. The musicologist Charles Burney, visiting Vienna, found that she also could speak English.Godt, 541 Career as performer and composer Already as a child Martines was good enough to perform before the Imperial court, where according to the Helene Wessely, she \\"attracted attention with her beautiful voice and her keyboard playing.\\"Wessely, New Grove, \\"Marianne von Martinez\\", online edition cited below The adult Marianna was frequently asked to perform before the Empress Maria Theresa.Godt 1995, 538 A number of the works that Martines composed are set for solo voice, and her biographers (Godt, Wessely) conjecture that the first singer of these works was their composer. If so, they constitute further evidence for her ability, as the music shows a \\"predilection for coloratura passages, leaps over wide intervals and trills indicat[ing] that she herself must have been an excellent singer.\\" (Wessely). Martines wrote a number of secular cantatas and two oratorios to Italian texts. These texts are, naturally enough, the work of her mentor Metastasio. Surviving compositions include four masses, six motets, and three litanies for choir. She wrote in the Italian style, as was typical for the early Classical period in Vienna. Her harpsichord performance practice was compared to the style of C.P.E. Bach. Martines's compositions were well regarded in her time, and some scholars have suggested that Mozart modeled his 1768 Mass, K. 139, after the \\"Christe\\" of Martines's Mass No. 1 in D major. The Michaelerkirche (St. Michael's Church, next door to the Martines home), saw a performance of her third mass in 1761. Her fourth mass was completed in 1765. Later life Martines's name and music were known throughout Europe, and she was admitted to the Accademia Filarmonica of Bologna in 1773. Her Italian oratorio Isacco figura del redentore was premiered by massive forces in concerts (17 and 19 March 1782) of the Tonk√ºnstler-Societ√§t, a long-standing series that also performed large- scale works by Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and Handel. The vocal soloists included Caterina Cavalieri, and Ludwig Fischer.Pohl (1856:60) Martines and her sister, neither of whom ever married, looked after their family friend Metastasio until his death in 1782. Upon his passing, Metastasio left his estate to the Martines family; Marianna received 20,000 florins, Metastasio's harpsichord, and his music library. Marianna and her sister hosted musical soirees at their home. These weekly musical events attracted many distinguished guests, including Haydn and Irish tenor Michael Kelly. Mozart also was a frequent guest to the soirees and composed four-hand piano sonatas to perform with Marianne. Though she was an active and highly accomplished performer and composer she never sought an appointed position; it would have been unacceptable for a woman in her social class to seek such employment. Her last known public appearance was on 23 March 1808, attending a performance of Haydn's oratorio Die Sch√∂pfung conducted by Salieri, in tribute to the composer. She died on 13 December 1812 and was buried in St. Mark's Cemetery. List of works 2 oratorios; 4 masses; 6 motets; psalm cantatas; secular cantatas; 3 keyboard sonatas, 1 keyboard concerto; and 1 symphony. Several of her pieces have been published in recent years. The three keyboard sonatas (in E Major, G Major and A Major) are available through Hildegard Publishing. Many works are also available through Furore-Verlag, a German publisher that specializes in works by women composers. They offer many first publications, including: the Keyboard Concerto in A; Dixit Dominus for Soli, Choir and Orchestra; In Exitu Israel de Agypto, Psalm for Soli, Choir and Orchestra; Laudate Pueri Dominum, Psalm 112, for SATB choir and orchestra; the Fourth Mass.

He served as Chief Justice of Bengal from 1833‚Äì43. Early life Ryan was the second son of William Ryan. He graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1814 and while at Cambridge, he became friends with John Herschel, Charles Babbage, and George Peacock. Ryan took his MA in 1817 and was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn in the same year. It was Herchel's sharing of his scientific interests and enthusiasms that encouraged Ryan to join the Royal Astronomical Society in 1820.Prior (2006) He practised on the Oxford Circuit and published a volume of law reports jointly with William Oldnall Russell titled Crown cases reserved for consideration; and decided by the Twelve judges of England, from the year 1799 to the year 1824 before being appointed a puisne judge in the Calcutta supreme court in Bengal, then an English colony (see: Company Rule in India, 1757‚Äì1857: Justice system), an appointment which carried the customary knighthood. However, he would complete another book, this time with William Moody, titled Reports of cases determined at Nisi Prius, in the Courts of King's Bench and Common Pleas: and on the Oxford and Western circuits from the sittings after Michaelmas term, 4 Geo. IV. 1823 to the sittings after Trinity term, 7 Geo. IV. 1826, inclusive before he left for India. India Ryan arrived in India in 1827 and soon established something of a salon. Victor Jacquemont was a visitor in 1829. Ryan was a keen patron of science, presiding over agricultural and horticultural societies, and a supporter of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. Secretary to the Board of Control Thomas Babington Macaulay had drafted a criminal code for India and Ryan's support won him Macaulay's affection. Governor-General Lord William Bentinck was also well-disposed and when William Oldnall Russell, his old law-report collaborator, died in 1833, Ryan was appointed Chief Justice of Bengal in his stead. He took sides with Macaulay and Charles Trevelyan in their campaign that education in India should be improved by the widespread teaching of English to give the population access to the educational and instructional materials of the English-speaking world. From 1835, the three served together on the general committee of public education until Macaulay and Trevelyan left for England in 1838 when Ryan took over as president of the committee. England Ryan resigned as Chief Justice and returned to England in January 1843 with the intention of acting as assessor to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on appeals from the Indian courts. Consequently, he was sworn a Privy Councillor. He went on to hold offices including: *Permanent member of the Judicial Committee (1850‚Äì1865); *Member of a Royal Commission on English criminal law (1845); *Railway Commissioner (1846‚Äì?); *Assistant Controller of the Exchequer (1851‚Äì1862). In 1850, Trevelyan campaigned along with Charles Hay Cameron for the opening of the Indian Civil Service to the native population and championed the appointment of Soorjo Coomar Goodeve Chuckerbutty to the Bengal medical service. Civil Service Commission The Northcote‚ÄìTrevelyan Report in 1854 had characterised the British Civil Service as riddled with cronyism and hampered by the inefficiencies of patronage. The report had recommended access to the higher ranks of the service by open competition and public examination. Ryan became the inaugural First Civil Service Commissioner in 1855 with the task of implementing the reforms, and immediately faced the establishment backlash. However, Ryan was both intelligent and tactful and managed to supervise the trialling, evaluation and gradual introduction of universal tests by 1870. The commission also supervised exams for admission to the Indian Civil Service and the British Army. Family On 13 December 1814, Ryan married Louisa Whitmore (1789‚Äì1866) the daughter of William Whitmore and Frances Barbara Lyster. His friend Charles Babbage married her sister, Georgiana (1792‚Äì1827), in the same year. The Ryans had eight sons and three daughters: *Edmund Burke Ryan (1815‚Äì1850) *Frances Hanway Ryan (1817‚Äì) *Lousia Ryan (1818‚Äì1906) *John Cavendish Ryan (1819‚Äì1822) *Wolryche Whitmore Ryan (1821‚Äì1867) *Mary Ann Ryan (1822‚Äì) *Colonel Edward Moody Ryan (1824‚Äì), of the Bengal army *Robert Henry Ryan (1825‚Äì) *Fredrick York Ryan (1827‚Äì1829) *Sir Charles Lister Ryan (1831‚Äì1920), comptroller and auditor-general *Colonel William Cavendish Bentinck Ryan (1833‚Äì1894) also of the Bengal army, named for the Governor- General of India Ryan died on 22 August 1875 at Dover. and is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery, London.

It was directed by Harry Essex, produced by Victor Saville's company, Parklane Pictures and released through United Artists. The film is notable for being the first one based on a Mike Hammer novel. Biff Elliot stars as Hammer. It was filmed in 3-D Page 79: \\"The film was shot in the short-lived 3-D (three-dimensional) process.\\" and was available with stereophonic sound. The story begins with Mike Hammer on the vengeance trail when Jack, a friend, is murdered. Hammer sets out to find the killer, working his way through an increasingly large pile of suspects (and corpses). Plot Shortly before Christmas in New York City, one-armed insurance investigator Jack Williams (Robert Swanger) is looking at a college yearbook photo of John Hansen when someone slips into his apartment and shoots him to death. Hot-headed private investigator Mike Hammer (Biff Elliot), Jack's war buddy, vows to avenge his friend's death despite a warning from Pat Chambers (Preston Foster), captain of the homicide squad, to let the police handle the case. Pat is unable to calm Mike, who roughs up a wisecracking reporter before leaving the crime scene. Knowing that Mike will forge ahead with an investigation regardless of his advice, Pat urges the offended reporter to publish an article disclosing that Mike is on the job. Mike goes to see Jack's fianc√©e, Myrna Devlin, a torch singer and reformed drug addict, but she is too distraught to talk with him. The next day, Mike's secretary Velda tells him about the article, titled \\"I, the Jury\\", which suggests that Mike knows the identity of the killer, thereby making him a target. Because Pat has given him a guest list from Jack's recent party, Mike surmises that the police captain is using him to draw out the killer. Mike begins his investigation, first visiting wealthy fight promoter and art collector George Kalecki (Alan Reed) in upstate New York. Kalecki introduces his live-in friend, John Hansen, as college student Hal Kines (Bob Cunningham), and claims they were home together after the party. As Mike is leaving, he looks through a window and sees the men arguing. Mike next visits alluring psychoanalyst and author Charlotte Manning (Peggie Castle), who was treating both Jack and Myrna. Charlotte flirts with Mike but provides no new information. Afterward, Mike finds Pat waiting for him. He is told that Kines moved out of Kalecki's house and that Kines believes Mike attempted to shoot him. Kines's new address is the same building where two other party guests, twin sisters Esther and Mary Bellamy, reside. Mike searches Kines's apartment and finds photos of him and Kalecki in Europe before and after World War II. When Kines returns unexpectedly and grabs Mike's arm, the detective beats him up. He goes upstairs to see Mary, who knew Jack when he worked as a guard at her father's estate. As Mike resists Mary's attempts to seduce him, he questions her about the party and learns that Charlotte drove her, Myrna and Esther home that night after Jack and Myrna had an argument. Later at his office, ex-boxer Killer Thompson reveals to Mike and Velda (Margaret Sheridan) that Kalecki, his former manager, runs a numbers racket. Mike seeks more information about the racket but his questions earn him only a severe beating by some thugs. Charlotte tends to his wounds and restores his spirits with a kiss, then asks if Jack might have left a message for Mike before he died. Mike slips into Jack's apartment through a window to avoid the policeman on guard, and finds a note from Pat, who anticipated his arrival. Mike also finds Jack's diary, which includes notations about a woman named Eileen Vickers (Mary Anderson), who changed her name to Mary Wright, as well as a note that Jack had been planning to raid a dance school with the police in a few days. Mike locates Eileen's father, veterinarian R.H. Vickers, who reveals that he had asked Jack to help his daughter after she ran away from college with John Hansen. Mike finds Eileen at a dance school that is a front for prostitution. Although she is shocked to hear about Jack's death, she only knows that he wanted her to get help from Charlotte. Despite all the information he has gathered, Mike has more questions than answers. He and Pat continue their research by looking through college yearbooks and find the photo of Hal Kines, who is identified as John Hansen. After police implement Jack's raid on the dance studio, they find Eileen's and Kines's dead bodies in Eileen's room. After Kalecki admits that he and Kines had argued over the young man's involvement with Esther, Mike is baffled as to why he was found with Eileen. Confusion continues to mount, and Charlotte and Mike are nearly killed when someone fires at them outside his office. Mike is awakened that night by Bobo (an uncredited Elisha Cook Jr.), a slow-witted former boxer now working as a department store Santa Claus, who warns Mike that \\"the big man\\" is after him. After learning that Kines has been posing as a college student for twenty years, Velda suspects that he may have been running Kalecki's numbers racket at school, using his identity as a student as a cover. Mike goes to search Kines's room at the fraternity house and discovers Kalecki inside burning Kines's papers. Kalecki shoots at Mike and is killed when Mike fires back. Mike grabs Kalecki's gun just as the police arrive to arrest him. Angered that Mike is taking the law into his own hands, Pat waits until the next day to release him from jail. Mike then gives him Kalecki's gun and they later search Kalecki's safe-deposit box, which is filled with stolen vintage European jewelry. The detectives now realize that Jack must have been investigating Kalecki and Kines, who had been fencing stolen jewelry from Europe for years. A police analyst determines that although all four murders were committed by the same weapon, it was not Kalecki's gun. Knowing that Myrna was once a jewel thief, Pat now suspects that she may have been influenced by Kalecki to murder her fianc√©. As before, Mike confides in Charlotte, with whom he has fallen in love, and tells her he believes that Kines worked the college campuses to recruit new thieves for Kalecki. When Pat learns that Myrna is drunk in a bar, he sends Mike and Charlotte to retrieve her, and they take the drunken woman to Charlotte's apartment to sober up. After Mike leaves, however, Charlotte injects Myrna with sodium pentothal and questions her about Jack, but Myrna is too disoriented to respond. Meanwhile, Mike is beaten up by Kalecki's thugs at his office, but he turns the tables on them and they are eventually arrested; however, they reveal no new information when questioned. When Myrna is found dead in the street from a hit and run accident, the medical examiner finds the needle mark on her arm, prompting Pat to assume that she had returned to drug use. Mike then realizes that Charlotte murdered Myrna, and surmises that Charlotte found out about the jewelry racket during a hypnosis section with Kines and that she plans to take over Kalecki's business.

Film critic Dennis Schwartz gave the film a mixed review but lauded the work of John Alton, writing, \\"The film was lucky to have the great cinematographer John Alton cast his magic noir shots to give it at least a moody look, but because of a limited budget Alton couldn't shoot the city Christmas scene on location and had to instead just show some Christmas cards to capture the city's seasonal spirit. Alton couldn't save this dull film from the poor acting, the risible dialogue, and the lame script. Biff Elliott is the main culprit when it comes to the poor acting. He had no presence and made his macho character into an unconvincing brute, someone devoid of a personality. The actresses were all bosomy stereotypes, including Peggie Castle, Margaret Sheridan, Frances Osborne, Mary Anderson and those riotous twin sisters Tani and Dran Seitz.\\"Schwartz, Dennis.

Early life Secord was born in Brant, Canada West, on July 19, 1860. He was a great grandnephew of War of 1812 heroine Laura Secord. He was educated in Brant, and graduated with honours from Brantford Collegiate Institute. He came to Edmonton by way of Chicago and Winnipeg, arriving September 1, 1881. Edmonton teaching and business Upon arriving, he helped build the first public school in Edmonton, and then moved to Pakan, Alberta, to teach First Nations children for a year. He returned to Edmonton in 1883 and taught for four years, and then entered the employ of John Alexander McDougall as a clerk. He started his own fur-trading business in 1888, and sold it to the Hudson's Bay Company in 1890. He married schoolteacher Anna Ada York in 1891; the couple had four children. Thereafter, he partnered with McDougall. In 1897, the pair founded McDougall & Secord, which advertised itself as \\"general merchants, wholesale and retail; buyers and exporters of raw furs; dealers in land scrip and north west lands; outfitters for survey parties, traders, trappers, miners and others for the north, and suppliers for country stores.\\" The two ran the company until 1907, when they sold it and went into business as a financial house and mortgage corporation called McDougall & Secord, Limited, which still existed up until the 20th century and is now permanently closed. Richard Secord was a land speculator known for committing fraudulent M√©tis scrip dealings with the local M√©tis of Edmonton. In some cases, he even impersonated M√©tis individuals in order to illegally lay claim to their scrip. Both he and his business partner McDougall became vastly wealthy off of this process, which lead to a major dispossession of the M√©tis and their rights with little to no compensation. In one case, he and McDougall redeemed 48 land scrips for a total of 286, $000 covering an area of 11, 520 acres. Secord was involved in a court case regarding one M√©tis woman known as Marie Rose Mageau. McDougal & Secord purchased her scrip for a total of $480 when the land in question had actually been worth $5000 Secord found himself in legal trouble once again in 1921 when a M√©tis woman, Flora Taylor, claimed her identity has been impersonated by McDougal & Secord to claim her scrip. Before said case could be brought to trial, Ottawa amended the criminal code with specifics to the scrip system and instituted a statute of limitations regarding claims of fraud. Once this amendment took place, the charges were dropped against Secord. Political career Secord first sought political office during the 1898 municipal election, running for alderman on Edmonton Town Council. He was elected to a one-year term, and did not seek re- election at its conclusion. He next ran for the Legislative Assembly of the North-West Territories in the 1902 territorial election as a Conservative in the riding of Edmonton. He was elected, and served until 1905, when Alberta was created and Edmonton therefore ceased to be part of the North-West Territories. While in the legislature, he introduced the bill that incorporated Edmonton as a city. Secord ran in the 1904 federal election as a Conservative candidate in Edmonton, but was handily defeated by Liberal Frank Oliver. Investments and philanthropy Secord had a significant impact on Edmonton through his expenditures of money. He arranged temporary financing (with McDougall and others) for the construction of the city's Low Level Bridge. (The debt was quickly passed to town taxpayers.) He also provided financial support to the Thistle Rink and the Misericordia Hospital, and financially backed the Edmonton Journal (which was intended as a Conservative alternative to Oliver's Liberal Edmonton Bulletin). Death and legacy Secord died January 12, 1935. Edmonton's Secord neighbourhood and √âcole Richard Secord School are named in his honour.

Through the years, many more Departments, Colleges/Schools were opened with more degrees and title course offerings.SMU History History Saint Mary‚Äôs University traces its roots back to the initiative of Msgr. Constant Jurgens, CICM, then parish priest of Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya and one of the earliest CICM missionaries to arrive in the Philippines. Wanting to establish a Catholic school for the children in his parish, he purchased a lot and some materials for this purpose. However, Jurgens was recalled to Europe to become the Director of the Bishop Hammer Institution in the Netherlands. It was Achilles de Gryse, Jurgens' successor, who pursued his dream through. Thus, Saint Mary‚Äôs Elementary School was inaugurated in June 1928. In 1934, Saint Mary's High School was opened, with Fr. Godfrey Lambrecht as director and Sr. Margaretha Hermus as principal. The collegiate department, Saint Mary's College, opened in 1947 offering programs in Associate of Arts, Bachelor of Science in Education, Bachelor of Arts, and Junior Normal.

In general, vivadi are not to be played during an improvisation on a given raga. So, for instance, if a raga had the structure S R G m P D N S', S' N D P m G R S; in that case, r, g, M, d and n would all be vivadi. Although vivadi pitches are generally to be avoided during the playing of a given raga, they are occasionally added by skilled performers in order to introduce some color to an interpretation. In Carnatic music In Carnatic music, vivadi is used in vivadi swaram, vivadi dhosha, vivadi ragam, and by extension vivadi melakarta. Vivadi term means going against the grain of thought or approach. =Vivadi swaram= A swaram is said to be vivadi in relationship with another swaram. There are twelve notes or svarasthanas in Indian classical music. But there are 16 notes. Thus some notes occupy the same frequencies. =Vivadi ragam= A ragam is vivadi if it contains vivadi swarams, especially with the vadi swaram of the ragam (vadi swaram means important swaram for that ragam or scale). The ragam still is a valid scale and compositions are made using such ragams too.

The Times has all three although Macdonald is the most frequent. Lyons (1960) and Craig (1974) both have Macdonald but Walker (1978) has McDonald. Macdonald is used here as it seems to occur most often. (1841 ‚Äì 5 October 1911) was an Irish nationalist politician and MP. in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and as member of the Irish Parliamentary Party represented Queen's County Ossory, 1886‚Äì92, and a supporter of Charles Stewart Parnell. He was one of the small number of blind people who have ever been members of the UK House of Commons. Macdonald was born at Enniskerry, Co. Wicklow, in 1841. He was educated in Dublin and although he lost his sight entirely at the age of 13The Times, 8/7/1886 and 5/7/1892; The Times (23/6/1886) says he was blind from birth but as this was an incidental news report while the other two references were specially compiled biographies, it is less likely to be correct. However, as he grew older, one day he was walking down the road and a flower pot hit him in the head. This caused fertilizer to enter his eyes and cause himself to go blind. Then, he distinguished himself at school. He entered Trinity College, Dublin with a sizarship and then in 1865 gained a scholarship. He graduated M.A. with high classical honours. He took holy orders in the disestablished Church of Ireland (i.e. in 1869 or later), but later renounced them. In 1875, he married Harriett Liveing, daughter of Edward Liveing of Nayland, Suffolk, and sister of Professor Liveing F.R.S. of Cambridge. In 1886 Macdonald was returned unopposed as the Nationalist Member of Parliament for the Ossory division of Queen‚Äôs County (now County Laois). At the same time he contested West Islington in London as a Gladstone Liberal, attempting to unseat Richard Chamberlain, who like his older brother Joseph Chamberlain had deserted the Liberal party rather than vote for the First Irish Home Rule Bill, and was standing as a Liberal Unionist. Macdonald was unsuccessful; Chamberlain‚Äôs majority rose slightly on a reduced poll. When the Irish Parliamentary Party split in December 1890 over Parnell‚Äôs leadership, Macdonald went with the minority who supported Parnell. Macdonald apparently intended to stand again at Ossory as a Parnellite at the general election of 1892, since The Times reported his candidacy. But he was not nominated, leaving the seat to be taken by an Anti-Parnellite, Eugene Crean, who easily beat the Unionist. At the 1895 general election Macdonald contested Ossory, but as an Independent Nationalist, not a Parnellite. He came a poor third behind the Unionist, with less than 10% of the votes. At this time he was living at Bray in his native county of Wicklow. Macdonald evidently remained politically active since he was reported as speaking at a public meeting at Maryborough (now Portlaoise), in the Ossory constituency, on the report of the Financial Relations Commission in January 1897. But he did not stand for Parliament again. He died at Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire, on 5 October 1911. Footnotes Sources *F. W. S.

It is thought that this book may have been composed by Hypsicles on the basis of a treatise (now lost) by Apollonius comparing the dodecahedron and icosahedron.

He is cross-appointed to the graduate science and technology studies program as well. His research has mostly been about the history of psychology, though he now also writes on methodological and statistical issues in psychology. Green is a Fellow of the American Psychological Association. He is a past president of APA Division 26, the Society for the History of Psychology. He was editor of the Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences, 2006-2008, and he has been selected to become editor of History of Psychology in 2022. His graduate training was in psychological aesthetics and computational cognitive science. Early life Green was born in Sacramento, California in 1959. His father, a native of San Francisco, was an undergraduate student of English and drama at the time. His mother was born in Ohio and raised near Detroit, Michigan, and she moved to California in the early 1950s. The year after his birth, Green's family moved Salt Lake City, Utah, where his father worked at an explosives plant for two years. The plant suffered a catastrophic explosion in 1962, and the family moved back to the San Francisco Bay Area, living in the suburbs in the south of the city. His father earned an MA at San Jose State University, then went to the doctoral program in drama at Stanford University in 1970. Green attended Lewis M. Terman Jr. High School (now Terman Middle School) for grades 7 through 9. He played trumpet in a variety of student bands and orchestras. In 1974, his father took a professorship at Bishop's University in Lennoxville, Qu√©bec. Green attended Alexander Galt Regional High School there for grades 10 and 11. He also learned several trades around the university's theater, doing set-building, lighting, and sound. In 1976, Green moved to the Montr√©al area to attend Vanier CEGEP where he earned a Dipl√¥me d'√©tudes coll√©giales (DEC) in music with a specialization in jazz. Starting in 1979, he enrolled in music at McGill University. By the end of the year, however, he had become disenchanted with the department and with his future prospects as a professional musician. He transferred to the department of psychology and discovered an interest in cognitive psychology, in which he took a course from Tony Marley. He also took a course in symbolic logic from Anil Gupta. Green was also a disk jockey at the student radio station. After one year in psychology, Green dropped out of university. He busked guitar in a subway station. During the summer of 1982, he moved back to his parents' home in Lennoxville and enrolled at Bishop's University to finish his psychology degree. His honours thesis supervisor was Anton DeMan. Another of his primary mentors was Stuart McKelvie. Green also worked in the theater, served as copy editor for the student newspaper (The Campus) and, in his second year, was elected president of the Bishop's Student Council. He completed his degree in 1984 and applied to several graduate programs in psychology, but was not accepted. He decided to remain at Bishop's for the 1984-85 school year, where he spent most of his time working as a lighting and sound assistant at the university theater. He was the sound operator for a concert played by the legendary blues musician, Brownie McGhee, who teamed up with a local man, Harmonica Zeke, for a one-night show. Green also wrote a political column for The Campus under the pseudonym \\"#9.\\" Graduate education After his additional year at Bishop's, Green applied to graduate school again, this time in both psychology and theater. He was accepted at Simon Fraser University in psychology and at the University of Victoria in theater. He chose the former. Beginning at Simon Fraser in 1985, Green's MA supervisor was Bernard Lyman, who admired the Gestalt psychologists and sought to revive E. B. Titchener's method of rigorous introspection. In addition to the required psychology courses, Green took several philosophy courses (aesthetics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of science) during his master's degree. His thesis research involved factor analyzing hundreds of subjects' detailed responses to nine different art works (3 paintings, 3 pieces of music, 3 poems). Nothing from the thesis was ever published, but the research process brought to Green's attention the Golden Section, a topic that would later serve as the basis of his most-cited journal article. Considering the possibility of specializing in statistics, Green took several math courses at the start of his PhD. He had begun writing his major doctoral essays (on philosophy of science and psychology) when his supervisor, Lyman, became ill with cancer, dying in December 1988. Green transferred to the University of Toronto, where his new doctoral supervisor, John M. Kennedy, a one-time student of J. J. Gibson, was just beginning pioneering work on whether blind people use the same graphical artistic conventions as sighted people when they draw. Green became interested in computational cognitive science and audited courses in connectionism taught by Geoffrey Hinton. One of his closest mentors at Toronto was the theoretical psychologist, Andr√© Kukla. His dissertation topic, conceived during a conference talk he saw by Paul Smolensky, was to develop connectionist networks that could correctly solve problems in deductive logic. He completed his PhD in 1992. Career Finding no full-time academic position immediately after graduation, Green remained at Toronto, where he was given the title of \\"Special Lecturer\\" and taught various courses, including one in a recently developed cognitive science program. In 1992 he published a paper on the history of operationism, which had grown out of his unfinished doctoral papers at Simon Fraser and was, for many years, among his most popular articles. He applied for dozens more academic positions the following year, mostly in cognition. He was hired by York University in Toronto in July 1993. He joined York's History & Theory of Psychology graduate program (now Historical, Theoretical, & Critical Studies in Psychology). He taught undergraduate courses mainly on cognition, perception, statistics, and the history of psychology. At the graduate level, he taught seminars on cognition, the history of psychology, and the work of Michel Foucault. Starting about 1997, his undergraduate teaching narrowed to only statistics. In 1995, he published a review of psychological research on the aesthetics of the Golden Section, which soon became his most-cited article. Among Green's most important mentors during his early years at York were Raymond Fancher, the senior figure in the History & Theory of Psychology program, and Andrew Winston, a historian of psychology at the University of Guelph. He became interested in the World Wide Web and created a series of webpages and e-mail lists for several scholarly organizations in which he was involved: Divisions 24 (theory) and 26 (history) of the American Psychological Association, Cheiron: The International Society for the History of Behavioral and Social Sciences, the International Society for Theoretical Psychology, and Section 25 (history & philosophy) of the Canadian Psychological Association, among others. He was tenured and promoted to Associate Professor in 1997. Late in 1997, he began work on the \\"Classics in the History of Psychology\\" website, which ultimately housed electronic editions of over 200 publications of historical importance in psychology. The site became tremendously popular, especially in the days before commercial publishers learned the value of posting their journals' back-catalogs to the Web. The Classics site garnered tens of millions of hits during its first few years. Green was made a Fellow of the American Psychological Association (through the History Division (26)) in 2000, primarily for his internet activities. He was also presented a Special Service Award by History Division (26) of the APA in 2002. In 2004, he was made a Fellow of the Teaching Division (2) of APA as well. He was promoted to Full Professor by York that same year. In 1998, Green had returned to the University of Toronto to start a second PhD, in the philosophy of science. His supervisor was a professor he had known during his previous stint there, William Seager, best known for his work on the theory of consciousness. Progress on the dissertation was slow, but he completed the degree in 2004. His dissertation returned to the topic of cognitive science, investigating whether connectionist networks served as \\"scientific models,\\" as that phrase is understood in philosophy. He showed that one popular class of connectionist networks, which are made up of units that are usually thought of as being idealized analogs of neurons (thus the nickname \\"neural nets\\"), seemed to perform worse rather than better as more realistic neurological assumptions were built into their operation. Having more or less satisfied his interests in computational cognitive science, in the first years of the 21st century Green began to retool as a historian of science. First, he wrote a couple of pieces on the mid-19th-century computational work of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace. In 2003, he finally published a book on ancient Greek and Roman psychological thought that he had co-authored with a graduate school friend, Philip Groff, mostly during the mid-1990s. After that, his main historical interests turned to North American psychology, especially around the turn of the 20th century. He worked on the rise and fall of Functionalism, creating two video documentaries on the topic in addition to several articles and book chapters. In October and November 2006, he wrote the bulk of English Wikipedia's history of psychology entry. In 2009, he co-edited with Ludy T. Benjamin, Jr. a book on the pre-history of sport psychology. From 2006 to 2008 he served as editor of the Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences. Late in 2007, he was elected President- Elect of the History of Division of the APA, serving as President mainly in 2009. About 2010, he began using the new digital methods that were starting to capture various regions of the humanities and applying them to the study of the history of psychology. In 2011, he formed a \\"laboratory\\" with his York colleague, Michael Pettit and a number of students. They named themselves the \\"PsyBorgs.\\" In 2012, Green and Pettit won a research grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) to support this work. Green and his colleagues published several articles in which complete runs of journal articles over decades of time were represented as nodes in a series of networks. These networks visually depicted the intellectual structure of the discipline at various periods in time ‚Äî e.g., which topics were popular, how various topics were related to each other in terms of the vocabularies they used, and how these disciplinary structures changed over time from the 1880s to the 1920s. He also co-authored with his students digital studies of history's most prolific and most influential psychologists. In August of 2018, the book that he had been working for nearly a decade was published, Psychology and Its Cities: A New History of Early American Psychology. His current research is focused on the historical use and misuse of statistical analysis in psychology. Green's most active (former) graduate students include Daniel Denis (currently at the University of Montana), Jennifer Bazar (currently at the Lakeshore Grounds Interpretive Centre of Humber College), Cathy Faye (currently Director of the Cummings Center for the History of Psychology at the University of Akron), Jeremy Burman (currently at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands), Jacy Young (currently at Quest University), and Arlie Belliveau (currently at York University).

Two-year-old season  Bet Twice was owned by a syndicate of approximately three dozen that included baseball players Pete Rose and Garry Maddox. His principal shareholder was Robert Levy, the owner of Atlantic City Race Course. As a two-year-old, Bet Twice won the grade one Laurel Futurity and Arlington-Washington Futurity Stakes and the grade two Sapling Stakes.  Three-year-old season  Early in his three-year-old season, Bet Twice won the grade two Fountain of Youth Stakes on the road to the Triple Crown. He met a crop of talented horses in that three-year-old year, including Gulch and Cryptoclearance; however, his rivalry with Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner Alysheba was most famous. He faced the other colt nine times, beating him three times (Alysheba won four times, while neither horse won in their other two meetings). Bet Twice and Alysheba battled down the stretch in what many consider one of the most physical Derbies ever. Alysheba prevailed by a half length over Bet Twice with both colts almost two and a half length in front of the rest of the field. In the Preakness Stakes, Bet Twice was listed at post time as the fourth choice at 5-1. He broke sharply and was third going into the first turn. He was up with the leaders when he was floated out wide. Approaching the stretch, the colt took the lead from Lookingforthebigone and Alysheba. In the closing moments of the race, Alysheba rallied, and Bet Twice lost by a half length again. In third and fourth were Cryptoclearance and Gulch respectively. Bet Twice may be best known for his victory in the 1987 Belmont Stakes. Ridden by Craig Perret and trained by Jimmy Croll, he won by 14 lengths and denied Alysheba the Triple Crown. By virtue of his victory in the Belmont and runner-up performances in the Preakness Stakes and the Kentucky Derby, he edged out Alysheba for the first ever $1,000,000 Chrysler Triple Crown Bonus as the top performing three-year-old in the Triple Crown series. Bet Twice then won the Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park over Alysheba. He also finished ahead of Alysheba in the Travers Stakes at Saratoga Race Course, though both horses finished in mid-pack behind Java Gold on the sloppy track.  Four-year-old season  When Bet Twice was four, his connections accepted an invitation to run him in the first revival of the $500,000 Grade I Pimlico Special Handicap at \\"Old Hilltop\\" in Baltimore, Maryland. He entered that race as the post-time fourth choice at odds of 7-1 in a field of seven graded stakes winners, including Crytoclearance. Going into the famous \\"club house turn\\" at Pimlico Race Course, Oaklawn Handicap winner Lost Code led the field, followed by local favorite Little Bold John and dual classic winner Alysheba. Then, on the far turn, Bet Twice weaved through traffic and moved between horses to challenge for the lead. Coming down the stretch, he drifted out and brushed Lost Code. Then he drew off and won by 3/4 lengths. The time for the Grade I race at 1 3/16 miles was 1:54 1/5. Later that year, Bet Twice had runner-up finishes in the Grade I Philip H. Iselin Handicap, the Grade III Ben Ali Stakes and the Grade III Salvator Mile. He also had show performances in the Grade I Suburban Handicap and the Grade I United Nations Handicap. Retirement Bet Twice stood at stud for six years at Muirfield Farm from 1990 through 1996. He was pensioned from stud duty at age 12. On March 5, 1999, he died at Muirfield East in Maryland at age 15.
