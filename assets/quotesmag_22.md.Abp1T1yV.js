It is pollinated by a single species of male thynnid wasp using sexual deception. The orchid's labellum is similar in shape and scent to a flightless female thynnid wasp. Although the species was formally described in 1842, the description was often later overlooked and other hammer orchids were given the name Drakea livida. It is now known to be, along with Drakaea glyptodon, one of the most widespread of the genus.  Description  Drakaea livida is similar to others in the genus in that it has a single, ground hugging leaf and an underground tuber. In this case, the leaf is heart shaped, about in diameter. The leaf is a somewhat glossy olive green with darker lines radiating from the attachment to the stem. The stem is long, sometimes longer and the stalk of the single flower is long. The flower is also similar to those of other hammer orchids in that the labellum resembles a flightless female thynnid wasp, in this case Zaspilothynnus nigripes. This species can be distinguished by the pointed column, the pointed, upturned end of the labellum and the swollen labellum body. The sepal at the back of the flower is long and the two at the sides are . The petals are also long. The insect-like labellum has a \\"head\\" about one- third long as the \\"body\\" and has a pair of dark projections near its base . The stalk of the labellum, joining it to the hinge, is spotted. The part of the labellum representing the female \\"body\\" of the insect greenish- yellow at the top end, spotted with maroon and the lower end is dark maroon in colour and swollen as in Drakaea glyptodon. The \\"head\\" part of the labellum is about one-quarter the length of the \\"body\\" and may be glabrous or covered with long hairs. Flowers appear from August to the middle of October.  Taxonomy and naming  Drakaea livida was first formally described by James Drummond in 1842. The description was published in Hooker's London Journal of Botany. The specific epithet is a Latin word meaning \\"bluish\\", or \\"black and blue\\", referring to the blotched coloration of the flowers of this species.  Distribution and habitat  Warty hammer orchid occurs in the Fitzgerald River National Park and towards Watheroo where it grows in sandy soils in woodland.  Conservation  Drakaea livida is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

The hall became Somerville College, Oxford in 1894. Early life Shaw Lefevre was born in 1835, the seventh child of the barrister and politician John Shaw Lefevre, and his wife, Rachael Emily Wright. As a member of the prominent Shaw Lefevre family of civil servants and politicians, Madeline benefited from a privileged upbringing, although surprisingly little is known about her early life.F.M.G. Willson, A Strong Supporting Cast: The Shaw Lefevres, 1789-1936 (The Athlone Press, 1993), p. 294 In 1866, she travelled to Fredericton, New Brunswick, to visit her sister Rachael, whose husband Arthur Hamilton-Gordon was Lieutenant-Governor, and from there Shaw Lefevre travelled with the Hamilton-Gordons to Trinidad, where she stayed for some months.Willson, Strong Supporting Cast, p. 202 Shaw Lefevre first became involved in public life during the 1870s, probably through the influence of Julia Reynolds-Moreton, Countess of Ducie, the mother-in-law of Shaw Lefevre's brother, George. The Countess was a founding member of the Workhouse Visiting Society, and through this connection Shaw Lefevre became a member of the central committee of the Metropolitan Association for Befriending Young Servants.Willson, Strong Supporting Cast, pp. 295-296 Somerville Hall Shaw Lefevre was appointed Principal of the new Somerville Hall in Oxford in May 1879. Shaw Lefevre was not an academic, had no formal educational experience (having been educated at home), and was not even on the original shortlist of candidates. However, she was known to the selection committee through her own social work and charity experience, as well as the work of her father, who had been Vice-Chancellor of the University of London between 1842 and 1862.Enid Huws Jones, ‘Lefevre, Madeleine Septimia Shaw-(1835–1914)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 Nevertheless, Shaw Lefevre was a reluctant appointee, and only accepted the position on condition that the post would last for just one year, and that she would only need to be present during term time. In the event, she remained head of the hall for 10 years. Her salary was £100 a year plus free board and lodging, a nominal amount which was considerably less than any of her male counterparts.Huws Jones, ODNB She started at Somerville Hall in 1879 with 12 students based in a house on Woodstock Road in Walton Manor, purchased from St John's College, Oxford, which became known as \\"House\\". She ran the Hall along the lines established by Anne Clough for Newnham Hall, later Newnham College, Cambridge. The hall was non-denominational and had no chapel (the Anglican Lady Margaret Hall opened in the same year). The Hall expanded to West Buildings in 1885, later renamed \\"Park\\".Huws Jones, ODNB Shaw Lefevre's chief task during her term as Principal was to establish Somerville on a sustainable long-term footing, and this she achieved. She used her personal and political connections to raise money for the College, working to secure the freehold on which its buildings stood, and took a full part in the administration of both the College and the University.Willson, Strong Supporting Cast, p. 305 Crucially, she gave opponents of women's education little opportunity to attack the College, collaborating closely with her counterpart at Lady Margaret, Elizabeth Wordsworth. Her work was rewarded in 1884, when women were finally permitted to take exams (although they could not graduate until 1920).Willson, Strong Supporting Cast, p. 305 The pressure of her work led Shaw Lefevre to submit her resignation in 1885, a decision which she only withdrew after securing a leave of absence for six months. She used this time to once again visit the Hamilton-Gordons, this time in CeylonWillson, Strong Supporting Cast, p. 302 One of the 35 students in her final year, 1889, was Cornelia Sorabji. Thirteen of the 82 students during her tenure achieved marks equivalent to a first-class degree. She was succeeded as Principal by Agnes Catherine Maitland.Huws Jones, ODNB In addition to her work at Somerville, Shaw Lefevre also became a trustee of Bedford College for Women in London from 1885.Huws Jones, ODNB Later life Shaw Lefevre retired in 1889, and lived in Farnham, Surrey, with her unmarried sisters. She remained on the Council of Somerville, and was active in its transactions. She also became involved in school committee work in Farnham.Willson, Strong Supporting Cast, p. 345 Shaw Lefevre died at Farnham and was buried in Ascot.Huws Jones, ODNB See Also Elizabeth Wordsworth, Shaw Lefevre's counterpart at Lady Margaret Hall.

Reception  Kaze Kiri received a mediocre score of 23/40 from Famitsu. Nick Cox writing in GameFan praised the game and recommended playing it. He compared the game as a combination of Ninja Warriors, Dracula X, and Strider. He praised the graphical effects in the levels, the size of the enemies, as well as the character animations. He explained the only flaw in the game was the music, which he felt was only adequate. In a retrospective review, Retro Gamer magazine highlighted it as one of the most memorable games about Japanese warriors, opining it \\"perhaps doesn't quite live up to the hype generated by its rare status and price tag - its gameplay will lack variety for some - but is and undeniably stylish game that deserves greater exposure.\\"Retro Gamer 129, pages 44-45.

He is best known for efforts to rectify civil rights abuses in the small southern school district where he was school superintendent. His efforts gained national recognition, spotlighting a problem in school districts, nationwide. He received the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award in 1996. Early life Corkin Cherubini's early life was spent in Portland, Oregon, and later in Worcester, MA. Most of junior high and high school was in southern New Jersey. He graduated from Vineland High School in 1962. Cherubini went to Troy University in the fall of 1962 and graduated with concentrations in English Literature, history, and aesthetics in the arts in 1967. He completed work for a master's degree in Audiovisual Education at the University of Virginia and his doctorate in Educational Leadership from Auburn University. In 1986, he received a National Endowment for the Humanities grant to study William Shakespeare's Hamlet at Harvard University. Career In 1992, Cherubini was elected school superintendent of the Calhoun County, Georgia, School District where he had taught for twenty-two years. As school superintendent, Cherubini was in a position to investigate the \\"racial tracking\\" of students from kindergarten through high school. He discovered that no reliable criteria were used for kindergarten placement, and that the composition of the two lower learning levels in kindergarten remained virtually unchanged throughout elementary and junior high school. This practice automatically insured that children in the lower tracks, primarily children of color, were destined for non-academic tracks in high school. Cherubini's initial plan was to balance the composition of classes, beginning in kindergarten. Each year, an additional grade level would feature a more balanced class composition. However, public outcry necessitated more stringent measures, and Cherubini turned to the Department of Education and the Office of Civil Rights for help. In late 1994, the Office of Civil Rights and Miami Equity Associates, a branch of the Southeastern Desegregation Center financed by the federal government, concluded that neither test scores, grades, nor teacher evaluation were used for student placement—a violation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. As a result, the four tier tracking model in Cherubini's system was abandoned. Funding from the United States Department of Education enabled the system to educate teachers so they might effectively teach a classroom of children with many levels of learning ability. Cherubini's fight reflected a national debate over tracking and the difficulties of changing that culture. Cherubini's determination to see that all students in his school system had equal educational opportunity spotlighted a pervasive problem, not just in the South, but throughout America. Cherubini's efforts spawned nationwide change. Awards In 1996, Cherubini received the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award. He was the seventh awardee and the first local politician to receive the award. He was commended for his courage and leadership in working for quality education for children. Asked if he would pursue the same course of action or a safer course, Cherubini replied, \\"There is not one action I would change. As the chief advocate for children in my county, I carefully made each decision for the well-being and betterment of these children, and I would have to take a similar course though the consequences be many times as formidable.\\" Cherubini retired in 1997. Since then, he has written and published two books, Gang Stalking: The Threat to Humanity (2014, ) and Suzanne: Targeted for Death (2015). He has also written, performed, and produced two political protest musical CD's, Indigo After Rain (2008) and in 2009, Back to Boheme.

It is thought to have been built in the eleventh century but documentation for this supposition is lacking.  History =The castle and Protestantism The Castle of Olbreuse is known for its affiliation with Protestantism, specifically Calvinism, in the sixteenth century. At the time the castle belonged to a branch of the Desmier family, the Desmier of Olbreuse. In the early eighteenth century the castle belonged to Éléonore Desmier d'Olbreuse, daughter of Alexandre Desmier of Olbreuse (1608–1660). It was then, in 1702, that Louis XIV put the castle into receivership to punish its owner for aiding Protestants. Since the conversion of the Desmier family to Calvinism, they had taken part in the religious wars against Catholics. In 1685, Alexandre, the brother of Éléonore, lived at Olbreuse with his wife, who was the great-granddaughter of the poet Agrippa d'Aubigné, of Protestant background. Thanks to the protection of the House of Brunswick to which Eleanor belonged through her marriage to the German Prince George William of Lüneburg-Celle (1624–1705), he took the initiative to temporarily hide Protestants. One of them, the teacher of Mauzé-sur-le-Mignon told the story in his diary of the period. He writes of Alexandre Desmier \\"this veritable nurturer was not only support and a retreat for me and for you, but for all the people who came to ask for help and retreat during the persecution.\\" In 1707, the receivership of Louis XIV was lifted and the castle was returned to Éléonore. On the death of the latter in 1722, the castle’s new owner was her daughter Sophia Dorothea of Celle, wife of King George I of Great Britain. She died four years later leaving the property to her children, George II of England and Queen Sophia of Prussia. The castle and the family Prevot of Gagemont In 1727 Sophie's husband, Frederick William I, made inquiries and learned that the castle reported an income of 2110 pounds a year. Both heirs decided to \\"outright gift\\" for 40,000 pounds the castle to their Olbreuse cousins of the Prévot de Gagemont family, who were Catholics. This transaction was authorized by Louis XV, 17 September 1729 in a decree: > \\"Our beloved trusty Alexandre Prevost, lord of Gagemont ... has exposed us > humbly having the honor of belonging as a cousin to our beloved deceased and > beloved cousin, Madame Eleanor, Duchess of Brunswick Lüneburg maternal > grandmother of our beloved king, brother King of Great Britain, and our very > dear sister the Queen of Prussia that as heirs of this princess, of the land > and lordship of Olbreuse, located in our kingdom, the land of Aunis today > belongs: it is by this consideration and put Olbreuse said land in the > family of the princess it has pleased our dear brother King of Great Britain > and our very dear sister of the queen Prussia to donate to exhibitor (...) > \\". It remained in that family until 1871; the last owner, Madame de Nossay, had no heirs. The return to Desmiers The castle, after an arrangement with Madame de Nossay, was sold to Baron Charles Desmier d’Olbreuse (1829–1915) to keep this monument from falling into the wrong hands. The baron was not a direct descendant of Éléonore Desmier d’Olbreuse, but came from a cousin branch, the Desmier Carliere, who immigrated during the Revolution and who on returning to France took the name of Desmier Olbreuse. The castle was again talked about in World War II, when it served as a hospital for blind war wounded. Inn In 1983, the castle of Olbreuse saw a revival with the creation of the LLC \\"Hostel Castle Olbreuse\\". Shareholders were the owners and their son Dominic, Mr. Jean Arrivée (chef) and Madame Arrivée (manager). The inn initially hosted seminars; four study rooms were available with a capacity of up to 100 people. The restaurant room had a capacity of 150 people for banquets and 200 for receptions and lunches. It also had eleven rooms steeped in the tradition and comfort of the old days. The menus proposed by chef Jean arrived were meant to close the soil. They were composed of up to products from the region (e.g. fish freshly arrived from La Rochelle). The specialities of the inn were goat cheese, turbot with a sabayon green pepper sauce, duck breast with goat cheese, sweetbread braised with Pineau des Charentes, frozen nougat angelica in Niort, hot apple puffs and cider sabayon. The inn of the castle closed its doors permanently when the property was sold in 1996. Secrets and myths surrounding the castle Olbreuse since its creation been the subject of much controversy. Some people from the local area retell stories that have passed from generation to generation that the castle was burned 27 times. The existence of a salt cellar inside the property is also debated. This theory is very likely true, since salt was widely used for food preservation. Other statements say that the southwest tower imprisons a murderess, a story denied by contemporary owners. Tunnels were built below the castle, known by everyone who lives nearby. These tunnels through the village of Olbreuse they were prolonged to the Mauzé Mignon (located 6.6km from Olbreuse). Other tunnels went underground to the church of Our Lady of Dey (located south of the town of Prin-Deyrançon about 7 kilometers from Olbreuse) and some even came out in the woods of Olbreuse. These tunnels were used during the French religious wars to allow Protestants to hide and to flee. They were well built, and it was sometimes even possible to stand up. At present, these tunnels are impassable or even destroyed.  The Desmier d'Olbreuse  A family of military tradition, they wore a coats of arms of prestigious simplicity: \\"quartered azure and silver four lilies in each color in the other,\\" in other words an azure fleur de lys in each silver quarter and a silver fleur de lys in each of the azure quarters. Tradition has it that this shield them was granted them by King John the Good at the battle of Poitiers. The genealogical dictionary of the families of Poitou by Henri Beauchet-Filleau finds their traces as far back as the 14th century.  Architecture  Olbreuse does not present itself as one of these splendid homes by which the nobles could show their power and wealth. Such constructions are also rare in the region. While it is very different today from what it was in the Middle Ages, it continues to be what it always was, a small castle, unpretentious and well integrated into the rural world, a distinguished home but remains however in the scale of a landscape of nuances and balance. By the thirteenth century until the late Middle Ages, the castle was arranged in a simple design -- a rectangle with a tower of four storeys of arrowslits at each corner. Only two of these towers remain. The building wing that connects them did not exist then. Instead there was a defensive wall that allowed access from the castle itself to the two advance towers. On the other side of the rectangle, a side wall joined the two towers now extinct. We still see the remains of that of the background in the corner of the old parking. Another front wall closed the courtyard but nothing remains of it today. There were wells that were especially deep (40 m) in the limestone soil, which provided water. The interesting woodwork that covers its imperial-style dome seems to date from the sixteenth or seventeenth century. Of the castle itself, the inhabited part consisted of a single building which were adjoined by the towers. Only half now remains now, the rest having been demolished. This home was lower than the current building and had narrower windows. We see traces of a semicircular door that indicates the level of the first floor. Under the house was dug a vault, still very well preserved, including the external input is clearly distinguished in the middle of the building. Such a device was not designed to defend against real hosts. It mainly served to keep the lord, his family, his people and villagers safe from the bands of prowlers who were not unknown, especially during the Hundred Years' War. In the eighteenth century, around 1760 if we are to believe the inscriptions placed on the lintel of some doors, the Prevot family commitment, then owner of the castle, removed the defensive wall and built the wing perpendicular to the central building of the body. The corner room is a large kitchen with stone paving and garden, in which stands a large fireplace. It has changed little since that time and the imposing rustic table remains in place. In contrast with the tower is installed a wood lounge very well preserved. At that time, the wing did not have high first floor windows: only a kind of attic with small openings. The roof, in the local manner, was still a slightly slanted roof of Roman tiles. The windows of the central building were enlarged and heightened first floor. The weathervanes on each of the towers are of the same period, as evidenced by the dates contained thereon. At the end of the nineteenth century, the castle returned to the Desmier family. They found it too small and decided to raise the floor of the wing, replacing the traditional roof with a much steeper frame they then covered with zinc. They also knocked down the second tower that is in ruins. Then began a period of deterioration for the building, which its owners do not have the resources to renovate. In 1967, one of the Olbreuse Desmier heirs, Christiane and her husband Felix Maingueneau, noting the extreme dilapidation the castle, decided to restore it and register it on the inventory of historical monuments.  Owners  As far back as can be traced, the castle has been owned by a branch of the family Desmier: The Desmier of Olbreuse. In the early seventeenth century, the castle owner Alexander Desmier d'Olbreuse (1608–1660) married in first nuptials Jacqueline Poussard De Vandre. From their union were born four children, Eleanor. He then married Jeanne Beranger Du Beugnon, and had two sons, Henri and Jean. The children of the first marriage like the ones from the second marriage died without heirs, except Eleanor. At his death in 1722, she left Olbreuse to her daughter, Sophia Dorothea. She was the wife of George I, King of Great Britain but she died in 1726; the castle became property of her children, George II and Queen Sophia of Prussia. In 1729, the castle was owned by the Prevot of Gagemont family until 1871. Later the castle belonged to Baron Charles Desmier of Olbreuse until 1915. His daughter Naomi inherited it and owned it until her death in 1964. Upon her death the castle returned to her daughter, Christiane Desmier of Olbreuse and her husband Félix Maingueneau, who owned it until 1996. It now belongs to the family.

She was ordered to bed rest for the days in between matches during the later part of the tournament. https://www.rugbyworld.com/countries/wales-countries/gemma-hallett-pontyclun- and-wales-1984 This tournament was said to be her last as she retired from the sport. Yet during her travels and blogging for the WRUhttp://wru- secure.sotic.net/eng/news/19519.php#.VpZ0gxWLTIU whilst following Wales' men at the 2010 World Cup, Hallett found herself playing for Nelson, New Zealand. Return to Wales Hallett returned to Wales and her Welsh club Pontyclun to continue playing one more season at amateur level. Following a series of good performances, echoing the style she had enjoyed in New Zealand, she captured the eyes of Regional and National coaches and was called back into the National set up.http://supporters.wru.co.uk/matchdaytv/?play=media&id;=13937 She was made Vice Captain for the 2013 Six Nations squad and captained the team in their warm up fixtures and game against France for the injured skipper Rachel Taylor. Her last game for Wales was the final 6 nations game against England that year. The same season Hallett was named Premiership Player of The Year at the annual WRU women's dinner, where she was presented with a trophy by her playing idol; Scott Quinnell. Hallett also captained the Cardiff Blues squad in 2012 and 2013 campaigns. In 2013, she made history in being the first woman to captain a Cardiff Blues side at the Cardiff Arms Park. During this campaign she led the Blues team to be regional champions after a thrilling match against the Ospreys. She openly expressed this as one of her proudest rugby moments. Overlooked by Wales After her most successful season in rugby Hallett was dropped from the Welsh squad and failed to make Rhys Edwards' 2014 Six Nations squad. Hallett has since proclaimed that she voiced her disapproval over the WRU managements decision to withdraw Wales Women from the RBS 6 Nations tournament and into a second tier competition. Being out of the international set up allowed Hallett the opportunity to represent invitational team the Nomads in World Cup 2014 warm up matches against Wales at the National Centre of Excellence and two fixtures against South Africa in their World Cup preparations in England. Her final game came in November 2014 where she led the Cardiff Blues invitational team against the Combined Services, in a special commemorative match marking 100 year anniversary of remembrance, played at the Cardiff Arms Park. In Retirement Since retiring from playing and coaching, Hallett has provided pitch-side commentary and studio punditry for Sky Sports, World Rugby, S4C and BBC.https://rugby.icdb.tv/person/371/Gemma- Halletthttps://forums.digitalspy.com/discussion/comment/89193504#Comment_89193504 Hallett has used her voice and platform to raise awareness of the failings of the WRU through a blog she wrote following the Welsh underperformance in the 2020 Women's Six Nations.https://medium.com/@gem_68313/how-the-wru-failed-its- women-c8e1132f8be References External links  * Rugby World Interview * Gemma Hallett RWC2010 Squad Announcement * World Cup 2010 Images * Hallett Returns to International Rugby * Player Stats 1981 births Living people Alumni of the University of South Wales Welsh female rugby union players ","title":"Gemma Hallett"},{"id":"48545898","text":"A velocity filter removes interfering signals by exploiting the difference between the travelling velocities of desired seismic waveform and undesired interfering signals.  Introduction  In geophysical applications sensors are used to measure and record the seismic signals.1\\\\. J.H. Justice, \\"Array processing in exploration seismology\\", in Array Signal Processing, S.Haykin. Ed. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1985, chap. 2, pp. 6-114.E.A.Robinson and T.S. Durrani, \\"Geophysical Signal Processing\\". Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1986. Many filtering techniques are available in which one output waveform is produced with a higher signal-to-noise ratio than the individual sensor recordings. Velocity filters are designed to remove interfering signals by exploiting the difference between the travelling velocities of desired seismic waveform and undesired interfering signals.R.L.Sengbush and M.R.Foster, \\"Optimum multichannel velocity filters\\", Geophysics, vol. 33, pp. 11-35, Feb. 1968. In contrast to the one dimensional output produced by multi-channel filtering, velocity filters produce a two- dimensional output. Consider an array of N sensors that receive one desired and M undesired broadband interferences. Let the measurement of nth sensor be modeled by the expression: : xn(t)= \\\\sum_{m \\\\mathop =0}^{M} amnsm(t-Tmn)+ŋn(t)___(1) where n=1,2,...,N; m=0,1,...,M; sm(t) are signals travelling across the array, and ŋn(t) represents zero-mean white random noise at the nth sensor, uncorellated from sensor to sensor. The parameters amn and Tmn are amplitude gain and time delays of the signal sm(t) when received at nth sensor. Without loss of generality, we shall assume that s0(t) is the desired signal and s1(t),s2(t),...,sM(t) are the undesired interferences. Additionally we shall assume that T0n=0, and a0n =1. This essentially means that the data has been time shifted to align the desired seismic signal so that it appears on all sensors at the same time and balanced so that the desired signal appears with equal amplitudes. We assume that the signals are digitized prior to being recorded and that the length K of time sequences of recorded data is large enough for the complete delayed interfering waveforms to be included in the recorded data. In the discrete frequency domain, the nth trace can be expressed as: : Xn(k)=S0(k) + \\\\sum_{m \\\\mathop =1}^{M} amnSm(k)e−jwkTmn \\\\+ Nn(k)___(2) where k=0,1,...,K-1; wk=(2π/K) is the sampling angular frequency. Using matrix notation, (2) can be expressed in the form: : X(k) = A(k) S(k) + N(k)___(3) Equation 4 Equation 5  Velocity filtering  Frequency domain multichannel filters F1(k), F2(k), ..., FN(k) can be applied to the data to produce one single output trace of the form,:M.T.Hanna and M.

That is, : F(k) = [F1(k), F2(k), ..., FN(k)] ___(8) By following the procedure discussed in,C.M. Chen and M.

SPIL No. 91-01, 1991. an optimum filter vector F(k) can be designed to attenuate, in the least square sense, the undesired coherent interferences S1(k),S2(k),...,SM(k) while preserving the desired signal S0(k) in Y(k). This filter can be shown [6],[7] to be of the form: Equation 9 where h is an arbitrary N x 1 nonzero vector, u = [1,0,...,0], I is the unit matrix, Br(k) is a submatrix of the matrix obtained by dropping all linearly dependent rows, and L(k) is a lower triangular matrix satisfying: : [L(k) Br(k)] [L(k) Br(k)]H = I Equation 10 The multichannel processing scheme described by [6]-[11] produces one dimensional output trace. A velocity filter, on the other hand, is a two-dimensional filter which produces a two-dimensional output record. A two-dimensional record can be generated by a procedure which involves repeatedly applying multichannel optimum filters to a small number of overlapping subarrays of the input data,.M.

Fig. 1. A sliding subarray of multichannel filters More specifically, consider a subarray of W channels, where W<th trace of the output record, and traces N-W+1,N-W+2,...,N of the input record produce the (N-W+1)st trace, which is the last trace, of the output record. For a large N and small W, as is typically the case in geophysical data, the output record can be viewed as comparable in dimensions to the input record. Clearly for such a scheme to work effectively W must be as small as possible; while at the same time it must be large enough to provide the necessary attenuation of the undesired signals. Note that a maximum of W-1 undesired interferences can be totally suppressed by such a scheme.Chih-Ming Chen and Marwan A.Simaan,\\"Velocity Filters for Multiple Interfaces in Two-Dimensional Geophysical Data\\", IEEE Trans. on geoscience and remote sensing,Vol 29.No.4,pp. 563-570, July 1991.Magdy T, Hanna, \\"Velocity Filters for multiple interference attenuation in Geophysical Array Data\\",IEEE Trans. on geoscience and remote sensing, Vol 26,No. 6,pp. 741-748, November 1998.

(Achievement Rewards for College Scientists) is an American nonprofit volunteer women's organization that promotes US competitiveness by providing financial awards to academically outstanding US citizens studying to complete degrees in science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM), and health disciplines at 49 of the nation's leading research universities. The organization has awarded more than $115 million to 10,000 scholars since 1958. ARCS Foundation Scholars have produced thousands of research publications and patents, secured billions in grant funding, started science-related companies, and played a significant role in teaching and mentoring young people in the STEM pipeline.  History  In 1958, a group of visionary women volunteers from Los Angeles, California lead by Florence Malouf met with California Institute of Technology President Lee DuBridge to begin a discussion about what could be done to elevate the United States of America's scientific leadership and competitiveness. Together they created a unique partnership between science and society. ARCS Foundation would soon become a model for women's science educational philanthropy. Focusing on science by investing in scientists, science student graduate school scholarships would soon be seen as a targeted, effective way to further science philanthropy in America. ARCS Foundation also brought stronger focus to women's leadership in science philanthropy as the organization grew nationally. Initially focused upon its US space program contribution, the Houston and Washington, D.C. Chapters were established, with each Chapter cultivating strong relationships, raising funds and supporting scholars from leading universities in their home states. As the primary implementer of ARCS Foundation mission, Chapters unite with the national organization as advocates for education and research, and to engage public awareness of science challenges and successes. ARCS Foundation is still a group of women focused on the future, proud of its dynamic history of giving and growing. ARCS Foundation has grown to more than 1,200 members in 15 Chapters across the United States, all of whom dedicate volunteer hours and financial support on behalf of undergraduate and graduate students of science. Since its founding, ARCS Foundation has provided more than 10,000 graduate students of science with awards totaling more than $115 million. Though the areas of science, engineering, and medical research have expanded beyond the focus of the US space program contribution, the parameters established by ARCS Foundation's steadfast founders still guide the organization today in the realization of their mission. The main objective was declared on the Caltech campus in Pasadena, CA on September 18, 1958: \\". . . raise money for scholarships and fellowships (now known as Scholar Awards) . . . for the support of both undergraduate and graduate students.

It is a human parasite causing metagonimiasis. It is among other disease that cause metagonimiasis (metagonimus takahashi and metagonimus miyatai). Distribution This species occurs in Korea, China, Taiwan, Japan, Russia, Indonesia, Israel, and Spain. This species is found in areas with sweetfish, and that includes western and eastern riversides. It is basically found in places with water. Description Adult Metagonimus yokogawai. Metagonimus yokogawai has adult flukes that parasitize the small intestine and causes inflammation. This species was discovered by Fujiro Katsurada with egg samples from Japan and Taiwan With this discovery, he was able to make a new genus of trematodes that this new parasite would fall under <\\"test\\" /> The size of these eggs are about 29 μm. Evidence also suggest that this parasite was present during the Yi dynasty. Different species of trematodes Life cycle Life cycle of Metagonimus yokogawai. The first intermediate hosts of Metagonimus yokogawai include freshwater snails Semisulcospira libertina, Semisulcospira coreana, and Semisulcospira reiniana. The second intermediate host include freshwater fish: Plecoglossus altivelis, Tribolodon hakonensis, Tribolodon ezoe, and Lateolabrax japonicus. Natural definitive hosts are: dogs, cats, rats, and humans. Experminetal type hosts are: Syrian golden hamster. Here, the life cycle of Metagonimus yokogawai will be examined, however Metagonimus takahashii and Metagonimus miyatai follow similar life cycle pattern. All three species are hermaphroditic and capable of self-fertilization. Embryonated eggs are passed into an aquatic environment (fresh or brackish water) each containing a fully developed larva, called a miracidium. Development can’t proceed past this stage unless the eggs are ingested by the first intermediary host, freshwater snails. After the snail host ingests the eggs, miracidia emerge and penetrate the snail’s intestines. In the snail tissue, mircadia develop into sporocysts, then rediae, and finally emerge from the snail as cercariae. The cercariae then penetrate the skin or go under the scale of a fresh or brackish water fish and encyst as metacercariae in the tissue. The type of fish that serves as secondary host varies based on location. The host then becomes infected by consuming undercooked, raw, or pickled fish containing the infectious metacercariae. The metacercariae then excyst in the small intestine of the host (human, mammal or bird), and develop into adults. In the small intestine, the adults attach to the walls and develop new eggs.

It was designed by the Queensland Department of Public Works and built in 1877 by Franz Kuhnel and William Starke. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The earliest building at Kalkie State School was erected in 1877, with the playshed constructed in 1879-80. It was the first state school established in the Woongarra Scrub, and is the oldest school in Woongarra Shire. The playshed is one of the earliest surviving shingle-roofed playsheds in Queensland. The school was established to serve the needs of the small farming community of Kalkie, which developed in the early 1870s in the heart of the Woongarra Scrub, about east of Bundaberg. The area was open to selection from 1869, following resumption of half of Branyan Station (taken up in 1855) for closer settlement under the 1868 Crown Lands Alienation Act. In the early 1870s, the area attracted a substantial number of British, German and Scandinavian families. In the early years the principal cash crop was maize, but in 1876 the price of maize fell by 600%, and by the early 1880s, the Kalkie/Woongarra farmers had turned to sugar. In 1882 the large Millaquin sugar refinery was established, and numerous juice mills, whose output was piped to the refinery, were erected in the Kalkie/Woongarra district in the following decade. From its inception, the school served as a focus for a variety of community activities, including a meeting on 10 December 1879 in which prospective ratepayers of the Barolin Division, which encompassed the Woongarra scrub, agreed to seek permission to elect their first divisional board under the new Divisional Boards Act. Whether the first board met at the school subsequently has not been established. In April 1875, Kalkie residents petitioned the Board of Education for the establishment of a national school in their district. Henry Easther, Secretary of the School Committee, offered a 5-acre site, to be surveyed from his homestead selection (portion 388, parish of Kalkie), for school purposes. The block was on a corner location, on the Sandhills Road (now Bargara Road). An alternative site, a little west along the Sandhills Road, was presented by a Mr Hermann, but in mid-1876 the district inspector for schools recommended Mr Easther's block, which had the advantage of dual road frontages. The Committee was informed in November 1876 that their request for a school at Kalkie had been approved, subject to the conditions of the new Education Act of 1875, which stipulated that the school committee must raise one-fifth of the cost of construction. Subscriptions to the building fund were slow, with local farmers struggling to make a living from maize cropping. The school committee also appear to have been responsible for clearing the front half of the block, the whole of which was covered in dense scrub. In November 1876, the new Department of Public Instruction requested the Department of Public Works to call tenders for a school and teacher's residence at Kalkie, to be based on plans then in preparation for a school at Wivenhoe, in the Brisbane Valley. Tenders were called in December 1876, but were considered too high. Subsequently, tenders were called in April 1877 for a combined school and residence, based on the plans then being prepared for Tallebuggera. The contract was let to Bundaberg builders Franz Kuhnel and William Starke, with a contract price of and construction period of 13 weeks. The building, which comprised a schoolroom long and an attached teacher's residence of 8 rooms at the rear, was erected on the southern corner of the block, with the schoolroom facing the Sandhills Road, and the residence facing the side road, which became known as School Lane (now Zielke Avenue). Both sections were constructed of weatherboards, set on timber stumps, and roofed with timber shingles (replaced in 1898 with galvanised iron). Construction was completed early in 1878, and the school opened on 11 February that year. In October 1879, the School Committee informed the Department of Public Instruction that a subscription of had been raised toward fencing and clearing the school grounds, and erecting a playshed. Tenders were called in November, and the contract let to H Hunt of Bundaberg. The price of the shingle-roofed playshed was , and the fencing consisted of of split two-rail fence, and of two-rail and paling fence, and of sawn batten fence with gates. Hunt's work was completed by March 1880. The fencing has since been replaced, but the playshed remains in its original location. The shingles on the northern end were replaced in 1970, as a combined Rotary and Kalkie P & C project, but those on the southern end may be original. By 1884 the school, which had been erected to accommodate approximately 30 students, was grossly overcrowded, with an average attendance of 60 to 70. There was no verandah, and the head teacher was forced to accommodate pupils in the attached residence. Tenders for additions, comprising a classroom extension and a verandah along the length of the building, with a hat room and lavatory at each end, were called in late May 1884. Despite tenders being called, the work was let by private contract in June, for the price of , which was substantially lower than the tendered prices. It appears that the Cook Pines (Araucaria columellaris) near the playshed date to the 1880s. In 1977-78, students who had attended Kalkie State School in the late 1890s recalled climbing these trees, which were then about tall. The pines are native to French New Caledonia and surrounding islands, and may have some connection with the large South Sea Islander population brought to the Kalkie/Woongarra district in the 1880s and 1890s, to work on sugar cropping. In 1900, the School Committee requested that the school be detached from the residence and removed to another part of the site, and the residence upgraded. This work was undertaken in 1906, with the school building re-located to the north, behind the playshed. A new verandah was added to the rear of the classroom block, with two new windows and a door cut into the wall to which the residence had been attached. Most of these and the original window openings were enlargened later, in the 1920s. In 1934, the District Works Supervisor recommended that a new teacher's residence be provided, and that the school be extended with the addition of a standard teachers' room, . Tenders for the new teachers' room and repairs and painting to the school building were called in mid-1935, and the contract was let to SJH Byrne of Bundaberg, with a price of . A southern wing was added later, probably in the 1940s, and the present staffroom was added in the early 1960s. These have been included in the heritage listing. The new teacher's residence was finally erected in 1937, at a cost of approximately . The second residence was erected in front of the 1877 house, where the schoolroom was located originally, facing the main road to Bundaberg. It was described as a standard Type 5 Teacher's Residence, constructed of timber and galvanised iron roofing, with 3 bedrooms, hall, bathroom, living room, dining verandah, kitchen, maid's room, front and side verandahs, a laundry under the house, an earth closet in the backyard, and two tanks. At the request of the then head teacher, Arctic glass was substituted for plain glass specified for the windows. This building also is included in the heritage listing. In late 1937, the first residence was sold and removed from the site. An expanding school population has necessitated the construction of a number of buildings and structures at Kalkie State School since the 1970s. These are not included in the heritage listing. In 2014, Kalkie State School had an enrolment of 308 students with 29 teachers (24 full-time equivalent).  Description  Kalkie State School, located on a level site on the western corner of Bargara Road and Zielke Avenue, includes an early school building, a playshed, groups of mature trees and a residence. The early school building, consisting of two intersecting wings fronting Zielke Avenue to the northeast, is a two-storeyed weatherboard structure with tall concrete stumps and corrugated iron gable roofs. The ground level contains storage rooms and play areas with a concrete floor, while the first level has class rooms, offices and verandahs. The northwest wing, separated from the angled intersecting eastern wing by verandah space, has undergone a number of changes and now contains a class room at either end with office and corridor space between. The western class room has diagonally boarded raked ceilings with exposed rafters and collar-beams, and the northern class room has boarded ceilings raked to collar-beam level and contains an enclosed section of the northwest verandah. Both rooms have louvred rectangular skylights, vertically jointed boarding to walls and a combination of aluminium framed louvres and timber casement and hopper windows. The angled intersecting eastern wing contains a class room, principal's office, staff room and northern verandah. This wing has hardboard sheeting to walls and ceilings, and aluminium framed louvred and timber hopper windows. The playshed, located to the south of the early school building behind the row of trees fronting Bargara Road, consists of a timber shingle gable roof with kick-out eaves to the boarded gable ends. The roof is supported by ten timber posts and has no ceiling with the roof structure visible. The playshed has a brick paved floor and perimeter bench seating. The mature trees include four figs, two Cook Pines and one Camphor Laurel to the Bargara Road frontage; two Cook Pines near the playshed; three figs to the northwest of the school and two figs to the Zielke Avenue frontage. The Cook Pines are exceptionally tall and narrow, and together with the fig trees, create a substantial local landmark. The residence, located at the eastern corner of the site, is a two- storeyed weatherboard structure with tall concrete stumps and a hipped corrugated iron roof with projecting front gable above a bay window. The building has verandahs, which have been enclosed with insect screens, to the northeast and southeast with timber batten balustrades and angled timber brackets. The southwest elevation has casement windows and timber batten window hoods.  Heritage listing  Kalkie State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Kalkie State School is significant as the first state school established in the Woongarra Scrub, and as the oldest school in Woongarra Shire. The first classroom block, the original playshed, and the early plantings of Cook Pines, figs and Camphor Laurel trees, are important for their association with the earliest establishment of the school. They also provide evidence of the initial development of the Kalkie area in the 1870s and 1880s. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The playshed is a highly decorative example of its type, and is one of the earliest surviving shingle-roofed playsheds in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The residence is an intact example of an interwar Type 5 Teacher's Residence, which, together with the first school building, playshed and mature trees, form the nucleus of the school. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Cook Pines, together with the group of fig trees, create an exceptional and substantial local landmark which also act as an identity marker for the school. The playshed and Cook Pines also form the school's focal point and are used to comprise the school's emblem. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It has had a long association with the Kalkie/Woongarra community as the centre of local education and a focus for community activity.

This film is Fu's directorial debut. Plot Teng Yuanfeng (Pu Cunxin) cannot understand why Lin Qiao (Xu Qing) divorced him and moved into a crowded apartment — by herself, since he won the custody battle. They've always had a loving relationship; sometimes Lin complained about his work and business trips, but nothing suggested a breakup. One day, Lu Xinxin (Tao Hong), who knew Lin as the one-time a cappella singer for her musician husband Zhang Ke (Guo Feng), bumps into Lin and notices the uncanny resemblance between her husband and Lin's son. She begins to follow the child, and later Zhang does the same. This gets the attention of Teng, who also realizes the unthinkable: the son that he has loved and cared for 4 years is not his. Furious, Teng sues Zhang for homewrecking and neglecting parental responsibilities. He leaves the child with Lin, but does not involve her in the lawsuit as he still loves her. Lin admits to a regrettable affair at a period of extreme loneliness (when Teng was away in Copenhagen covering the UEFA Euro 1992), and tells him that she filed for divorce because she could no longer bear the sight of the child and Teng together. Meanwhile, Zhang gets depressed especially since Lu also leaves him, though she comes back following his failed suicidal attempt. At the hearing, Lin (who is summoned as a witness) tells the court that while not his biological father, Teng has always cared for the child and done everything a father can. Teng gets emotional and drops the lawsuit. Afterwards, Lin calls Teng to tell him that she is leaving for good with the child, and Teng does not say anything. He encounters a lovesick man on the street and realizes that he cannot live without Lin and her son.

By the time the case got to trial, all counts were dropped except the four counts of explosives possession and one of \\"counseling mischief not committed.\\" He remained behind bars for 11 months before finally being granted bail.

The race was composed of seven stages, with the first stage starting in and the last stage finishing in Strasbourg, a city in Alsace that with the end of hostilities had again become part of France. The stages took the race to Luxembourg City, Brussels, Amiens, Paris, Bar-le-Duc and Belfort. The race was approximately long, with riders covering around per day, with a rest day in between each stage. The race was organised by the newspaper Le Petit Journal as a means of reinvigorating bicycle racing in the region following World War I, to honour those who died in the war and for publicity purposes for the newspaper. It was announced on 5 January 1919, less than two months after the armistice of 11 November 1918. Although Europe was in the midst of reconstruction and then at the height of the deadly flu pandemic, the Petit Journal's 8,500 franc purse, the equivalent of four years' wages for a typical working man, guaranteed that the race would attract top talent. The newspaper also organised a number of other sporting events during 1919, including a football tournament for the liberated regions, an air race, a cross-country running race, a swimming competition and a boxing match. Although 140 riders registered for the race, many could not train or muster basic equipment, leaving just 87 riders to start the race in Strasbourg, including the prominent riders Oscar Egg, Jean Alavoine, Ali Neffati (who wore a fez) and Paul Duboc, as well as future cycling champions Jules Vanhevel, Lucien Buysse and Albert Dejonghe. The race was won by the Belgian Charles Deruyter, who finished with a lead of 2 hours 25 minutes. He was reportedly so cold at the end of the third stage that he was unable to sign his name, having astonished observers at the finish line of the second stage by crossing in a full-length woman's fur coat that had been given to him by a spectator along the way. Historian Christopher Thompson reports that of the 87 riders who started the race, only 13 successfully finished it. It has since been described as the toughest cycle race in history. World War I had reduced many of the towns and villages that the race passed through to rubble. Le Petit Journal reported on \\"terrible weather, broken roads, freezing wind and icy conditions\\". Some local newspapers had warned before the event that the roads were in such a poor condition as to be unsuitable, but the organisers argued that these conditions bestowed prestige on the race, citing military cyclists who used the same roads under machine-gun fire. Given only rudimentary directions, riders had to search through piles of rubble at various crossroads to find signage directing them to the next town; some former villages were discernable only by smears of red brick dust. As a result of shortages caused by the war, the competitors also had to deal with poor supplies of food and poor-quality tires. Newspapers including Le Petit Journal and L'Auto did not see the difficulties of the event as evidence of the state of post-war France, but rather celebrated the race's competitors as \\"heroic survivors\\" who symbolised national revival; some 67 professional French cyclists were known to have died during the conflict. Upon its completion, the event's organisers called it a \\"victory ... for the French race\\". The publication Vélo-Sport praised the Belgian participants as \\"géants de courage et de volonté\\" (\\"heroes of courage and willpower\\") who had given the public \\"lessons in vigour\\". A race of the same name was held again in 1920, but it was organised as a one-day race rather than a stage race. This event was won by the French rider Henri Pélissier.

He was also an expert on the history of Dutch folk costumes and wrote several short works on that subject. Biography  His father was the architect and painter, . His brother, Antoon, also became a painter and his sister, Phemia, an artist as well. He began his studies in Amsterdam at the \\"Rijksnormaalschool voor Tekenonderwijzers\\" (Royal Normal School for Technical Drawing), a school that was founded by his father. He graduated in 1891 and, for a short time, worked as an architectural draftsman in the offices of Pierre Cuypers.Biographical notes @ Kunstbus. He maintained a lifelong interest in church architecture and wrote an influential article on the topic for De Katholieke Illustratie, Mother at the Linen Closet (1895) He felt more drawn to decorative painting and portraiture so, in 1892, he enrolled at the Rijksakademie, where he studied with August Allebé, Gerrit Willem Dijsselhof, and his uncle, . His first major commission was a portrait of Jan Six, a Professor at the Akademie and well-known art collector. He later did portraits of many notable figures in the Catholic Church. In 1897, he won the Willink van Collenprijs. His writing career began in 1894, with essays on art for De Tijd. In 1900, he helped co-found a publication called \\"Van Onze Tijd\\" (In Our Times). His reactions against those who disagreed with him were often passionate and took up much of his time. In 1901, the priest and poet, Herman Schaepman advised him that \\"art is not criticism or contemplation, it is an act\\". He ignored this advice and became something of an outcast from the artistic community because of his focus on polemics and controversy. In those years, Molkenboer's artistic efforts also became fragmented, as he dabbled in etching, lithography, sculpting, glass painting, ceramics and furniture design in a quest for versatility. He served as the Director of a pottery factory in Utrecht from 1901 to 1904. Following the example of his brother, Antoon, he began making lengthy stays in the United States to give personal service to his American customers. He spent much of the years 1909 to 1913 living there, mostly in Boston and Washington. His most prestigious commission was a portrait of President William Howard Taft, who posed for him in 1912 at the White House.Molkenboer's portrait of Taft @ the Library of Congress. Poster for the \\"Vereeniging voor Vrouwenkiesrecht\\" (1918) On returning to the Netherlands, he began his collection of Dutch costumes and organized the first Festival of National Costumes, held in September, 1913. He spent the next few years travelling throughout the Low Countries, taking photographs and collecting data on the local folk costumes, which were in danger of disappearing. He put together a booklet that was published in 1917, but was unsatisfied and asked the Ministry of the Interior to subsidize further studies and the collection of actual costumes. The Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences backed his plan, but he was opposed by , the Director of the \\"Nederlands Museum van Geschiedenis en Kunst\\", a division of the Rijksmuseum devoted to acquisitions. His battles with the government bureaucracy left him exhausted and he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. In 1920, he went to a sanatorium in the Swiss Alps, seeking a cure, but died a few months later. His art works and collections were auctioned off the following year. In 2010, his painting \\"The Toilette\\" was used on the Netherlands 44 Eurocent postage stamp.Het Toilet @ Catawiki.

The location of Kedouktos has not been identified with any certainty, but it lay near the river Halmyros (modern Kalivri Dere), and between the towns of Daneion (modern Kınalıköprü) and Herakleia (modern Marmara Ereğlisi). The name is evidently a hellenization of the Latin aquaeductus and refers to a local aqueduct; despite its vicinity with it, it was probably not part of the great system that supplied the Byzantine capital, Constantinople. The site is first mentioned in 813 as Akedoukton or ta Kidoktou, when Michael I Rhangabe campaigned against the Bulgars, and was escorted by his wife Prokopia. Her presence was unwelcome to the troops, who rioted. In October or November 822, the plain was the site of the decisive battle in the rebellion of Thomas the Slav, between the rebel forces and the Bulgars under Omurtag, who was allied to Emperor Michael II the Amorian. The battle was costly for both sides and resulted in no clear winner, but weakened Thomas, leading to the collapse of his rebellion in spring 823. The site appears again during the rebellion of Nikephoros Bryennios the Elder against Nikephoros III Botaneiates in 1078. Shortly before the Battle of Kalavrye, where Bryennios was defeated by Botaneiates' general Alexios Komnenos, the rebel army had camped at Kedouktos. In a praktikon of 1104, it is listed among the possessions of the Iviron Monastery on Mount Athos. At the turn of the 13th century it formed an imperial episkepsis, and was recorded in the Partitio Romaniae (\\"pertinentia Cedocti\\") as one of the areas allotted to the individual Crusader knights.

Deposition by Rosso Fiorentino The canvas of the deposition was commissioned by the Confraternity initially from Raffaellino del Colle. However the Sack of 1527 had exiled Rosso from Rome, and while in Sansepolcro, he was given the commission. The recent events in Rome likely contributed to the painting's dark and turbulent assembly, relative to the painter's prior depiction of the same subject in his Volterra masterpiece. The Sansepolcro Deposition depicts a mob surrounding a cadaverous Christ and his grieving mother, including monstruous or hooded faces in the background; the Volterra painting is more intimate and depicts those struggling with physically lowering the delicate corpse, in addition to those struggling with the emotional impact of the death.Toscana oggi, article of the Rosso Deposition.

Federal Trade Commission, 574 U.S. ___ (2015), was a United States Supreme Court case on the scope of immunity from US antitrust law. The Supreme Court held that a state occupational licensing board that was primarily composed of persons active in the market it regulates has immunity from antitrust law only when it is actively supervised by the state. The North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners had relied on the Parker immunity doctrine, established by the Supreme Court case Parker v. Brown, which held that actions by state governments acting in their sovereignty did not violate antitrust law.  Background  North Carolina legislation had designated the North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners (NCBDE) to be \\"the agency of the State for the regulation of the practice of dentistry\\" and required that six of the eight members of the Board must be licensed, practicing dentists. Acting upon complaints by dentists, the Board issued cease-and-desist orders to non-dentists offering tooth whitening services and teeth whitening product manufacturers, often warning that the practicing without a license of dentistry is a crime. These orders prompted many non-dentists to stop offering these services in North Carolina. On June 17, 2010, the Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint to the FTC administrative court alleging that the Board's actions were anti-competitive and unlawful under the Federal Trade Commission Act. An administrative law judge refused to dismiss the complaint on the Board's claim that they had state-action immunity and later ruled that the Board's concerted action constituted an unreasonable restraint of trade and a method of unfair competition, falling afoul of antitrust law. The ruling was sustained by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari. Oral arguments were held on October 14, 2014. Opinion of the Court The Supreme Court ruled 6–3 that a state licensing board that is composed primarily of active market participants has state action immunity from antitrust law only when it is actively supervised by the state. Justice Anthony Kennedy begins his opinion for the Court by extolling the Sherman Antitrust Act as “a central safeguard for the Nation’s free market structures.”North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners v. FTC, 135 S. Ct. 1101 (2015). That said, Justice Kennedy notes that the States’ power to regulate would be \\"impermissibly burdened\\" if they had to obey United States antitrust law.135 S. Ct. 1101 citing Frank H. Easterbrook, Antitrust and the Economics of Federalism, 26 J. Law & Econ. 23, 24 (1983). To address this, the Court in Parker v. Brown (1943) granted California immunity from federal antitrust laws after the state created a New Deal raisin cartel. Statehouses happily delegated Parker immunity to trade associations and when attorneys began using this delegation to set a price floor the Court in Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar (1975) found Parker immunity required what Justice Kennedy calls “more than a mere facade of state involvement”. Because the Sherman Act was designed to break private monopolies,135 S. Ct. 1101 citing Einer Elhauge, The Scope of Antitrust Process, 104 Harv. L. Rev. 667, 672 (1991). Justice Kennedy does not accept that the “congressional judgment” was to allow the States to delegate their immunity to a private monopoly.135 S. Ct. 1101 citing Merrick Garland, Antitrust and State Action: Economic Efficiency and the Political Process, 96 Yale L. J. 486, 500 (1986). After California delegated price fixing authority directly to wine merchants, the Court in California Retail Liquor Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc. (1980) began limiting immunity to where the State has articulated a clear anticompetitive policy and the State provides active supervision of the anticompetitive conduct.The Supreme Court—Leading Cases, 129 Harv. L. Rev. 371 (2015). North Carolina did not claim it had set any policy regarding teeth whitening nor did it claim it exercised any supervision over the Dentists Board. Nevertheless, because a city received Parker immunity without active State supervision in Hallie v. Eau Claire, , the Dentists Board claimed that active State supervision is unnecessary for any state agency. Unimpressed, Justice Kennedy writes that “Parker immunity does not derive from nomenclature alone” but rather from accountability to voters in elections. Because dentists control the Dentists Board, Justice Kennedy finds the need for the antitrust laws “applies to this case with full force, particularly in light of the risks licensing boards dominated by market participants may pose to the free market.”135 S. Ct. 1101 citing Arron Edlin & Rebecca Haw, Cartels by Another Name: Should Licensed Occupations Face Antitrust Scrutiny? 162 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1093 (2014). However, Justice Kennedy declines to define when a board is dominated or what State involvement is needed, writing “It suffices to note that the inquiry regarding active supervision is flexible and context- dependent.” The Dentists Board further argued that denying it antitrust immunity would remove the main incentive for dentists to serve on the board. Justice Kennedy responds by citing the Hippocratic Oath, writing “those who pursue a calling must embrace ethical standards that derive from a duty separate from the dictates of the state.”135 S. Ct. 1101 citing Steven H. Miles, The Hippocratic Oath and the Ethics of Medicine (2004). R. Rotunda & J. Dzienkowski, Legal Ethics: The Lawyer's Deskbook on Professional Responsibility (2014); Robert Baker, Before Bioethics: A History of American Medical Ethics From the Colonial Period to the Bioethics Revolution (2013). Dissent  Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas, dissented. Justice Alito begins by noting “there is nothing new about the structure of the North Carolina Board”135 S. Ct. 1101 fn.1 citing S. White, History of Oral and Dental Science in America 197– 214 (1876) (detailing earliest American regulations of the practice of dentistry). and that self-serving by such boards is, likewise, not new.135 S. Ct. 1101 fn.2 citing e.g., R. Shrylock, Medical Licensing in America 29 (1967) (detailing the deterioration of licensing regimes in the mid-19th century, in part out of concerns about restraints on trade); Walter Gellhorn, The Abuse of Occupational Licensing, 44 U. Chi. L. Rev. 6 (1976); Lawrence Shepard, Licensing Restrictions and the Cost of Dental Care, 21 J. Law & Econ. 187 (1978). Justice Alito then recalls that when the Sherman Act was enacted, Congress’s Commerce Clause power was much smaller and that at the time the States frequently set price controls.135 S. Ct. 1101 fn.3 citing Milton Handler, The Current Attack on the Parker v. Brown State Action Doctrine, 76 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 4–6 (1976). As such, Justice Alito believes denying the Dentists Board antitrust immunity “diminishes our traditional respect for federalism and state sovereignty”. For Justice Alito, the Dentists Board is clearly a state agency. As support, he includes the North Carolina statutes referring to the Dentists Board as a list of bullet points. Justice Alito also attacks Justice Kennedy for not articulating a clear standard of when a state agency is privately controlled. To underline this point, Justice Alito provides three full paragraphs of open questions. Finally, Justice Alito deplores of using the Court to address regulatory capture, speculating that even the FTC has been captured.135 S. Ct. 1101 fn.6 citing e.g., Roger Noll, Reforming Regulation 40–43, 46 (1971); James Q. Wilson, The Politics of Regulation 357–394 (1980). See Edward F.

Opened on February 10, 2016, the facility is home to the Toronto Raptors of the National Basketball Association (NBA), and owned by the team's owner, Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (MLSE). It is located on leased public land in Exhibition Place, near Dufferin Street and the Gardiner Expressway, west of downtown. It is named for OVO Sound, a Canadian subsidiary of Warner Records. Facility The two-storey facility has two full-size basketball courts, locker rooms, training and medical facilities, player amenities, and a \\"technologically advanced cognitive operations centre\\" powered by IBM Watson, which consolidates and analyzes data from many sources and represented through the centre's interactive displays and on mobile devices. Along with the Raptors, Canada Basketball and Raptors 905, the Raptors NBA G League affiliate team based in Mississauga, also use the facility. A section of the facility is reserved for MLSE, another is for community use and the basketball courts are shared between MLSE and community use. History In November 2013, it was reported that MLSE had contracted an architect to design a new practice facility for the Raptors. The team had trained on a practice court located within the Air Canada Centre (now the Scotiabank Arena) since its opening in 1999, and a new facility would allow this space to be repurposed into a restaurant or nightclub. MLSE proposed to build the facility on parking lot lands in the west end of City-owned Exhibition Place. The proposal meant the loss of 200 parking spaces, which would be replaced by replacing an adjacent ball diamond with a new parking lot. The proposal was approved by the Board of Governors of Exhibition Place on August 14, 2014, the Executive Committee of Toronto City Council on August 20, and the full Toronto City Council on August 25. Construction began in November 2014, with the facility completed in time for the team's hosting of the NBA All-Star Game in February 2016. Under the terms of the lease agreement, MLSE paid the construction cost of the facility and parking lot. MLSE leases the property from the City for $205,000 annually, plus city taxes, subject to reassessments for inflation, for a 20-year term, with two options to extend it by a further ten years, following which the City will take ownership of the building. MLSE requested that the City exempt the portion of the facility that is available to the public (32%) from city taxes. MLSE pledged to make the facility available for community use during the majority of daytime and evening hours. MLSE would contribute to the cost of a parking study of Exhibition Place, leading to a new parking facility and the reconstruction of green space to replace the ball diamond. The annual CNE Lions Club youth baseball tournament, which had been played at the diamond, was moved to Coronation Park, east of Exhibition Place, as an interim measure. In November 2015, it was announced that the facility would be named the BioSteel Centre, after corporate sponsor BioSteel Sports Nutrition. This ended in 2018 and the facility was renamed the Toronto Raptors Training Centre. On March 14, 2019, the Raptors announced that they had reached an agreement with OVO on a naming rights deal to rebrand the facility as the OVO Athletic Centre.

In 2015, it was determined that J0540-6919 is responsible for about half of the gamma-ray flux from the Tarantula Nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud. It was identified as a bright source of gamma radiation early in the Fermi mission.

After the suppression of his revolt, he evaded arrest by the French authorities by escaping to Turkey. He was pardoned and returned to Syria in 1936 and entered politics as part of the anti-French opposition. The French authorities again tried to arrest Bitar in 1945, but he managed to escape to Turkey, where he died the next year. Biography Bitar was born in 1886 to a Sunni Muslim, Arab family of landowners in the Latakia region and was raised in the port city of Latakia. In 1919, French troops landed on the Syrian coast to assume control of the country as part of their Mandate.Moubayed 2006, p. 372. Commander in the Hananu Revolt Al-Bitar formed a band of armed volunteers in 1919 to resist French military forces who were landing on the Syrian coast. Al-Bitar eventually joined the Hananu Revolt and was assigned responsibility over Jabal Sahyun, a mountainous region whose center was al- Haffah.Philipp and Schumann 2004, p. 278. He also coordinated military action with Saleh al-Ali who was leading the Alawite Revolt against the French in the mountains south of Jabal Sahyun. With material support from the Turkish armed movement fighting the French in southern Anatolia, Bitar acquired arms and military equipment. Within six months, his band grew from 100 members to 2,000, according to Syrian historian Sami Moubayed. The French declared their mandate over Syria in 1920 and issued an arrest warrant for al-Bitar on charges that he killed French officers and engaged in rebellion against French authority. Al-Bitar consequently fled to Turkey, while the French military authorities sentenced him to death in absentia. Al-Bitar's rebels mostly joined the rebel band of Izz ad-Din al-Qassam, also based in Jabal Sahyun.Schleifer, ed. Burke, p. 142. Al-Bitar remained in Turkey under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's protection for 16 years. Political career Al-Bitar returned to Syria in 1936 following nationalist Hashim al-Atassi's election to the presidency. Al-Atassi welcomed al-Bitar at the presidential palace in Damascus and praised him as a national hero. Upon his return, al-Bitar joined the National Bloc, the largest political party in Syria opposed to French rule. He based himself in Latakia. A year later, in 1937, al-Bitar was accused by the authorities of instigating violence against the French, who arrested him. He was imprisoned in the Citadel of Damascus. He was released in 1939, largely as a result of pressure Syrian nationalist politicians, but kept out of politics after his release. In 1943, he reentered politics as a candidate in the parliamentary elections. He evaded arrest by the French authorities in late May 1945 during a campaign against nationalist figures in Damascus. Al- Bitar left Damascus for Turkey, where he stayed until his death in 1946, the same year Syria became independent of France.

Its existence shows that, unlike the one-dimensional curve-shortening flow (for which every embedded closed curve converges to a circle as it shrinks to a point), the two-dimensional mean-curvature flow has embedded surfaces that form more complex singularities as they collapse. History The Angenent torus is named after Sigurd Angenent, who published a proof that it exists in 1992.. However, as early as 1990, Gerhard Huisken wrote that Matthew Grayson had told him of \\"numerical evidence\\" of its existence... Existence To prove the existence of the Angenent torus, Angenent first posits that it should be a surface of revolution. Any such surface can be described by its cross-section, a curve on a half-plane (where the boundary line of the half- plane is the axis of revolution of the surface). Following ideas of Huisken, Angenent defines a Riemannian metric on the half-plane, with the property that the geodesics for this metric are exactly the cross-sections of surfaces of revolution that remain self-similar and collapse to the origin after one unit of time. This metric is highly non-uniform, but it has a reflection symmetry, whose symmetry axis is the half-line that passes through the origin perpendicularly to the boundary of the half-plane. By considering the behavior of geodesics that pass perpendicularly through this axis of reflectional symmetry, at different distances from the origin, and applying the intermediate value theorem, Angenent finds a geodesic that passes through the axis perpendicularly at a second point. This geodesic and its reflection join up to form a simple closed geodesic for the metric on the half-plane. When this closed geodesic is used to make a surface of revolution, it forms the Angenent torus. Other geodesics lead to other surfaces of revolution that remain self-similar under the mean-curvature flow, including spheres, cylinders, planes, and (according to numerical evidence but not rigorous proof) immersed topological spheres with multiple self-crossings. prove that the only complete smooth embedded surfaces of rotation that stay self-similar under the mean curvature flow are planes, cylinders, spheres, and topological tori. They conjecture more strongly that the Angenent torus is the only torus with this property.. Applications The Angenent torus can be used to prove the existence of certain other kinds of singularities of the mean curvature flow. For instance, if a dumbbell shaped surface, consisting of a thin cylindrical \\"neck\\" connecting two large volumes, can have its neck surrounded by a disjoint Angenent torus, then the two surfaces of revolution will remain disjoint under the mean curvature flow until one of them reaches a singularity; if the ends of the dumbbell are large enough, this implies that the neck must pinch off, separating the two spheres from each other, before the torus surrounding the neck collapses.. Related shapes Any shape that stays self-similar but shrinks under the mean curvature flow forms an ancient solution to the flow, one that can be extrapolated backwards for all time. However, the reverse is not true. In the same paper in which he published the Angenent torus, Angenent also described the Angenent ovals; these are not self-similar, but they are the only simple closed curves in the plane, other than a circle, that give ancient solutions to the curve-shortening flow..

It was designed by Alfred Barton Brady and built in 1899. It is also known as Saltwater Creek Road Bridge. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Kennedy Bridge is a single span metal truss road bridge crossing Bundaberg Creek (also called Saltwater Creek), a tributary of the Burnett River, at Bundaberg. It was constructed in 1899 and was the smaller of two technically and visually related bridges designed by A.B. Brady for Bundaberg. The Burnett area was first settled by Europeans in the 1840s and 50s as a series of pastoral runs. In the late 1860s, as good agricultural land around Maryborough began to be scarce, agriculturalists and timbergetters became interested in land on the navigable Burnett River to the north. The foundation settlers of Bundaberg selected land in 1867-68 under the \\"Sugar and Coffee Regulations\\" stemming from the Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1860s which aimed to promote agriculture and closer settlement. The site of Bundaberg was officially surveyed in 1869. Coastal traffic grew, and copper was first mined at Mount Perry in 1871, which enabled Bundaberg to develop as a port and supply centre, in spite of competition from Maryborough for this trade. The provision of amenities was therefore of importance to the development of Bundaberg and this included bridges. Adam's Bridge, Bundaberg, 1878 Although the higher southern bank of the Burnett River was officially surveyed as the town site, both sides developed and were initially linked only by ferry. Prior to 1872, the creek prevented the movement of vehicular traffic between the town of Bundaberg and the Woongarra Division to the east. Government action was urged in 1872 and money voted for the construction of a bridge. However, every tender exceeded the government estimate. The difficulty was solved when local property owner, Walter Adams, assisted the project by deliberately underbidding. A timber bridge, known as Adam's Bridge, was built and was the first in the district. Adam's Bridge was replaced by another timber bridge in 1878. It was officially opened on Tuesday 26 March 1878 by the Queensland Governor, Arthur Kennedy, after whom the bridge was named. In the 1880s, Bundaberg boomed with the growth of the sugar industry in the region. Handsome and substantial masonry buildings began to rise in the city as evidence of its growing importance and prosperity. It was planned to replace the timber bridges, weakened by heavy traffic, by bridges not only stronger, but more in keeping the general upgrading of civic buildings. As a parallel project, two bridges of related design by A.B. Brady were constructed; the Burnett Bridge from Quay Street to Bundaberg North and this much smaller Kennedy Bridge across the Bundaberg Creek which opened in December 1899. It was funded under the Local Works Loan Act of 1880 and the Bundaberg Town Council and Woongarra Divisional Board bore two-thirds of its cost. It provided an example of co- operation between urban and rural local authorities for the advancement of the district in general. Kennedy Bridge at Bundaberg, circa 1911 The Kennedy Bridge is a reduced version of the Burnett Bridge which was opened on 24 August 1900. Both have similarities in structural design and appearance to the 1897 Victoria Bridge in Brisbane, which was demolished in the 1960s. All were designed by engineer and Government Architect, Alfred Barton Brady. A.B. Brady was born in 1856 and received his training in England. He became one of Queensland's most important early engineers and served the state in various departments for 37 years. He worked initially with the railways from 1885, then from 1889 with the Public Works Department, and then as Government Architect and engineer for bridges from 1892. Although Brady designed many important and handsome public buildings, his forte was bridge design and he designed a number of notable bridges. The Kennedy Bridge is interesting as an example of his work which is still in use and little altered.  Description  Kennedy Bridge, 1939 Kennedy Bridge joins Bourbong Street and Bourbong Street East over Saltwater Creek. It has a single metal truss span of and metal lattice trusses with a curved upper chord. It carries a roadway and a footpath. The metal deck spans between the lower chords of the trusses. Flanking the entrances to the bridge and rising above the trusses are \\"L\\" shaped concrete pylons, square in appearance from the roadway. They are neo- classical in influence and have a Doric style entablature on a rusticated base. There are lights on decorative metal brackets facing the approaches. Repair work to the bridge was carried out in 1991 and it has since been repainted. It remains in very much its original form.  Heritage listing  Kennedy Bridge was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Kennedy Bridge, opened in 1899, is important in illustrating the development and importance of Bundaberg in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as the centre of one of Queensland's most significant sugar-growing regions. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It is an important example of its type and is similar to, and closely associated with, the Burnett River Bridge, which was opened in 1900. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. It is important as a design of Alfred Barton Brady who, during 37 years of work for several departments of the Queensland government, made a major contribution to the development of the state in both architectural and engineering design.

It was the most successful of several popular magazines published by the Religious Tract Society, which produced Christian literature for a wide audience. Each issue mixed multiple genres of fiction and factual stories, historical and topical. The magazine's title referred to campaigns that had decreased work hours, giving workers extra leisure time. Until 1876, it carried the subtitle \\"A Family Journal of Instruction and Recreation\\"; after that, the subtitle changed to \\"An illustrated magazine for home reading\\". Each issue cost one penny and contained 16 pages. The layout typically included approximately six long articles, formatted in two columns per page, and five or six illustrations. The articles were a mix, including biographies, poetry, essays, and fiction. Each issue usually started with a piece of serialised fiction. The creation of the magazine was partly a response to non-religious popular magazines that the Religious Tract Society saw as delivering a \\"pernicious\\" morality to the working classes. The ethos of the magazine was guided by Sabbatarianism: the campaign to keep Sunday as a day of rest. It aimed to treat its diverse subjects \\"in the light of Christian truth\\".

Chinese literature has various anecdotes about Sun Deng refusing to teach the musicians Ji Kang (223-262) and Ruan Ji (210-263), two of the iconoclastic Seven Worthies of the Bamboo Grove. The moral of the story about Ruan Ji visiting Sun Deng, who preferred supernatural whistling over traditional master-disciple dialog, is the ineffability of the Dao (as explained in the opening of the Daodejing). The Chinese poetry of the Six Dynasties and Tang dynasty developed this narrative into the \\"absent recluse\\" genre, expressing the unfulfilled desire to obtain wisdom by entering into conversation with a sage-recluse dwelling in the mountains (Varsano 1999: 56). Ji Kang stories qin zither Ji Kang or Xi Kang (223-262) was a prominent intellectual of the Cao Wei (220-265) period, Daoist philosopher, author, poet, and musician. He was leader of the Seven Worthies/Sages of the Bamboo Grove, a group of intellectuals and artists who met occasionally at his estate to drink wines, take drugs, play music, and engage in witty qingtan \\"pure conversation\\". Ji Kang's polymathic interests ranged from xian \\"transcendence; immortality\\" techniques to music theory. His essay Yangsheng lun \\"On Nourishing Life\\" contends that one can achieve longevity through Daoist breathing exercises, diets (e.g., bigu), and drugs (Cold-Food Powder). Drug use was widespread among the literati in early medieval China, and Ji Kang was \\"reputed to have been a connoisseur in this field\\" (Chan 2014). Ji's writings on music include the famous Qin fu \\"A Rhapsody on the Qin\\" zither, Shengwu aile lun \\"Essay on the Absence of Sorrow or Joy in Music\\", and a number of solo pieces for qin. The classical Chinese stringed instrument qin 琴 \\"zither; [sometimes translated] lute\\" is called guqin 古琴 \\"old zither\\" in Modern Standard Chinese, owing to the common use of qin in names for instrumental loanwords (such as kouqin 口琴 \\"mouth organ; harmonica\\"). Sun Deng was renowned for playing a one-string version of the qin (一弦琴); the 499 Zhen'gao 真誥 (tr. Campany 2002: 516) says Sun Deng could \\"derive eight notes by plucking a single string.\\" Ji/Xi Kang and Ruan Ji were close friends, famous for their skills in poetry, music, and qingtan ripostes. They helped to develop xuanxue \\"Neo-Daoism\\" and emphasized the importance of ziran \\"naturalness; spontaneity\\". Ji and Ruan were in a homosexual relationship with Shan Tao, another one of the Seven Worthies, who described their friendship as \\"stronger than metal and fragrant as orchids\\" (tr. Hinsch 1990: 69). Ji Kang and Ruan Ji were such close friends that Jiruan 嵇阮 was a popular portmanteau for the pair. Ji and Ruan both tried unsuccessfully to study zither and transcendental whistling with Sun Deng. Shenxian zhuan Ge Hong's (4th century) Daoist Shenxian zhuan \\"Biographies of Divine Transcendents\\" hagiography of Sun Deng 孙登 has the earliest version of the story about his refusal to teach Ji Kang about zither playing. > Sun Deng's origin is not known.

Winter or summer he > wore only a single-layer garment, but when the weather grew extremely cold, > someone observed him loosen his hair and use it to cover his body. It was > over ten feet in length. When the Grand Mentor Yang Jun 楊駿 sent a messenger > to invite Sun Deng to converse with him, Sun made no reply. Yang Jun then > sent him a lined cloth robe as a gift. Upon its delivery, Sun came out from > his gate, borrowed someone's knife, and cut the robe in two; he then placed > the upper and lower halves in separate places outside Yang's gate. He also > made a loud sound as if he were being cut in two. At the time, people > thought him mad.

Sun then said, \\"Young man, you have excellent talent, but you lack > knowledge of how to preserve the body.

At this point, Sun, using only one > string, played a whole tune, and Ji, hearing it, sighed and became lost in > thought. (tr. Campany 2002: 336) Yang Jun (d. 291) was a Jin Dynasty (265-420) official during the reign of Emperor Wu and regent for Emperor Hui. Sun Deng's \\"death\\" and reappearance is typical for Daoist shijie 尸解 \\"release from corpse\\" fake burial, the lowest level of xian \\"transcendence\\". This \\"grave affair\\" refers to Ji Kang getting involved in Cao Wei court politics, and sentenced to death by regent Sima Zhao for testifying to help a friend. Shishuo xinyu The Shishuo Xinyu \\"A New Account of Tales of the World\\" (tr. Mather 1976: 332) says, \\"While Hsi K'ang was wandering among the mountains of Chi Commandery (Honan), he met the Taoist adept [道士], Sun Teng, and thereafter continued his wanderings in his company. As K'ang was on the eve of departing, Teng said, 'As far as your ability is concerned, it's high enough, but your way of preserving your own life is inadequate'.\\" The Shishuo xinyu commentary by the Liang dynasty scholar Liu Xiaobiao 劉孝標 or Liu Jun劉峻 (462-521) quotes four texts. First, the anonymous Xi Kang Jishu 嵇康集序 (tr. Mather 1976: 333) says, \\"In the summer Sun Teng wove garments out of grass, and in the winter he covered himself with his unbound hair. He was fond of reading the \\"Book of Changes\\" and playing a one-stringed zither. All who saw him were attracted and delighted by him.\\" Second, the Wei Shi Chunqiu 魏氏春秋 \\"Chronicles of the Clans of Wei\\", by Sun Sheng (ca. 302-373), says (tr. Mather 1976: 333), \\"Sun Teng was by nature free of both joy and anger. If anyone doused him under water and then brought him out to look at him, Teng would just laugh aloud. Whatever items of clothing or food were provided him by households where he stayed he would never decline, but when he left he would leave them behind.\\" Third, the (4th century) Wenshi zhuan 文士傳 \\"Biographies of Scholars\\" (tr. Mather 1976: 333), by Zhang Yin 張隱, gives this version of the story. > During the Chia-p'ing era (249-253) some people of Chi Prefecture had gone > into the mountains, where they saw a man. The place where he lived was an > overhanging cliff rising a hundred jen (about 700 feet), where dense woods > grew in shady luxuriance, yet his spirit and intelligence were extremely > bright. He said of himself that his surname was Sun and his name, Teng, with > the courtesy name, Kung-ho. When he heard of him, Hsi K'ang followed him > about for three years. K'ang asked for his prognosis concerning his own > future, but Teng never answered. However, K'ang always sighed in respectful > admiration over the fine subtlety contained in his godlike counsels. When > K'ang was about to take his leave, he said to the man, \\"Sir, have you > nothing, after all, to say?\\" Teng finally answered, \\"Do you know anything > about fire? When it is lit it gives light. Yet knowing when not to use the > light is, after all, included in knowing when to use it. When a man is born > he is endowed with ability. Yet knowing when not to use his ability is, > after all, included in knowing when to use it. Thus, knowing when to use > light is included in getting enough fuel to keep it burning, and knowing > when to use ability is included in understanding things well enough to > complete one's allotted years. Now your ability is abundant, but your > understanding slight. You'll have difficulty avoiding trouble in today's > world. Don't ask me anything more.\\" K'ang was unable to use his advice, and > when he became involved in the Lü An affair and was cast into prison, he > composed a poem reproaching himself, as follows: \\"In the past I used to > blush before Liu-hsia Hui, But now I am ashamed before Sun Teng.\\" Liu-hsia Hui or Liuxia Hui is the loyal politician Zhan Huo (720-621 BC). Fourth, Wang Yin's 王隱 (4th century) Jinshu (tr. Mather 1976: 333) explains, \\"Sun Teng was the one interviewed by Juan Chi. Hsi K'ang treated him as his teacher, with all the ceremony expected of a disciple. During the transition between Wei and Chin (ca. 260-265) it was easy to fall prey to jealousy and suspicion; both noble and base were engulfed together. For this reason Sun Teng was silent on some points.\\"  Zengxiang liexian zhuan The Yuan dynasty (c. 14th century) Zengxiang liexian zhuan 增像列仙傳 \\"Enlarged and Illustrated Collected Biographies of Transcendents\\" elaborates on Ji/Xi Kang meeting Sun Deng, and mentions transcendental whistling in addition to zither playing. > Sun Teng dwelt in a cave on the North Mountain in the prefecture of Chi [in > Honan]. In summer, he made himself garments of plaited straw; in winter he > covered himself only with his long hair. He was an expert in the art of > whistling without a break, and he loved to read the Canon of Changes and to > thrum a one-stringed lute. By temperament he was prone neither to joy nor to > anger. Once, we are told, in the hope of seeing him angry, a man pitched him > into the river, but when Sun Teng had scrambled out, he only burst into fits > of laughter. The high-born statesman Hsi K'ang accompanied him in his > wanderings for three years, yet whenever he questioned his Master about his > aims, he could get no reply. When about to leave him, Hsi K'ang said: \\"After > all this time, Sir, have you no word for me?\\" Sun Teng replied: \\"You know > what fire is, don't you? It has the natural property of giving light, but > not of using that light; yet its importance depends on the use made of its > light. In man, intellectual capacity is a natural gift, but not the use made > of that capacity; yet his worth depends on the use he makes of it. The use > of light is contingent on a supply of fuel wherewith to preserve its > radiance; and the use of intellect consists in acquiring a knowledge of Pure > Truth so as to keep one's life immune from harm.\\" Hsi K'ang also asked for > instruction in playing the lute, but Sun Teng would not teach him. \\"Your > intellectual capacity is great,\\" he said, \\"but your knowledge is small. It > will be difficult for you to pass unscathed through the world of to-day.\\" … > In the end, Sun Teng rose up to heaven in broad daylight (tr. Giles 1948: > 94-95) Ruan Ji stories Ruan Ji, (c. 9th century) Tang dynasty portrait Ruan Ji (210-263) was a skillful poet, essayist, and musician, who rebelled against orthodox Confucian rituals and conventions. He loved drinking wine, and his Jinshu biography says he avoided an arranged marriage into the Sima family by staying drunk for 60 days. The famous guqin-zither melody, Jiukuang \\"Drunken Ecstasy\\" is attributed to him. Ruan wrote philosophical essays about the Yijing, Daodejing, and Zhuangzi, his masterful Yonghuai shi \\"Songs of My Soul\\", and Yue lun \\"Disquisition on Music\\". Among recluse poets who practiced transcendental whistling as a way to absorb themselves into nature, Ruan Ji was the most famous whistler of the Jin dynasty (Su 2006: 32). After meeting Sun Deng, Ruan Ji immortalized him in Daren xiansheng zhuan \\"Biography of Master Great Man\\", which praises Daoist transcendence over the mundane world. Shishuo xinyu In the (5th century) Shishuo xinyu version of this transcendental whistling story about Ruan Ji, Sun Deng is referred to as the zhenren \\"perfected person\\" in the Sumen Mountains 蘇門山. > When Juan Chi whistled [嘯], he could be heard several hundred paces away. In > the Su-men Mountains (Honan) there appeared from nowhere a Realized Man [真人] > about whom the woodcutters were all relaying tales. Juan Chi went to see for > himself and spied the man squatting with clasped knees by the edge of a > cliff. Chi climbed the ridge to approach him and then squatted opposite him. > Chi rehearsed for him briefly matters from antiquity to the present, > beginning with an exposition of the Way of Mystical Quiescence [玄寂] of the > Yellow Emperor and Shen Nung, and ending with an investigation of the > excellence of the Supreme Virtue [盛德] of the Three Ages (Hsia, Shang, and > Chou). But when Chi asked his opinion about it he remained aloof and made no > reply. Chi then went on to expound that which lies beyond Activism [有為之教], > and the techniques of Resting the Spirit [棲神] and Conducting the Vital Force > [導氣]. But when Chi looked toward him for a reply, he was still exactly as > before, fixedly staring without turning. Chi therefore turned toward him and > made a long whistling sound [長嘯]. After a long while the man finally laughed > and said, \\"Do it again.\\" Chi whistled a second time [復嘯], but as his > interest was now exhausted, he withdrew. He had returned about half-way down > the ridge when he heard above him a shrillness like an orchestra of many > instruments, while forests and valleys reechoed with the sound. Turning back > to look, he discovered it was the whistling of the man he had just visited > [向人嘯]. (49, tr. Mather 1976: 331) Donald Holzman (2009: 154) comments on their meeting: \\"It (xiao) was an unintellectual art, probably a fairly strange kind of sound that is divorced from speech and reason....When Ruan Ji whistles Sun Teng sees that he is not merely a pedant, but also an adept of an art that imitates nature, that he is able to control his breath so as to make it resemble that very breath of heaven.\\" The Shishuo xinyu commentary by Liu Xiaobiao quotes two texts. First, the (4th century) Wei Shi Chunqiu 魏氏春秋 version says, > Juan Chi often went riding alone wherever his fancy led him, not following > the roads or byways, to the point where carriage tracks would go no farther, > and always he would return weeping bitterly. Once while he was wandering in > the Su-men Mountains there was a recluse living there whose name no one > knew, and whose only possessions were a few hu-measures of bamboo fruit, a > mortar and pestle, and nothing more. When Juan Chi heard of him he went to > see him and began conversing on the Way of Non-action [無為] of high > antiquity, and went on to discuss the moral principles [義] of the Five > Emperors and Three August Ones. The Master of Su-men remained oblivious and > never even looked his way. Chi then with a shrill sound made a long > whistling whose echoes reverberated through the empty stillness. The Master > of Su-men finally looked pleased and laughed. After Chi bad gone down the > hill, the Master gathered his breath and whistled shrilly with a sound like > that of the phoenix. Chi had all his life been a connoisseur of music, and > he borrowed the theme of his discussion with the Master of Su-men to express > what was in his heart in a song, the words of which are: \\"The sun sets west > of Mt. Pu-chou; The moon comes up from Cinnabar Pool. Essence of Yang is > darkened and unseen; While Yin rays take their turn to win. His brilliance > lasts but for a moment; her dark will soon again be full. If wealth and > honor stay but for a trice must poverty and low estate be evermore?\\" (tr. > Mather 1976: 331-332) Second, the Zhulin Qixian Lun 竹林七賢論 (tr. Mather 1976: 332), by Dai Kui 戴逵 (d. 396) explains, \\"After Juan Chi returned (from the Su-men Mountains) he proceeded to compose the \\"Discourse on Mr. Great Man\\" [大人先生論]. What was said in this discourse all represented the basic feelings in his breast and heart. The main point was that Mr. Great Man was none other than Juan himself.\\" Jin shu The (648) Book of Jin (49) biography of Ruan Ji uses changxiao and xiao to describe his meeting with Sun Deng. > Once [Juan] Chi met Sun Teng on Su-men Mountain. [Juan Chi] touched on > topics of ancient times, and on the arts of \\"posing the spirit\\" and \\"leading > the breath.\\" [Sun] Teng kept silent throughout. As a result, [Juan] Chi > expelled a long whistle [籍因長嘯而退], and took his leave. When he had descended > halfway down the mountain, he heard a sound like the cry of the phoenix > resounding throughout the peaks and valleys. It was the whistling of [Sun] > Teng [乃登之嘯也]. (tr. Varsano 1999: 56) Varsano (1999: 57) explains transcendental whistling as a direct representation of the ineffable Dao, \\"his superhuman whistle, a primordial sound that does not describe the secrets of the universe, but incarnates it.\\" The context goes on to say that after Sun Deng refused to talk with Ruan Ji, Xi Kang followed Sun Deng travelling for three years. Since Sima Zhao became generalissimo in 255, Holzman dates Ruan Ji's visit around 257, and Xi Kang's around 258 to 260. Based on the different mountain names, Chan (1996: 151, 158) says Ruan Ji visited Sun Deng twice, first around 226-230, and then around 255-263; and dates Xi Kang's travels at around 249-251. Xiaozhi The anonymous (c. 8th century) Xiaozhi 嘯旨 \\"Principles of Whistling\\" mentions Sun Deng and Ruan Ji—honorifically called Sun Gong 孫公 \\"Master Sung\\" and Ruan Sizong 阮嗣宗 (his courtesy name)—as the last transcendental whistlers, and describes whistling tunes attributed to them, \\"Sumen Mountains\\" retells the story of Ruan's visit to Sun, and \\"Loose Rhymes of Ruan\\" is an easy-whistling melody. The Xiaozhi Preface gives a transmission history of xiao-whistling that goes from mythological sages to the historical whistlers of Sun Deng and Ruan Ji (adapted from Edwards 1957: 219-220). Laozi transmitted the technique to Queen Mother of the West, up through Emperor Shun, who transmitted whistling to Yu the Great, \\"after whom the art declined. It revived with the Immortal of the Jin dynasty Sun Gong of Taihang Mountains. Sun found the Way (adopted the Daoist rule of life) and disappeared. Ruan Sizong had a smattering of the art but after him it was quite lost, and whistling was no longer heard.\\" Two Xiaozhi sections describe whistling tunes attributed to Sun Deng and Ruan Ji, \\"Sumen Mountain\\" (11) and \\"The Loose Rhymes of Ruan\\" (13). \\"Sumen [Mountain]\\" 蘇門 retells the story of Ruan Ji visiting Sun Deng, referred to as the Daoist master living on Sumen, like the Shishuo xinyu above. > The 'Su Men' was composed by the Taoist Immortal Recluse, who lived in the > Su Men Mountains (of Honan). The Holy One transmitted, he did not make it. > The Immortal transmitted (the music of) Kuang Ch'eng and Wu Kuang 務光 in > order to rejoice the spirit and expand the Tao. He did not regard music as > the main task. In olden days there were those who roved in Su Men listening > to the phoenix' songs. The notes were exquisitely clear, very different from > the so-called pretended phoenix. The phoenix makes sounds but humans cannot > hear them. How then can the Su Family know the sound of the phoenix? > Hereafter, when seeking the sound, bring up the Immortal's whistle. The > Immortal's whistle does not stop at fostering the Tao and gratifying the > spirits; for indeed, in everyday affairs it brings harmony into the world, > and peace in season. In oneself the Tao never dies, in objective matters it > assists all that is sacred, and conducts the Five Influences. In the arcana > of Nature order prevails. For success in obtaining response (to such > efforts) nothing approaches music. The Immortal has evolved the one > successful form. As to all wild things whistling is the one thing needful. > Yuan Szu-tsung of Chin (Yuan Chi) was a fine whistler. Hearing that the > Immortal thought himself his equal, he (Yuan) went to visit him. The > Immortal remained seated with his hair in disorder. Yuan bowed repeatedly > and inquired after his health. Thrice and again thrice he addressed his > (uncivil) host. The Immortal maintained his attitude and made no response. > Chi then whistled some score of notes and left. The Immortal, estimating > that his guest had not gone far, began to whistle the Ch'ing Chueh [清角] to > the extent of four or five movements. But Chi perceived that the mountains > and all growing things took on a different sound. Presently came a fierce > whirlwind with pelting rain, followed by phoenixes and peacocks in flocks; > no one could count them. Chi was alarmed, but also pleased, and he returned > home and wrote down the story. He obtained only two-tenths of it, and called > it 'Su Men'. This is what they tell there. The motif of the song is lofty > mountains and wide marshes, great heights and distances. (tr. Edwards 1957: > 226) The \\"Loose Rhymes of Ruan\\" section says, > The 'Loose Rhymes of the Yuan' were really composed by Yuan Chi. The rhymes > are free and easy; hence the title. … Both persons of refinement and culture > and commonplace and mean folk can listen with appreciation. The majesty of > the heavenly principle, purged from all miasmic influence, may mingle with > the ordinary music of the Hsuan and the Ch'ih, and the music of Cheng and > Yueh enter the ear. Most good whistlers can perform this air. Whenever > persons retired in the woods and by springs puff out wind and by accident > produce a rhymed sound, if their attempt misses success, it is simply a > misfire; if it is completely successful then it remains. The above gives a > general idea of the 'Loose Rhymes of the Yuan'. (tr. Edwards 1957: 227) These ancient instruments are the xun 塤 \\"a globular ocarina\\" and chi 篪 \\"a transverse bamboo flute\\", and these Zhou dynasty states were Zheng and Yue. The \\"Standard Notes\\" section (14, tr. Edwards 1957: 227) mentions Sun Deng and Daoist immortality, \\"In comparatively modern days, Sun Kung was successful, but people did not listen. As to peaceful notes [平和], they stave off old age and do not allow one to die. These Standard notes are known about, but the notes themselves are lost.\\" The Xiaozhi \\"Conclusion\\" section (15, tr. Edwards 1957: 228) says, \\"The conclusion is at the extremities of the [pentatonic] scale, the end of the Great Tao. After the days of Yao and Shun there was some idea of these notes, but the actual notes were lost.\\" It also dismisses the preface history with mythic whistlers like Queen Mother of the West and accepts the historicity of Sun Deng's and Ruan Ji's whistling. > is extravagant talk, and not usually accepted. But the twelve methods are > found in Sun Teng and Yuan Chi, so that we can truly say we have the general > purport of Whistling. The Preface also says that Sun Teng did not hand on > (the gift) to anyone, and after Yuan Chi it disappeared and was no more > heard. … Now the voice of man is the voice of the universe (nature). Man may > be ancient or modern, but sound is eternal, never new or old. Now this book > is going forth and who knows whether a Sun or Yuan may not appear in some > mountains or woods and, that being so, who can say that there is an end to > Whistling? (tr. Edwards 1957: 228) Hushao The preeminent Chinese avant-garde author Ge Fei wrote the (1995) Hūshào 忽哨 \\"Whistling\\" short story, which is a modern update on the story about Sun and Ruan. Victor Mair, who translated \\"Whistling\\" into English, says > An old legend of the celebrated encounter between the two men has Ruan Ji > visiting Sun Deng in his hermitage but not receiving any responses to his > questions. Thereupon, he withdraws and, halfway up a distant mountain, lets > out a loud, piercing whistle. This is followed by Sun Deng's magnificent > whistled reply, which inspires Ruan Ji to write the \\"Biography of Master > Great Man,\\" an encomium in praise of the Taoist \\"true man\\" that also > satirizes the conventional Confucian \\"gentleman\\". (1998:43) Ge Fei's \\"Whistling\\" tells how the young, famous poet Ruan Ji regularly came to visit the aged hermit Sun Deng on Su Gate Mountain 蘇門山 in present-day Henan, and play games of weiqi \\"go\\". During one go game, Sun was silently pondering how to move a piece, and Ruan surprised him. \\"When the whistling sound suddenly arose, Sun Deng was totally unprepared for it. The strange, strident sound, mixed with the sounds of the billowing pines, reverberated through the valleys of Su Gate Mountain for a long while without expiring.\\" (tr. Mair 1998:43). After a final game of go, Ruan took his leave from Sun owing to the \\"prolonged and profound silence that made him feel bored.\\" Sun watches Ruan's silhouette gradually dissolving into the dark green distance, > When the sound of whistling rose beneath the sunny empyrean, Sun Deng > shuddered as though it were a bolt out of the blue. Shielding his eyes from > the strong light with one hand, he saw Ruan Ji standing on the peak of Su > Gate Mountain beneath a solitary tree. Against a backdrop of white clouds > like thick cotton fleece, he stood motionless, seeing to wait for Sun Deng's > answer. Sun Deng looked all around him, then quietly inserted his thumb and > forefinger in his mouth—the extreme frailness of his body and the looseness > of his teeth caused him to be unable to produce any sound. The shrill, > desolate, plaintive whistle, accompanied by the soughing of the billowing > pines, reverberated for a long time in the mountain valleys. It was like the > sad wail of the poet who died long ago, penetrating through the barriers of > time, continuing up till today, and sinking into the easily awakened dreams > of a living person. (tr.

He was one of Queensland's most important early engineers and was particularly known for his bridge design. He was the Queensland Colonial Architect and many of his buildings and structures are now heritage-listed. Early life Alfred Barton Brady was born on 1 February 1856 in Manchester, England. He was educated in private schools. Architecture career On 15 January 1872 at age 15, Brady commenced his training as a pupil of Charles William Green, an architect and civil engineer of Manchester and Liverpool. As Green was the official architect for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, Brady gained experience working with their engineering and architecture department. From March 1879 to October 1884, Brady worked in London and other parts of England gaining experience with water supply, sewerage and drainage. Brady immigrated to Brisbane in December 1884 and was employed by the Queensland Public Service in January 1885 and served the state in various departments for 37 years. From 1885, he worked initially for the Queensland Railway Department from 1885 and then from 1889 with the Public Works Department. He was appointed Engineer for Bridges in 1889 and then as the Queensland Colonial Architect in 1892. He was appointed Under-Secretary for the Public Works in 1901. Although Brady designed many important and handsome public buildings, his forte was bridge design and he designed a number of notable bridges.  Later life  Brady retired at the end of January 1922, being forced to do so by an age restriction within the Queensland Public Service (his 66th birthday was 1 February 1922). Brady died on 31 May 1932 in Sydney after a long illness.

He gained recognition in 2009 after his audition for MTV's Making His Band impressed executive producer Sean Combs and landed him a spot on the show as the only \\"non- traditional\\" instrumentalist. Since then, he has been featured on shows like Jimmy Kimmel Live! and The Mo'Nique Show, and has shared the stage with musicians like Stevie Wonder, Beyoncé and Jay-Z. In 2010, England performed at a private party for Michael Jordan. Jordan was so impressed with England's abilities that he offered him an endorsement deal with his shoe brand. In 2016, England performed at the Geffen Playhouse and attracted the attention of legendary music producer, Quincy Jones; he was subsequently signed to Jones's management company: Quincy Jones Productions. Life and career England was born and raised in Waukegan, Illinois, the home of Jack Benny, to parents Sylvia and Lee England Sr. He was first exposed to the violin at the age of 6 during a class demonstration of stringed instruments. When he first attempted to play however, he assumed his violin was broken because it didn't sound like the one shown to him in class and wanted to quit. At the request of his father, England continued to practice his instrument for just 15 minutes a day, despite his resistance. As England continued to practice, his initial reluctance to practice was overcome by a passion for learning and growing as a musician. In 2008, he furthered his studies by attending Southern Illinois University, where he earned three separate music degrees: a BA in Violin Performance, a BS in Music Education, and a BS in Audio Engineering. After graduating, he began teaching violin to elementary students in the Chicago Public Schools system. He quickly realized, however, that he wouldn't be able to inspire children to pursue their dreams if hadn't ever tried himself. At the age of 25, England left his teaching position in order to pursue a performance career in music. 2009–2016: Performance career After leaving his teaching role, England auditioned for the MTV's Making His Band, a talent show in which performers competed to be a part of a new band. His audition was so impressive that the production team actually changed the rules to allow \\"non-traditional\\" instruments to be considered. As a result, England was dubbed the \\"secret weapon\\" of the group. England capitalized on the success following Making His Band by appearing on shows like Jimmy Kimmel Live! and The Mo'Nique Show, performing in concert with stars like Stevie Wonder, Babyface, and K'Jon, and opening for rappers like Ludacris, Jermaine Dupri, and Akon. Additionally, he produced, composed, and starred in several BET commercials. While touring with RnB singer K'Jon, England found himself performing at a private party for Michael Jordan, Spike Lee, Russell Simmons, Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union in Dallas for the NBA's 2010 All-Star Weekend. Jordan was so impressed with the performance that he offered England an endorsement with his shoe brand. England became one of the first non-athletes to be sponsored by the brand. Following Jordan's endorsement, England became a popular entertainer for a variety of athletic events. He performed at shoe releases for Chris Paul and Dwyane Wade, camps for LeBron James, and halftime shows in 26 NBA arenas. Most notably, he was commissioned to compose music for, and star in, a Super Bowl XLVII commercial. In early 2016, England performed John Legend's \\"All of Me\\" at the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles for an audience that included George Lucas, Elton John, Lady Gaga, and Quincy Jones. After the show, Jones approached him to discuss working together. Following the meeting, Jones produced a showcase performance for England at the Geffen's Gil Cates Theatre. Subsequently, Jones signed England to his management company: Quincy Jones Productions. 2016–present: WWE performances On August 20, 2016, England appeared at WWE's NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn II and played the entrance theme of wrestler Shinsuke Nakamura, \\"The Rising Sun\\" by CFO$, as he made his ring entrance for the main event against reigning NXT Champion Samoa Joe. England also appeared on the April 4, 2017 episode of SmackDown Live for Nakamura's main roster debut.

It is similar to other hammer orchids in that it is pollinated by a single species of male thynnid wasp using sexual deception. The orchid's labellum is similar in shape and scent to a flightless female thynnid wasp. It has a single silvery-grey, heart-shaped leaf with prominent green veins and a stem up to long. The species is only known from a scattered populations in the south west of the state and has been declared \\"vulnerable\\" by the Australian government and \\"threatened\\" by the government of Western Australia.  Description  Drakaea micrantha is similar to others in the genus in that it has a single, ground hugging leaf and an underground tuber. In this case, the leaf is heart shaped, about in diameter, silvery-grey dark green and rather glossy with darker green veins radiating from the leaf attachment. The stem is long and the stalk of the single flower is long. Its flower is also similar to those of other hammer orchids in that the labellum resembles a flightless female thynnid wasp however it can be distinguished by having a spine on the column, and a labellum with a straight end and a narrow \\"neck\\". The sepal at the back of the flower is long and the two at the sides are . The petals are also long. The insect-like labellum has a head about half as long as the body and is hairy for at least half its length. The \\"body\\" of the labellum is dark-coloured, slightly swollen and has a few hairs. Flowers appear in September and October.  Taxonomy and naming  Drakaea micrantha was first formally described by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown in 2007. Their description was published in Australian Systematic Botany. The specific epithet (micrantha) is derived from the Ancient Greek μικρός (mikrós) meaning \\"small\\" or \\"little\\" and ἄνθος (ánthos) meaning \\"flower\\", referring to the flower of this species being the smallest of the genus.  Distribution and habitat  The dwarf hammer orchid occurs at Perth, Augusta and Porongurup National Park It grows in bare sand in woodland, often near Kunzea glabrescens thickets.  Conservation  Drakaea micrantha is known from 32 small, scattered populations and the total population of mature plants was estimated in 2007 to be about 514. The Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife classifies the species as \\"threatened\\" meaning that it is considered likely to become extinct, or rare and in need of special protection. The Australian Government lists its status under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act as \\"vulnerable\\". The main threat to the species' survival is fire during its growing and flowering stages between June and early October.

He participated in the founding of the city of Córdoba by Jerónimo Luis de Cabrera. Biography He was born in Ayamonte, Huelva (Spain), the son of Alonso González Jaimes and Marina Sánchez, belonging to a noble family originally from Andalusia. Jaimes had an active participation in the Spanish Conquest of the Americas. He possibly arrived in Peru around the year 1540. In 1547, he had participated in the Battle of Huarina, under the command of General Diego Centeno against the hosts of Gonzalo Pizarro. He accompanied Pedro de Valdivia in the Conquest of Chile and participated with great value in the Arauco War. Bartolomé Jaimes also participated of the Conquest of Tucumán, and attended the foundation of Santiago del Estero by Francisco de Aguirre in 1553, and of Córdoba by Jerónimo Luis de Cabrera. He served as Alcalde of Córdoba in 1581, and was elect as Regidor of the Cabildo in 1575, 1577, 1579 and 1584. His last prominent public post, was as Fiel Ejecutor in 1590 and 1599. On May 17, 1579, Bartolomé Jaimes received land grants in Córdoba, including the village of Ansenuza, and Caroya, where he requested permission to establish a cattle ranch. He made his will on the same day of his death, on November 14, 1603, being buried in the Iglesia Mayor de Córdoba.  Family  Bartolomé Jaimes was married four times to native women of South America. His wives Catalina and Ana, were Mapuche, and Isabel, born in Catamarca was of Diaguita origin. His last wife was Luisa Martín, a mixed Indian, daughter of Alonso Martín del Arroyo, a Spanish politician, who served as Procurador of Santiago del Estero. His descendant, Antonio Jaimes (born in Córdoba) was the founder of the Jaime family in Buenos Aires. In 1692, he was married in the Buenos Aires Cathedral to María de la Rosa Fernández, born in Buenos Aires. His son, Juan Jaimes Fernández was married to Juana Chiclana Navarro, daughter of Diego Chiclana (soldier) and Luisa Navarro Estebáñez de Cevallos, belonging to a noble family from Buenos Aires of Basque origin (related to Coutinho de Mendoza). Antonio Jaimes served as soldier of the Presidio de Buenos Aires in 1690s and 1710s. He was possibly the great-grandson of Juan Maldonado and Lucía González Jaimes Díaz (daughter of Bartolomé Jaimes). His granddaughter, Josepha Lucía Jaimes Chiclana was married to Joseph Antonio Roberto. This family (Roberto Jaimes) was related to numerous Argentinean families, including the family of Casimiro Alegre, alcalde and Captain of Militias of San Vicente, Buenos Aires. His most renowned descendant (non-direct line) was Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, President of the Argentine Republic between 1868 and 1864. The surname Jaimes or Jaime is originally from Aragon. Ancient sources indicated that the surname came from the knight Ruiz Perez de Jaimes (descendant of James I of Aragon), who had participated in the Granada War.

Amphidiploid offspring from it, and from other roses with the same parentage, have been given the species name Rosa kordesii. Rosa kordesii, or Rosa × kordesii is a red type of rose that arose naturally from hybridization followed by chromosome doubling. A hybrid between R. rugosa and R. wichurana was created called Rosa 'Max Graf', but it was diploid and nearly sterile, producing flowers but no fruit. This rose produced a few viable seeds as a result of self-pollination, and the seedlings that resulted were tetraploid instead of diploid, i.e., the chromosomes of both pollen and egg cells had been naturally duplicated. The tetraploid seedlings are amphidiploids. page 176 A selection with double deep pink flowers and repeat bloom, also called 'K01 AgCan' was released by W. Kordes' Söhne in 1951. These tetraploid roses interbreed readily with one another, but not with their diploid ancestors. Under the biological species concept, a new species name Rosa kordesii was created for the tetraploid hybrid roses and their descendants. Amphidiploid roses can also be created deliberately from diploid-diploid hybrids by using colchicine spray on the growing tips of the plants. That strategy gives few successes, however, because the plant tissue has various chromosome numbers in different cells. Amphidiploid roses including Rosa kordesii have been used to some degree in breeding programs in combination with naturally occurring tetraploid roses.  Uses  Rosa kordesii petal extract gel is stable for at least 3–4 months when stored at 5 and 25 °C. It is essential for collection of similar data for different plants and their flowers, as well as other parts.

LaPlante (born May 16, 1970) is an American convicted murderer serving multiple life sentences for the 1987 murders of Priscilla Gustafson and her two children in Townsend, Massachusetts.  Early life  LaPlante lived with his mother and stepfather. While growing up in Townsend, LaPlante was sexually and psychologically abused by many adults in his life. LaPlante's father was responsible for the majority of the abuse. He also struggled with school. He was diagnosed with dyslexia at an early age, and his classmates called him “creepy and weird”. As a teenager he was referred to a psychiatrist because of his abnormal behavior, his appearance, and his lack of hygiene.  Criminal activities  As a teenager, LaPlante spent his evenings breaking into homes and taking the owners' possessions. He would sometimes move items around in the victims' homes to show that someone had been there without making it bluntly obvious. In 1986, LaPlante obtained a phone number and address that he thought belonged to one of his previous burglary victims. The house in fact belonged to a family of three, Brian Andrews and his two daughters, Annie and Jessica. The daughters were both around the same age as LaPlante. LaPlante began to stalk the daughters. Annie and Jessica assumed that a friend of theirs gave LaPlante their number. During several phone calls from LaPlante, Annie agreed to go out with him. The date did not go well, and they did not go out on a second date. But LaPlante learned that the girls had recently lost their mother to cancer, and he took great interest in hearing about the death. LaPlante subsequently snuck into the Andrews home, found a crawl space and lived in the walls for two months, tormenting the girls with tapping sounds and mysterious writing on the walls. Eventually, the father encountered LaPlante in Annie's room wearing a dress and wig and carrying a hatchet, with which he attempted to attack Andrews. The police investigated and found LaPlante, who was arrested and charged with several crimes. Afterwards, LaPlante was placed in a juvenile facility, where he stayed until October 1987. The following month, LaPlante returned to burglary, stealing two handguns from a neighbor's house. On December 1, 1987, LaPlante entered the Townsend home of Priscilla Gustafson, a nursery school teacher. Gustafson, who was pregnant, was found face-down on her bed, her pillows covered in her blood. LaPlante had raped her and shot her multiple times at point-blank range. LaPlante drowned both of her children in separate bathrooms. A few towns over from Townsend, LaPlante kidnapped a woman in her car, though the woman was able to escape. LaPlante was discovered hiding in a dumpster two days later. The police took him in and inspected his clothing. They found a hair on his sock that was a match for Abigail Gustafson, Priscilla's daughter. A year later, LaPlante was sentenced to three life sentences for the murders of the Gustafsons. On March 22, 2017, a re-sentencing hearing for LaPlante was held at Middlesex Superior Court in Woburn, Massachusetts. LaPlante asked for a reduction in his sentence. At the hearing, it was mentioned that during his first appeal, previous court rulings were cited saying that juveniles convicted of murder should be given a meaningful opportunity to re-engage with society. There was also a new law allowing “juveniles convicted of murder with extreme cruelty and atrocity to ask for parole after they’ve been behind bars for a minimum of 30 years.” The judge, however, gave LaPlante the maximum penalty of 45 years after a forensic psychiatrist evaluated LaPlante and found that he was not remorseful for his crimes.

In September 1854, he returned to the United States and enrolled at Thetford Academy in Vermont, where he graduated in 1856. He then returned to Liberia where he taught school to Africans of former American slaves. He left Africa around the start of the American Civil War in 1861, first moving to Liverpool and London, England, and then to the United States. Civil War During the upcoming of the civil war Chester served as a recruiter of black troops and raised the 54th and 55th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment. Later, he led two Black emergency militia regiments to defend a potential attack of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania during the famous Gettysburg Campaign in June–July 1863, the first time that Pennsylvania had issued weapons to African Americans. From August 1864 to the end of the Civil War in May 1865, Chester worked as a war correspondent for The Philadelphia Press, which was a major daily newspaper at that time. Europe When the civil war ended, he toured Europe.

The image intensifier can shutter to 20 nanoseconds and has a spectral response between 180 nm to 800 nm. It is part of the Photron FASTCAM line of cameras, introduced in 1998. Overview and features The FASTCAM SPECTRA native resolution is 256 x 256 pixels x 8 bits at 4,500 FPS. By reducing the resolution, the frame rate for recording can be increased. As an example, 40,500 FPS is achieved with a resolution of 64 x 64 pixels at 8 bits. The FASTCAM SPECTRA processor came with three memory configurations that allowed full frame storage of 8192 images (512 MB), 16,384 images (1GB) or 24,576 images (1.5 GB). At 4,500 fps and maximum memory, the recording time is 5.46 seconds. The SPECTRA image sensor reads images in blocks which is commonly called a Block Readout sensor. The image sensor is divided into 16 blocks where each block is 256 x 16 pixels. And within one block, one half to one fourth of the block can be partially read out. Digital image data could be read from the Processor through a SCSI interface. Live video images could be displayed on NTSC or PAL monitors. Ancillary information would be display as OSD (On-Screen-Data). The camera cable could be up to 5m from the Processor. The system could be controlled from a computer through an RS-232 interface sending simple ASCII commands. The FASTCAM SPECTRA has been used in ballistic studies, combustion studies, flow visualization studies such as aerosol dispersion and many other high-speed camera applications. Photron manufactured various version of this high-speed camera system without an intensifier(Photron Rabbit, Kodak HS4540, Photron SE and the Photron FASTCAM Ultima 40K all using the same image sensor) from 1990 to 2006.

It is what makes customer-care service efficient and enterprising. Generally, help desk software is part of an umbrella category called the service desk, which includes asset management and IT service management. Oftentimes, the two terms are used interchangeably. Nevertheless, help desk software specifically refers to the system that addresses customer queries. History The history of help desk software dates back to the 20th century when businesses relied mostly on face-to-face interaction to resolve customer issues. Customers had to visit a company’s store or office with the product to get their problems solved. With the invention of the telephone in 1876, and the telephone switchboard in the 1890s, the help desk assumed a better approach. Customers were able to reach their company and voice out their problem over the phone system. During the 20th-century era, companies used mainly equipment like dictation machines, typewriters, and dumb terminals with access to a mainframe computer, to address customer issues. The earliest use of computers for customer service was done through the use of mainframe software. Customers would submit paper forms or communicate their issue by phone to customer service agents who would seek for avenues to handle the issues. In the 1960s, companies began to set up call centers and also train staff to receive and handle customer inquiries in an organized and efficient manner. This was the era of Interactive voice response (IVR) which became a big boost to telephone customer service system. Later on, Desktop PCs and email significantly improved help desk systems. Customers could communicate their problems by email, bypassing paper forms. Help desk agents could provide status updates and resolutions by email as well. Meanwhile, the actual introduction of help desk systems began in 1980 when the internet was officially made available for public use. Many companies started outsourcing their customer service department. This led to the massive use of email and live chat systems in the 1990s. This new development enabled several US companies to outsource their help desk to low-cost countries like India and the Philippines. In any case, the real invention of help desk software came in the 2000s when companies began to use diverse kinds of software packages to deal with customer-care issues. This led to the massive production of different kinds of help desk software programs across the internet and the world at large. In recent times, the internet and networked systems make help desk software more interactive and participatory for customers and the agents. Customer can now submit and track their issues more easily. Customer service and help desk software systems have become increasingly popular in recent times. According to a recent report, there is a massive increase in sales of customer relationship management (CRM) software, which includes help desk software across the globe. Basic characteristics Help desk software automates customer services in diverse ways. It typically consists of at least three parts. These include Ticket Management, Automation Suite, and Reporting/Optimization. Help desk software has a point of contact for customers to send their queries and a ticketing system that tracks and organizes issues for faster resolution. It may also have a feature that aggregates and organizes queries and answers into a knowledge base, such as FAQs or guide articles. It may accommodate multiple points of contact; a working dashboard; and analytics section. It may also have a feature that allows agents to escalate issues to a higher level. More advanced help desk applications feature online chat, insights and analytics, automated processes, multiple contact channels, reporting tools, collaboration tools, and a CRM feature. Benefits The following benefits are typically associated with help desk software: * Any business that uses webmail for support tends to resolve customer support issues quicker and sees an increase in support productivity when they switch to help desk software. * Help desk software automates tasks such as: ticket categorization and prioritization, ticket routing, alerts and notifications, ticket status management, and so on. With the right help desk solution, the workload is cut down as many tasks such as issue tracking, assigning, and ticket management can be automated. * Some cloud-based help desk software has built-in security features, such as HIPAA compliance if for handling US health care information, or GDPR compliance for accepting requests from persons located in the European Union. Disadvantages There are some disadvantages related to help desk software as well, mainly: * Many help desk software platforms have expensive upfront costs as well as time-consuming implementation periods, which can significantly drain company resources. While most offer a trial option, effectively trialing software is difficult and time-consuming in a large organization. It's also difficult to evaluate the software with a full volume of tickets and staff in a short period of time. * On-premises help desks can have costs associated with maintenance, upgrades and scheduled downtime of servers, which are borne by the customer, not the help desk software provider. * Cloud-based help desks can incur higher costs over longer periods of time. Cloud-based help desk software can become partially or entirely unavailable to users without an Internet connection. Consequently, unexpected disruptions in Internet connection may make such services temporarily unavailable.

The Old Fortress is a successor building to a medieval fort built by the city of Pisa in the location of an older keep built by Countess Matilda of Tuscany in the 11th century. The 11th century tower was incorporated inside the fort built by the Pisans. The castle has been described as a \\"symbol of Medicean Livorno\\". The fort is located at the Medicean Darsena, or old dock of the port of Livorno, built by the Medici family. The ceremony proclaiming Livorno a city took place inside the fortress on 19 March 1606. History The plans to build the castle started with Cosimo I de' Medici in 1519 and the completion of the structure happened under the rule of Alessandro de' Medici in 1534. According to one source, the castle was built between 1521 and 1534 by Antonio da Sangallo the Elder. Antonio da Sangallo the Younger is also reported by another source as the builder. The fortress contains the remains of the older fort built by Pisa and the 11th century tower constructed by Matilda. Matilda's tower, known in Italian as Mastio di Matilde, or Mastio della Contessa Matilde, has been restored. The castle built by the Pisans in 1377 is called Quadratura dei Pisani and is believed to have been built by Puccio di Landuccio. The fortress church is dedicated to San Francesco. The old castle also contains the ruins of an ancient Roman castrum. The old fortress has three bastions and two main gates. The bastion closest to the land is called Ampolletta, the bastion nearest to the port is the Canaviglia and the third bastion, the Capitana, is at the northeastern side of the fort. On 24 April 1589, Christine of Lorraine arrived in Livorno from the sea as part of the celebrations of her wedding to Ferdinand I of Tuscany and came ashore landing at Fortezza Vecchia through the use of a drawbridge. On 19 March 1606 Ferdinando I proclaimed Livorno a \\"city\\" in a ceremony which took place inside the fortress. The population of the city at the time was 3,000 inhabitants. Fortezza Nuova The Caraviglia bastion with the tower of Matilda on the left Decades after the construction of the old fort, Livorno's fortifications were further enhanced by building a new fortress. The new fortress was named Fortezza Nuova or New Fort. A canal system was built to connect the two forts. The builders of the canals were either Venetian or residents of Livorno. In modern times, boats of the Italian Coast Guard and customs police use a marina located in the main canal between the two forts. Prior to building a paved bridge to the castle from the mainland, the fort was surrounded by the sea and was accessible via a pontoon bridge. The old fortress is the more significant of the two castles, while Fortezza Nuova has been described as the \\"larger and more interesting\\" of the two forts. In the 19th century the fort became a prison which during the Risorgimento also kept Italian political prisoners including Francesco Domenico Guerrazzi and others.Information notice at the site of Fortezza Vecchia The old fortress sustained extensive damage in World War II but was subsequently repaired following the conflict. Scientific experiment Information notice at the site On 2 April 1662, an experiment designed to test Galileo's principle of the independence of motions, during projectile motion, was conducted at the old fortress. The experiment was carried out by members of the Accademia del Cimento. The experimental setup included two cannonballs, one used as a projectile from a cannon while the other was vertically suspended. The cannon was placed on Mastio di Matilde, the tower of the old fortress, To effect the simultaneous initiation of motion for the two cannonballs, one cannonball was fastened to a rope hanging through the muzzle opening of the cannon. When the cannon fired, the projected cannonball broke the suspension rope of the other, and the two cannonballs commenced their motion simultaneously. Due to experimental errors, the results, although close to Galileo's prediction, were deemed inconclusive by the academics.

Medway Day, was an English-born Australian journalist, Baptist minister and activist. He was born at Bedford to carver Samuel Day and Elizabeth Stamford. He worked for a local solicitor before studying for the Baptist ministry in the early 1860s. He migrated to South Australia in 1866, becoming the minister at Mount Gambier until 1869, when he moved to Kapunda. In 1870–71 he was the chair of the South Australian Baptist Association, but in 1875 he left the ministry to become a journalist for the Register. He was acting editor for the paper in 1883–84, attracting some controversy for his views on land nationalisation. He married Ellen Sandland on 12 August 1886; they had no children. From 1892 Day edited the Pioneer, the paper of the Single Tax League; then in 1893 edited his own short-lived weekly, The Voice. A strong reformist, he delivered many lectures on topics including land reform, women's suffrage, trade unionism and electoral politics. He ran unsuccessfully for the South Australian House of Assembly seat of Gumeracha in 1893, and later in the year a loose coalition had coalesced around him, the \\"Forward Movement\\", which included members from a wide variety of progressive causes. In January 1894 Day moved to Sydney to edit the Australian Worker, and thus was involved in the formation of the Australian Workers' Union. He ran for Labor Party preselection for the 1895 colonial election; losing endorsement for Grenfell to William Holman, he instead contested Gundagai but was defeated (Holman also lost). He was widowed in 1894, and on 8 September 1897 married Marcella Mary Carr, also widowed. In 1904 he moved to Hobart to edit the Tasmanian Mail, but he died the following year having suffered an intestinal obstruction.

Plot Coronel Rivas (Alfredo Mayo) was a daring pilot in the Spanish Civil War. He marries the sister (Lina Rosales) of a friend (Julio Núñez) in an air force unit. Both had flown for the Nationalist side. During the war, Rivas had stolen a Republican aircraft, but was shot down by his friend. After surviving the attack, in the 1950s, Rivas eventually becomes the commander of a search and rescue service. When an aircraft from his air rescue squadron crashes during landing, an investigation begins. Complications from a blackmail attempt threaten to involve more than just the commander. In the end, the fear of being exposed for his role in the scandal that could destroy his entire family, leads Rivas to rescue terrified passengers aboard a doomed airliner.

Education  Born in Hawthorn, Victoria Teague attended Ruyton's Girls' School, Kew, from 1912 to 1923 and was awarded dux of her year. Teague started her architectural education at Swinburne Technical College from 1924 to 1927. She then completed her studies at the University of Melbourne Architectural Atelier and was the only one to receive honours in her first year in 1928. Graduating in 1930 she was awarded the Grice Bronze Medal ahead of her peers, including highly regarded Alan Ralton. After her father paid her first year fees, Teague self supported herself through the subsequent years of training by winning scholarships.  Career = Architectural practice  Whilst studying at Swinburne she was also articled to her family's firm Purchas & Teague and later joined George E. Nichterlein's office whilst studying at the University of Melbourne. At Nichterlein's, Teague completed several residences and the drawings for St John's Lutheran Church, South Melbourne, which she later reflected on in a short article entitled 'Modernism'. Upon graduating Teague went to work for F. Keith Cheetham whose portfolio was overtaken by Edward Fielder Billson when Cheetham became ill in 1931. During this time she worked on office detailing, and designing and documenting flats and houses until Roy Grounds suggested that Teague apply for the recently vacated chief draftsperson's position at Oakley & Parkes. She commenced the role in 1934, soon becoming a senior draftsperson and in 1938 was promoted to the chief designer at Oakley & Parkes, where she designed and documented office buildings, flats, houses and factories. When WWII broke out, fellow architect Mary Turner Shaw encouraged Teague to support the war effort by joining the Commonwealth Department of Works (CDW). Initially her role was in munitions designing bomb and shell-filling factories at Maribynong, Victoria and later shifted to designing and documenting pyrotechnics plants in Mulwala, NSW. In 1943 she moved to the Department of Works Post Office section designing and upgrading post offices and telephone exchanges for regional Australian towns as well as the new Brisbane GPO and the Redfern Mail Exchange. During this time she was also involved in Postwar construction including preliminary design work on the new City of Darwin and Commonwealth offices for Sydney and Melbourne. After working on larger projects Teague joined the team for major projects and was largely responsible for the original designs of the Braddon Flats and an earlier iteration of the National Library, both in Canberra, and the Commonwealth Offices in Melbourne. She later worked on the Lismore and Sydney, Commonwealth Offices, and subsequently remarked that she enjoyed the complexity of office building design. By 1959 Teague was promoted to Supervising Architect and became the Superintending Architect in 1960. In the same year she was seconded to a post overseeing work in Delhi, Myanmar and Malaysia with the Department of External Affairs. In 1964, Teague was promoted again into the role of Assistant Director General in the Commonwealth Department of works. From this position she was the first Australian woman elevated to the Second Division of the Public Service. In this role she worked on schools and housing in Darwin, the restoration of Custom's House, Melbourne, and the Springvale Hostel, and several other immigrant hotels, across Victoria.  Advocacy  In 1939, Teague was on Australian Institute of Architect's exhibition committee for an architectural display at the Home and Buildings Exhibition, which she later profiled in an article for the Journal of the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects. After WWII when it was announced that female public servants would be returned to a lower rate of pay (after having parity with the men during the war) Teague and her colleagues strongly advocated against the changes without success.  Writing and teaching  In addition to lecturing at the Melbourne Technical College in Architectural Interior Design, from 1948 to 1950 Teague was the Honorary Editor of the RVIA Quarterly Bulletin.

This designation resulted from the efforts of both Israeli and German architectural historians, beginning in the 1980s, to document the history of the architecture. Preservation and restoration of these buildings, many of which were neglected due to the economy or insensitive additions, are underway, and eight of them have been designated as landmarks. Along with other 1930's Israeli architects, Shulman's work was documented in book form in 1994 by German photographer Irmel Kamp-Bandeau Kamp-Bandeau (1994), pp.220-25, 245 and in 2004 by Israeli architect, historian and preservationist Nitza Metzger-Szmuk. Shulman and his work are included in the international traveling exhibition based on her book Dwelling On The Dunes: Tel Aviv Modern Movement and Bauhaus Ideals. > Positive/negative elements, such as rounded volumes or recessed prisms in > the essentially flat facades were a specialty of Ben-Ami Shulman who > designed buildings with a freedom reminiscent of plasticine > modeling.Metzger-Szmuk (2004), p.357 Life and career Shulman was among several Israeli architects of his time, including Genia Averbuch and Dov Karmi, who studied architecture in Brussels, Belgium and whose work, according to Nitza Metzger-Szmuk, demonstrates an unusual range of creativityMetzger-Szmuk (2004), p.49 when compared to architects trained at the Bauhaus or other schools. He studied under Victor Horta at the Academie Royale des Beaux-Arts, graduating in 1931 with a degree with honors in architecture and engineering. Horta's influence on Shulman has been identified by the extensive use of paneled glass walls on the facade of his 1938 Gruzenberg (Rosenberg) StreetKamp-Bandeau (1994), pp.220-23 commercial building which was unusual in Tel Aviv at that time. Shulman designed the Zeire Zion pavilion for the Jewish National Fund exhibition in Brussels before returning to Tel Aviv, where he practiced residential and commercial architecture from 1931 to 1947.Kamp-Bandeau (1994), pp.220-23, 245 Shulman's innovative design for an apartment building at 3 Mapu Street in 1937 became the focus of an unusual coalition of prominent architects of the time who supported his efforts to fight the city's municipal building department, who had rejected the plan for the building. Shulman's skillful creation of a \\"cubist and precise\\" sense of monumentality for a modest building was noted by architect/planner Nahoum Cohen in Bauhaus Tel Aviv: An Architectural Guide. Although it had deteriorated over the years, it was restored in 2012 by architect and conservationist Mimar Naor, and commemorated with a plaque highlighting its originality. Views of the restoration are included in a new book Preservation and Renewal- Bauhaus and International Style Buildings in Tel Aviv published by Bauhaus Center Tel Aviv. The political and economic difficulties of 1947 led Shulman and other architects to emigrate in search of work. Shulman moved to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, where he practiced residential and commercial architecture until 1960, when he moved to Los Angeles. There, he set up a practice with his son, architect Uzi Shulman, also a graduate of the Academie Royale des Beaux-Arts. Ben-Ami Shulman adapted his modernism to the diversity of Southern California mid-century styles of architecture. Shulman visited Israel frequently after his emigration, but did not try to promote his 1930's Tel Aviv architecture. He died in 1986. A few years later his son Uzi was contacted by architectural historians about his father's Tel Aviv work. Shulman's Tel Aviv period and his Los Angeles work were the subject of a 2015 exhibition, Some Shulman Architecture, at the American Institute of Architects Los Angeles chapter.

She was \\"one of the leading figures in the movement known as 'international mail art'\\". She is credited with coining the term \\"femail art\\" that was taken up by other mail artists around the world. Life  Born 8 July 1936 in Leytonstone, Essex Patricia Florence Larter (Née Holmes) the elder of two daughters Pat and her family lived at Canvey Island. Her father died of TB when she was young and her wages were needed to support the family. Pat met her long time collaborator and husband Richard Larter at Perfect Lambert & Co where they were both employed. They married on 18 February 1953 when Pat was just sixteen and migrated to Australia in 1962. They had five children Lorraine, Nicholas, Derek, Diane and Eliza. Settling in Luddenham, New South Wales the Larter's stayed until 1982 when they moved to Yass, New South Wales. Pat died on 6 October 1996, an untimely death from cancer.

The pair also produced many collaborative super-8 films and prints.\\" Their individual work shares themes and motifs.

It is part of the Photron FASTCAM line of cameras, introduced in 1996. Photron Kodak Motioncorder was introduce in 1996. The camera was manufacture by Photron but trade branded as a KODAK MASD product. The Kodak Motioncorder and the Photron FASTCAM Super 10K Motioncorder are the same camera, just different trade names. Overview and features The Kodak Motioncorder native resolution is 512 x 480 pixels x 8 bits at 250 FPS. By reducing the resolution, the frame rate for recording can be increased. As an example, 1000 FPS is achieved with a resolution of 256 x 240 pixels at 8 bits. The 10,000 FPS requires the resolution be reduced to 128 x 34 pixels at 8 bits. The Kodak Motioncorder came with three different memory storages capabilities. The Processor could hold either 128 MB, 384 MB or 512 MB. With the maximum memory, the camera can record 2,184 images or 8.73 seconds of record time at 250 FPS. Digital image data could be read from the Processor through a SCSI interface. Live video images could be displayed on NTSC or PAL monitors. Ancillary information would be display as OSD (On-Screen-Data). The camera cable could be up to 16m from the Processor. The system could be controlled from a computer through an RS-232 interface sending simple ASCII commands. The Kodak Motioncorder has been used in many diverse applications such as production line troubleshooting, packaging machine design and university research. It has been verified by the manufacture that over 4000 Motioncorders/Super 10K cameras were produced from 1996 to 2005. Another popular High-speed camera from this era was the Redlake Motionscope. Both products used the same CCD sensor (7.4 um pixel. The Kodak Motioncorder could record 250 FPS while the Redlake Motionscope could record 240 fps. These two products ushered in a new class of cameras which were low cost with relatively high speed image capture that was not previously available.

Construction and design  After obtained the blue riband, Norddeutscher Lloyd (Burdigala's first owner) had hoped to strengthen and secure its success by the deployment of SS Kaiser Friedrich, which the company was building in the yard of Ferdinand Schichau in Danzig. NDL's optimism and confidence for a successful future could not be hidden, as indicated by an eight-page brochure printed in April 1898, stating that \\"The Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse, will be assisted by an even more gigantic ship, the Kaiser Friedrich, which is expected to be even faster\\". The main concern of the Schichau shipyard was to build a ship which would be slightly smaller than a ship built by the A.G. Vulcan, the Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse and certainly much cheaper. At the same time the newbuild should be able to meet the demands posed by the NDL contract which mandated that the test speed of the vessel should be 22.5 knots for a period of six hours and that the guaranteed minimum speed be of 21 knots so that during thus ensuring that the transatlantic crossing would not exceed six days. German Emperor Friedrich III According to these specifications the Kaiser Friedrich was designed and built with three chimneys (smoke stacks) designated as the number 587 build with the following technical characteristics: length , width , tonnage and a displacement of 20,100 tons. Fitted with two five cylinder reciprocating steam engines (with cylinder diameter of 109.22 cm, 162.56 cm, 233.68 cm, 2 x 236.22 cm), with quadruple expansion, driving twin three-bladed bronze propellers,with a diameter of 6.19 meters, coupled to crankshafts made by Krupp Steel, the best steel in Germany. The engines were designed to develop a maximum nominal 28,000 horse power and in conjunction with the fact that the pressure in the ten boilers were rated at 15.5 bar, offered, according to the calculations by the Ferdinand Schichau engineers, a significant potential for coal economy. Contrary to common shipbuilding practices of the era, the engineers placed the engines slightly forward, between the second and third boilers. The ship had nine main boilers, each fitted with two coal loading trap doors plus a tenth auxiliary boiler; these were positioned in three watertight compartments each ducted to a smokestack. By the end of her completion, the SS Kaiser Friedrich had cost £525,000, surpassing by far the initial budgeted cost. Once concluded though, she was a pure example of shipbuilding magnificence with her beautiful line, low freeboard, an unusually long forecastle, a curvilinear bridge, large promenade deck and a feature very characteristic of the German shipbuilding at the time- an exceptionally high poop. In addition to the features above, Kaiser Friedrich as well as other steamers of her time, were designed and constructed to operate as commercial armed cruiser in the event of war, as defined by German law, which meant that their exterior had to exude a solid sound effect. It is no coincidence that all those who reported on this particular ship in the future, always spoke with the best words about her external characteristics and her shipbuilding form.  A floating palace  Although in terms of the technical characteristics the Kaiser Friedrich was inferior to the , in terms of interior design and lavishness she was a lot more sophisticated, with a harmonious blend of high quality and good taste. All the 180 first-class and 111 second-class cabins were placed on higher decks, offering their occupants remarkable views. Some of the first-class cabins were also convertible into large seating areas. In addition to the 420 crew, the ship could accommodate 1,350 passengers out of which 400 in first class, 250 in second and 700 passengers in third-class. Like the most sumptuous transatlantic ships of her time, the Kaiser Friedrichs main dining and living rooms were lit by extravagant Chandeliers and the surrounding walls dominated by the hanging Caryatids representing the art and sciences and decorated with painted panels portraying Kaiser Friedrich III's family and their respective coat of arms. The walls were painted in a shade of ivory, adorned by gold ornaments, while the carpets were all red. The most prominent feature though was the ship's promenade deck, especially in the first class areas where the deck was open so as not to obstruct the view and extended along the highest point of the ship's admit for 100 meters. The ship was also equipped with smoking lounges, bars, music room and a library.  Short maiden voyage  The construction work was completed in May 1898 and the Kaiser Friedrich embarked on its maiden voyage on 12 May 1898 from Danzig to Bremerhaven, the home port of Norddeutscher Lloyd. During the sea trials, the engineers of NDL, which were present on board, discovered with disappointment that even with the greatest of efforts she could only reach the speed of 20 knots and by no means exceed it. Upon the ship's arrival at the port and due to its poor performance with respect to the low speed she had achieved during the trials, the NDL categorically denied receiving the ship, adhering strictly to the explicit terms of the contract. Only after F. Schichau had confirmed that he would significantly improve the ship's speed and performance did the NDL agree to include the Kaiser Friedrich in its fleet, planning its first transatlantic voyage from Bremerhaven to Southampton and from there onward to New York City.  Improvements  Since both companies had titles of ownership of the ship, one can say with certainty that they were both interested in finding a solution for the speed problems. The fact that the larger share of ownership, 62% belonged to F. Schichau, which at that point was trying to penetrate the global shipping market, combined with the explicit terms of the contract that made the return of the NDL ship not only possible but also likely in case it deviated from the terms of agreement, brought F. Schichau in a rather difficult and defenseless position. In order to preserve the prestige of the company, it was essential that a solution should be found, a solution satisfactory to all. The first step involved sending the ship off to Southampton where it underwent some \\"structural adjustments\\" whose principal objective was to improve the speed. The ship remained for several days in the dry dock yards \\"Prince of Wales\\", during which time the length of its two propeller blades was shortened by 30 cm. On 1 June 1898 the ship sailed back to Bremerhaven.  Maiden voyage to New York  On 7 June 1898, the SS Kaiser Friedrich began its sea journey from Bremen to Southampton under the helm of an experienced NDL captain, Ludwig A. Störmer. The next day, on 8 June 1898, the ship's first transatlantic trip to New York City commenced, carrying 209 passengers in the first and second classes, and 183 in the third, of which the majority were immigrants. The journey had started off well, but very quickly the bad weather and a number of mechanical problems significantly reduced the speed of the ship. Afterwards, the left engine ceased operating for 20 hours and 26 minutes, shortly followed by the right engine, which stopped running for 11 hours and 42 minutes. Fortunately for the passengers and the crew, the engines halted separately, not simultaneously. The cause of mechanical problems was later considered by ship specialists to be overheating of bearings or as it was formally stated in The Marine Engineer Magazine \\"the failure of the slide valves to work smoothly and to the breakage of studs on the air pump brackets, so that a proper vacuum could not be maintained\\". The result was disastrous as it took 7 days, 10 hours and 15 minutes for the SS Kaiser Friedrich to cover the classic route from southampton to Sandy Hook, New York City, where it arrived on 16 June 1898. Another several hours of delay were added to its already poor time count, owing to the fact that the ship had to stay outside the New York City harbor and wait for entry allowance because of the mines that were placed to guard the harbour after the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in April 1898. The next day, the NDL hosted a press conference at the ship's foyer, which was attended by media representatives, shipbuilders, engineers and ship- owners. As publicized by The New York Times in an article dated 17 June 1898 and headlined \\"The Kaiser Friedrich – The Fine Big Steamship Makes Her Maiden Trip in Over Seven Days – Engines Easily Overheated\\", the average vessel speed during its first transatlantic crossing was 17.73 knots, pointing out that \\"nobody knows the actual maximum speed of the vessel\\", as the average speed had been lowered due to mechanical problems.  Return home and future voyages  On 25 June 1898, the SS Kaiser Friedrich set off on her return voyage, without passengers, which lasted 9 days, 2 hours and 30 minutes to Southampton. Given the very low average speed of 15 knots and a new set of mechanical problems which arose again during her return, the NDL cancelled Kaiser Friedrichs next two scheduled trips and the ship was sent to F. Schichau's shipyard in Danzig for repairs, always with the aim to improve her speed limit to exceed 20 and reach 22 knots. On 4 September 1898 the ship was given back to the NDL. On 14 September 1898, Kaiser Friedrich embarked on her second transatlantic trip from Southampton to New York City, where she arrived after 6 days and 12 hours on 21 September 1898, traveling at an average speed of 19–20 knots. The corrections made by F. Schicha's engineers slightly improved the ship's speed performance, but not enough to cover the most important term of the contract which had set the service speed of the ship at 22 knots. Over the next three journeys SS Kaiser Friedrich had sailed by the end of travel season in December 1898, the speed remained at these levels without significant change. In the winter of 1898–99 the ship remained for three months at Schichau's shipyard in Danzig for corrections and repairs, always with the aim to increase its service speed. In addition to installing new air pumps in the engine and boiler rooms, the three funnels were extended by 4.5 meters resulting in a noticeable change in appearance. With the start of the new season, the mended ship set off to its first transatlantic voyage in the year 1899, from Southampton to New York City on 5 March 1898. The crossing, which took 7 days and 40 minutes before reaching the Sandy Hook lighthouse, after the ship had lost two blades from its propellers, extinguished the last bit of hope that the ship with any new changes would ever approach the 22 knot threshold. Because the NDL did not own any other ship of Kaiser Friedrichs size, to cover the gap which Kaiser Friedrichs removal from their fleet would cause, and also because the NDL did not want to return a ship 38% owned by them to the manufacturers, they patiently decided they would give Schichau's engineers yet another chance to finally put it right. Eight more transatlantic trips followed, the shortest of which was 6 days, 22 hours and 30 minutes which finally and irrevocably classified the ship as belonging to the 19 knots class.  NDL's farewell  After all Norddeutscher Lloyd's patience had been worn off, on 27 June 1899, during the ship's return from New York City, the company returned SS Kaiser Friedrich back to its manufacturer on a formal ground that the ship did not cover the term of the contract which set its service speed at 22 knots. At the same time NDL ordered a new ship, bigger and faster but with the (tested) specifications same as those of SS Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse, by the A.G. Vulcan. The new ship was , which claimed and won the Blue Riband trophy two years later in 1902, reaching the average speed of 23.09 knots. Until the delivery of this new ship, which bore the name of Kaiser's Wilhelm II son, the NDL temporarily replaced the Kaiser Friedrich with the (former SS Spree), which sank in October 1904, during the Russian-Japanese War. Kaiser Wilhelm Der Grosse Immediately after the delivery of the new ship, a long legal battle between the NDL and the Schichau Company had begun, which ended in 1908 with Norddeutscher Lloyd's victory. The press of the time, from both sides of the Atlantic, was widely involved in this unprecedented event. The New York Times in their article dated 28 June 1899, captioned \\"Kaiser Friedrich Rejected\\", extensively analyses the underlying facts and causes. The general manager of F. Schichau, vigorously objected to the court decision, claiming that the culprit was the poor quality of coal used as fuel by the NDL. On 7 August 1899, he wrote a letter to the Chief Editor of the renowned magazine \\"The Marine Engineer\\", which reads: > Dear Sir, In your esteemed journal of 1 August, page 207, you write that the > KAISER FRIEDRICH has been withdrawn by the Norddeutscher Lloyd from service > and returned to her builders. This not being the fact, I request you kindly > to rectify it, in the next issue of your esteemed journal, according to the > following data: – The KAISER FRIEDRICH was the property of the firm of F. > Schichau, and in spite of her built as a high speed passenger steamer, > requiring a good quality of coal, the Norddeutscher Lloyd mostly gave her a > very inferior coal – besides, many of the stokers had no previous > experience. Under these circumstances it could not give surprise that the > KAISER FRIEDRICH was not able to develop her full speed, and there was no > other way for the firm of F. Schichau but to withdraw its steamer and give > her into other hands. The KAISER FRIEDRICH will make her next voyages under > the flag of the Hamburg America Line. Reiterating to you in advance my best > thanks for this rectification, I remain, dear Sir, Yours very respectfully > F. Schichau  Hamburg-America Line  The announcement by F. Schichau Shipyards that \\"the Kaiser Friedrich will make its next journeys under the flag of HAPAG (Hamburg America Line)\\" marked the beginning of the second chapter of later to be renamed SS Burdigala's history. In 1898 HAPAG had sold one of its oceangoing ships, the SS Normannia, to the Spanish government which was used as an Auxiliary cruiser by the name SS Patriota during the Spanish–American War. This sale created a gap in the company's transatlantic fleet at a time when business was thriving, as the second wave of mass immigration to America had reached its peak. Furthermore, because of the Spanish-American and the Second Anglo-Boer war in South Africa, a number of American and British ships had been pulled out of the North Atlantic route, creating in turn a considerable void in shipping. This shortage of ships became a tremendous opportunity for German and French maritime companies, ready to reap enormous profits by covering the gap. HAPAG was the first to try to exploit this opportunity, but the absence of SS Normannia had been evident given, that its three major ocean vessels could not satisfy the increased demand. In order to fill this gap, while waiting to add the into its fleet, HAPAG decided to charter SS Kaiser Friedrich from the Schichau Company and include it immediately in its express line connecting Hamburg to Southampton, Cherbourg and New York City. On 2 October 1899, SS Kaiser Friedrich embarked on its first transatlantic voyage under the HAPAG colors with a red flag and the City of Hamburg coat of arms on her bow, departing from Southampton for New York City. Towards the end of the journey, the ship went off course and ran aground near the coast of New Jersey but without damage. Soon after her return to Europe a second passage on the same route followed, which ended with the ship's homecoming to Southampton, on 16 November 1899. During the winter 1899/1900, Kaiser Friedrich remained in Hamburg where repairs were undertaken by the well-known shipyards of Blohm & Voss, mainly for increasing the number of cabin passengers, as well as its cargo capacity. At the start of the new travel season, on 30 March 1900, the ship set off from Southampton to New York City. This departure marked the beginning of the most stable and successful period of the liner's operating life, since HAPAG was not interested in breaking speed records and since taking delivery of SS Deutschland was soon expected, the speed of Kaiser Friedrich was deemed more than sufficient by the company.  Kaiser Friedrichs further career  Over the next seven months, the ship had completed eight full transatlantic trips (Europe-America and back), between Plymouth and New York City, out of which most of the eastbound crossings took less than 7 days to complete. Kaiser Friedrichs best performance was recorded during its journey back from New York City to Plymouth, in August 1900, which lasted 6 days and 11 hours. According to the press, Kaiser Friedrich seemed to have found her appropriate home fleet, as she was traveling at speed levels equal to those of HAPAG's other ocean liners, such as the , the and the , while offering a more luxurious and sophisticated stay. SS Kaiser Friedrich around 1900 On 30 June 1900, after her fourth passage, the ship arrived at the HAPAG quay at Hoboken, New Jersey, where the docks of Norddeutscher Lloyd were also located. Her arrival coincided with the great fire of Hoboken during which many of NDL's ships were destroyed, among them SS Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse, which was not completely burned but had suffered major damages. It was a tragic incident with many victims and enormous financial losses. During the fire, Kaiser Friedrich participated in several rescue operations rendering crucial assistance. The newspapers of the time, as well as the official shipping records, make explicit references about the heroism of her crew. In July 1900, the eagerly awaited SS Deutschland, built by the A.G. Vulcan shipyards, made its maiden voyage under the HAPAG flag from Hamburg to New York City. Within few months she had won the Blue Riband speed trophy, reaching an average speed of 23 knots, thus taking the lead away from NDL's SS Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse. HAPA's dynamic entry into the higher class of transatlantic shipping, also meant the termination of SS Kaiser Friedrichs charter. Although the F. Schichau company had hoped, that after her successful integration into the Hamburg America Line's fleet they would proceed with the ship's purchase, HAPAG had other plans and decided to expand its fleet by building new ships.  Hamburg-America Line's farewell  In October 1900, SS Kaiser Friedrich departed for her last transatlantic crossing from New York City to Hamburg where she arrived in November of that year; the ship was subsequently returned to her owner F. Schichau who in turn decommissioned her, remaining mothballed at the port of Hamburg for the next 12 years. Despite the fact that SS Kaiser Friedrich was a beautifully built ship, with a service speed perfectly satisfactory to meet the requirements of most shipping routes, the negative reputation which had been created around her name, as well as her failure to fulfill the purpose for which she had been built, caused her abandonment and eventually a misfortune that she most likely did not deserve. It was the first time -with the exception of the tragic first sailing and the subsequent ill fate of , that the possession of a ship of such class was considered by many as an \\"unnecessary luxury\\". There is no doubt that the failure of SS Kaiser Friedrich to meet the term of the contract with NDL, which explicitly required that the vessel would reach the speed of 22 knots, was detrimental to the image of F. Schichau shipyards. Although the Norddeutscher Lloyd had ordered the construction of five new ships of around 6,000 GRT from the company to cover the Australian and Far East Lines and perhaps with the aim to alleviate the tension caused by their legal battle, the first large order from HAPAG was placed only about 10 years after the Kaiser Friedrich, in 1908, who ordered a middle-class 16,300 GRT vessel named . Characteristic for the tarnished reputation and the financial damage caused by the failure of the Kaiser Friedrich is the fact that in a commemorative album called \\"Die Schichau-Werke in Elbing, Danzig und Pillau 1837–1912\\", which F. Schichau issued in 1912 to celebrate the company's 75th anniversary, there is no reference whatsoever about Kaiser Friedrich. Only after a couple of years in the company's history book did a small reference of the ship appear, under her new name SS Burdigala, as a memory of the F. Schichau's lost opportunity to truly play a part in the worldwide shipping  Inactive years and purchase by Sud-Atlantique  The SS Kaiser Friedrich remained mothballed in the harbor of Hamburg until 1910. This was a period when a newly formed Norwegian company, the Norwegian American Line (Norske Amerikalinje), was experiencing difficulties in trying to raise the initial capital essential for its establishment. The F. Schichau Company made a proposal to Norske to become a shareholder, promising to provide them with the capital they needed to survive, if they would agree to purchase the Kaiser Friedrich. The proposal was accepted and the agreement reached a point where Norske gave the ship the name of SS Leif Eriksson, in honor of the Icelandic explorer of the 10th century. Unfortunately for Schichau, at the last minute Norske decided not to purchase the Kaiser Friedrich, preferring to await the completion of ships they had already ordered. Two more years had passed before a solution was found, a solution that finally made Kaiser Friedrich active again. Her salvation was called Compagnie de Navigation Sud Atlantique and came from France in 1912, marking the beginning of the third period of the ship's history. In March and April 1912, Sud- Atlantique was indispensable to acquire a large, fast and impressive ship, which would reveal the aspirations of the company and stress its authority. They found all which had been looking for in the SS Kaiser Friedrich, which they purchased from the F. Schichau on 1 May 1912 for 4,000,000 French Francs, an amount considered to reflect one third of the ship's actual value. The ship was renamed SS Burdigala, in accordance with the practice of Sud-Atlantique to give its ships ancient Latin names such as Lutetia for Paris, Gallia for France and Burdigala for the city of Bordeaux, which was its base. According to maritime history expert Arnold Kludas, SS Burdigala was converted at the Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg. In addition to the changes done in the layout and allocation of lodging space, adjustments were also made to the basic ship systems, such as fitting of new boilers. Moreover, the ship was painted white with Sud- Atlantique's coat of arms decorating the funnels- a red cock, symbol of ancient Gaul, since the Latin name for the cock is the same as the name for Gaul, Gallus. The extensive repairs and upgrading of SS Kaiser Friedrich into SS Burdigala had taken longer than initially planned resulting in delayed delivery of the ship. Which was supposed to become operational on 22 September 1912. Realizing that under the circumstances Sud-Atlantique would not be able to fulfill the terms of the contract signed with the French Government, decided to charter the SS Atlantique from the Messageries Maritimes, with which the company finally managed to make its first scheduled trip on time. After completion of the restoration work, SS Burdigala sailed from Hamburg to Bordeaux, where she was welcomed with great enthusiasm, considering that she was the largest and fastest ship in service at the South Atlantic at the time. She would maintain this honorary title for a whole year. On 26 September 1912, the inclusion of SS Burdigala in the fleet of Cie de Navigation Sud-Atlantique was celebrated with a luxurious dinner on board. Nine days later on 5 October, Burdigala had set off on its first journey with Buenos Aires as its final destination, flying the flag of Sud-Atlantique on her mast.  Burdigalas further career  Although the trip had gone on uneventfully, during its return the ship experienced some mechanical problems which relusted to dry docking for additional repair work as soon as she had arrived in Bordeaux. For the time that the SS Burdigala had remained inactive, Cie Sud-Atlantique was forced to replace the ship with the SS La Gascogne, a ship they had chartered from the French Line. This fact combined with the Burdigalas enormous coal consumption, had led the Sud-Atlantique to the conclusion that the relation between the high operation cost of this lavish ship and the earnings derived was not profitable for the company. Nevertheless, Sud-Atlantique had to wait further until the delivery of the new ships they had ordered before being in a position to withdraw the cost-ineffective SS Burdigala from its fleet. On 10 November 1912, SS Burdigala embarked on her second trip. This time she had managed to remain on track without any major problems, apart from grounding in a sandy shore of the river Garonne at the port of Bordeaux, following the dragging of the ship's anchors. Over the short period of time that Burdigala served the southern Atlantic line, she evolved into a rather distinguishing persona of maritime communications between mainland France and South America. Until this day, one can find post cards of Sud-Atlantique with the ship's photograph in many private collections that the emigrants were sending to their home countries to let their families know that they had arrived safely at their destination. On some of these photos, Burdigala is shown with its hull painted white, which coincided with the ship's \\"white period\\", a phase when she had first begun her career under the ownership of Cie Sud-Atlantique; on other photos the hull is painted black with a white strip around the gunwale. The latter refers to the second half of the year 1913, when the decision was made for all Cie Sud-Atlatique's vessels to be painted in this way. On 1 November 1913, SS Burdigala was decommissioned and she remained mothballed yet again at the port of Bordeaux until the breakout of the First World War.  World War I  Immediately after the start of the First World War and the general mobilization, which France declared on 3 August 1914, many ships of the merchant fleet were commandeered by the French government. Among them were also ships of Compagnie de Navigation Sud-Atlantique. SS Burdigala was called for war service on 18 August 1914 The French government initially used Burdigala as a simple troop carrier in service from the French Mediterranean city of Toulon to the Dardanelles and to Thessaloniki port in northern Greece. In December 1915 Burdigala was designated as an auxiliary cruiser and equipped with Q.F. Firearms and four 140 mm caliber (5.5 inches) cannons, which were placed in pairs, at the bow and stern. With the commandeering of SS Burdigala begins the fourth and last period of the history of the ship. The problems faced by the previous owners, namely the companies Norddeutscher Lloyd and Compagnie de Navigation Sud-Atlantique, primarily among these being the heavy consumption of coal fuel, seems not to play a significant role during this period since the French government used every available vessel to support its military actions in the Balkan war theater, and certainly issues of fuel economy was not in its priorities. From 1915 to 1916, up to her time of sinking, the ship continued to carry troops to the Dardanelles and Thessaloniki, which was the base of the Entente allied forces. The route followed from Toulon passing south of Sardinia and Sicily, and with a first stop in La Valletta, Malta, continuing and rounding the Cape Malea on to Piraeus and from there through the Kea Channel to the Thessaloniki port. At this point Greece, until the declaration of war against the combined German, Austro-Hungarian, Bulgarian and Turkish forces on 25 November 1916 by the Eleftherios Venizelos government, had remained neutral and any actions on its territory and seas was the case, at least theoretically, among those forces engaged in the war.  Sinking  On 13 November 1916 the ship sailed empty from Thessaloniki, Greece destined for Toulon, France for loading more troops and war materials. Captained by Cdr François Rolland and the chief engineer Auguste Richard. The next day, 14 November 1916, at 10:45 in the morning, while the ship was about southwest off Kea, Greece, a midship explosion blasted on the starboard side which flooded the engine area. While the ship had taken a 4 degrees list and the captain hoped that she will sink within 20 minutes, later on the situation changed as the water penetrated into the second boiler room ahead of the engines. The list of SS Burdigala increased and the captain ordered to abandon ship. Immediately the crew, under the supervision of the captain, the chief engineer and the second officer Mercier, launched the lifeboats in the water and abandoned the ship. 15 minutes after the \\"abandon ship\\" order was given, Burdigala, broke in two by a second explosion and sank off the northwest coast of Kea to a depth of 70 meters.

Later they were transferred on board the French flagship, Battleship Provence, and first aid services were provided. According to eyewitness reports, the statement by the commanding officer of the auxiliary cruiser SS Burdigala, Lt. Cdr François Rolland, there was only a single loss of the young engineer Nicolas Losco. (Losco, 22 years old, born on 22 November 1893 in Marseilles, France, died from burns which he suffered after a steam pipe burst in the boiler room at the time of the explosion.) It was speculated that the ship didn't hit a mine but was torpedoed, according to an eyewitness \\"The Captain, although he realized that the ship was sinking, he ordered his gunner to open fire against a submarine, her periscope still visible. Thus about 15 cannon rounds were fired, but is unknown if they hit the target\\". The official position of the French Government as submitted by 15 October 1919 which mentions that the SS Burdigala, \\"torpedoed on November 14, 1916 in the Zea Canal, aborted after having cannoned the enemy's periscope until the last minute. His (referring to Capt. Rolland) crew gave a fine example of energy and self-sacrifice.\\" Based on this position and the account of Cdr Rolland in the official report of the incident, that \\"the submarine dived immediately and the periscope disappeared soon after its detection\\". The French Government awarded in 1919 to Cdr François Rolland, to the second officer Ernest Mercier, to the Chief Engineer Auguste Richard and to other members of the SS Burdigala crew, the medal of honor Ordre de l'Armée.  Wreck  The wreck lies close to Kea's harbour and lies upright on the seabed, depth is 60 meters at the deck.

The two countries notably share a border division in the Caribbean island of Saint Martin, to which the northern part of the island is a French overseas collectivity known as the Collectivity of Saint Martin, while the southern part of the island is a Dutch constituent country known as Sint Maarten. Relations between the two countries date back to the 17th and 18th centuries when a conflict led to the transformation of the Dutch Republic to the Batavian Republic and eventually the Kingdom of Holland. The two countries currently enjoy close cultural and economic relations. Both nations are members of the OECD, as well as founding members of the European Union, NATO, and the United Nations. History=Background From the 1560s, France and the Dutch Republic considered themselves to be allies until 1668 when the Dutch Republic formed the Triple Alliance with the Kingdom of England and the Swedish Empire to revolt against Louis XIV of France's expansion in the War of Devolution in support of the Spanish Empire, whom France succeeded as the strongest nation in Europe.Wolf 1962, p. 316.Lynn 1999, p. 109. Feeling betrayed by the Dutch Republic, Louis realized that the Dutch Republic would hinder France in conquering the Spanish Netherlands. In 1672, Louis was able to convince the Kingdom of England and the Swedish Empire to fight against the Dutch Republic, as Louis had agreed to financially support England.Lynn 1999, pp. 109–110. England has already fought in two wars against the Dutch Empire (the First and Second Anglo-Dutch Wars in 1652–1654 and 1665–1667, respectively), prior to their agreement in the Triple Alliance. Franco-Dutch War The Franco-Dutch War occurred in 1672–1678, shortly after the Kingdom of England and the Swedish Empire betrayed the Dutch Republic and supported France, disbanding the Triple Alliance. 1672 is considered by the Dutch as the \\"Disaster Year\\" (Rampjaar). Supporting the Spanish Empire, the Dutch Republic was joined by the Margraviate of Brandenburg and the Holy Roman Empire, while the French army expanded through its alliance with the prince-bishops of Münster and Cologne. Prior to the French army's arrival into the Rhine, England had declared their third \\"navigation war\\" on the Dutch Republic (Third Anglo-Dutch War) in an attempt of a naval attack, but efforts were thwarted by Dutch admiral Michiel de Ruyter. By June 1672, France had established fortifications within the Rhine, including Rheinberg, Wesel, and Utrecht, and Münsterans began attacking the north, particularly Groningen. The following month, William of Nassau (the later William III) was acclaimed stadtholder.Lynn 1999, p. 114 Upon arrival at the Lower Rhine region, the French army began retreating after witnessing the Imperial and Brandenburgian armies. By December, the Dutch were able to liberate a number of occupied territories in the north after the French had retreated while crossing the Dutch Water Line. However, in late 1673, the French army succeeded in capturing Bonn. In February 1674, the Kingdom of England and the Dutch Empire, along with the prince-bishops of Münster and Cologne, signed the Treaty of Westminster, ending the Third Anglo-Dutch War. In August 1674, the Dutch-German-Spanish army entered the territory of northern France, under the command of William III of Orange, where they were met by the French army commanded by Louis II de Condé. In Seneffe, Condé blocked the Dutch-German-Spanish army by detaching about 500 horsemen to keep the Dutch vanguard busy, surrounding the Dutch-German-Spanish army and resulting to a tactical French victory. This became known as the Battle of Seneffe.Lynn, p. 80-81. In 1675, the Swedish army invaded Brandenburg. In March 1678, the French army had entered the Spanish Netherlands and besieged Ghent.Lynn 1999, p. 153. Later that year until 1679, the Treaties of Nijmegen were signed between France, the Dutch Republic, the Holy Roman Empire, the Spanish Empire, the Prince-Bishopric of Münster, and the Swedish Empire, ending the Franco-Dutch War with the Franche-Comté and the Spanish Netherlands belonging to France, making them Europe's strongest power. The war sparked the rivalry between William III, who later conquered England as part of the Glorious Revolution, and Louis XIV, which intensified in the subsequent Nine Years' War (1688–97) and the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–14), both of which the Dutch Republic supported the coalition against the Kingdom of France. Unfortunately for the Dutch Republic, the war also resulted in the decline of the republic's dominance in overseas trade. Collectivity of Saint Martin–Sint Maarten border The border crossing between the French Collectivity of Saint Martin and the Dutch Sint Maarten in the island of Saint Martin. Map of Saint Martin showing the Dutch and French parts. On 23 March 1648, the French Kingdom and the Dutch Republic signed the Treaty of Concordia atop Mount Concordia, in which both agreed to divide the island of Saint Martin into their own territories – the French Kingdom owning the northern part of the island and the Dutch Republic owning the southern part of island. On 17 May 1994, the French Republic and the Kingdom of the Netherlands signed the Franco-Dutch treaty on Saint Martin border controls in Paris, aimed at improving border control at the two airports on Saint Martin, namely the Princess Juliana International Airport at the Dutch Sint Maarten and the L'Espérance Airport at the French Collectivity of Saint Martin. The treaty was ratified on 1 August 2007. Among the provisions of the treaty is a requirement for a visa or a landing permit for both the Dutch and French sides if a foreigner is to visit the island of Saint Martin. However, the provisions have not been implemented. On 1 January 2009, the population of Saint Martin was 77,741 inhabitants – 40,917 living on the Dutch Sint Maarten and 36,824 living on the French Collectivity of Saint Martin. Economic relations France is the Netherlands' fourth-largest investor, third-largest exporter, and sixth- largest supplier, to which the Netherlands is also France's seventh-largest exporter and fourth-largest importer. According to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development, about 400 French companies in the industries of service, metallurgy, and agriculture maintain operations in the Netherlands, including AccorHotels, Air France–KLM, Atos, Capgemini, Engie, Saint-Gobain, Sodexo, Thales Group, and Total S.A.. France and the Netherlands have agreed to establish synergies to further enhance bilateral cooperation between the countries' economies, notably the Air France–KLM merger between their flag carriers (Air France and KLM) in 2004 and the Danone takeover of Numico in 2007. The ministry also stated that between 1993 and 2008, Dutch companies maintaining operations in France, including AkzoNobel, DSM, DSV, Heineken International, Royal Dutch Shell, Philips, SHV Holdings, TNT Express, and Vopak, contributed to the creation of 15,000 jobs in the country. Cultural and scientific cooperation From 1957 until its closure in 2013, the Institut Néerlandais in Paris promoted Dutch art and culture and was one of the oldest cultural centers in the city. Its counterpart, the Institut Français, has branches in Amsterdam and Groningen that promote French art and culture. A number of French research institutes, including the Centre national de la recherche scientifique, the Institut national de la recherche agronomique, IFREMER, and the French Institute of Health and Medical Research, have signed agreements with Dutch research institutes to enhance collaborative capabilities. The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development has also stated that French legal culture is being promoted at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Drug combat According to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development, France and the Netherlands have cooperated with each other in the prohibition of drugs since 1995 through the leadership of a high-level bilateral group. The two countries hold annual meetings in The Hague and Paris. State visits French President François Hollande visited the Netherlands on 20 January 2014, where he met with King Willem-Alexander, Queen Máxima, and Prime Minister Mark Rutte. He also met with the House of Representatives and the Senate, where he addressed the diplomatic and political ties between the two countries. Diplomatic missions The Dutch embassy in Paris.

It is pollinated by a single species of male thynnid wasp using sexual deception. The orchid's labellum is similar in shape and scent to a flightless female thynnid wasp. It is one of the more common drakaeas and is easily distinguished from the other species. The tiny lumps on its leaf along with the long flower that lacks a swollen labellum are diagnostic.  Description  Drakaea thynniphila is similar to others in the genus in that it has a single, ground hugging leaf and an underground tuber. In this case, the leaf is heart shaped, about in diameter, covered with tiny raised lumps, fairly glossy dark green with darker lines radiating from the attachment to the stem. The stem is long and the stalk of the single flower is long. Its flower is also similar to those of other hammer orchids in that the labellum resembles a flightless female thynnid wasp, except that the labellum is longer, less swollen than those of other drakaeas and lacks spots. Narrow-lipped hammer orchids have a spine on the column. The sepal at the back of the flower is long and the two at the sides are . The petals are also long. The insect-like labellum has a \\"head\\" about one-half to one-third long as the \\"body\\", is densely hairy and has two dark maroon lumps at its base.

Background From 1939 and for the duration of the war, the Australian government had in place a system of price control which governed both the price of wool and the sale price in Australia of woollen garments. The first step in resuming normal practice after the war was the resumption of selling wool by auction and private sale after 30 June 1946. The price at which Australian Woollen Mills could sell its goods were fixed by the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner until 20 September 1948. From 30 June 1946, the Australian government introduced a subsidy for the purchase of wool to be manufactured into garments in Australia and sold for local consumption. In 1948, the Australian government discontinued paying the subsidy, leaving Australian Woolen Mills with a substantial amount of wool on hand, for which the subsidy had not been paid. As a result, Australian Woolen Mills sued for breach of contract, whilst the government denied liability on the grounds that there was no legally binding contract between the parties. Held The High Court ruled that there was no legally binding contract between the parties, as all the government had done was merely to make a statement on government policy (i.e. the subsidy), which alone was not an offer capable of acceptance. The Court stated \\"what is alleged to be an offer should have been intended to give rise, on the doing of the act, to an obligation ... in the absence of such an intention, actual or imputed, and alleged \\"offer\\" cannot lead to a contract: there is, indeed, in such a case no true \\"offer\\".\\" Privy Council The Privy Council gave Australian Woolen Mills special leave to appeal, however dismissed the appeal, agreeing with the High Court that there was no contract to pay a subsidy.; References High Court of Australia cases Woollen industry ","title":"Australian Woollen Mills Pty Ltd v Commonwealth"},{"id":"48547608","text":"Cairns to Kuranda railway, 1890 The Queensland Public Service provides public services to the people of Queensland, Australia on behalf of the Government of Queensland.

However, as some Ministers have felt their vision for their portfolios have been frustrated by a Director-General who did not embrace their vision, Directors-General are now sometimes replaced by an incoming Minister who makes their own appointment (often by invitation) of a person who the Minister believe shares their vision. While such Directors-General are technically public servants, they are generally regarded as political appointments and their tenure is often linked to the tenure of the Minister.  Statutory authorities  A statutory authority is an organisation established under separate legislation to manage a particular aspect of government administration. Most statutory bodies have their own board of management, selected or appointed in different ways. However, all must report to a Minister. Statutory authorities have varying degrees of independence to the government and public service. Some statutory authorities are dependent on government subsidies and grants and hence likely to very highly attuned to the wishes of the Minister and/or Director-General; others are funded in other ways (e.g. providing services) and enjoy greater independence as a consequence. However, as all statutory authorities exist under Queensland legislation, the Minister can assert control by changing the legislation within the Queensland Parliament. Strictly, employees of statutory authorities are not part of the Queensland Public Service, but where their positions are funded by the Queensland Government they are often treated as members of the Queensland Public Service for statistical and budgetary purposes.  Statistics  At 30 June 2015, there were 243,163 staff (203,348.50 full-time equivalent) employees in 20 Queensland Government departments and 15 other organisations included for statistical purposes. The three largest government employers are Queensland Health, the Department of Education and Training and the Queensland Police Service.

Drawing upon his interest in both modernist literary movements and medieval architecture and pageantry, Winkfield has collaborated with many contemporary poets and writers, including John Ashbery, Harry Mathews, James Schuyler, and Ron Padgett. Early life Born in Leeds, England in 1944, Winkfield had an early interest in medieval heraldry and pageantry that had a major influence on his later work. As a teenager, Winkfield began making what he called \\"pilgrimages\\" by bicycle and bus to see single works of art, including works by Francis Bacon and Kurt Schwitters. At the age of sixteen, Winkfield enrolled at Leeds College of Art, which he has described as \\"a second kindergarten, with no classes to attend (or at least very few) ... everyone was very friendly, a real community.\\" Winkfield has described himself as a \\"self-taught\\" painter, viewing his painting as a reaction against the Bauhaus-inspired orientation of the school at the time. He received an Intermediate Certificate in Art from Leeds College of Art in 1964. From 1964 to 1967, he studied at the Royal College of Art in London, earning an M.A. in fine art. Career Described as a “connoisseur of the original, spare, and strange,”Schwabsky 2014. Winkfield has collaborated with John Ashbery, Harry Mathews, Kenward Elmslie, Barbara Guest, Ron Padgett, and John Yau. WInkfield founded several small poetry journals in the late 1960s, including one called Juilliard, which brought him into association with poets of the New York School, including James Schuyler. As a painter, Winkfield is represented by Tibor de Nagy Gallery. He was awarded a Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists award (1993). In 2014, a book-length interview with Winkfield by Miles Champion was published under the title “How I Became a Painter,” and a selection of Winkfield’s writings on art was published under the title “Georges Braque & Others: The Selected Art Writings of Trevor Winkfield.” In 2015, a solo exhibition, entitled “Trevor Winkfield’s Pageant,” was mounted at the Poetry Foundation in Chicago, showcasing Winkfield’s collaborations with notable poets.

The World Methodist Historical Society notes that Rev. Thomas was the very first East Indian minister to ever be ordained in South Africa, and probably the first ever non-white ordination, since it was standard practice for both the Anglican and Roman Catholic sects to import all Indian ministers from India.http://archives.gcah.org/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10516/1688/HistoricalBulletin2011Vol38No1.pdf?sequence=1 According to the Rev S.H Stott, in his autobiographical work, 'A Nonagenarian's Experiences and Observations in Many Lands.' (London: Epworth Press 1927), Rev. John Thomas is noted for his single-handed translation of the Bible into the Dravidian Tamil language and Telegu language which was an essential element for the growth of Christianity in the South African Indian community. He is also noted for his extensive missionary work; educational contributions; social responsibility; conflict resolutions and community service, provided at a pivotal and dangerous time for Indians in Natal. His school, one of very few formal educational facilities available at that time for Indian pupils, taught a curriculum of both religious and secular education and was inclusive of both Christian and non-Christian pupils; Black and mixed race children, then called Coloured. Thus, he is credited by his superiors, peers and notable pupils, for greatly advancing not only the education, but the successful identity, community growth, and cultural life of the non- Christian and Christian East Indian populace in the province of Natal. He can thus, also be credited for heavily influencing and motivating the young Indian minds of various faiths, who went on to acquire acclaim within the non-violent anti-Apartheid Movement; and national business, political and cultural arenas. Today, the South African Indian community is the largest outside of India.https://scnc.ukzn.ac.za/doc/B/Roots/Roots-mounted-on- web/1983/18_1983_V3_Hammond_DA_Biography_Reverend_John_Thomas_and_Ephraim_Thomas.pdf Commendations In recognition of his outstanding and selfless lifelong service to the community, the Pietermaritzburg City Council named the street upon which his church and school were situated, Thomas Street. Early life Rev. John Thomas was born in Mackay's Gardens, Madras, India, in 1871. Immigration to South Africa Rev. Thomas and his wife, Grace emigrated to Natal, South Africa in 1890. Conditions in India during this time were vastly deteriorated due to a combination of life-threatening factors which included growing tensions between various religions; the worsening caste system; slow recovery from the Great Famine of 1876–78; and the natural disaster phenomena known as monsoon droughts which was threatening a whole new outbreak of widespread famine which eventually did occur, resulting the deaths of many millions of Indians.Timeline of major famines in India during British rule Early-20th century education in South Africa During his time as a teacher at St. Pauls, and Anglican school, worked hard to integrate himself but also to bring Indian influences to South Africa for the local Indian populace. He thus played an important role as the first minister to translate English sermons into the Tamil language. Barred from the well-funded white schools, and with formal Black education being largely non-existent until the controversial Bantu Education Act, 1953, the growing population of school age Indian children in Natal had very few schools available to them at that time. Some of the reasoning for this can be found in the fears expressed a few years later in 1925, by leading proponents of the Apartheid ideology and their proposal of an ethnic cleansing of the Indian population via forced emigration from South Africa. In 1925 D.F. Malan, the Minister of the Interior, stated in parliament: > ... the Indian, as a race in this country, is an alien element in the > population. . . .' Furthermore, '. . . no solution of this question will be > acceptable to this country until it results in a very considerable reduction > of the Indian population in this country. This statement indicates the > Nationalist party policy but it also found acceptance by the South African > Party, the major opposition party, whose own policy towards Asiatics was > defined as 'no Asiatic immigration, and repatriation as fast as possible ... > with no chance of return.' In 1921 87,6% of the Union's total Indian > population resided in Natal and they exceeded the white population there by > 4 811. Natal's Indian population was confined within its borders as inter- > provincial restrictions prevented their free movement across the borders. > Repatriation of Indians then had special significance for Natal > whites.http://www.natalia.org.za/Files/15/Natalia%20v15%20article%20p36-56%20C.pdf These statements, reflect the grave sociopolitical climate and racial tensions of the era within which Rev. Thomas performed his crucial roles as minister, schoolmaster and community leader in Kwa-Zulu Natal. The Anti-Apartheid movement had always relied as heavily upon the social responsibility and community consciousness of the religious leaders in South Africa, most prominently the Christian, Muslim and Hindu leaders, as the Civil Rights Movement relied upon their Christian leaders in the United States. This is especially significant in the face of the unBiblical and gross misuse of Christianity by many of Apartheid's proponents and supporters to promote Apartheid ideologies and its government policies.http://people.ucalgary.ca/~nurelweb/papers/irving/apart.html References A Nonagenarian's Experiences and Observations in Many Lands by S.H.

History The council was established on 5 January 1888 under the provisions of the District Councils Act 1887. On creation, the council comprised the hundreds of Boolcunda, Cudlamudla, Kanyaka, Moockra and Palmer, and parts of the hundreds of Pichi Richi, Yarrah and Wyacca, east of the Middle Range and Dutchman's Range ridge line, which together make up the eastern two thirds of the County of Newcastle. The council area thus extended north and east from Pichi Richi Pass (about southwest of Quorn) to a point about due south of Hawker. The council was initially based out of the Quorn Town Hall, but later was housed in an office converted from a house in Eighth Street, Quorn. Both buildings were actually not in the council area, being instead within the Corporate Town of Quorn which was an enclave surrounded by Kanyaka council from 1888. Both the town hall and later office survive as of 2015; the latter building has reverted to residential use. On 16 February 1933, the council gained a section of the abolished District Council of Woolundunga, which became the new Mundallio Ward. By 1936, the council had seven wards (Pichi Richi, Suburban, Palmer, Boolcunda, Kanyaka, Mundallio and Yarrah), was reported to have a population of approximately 1,000, and was said to be one of the northernmost councils in South Australia. It merged with the Corporate Town of Quorn on 1 April 1969 to form the District Council of Kanyaka-Quorn. Chairmen * C. Meincke (1888) * W. H. Neal (1902-1904) * G. H.

It was built in 1894 by James Overend. It is also known as Millaquin Bridge. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Agitation for a railway from Bundaberg to the Woongarra district began in the 1880s and a line was surveyed during 1889-91. In the absence of funds for government construction and with the support of the railway commissioners, Robert Cran of the Millaquin sugar refinery near Bundaberg, was authorised by an Act of Parliament in 1892, to construct a private railway from Bundaberg to the sugar refinery. Plans were prepared for the bridge in 1893. Tenders were called by the government and a contract for construction was awarded to James Overend in January 1894. The railway was opened for traffic on 9 July 1894. The railway was acquired by the Queensland Government on 3 December 1912. In 1917, an Act of Parliament approved the acquisition of the railway to Woongarra. In 1918, the State Government acquired the extension of the railway which had been constructed by the Woongarra Shire Council. In 1965, plans were prepared for strengthening the bridge with steel girders suitable for a 12-ton axle loading. This was subsequently undertaken with re-used girders from the Gold Coast.  Description  Bridge, 2009 Saltwater Creek bridge includes one plate girder span with steel cross girders and longitudinals, seven 20 and two timber spans, supported on seven timber piers, two concrete cylinder piers, and two timber abutments. It comprises: * 4x1x2 timber longitudinals, concrete abutment, common braced timber trestles, (two on timber foundations) or a common concrete pier (piers 1 to 5) * 1x2x2 timber longitudinals, common braced timber trestle on a concrete foundation (pier 5), common cast iron cylinders with screw piles (pier 6) * 1x2 half-through plate girders with steel cross girders, steel longitudinals, common cast iron cylinder piers with screw piles (piers 6 and 7) * 1x2x2 timber longitudinals, common cast iron cylinders with screw piles (pier 7), common braced timber trestle (pier 8). * 3x1x2 timber longitudinals, common braced timber trestles (piers 8 to 11).

It was built for the official visit of the Governor of Queensland, Sir Anthony Musgrave, to Bundaberg in his 1888 tour of the area. It is located on the summit of the Bundaberg Hummock hill and provides a commanding view of the surrounding Bargara canefields. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 February 2001.  History  A dry-stone rubble platform, known as Sir Anthony's Rest, was constructed during the visit of the Governor of Queensland, Sir Anthony Musgrave, to Bundaberg in his 1888 tour of the area. At this time Bundaberg was celebrating its 21st year of non-Indigenous settlement. Using South Sea Islander labour, William Gordon Farquhar of the Hummock plantation constructed a lookout for the Governor and his party facing east, with a view over the cane fields of the Shire of Woongarra. The area was part of the highest geographical point in the area, officially known as the Sloping Hummock but commonly known as simply \\"The Hummock\\" (). Sloping Hummock From the deck of HMS Norfolk, Lieutenant Matthew Flinders took a bearing on a small volcanic outcrop, five kilometres to the south of Mon Repos beach. Flinders was surveying the waters between Great Sandy Island (Fraser Island) and the mainland. He named the outcrop the Sloping Hummock during his 1799 visit. Sugar industry Amongst the first of the sugar plantations in Bundaberg was Millaquin, established in 1882. It was joined in 1883 by the Hummock, Oakwood and Spring Hill plantations. WG Farquhar's 182 hectare block in the heart of the Woongarra was named the Hummock, as it took in part of the Woongarra's only landmark. By the end of 1882, Farquhar had 154 hectares of cane on the seaward slope of the Hummock, untouched by frost. In May 1883 Farquhar's juice mill machinery was delivered and in its enthusiasm the Sugar Planter described the rollers as measuring \\"60 feet by 30 feet\\", confusing feet with inches. The first crushing was made on Saturday 30 June 1883. After one successful season, Farquhar sold to HJ Rhodes, a New South Wales capitalist. Farquhar visited Scotland, and his native Aberdeen, but returned to spend the rest of his life at the Hummock. Rhodes was soon in trouble, with drought and falling prices threatening to force him into insolvency, but both men carried on. Farquhar retained control, dying in 1909, aged 67, having seen the Hummock crush for the last time in 1893 when the plantation amalgamated with Nott Brothers' adjoining Windermere. Farquhar, like most of the Woongarra farmers, barely made a living from maize growing. Although the soil was good and two crops per year could be obtained, the inundations of pests and disease, the expense and difficulties of transport, and the lack of a strong market, combined to erode farmers' profits. However, in the early 1880s the district was transformed following the construction of the Millaquin Sugar Refinery (1880–82) and the establishment of a viable sugar industry in the area. Small crushing or \\"juice\\" mills were erected on farms throughout the Woongarra, and the juice piped directly to the refinery, or if along the Burnett River, transported by punt. In the period 1882-84, 24 crushing mills were established in the Bundaberg district, most of them in the Woongarra Shire. By October 1882, when the Millaquin refinery went into production, crushing mills were operating at Ashgrove, Avoca, Fairymead, Glenmorris, Grange, Kepnock, Mabbro, Summerville, Windermere and Woodbine plantations. Seaview, Mon Repos and Sunnyside Plantations were established in 1884. Woodlands followed soon after. Sugar was embraced wholeheartedly by the Woongarra farmers, particularly when they could obtain cheap indentured labour from the South Sea Islands to help clear the scrub and work the cane fields. South Sea Islanders had been working on other sugar plantations in the Bundaberg district from at least the mid-1870s. They were not brought directly to Bundaberg until 1879, but prior to this planters obtained Islanders via Maryborough, whose sugar industry had been established in the late 1860s. Vice-Royal visit It was during Farquhar's time at the Hummock that the Governor of Queensland, Sir Anthony Musgrave, undertook a northern tour and visited a number of towns, including Bundaberg. Musgrave was considered to be a very popular Governor, undertaking tours to the northern ports and inland towns in 1883, 1884, 1887 and 1888. Musgrave was keen to make himself acquainted with as large a portion of the colony as possible. In all the places visited, Musgrave was well received. Musgrave proclaimed the Woongarra Division in 1885. Anthony Musgrave was born in Antigua, West Indies in 1828. Educated in the West Indies, Musgrave, became the Governor of South Australia in 1873. From 1877-1883 he was Governor of Jamaica. On 21 July 1883, he became Governor of Queensland. Musgrave left London on 22 September 1883 and arrived in Melbourne on 1 November 1883. Musgrave opened Queensland Parliament on 8 November 1883. With Samuel Griffith, who became Queensland Premier in November 1883, Musgrave shared a deep enthusiasm for Australian Federation. Musgrave visited England in June 1886 and planned to retire. In June 1888, Sir Thomas McIlwraith became premier. The two soon clashed over the governor's right to unfettered exercise of the prerogative of mercy. Musgrave appealed to the Colonial Office, McIlwraith defiled him and London supported the premier. A few weeks later, Musgrave died on 9 October 1888. Musgrave was the sixth Governor of Queensland, in the position from November 1883 - October 1888. Making themselves visible and approachable to as many people as possible were key factors in obtaining and maintaining the Governor's popularity amongst the people. Musgrave covered considerable distances on tour and Lady Musgrave, intelligent and well-educated, often accompanied him on tour or held ladies' receptions. During the 1888 tour, Governor and Lady Musgrave visited Bundaberg on 30–31 May, Maryborough on 4 June and were in Gympie on 5 June. Musgrave's visit to Bundaberg had been the first official visit from a Governor of Queensland in ten years, since Governor Kennedy. From the earliest days of colonial Queensland, governor's tours were more than familiarisation tours. They were both practical and ceremonial and received detailed coverage in the Queensland press. Tours encourage a sense of community within the places visited and was an opportunity to display progress made and to receive recognition for achievements. A vice-regal visit provided the chance to bring matters of local importance to the Governor's attention. The ceremonial and social aspects of governors' tours followed a similar pattern established in Britain during the late eighteenth century. Aspects included a reception by the local council, loyal addresses and the presentation of gifts and local curiosities. Visibility extended to eating in public. An interest in the welfare and progress of the people was demonstrated by laying foundation stones, taking an interest in children and performing ordinary activities in public. Following his welcome, the Governor was usually escorted into the town where he paused at the nearest official building, usually the court house, so that addresses of welcome could be made. Musgrave and the Vice-Regal party arrived in Bundaberg on Wednesday, 30 May 1888, by the Government steamer Lucinda. On their first day, the party travelled to Millaquin Plantation and later drove around the town. Following a procession in Bundaberg on Thursday morning, the Vice-Regal party them headed out of the town. Lunch was taken at Mon Repos. One of the more unusual aspects of the tour was arranged for the Vice-Regal party was at the Hummock, Farquhar had fixed up a retreat at the highest available point. Here a booth, surrounded with basaltic boulders, had been constructed where refreshments were taken. The view from the booth was considered to be the finest in the district, overlooking the cane farms of the area. According to reports at the time, both the Governor and Lady Musgrave expressed delight at so picturesque a scene, and spoke approvingly of the general aspects of that portion of the district. Construction Farquhar's use of South Sea Islands labour probably dates from the establishment of the plantation in 1883. Most planters considered the use of South Sea Islanders for field work, especially clearing of stumps and rocks in preparation for planting, essential in establishing a successful sugar plantation. Where possible stones would be broken into convenient size for handling, loaded onto drays and carted to the farm boundary lines, and there built up as stone wall boundary fences averaging one and a half metres in height and just over one metre wide. Local tradition also records that wooden sleds, pulled by draught horses, followed around the paddocks as the land was being cleared. Rocks unearthed during this process were placed on the sled. Big rocks which would not fit on the sled would be broken up with spalling hammers. These pieces would then be placed on corn bags, an Islander on each corner, which would then be carried to the sled. When full, the sleds were taken to the end of the paddock where they were unloaded. The construction of Sir Anthony's Rest is similar to the construction of the number of dry-rubble boundary walls which were constructed in the area using South Sea Islander labour (e.g. South Sea Islander Wall at Mon Repos). These walls were constructed in layers, with larger stones placed around the outside and smaller stones used for the infill. This seems to have been a common construction method in the Woongarra, but the origin of the technique has yet to be established. Usually the crowds wishing to gain a view of the Vice-Regal party were large and often, there was no building in the town large enough to accommodate all those who wished to attend. Consequently, the erection of marquees was utilised. In Rockhampton, \\"a marquee of green branches\\" topped with the Royal coat of arms, was erected near the quay for the reading of speeches. Usually, structures specially assembled for visits by touring governors were temporary. The platform constructed for Sir Anthony's Vice-Regal party is rare as an example of a more permanent feature associated with a governor's tour.  Description  Sir Anthony's Rest and its dry rubble, 2009 Sir Anthony's Rest is located on a cane field in the area known as \\"The Hummock\\", approximately five kilometres east of Bundaberg. The Hummock is one of the area's most well known geographical landmarks. The site provides an expansive view towards Bundaberg, the nearby town of Bargara and surrounding canefields, and consists of a dry rubble earth and stone platform, measuring approximately high by long and wide. Located in the south-eastern corner of the property, the platform takes up approximately 0.1 hectare of the twenty hectare cane farm. A large fig tree, mango trees and other mature vegetation are located to the north-east of the platform. There is no remaining evidence of the framed shelter constructed for the Vice-Regal visit. The remainder of the property is planted with cane.  Heritage listing  Sir Anthony's Rest was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 February 2001 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Sir Anthony's Rest is significant for its association with an important historical event, Governor Sir Anthony Musgrave's tour of the area in June 1888, during the development of the Bundaberg/Woongarra region. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Sir Anthony's Rest is significant as a rare physical remnant of a governor's tour to an area, particularly as most shelters for visiting Vice-Regal parties were of a temporary nature. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Measuring approximate long by wide, and rising to a height of , Sir Anthony's Rest is significant for its landmark value, clearly visible from one section along the Bagara-Bundaberg Road. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Importantly, Sir Anthony's Rest, has a strong association for the present local South Sea Islander community and the experiences of their ancestors in Queensland. Sir Anthony's Rest is significant for the strong social significance it holds for the residents of Bundaberg and the surrounding areas and is highly valued by the community. Sir Anthony's Rest was identified in the Burnett Shire Heritage Study. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Sir Anthony's Rest is significant for its association with the South Sea Islander community and the exploitation of this large workforce employed in the Bundaberg district, one of the most affluent sugar districts in the state, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

After winning two minor races as a two-year-old she improved in 1972 to win the Ladbrokes Oaks Trial before taking the Oaks. She went on to finish third in the Yorkshire Oaks and the St Leger. At the end of the year she was sold to a Japanese breeding syndicate and exported to Japan. Ginevra did not produce any notable offspring, although two of her daughters had some success as broodmares. Background Ginevra was foaled at the Earl of Suffolk stud in Gloucestershire. Her sire, Shantung, was a winner of the 1959 Prix La Rochette, the Prix Edgard de la Charme and was the second leading sire in France in 1969. Ginevra's dam, Zest, was an unsuccessful racehorse that was bought by the Earl of Suffolk in 1967 for 1,200 guineas. Ginevra was entered in the Newmarket Houghton sale as a yearling in 1970 but failed to make her reserve price of 2,500 guineas, the bidding having stopped at 1,300 guineas. She was later was sold privately to the racing partnership of St. George and Richards for 2,000 guineas. Ginevra was a bay filly with no white markings. Trained by Ryan Price throughout her career, Ginevra had a difficult and unpredictable personality. She was prone to escaping from her paddock and once jumped the fence three days before the running of the Oaks to graze on a nearby carriageway.

In the Free Handicap, a rating of the best juveniles to race in Britain, she was allotted a weight of 113 pounds, 20 pounds behind the top- rated colt Crowned Prince and fourteen pounds behind the top-rated filly Rose Dubarry. 1972: three-year-old season Ginevra began her second season by finishing unplaced in a handicap race but then won the Ladbrokes Oaks Trial at Lingfield Park in May 1972. On 10 June, Ginevra started in the Oaks Stakes at 8-1 odds, the race favourite being Arkadina (the future dam of Irish St. Leger winner Dark Lomond). Ridden by Tony Murray, Ginevra was last of the field for the first half mile until six furlongs from the finish whereby she rapidly passed second-place finisher Regal Exception to win easily by 1.5 lengths. Murray commented on the difficulty of training Ginevra after the running, \\"She has been a most difficult filly to train. The captain [Ryan Price] has handled her in miraculous fashion throughout and spent a tremendous amount of time on her. I have never seen a feat of training to equal this.\\" Ginevra was beaten in her three remaining races. She finished third to Attica Meli in the Yorkshire Oaks in August and then took third place behind the colts Boucher and Our Mirage in the St Leger Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse in September. Shipped to Longchamp Racecourse in September for her last career start, Ginevra finished a disappointing fourth to San San and Paysanne in the Prix Vermeille. Breeding career Ginevra was retired from racing at the end of her three-year-old season and was sold to a Japanese breeding syndicate for 106,000 guineas at the December Sales. She was the first British Classic winner just out of training that had been sold at the December Sales since Festoon was sold in 1954.

Personal life  McCormack is the son of former Toronto Police Chief William J. McCormack who headed the Metropolitan Toronto Police Service from 1989 to 1995. He comes from a family of police officers; his paternal grandfather was a police officer in Ireland before being promoted Sergeant Major in charge of the Beau Bassin Police Station on the island of, what was then the British Colony of, Mauritius in the Indian Ocean off Madagascar; his maternal grandfather was connected with the OPP; and three of his four siblings have a connection to policing in Ontario.  Police career  McCormack began his 23-year policing career working at 52 Division, in downtown Toronto's entertainment district, where his older brother, William Jr., was assigned from 1996 until his suspension in April 2004, when criminal charges for corruption were laid in relation to \\"shaking down club owners\\" in 52 Division and William Jr. resigned in March 2009 although the criminal charges for soliciting and accepting bribes were stayed for excessive delay by Crown prosecutors and the lead police investigator. Mike subsequently moved to 51 Division, policing Toronto's Regent Park district, which he \\"loved\\", later indicating \\"Regent Park was my niche\\". In 2002, 51 Division's McCormack, Detective Constable Jack Caccavale, and Detective Scott Matthews, of the Toronto Police Drug Squad, co-founded the annual event which McCormack co- emcees. The event was started to boost morale following the suspension of several 51 Division officers, including former TPA president Craig Bromell, for allegedly beating up homeless man Thomas Kerr. The private charity event, which is attended by some 2,000 law enforcement personnel including police, corrections officers, and Crown attorneys, consists of both male and female members, from area police departments, paramedics, firefighters, and 911, engaging in boxing matches to determine who will win bragging rights for the following year. Proceeds of the annual event support Police Enabling Action for Community Education , chaired by Matthews and supervised by Dixon Hall, which uses the money to fund partial scholarships for local students to attend university. Officially, the event is condemned by as its \\"boozy underpinnings and sexist overtones\\" do not fit with the image the service is trying to project. Several hours after the March 2009 event three officers allegedly ganged up on a 33 Division officer, who had been officer of the month from January of that year, beating him to the extent that he was hospitalized, suffering from serious head injuries and requiring a CT scan to check for possible brain injuries; despite an internal investigation, no criminal charges were laid and no disciplinary action was reported. In 2004, McCormack was charged with corruption and discreditable conduct under the Police Services Act of Ontario for allegedly being involved with a reputed organized crime affiliated, drug-addicted, used-car salesman; however those charges were later dropped. Then in 2008 another discreditable conduct charge against McCormack was also dismissed, that charge stemming from McCormack having, for his own purposes, recorded Toronto Star reporter John Duncanson while he was being held in a cell after an arrest for public drunkenness. It was not until September 2009, the same day that David Miller announced that he would not be running for a third term as Mayor of Toronto, that McCormack was convicted of insubordination under the police act for improperly, and for purposes not related to law enforcement, accessing Duncanson's records in the police database. Duncanson had previously penned numerous stories involving Toronto Police for the Star and was the award-winning investigative reporter who, in 2005, uncovered illicit activities by six members of 51 Division's drug squad. The fine for McCormack's insubordination conviction was 40 hours pay; however, since McCormack had already been elected to the Toronto Police Association, the pseudo-union for Toronto Police officers and civilian employees, by the time he was sentenced, he cannot be compelled to pay the fine because, although he's technically still a Toronto Police officer, he's currently on secondment to the and is paid by them; so the is unable to deduct the fine from his wages and, except through payroll deductions, has no legal power to compel payment; but the money would eventually be collected if McCormack ever returned to active duty with the Service.

The approach that lead to development of the J147 drug was to screen candidate molecules for anti-aging effects, instead of targeting the amyloid plaques. It is contrary to most other approaches to developing drugs against Alzheimer's disease that target the plaque deposits in the brain. The J147 drug is also reported to address other biological aging factors, such as preventing the leakage of blood from microvessels in mice brains. The development of J147 follows the chemical pharmacological way, contrary to biological ways that exploit e.g. use of bacteriophages. Enhanced neurogenic activity over J147 in human neural precursor cells has its derivative called CAD-31. CAD-31 is enhancing the use of free fatty acids for energy production by shifting of the metabolic profile of fatty acids toward the production of ketone bodies, a potent source of energy in the brain when glucose levels are low.Daugherty, D., Goldberg, J., Fischer, W., Dargusch, R., Maher, P., & Schubert, D.

Agenda priorities  G20 Argentina has put forth three agenda priorities for the G20 dialogue in 2018: the future of work, infrastructure for development and a sustainable food future. A number of attending countries have said they focus on the regulation of crypto-currencies at this meeting. Talks between the U.S. and China related to resolving the escalating 2018 China–United States trade war were a central issue of the summit.  Outcomes  Outgoing Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, U.S. President Donald Trump, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signed the USMCA agreement. On Friday 30 November, ahead of the formal start of the summit, outgoing Mexican President Peña Nieto, U.S. President Trump, and Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau signed the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA), a proposed replacement to the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Counter-summit The Latin American Council of Social Sciences (CLACSO) had organized a counter-summit, called the First World Forum of Critical Thinking, which took place in the week leading up to the G20 event.https://www.clacso.org.ar/conferencia2018/presentacion.php?s=1&idioma;=en It was attended by other politicians such as former Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff, Bolivian vice president Álvaro García Linera, former Colombian president Ernesto Samper, and human rights activist Estela de Carlotto. At the event, former Argentine president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner criticised the economic policies of Mauricio Macri and the IMF loans that he has received. Former Uruguayan president José Mujica was also invited, but declined to take part in the counter-summit to avoid damaging Argentina–Uruguay relations. Security The previous summit in Hamburg, Germany, met with huge protests, with cars set on fire and roads blocked by protesters. The 2018 summit had reinforced security, to prevent a repeat of those protests. Local left-wing organizations planned protests and called for foreign activists to join them. The Argentine government, working alongside the others, is attempting to prevent the entry of troublemakers into the country, such as people with criminal charges or who have advocated for violent actions. Only peaceful protests will be allowed. Federal Security Minister Patricia Bullrich said that \\"We will not permit illegal acts. Those who want to cross the line will have to face the legal consequences\\". 22,000 police and 700 security ministry agents will guard the event, working alongside the security services of the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Italy, Spain and others. An area of around the will be cordoned off, the public transportation network – including the metro – will be shut down, and traffic along the River Plate will be halted. Friday, 30 November was declared a one-time public holiday day in the city of Buenos Aires, to prevent the traffic caused by people's daily activities, and residents were urged to leave the city for the long weekend. Media Minister reported that no infiltration by international terrorist groups had been detected, and the US government said that the remote location of Argentina would discourage international protesters from travelling to the country. Two bomb attacks took place in the days before the summit. Judge Claudio Bonadio, who was investigating former president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner for embezzlement charges, was attacked in his home; his bodyguards stopped Marco Viola, who was arrested, and the bomb was dismantled by a police bomb squad. Anahi Esperanza Salcedo, who identifies as an anarchist and a radical feminist, tried to bomb the tomb of the late chief of police Ramón Lorenzo Falcón at La Recoleta Cemetery, but her bomb went off early and she was hospitalized with injuries to her hand and face. Both attacks were made with improvised explosive devices. After those events, the United Kingdom government lowered its terrorism alert for Buenos Aires from \\"very likely\\" to \\"likely\\".

The street extends rue Dieu, after crossing the Canal Saint-Martin via the Alibert gateway or via the swing bridge on rue Dieu. History Initially a minor dead-end street, it had several names: 'rue Dagouri' (1740), 'rue Notre-Dame', 'ruelle des Postes', and 'impasse St. Louis' because of the proximity of the Hôpital Saint-Louis. A ministerial decision of 28 Vendemiaire year XI (20 October 1802 in the French Republican Calendar) set the minimum width of the street to 10 meters and ordered the street to be extended to the Rue Saint- Maur. The opening of the laterally-crossing rue Bichat in 1824 meant that it was no longer a dead-end, and royal order of December 6, 1827 programmed its widening to 15 meters and extension, however this was ultimately never achieved. The street was renamed rue Alibert on January 19, 1840 in homage to Baron Jean-Louis Alibert, assistant physician at the Hôpital Saint-Louis.

It is located 22 km from Hosur and 60 km from Bangalore. Constructed in the Hoysala style of architecture, the temple is dedicated to Vishnu who is worshipped as Devaperumal and his consort Lakshmi as Soundaryavalli in this temple. As per Hindu legend, Venkateshwara believed to have appeared for sage Kanva rishi to save him from the Yaksha Devandagadagan. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines. The temple has a five tiered rajagopuram, the temple's gateway tower. The Wodeyars of Mysore commissioned pillared halls and major shrines of the temple during the 16th century. The temple follows Thenkalai tradition of worship. Two daily rituals and many yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the fifteen-day annual Chittirai Kalyana Utsavam during the Tamil month of Chittirai (April - May) and nine-day Brahmotsavam being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend The place finds mention in Skanda Purana, which has eight chapters detailing the legend of the temple. As per Hindu legend, Devandagadagan, an Yaksha and the maternal of the famous king Kubera, once got a boon from Brahma that he would get endless powers. He was very proud of his powers and started troubling the Deva (Hinduism), the celestial deities, and the sages who were doing penance in the region. He was once punished by sage Atri, who cursed him to roam in the forest and said that he would be relieved of his curse once Vishnu strikes him with a mace. Ages passed by and Kanvagada was troubling the sages in the forest. Once sage Kanva was finding it difficult to spot a place to do his penance, when sage Atri advised him to go to a place on the banks of Cauvery close to Narayanagiri. Kanva started doing his penance and the Yaksha started troubling the sage. A divine voice informed the sage to seek the help of Venkateswara. The sage did so and Venkateshwara came to the place from his abode at Tirumala Venkateswara Temple. He transformed as a hunter with a bow called Saranga and his mace called Denkani. An intense battle followed between the hunter and Devandagadaga, eventually the hunter slaying the Yaksha with Denkani. In memori of the event, the place came to be known as Denkanipuram, which eventually became Denkanikottai. The sage and the Yaksha were blessed with the vision of Venkateshwara, who made the place his abode. History Ballaraya was a ruler of the Paligar family, who held sway over the region and the temple. The region came to the hands of Haisala Jagadevaraya, a feudatory of the Vijayanagara Empire. It is believed that the fortress in the region was built during his regime. In 1652, Itapel Rao, a Maratha feudatory annexed the region, which changed hands to Chandrasekara Rao in 1653. The Wodeyars of Mysore held sway over the region till 1768, when the British under Casby held control of the region. When there were threats from Muslim rulers in the region, the image of the presiding deity was hidden by a devotee named Venkatapahty Rayar in the forest. The Vysya community in the region is believed to have contributed to the major halls and shrines of the temple. Architecture Betrayaswamy temple is constructed in the Hoysala style of architecture. The temple occupies an area of and is surrounded by a granite walls. The rectangular enclosure measure by , while the temple tank measures by . The five tiered rajagopuram, the temple's gateway tower, has five kalasam at the top. The sanctum houses the image of Betrayaswamy in standing posture similar to the image of Venkateshwara in Tirumala Venkateswara Temple. The images of Sridevi and Bhudevi are located on either of his sides. The Ardha mandapa is guarded by two dwarapalas on either sides. The shrine of Soundaravalli is located closed to the eastern gateway. There Mahamandapa houses the images of sage Kanva, Vedanta Desikar, Manavala Maamunigal, Azhwars and Ramanuja. There are separate shrines for Venugopala housing Bhama and Rukmini, and Rama housing Sita, Lakshmana and Hanuman. There are a number of smaller shrines and halls in the precincts of the temple. There are three temple tanks associated with the temple namely Chakra Theertha, Sundari Theertha and Sanathkumara Theertha.

It was built . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 July 2000.  History  The South Sea Islander Church and Hall were built on the Fairymead sugar plantation to cater to the spiritual needs of the South Sea Islander population, many of whom were labourers on the plantation. The church and hall were removed from the Fairymead site in 1995 and relocated to a section of the Bundaberg Cemetery where many South Sea Islander people have been buried. The land on which the Fairymead plantation was established was originally part of the cattle property \\"Tantitha\\". The owners of the property, A and AH Brown sold it to the Young family. Trading as AH and E Young, Arthur, Horace and Ernest Young harvested their first cane crop in 1882. Juice was punted to Millaquin until Fairymead became a complete sugar mill in 1884. Fairymead was floated into a public company, Fairymead Sugar Company, in 1912. Florence Young, sister of Fairymead's founders, was secretary of the Queensland Kanaka Mission (QKM). Young ran religious and educational classes for Islanders and later did missionary work in the Pacific and Asia. In October 1895, it was reported that in Bundaberg the \\"... largest plantations, are Messrs. Gibson Bros, Bingera and Fairymead, the property of H and E Young\\". It was also reported that the \\"religious education [of the South Sea Islander plantation workers] is well looked after, and on the leading plantations churches and schools have been specifically provided for them ... Christianity is spreading amongst them, and making its influence felt...\\". Florence Young was born in October 1856. Settling in Sydney in 1878, after the death of her parents she moved to Fairymead in 1882. Almost immediately, Young began to hold prayer meetings for planters' families. Young conducted classes in pidgin English, using pictures, biblical phrases and a chrysalis to explain resurrection. Under Young's guidance, the Queensland Kanaka Mission (QKM) was formally established at Fairymead in 1886 as an evangelical and non-denominational church. The QKM aimed to prepare South Sea Islanders for membership of established Christian churches after their repatriation and employed paid missionaries and members of Young's family. At its height in 1904-1905, the QKM engaged nineteen missionaries and 118 unpaid \\"native teachers\\" and claimed 2150 conversions. Young also established the South Sea Evangelical Mission (SSEM), which became a branch of the QKM in 1904. Florence Young administered the SSEM from Sydney and Katoomba and made annual visits to the islands until 1926. As early as 1889, Queensland Government Inspector Caulfield believed the behaviour of several South Sea Islanders had been improved by religious teaching. One employer at first sceptical of her plans, later told Young that the lessons kept the boys on the plantation on Saturdays whereas they had formerly gone to town to drink. It has been suggested that plantation owners probably extracted as much material as possible from the missionaries' work, in categorising them as a stabilising factor in a society which viewed the repercussions of activities in town with trepidation, but it could be said that the missionaries may well have reduced the level of tension created by the presence of an alien element in Bundaberg society. The church and hall were constructed on the Fairymead plantation, replacing an earlier hall. The buildings were constructed after the departure of Young from Bundaberg, who continued to travel to the islands and spent much time in Katoomba, administering the South Sea Evangelical Mission. They are, nevertheless, reminders of the continued influence of Christian Missionaries and their work in the Bundaberg area. The South Sea Islander Church and Hall were moved to their present location in 1995 when a portion of the Bundaberg Cemetery was set aside for historical and cultural purposes. The church and hall continue to be utilised by the South Sea Islander community and remain as a tangible link between the community and the experiences of their ancestors.  Description  Church interior, 2000 The South Sea Islander Church is a single-storey, timber building, set on concrete stumps, with a gabled roof clad with corrugated iron. The church is clad externally with chamferboards. Louvred timber ventilators are located high in the west & east elevations (gable ends). Two sets of casement windows are located in the north & south elevations (long ends). Each window has a simple, diamond decorative motif in the central panel. There is an entry door and set of timber stairs at each end of the church in the southern elevation. Ramp access has been recently added to the church. Internally, the timber lined church has been painted white, incorporating a stained timber framework. The church houses original timber pews, timber altar and an organ. The hall is a single storey timber building, set on concrete stumps, clad with weatherboards and a gabled roof clad with corrugated iron. A pair of double hung sash windows are located in the western, eastern and southern elevations. Internally, as the cladding is single skin, the building framework is exposed. The floor is timber. A timber staircase is located on the southern side of the building. Both buildings are located within picturesque grounds, including landscaped garden beds dedicated to various families.  Heritage listing  South Sea Islander Church and Hall was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 July 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. A good, intact example of a simple missionary church and hall, the South Sea Islander Church and Hall are significant for their strong association with the South Sea Islander community and the exploitation of this large workforce employed in the Bundaberg district, one of the most affluent sugar districts in the state, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Importantly, the church and hall have a strong association for the present local South Sea Islander community and the experiences of their ancestors in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. A good, intact example of a simple missionary church and hall. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Located within picturesque grounds, including landscaped garden beds dedicated to various families, the church and hall are important for their aesthetic contribution to the site. Internally, the original timber pews, altar and organ contribute to the aesthetic significance of the church. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Moved to the site in order that they may be closer to the graves of ancestral members of the South Sea Islander community, the South Sea Islander Church and Hall are significant for their continued association with ancestral worship.

These can be seen as a direct influence on her creative directing and productions developed with the Zendeh theatre company. Career Nazli Tabatabai-Khatambakhsh was the Artistic Director of ZENDEH, a theatre company based in the North East of England that was part of Arts Council England's National Portfolio of Organisations. The company created enchanting theatre that combines poetic elements, mythology and explored global political and social perspectives in a most approachable way. Iranian myths and contemporary reference points appeared in many of ZENDEH's shows reflecting the cultural heritage of Artistic director Nazli Tabatabai- Khatambakhsh. Although the work itself often rejects cultural representation instead creating a more impressionistic, magical realism, visual and physical style of theatre. ZENDEH often explore hidden histories and modern identities; finding the compelling and epic in ordinary stories and crafting culturally eclectic productions. ZENDEH's and Nazli's direction and artistic practice is collaborative; working with artists and the wider public, combining art forms and using digital technologies to continually find imaginative ways to share stories and find human connections. Over Nazli's career she has developed a strong leadership role in producing diverse theatre in the UK in particular looking at themes of the Middle East and the lives of women. Achievements Nazli Tabatabai-Khatambakhsh through the 10+ years as Artistic Director with ZENDEH has developed a unique multi-staged method of creating theatrical productions that is relevant to 21st Century Britain. The ZENDEH method encompasses seven stages that includes, but is not restricted to, blue sky thinking; collaboration in multidisciplinary art forms and working with a wide range of associate artists; emphasis on dramaturgy; and re-approaching joint authorship with participation, engagement and research. Nazli Tabatabai- Khatambakhsh also leads on the Creative Case North, which is a re-imagining of Arts Council England’s approach to diversity and equality, setting out how these areas can and should enrich the arts for artists, audiences and wider society.

The book received favorable reviews from critics. Background Daly City, California had a population of approximately 35,000 Filipinos. The Immigration Act of 1965 had significantly increased the influx of Filipinos in the city. Content The ethnographic study Pinoy Capital was part of the Asian American History and Culture series from the Temple University Press. For his research, Vergara conducted interviews and analyzed newspaper and journal articles alongside books written previously on the subject. The book consists of eight chapters: A Repeated Turning, Little Manila, Looking Forward: Narratives of Obligation, Spreading the News: Newspapers and Transnational Belonging, Looking Back: Indifference, Responsibility, and the Anti-Marcos Movement in the United States, Betrayal and Belonging, Citizenship and Nostalgia, and Pinoy Capital. The book provides details about the city's history from the early 20th century. Following World War II, Daly City witnessed its transition into a \\"poorly-planned suburbia\\". It also discusses the role of media in shaping the notion of \\"belonging\\" to the mother country. The most prominent newspaper for the community was The Philippine News, which served as a forum for resisting the dictatorial regime of Ferdinand Marcos; popular TV networks include The Filipino Channel (ABS–CBN); and Filipinas magazine is also headquartered in Daly City. Findings Vergara reported that the median household income of Filipinos in Daly City was greater than the average national income in the United States. Moreover, instead of being called Filipino-American, a significant part of the community preferred to be identified as Filipinos. A major issue faced by Filipinos residing in the United States was their need to strike a balance between their relation to the two nations. In 2009, remittances sent by the foreign-employed Filipinos comprised 10% of the total GDP of the Philippines. Filipinos holding American citizenship by birthright are thought to have \\"lost their traditional Filipino values\\". A considerable number of interviewees cited reuniting with family as their motive for migrating to the United States. Reception Writing for Philippine Quarterly of Culture and Society, John A. Peterson called the work \\"an intriguing and empathic study of Filipinos in Daly City\\". Kimberly Alidio (Journal of American Ethnic History) opined \\"Pinoy Capital is significant for its attention to ... nuances of contemporary immigration\\". Emily Noelle Ignacio of the University of Washington, Tacoma (Contemporary Sociology) called Vergara's work an \\"[accomplishment]\\". She further points out that the word Capital used in the book's title might possibly have two meanings; one referring to Daly City as an ideal destination for emigrating Filipinos and the other being the economic benefits to the Philippines from these migrants. Ignacio praised the book by calling it \\"rich in empirical material meticulously situated and adeptly analyzed\\" and an \\"important contribution to sociological studies\\" on topics ranging from nationalism to ethnicity. Linda España-Maram (The Western Historical Quarterly) wrote that the work was \\"significant in the way that Vergara unpacks questions related to socioeconomic standing\\".

Inebny/Amenemnekhu was viceroy of Kush, therefore one of the most important officials at the royal court, ruling the Nubian provinces (Kush is the Ancient Egyptian name for Nubia). Inebny/Amenemnekhu is first attested in year 18 of the queen; a further dated inscription belongs to year 20, while around year 22/23 a certain Nehi was appointed to become viceroy of Kush. Inebny/Amenemnekhu bears two names. For a long time it was thought that these names refer to two different people. An inscription dated to year 20 under Thutmose III showed however, that both names refer to one and the same person. In inscriptions, his name is often erased, providing evidence that he felt into dishonor at the end of his career.Davies, W.V., Tombos and the Viceroy Inebny/Amenemnekhu, BMSAES (2008), 39-63 A block statue of him is stored in the British Museum (EA1131) although it is not in display.Block statue EA1131 of Inebny at the British Museum Inebny/Amenemnekhu is known from many rock inscriptions in Nubia.

The plot follows a college student who stays on campus alone over Thanksgiving break and finds herself terrorized by a cult of ritual killers. The film premiered on October 14, 2014, at the London Film Festival and also had theatrical releases internationally. In the United States, the film debuted on Lifetime on October 17, 2015, and was released on Netflix on November 5, 2015. Plot A hooded figure photographs a young woman's corpse in an empty field, followed by a montage of Internet screenshots and videos of women being killed in ritual murders by a cybercult. Footage of the murders is uploaded on an anonymous underground website where members are encouraged to \\"kill Kristy\\", a name of Latin origin meaning \\"follower of God\\". College student Justine is attending a private university in the Northeastern United States on financial aid, and is unable to afford to fly home for Thanksgiving. Her boyfriend Aaron and roommate Nicole both leave for the break, leaving Justine to spend the holiday in solitude on a nearly empty campus, aside from security guard Wayne, front gate worker Dave, and groundskeeper Scott. On Thanksgiving night, Justine uses Nicole's BMW to drive to a nearby convenience store. Inside the store, a hooded girl, Violet, compliments the car and later asks for a student discount on sunglasses at the counter. Justine offers to pay for them, but the girl refuses and calls her \\"Kristy\\". That night, Justine finds that someone has accessed her laptop, as a snuff film plays on the screen. Violet appears in the room with a boxcutter, and Justine flees. Outside, Wayne is murdered in front of her by a masked man and she finds Dave killed in his vehicle. The four cult killers assemble, and Violet begins recording Justine, telling her that they will hunt her and that she should \\"run to God\\". Justine flees to Scott's house for help. However, the killers murder his dog and hang him from a swing set in the yard. Justine attempts to call 9-1-1 from Scott's cell, but the gang has hacked it. They begin sending her video clips of herself and menacing text messages. Justine attempts to hide but is chased to the roof and cornered. She leaps from the roof but falling through the branches of a tree help break her fall. Aaron arrives and is also killed. Justine uses Aaron's car to pin one of the cult members against a wall and crush him to death. She hides in the gym's swimming pool, stabbing a second member with her car keys and drowning him. Soon after, she beats a third to death with a baseball bat. She reads a text on the dead member's phone; it is from Violet asking if he has \\"killed Kristy yet\\". Justine responds \\"yes\\" and finds photos of the cult's other victims, with their declaration to kill the \\"Kristys\\" of the world: pure, beautiful, and privileged women who they believe follow God. Justine uses pool chemicals to create a flammable powder. She dresses herself in the dead man's mask and jacket, and approaches the car where Violet is. Justine informs Violet that the others are dead, and when Violet comes toward her, Justine douses her with the flammable powder, burning Violet alive. Justine photographs Violet's corpse with the cellphone and uploads it to the website. A montage at the end reveals that a series of similar cult murders have occurred in other states and cities but with Justine's testimony and access to the phone, many of the cult's members have been arrested. A post-credits scene shows a young woman being attacked by another cult killer outside her home, but the attacker is stopped by another masked individual.

The chapel was designed by John Loughborough Pearson, and was built 1891-92, and though already in use, the interiors weren’t completed until 1929, overseen by his son Frank Loughborough Pearson. The chapel was built in the central courtyard of the former Middlesex Hospital, which was rebuilt in 1929-35 and subsequently demolished in 2008-15. The chapel was retained and it now stands in the Pearson Square development. The chapel is a Grade II* listed building, noted for its opulent Gothic Revival style and opulent mosaic interior. History The chapel standing isolated during demolition of the Middlesex Hospital (2011) Entrance to the Fitzrovia Chapel on Fitzroy Place The Fitzrovia Chapel was built in 1891-92 within the central courtyard of the Middlesex Hospital. Between 1929 and 1935, the decaying 18th-century hospital building was gradually demolished and rebuilt around the chapel. After a merger with University College Hospital, the Middlesex Hospital was completely demolished 2008-15 and replaced with a new residential development. The Grade II* chapel was retained throughout the demolition. Today the chapel stands within Pearson Square, a privately owned public space of Jones Lang LaSalle, which was named after the chapel's architect. Architecture The chapel is noted as a fine example of Gothic Revival architecture, designed by John Loughborough Pearson in an Italian Gothic style. The interior of the chapel features a rib vaulted ceiling decorated richly with much use of polychrome marble and mosaics. The mosaics were completed by Maurice Richard Josey in the 1930s, assisted by his son John L. Josey. The ceiling mosaic work consists of blue stars against a gold background representing the firmament. The wall mosaics are lined with green onyx and a zigzag pattern. In the arched chancel area there is a Cosmatesque pillar piscina. Set into an ogee arch is an aumbry adorned with an image of the Pelican in her Piety carved in white marble which was installed in memory of Prince Francis of Teck, the brother of Queen Mary, who died in 1910. Set into roundels beneath the arches are sculpted busts of the Twelve Apostles and the Old Testament prophets. At the west end, the organ gallery is surmounted by an arch decorated by a mosaic inscription of words from the Gloria in excelsis Deo. The baptismal font is carved from a solid block of green marble and is adorned with the symbols presenting the Four Evangelists. The inscription, \\"Nipson anomemata me monan opsin\\", is a palindrome in Ancient Greek that was inscribed on a holy water font outside the church of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople in medieval times: Unusually, the chapel is aligned approximately on a North-South axis instead of the more traditional aligmnent towards liturgical east.

It is a secular chapel and is a venue for non-religious ceremonies such as weddings, civil partnerships, baby namings and memorials. The foundation has a licence from Westminster Council to conduct civil marriages and to supply alcohol.  Exhibitions and events  The chapel is also used by artists, galleries and art organisations for exhibitions. In May 2017, the Horiuchi Foundation presented a series of photographs at the chapel by Tomohiro Muda. The exhibition was called Icons of Time: Memories of the Tsunami that Struck Japan. Richard Ingleby Gallery hosted an exhibition during Frieze London in October 2017. Artists David Batchelor, Jonathan Owen, Kevin Harman and Peter Liversdge were included in it. In July 2017, Erskine, Hall & Coe presented Claudi Casanovas’s Minvant at the chapel. In 2016, the TJ Boulting gallery hosted Stephanie Quayle's Jenga at the Fitzrovia Chapel and in December 2017, Siân Davey's Looking for Alice. As part of Frieze London, the Stephen Friedman Gallery has showed works by Yinka Shonibare MBE and Jonathan Baldock at the chapel. In January 2019, photographer Richard Ansett presented his portrait of the artist Grayson Perry at the chapel. It was called Birth and depicted Perry's alter ego, Claire. The Fitzrovia Chapel has been used by recording artists including Katie Melua, Allman Brown and the Vickers Bovey Guitar Duo. Fashion brands have used the chapel as a backdrop to shows, shoots and presentations. These have included Phoebe English, Alistair James, Mother of Pearl, Alighieri and Sharon Wauchob.  The Ward  Leading up to World AIDS Day in 2017, the chapel presented its first exhibition. Called The Ward, it followed the lives of four young men on the Broderip and Charles Bell wards in London’s former Middlesex Hospital. The Broderip was the first AIDS ward in London and was opened by Diana, Princess of Wales in 1987, this year marking the thirtieth anniversary of its opening. The photographer was Gideon Mendel who chronicled the wards in 1993. The exhibition was featured in The British Journal of Photography, Wallpaper, The Guardian, AnOther Magazine and on BBC News. Nina Hamnett - 'Everybody was Furious' The chapel's exhibition in 2019 focused on the Welsh artist (and former resident of Fitzrovia) Nina Hamnett. The exhibition was called Nina Hamnett - 'Everybody was Furious'. It featured little known pieces from Tenby Museum & Art Gallery, the town where the artist was born.  Portraits of NHS Heroes  Artist Tom Croft created a virtual exhibition (installed and scanned observing Covid-19 government guidelines) at the Fitzrovia Chapel, showcasing portraits of NHS staff created during the coronavirus crisis. Portraits for NHS Heroes includes work by 15 artists, all members of the Contemporary British Portrait Painters. The tour is available online.  Opening times  Each Wednesday between 11:00 and 16:00, the chapel is open to the public for visiting, quiet contemplation and reflection. There is no charge and booking is not required. There are volunteers on hand to answer questions. The chapel offers an audio presentation on selected Wednesdays called Wireless Contemplation. They are linked to culturally significant themes which are important to the heritage of Fitzrovia. These have included a celebration of Dylan and Caitlin Thomas, Virginia Woolf, Oscar Wilde and Paul Verlaine. It is a chance to sit and reflect out of the distraction of the everyday. Details of these events are on the chapel website.

He was born in Middlesbrough, then in Yorkshire, and died in Birmingham. Scorer was an amateur right-handed batsman and right-arm fast-medium bowler who played for Warwickshire's second eleven before the First World War. He began playing for Warwickshire's first eleven in June 1921 and then appeared in virtually all the matches to the end of that season, with occasional days of success as a lower middle-order batsman and a part-time bowler. Against Hampshire at Edgbaston, he made 113, his only century, in a game that also included Freddie Calthorpe's highest score. A month later, he finished off Somerset's first innings by taking the last three wickets in five overs for the cost of just a single run, and these were his best bowling figures. Scorer returned for about half of Warwickshire's matches in 1922, but had less success, his highest score being just 35. He returned again briefly in 1926 for three games, with no success at all. He retained his links with cricket and during the Second World War was the organiser of festival cricket across the Midlands, which, according to his obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, led to him being the first person ever to speak over a public address system at a cricket match.

He was born in Chilvers Coton, Warwickshire, and died in Nuneaton, also in Warwickshire. Sanders was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler who played as a professional. He first appeared in first-class cricket in the 1928 season and was identified in the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack report on Warwickshire for that season as \\"a player of real promise\\". He played in a dozen matches that season and against Northamptonshire he took four first-innings wickets for 44 runs and these were the best bowling figures of his career: he never achieved five wickets in an innings. Sanders was again an irregular player in the 1929 season, but in both 1930 and 1931 he held a regular place in the Warwickshire side, though his batting and bowling figures indicate that he rarely made the headlines. In 1930, he had his only days of batting success. Against Yorkshire, batting at No 11, he joined Reg Santall with Warwickshire still 30 runs short of avoiding an innings defeat and proceeded to hit 54 in a last-wicket partnership of 128 that was a Warwickshire record at the time. Four weeks later, under less pressure in the first innings of a run-heavy match, Sanders and Santall all but repeated the feat, putting on 126 for the ninth wicket against Nottinghamshire, and Sanders' 64 was his highest score. He maintained his place in the team throughout 1931, but his bowling was not effective, with just 29 wickets in his 23 games at the high average of 43.93 runs per wicket. After that, Sanders' first-class cricket career petered out. In both 1932 and 1933, he was again an infrequent player and he played his last first-class game in 1934, though he was in the Warwickshire second eleven up to 1937.

The offensive was held between 25 March and 5 May 1945 using the forces of the 2nd Ukrainian Front to capture the capital of Slovakia, Bratislava, and the capital of Moravia, Brno.  Background  In the spring of 1945, the Red Army launched a major offensive on the southern wing of the Eastern Front. On 10 March, the 4th Ukrainian Front began the Moravian-Ostrava Offensive, and on 15 March 3rd Ukrainian Front began the Vienna Offensive. The 2nd Ukrainian Front, which was located between the 3rd and 4th Ukrainian Fronts, was assigned the mission to capture Bratislava and Brno.  The offensive = Advance to Bratislava  At the beginning of the offensive the 7th Guards Army, in a surprise night attack, broke through defenses of German 153rd and 357th Infantry Divisions on the river Hron. The breakthrough had a width of and within two days the army had advanced about west to Nové Zámky. Then the 7th Guards Army quickly rushed across the Danubian Lowland towards Bratislava. The advance of 53rd Army in the central Slovakia was slower due to the hilly terrain and the movement of the 40th Army in the mountains was even slower. However, on 26 March 1945 the Romanian 4th Army liberated Banská Bystrica, the centre of the Slovak National Uprising, defeated in the previous year. On 2 April the battle of Bratislava started when the Soviet units captured the Airport in Vajnory. President Tiso and the government of the puppet Slovak State had already left the capital and by 5 April found asylum in Austrian monastery of Kremsmünster. The defense of Bratislava consisted of units of the German 6th Army and Hungarian 3rd Army. On the night of 3 April, Germans destroyed all major bridges over the Danube. With the support of the 27th Tank Brigade and the Danube Flotilla, Soviet soldiers of the 23rd Rifle Corps and the 25th Guards Rifle Corps (both part of the 7th Guards Army) pushed German troops out of the city. Bratislava was captured by the evening of 4 April in the second week of the operation. The city districts on the south bank of the Danube were captured the next day by 46th Army. This army too was part of the 2nd Ukrainian Front, but because it fought on other side of the Danube River, for most of the time it took part in the Vienna Offensive of the 3rd Ukrainian Front. For the liberation of Bratislava the 46th Army contributed its 10th Guards Rifle Corps. The Czechoslovak government and president then moved to Bratislava on 8 May.  Morava crossing  The next main obstacle to further Soviet advance was the Slovak-Moravian border created by the Morava river, which in the area (between Devín and Hodonín) was surrounded by riparian forests and wetland. In the springtime the flooded area was up to wide. Despite this, on 6 April the first reconnaissance units of the 6th Guards Cavalry Corps crossed the river and the next day they secured the damaged bridge and railway embankment, which was the only way above water. The heavy battle for the town of Lanžhot lasted for four days, where the strong German defense was strengthened by more than 60 tanks, including the Tiger II heavy tank. Lanžhot was finally liberated on 11 April, but 25% of its houses were completely destroyed and another 60% were damaged. Soviet cavalry lost nearly 1,500 men and 2,000 horses, mostly as the result of long immersion in cold water. The 53rd Army had crossed Morava river near Hodonín which was liberated early on 13 April. The 53rd Army lost about 350 men during the crossing, while the German army about 130 men. At the time, the 40th Army on the right flank was still fighting in Slovak mountains. On 10 April the Army liberated the town of Trenčín and managed to cross the Váh River south of the town despite all bridges being destroyed by retreating German troops. Trenčín then became \\"front city\\" and its districts behind the river were not liberated until 29 April.  Battle of Ořechov  After the breakthrough at river Morava Soviet units of 7th Mechanized Corps swiftly advanced to Jihlava river where they met the German division Feldherrnhalle. On 18 April the commander of Army Group Centre ordered to abolish the \\"Festung Brno\\" and to encounter the enemy on the approaches to the city. The Soviet advance was stopped at the town Rajhrad south of Brno. The Soviet units however continued further west and by 10pm of the same day they reached the church of small village Ořechov, less than 12 km from the outskirt of Brno, which thus became within the range of Soviet artillery. The reconnaissance units of the 7th Mechanized Corps penetrated further north-west and captured several villages, including the village Popůvky. Some of the Soviet light tanks even reached the outskirt of Brno but were soon destroyed. Because the Feldherrnhalle division was behind the Jihlava river and this area was defended only by SS training units and Volksturm, the tanks of 16th Panzer-Division were called for the assistance in counterattack. In the evening of 19 April, German tanks and assault guns quickly penetrated the lines of exhausted Soviet soldiers, by fire at close range destroyed many Soviet tanks and recaptured the village Ořechov and the hillock with church. The next day, 20 April, German tanks of 16th Panzer- Division attacked towards the tanks of Feldherrnhalle division and together cut off and surrounded the Soviet reconnaissance at Popůvky. But the Germans did not have enough strength to completely destroy the encircled Soviets. Moreover, the commander of 16th Panzer-Division was captured by Czech partisans which badly affected its coordination with other German units. In the night 23/24 April, the 7th Mechanized Corps launched new attack and relieved the encircled units, the next day once more liberated Ořechov. The battle of Ořechov lasted seven days and was the greatest tank battle in the history of Moravia. The Red Army had lost 960 men and 35 armored vehicles, Germans had lost about 275–300 men and about 30 armored vehicles, the village Ořechov had suffered 23 casualties and 80% of houses destroyed.Soviet American- built M4 Sherman medium tank in Brno, April 1945  Liberation of Brno  The new Soviet assault was supported by 6th Guards Tank Army which had just arrived to the rear of 53rd Army after the fall of Vienna. While the 1st Guards Mechanized Cavalry Group renewed its attack on Brno, the 53rd Army launched the attack east of Brno, advancing towards Šlapanice and Slavkov. The army's advance broke through the German lines and the 6th Guards Tank Army advanced through the gap in the evening of 23 April. By the evening of 25 April the army's tanks reached the outskirts of Brno from the east, while the Mechanized Cavalry Group reached Brno from the south. The next morning the city centre was liberated and by noon also the Špilberk Castle, which until then served as the Brno Gestapo prison. Brno was liberated on 26 April 1945, but some of its northern districts were in German hands until 5 May. In the days following the liberation, armies of 2nd Ukrainian Front secured the western front line and expanded northwards to meet the forces of 4th Ukrainian Front and thus to outflank the German 1st Panzer Army. However, after the outbreak of Prague uprising Stavka changed the orders and the 2nd Ukrainian Front joined the Prague Offensive. Meanwhile, both the Romanian 1st and 4th armies advanced along the Morava River and before the end of the war liberated the towns of Otrokovice, Kroměříž, and Prostějov. The Red Army cemetery in Ořechov, where 1,452 Soviet soldiers are interred.  Aftermath  During the offensive, Soviet forces had suffered casualties of nearly 17,000 killed. Soviet sources reported that they had destroyed nine German divisions. The offensive had reportedly created conditions for the Prague Offensive as it enabled to outflank the Army Group Centre from the south. Within the Soviet 53rd Army was also attached Czechoslovak Special Purpose Company. Its only purpose was to capture and secure the buildings in Brno for the needs of Czechoslovak government. However, because of the rapid end of war the government had relocated from Bratislava directly to Prague on 10 May. President Edvard Beneš spent almost one week in the liberated Brno before he joined the government in Prague.

TMM later took legal action against TEC for breach of its patent in its manufacturing of machine tools. TEC ultimately decided to enter into a licensing agreement with TMM rather than fight the matter in court, and on 02 April 1938, they entered into the following settlement agreement: \\"If in any month during the continuance of the said License the aggregate quantity of contract material sold or used by TECO and Industrial (other than contract material supplied to TECO by the Grantors or any Licensees under the said patents) shall exceed a quota of 50 kilograms (50 Kg) TECO shall whether all or any of such material shall be subject to royalty hereunder or not pay to the Grantors compensation equal to thirty percent.

Following the failed assassination attempt on the leader in July 1944 Kurt Adams was one of several thousand high-profile non- Nazis arrested and detained by the government during August. He died a couple of months later at the Buchenwald concentration camp. Life Kurt Adams was born at the tail end of 1889. His father was a merchant. He attended two secondary schools, first the \\"Vor dem Lübeckertor Realschule\\" and then the \\"auf der Uhlenhorst Realschule\\", before progressing to university. His university level studies took him to universities in Göttingen, Freiburg, the Humboldt (Berlin) and Greifswald. Subjects studied were German, French and History. He received his doctorate in 1912 for a dissertation entitled \\"Otto Ludwig´s Theories on Drama\\". The next year he took a job with the Hamburg City Schools Service, also teaching at the Albrecht-Thaer School, and became committed to the cause of education reform. Adams remained an energetic member of the city Schools Service till 1929. In October 1928 he took over headship of the Hamburg People's Academy from Rudolf Roß. Kurt Adams joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD) while still a student. Between 1924 and 1933 he was a member of the Hamburg Parliament. More than once he stood for election to the national Reichstag, but his name was towards the bottom of the SPD party list and he was never elected. He took a particular interest in education and was a member of various education related committees and groupings including the \\"Working Group of SPD Teachers\\" (\\"Arbeitsgemeinschaft sozialdemokratischer Lehrer\\") of which he was chairman locally, becoming known as one of the Hamburg SPD's leading education experts. He also headed up the Hamburg \\"Kinderfreundebewegung\\" (literally \\"Children's friends' movement\\"). Politics Following Régime change in January 1933, the new government lost little time in moving towards one-party government. Adams was threatened with the loss of his position in the Schools Service as a result of the so-called Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, passed in April 1933. He therefore announced his resignation from the SPD to the local party leadership, but he nevertheless lost his job on 232 June 1933. He faced a call from the newly appointed Hamburg Nazi Gauleiter, Karl Kaufmann to renounce his political convictions, but did not do so. Kurt Adams was succeeded as head of the Hamburg People's Academy by . After losing his public service employment Adam worked briefly for a cinema news-sheet, before taking on a small coffee distribution business in Hamburg's Nikolaifleet (in the city's old harbour quarter). The coffee business brought him into contact with a number of politically like-minded individuals, and his little trading office quickly became a Hamburg meeting point for SPD and Communists, whose party activities had become illegal in 1933. Adams was able to help fellow victims of Nazi persecution, including and Rudolf Klug. In addition to coffee, the little business became a distribution point for illegal political leaflets, some of which Adams himself distributed, using his bicycle. Death Registration card of Kurt Adams as a prisoner at Buchenwald Nazi Concentration Camp On 20 July 1944 an assassination attempt was made against Adolf Hitler. The dictator survived, but his regime had already prepared a list of several thousand names, to be used in the event of an escalation in political tension on the home front, and the name of Kurt Adams was on it. In the context of the wave of arrests known as \\"Aktion Gitter\\", on 24 August 1944 Kurt Adams was arrested at Greiz, where he was staying with relatives while recuperating from a serious operation earlier in the year. He was taken to Gera nearby. Four days later he was taken to the Buchenwald concentration camp, which was already overcrowded, with approximately 84,000 detainees. On his arrival he was immediately recognized by other inmates, whose reactions to his arrival identified him to the guards. He was separated out and placed in a sub-camp where the condition of the accommodation, food and hygiene were massively worse than in the main camp. He quickly weakened and became ill: from later reports provided by fellow detainees he appears to have caught pneumonia, and was taken, on 15 September 1944, to the camp hospital where he received treatment and his condition may have improved. However, he was soon discharged back to the camp. The family received two more letters from him, in the second of which, dated 26 September 1944, he wrote that he was getting better. However, on 5 October 1944 he lost consciousness, and he died, probably of meningitis, on 7 October 1944. Recognition *Kurt Adams Square (\\"Kurt- Adams-Platz\\") in Hamburg's Lohbrügge quarter was named to commemorate and honour Adams *In the German Democratic Republic, in 1958, a postage stamp was issued featuring a portrait of Kurt Adams. *On 8 June 2012 a series of individual memorial tablets were unveiled in front of the Hamburg City Hall for murdered members of the Hamburg Parliament. One of these was for Kurt Adams. Another tablet, similar in style but more succinct in content, is set at the entrance to Terminal 2 of the city airport.

Constructed in the Dravida style and rock cut architecture, the temple is believed to have been built during the 9th century by Muttaraiyar kings, the cardinals of Pallavas, with later expansion from the Cholas. The rock-cut architecture is an early example of Cholan Art, continuing the tradition of the Pallavas. The other portions of Narthamalai houses the 8th century Jaina Abode, the Aluruttimalai Jain Caves. There are also two rock-cut caves, one of which houses twelve life size sculptures of Vishnu. The temple is considered one of the oldest stone temples in South India. The temple is maintained and administered by Department of Archaeological Survey of India as a protected monument. History Image of pilasters on the lower part of the vimana Narthamalai was originally called Nagaratharmalai on account of the business men (called Nagarathar in Tamil) who were active in business in the Trichy - Pudukottai - Madurai regions. The Nagarathars are attributed to the major contributions in terms of the canals, temples and religious establishments in the region. Narthamalai was ruled from the 7th to 9th centuries by the Mutharaiyars who were feudatories of the Pallavas. The region was later captured by Medieval Cholas. Though the temple is called Vijayalaya Choleeswaram, the temple was originally built by Muttaraiyar lieutenant, Sattan Paliyili, during the seventh regnal year of Pallava king Nripatungavarman during 862 CE. As per some accounts, the temple is believed to have been built by the first king of Medieval Cholas, Vijayalaya Chola (848- 891 CE), but the view is highly debated. As per the inscriptions, immediately after the construction, the temple was damaged by rains and lightning. The restoration work was carried out by Tennavan Tamiladirayan. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by archaeological department of India as a protected monument. Architecture View of Narthamalai temple from the hilltop The temple is located in Narthamalai, a rockyhill in Pudukottai district in southern Tamil Nadu. The other portions of Narthamalai houses the 8th century Jaina Abode, the Aluruttimalai Jain Caves. There are also two rock-cut caves, one of which houses twelve life size sculptures of Vishnu. The temple is considered one of the oldest stone temples in South India. The central shrine is surrounded by eight shrines, out of which six are still present. The main shrine faces West and the sanctum houses the image of Lingam, the aniconic representation of Shiva. The walls of the sanctum are plain, unlike later Chola temples that have niches to house different images. The sanctum is approached through an Arthamandapa, a hall supported by pillars. The pillars are ornamental with rectangular shape in the bottom and the top and octagonal shape in the middle. The vimana, the shrine over the sanctum has a semi-spherical shape having four storeys. The sanctum is guarded by Dvarapalas on either sides. The inscriptions are made on the base of the Dvarapalas. There are also two rock- cut caves, one of which houses twelve life size sculptures of Vishnu. The two circular pilasters with circular shafts on four sides of the vimana indicates the antiquity of the temple. The feature is possibly termed Vrittasputitas in silpa texts like Shilparatna. Such a feature is otherwise found only in few other temples like Neyyadiappar Temple, Tillaistanam, Tiruttalinathar Temple in Thiruputhur, central shrine in Moovar Koil in Kodumbalur, Anantheswara temple in Udayarkudi and Kampaheswarar Temple, Thirubuvanam.

It is believed that the temple was the inspiration for the Gangaikonda Cholesvarar Temple built by Rajendra Chola I (1014-44 CE). The sanctum (garbhagriha) has four storeys in Omkara, shape of Hindu symbol Om. There were originally eight subsidiary shrines around the temple, out of which six are still existing. Each of them is identical with a semi-spherical top and a four pillared Madapa in the front. The Vimana, the shrine over the sanctum has sculptures of Uma, Shiva, Dakshinamurthy and Saptamatrikas. The individual images retrieved from the place are maintained in the Pudukottia Government Museum. The temple is the foremost structural of the Chola kings, who would later on go on to make Great Living Chola Temples in the next 300 years, declared as UNESCO as a World Heritage Sites. The temple is first among South Indian temples to incorporate dravida and Vasara styles to be incorporated in the vimana.

It was designed by Lange Leopold Powell and built from 1931 to . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 August 2004.  History  The original St Andrew's Presbyterian Church, circa 1930 St Andrews Uniting Church, Bundaberg was erected in 1932 as St Andrew's Presbyterian Church and replaced an earlier Presbyterian church erected on the site in 1882. The land had been purchased in 1881 and was held in trust by three senior members of the congregation on behalf of the Presbyterian Church in Bundaberg. The 1932 church was built largely with funds generated by the Bundaberg Presbyterian community. In 1925, the Bundaberg Presbyterian Women's Guild opened a New Church Fund and over the next six years worked with other Church organizations including the Committee of Management and the Girls Auxiliary to raise £3,500. Additional fund raising generated another £2,000 over a six-month period in 1931. The final funds were obtained through a loan of £3,500 through the Grand Trustees of the Protestant Alliance Friendly Society. The ability of the Presbyterian congregation of Bundaberg to quickly raise such large sums highlights the relative prosperity of the district's sugar industry during the 1920s, which was sustained into the 1930s. However, construction of the church in the early 1930s was also a local work-generating scheme during a time of economic depression. The Church adopted a deliberate policy to ensure that funds for the construction of the church were spent on local labour and materials; by completion it was estimated that 75% of the construction budget had been spent locally. Prominent Brisbane architect Lange L. Powell designed St Andrew's Presbyterian Church. Powell had designed a number of important structures in Queensland including the Brisbane Masonic Temple and was highly regarded by the time he designed St Andrew's. Powell described St Andrew's as being designed in \\"broad free gothic style that was reminiscent of the Fourteenth Century\\", moderated to allow for the sub- tropical climate. All the windows in the bays could be opened and the eaves were carried clear of the main supports to ensure adequate circulation of air. The design and orientation of the church was also developed to maximize the location and setting. On a corner block directly across the road from Buss Park and the Anglican Church, Powell orientated the Church along Maryborough Street rather than facing it. This maximized the view of the lateral facade and ensured that the tower on the eastern side dominated. The design was well received by the community and local headlines on the day on which the Church was dedicated read \\"Latest Addition to Bundaberg Architecture\\". The local press also emphasized that Powell had spent some of his childhood in Bundaberg while his father had served as the town's Methodist Minister. The Queensland Moderator of the Presbyterian Church set the foundationstone during St Andrew's golden jubilee celebrations on 24 October 1931. Powell supervised the construction of the church, which was undertaken by building contractor Cornelius Johannes Vandenberg. The Church was opened and dedicated on 3 September 1932. The total cost was reported as more than £12,000. Lange Powell designed some of the furniture for the Church and a drive was launched to obtain sponsors for the various pieces and fittings. Many of the internal furnishings were made from silky oak. The three rows of seats on the dais were designed for comfort and a number of variations were considered before the final version was selected. There are also two elaborately carved chairs, one for the Moderator at Communion Services, the other at the pulpit. The communion table and the pulpit itself were also of elaborate design and included panels that bore carved emblems of the Presbyterian Church. The baptismal font had been previously gifted to the community and was transferred from the 1882 church. The carillon tower was dedicated as a memorial to those members of St Andrew's community who died during the First World War. Such memorials were an important feature of the interwar era as communities came to terms with the loss of significant numbers of young men. This loss was compounded by the absence of graves to visit and at which to commemorate. The Tower contains a \\"Peal of Bells\\", the largest of which (the tenor bell) bears the symbol of the burning bush. The tower bells were manufactured by John Taylor & Co in Loughborough, England, and were donated by Miss Amy Ethel Maud Peirson in memory of deceased members of her family. At the time of its construction St Andrew's reputedly was the first Presbyterian Church in Australia, and one of only seven Presbyterian Churches in the world, to have a carillon. It was also believed to be the first Presbyterian Church in Australia to have a bell that bore the Presbyterian symbol of the burning bush. The bells have since become a local feature and their ring can be heard throughout the central business district and surrounding suburbs. In the early 1970s the congregation of St Andrew's Presbyterian Church at Bundaberg considered whether to join the Union of Churches that was to become the Uniting Church in Australia. After some debate, the majority of parishioners voted in favour of the proposal, with the official Church Union taking place in 1977. A contingent of the congregation voted to continue as Presbyterian. Lacking sufficient numbers to retain St Andrew's, they relocated to a smaller former Methodist Church. In 2004, the church was sold to the Seventh Day Adventist Church.  Description  Exterior of St Andrew's Church, 1932 Interior of St Andrew's Church, 1932 St Andrew's Uniting Church at Bundaberg is a substantial brick church located in the heart of the city, at the corner of Maryborough and Woongarra Streets, opposite Buss Park. Designed in the Gothic style, the body of the church is cruciform in shape and is positioned north-south such that the sanctuary faces north. The building is constructed of variegated and multi-coloured bricks, with decorative cement dressings on the external walls. The roof is clad with fibrous-cement tiles. The building is laid on a cement foundation and its maximum overall dimensions are . A carillon tower of \\"battlement design\\", attached to the eastern side of the building, dominates the building. The tower measures in height and slightly tapers toward the top. Each face of the tower has decorative arched openings and is crowned with the cross of St Andrew on the middle battlement. The tower contains a carillon, or set of bells, one of which bears the emblem of the burning bush and a dedication to the memory of members of the Pierson family. A First World War Honour Board is located in the tower entry and later memorials have been added. At the southern end of the church is the official main entry. Above the entry is a large stained glass window that consists of four large panels crowned by seven crosses; the whole arrangement is set within an arch. There are six stained glass windows along either side of the nave, set between the buttresses. Exposed arched trusses in dark stained pine support the roof structure and dominate the internal ceiling. The dais contains a number of wooden furnishings have been carved from silky oak timber. The furnishings include purpose-designed furniture including three rows of seats, two elaborately carved chairs for the Moderator at Communion Services and the pulpit, the communion table, and the pulpit. There are two vestries on either side of the dais, one for the Minister on the eastern side, the other for the choir on the western side. Behind the dais is a tracery plaster panel that screens the pipes of the organ. Above this are three small trefoil shaped stained glass windows in a triangular shaped setting. The eastern and southern boundaries of the property are marked by a low stone fence, with a small roofed gate (reminiscent of a lych gate) at the corner where the two boundaries meet. The gate is made of the same stone as the fence and has a fibrous-cement tiled roof. Gardens have been established along the sides and southern end of the church. These consist of garden beds along the base of the walls, low set shrubs and a number of small trees. These help to reinforce links with the neighboring Buss Park. The grounds also contain a former Manse (1957) and a Christian Education Centre (1968). The Manse it is a low set brick structure to the west of the Church. It has been modified in recent years for offices and is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. The Christian Education Centre is in very close proximity to northern end of the church; it is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance.  Heritage listing  St Andrews Uniting Church was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 August 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. St Andrew's Church demonstrates the pattern of Queensland history as the scale and quality of the community-funded building highlights the relative prosperity of the Bundaberg district during the Great Depression of the early 1930s. The funds for the construction were largely raised through community donation, with a substantial percentage raised at a time when other parts of Queensland were economically depressed. The expenditure associated with the construction of the Church was also deliberately focused upon the Bundaberg district to ensure its construction brought local economic benefits and employment opportunities. It further demonstrates the pattern of Queensland history, as the carillon tower of the Church is an example of a community-based memorial for those who died in military service during the First World War. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. St Andrew's Church is an uncommon heritage place as it is believed to be the first Presbyterian Church in Australia to have a carillon. At the time of its construction it was also one of only seven Presbyterian Churches in the world to have a peal of bells. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The place is also an intact example of a substantial inter-war brick church in Gothic architectural style. Designed by the prominent Brisbane architect, Lange L Powell, it incorporates many Gothic design features including asymmetrical massing and a tower without a spire. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The church is aesthetically significant, both externally and internally. The overall design is imposing yet beautiful, with stained glass windows, specifically designed furnishings, and the sound of the bells all contributing. The design and orientation also consciously utilized and complimented the proximity of Buss Park and the Anglican Church. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Church is also significant because of its strong associations with the Presbyterian/Uniting community and Bundaberg more generally. A landmark in Bundaberg, St Andrews has been a focal point of the Presbyterian/Uniting communities' social and spiritual events. The bells have specifically become a local feature.

Plot  Nasykh Nasratullovich Nafikov, also known as Kika, the protagonist, is a son of a well-known oil baron. (In the Russian language, his first, patronymic, and last name are the derivatives from invectives), Kika was born in Russia, but grew up and got his education in Europe. After his dad's passing away, Kika, received inheritance, becomes a wealthy man. The result of Kika's mostly philosophic education was obtaining a hatefully-coloured obsession with French philosophy. Kika, considering himself a great thinker, starts publishing pseudophilosophical works, primarily opposing the great French philosophers: \\"Where did Baudrillard screw up\\", \\"Derrida from a pond\\" et cetera. His works receive controversial reviews. The most famous Kika's work is called Macedonian Criticism of French Thought, where he expounds his idee fixe, developed by that time. The gist of this belief is as follows: after a man's death, a form, called 'humanoil', remains, in which man's will and suffering, put in his lifetime labour, keep on existing. Humanoil objectifies itself in a circulating commodity-money form. After Soviet Union's demise, communistic humanoil began to flow to the West, which keeps on until now. Drawing parallels between different oil grades, suitable or not suitable for a technological process, Kika comes to the conclusion that the West receives inadequate sort of humanoil; according to him — 'a poisonous purulence'. So, Kika sees his mission in putting an obstacle to the Russian humanoil flow, and also in drawing off a part of humanoil back to Russia. In order to get that done, Kika rents a factory near Paris, where people are physically abused while reading passages from Michel Foucault's book Discipline and Punish. This became known to Interpol, but Kika manages to escape retribution. His further fate is unknown; what is clear is that he is alive, making statements in the press about the crushing defeat of the French philosophical thought.  Opinions and reviews  Dmitry Bykov: * I do not really like the French philosophers of the second half of the XX century (and indeed the XX century as a whole, I would venture to say) - for reasons that are so comprehensively outlined in Pelevin's \\"Macedonian criticism of French thought.\\" Of all these people, perhaps, I'd select only Foucault (and that's just partially), and Baudrillard and Derrida all arouse nothing but dull irritation. * Pelevin is a consummate researcher of emptiness. It would be a gross mistake to say that he sees it everywhere. But wherever it is, he exposes it instantly. Whatever a clay machine-gun from Chapaev and Void is headed upon - after a brief flash before us an absolute nothingness emerges, and Pelevin masterfully made this operation with all the post-Soviet ideologemes sewn on a live thread. The idea of career and personal prosperity has been metaphorically exposed in his Prince of the State Planning Commission, the philosophy of the post-industrial society - in Generation P and Macedonian criticism of French thought ...  Facts  * In an interview, answering to the question, \\"Why was it so interesting for you to write, for example, about Baudrillard and Derrida?\\" Pelevin said: \\"I was wondering if I could put these intellectuals in an emphatically anti-intellectual surrounding. It's just like making Schwarzenegger a governor, but the opposite. \\"Виктор Пелевин (интервью) // из сборника ОДИННАДЦАТЬ БЕСЕД О СОВРЕМЕННОЙ РУССКОЙ ПРОЗЕ - ru_pelevin: сообщество читателей * In 2007, the publishing house of \\"Eksmo\\" released a self-titled book, which includes, in addition to the story itself, 12 other works by the author.

The UK- based company operates in around 80 countries with an annual turnover of £48m and 650 employees. It was founded in 1978, originally for use by business class passengers of Virgin Atlantic. Tristar operates a fleet of 415 Volvo and Mercedes-Benz cars. In 2008, Dean De Beer led a management buyout, which left him as the owner of the company. In 2012, Tristar acquired M7 Worldwide Transportation, a US company operating in the same premium market. This significantly expanded their presence in the US.  Fleet of vehicles  , Tristar had a fleet of 415 vehicles. In 2013, they acquired their first hybrid cars: three Volvo V60 Plug-in Hybrid diesels for an eight-month trial to assess whether they would reduce fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, maintenance costs and company car tax. Until 2014, they divided their purchases between Mercedes-Benz and Volvo. In 2015 the company changed its purchasing policy, commencing the transition to a fleet of 450 Mercedes-Benz cars exclusively. These will include Mercedes-Benz V-Class extra long vehicles which provide seating for up to eight passengers.  Safety initiatives  Tristar has piloted a number of safety improvements for their fleet. In 2005, they were the first fleet operator in England to trial \\"DriveCam\\" devices which would automatically capture 20 seconds of video before and after an accident. In late 2013, the introduction of forward-facing continuously recording video cameras, combined with GPS data to record the vehicles' speed, reduced accidents and also saved money on insurance premiums and disputed claims. In 2014, their close association with Volvo gave them early access to Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) technology for a six-month trial, which was reported to reduce rear impact collisions by 28 per cent. In 2015, in conjunction with the change to Mercedes-Benz exclusively, they adopted \\"Collision Prevention Assistance Plus\\", which warns the driver if they start to drift out of their lane or approach too close to the vehicle ahead, and can brake automatically if the driver fails to respond.  Awards  The company was awarded the United Kingdom’s Queen’s Award for Enterprise in International Trade for 2012. In 2013, it received two awards from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA): a Gold Award for Management of Occupational Road Risk (MORR) and a Silver Award for Occupational Health and Safety. In 2014, it won the RoSPA's MORR Technology Trophy for “the best use of technology in managing work-related road risk across all industries\\", and the \\"Eco Fleet\\" award at the 2014 Brake Fleet Safety Awards, as well as being highly commended for the \\"Company Driver Safety\\" and \\"Road Risk Manager of the Year\\" awards.

He graduated from Cal State Northridge in 1999 and played 13 years as a professional in Europe, South America, Iran, Australia and New Zealand. College career Crowe attended Inglewood High School in Inglewood, California before playing his first season of college basketball at Los Angeles Trade–Technical College in 1995–96. He transferred to American University in April 1996, signing with the Eagles men's basketball program for the 1996–97 season. As a sophomore in 1996–97, Crowe averaged 4.0 points, 2.3 rebounds and 1.1 assists in 21 games. In 1997, Crowe transferred again, this time to Cal State Northridge. He subsequently sat out the 1997–98 season due to NCAA transfer regulations, joining the Matadors squad for the 1998–99 season as a redshirted junior. Crowe was expected to make the Matadors a potent offensive threat, but despite flashes of brilliance, the transition was not as smooth as coach Bobby Braswell would have liked. While he often dished out great assists, he also had a high turnover count, which frustrated Braswell. Crowe finished the 1998–99 season with averages of 4.8 points, 2.8 assists, 3.6 assists and 1.6 steals in 29 games. He did not return to Cal State Northridge for the 1999–2000 season after graduating from the school. Professional career=Early years Crowe's first professional gig came with the La Crosse Bobcats of the Continental Basketball Association, a stint that ended on November 12, 1999 when he was released by the club. Crowe's next stint came two years later when he played for the Gear Hog All-Stars and the EA Sports West All-Stars, two touring exhibition teams competing against college teams. In early 2002, Crowe moved to the Ukraine and signed with BC Kyiv where he spent the rest of the 2001–02 season. In 10 games for Kyiv, he averaged 13.4 points, 4.7 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 3.0 steals per game. Later that year, in October, Crowe joined the Los Angeles Clippers for their training camp. Unfortunately, he did not make the team's final roster and in January 2003, he re-joined BC Kyiv. He had another stint with the Clippers in October 2003, but again did not get past training camp. In February 2004, he joined the Long Beach Jam of the American Basketball Association. Crowe moved to Hungary for the 2004–05 season, originally signing with Klima-Vill Kaposvar SE, but was released by the club prior to the start of the regular season. He later joined Szolnoki Olaj in February 2005 and appeared in five games for the club, averaging 9.4 points, 2.6 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 3.8 steals per game. Crowe moved to Iran for the 2005–06 season, signing with Petrochimi Bandar Imam on a $30,000 a month contract. He later cited that his stint in Iran was his worst experience, stating \\"There's absolutely no social life [in Iran]. None. I was over there just trying to get through and make it home.\\" His wife, Irene, spent the season with him in Iran, but due to the Islamic-ruling government which requires strict clothing cover for women in public, she often did not leave the house for three to four weeks at a time. In 36 games for Petrochimi, he averaged 22.3 points per game. New Zealand and Australia Crowe's next stint brought him back to Europe, trialling with Polish club Anwil Włocławek in November 2006. He ended up signing with SKS Starogard Gdański and played 11 games for the club before departing in February 2007. In those 11 games, he averaged 9.5 points, 5.0 rebounds, 2.9 assists and 1.9 steals per game. He subsequently moved to New Zealand in May where he joined the Waikato Pistons for the 2007 New Zealand NBL season. In eight regular season games for the Pistons, Crowe averaged 20.3 points, 4.5 rebounds, 5.3 assists and a league-leading 3.8 steals per game. He also recorded 28 points, eight rebounds and seven steals in the Pistons' semi-final loss to the Nelson Giants. Due to his impressive play in the New Zealand NBL, Crowe was nabbed by the Gold Coast Blaze of the Australian NBL for the 2007–08 season. He appeared in all 31 games for the Blaze in 2007–08, averaging 16.5 points, 6.3 rebounds and 5.4 assists per game. He returned to the Pistons for the 2008 New Zealand NBL season and had a career-best stint. His season began with a Waikato club record 16 assists in a win over the Nelson Giants, just hours after arriving from Los Angeles. He followed that up with three triple-doubles throughout the year, recording his first with 25 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists against Taranaki in round three, his second with 30 points, 12 rebounds and 10 points against Wellington in round 10, and third against the Canterbury in round 12 with 44 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists. He earned numerous awards for his efforts, garnering Most Outstanding Guard, Assist Champion, All-Star Five honors, was named Player of the Week five times, and ended the regular season atop the Player Power Rankings by a healthy margin. To cap off the season, he was named the league's Most Valuable Player and led the Pistons to the championship, winning the best-of-three Finals series 2–0 over the Wellington Saints. In 18 regular season games, he averaged 21.7 points, 7.2 rebounds, a league-leading 8.3 assists and 3.1 steals per game. Latin America and Bulgaria In January 2009, Crowe signed with Pioneros de Quintana Roo of the Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional. The following month, he moved to Venezuela and joined Cocodrilos de Caracas, which again was a one-month stint. Later that year, he signed with Ukrainian team BC Dnipro for the 2009–10 season. In 30 games for Dnipro in 2009–10, he averaged 16.7 points, 5.7 rebounds, 7.7 assists and 2.2 steals per game. In September 2010, Crowe signed with Levski Sofia of Bulgaria for the 2010–11 season. In 24 league games for Levski in 2010–11, he averaged 11.3 points, 4.7 rebounds, 5.6 assists and 2.4 steals per game. Return to New Zealand In May 2011, Crowe re-joined the Waikato Pistons for the rest of the 2011 New Zealand NBL season. In 12 regular season games, he averaged 13.2 points, 5.1 rebounds, a league-leading 7.2 assists and a league-leading 3.3 steals per game. The Pistons came into the semi-finals on an 11-game winning streak, but were defeated 95–86 in an upset win by the Hawke's Bay Hawks. Crowe scored 10 points in the loss. He earned All-Star Five honors for a second time, and was named Assist Champion for a second time also. Final season On September 29, 2011, Crowe signed with Phoenix Hagen of Germany for the 2011–12 season. However, he was released by the club in December 2011 after appearing in just nine games. In those nine games, he averaged career lows with 7.7 points, 3.9 rebounds, 2.9 assists and 1.4 steals per game. In February 2012, Crowe signed with the Wellington Saints for the 2012 New Zealand NBL season. In 18 games for the Saints (16 regular season, 2 playoff), he averaged 17.3 points, 6.4 rebounds, 8.7 assists and 2.8 steals per game.

It was designed by Karl Langer and built in 1960 by J Hutchinson and Sons . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 December 2012.  History  St John's Lutheran Church, Bundaberg, built in 1960, was designed by architect Dr Karl Langer as the primary Lutheran church for the Bundaberg community. It is used regularly by the congregation and the adjacent Lutheran school. The settlement of Bundaberg began on the northern banks of the Burnett River in 1867 but an official survey was undertaken in 1869 and the town was re-sited onto the higher, southern banks. The first land sale held in Bundaberg occurred on 22 August 1872, although two previous sales of Bundaberg land had taken place in Maryborough. The area developed as an agricultural and port town. Initially a number of the early settlers exploited the timber on their selections but as a result of the incentives of the Sugar and Coffee Regulations 1864, sugar became a major component in Bundaberg's development from the 1870s. German farmers settled in Woongarra Scrub, south-east of Bundaberg in 1871, bringing Lutheranism to the area. Lutheranism is a major branch of Christianity and places a strong emphasis on the Bible. To Lutherans, the Bible is the only source of divine knowledge and the basis for their faith. In 1838 the first Lutherans arrived in Australia from Prussia and established communities in South Australia and Moreton Bay. That year a group of German Lutheran and Presbyterian missionaries established Zion Hill (at present day Nundah), a mission for Christianising aborigines, on the outskirts of Moreton Bay Penal Colony. It was not considered successful and was abandoned in 1848. In 1857 Lutheran Pastor Carl Franz Alexander Schirmeister came to Moreton Bay and established congregations at North Brisbane, South Brisbane, Ipswich and Toowoomba. He obtained government grants of land for church use and the first church was built in North Brisbane in 1861, followed quickly by churches at the other locations. Over the following decades Lutheranism was spread across Queensland. Around 1859 the newly formed colony of Queensland launched a vigorous immigration policy that continued for over 40 years. It attracted many Germans who formed distinct communities amidst the essentially-British nation. Although only a minority of these Germans were Lutheran, across the state Lutheran congregations grew. Lutheranism in Bundaberg was established in 1873. Lutheran Pastor Carl Hellmuth of Maryborough visited Bundaberg to preach, administer Holy Communion, and baptise - the first formal Lutheran services in Bundaberg. In 1877 monthly services commenced in a shop in Bundaberg and in 1882 Bundaberg's first Lutheran church was built in Tanitha Street. This was the first St John's church and was a simple timber building. It was inundated by flood waters several times so higher land was purchased in 1890 at the corner of George and Boundary Streets and the second timber St John's church was built here in 1892. The second St John's Church, built 1892 Bundaberg overtook Maryborough as the regional centre of the Wide Bay-Burnett during the interwar period and growth continued post-World War II (WWII) with the city council promoting major revitalisation of the city. Many large building programs were completed including new hospitals, schools, court house, customs house, civic centre, and port, transforming Bundaberg. The population of the town rose from 18,000 in 1952 to 27,000 in 1967. The 1950s and 1960s was an era of religious vitality in Australia. During this period the nation was in a sustained economic boom, was led by conservative governments, and was experiencing high population growth. The congregations of major religions expanded and church attendance and religious society membership rose with accompanying financial improvement. Suburban churches regularly reported record congregation attendances on major holy days. Membership of the Lutheran church increased after WWII with the major influx of European migrants. In the early to mid-1960s a number of Christian religions made alterations to the way they ministered to their congregation in order to re-establish themselves within the modern world. With increased incomes, increased congregations, and an increasingly modern approach, considerable building programs were undertaken. Spacious brick churches were built in a modern style, often replacing smaller timber churches. In June 1940 the serving minister of St John's Lutheran Church, Pastor M Reuther, received an anonymous letter from \\"a Progressive Lutheran\\" (who was later revealed to be his wife) which included a donation of £1 toward a new and larger brick church. In 1947 Emilie Lovgren bequeathed £6,000 for the constructing a tower or steeple of a new church. In the following nine years pledges from church members brought the total available for construction to £32,000. In 1955 Brisbane-based architect and town planner Karl Langer was engaged as architect for the new church. Langer (1903–1969) was born on 28 July 1903 in Vienna, Austria. He studied at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts under the directorship of German Modernist designer Peter Behrens and in 1928, the year of his graduation, Langer was employed by Behrens to run his office in Vienna. In 1933 Langer was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy for his thesis entitled \\"Origins and Development of Concrete Construction\\". Langer immigrated to Australia with his wife, Dr Gertrude Langer, in 1939 bringing direct experience of the European Modern Movement to Queensland. He gained temporary employment with architects Cook and Kerrison in Brisbane and from 1940 lectured part-time in architecture and architectural design at the University of Queensland, publishing Sub-Tropical Housing in 1944. This booklet explored issues related to house design and town planning in a sub- tropical climate and influenced many architects working in the post-WWII era. In 1944 Langer was employed as an assistant town planner in the Brisbane City Council. From 1945, he was commissioned to work on a range of town planning projects for Darwin, Ingham, Toowoomba, Yeppoon, Kingaroy, Mount Isa, Mackay and for the National Capital Development Commission in Canberra. Concurrently, he completed numerous architectural projects of a wide variety including small, economical domestic work and large commercial and institutional work. As an architect and town planner, Langer had a pronounced impact upon the built environment of Australia, especially in Queensland, from the 1940s until his death in 1969. Along with numerous cultural pursuits, Langer was active in the Royal Australian Institute of Architects; first president (1952) of the Queensland division of the Royal Australian Planning Institute; a founder and chairman (1966–68) of the Queensland Association of Landscape Architects; and a member (1963–69) of the National Trust of Queensland. Important examples of his architectural work include the Langer residence at St Lucia (1950); Mackay Sugar Research Station (1953); Kingaroy Town Hall and Civic Square (1963); Assembly Hall at Ipswich Girls' Grammar School (1964); Main Roads Building, Spring Hill (1966); Lennon's Hotel, Broadbeach (1957) (demolished); and Lennon's Hotel, Toowoomba. His body of work is a clearly distinguishable exploration of a sub-tropical Modernism culminating in the Chapel of St Peter's Lutheran College, Indooroopilly, his last built work. Modernism developed in pre-World War I (WWI) Europe and gained popularity in Australia post-WWII. It was more than a design style and is notable for a rationalising of planning emphasising clarity and simplicity of form and detailing. American and Scandinavian influences were strong in Australia. During the 1950s and 1960s a similar rationalisation occurred within Christian religions in an effort to modernise approaches to religious practice. Churches became brighter and simpler in form and decorative treatments. They used new materials and forms while incorporating many traditional elements and symbols. Design responses included variations on the medieval church with simple massing, a rectangular nave stripped of apses, aisles and chapels, a dramatically lit sanctuary rear wall and simple belltower. Influenced by the architecture of Ancient Greece and the Modernist ideas of contemporary European architecture, Langer developed a sophisticated hybrid of ancient and modern principles of design bridging modern and traditional architecture. Typically, Langer explored the idea of the conjunction of landscape and landmark and his designs often involve a designed landscape incorporating the building. At St John's, Langer proposed a building with a simplified traditional form consisting of a box-like church with a very tall spire set back from the street by a plaza with reflecting pool, palms and colonnade. The plaza elements were not constructed. Langer designed the front of the church to appear as an open bible with bible passages in large letters, legible from a distance. This represented the authority of scripture within the faith. Further, side walls of the tower featured large Christian motifs in raised brickwork. Langer's exploration of Modernism was heavily influenced by context. He studied the local fauna and flora in Queensland and the climate. His work interprets this information in a Modernist manner. He typically exploited passive lighting and ventilation in uncomplicated ways; at St John's his design includes simple methods of passive ventilation and a naturally lit interior. Langer had developed a connection with the Lutheran community of Queensland by 1960 and went on to strengthen the connection through his repeated work for the church. This work includes St John's Lutheran Church, Ipswich (1961) and at St Peter's College, Indooroopilly a chaplain's residence (1954), dormitory block (1954–55), dining hall block (1966), concrete footbridge (1966-67), science block (1967–68), entrance fence and gates (1968), and chapel (1968). Tenders for the construction of the new St John's Lutheran Church, Bundaberg were called in 1957 and a tender of £35,140 from Brisbane-based J Hutchinson and Sons was accepted. A ground-breaking ceremony took place 19 January 1958. A large portion of the work was carried out by volunteer church members including digging the foundations by hand, carting bricks, tiles, sand, and gravel, mixing and pouring concrete, and donating and milling timber. Construction was completed in 1960 with the total cost at £61,000 including the organ, pews, and all furnishings. A dedication service, led by the Queensland District President FH Schmidt, was witnessed by 1400 worshippers on 3 April 1960. A timber crucifix was commissioned for the wall above the altar. Made in Queensland of Queensland silky oak, the cross holds a figure of Christ carved from Tasmanian King William pine, the work of Alfred Schubert, a Czech- born woodcarver from Melbourne who had trained in Bavaria. A number of items and fixtures were kept from the earlier church and installed in the new church including: panels of stained and painted glass inset into the new windows; the baptismal font donated to the church in 1883; the pipe organ originally installed in 1899 and largely rebuilt in 1938 incorporating the old pipes and bellows; the church bell cast in Maryborough in 1892; a leather-bound German bible with silver clasps presented by the Empress Augusta Victoria of Germany to St John's Lutheran Church Bundaberg in 1911; and various other religious paraphernalia. The old timber church was moved prior to 1960 to join the old Sunday School hall behind the new church. Both were extensively remodelled to become a kitchen and supper room and a hall. The understorey was enclosed to form ten classrooms by 31 January 1960. As a centenary project in 1977 it was decided to establish a Christian Day School on the site and the hall was extended to accommodate two more classrooms. Eventually, the school, now St John's Lutheran Primary School, grew to cover almost the entire block adjacent to the church and to occupy many buildings. Little alteration to the church has occurred over time. Around 2009, the sanctuary plinth was extended into the nave to form a larger sanctuary area. Externally, the projecting bricks on all elevations were sheared flat from ground level up to the level of the lintel of ground floor windows and these areas were rendered and painted. The pulpit had its original timber canopy removed and stored in the choir loft. The site of St John's Lutheran Church has been the focus for worship within the Lutheran community of Bundaberg since the construction of the first St John's Lutheran Church in 1892. The adjacent St John's Lutheran Primary School has grown into a large school from its establishment in the church hall in 1977 and the school uses the church regularly. The church is prominent within the low-scale surrounding development and remains a landmark within the area. It has featured in Bundaberg City Council promotional material, praising its architectural and artistic merits. The church has been in continuous use since construction and has seen baptisms, marriages, funeral services and regular worship services for generations of Lutherans.  Description  St John's Lutheran Church, Bundaberg, stands prominently on a corner site in a quiet, residential area of Bundaberg. The church stands at the centre of the site bounded by George Street to the north, Boundary Street to the west, Bell Street to the south and St John's Lutheran Primary School to the east. The church is rectangular in plan, long and wide, with the entrance front facing north. It is set back from George Street fronted a small, grassed forecourt with palms and shrubs. The building has a box-like body sheltered by a large, gable tiled roof. A tall, slender, square-based spire sheeted with copper rises to almost above the ground. The copper cross atop extends a further and is lit by fluorescent tubes. The northern and southern sides of the spire have fixed copper louvres at the level of the hanging bell. The external walls are orange face brick laid in English bond with projecting headers creating a repetitive pattern and texture-the lower part of the walls are without projecting bricks and are painted. Projecting bricks form large Christograms on the side walls of the tower - \\"ihs\\" on the east and \\"xp\\" on the west. The east and west walls of the body of the church are divided into six bays by full height recesses containing copper rainwater downpipes with detailed copper heads and straps. The bays each have a fixed, steel framed glazing to full height above a double-leaf, glazed, timber framed door. An architrave of projecting headers defines the openings. Beyond the southernmost bay the chancel is lit by fixed, steel framed glazing with deep reveals. The vestries project beneath these windows. The rear wall is windowless and has a field of projecting headers with a large central cross formed by projecting bricks. The vestry walls do not have projecting bricks and are rendered and painted. Open bible above the portico, 2010 The church entrance is a simple, open, painted concrete portico. Above the portico the north elevation of the tower is treated to suggest an open bible with raised, white cement rendered letters two feet high on dark grey textured concrete pages reading: > GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD, THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON, THAT WHOSOEVER > BELIEVETH IN HIM SHOULD NOT PERISH, BUT HAVE EVERLASTING LIFE. JOHN III.16 and > BELOVED IF GOD SO LOVED US, WE OUGHT ALSO TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER, IF WE LOVE > ONE ANOTHER. GOD DWELLETH IN US AND HIS LOVE IS PERFECTED IN US. 1. JOHN > IV,11-12 The portico floor is unpainted concrete and on the painted and rendered portico walls are two circular panels of mosaics approximately in diameter. One depicts St John's eagle and the other Luther's Seal. Two sandstone plaques are fixed to the wall, which read: > IN MEMORY OF EMILIE LOVGREEN WHOSE GENEROUS GIFT MADE THIS TOWER POSSIBLE. > \\"THANKS BE TO GOD.\\" and > THIS STONE WAS LAID ON 24TH MAY 1958 BY PASTOR F.H. SCHMIDT, PRESIDENT, > U.E.L.C.A. QLD. DIST. \\"UNTO GOD BE GLORY IN THE CHURCH BY CHRIST JESUS > THROUGHOUT ALL AGES, WORLD WITHOUT END. AMEN\\" EPH. 3, 21. The portico opens into an entry vestibule through large, bi-folding, steel gates embellished with the notation \\"1960\\". The vestibule has a low ceiling of stained and varnished timber battens and a floor of grey vinyl tiles with contrasting white tiles in a cross shape in two places. Within the vestibule are three steps up onto the level of the nave. From the vestibule there is an office to the left and a rest room area to the right. The rest room area accommodates a toilet, cleaner's room, and a crying room (a room to retreat to with children during the service) which has double-glazed fixed window into the nave and acoustic sheeting to one wall. The office and the rest room contain built-in benches, cupboards, tables, chairs and fittings such as wall- hung speakers which are original elements. Church interior, 2010 The vestibule opens to the nave through large, timber-framed glass sliding doors. The body of the church is a large space, brightly lit and uncluttered. The walls and flat ceiling are painted white complementing the stained and varnished timber elements. The floor is plain concrete squares with a red and gold carpet running the length and width of the aisle. The pews are silky oak, carved with a version of Durer's \\"Praying Hands\\" at the aisle end; some have memorial plaques, e.g. Donated by Mr and Mrs A.T. Thompson in memory of Mr and Mrs Hermann Rehbein. The perimeter of the ceiling features a wide band of timber battens emphasising the length of the nave and drawing the eye to the sanctuary. Twelve large windows light the nave. They contain panels depicting scenes from the Gospel of St John in stained and painted glass including portions of older glass from the earlier church, some feature dedications, e.g., In Memory of Mr and Mrs H. Pressler from their children within the glass and on plaques. The nave is electrically lit by wall sconces with glass shades and by fluorescent lights recessed between the ceiling battens. A cast plaster baptismal font (from the earlier church) with painted leaves and inscription stands to the west side of the sanctuary. The sanctuary is framed by decorative timber battened screens to the height of the nave, a timber battened pulpit stands to the left and a timber battened lectern on the right. The sanctuary has a red and gold carpet and three steps lead to the altar area which has a low altar rail of timber and steel. The concrete altar cantilevers from the rear wall and is decorated by red, gold, yellow, black, and white mosaic tiles with borders, crosses and the word HALLELUJAH picked out in tiles. A plaque fixed to the altar reads, Donated by The Children of MR AND MRS. J.A. ZUNKER In Honour of their Parents. Fixed to the wall above the altar is a large, stained and varnished timber crucifix flanked by timber Greek letters alpha and omega. On the east side of the sanctuary is the main vestry and on the west is the server's vestry. The rooms also contain timber tables and chairs that appear older than 1960. The choir loft over the vestibule is supported by twin, canted, timber columns and is accessed via a small stair on the east side. The loft is open to the nave and has a tiered, timber floor. Timber battens line the rear wall which angles into the ceiling forming a shell-like space for the projection of sound into the nave. A fixed organ console stands near the front and its screened pipes are located at the rear of the loft. The loft contains timber pews and chairs. The church has a variety of movable paraphernalia including candlesticks, framed portrait photographs, timber flower stands, timber crucifixes and crosses, lecterns, tables, bookcases, carved timber panels with leadlight, a scale model of the preceding St John's church of 1892, a framed, inscribed marble plaque, a wardrobe, cabinets, fabric hangings and books. Some of these were commissioned as part of the church construction or are from earlier churches. The gardens consist of grass areas and shrubbery with some established palms. Unpainted concrete paths and stairs surround the base of the church. A large timber hall stands to the south of the church and is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance.  Heritage listing  St John's Lutheran Church, Bundaberg was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 December 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. St John's Lutheran Church, Bundaberg, constructed in 1960 on the site of a previous Lutheran church built in 1892, is important in demonstrating the pattern of settlement in Queensland, particularly, the closer, agricultural settlement in the Bundaberg area by immigrant Lutherans from the 1870s. As a highly intact Modernist church, it is important in representing Modernist ecclesiastical architecture in Queensland during a period of significant re-evaluation and modernisation of Christian religions worldwide. Designed to be a literal expression of the Word of God, it expresses the essence of the theology underpinning Lutheranism. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics and qualities of a Modernist church in Queensland. Highly intact, the building is a simple arrangement of forms and spaces using a restrained palette of fine quality materials and finishes. The church is notable for including a dominant bell tower, a large, well-lit nave focussed on an impressive sanctuary, a choir loft, a crying room, and a vestry. The place is a fine example of the work of architect, Dr Karl Langer, featuring characteristic simplified forms and spatial arrangements, incorporation of natural light and ventilation and employing a restrained use of good quality materials. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Notable for its high quality of design, materials and construction, the place is important for its aesthetic significance. Featuring a prominent spire supported by monumental representations of biblical verses and Christograms, its symbolic features and landmark qualities have a strong dramatic effect in the landscape. The sculptural qualities of the high volume, austere interior evoke feelings of awe and reverence affected through the use of white plaster finishes complementing fine timber screens and panels; long coloured glass windows flooding the nave with light; and finely crafted timber furniture, including sculptural elements like the praying hands carved to the end of each pew.

It is the largest mosque in the city and the royal mosque of the Ternate Sultanate. Location The Sultan of Ternate Mosque is located on the eastern side of the volcanic island of Ternate Island; precisely in Soa Sio Administrative Village, Ternate Utara Subdistrict of the Ternate City. Mount Gamalama provides a backdrop for the mosque. The mosque The mosque follows the typical vernacular mosque architecture of Indonesia, which is similarly influenced by the traditional mosque architecture of Java. The mosque building consists of a main prayer hall and a front hall (serambi). The serambi, a porch-like front hall, provides access to the main prayer hall area. The ablution area is placed to the north and south of the serambi. The serambi is semi-attached to the main prayer hall; structurally its double-tiered roof is not connected with the roof of the main prayer hall, a typical fashion of Javanese mosque architecture. The main prayer hall follows the language of mosque architecture in Indonesia. It features a five-tiered corrugated steel roof (originally of thatched material). This roof is supported by four main posts (saka guru) and additional twelve supporting posts. The uppermost roof- tier is much steeper than the rest of the roof tiers; four hatches provide cross ventilation. The top of the roof is decorated with a pole, symbolizing the Arabic letter alif, which symbolizes Allah. The mosque has a square layout and aligned roughly east–west. An ornate minbar is placed in the mihrab. The mosque complex is surrounded by a wall. An entrance is located at the west end of the complex, forming a gateway building. On the top of this gateway is a 3 x 4.2 meter roofed space to announce prayer (replacing the function of a minaret). This gateway is topped with an 8-meter two-tiered roof. History The mosque with its original thatched-roof in early 20th century. There are differing opinions about the founding time of the Sultan of Ternate Mosque. The current mosque building was probably built in early 17th-century, around 1606, by the ninth Sultan Hamzah. It is very likely that the current mosque building replaced an earlier mosque 16th-century mosque, since it has been known that the Sultanate of Ternate was powerful during the course of the 16th century. The mosque has been restored several times, including the replacement of the original sago thatched material of the roof with corrugated steel, as well as demolition of some of the fence and other additional buildings. Tradition and rituals The Sultan of Ternate Mosque in late 19th-century The Sultan of Ternate Mosque adopts a unique tradition. Only men are allowed to enter the mosque, women are not allowed in order to maintain the sanctity of the mosque. Another rule is the prohibition of wearing sarong inside the mosque; wearing trousers and a headscarf or cap are obligatory. There are several rituals unique to this mosque; one of the ritual is the qunut ritual on the 16th night of Ramadan, known as the Malam Qunut (\\"qunut night\\"). During the Malam Qunut, the Sultan performed a ceremony known as Kolano Uci Sabea. In this ceremony, the Sultan and his family arrived at the mosque in a palanquin, performed the tarawih prayer, helped by the Bobato Akhirat (the Sultanate council of religious matter), and then returned to his kedaton (\\"palace\\") in a palanquin. In the kedaton, the Sultan and his queen (Boki) will perform a special prayer for the ancestor inside a special room located above the shrine of the ancestor. After this prayer, the Sultan and his queen will meet the people of Ternate.

Tigerstedt became a Doctor of Philosophy in 1939, a docent (assistant professor) in 1941, and a professor in 1946 at the University of Helsinki. He was a literary critic at the newspapers Svenska Pressen ('Swedish Press,' 1938–1941) and Hufvudstadsbladet ('Journal of the Capital,' 1941–1946). In 1948, he left Finland and moved to Stockholm where he became a literary editor at the publishing houses Natur & Kultur and later Bonniers. At Natur & Kultur, he became something of a pioneer in introducing modern science fiction to Sweden, and was involved in the publication of the series 'Tomorrow's Adventure.' Later, however, when a hopeful student wanted to write his dissertation on H. G. Wells, Tigerstedt replied to his proposal with the words: \\"The candidate has misunderstood the subject.

Scholarship on Plato and Sparta Internationally, Tigerstedt is known primarily as a scholar specializing in Plato and classical studies. His The Decline and Fall of the Neoplatonic Interpretation of Plato: an outline and some observations (1974)Societas Scientariarum Fennica, 1974. made an important contribution to the history of interpretations of Plato. G. A. Press said '... Tigerstedt's historical sketch ... remains the best available history of Plato studies.'Gerald Alan Press, Plato's Dialogues: New Studies and Interpretations (New York: Rowman & Littlefield, 1993), p. 107. Brisson's 1977 review said 'This historical argument [of Tigerstedt] is truly convincing and sheds light on many points unknown or poorly known about the Platonic tradition during the Middle Ages, through the Renaissance, and to the Enlightenment and the dawn of rigorous history of philosophy. In addition, this little book fills a lacuna that E. N. Tigerstedt himself deplores: namely, the absence of a global history of the Platonic tradition.'Luc Brisson, review of 'E. N.

Method and approach to literature Tigerstedt was known among his colleagues and students for his vivid lectures, their historical outlook, and his language skills, but he was fairly dismissive of the new ideas that came to influence literary theory in the 1940s (for example, the so-called 'New Criticism' and psychoanalytic methods). He emphasized the content of each work and genre history; as a researcher and critic he assumed that literary studies should aim to reconstruct and bring to life the author consciously thinking in the context of his time, and thus to avoid considerations that were for the most part unconscious or invisible to the poet himself. For example, in his Dante: the Time, the Man, the Work (1967), Tigerstedt discussed Dante's rhetoric and worldview, his handling of the people and events of his time in the context of the genre of 'comedy,' and how Dante intended that his main characters, including \\"Dante\\" himself, should be interpreted by readers. Tigerstedt ascribed to Dante considerable cunning and an ability to manipulate the reader's emotions, but rejected any attempt to see the emotions, characters, and conflicts in Dante's poetic world as reflections of the author's private ego and his emotions. To see an author's people and language as primarily an expression of such private emotions or his \\"inner creative flow\\" would give in to unscientific subjectivity and romantic illusions. Tigerstedt pointed out several times that Dante, in his opinion, had been interpreted too romantically. Tigerstedt's book on Dante was recently discussed along with other works in the Svenska Dagbladet.Var generation måste söka Dante på nytt Svenska Dagbladet 2009-04-11  See also  *Neoplatonism *Allegorical interpretations of Plato External sources * There is a biography in Finnish online at Biografiskt Lexicon för Finland References 1907 births 1979 deaths Finnish historians Swedish historians 20th-century historians Swedish- speaking Finns Literary historians Finnish expatriates in Sweden ","title":"E.

It was built from 1888 to . It is also known as Gin Gin Railway Station, Goods Shed & Refreshment Rooms. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 July 2000.  History  The township of Gin Gin was gazetted in 1877, consisting of an area of some three thousand acres on the Gin Gin run. Gin Gin was an original station of the first section of the Mount Perry railway line which opened from North Bundaberg to Moolboolaman on 19 July 1881. The exploitation of the mineral resources of Queensland was recognised by political interests in Queensland as being closely linked with the development of a railway system from the period of the late 1860s and early 1870s. This connection between political decisions and economic development was further linked and with the decision taken in 1877 to construct mineral railways running from Townsville to Charters Towers, Bundaberg to Mount Perry and Maryborough to Gympie. As well extension of the Southern railway line from Warwick to Stanthorpe was approved along with extensions to Roma and Emerald on the same day in Queensland Parliament, 30 August 1877. The decision to construct separate railway systems with no connection to other parts of the Queensland Railway system was to result in a proliferation of separate railways throughout Queensland, (up to eleven by 1891). The system would not be unified until 1924 with the opening of the North Coast railway line between Brisbane and Cairns. The Mount Perry railway (originally known as the Bundaberg Railway) was built by the Queensland Government. The line was built to service the Mount Perry copper mines. Copper was discovered in the Mount Perry area in the second half of the nineteenth century. Mining activities led to agitation for a link between the mines of the Mount Perry region and a port. In 1872 proposals of a private railway line were considered, and both Maryborough and Bundaberg vied to secure the line. These plans were never executed however. Rather, it was decided a state-owned line would be constructed. Thornloe Smith, engineer in charge of Railway Surveys, conducted a survey from North Bundaberg to Mount Perry in 1875. Thornloe's survey noted the country was rugged, and eventual surveying plans called for a tunnel to pierce part of the Boolboonda Range. The first section, North Bundaberg to Moolboolaman, was constructed by Overend and Co. and opened on 19 July 1881, although timber specials had run for some months previously. The second section, including the Boolboonda tunnel works, was approved in November 1880. By the end of 1880 more than 350 men were employed on the construction of the railway line. Railway station at Gin Gin, circa 1905 Tenders had been called for the construction of a goods shed in 1880. A loading bank was provided in 1882, and in 1883 timber loading facilities were constructed indicating the importance of timber and sawmilling operations for the railway line. A new goods shed, and combined shelter shed and station office were built in 1888/89. A refreshment room was provided from the period of 1891 until 1960. The shed was destroyed by fire on 7 November 1917. In 1928 the complex consisted of a station building, lamp room, trucking (cattle handling) yards, goods shed with crane, trike sheds and the station master's residence. Gin Gin was to become the major regional transport centre within the central part of the Burnett area, and a major transport centre within the region. Given that Gin Gin was also situated on the main highway link between Brisbane and Cairns (the Bruce Highway), the growth of road competition was to contribute to the eventual dwindling of revenue freight carried on the line. At the completion of the line to Mount Perry in 1884, the copper mines which had led to the construction of the railway line had closed due to the financial failure of the mines. The copper mines reopened around the turn of the nineteenth-twentieth centuries and with the construction of a smelter, operated until the period of the First World War. For the next 50 years the main traffic generated on the Mount Perry line was mainly from dairying, livestock and timber traffic, with sugar traffic from Gin Gin east to the Gibson and Howes mill. From 1 November 1960 the Mount Perry railway was closed beyond Tirroan, due to declining revenue. The railway beyond Tirroan was dismantled in 1961. After the transfer of sugar cane traffic from the Watawa plantation area in 1964, to the Gin Gin Central Sugar Mill at Wallaville there was little traffic beyond Gin Gin other than stock specials to the cattle loading railhead at Tirroan. The section of line from Tirroan to Mount Perry was closed in 1960 and removed in 1961, due to declining traffic revenues. The Gin Gin to Tirroan section was closed in 1989. The final section of the Bundaberg Railway, beyond the Versatile Toft siding (North Bundaberg to Gin Gin), closed officially to traffic on 25 January 1993, although services had been suspended in 1991. The line was sold for removal, with rail being sold off to local sugar mills for use on their tram networks. Part of the former right-of-way has been adapted for use by the Bingera Mill for its sugar tramway. The Gin Gin station complex was leased to the Gin Gin and District Historical Society in 1993, following closure of the railway. The complex was purchased by the Kolan Shire Council in 1995 for the use of the Historical Society. Other buildings have been transported on to the site by the Gin Gin and District Historical Society including a school house, and police residence, barn and indigenous museum (housed within the former goods shed). The additional buildings have not been relocated to the immediate vicinity of the former railway yard, and as a result do not detract from the visual appeal of the railway complex Within the former station yard the trackwork, turnouts and roads have been retained extant. Donated items from Queensland Railways including a BBV guards van, camp wagon, and a flat wagon and water gin, which have been placed on the platform road at the station building, and other roads within the complex. At the Tirroan end of the complex a former Gin Gin Central Sugar Mill tramway 0-6-0 steam locomotive has been placed on display on a dual-gauge track. Built as a low-cost development railway, the Mount Perry railway features two major surviving structures entered permanently in the Queensland Heritage Register: the Boolboonda Tunnel (now open to road traffic) and Splitters Creek Railway Bridge at Sharon.  Description  The Gin Gin complex consists of the station building which is a representative late Victorian building with curved and chamfered brackets to the shade and distinguishing porch with fretted gable. It is of comparable appearance to Esk, Bundamba and North Bundaberg railway stations. Accommodation is provided with ladies water closet, waiting room, lamp store, shelter shed and office. Booking windows face the shelter area and the platform and central shelter area post has curved decorative brackets facing three directions. Station nameboards are extant on the platform . The goods shed is a timber-framed weatherboard clad building with out shade and with windows sealed through boarding. It has one sliding door mounted on opposite sides of the shed, and the loading platform has been partly demolished. Goods crane is a one-ton whip crane bearing a manufacturing plate of Sargeant engineers, Brisbane. The former Station Masters house is a simply detailed building elevated with a corrugated iron hipped roof and verandah post brackets. The building at present is occupied by the Gin Gin and District Historical Society.  Heritage listing  Gin Gin Railway Station and Complex was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 July 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Mount Perry railway was one of several major railway lines approved by the Queensland Parliament in 1877, to access the gold and copper fields of Queensland from the ports of Maryborough, Townsville and Bundaberg. The complex, by its retention by the local Shire Council, allows for an interpretation of the construction, and development of the former North Bundaberg-Mount Perry railway line, as well as the network of branch lines centred on Bundaberg. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Gin Gin Railway Station and Complex is important as a substantially intact example of a country branchline station and its associated buildings and infrastructure. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Gin Gin Railway Station and Complex is important as a substantially intact example of a country branchline station and its associated buildings and infrastructure. Its survival as a relatively intact group of railway buildings dating from various periods allows for the interpretation of the importance of the Queensland Railway network in the economic development of rural Queensland. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Its use as a museum also is important in the interpretation of the complex and its significance to the local community.

Government reactions= European Union  European Council = French Embassy in Prague, Czech Republic, 18 November 2015 The attacks prompted European officials—particularly German officials—to re-evaluate their stance on EU policy toward migrants, especially in light of the ongoing European migrant crisis. Many German officials believed a higher level of scrutiny was needed, and criticised the position of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, while the German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel defended her stance, saying that a lot of migrants were fleeing terrorism. French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said that he would be meeting with EU ministers on 20 November in Brussels to discuss how to deal with terrorism across the European Union. Meeting reports indicated that Schengen area border controls have been tightened for EU citizens entering or leaving, with passport checks and systematic screening against biometric databases. This is based on a temporary measure; changing the rules on a long term basis could take months. Poland's European affairs minister designate Konrad Szymański declared that, in the wake of the attacks, he saw no possibility of enacting the recent EU refugee relocation scheme. The new Prime Minister of Poland, Beata Szydlo, while acknowledging that Poland is bound by international treaties, said she would ask the EU to change its decision on refugee quotas. Szydlo later stated that Poland would honour the commitment made by the previous government to accommodate 9,000 refugees. Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orbán, rejected the concept of mandatory resettlement quotas. Andrej Babiš, Czech deputy prime minister, proposed closing the Schengen border. Czech Prime Minister, Bohuslav Sobotka, said the attacks were a wake- up call for Europe. Sobotka also criticized president Miloš Zeman for supporting anti-Islamic groups and spreading hatred, according to Reuters, whose report adds that the Sobotka government has been deporting migrants. Slovakia's prime minister, Robert Fico, said he was proven right about the links between Middle East migrants and security. = European Commission and Parliament = The attack interrupted final negotiations over the Budget of the European Union, with participants taking breaks to watch TV news of the events. Commission Vice-President Kristalina Georgieva said that the events encouraged shocked negotiators to end the talks quickly, with a final agreement five days before the 18 November deadline. Commission Vice-President Federica Mogherini and EU defence ministers backed France's request for help in military missions after they invoked Article 42.7 of the Treaty of the European Union for the first time since its creation. As a result, the United Kingdom has already stated its intention to help France directly in operations in Syria, while some countries intend to aid France by taking over activities in Africa, namely in Mali and the Central African Republic. Germany will send up to 650 troops to Mali and 50 military trainers to Kurdish forces in Iraq. Spain, Lithuania and Slovenia announced similar actions. Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, rejected calls to rethink the European Union's policy on migration. Dismissing suggestions that open borders led to the attacks, Juncker said he believed that the attacks should be met with a stronger display of liberal values, including internal open borders. The Czech Prime Minister expressed disappointment over Juncker's response.  Canada  Canada maintained its commitment to accept 25,000 Syrian refugees, and in early November, set a challenging deadline, the end of 2015. By 24 November however, it was clear that no more than 10,000 could be accommodated by year end; the rest would arrive by March 2016. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that the accompanying security measures would protect Canadians. By 20 November, financial plans were being made for the proposed funding for six years, estimated at $1.1 billion. Discussions as to how and where refugees would be resettled were also under way. However, an expert, Gerard Van Kessel, retired director-general of the refugees branch at Citizenship and Immigration Canada, warned on 23 November 2015 that a five or six weeks is not adequate to complete security checks and resettle 25,000 people. All of the provinces had agreed to accept refugees and all but one provided specifics as to the number they would be able to support. On 22 November 2015, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported that (according to unnamed sources) Canada will limit the acceptance of Syrian refugees to only women, children and families, screening out unaccompanied men. Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale assured Canadians that a robust screening process would be used overall, but admitted that some checks would be done once the refugees were already in Canada. However, a criminologist, Barry Cartwright of Simon Fraser University is convinced that it's impossible to do thorough security checks ″in a region where there are basically no recognized police departments.″  United States  U.S. Embassy, Paris was illuminated in French flag to show solidarity after the attacks. The US House of Representatives passed the American SAFE Act of 2015, which makes it more difficult for Syrian and Iraqi refugees to enter the United States. The bill still needs to pass the Senate. At least 31 state governors said that they opposed accepting Syrian refugees into their states, although the decision to accept refugees belongs to the federal government; numerous mayors of major US cities have said they would welcome more refugees. The United Nations asked Congress and governors to continue accepting Syrian refugees who had been vetted by security measures as an example to other countries.  Other nations' responses  Many world leaders and governments expressed their condemnation of the attacks and their condolences to the victims.

This was similar to the reactions after the January 2015 Charlie Hebdo shooting with the phrase \\"Je Suis Charlie\\" and reflects the historic phrases ich bin ein Berliner in the 1961 Berlin crisis and the phrase \\"Tonight, we are all Americans\\" spoken on air by France 2 reporter Nicole Bacharan after the September 11 attacks. The French embassies and institutions used the hashtag #NousSommesUnis (French We are united). The slogan #PrayforParis has been object to critical discussion due to its religious and imperative character. The Dalai Lama said \\"Humans created this problem and humans must solve it\\". The French Artist Joann Sfar suggested to use the hashtag #ParisIsAboutLife instead.joannsfar: #ParisIsAboutLife, 14 November 2015 Some ISIL supporters used the hashtag #باريس_تشتعل (Paris burns, Paris is burning or Paris is on fire), the same hashtag that appeared in the January 2015 attacks on Charlie Hebdos office and a Paris grocery store. In response, social media users urged saturation with #Parisburns, re-purposing the hashtag as support for the victims and Paris. Muslims also rebuked the attacks by using the hashtag #NotInMyName and #MuslimsAreNotTerrorist, the former of which had been utilized by Muslims in the past to condemn ISIS actions. Following the attack, a Facebook campaign was created with the goal of getting Eagles of Death Metal's cover of the Duran Duran song \\"Save a Prayer\\" to number one on the UK Singles Chart. The song ultimately peaked at number 53 for the chart dated the week after the attack. Google attached a black ribbon to the bottom of their page \\"in memory of the victims of the Paris attacks\\". Skype and other websites have allowed users to make free calls to France to allow users to connect and communicate with loved ones or relatives/friends to ensure their safety. High- profile political cartoonist Hadi Heidari was arrested in Iran after he depicted the Eiffel Tower in tearful solidarity with the people of Paris – an image that had been widely shared on social media and reproduced by western news organizations.http://freebeacon.com/national-security/report-iranian- cartoonist-arrested-after-drawing-cartoon-in-support-of-france/ Other reactions NBC's Saturday Night Live opted not to open the show with a comedic cold open as it usually does; instead, cast member Cecily Strong addressed the City of Paris in English on behalf of New York City, which was followed by a French translation of her comments. After saying the show's opening line, SNL returned to its usual format. The show has only removed its usual cold open after two other occasions—the September 11 attacks in 2001 and the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012. In the days following the attacks, the French news and entertainment show Le Petit Journal sent its reporters on to the streets of Paris to document the public's reactions. Their reporter Martin Weill recorded an interview with a six-year-old boy named Brandon, who, when asked if he understood why the attackers had done what they had done, responded: \\"Yes, because they're really, really mean. Bad guys are not very nice. And we have to be really careful because we have to change houses.\\" Videos of the interview went viral in both the French- and English-speaking world. The hacktivist group Anonymous declared \\"war\\" on ISIL in its largest operation to date, and by the second day claimed to have taken down 3,824 pro- ISIL Twitter accounts and doxxed multiple recruiters. The National Football League has implemented metal detectors and increased security inside and outside its stadiums for the games that played during week 10 of the 2015 season as spectators were discouraged from bringing non-plastic clear bags into the venues. All teams that played held a moment of silence to honor the victims of the attacks.https://money.cnn.com/2015/11/14/news/nfl-public- safety-paris-attacks/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paris-attacks-nfl-to- increase-security-inside-and-outside-stadiums/ The WWE has changed its security guidelineshttps://www.wwe.com/page/security-policy and held a moment of Silence prior to the 16 November episode of Monday Night Raw displaying the French Flag and the Eiffel Tower in the form of Peace for Paris.https://www.wwe.com/amp/shows/raw/2015-11-13/wwe-honors-the-victims-of- the-paris-terrorist-attacks-photos Negative reactions At a football match against Greece, some Turkish supporters booed during a minute of silence in commemoration of the attacks, and a section reportedly shouted \\"Allahu akhbar\\", an incident echoing what had previously happened during a minute of silence for the victims of the October Ankara bombings, in which minority Alevis and Kurds made up the majority of the Ankara bombing victims. During a moment of silence in a match between Moldova and Azerbaijan, Azerbaijani soccer fans booed. During a Euro 2016 qualifier match between Ireland and Bosnia and Herzegovina in Dublin, a minutes silence was held prior to kick off. Bosnian fans were reported to be chanting loudly during that period. Responses from Muslim groups Various Muslim religious leaders and organisations from around the world condemned the attacks. Some took to social media to say that the attacks went against the teachings of Islam. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, Qatar and Egypt have been among the Arab states leading condemnations of the simultaneous attacks in Paris, in addition to Morocco, Bahrain, Iraq, Turkey, and Iran. Al-Azhar university in Cairo, the Muslim world's top theological institution of learning and oldest university, strongly condemned the attack, saying, \\"The time has come for the world to unite to confront this monster... Such acts are contrary to all religious, humanitarian and civilized principles.\\" Mirza Masroor Ahmad, the head of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, issued a press release from London condemning the attack by expressing his heartfelt sympathies and condolences to the French nation, and said that these attacks are against the teachings of the Quran. Les Fédérations Musulmanes, a French Muslim federation, strongly condemned the attacks in Paris denouncing it as \\"abject barbarism.\\" The Luxembourg Shoura, a federation of Muslim leaders in Luxembourg condemned the attacks in a statement released on the Tuesday following the attacks saying \\"We are outraged and express loud and clear our deep disgust and our unequivocal condemnation of these criminal acts committed against civilians done at random.\\" The Muslim Council of Britain described the attacks as \\"horrific and abhorrent\\" and participated in one of the Trafalgar Square vigils. The Council added that \\"There is nothing Islamic about such people and their actions are evil, and outside the boundaries set by our faith ...there is no justification for such carnage whatsoever.\\" The Association of British Muslims said that \\"The Muslim faith condemns such acts of violence\\" and \\"The attacks in Paris were not aimed just at France or Paris, they are attacks against the values and freedoms we cherish and live by in Europe, they were aimed at all of us.\\" The Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda, al-Nusra Front, praised the attacks, saying that even though they view ISIL as \\"dogs of hellfire\\", they applaud when \\"infidels\\" get attacked by ISIL. In a press release by the Australian National Imams Council, the Grand Mufti of Australia Ibrahim Abu Mohamed made some controversial remarks that: \\"These recent incidents highlight the fact that current strategies to deal with the threat of terrorism are not working. It is therefore imperative that all causative factors such as racism, Islamophobia, curtailing freedoms through securitisation, duplicitous foreign policies and military intervention must be comprehensively addressed\\". He received criticism from politicians and the press for not directly condemning the Paris attacks. Which led to a further statement: \\"We wish to emphasise it is incorrect to imply that the reference to causative factors provides justification for these acts of terrorism.\\" and \\"Dr. Ibrahim Abu Mohamed have consistently and unequivocally condemned all forms of terrorist violence.\\"  Political reactions  The attacks called attention to existing controversy over mass surveillance and calls for prohibition of strong encryption or otherwise hard-to-monitor communications. Shortly after the reports it was reported that a PlayStation 4 unit had been found in the home of one of the suspects, which correlated with Belgian home affairs minister Jan Jambon's statement three days before the attack that \\"The most difficult communication between these terrorists is via PlayStation 4\\". Though not encrypted, PlayStation chats allow millions of customers to speak with people they would not otherwise know, complicating the traffic analysis that can expose patterns even in encrypted communications when the participants in a conversation are identified. Comments after the attack by American CIA Director John Brennan blamed disclosures by Edward Snowden and availability of encryption for aiding terrorist networks, though this idea was opposed in a New York Times editorial as \\"a new and disgraceful low\\". At the second political debate for Democratic candidates for the U.S. presidency, when Bernie Sanders was asked whether after the attacks he still believed that the greatest threat to national security was climate change, he explained that climate change was related to rising terrorism, because it caused competition over resources.

He has published more than 45 books in English and Japanese, from novels to essays, plays, poetry and translations. He has written prolifically for the stage and has seen his plays produced at major theatres in Japan, Australia and in the U.S. Pulvers has also directed widely in Australia and Japan, both in English and Japanese. He has written original scripts for radio documentaries and dramas that have been produced by ABC (Australia), as well as television scripts for NHK (Japan) and screenplays for feature films. Early years Pulvers was born into a Jewish-American family in Brooklyn, New York on 4 May 1944. Soon after birth, his family moved to Los Angeles, where he grew up, attending Burnside Ave. Elementary School, Louis Pasteur Junior High School (now LACES and Alexander Hamilton High School (1961), at which he was Student Body President. Pulvers took part in the Democratic National Convention, held in Los Angeles in 1960, where John F. Kennedy was nominated for the presidency. His position was Head of Youth for Stuart Symington, senator from Missouri and also a candidate for the nomination. Early exposure to show business came from annual trips in the 1950s to Las Vegas, where Pulvers saw dinner shows of The Ritz Brothers, Sammy Davis Jr. and other entertainers. Also, his father, Louis (1903–1993), had worked as a lighting technician at Warner Bros. during and after the war, bringing home piles of glossy enlargements of actors on set. His mother, Miriam (1912–2006), had been secretary to William S. Klein, lawyer for the Shubert brothers, owners of New York theatres. In her later years she became private secretary to Bette Davis. Education Pulvers was an undergraduate at UCLA, completing the four-year course in three years with a major in Political Science, summa cum laude. After graduation in June 1964, he went to Bloomington, Indiana to attend a Russian-language intensive course, going from there to Finland, the Soviet Union and Italy. In the Soviet Union he travelled extensively, visiting Moscow, Kiev, Kharkov, Yalta, Riga, Leningrad and Novgorod. In September 1964 he entered the Russian Area Studies Program at Harvard University Graduate School, living on campus at Perkins Hall. He completed the two-year Master's Course in one year, receiving his MA with a thesis on \\"The Planning of Soviet Science.” Pulvers spent the summer of 1965 in the Soviet Union, Finland, Denmark and Switzerland, returning to UCLA to further his studies of Eastern Europe and to study Polish. In September 1966, he went to Poland to do post-graduate work at Warsaw University on a scholarship from the National Students' Association (NSA) of the United States. While there, his interests turned away from political science to film and theatre, thanks to almost daily visits to the theatres and cinemas of that city. In January 1967 he moved to Krakow but was soon to leave Poland due to a scandal involving the NSA and the CIA. Though he was entirely innocent of any connection with the latter organization, he felt that he would never be able to return to Poland or the Soviet Union. He spent three months in Paris attending classes at the Sorbonne until his return to Los Angeles in May 1967. In September of that year he left the United States for Japan. Career In the late autumn of 1967, after spending four weeks in Korea to change his visa, Pulvers took up a lectureship in Russian and Polish at Kyoto Sangyo University. He spent five years in Kyoto teaching at that university and at Doshisha University, where he conducted a course in American poetry. In 1969 he published his first book, a collection of short stories under the title \\"On the Edge of Kyoto.\\" This was followed in August 1970 by the publication of a short play in Japanese translation, \\"The Perfect Crime of Mrs. Garigari\\", in the leading drama magazine, \\"Shingeki.\\" In 1972 he was one of the winners of an essay contest sponsored by the Mainichi Shimbun. This led to the publication of the essay, \\"Kenji Isn't Here Now.\\" This was Pulvers' first published work about Japanese author and poet Miyazawa Kenji; and it prompted a long association with the Mainichi Daily News. In August 1972 Pulvers travelled to Australia for the first time to take up a lectureship in Japanese at the Australian National University in Canberra. It was not long before he was writing articles and stories for The Canberra Times, The Australian, The National Times, Newsweek and other publications, as well as doing regular radio broadcasts for a programs on the ABC. He also produced and directed plays in Canberra. His own plays were produced in Melbourne, Adelaide, Newcastle and Canberra. On 6 July 1976 he became an Australian citizen. During the 1970s, Pulvers frequently went back to Japan to continue his involvement in Japanese arts and to be with his many friends who were their practitioners. He became particularly intimate with novelist/playwright Inoue Hisashi, at whose home he stayed. Pulvers also travelled to Europe, especially to Poland, where he was greeted in 1970 by film director Andrzej Wajda. His close friendship with Wajda has continued over the years. In January 1980 Pulvers left the ANU to become Writer-in-Residence at the Playbox Theatre in Melbourne. It was at the Playbox that he directed his own work and that of other playwrights. In the summer of 1982, Pulvers went to Rarotonga in the Cook Islands to be assistant to director Oshima Nagisa on the film \\"Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence.\\" After that he returned to Japan to take up the position of literary editor at the Mainichi Daily News in Tokyo. Since the 1980s, Pulvers has published hundreds of articles in the Japanese and world press (the Far Eastern Economic Review, The New Scientist, etc.), as well as books of fiction, non-fiction and translations from Japanese. He has appeared frequently on Japanese television and radio, and acted in the NHK Taiga Drama, \\"Sanga Moyu.” Since the early 1990s, Pulvers has divided his time primarily between Tokyo and Sydney, with frequent trips to Europe, particularly Poland, Ireland and the U.K. From 1996–1999 he was a professor at Kyoto Zokei Geijutsu University; and from 1999, professor at Tokyo Institute of Technology, where he was Head of the Centre for World Civilizations. He retired in 2013 to devote himself entirely to his writing. In Tokyo he continued to write articles, including his weekly column, Counterpoint, in The Japan Times, to publish books of fiction and non-fiction, to direct in the theatre, to write screenplays and to act in film. In Australia he most recently directed at the Roxy Theatre in Leeton his translation/adaptation of Nikolai Gogol's \\"The Government Inspector.” He wrote the script and directed the feature film of \\"STAR SAND” on location in Okinawa in 2016. The film is released in Japan in the summer of 2017. Awards Awards and honors include the Crystal Simorgh Prize for Best Script at the 27th Fajr International Film Festival in Tehran for \\"Best Wishes for Tomorrow ( Ashita e no Yuigon)\\" the Miyazawa Kenji Prize in 2008, the Noma Award for the Translation of Japanese Literature in 2013 and the Inoue Yasushi Prize in 2015. Pulvers was also an official member of Prime Minister Jun'ichiro Koizumi's Task Force on Public Diplomacy and in 2009 received the Award of Commendation from the Cultural Affairs Agency (Bunkacho) for contributing to the propagation of Japanese culture overseas. In 2018 he was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon for his contribution to foreign language education in Japan and to promoting students’ understanding of science and technology. Also in 2019 he was awarded The Order of Australia for his significant service to Japanese literature and culture as a writer, translator and educator.

He was an associate of the Biggar family and was killed with Piet Retief and approximately 100 other men on KwaMatiwane, hill of execution, within sight of Dingane's stronghold, Umgungundglovu, between Melmoth and Vryheid. Halstead was a descendant of the British Settlers. He appears as a character in the H. Rider Haggard novel Marie. Halstead’s fate Credo Mutwa puts all the blame for the murder of Retief and his men on the shoulders of the youthful Thomas Halstead, who accompanied the Voortrekkers as interpreter. According to Mutwa, Halstead was known by the Zulu as the “Curious Peeper”. On the evening before the murder Halstead is said to have peered over the fence of the royal harem. One of Dingane’s wives, who was pregnant, saw him and was so frightened that she suffered a miscarriage. According to Zulu law it was a crime punishable by death for any man to approach the vicinity of the royal harem. Mutwa writes that Dingane was beginning to harbour thoughts that his white visitors had vile intentions, as one could expect from wizards, and were targeting his wives. That was why he had them murdered and why he shouted \\"“Kill the wizards\\". According to Wood, Halstead was sitting among the Voortrekkers when the dancing Zulu attacked. He called out: \\"We are done for!\\" He added in the Zulu language: \\"Let me talk to the King!\\" Dingane heard this but rejected his request with a wave of his hand. Halstead thereupon pulled out his knife, cut open one assailant and slit another’s throat before he was overpowered. Mutwa's allegation regarding Halstead is probably untrue. The messenger that Dingane sent to Owen to inform him that he was going to kill Retief and his men specifically added that the interpreter of the Voortrekkers, an English- speaking man from Port Natal [Thomas Halstead], would not be killed. Three days after the massacre Owen wrote in his diary that Dingane himself had told Hulley that Halstead, who was sitting with the Voortrekkers, was killed against the wishes of the Zulu king; that he was accidentally killed in the confusion. According to a remark that Owen made in his diary one day after the massacre, Dingane informed the missionary Venable that he gave orders that Halstead should not be murdered, but that his warriors did not recognise Halstead in the midst of the Voortrekkers. Owen also added that it was Dingane’s custom to blame his subjects when he did something of which he felt ashamed. Hulley also referred to the fate of Halstead in his report. He recorded that he asked Dingane a few days after the massacre about why Halstead had been killed. According to him the Zulu king replied: \\"He is dead. In the mayhem of the massacre he was killed with the others. I am sorry about it. I did not mean to take his life.\\" References *Suid-Afrikaanse Biografiese Woordeboek III.

She later transported the leaders of the Mau movement for independence to exile in Jaluit, and returned to her home port in China in May 1909. In December 1910, Jaguar supported British forces against an uprising in Wuhan, remaining stationed in Wuhan to February 1911. With the start of the Xinhai Revolution, Jaguar was sent to protect the German consulate at Fuzhou, which also had a large foreign missionary population. In February 1914, she ran hard aground in the Yangtze River, and was repaired locally. Although World War I had started in Europe, she was repaired at a British-owned dock in July 1914, and sailed at night for Tsingtao to avoid British warships. When Jaguar arrived at Tsingtao of 4 August 1914 she was the only operational German warship, as her sister ships had been stripped of their guns to equip the auxiliary cruiser SS Prinz Eitel Friedrich which sailed on the following day to join Admiral Graf von Spee and the German Far East squadron at Pagan in the Caroline Islands. Jaguar participated in combat operations against the Imperial Japanese Navy at the Siege of Tsingtao, together with the Austro-Hungarian Navy cruiser . She was received a direct hit to her bow on 4 October. Jaguar was scuttled on 7 November 1914 at the German colony in the Kiautschou Bay concession, on the final day of the Siege of Tsingtao.

The reports were largely focused on the needs of the reconstruction of a country steeped from wartime destruction, in addition to the prospect of redemption and progress.

Works of Van Gheluwe are part of collections such as those of the Flemish Community, the National Bank of Belgium, Mu.ZEE Ostend and the city of Aalst, along with private collections in Belgium and abroad. He was married twice and has three sons. He currently lives and works in Scheldewindeke.  Early life and education  Peter Van Gheluwe was born in Ghent and was raised as the youngest of nine children and developed an observing eye for his surroundings early on. Around the age of twelve he began capturing the world in his drawings, and he started painting around his 14th birthday. He started an education in drawing and graphics at the Higher Institute of Fine Arts Saint-Lucas. Inspired by a study trip through Europe during the first year of his studies, where he visited many major cities and museums, he continues painting in his studio at home.  Beginning artist  After his studies, Van Gheluwe combines the first years of work as an advertisement painter with his artistic work. In 1982 he is asked to teach at his alma mater, the Higher Institute of Fine Arts Saint-Lucas. He participates in a series of competitions. In 1978 his first solo exhibition takes place in Galerie Siegfried De Buck and he wins the \\"Price for Painting\\" in Poperinge and the \\"Price for Painting\\" of the Lions Club Ghent. He also wins the \\"Price for Graphic Art Ebes\\" in 1980.  Career  In 1983, Van Gheluwe receives a distinction in the \\"Jeune Peinture Belge\\", followed by an exhibition in the Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels. He receives a bronze medal in the Europaprize for painting (Ostend) in 1984. Two years later, he is honored with another distinction in the \\"Jeune Peinture Belge\\", again followed by an exhibition in the Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels, together with Wim Delvoye, Dirk Braeckman and others. Many other individual and group exhibitions take place afterwards, in Ghent, Middelburg, Palma de Mallorca, the Sharjah Art Museum in the United Arab Emirates and others. From the start of his artistic career, Van Gheluwe focusses on the workings of light. That can be seen in the series \\"Ardens ritme\\" (1978) and \\"Staken in landschap\\" (1979–1983). This is followed up with a more expressive period with monumental blocks presented as still lifes. This leads to primitive boat- and houseshapes, which he begins to craft in 3D iron wire structures. The boat shape takes an increasingly prominent role in his imagery due to the Amoco Cadiz oil spill and the Herald of Free Enterprise disaster. A monumental example of this is shown in the exhibition \\"Anti-chambre\\" in Gent, during the Chambres d'amies in 1986, together with Thierry De Cordier. Jan Hoet names both as exceptional submissions in newspaper articles about the exhibition. He also starts using the same shapes to develop a personal drawing language using iron wire, culminating in an exhibition in Brussels (Ouvrons les ateliers) where a 10 by 4-meter boat made out of hundreds of smaller iron wire boat shapes is displayed. On the occasion of his laureateship of the Ebes prize for graphical arts, Van Gheluwe is invited to work at the Frans Masereel Centre in Kasterlee. The results are shown multiple times in exhibitions at home and abroad, for example in De Brakke Grond, Amsterdam and in Palma de Mallorca. From 1992 onwards, Van Gheluwe's work become more contemplative. Large color planes with his typical earth tones, appear on his canvasses, painted in many layers. The images still express strong impressions of light. In 1996 he begins using sheets of lead in three dimensional work. This series of work is shown in the Claeys-Bouüart Castle in Mariakerke, along with the installation \\"Geworpen\\", a 4 x 4-meter salt field with iron boats below an iron raster structure. In 2006, Van Gheluwe creates a self-designed orangery-shaped installation in the Eeklo Academy. Inside the orangery are unused canvasses behind windows that the spectator can open and close. This way, he wanted to raise questions about place, time and perception. Peter Van Gheluwe, A dialogue, 2001. Mixed media/paper19 x 12.5 cm Starting in 2003, Peter Van Gheluwe begins digging into his own history. He studied the life of his father, who died when Van Gheluwe was 20 years old and spent years in a labor camp in Germany during World War II. Some drawings about this theme were shown in the exhibition \\"Zie tekening\\" in Lier. He continues researching the horror and dehumanization and undertakes a few study trips to concentration camps in Germany and Poland, leading to many drawings, sketches, photographs and film clips. This search leads to the art book \\"Hidden View\\" in 2008, with introductory texts by Volkmar Mühleis and Luc Martens and an exhibition in Galerie Negenpuntnegen in Roeselare. Light continues to have a prominent role in these representations of horror. Van Gheluwe joins the group \\"Lumen\\" in 2006, with exhibitions in De Markten, Brussels and De Halle, Geel. He also participates in the art book \\"Katernen\\" with an original drawing. This book is exhibited in the Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven. In between these series he also focuses on how light interacts with water and human tracks on the road. After 2008, Van Gheluwe turned his focus to the workings of light and its relationship with time and place. Some works from this period were displayed in the exhibition \\"Stil-Licht\\", while others were bundled in the book \\"Gnomon\\" with a text by Chris Fite-Wassilac and will be exhibited in Roberto Polo Gallery  Awards  * 1978 – \\"Hoppeland\\" prize for painting – Poperinge * 1979 – Prize for painting – Kuurne * 1979 – Prize for painting – Lions Club Ghent (honorable mention) * 1980 – Provincial prize for Graphics – East Flanders (distinction) * 1982 – Prize for Graphical Arts – Ebes Ghent * 1983 – Jeune Peinture Belge – Brussels (distinction) * 1983 – Prize for Painting – Leuven (special mention) * 1983 – Provincial prize for Painting – East Flanders (distinction) * 1984 – Europaprize – Ostend (bronze medal) * 1986 – Jeune Peinture Belge – Brussels (distinction) References   NotesExternal links * Official website 1957 births Belgian contemporary artists 20th-century artists 21st-century artists Living people People from Ghent ","title":"Peter Van Gheluwe"},{"id":"48549996","text":"\\"Closure\\" is the ninth episode of the third season of the American television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., based on the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division), revolving around the character of Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they face a vengeful former agent and Hydra. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. The episode was written by Brent Fletcher, and directed by Kate Woods. Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by series regulars Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge, Nick Blood, Adrianne Palicki, Henry Simmons, and Luke Mitchell. \\"Closure\\" originally aired on ABC on December 1, 2015, and according to Nielsen Media Research, was watched by 3.84 million viewers.  Plot  While Coulson and Price are having dinner at her apartment, Ward fatally shoots Price through the window with a long-distance sniper rifle, and then calls Coulson to claim responsibility, revealing that Hydra is planning to reopen the portal to the barren planet, Maveth. Evading Hydra agents, Coulson returns to the Playground and interrogates May, Daisy, Fitz and Simmons about their time working with Ward on the Bus, hoping to find his weaknesses and exact his revenge. Devising a plan to draw Ward out, Coulson enlists Hunter and Morse to help him, and orders Mack to become acting director while he is carrying out his plan. They track down and kidnap Thomas, Ward's younger brother, from the jewelry store he works at. He cooperates fully once he understands the situation. Fitz, Simmons, and an ATCU team led by Banks investigate the abandoned Project Distant Star facility, but they are attacked by Giyera, who kills Banks and his agents and abducts Fitz and Simmons, bringing them to the Gloucestershire castle, where Hydra is repairing the portal manipulator. Giyera tortures Simmons to get her to reveal how she escaped from Maveth, while Ward makes Fitz listen for the same purpose. Coulson calls Ward to inform him of his brother's abduction, and Thomas keeps him on the phone long enough for Morse to track his location, taking the opportunity to deride him as even worse than their parents and Christian while commenting that their father was using a walker when the night he killed Christian and their parents. After the call, Coulson has Thomas dropped off in another location. Furious, Ward takes over Simmons' torture until Fitz finally gives in, agreeing to accompany the Hydra team through the portal and help them bring back the ancient Inhuman (though he hopes to leave the creature and the Hydra agents there, and instead rescue Will). Malick convinces Ward to lead the mission to Maveth, declaring him the finest Hydra soldier in history and the only man worthy of this task. While Mack marshals a taskforce (including Lincoln and Joey) to launch an assault on the castle, Coulson, Hunter, and Morse get there first in their quinjet, just as Malick opens the portal using the Monolith pieces. After Ward and his team go through with Fitz, Coulson dives from the Quinjet into the portal, and is knocked unconscious upon landing on Maveth.  Production = Development  In November 2015, Marvel announced that the ninth episode of the season would be titled \\"Closure\\", to be written by Brent Fletcher, with Kate Woods directing.

Plot Following the events of \\"Closure\\", Ward's team find an ancient statue in the shape of the Hydra symbol on Maveth, the deserted planet opened through the Monolith. They also find Will Daniels, and Fitz convinces Ward to let Will guide them through the wasteland to the point where the portal will reopen. Coulson regains consciousness and pursues the team, and after Will leads the Hydra agents into a storm so he and Fitz can escape, Coulson kills the soldiers and wounds Ward, forcing him to help find Fitz and Will. Back on Earth, Mack leads two team into the castle to secure the portal and rescue Coulson, Fitz and Simmons, as well as Hydra's captive Inhumans, who have been brought in by Malick. Mack goes with Hunter and Morse, while Daisy goes with May, Lincoln and Joey. Lincoln causes a power failure, during which Simmons escapes and finds the captive Inhumans, including Andrew. She reluctantly releases him to fight the Hydra agents trying to recapture her, but he also murders the other Inhumans. While Mack, Hunter and Morse seize the portal chamber, May finds Simmons and learns of Andrew's escape, and Joey saves Daisy from Giyera by melting 3 bullets, who is incapacitated by Lincoln. Mack orders the other agents to leave and to destroy the castle so that Hive cannot escape, but Daisy refuses to leave him behind. Fitz and Will come across the ruins of an ancient civilisation, and Will explains that the inhabitants of Maveth 'feared change' and warred among themselves, until they destroyed each other. When Will trips, Fitz stops to help the wound on his leg, only to find its bone exposed. His first-hand knowledge leads Fitz to realize that he is in fact Hive, inhabiting the reanimated body of Will, who died saving Simmons from it. Hive attacks Fitz as Coulson finds them, but when he shoots Hive several times to save Fitz, Ward attacks him. The castle machinery automatically reopens the portal, and Fitz prevents Hive from escaping through it by destroying Will's body with a flare gun. Coulson overpowers Ward and crushes his chest with his prosthetic hand, killing him. Returning to Earth through the portal, Coulson and Fitz escape with Mack and Daisy, as May destroys the castle with the Zephyr's missiles. The team return to air base where Simmons hugs Fitz with the loss of Will, and Lincoln kisses Daisy. Coulson shares a look with Fitz, referencing to the death of Ward on Maveth. However Hive takes over Ward's body and reaches Earth before the portal closes, and is encountered by a fleeing Malick.

Biography  Gegham Grigorian was born in Yerevan and graduated from Yerevan Komitas State Conservatory, the class of People's Artist of Armenia professor Sergei Danielyan. Grigorian made his first appearance on the big stage in 1971 at age 20, in 1972 he went to West Berlin to appear with solo concerts. In 1975 he made his debut at the National Theater of Opera and Ballet of Armenia in the role of Edgardo (opera \\"Lucia di Lammermoor\\" by Donizetti). This is followed by Saro (opera \\"Anush\\" by Tigranian), Tirith (\\"Arshak II\\" by Chukhajyan), Sayat Nova (\\"Sayat-Nova\\" by Arutiunian), Count Almaviva (\\"Il Barbiere di Siviglia\\" by Rossini), and Faust (\\"Faust\\" by Gounod).  Travel restrictions  In the 1970s he was already a famous singer in the former Soviet Union. In 1978 he took part in the competition of the School of Art in Milan at the theater La Scala and was one of the four lucky winners who were invited to qualify for this school. During his traineeship in Italy, he participated in several concerts. In \\"La Scala\\" Gegham Grigorian made his debut in the role of Pinkerton (Madama Butterfly by Puccini). After that performance, he signed a contract with the theater \\"La Scala\\" on the leading roles of the operas \\"Boris Godunov\\" and Tosca. The performances were conducted by Claudio Abbado, then he was principal conductor of La Scala. \\"But politics interfered. The Mussorgsky opera was being staged by Yuri Lyubimov, the famous Moscow director-dissident already in conflict with the government (he was later stripped of his citizenship, in 1984). The production was in rehearsals when the Soviet Union Ministry of Culture asked Grigorian to cancel his participation. As the singer described it at the time - just after the first dress rehearsal - he initially refused. But when the authorities threatened him and his family he acquiesced and departed for Russia. Subsequently he was put on the so-called restricted artists list and not allowed to leave the Soviet Union for eight years\\" (March 25, 2016 by Maya Pritsker, Musicalamerica.com) As written by The Telegraph on 30 March 2016: \\"In November that year (1979), however, he turned up in Trieste, some 250 miles east of Milan, seeking political asylum. He was living in a refugee centre while his case was being considered, but within days had vanished, failing to turn up in Milan for his appearance in Mussorgsky’s Boris Godunov on December 7.\\" In 1980, Virgilijus Noreika, artistic director of Lithuanian National Opera and Ballet Theatre invites Grigorian to work In Vilnius. There Grigorian worked with the famous conductor Jonas Alex. He sang in the operas \\"Eugene Onegin\\", \\"Don Carlos\\", \\"Boris Godunov,\\" \\"La Traviata,\\" \\"Madama Butterfly,\\" \\"Rigoletto\\" and many others. Since 1989, at the invitation of Valery Gergiev he joined the Kirov Opera (soon to be the Mariinsky Theater) as the lead singer. Here Grigorian was a great success. In those years, the Mariinsky Theater just gained fame. Gegham Grigorian made a great contribution in the formation and establishment of company of soloists, that always marks with a sense of gratitude the chief conductor and artistic director Valery Gergiev. Until now, in St.Petersburg and throughout Russia, opera fans remember the beautiful and dramatic voice and a magnificent performance of Gegham Grigorian. Since 1990 the Soviet Union was on the verge of collapse, and Grigorian had the opportunity to travel to foreign countries.  Career abroad  \\"When he did eventually appear regularly in the West – under the patronage of the conductor Valery Gergiev – he thrilled audiences at Covent Garden, where his portrayal of Lensky in Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin was hailed as musical gold by critics, and at the Metropolitan Opera, New York, where he gave a moving account of Herman in The Queen of Spades. The critic Rodney Milnes declared him to be \\"one of today's great tenors\\", adding that in \\"Grigorian's Lensky you hear a century of Russian tenor tradition, inimitably plangent, firm and expressive\\". After a concert performance of The Queen of Spades with the BBC Philharmonic in Manchester in 2004, The Daily Telegraph noted how Grigorian \\"invested every fibre of his being in the obsessed Hermann\\", while earlier The New York Times had declared that in the same role at the Met his \\"characteristic concentration produced frequent haunting moments\\". (The Telegraph, 30 MARCH 2016) The Soviet Union had started to disintegrate and Grigorian was now free to travel again. This stage of career of Grigorian began with debut at the Royal Concertgebouw in Amsterdam in 1990, he sang leading roles in Donizetti’s Lucrezia Borgia, La Boheme and Lecouvreur operas and three years later made his Royal Opera House (London) debut in Eugene Onegin as Lensky. In 1995 he was a last-minute substitute for Luciano Pavarotti in Verdi’s Un Ballo in Maschera at Covent Garden, the same year in which he appeared in New York. He returned to the Metropolitan Opera in 2002 as Count Bezukhov in Prokofiev’s War and Peace with Dmitri Hvorostovsky and Anna Netrebko, again under Gergiev. Almost 20 years after disappearing from La Scala, Grigorian returned to the Italian opera house in 1998, singing in Mussorgsky’s Khovanshchina alongside Burchuladze under Gergiev, returning there in Verdi’s La Forza del Destino under Riccardo Muti in 1999. In 2000 he returned to Armenia as artistic director of the Yerevan Opera Theatre, a post he held for seven years. Grigoryan sang at all famous and big Opera Houses and concert halls.

Grigoryan sang in New York, Washington, Tokyo, Paris, Vienna, Munich, Berlin, Amsterdam, Monte Carlo, Geneva, Florence, Japan, etc. Since 1990, Grigorian was a regular guest at various festivals: Chorégies d'Orange (Orange, France), at the Summer Opera Season in the Baths of Caracalla (Teatro dell'Opera di Roma, Rome,Italy), Ravenna Festival (Ravenna, Italy), Savonlinna Opera Festival (Savonlinna, Finlyadniya), Maggio Musicale Fiorentino (Florence, Italy), Festival Puccini (Torre del Lago, Italy), Salzburg Festival (Austria), and many others. In the years 1989-96 he was a member of the Committee of the artistic leadership at the Semaines Musicales de Tours Festival (France). He fulfilled all of the most difficult parts for tenors (\\"Rigoletto\\" 208 performances, \\"Aida\\" 70 productions). He has worked with all the great singers of the classic genre, who created the history of classical performance of 20th and 21st centuries: Nicolai Ghiaurov, Mirella Freni, Leontyne Price, Grace Bumbry, Gena Dimitrova,Maria Dragoni Luciano Pavarotti, Plácido Domingo, Leo Nucci and Gergiev, Zubin Mehta, James Levine, Bruno Bartoletti, Yevgenny Svetlanov, Richter. Opera directors: Graham Vick, Konchalovsky, Zeffirelli, Del Monaco, etc. After ten years of abroad career Gegham Grigorian has been called one of the best tenors of the 20th century, the list of which is headed by the legendary Enrico Caruso, Beniamino Gigli, Franco Corelli.  As artistic director  In 2000 the President of Republic of Armenia Robert Kocharyan invited him to be the artistic director of the Yerevan Opera Theater. He directed the theater in that position until 2007. In those years, the Theater staged the following operas directed by Grigorian: Verdi \\"La Traviata\\", Tigranyan \\"Anush\\", \\"David Beck\\" Chukhajyan \\"Arshak II\\". During the years of leadership of Grigorian, the Theater staged such operas of directors invited by Grigorian as \\"Carmen\\", \\"Norma\\", \\"Aleko”, “ Don Juan.” The concert version included the following operas: Tchaikovsky \\"Iolanta\\", Mozart \\"The Magic Flute\\", Vivaldi \\"Tigran the Great\\".

The ASC provides sustainable and responsible aquaculture producers with a stringent certification and labelling scheme guaranteeing to consumers that the seafood they are purchasing is sustainable for the environment, and socially responsible. The Aquaculture Stewardship Council was founded in 2010 by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the Dutch Sustainable Trade Initiative (IDH).About the Aquaculture Stewardship Council, www.asc-aqua.org (page visited on 14 November 2015). According to their website, the ASC's Vision is \\"[a] world where aquaculture plays a major role in supplying food and social benefits for mankind whilst minimizing negative impacts on the environment\\". Their mission is \\"[to] transform aquaculture towards environmental sustainability and social responsibility using efficient market mechanisms that create value across the chain.\\". The ASC is an example of multistakeholder governance, and a full member of the ISEAL Alliance, a sustainability standards setting membership. Personnel The current ASC CEO is Chris Ninnes. In February 2016, Aldin Hilbrands, Meghan Jeans, Scott Nichols, and Ling Cao joined the ASC Supervisory Board. Accreditation Process The standards of the ASC have resulted from the WWF-initiated Aquaculture Dialogues, a multi-stakeholder series of dialogues held over the course of a decade and which involved around 2,000 scientists, NGOs, industry participants and other interested parties (farmers, processors, retailers and government agencies). In order for an aquatic farm to be certified by the ASC, a comprehensive series of criteria must be fulfilled; including pre-assessment, on-site farm audit and an audit report. All the audit reports for all the ASC-certified farms are transparently made available to the public via the ASC's website. The ASC has standards for the 12 following species: abalone, bivalves (clams, mussels, oysters and scallops), freshwater trout, pangasius, salmon, seriola and cobia, shrimp, and tilapia.https://www.asc-aqua.org/what-we-do/our-standards/farm- standards/ A Feed Standard is currently being elaborated; whilst standards for several other species are under consideration (notably sea bass and sea bream). New standards must follow a transparent setting procedures, involving several rounds of public consultation; with all feedback made public. An Indonesian tilapia farm was the first to have reached ASC-certification in 2012. Several pre-competitive organizations are now using the rigorous ASC standards as a means to progress their industry towards more environmental sustainability and social responsibility: such as the Global Salmon Initiative (GSI, established in 2013); and the Sustainable Shrimp Partnership (SSP, launched in March 2018) which operates in Ecuador. The GSI member companies (representing over 50% of the world's global farmed salmon production) have pledge to have all their salmon farms ASC-certified by 2020.  Certification  The ASC covers certifies different species groups which includes Tilapia, Salmon, Pangasius, Bivalves, Cobia and Shrimp. In November 2017, a Seaweed Standard was also launched by the ASC together with the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC). Certified ASC products are now available around the world in Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Hungary, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.https://mailchi.mp/asc- aqua/xr162vrjvq-2118633?e=9ebd51a70d In May 2018, the ASC-certified volume had reached 1.4 million tonnes (including close to 750,000t of salmon, 202,000t of pangasius, 156,000t of tilapia, 141,000t of bivalves, 113,000t of shrimp). There are over 100 bivalve farms ASC-certified, 250 salmon farms... 621 farms in total as of May 2018 (209 in Europe, 170 in Asia, 147 in South America, 71 in North America, 21 in Oceania, and 3 in Africa), with over 200 currently in assessment...

The project has been opposed by environmentalists since it seeks to pull down 1200 acres of old sal forests for a coal mine. At least 500,000 prime sal trees would be chopped, and 54 villages with a considerable tribal population would be displaced. However, a group of villagers have also been supporting the mine since it would boost the local economy. Business Mahan Coal Ltd is a Rs 5,000-crore joint venture between Essar Energy and the Aditya Birla Group (Hindalco). Part of the controversy is based on claims by Greenpeace India that the sanction for the coal mine was given based on a Gram Sabha (village board) resolution that had been forged. Quote: Greenpeace alleged that signatures of most of the villagers had been forged and that the resolution also included signatures of at least six villagers who were not alive. The land was allocated to the company based on this document. However, in 2014, the coal block land was deallocated by the Supreme Court resulting in sharp drops in the company's stocks. Its original allocation in 2006 is part of the Indian coal allocation scam. During investigations, the Ministry of Power stated that it had opposed a role for Hindalco in the mine, quote: Ministry of Power [told the CBI] that it did not recommend the 2006 allocation of Mahan coal block to Hindalco. Instead, it claimed to have asked the Ministry of Coal to allocate Mahan to Essar Power. but the coal ministry under Manmohan Singh allocated the mine to the joint company. Opposition by Greenpeace India Since the BJP government came to power, the project has seen considerable support, and has been linked in the media for the Government actions against Greenpeace India. In January 2015, Priya Pillai, a Greenpeace campaigner very active in Mahan, was offloaded from a flight while she was to meet some British MPs inquiring into the matter. The issue is relevant to Britain since Essar Power is listed in the London Stock Exchange. This incident was seen In March 2015, the Ministry of Environment did not give a clearance for the project, and subsequently Ministry of Coal announced that the Mahan coal block would not be auctioned for mining, which was viewed as a victory by the tribespeople living in the villages.

Established between 1570 and 1596 it is one of the oldest mosques in Indonesia. The mosque is located in close proximity to the ruins of Old Banten, and functioned as a 16th-century center of Islamic learning in Banten. The mosque received a heritage status during the Dutch colonial period in 1932. Its status today is unknown. History Kasunyatan Mosque is one of several mosques located around Old Banten; the other mosques are the Great Mosque of Banten and Masjid Kanari. There are other remnants of mosques in the Old Banten, such as the tower of the ruined Masjid Pecinan Tinggi, the already demolished mosque of the Kraton Kaibon, and ruins of Koja Mosque. It is located outside the walled city of Surosowan Kraton, Old Banten. Kasunyatan Mosque was founded by Kyai Dukuh, the leader of the Islamic school of thought in Banten and the teacher of the Sultan Maulana Muhammad. Kyai Dukuh, who received the title Pangeran Kasunyatan, gave his name to the village and to the mosque. Kasunyatan Mosque was built as a prayer facility for the community of Islamic scholars in the Kasunyatan Village. There are differing opinions about the foundation date, but the mosque was established during the reign of Maulana Yusuf, somewhere between 1570 to 1596. The mosque complex The mosque is located in the village of Kasunyatan, 500 meter south of Kraton Kaibon in the Old Banten. The mosque complex is surrounded by walls with three main gates on the west, south, and east. The western gate is the main entrance for the tombs on the north of the mosque complex. The western gate also acts as a boundary between the northern tomb area and the eastern tomb area. The southern gate provide entrance to the eastern tomb area. Both the western and the southern gate features a simple curving form with ornaments. The eastern gate is the main entrance to the mosque complex. It is 7.10 meter in length and 3.10 in height. It features the Semar Tinandhu decoration, showing Hindu-Javanese influence. At the center of the mosque complex is the main mosque. The main mosque consists of a main prayer hall, surrounded by three \\"porch\\" (serambi) to the north, east, and south. The layout of the main prayer hall is square-shaped, roughly 11.30 x 11.50 meter. The roof is built in a typical Javanese mosque architecture with three-tiers, supported by four main posts (saka guru) and topped with a terracota mustaka (roof top decoration). The main prayer hall's interior is constructed of white-washed brick. Two doors provide entrance to the north and south of the hall. The mihrab is located to the west of the main prayer hall and contains motifs of false columns and plant-like arabesque on top, reminiscent of the kala makara motif of classical candi architecture. The serambi of Kasunyatan Mosque is enclosed with wall, which is unusual for Javanese mosque architecture which usually has its serambi wall-less like a porch. The northern serambi kept a bedug and an inscription which marked the year the Kasunyatan Mosque received its heritage status in 1932 by Soeria Nata Atmaja. The eastern serambi contains 18 tombs, including the tomb of Ratu Asiyah and Syekh Abdul Syukur Putra. The southern serambi contains 5 tombs. The mosque features a minaret, an unusual feature in Javanese mosque architecture. The minaret is located on the southwest corner of the mosque. It is an 11 meter tower of white-washed brick, consists of three floors and topped with a clay roof tiles topped with a terracotta mustaka. The minaret shows Portuguese influence. There is a similarity between this minaret and the minaret of the ruined Masjid Pecinan Tinggi in Old Banten. To the west of the mosque complex is a 1.7 meter deep stepwell with a pond of 3.8 meter deep used to perform ablution. Normally, a stepwell is located in the front of a mosque, however the stepwell of the Kasunyatan Mosque is located at the back (west) of the mosque, being closer to a former river (now a lake) to the west of the mosque.

He became a professor at Columbia University in the summer of 1961. Kuranishi was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1962 at Stockholm with the talk On deformations of compact complex structures and in 1970 at Nice with the talk Convexity conditions related to 1/2 estimate on elliptic complexes. He was a Guggenheim Fellow for the academic year 1975–1976.John Simon Guggenheim Foundation  Masatake Kuranishi In 2000 he received the Stefan Bergman Prize. In 2014 he received the Geometry Prize of the Mathematical Society of Japan. Research Kuranishi and Élie Cartan established the eponymous Cartan–Kuranishi Theorem on the continuation of exterior differential forms. In 1962, based upon the work of Kunihiko Kodaira and Donald Spencer, Kuranishi constructed locally complete deformations of compact complex manifolds. In 1982 he made important progress in the embedding problem for CR manifolds (Cauchy–Riemann structures). Thus, by Kuranishi's work, in real dimension 9 and higher, local embedding of abstract CR structures is true and is also true in real dimension 7 by the work of Akahori. A simplified presentation of Kuranishi's proof is due to Sidney Webster. For n = 2 (i.e., real dimension 3), Nirenberg published a counterexample. The local embedding problem remains open in real dimension 5.

It is notable for being the first World War I memorial built in Western Australia, and for (nominally) being built in a single day (12 February 1916) with donated funds, materials and labour.  Description  The cottage is a four-room, brick and tile building, designed by Alfred Levido, a Perth architect. It was designed in Federation Queen Anne style. The roof has two finialed gables.

The land was donated by a local real estate agent, James Peet. The heavily timbered block was cleared by about 30 volunteers using hand tools on 29 January 1916. The following week, on 5 February, materials were brought to the site. Seventy drays and 150 men proceeded in convoy from James Street to the Mount Hawthorn building site. The procession was led by Emily Roberts, the \\"Soldiers' Queen\\", in her motor car.\\"The People\\", display at Anzac Cottage, 2016-02-14 On arrival at the building site, Roberts ceremonially turned the first sod before the men began the foundation work, completing them the next day. Construction day, Saturday 12 February, began at 3:30am with the ringing of a bell to summon the builders. By 4am there were 50 men on site ready to begin, and by 8am over there were over 100 men working on the house. The number rose to 200 by early afternoon. Meals were provided to the workers from a temporary canteen set up for the purpose. During the afternoon a memorial plaque was affixed to one of the gateway pillars by Lady Barron, the wife of Governor Harry Barron. At 5pm Roberts raised the Australian flag, into which the letters \\"ANZAC\\" had been sewn. By the end of the day \\"the outside of the buildings was almost completed\\", the lawn turf was laid and the fence had been erected. The remainder of the construction work, including the interior, was completed over the next two weeks. The building of the cottage was a notable public event. The delivery procession was watched by thousands, and met at the building site by a crowd of hundreds. The main construction attracted a crowd of 4,000 onlookers, the local streets were decorated with flags and streamers, and the Police Band provided music. A souvenir booklet was printed to mark the occasion, with descriptions of the events and the cottage, photographs, and the names of many of those involved.  Porter family residence  On 15 April 1916 the cottage was officially opened for public inspection by Premier John Scaddan and his wife. The following day the property was handed over to Private John Porter and his wife Annie. Porter was a member of the 11th Battalion of the First Australian Imperial Force, and one of those in the landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915. He was wounded on the first day; the injury subsequently causing him to returned to Australia in July 1915 as an invalid.\\"Private Porter\\", display at Anzac Cottage, 2016-02-14 The title deed to the property was held by the Mount Hawthorn Progress Association as trustees, with the returned soldier and his family and descendants having the right to live there, but not to sell it.\\"Excerpt from the Agreement Between Mount Hawthorn Progress Association and Private Cuthbert John Porter\\", display at Anzac Cottage, 2016-02-14 Porter and his wife lived in the cottage until their deaths in the 1960s. Some of his descendants lived in the cottage until the 1970s or early 1980s.  Restoration and subsequent use  During the 1970s and 1980s ownership of the property and responsibility for its maintenance was disputed. The Porters' children had moved elsewhere and the nominal owner, the Mount Hawthorn Progress Association was no longer operating. After legal disputes as to its ownership, the cottage was eventually taken over by the state government. By this time the building was in poor condition. In the early 1990s, the cottage was given to the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia, Western Australia Branch (VVAA WA), who coordinated the restoration of the building to its original condition, with support from local community groups and funding from Lotterywest. A sleepout extension and bath, both non-original, were removed. The front verandah, extensively damaged by weather and termites, was replaced. Sections of the roof and brick work was repaired. The cottage was reopened in April 1997. In April 2002 a rededication ceremony was held, at which Lorraine Sanderson (the wife of Governor John Sanderson) laid a new memorial plaque to replace the original laid by Lady Barron. In 2006 the cottage was donated to the Town of Vincent, who leased it back to the VVAA WA for a peppercorn rent. It is now used as the VVAA WA's headquarters and a museum, and is occasionally open to the public.  Flagpole  A flagpole was erected in the front yard of the cottage before its official opening in April 1916. It was donated by Mrs Helmes, in memory of her nephew killed at Anzac. A plaque was attached to the flagpole, commemorating Private Leslie Arthur Wilkinson, who died at Anzac Cove.Facebook photo of original plaque, and comment, 2015-05-28 In 2015 the wooden flagpole was found to be irreparably damaged by termites. A new metal flagpole was installed to replace it.Facebook photo of flagpole, comments and subsequent replies, 2015-11-05Facebook post, comments and replies, 2015-11-09 The new pole has a new plaque, with the same wording as the original.New plaque on the metal flagpole, 2016-02-13  Heritage listings  Anzac Cottage is classified by the National Trust, listed by the Heritage Council of Western Australia on the State Register of Heritage Places and included on the Register of the National Estate. It is included in the City of Vincent Municipal Heritage Inventory.  Commemorative ceremonies  Anzac Cottage is host to several commemorative ceremonies, such as those on Anzac Day, Vietnam Veterans Day, and Remembrance Day. Notable amongst these are: * Every year Porter raised the flag on Anzac Day at 4:30am, the time of the first landing. * Since 1996, a \\"sunset service\\" has been held each Anzac Day at the cottage, the last such service in Australia each year.  Other similar cottages  The Mount Hawthorn cottage inspired other similar ventures, such as the Anzac Cottage in Claremont, Western Australia, built by the Ugly Men's Association in 1917. The Queensland War Council built several dozen \\"Anzac cottages\\" for widows and orphans of Queensland soldiers who died during the war.

From 1934 until 1937 it aired on CBS Radio. WGN executive Ben McCanna believed that a dramatic serial could work on radio just as it did in newspapers. When he approached Gosden and Correll to adapt The Gumps to radio, they declined and instead devised their own characters for the 1926–27 radio serial, Sam 'n' Henry. After reworking these characters for Amos 'n' Andy in 1928–29, while borrowing certain elements from The Gumps, they were on their way to becoming millionaires, and the radio serial format they created soon became the model for many other serialized radio dramas.McLeod, Elizabeth.

Integration works in three levels: inter-personal, intra-personal and spiritual . Positive influences include participation in recovery programs, such as those for drug and alcohol abuse. Factors that can make growth difficult include a long-standing pattern of criminal activity, serious adverse life events, and chronic mental health illness.  History  The term Positive criminology first was introduced by Natti Ronel and his research team at Bar-Ilan University, Israel. Accordingly, it represents a wide perspective that includes several existing models and theories. It is partially based on Peacemaking criminology and on Positive Psychology, and relates to known and accepted models such as restorative justice. Enrico Ferri, a socialist, introduced his theory of positive criminality, which was based upon the elimination of antisocial conduct according to \\"a science of society, taking on for itself the task of the eradication of crime\\", during three lectures in Naples, Italy in 1901. Rather than punishment, Ferri believed that crimes should be addressed by social sanctions, in proportion to the degree of danger of the criminal act and risk to society. He and other determinists, like Baruch Spinoza, eschewed the concept of moral guilt and responsibility. While libertarianists, like Immanuel Kant of the 18th-century, believed in the concept of morality that may be subject to change. In the 19th century, there were also social scientists that believed that effectively combating criminality included improving society's health and welfare and eliminating poverty.  Treatment and rehabilitation =Strength-based treatment programs In recent years, various programs have been developed in the field of rehabilitation of offenders, in community and prison, based on the principles of cognitive-behavioral approach, usually implemented in a group setting. These programs are considered a form of strength-based treatment, due to the emphasis on personal, interpersonal and social skills developed that enable participants to acquire pro-social lifestyle, which may also reduce their need for deviant behaviors. The assumption underlying these programs is that those who work on acquisition of new positive skills, rather than just avoidance from negative behaviors, will achieve better results and be able to maintain the positive outcomes for the long run. Recent studies indicated their effectiveness in reducing recidivism amongst released offenders. =The Good Lives Model = The Good Lives Model (GLM), first proposed by Ward and Stewart and further developed by Ward and colleagues, is a strengths-based approach to offender rehabilitation that is responsive to offenders' particular interests, abilities, and aspirations. It also directs practitioners to explicitly construct intervention plans that help offenders to acquire the capabilities to achieve the things that are personally meaningful to them. It assumes that all individuals have similar aspirations and needs and that one of the primary responsibilities of parents, teachers, and the broader community is to help each of us acquire the tools required to make our own way in the world. Criminal behavior results when individuals lack the internal and external resources necessary to satisfy their values using pro-social means, or where a single aspiration or need is valued exclusively over all other aspirations or needs. In other words, criminal behavior represents a maladaptive attempt to meet life values, or a singular focus on one specific life value. Offenders, like all humans, value certain states of mind, personal characteristics, and experiences, which are defined in the GLM as primary goods. Following an extensive review of psychological, social, biological, and anthropological research, Ward and colleagues proposed eleven classes of primary goods: (1) life (including healthy living and functioning), (2) knowledge, (3) excellence in play, (4) excellence in work (including mastery experiences), (5) excellence in agency (i.e., autonomy and self- directedness), (6) inner peace (i.e., freedom from emotional turmoil and stress), (7) friendship (including intimate, romantic, and family relationships), (8) community, (9) spirituality (in the broad sense of finding meaning and purpose in life), (10) happiness, and (11) creativity. Whilst it is assumed that all humans seek out all the primary goods to some degree, the weightings or priorities given to specific primary goods reflect an offender's values and life priorities. Moreover, the existence of a number of practical identities, based on, for example, family roles (e.g., parent), work (e.g., psychologist), and leisure (e.g., rugby player) mean that an individual might draw on different value sources in different contexts, depending on the normative values underpinning each practical identity. Instrumental goods, or secondary goods, provide concrete means of securing primary goods and take the form of approach goals. Existential therapy Existential therapy is based on the premise that there are several factors that influence one's life, like culture and biology, and that the central problems people experience are due to isolation, anxiety, despair, and loneliness. The goal of therapy is to develop skills to make good life choices and use positive forces—like love, authenticity, and creativity— to create a meaningful life. Viktor Frankl, psychiatrist and author of Man's Search for Meaning, said that according to research there was a correlation between lack of meaning in one's life and depression, addictions, and criminal behavior. People who do not have a sense of meaning in their life are prone to neurotic compulsions and obsessions, boredom, materialism, hatred, power, and hedonistic pleasures. Rather than focusing on the past or future, existential therapy focuses on the present and the relationship with one's self, by being aware of one's feelings, using relaxation and other forms of therapies, and learning how to deal directly with issues. Yoga and meditation programs Yoga and meditation programs have been used in correctional facilities to promote reflection, mindfulness and patience, and reduce stress in an environment that is a breeding ground for violence and negative thinking. A yoga program was established in the United States at San Quentin State Prison in 2002 by James Fox. Formalized later as the Prison Yoga Project, it teaches asana, pranayama, and meditation practices—and how to train the mind not to be reactive—which helps individuals cope from past trauma and develop more productive behavior patterns. More than 100 jails and prisons in the United States have replicated the Prison Yoga Project programs. Steven Belenko, a professor with Temple University's Department of Criminal Justice states that yoga and meditation instruction could be provided via DVDs, which would be a relatively low-cost solution for prisons. Self-help groups and the 12-step program One of the most popular approaches in the Western world for self-change in the field of addiction is that of the twelve-step program. Self-help groups in general, and in particular the twelve-step programs, which emphasize spiritual and moral change, represent another aspect of positive criminology. The groups serve as a place for learning and practicing new behavior and values, alongside spiritual development. Research conducted among addicts who participated in the twelve-step program and the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) self- and mutual-help groups has identified several therapeutic elements that helped addicts in the recovery process, including change in their perception of life and finding new and noble meaning to life, spiritual awakening through faith in a higher power that helps them to abstain from psychoactive substances, transformation of anger and resentment into forgiveness, and sponsoring another person in the recovery process. According to Ronel (1998), self-help organizations such as NA constitute a bridge to recovery, connecting the drug subculture to the general dominant culture. The twelve-step program originated in AA and was then adopted by other self-help organizations that target a variety of problems, such as drug addiction (NA), eating disorders (Overeaters Anonymous [OA]), emotional disturbance (Emotions Anonymous [EA]), and others. Since its inception, the twelve-step program has caught the attention of professionals as a possible expert approach of therapy, first limited to addiction and later extended into other fields, such as domestic violence or victims' assistance, as well. It could, therefore, be perceived as being a general, professional treatment method and program for recovery, also known as Grace Therapy. In a professional setting, the 12 steps may be adapted to the changing needs of the participants.  Positive victimology  The concept of Positive Victimology evolved from positive criminology and it was first proposed by Natti Ronel and his research team. Positive victimology's focus is on those who were hurt by crime and/or abuse of power.  Studies =Social acceptance and life transformation Social acceptance and life transformation in the rehabilitation of imprisoned sex offenders was the first that was designed and conducted according to the principles of positive criminology. The purpose of this qualitative study was to identify the internal and external factors that assist imprisoned sex offenders to recover and change their way of life. Most participants reported that they had experienced personal and social changes during their current imprisonment, attributed to the support they received from various sources both inside and outside the jail, particularly spouses, parents, therapists, and religious figures. Participants reported that those who supported them expressed their social acceptance of them; note that this does not refer to unconditional acceptance, but one that requires taking responsibility and making a significant change by the side of the offender. It might be referred as conditioned love, where the conditions are for the benefits of the loved ones. It contains components similar to those included in the re-integrative shaming mechanism. Research findings also suggest that positive changes can be achieved even under harsh conditions such as imprisonment, through the encounter with human strengths. In a way that continues these findings, Siebrecht Vanhooren, Mia Leijssen, and Jessie Dezutter from the Department of Psychology, University of Leuven, Belgium, conducted a pilot study with a mixed-method design on posttraumatic growth and psychological stress in a sample of sexual offenders (n = 30) in ongoing therapy. Impact of interactions with volunteers  Several studies examined the impact of a personal encounter with perceived goodness, as represented by volunteers who are perceived as altruistic by those they help. The studies focused on the encounter between lay volunteers and either: (1) at-risk street youths in a mobile outreach service (a qualitative study), (2) at-risk youth in drop-in centers for youth at-risk in Israel (a qualitative and quantitative study) and (3) two experiments carried out by Niek Hoogervorst, Judith Metz, Lonneke Roza, and Eva van Baren from the Netherlands that support this indirect effect of volunteerism on affect-based trust. Altruism Many philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Nietzsche and Spinoza, already discussed the importance of using positive human components for creating a better human society. They also argued that the ability for human kindness is not predetermined but can be changed by external interventions, such as through exposing the individual to positive encounters that may lead to appropriate changes in the person and the surroundings.  Improving offender's well-being  Positive criminology stresses the healing effect of positively perceived experiences. During the last years there is an increase in research on happiness, understood as a subjective perception of well-being, and it seems it is finding its place in criminology research as well. Posttraumatic growth of South African ex- offenders Positive criminology associates social integration with rehabilitation and with human strengths. Tharina Guse and Daphne Hudson, from the University of Johannesburg, South Africa, conducted a study in 2014. Mindfulness and rehabilitation of young offenders Positive criminology looks for integrative means of rehabilitation, as an alternative to the disintegrative nature of incarceration. In a qualitative study, Carla Barret from John Jay College, New York, attempted to understand how young male participants benefited from yoga and mindfulness training within an Alternative to Incarceration (ATI) program.  Angola's Christian seminary  Michael Hallett and colleagues presented an ethnographic account of the \\"self-projects\\" of inmate graduates of Louisiana State Penitentiary's (\\"Angola's\\") unique prison seminary program.

She currently works as an associate professor at Yale University, where she has extensively researched the growth, restoration, and maintenance of skin cells. She is a currently a member of the Yale Cancer Center and Yale Stem Cell Center. She received a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2012 and in 2013 she was the recipient of the Rosalind Franklin Young Investigator Award.  Early life and education  Valerie Horsley was raised by a single mother, who was working toward her doctorate in industrial engineering throughout her early childhood. Horsley was often placed in the care of graduate students, who served as her babysitters. She initially considered a career in medicine working as a physician, but opted to pursue a career in research instead. In 1998, Horsley achieved a Bachelor of Science in biology at Furman University, and later her doctorate from Emory University in 2003. Career The research Horsley explored throughout the duration of her doctorate degree, which was supervised by Grace Pavlath, focused on the transcription factors involved in the development of skeletal muscle tissue. The lab that Horsley worked in discovered that smaller muscles in mice were associated with a lack of transcription factor NFATc2. She was able to determine that factor NFATc2 was a foundational component that allotted myoblast cells to fuse and develop muscle fibers. She also found that NFATc2 factor regulates the transcription of a cytokine, IL-4. Horsley later decided to shift away from muscle research to complete her postdoctoral training under the guidance of Elaine Fuchs at Rockefeller University. It was during this process that she investigated the factors that influence stem cell development in the skin, specifically the transcription of factor Blimp-1. After finding that eliminating the gene that encoded Blimp-1 led to oily skin in mice, Horsley discovered that Blimp-1 monitors the size of the sebaceous gland. In 2009, Horsley joined the faculty of Yale University and was promoted to an associate professor of dermatology in 2011, as well as the Maxine F. Singer ’57 Assistant Professor of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology.  Current research  In her Yale laboratory, Horsley has studied the cellular and molecular pathways involved in skin tissue development and maintenance, as well as the relationship between fat cells in the skin, wound healing, regeneration of hair follicles, and the formation of keratinocytes during embryonic development. Horsley currently studies adult stem cells in epithelial skin tissue and how these cells contribute to wound healing and the development of cancer, using the mouse as a genetic model system. Dr. Horsley revolutionized the field of epithelial stem cell biology by identifying skin adipocyte stem cells, establishing a major role for these progenitor cells in regulating turnover, rejuvenation and wound repair of the skin epidermis and hair follicles. She found that within epithelial tissues, cells tend to confine to distinct micro-environments. Mechanisms of adipocyte cells in tissue homeostasis and regeneration are not well understood. Horsley discovered the source of both fat cells and immune cells as local signals, as the hormone signal, prolactin, is responsible for stem cell activity and the regeneration of skin cells. Together, her laboratory also found that cell differentiation of adipocytes and hair growth occur simultaneously, and when the cell differentiation process (adipogenesis) ceases, hair growth stops and the follicles deteriorate. Her team identified specific adipose progenitors in the skin, which indicated the necessity of these cells to sufficiently induce hair follicle growth. These cells are activated after injury and are required for fibroblast migration during the wound healing process. The Horsley laboratory discovered that aging causes the loss of dermal adipocyte precursor cells regeneration, and therefore requires Pdgf signaling. Furthermore, adipocytes stem cells can form myofibroblasts after skin injury that generate extracellular matrix proteins and crosslink collagen and these cells are stimulated by macrophage-derived signaling proteins. Her research provides a link between the communication of various cells which lead to hair growth and wound healing, revealing a framework for the possible regulation of tissue repair and the development of various diseases. Mechanical forces are known to regulate the development, homeostasis and regeneration of multicellular tissues. To illustrate the mechanics involved in skin function, Horsley with E. Dufresne, used traction force microscopy to discover the physical properties of epithelial cell clusters. Using genetics, function-blocking antibodies and mathematical modeling, their work revealed the significance of physical cohesion through cadherin molecules with the coordination of mechanical force throughout multicellular clusters. Together with M. King, they identified a role of nuclear-cytoskeletal adhesion during the growth of the hair follicle. They found that inner nuclear membrane proteins of the Sun family are required for the process of keratinocyte adhesion and hair follicle structure through regulation of the cytoskeleton.  Awards  In 2008, Horsley was a regional finalist in the Blavatnik Awards for Young Scientists. In 2012, Horsley received the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers for her research of skin cell generation. Also in 2012, she was one of two recipients and received the Rosalind Franklin Young Investigator Award, presented every three years by the Genetics Society of America and the American Society of Human Genetics to two top women scientists in the field of genetics. In 2016, Horsley received the Montagna Lecture Award from the Society of Investigative Dermatology. In 2018, Horsley received the Graduate Division in Biomedical and Biological Sciences Distinguished Alumnus award from Emory University. Horsley's work and lab are supported by federal funding from the National Institutes of Health.  Public service  In 2016, Horsley began organizing in the community after the presidential election, forming Action Together CT, to engage Connecticut residents in CT politics. After realizing the lack of scientists in political decision making, Horsley made her first run for elected office in 2018, running for state senate in CT. She was endorsed by 314 Action, which seeks to elect scientists in the United States. She narrowly lost the three-way race to Jorge Cabrera. Horsley was elected to Hamden's legislative council in CT in 2019, winning the 4th district. Horsley's work in Hamden has focused on bringing LGBQT+ celebrations to Hamden and bringing financial responsibility to the town's budget.

He worked in the Romantic style popular in Belgium in the mid nineteenth century and was highly esteemed in Europe for his representations of historic naval battles.SCHAEFELS, Hendrik Frans (1827 - 1904), Painter, engraver, in: Benezit Dictionary of ArtistsHenri François Schaefels at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Life Hendrik Frans Schaefels was the son of Hendrik Raphael Schaefels, a decorative painter working in a Neo-Classical style and a teacher of decorative design at the Antwerp Academy. His older brother Lucas Victor Schaefels (1824-1885) became a successful still life painter and draughtsman and a teacher at the Antwerp Academy.Claire Baisier, '17th and 18th Century Drawings: The Van Herck Collection', King Baudoin Foundation, 2000, p. 292-294 The Algeciras at the Battle of Trafalgar Hendrik Frans Schaefels began as a student at the Antwerp Academy of landscape painter Jan Baptiste de Jonghe and landscape and marine painter Jacob Jacobs. After leaving the Academy he worked between his 15th and 17th year at the studio of Jan Michiel Ruyten, a painter of cityscapes, Ruyten's work would leave an important mark on Schaefels' own cityscapes.Max Rooses, 'Hendrik Schaefels' in: Max Rooses, 'Oude en Nieuwe Kunst', Boekhandel J. Vuylsteke, Ghent, 1896, p.156-166 A seascape by Schaefel was accepted at the tri-annual salon of Antwerp when the artist was only 17 years old. Schaefels spent his entire career in Antwerp. He was friends with leading Antwerp artists and intellectuals such as Hendrik Conscience, Jan Lambrecht Domien Sleeckx, Max Rooses, Frans Van Kuyck and Peter Benoit.Josef Muls, Frank VAN DEN WIJNGAERT: Hendrik Schaefels, Teekenaar van het schip en van de oud- Antwerpsche Haven. - N.V.

Standaard-Boekhandel, Antwerpen z.j., p. 466-467 Schaefels was a member of the association 'Artibus Patriae', which was founded in 1865 with the goal of supporting new acquisitions by the museums in Antwerp. He was for a time engaged in local politics for the Catholic Party. From 1869 to 1872 he had a seat on the Antwerp city council where he represented the interests of artists and art promotion in general. Work=General Naval battle Hendrik Frans Schaefels worked in many genres including history paintings, seascapes, genre paintings, landscapes with figures and cityscapes. His early work, which was influenced by Jan Michiel Ruyten, consisted mainly of cityscapes of Antwerp and genre scenes. He is now principally known for his seascapes often representing historical events such as sea battles and for his cityscapes of Antwerp. Marine paintings Belgium was in the grip of Romantic art at the time Schaefels started out on his artistic career. Belgian Romantic painters such as Gustaf Wappers, Nicaise de Keyser, Edouard Hamman and Louis Gallait gained international success with their history paintings. These usually depicted glorious or famous events in the history of what became the state of Belgium, which had only recently been established as an independent country in 1830. Such historic themes were the favorite subjects of artists working in the years from 1830 to 1850. Hendrik Frans Schaefels combined in his work this tradition of history painting and marine art. He excelled in his dramatic portrayals of naval battles and other historical events that took place at sea such as the Battle of Trafalgar, episodes from the wars between England and the Dutch Republic. His large compositions, with sizes varying from 2 to 9 meters long, often showed a pseudo-Baroque design. Schaefels painted both compositions depicting an entire naval battle as well as more anecdotal episodes depicting the action on the deck of a single warship such as in the Death of Nelson. For his naval battles he relied on historical literature and printed materials.Norbert Hostyn, Schilders van de zee at Openbaar Kunstbezit Vlaanderen Schaefels also painted more recent and peaceful marine events such as the Queen Victoria on board the Royal Yacht, which depicts the 1843 visit of Ostend by Queen Victoria with her husband Prince Albert.Trusts and Estates, Volume 121, Fiduciary Publishers, 1982, p. 46 Cityscapes and genre paintings Stoelstraatje and the tower of the St Paul's Church Hendrik Frans Schaefels painted many views of the city of Antwerp which provide important documentary evidence on the city in the 19th century. These works showed the influence of his master Jan Michiel Ruyten. Like other Belgian Romantic painters such as Henri Leys and Nicaise De Keyser he drew inspiration from Goethe's Faust as seen in his Scene from Goethe's Faust (1863, auctioned at Dorotheum on 15 February 2011 in Vienna, lot 31). An interesting composition painted by Schaefels twice is The grave of Rubens and his family upon its opening in 1855. The composition shows Rubens' opened grave lit by candles and is thus at the same time a document of the event as well as an expression of Schaefels' Romantic veneration for the great Antwerp master Rubens.Ludo Dosogne, Belgische romantiek heeft vele gezichten, in: Openbaar Kunstbezit Vlaanderen 2005-1, p. 21-23 Margit Didelez, EEN BEELD VAN EEN KUNSTENAAR Belgische kunstenaarsportretten 1830 – 1900, Master thesis Universiteit Gent Academiejaar 2010 – 2011, p. 31 Schaefles also painted in his early career a number of genre scenes such as Admiring the newborn (1857, auctioned at Christie's on 19–20 September 2006 in Amsterdam, lot 204). Illustrations Hendrik Frans Schaefels was in demand as a book illustrator and provided illustrations to various contemporary publications. He illustrated the 1854 collection of short stories entitled 'Dorpsverhalen' (\\"Village stories') by Flemish writer Jan Renier Snieders and was one of the illustrators of the novel 'De gasthuisnon: een verhael uit onzen tyd' ('The hospital nun: a story of our time') by August Snieders.Jan Renier Snieders, Henry Schaefels, 'Dorpsverhalen', Van Dieren, 1854 August Snieders (junior), J. B. Wittkamp, Henry Schaefels, Luc Schaefels, Henry Brown, Jos Hemeleer, De gasthuisnon: een verhael uit onzen tyd, J. P. Van Dieren en Company, 1855 He was one of various Belgian graphic artists such as Adolf Dillens and Félicien Rops who provided illustrations to the second edition of 'The Legend of Thyl Ulenspiegel and Lamme Goedzak' published in Paris in 1869.La procession qui se gratte at Erfgoedinzicht Charles de Coster, 'La légende et les aventures d'Ulenspiegel et de Lamme Goedzak, Paris, 1869 Drawings and graphic work Hendrik Frans Schaefels made many drawings which served as studies for his paintings. He spent much of his time outdoors drawing the ships and activities in the port of Antwerp and houses and people in the streets of Antwerp. His drawings are careful and picturesque. His drawings include studies of all types of ships, cutters, shock cherry, clubs, people on the docks, the wharf, the dockyards and the first steamships such as the 'British Queen' and 'Baron Osy'. The drawings and the notes that Schaefels added to his drawings provide historical information on maritime and river transport of the time. A selection of his drawings are in the collection of the Plantin-Moretus Museum in Antwerp. Schaefels was an avid engraver and his prints depict the same subjects as his drawings and are executed in a loose style.

William McGilvery House is a historic house on East Main Street in Searsport, Maine. Built in 1873 for a prominent local ship's captain, businessman and politician, it is one of mid-coast Maine's finest examples of residential Second Empire architecture. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, and is a contributing property to Searsport's East Main Street Historic District. Description and history The William McGilvery House stands on the north side of East Main Street (United States Route 1), just north of the house of his brother John. It is a roughly cubic 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, topped by a mansard roof and clad in flushboarding treated to resemble ashlar stone. The roof has elaborately decorated dormers projecting from the steep roof section, which is flared at the eave, and has a dentillated cornice line at the break between the roof sections. The main eave is also dentillated, with paired brackets at intervals. A large wall dormer with a gambrel gable rises at the center of the front facade, with wooden finials at the roof corners. A porch extends across the front, supported by groups of square posts and pilasters. The house was built in 1873 for William McGilvery, a ship's captain from a local family prominent in the shipping business, and is one of a cluster of high-quality houses built around that time by related captains on East Main Street. McGilvery was one of five brothers, all of whom became sea captains.

Having made her debut as a screenwriter in 2011, she transitioned into filmmaking with her directorial feature debut What Are The Odds, a Netflix film starring Abhay Deol, Karanvir Malhotra, Monica Dogra and Yashaswini Dayama. Ramaswamy's body of work includes two other acclaimed short-films as well. The hybrid short documentary, Newborns, giving an inside look into the lives of acid- attack survivors, and Bunny - Ramaswamy's first fiction short film. Both films premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and have traveled to several other film festivals, having being met with critical response and accolades . They've both also seen releases on the cinephile OTT service, MUBI. Outside film, Ramaswamy co-hosts Cause Effect, a platform that produces cause related content and outreach programs. Her banner, Missfit Films, is dedicated to producing innovative films, which subscribe to being neither independent nor commercial. Career=Early work and directorial debut (2011–14) Ramaswamy studied film at the Film and Television Institute of India, Pune. She moved to Mumbai after graduating and was discovered by Anurag Kashyap, who offered her a writing job in his production. She worked as a screenwriter for Bejoy Nambiar's 2011 black comedy Shaitan, which received positive response from film critics. Ramaswamy made her directorial debut with the 2014 short film Newborns. Set in New Delhi, the film follows the daily lives of acid attack survivors. The film takes us through the ennui of their domestic and public spaces in a nameless dystopian city, its factories, houses and motels, and its promises, never honoured. The film featured Laxmi Agarwal and other New Delhi-based human rights activists and a survivors of acid attacks. Newborns had is works premiere at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. The film won the German Star Award for Best Documentary at the \\"Indisches Filmfestival Stuttgart, JIFF’15 Worldwood International Panorama and Moonfaze Feminist Film Festival in LA. In addition to those, Newborns was awarded the Best Short Documentary Award at the Mumbai Women's International Film Festival and the Delhi Shorts International Film Festival (Jury Prize). At the London Asian Film Festival, the film won both the Audience and the Jury Award for Best Short Film. The film was also given the cARTel Select Special Mention for Innovation Award in Los Angeles. During the making of the film, director Megha Ramaswamy executed a nationwide initiative called the ‘Spot of Shame’ campaign that aims to generate public awareness around the issue of acid-attack violence and to terminate the recurrence of such attacks. In association with Stop Acid Attacks, a Delhi-based NGO, ‘Spot of Shame’ entails marking ‘spots’ in the city where women have been attacked with acid in broad daylight.https://www.saddahaq.com/megha-ramaswamy-talks-about-newborns-and- her-campaign-for-acid-attack-victims For the campaign, typography was designed and stencilled into walls, street plays were performed, placards and signs were displayed. This was primarily to serve as a constant reminder of public apathy and government negligence.http://www.shortfilmwindow.com/article/in- focus-a-fascinating-mind-megha-ramaswamy/  Short Films (2015–16)  In 2015, Ramaswamy’s MissFit Films created Bunny, a live-action short film that explores the fantasies and fears that accompany childhood. Bunny is an elegiac look at how fantastical childhood is, and evocative of the heartbreak with which we leave it behind. The film had its world premiere at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). Bunny has been acquired by sales agents New Europe Film Sales and is distributed via Canal Plus and EU Shorts in Europe. According to the Indian Express, \\"The 15-minute silent short unfolds through visuals and required Ramaswamy to develop a visual code that would serve as a way to communicate the film’s emotions to the audience.\\"http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/down-the- rabbit-hole/ In 2016, Ramaswamy premiered her latest documentary short, The Last Music Store at the South Asian International Film Festival (SAIFF), where it won the Audience Award for Best Documentary. The 38-minute film documents the closure of Rhythm House, Mumbai’s oldest large format music and video store, that went out of business due to rise of piracy and highlights the lament of the store’s eccentric, dedicated, long-standing employees of the store and how they cope with this loss. Ramaswamy's connection with Rhythm House first started when she first discovered the store back in 2001. Ramaswamy met Aliya Curmally, producer of The Last Music Store and daughter of Rhythm House owner Amir Curmally, at a writing programme.http://www.mid- day.com/articles/film-on-mumbais-iconic-rhythm-house-to-premier-at- international-film-fest/17782188 The film does not delve into Rhythm House’s commercial history but instead asserts its role in enhancing Mumbai’s musical culture over the decades.http://thereel.scroll.in/a/823173 In March 2016, a short sneak peek of the film was released on Facebook and instantly went viral. It was covered by various news sites such as BuzzFeed, ScoopWhoop, Scroll.in and many more.https://www.scoopwhoop.com/Watch-This-Tribute-Video- For-Rhythm-House-Will-Give-You-Goosebumps/#.tdn59wanw  \\"What Are The Odds?\\" future projects (2017- present)  Megha's first feature film \\"What Are The Odds?\\" follows the story of two unintentional teenage friends, Vivek (Yashaswini Dayama) and Ashwin (Karanvir Malhotra), who skip a scholarship exam and end-up spending an entire day together. The film uses elements of magical realism to tell a whimsical coming-of-age story as the duo meet a variety of characters, both human and animal, played by an ensemble of actors that includes Abhay Deol, Manu Rishi, Monica Dogra and Priyanka Bose. In an interview, Megha revealed the film was an homage to filmmakers she admires like John Hughes and Wes Anderson. Initially knowns as \\"The Odds\\", the film premiered at the closing night gala for the Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles in 2019. Having been showcased at various film festivals across the world, it saw an exclusive worldwide release on the streaming platform, Netflix on 20th May, 2020. The film was met with generally favourable reviews, with NDTV praising it in a review for \\"not ticking boxes, but reinventing them\\". The New Indian Express called it \\" A charming new age fairy tale\\", praising the film's outlandish staging, screenplay and narration. While most reviews seem to praise the cinematography, visual style and performances delivered by leads Yashaswini Dayama and Karanvir Malhotra, a few have critiqued the film's lack of substance. Rahul Desai called the film a \\"pretty but pointless flight of whimsy\\" while Firstpost called it an \\"ambitious film which is a delirious pleasure till the madness withers out\\". Ramaswamy's next feature film Reshma Shera is currently being produced by JAR Pictures. It is a story about a little girl and her dog, and was last showcased at Berlinale Co- production Market, 2019.

He held the American record in the men's 3000-meter steeplechase from 1934 to 1952 and briefly held the world best in 1936. He represented the United States in the steeplechase at the 1936 Summer Olympics, placing fifth. Biography Manning was born in Sedgwick, Kansas on January 9, 1909. He took up running as a schoolboy; in 1927, his senior year at Sedgwick High School, he won the mile run at both the Kansas state meet and the national interscholastic meet in Chicago. After graduating from high school Manning went to Wichita University on an athletic scholarship. In 1929 Manning placed second in the two-mile run at the NCAA championships; he led for most of the way, but lost a close final lap duel against defending champion Dave Abbott of Illinois. At that year's United States outdoor championships, organized by the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), Manning placed third in the mile. Manning won the two miles at the 1930 NCAA meet, becoming Wichita University's first national champion; his winning time, 9:18.1, broke Abbott's meeting record from 1928 and missed Tell Berna's collegiate record from 1912 by only three-tenths of a second. Manning graduated from Wichita University in 1931. Manning attempted to qualify for the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in the 3000-meter steeplechase; he won at the Midwestern Tryouts in 9:20.1, then his personal best. He entered the final United States Olympic Trials as one of the favorites to make the American team, but failed to replicate his earlier form; he placed fifth in 9:35.0, missing third place and the final Olympic spot by approximately eighty yards. Manning won his first AAU championship title in the steeplechase in 1934, outkicking defending champion Joe McCluskey in 9:13.1; he broke McCluskey's American record of 9:14.5 from the 1932 Olympic Trials. At the 1935 AAU championships Manning placed second behind McCluskey, but he regained the title in 1936. World best and Olympics The 1936 United States Olympic Trials were held at Randall's Island Stadium in New York City on July 11 and July 12, a week after the 1936 AAU championships. Closing with a fast sprint, Manning won the 3000-meter steeplechase in 9:08.2, qualifying for the Olympic Games; his time broke Volmari Iso-Hollo's world mark of 9:09.4 from 1933. In his record run Manning hurdled the water jumps without touching the barriers, then a new technique. The warm conditions at the Trials (which were held during the 1936 North American heat wave) were not conducive to setting records in long- distance races; interviewed after the race, Manning noted he was used to hot weather. The International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) did not ratify world records in the steeplechase before 1954, so Manning's time was only a world best; it was officially ratified as an American record but not as a world record. Manning's record made him one of the favorites for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, although Iso-Hollo, who was the defending Olympic champion, was still expected to take the gold again. Manning's chances were damaged when he fell ill en route to the Olympics and recovered slowly. In Berlin he placed second behind Iso-Hollo in his heat; in the final he stayed in medal contention for most of the way but was outkicked at the end and placed fifth in 9:11.2. Iso-Hollo, who won in 9:03.8, regained the world best; the other medalists (Kaarlo Tuominen and Alfred Dompert) also broke Manning's Trials mark. Manning's American record lasted until 1952, when Horace Ashenfelter ran 9:06.4 at the U.S. Olympic Trials. Manning died in Wichita, Kansas on January 26, 2003. He was inducted into the Pizza Hut Shocker Sports Hall of Fame as a charter member in 1980, and was posthumously named to the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame and the Wichita Sports Hall of Fame.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The Farnsworth House is set on the west side of SR 117, between the Lakewood Pines Campground and the road's junction with North Bridgton Road. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, end chimneys, clapboard siding, and stone foundation. The main (east-facing) facade is symmetrically arranged, with a wide central bay housing the main entrance, which is flanked by sidelight windows and topped by a fanlight. A single-story porch extends across the southern facade, supported by Doric columns; it has been partially enclosed. An ell extends to the building rear, joining it to a carriage house. The interior of the house has extremely high- quality delicate Federal period woodwork, including wall paneling, fireplace mantels, crown molding, and a front stairway with paired newel posts. The house was built in 1825 for Dr. Samuel Farnsworth, Jr. Despite its relatively remote location, the house exhibits interior Federal period woodwork that is comparable to that found in Maine's coastal communities in greater concentration.

Forster's mother Lily, who was widowed, rented the property between 1883 and 1893. Mother and child had to leave, unwillingly, when the owners wished it vacated. History and residents The house was originally known as Upper Rooks Nest, but was known as Howards to distinguish it from its neighbour, Lower Rooks Nest Farm, taking the name from the family who farmed there. The Howard family farmed from Rooks Nest House for over 300 years until one Mr Howard's small farm failed due to bad harvests and the importation of cheap straw hats from China and Japan. The family also owned (Lower) Rooks Nest Farm until the early 1700s when it was acquired by the neighbouring Chesfield estate. The Howards prospered in the 18th century but were less fortunate in the 19th century and it was probably too small to be economically viable, while the neighbouring farm continued to grow. The Howards family were all baptised, married and buried at the nearby St Nicholas' Church. One of the Howards sold the house in 1882 to their neighbour, Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Hindley Wilkinson of Chesfield Park, whose land was adjacent to the hamlet of Rooks Nest, and he then owned the whole of Rooks Nest, including Rooks Nest Farm and the cottages. Where the Howard family went after this is unknown. Wilkinson gave the house a \\"perfunctory renovation\\" and changed its name, and the house was mentioned in an 1882 marriage settlement between Caroline, Wilkinson's only surviving child, and Charles Poyntz-Stewart of Upper Norwood, where it was referred to as \\"Rooksnest late Howards Farm\\". Wilkinson advertised the house to let in 1882, at £55 per year including four acres of pasture, or £45 without pasture. The widowed Lily Forster was looking for a home away from London with her son, Morgan (the author E. M. Forster). The house became Forster's childhood home, and he and his mother lived there from March 1883 to 1893. Aged 5, while living in the house, Forster gave lessons to the servant girls, who were aged 10 to 15, in dancing, geography and astrology. Forster also played hide and seek with them, allowing him to discover the house intimately. Forster was fascinated with the house and had affection for it, seeing it as a secure home, though his mother never set down roots locally. Wilkinson died in 1888 and the property was inherited by his daughter, Caroline Poyntz-Stewart Meanwhile, Lily became friends with the Poston family, including Charles Poston, who moved into Highfield in Pin Green near Stevenage in 1886, with his wife, Clementine, son, Charles, and daughter, Mary. The Forsters moved out of Rooks Nest in 1893 and Lily moved to Tonbridge so Forster could school there as a day boy, but the decision was hastened by Poyntz-Stewart's refusal to renew the lease. Forster was homesick so drew a sketch map of the house and garden, and wrote a brief \\"Rooks Nest memoir\\". Elizabeth Poston, composer and president of the Society of Women Musicians, was born at Highfield in 1905 and in 1914, the widowed Clementine Poston, daughter Elizabeth and son Ralph moved to Rooks Nest House as tenants of the Poyntz-Stewarts of Chesfield. Forster and Poston went on to meet at a concert at the National Gallery during the war, and he became a regular visitor to his old home. Poston stayed at Rooks Nest after her mother's death and was able to buy it. Forster and Poston had installed a plaque on the exterior wall of the building that read: \\"E. M. Forster, Elizabeth Poston, Clementine Poston lived here and loved this place\\". Poston stayed there until her death in 1987. Rooks Nest was then occupied by Dr Malcolm Williamson, the Australian-born Master of the Queen's Music. In September 2017 the house was put up for sale with a guide price of £1.5 million. Influence on Forster's works Howards End (1910) was Forster's novel about his childhood home. Forster's \\"Rooksnest memoir\\", written by 1894 when he was 15, mentions Wilkinson as the landlord. Forster's dislike of Wilkinson and the fact he made his mother unhappy led to him thinking all landlords unpleasant. The Postons were unwitting prototypes to the characters Charles and Ruth Wilcox in Howards End. Forster continued to visit the house into the later 1940s, and he retained the furniture all his life. The memoir was published with the Penguin Modern Classics edition of Howards End. Another memoir by Forster, from the 1940s and about West Hackhurst, Abinger Hammer in Surrey, which was his home from 1925, returns to the associations of Rooks Nest. Lily arranged for successive garden boys to play with Morgan on Wednesday afternoons but they were young and never stayed for long. Morgan's favourite garden boy was called Ansell and in The Longest Journey (1907), the character of Stewart Ansell is a \\"guardian angel\\" to Ricky. Ansell, written in 1903, published 1972, is another tribute to him. Description Rooks Nest House is located on a hill at the northern edge of Stevenage. In 1882 it was described as \\"Beautifully situated with extensive views over some of the prettiest parts of Hertfordshire.\\" The house was always in Stevenage parish. According to the 1976 listing by Historic England, the house is of 17th century or earlier origins and was refronted in the 18th century. The main structure of the house is timber framed, and its front wall is of red brick with some grey headers. It has a tiled roof with two gabled lattice casement dormers. There are two storeys and attics. The first floor has three casement windows with glazing bars under cambered arches. The ground floor has a similar casement window, a French window on the left and a canted bay window on the right. There is a large central chimneystack. The ground floor has a bressummer to a wide fireplace, the timber framework is exposed in some rooms and there are 18th century fielded panelled doors. The house originally had a thatched roof, which attracted mice, and some is still intact under its later covering of tile. The Howard family had 17 acres of land with the property. It was the Howards who rebuilt the front of the house in the 18th century and installed \\"fashionable\\" panelled doors in all rooms. Rooks Nest House still had at 17 acres of land by 1871, but the 1882 marriage settlement described the land as including \\"house and homestead, home close and malthouse close\\", with pasturage of 4 acres, 3 roods and 4 perches. When the Fosters were living there it remained relatively unmodernised. Running water was not available until after the Forsters had left, although the hamlet of Rooks Nest was notable as the site of Stevenage's first fresh water supply from a borehole opened here in 1885. However, the borehole did not benefit the Forsters and they did not have a well and they had to purchase drinking water from next door, the Franklin family at Rooks Nest Farm. An 1882 advert to let the house listed a drawing room, dining room, kitchen, hall, scullery, pantry and larder on the ground floor, four bedrooms on the first floor, attics, WC and cellars. Lily Forster wrote to a friend, describing the house as \\"a very old gabled house and yet it is perfectly new, it has been refurbished\\" and described two sitting rooms, a large hall and six bedrooms. She brought her own furniture into the house and set about decorating the house to her own taste, surrounding the fireplace in the drawing room with a large dark-wood ornate mantlepiece that dominated the room. Lily had the room photographed and a copy sent to a family member, in which she mentioned \\"two little black tea tables\\", \\"a tall, old-fashioned bureau [with] a small oak bookcase on each side of it\\" and a \\"piano opposite the window\\". Some years later she had the house redecorated. The house was designated a Grade I listed building on 30 September 1976 for \\"historic interest and literary associations\\". Forster Country The monument to Forster in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, near Rooks Nest where Forster grew up. He based the setting for his novel Howards End on this area, now informally known as Forster Country. The building is on the edge of Stevenage, which has expanded massively since being designated a new town in the 1940s. As at 2020, the countryside towards Graveley has been protected as green belt, preserving the views from the house. The area to the north west and west of Rooks Nest House is the only farmland remaining in Stevenage (the area to the east of the house now comprises the St Nicholas neighbourhood of the town). The landscape was termed 'Forster Country' in a letter to The Times signed by a number of literary figures, published on 29 December 1960, written in response to two compulsory purchase orders made by the Stevenage Development Corporation, and expressed the hope that 200 acres of countryside around the house could be preserved both as one of the last beauty spots within 30 miles of London and \\"because it is the Forster country of Howards End.\\" The letter says, \\"Literate people the world over feel that it [Forster country] should be preserved in its original setting as one of our greatest literary landmarks.\\" It was signed by W. H. Auden, John Betjeman, Sir Arthur Bryant, Lord David Cecil, Graham Greene, John G. Murray, Harold Nicolson, Max Reinhardt, Dr C. V. Wedgewood and Vita Sackville-West. In 1979, the centenary of the author's birth, the area was officially named the Forster Country by local planners after efforts by a campaign group, the Friends of the Forster Country, which aims to preserve the landscape that Forster knew for future generations. The area was first named Forster Country in The Guardian in 1961. Friends of the Forster Country were victorious in 1994 when they helped to get a government agreement to modify the Green Belt boundary to \\"protect for all time the open green space to the north of Stevenage known as the Forster Country\\". However, as of 2020, there are proposals for housing developments in the area. On 29 November 1997 a sculpture marking Forster's connection with the area was unveiled beside St Nicholas churchyard by the MP for Stevenage, Barbara Follett. The sculpture is marked with the words \\"Only Connect\\" with a fuller text: \\"THE RAINBOW BRIDGE THAT SHOULD CONNECT THE PROSE IN US WITH THE PASSION\\". Only Connect is the world's only monument to Forster. It was carved by Angela Godfrey on commission from the Friends of the Forster Country with joint financing from Stevenage Borough Council and Hertfordshire County Council. The title is in acknowledgement of the subtitle of Howards End and it marks the entry to Forster Country.

Since its inception in 2010, AURA Music and Arts Festival has stayed true to its mission of showcasing the best regional and national touring bands in the underground jam community and live-electronic scene, building an event that brings fans together for a magical weekend of music, family and good times! Treating festivalgoers to a variety of musical styles ranging from rock, funk and jazz to roots reggae, jam-tronica and deep house, the vibe at AURA is unlike any other festival, creating a community of music, arts, culture and togetherness. AURA Music and Arts Festival is also known for its extensive Yoga & Healing Arts program, which is curated by a team of local Florida based experts. The program is well known in the community featuring multiple classes and workshops each day including: Shake your Asana, It Takes Two Thai Massage and Acro Yoga, Siesta Savasana, Chakra Balancing, Didgeridoo Healing, Group Chant and Sacred Space Creation.  History  AURA Music and Arts Festival was established in 2010 by Florida-based AURA Music Group, LLC. This business was started by Daryl Wolff (Executive Producer), Carlos \\"CJ\\" Rodrigues (Operations), Craig Heneveld (Operations) and Bianca Garza (Vending Coordinator). Wolff, Rodrigues and Heneveld had a history of producing shows in Florida together before coming together to form the first annual festival. In 2011, Cameron Troy Ferguson (Operations Director) came on board the already existing team. Currently, AURA Music Group, LLC is owned and managed by Wolff and Ferguson. AURA started in January 2010 in Brooksville, FL at the Sertoma Youth Ranch. With a small expected attendance, the staff was overly surprised when almost 1000 patrons showed up for the inaugural event. It quickly became apparent that the venue could not hold the growth of the show, so Wolff started a search for larger properties, and stumbled upon the Forever Florida property in St. Cloud, FL. With over 4000 acres, the property was happy to welcome the festival and its growth (Wolff found the property using Google Earth). The festival was produced for its 2nd and 3rd years in St. Cloud, but in 4th year was moved to its current home, the Spirit of the Suwannee Music Park. AURA currently hosts 5000+ patrons, artists and guests each year and continues to grow at a rate of about 25-30% annually, much of which can be attributed to its strong grass-roots marketing campaign and strong social reach. Marketing and publicity for the entire history of the event has been handled by Matthew Beck and Destiny Spang of Brotherly Love Productions.

Bred in Kentucky, he began his racing career in France and won two of his seventeen starts before moving back to the United States as a four-year-old in the spring of 1988. He won the Red Smith Handicap on his North American debut and in November he defeated a top-class international field in the Japan Cup. He remained in training for two further seasons and ran well in several major contests but recorded only one minor win. He was retired to stud in Japan but died in 1991 after one season as a breeding stallion. Background Pay the Butler was a bay horse bred in Kentucky by Robin Scully's Clovelly Farm. He was sired by the French stallion Val de l'Orne who won the Prix du Jockey Club in 1975. His other progeny included the Queen's Plate winners Golden Choice and La Lorgnette as well as the Hollywood Derby winner Victory Zone. Pay The Butler's dam Princess Morvi produced several other winners including River God (also by Val de l'Orne) who won the Queen's Vase and finished third in the St Leger. She was a descendant of the influential French broodmare L'Esperance. As a yearling, the colt was offered for sale at Keeneland in September 1985 but failed to reach his reserve price of $20,000. Racing career=1986 & 1987: two- and three-year-old seasons As a two-year-old, Pay the Butler raced in France and failed to win in five races although he finished third in the Listed Prix Herbager at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse. In the following year was unplaced in eight of his nine races but recorded his first victory when he won the Listed Grand Prix de Strasbourg on 28 May. 1988: four-year-old season In the early part of 1988, Pay the Butler raced three times in France, winning a handicap race at Longchamp Racecourse on April 4 and was then sent to the United States to be trained by Robert J. Frankel. On his first appearance for his new trainer Pay the Butler contested the Grade II Red Smith Handicap over ten furlongs at Belmont Park on May 28 and won by a neck from Equalize. He continued to run well in the United States, finishing second in both the Bowling Green Handicap and the Man o' War Stakes before running unplaced in the Canadian International Stakes on October 16. Pay the Butler was sent to Japan to contest the eighth running of the Japan Cup at Tokyo Racecourse on November and started at odds of 13.9/1 in a fourteen-runner field. There was a strong European contingent comprising Tony Bin from Italy, Moon Madness and Shady Heights (International Stakes) from Britain and Kondor (Preis von Europa, Aral-Pokal) from Germany. The other North American contenders were Salem Drive (Gulfstream Park Turf Handicap) and My Big Boy (Bernard Baruch Handicap) whilst the Southern hemisphere was represented by the New Zealand-bred gelding Bonecrusher. The best of the \\"home team\\" appeared to be Tamamo Cross, who started favourite after wins in the Takarazuka Kinen and the Tenno Sho and the three-year-old Oguri Cap. Ridden by Chris McCarron, Pay the Butler won by half a length from Tamamo Cross, with Oguri Cap taking third just ahead of My Big Boy, Tony Bin and Moon Madness. On his final appearance of the year, Pay the Butler finished sixth behind the Breeders' Cup Turf winner Great Communicator in the Hollywood Turf Cup Stakes at Hollywood Park Racetrack on December 24. 1989: five-year-old season Pay the Butler failed to win in nine starts as a five-year-old in 1989 but ran well in several major turf races. He finished second in the Pan American Handicap and the Oak Tree Invitational Stakes as well as running third in the John Henry Handicap and the Bowling Green Handicap. On his final start of the year he attempted to repeat his 1988 success in the Japan Cup. He was gain ridden by McCarron and finished third of the fifteen runners behind Horlicks and Oguri Cap. 1990: six-year-old season Pay the Butler began his 1990 campaign by winning an allowance race at Hollywood Park in May but failed to make any impact in five subsequent races. On his final appearance he finished fourth in an allowance at Hollywood in November. Stud record Pay the Butler was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion in Japan but died in 1991 after one season at stud. The best of his only crop of foals was Pal Bright, a mare who recorded Grade III wins in the Niigata Kinen and the Hakodate Kinen.

The derailment resulted in 11 deaths among those aboard, while the 42 others aboard the train were injured. It was the first fatal derailment in the history of the TGV and the third derailment since the TGV entered commercial service in 1981. The test train was traveling eastbound on the southern track when it entered a curve at —which was above its assigned speed—causing the rear bogie of the lead power car to derail to the left (outside of curve) due to centrifugal forces. The lead power car separated from the rest of the train, and the rear of the lead power car struck the concrete parapet on the abutment to a bridge over the Marne–Rhine Canal. The power car slid along the left parapet of the bridge and overturned, sliding down the embankment and coming to a rest beyond the end of the bridge. Cars 2–7 derailed before the bridge and travelled off the embankment with enough speed to overshoot the canal and come to rest beyond the beginning of the bridge. Cars 8–9 came to rest on the east bank of the canal and the rear power car ended up partially submerged in the canal. According to investigators, late braking, which led to the train entering the curve at excessive speed, was the immediate cause of the accident. Criminal and technical investigations are . French national rail operator SNCF suspended test trials at high speeds until the lessons learned from the investigation were integrated into testing process. The scheduled opening of the second phase of the LGV Est for commercial service was delayed three months, from 3 April 2016 to 3 July 2016. Background The LGV Est européenne (often shortened to LGV Est) is a high- speed rail line connecting Paris and Strasbourg. Development has been divided into two phases. The first phase, from Vaires-sur-Marne near Paris, to Baudrecourt opened on 10 June 2007. Construction on the second phase, from Baudrecourt to Vendenheim, near Strasbourg, began in 2010. The final weld of rails on the second phase occurred in March 2015, marking the completion of the line, although some work remained. At the time of the derailment, the line was scheduled to open for commercial service on 3 April 2016, following commissioning trials and training for operators. The scheduled tests for the line consisted of four phases: #Factory testing of components of the line, completed in 2013–14; #On-site testing of components and functioning of subsystems, completed in 2013–2014; #Static testing of subsystems with slow- moving trains, completed from late 2014 to August 2015; #Dynamic testing of the line with trains operating at high speed, began in September 2015 and scheduled to have been completed in November 2015. A specialized test train, Dasye set 744 in a commemorative livery, arrived to conduct the fourth phase of testing, which began on 28 September 2015. During this phase, more than 200 test runs would be performed on the line. The test runs would test ride smoothness, performance of the catenary, radio communications, and the signalling system. During some runs, the test train would operate at 10% above the planned operational speeds for the line when it enters service. Some automated safety systems were disabled to allow the test train to operate beyond normal operating conditions. Orientation training for operators was scheduled to take place between January and March 2016 prior to the start of commercial service on the line, which was scheduled for 3 April 2016 at the time of the accident. In January 2016, SNCF announced that the opening of the line would be delayed until 3 July 2016. Accident=Departure Tests scheduled for 11 and 14 November were to traverse each of the two tracks, in both directions of travel and at a test speed 10% above the speed limit when the line is in commercial service. On the afternoon of 14 November, the test train was scheduled to depart Meuse TGV Station at 14:18 and arrive at Strasbourg Station at 15:17. At 14:26, authorization was given to begin the test and the test train left Meuse TGV Station two minutes later. During this test, the test train traveled eastbound on Track 2, the southern track on the east–west oriented LGV Est, in the direction opposite normal operation (Strasbourg towards Paris). The Meuse-Strasbourg run was the last series of tests on the line during the fourth phase of tests. The train reached a maximum speed of on sections where the speed limit will be . As the train approached the flying junction in the commune of Vendenheim, it should have slowed from before reaching Kilometer Point (KP) 403.809, where the speed limit for commercial service will be . As the track begins a long, right-hand curve into the flying junction, it is raised on an embankment, approximately high, and crosses a bridge over the Marne–Rhine Canal. The flying junction marks the end of the LGV Est line, after which the train was to continue on an existing, non-high-speed rail line leading to Strasbourg Station. Derailment pantograph (3) and its subassembly (4), detached from one of the power cars, is seen in the bottom center. There is also a bogie remaining on the tracks (5). As the train entered the right-hand curve into the flying junction, the rear bogie of the lead power car derailed to the left (outside of the curve) at 15:04:42 at approximately KP 404.003. Violent transverse movements at the rear of the lead power car caused it to separate from the rest of the train. The rear of the lead power car struck a concrete parapet (KP 404.209) on the leading abutment to the bridge over the Marne–Rhine Canal. The impact broke apart the lead power car and caused oil to leak from the lead power car's transformer, which ignited and was spread across the bridge and canal banks. The rear bogie of the lead power car remained where it impacted the concrete parapet. The transformer of the lead power car landed on the east bank of the canal. The remainder of the lead power car slid along the left parapet of the bridge. At the end of the bridge, it overturned, slid down the embankment and came to a rest beyond the end of the bridge. Cars 2–7 derailed before the bridge and traveled off the embankment with enough speed to overshoot the canal and come to rest beyond the beginning of the bridge. Cars 8–9 came to rest on the east bank of the canal and the rear power car ended up partially submerged in the canal. Response and casualties At 15:05, the train disappeared from the approach zone for the Vendenheim junction on the display being monitored by staff at the signalling control center. At 15:10, the control center initiated emergency procedures for the loss of a train and closed the non-high-speed rail lines that pass through the Vendenheim junction. At approximately the same time, one of the companies involved in the construction of the line received a call from an employee aboard the train, who informed them of the derailment. Shortly before 17:45, the local mass casualty plan was enacted. Emergency medical and fire rescue services along with 100 gendarmes responded to the incident. At its height, 104 engines from three départments responded to the incident—65 from Bas-Rhin and 39 from Moselle and Haut-Rhin. Those with minor injuries were treated by responders from the French Red Cross, which operated at the school in Eckwersheim. The French Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy, Ségolène Royal, and the Secretary of State for Transport, Alain Vidalies, travelled to the site shortly after the crash. The president of SNCF, Guillaume Pepy, and the president of SNCF Réseau, Jacques Rapoport, also travelled to the site in the hours after the accident. The train was carrying 53 persons, including four children, ages 10–15, who were not officially authorized to be aboard. The derailment resulted in 11 deaths, which included four employees of SNCF, five technicians from the engineering firm responsible for the tests, and two guests. Ten died at the crash scene, one died the following evening, and one seriously injured person remained in hospital as of February 2016. Among the dead was the director of the LGV Est line for SNCF Réseau, which owns France's railroad infrastructure. Despite breaking in two pieces and the severe impact with the parapet, there were no deaths among the seven people in the front cab. The second-to-last car impacted the canal wall and was the car with the highest death toll. It was the first fatal derailment in the history of the TGV and the third derailment since the TGV entered commercial service in 1981. Investigation Three investigations have been opened. The French Land Transport Accident Investigation Bureau (BEA-TT, '), which is responsible for investigating rail accidents in France, opened a non-judicial technical investigation. The BEA-TT published its final report in March 2017. A criminal investigation and internal investigation by SNCF have also been opened. Among the subjects which SNCF will investigate is whether there was a dereliction of duties by an SNCF employee that resulted in the unauthorized children riding on the train. The president of SNCF has exclaimed: \\"This is not a practice that SNCF recognizes. A test train is a test train.\\" The derailment occurred the day after the November 2015 Paris attacks, initially sparking fears that the derailment was the work of terrorists. On 19 November, SNCF announced the initial findings of their investigation. The train's event recorder indicated that the train entered the curve at and was travelling at at the moment it derailed, which investigators have determined to be a result of centrifugal forces. The speed at the moment of derailment was above the train's assigned operating speed on the curve. According to the SNCF, the \\"immediate cause\\" of the accident was \\"a late braking sequence\\"; the braking should have begun at least or 12 seconds earlier. The investigation has found no fault for the accident in the infrastructure, train, or member of the technical team. There were seven people in the driving cab at the time of the accident, all of whom survived. Investigators have suggested that this may have been a factor in the late braking. SNCF will begin disciplinary proceedings and take punitive measures against employees responsible for, among other things, the \\"reckless presence\\" of children on the test train, presence of seven people in the cab, the lack of rigor in creating lists of those onboard and controlling access to the train, and \\"without doubt\\" the human errors in the cab. Aftermath Ceremony in remembrance of the victims at Strasbourg station, 16 November SNCF held a minute of silence for the victims during the course of operations on Monday, 16 November. The following day, a memorial service was held in the church in Mundolsheim, which was attended by SNCF President Guillaume Pepy. SNCF suspended all test trials at high speeds until the lessons learned from the investigation can be integrated into testing processes. A memorial garden and stone marker were dedicated at the site on the first anniversary of the accident. The scheduled opening of the second phase of the LGV Est for commercial service was delayed by three months, from 3 April to 3 July 2016. Until 11 December 2016, a short segment of the line around the site of the derailment was limited to a single track while repairs on the damaged track were completed.

His body was taken to a hospital in Serê Kaniyê (Ras al-Ayn) to be brought back to Turkey. Turkish authorities refused to allow his body into the country, sparking controversy. His family had appealed to the Suruç district governorate, which rejected their application due to an invisible order by the Council of Ministers, and the Constitutional Court of Turkey, which also rejected their requests, before turning to the European Court of Human Rights. There were protests against the Turkish authorities and a Change.org petition gathered 23,738 signatures. After 59 days, Güler's body was able to enter Turkey and was buried in Istanbul on 22 November 2015.

She was also instrumental in identifying the caterpillar form of the economically destructive European gypsy moth following its introduction into North America. Education Maria Elizabeth Smith was born on May 24, 1839, to Ebenezer and Betsy (Torsey) Smith of Monmouth, Maine. She attended the Maine Wesleyan Seminary and Female College, graduating in the school's first class. She stayed at the school as an instructor for a time. In 1863, she married entomologist Charles H. Fernald, whom she had tutored in music. They had a son, Henry Torsey Fernald, who also became an entomologist. Fernald became interested in entomology through her husband and began her education in the subject in the 1870s by collecting insects for him around Maine State College in Orono, where he was teaching at the time. Career Fernald developed into a capable and respected entomologist, an expert on the Coccidae, Tortricidae, and Tineidae families of moths and one of only a handful of women in a field that would remain almost exclusively male for another century. In the late 1870s, she began a catalogue of the family Tortricidae, commonly known as tortrix moths or leafroller moths. She later expanded this to include North American insects of all kinds, and one section of this work was published as A Catalogue of the Coccidae of the World in 1903. This \\"gigantic piece of work\\" as one authority called it, enumerated more than 1500 species and served as a vital reference work in a rapidly expanding field of knowledge. It was particularly valuable to investigators researching scale insects, which are highly destructive to agriculture, and it was still in use as a classic text decades after Fernald's death. Around 1886, the Fernalds moved from Maine to Amherst, Massachusetts, where Charles took up a professorship at Massachusetts Agricultural College and was put in charge of the recently founded Massachusetts Agricultural Experiment Station. Three years later, the first of a devastating series of European gypsy moth plagues broke out—the first major outbreak since the insect's arrival in North America two decades earlier. Fernald had taken over the entomological work at the Experiment Station in Charles's absence, and thanks to her knowledge of Lepidoptera, she was able to quickly identify the caterpillars responsible for that first infestation, providing the key to subsequent control efforts. Fernald died on October 6, 1919.

Design work started in 1945 and only the prototype was built. It was the last aircraft the Caproni company designed and built in Milan. Design and development The aircraft is of all-metal construction, with cantilever mid-wings with detachable tips. The leading edges are swept- back, and the stressed-skin wings have flaps inboard of the ailerons. The fuselage is a monocoque structure, with a hinged nose to allow loading of a stretcher or other awkward loads. Seating can be arranged for one pilot and five passengers, or two pilots and three passengers. There is a door on both sides of the cabin, and there is a baggage compartment behind the rear seats. The tailplane has twin fins at the ends of the dihedral stabiliser. The elevators and rudders are fabric-covered. The tricycle landing gear is hydraulically retractable. The two engines are mounted towards the rear of the wing, driving 2-bladed fixed-pitch pusher propellers. Originally planned to use Blackburn Cirrus Major III engines, it was fitted with Walter Minor 6-III engines. Operational history The first flight of the prototype, registered I-POLO in reference to the designers, was flown by Tullio De Prato at Linate Airport, Milan, on 13 May 1949. The aircraft was then briefly tested by the military in Rome, but was returned to the manufacturer and no orders were forthcoming. Several variants were then considered, including the use of turboprop engines, a radar-equipped naval patrol version, and a 'colonial' model, but none was implemented. The aircraft was purchased by the Air Force as MM56701 in March 1950, and in July 1952 it was sold for civilian use, ending up with the Trento Aero Club at Gardolo Airport, where it was withdrawn from use in 1960. It is now on display, after refurbishment in 1991, at the Gianni Caproni Museum of Aeronautics in Trento, Italy.

It has been suggested that he is identical to the Arfast who in December 1022 at the church of St. Croix, Orléans, before king Robert II of France at the trial of several canons accused of neo-Manachaeism, testified that though uninfluenced by their heresy he pretended to share their beliefs so as to gain knowledge that could be used to denounce them. Public sentiment was so inflamed against the heresy that the king was forced to station queen Constance at the church door to prevent the crowd from immediately killing the heretics. On their conviction, the majority were taken out of the church and burned. Arfast then retired as a monk to the abbey of Saint-Père-en-Vallée, Chartres, to which he donated land. Gunnor and her children Richard II of Normandy and Robert, archbishop of Rouen similarly made donations to this abbey. By an unknown wife, Herfast was the father of Osbern, the steward under two of the dukes of Normandy, and of Ranulf, known from ducal charters. Herfast died before 22 August 1026 or 1027.

Meredith Grey (Pompeo) and Jo Wilson (Camilla Luddington) struggle to help a long term patient needing a transplant. Tensions between Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) and Meredith rise, and her professional judgment was clouded because of her feelings for Penelope Blake (Sloyan). Jackson Avery (Williams) and April Kepner (Drew) try to work on their marriage and Maggie Pierce has a tough time dealing with the new cardio attending Nathan Riggs (Martin Henderson). Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) teaches the intern about “doc-knockers” while Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) looks to get back in the dating pool. Amongst all of that, Owen Hunt's (McKidd) past came back to haunt him causing a PTSD relapse. Plot Meredith takes Richard’s advice about working with Penny, but she starts taking it too easy on Penny when a longtime elderly patient comes in for a kidney transplant. A large osteosarcoma is found on his skull, which halts the transplant until Jo realizes that the kidney donor can essentially remove the cancerous tumor by also donating a skull. Bailey and Ben begin to squabble about Jackson still living with them, so Bailey withholds sex until Ben kicks him out. Maggie learns that Bailey hired Dr. Nathan Riggs, a new cardio attending, without consulting her first, which angers her and also Owen, who seems to have a past with him. Callie keeps trying to talk to Meredith about neglecting her responsibility to teach Penny; however, Penny stands up for herself by telling Callie to let her fight her own battles and by telling Meredith to be hard on her and teach her like she should so she can learn.

Since Li Shanlan is also known as Li Renshu, this identity is also referred to as Li Renshu identity. This identity appears in the third chapter of Duoji bilei (Summing finite series), a mathematical text authored by Li Shanlan and published in 1867 as part of his collected works. A Czech mathematician Josef Kaucky published an elementary proof of the identity along with a history of the identity in 1964. Kaucky attributed the identity to a certain Li Jen-Shu. From the account of the history of the identity, it has been ascertained that Li Jen-Shu is in fact Li Shanlan. Western scholars had been studying Chinese mathematics for its historical value; but the attribution of this identity to a nineteenth century Chinese mathematician sparked a rethink on the mathematical value of the writings of Chinese mathematicians. \\"In the West Li is best remembered for a combinatoric formula, known as the 'Li Renshu identity', that he derived using only traditional Chinese mathematical methods.\\" The identity The Li Shanlan identity states that :\\\\sum_{k=0}^p {p \\\\choose k}^2 {{n+2p-k}\\\\choose {2p}} = {{n+p} \\\\choose p}^2. Li Shanlan did not present the identity in this way. He presented it in the traditional Chinese algorithmic and rhetorical way. Proofs of the identity Li Shanlan had not given a proof of the identity in Duoji bilei. The first proof using differential equations and Legendre polynomials, concepts foreign to Shanlan, was published by Pál Turán in 1936, and the proof appeared in Chinese in Yung Chang's paper published in 1939. Since then at least fifteen different proofs have been found. The following is one of the simplest proofs. The proof begins by expressing n \\\\choose q as Vandermonde's convolution: :{n \\\\choose q } = \\\\sum_{k=0}^q {{n-p} \\\\choose k}{p \\\\choose {q-k}} Pre-multiplying both sides by n\\\\choose p , :{n \\\\choose p}{n \\\\choose q} = \\\\sum_{k=0}^q {n \\\\choose p} {{n-p} \\\\choose k}{p \\\\choose {q-k}}. Using the following relation : {n \\\\choose p} {{n-p} \\\\choose k} = {{p+k} \\\\choose k}{n \\\\choose {p+k}} the above relation can be transformed to : {n \\\\choose p}{n \\\\choose q} = \\\\sum_{k=0}^q {p \\\\choose {q-k}} {{p+k} \\\\choose k}{n \\\\choose {p+k}}. Next the relation :{p \\\\choose {q-k}} {{p+k} \\\\choose {k}} = {q \\\\choose k}{{p+k}\\\\choose {q}} is used to get : {n \\\\choose p}{n \\\\choose q} = \\\\sum_{k=0}^q {q \\\\choose k}{n \\\\choose {p+k}}{ {p+k}\\\\choose q}. Another application of Vandermonde's convolution yields :{ {p+k}\\\\choose q} = \\\\sum_{j=0}^q {p \\\\choose j}{k \\\\choose {q-j}} and hence :{n \\\\choose p}{n \\\\choose q} = \\\\sum_{k=0}^q {q \\\\choose k}{n \\\\choose {p+k}} \\\\sum_{j=0}^q {p \\\\choose j}{k \\\\choose {q-j}} Since p \\\\choose j is independent of k, this can be put in the form : {n \\\\choose p}{n \\\\choose q} = \\\\sum_{j=0}^q {p \\\\choose j}\\\\sum_{k=0}^q {q \\\\choose k}{n \\\\choose {p+k}}{k \\\\choose {q-j}} Next, the result : {q \\\\choose k}{k \\\\choose {q-j}} = {q\\\\choose j}{j \\\\choose{q-k}} gives : {n \\\\choose p}{n \\\\choose q} = \\\\sum_{j=0}^q {p \\\\choose j}\\\\sum_{k=0}^q {q \\\\choose j}{j \\\\choose {q-k}}{n \\\\choose {p+k}} :::: = \\\\sum_{j=0}^q {p \\\\choose j}{q \\\\choose j}\\\\sum_{k=0}^q {j \\\\choose {q-k}}{n \\\\choose {p+k}} :::: = \\\\sum_{j=0}^q {p \\\\choose j}{q \\\\choose j}{{n+j}\\\\choose {p+q}} Setting p = q and replacing j by k, :{n \\\\choose p}^2 = \\\\sum_{k=0}^p {p \\\\choose k}^2{{n+k}\\\\choose {2p}} Li's identity follows from this by replacing n by n + p and doing some rearrangement of terms in the resulting expression: :{{n+p} \\\\choose p}^2 = \\\\sum_{k=0}^p {p \\\\choose k}^2{{n+2p-k}\\\\choose {2p}} On Duoji bilei The term duoji denotes a certain traditional Chinese method of computing sums of piles. Most of the mathematics that was developed in China since the sixteenth century is related to the duoji method. Li Shanlan was one of the greatest exponents of this method and Duoji bilei is an exposition of his work related to this method. Duoji bilei consists of four chapters: Chapter 1 deals with triangular piles, Chapter 2 with finite power series, Chapter 3 with triangular self-multiplying piles and Chapter 4 with modified triangular piles.

Part of the banned Al Ummah outfit, they were planning to plant bombs at the famed Tirumala Venkateswara Temple, the most visited temple in India. The suspects also had a plan to murder a famous person in Chennai in the name of the \\"Muslim Defence Force.\\" The operation reportedly ended those conspiracies. Background View of Puttur town from the top of a hill Al Ummah is a terrorist group involved in many terrorist attacks in Tamil Nadu. Started in 1993 after the Babri Masjid demolition, the organization was noticed for the 1993 bombing of RSS office in Chennai, which killed eleven people. The organization is tied to other attacks like the Coimbatore serial bomb blasts which killed 58 persons, while targeting Bharatiya Janata Party leader L. K. Advani during the city's election campaign. It was tied to the bomb blast in Bangalore, the state capital of Karnataka. The terrorists were planning to strike the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple using umbrella bombs amidst the many pilgrims during the annual Brahmostavam festival. The Tamil Nadu police arrested one of the militants named Fakruddin (also called 'Police Fakrudin') on 4 October 2013. Police Fakrudin, Panna Ismail and Bilal Malik were suspects in plotting attacks on Bharathiya Janata Party leader L.K. Advani during October 2011, murder of Hindu Munnani leader Vellaiyan and BJP member V Ramesh in Salem. Fakrudin evaded arrest for 8 years and along with Panna Ismail and Bilal Malik in a group called \\"Muslim Defence Force\\" were planning to kill a public figure in Tamil Nadu in 2013. The Tamil Nadu Police became aware of his movements. He landed in Chennai Central station on 4 October 2013, when two policemen in plain clothes followed, chased and captured him. Operation The Tamil Nadu Police team landed in Puttur, located from Tirupathi and from Chennai on the evening of 4 October 2013. On 5 October 2013, two terror suspects were holed up in a house in Puttur. Bilal Malik and Panna Ismail were in the house; while their accomplice, Fakrudin (also called Police Fakrudin) was captured a day before in Chennai. The three were part of the banned Al Ummah outfit. They were planning to plant bombs in the famed Tirumala Venkateswara Temple, the most visited temple in India. and also had a plan to murder a famous person in Chennai in the name of Muslim Defence Force. They were earlier suspected to be involved in several other cases like the murder plot of L.K. Advani and bombing in Malleswaram in Bangalore where 16 people were injured. The operation was started at 4 in the morning and continued for 10 hours. One of the police constables sustained injuries in the operation and eventually died in hospital; of the four terrorists who were holed up, two namely Malik and Ismailn were captured. Malik's wife and three children were used by the two as human shields and the operation continued for 10 hours. The suspects came out of the house after a prolonged exchange of fire. They were coaxed and finally overcome by the dropping of percussion shells and tear gas from the top of the house. The operation was the first of its kind for Octopus, a newly formed anti-terror unit of the Andhra Police. The searches by the police yielded two bombs and a pistol used by the suspects. A police inspector named Lakshmanan who went incognito as a commoner was attacked by the militants and he sustained injuries. Mutual fire was exchanged for a while. Later in the day, the Octopus team members joined the operation. They cordoned off the area from common people and fired tear gas into the house. The two militants who rushed out were nabbed by the team. Mr. Panna Ismail sustained bullet injuries in the arrest. Two other suspects who were holed up escaped. It was later found out that the lady was the wife of Malik who preferred to stay with her and his children. The lady and the children were detained by Tamil Nadu police, which briefly created a furor. A twelve-member police team from Tamil Nadu visited the place few weeks after the operation along with Malik to hold enquiries about the duo. While most of the civilians were reluctant to reveal information, repeated queries and assurance of the police revealed that the duo were involved in selling vegetables less than the market price and were popular in the area. Crew Operation Puttur was a joint operation of the Tamil Nadu state police and the Andhra Pradesh State police. The operation was the first of its kind for OCTOPUS (Organisation for Counter Terrorist Operations), a newly formed anti-terror unit of the Andhra Police constituted specifically for handling terrorism related issues. K. Srinivas, one of the civilians aged 25, was also in the team aiding the police. He was one of the three to climb up the roof of the house and issued warnings and persuasive statements to the suspects. He aided the police to drop stun grenades and tear gas from the roof into the houses.

Combining elements of folk, sunshine pop, and light psychedelic pop, the group became a well-attended attraction on the Sunset Strip as house band to music venues such as the Whisky a Go Go. They managed to reach the Billboard Hot 100 with a cover version of Allen Toussaint's song \\"Fortune Teller\\" in 1966. Chronology Founding member Bill Richardson (lead guitar) was originally in a quintet known as the Prophets. Disappointed by the group's lack of success, Richardson, along with fellow member Bob Morris (bass guitar), recruited singer-songwriter Rudy Romero (rhythm guitar, vocals), Paul Wheatbread (drums), and Lee Kiefer (tambourine) to form another band. Kiefer was inspired to name the group the Hard Times after the Josh White blues song of the same name. They started developing a strong following in San Diego when manager Florence Stanley took interest to the Hard Times, and persuaded the group to relocate to Los Angeles. Performing at the music club the Sea Witch, the band honed their musicianship and became one of the more frequented attractions on the Sunset Strip. Their popularity earned them the opening slot at the Whisky a Go Go to kickoff concerts for Buffalo Springfield, the Doors, and Jimi Hendrix. Though the Hard Times did take the stage for several other clubs, it was at the Whisky a Go Go that the group was discovered by executives working for Dick Clark's music-based television program Where the Action Is. The band made numerous appearances on the show, resulting in a recording contract with World Pacific Records. The band recorded two non-LP singles that did not receive much national notice, but are regarded as well- produced folk rock pieces, recorded in a similar vein as early Byrds music. The Hard Times charted just once on the Billboard Hot 100—albeit a minor hit as it only peaked at number 97—with a cover version of Allen Toussaint's song \\"Fortune Teller\\". It was the first rendition of the composition to reach the U.S. national charts. In 1967, the band released their sole album, Blew Mind; however it failed to be commercially successful. Music critic Jason Ankeny comments on the album's uneven sound, saying there is \\"a lot to scratch one's head about, as well, like the odd, overly baroque version of 'Candy Man' which opens this collection, a production approach that is also repeated on Hard Times' ill-advised cover of Donovan's 'Colours.' One can't help but wonder what might have happened if Romero-Richardson had been allowed to develop the band further on a second album, but that was not to be\\". Indeed, Blew Mind was perhaps hindered by the condition that session musicians recorded the instrumentals, and, in late 1967, the Hard Times disbanded. Richardson and Larry Byrom (who had replaced Morris on bass) went on to form the psychedelic rock band, T. I. M. E. (Trust in Men Everywhere), recording two albums with the group. Richardson later managed San Diego movie theaters and fronted the Jose Sinatra and Troy Dante Inferno comedic lounge act. Wheatbread joined Gary Puckett and the Union Gap, Keifer became a sound engineer, and Romero released a solo album in 1972. In 2003, Rev-Ola Records reissued Blew Mind, including the band's non-LP singles as bonus tracks along with two tracks by the Richardson and Romero side-project New Phoenix.

It is based on David Grann's article \\"True Crime: A Postmodern Murder Mystery\\", about convicted murderer Krystian Bala, published in 2008 by The New Yorker. The film stars Jim Carrey, Agata Kulesza, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Kati Outinen, Zbigniew Zamachowski, and Marton Csokas, and follows a detective who notices similarities between a cold case murder and a best- selling novel. Producer Brett Ratner had True Crimes in development since 2010. Principal photography began on 12 November 2015 in Kraków, Poland and ended on 13 December 2015. It held its premiere at the Warsaw Film Festival on 12 October 2016, and had a limited theatrical release in only a few countries, such as the United States, in 2018. The Lionsgate Films home entertainment division, Lionsgate Unlocked, released Dark Crimes on Blu-ray and DVD on 31 July 2018. On 21 May 2018, the company revealed a new trailer for the film to promote this home video release. Despite some praise for the cast, critics panned Dark Crimes for its pacing, overly downcast tone, and objectionable presentation of abused women. It is one of the worst-reviewed films of 2018, holding a 0% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.  Synopsis  Tadek is a detective who takes on a case involving the murder of a businessman. To his and everyone's surprise the case is identical to a character's murder in a recently published novel by a man named Kozlov. While the crime appears to be an open and shut case, Tadek discovers a darker secret.

On 7 April 2011, Deadline Hollywood reported that the script was written by Jeremy Brock, and Roman Polanski was \\"circling\\" the project. On 7 June 2013, The Hollywood Reporter revealed Focus Features dropped out in 2012, and Christoph Waltz would play Jacek Wroblewski. On 14 May 2015, TheWrap announced that Waltz was replaced with Jim Carrey for Wroblewski and that Miss Violence (2013) director Alexandros Avranas would direct True Crimes; David Gerson, Ewa Puszczynska, and Michael Aguilar were also revealed to be producers. Page Six announced on 21 October 2015 that Charlotte Gainsbourg was \\"in talks\\" to be in True Crimes.  Production  Principal photography on the film began on 12 November 2015 in Kraków, Poland, wrapping up on 13 December 2015. After filming completed, Carrey kept the beard he grew for his role while presenting the 73rd Golden Globe Awards, while garnered several Twitter reaction posts. Although the filming location and most of the crew of True Crimes was Polish, the film was an international production due to its actors coming from various countries, such as Canada (Carrey), Britain (Gainsbourg), Romania (Ivanov), and Finland (Outinen); and some of its producers being American and Canadian. Due to the Poland setting of the subject of the New Yorker story, producers David Gerson and Kasia Nabiałczyk contacted the biggest figure of the film industry in Poland, Opus Film, to help on True Crimes; the company was most known for Ida (2015), a film that, only months before True Crimes began principal photography, won an Academy Award. According to Culture.pl, this plus the cast and crew of the film coming from various countries indicated a re-interest in Polish cinema worldwide. Polish film journalist Darek Kuźma, writing a feature upon True Crimes' 2016 premiere at Warsaw, reported \\"opportunities in the rapidly developing Polish film industry, with its quality casts and crews, its variety of locations that can stand in for almost every part of the world, and its growing number of regional film commmissions.\\" The Polish Film Institute contributed €446,000 to True Crimes' €4 million budget. Explained Ewa Puszczyńska, who attached the Polish Film Institute as well as the Kraków Film Commission for financing, \\"We’ve made a film with American producers, and international stars, for a fraction of what it would have cost in the US or Western Europe.\\"  Release  The first stills of True Crimes were released on 27 November 2015. The film had its world premiere at the Warsaw Film Festival on 12 October 2016, under the name True Crimes. Saban Films picked up the distribution rights for North America on 4 April 2017. On 25 January 2018, Jim Carrey announced that the film's title had been changed to Dark Crimes and that the North American theatrical release would likely occur in April. Myrkur's song \\"Skøgen Skulle Dø\\" was used in the trailer. The U.S. theatrical release was later announced as 18 May 2018, with an earlier DirecTV exclusive release on 19 April. Internationally, Dark Crimes only ran for one week in Colombia, Italy, and Hungary; and only for a week longer in Portugal. Dark Crimes was released to Blu-ray in Canada on 17 July 2018, the United States on 31 July 2018, Sweden on 30 January 2019, Italy on 7 February 2019, France on 2 May 2019, and Germany on 14 June 2019. Dark Crimes also garnered DVD releases in the United States, issued on 31 July 2018; and Taiwan, on 28 June 2019. Wal-mart exclusively sold versions of the Blu-ray that were also packed with a DVD.  Critical response  Before the release of True Crimes, sources such as The Playlist and The Independent were excited for the project due to the involvements of Avranas, Gainsbourg, and Kulesza; but were a bit skeptical due to Carrey's previous involvement in a dark thriller, The Number 23 (2007), being terrible. Marshall Lemon, responding to the November 2015 still revelations, wrote Carrey \\"absolutely looks the part,\\" and \\"the visual style is also reminiscent of shows like True Detective which transformed actors like Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey into surprising dramatic presences. If True Crimes can do the same for Carrey, it might just be worth keeping an eye on.\\" On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rare approval rating of 0%meaning no favorable reviews whatsoeverbased on reviews from 35 critics, with an average rating of 2.56/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Dark Crimes is a rote, unpleasant thriller that fails to parlay its compelling true story and a committed Jim Carrey performance into even modest chills.\\" On Metacritic the film has score of 24 out of 100 based on 14 critics, and their editorial stated \\"this Polish-set but English-language entry stars a bearded, accented, against-type (and, apparently, against-ability) Jim Carrey in a bleak, violent crime thriller described by critics as 'misogynistic,' 'depressing,' 'ugly,' and 'abysmal.'\\" It is the eighth lowest-ranking 2018 film on the site. Reviews targeted the film's overly gloomy and unexciting tone, which ruined a potentially enjoyable plot; and the pacing's slow and excessively-tense build, which Owen Gleiberman of Variety found especially a problem with details of the mystery being \\"all far too obvious.\\" The New York Times called the last act its best part simply for having far more action than the previous sequences. The A.V. Club summarized that the film replaced the \\"source material’s appealing elements and characterizations with overcomplicated thriller clichés and humorless prurience,\\" and IGN critic Witney Seibold criticized its predictable plot, as \\"it can be seen in just about every episode of Law & Order: Criminal Intent.\\" The film's exploitative scenes involving physical and sexual abuse towards women also turned several critics off, one critic from Slant Magazine describing them as \\"blatantly misogynistic.\\" The film's technical aspects were divisively received. The A.V. Club summarized the directing as \\"leaden and one-note in its attempt to imitate the bleakness of Swedish and Norwegian crime imports in an indifferent Eastern European setting; the sky is always overcast and the characters are all dressed like they’re on their way to a funeral.\\" The New York Observer panned the \\"ugly, sterile sets\\" and poor photography; SF Weekly called the shot compositions gimmicky; while Oktay Kozak Ege opined the \\"aesthetically repetitive\\" visuals made tension sequences more unbearable to watch. However, Consequence of Sound writer Randall Colburn stated \\"Avranas' muted, sterile style pops with a few flourishes, mainly in his knack for cultivating a truly unsettling aura around the starkness of the film’s depravity.\\" He also praised the use of POV shots for \\"creating a curious sense of alienation, as if one is both inside the film but outside of its truth, looking in at the larger reality.\\" Luke W. Thompson of Forbes applauded the editing and directing for matching the mood of the story, and David Lewis of the San Francisco Chronicle honored its \\"impressive\\" production design. Opinions towards Carrey's performance ranged from positive and the film's only redeeming factor to his worst-ever dramatic performance. In addition to several criticisms towards his fake Polish accent, Gleiberman wrote that \\"Carrey broods and stares like an actor who’s out to muffle any hint of his natural spirit by swathing it in poker-faced gloom,\\" and the New York Post summarized Carrey as \\"so muted and sedate [...] he blends into the background. That’s not easy to do when most of his scenes involve no more than two people.\\" The character of Tadek was also criticized as \\"underwritten\\" to the point of being \\"an ordinary person doing his ordinary job [...] even if the circumstances are extraordinary.\\" Colburn explained, \\"Tadek is a character written to be devoid of charm or humor and, as such, Carrey has no opportunities to draw upon the anxious, springy energy of Man on the Moon or the desperate, aching despair of Eternal Sunshine.\\" IGN wrote the character was too \\"empty\\" for someone supposedly obsessed with the case he was solving. The supporting actors, such as Csokas, Outinen, Ivanov, and Gainsbourg were positively commented on; some critics found Csokas to be the film's best actor, Thompson explaining that he \\"strikes the right balance of legitimate rage and pretentious self-importance that you could imagine youngsters embracing.\\" However, Colburn felt that Csokas' \\"icky vein of cruelty\\", Gainsbourg's \\"compelling bloodletting\\", and Wieckiewicz's \\"pulp paperback\\" style contradicted the tone of Carrey's performance, resulting in \\"imbalance that serves to sink the film.\\"  See also  * List of films considered the worst  References  External links  2016 films American films Polish films Films set in Kraków Films set in Poland Films shot in Kraków American crime drama films American crime thriller films Polish crime drama films 2016 crime drama films 2016 crime thriller films Crime films based on actual events Thriller films based on actual events American police detective films Polish crime thriller films ","title":"Dark Crimes"},{"id":"48551570","text":"The 1960–61 Connecticut Huskies men's basketball team represented the University of Connecticut in the 1960–61 collegiate men's basketball season.

Al-Monitor, 19 November 2014 As of January 2005, the number of Palestinian Authority security forces was, according to Associated Press, about 30,000. The division was as follows:Palestinian security forces. Associated Press, 19 January 2005 *Palestinian National Security Forces (Palestinian border police, military intelligence, military police and the elite Force 17 presidential security unit): about 15,000 members *General Intelligence (collecting information and security for Palestinian diplomatic missions abroad): about 5,000 members in Gaza *Palestinian Civil Police Force (Gaza's police force and preventive security agency meant to fight internal crime, at the time under responsibility of the Interior Minister): about 10,000 members Tasks The 2003 Amended Basic Law (Article 84) states: \\"The Security Forces and the Police are regular forces. They are the armed forces in the country. Their functions are limited to defending the country, serving the people, protecting society and maintaining public order, security and public morals.\\"2003 Amended Basic Law, 18 March 2003. Article 39: The President of the National Authority is the Commander-in-Chief of the Palestinian Forces. The National Security Forces and the Presidential Guard are the PA's paramilitary forces, to some extent resembling an army. Before the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip, the PA maintained a small Coast Guard, using 5 motorboats equipped with machine guns along the Gazan seacoast. Before Israel destroyed the Gazan airport, there was also a small Aerial Police. Police tasks are performed by the Civil Police Force, known as the Blue Police for its uniform color. Additionally, there are some other small civil forces. The Preventive Security Force is a large unit of the PA's intelligence. The intelligence division is divided into General Intelligence, Military Intelligence (Istikhbarat) and Military Police Intelligence. Crack down on Palestinians A February 2016 report of the Geneva-based Euro- Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor (Euro-Med Monitor), documented 1,274 arbitrary detentions in the West Bank in 2015 and 1,089 summonses by PA's Palestinian Security Services. The human rights violations targeted mostly individuals affiliated with Hamas or who opposed PA policies, including about 35 journalists and human rights activists, 476 university students, and 67 teachers/professors. Twenty-seven percent of the arrests lasted for a month or more. As the most serious violations were mentioned the refusal to implement court rulings ordering the release or acquittal of detainees. Medical reports confirmed the systematic practice of torture in Palestinian Authority jails in the West Bank. The number of human rights violations committed by PA authorities in the West Bank was significantly greater than the similar violations for which Hamas was responsible in Gaza. In both, West Bank and Gaza people were arrested or summoned for posting or liking messages on social media, primarily on Facebook, critical of respectively the PA or Hamas.New report documents abusive detentions by both PA and Hamas to stifle freedom of expression. Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor, 21 February 2016 In March 2016, the London-based Arab Organisation for Human Rights in the UK (AOHR-UK) reported that in 2015, PA security forces in the West Bank arbitrarily arrested or summoned 1,715 civilians. They included students, journalists, women and children. Nearly 1,000 detainees were Palestinians who were previously released from Israeli jails. The report stated that 37 detainees were tortured, some held in solitary confinement for several months. Eleven Palestinians were even held in administrative detention (without charge). The bulk of the arrests and summons, while violating Human Rights, were carried out by the Preventive Security Force and the General Intelligence. Sometimes, the forces used live bullets to intimidate Palestinians. The forces often did not comply with court orders for the release of detainees. Security forces were also accused of seizing personal belongings and property of arrested persons. Four Palestinians were taken hostage to force members of their families to hand themselves in.37 Palestinians tortured at hands of PA security staff.

Third Intifada  Since the new uprising that begun in October 2015 the Palestinian police seemed to show less willingness to suppress protests against the occupation. In December 2015, the Palestinian police even for the first time evicted Israeli Border Police who had raided Beitunia, a suburb of Ramallah in Area A, which formally is under exclusive security control by the Palestinians. Nevertheless, commander of the Palestinian Intelligence in the West Bank revealed in January 2016, that the Security Forces since October 2015 had prevented some 200 \\"terrorist attacks\\" against Israel and arrested about 100 Palestinians on suspicion of planning attacks against Israelis. Palestinian Authority hard-liners blast security cooperation with Israel. Abu Toameh, Khaled, Jerusalem post, 21 January 2016 It triggered a wave of denunciations from Palestinian factions that are strongly opposed to security coordination with Israel. A spokesman of Hamas said that the PA security forces played a role in serving the security of the occupation and combating the Palestinian intifada, and that “Protecting the security of the occupation has become part of the ideology of the Palestinian security forces”.

The mosque received the status of provincial mosque of West Java Province in 2004. It is located on the east side of the alun-alun of Bandung. History The mosque after receiving its first front gallery and fish-scale patterned fence. The Grand Mosque of Bandung, previously the Great Mosque of Bandung, was first constructed in 1812. The first building was a humble wooden structure on a raised platform and covered in bamboo weave wall and multi-tiered thatched roof. A large pool in the mosque complex provided water for the ablution ritual before performing prayer. In 1826, the mosque was gradually renovated, the roof was refurbished and the bamboo weave wall was replaced with sturdier wood. In 1850, with the construction of the Grote Postweg (now Jalan Asia Afrika), the mosque was renovated and expanded; the roof was replaced with clay tiles, and the wall was replaced with solid bricks. The pyramidal multi- tiered roof gave the mosque a nickname bale nyungcung (Sundanese \\"spiky pavilion\\"). In 1875, the mosque base was replaced with solid stone, and the perimeter of the mosque complex was enclosed with a new brick wall with fish- scale pattern; a traditional pattern associated with Bandung which was also found in the walls surrounding the Pendopo complex of Bandung. In 1900, the main prayer hall received an expansion in form of covered porch (pawestren) to the south and north of the main prayer hall. In 1930, the covered front porch (serambi) of the Great Mosque was refurbished following the design of Henri Maclaine Pont. Two-tiered roofs, mimicking the main prayer's hall three-tiered roof, were added to the left and right of the mosque's facade. In 1955, the year of the Asia-Africa Conference, the mosque received its first major renovation. In order to accommodate the guests of the Asia-Africa Conference, the mosque was greatly expanded, reducing its original courtyard into a narrow space. As a result, the original 19th-century multi-tiered roofs, the pawestren, and the two-tiered serambi were demolished. The traditional Javanese multi-tiered roof was replaced with an onion-shaped mosque designed by President Sukarno himself. In 1967, strong gale damaged this new dome. In 1970, the mosque received a new hip roof. In 1971, the Governor of West Java decided to expand the mosque yet again. Construction began in 1972 and was completed on October 1, 1973. At this stage, the mosque received its first second floor and a basement for performing ritual ablution. The roof style is transformed into a joglo-style roof. The mosque also received a new cylindrical modern-style minaret and a bridge which connects the mosque with alun-alun. The overall look disturbs the facade of the mosque. During the 1980s, high solid wall and a steel entrance were added to the front of the mosque. Current mosque One of the minaret of the Grand Mosque of Bandung featuring the historic roof architecture of the original mosque. Last major renovation occurred in 2001. Construction started on February 25, 2001 and was completed on June 4, 2003. The project was part of the rehabilitation of Bandung's alun-alun project, the overall project was completed on January 13, 2004. At this time, the mosque name was changed from Masjid Agung Bandung (\\"Bandung Great Mosque\\") to Masjid Raya Bandung (\\"Bandung Grand Mosque\\"), elevating its status into a provincial mosque. The new mosque design is the result of a collaboration between four native Bandung designers: Keulman, Arie Atmadibrata, Nu'man, and Slamet Wirasonjaya. The main circular dome (where the original roof stood) is 30 meter in diameter; two smaller domes flank the front facade of the mosque. A new west wing of the mosque is built on an area where the Alun-alun Barat Street used to be, merging the mosque with the alun- alun. The decision of removing the Alun-alun Barat Street results in an awkward urban design: the alun-alun design, normally surrounded by four streets, is now merged with the mosque; traffic diversion has to be adjusted with Banceuy Street and Dewi Sartika Street now disconnected; and Swarha Building, an Art Deco building whom facade was designed to be located on the corner of the road Alun-alun Barat Street and Asia-Afrika Street, is now awkwardly situated on one street. The most distinctive feature of the mosque is its two twin minarets, each 81 meters high. The minarets were planned to be 99 meters high to represent the 99 names of Allah but was changed to 81 meters because of height restriction related with the position of Husein Sastranegara International Airport. The minarets flank the main building to the left and right. Both minarets are topped with a small roofed pavilion that mimics the original roof of the Great Mosque of Bandung. The top of the minarets are open to public every Saturday and Monday.

As Research Director at INSERM and Professor at the Pasteur Institute, she heads the Laboratory of Nuclear Organization and Oncogenesis at the Pasteur Institute and the INSERM Unit 993 'Molecular and Cellular Biology of Tumors'.  Biography  Anne Dejean- Assémat was educated at the Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris, graduating with a Master of Science degree in Genetics in 1981. She then earned her PhD in Virology at the Pasteur Institute in 1988. Her thesis topic was the role of integrated hepatitis B virus sequences in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Since 2003, she has been leading the Nuclear Organization and Oncogenesis Unit at the Pasteur Institute. Anne Dejean- Assémat has held several scientific administration positions at the Scientific Council and as a president of the Genetics, Development and Cancer committee at INSERM (2008–2012) and in a study section at the French Ministry of Research and Technology. In 2004, she became a member of the French Academy of Sciences. She received the Prize L’Oréal-Unesco for Women in Science in 2010, the Grand Prix INSERM, 2014 and the Sjöberg Prize, 2018.  Scientific contributions  A molecular biologist, Anne Dejean-Assémat investigates the mechanisms, at the genetic, epigenetic and cellular levels, responsible for the development of human cancers. Anne Dejean-Assémat and her collaborators have made important advances in understanding the origin of certain cancers and have opened up unique perspectives for new differentiation and targeted therapy leads. She discovered mutations in the genes encoding the receptors for retinoic acid, the active derivative of vitamin A, in liver cancer and some types of leukemia and dissected the molecular mechanisms underlying their role in oncogenesis and treatment sensitivity. Her main contributions are the first demonstration of a direct role for the hepatitis B virus in human liver cancer as an insertional mutagen, the discovery of a gene encoding a retinoic acid receptor at a hepatitis B virus integration site and the molecular cloning of the PML-RAR oncoprotein responsible for acute promyelocytic leukemia. Focusing on the cellular defects characterizing this type of leukemia, she then discovered the implication of a novel cellular organelle, the PML Nuclear Body, and clarified the mechanisms underlying the high efficiency of acute promyelocytic leukemia treatment by retinoic acid and arsenic which leeds to cure in more than 95% of the patients. Together, her studies led to the identification of the genetic and cellular mechanisms responsible for a human leukemia and to the understanding of the unique efficacy of this anti-tumor therapy targeted on the genetic defect. Her most recent work aims at eludicating the role of the post-translational modification by the SUMO protein in the epigenetic control of gene expression. Manipulation of experimental data supporting research articles published by Anne Dejean-Assémat has been reported in several cases.

It debuted in March 2013, where the company introduced a new streamlined plan structure for new customers which drops contracts, subsidized phones, coverage fees for data, and early termination fees. Generally, the advertised promotions are permanent, though some become redundant with later uncarrier innovations (for instance, the unlimited music in uncarrier 6 was moot after the move to all unlimited data plans). Occasionally, the promotion is dropped all together. Such as with T-Mobile's \\"Mobile Without Borders\\" feature in UnCarrier 3.0. The feature provided unlimited service to customers visiting in Mexico and Canada. When T-Mobile couldn't continue to support the feature, customers were given 32 days notice that the service promotion ended, and the feature would be removed from all existing accounts. A replacement feature was available, but also required an increase in price by first changing rateplans and adding features for additional fees. T-Mobile announced the change to its customers through a press release. Simple Choice - No Service Contracts (Un-carrier 1.0) The contract-free Simple Choice plan, also known as Un-carrier 1.0, debuted in March 2013 by offering unlimited calling and text messaging with 500 MB of unthrottled data monthly for a base price of $50. Options for 2.5 GB or unlimited data were offered for an extra monthly fee. On its first anniversary in March 2014, these amounts were changed to the following: 1 GB, 3 GB, 5 GB or unlimited with the same base prices. In July 2014, T-Mobile offered a limited time promotion on 4 and 5 line family plans, changing their 1 GB per line unthrottled data to 2.5 GB at no extra cost. Existing customers had to call T-Mobile by the end of September 2014 to benefit from this offer. The data allotment was supposed to automatically revert to 1 GB after January 2 2016, but never did. In November 2015, the amounts on 1 GB, 3 GB and 5 GB plans (excluding the 2.5 GB limited time promotion) were doubled to 2 GB, 6 GB and 10 GB respectively for all new and existing customers at no extra cost. Under the Simple Choice plans, customers pay a portion of their device's price up-front, and pay off the remainder through monthly payments for two years. The cost of that monthly payment depends on the device. The customer fully owns the phone and no longer makes any future payments once they have completed paying off their phone. A second line costs $30 extra, while any additional line beyond this costs $10 extra (before extra data). It is possible to create a family plan by adding lines at a reduced cost. Upgrades for All (Un-carrier 2.0) On July 10, 2013, T-Mobile introduced Un-carrier 2.0 as Jump, a new add-on for its monthly plans which allows customers to upgrade their phone up to two times per year, by trading in their phone to purchase a new one at the same price as a new customer. T-Mobile users with Jump! as of Feb 14th are no longer required to wait 6 months for the first upgrade. AT&T; and Verizon require that customers wait 2 years before they can upgrade their phone. Amped 2.0 On June 27, 2015, T-Mobile announced Un-carrier Amped 2.0. This is a new JUMP! On Demand program, which permits three upgrades per year instead of the two offered by the original JUMP!. Also, the carrier dropped the $10/month fee for the original JUMP! plan. Simple Global (Un-carrier 3.0) On October 9, 2013, T-Mobile introduced their third phase of the \\"Un-carrier\\", which was the introduction of basically free international roaming. See section Roaming for more information. On October 23, 2013, T-Mobile announced a Un-carried 3.5 promo offer, which gave customers 200MB of free data for their tablets. They also announced $0 down for most tablets, including the newly to them arrived iPads. On July 9, 2015, T-Mobile launched Mobile Without Borders to offer high speed data roaming while in Canada and Mexico at no additional cost, in addition to providing unlimited talk and text roaming in these countries via Simple Global. The domestic high speed allowance is used while roaming, after which slower speeds or deprioritization may apply. Furthermore, calls and texts to Canada and Mexico from the U.S. carry no extra fee. Carrier Freedom (Un-carrier 4.0) On January 8, 2014, T-Mobile revealed Un-carrier 4.0. Known as Get Out of Jail Free Card, T-Mobile offered to pay off the Early Termination Fees (ETF), up to $375 per line, for individuals and families who wanted to switch from AT&T;, Verizon, or Sprint to T-Mobile. According to T-Mobile, \\"With an eligible phone trade-in, the total value of the offer to switch to T-Mobile could be as high as $650 per line.\\" On April 9, 2014, T-Mobile released their first of three parts to their \\"Un-carrier 4.5\\" initiative. This was a new, low-cost called \\"Simple Starter\\". Like \\"Simple Choice\\", it includes unlimited talk and text. The main difference is that \\"Simple Starter\\" only included 500 MB of data, after which Internet access was disabled until the next billing cycle or until more access was purchased. Other \\"Simple Choice\\" features, such as Simple Global and Music Unleashed, are unavailable on \\"Simple Starter\\". This plan was later replaced by a slightly pricier variant, featuring 2 GB of Internet access instead of 500 MB. \\"Simple Starter\\" has since been discontinued for new customers. On April 10, 2014, T-Mobile released their second part of the \\"Un-carrier 4.5\\" initiative, specifically for tablets. This included a promotion that, for a limited time, sold tablets with built-in 4G LTE modems at the same price as a tablet without said modem. The initiative also included the ETF payoff program extending to tablet customers. The final part was a promotional price for mobile Internet. On April 14, 2014, T-Mobile announced their final part to their \\"Un-carrier 4.5\\" initiative. T-Mobile abolished overages for all T-Mobile customers on all plans, current and grandfathered. CEO John Legere also started a petition to other carriers to do the same. Test Drive (Un-carrier 5.0) On June 18, 2014, T-Mobile announced \\"Test Drive\\", which allows new customers to test out T-Mobile's network on a loaner iPhone 5S for a week at no charge. This offer is limited to once per household per year. Apple is providing T-Mobile with free iPhones for this promotion. The promotion was later replaced by \\"Lifetime Coverage Guarantee\\" in September 2015. Music Freedom (Un-carrier 6.0) On June 18, 2014, T-Mobile also announced Un-carrier 6.0, known as Music Freedom. Data used on certain streaming music services would no longer count to users' data limits. At the time of the announcement, these services included: Pandora, Spotify, Rhapsody, Google Play Music, iTunes Radio, Slacker, Milk Music, Beatport, and iHeartRadio. In addition, users are also able to vote for more music services to be selected for inclusion into this program. T-Mobile has partnered with Rhapsody to offer \\"UnRadio\\", a streaming radio service with unlimited skips, no ads, and offline playback. The service will be free to unlimited T-Mobile customers, and will be available to all others for a nominal fee, which varies between T-Mobile and non-T-Mobile customers. On November 24, 2014 this was expanded to add an additional 14 music services. Wi-Fi Unleashed (Un-carrier 7.0) On September 10, 2014, T-Mobile debuted Un-carrier 7.0 as Wi-Fi Unleashed. The company announced an agreement with Gogo Inflight Internet to provide free text messages and visual voicemail to T-Mobile customers on Gogo-equipped U.S. flights. Second, all customers were made eligible to upgrade to a device that supports Wi-Fi Calling. Third, the T-Mobile Personal CellSpot home router allows users to make calls from their home using their broadband connection. Data Stash (Un-carrier 8.0) On December 16, 2014, T-Mobile announced Un-carrier 8.0 as \\"Data Stash\\". This lets users carry over unused high-speed data usage for up to one year. The feature applies to customers of eligible post-paid plans who purchase qualifying amounts of additional high-speed data. On March 16, 2015, T-Mobile announced that Data Stash would be extended to Simple Choice prepaid customers. Un-Carrier for Business (Un-carrier 9.0) On March 18, 2015, T-Mobile announced their Uncarrier 9.0 initiative. Called Un-carrier for Business, it brings a simple pricing structure to business customers where \\"every line comes with unlimited talk and text, as well as 1GB of data and depending on how many lines you get, the price you pay per line changes. But not by much.\\" Families of business customers can also get up to 50% discount on their phone lines. \\"Un-carrier for Business\\" also offers bespoke business tools to help customers mobilize their business. The tools include a free .com domain name, a free mobile optimized website, and email address. On March 18, 2015, T-Mobile announced their new business initiatives, including simplified pricing, a special 24/7 business support team, and extending existing un- carrier benefits (global roaming, WiFi calling and texting for compatible devices, free in-flight texting, etc.) to business lines. Families of employees can also receive discounts through this program. T-Mobile also emphasized a dramatic coverage expansion initiative for 2015, planning to reach an additional 1 million square miles of native coverage in the lower 48 states, and expanded their \\"Contract Freedom\\" (now called \\"Carrier Freedom\\") promotion to cover device and lease payoffs. T-Mobile additionally announced that its customers' prices they pay are good forever, as long as they keep service on their lines, including if they utilize promotional pricing. Binge On (Un-carrier 10.0) On November 10, 2015, T-Mobile introduced Un-carrier X, with Binge On, where watching videos on certain streaming services doesn't count against a user's 4G LTE data if the user has at least 3 GB of 4G LTE data. For all Simple Choice plans, most videos are automatically streamed in DVD (480p or higher) quality, allowing customers to watch as much as three times more video than before. Also, all 4G LTE data amounts were doubled. T-Mobile Tuesdays (Un-carrier 11.0) On June 6, 2016, T-Mobile announced T-Mobile Tuesdays. This program has exclusive promotions offered to T-Mobile customers with a variety of rewards, ranging from free pizzas from Domino's Pizza, Vudu movies, Lyft credit, free Frostys from Wendy's, StubHub ticket discounts, free subs from Subway, and Fandango movie tickets. The signature for this promotion is \\"Get Thanked\\", in which the carrier offered a subtle way to say thank you to their customers every Tuesday. Additionally, this promotion carried another incentive called \\"Stock Up\\". T-Mobile offered one share of T-Mobile stock for every new customer an existing customer refers to T-Mobile, up to 100 shares. Customers who had been with the company for five years or more were offered two stocks for every new customer they referred to T-Mobile. Beginning on June 13, T-Mobile also offered one free hour of in- flight Wi-Fi through Gogo Inflight Internet for consumers who fly through sponsored airlines. Adding to a previous Un-Carrier launch, data-dependent texting such as iMessage, Viber, Google Hangouts, and WhatsApp was able to be used for free on flights with Gogo Inflight Internet. T-Mobile Tuesdays saw a much higher than anticipated volume within the first few weeks of its debut. Domino's saw nearly quadruple their normal volume of sales on Tuesday. There were so many pizzas ordered from Domino's Pizza that Domino's had to back out of the promotional offers featured in T-Mobile Tuesdays. As of September 1, customers from T-Mobile have redeemed over 14 million free gifts and allowed promotional partners to find success. Mobile travel application Hotel Tonight topped the trending chart on Google Play and technology operating company Bookshout topped the Books category in the iOS App Store during their respective promotional periods. T-Mobile ONE (Un-carrier 12.0) On August 18, 2016, T-Mobile announced T-Mobile ONE. T-Mobile ONE was a step towards ending data plans, making all talk, text and all data usage unlimited (video data unlimited at 480p definition, with an extra fee for unlimited HD). As with T-Mobile Simple Choice, subscribers using the most data, the highest 3% – currently people using more than 50 GB of high-speed data per month – may see their data traffic prioritized behind other users once they cross that threshold during their billing month.  Un-carrier Next  On January 6, 2017, T-Mobile presented its latest un-carrier 'un-carrier next' at CES in Las Vegas, Nevada. CEO John Legere and COO Mike Sievert announced several 'new rules'. The first was to completely eliminate wireless service and access fees in an effort to make the pricing more transparent. The prices for all T-Mobile service plans will now be exactly as advertised without any additional or hidden fees. The second rule introduced was the 'kickback' program. Individuals and families on the T-Mobile One plan who use less than 2GB of data a month will receive a $10 statement credit. The third rule introduced gives customers the guarantee that no aspects of their particular plan will change unless they amend them. In effect, T-Mobile 'signed' a contract stipulating they will not alter any of the service plans. Finally the fourth item introduced was to simplify their offerings.

Björklund then started playing pedal steel guitar as a studio musician and has released two solo recordings.  Early life  Maggie Björklund was born in Denmark and grew up near Copenhagen. She took piano lessons, but switched to guitar as soon as she could. She moved to Hollywood and attended the Musicians Institute, where she was introduced to country music. She returned to Denmark after a year.  Career  Back in Denmark, she formed the all-female country band Darleens, and they recorded three albums for Sony Records. After Darleens split up, she took pedal steel guitar lessons from Jeff Newman in Nashville, Tennessee. Her 2011 debut Coming Home was produced by Johnny Sangster (The Tripwires). The record featured members of Calexico, and guest vocalists Mark Lanegan (Screaming Trees), Jon Auer (The Posies), and Rachel Flotard (Visqueen). After the album's release, she played pedal steel with Jack White's all-female backing band, the Peacocks. In 2011 and 2012 she performed at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas. She also toured with John Doe and with Exene Cervenka from the band X. For her sophomore album Shaken, released in 2014, she enlisted John Convertino (Calexico), Barb Hunter (Afghan Whigs), and Jim Barr (Portishead).

The ICZ evolved from AAZK’s now-extinct International Outreach Committee (IOC). A major accomplishment of the IOC was procuring a travel grant which afforded the opportunity for representatives from seven of the world’s professional zookeeper associations to meet at the AAZK conference in Columbus, Ohio, in 2000. These seven representatives met to discuss the need for better communication among zookeepers worldwide. The idea to create the International Congress of Zookeepers (ICZ) was formulated. Representatives at the 2000 meeting of the World’s Professional Zookeeper Associations were: * American Association of Zoo Keepers (AAZK) * Association of British Wild Animal Keepers (ABWAK) * Australasian Society of Zoo Keeping (ASZK) * Asociación Ibérica de Cuidadores de Animales Salvajes (AICAS) * Association Francophone des Soigneurs Animaliers (ASFA) * Berufsverband der Zootierpfleger (BdZ) * Stichting De Harpij (De Harpij) A steering committee (SC) was formed to direct the progress of the ICZ and create a vision for the budding association. The SC consists of two volunteer members from each of the professional keeper associations. As of 2014, the SC of the ICZ consists of 18 members representing the world's nine professional keeper associations. They have met once a year since 2000 to coordinate the development of an international association that will promote professional animal care throughout the world. Currently, the ICZ is operated completely by volunteer committee members. The ICZ has five priorities; keeper development (workshops and aiding keepers in developing countries receive access to resources and information), the hosting of international conferences or congress every three years, assisting with the development of new national keeper associations, development of the global network of zookeepers, and conservation. 2015 world’s professional keeper associations that make up the ICZ: * American Association of Zoo Keepers (AAZK) * Association of British & Irish Wild Animal Keepers (ABWAK) * Australasian Society of Zoo Keeping (ASZK) * Asociación Ibérica de Cuidadores de Animales Salvajes (AICAS) (Spain & Portugal) * Association Francophone des Soigneurs Animaliers (AFSA) (France) * Berufsverband der Zootierpfleger (BdZ) (Germany) * Stichting De Harpij (Netherlands and Belgium) * Zookeepers’ Association of the Philippines (ZAP) (Established 2006) Strategic directions of the ICZ * Achieve the highest standards of zoo keeping globally. * To assist zoos in need of improvement. * Securing the financial growth and stability needed to implement the ICZ’s strategy. * Increasing ICZ's visibility and impact. * Improving and developing the ICZ, reflecting the needs of zookeepers, zookeeper associations and zoos needing improvement. * Developing and delivering ICZ’s core conservation activities. * Developing and strengthening ICZ’s external partnerships. * Procure and develop a professional administrative management. International Congress on Zoo Keeping (conference) The first major goal for the ICZ was to organize an international keeper conference or congress. In 2003, the first congress of the ICZ was held at Avifauna in the Netherlands. In 2006, the Congress was held at the Gold Coast, Australia. In 2009, the Congress was held in conjunction with the 36th AAZK National Conference at Woodland Park Zoo, Seattle, Washington, United States. In 2012, the Congress was held at the Wildlife Reserves Singapore. A total of over 1,100 zookeepers from all over the world have attended the four previous ICZ conferences. The upcoming 5th International Congress on Zoo Keeping will be held at Leipzig, Germany, September 9-13th, 2015. We are anticipating at least 300 zookeepers and other delegates from all around the world attending this Congress. Associations interested in hosting a Congress after 2015 should contact the ICZ SC. The ICZ does have scholarship available to aid keepers in developing countries to attend the Congress. Just an example; for the 2012 Congress in Singapore, the ICZ gave five full scholarships and three partial scholarships, which allowed participants from the Philippines, India, Uganda, France, Mexico, Taiwan, and Singapore to attend the 4th ICZ Congress. Since the ICZ’s first Congress is 2003, approximately 15 scholarships have been awarded to delegates from all over the world. It was with heavy heart in September 2012, when the ICZ lost one of its own SC members, Mr. Paul Howse. Paul had worked tirelessly for the ICZ since its inception and to honor his life, love, and enthusiasm, the ICZ SC created the Paul Howse Scholarship, which will be awarded to a commendable delegate for the first time at the 2015 ICZ Congress at Leipzig. In 2018 the ICZ Congress will be in Argentina. Current members American Association of Zookeepers (AAZK) The American Association of Zoo Keepers, Inc. began in 1967 in San Diego, CA with the purpose of promoting professionalism in zoo keeping through education of zoological staff members in the most modern and current techniques of captive exotic animal care. AAZK's mission is to provide a resource and a forum of continuing education for the animal care professional and to support zoo and aquarium personnel in their roles as animal care givers, scientific researchers, public educators and conservationists; to promote zoos and aquariums as cultural establishments dedicated to the enrichment of human and natural resources; to foster the exchange of research materials, enrichment options and husbandry information through publications and conferences which will lead to a greater understanding of the needs and requirements of all animals. Asociación Ibérica de Cuidadores de Animales Salvajes (AICAS) Founded in 2000, the Iberian Association of Zookeepers (AICAS) is constituted by Spanish and Portuguese Associates with the main goals of promoting the education, the professionalization and the exchange and dissemination of information in relation to the care and management of wild animals in captivity. It is also meant to encourage the preservation of biodiversity through the involvement of the workforce of zoos, aquariums, centers for rehabilitation and reintroduction of wildlife, nature reserves, parks and every other person working in the care and management of exotic wildlife or with a direct or indirect link with wildlife. Association Francophone de Soigneurs Animaliers (AFSA) The Francophone Association of Zoo Keepers was created in order to develop methods of care and handling of wild animals in captivity. This association is a link between professionals working in the fields of training, public presentations, research, care, conservation and education. In 1999, three keepers from Doué-la-Fontaine Zoo, Pont-Scorff Zoo, and Branfere's Park begin to talk about the possibility of creating a Professional Association of keepers like in other countries. The need to create AFSA was due to the fact that in France there is no exchange between keepers regarding zoo keeping and the occupation of zookeeper wasn't professionally recognized. AFSA is an association of keepers only directed by keepers; it is addressed to all French keepers as well as staffs of zoos, aquariums, aviaries, etc. The first meeting took place in November 1999 with the assistance of representatives from other Professional Associations. Association of British Wild Animal Keepers (ABWAK) The Association of British Wild Animal Keepers is a non-profit organization which has set its following goals and objectives: To improve cooperation among animal keepers, both nationally and internationally. To provide, encourage and organize facilities for the meeting of keepers of wild animals. To improve, through education, the professional competence of all involved with wild animal husbandry and to support the conservation of wildlife throughout the world. Australasian Society of Zookeeping (ASZK) Formed in 1976, the Australasian Society of Zookeeping is primarily a professional organization in the Australasian region, which seeks to promote the exchange of information on all aspects of wild animal husbandry, and in so doing add to the conservation of rare and endangered species. The Society achieves these objectives through the production its journal, \\"Thylacinus\\", e-newsletters, workshops, and annual conferences which are held throughout the Australasian region. ASZK currently has over 400 members covering Australia, New Zealand, and overseas members from Japan and the United States. Berufsverband der Zootierpfleger (BdZ) The Berufsverband der Zootierpfleger was founded in 1993 at the Zoo Frankfurt. Our Association now has more than 1,000 members mainly in Germany, but also in Switzerland, Austria, and Denmark. We want to promote nature conservation and species protection, but most importantly we care about the education and training of zookeepers. BdZ has a journal three times a year and several special editions with different topics. BdZ has annual meeting and several workshops through the year, sometimes in other countries. We are associated member of the EAZA and working closely together with the other German zoo organizations. Stichting De Harpij The Harpy Foundation is an organization for Dutch and Belgian zoo employees. It does not have a membership, but does publish a quarterly journal, “The Harpy”, that is available by subscription. The foundation’s chief goal is “the improvement of care and well-being of non- domestic animals in the broadest sense of the word”. The Harpy’s began in 1980 when a group of zookeepers from the former Wassenaar Zoo took the initiative to distribute a newsletter written by zookeepers for zookeepers. They hoped via this publication to broaden their knowledge by exchanging experiences with keepers in other zoos. The first years were quite difficult, and it was sometimes questionable whether there was a reason to continue. But by 1985 the interest in the publication had grown, eventually resulting in the official establishment of the Harpy Foundation on May 18, 1988. Much has changed in the years since then. Thanks to the support from the directorship of the participating zoos, and the efforts of approximately 30 zoo personnel, the Harpy Foundation has grown into an organization that is here to stay in the zoo world. The primary target group is the personnel of zoos in the Netherlands and Belgium that are members of EAZA. Zookeepers Association of the Philippines (ZAP) ZAP is the first professional association of zookeepers in the Philippines. ZAP's aims and objectives are to professionalize and promote brotherhood among zookeepers, to serve as a venue for networking and exchange of ideas and information, to promote concerted effort of zookeepers for education and conservation of wildlife, and to uphold standards on rescue, display and captive breeding of wild animals. ZAP has more than 90 members nationwide. ZAP is one of two Professional Associations the ICZ helped to organize. Partners and supporting members The Partners for the ICZ are; the International Rhino Keeper Association, the International Association of Avian Trainers and Educators (IATTE), and the Shape of Enrichment. The Supporting Members for the ICZ are; Zoo Frankfurt, Wildlife Reserves Singapore, Travel Traffic Web Design, Woodland Park Zoo, Chester Zoo, Barcelona Zoo, Zoo Leipzig, Busch Gardens Tampa, Florida, and Zoo de Lagos.

The church is often referred to as a cathedral (\\"cattedrale\\") but has never been the seat of a bishop. It is dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. History  The church is documented for the first time in the 12th century (1149–60). A palaeo- Christian church was possibly first built in the 5th century over a temple dedicated to the pagan goddess Cybele. The Romanesque church was refurbished in the next century in a Gothic style. Description The church has a tall square bell-tower with rounded arches. The Gothic portico leads to a nave supported by marble columns. The lunette of the portico was frescoed in the 15th century with a Madonna and Child with Saints Peter and Epaphroditus and Christ and four angels by Pietro Colaberti of Piperno. The interior chapels also have frescoes. The first chapel on the right was refurbished in the 1590s by the De Marchis family. The wall frescoes depict contemporary figures such as Carlo Borromeo and the donors. The main altarpiece, the Madonna degli Angeli (c. 1452), is attributed to Benozzo Gozzoli. Other sources attribute the work to the time after a plague epidemic or earthquake in 1456–57. The church also has frescoes attributed to Bernardino Cesari depicting the Life of the Virgin.Pro Loco Sermoneta website, entry on cathedral. Works of art in the church is an altarpiece depicting the Holy Family with St Anne and John from a 16th-century Neapolitan artist. The church also has a 15th-century Last Judgement fresco.

Built in 1860, it is one of the village's finest examples of high-style Greek Revival architecture, and is sited on one of the few town farmsteads that has not been subdivided. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008; it was previously listed as a contributing property to the West Dover Village Historic District. Description and history The Corse-Shippee House is located just on the southern fringe of West Dover Village, on the east side of Dorr Fitch Road a short way southeast of its junction with Vermont Route 100. It is set on a parcel of land, along with a number of minor outbuildings. This lot is one- half of the original farmstead, whose other half is undeveloped. The house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, asbestos siding (laid over the original clapboards), two interior chimneys, and a rubble stone foundation. The house is oriented perpendicular to the street, and has matching facades on its long sides. Both are symmetrical, with an elaborate entrance flanked by sidelight windows and pilasters, and topped by a corniced entablature. The building corners are pilastered. An ell with a cross gable roof extends from the east (back) side of the building. The interior is remarkably unaltered, having only had one wall removed, and a bathroom added on the first floor. The main house was built in 1860 by Orville Corse, and may have originally served as a tavern, given the configuration with two primary entrances. Since 1907 it has been owned by members of the Shippee family. It is the only two-story Greek Revival house in West Dover, and is one of the finest of the style in the entire town. Its siting on a substantial portion of the original farm property is also rare in the town, where many farms have been subdvidided for development.

Lying between those is the Pampas region, featuring a mild and humid climate. Many regions have different, often contrasting, microclimates. In general, Argentina has four main climate types: warm, moderate, arid, and cold in which the relief features, and the latitudinal extent of the country, determine the different varieties within the main climate types. Northern parts of the country are characterized by hot, humid summers with mild, drier winters, and highly seasonal precipitation. Mesopotamia, located in northeast Argentina, has a subtropical climate with no dry season and is characterized by high temperatures and abundant rainfall because of exposure to moist easterly winds from the Atlantic Ocean throughout the year. The Chaco region in the center- north, despite being relatively homogeneous in terms of precipitation and temperature, is the warmest region in Argentina, and one of the few natural areas in the world located between tropical and temperate latitudes that is not a desert. Precipitation decreases from east to west in the Chaco region because eastern areas are more influenced by moist air from the Atlantic Ocean than the west, resulting in the vegetation transitioning from forests and marshes to shrubs. Northwest Argentina is predominantly dry, hot, and subtropical although its rugged topography results in a diverse climate. Central Argentina, which includes the Pampas to the east, and the Cuyo region to the west, has a temperate climate with hot summers and cool, drier winters. In the Cuyo region, the Andes obstruct the path of rain-bearing clouds from the Pacific Ocean; moreover, its latitude coincides with the subtropical high. Both factors render the region dry. With a wide range of altitudes, the Cuyo region is climatically diverse, with icy conditions persisting at altitudes higher than . The Pampas is mostly flat and receives more precipitation, averaging in the western parts to in the eastern parts. The weather in the Pampas is variable due to the contrasting air masses and frontal storms that impact the region. These can generate thunderstorms with intense hailstorms and precipitation, and are known to have the most frequent lightning, and highest convective cloud tops, in the world. Patagonia, in the south, is mostly arid or semi–arid except in the extreme west where abundant precipitation supports dense forest coverage, glaciers, and permanent snowfields. Its climate is classified as temperate to cool temperate with the surrounding oceans moderating temperatures on the coast. Away from the coast, areas on the plateaus have large daily and annual temperature ranges. The influence of the Andes, in conjunction with general circulation patterns, generates one of the strongest precipitation gradients (rate of change in mean annual precipitation in relation to a particular location) in the world, decreasing rapidly to the east. In much of Patagonia precipitation is concentrated in winter with snowfall occurring occasionally, particularly in the mountainous west and south; precipitation is more evenly distributed in the east and south. One defining characteristic is the strong winds from the west which blow year-round, lowering the perception of temperature (wind chill), while being a factor in keeping the region arid by favouring evaporation. Definition of the regions In general, Argentina has four main climate types: warm, moderate, arid, and cold, all determined by the expanse across latitude, range in altitude, and relief features. The vast size, and wide range of altitudes, contribute to Argentina's diverse climate. Argentina possesses a wide variety of climatic regions ranging from subtropical in the north to subantarctic in the far south. Lying between those is the Pampas region, which features a mild and humid climate. Under the Köppen climate classification, Argentina has 11 different climate types: Humid Subtropical (Cfa, Cwa), moderate oceanic (Cfb), warm semi-arid (BSh), subtropical highland oceanic (Cwb), warm desert (BWh), cold semi–arid (BSk), cold desert (BWk), moderate Mediterranean (Csb), cold oceanic (Cfc), and tundra (ET). Consequently, there is a wide variety of biomes in the country, including subtropical rain forests, semi-arid and arid regions, temperate plains in the Pampas, and cold subantarctic in the south. However, despite the diversity of biomes, about two-thirds of Argentina is arid or semi-arid. Argentina is best divided into six distinct regions reflecting the climatic conditions of the country as a whole. From north to south, these regions are Northwest, Chaco, Northeast, Cuyo/Monte, Pampas, and Patagonia. Each climatic region has distinctive types of vegetation. Argentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica, which includes the Antarctic Peninsula and a triangular section extending to the South Pole, delimited by the 25° West and 74° West meridians and the 60° South parallel. However, all claims are suspended by the Antarctic Treaty System, of which Argentina is a founding signatory and permanent consulting member. Argentina also claims sovereignty over the Falkland Islands (), and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (). However, the United Kingdom exercises de facto control over both the Falkland Islands, and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, both as British Overseas Territories. Mesopotamia High temperatures and abundant rainfall in much of Mesopotamia enable it to support jungles such as this one in Misiones Province. The region of Mesopotamia includes the provinces of Misiones, Entre Ríos and Corrientes. It lies between the Uruguay and Paraná rivers, which serve as natural borders for the region. It has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa according to the Köppen climate classification). whose main features are high temperatures and abundant rainfall throughout the year. This year-round rainfall occurs because most of the region lies north of the subtropical high pressure belt even in winter, exposing it to moist easterly winds from the Atlantic Ocean throughout the year. Water deficiencies and extended periods of drought are uncommon, and much of the region has a positive water balance (i.e. the precipitation exceeds the potential evapotranspiration). Precipitation Mesopotamia is the wettest region in Argentina with average annual precipitation ranges from less than in the southern parts, to approximately in the eastern parts.Precipitation is slightly higher in summer than in winter, and generally decreases from east to west and from north to south. Summer (December–February) is the most humid season, with precipitation ranging from . Fall (March–May) is the rainiest season, with many places receiving over . Most of the rainfall during summer and fall is caused by convective thunderstorms. Winter (June–August) is the driest season, with a mean precipitation of throughout the region. Most of the winter precipitation is the result of synoptic scale, low pressure weather systems (large scale storms such as extratropical cyclones), particularly the sudestada, which often bring long periods of precipitation, cloudiness, cooler temperatures, and strong winds. Snowfall is extremely rare and mainly confined to the uplands of Misiones Province where the last significant snowfall occurred in 1975 in Bernardo de Irigoyen. Spring (September–November) is similar to fall with a mean precipitation of . Temperatures Mean annual temperatures range from in the south to in the north. Summers are hot and humid while winters are mild. The mean January temperature throughout most of the region is except in the uplands of Misiones Province where they are lower owing to its higher elevation. During heat waves, temperatures can exceed in the summer months, while in the winter months, cold air masses from the south can push temperatures below freezing, causing frost. However, such cold fronts are brief, and are less intense than in areas further south or at higher altitudes. Statistics for selected locations=Chaco Western parts of the Chaco region are characterized by shrubs and low to medium forest cover due to lower precipitation. alt=Marshes in Marshes located in Río Pilcomayo National Park are one of the natural features typical in the eastern parts of the Chaco region, owing to the higher precipitation. The Chaco region in the center-north completely includes the provinces of Chaco, and Formosa. Eastern parts of Jujuy Province, Salta Province, and Tucumán Province, and northern parts of Córdoba Province and Santa Fe Province are part of the region. As well, most of Santiago del Estero Province lies within the region. The region has a subtropical climate. Under the Köppen climate classification, western parts have a semi-arid climate (Bs) while the east has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa). Chaco is one of the few natural regions in the world located between tropical and temperate latitudes that is not a desert. Precipitation and temperature are relatively homogeneous throughout the region. The general atmospheric circulation influences the climate of the region, primarily by two permanent high pressure systems – the South Pacific High and the South Atlantic High – and a low pressure system that develops over northeast Argentina called the Chaco Low. The interaction between the South Atlantic High and the Chaco Low generates a pressure gradient that brings moist air from the east and northeast to eastern coastal and central regions of Argentina. In summer, this interaction strengthens, favouring the development of convective thunderstorms that can result in heavy rainfall. In contrast, winters are dry due to these systems weakening, and the lower insolation that weakens the Chaco Low, and the northward displacement of westerly winds. During the entire year, the South Pacific High influences the climate by bringing cold, moist air masses originating in Patagonia leading to cold temperatures and frost, particularly during winter. Summers feature more stable weather than winter since the South Atlantic and South Pacific highs are at their southernmost positions, making the entrance of cold fronts more difficult. Precipitation Mean annual precipitation ranges from in the eastern parts of Formosa Province to a low of in the west and southwest. Most of the precipitation is concentrated in the summer and decreases from east to west. Summer rains are intense, and torrential rain is common, occasionally causing floods and soil erosion. During the winter months, precipitation is sparse. Eastern areas receive more precipitation than western areas since they are more influenced by moist air from the Atlantic Ocean. This penetrates the eastern areas more than the west, bringing it more precipitation. As a result, the vegetation differs with eastern areas being covered by forests, savannas, marshes, and subtropical wet forest, while western areas are dominated by medium and low forests of mesophytic and xerophytic trees, and a dense understory of shrubs and grasses. The western part has a pronounced dry winter season while the eastern parts have a slightly drier season. In all parts of the region, precipitation is highly variable from year to year. The eastern part of the region receives just enough precipitation to have a positive water balance. By contrast, the western parts of the region have a negative water balance (the potential evapotranspiration exceeds the precipitation) owing to lower precipitation. Temperatures The Chaco region is the hottest in Argentina, with a mean annual temperature of . With mean summer temperatures reaching , the region has the hottest summers in the country. Winters are mild and brief, with mean temperatures in July ranging from in the northern parts to in the southernmost parts. Absolute maximum temperatures can reach up to while during cold waves, temperatures can fall to . Eastern areas are more strongly influenced by maritime climate than western areas, leading to a smaller thermal amplitude (difference between average high and average low temperatures). This results in absolute maximum and minimum temperatures being and in the east compared to more than and in the west. Statistics for selected locations=Northwest Owing to orographic precipitation, the high rainfall creates the thick Yungas jungle on the eastern slopes in the Andes in northwest Argentina. The Altiplano/Puna region is located in western parts of the region, characterized by an arid and cold climate with large diurnal ranges and high sunshine duration. Lerma Valley in Salta. The temperate valleys in Jujuy Province and Salta Province have a mild climate with wet summers and dry winters. Arid and hot weather predominate at the lower altitudes in the Andean valleys in northwest Argentina. Northwest Argentina consists of the provinces of Catamarca, Jujuy, La Rioja, and western parts of Salta Province, and Tucumán Province. Although Santiago del Estero Province is part of northwest Argentina, much of the province lies in the Chaco region. Northwest Argentina is predominantly dry, hot, and subtropical. Owing to its rugged topography, the region is climatically diverse, depending on the altitude, temperature, and distribution of precipitation. Consequently, vegetation differs within these different climate types. In general, the climate can be divided into two main types: a cold arid or semi-arid climate at the higher altitudes, and warmer subtropical climate in the eastern parts of the region. Under the Köppen climate classification, the region has 5 different climate types: semi–arid (BS), arid (BW), temperate climate without a dry season and with a dry season (Cf and Cw respectively), and an alpine climate at the highest altitudes. The atmospheric circulation is controlled by the two semi–permanent South Atlantic and South Pacific highs, and the Chaco Low. During summer, the interaction between the South Atlantic High and the Chaco Low brings northeasterly and easterly winds that carry moisture to the region, particularly in the northern parts. The movement of moist air into the region during summer results in very high precipitation. Most of the precipitation comes from the east since the Andes block most moisture from the Pacific Ocean. Southern parts of the region are influenced by cold fronts travelling northward. These cold fronts are responsible for producing precipitation during summer. For example, in Tucumán Province, cold fronts are responsible for 70% of the rainfall in that province. Furthermore, the intertropical convergence zone (or doldrums) reaches the region during the summer months, leading to enhanced precipitation. During the winter months, the intertropical convergence zone, the South Pacific, and the South Atlantic highs move northward while the Chaco Low weakens, all of which results in the suppression of rain during the winter. With the Andes blocking most rain bearing clouds from the Pacific Ocean, along with atmospheric circulation patterns unfavourable for rain, this results in a dry season during winter. The Chaco Low attracts air masses from the South Pacific High, creating a dry and cold wind, particularly during winter. At the highest altitudes, westerly winds from the Pacific Ocean can penetrate during the winter months, leading to snowstorms. Precipitation The Andes are the principal factor that determines the precipitation/rainfall regime (seasonal distribution of rainfall). Without the Andes, the climate of northwest Argentina would have been arid and resembled that of northern Chile. Precipitation is highly seasonal and mostly concentrated in the summer months. About 90% of the annual precipitation falls from November to April, which constitutes the wet season while the dry season is from May until October when precipitation is sparse. It is distributed irregularly owing to the country's topography although it generally decreases from east to west. There is great variation in precipitation both seasonally and annually. As moist air reaches the eastern slopes of the mountains, it rises and cools adiabatically, leading to the formation of clouds that generate copious amounts of rain. The eastern slopes of the mountains receive between of precipitation a year although some places receive up to of precipitation annually owing to orographic precipitation. In the south, the orographic effect is enhanced by advancing cold fronts from the south, resulting in increased precipitation. The high rainfall on these first slopes creates the thick Yungas jungle that extends in a narrow strip along these ranges. During fall, the jungles are covered by fog and complete cloud cover. Beyond the first slopes of the Andes into the valleys, the air descends, warming adiabatically, and becoming drier than on the eastern slopes. The north–south orientation of the mountains, which increase in altitude to the west, and a discontinuous topography, creates valleys with regions of relatively high orographic precipitation in the west and drier regions in east. The temperate valleys, which include major cities such as Salta and Jujuy, have an average precipitation ranging between . These valleys lie in a transitional area between the sub–humid climate in the west where the first slopes of Andes occur and the semi–arid climates to the east in the Chaco region. to the west For example, in the Lerma Valley, which is surrounded by tall mountains, (only the northeastern part of the valley is surrounded by shorter mountains), precipitation ranges from in Salta to in San Lorenzo, just away. Rainfall in the temperate valleys is mainly concentrated in the summer months, often falling in short but heavy bursts. Valleys in the southern parts of the region are drier than valleys in the north due to the greater height of the Andes and the Sierras Pampeanas on the eastern slopes compared to the mountains in the north (ranging from ), presenting a significant orographic barrier that blocks moist winds from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. These valleys receive less than of precipitation per year, and are characterized by sparse vegetation adapted to the arid climate. The area further west is the Puna region, a plateau with an average altitude of that is mostly a desert due to the easterly winds being blocked by the Andes and the northwest extension of the Sierras Pampeanas. Precipitation in the Puna region averages less than a year while potential evapotranspiration ranges from a year, owing to the high insolation, strong winds, and low humidity that exacerbates the dry conditions. This results in the Puna region having a water deficit in all months. The southeast parts of the Puna region are very arid receiving an average of , while in the northeastern area, average annual precipitation ranges from . Although easterly winds are rare in the Puna region, they bring 88%–96% of the area's precipitation. Snowfall is rare, averaging less than five days of snow per year. Due to the aridity of these mountains at high altitudes, the snowline can extend as far up as above sea level. The El Niño–Southern Oscillation influences precipitation levels in northwest Argentina. During an El Niño year, westerly flow is strengthened, while moisture content from the east is reduced resulting in a drier rainy season. In contrast, during a La Niña year, there is enhanced easterly moisture transport, resulting in a more intense rainy season. Nonetheless, this trend is highly variable both spatially and temporally. Temperatures Temperatures in northwest Argentina vary by altitude. The temperate valleys have a temperate climate, with mild summers, and dry and cool winters with regular frosts. The diurnal range in cities is fairly wide, particularly in the winter. In the Yungas jungle to the east, the climate is hot and humid with temperatures that vary significantly based on latitude and altitude. Mean annual temperatures in the Yungas range between . The mean annual temperatures in the Quebrada de Humahuaca valley range from , depending on altitude. In the Calchaquí Valleys in Salta Province, the climate is temperate and arid with large thermal amplitudes, long summers, and a long frost free period which varies by altitude. In both the Quebrada de Humahuaca and Calchaquí valleys, winters are cold with frosts that can occur between March and September. In the valleys in the south in La Rioja and Catamarca Provinces, along with the southwest parts of Santiago del Estero Province, temperatures during the summer are very high averaging in January, while winters are mild averaging . The mean annual temperatures in this region ranges between . Temperatures can exceed during the summer, particularly in the central valley of Catamarca (Valle Central de Catamarca) and the valley of La Rioja Capital which lie at lower altitudes. During winter, cold fronts from the south bringing cold Antarctic air can cause temperatures to fall between with severe frosts. In contrast, the Zonda wind, which occurs more often during the winter months, can raise temperatures up to with strong gusts, sometimes causing crop damage. Temperatures are much colder in the Puna region, with a mean annual temperature of less than owing to its high altitude. The Puna region is characterized by being cold but sunny throughout the year, with frosts that can occur in any month. The diurnal range is large, with a thermal amplitude that can exceed due to the low humidity and the intense sunlight throughout the year. Absolute maximum temperatures in the Puna region can reach up to while absolute minimum temperatures can fall below . Statistics for selected locations=Cuyo Much of the Cuyo region is dry, depending on rivers for irrigation. alt=Snow storm near Colder weather predominates at higher altitudes in the Cuyo region which can receive snow during the winter. The Cuyo region includes the provinces of Mendoza, San Juan, and San Luis. Western parts of La Pampa Province (as shown in map) also belong in this region, having similar climatic and soil characteristics to it. It has an arid or semi-arid climate. The wide range in latitudes, combined with altitudes ranging from to nearly , means that it has a variety of different climate types. In general, most of the region has a temperate climate, with higher altitude valleys having a more milder climate. At the highest altitudes (over ), icy conditions persist year round. With very low humidity, abundant sunshine throughout the year, and a temperate climate, the region is suitable for wine production. The Andes prevent rain-bearing clouds from the Pacific Ocean from moving in, while its latitude puts it in a band of the sub-tropical high pressure belt keeping the region dry. Droughts are often frequent and prolonged. The Cuyo region is influenced by the subtropical, semi–permanent South Atlantic High to the east in the Atlantic, the semi- permanent South Pacific High to the west of the Andes, and the development of the Chaco Low and westerlies in the southern parts of the region. Most of the precipitation falls during the summer due to the stronger interaction between the Chaco Low and the South Atlantic High. Precipitation Average annual precipitation ranges between though this varies from year to year. More than 85% of the annual rainfall occurs from October to March, which constitutes the warm season. Eastern and southeastern areas of the region receive more precipitation than western areas since they receive more summer rainfall. As such, most of Mendoza and San Juan Provinces receive the lowest annual precipitation, with mean summer precipitation averaging less than and in rare cases, no summer rainfall. Further eastward, in San Luis Province, mean summer rainfall averages around and can exceed in some areas. Higher altitude locations receive precipitation in the form of snow during the winter months. In the Cuyo region, annual precipitation is highly variable from year to year and appears to follow a cycle between dry and wet years in periods of about 2, 4–5, 6–8, and 16–22 years. In wet years, easterly winds caused by the subtropical South Atlantic High are stronger, which causes more moisture to flow towards this region; during the dry years, these winds are weaker. Temperatures Mean annual temperatures range from . Summers in the region are hot and generally very sunny, averaging as much as 10 hours of sunshine per day. The average temperature in January is in most of the region. In contrast, winters are dry and cold and average around 7–8 hours of sunshine per day. July temperatures range from . Since this region has a wide range of altitudes ranging from to nearly , temperatures can vary widely with altitude. The Sierras Pampeanas, which cross into both San Juan and San Luis Provinces, have a milder climate with mean annual temperatures ranging from . In all locations, at altitudes over , permafrost is present, while icy conditions persist year round at altitudes over . The region is characterized by a large diurnal range with very hot temperatures during the day followed by cold nights. The Zonda wind, a foehn wind characterized by warm, dry air can cause temperatures to exceed . In some cases, such as in 2003, they can exceed . This wind often occurs before the passage of a cold front across Argentina, and tends to occur when a low pressure system brings heavy rain to the Chilean side, and when an upper-level trough allows the winds to pass over the Andes to descend downwards. As such, the temperature may rise as much as in a few hours, with humidity approaching 0% during a Zonda wind event. In contrast, cold waves are also common, owing to the Andes channeling cold air from the south, allowing cold fronts to come frequently during the winter months, causing cool to cold temperatures with temperatures that can fall below freezing. Temperatures can dip below at the higher altitudes. Statistics for selected locations=Pampas Pampas landscape The Pampas includes all of Buenos Aires Province, eastern and southern Córdoba Province, eastern La Pampa Province, and southern Santa Fe Province. It is subdivided into two parts: the humid Pampas to the east, and the dry/semi–arid Pampas to the west. This region's land is appropriate for agricultural and livestock activities. It is mostly a flat area, interrupted only by the Tandilia and Ventana hills in its southern portion. The climate of the Pampas is temperate and humid with no dry season, featuring hot summers and mild winters (Cfa/Cfb according to the Köppen climate classification). The weather in the Pampas is variable due to the contrasting air masses and frontal storms that impact the region. Maritime polar air from the south produces the cool pampero winds, while warm humid tropical air from the north produces sultry nortes – a gentle wind usually from the northeast formed by trade winds, and the South Atlantic High that brings cloudy, hot, and humid weather and is responsible for bringing heat waves. The Pampas are influenced by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation which is responsible for variations in annual precipitation. An El Niño year often leads to higher precipitation, while a La Niña year leads to lower precipitation. The Pampas are moderately sunny, ranging from an average of 4–5 hours of sunshine per day during the winter months to 8–9 hours in summer. Precipitation Precipitation decreases from east to west, and ranges from in the northeast, to under in the south and west. Most regions receive of precipitation per year. Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year in the easternmost parts, while in the western parts most of the precipitation is concentrated during the summer months and winters are drier. In many places precipitation, which mostly occurs in the form of convective thunderstorms, is high during summer. These thunderstorms form when cold air from the south, caused by the pampero wind, meets humid tropical air masses from the north, and are some of the most intense storms in the world, with the most frequent lightning and the highest convective cloud tops. These severe thunderstorms produce intense amounts of precipitation and hailstorms, and can cause both floods and flash floods. As well, the Pampas is the most consistently active tornado region outside the central and southeastern United States. Autumn and spring bring periods of very rainy weather followed by dry, mild stretches. Places in the east receive rainfall throughout autumn, whereas in the west it quickly becomes very dry. Winters are drier in most places due to weaker easterly winds, and stronger southerly winds, which prevent moist air from coming in. In winter, most of the precipitation occurs from frontal systems associated with cyclogenesis and strong southeasterly winds (sudestada), which bring long periods of precipitation, and cloudiness, particularly in the southern and eastern parts. As such, precipitation is more evenly distributed in the eastern parts than the western parts, which are further away from these frontal systems. Dull, grey, and damp weather characterize winters in the Pampas. Snowfall is extremely rare; when it does snow, it usually lasts for only a day or two. Temperatures Annual temperatures range from in the northern parts to in the south. Córdoba Province has higher temperatures than the rest of the region while the few higher altitude areas have colder weather. Summers in the Pampas are hot and humid; coastal areas are moderated by the cold Malvinas Current. Heat waves that can bring temperatures in the range for a few days. These are usually followed by a day or two of strong pampero winds from the south, which bring cool, dry air. Autumn arrives in March and brings periods of mild daytime temperatures and cool nights. Generally, frost arrives in early April in the southernmost areas, and in late May in the north and ends by mid-September – although the dates of the first and last frosts can vary from year to year. Frost is rarely intense, nor prolonged, and does not occur in some years. Winters are mild with frequent frosts and cold spells. Temperatures are usually mild during the day and cold during the night. Occasionally, tropical air masses from the north may move southward, providing relief from the cool, damp temperatures. On the other hand, the sudestada and the pampero winds bring periods of cool to cold temperatures. Statistics for selected locations=Patagonia Typical landscape view of the central Patagonian plateaus in Chubut Province alt=View of View of Bariloche and Nahuel Huapi Lake. Most of western Patagonia receives abundant precipitation, allowing it to support forests and lakes. alt=View of High precipitation along with cold temperatures in the west form permanent snowfields such as the Perito Moreno Glacier. One defining characteristic of the climate is the strong, persistent winds from the west year round owing to the lack of land at higher latitudes that can block these winds. This forms characteristic Flag trees such as this one near Ushuaia. Chubut, Neuquén, Río Negro, Santa Cruz, and Tierra del Fuego are the provinces that make up Patagonia. The Patagonian climate is classified as arid to semi-arid and temperate to cool temperate. The exception is the Bosque Andino Patagónico, a forested area located in the extreme west and southern parts of Tierra del Fuego Province, which has a humid, wet, and cool to cold climate. One defining characteristic is the strong winds from the west which blow year round (stronger in summer than in winter). These favor evaporation, and are a factor in making the region mostly arid. Mean annual wind speeds range between , although gusts of over are common. There are three major factors that influence the climate of this region: the Andes, the South Pacific and the South Atlantic Highs, and higher insolation in eastern than in western areas. The Andes play a crucial role in determining the climate of Patagonia because their north–south orientation creates a barrier for humid air masses coming from the Pacific Ocean. Since the predominant wind is from the west and most air masses come from the Pacific Ocean, the Andes cause these air masses to ascend, cooling adiabatically. Most of the moisture is dropped on the Chilean side, resulting in abundant precipitation, while in much of the Argentine side, the air warms adiabatically and becomes drier as it descends. As a result, the Andes create an extensive rain-shadow in much of Argentine Patagonia, causing most of the region to be arid. South of 52oS, the Andes are lower in elevation, reducing the rain shadow effect in Tierra del Fuego Province, allowing forests to thrive on the Atlantic coast. Patagonia is located between the subtropical high pressure belt, and the subpolar low pressure zone, meaning it is exposed to westerly winds that are strong, since south of 40o S, there is little land to block these winds. Being located between the semipermanent South Pacific and the South Atlantic Highs at around 30oS, and the Subpolar Low at around 60o S, the movement of the high and low pressure systems, along with ocean currents, determine the precipitation pattern. During winter, both the South Pacific and South Atlantic highs move to the north, while the Subpolar Low strengthens, which, when combined with higher ocean temperatures than the surrounding land, results in higher precipitation during this time of the year. Due to the northward migration of the South Pacific High, more frontal systems can pass through, allowing for more precipitation to occur. During summer, the South Pacific High migrates southward, preventing the passage of fronts, and cyclones that can cause precipitation to occur, resulting in lower precipitation during this time of the year. Northeastern areas, along with southern parts of the region, are influenced by air masses from the Atlantic Ocean, resulting in precipitation being more evenly distributed throughout the year. Most precipitation comes from frontal systems, particularly stationary fronts that bring humid air from the Atlantic Ocean. Cold fronts usually move from west to east, or from southwest to northeast, but rarely from the south. Because of this, these cold fronts do not result in the cold being intense since they are moderated as they pass over the surrounding oceans. In the rare cases when cold fronts move northwards from the south (Antarctica), the cold air masses are not moderated by the surrounding oceans, resulting in very cold temperatures throughout the region. In general, the passage of cold fronts is more common in the south than in the north, and occurs more in winter than in summer. The movement of warm, subtropical air into the region occurs frequently in summer up to 46oS. When warm subtropical air arrives in the region, the air is dry, resulting in little precipitation, and causes temperatures to be higher than those observed in northeast Argentina. Precipitation The influence of the Pacific Ocean, general circulation patterns, and the topographic barrier caused by the Andes, results in one of the strongest precipitation gradients in the world. Precipitation decreases steeply from west to east, ranging from in the west on the Andean foothills at 41oS, to in the central plateaus. For example, while mean annual precipitation is more at the Andean foothills, in less than to the east, precipitation decreases to . The high precipitation in the Andes in this region supports glaciers and permanent snowfields. Most of the region receives less than of precipitation per year, although some areas can receive less than . In northern Río Negro Province and eastern Neuquén Province, mean annual precipitation is around while south of 50oS, precipitation increases southwards, reaching up to . There is a narrow transition zone running down from 39oS to 47oS that receives about of precipitation a year. Much of northwestern Patagonia in the Andes, corresponding to the northern parts of the Bosque Andino Patagónico region, receives abundant precipitation in winter with occasional droughts in summer, allowing it to support forests with dense coverage. With the exception of certain areas such as Puerto Blest, no major towns receive more than of precipitation a year. The southern parts of the Bosque Andino Patagónico region receive only resulting in less dense forest coverage. The lower precipitation, compared to the northern parts, is due to the winds being more intense and drier, favouring evapotranspiration. The snow line ranges from an altitude of in the north to above sea level in the south. The aridity of the region is due to the combination of low precipitation, strong winds, and high temperatures in the summer months, each of which cause high evaporation rates. Mean evapotranspiration ranges from , which decreases from northeast to southwest. In most of Patagonia, precipitation is concentrated in the winter months with the exception of northeastern and southern areas of the region which have a more even distribution of precipitation throughout the year. As a result, except for these areas, the winter maxima in precipitation results in a strong water deficit in the summer. Most precipitation events are light; each event usually results in less than . Thunderstorms are infrequent in the region, occurring an average of 5 days per year, only during summer. In Tierra del Fuego, thunderstorms are non-existent. Snowfall occurs on 5 to 20 days per year, mainly in the west and south. These snowfall events can result in strong snow storms. Despite the low precipitation, Patagonia is cloudy, with the mean cloud cover ranging from 50% in eastern parts of Neuquén Province and northeast Río Negro Province to 70% in Tierra del Fuego Province; the region has one of the highest percentages of cloud cover in Argentina. In general, mountainous areas are the cloudiest, and coastal areas are cloudier than inland areas. Northern areas are sunnier (50% possible sunshine) than the southern parts of the region such as western Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego Provinces (less than 40% possible sunshine). The southernmost islands receive some of the lowest average annual sunshine hours in the world. Temperatures Temperatures are relatively cold for its latitude due to the cold Malvinas Current and the high altitude. For example, in Tierra del Fuego temperatures are colder than at equal latitudes in the northern hemisphere in Europe since they are influenced by the cold Malvinas Current rather than the warm North Atlantic Current. A characteristic of the temperature pattern is the NW–SE distribution of isotherms due to the presence of the Andes. The warmest areas are in northern parts of Río Negro and Neuquén Provinces where mean annual temperatures range from , while the coldest are in western Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego Provinces where mean annual temperatures range from . On the Patagonian plateaus, mean annual temperatures range from which decreases towards the west. The daily and annual range of temperatures on these plateaus is very high. The Atlantic Ocean moderates the climate of coastal areas resulting in a lower annual and daily range of temperatures. Towards the south, where land masses are narrow, the Pacific Ocean influences coastal areas in addition to the Atlantic Ocean, ensuring that the cold is neither prolonged nor intense. At higher altitudes in the Andes, stretching from Neuquén Province to Tierra del Fuego Province, mean annual temperatures are below . Generally, mean annual temperatures vary more with altitude than with latitude since the temperature gradient for latitude is relatively moderate owing to ocean currents. Summers have a less uniform distribution of temperature, and in the months December to January mean temperatures range from in northern Río Negro Province and eastern parts of Neuquén Province to in Tierra del Fuego. Winters have a more uniform temperature distribution. In July, mean temperatures are above in all of extra–Andean Patagonia, ranging from in the north to around in Ushuaia. Being exposed to strong westerly winds can decrease the perception of temperature (wind chill), particularly in summer. The wind lowers the perception of the mean annual temperature by throughout the region. The annual range of temperatures in Patagonia is lower than in areas in the Northern Hemisphere at the same latitude owing to the maritime influences of the sea. In Patagonia, the annual range of temperatures ranges from in the north and decreases progressively southwards to on the southernmost islands. This contrasts with an annual range of more than in North America at latitudes above 50oN. Absolute maximum temperatures can exceed in the northern Río Negro Province and Neuquén Province, while in much of the region, they can exceed . Further south in Tierra del Fuego Province, absolute maximum temperatures do not exceed , while in the southernmost islands, they do not exceed . Absolute minimum temperatures are more than in coastal areas, while in the central Patagonian plateaus, they can reach below .

Kakakhel was a member of the Central Asia Supreme Council and a senior member of the Aga Khan Council. He was a ruling official during the Frontier Crimes Regulations (FCR) period in the early 1970s.  Early life  Kakakhel was born on September 5, 1905 in the Golaghmuli Valley of Ghizer District, Gilgit-Baltistan. His father, a shepherd, disappeared for several months before Hayat was born. A few months after Hayat's birth, his older brother died in an accident. Hayat belonged to the ruling Syed family and, at the age of 21, he was sent to Gilgit to live with the raja. Years later Kakakhel returned to his village and succeeded his uncle, Zumbool Hayat. The assistant of Raja Gupis, Maqpoon Hussain Ali Khan, he was given the title \\"Numberdar-e-Aala\\".  Shandur polo ground  In 1935, Gilgit-Baltistan administrator E.H. Cobb asked Kakakhel to construct a polo ground in Shandur Top. The project was completed with the help of villagers from his hometown. The polo ground was about , smaller than a standard field of , and was named Mas Junali. The name was derived from the Khowar language, in which mas means \\"moon\\" and junali means \\"polo ground\\"; Cobb enjoyed playing polo by moonlight. Impressed with his efficiency in constructing the polo ground, Cobb offered Kakakhel a reward which was refused; since the local villagers had done most of the work, Kakakhel asked Cobb to stock the local waterways with fish. Cobb imported trout from England, introducing them to the Ghizer River. As a result of the new fish population, the Directorate of Fisheries came into being and provided hundreds of jobs. The trout population has reached in Hundrap Lake and in Baha Khukush Lake. Mas Junali became a meeting place for residents of Gilgit-Baltistan and Chitral. The Shandur Polo Festival, held annually since 1936, has highlighted matches between teams from Chitral and Gilgit-Baltistan. Because Mas Junali is the highest polo ground in the world, the festival has become a tourist attraction.  Malan Shal issue  In 1959, Chitral residents from the Ukilay and Bojoky tribes did not pay taxes. Due to the nonpayment, a group from the Golaghmuli Valley went to Malan Shal and took 40 sheep. Another group, from Chitral, took nine yaks from Ghizer District. To recover the yaks, Kakakhel met with the governor of Mastuj and recovered seven of them. After the incident the Chitrali people had been expelled from Malan Shal and Shandur, but the governor allowed them to return. However, the Chitrali ignored a decision of Koh-e-Ghizer's ruler by collecting firewood from Khukush and were again expelled from Shandur Top. In 1961 another firewood-collecting violation occurred in Shandur Ghizer, and the tribesmen returned to Shandur. The government of Gilgit Baltistan took no action in response.
