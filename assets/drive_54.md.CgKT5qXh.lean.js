Though she belonged to one of the wealthiest families of Maryland, she believed in the doctrine of self-support and left home to engage in teaching, first in Kentucky and North Carolina, and afterward in New York and Connecticut. On returning from an extended tour of Europe, she published My Journal in Foreign Lands (New York, 1885). This was followed by other volumes, among them: Studies in Criticism (New York, 1888), Under the Second Renaissance (Buffalo, 1894), and A History of Italian Literature. Early life and education Florence Trail was born in Frederick, Maryland, September 1, 1854. She was the second daughter of Charles Edward Trail and Ariana McElfresh. Her siblings included, Anna M. Harding, Henry Trail, Bertha Trail, and Charles Bayard Trail. A severe illness at 10 years of age left her with impaired hearing. Her quickness of perception and efforts to divine what others meant to say caused them to forget, or not to realize, that her hearing was not equal to their own. She graduated first in her class in the Frederick Female Seminary, in 1872, having studied mental and moral philosophy, evidences of Christianity, modern history, mythology, rhetoric and composition. The following year, she graduated with highest honors from Mt. Vernon Institute, Baltimore. Career After teaching for four years at the Frederick Female Seminary, she left home for a position in Daughters College, Harrodsburg, Kentucky, where she afterwards taught Latin, French, art and music. In Harrodsburg, as well as in Tarboro, North Carolina, where she taught music in 1887 and 1888, and in Miss Hogarth's school, Goshen, New York, where she acted as substitute for some weeks in January, 1890, she made many devoted friends and did superior work as a teacher. In 1883, she visited Europe, and afterwards published an account of her travels under the title My Journal in Foreign Lands (New York, 1885), which passed through two editions and served as a guide-book. Trail has been a member of the Society to Encourage Studies at Home for 14 years, five as a student of modern history, French literature, Shakespeare and art, and nine as a teacher of ancient history. Her essay on \\"Prehistoric Greece as we find it in the Poems of Homer \\" was read before that society at the annual reunion at Miss Ticknor's, in Boston, Massachusetts, in June, 1883. Trail was an accomplished musician, having studied music in the seminary in Frederick, in the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, and in Chickering Hall, New York. She often appeared in concerts with success. Though gifted in many ways, she was best known as a writer. Her best work was, \\"Studies in Criticism\\" (New York, 1888). She published over 100 articles in prose and verse, many without signature, in newspapers and magazines. Inheriting a taste for the languages, she was a fine translator and read German, Italian, Latin and French. She died April 21, 1944.

The case was heard urgently and the Court pronounced its orders on 7 September 2017,. and delivered their reasons for judgment on 28 September 2017. Background When the idea of a postal plebiscite/vote was first raised in August, several legal experts warned of concerns regarding the capacity for such an event to be held without parliamentary approval through enactment of specific legislation. Constitutional expert George Williams described the proposal of the postal survey as a \\"poorly constructed vote for which [the government] doesn't have the correct [legal] procedures\\". Anne Twomey, a constitutional law expert from the University of Sydney expressed scepticism over the role of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) in the survey, stating that \\"the power of the ABS is to collect statistics...rather than opinions. Someone might therefore challenge it on the ground that it does not fall within the legislative functions of the ABS\\". Both experts further doubted the capacity of the Finance Minister to allocate the necessary funding ($122 million) to the ABS, considering that such a non-legislated advance to a department can only be made in \\"urgent\\" and \\"unforeseen circumstances\\". Some constitutional law experts said the survey was likely to be struck down by the courts because \\"[g]iven the long-running debate on same-sex marriage, it is far from obvious that it fits into these [urgent and unforeseen] categories.\\" subscription required The government refused to release to the public the legal advice it received, though Attorney-General George Brandis stated in an interview with the ABC 7.30 program that \\"we have acted on Solicitor-General's advice in which we are confident\\". During court proceedings, the government revealed it was investigating ways to continue with the postal survey even if the legal challenges were successful. Two legal challenges were lodged contesting the legality of the survey with the High Court of Australia, both on the grounds of unlawful funding from legally-specified funds and unlawful operation by the ABS. The High Court agreed to hear arguments in its cases on 5 and 6 September 2017 without ordering any temporary injunction. An additional complaint was lodged by a 17-year-old boy with the Australian Human Rights Commission in August 2017, on the basis that the rules did not allow provisionally enrolled 16- and 17-year-old Australians the right to participate in the survey. The complaint could have led to a federal court case to argue for the right of about 50,000 Australians aged 16 and 17 on the electoral roll to vote, however the boy dropped his complaint on 22 September, after a Greens amendment to the Marriage Law Survey (Additional Safeguards) Act 2017 was rejected by the Parliament earlier in the month. Legal counsel to the boy advised that the rejected amendment would make the age discrimination complaint much more difficult to argue, because parliament had considered and rejected extending the vote to enrolled 16- and 17-year-olds. Argent‚ÄìMarlowe‚ÄìWilkie challenge Same-sex marriage advocates Shelley Argent (national spokeswoman of Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays) and Felicity Marlowe (member of Rainbow Families), along with independent MP Andrew Wilkie, announced they would challenge the postal survey in the High Court on 9 August 2017 and seek a temporary injunction. The Argent-Marlowe- Wilkie challenge was against the Commonwealth of Australia, Mathias Cormann, Scott Morrison, David Kalisch and Tom Rogers, the electoral commissioner. In the government's submissions to this court challenge the government responded that \\"[i]t is not correct to characterise the activity [of participation in the survey] as a vote.\\" The court questioned the validity of Wilkie's claim to standing on the case by virtue of his being a member of Parliament, but did not challenge Marlowe's claim to standing as being in a same-sex relationship. Solicitor-General Stephen Donaghue, for the government, argued that this was not enough for Marlowe to bring the case. Australian Marriage Equality‚ÄìRice challenge On 10 August, the Human Rights Law Centre filed a legal action on behalf of Australian Marriage Equality and Greens Senator Janet Rice. No M106 of 2017. The Australian Marriage Equality-Rice challenge was against Cormann and Kalisch, and argued that the provisions used by Cormann to finance the survey could only be used for ordinary government business. High Court judgment The High Court handed down a summary ruling in both cases on 7 September 2017. The court determined that the survey was lawful, allowing it to proceed as scheduled. The challengers have been ordered to pay costs. The High Court handed down its unanimous reasons on 28 September 2017, finding that $295 million had been appropriated by parliament, and that whether the expenditure was unforeseen was a matter for the Minister's satisfaction and there was no error of law in either his reasoning or his conclusion. The information to be collected was \\"statistical information\\" of matters prescribed in the Census and Statistics Regulation 2016 (Cth). As the court had considered and rejected the grounds of the application, there was no need to decide whether or not whether the plaintiffs had standing.

It was one of the first Woody cartoons in 5 years that was animated by someone, other than Les Kline or Al Coe. In that case, it was Virgil Ross who animated this and the next four cartoons in that same year. In addition to Grace Stafford, who provides Woody's voice, Dal McKennon guest stars. Plot The cartoon opens with a view of a big fancy castle, as a knight (Sir Woody) riding a horse (Sugarfoot) passes by. The narrator explains that during the day of knights, many gallant warriors wander around the realms, looking for any good deeds to do. Sir Woody notices a sign with a proclamation saying Anyone who can break the witch's spell, and turns back the purple dragon into my son, won two weeks vacation to Acapulco. Woody always wanted to spend a vacation on Acapulco, so he accepts the quest. He meets with a wandering minstrel, and asks him where is the location to the purple dragon. The minstrel starts to sing a song about the dragon's location, which is in a cave. He also adverts Woody that he should not enrage it, otherwise he would end up with his feathers burn down. Woody goes to the cave the minstrel cited, and calls for the dragon, only for it spits its fire, causing his horse to run away like a chicken (and turning into one). Woody stops his horse, then he rushes to a nearby lake to fill his helmet with some water. His plan is to throw that water into the dragon, extinguishing his flame power. As he does that, the dragon appears, asking who put out his fire. Woody is surprised once he found out that the purple dragon is very small, and not that mean or groucheous. The dragon says he isn't a dragon, but the king's son who turned into the dragon by the spell of a wicked witch. Woody promises to the dragon that he will locate the witch's lair, found her magic wand, and turning him back into the king's son. Next scene, Woody found the witch's lair. He tries the direct approach, by simply knocking the door. The witch who appears cooking something in her caldron, goes to attend the woodpecker. Woody nicely asks for the witch if she could gives her magic wand for him for a minute. The witch denies it and threatens to turn him into a lizard if he doesn't get out of her lair. Woody just found one wandering in his own, so he put it in the front of the door and he knock it again. The witch opens it again, only to found nothing but a small lizard. She says she doesn't remember turning him into a lizard. She then goes back into her house. She thinks she must be working too hard. She goes back to her caldron, while preparing a soup to her old grandma, as it's good for her lumbago. After putting some spider legs, she proves it and puts some into a bottle for her grandma. She also picks up her wand, before she flies away with her broom. Woody is now at a hole in a tree, just waiting for her come. When she does, he picks up her hat and hides it. The witch notices someone stole her hat, and goes back retrieve it. When she does, Woody put the hat in the front of her way, covering her head, causing the witch to doesn't know where she's going and hit another tree. While the now dizzy witch is laying down, Woody uses the situation to his side, stealing the wand and using her broom to escape. The witch mentions that the wand it's not worth without knowing the magic word. To her dismay, Woody is flying back, following her. When they meet each other, Woody asks her about the magic word. The witch says she'll never tell him that word. Woody then says she doesn't even know that word. The witch denies by saying it right at Woody's front that is Humperdinck. She realises the error she made and cover her mouth, but is too late, as Woody runs back to the dragon. When Woody comes back with the wand and with word memorized, he uses it to break the spell, by turning the dragon into the king's son. To his surprise, the king's son is now a hippie. The hippie sing for a while, until Woody interrupts the song, ordering him to talk to the king. Once in the king's castle, Woody announces to the highness that his son has been returned. The king is happy to see his son again... Until he starts talking and sings another song. The king is not amused, and tells Sir Woody to comes with him. He whispers something in his ears. Knowing what to do, Woody uses the wand to turn the now-hippie king's son back into a dragon, to the former dismay. For Woody's action, the king gives him his reward: a ticket for a two-week vacation in Acapulco. In the final scene, we see Woody enjoying his prize relaxing in a chair. A gorgeous Mexican waitress in a red bikini and a sombrero comes, offering the woodpecker a drink of lemonade. Woody thanks her, and ends the cartoon with his laugh.

History Zimmer began composing music for the Extreme production library in the late '90s, and when Extreme expanded from the UK to the United States in 2001, it set up its offices at Zimmer's Remote Control Productions in Santa Monica, California. In 2012, as Extreme sought to meet increased requests from clients for custom scores for television productions, it partnered with Kofsky and Zimmer to develop what would become Bleeding Fingers Custom Music Shop. During an eight-month test run prior to the company's launch, it created music for 30 television shows, and in August 2013, Bleeding Fingers was officially founded. Extreme's Russell Emanuel served as its CEO and chief creative officer and Kofsky its chairman. With a staff of experienced TV and film composers assembled by Zimmer, Bleeding Fingers initially focused on unscripted, reality, documentary and light drama television productions, developing custom micro-libraries for client properties in keeping with each program's style and tone. Its early work included scores for Survivor, Hatfields & McCoys, The Men Who Built America and Mountain Men, for which it won both ASCAP and BMI awards. In 2016, Bleeding Fingers was selected to score the BBC docu-series Planet Earth II. The theme was written by Zimmer, and composers Jacob Shea and Jasha Klebe wrote the score. More than a year was spent composing the score for the series, which was recorded by an 80-piece orchestra at Air Studios in London. Zimmer, Shea and Klebe were nominated for a British Academy of Television Craft award in the Best Original Television Music category, and Shea and Klebe were nominated for the Emmy in Outstanding Music Composition for a Series (Original Dramatic Score). Bleeding Fingers also composed the score for the BBC's Blue Planet II, a sequel to the 2001 documentary The Blue Planet. To promote the series, Zimmer collaborated with Radiohead to create \\"(ocean) Bloom,\\" an orchestral reworking of Radiohead's song \\"Bloom\\" from the 2011 album The King of Limbs. Emanuel produced the track, which debuted in September 2017. Zimmer co-wrote the score with Shea and Dave Fleming. In October 2017, it was announced that Bleeding Fingers would replace longtime composer Alf Clausen for The Simpsons, beginning with season 29. Bleeding Fingers is based at Remote Control's Santa Monica complex, known as \\"The Stanford of Score.\\" As of 2018, there were 11 full-time composers on the Bleeding Fingers staff, many of whom had apprenticed with Zimmer.

It is one of the eleven hundreds of the County of Adelaide stretching from Glenelg in the northwest to Port Noarlunga in the southwest; and spanning inland between the Sturt and Onkaparinga to Bridgewater in the Adelaide foothills. It was named in 1846 by Governor Frederick Robe, Noarlunga being likely derived from 'nurlongga', an indigenous word referring to the curvature in the Onkaparinga River at Old Noarlunga, dubbed Horseshoe Bend by European settlers. Etymology Contemporary Australian linguists believe the name 'Noarlunga' is derived from the Kaurna nurlo (corner/curve/bend) + ngga (place). Early South Australian Christian missionaries, Christian Teichelmann and Clamor Sch√ºrmann, recorded this meaning of the word in 1840, among about 2000 translations of local indigenous words. The Australasian Biospecimen Network Association (ABNA) records Noarlunga as meaning \\"fishing place\\", as suggested by various early South Australian historians and repeated by some official sources, such as the City of Onkaparinga and the state government land titles office. However, from the 2010s, expert opinion has favoured the \\"curve\\" translation. Local government In the north of the hundred, the District Council of Brighton (later called the City of Marion) was established at Brighton and Marion in 1853. The Town of Glenelg municipality was established at Glenelg in 1855, closely followed by the Town of Brighton (by secession from the district council) in 1858. In 1886 the district council changed its name to District Council of Marion to avoid confusion with the Town of Brighton. The two seaside township councils governed the northern coastal tip of the hundred until 1997 when they merged to form the City of Holdfast Bay. Beside them, Marion council gained city status in the 1940s as the Adelaide metropolis extended southwards and urbanisation took hold throughout the entire council area. Hundred of Noarlunga, 1894 In the south of the hundred the District Council of Morphett Vale was established on 10 November 1853. Seated at Morphett Vale it initially the coastal strip between the southern boundary of Marion council and the Onkaparinga River. In 1856 the District Council of Noarlunga was established from parts of Morphett Vale, north of the Onkaparinga, and Willunga council, south of the river. In 1932 Morphett Vale council was dissolved, and the lands were added to Noarlunga council. In the east of the hundred the District Council of Clarendon was established along with the earliest district councils in the state in 1853. The District Council of Echunga had also been established in 1853 governing a portion in the far east of the hundred and, in 1883, this part was severed along with the south- eastern fringe of the District Council of Mitcham to form the District Council of Stirling. In 1935 Clarendon council was dissolved with parts being annexed to Noarlunga, Willunga and Stirling councils, but the greater part being amalgamated with the council of Echunga, Kondoparinga and Macclesfield to form the new District Council of Meadows, later called the City of Happy Valley and seated at O'Halloran Hill. In 1997 the Noarlunga council was amalgamated with Happy Valley and Willunga to form the City of Onkaparinga, uniting most of the south and east of the hundred under one local government. In the same year the Stirling council was amalgamated with other councils to the north to form the much larger Adelaide Hills Council. The following local government areas of South Australia are situated inside (or largely inside) the bounds of the hundred : * City of Holdfast Bay * City of Marion * City of Onkaparinga (that part north of Onkaparinga River) * Adelaide Hills Council (southern tip east of Cherry Gardens and Clarendon between the Sturt and Onkaparinga rivers to the South Eastern Freeway at Stirling and Bridgewater)  See also  * Lands administrative divisions of South Australia * Old Noarlunga, South Australia * Port Noarlunga, South Australia  References  Noarlunga ","title":"Hundred of Noarlunga"},{"id":"55436114","text":"Agsu City Stadium is a multi-use stadium in Agsu, Azerbaijan.

The products have been supplied to both regional and export customers.  History  In the course of the construction of the oil mill of Franz K√∂cheln at Stephanitorsbollwerk in Bremen during the 1810s, the master miller, who came from Groningen, brought along many assistants, among whom was the 30-year-old Berend Erling, who was singled out as \\"uncommon skilled\\". Erling remained in Bremen after the construction, established himself as a miller, and raised his own first windmill in 1832. The Am Wall Windmill (Herdentorswallm√ºhle) stands today as the last windmill along the old Bremen city wall (Wallanlagen). It was followed in 1846 by the mill at Stephanitor (Stephanitorsm√ºhle), whose upper part burned down in 1911. The bottom part served until 1930 as housing, and was demolished during the renovation of the platforms of the Weserbahnhof train station. Erling's son Johann took over the company and built the steam mill at Tannenstra√üe in Vegesack in 1882, which burned down in 1897. After the first steam mill was destroyed, and with windmills no longer being economically profitable, Carl Erling founded in 1897 a stock company and built a brick building with a steam mill at the Bremen Holzhafen. It had a capacity of 100 tons per day. The wheat that it used was imported from around the world, and the flour that it produced was shipped by barge within Germany. For overseas export, seagoing ships were used. In the following years the mill was enlarged and its capacity grew to about 800 tons per day. In 1925, the first silo tower was built to a plan by Carl Heinrich Behrens-Nicolai, and five years later it made its first acquisition of another mill. In 1940 a second silo was inaugurated that gave the Rolandm√ºhle a storage capacity of 30,000 tons. After acquiring competitors like the Grohner M√ºhlenwerke and the Hansam√ºhle AG during the Great Depression, Hans Erling made the Bremer Rolandm√ºhle AG a family-run company in 1937 with himself as the board director.Helmut R. Hoppe. In: Historische Gesellschaft zu Bremen, Staatsarchiv Bremen (ed.): Bremische Biographie : 1912‚Äì1962. Verlag H. M. Hauschild, Bremen 1969, pg. 140f. The demolition of the mill by explosion on the instigation of the Wehrmacht was interrupted in 1945 by the Second World War. At the beginning of the 1970s, a steel grain silo at the Rolandm√ºhle broke open due to corrosion and emptied out its grain onto the street, without causing any injuries or further property damage.  Flour-dust explosion  The plant made headlines again on 6 February 1979 because of a fire. The cause was one of the largest peace-time explosions to date.R. Eckhoff: Dust Explosions in the Process Industries 2nd ed. Butterworth-Heinemann, , pg. 157 ff. A cable fire triggered the most powerful dust explosion in German history in a sample chamber on the quayside.Explosionsursache gekl√§rt. In: Hamburger Abendblatt. 24 February 1979. From here, the fire spread across a conveyor bridge through further smaller dust explosions along this bridge, which filled the upper storage area with flour dust. In this room another small explosion triggered the catastrophe, that also set the flour silo on fire.Deutsche Feuerwehr- Zeitung. Vol. 2.1980. The roof of the silo was blown off by the pressure wave, the walls collapsed, and the whole building was torn apart. Windows were broken in houses even a large distance away from the mill, and flour dust rained down across an area of about 30 hectares. 14 people died in the detonation, and 17 were seriously injured. The fire burned until 12 March 1979. The incident caused damage to a cost of about 100 million Deutsche Mark (about 206 million Euro today).Daniel M√ºnter: Mehlstaubexplosionen ‚Äì ein Funke gen√ºgt!

The mill is an important component of the harbour economy in Bremen, and is a major employer in its district. The majority of its production is exported. About 360,000 tons of grain were processed annually (2014) by the mill. 100 to 200 vessels lie directly by the silos.Die Senatorin f√ºr Finanzen: B√ºrgermeisterin Karoline Linnert auf Stadtteilbesuch im Bremer Westen.

Otis was a direct descendant of James Otis Jr.. William was a Massachusetts-born manufacturer who worked in Pittsburgh before traveled to Bloomfield, Trumbull County, Ohio, to start a primitive mercantile business and a tavern. In 1836, William moved to Cleveland to return to ironworks. Charles would follow his father in this line of work. William became a steamboat purser in 1848. Otis shipped wheat from Ohio to Buffalo, New York en route the Erie Canal. He manufactured high-quality flour and potash thirty- five miles to Ashtabula River, where it was loaded on a schooner and shipped to Buffalo and New York City. Career Otis Iron and Steel Company, ca. 1910 Otis established the Lake Erie Iron Company in 1852. He sold the business in 1866 when he decided to study ironworks in Prussia. The Otis Iron and Steel Company was established upon Otis' return in Industrial Valley. It was the first American company to solely manufacture acid open-hearth steel. Otis later founded American Wire Company, which became the American Steel and Wire Company, and was connected with the Standard Sewing Machine Company. He also founded the American Steel Screw Company, the Cleveland Electric Railway Company, and the Society for Savings. Otis worked with Dr. Everett and Samuel T. Wellman in the old East Cleveland line. It was said that Otis took a personal interest in his employees. Politics Otis was both a prominent industrial developer and municipal leader of Cleveland. The Democrats nominated him in his absence and without his knowledge, as their candidate for mayor by 1872. He defeated Standard Oil founder and Republican candidate, John Huntington. It was said that Otis' lack of consent for the nomination allowed him to show respectable individuality in his political career. On October 17, 1873, Ulysses S. Grant passed through the city. Gossip and a telegram reached Otis, who hitched a car on an engine; a reception committee, including the mayor, drove to Elyria within thirty-eight minutes. Grant's presidential train arrived to a city decorated with American flags. The group drove down Euclid Avenue to meet the President at Kennard House. In February, 1874, Otis visited Indianapolis, Indiana. Much like Cleveland, Indianapolis saw its growth in the last decades of the nineteenth-century. Otis toured the city for less than a month to see much of the early growth.Indianapolis Evening News. 12 Feb. 1874. Retrieved 14 Nov. 2017. Charles' brother, William H. Otis, was a prominent resident of Indianapolis. On March 19, 1874, forty members of the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WTC) marched on Ontario Street, Public Square, and YMCA. Assaults were made against the women in the eleventh ward on Lorain Avenue. The WTC returned to their protest on Garden Street on the following day. Mayor Otis ordered a sidewalk ordinance. Mayor Otis argued that the few who could afford to use the Cleveland Water Works \\"should aid in extending\\" the service to the rest of the city. Written on page xxi of the City Documents of 1874, Otis advocated a 33.3% increase in the cost of public waterworks, to fund construction. Otis left as mayor in the following year due to business reasons. His political career was described as very successful. His party gave him the nomination, but found that his business was too successful. The work took much of his attention, so he declined to seek reelection. Otis had a strong wish to serve the people. Otis became a member of the Board of Imprisonments in 1878. He served for one year. Otis became a member of the House of Correction Board in 1882 until 1884. He established Cleveland's first Board of Fire Commissioners and Board of Police Commissioners. Personal life Otis married Mary Shepard in 1853. The couple had two daughters, Anna and Nelly.

Many DCCGs are types of digital tabletop games and follow traditional card game-style rules, while some DCCGs use alternatives for cards and gameboards, such as icons, dice and avatars. Originally, DCCGs started out as replications of a CCG's physical counterpart, but many DCCGs have foregone a physical version and exclusively release as a video game, such as with Hearthstone. Gameplay These games manage all the rules of a CCG, such as tracking the avatar's health, removing damaged creatures from the board, and shuffling decks when necessary. The games are managed on servers to maintain the player's library and any purchases of booster packs and additional cards through either in-game or real-world money. Some games, like Chaotic, Bella Sara, and MapleStory allow online players to enter a unique alpha-numeric code found on each physical card as to redeem the card in the online version or access other features. In other cases, primarily single player games based on the existing physical property have also been made, such as the Game Boy Color version of the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game and Magic: The Gathering ‚Äì Duels of the Planeswalkers. History  1980s-90s Prior to DCCGs, video games had used both card-based mechanics (such as Dragon Ball: Daima≈ç Fukkatsu (1988)) and collection-based mechanics (such as Megami Tensei (1987), Dragon Quest V (1992) and Pok√©mon (1996), all based on collecting monsters). The Super Famicom card-battle/role-playing game Dragon Ball Z: Super Saiya Densetsu (1992), based on the Dragon Ball Carddass series, is considered an early precursor to the DCCG, as it allowed the player collect, buy and sells cards within the game for use in card battles. Tabletop-based CCGs came about in 1993 with Magic: The Gathering by Wizards of the Coast which became a phenomenon that year in the traditional game market. The CCG craze grew in 1994 onward as a result. This was also approximately the same time that widespread availability of the Internet was launched. DCCGs evolved out of the ability for CCG players to challenge each other online rather than in person, as well as to provide computerized opponents so that players could play these CCGs by themselves. The first DCCG games eventually appeared in the late 1990s. Early examples of DCCG games include Magic: The Gathering (1997), Chron X (1997), Pok√©mon Trading Card Game (1998), Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters (1998), and Sanctum (1998). Magic: The Gathering and Pok√©mon Trading Card Game were based on their physical CCG counterparts, Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters was based on the fictional CCG from the manga Yu-Gi-Oh! (1996), and Chron X and Sanctum were original DCCG games with no physical CCG counterpart. There have been CCGs developed solely for computer play and not based on any physical product. The first online CCGs were Sanctum and Chron X, both developed in 1997. Sanctum was taken offline in 2010, but has since returned due to fan intervention; Chron X still exists, producing new expansions over a decade later. Chron X was developed by Genetic Anomalies, Inc, which later developed other DCCG-like games based on licensed content.  2000s: Growth in Japanese market DCCG games first gained mainstream success in Japan, where online card battle games are a common genre of free- to-play browser games and mobile games. Monster-collecting Japanese RPGs such as Dragon Quest V and Pok√©mon, and the manga Yu-Gi-Oh, were adapted into successful physical CCG games such as Pok√©mon Trading Card Game and Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game, which in turn inspired a number of Japanese developers to produce digital CCG games, including adaptations such as Pok√©mon Trading Card Game and Yu-Gi-Oh! video games, as well as original DCCG games such as the minigame Triple Triad in Final Fantasy VIII (1999), Tetra Master (2002) which debuted as a minigame in Final Fantasy IX (2000) before becoming an online multiplayer game for the PlayOnline service, and Mega Man Battle Chip Challenge (2003). Within the United States, Wizards of the Coast had seen the success of games like Chron X and Sanctum, and initially with the help of a small development firm Leaping Lizard, built out Magic: The Gathering Online (MTGO), an online multiplayer client for Magic first released in 2002 which players could spend money and win games to build out card collections. MTGO had a number of growing pains over the years, but remains an active service that is used as one point for entry for several of the main live Magic: The Gathering tournaments. In Japan, CCGs that are played on arcade game machines with physical card sets came into vogue in the early 2000s, which provided a boost to arcade profits and have been a mainstay in many game centers since. Arcade games of this type have been developed by companies such as Sega, Square Enix and Taito, and are most commonly of the real-time strategy or sports management genres, with some diversion into action RPGs. Players can purchase starter decks for most games separately, and after each play session, the machines will commonly dispense more cards for players to expand their decks.http://gameroomblog.com/guides/a-look-into-the-crazy-thriving-japanese- arcade-scene Examples include World Club Champion Football (2002), Mushiking: The King of Beetles (2003), Oshare Majo: Love and Berry (2004), Dinosaur King (2005), Sangokushi Taisen (2005), Dragon Quest: Monster Battle Road (2007), and Lord of Vermilion (2008). Related, many video games have adopted CCG-type mechanics as part of a larger gameplay mechanism. In such games, the player earns cards as rewards in the game, often following similar rarity systems for distribution, and can customize some type of deck which influences other areas of the game's mechanics. Early example of this hybrid game include Phantasy Star Online Episode III: C.A.R.D. Revolution (2003), Baten Kaitos (2003), and Metal Gear Acid (2004). Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories (2004) was a role- playing game where the combat mechanic was based on attacks pulled from a deck of cards constructed outside of the combat rounds. Similarly, Phantom Dust (2004) was a third-person shooter, but where the player's attack and defense abilities were randomly selected from a customized \\"arsenal\\" of powers that they collected through the course of the game. Other examples of CCG-hybrid games include Forced: Showdown, Hand of Fate, and Card Hunter. The success of Cygames' Rage of Bahamut established DCCG games as a popular genre in mobile gaming, leading to a number of DCCG games being developed for mobile devices. It was also the first DCCG game to become a major success in the Western world, becoming one of the top-grossing mobile games of 2012. DCCG games with significant populations of players include The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls, Kantai Collection and Million Arthur. In late 2012, Cinderella Girls was earning over one billion yen in revenue monthly, whilst Kantai Collection has grown to more than one million players throughout Japan.2013-10-10, ÊèêÁù£100‰∏á‰∫∫Á™ÅÁ†¥„ÄÅ„Åù„Åó„Å¶Â≥∂Áî∞„Éï„Éü„Ç´„ÉçÊ∞è„Å´„Çà„ÇãËà™Á©∫ÊØçËâ¶„ÇÇÂÆüË£ÖÊ±∫ÂÆöÔºÅ ‚îÄ „ÄéËâ¶„Åì„Çå„ÄèÁßã„ÅÆ„Ç§„Éô„É≥„Éà„ÇÇÂÆüÊñΩÊ∫ñÂÇô‰∏≠, „Ç§„É≥„Çµ„Ç§„Éâ Unofficial ways to play some digital versions of CCGs also exist, such as brand specific programs like Magic Workstation. The bulk of DCCG programs however are not specific to any brand, such as LackeyCCG and Gccg or general game simulators like Tabletop Simulator, though the legality of these systems relative to the CCG's copyright is dubious. Such systems are often used to play copyrighted games whose manufacturers are no longer publishing the game, most notably Decipher's Star Wars Customizable Card GameDECIPHER.com : Star Wars CCG and Precedence‚Äôs Babylon 5 Collectible Card Game. Most of these systems do not have the CCG's ruleset programmed into the game, and instead require players to perform the necessary actions as required by the physical game's rules.  2014-: Hearthstone vs. MTG Arena Blizzard Entertainment released Hearthstone in 2014. Loosely based on the World of Warcraft CCG, Hearthstone features one-on-one match between players with custom made decks, built from a player's collection of digital cards. The game was designed to eliminate reactions by the opposing player during your turn to speed up the game and allow it to be played across a variety of devices. By 2015, Hearthstone had an estimated $20 million in revenues per month, and by April 2016, had more than 50 million unique players. Hearthstones success led to a number of similar digital-only CCGs in the following years. Wizards of the Coast announced in early 2017 that they plan to create a new studio to adapt the Magic: The Gathering game into a digital format similar to Hearthstone. Titled Magic: The Gathering Arena, it entered closed beta testing in early 2018, and over time is expected to replace MTGO as the main online game for Magic tournament play. The digital card game market was expected to be as large as $1.4 billion in 2017, according to market analysis firm SuperData. Hearthstone encouraged the release of the digital CCGs Gwent: The Witcher Card Game and The Elder Scrolls: Legends. Shadowverse has also been compared favorably with Hearthstone. In addition, there are several small, online CCGs run completely free by the card game creators and volunteer staff. These games at their most basic include a number of decks created for members to collect and trade. These cards are earned through games and contests at the CCG, with additional prize cards earned by collecting all cards in a deck (mastering) or completing a certain number of trades. Members typically visit each other's websites where they house their card collections, and propose trades to each other through forums or e-mail. In some cases, new elements are added to the digital CCG to improve the experience that cannot be recreated physically. The online card games Sanctum and Star Chamber include, e.g.: game boards, animations and sound effects for some of their cards. The NOKs, on the other hand, offer talking figures and action-arcade game play. In a different case, The Eye of Judgment, a CCG that has been combined with a PlayStation 3 game, bringing innovation with the CyberCode matrix technology. It allows real cards bought in stores to be scanned with the PlayStation Eye and brought into the game with 3D creatures, animations, spell animations, etc. as representations. Hearthstone uses mechanics that would be difficult or impossible to recreate in a physical setting, such as cards that allow players to draw a random card from the entire card library currently supported by the game. Valve's Artifact is heavily based on their multiplayer online battle arena game Dota 2, and thus features three boards (called \\"lanes\\") instead of the usual one. Impact With the growth of mobile gaming and streaming viewerships, digital card games are a significant part of the video game market. SuperData estimated that digital card games will bring over in 2018, with a quarter of that from Hearthstone, and the potential to grow to by 2020.

It was located where California Lutheran University (CLU) sits today and surrounding areas. The colony stretched from Mount Clef Ridge on the north and nearly to today's Avenida de Los Arboles on the south. It was from Moorpark Road on the east for one mile, and on the west, the western boundaries of California Lutheran University.Begun, Miriam and Ruthanne Sprankling (2009). Ladies of The Conejo.

Early history The lack of land and food in the fjords of western Norway forced many Norwegians to emigrate overseas during the late 19th- and early 20th century. Most of the Norwegians that ended up leaving for Thousand Oaks were from the small village of Stranda by Storfjorden. Several families followed when Lars Berge left for Santa Barbara in 1885.Begun, Miriam and Ruthanne Sprankling (2009). Ladies of The Conejo. Conejo Valley Historical Society. Page 49. . The Norwegian Colony began in the year of 1890, when five Norwegian families bought five tracts in the northern portion of Conejo Valley. They had been living in Santa Barbara for a few years, and was looking for cheap farm land. They originally wanted to buy land on Colonia Rancho, but the real estate was too expensive and three times the cost of land in Conejo Valley. They originally bought a total of of uncultivated land from George Edwards.Maulhardt, Jeffrey Wayne (2010). Conejo Valley. Arcadia Publishing. Page 8. . They reportedly paid $3 per acre for flatlands, and $2 for hillsides. Ole Andersen bought , Lars Pedersen bought , Nils Olsen , Ole Nilsen , and George Hansen bought .

Norwegian Grade Maybe the most notable contribution of the Norwegian Colony was the hand-made Norwegian Grade. The Norwegians were farmers who were dependent on hauling their cattle and dry crops such as barley and wheat to Port Hueneme, Simi Valley and Moorpark. Their only routes to Port Hueneme were the out-of-the-way, treacherous Potrero- and Conejo Grades in Newbury Park. After George Hansen was badly injured at Potrero Grade, and in bed for a year because of injuries, the colony took the initiative to create their own road to the Santa Rosa Valley. They asked Ventura County for help, and was given a $60 donation to buy dynamite.O'Brien, Tricia (2017). Thousand Oaks and Westlake Village. Arcadia Publishing. Page 80. . The one-mile Norwegian Grade was completed in 1911. While it previously took residents of Conejo Valley two days to reach Port Hueneme by Potrero Grade, the steep Norwegian Grade had reduced the travel time by a full day.Schroeder, Anne (2000).

Reactions In a statement from Disney lawyer and senior executive, Alan Braverman, said: \\"ACE will help protect the viability of [Disney] and ensure audiences continue to enjoy the high-quality content they have come to expect ... It enhances our collective efforts to retain profitability by disrupting the extralegal enterprises that profit from the distribution of copyrighted content, while promoting the legal market for that content.\\" Netflix lawyer David Hyman commented: \\"[ACE is] providing a great consumer experience that ultimately discourages piracy\\", adding that \\"executives of copyright holders are still bad players around the world trying to profit off the hard work of others. By joining ACE, we will work together, share knowledge, and leverage the group‚Äôs combined anti-piracy resources to address the problem of the free distribution of content\\". Jonathan Anschell, another executive and lawyer, of CBS, commented on the coalition: \\"In this golden age of profit it‚Äôs more important than ever that we remain vigilant about copyright protection ...

He was a publisher, epigrammatist, and long-time resident of Carmel Valley, California. Early life George Faunce Whitcomb was born on December 1, 1893, in Roxbury, Massachusetts. He was the son of Harlan Page Whitcomb and Emily Crockett Faunce. Whitcomb attended Roxbury College in Roxbury, Massachusetts. He attended Harvard University from 1912-14. After graduation, Whitcomb spent two years in Seattle, Washington and one year in San Diego, California, in the real estate business. On June 21, 1917, Whitcomb married Mary Louise Robinson at her family home in Seattle, Washington. She was the daughter of James Templeton Robinson. They had one child, Emily Faunce Whitcomb, born June 28, 1918. On April 1, 1920, Whitcomb offered a sterling silver medal in honor of his mother, to the undergraduate who has written the best poem published during the current year in the Harvard Advocate. The name of the medal was the Emily C Whitcomb Medal. The judges were the Editors and Mr. Whitcomb. On January 19, 1924, the Coronado Eagle and Journal reported: \\"Eastern Poet May Make Home In Coronado.\\" Whitcomb used to be associated with David Charles Collier in 1914 from San Diego, California. The article prints two selections from Eagle Quills and Jewels Of Romance.Coronado Eagle and Journal, Volume XII, Number 37, January 19, 1924 Military Then on April 23, 1918, Whitcomb enlisted as a private in the U. S. Army during World War I at Fort Holabird in Maryland and was transferred to the Motor Transport Corps on October 9, 1918. He was promoted to First Sergeant, Co. A., in the Motor Repair Unit. He was a Red Cross representative and was in charge of outfitting, training, and drilling all the units from Holabird before being sent overseas. Whitcomb was a drum major of the sixty-piece Holabird Band, which gave concerts in Baltimore and neighboring cities. He was also assistant to the camp Chaplain and helped start the Liberty Loan drives in the army camp and in the city of Baltimore, by reading some of his war poetry from a soap box on the street corners. Whitcomb was discharged on February 21, 1919, at Camp Holabird, Maryland. In 1942, Whitcomb registered for a United States World War II Draft Registration Card in Norfolk, Quincy, Massachusetts.United States World War II Draft Registration Cards, 1942,\\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:V128-G3G : 8 April 2016), George Faunce Whitcomb, 1942; citing NARA microfilm publication M1936, M1937, M1939, M1951, M1962, M1964, M1986, M2090, and M2097 (Washington D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, n.d.)

He once said: One of his first publications were editorials and poems written for the weekly Holabird Spark and poems for the Seattle Town Crier a weekly paper.  Eagle Quills  On September 22, 1919, Whitcomb wrote his first book of poems. The Harvard Advocate wrote the following review about Eagle Quills: \\"Whitcomb, who was a member of the class of 1916, has covered a large field in securing his inspiration. The first poems in his book, those that deal almost exclusively with incidents and emotions engendered by the war, show a firmer and more mature handling than do those that follow. While the material of all the poems can hardly be called original, nevertheless it is treated in a manner certainly not trite and for this reason the meagerness of the last few verses is to be regretted.\\" On January 11, 1920, The Buffalo Courier wrote: \\"EAGLE QUILLS is a book of poems by George Faunce Whitcomb, and which comes from the Cornhill company, Boston Mass. Short opems, sonnets and quatrains of varying theme and moods, and possessing a certain charm are offered for the reader's entertainment and show the author to be retrospective and serene in style and expression without stiring any particular depths. The Churchill Company, Boston, Masss.\\"Buffalo Courier, Sunday, January 11, 1920.  Jewels Of Romance  In 1922, Whitcomb wrote his second book, Jewels Of Romance, which was a limited edition of 150 copies. This classic book has been republished by Leopold Classic Library. On January 9, 1924, Mr. Whitcomb was quoted in the Coronado Eagleand JournalCoronado Eagle and Journal 19 January 1924 as saying:  Serpent's Credo  In 1931, Whitcomb wrote his third book of epigrams, Serpent's Credo with a pencil sketch by illustrator Wesley Dennis and forward by biographer and essayist Gamaliel Bradford. In The Editor; The Journal of Information for Literary Workers, the author says: An unusual dedication may be found in George F. \\"Whitcomb's Serpent's Credo\\": \\"I dedicate this book to myself, there being no other whom I would care to embarrass with so precarious an homage.\\"The Editor; The Journal of Information for Literary Workers, Volumes 92-95, 1931  Later years  Whitcomb and Marion Boisot Whitcomb divorced his first wife on November 15, 1927, in Seattle. In 1946, he married Marion Boisot Ernest in San Francisco, the daughter of Emile Kellogg Boisot. They later moved to Los Angeles and frequented Marion's ranch in Carmel Valley, California. On November 16, 1951, The Carmel Spectator printed a Prayer For Thanksgiving written by George Faunce Whitcomb. Whitcomb was a member of the Washington Lodge of Free Masons, Scottish Rite Masons at the Boston Masonic Temple, and Boston Masonic Club. Death On October 12, 1969, at age 75, Whitcomb died at Orange, California. He is buried at the Los Angeles National Cemetery.

His largely French army was reduced, in the words of Dante, to a \\"bloody heap\\" (sanguinoso mucchio). The scene depicted here is from a fresco by Giovanni Battista Marchetti (1763). Jean d'Eppe (c.1240 ‚Äì 12 November 1293), known in Italian as Giovanni d'Appia, was a French nobleman who served the Angevin dynasty of the Kingdom of Sicily and the Papal State as a military commander and administrator. He was heavily involved in the conflict between Guelphs, supporters of the Angevin claim to Sicily and of Papal claims in northern Italy, and the Ghibellines, supporters of the Staufer dynasty's claim to Sicily and of Imperial rights in northern Italy. Jean did not arrive in Sicily until the early 1270s, but he quickly acquired land and castles. Between 1274 and 1281, he served the Sicilian crown as a diplomatic and judicial agent before he was loaned out to the Papacy. Through a series of military campaigns in 1281‚Äì83, Jean helped secure Papal control over the Romagna and Maritime Campania. In 1284, he returned to Sicily to assist the Angevins in the War of the Sicilian Vespers against the Aragonese, who were taking up the Staufer claim. He appears to have retired from public activities in 1285, but he returned to an active role in 1289. In 1292, he resigned abruptly and returned to France. Nothing is known of his last year, save that he died in his native village. Move to Sicily Jean was the second son of Guillaume, lord of the village of Eppes in northern France. His older brother, Laurent, inherited the lordship from their father. In 1270, Jean joined the Eighth Crusade being organized by King Louis IX against Hafsid Tunisia. It was probably during the crusade that Jean first met Louis IX's brother, King Charles I of Sicily. By 1274 he had settled in Charles' kingdom along with his younger brother Pierre. It is unknown when between 1270 and 1274 Jean moved to the Kingdom of Sicily, but by 1274 he had already acquired several royal fiefs. In the Terra di Lavoro on the mainland, he had been given the fiefs of Ambrisio, Castrocielo, Pescosolido and Vallecorsa and the royal castle of San Giovanni Incarico. It seems that former holders of some of these fiefs did not relinquish them willingly to Jean, since on 23 August 1275 Charles I had to issue orders to the justiciar of Terra di Lavoro to investigate the illegal retention of fiefs. In the Principato, also on the mainland, Jean held the fief of Campagna. All these fiefs earned him a total revenue of 160 oncie per year. Angevin agent The first indication of Jean acting as an agent of the central government comes from August 1274. He and Raynald de Poncel conducted an investigation into the right of pasturage in the lands of Buccino that was claimed by the villagers of nearby Castel San Giorgio. Buccino and its castle were at that time a fief held by Gautier de Sommereuse. In May 1279, Jean d'Eppe and Jean Toursevache were sent on a secret mission to France. Although the sources do not reveal the nature of this mission, it was probably to the court of Charles I's son and heir, Charles of Salerno, then acting as his father's vicar in the County of Provence. The two Jeans may have been arranging for the younger Charles to mediate in the ongoing war between France and Castile over Navarre. Charles I was still holding the king of Castile's brother, Henry, a prisoner. In 1281, Charles of Salerno's son, Charles Martel, the third in line to the Sicilian throne, married Clemence, daughter of King Rudolf I of Germany. Jean was a member of the escort that received Clemence in Orvieto on 22 March to conduct her back to Sicily. The party remained in Orvieto for some weeks, and were joined in April by the king of Sicily, the groom's grandfather. Orvieto had recently become the centre of the Papal court, since the Romans refused to accept the election of a pro-Angevin pope. The recently elected Martin IV was widely considered an Angevin puppet. He was crowned pope in Orvieto on 23 March, with Jean d'Eppe in attendance. On 24 March, acting on the advice of the king of Sicily, Martin appointed Jean as his rector in temporalibus (i.e., secular governor) in the Papal lands of the Romagna. On 26 March, he was granted supreme military command in the Romagna as well, with the ranks of master of the army (magister exercitus) and captain-general and the title Count of Romagna (comes Romandiolae).Augusto Vasina, \\"Giovanni d'Appia\\", Enciclopedia Dantesca (Rome: 1970). Papal rector of the Romagna Campaign of 1281 Jean's first task as Papal rector was to subdue the strongholds of Forl√¨ and Cesena, which were being defended by Guido da Montefeltro. To cover his personal expenses, Charles I authorized him to impose an extraordinary tax on his vassals in the Sicilian kingdom. By 6 June 1281, Jean had assembled an army of 3,400 at Bologna. This included 800 men from France. The rest were drawn from the Papal State and from the Guelph parties in Tuscany and the March of Ancona. The Guelphs of Romagna under Taddeo da Montefeltro were also represented. Entering the Romagna, he took Faenza by bribing the local commander, Tebaldello Zambrasi. He also received the support of the lords of Modigliana and Castrocaro. Following these quick successes, Jean sent messages to the city of Forl√¨, ordering them to throw out Guido and his supporters, and to Guido, offering to let him go if he would promise to leave the Romagna. These messages were ignored and Jean marched on Forl√¨. He camped at Villanova just outside the city and plundered the countryside from 22 until 27 June. He made several attempts to take the city by force, but all failed and he suffered such severe losses that he brought the entire army back to Faenza. Joined by Archbishop Bonifacio Fieschi of Ravenna and Guido da Polenta, lord of Ravenna, he then attacked the castle of Traversara. It resisted and on 8 July the army retreated again.John Larner, The Lords of Romagna: Romagnol Society and the Origins of the Signorie (Palgrave Macmillan, 1965), p. 51, reports the castle destroyed. Following these failures, Jean asked Charles of Anjou to intervene with Martin IV to get him released from his command. Charles refused. On 4 September, he again attacked Forl√¨. On 16 September, Martin ordered Malatesta da Verucchio, lord of Rimini, to submit to Jean's authority and send him military reinforcements. On 17 September, Jean's troops plundered the villages of San Martino in Strada and Ponte di Ronco. Forl√¨ continued to hold out against attack and on 19 September, Jean retreated again. On 2 October, Martin ordered him to reduce his troops to the level necessary only for defending his gains. Before this was done, Jean launched one last unsuccessful attack on Forl√¨ on 18 October. Following this, the infantry was sent back to Bologna, while cavalry was used to plunder of the suburbs of Cesena before the onset of winter. In a letter of 29 October, the pope congratulated Jean on his great \\"victory\\" at Cesena. Campaign of 1282 The castle of Meldola was besieged by Jean d'Eppe from August to November 1282. In early 1282, Jean d'Eppe assembled a new army at Bologna composed of 1,700 Frenchmen sent by Charles of Anjou, 1,300 Bolognese and 500 soldiers from the Papal State. The French troops, however, made excessive demands on the Papal finances and the pope asked Charles to recall them on 3 March. On 16 March, the pope excommunicated Guido da Montefeltro and the other Ghibelline leaders in the Romagna. For this second campaign, Guido's cousin, Taddeo da Montefeltro, was Jean's captain-general.Larner, Lords of Romagna, pp. 46‚Äì47. On 30 April, some conspirators in Forl√¨ offered to turn the city over to Jean, who immediately marched his men from Faenza to Forl√¨. Arriving the following day, he found that the conspiracy had been uncovered and the traitors arrested. Nonetheless, Jean launched an assault on the city. The main troops easily breached the outer wall. While they plundered the suburbs, Guido sent a small force out a gate on the opposite side of the city. In an ambush, this force overcame Jean's rearguard and surprised the main force. After a bloody battle, Jean was forced to retreat to Faenza. The defeat at Forl√¨ (1 May 1282), coming just a month after the Sicilian Vespers (30 March), was a great blow to Guelph morale. It was Jean's first defeat in the field (his other defeats having come against city walls). In response, he sent letters to the pope, to King Charles and to King Philip III of France requesting more troops. Charles, for his part, asked the pope to release his troops from Jean's army and send them to Sicily, where Charles needed them. The pope, however, refused. Reinforced, Jean besieged the castle of Meldola to the south of Forl√¨ on 6 August. The goal of the siege of Meldola was to cut off Forl√¨ from its supplies, but Jean was unable to cut off Meldola from being resupplied from Forl√¨. In late November he called off the siege and on 9 December the pope ordered him to reduce his troops to just 300 Frenchmen and 200 Italians. The second campaigning season had ended in failure. Parliament of 1283 At the start of 1283, Jean adopted a different approach to reducing Ghibelline resistance in the Romagna. In February, he convoked a general parliament of the province at Imola. There, in the presence of the spiritual rector (rector in spritualibus), Guillaume Durand, and other provincial magnates, he promulgated a new provincial constitution of forty articles, the Constitutiones Romandiole, on 13 February. This document was apparently drafted in haste and without Papal approval. On 11 March, Martin IV removed Jean from his post and, on 23 March, he invalidated the parliament and the Constitutiones. Jean's successor as rector was Guy de Montfort, who had already been acting as Jean's captain-general. The Constitutiones, which were Jean's initiative, guaranteed all the immunities and liberties of the church, exempted all clergy from taxation, nullified all oaths of vassallage sworn to cities in rebellion (like Cesena and Forl√¨) and forbade anyone from trading or contracting with rebels. They also dealt with criminal prosecutions and appeals. They had an immediate effect on the Ghibelline opposition. In March, the city of Cervia surrendered, paid an indemnity of 1,600 florins and had its castle razed. Jean was still at the head of troops, awaiting the arrival of his replacement, when Forl√¨ surrendered on 28 May. Its fortifications were razed. In June, Jean accepted the surrender of Cesena. His ultimate success as rector came not from his military ability but from his skillful political and diplomatic isolation of his opponents. The city of Forl√¨ was under intermittent siege from 1281 until 1283. Dante Alighieri in his Inferno made an oblique reference to it as la terra che f√© gi√† la lunga prova / e di Franceschi sanguinoso mucchio (\\"the city that underwent the long trial and made a bloody heap of the French\\").From the translation of Robert M. Durling, The Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri, Volume 1: Inferno (Oxford University Press, 1996), p. 419. Dante does not name the French leader (Jean), and although he places Guido da Montefeltro in the eighth bolgia of Hell, he was opposed to the French influence over the Papacy that came to a head under Martin IV. Captain-General in Maritime Campania On 27 June 1283, perhaps surprised by Jean's victories after his dismissal, Martin IV appointed him rector in temporalibus of the city of Urbino and its diocese. Whether he ever took up his post in Urbino is unknown. In the spring, Charles of Anjou, now fighting an Aragonese invasion of Calabria, had requested that his troops in Jean's service be returned to him. Martin IV ignored this request until the Romagna was securely pacified. On 13 September 1283, he finally granted Jean permission to go with his men to the defence of Calabria. He quickly changed his mind, however. On 23 October 1283, he appointed Jean captain-general of the Papal forces in Maritime Campania. Jean's task was to subdue the city of Frosinone, which had elected its own rector, Adinolfo di Mattia d'Anagni, to a term of twenty-five years without Papal approval. On 7 November, the syndics of the city surrendered. Before the end of the year, Jean had destroyed Adinolfo's main castle at Montelanico. In early March 1284, the last stronghold of Adinolfo's supporters, Zancati, surrendered. Jean had probably wrapped up campaigning by the start of May. War of the Vespers Under Charles I On 5 May 1284, Martin IV granted Jean his permission (placet) to take his troops into the Kingdom of Sicily. This is the last document to name Jean as captain-general in Maritime Campania. On 8 May, Charles of Salerno (acting as regent for his father since 12 January 1283) agreed to pay Jean's troops the same rates they had received from the Papacy. He also offered them three months' pay in advance. The army entered Sicily almost immediately, but as their advance was not forthcoming they turned around and were back in Maritime Campania by 16 May. Jean, however, as a vassal of the King of Sicily was called for service and he returned to Sicily on 18 May. Before leaving, he released his troops from service. Jean remained in Sicilian service until the death of Charles of Anjou released him on 7 January 1285. He had held high office during this period on account of the vacancies that had been created by the Aragonese defeat of the Angevins at the Battle of the Gulf of Naples (5 June 1284), where many men of high rank, including Charles of Salerno, had been taken as prisoner. Jean had returned to Papal service by February 1285. The death of Charles provided an opportunity for one of his old foes, Conrad of Antioch, a member of Staufer ruling house supported by Aragon, to invade the Abruzzo from Papal territory, where he held Anticoli. On 3 February 1285, Martin IV charged Jean d'Eppe, along with Giacomo Cantelmo and Amiel d'Agoult, the co-justiciars of the Abruzzo, with repelling Conrad's invasion. The details of the campaign are scarce, but before the end of the year Conrad had submitted to Martin's successor, Honorius IV. Under Charles II On the elder Charles's death, the younger Charles was still a prisoner of the Aragonese. Sicily was thus placed under the regency of Cardinal Gerardo Bianchi and Count Robert of Artois. There is no evidence that Jean worked for the regents in any capacity: his name does not once appear in an official document from this period. Only with the liberation of Charles of Salerno (now Charles II) in the spring of 1289 did Jean d'Eppe hold a public office again. On 27 August 1289, Charles appointed him and Anselme de Chevreuse in charge of arrangements for the knighting ceremony of the king's son, Charles Martel, which took place on 8 September. Charles II granted Jean the fiefs of Sarno and Roseto and named him Captain-General of the Principato. In this capacity, it was his job to defend the coast from attacks by the Aragonese fleet and almog√†ver raids. On 2 August 1290, while Charles II was visiting Provence, he was summoned by the regents, Robert of Artois and Charles Martel, to attend a parliament at Eboli on 25 August. They're a series of capitula et statuta super regimine regni (\\"articles and statutes for the governance of the kingdom\\") were enacted. Jean was removed from his post in the Principato, but on 26 September he was sent along with Raynaut Gaulart and Count Hugh of Brienne to collect the subventio generalis (general subvention) and the adhoamentum (feudal relief) in Apulia, and to investigate the behaviour of Apulian officials to ensure compliance with the new capitula et statuta. Jean was still overseeing the implementation of the decisions of the parliament of Eboli in Apulia during the first days of March 1291. On 7 March, however, he was ordered to transport 100 salme of grain from the house of the Knights Hospitaller in Barletta across the sea to Corfu. This done, on 16 April 1291, he was made Captain-General of the Terra di Lavoro and the Duchy of Amalfi. In this capacity, in the spring of 1292, he reinforced the garrisons of the castles under his command and brought their pay up to date, actions which required him to levy 120 oncie from the justiciar, Louis de Mons. In August 1292, he arranged an attack on Aragonese-occupied Castellabate, ultimately carried out by Tommaso di Sanseverino. Retirement and death Jean's last appearance in a Sicilian document is dated 10 August 1292. He was by that time the seneschal of the kingdom and still Captain-General of the Terra di Lavoro and Amalfi. Shortly, therefore, for reasons unknown, he returned to France. By 19 June 1293, he had been replaced as seneschal by one Jean Scot. He died in his native village on 12 November, as attested by his tombstone in the Abbey of Saint-Vincent de Laon. His son, also named Jean, succeeded him in his fiefs in the Kingdom of Sicily.Robert Wyard, Histoire de l'abbaye Saint Vincent √† Laon (Saint-Quentin: 1858), pp. 262‚Äì65. His lengthy Old French verse epitaph, now destroyed,D. A. Trotter, Medieval French Literature and the Crusades (1100‚Äì1300) (Geneva: Droz, 1987), p. 215. read in part: {  :En Puille fu il et en Tunes :Et en autres terres aucunes, :Par sa force grand nom acquit, :En Calabre moult d'armes fit, :Et en Abrusse et en Romaine :Pour l'amour Diu souffrit grant paine; :Et ses faits qui tous les diroit :A recorder trop long seroit ...  :In Apulia he was and in Tunis :And in other lands, :By force he acquired a great name, :In Calabria many feats of arms he did, :And in Abruzzo and Romagna :For the love of God he suffered great pain; :And his feats all would say :To record would take too long ... } The epitaph goes on to compare Jean favourably with Roland and Oliver, heroes of the Matter of France. The necrology of the abbey indicates by his title, \\"lord of Eppes\\" (dominus de Appia), that he succeeded his brother at some point. He left 21 livres to the abbey for a mass to be sung on the anniversary of his death and 40 livres for an annual mass for both him and his father to be sung \\"in low voice\\" (submissa voce).

The newly created Tenth Circuit consisted of California and Oregon, and addressed the judicial needs of the newly-created western states. The Act became effective on March 3, 1863, during the Lincoln administration.  History  Stephen Johnson Field was the first Justice appointed to the newly created tenth seat. The period of the American Civil War and the immediate aftermath of Reconstruction saw shakeups in the Court and in legislation concerning its size. This culminated in the Judiciary Act of 1869, the last piece of legislation which altered the size of the Supreme Court. Pursuant to the Tenth Circuit 1863 Act, Stephen Johnson Field was installed in the newly created Associate Justice seat. Shortly thereafter, Salmon P. Chase replaced Roger B. Taney as Chief Justice of the United States, and in 1865 Associate Justice John Catron died; Catron's vacancy would never be refilled as a consequence of the Judicial Circuits Act of 1866. Later Supreme Court vacancies in the coming years would be addressed by the 1869 Act, which permanently fixed the size of the Supreme Court at nine. The Court's full-strength size of ten was therefore a very brief historical aberration, straddling the end of the Taney Court (its final composition) and the beginning of the Chase Court (its first composition). This \\"court of ten\\" thus experienced the following changes. First, Field was appointed to its tenth seat, creating its first composition. Next, Taney died and was replaced with Chase, creating its second composition. Finally, Catron's death and his seat's subsequent abolition ended the \\"court of ten\\".

The first iteration (the \\"Chapters\\" series) released in Japan in 2012 but never released outside Japan and was discontinued in order to release a second iteration (the \\"Opus\\" series) worldwide in October 2016. Each player uses a deck of 50 cards, with no more than 3 copies of the same card. Players play cards by spending Crystal Points, earned by \\"dulling\\" (turning from vertical to horizontal) Backup cards, or by discarding cards. The game features a wide range of Characters from games in the Final Fantasy series. The game has a global tournament circuit. As of September 2016, the game had sold more than 3.5 million booster packs in Japan and 5.5 million packs worldwide as of July 2017. Gameplay Setup Players build a deck of exactly 50 cards with no more than 3 copies of the same card. At the start of the game, each player shuffles their deck and places it in their deck zone. Each player then draws 5 cards. A player may mulligan once by placing the 5 original cards on the bottom of their deck in any order then drawing 5 new cards. A random method is used to determine who chooses the starting player. The player who goes first draws one card on the first turn, but every turn after that the turn player draws 2 cards. How to play Players play other cards by spending Crystal Points (CP). Crystal Points are gained by Dulling (turning a card sideways) a Backup card, which will provide one Crystal Point of its Element type, or by discarding a card from the player's hand, which will provide two Crystal Points of its Element type. To successfully play a card, the player must pay the CP cost with at least 1 CP belonging to its Element type. Example: A Fire card with a cost of 5 CP requires one Fire CP and four CP of any type. Light and Dark Element type cards do not have this restriction and any CP can be used to play these cards, however they cannot be discarded for CP. Cards in play can either be active (vertical) or dull (horizontal) and often switch between the two, including at the start of each turn when all of the turn player's cards become active. The primary goal of the game is to deal 7 damage to the opposing player. Players play Characters including Forwards which can attack the opponent during the owner's Attack Phase as long as they're active and have been in play since the beginning of the turn. When a Forward attacks, the non-turn player may declare a block with one of their own active Forwards. When Forwards battle, they deal damage to each other equal to their power value. A Forward with equal or more damage than its own power is broken and put into its owner's Break Zone. If an attacking Forward isn't blocked, it deals one damage to the defending player. When a player is dealt damage, they put 1 card per damage from the top of their deck face-up into their Damage Zone. When a Damage Zone has seven cards in it, that player loses the game. To play a card or ability, a player announces the card or ability and any targets it has and pays the CP cost. Either player can respond to an effect before it resolves using the \\"stack\\". If both players consecutively \\"pass priority\\" (choose not to add another effect to the stack), the top effect on the stack resolves (the most recent one added) then players may once again add effects to the stack. The process continues until both players consecutively pass while the stack is empty, in which case the next phase of the turn begins. Every turn moves through 6 phases sequentially; the Active Phase, Draw Phase, Main Phase 1, Attack Phase, Main Phase 2 and End Phase. Character cards (Forwards, Backups and Monsters) can only be played by the turn player during their own Main Phase 1 or 2 while the stack is empty. Summons and Action/Special Abilities of Characters can be added to the stack any time the owner has priority. During the End Phase, if the turn player has more than 5 cards in their hand, they must discard cards until they have 5. How to win The game ends when a player fulfills a losing condition. Three conditions exist: Have 7 cards in the Damage Zone, attempt to draw from an empty deck, or receive damage while the deck is empty. Card information Card name and ID The card name is written in a frame at the top of the card. A player may only have one Character with that name on their side of the field unless the Character has the multi-unit icon in the top right-hand corner. The top right-hand corner might also have an EX icon which means its first ability (for Characters) or the entire effect (for Summons) can trigger when the card is placed into the Damage Zone. The ID of the card is written at the bottom of the card. A deck may contain at most 3 cards with the same ID. Cost The cost of a card is indicated by the number in the top left-hand corner. It indicates how many CP are needed to play the card. Element The element of a card is given by the color of the crystal in the top left-hand corner, by the background color of the card text, and by the element symbol in the background of the text. The eight elements are: fire, ice, wind, earth, lightning, water, light, and dark. Type, job, and category The type of a card is given by a text on the left, as well as the shape of the top and left frames of the card; there are four types of card: * Forward: played active. A Forward may attack the opponent, or defend from the opponent's attacks. They often also have abilities. * Backup: played dull. An active Backup can be dulled to produce one CP of its element. They often also have abilities. * Monster: played active. Monsters can't inherently attack or defend but always have abilities. They can sometimes be treated as a Forward due to card effects (including their own in many cases). * Summon: can be cast during any main phase or attack phase. Summon is the only card type which isn't a Character. Summons go on the stack instead of entering the field and are put into the Break Zone once they've resolved. The job of a Character is written in the center of the card, the category of a card is written on the right; job and category are grouping the cards under archetypes, to which abilities may refer. Text The card text describes different abilities a Character has, or a Summon's effects. There are four types of abilities for Characters: * Action abilities, which the owner can manually activate by paying the cost. * Auto-abilities, which automatically activate when a trigger occurs. * Special abilities, which function like Action Abilities but have a name and include in their cost discarding a Character with the same name as the one using its ability. * Field abilities, which usually apply a constant effect while the Character is in play (but may also include cost modification or restrictions on how the card can be played). Some effects have a special term called a \\"keyword\\". Keywords are usually Field Abilities although some describe other effects. The most common examples are: * Haste: This Forward can attack even if it hasn't been in play since its owner's Active Phase. This Forward or Backup can use an Action/Special Ability with the dull icon in its cost even if it hasn't been in play since its owner's Active Phase. * Brave: This Forward doesn't dull when it attacks. * First strike: During combat with another Forward, this Forward deals damage to the other Forward first instead of simultaneously. This means if the other Forward is broken due to the damage dealt, it won't deal damage back. * Back attack: This Character can be played during any Attack Phase or Main Phase, like a Summon. * Freeze: A state applied by many card effects, usually from the Ice element. If a Forward is Frozen, it won't activate during its owner's next Active Phase. Power Only printed on Forwards and Monsters with an effect that allows them to be treated as a Forward, the power is indicated in the bottom right-hand corner of the card. The power of a card is separate from the damage it takes: a card takes damage when attacking, defending, or due to an effect; while its power can only be raised or lowered by an effect. Development Square Enix contacted Tarou Kageyama of Hobby Japan about the creation of a trading card game. The time was fortunate, according to Kageyama, because Hobby Japan was at that time looking to develop a totally new trading card game. After four years, however, the game was starting to hit limitations, and the desire to have more players in a game, and to have the series expand to North America and Europe, so the series was remade and relaunched globally as ‚ÄúOpus I‚Äù. ‚ÄúOpus II‚Äù launched in October 2016 with a card set of 148 cards focused on Final Fantasy IV, Final Fantasy VIII, Final Fantasy XII, and Final Fantasy XIV. June 2017 was to focus on Final Fantasy IX; ‚ÄúFire and Water‚Äù, and Final Fantasy Type-0: ‚ÄúLightning and Wind‚Äú starter deck sets. Reception It was first released Japan in 2012 and in English in October 2016. Final Fantasy TCG has been noted for its quick and streamlined gameplay, however the game has been criticized for having very small card text that is hard to read. The game has been compared to Magic: the Gathering. The game has already generated a tournament circuit. As of September 2016, the game has sold more than 3.5 million booster packs in Japan and 5.5 million packs worldwide as of July 2017.

The purple shade has developed over a century. These are multi prisms; the ridges can be seen running vertically . Pavement lights (UK), vault lights (US), floor lights, or sidewalk prisms are flat-topped walk-on skylights, usually set into pavement (sidewalks) or floors to let sunlight into the space below. They often use anidolic lighting prisms to throw the light sideways under the building. They were developed in the 19th century, but declined in popularity with the advent of cheap electric lighting. Older cities and smaller centers around the world have or have had pavement lights. Most such lights are approximately a century old, although lights are being installed in some new construction.  Uses  Sidewalk prisms are a method of daylighting basements, and are able to serve as a sole source of illumination during the day. At night, lighting in the basements beneath produces a glowing sidewalk. Vault lights may be used to make subterranean space useful. They are more common in city centers, dense, high- rent areas where space is valuable. Historically, landlords took an interest in improving not only the floor area ratio, but the amount of space that was naturally lit, on the grounds that this was profitable. Occupiers valued daylight not only as a way of saving on artificial lighting costs (which were higher historically), but also as a way to let premises remain cooler in summer, and a way to save on ventilation costs (if using gas lighting rather than arc lamps or early incandescent lights). Pavement lights and related products were historically marketed as a way of saving on artificial lighting costs and making space more usable and pleasant. Modern studies of similar daylighting technology provide evidence for those claims. Vault lights also are used in floors under glass roofs, for example in Budapest's historic and New York's mostly-demolished old Pennsylvania Station . Vault lights also could be set into the basement floor, underneath other vault lights, creating a double-deck arrangement, which would light the subbasement. Manhole covers and coalhole covers with lighting elements were also made. Some steps have vault lights set into the vertical stair risers.  History  A basement that extends below a sidewalk or pavement is called an areaway, a sidewalk vault, or a hollow sidewalk. In some cities, these areaways were created by the raising of the street level to combat floods, and in some cases they form an (often now abandoned) tunnel network. To light these spaces, sidewalks incorporated gratings, which were a trip hazard and let water and street dirt as well as light into the basement. Replacing the open gratings with glass was an obvious improvement.  Frames  alt=A large circular glass lens with a flat top and a stepped domed bottom. The glass is purple, with the shade darkening towards the top. The glass is set in a wide and ornate circular frame engraved with a semi-geometric ring-of-roundels design that looks a bit Rockwell vault light, with one large piece of glass Sidewalk prisms developed from deck prisms, which were used to let light through the decks of ships. The earliest pavement light (Rockwell, 1834) used a single large round glass lens set in an iron frame. The large lens was directly exposed to traffic, and if the lens broke, a large hole was left in the pavement, which was potentially unsafe for pedestrians. Thaddeus Hyatt corrected these faults with his \\"Hyatt light\\" of 1854. Many small lenses (\\"bull's-eyes\\") were set in a wrought-iron frame, (later cast iron), and the frame included raised nubs around each lens to improve traction in wet weather and to protect them from damage and wear. Even if all the lenses were broken out, the panel would still be safe to walk on. In the 1930s, London authorities ruled that glass sections could not be larger than 100 mm by 100 mm. Modern glass floors are made of laminated and toughened glass pavers, which can be substantially larger. They have an upper protective layer that can be replaced if it becomes chipped or cracked. The top surface of the pavers may also be chosen and treated to improve traction. alt=A shallow square of glass, surrounded by a metal rim, set in Armoured glass in concrete Wrought iron, cast iron, and stainless steel frames have all been used. Reinforced concrete slabs began to replace iron frames in the 1890s in New York. Benefits claimed included less condensation (due to the lower thermal conductivity) and a less slippery surface when wet. Concrete panels may be pre-cast or cast in-situ. Late concrete panels often were made with metal-framed \\"armored prisms\\", which were intended to prevent breakage and make replacing individual prisms easier. The glass is not cast into the concrete but caulked into the frame. Rather than chiselling out the old glass, the glass can be popped out of the frame. Translucent concrete has also been proposed as a floor material. This would essentially make it a vault light with very small (fiberoptic) lighting elements. It also innately redirects the light from the angle of incidence to an angle ~parallel to the optical fibers (usually, perpendicular to the surface of the concrete).  Transparent elements  The transparent elements may be referred to as prisms or lenses (depending on shape), or as jewels. = Glass color = Solarized pendant prisms, showing a gradient in the solarization. The glass in many old pavement lights is now either purple or straw-colored. This is a side-effect of the manufacturing process. Pure silica glass is transparent, but older glass manufacture often used silica from sand, which contains iron and other impurities. Iron produces a greenish tint in the finished glass. To remove this effect, a \\"decolorizer\\" such as manganese dioxide (\\"glassmakers' soap\\") was added during the manufacture of the glass. When exposed to ultraviolet light, the manganese slowly \\"solarizes\\", turning purple, which is why many existing sidewalk prisms are now purple. WWI increased demand for manganese in the US and cut off the supply of high-grade ore from Germany, so selenium dioxide was used as a decolorizer instead. Selenium also solarizes, but to a straw color. Replacement glass that has been tinted purple deliberately, in order to match the current colour, has been used in some historic restoration projects. = Glass shape = In 1871 London, Hayward Brothers patented their \\"semi-prism\\": changing the shape of the glass by adding pendant prisms to the underside reflects the light sideways, allowing it to light the area under the main building. The pendant shapes were right-angle (\\"half\\") prisms, which reflected all incoming light sideways. The horizontal ridges protruding from the top of the prism let it be set into an opening in an iron or cement grating. Some cast glass pendant prisms have flat portions to shed light directly below, as well as throwing it sideways under the main body of the building (see image). Some prisms were made with multiple pendant prisms, either as a Fresnel-lens-like sheet of identical prisms (\\"multi\\") or a sheet of dissimilar prisms that could distribute the light (\\"three-way\\" etc.). The precise angles at which the prisms refracted or reflected light was important. An installation would generally consist of multiple different prescriptions of prism, chosen either by an on-site expert contractor or by a layman using standard algorithms. This also would diffuse the light somewhat, as would the rough glass surfaces (the lenses are translucent, not transparent). Larger castings are more expensive, not only because they use more glass, but because they take longer to cool. Modern glass floors use laminate sheet glass some centimeters (more than an inch) thick; it often is transparent. = Non-glass translucent materials = Synthetic resin composites (such as fiberglass), as well as plastics such as Lexan, have been proposed to replace missing prism lights. Translucent decking panels made of fiberglass are often used for balconies which would otherwise shade the windows below them. Peel-and-stick prism films recently have come on the market, with acrylic micro-prisms that internally reflect light somewhat like glass pendant prisms.  Structure  File:Lucidux daylighting.gifalt = Diagram of prisms in a pavement bending light to hit a wall of glass prims lying directly under and in line with the basement wall, which bend the light further to the horizontalTwo-stage refraction system for basement lighting; prism wall below center, shop above left. Note I-beam and masonry wall. File:Prism salesroom.gifalt = A brightly- lit room with the inside edge lined with carrell desks. The ceiling is made of pendant prisms, supported by a very unobtrusive frame (which is in turn supported at wide intervals by slender diagonal braces from the walls). The wall over the desks is made of prism tiles.The same system used to light a salesroom inside a hollow sidewalk; prism wall is on the right File:Daylit basement 112 state st.jpgalt=A black-and-white photo of an unfurnished basement, horizontally lit with diffuse light. It has a pale coffered ceiling, with thickish round pillars supporting the intersections of the beams. The lower half of both pillars and walls is covered with dark wood panelling. The bare floor is pale grey.A basement daylit by sidewalk prisms (prisms out-of- shot to the left) In some cases, a second vertical curtain of prisms was installed under the building sill. These were analogous to the prism transoms used over above-ground windows and doors. The light could be bent in two stages and used to daylight the whole basement. The areaway under a sidewalk light usually has a masonry wall separating it from the soil under the street, although it may extend partly under the street. Support for the vault light frames varies. Steel cross-beams supported by columns are common in older buildings; metal decks are common in newer ones.  Current state and trends   Manufacture, maintenance, and repair  Some modern pavement lights are quite different from historic ones, so restoration and replacement may use different techniques and parts. A few companies now manufacture and sell vault lights, either as glass-only, prefab panels, or installation. Construction methods and prices vary widely. Historically, glass lenses were standardized by each manufacturer; some modern manufacturers produce standardized prisms. Some firms also supply replacement glass castings to order. Cost varies greatly; shapes needing complicated articulated moulds are more expensive. Modern caulking materials are used for caulking in replacement glass. Broken and damaged frames can be patched, re-welded, or re-cast. Generally speaking, restoration requires only simple tools and technology. Promptly repairing sidewalk cracks, and avoiding de-icers that will corrode metal, helps keep the supporting structure dry and in good repair. Keeping a sidewalk light watertight does not cost much in time or materials. Vaults generally last many decades, and many extant vaults are more than a century old.  Reuse and preservation  Despite their reusability and repairability, old panels often are landfilled. However, the city of Victoria, Canada is stockpiling removed pavement light panels for future restoration projects. Often, individual broken sidewalk prisms are not replaced, but instead, the opening is filled with concrete or other opaque materials, such as metal, wood, and asphalt. When a building is renovated, vault lights may be removed or concreted over. For instance, the floor of New York's mostly-demolished old Pennsylvania Station was made of vault lights, to let light through the concourse floor onto the platforms. The undersides of the lights can still be seen, but the tops have been concreted over (see images).Photo, 2015 While some cities have preservation measures for vault lights, others actively remove them and fill areaways. Sometimes the outside appearance of the lights is retained while filling the areaway and setting the lights in a concrete pad, removing their daylighting function. Some areaways are \\"mothballed\\"; that is, filled with gravel that could later be removed. Areaways are used in some cities as a convenient place to run utilities, which may make the cities reluctant to give areaways legal protection. In some cases, utility construction leads to areaways being filled.  Load-bearing strength  The load-bearing strength of vault lights varies widely with span, construction, and state of repair. Some damaged vaults may not be able to support a fire engine, which a sidewalk vault in sound condition should be able to do. Many jurisdictions do not have regulations on the load-bearing capacity of pavement lights, and manufacturers may develop their own loading standards, in compliance with local fire department regulations. The load-bearing capacity of pavement lights can be tested, and lights can be designed and built to specific load-bearing capacities. Damp areaways may corrode the steel load-bearing elements supporting the pavement roof. Moisture may come from leakage from above or from groundwater from below.  Current installations  Restored vault lights being re-installed on Broadway in New York City *Amsterdam, The Netherlands, has vault lights, some of which have been documented by the Netherlands Department for Conservation. *Astoria, Oregon, has a community program for restoring vault lights, funded by the Astoria Downtown Historic District Association. A volunteer plan to replace broken glass with squares of Lexan, topped with resin embedded with glass teardrops, was prevented by legislation. *Budapest, Hungary, has vault lights in one of its tourist sites, the Art Deco-period mall on Ferenciek tere (Square of the Franciscans). The mall has unusual, decorative pavement lights let into its polychrome tile floor, to allow light from the glass dome skylights into the basement level. There also are vault lights in other locations, such as in the old post office building. *Chicago, Illinois, has extremely extensive sidewalk vaults, but many of them do not have vault lights. There is no inventory of them. The city is filling in all vaults, as some are structurally unsound. See also the raising of Chicago. *Deadwood, South Dakota, funded a major restoration and maintenance project for vault lights in approximately 2000. *Dublin, Ireland has many vault lights. *Dunedin, New Zealand has well-preserved Luxfer and Hayward Brothers vault lights. *London, England has many vault lights, many made by the Hayward Brothers. Historic preservation legislation encourages a market in new pavement lights. *New York City has large numbers of vault lights, mostly in the SoHo district. More than half of the subway stations originally had vault lights, but these had mostly been blocked off. Installing and restoring vault lights has become part of modern construction practices. The city government has no policies or records about vault lights. *Philadelphia, Pennsylvania has numerous vault lights, some of them locally manufactured. *Portland, Oregon has prisms at several locations. It has no preservation project for its prisms, however, and fills those that break with concrete. There is some local opposition to the policy. See also Portland Underground. *Pretoria, South Africa has Hayward vault lights. *Sacramento, California has \\"hollow sidewalks\\", which originated when the city raised its street level to combat floods; some of these spaces are lit by vault lights. There are many stories told about these areas. *Salem, Oregon has an extensive tunnel network with vault lights. Historians have found a mural-painted grocery drop, a disco, a swimming pool, a firing range, opium dens, and bordellos in the tunnels. Guided tours are sometimes conducted in the tunnels. The Go Downtown Salem! Board welcomed the idea of regular underground tours. Many of the tunnels have been filled during sewer construction. *San Diego, California has sixteen-sided pavement jewels of the \\"Searchlight\\" brand. *San Francisco evaluates the lights as having little historic value, and as a safety hazard for pedestrians. Most of the lights have been removed. The City Lights Bookstore has vault lights. *Saskatoon, Saskatchewan has had sidewalk prisms. They have been used in music videos, and a Facebook group fought to save them. They were scheduled to be infilled in 2015. Disused sidewalk prisms lighting the abandoned Seattle Underground *Seattle, Washington raised its street level, by up to 22 feet in some places, in the aftermath of the Great Seattle Fire of 1889. Previously, the Pioneer Square area had flooded tidally. Seattle replaced some of its sidewalk vault lights in Pioneer Square with new pre-purpled ones in 2002. Seattle runs tourist trips through its underground. *Tijuana, Mexico has armoured unsolarized vault lights in the 1919 Casa de la Cultura. *Toronto, Ontario once had many vault lights, but the last known remaining example were in front of the shops at 2869 Dundas Street West (near Keele) until 2011. *Vancouver, British Columbia has an unofficial policy of requiring any applicants for development permits to fill in areaways, although some have been paved over or made sufficiently load-bearing to support a fire engine. Some of the remaining areaways have restaurants built into them. A walking map of the sidewalk prisms has been produced. There are ~130 remaining areaways, the records of which are not digitised, and no measures exist to promote their preservation. *Victoria, British Columbia has more than eleven thousand sidewalk prisms in seven locations (as of 2006), including an underground gallery running around an entire block outside the Yarrow Building. More than 670 of the prisms are missing or filled with concrete. Sidewalk prisms have been heritage-registered since 1990. Originally, there were hundreds of thousands of prisms. The city has some panels in storage for restoration, but is having difficulty finding a glass supplier. There are city plans to light the galleries below at night, creating glowing purple sidewalks in the downtown core. While they are protected, there is no funding for the preservation of sidewalk prisms.

About 80 percent of married women in Japan prefer condoms as their choice of birth control. This leads them to the least amount of embarrassment while taking part in sexual activity. Other forms of birth control such as the morning after pill are available only through visitation of a clinic. Oral contraceptives, which were legalized in 1999, are not covered by Japanese Health Insurance.  History  Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare had begun considering the legalization of birth control pills by the 1960s, but by 1989, they had still not reached a decision. There were concerns that access to birth control pills would reduce condom use, and thereby increase STI rates. There were also concerns about the medication's side effects. In 1999, low dose forms of the pill were approved by the Clinic of Japan Family Planning Association, coinciding with the acceptance of the erectile dysfunction drug Viagra.

This law gave former tribunes of the plebs the right to hold further magistracies, which had been forbidden by the dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla a few years earlier.Sall. Hist. 3.48.8M Background The constitutional reforms made by Sulla between 82 and 80 BC had comprehensively reduced the powers of the tribunate. Sulla's dislike of the office, and his view of it as dangerous due to its use by radical populares politicians, lead him to reduce both the scope of its powers and its prestige. By removing the right for tribunes of the plebs to hold further magistracies he drastically reduced the appeal of the post on the career path of ambitious politicians. Frank Frost Abbott, A History and Description of Roman Political Institutions, Ginn & Co., 1901, p. 105 An earlier attempt to repeal these aspects of Sulla's constitution had been attempted in 78 BC by Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. Cotta's law was limited in scope and did not restore the full powers of the tribunate. As an optimas and associate of Sulla, there is much discussion of his motivations in repealing Sulla's measures; perhaps as a sop to pacify the Roman people in a period of famine, or perhaps to gather support for his brother Marcus Aurelius Cotta who was running for the consulship of 74 BC.

Geography  Bambaroo has two distinct parts. The centre and north-east is low-lying flat land (approx 20 metres above sea level), drained by numerous small creeks which flow into the Coral Sea in neighbouring Orient and Coolbie. This freehold land is predominantly used to grow sugarcane. The Bruce Highway and the North Coast railway line traverse the locality from east to north through this flat part of the locality with Bambaroo railway station servicing the locality. A cane tramway delivers harvested sugarcane to the local sugar mills at Victoria Plantation and Mackenade. The south-western part of the locality is mountainous and undeveloped, rising up to 980 metres above sea level. This land is protected as Paluma Range National Park.  History  Bambaroo State School opened on 3 November 1924, although it was not officially opened until 19 May 1925 by Thomas Wilson, the Minister of Public Instruction. It closed on 31 December 2016.  In popular culture  Bambaroo is one of the Australian place names mentioned in the second verse of the song \\"I've Been Everywhere\\" written by Australian country singer Geoff Mack in 1959, and made popular by Lucky Starr in 1962.

The program's purpose was to afford the artists an opportunity to visit hard-to- reach places of the Polar Region that are mostly known through scientific reports, which would subsequently allow them to create art projects based on their impressions of the region.

In 2005 he was awarded a PhD degree in Political Science, also at Aalborg University. Christian Albrekt Larsen was awarded the Danish higher doctoral degree in sociology (Dr. scient. soc.) in 2014.  Background and Scientific Contributions  Christian Albrekt Larsen's research has focused primarily on the way in which open economies and multicultural societies maintain their cohesiveness. His research results suggest that the Nordic welfare model still holds the best response to this challenge. In his book \\"The institutional logic of welfare attitudes: How welfare regimes influence public support \\" (Ashgate 2006, PhD thesis) Christian Albrekt Larsen examined how institutions in universal welfare systems create and maintain support for the fight against poverty. His book \\"The rise and fall of social cohesion. Constructing and de-constructing social trust in the US, UK, Sweden and Denmark\\" (Oxford University Press, 2013, higher doctoral thesis) examined how the institutional structures also affect the mutual trust between people. This book is based on empirical data from Denmark, Sweden, United Kingdom and United States in the shape of questionnaire surveys regarding trust, economic inequality and perceptions of marginalised groups such as poor people and immigrants. Moreover, it includes a unique study of how poverty and the poor were described in Danish, Swedish and British media in the period from 2004 to 2009. In a Danish context, Christian Albrekt Larsen has addressed the following topics: * Long-term unemployment and the importance of networks in the labour market (two books) * National identity and the attitude to immigration (two books) * Welfare reforms and the underlying politics (one book) Research grants: * 2015 - 2018: Migrants‚Äô welfare state attitudes, Danish PI (NORFACE grant 3,134,250 kr.). * 2015 - 2018: Welfare State Futures, Danish CO-PI (NORFACE grant 2,251,605 kr.). * 2011 - 2015: The Nordic Models and its contemporary inhabitants.

He showed his best form as a two-year-old in 2002 when he ran in four different countries and recorded Group 1 victories in the Phoenix Stakes and the Gran Criterium. He failed to show any worthwhile form in the following year and was retired to stud. He stood as a breeding stallion in Ireland, New Zealand and Australia and had modest success as a sire of winners. He died in 2012 at the age of twelve. Background Spartacus was a bay horse bred in Ireland by Ron Con Ltd, a breeding company associated with John Magnier's Coolmore organisation. He was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle and raced in the colours of Susan Magnier. Spartacus was sired by Danehill, a sprinter who won the Cork and Orrery Stakes and Haydock Sprint Cup in 1989. He went on to become a highly successful breeding stallion, producing the winners of more than one thousand races including 156 at Group One/Grade I level. Among his best offspring were Dylan Thomas, Duke of Marmalade, Rock of Gibraltar George Washington and North Light. Spartacus's dam Teslemi showed modest racing ability, winning one minor race from eight starts but did better as a broodmare, producing several other winners including the Hong Kong Derby winner Johann Cruyff. Racing career 2002: two-year-old season Spartacus made his debut on 15 May in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Gowran Park in which he started 4/5 favourite against nine opponents. Ridden by Mick Kinane he took the lead approaching the final furlong and quickly drew away to win \\"easily\\" by three lengths. In June the colt was dropped in distance and moved up sharply in class when he was sent to England for the Group 3 Coventry Stakes over six furlongs at Royal Ascot. He never looked likely to trouble the leaders and finished ninth behind his stablemate Statue of Liberty. He produced a much better effort at the Curragh in July when he finished second to Oratorio (another O'Brien trainee) in the Anglesey Stakes. On 11 August at the Curragh the colt was stepped up again in class for the Group 1 Phoenix Stakes in which he was partnered by Colm O'Donoghue. He was the least fancied of the Ballydoyle quartet, starting ay 16/1 whereas Hold That Tiger was made 11/10 favourite with Marino Marini (Marble Hill Stakes) on 7/2 and Oratorio on 9/1. The best fancied of the other five runners were the fillies Cassis (runner-up in the Cherry Hinton Stakes) and Luminata (Silver Flash Stakes). Spartacus led from the start before giving way to Marino Marini a quarter mile from the finish but then rallied to regain the advantage inside the final furlong. He kept on well in the closing stages to win by half a length from Marino Marini with the outsider Polar Force a short head away in third. After the race Aidan O'Brien aid \\"It's not a huge surprise. We've always thought very highly of him. He went from winning a seven-furlong maiden at Gowran Park to the Coventry at Royal Ascot, where he was all at sea back to six furlongs on very fast ground which he had never worked or raced on. Johnny Murtagh rode him that day and said it was like riding a horse in his first piece of work. He's obviously an improving colt and should stay further.\\" After missing a scheduled run in the National Stakes Spartacus was sent to France for the Grand Crit√©rium at Longchamp on 8 October and finished seventh of the fourteen runners behind Hold That Tiger. Two weeks after his defeat in Paris attempted to end his season with a second Group 1 success when he travelled to Italy ad started 1.3/1 favourite for the Gran Criterium over 1600 metres at San Siro Racecourse in Milan. The best of his rivals appeared to be the British challengers Excelsius and Tacitus (second in the July Stakes) and the locally trained and Balkenhol. The twelve runners were reduced to nine after 400 metres when Chippolino fell and brought down Winning Dash and Silverboat. Spartacus led early before settling in third and then regained the lead in the straight. He stayed on well and won by three lengths from the Mick Channon-trained outsider Checkit. 2003: three-year- old season Spartacus missed the spring of 2003 and returned after an absence of eight months in the Grand Prix de Paris over 2000 metres at Longchamp on 22 June. He raced in third place for most of the way but faded badly in the straight and finished last of the eleven runners. In the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood a month later he disputed the lead in the early stages before dropping away in the straight and finishing last of the nine runners, ten lengths behind the winner Reel Buddy. Stud record Spartacus was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion for the Coolmore Stud. After standing for four years in County Tipperary was sold and exported to New Zealand where he was based at The Oaks Stud. In 2012 he was transferred to the Cangon Stud in New South Wales. In late November 2012 he was found dead in his paddock at Cangon Stud after suffering a ruptured aorta. His best winners included All The Aces (Fred Archer Stakes), Rastignano (Gran Premio d'Italia) and Strait of Mewsina (Hawthorne Derby) and Spare A Fortune (Group 3 Metric Mile Handicap). He was champion first-season sire in New Zealand. Pedigree *Like all of Danehill's offspring Spartacus inbred 4 x 4 to the mare Natalma.

They respond to pathogens and injury by changing morphology and migrating to the site of infection/injury, where they destroy pathogens and remove damaged cells. As part of their response they secrete cytokines, chemokines, prostaglandins, and reactive oxygen species, which help to direct the immune response. Additionally, they are instrumental in the resolution of the inflammatory response, through the production of anti- inflammatory cytokines. Microglia have also been extensively studied for their harmful roles in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, Parkinson‚Äôs disease, Multiple sclerosis, as well as cardiac diseases, glaucoma, and viral and bacterial infections. Role in chronic neuroinflammation The word neuroinflammation has come to stand for chronic, central nervous system (CNS) specific, inflammation-like glial responses that may produce neurodegenerative symptoms such as plaque formation, dystrophic neurite growth, and excessive tau phosphorylation. It is important to distinguish between acute and chronic neuroinflammation. Acute neuroinflammation is generally caused by some neuronal injury after which microglia migrate to the injured site engulfing dead cells and debris. The term neuroinflammation generally refers to more chronic, sustained injury when the responses of microglial cells contribute to and expand the neurodestructive effects, worsening the disease process. When microglia are activated they take on an amoeboid shape and they alter their gene expression. Altered gene expression leads to the production of numerous potentially neurotoxic mediators. These mediators are important in the normal functions of microglia and their production is usually decreased once their task is complete. In chronic neuroinflammation, microglia remain activated for an extended period during which the production of mediators is sustained longer than usual. This increase in mediators contributes to neuronal death. Neuroinflammation is distinct from inflammation in other organs, but does include some similar mechanisms such as the localized production of chemoattractant molecules to the site of inflammation. The following list contains a few of the numerous substances that are secreted when microglia are activated: Cytokines Microglia activate the proinflammatory cytokines IFN-Œ≥, IL-1Œ±, IL-1Œ≤ and TNF-Œ± in the CNS. Direct injection of the cytokines IL-1Œ±, IL-1Œ≤ and TNF-Œ± into the CNS result in local inflammatory responses and neuronal degradation. Cytokines play a potential role in neurodegeneration when microglia remain in a sustained activated state. This is in contrast with the potential neurotrophic (inducing growth of neurons) actions of these cytokines during acute neuroinflammation. Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines contribute differently to the neuroinflammatory process after acute brain injury. Chemokines Chemokines are cytokines that stimulate directional migration of inflammatory cells in vitro and in vivo. Chemokines are divided into four main subfamilies: C, CC, CXC, and CX3C. Microglial cells are sources of some chemokines and express the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) chemokine in particular. Other inflammatory cytokines like IL-1Œ≤ and TNF-Œ±, as well as bacterial-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) may stimulate microglia to produce MCP-1, MIP-1Œ±, and MIP-1Œ≤. Microglia can express CCR3, CCR5, CXCL8, CXCR4, and CX3CR1 in vitro. Chemokines are proinflammatory and therefore contribute to the neuroinflammation process. Proteases When microglia are activated they induce the synthesis and secretion of proteolytic enzymes that are potentially involved in many functions. There are a number of proteases that possess the potential to degrade both the extracellular matrix and neuronal cells that are in the neighborhood of the microglia releasing these compounds. These proteases include; cathepsins B, L, and S, the matrix metalloproteinases MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-9, and the metalloprotease- disintegrin ADAM8 (plasminogen) which forms outside microglia and degrades the extracellular matrix. Both Cathepsin B, MMP-1 and MMP-3 have been found to be increased in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cathepsin B is increased in multiple sclerosis (MS). Elastase, another protease, could have large negative effects on the extracellular matrix. Amyloid precursor protein Microglia synthesize amyloid precursor protein (APP) in response to excitotoxic injury. Plaques result from abnormal proteolytic cleavage of membrane bound APP. Amyloid plaques can stimulate microglia to produce neurotoxic compounds such as cytokines, excitotoxin, nitric oxide and lipophylic amines, which all cause neural damage. Plaques in Alzheimer's disease contain activated microglia. A study has shown that direct injection of amyloid into brain tissue activates microglia, which reduces the number of neurons. Microglia have also been suggested as a possible source of secreted Œ≤ amyloid. Role in neurodegeneration Microglia also have a role in neurodegenerative disorders, which are characterized by progressive cell loss in specific neuronal populations. \\"Many of the normal trophic functions of glia may be lost or overwhelmed when the cells become chronically activated in progressive neurodegenerative disorders, for there is abundant evidence that in such disorders, activated glia play destructive roles by direct and indirect inflammatory attack.\\" The following are prominent examples of microglial cells' role in neurodegenerative disorders. Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease where the brain develops abnormal clumps (amyloid plaques) and tangled fiber bundles (neurofibrillary tangles). =Genetics= Many genes associated with Alzheimer's Disease risk are highly expressed in microglia. In late-onset (non-familial) Alzheimer's Disease, a common variant of SPI1 expression is implicated in Alzheimer's risk. It encodes PU.1, a transcription factor necessary for microglial development. TREM2, a cell surface receptor on microglia, is associated with Alzheimer's as well, notably interacting with Apolipoprotein E (another Alzheimer's Disease risk factor). =Microglia Activity= There are many activated microglia over-expressing IL-1 in the brains of Alzheimer patients that are distributed with both AŒ≤ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. This over expression of IL-1 leads to excessive tau phosphorylation that is related to tangle development in Alzheimer's disease. Many activated microglia are found to be associated with amyloid deposits in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. Microglia interact with Œ≤-amyloid plaques through cell surface receptors that are linked to tyrosine kinase based signaling cascades that induce inflammation. When microglia interact with the deposited fibrillar forms of Œ≤-amyloid it leads to the conversion of the microglia into an activated cell and results in the synthesis and secretion of cytokines and other proteins that are neurotoxic. One preliminary model as to how this would occur involves a positive feedback loop. When activated, microglia will secrete proteases, cytokines, and reactive oxygen species. The cytokines may induce neighboring cells to synthesize amyloid precursor protein. The proteases then possibly could cause the cleaving required to turn precursor molecules into the beta amyloid that characterizes the disease. Then, the oxygen species encourage the aggregation of beta amyloid in order to form plaques. The growing size of these plaques then in turn triggers the action of even more microglia, which then secrete more cytokines, proteases, and oxygen species, thus amplifying the neurodegeneration. =Treatment= Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have proven to be effective in reducing the risk of AD. \\"Sustained treatment with NSAIDs lowers the risk of AD by 55%, delays disease onset, attenuates symptomatic severity and slows the loss of cognitive abilities. The main cellular target for NSAIDs is thought to be microglia. This is supported by the fact that in patients taking NSAIDs the number of activated microglia is decreased by 65%.\\" Parkinson's disease Parkinson's disease is a movement disorder in which the dopamine-producing neurons in the brain do not function as they should; the neurons of the substantia nigra become dysfunctional and eventually die, leaving a lack of dopamine input into the striatum. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) may have the ability to chemoprotect the cells of the substantia nigra. A small study is (2017) in the recruitment stage for participants who will undergo AAV2-GDNF gene transfer via surgical infusion into their brains, in the hope of ameliorating Parkinson's symptoms. Multiple sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by focal lesions of inflammation, axonal loss, gliosis, and demyelination that affect the white and gray matter. In MS patients, destruction of myelin in the CNS is associated with activated macrophages or microglia, which are thought to be involved in the disease pathogenesis. While most of the findings of microglial activation are non-MS specific, the M1 activation (CD40, CD86) is specific for this disease.M.Vercellino et al, Inflammatory responses in Multiple Sclerosis normal-appearing white matter and in non-immune mediated neurological conditions with wallerian axonal degeneration: A comparative study. Journal of Neuroimmunology Volume 312, 15 November 2017, Pages 49-58 Cardiovascular Diseases Recently microglial activation has been reported in rats with myocardial infarction (Rana et al.,2010). This activation was specific to brain nuclei involved in cardiovascular regulation suggesting possible role of microglial activation in progression to heart failure. Role in glaucoma Several studies have proved the changes occurring in the microglia of the inner plexiform and of the outer plexiform layers of the retina. Also a new software to automatize the count of microglial cells in the retina has been published. However, depletion of microglia from the retina and optic nerve does not affect the degeneration process of retinal ganglion cells after acute injury of the optic nerve. Thus, it remains to be studied whether microglia play a functional role in the degeneration process in glaucoma. Role in glioma Gliomas are complex brain tumors composed of heterogeneous populations of neoplastic as well as non-neoplastic cells. Not only tumor cells, but also non-tumor cells of the microenvironment contribute to cancer progression and response to treatment. Tumor-associated macrophages/microglia (TAMs) are the main infiltrate in gliomas, comprising up to 40% of the tumor mass. TAMs are either of peripheral origin (macrophages) or representing brain-intrinsic, yolk sac-derived microglia, that create a supportive stroma for neoplastic cell expansion and invasion. Crosstalk between tumor cells and TAMs is characterized by the release of growth factors and cytokines by TAMs in response to factors produced by cancer cells. In this manner, TAMs facilitate tumor proliferation, survival and migration. Microglial TAMs are mainly found in the tumor margin, while macrophage TAMs are found in the tumor core and in regions of necrosis. Blood-derived TAMs upregulate immunosuppressive cytokines and show an altered metabolism compared to microglial TAMs. Therefore, high degrees of infiltration with blood-derived TAMs, but not microglial TAMs, correlates with significantly inferior survival in low-grade glioma. Role in viral infections Human immunodeficiency virus The infection of mononuclear phagocytes with HIV-1 is an important element in the development of HIV-associated dementia complex (HAD). The only brain cell type that is \\"productively\\" infected with the virus are microglial cells. It has also become clear that neurotoxic mediators released from brain microglia play an important role in the pathogenesis of HIV-1. \\"HIV-1 can enter the microglial cell via CD4 receptors and chemokine co-receptors such as CCR3, CCR5, and CXCR4, with CCR5 being the most important of these. Humans with double allelic loss of CCR5 are virtually immune to HIV acquired via the sexual route (though can be infected by IV transmission of CXCR4 tropic viruses). IL-4 and IL-10 enhance the entry and replication of HIV-1 in microglia through the up-regulation of CD4 and CCR5 expression, respectively. The chemokines CCL5/RANTES, CCL3/MIP-1Œ±, CCL4/MIP-1Œ≤, all of which bind to CCR5, are inhibitory to HIV-1 replication in microglial cells, apparently by their ability to block viral entry.\\" Infected microglia contain viral particles intracellularly. There is a correlation between the severity of dementia and microglial production of neurotoxins. One discrepancy in HAD is the limited number of HIV-1 infected microglia in comparison to the many CNS abnormalities that occur. This suggests that chemical factors that are released from microglial cells are contributing to neuronal loss. \\"It has become more and more apparent that HIV-1 infected microglial cells actively secrete both endogenous neurotoxins such as TNF-Œ±, IL-1Œ≤, CXCL8/IL-8, glutamate, quinolinic acid, platelet activating factor, eicosanoids, and NO as well as the neurotoxic viral proteins Tat, gp120, and gp41.\\" Microglia are the main target of HIV-1 in the brain. When activated by HIV-1 or viral proteins, they secrete or induce other cells to secrete neurotoxic factors; this process is accompanied by neuronal dysfunction (HAD). Herpes simplex virus Herpes simplex virus (HSV) can cause herpes encephalitis in babies and immunocompetent adults. Studies have shown that long-term neuroimmune activation persists after the herpes infection in patients. Microglia produce cytokines that are toxic to neurons; this may be a mechanism underlying HSV- related CNS damage. It has been found that \\"active microglial cells in HSV encephalitis patients do persist for more than 12 months after antiviral treatment.\\" Role in bacterial infections Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the major component of the outer membrane of a gram-negative bacterial cell wall. LPS has been shown to activate microglia in vitro and stimulates microglia to produce cytokines, chemokines, and prostaglandins. \\"Although LPS has been used as a classic activating agent, a recent study of rat microglia demonstrated that prolonged LPS exposure induces a distinctly different activated state from that in microglia acutely exposed to LPS.\\" Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis. It is primarily localized to the subarachnoid space while cytokines and chemokines are produced inside the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. Microglia interact with streptococcus via their TLR2 receptor; this interaction then activates microglia to produce nitric oxide which is neurotoxic. The inflammatory response, triggered by microglia, may cause intracerebral edema. Role in parasitic infections Plasmodium falciparum Plasmodium falciparum is a parasite that causes malaria in humans. A serious complication of malaria is cerebral malaria (CM). CM occurs when red blood cells break through the blood‚Äìbrain barrier, causing microhemorrhages, ischemia and glial cell growth. This can lead to microglial aggregates called Durck's granulomas. Recent research has indicated that microglia play a major role in the pathogenesis of CM.  Trichobilharzia regenti  Trichobilharzia regenti is a neuropathogenic schistosome which migrates in a central nervous system of birds and mammals. In mice, microglia accumulate in the parasite migratory tracks and around damaged or dying worms. In vitro, microglia produce nitric oxide and proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha after exposure to parasite antigens, which suggests their role both in maintaining inflammation and tissue pathology. Role in neuropathic pain Microglia have been implicated in neuropathic pain. They become activated in response to nerve injury, as demonstrated by several animal models. Activated microglia release substances that excite pain-sensitive neurons, including prostaglandins and reactive oxygen species, through the purinergic signaling mechanisms. Moreover, microglia also release of proinflammatory molecules through the stimulation of purinergic receptors, including IL1-Œ≤, IL-6, and TNF-Œ±. The release of these molecules is mediated by the P2X7 receptor and creates a positive feedback loop, exacerbating the pain response. A causal role for microglia in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain has been demonstrated through P2X4 receptor. P2X4 receptors are upregulated following injury and the increase in purinergic signaling activates p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). The increase in p38 MAPK signaling leads to greater microglial release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF released from microglia induces neuronal hyperexcitability through interaction with the TrkB receptor. Therapeutic development has focused on finding purinergic signaling blockers. There has been some success with P2X7 blockers, A-438079 and A-740003, however there are no selective P2X4 receptor antagonists to date. As a target to treat neuroinflammation Inhibition of activation The retina is helpful to control neuroinflammation is to inhibit microglial activation. Studies on microglia have shown that they are activated by diverse stimuli but they are dependent on activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Previous approaches to down-regulate activated microglia focused on immunosuppressants. Recently, minocycline (a tetracycline derivative) has shown down-regulation of microglial MAPK. Another promising treatment is CPI-1189, which induces cell death in a TNF Œ±-inhibiting compound that also down-regulates MAPK. Recent study shows that nicergoline (Sermion) suppresses the production of proinflammatory cytokines and superoxide anion by activated microglia. Microglial activation can be inhibited by MIF (microglia/macrophage inhibitory factor, tuftsin fragment 1‚Äì3, Thr-Lys-Pro). MIF-treated mice showed reduced brain injury and improved neurologic function in a mouse model of collagenase-induced intracerebral hemorrhage. Regulation of chemokine receptor The chemokine receptor, CX3CR1, is expressed by microglia in the central nervous system. Fractalkine (CX3CL1) is the exclusive ligand for CX3CR1 and is made as a transmembrane glycoprotein from which a chemokine can be released. Cardona, et al. stated in 2006 that \\"using three different in vivo models, we show that CX3CR1 deficiency dysregulates microglial responses, resulting in neurotoxicity.\\" Further studies into how CX3CR1 regulates microglial neurotoxicity could lead to new therapeutic strategies for neuroprotection. Inhibition of amyloid deposition Inhibitors of amyloid deposition include the enzymes responsible for the production of extracellular amyloid such as Œ≤-secretase and Œ≥-secretase inhibitors. Currently the Œ≥-secretase inhibitors are in phase II clinical trials as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease but they have immunosuppressive properties, which could limit their use. Another strategy involves increasing the antibodies against a fragment of amyloid. This treatment is also in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Inhibition of cytokine synthesis Glucocorticosteroids (GCS) are anti-inflammatory steroids that inhibit both central and peripheral cytokine synthesis and action. In a study conducted by Kalipada Pahan from the Department of Pediatrics at the Medical University of South Carolina, both lovastatin and sodium phenylacetate were found to inhibit TNF-Œ±, IL-1Œ≤, and IL-6 in rat microglia. This shows that the mevalonate pathway plays a role in controlling the expression of cytokines in microglia and may be important in developing drugs to treat neurodegenerative diseases. Naltrexone may provide a solution to the inflammatory mediators produced by microglia. Although naltrexone's main action is to competitively bind to opioid receptors, new research shows that naltrexone, when given in low doses once per day (low-dose naltrexone), can inhibit cytokine synthesis by microglia cells. This mechanism is still being investigated, but there are already studies that indicate that it helps some patients suffering from fibromyalgia syndrome. Naltrexone shows more promise than GCSs because the GCSs inhibit immune system function more generally, increase allergic reactions and, as the name implies, increase blood glucose levels.

At the Conservatoire de Paris, he studied counterpoint and fugue with Aim√© Leborne and pipe organ with Fran√ßois Benoist. In 1860, he won the Second Grand Prix de Rome with his cantata Ivan IV. Cavaill√©-Coll dated 1923. Adolphe Deslandres and his father Laurent were titular organists of this church in the 19th century. In 1862, he succeeded his father as organist of the Sainte-Marie church. He played on an organ of the Stoltz Fr√®res company, and on a choir organ of the Merklin firm. In addition to his extensive works of sacred music such as the Messe de Saint-Andr√©, premiered at Notre Dame de Paris, and his Messe solennelle, Deslandres composed several successful op√©ras comiques. In 1872, his opera Dimanche et Lundi was premiered at the Op√©ra- Comique and received the praise of Gounod. The premiere of Le Baiser took place in 1884. His other operas were performed at the Alcazar. Deslandres also composed some works for organ, piano (an Air de ballet and √âtudes in staccato), a Scherzo for orchestra, and four M√©ditations for violin, cello, French horn, harp, organ and double bass. Adolphe Deslandres had two brothers, also musicians, whose careers were interrupted by their premature death. Jules-Laurent Deslandres (15 August 1838 in Batignolles ‚Äì 1 August 1870) studied at the Conservatoire de Paris where in 1855 he won the first prize for professional double bass.

He ran in the simultaneous local elections of 2018, and was reelected. Personal life He was born on 18 September 1967 in a village of Lahat from parents Sapril and Ruhinah. After completing his junior high school studies (SMP), he moved to the neighboring province of Lampung, working in Bali Bank and an assortment of other jobs before starting his university studies in Bandar Lampung University, majoring in Public Administration. He moved back to South Sumatra in 1997, living in its capital Palembang. Family He married Selviana in 1994 at the age of 27, and the couple's first children was born in 1996. They have three children. Career He continued to work at Bali Bank following his move, now at its branch in Palembang. In 1998, he left to start his own business in poultry sales before he entered politics. He became a member of the then- nascent Democratic Party in 2003, before the election of its chairman Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono into presidency. In the 2004 elections, he became a member of the Palembang City Council and he was chosen as chairman following his re- election in the 2009-2014 tenure, coming from the city's 5th electoral district. He was first elected as the local chairman of the party in 2010, and remained an incumbent following his re-election in April 2017. In 2013, he ran with Romi Herton in the city's mayoral elections. Initial results from the KPU showed a loss of the pair to Sarimuda-Nelly Rosiana. However, the two candidate pairs were separated by only 8 votes (316,923 to 316,915). Almost immediately, the pair brought a case to the Constitutional Court. Following a bribe of Rp 19.5 billion (US$ 2.01 million) to then-chief justice Akil Mochtar, their case was granted and the pair was declared winners of the election. Not long after starting office, Romi was investigated by the Corruption Eradication Commission and was found guilty, being sentenced to 6 years of prison in March 2015. Harnojoyo was not prosecuted, and was made mayor on 10 September 2015. He selected his former running mate's younger sister Fitrianti Agustinda as his deputy.

Not rediscovered until 2014, it is one of the few compositions surviving from the composer's early years. History Composition Dyson began work on the symphony shortly after completing his Bachelor of Music degree in 1909. Paul Spicer notes that the Oxford rules required a five-year gap between completing his Bachelorate and submitting for his Doctorate, this meant that while Dyson took his Doctoral exams in September and November 1910, the symphony was not submitted to the examiners until October 1917. Spicer writes that Dyson's choice of Psalm 107 as the basis of the symphony was most likely due to the vivid imagery contained within the psalm and the ease with which that imagery could be used to construct the individual movements of the work. Rediscovery Following the composer submitting the work for examination, it was archived and not rediscovered until 2014, when author Paul Spicer located the manuscript in the Bodleian Library while conducting research for his biography of George Dyson.

Episodes Season 1 (2018) Season 2 (2020) Production Development and conception left As a longtime resident of Texas, 5th Ward The Series finds Carter expanding on themes from his first feature film ‚Äì titled Fifth Ward ‚Äì which he made 20 years ago. The son of a minister, Carter moved to Houston from Arkansas when he was a child. Although he was only in Fifth Ward a short time, the neighborhood left an impression on Carter. Initially, Carter went to Texas A&M; University to study engineering, however he took a detour into drama. After the completion of school, Carter was ready to tell his Fifth Ward story. Fifth Ward, Carter's debut film was featured in the SXSW Film Festival and set Carter on a path writing, directing and producing feature films. Over the years, he kept developing a Fifth Ward story. \\"I wanted to tell a story that was bigger than just one about being black, about being who I am,\\" he commented. Carter's vision was to capture the oft-changing demographic makeup of a neighborhood with a long history dating back to the end of the Civil War, when it was largely settled by freedmen. For the series, Carter wanted to infuse the show with a feeling of authenticity, so he prefaced his episodes with documentary-style interviews with residents, \\"people who were models in appearance and story to the four main characters on the show,\\" he commented. \\"I wanted to give it that feeling, 'This is Houston.' \\" Among Carter's storylines are one about a Pakistani family and one about a Vietnamese family. Leading actress M√Ωa stars in another narrative about a struggling single mother with two sons and aspiring singer. With his series, Carter hopes viewers unfamiliar with the neighborhood's history may find information threaded through the show. For 5th Ward The Series opening credits, Carter combed through archival photos and music, old and new. \\"If a kid sees it and doesn't know who Mickey Leland is, I hope he'll want to find out,\\" he says of the late congressman. \\"And the music tells a story, too. I wanted some ragtime in the opening sequence: That feeling of the past going back to Reconstruction and then move it forward to a trap beat like kids would listen to today. I want it to revolve around a vernacular particular to Houston and its culture.\\" Music Director Greg Carter and his Nexus Entertainment partnered with Melissa Harville-Lebron of E2 Northeast Motorsports, Inc. (NASCAR) and Coutr√° Music Group, Inc. to release the free soundtrack Spotify playlist for the show on March 2. Additionally, E2 Northeast Motorsports, Inc. unveiled the 5th Ward- UMC NASCAR vehicle as part of the Camping World Truck Series in Las Vegas on March 2 as well.

In 1984, 50 years after his playing days and 30 years after his death, O'Donnell was named on the \\"Best Ever Donegal Team\\" as part of the GAA centenary Celebrations that year. Sigerson and Interprovincial John O'Donnell is reportedly the first Donegal player to have won a Sigerson Cup medal. He won twice, in 1930 and again in 1931, playing with University College Dublin (and scoring half of the UCD tally of 2-4 in the 1931 final.) He also represented his province and was a member of Ulster Railway Cup teams between 1933 and 1937.

It opened in 2000, and nowadays it houses about three hundred contemporary photographs of the city, artists from various parts of the world, including Chema Madoz, Alberto Garc√≠a √Ålix, Toni Catany, Otto Lloyd, Xavier Miserachs, Ouka Lele and Frank Horvat, among many others. Annual exhibitions are organized and a series of conferences on history and humanities. thumb The Palau Solterra Museum  The building  The Palau Solterra was declared an artistic historical monument in 1981 and tt opened in 2000, first with a painting fund and later (and up to now) with the photographic collection of the Foundation Vila Casas. The building presents a mixture of styles, but always linked to the local construction tradition. The predominance of Baroque or modern constructions have not erased primitive forms and Gothic or Renaissance elements. The history of its construction and remodeling is linked to the most notable families in the country, as well as to its prosperity and decadence. The year exactly of its construction is unknown, but it can be dated between the end of the 14th century and the beginning of the 15th, by order of the old Pons family. In 1503, a descendant of this family, Antic Sarriera and Margarit, married Anna Beneta de Gurb, from Sant Hilari Sacalm and Mrs. of the Solterra Museum, thus joining together the patrimony. From here comes the name of our palace. For the five following centuries, the Palau Solterra was the scene of all kinds of luxury, thanks to the presence of several important and prominent families in that region. During the Civil War (1936-1939) the palace was empty and uninhabited, although some rooms were used to carry out some activities such as the distribution of letters of rationing to the people of Torroella de Montgr√≠. In the sixties the ground floor was rehabilitated as a cultural center of private initiative, calling it the Palace of the Castle of the Mystery. Later, the city council of Torroella acquired it and took advantage of the building as a meeting place for youth. But the rapid deterioration of the palace caused it to be closed due to security problems. Finally, it was in 1999 when it became part of the Vila Casas Private Foundation to rehabilitate it and make it suitable for converting it into what is currently a contemporary photography museum.  The collection  Palau Solterra hosts the permanent collection of contemporary photography and temporary exhibitions, by national and international artists. The museum contains more than 300 contemporary photographs exposed and it has become one of the most important photography museums on a state level.  Permanent exhibition  The exhibition is presented with a studied museum criterion that allows the visitor multiple readings suggested by the same collection, through an open and plural route. The permanent exhibition does not follow a chronological order because the thread is the modernity seen through the visual and documentary processes of the different works.  Temporary exhibitions  Temporary exhibitions take place in the rooms on the ground floor. In addition, it is also where the winners and selected of the Vila Casas Foundation photography contest summons to discover, project and promote artists. On the same floor we find the auditorium, where other activities such as conferences on history and humanities, or other activities are carried out closely linked to the cultural life of the people and the territory.  Services   Educational Service  The Palau Solterra Museum offers educational dossiers about the collection to the tutors, so they can prepare their visits.  Guided Tours  The Museum also has a guided tours service, which are updated based on the annual changes that take place in the exhibitions.  Guided visits for adults with reservation: visit to the permanent exhibition, visit to the temporary exhibition or visit commented by specialists on the architectural space.  Guided tours of Courtesy: Guided tour of the permanent exhibition included with the ticket entrance, every Saturday and Sunday at 12:00 a.m.  Spaces related  Can Framis Museum is the latest Fundaci√≥ Vila Casas museum, an art center devoted to the promotion of contemporary Catalan painting. Located in the old Can Framis factory complex, the museum displays more than 250 paintings from the sixties up to the present made by artists born or currently living in Catalonia. In addition to the permanent collection which is divided in three floors, Can Framis Museum also has an area dedicated to temporary exhibitions named Espai A√∏. They update their permanent collection periodically and every three months they open two new temporary exhibitions. Espai Volart. A space for temporary exhibitions of artists featured in the collection. In 2002 it was the foundation's first art space to open its doors to the public in Barcelona. It is located in the old storerooms of the Modernist building Casa Antonia Puget, on Ausi√†s Marc 22, and was declared a site of local cultural heritage by the Barcelona city council. It was built in 1904 by the architects Roc Cot i Cot and Ramon Vi√±olas. Every July the Patrim exhibitions, shows of work by students finishing Fine Arts at Barcelona University, are also held at Espai Volart, as well as an exhibition of a selection of works from the Ynglada- Guillot drawing prize and the award ceremony. Espai Volart 2. A space that holds temporary exhibitions by well-known artists whose work falls into one of the three disciplines of the collection: contemporary painting, photography or sculpture. Unlike Espai Volart, which concentrates exclusively on artists from the collection, Espai Volart 2 presents the work of artists well known in the Catalan art world. Espai Volart 2 was opened in 2008 and is located in the old storerooms of the Modernista building Casa Felip, at Ausi√†s Marc 20, Barcelona. It was constructed in 1901 by the architect Telm Fern√°ndez. At the beginning of the 1980s it was declared a site of local cultural heritage by the Barcelona city council. Can Mario Museum. Can Mario is the Fundaci√≥ Vila Casas Museum of Contemporary Sculpture in Palafrugell (Costa Brava). It was opened in 2004. It has around 220 works on show dating from the 1960s to the present day by a wide range of artists born or living in Catalonia. Temporary exhibitions are also held every year. Can Mario was a cork factory dating from the early 20th century and was one of the buildings of the Miquel, Vincke and Meyer cork company. Since April 2011, 33 sculptures by artists from the Empord√† region of Catalonia have been placed in the Gardens of Can Mario as permanent open air exhibits. In October of the same year the Empord√† Room was opened in the Museum, for holding temporary exhibitions of artists from the region.

Early life and career James Lesley Daniels was born in Laredo, Texas, in 1908. He grew up in Little Rock, Arkansas. In the 1920s he moved to New York and joined the circles of the Harlem Renaissance. He also attended Bird‚Äôs Business College in the Bronx. After college he went back to Little Rock and worked as secretary for A.E. Bush, president of the Century Life Insurance Company. In 1928 he was back to New York City to try a career on the stage. He was in the cast of Katharine Cornell's play on Broadway, Dishonored Lady, and performed with the Savage Rhythm in local theaters like Chamberlain Brown Stock Company in Mount Vernon, New York. He then moved to cabaret singing and performed at Harlem‚Äôs Hot Cha nightclub. Jimmie Daniels performed primarily music by George Gershwin, Cole Porter, and Harold Arlen. He moved on the stages of New York, Paris, London and Monaco. In 1933 and 1934 Daniels toured Europe and performed at different places like Summer Sporting Club in Monte Carlo and Ciro‚Äôs in London (with Reginald Forsythe). Back in the United States he was the lead performer at Marian Cooley's Sunday night suppers at Ship Grill in New York. In 1935 he organized a series of parties at the Bronze Studio. At this time he met Herbert Jacoby who convinced him to go back to Europe and perform at Le Reubon Blue in Paris in 1936 and 1937, and again in 1938. In 1939 he opened the Jimmie Daniels Nightclub at 114 West 116th Street in Harlem, which he managed until 1942 when he enlisted. During World War II, Daniels performed for the troops. In 1950 Daniels became the lead performer at the Bon Soir in Greenwich Village, a place which attracted a mixed clientele‚ÄîBlack, White, straight, gay. In the 1960s he organized a series of parties at the L‚ÄôEtang Supper Club in Downtown Manhattan. At the same time Jimmy Merry, prominent property owner of Cherry Grove, New York, hired Daniels to manage the Tiffany Room, now the Ice Palace. He also performed at the Blue Whale Bar in Fire Island Pines, New York. But a racist event, a cross burned in front of Daniels' home on the island, convinced Daniels to drop this venture. In the later 1970s, Daniels performed at parties and clubs like Jan Wallman‚Äôs Restaurant in Greenwich Village. Personal life In 1934, Daniels met Philip Johnson, already a prominent architect. Daniels was Johnson's first serious relationship. The relationship lasted one year and Johnson would recall later that \\"a terrible man stole him away‚Äîwho had better sex with him, I gather. But I was naughty. I went to Europe and I would never think of taking Jimmie along.\\" Later Daniels was in a relationship with Kenneth Macpherson, filmmaker who was married with wealthy English heiress Annie Winifred Ellerman, also known as Bryher. Bryher commissioned Richmond Barth√© to make a bust of Daniels. In the 1950s Daniels shared a home with fashion designer Rex Madsen. Since 1925 Daniels was a good friend of Alberta Hunter and took care of her when she was old. Jimmie Daniels died on June 29, 1984, just a few days after performing at the Kool Jazz Festival‚Äôs Evening of the Music of Harold Arlen at Carnegie Hall.

In 2017, he received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry together with Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson \\"for developing cryo-electron microscopy for the high-resolution structure determination of biomolecules in solution\\".  Career  Dubochet started to study physics at the √âcole polytechnique de l'Universit√© de Lausanne (now √âcole polytechnique f√©d√©rale de Lausanne) in 1962 and obtained his degree in physical engineering in 1967. He obtained a Certificate of Molecular Biology at University of Geneva in 1969 and then began to study electron microscopy of DNA. In 1973, he completed his thesis in biophysics at University of Geneva and University of Basel. From 1978 to 1987, Jacques Dubochet was group leader at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg, then part of West Germany.

At Lausanne he took part in initiatives to make scientists more aware of social issues. In 2014, Jacques Dubochet received EMBL's Lennart Philipson Award.

He found a way of freezing thin films of water so fast that crystals had no time to form [that could damage samples] [...] over time the technique has become increasingly important to life science research, and it is clear today it is Nobel Prize-worthy.\\" When asked by his university how he would like his Nobel Prize to be recognised by the institution he asked for a parking space for his bicycle which was duly given. He had cycled to his lab almost every day for 30 years.https://twitter.com/CycleLuxembourg/status/1184086167526006789?s=20 Personal life Jacques Dubochet is married with two children. He has dyslexia. In the 1970s, for the second meeting with his future wife, they went to protest against the Kaiseraugst nuclear power plant construction project.

He wrote treatises on a variety of topics including magnetism and experimental method. Writings Among St Amand's many treatises was one on the magnet. His pharmacopoeia was the Commentary on the Antedotary of Nicholas. Like Roger Bacon (c. 1219‚Äìc. 1292)) after him, St Amand wrote on experimental method. The historian of science Lynn Thorndike explains that St Amand \\"asserts that experimentum alone is 'timorous and fallacious,' but that 'fortified by reason' it gives 'experimental knowledge.'\\" In her view, what St Amand meant was that experimentation had to be methodical, and used alongside theory. On simples used in herbal medicine, St Amand stated specific rules for practical testing: he advised that the specimen had to be pure; that the test should be on a simple disease; that the test be repeated; and that the dose should depend on the patient. Thorndike notes that both St Amand and Albertus Magnus preceded Bacon in their use of the phrase \\"experimental knowledge\\".

Background In the early 1990s, the Hong Kong English-language newspaper market was dominated by the South China Morning Post and the Hong Kong Standard, a distant second, both of which were seen to have begun to favour the Chinese Communist Party line on Hong Kong in the remaining few years before handover of sovereignty in 1997. The Express was established with a mission to stop this tide of \\"strangulation\\" and the hope of securing a piece of the highly lucrative franchise of the Post. Beginnings Facing saturation in the Chinese- language newspaper business and hearing of a management shake-up at the Post, the chairman of Oriental, Ma Ching-kwan, saw an opportunity to slot a new English daily into the print capacity of their HK$200 million facility built in 1990. Ma recruited former Guardian bureau chief Steven Vines as its first chief editor, and two dozen reporters from the Post, Standard and Far Eastern Economic Review. Like Vines, many were veterans brought in on high salaries. The first edition was published on 1 February 1994. Ulterior motive It has been controversially suggested that the newspaper was established by Ma as part of a broader scheme of currying favour with the British Conservative Party and then Governor of Hong Kong Christopher Patten so as to head off narcotics trafficking allegations made against his two fugitive uncles, founders of the Oriental, one of whom was then resident in Taiwan. Stiff competition After nine months, the paper was struggling with sparse advertising and management upheaval. Vines had left and there was an ongoing search for a replacement. Circulation was languishing at somewhere around a sixth of the market leader, the Post. In the ensuing 19 months, a procession of five more chief editors ran the paper for Oriental.

It is connected to the X-Men film series, and follows two parents who take their family on the run after discovering their children's mutant abilities. The episode was written by series creator Matt Nix, and directed by Len Wiseman. Stephen Moyer and Amy Acker star as Reed and Caitlin Strucker, parents on the run, alongside Sean Teale, Natalie Alyn Lind, Percy Hynes White, Coby Bell, Jamie Chung, Blair Redford, and Emma Dumont. Wiseman joined the series as an executive producer and director in August 2017. Showrunner Matt Nix wanted the episode to continue the story of the series' pilot rather than begin a new story, focusing on the ramifications of the prior episode including the overuse of abilities by Chung's Blink. The episode introduces several significant guest stars for the season, including Garret Dillahunt as Roderick Campbell and Elena Satine as Dreamer. \\"rX\\" aired on Fox on October 9, 2017. It was watched by 3.79 million viewers, and received mostly positive reviews from critics, who thought it continued the momentum from the first episode. Praise also went to the expanded role for Acker and for the shower scene where Polaris's (Dumont) green hair is revealed. Plot After teleporting several members of the mutant underground away from agents of the Sentinel Services (SS) in the previous episode, Clarice Fong falls unconscious and loses control of her abilities. A portal from the underground's base to an unknown rural road opens, sending part of a truck crashing into the base and injuring Caitlin Strucker. Her daughter Lauren is able to close the portal with her control over air molecules. In prison, the mutant Lorna Dane / Polaris is given a collar that shocks her whenever she attempts to use her abilities. She faces discrimination from the human inmates, including Scar, who was injured by a mutant in her past, and leads a group to physically attack Polaris. The latter fights through the pain of the shock collar to attack Scar back with a metal table, and is sent to solitary confinement. Also in custody, Caitlin‚Äôs husband Reed is questioned by SS agent Jace Turner about the location of the mutant underground. After Turner threatens Reed's mother, Reed agrees to give up the mutants' location on the condition that he and his family goes free. Caitlin, a trained nurse, and underground member Marcos Diaz race to a nearby hospital that still treats mutants. Diaz uses an injury from earlier to quickly see a doctor. Fong's abilities become more intense, opening portals to that same road more frequently, with first local police coming to investigate on the other side, and then SWAT. When Lauren is no longer able to close the portals, her brother Andy defends them with his telekinetic abilities. These disturb Fong even more, and portals beginning flashing around the compound, causing major damage and starting a hasty evacuation. Caitlin is able to get medication from the hospital to help Fong, but she and Diaz are forced to flee when a doctor believes from her injury that she is a victim of domestic abuse. They arrive back in time to help Fong and stop the portals from destroying the compound. Later, Roderick Campbell, a scientist studying mutants, asks one of his subordinates to contact the lead SS agent on the Struckers' case, comparing Lauren and Andy's situation to that of two mutant siblings in an incident in the 1960s. Production Development By August 2017, Len Wiseman joined the series The Gifted as an executive producer, and was set to direct the show's second episode, titled \\"A New World\\". This came under an overall deal Wiseman had with production company 20th Century Fox TV, and extended a relationship that he had with series creator Matt Nix, the pair having worked together previously on the series APB. In September, the episode's title was changed to \\"rX\\". Writing The episode was written by Nix. Following on from the series' pilot, Nix said the second episode would be \\"super- continuous, and super-intense\\", adding, \\"If you liked the pace an scale of the pilot, we do not let up in the second episode.\\" He said that the series would not become a procedural, with a \\"save the mutant of the week\\" formula, and would instead follow the ongoing story of the mutant underground as they both try to save other mutants and fight to protect themselves, though each episode still has a beginning, middle, and end. In this episode specifically, he said that the characters would be facing detours, for instance, \\"We‚Äôve seen Blink‚Äôs portals working great, but what if they don‚Äôt? Really interesting things happen.\\" Actress Jamie Chung added that the episode would explore \\"the ramifications of a mutant overexerting themselves\\". Chung also noted that the episode ends with a new pink marking appearing on Blink's face, after she previously only had one under her right eye. She explained that more markings appear on the character as she uses her abilities more, moving the character towards her comic appearance where she has multiple markings. Following the reveal in the pilot that the character Polaris is pregnant, actress Emma Dumont said that \\"having a small, mutant baby inside of her, I think for a normal person it would make her be more cautious, but I think it's the total reverse where she‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòI have something in the world to care about and now I‚Äôm going to fight even harder,‚Äô and that is probably pretty dangerous.\\" This episode reveals that Polaris has green hair, which she hides with dark hair dye. Her true hair color is revealed as she showers in prison, adapting a scene from the early X-Men comics where her green hair is also revealed after she showers. Casting The series stars Stephen Moyer as Reed Strucker, Amy Acker as Caitlin Strucker, Sean Teale as Marcos Diaz / Eclipse, Natalie Alyn Lind as Lauren Strucker, Percy Hynes White as Andy Strucker, Coby Bell as Jace Turner, Chung as Clarice Fong / Blink, Blair Redford as John Proudstar / Thunderbird, and Dumont as Lorna Dane / Polaris. Elena Satine was revealed in August 2017 to have been cast in the series as Dreamer, a mutant that can \\"add or subtract\\" others' memories, to appear in the second episode. The next month, Garret Dillahunt was cast as Roderick Campbell, a \\"key recurring role\\" for the show. The guest cast for the second episode was also revealed by Fox in September; in addition to Satine, it included Dillahunt, as well as Joe Nenners as Agent Ed Weeks, Sharon Gless as Ellen Strucker, Hayley Lovitt as Sage, Chris Butler as Dr. Watkins, and Dinarte de Freitas as Pedro. Nenners, Lovitt, and de Freitas return from the series' first episode, while Gless previously worked with Nix on his series Burn Notice. Folake Olowofoyeku also guest stars in the episode as Scar, and Anissa Matlock portrays the \\"porcelain mutant\\". Filming Newly-joined executive producer Len Wiseman directed this episode In May 2017, the Dallas Film Commission announced that the rest of The Gifteds episodes would not be filmed in that city, like the pilot, after a decision on tax rebates in the state was made too late for the series' schedule. Filming was moved to Atlanta, Georgia, beginning July 17. This caused the series' setting to be changed from Dallas to Atlanta (with the pilot episode retroactively changed to match this). Nix said the production was \\"very fortunate\\" to have Wiseman directing the episode, and noted that it was a \\"bigger\\" episode than the pilot, with more time allocated to it for filming than the usual eight or nine days per episode for the series. Acker described Wiseman as very \\"detail-oriented ... he just really wanted everything to be right. There‚Äôs never enough time, but he really made sure that everything worked and looked really cool.\\" For the stunt where a truck is cut in half by one of Blink's portals, the production literally cut a truck in half. To create the effect of dark hair dye being washed from Polaris's hair and revealing green hair, series' hair designer Charles Yusko created twelve different wigs and hair pieces, some of which could change color. The series opted for more \\"subdued shades of green\\" hair than the character is often portrayed with in the comics. The collar used to prevent Polaris from using her abilities resembles collars used to restrict powers on the island of Genosha in the comics. Release Broadcast \\"rX\\" aired on Fox on October 9, 2017. It was broadcast on CTV in Canada, and on Fox channels in more than 183 countries following its U.S. debut, using a \\"day-and-date launch\\" format. Marketing Executive producer Jeph Loeb and Wiseman attended a New York Comic Con panel on October 8, alongside cast members and other executive producers, to promote the episode and the rest of the series. The first fifteen minutes of the episode were shown. Reception Ratings In the United States the episode received a 1.2/4 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, meaning that it was seen by 1.2 percent of all households, and 4 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. It was watched by 3.79 million viewers. Critical response Reviewing the episode for IGN, Joshua Yehl gave it a \\"great\\" score of 8 out of 10, calling it an \\"equally well-executed\\" follow-up to the series' pilot. He praised the expanded screen time for Acker and her performance, as well as Dumont's scenes such as her shower scene. Yehl highlighted the explorations of mutant healthcare and the lack of empathy that Reed and Caitlin initially have for mutants, and also the way the episode revealed teases of some long-running mysteries. He was less positive about the \\"opening/closing portal problem\\", but it \\"won [him] over\\" by the end of the episode, as well as the introduction of Satine's Dreamer who \\"seems to solely exist for exposition purposes\\". Writing for Den of Geek, Jim Dandy said the series continued to be a \\"solid entry into overall X-Men canon\\", feeling that it has the best depiction of the hardships of mutant life since the original X-Men (2000); that it had \\"completely thought out\\" its world; and \\"the focus on the family dynamic that adds heart to the whole thing\\", overcoming some unoriginal plotting. At Flickering Myth, Rachel Bellwoar thought the episode was effective in exploring the state of mind that the characters are in after the pilot, and in acknowledging the lack of sympathy that Reed and Caitlin have had towards mutants until now. Bellwoar also thought the continued exploration of Lauren's past hiding her mutant abilities from her family made her \\"one of the show‚Äôs most fascinating characters\\". She did think that \\"the climax of Blink‚Äôs illness gets a bit wonky\\", and thought that the end tag introducing Dillahunt was unnecessary, and could have been left for the next episode. Jesse Hassenger of The A.V. Club graded the episode a 'B', feeling that the episode overcame a common television problem by maintaining the momentum from the pilot. He praised Wiseman's direction, saying that on television he \\"looks like a decent stylist; this episode was pretty cool- looking, and the prison scenes were particularly eye-catching. For better and for worse, the combination of ogling and badassery of Polaris‚Äôs scene in the prison showers is pure Wiseman.\\" Hassenger did criticize the Reed/Turner scenes, particularly Moyer's performance, saying \\"his whole physicality feels off\\". Kayti Burt of Collider gave the episode a \\"good\\" three stars out of five, calling it entertaining but mediocre. She thought the Caitlin/Diaz storyline was the best part of the episode, but criticized the show's main characters for their \\"white, non-mutant privilege\\" and for exhibiting behavior that the comics would have relegated to villains. Burt summarized, \\"The Gifted remains at its best when it keeps the pace fast, but the cracks in the narrative start to show whenever the characters slow down for a breath.\\" References External links 2017 American television episodes Television episodes about psychic powers The Gifted (American TV series) X-Men television series episodes Television episodes set in Georgia (U.S. state) ","title":"RX (The Gifted)"},{"id":"55440688","text":"Sarcophagine (Sar) is a bicyclic cage-like metal chelator molecule. derived from cyclam.

Life He was born in Jena, the son of Karl Alexander von Kalb, chamber- president of Saxe-Weimar. His brother was Johann August Alexander von Kalb, who succeeded their father as chamber-president (11 June 1776 to 7 June 1782) and was caricatured by Friedrich Schiller in his tragedy Intrigue and Love. On 15 August 1770, aged 16, von Kalb became a lieutenant in the Royal Deux-Ponts Regiment of the French Army. Aged 24 he rose to second lieutenant and two years later to first lieutenant. His regiment formed part of the 5,000-strong force sent by the Kingdom of France to fight for the United States in the American Revolutionary War. He was honoured for his achievements by George Washington, then general of the Continental Army, though he is often confused with Baron Johann von Kalb, also known as Johann de Kalb, who also fought in the war as a major. On his return to Germany his brother forced him to marry Charlotte von Marschalk und Ostheim. Since he was soldiering for the rest of the year he could only spend the winter months with his wife and so the marriage proved an unhappy one, with her taking refuge in affairs with Schiller and later with Jean Paul. Divorce was soon discussed, but they had had a son together and so (formally at least) they remained married, even after unofficially separating in 1800. The French Revolution ended his career in the French Army ‚Äì he took part in Louis XVI's flight to Varennes in 1791 and was sent back to Thuringia without a pension. He tried in vain to join the army of one of the German states and in the meantime his brother had wasted the family fortune. Heinrich retired to his estate near Trabelsdorf, where he began an affair with his cook, Barbara Tod, a teacher's daughter, with whom he had three children.

Biography Erich M√ºhe completed medical school in 1966 and finished his surgical training at the University of Erlangen in 1973. He moved to B√∂blingen in 1982 to take a position as the head of surgery in a local hospital. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy Inspired by Kurt Semm's pioneering use of laparoscopy, a minimally invasive surgical technique, M√ºhe designed his own surgical laparoscope, which he called the \\"Galloscope\\", in 1984. He first used it to remove a gallbladder (in a procedure known as cholecystectomy) on September 12, 1985, marking the world's first laparoscopic cholecystectomy. He first presented his work in April 1986 at the Congress of the German Society of Surgery, after performing 94 successful surgeries using his technique. He gave two further lectures on his technique in 1986 and 1987, but his surgical colleagues disapproved of the technique, regarding it as dangerous and describing it as \\"Mickey Mouse surgery\\". In 1987, when one of M√ºhe's patients died from complications related to the surgery, M√ºhe faced charges of manslaughter. He was cleared of the charges in 1990, by which time laparoscopic cholecystectomy was being performed widely across North America; M√ºhe was only recognised years later as the first to perform the surgery. The achievement has also been credited to two French surgeons: Phillipe Mouret, who first performed the surgery in 1987; and Francois Dubois, who did the same in 1988. In 1992, the German Society of Surgery‚Äîwhich had initially rejected M√ºhe's work‚Äîawarded him its top honour, the Anniversary Award. The following year, the president of the society's 1986 congress apologised to M√ºhe, describing his work as \\"without a doubt one of the greatest original achievements of German medicine in recent history\\".

She was full sister of Sultan Mehmed V of the Ottoman Empire. Early life Refia Sultan was born on 7 February 1842 in the Be≈üikta≈ü Palace. Her father was Sultan Abdulmejid I, and her mother was G√ºlcemal Kadƒ±n. She was the seventh daughter of her father and second child of her mother. She had a elder sister Fatma Sultan, one year elder then her and a younger brother Mehmed V, two years younger then her. Upon the death of her mother in 1851, she and her siblings were adopted by Abdulmejid's first wife, Servetseza Kadƒ±n. In accordance with tradition, Refia Sultan started to learn the Quran in 1847 with her sister Fatma, her sister Cemile Sultan, her brothers Murad V and Abdul Hamid II. Refia Sultan, education continued after marriage she learned French and Persian. Apart from these courses, she also received a good music education. Sultan Abdulmejid took care to raise his children well in music. For this purpose, pianos were brought from Europe and Italian and French teachers were hired to teach children. Two fashion elements such as French and Western music were clearly influential in the music education of Refia Sultan. Marriage On 22 February 1854, when Refia was twelve, Abdulmejid betrothed her to Mahmud Edham Pasha, the son of Mehmed Ali Pasha. Mehmed Ali Pasha had himself been married to Refia's aunt, Adile Sultan, with whom he had a daughter named Hayriye Sultan. Baronne Durand de Fontmagne, who lived in Istanbul for a year and a half in 1858-9 following the Crimean war, was shown the gifts about to be sent to Refia Sultan before her marriage. She noted that these included various preserves in 'not less than five hundred pots of very fine Dresden China'. The marriage took place on 21 July 1857, at the Topkapi Palace, and the couple were given a palace located at the Defterdarburnu as their residence. Refia Sultan was not happy with her marriage to Edhem Pasha, as in many other princesses marriages. It is understood from the letters that she wrote to her brothers that she had some problems with her marriage. The fact that Edhem Pasha was flirtatious is one of the reasons for this unhappiness. On the other hand, Edhem Pasha was not happy with this marriage either because of the illness of Refia, or the disagreements between them and other problems. Refia Sultan was a kind-hearted and charitable lady. Character The generous personality of Refia Sultan was more apparent on special occasions such as festivals. During the Eid-al-Adha, she gave rams and sheep to some relatives, servants. The help and generosity of Refia Sultan attracted a great deal of attention. As a matter of fact, due to her aid to the soldiers who were injured in the Russo-Turkish War (1877-78) and to the Muslim immigrants who had to leave their homes after the war. She was awarded with the ‚ÄúOrder of Compassion‚Äù by her half-brother Abdul Hamid II. In addition to all this benevolence and generosity, Refia Sultan also appears with her lavishness. The princess who loved luxury life. Spending more than the income of the palace women in the 19th century and especially during the reign of her father Abdulmejid became almost a tradition. She was also raised in this period and was influenced by the passion of shopping and fashion of other women in the palace. In fact, this was the result and necessity of a new lifestyle similar to that in the West. As a matter of fact, she ordered harnesses from Paris and her clothing needs. The princess ordered goods and clothes from both Istanbul and France through her French teacher, Maria Tirard. Other foreign women, such as Tirard, who communicated with the palace, not only ensured the spread of western culture among the women of the palace but also provoked them to follow Western fashion. Death At the age of thirty-three, Refia fall in a incurable disease known as Ovarian cyst. Abdul Hamid appointed European head physicians for her treatment, but no one as able to heal her. Apart, from medical treatment, Abdul Hamid also used traditional treatment methods, but still they were unsuccessful. Refia Sultan died childless at the age of thirty seven on 4 January 1880, following a long illness, and several operations. She is buried in the Mausoleum of the imperial ladies at the New Mosque, Istanbul. Her mother is buried beside her in her mausoleum.

In 1934, the issue of establishing such a museum was raised at the Republican conference by theater workers. The museum was organized in the same year in the building of the Azerbaijan State Drama Theater. In fact, this exhibition was the foundation of a future museum. According to eyewitnesses, Jalil Mammadguluzadeh and Abdurrahim bey Hagverdiyev, the great writers who cut the opening ribbon of the exhibition, said: \\"Long live the Azerbaijani theater!\\" The exhibition is soon officially formalized as a Theater Department of the Azerbaijan State Museum. Finally, on the basis of the relevant department of the Azerbaijan State Museum in 1934, Azerbaijan State Theater Museum was established and Aghakarim Sharifov was appointed the director of the museum. On 25 November 1934, the solemn opening ceremony of the museum was held. Famous art figures such as Bulbul, Shovkat Mammadova, Huseyngulu Sarabski, Alexander Tuganov, Ulvi Rajab, Ismayil Hidayatzade and others attend the event. In 1935, the museum was named after Jafar Jabbarli, the great Azerbaijani playwright. In 1963, the Azerbaijan State Theatre Museum was annulled and became the Theater and Drama Department of the Azerbaijan Literature Museum named after Nizami. In 1968, the Government of the Republic made a decision on the organization of the Azerbaijan State Theater Museum named after J. Jabbarli on the basis of this department. The rooms on the 4th floor of the building of the Azerbaijan Literature Museum named after Nizami are given to the newly created museum. In these rooms, it was possible to place only the museum stock and employees. The most remarkable transformation in the history of the Azerbaijan State Theater Museum took place in 1991.

The company developed technology for radio- telegraphy, radio program transmission, radar, television and other applications. It provided broadcasting and telegraphy services, and sold its equipment throughout the French colonial empire and in many other parts of the world. In 1968 CSF merged with the Thomson-Brandt to form Thomson-CSF. Background Gustave Ferri√©, pioneer of French radio technology From the mid-19th century the world was connected with an increasingly dense network of telegraph wires and submarine cables. In 1887 Heinrich Hertz of Germany conclusively proved the existence of electromagnetic waves. Alexander Stepanovich Popov of Russia developed antennas to transmit and receive radio waves. Scientists such as √âdouard Branly and Nikola Tesla also contributed to development of the concepts. In 1895 Guglielmo Marconi, a student at the University of Bologna, invented wireless telegraphy. In 1897 he founded the Wireless Telegraph & Signal Company in England. Its subsidiary the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America was formed in the US in 1899. The Telefunken company was created in Germany in 1903 as a joint venture of Siemens and AEG. In France the engineer captain Gustave-Auguste Ferri√© (1868-1932) gathered a team to work on wireless telegraphy for the military. Ferri√© demonstrated the value of radio telegraphy to the government during the volcanic eruption of the Mount Pel√©e in Martinique, and showed the value of placing antennas at the summit of the Eiffel Tower. In 1908 the young polytechnic √âmile Girardeau joined Ferri√©'s team. Girardeau and the scientist Joseph Bethenod decided to found a French company to meet military and civilian radio communication needs. Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise Radio-Electrique (1910‚Äì19) The Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise Radio-Electrique (SFR) was launched on 3 April 1910. Paul Brenot was an important contributor to development of the SFR. Bethenod's new techniques were used in the first radiotelegraph link in the tropics, between Brazzaville and Loango. This led to orders for SFR equipment from Belgium, Mexico, Turkey, Bulgaria, Serbia, Italy, Russia and China. Between 1910 and 1914 the SFR developed musical frequency resonance alternators, established stations in the Belgian Congo and Russia, developed field transmitters that could be carried by car or mule, which were tested in the 1912‚Äì13 Balkan Wars, and installed the first transmitters on airships, airplanes, warships, fishing boats and passenger boats. World War I (1914‚Äì18) stimulated radio research. New stations were ordered by Serbia and Romania. The French Navy built a large center at Basse-Lande (Brains, Loire- Atlantique), with two arc transmitters and one spark transmitter. SFR delivered 65 fixed stations with over 5 kW power, 18,000 aircraft stations, 300 stations on vessels and 300 mobile stations on vehicles. A new machine providing continuous waves using the Bethenod process was installed at the Lyon la Doua station. Formation (1918‚Äì19) Huge spiral \\"pancake\\" inductors at Sainte Assise in 1922 Creation of the Compagnie g√©n√©rale de la t√©l√©graphie sans fil (CSF) in 1918 was due to the success of the SFR and the initiative of investors led by the Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas (BPPB) and including the Compagnie Fran√ßaise des C√¢bles T√©l√©graphiques (CFCT), which operated transatlantic telegraph lines. One of the benefits to the bank was that it allowed it to make use of the rights it had to German assets seized by the Allies. √âmile Girardeau headed the CSF, which was a holding company that included the SFR for radio telegraphy and had other subsidiaries for management of radio telegram traffic, maritime radio and radio broadcasting. In 1919 the SFR created a factory in Levallois-Perret in the northwest of Paris. Paul Brenot left the army to become technical director of the SFR. There were strong financial relations between BPPB and the CSF holding company, but BPPB did not have much involvement with the subsidiaries, for which the CSF played the role of banker. The CSF revenues came from royalties paid by the subsidiaries for the exploitation of patents held by the parent company. Dividends remained low. The CSF managed a general research laboratory at the central level, and held all the patents in the group. Inter-war period (1919‚Äì39) The CSF gave attractive salaries and facilities to young physicists who could not obtain academic positions. These included Yves Rocard (1903-1992), who joined Radiotechnique in 1928 and Maurice Ponte (1902-1983), who joined in 1929. Both Rocard and Ponte were graduates of the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in Paris. Yves Rocard later contributed to developing France's atomic bomb. Ponte was placed in charge of the SFR vacuum tubes department and of the general research laboratory, and was given a free hand in hiring physicists to assist in electronics and electromagnetic radiation research. In 1925 the CSF group had about 1,600 employees. By 1935 it had grown to 4,900 employees, including the workforce of Radiotechnique, which at that time was jointly owned with Philips. In 1935 the state required that its most important suppliers have facilities south of the Loire, and the SFR moved to Cholet, Maine-et-Loire. The Cholet plant, which had been a subcontracting plant to the main Levallois factory, became an autonomous facility with the full range of administrative, technical and testing services. It grew from 25 workers in 1937 to 1,250 in 1957, with an area of . During the inter-war period the German Telefunken, the British Marconi, the American RCA and the French CSF operated as a cartel, avoiding competition. During meetings of the International Broadcasting Union ostensibly concerned with regulating use of radio frequencies the company leaders made agreements for cross-licensing of patents and for carving up the market. The CSF's main markets were France, the French colonial empire, Serbia, Argentina and Chile. The CSF also had branches in the Middle East, China Japan and the USSR. Radio transmission services 1924 Radiola advertisement To help promote radio technology, on 19 October 1920 the Secretary of State for Posts and Telegraphs granted the CSF the concession to build and operate all international radio links from France. One of the company's early achievements was construction of the Sainte-Assise long-wave transmission station, near Melun, through its subsidiary Radio- France. Eight towers supported two antennas fed by four 500KW alternators. The station entered operation in 1922. Short wave transmissions, reflected by the ionosphere, are generally a better solution for intercontinental transmissions but are sensitive to weather and variations in the ionosphere. The huge Sainte-Assise installation remained useful for emergencies. In Sainte Assise the Radio-France subsidiary began broadcasting to Europe, America and the Far East in 1921 under a 30-year state concession signed in 1920. The Soci√©t√© Radio-Orient was a subsidiary that provided a similar service in the Near East. The SFR, based in Levallois-Perret, began experimental broadcasts in June 1922. On 31 October 1922 it was authorized to broadcast regular programs, with the proviso that advertising was not allowed. The first broadcast of the Radiola station from Levallois was made in early November 1922. Radiola was the first French private radio broadcasting station. It was renamed Radio- Paris in 1924. Additional radio broadcast stations were created in Clichy, Toulouse, Algiers, Ankara, Tunis, Rennes, Lille and Strasbourg. In 1933 Radiola was sold to the state due to political pressure. Radio equipment Vacuum tube 1T4 manufactured by La Radiotechnique CSF manufactured radio reception and transmission equipment for both amateurs and professionals. The Radio Maritime subsidiary provided equipment to merchant ships. The Radiotechnique subsidiary was formed in 1919 to research and develop electronic transmission and reception tubes at its Suresnes plant. The \\"Radiola\\" trademark was used for radio receivers produced by Radiotechnique as well as for the radio station. Although France was not immediately affected by the Great Depression, CSF felt the effect in 1929 since radio transmission was mainly the result of global commercial activity. In 1929 it merged amateur equipment manufacturing into its Radiotechnique subsidiary and made an agreement with Philips of the Netherlands under which CSF would drop its amateur equipment line and Philips would not compete on professional equipment. Philips bought half the shares of Radiotechnique, but in practice fully controlled the subsidiary. The market for amateur receiving stations exploded in 1930. CSF used the sale of shares and its stake in Radiotechnique to strengthen its position in the professional sector. Development and manufacture of professional electronic tubes was transferred from Suresnes to the SFR plant at Levallois. In late 1937, Maurice Elie at SFR developed a means of pulse-modulating transmitter tubes. This led to a new 16 cm system with a peak power near 500W and a pulse width of 6Œºs. French and U.S. patents were filed in December 1939. Radar Rocard and Ponte both moved to Levallois after the spin-off of Radiotechnique. Ponte was appointed director of the \\"lampes\\" department, the name used for electronic tubes at the time, but continued to be directly involved in research, particularly into magnetrons to generate ultra-short waves for obstacle detection. This was an early form of Radar, although it was used to detect boats and icebergs rather than enemy aircraft. In the 1920s French physicists Camille Gutton and √âmile Pierret had experimented with 16 cm wavelengths. After researching the cavity magnetron system in the short wave domain at 16 cm and 80 cm, a CSF team led by Maurice Ponte and Henri Gutton, son of Camille Gutton, filed a patent for a radar detection system in 1934. In 1934‚Äì35 CSF equipped the SS Oregon and SS Normandie with anti-iceberg collision detectors with a range of about . Film and television The PTT asked CSF to study television, and CSF launched the Radio-cin√©ma subsidiary for this purpose, with the first objective being to develop talking movie projectors for large cinemas. Radio- cin√©ma was founded as a subsidiary of CSF on 21 June 1929, in the year that talking movies first appeared. The first workshops were in the 20th arrondissement of Paris. The subsidiary designed and made movie projectors for big cinema screening rooms. CSF did not get involved in television cameras and receivers, but from 1935 was the PTT's main contact for development of TV transmitters. World War II (1939‚Äì45) Pierre Grivet In 1939 the company had slightly more than 4,000 employees, still considerably less than Telefunken, Marconi, RCA and Philips of the Netherlands. In the early months of the war the Levallois laboratories made important advances in the development of the cavity magnetron, which paved the way for centimeter radar that will be widely used by the Allies from 1943 to equip hunters and bombers. On 8 May 1940 Maurice Ponte went to London in person to present the CSF magnetron to the British, who would combine the advantages of the SFR prototype and their own prototype. After the German occupation the Levallois and Cholet plants were placed under the supervision of Telefunken. The SIF plant in Malakoff was placed under the supervision of Siemens & Halske, and the Radiotechnique plant in Suresnes under that of Philips Electro Special, a German subsidiary of Philips in Berlin. During the war Paul Brenot had the title of technical director of the SFR, but was the right-hand man of √âmile Girardeau. Under the German occupation there were very friendly relations between the CSF and Telefunken, for which Brenot was later criticized. In his defense, Brenot said that Telefunken's permanent representative in Paris, Doctor Schultz, was a former composer and virtuoso pianist with whom he had formed cordial relations before the war, and who was liberal, anti-militaristic and anti-Nazi. The SFR set up a study center in the free zone in Lyon. The Personnel Department was instructed to facilitate the transfer of all Jewish employees who wish to move there. A small factory was also set up in Algiers. Controlled by the occupants as a Telefunken production center, SFR produced mainly for the German army. 65% of its turnover was devoted to German armaments from 1940 to 1944, reaching 86% in 1943. The number of employees was 2,600 in February 1940, dropped to 1,000 in August 1940 but then rose to more than 4,000 by 1943. Most of the output was equipment designed by Telefunken. Several capital increases were arranged, supported by BPPB. Pierre Grivet, a graduate of the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, was appointed to the Lavallois-Perret research laboratory during World War II and participated in a project to develop a 60kV oscilloscope, needed for television research. Grivet acquired expertise in electron optics, and obtained a government order for an electrostatic electron microscope during the period of German occupation. Post-war period (1945‚Äì68) In the early 1950s Robert R. Warnecke was director of microwave research at the CSF in Paris. Castaing Microprobe, Model MS85, Cameca 1958 After World War II Radio-cin√©ma moved to Courbevoie, near to the other factories in Levallois. The project to develop the Spectro-Lecteur spectrum analysis device was launched at Radio-Cinema in 1947 in response to a request from the metallurgical company Pechiney. Early in the 1950s Radio-Cinema acquired the company of Andr√© Charlin, an engineer known for his expertise in talking movies, loudspeakers and stereophonics. In 1954 Radio-Cinema became the Compagnie des Applications M√©caniques et Electroniques au Cin√©ma et √† l'Atomistique (CAMECA). The company retained its core business but diversified into precision engineering, making scientific instrumentation and aerospace radars. In 1955 CAMECA was structured with three departments, one to produce Radio-Cinema and Charlin film projectors, one undertaking mechanical production for other CSF subsidiaries, and the third working on the Spectro- Lecteur. CAMECA went on to develop ion and electron microprobes. Dassault Mirage Cyrano 11 Radar In 1957 the CSF absorbed the SFR.

Originally from Sierra Leone, then a British colony, he was the first black graduate of the University of Oxford, where he studied as a non-collegiate student and then at University College.  Life  Cole was the grandson of a slave, and the adopted son of Reverend James Cole of Waterloo. Prior to his studies at Oxford he was educated at Fourah Bay College in Freetown, Sierra Leone. He enrolled at Oxford as a non- collegiate student with the Delegacy of Unattached Students (now St Catherine's College) in 1873, studying classics. His student contemporaries included the imperialist Cecil Rhodes and the author Oscar Wilde. Short of money, Cole paid his way by teaching Responsions, one of the qualifying exams for Oxford degrees, and his classes were reportedly popular. He also taught music lessons: a cartoon of the time depicts him playing a banjo. Cole's popularity at the college is indicated by the fact that when his uncle died and his financial situation worsened, fellow students and the then Master of University College, George Bradley, raised money to help him. Despite his financial problems and the disadvantages of being unattached to a college, he graduated in 1876 with a fourth-class honours degree and in November of that year was accepted as a member of University College, a position he held until April 1880. His presence drew a lot of attention, including press cartoons depicting him with racial stereotypes. His feelings about these reactions are suggested by his anti-racist writings. He still took a very visible role in the life of the college, including speaking at the Oxford Union. According to biographer Mich√®le Mendelssohn, the American abolitionist Col. Thomas Wentworth Higginson saw Cole at Oxford and described him as ‚Äúa very black youth from Africa‚Äù in a B.A. gown. \\"King Cole\\" was the name that Higginson heard the undergraduates call him. On leaving Oxford in 1880 he returned to Sierra Leone, but did not find employment, so returned to England to train as a barrister. He was accepted by the Inner Temple in 1883, thus becoming the first black African practising in English courts. He later went to Zanzibar to continue his career in law. He died of smallpox in 1885, at the age of 33. Pamela Roberts, Founder and Director of Black Oxford Untold Stories, brought Christian Cole to the attention of University College Master, Sir Ivor Crewe, and the College's Governing Body with the aim of putting up a plaque to honour Cole's achievements. On 14 October 2017, Roberts and Crewe unveiled a plaque to Cole on University College's exterior wall, in Logic Lane, opposite the College‚Äôs Law Library.  Written works  Cole delivered lectures on education in Freetown, which were published in 1880. In 1879, Cole published two pamphlets. One was \\"What Do Men Say about Negroes?\\", a response to F. E. Weatherly's book Oxford Days.OCLC catalogue entry for The other contained his thoughts on the Anglo-Zulu war and was titled Reflections on the Zulu War, By a Negro, BA., of University College, Oxford, and the Inner Temple.

Poudel is well known for his keen participation in anti-panchayat movements in Nepal. It is notioned in the district of Rasuwa that Poudel was the only one to actively involve in anti-panchayat movements and movements of civil rights in Nepal until multi party democracy was introduced. He actively participated in the People's Movement I (Jana Aandalon) of 1990, which led to the end of the Panchayat system and the removal of the ban on political parties. Poudel stood as a candidate for the Parliament of Nepal from Rasuwa in 2051 B.S. He lost the election by few hundred votes which went on very hard to Nepali Congress in the Parliament of Nepal, as it was left out few seats behind by Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) to become the largest party of Nepal.

It was formed in 1791 by renaming the Royal Deux-Ponts Regiment and fought in the French Revolutionary Wars before being merged into another unit in 1803. A new and unrelated 99th Infantry Regiment was formed in 1855 and took on the traditions of the previous regiment. History On 1 January 1791 the National Constituent Assembly decided to remove the Royal Deux-Ponts Regiment's royal affiliation and rename it the 99th Line Infantry Regiment. On 21 July that year it lost its original status as a foreign-raised regiment and was fully integrated into the French army. It helped pursue the fleeing Prussians at and at in 1792 and in the battles of Blaton, Neerwinden and in 1793. In 1793 it also became the 99th Battle Demi-Brigade, formed of the 1st Battalion of the 50th Line Infantry Regiment and the 4th and 9th Volunteer Battalions of Les Bouches-due-Rh√¥ne. It fought at the battle of Fleurus (1794) before being transferred to the arm√©e d'Italie, in which it fought at Ponte-di-Nova on 16 April, Sotta on 26 May and Rochetta on 21 September. It then fought at on 22 November 1795 and at Voltri, , Dego, , Fombio and during the 1796 Italian campaign.

It continued serving in 1796, taking part in the fighting at Limburg an der Lahn, , Neubof and Mainz. It was sent back to Italy in 1798, fighting in 1799 at the Trebbia, Bassignana, , and and in 1800 in the Var campaign and the crossing of the Mincio.

A dedicated suffragette from at least the year 1909, she became a member of the Women‚Äôs Social and Political Union (WSPU) in her twenties and spent time in Holloway Prison for breaking windows. Early life: 1891‚Äì1903 Born in Islington, London, in 1884 to John Stephen Chappelow (a chartered accountant) and Emily Mary Elizabeth Chappelow, Chappelow enjoyed a fairly wealthy upbringing where she was sent to the North London Collegiate School, enjoyed singing,Islington Gazette, 2 November 1903, Northern London Collegiate School.

Gibbs, Springer, 2001 During her time at the North London Collegiate School, Dr Sophie Bryant was the headmistress,London Daily News, Monday 31 December 1906, https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk so it is possible that Chappelow from an early age was interested in the suffragette movement. She also had a brother named Claude who was four years her senior. A picture of the town sign By the age of seventeen her father had moved away from Chappelow and her mother (possibly her brother as according to the census of 1901 he was still living with the family), but remained married to Emily despite being separated. Residing in Islington till at least 1910, it wasn‚Äôt till Chappelow and her mother moved to the hamlet of Nounsley near Hatfield Peverel, Essex, that Chappelow visibly got involved with the suffrage movement. Votes for women: 1908‚Äì1912 On 19 November 1908, the suffragettes Sylvia Pankhurst, Flora Drummond and Helen Ogston visited Chelmsford as there was an upcoming Mid Essex by-election. Meeting at the Corn Exchange both Sylvia and Helen gave speeches however the crowd soon became rowdy with hecklers accosting the women, including ‚Äòpushing the trolley they were speaking from around‚Äô. The following evening Chelmsford came to a standstill as Flora Drummond leant out of the windows of The Bell Hotel, lecturing the crowds below, whilst the National Trade Defense Association also harangued the crowds. And on 27 November there were rallies at both Shire Hall and outside the Marconi building led by the Women‚Äôs Freedom League and The National Union of Women‚Äôs Suffrage Societies. Essex Weekly News, 20 November 1908 It isn‚Äôt clear if Chappelow was involved with these demonstrations or whether she was even in Essex at this point, however she‚Äôd joined the WSPU by 1909 as in September of that year was in Leicester having disrupted a meeting led by the then Home Secretary Winston Churchill at the Palace Theatre. The disruption consisted of besieging the doors after Alfred Hawkins, husband of the suffragette Alice Hawkins,Alice Hawkins and the Suffragette Movement in Edwardian Leicester, Breedon Books Publishing, Derby, 2007 was thrown out of the meeting after challenging Churchill with the question: ‚ÄòWhy don‚Äôt they secure the vote of the women in the country? How dare you stand on a democratic platform?‚Äô Chappelow was imprisoned for five days.The Observer, 5 September 1909, \\"Suffragettes Arrested\\" Chappelow might also have been in Leicester on the behalf of the WSPU who had offices at Clement's Inn, as she also sold the paper Votes for Women which was printed by St Clement's Press. By 1910, Chappelow was definitely living in Hatfield Peverel as she‚Äôs mentioned in the 25 November 1910 edition of the Essex Weekly News for her involvement in a planned raid on the House of Commons 'Miss G Chappelow, Hatfield Peverel'. The 119 suffragettes (including Chappelow), were not prosecuted after having appeared at Bow Street Magistrates‚Äô Court therefore were free to go.Essex Weekly News, 25 November 1910, \\"Essex Suffragists Arrested\\" She was arrested again in 1911 for another attempted raid on the House of Commons, along with 223 other women,Essex County Chronicle, 24 November 1911, Suffragette Riot in London - Essex Women Arrested, https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/ and in the same year her mother refused to take part in the census, scrawling 'no vote, no census'. Chappelow's friends the Rock sisters (Madeline and Dorothea), also refused to take part. 1912 was just as active as previous years, as Chappelow was mentioned again in the Essex County Chronicle for smashing panes of glass at Mansion House, home of the Lord Mayor of London. Arrested along with Madeline and Dorothea Rock and a woman named Fanny Pease, all four were imprisoned for two months, hard labour, in Holloway Prison. The Alderman did not wish to punish them in this way, but did so because he disagreed with their point of view: The Alderman said \\"he was sorry to punish these women in this way, but they were acting under an entirely mistaken view of the case. There were violent as against the public, and that was bound to bring punishment in its train. He must punish them equally as he would do a poor wandering man in the street who broke windows, and they must go to prison for two months‚Äô hard labour.\\"Essex County Chronicle, 8 March 1912 In the same year, Chappelow attended (before she was imprisoned), a series of meetings held at Shire Hall, Chelmsford, in March, and presided over one where she spoke of 'the growth of the suffrage movement': \\"Miss Chappelow spoke of the growth of the suffrage movement, and stated that the militant methods were more on the side the Government than on the part of the women. It was pitiable to see the number of people who said it did not matter about votes. There were many social and industrial plagues that women were suffering from, and Suffragists realised that there was a cure for these ailments, and that sure was the vote.\\"Essex County Chronicle, 16 February 1912, https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/ These meetings were arranged so that the WSPU could get their point of view across, and explain why they employed tactics such as breaking windows. However within late March many of them had been cancelled due to fears of Shire Hall being damaged. 1912-WWII In November 1912, Chappelow was arrested by Witham Police after her dog had attacked a political agent. She refused to pay the fine of 14s, and was imprisoned for fourteen days.Essex County Chronicle, 22 November 1912, Miss Chappelow Arrested, Essex Suffragette Goes to Prison, https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/ A later oral source describes this as being a 'Conservative agent', but this cannot be proved for certain. By 1928 Chappelow and her mother, possibly along with her brother Claude, had moved to Ramsden Heath, Essex. Their house had no running water so they had to use a well, and had a radio but not a television. Chappelow also loved nature and animals, and was a strict vegetarian who sold goats milk and owned thirteen cats.Konter, Mrs & Hunter, Mrs, http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/825e4979-3597-424e-b4ab-0f77f633bef0 Later life In later life Chappelow continued to sell goats milk in Ramsden Heath, though sold it via a tricycle with a box at the back (she could no longer ride a bicycle). Known locally as 'The Goat Lady', she didn't really care about her appearance and rarely washed her hair. Left a great deal of money when her mother died, she gave this to animal causes. Grace currently features in a project 'Snapping the Stiletto' which is uncovering stories of strong Essex Women to help dispel the negative stereotype of the 'Essex Girl'. Emmeline Pankhurst and Sylvia Pankhurst After Chappelow's arrest and imprisonment at Holloway in 1912, she smuggled a prison cup and a knife out of the prison on her release. She also received a certificate signed by Emmeline Pankhurst on behalf of the WSPU, and a portcullis badge from Sylvia. These items currently belong to Chelmsford Museum.

It is the first time a British publisher collected Lorde's work into one volume. The collection focuses on key themes such as: shifting language into action, silence as a form of violence, and the importance of history. Lorde describes herself as a \\"Black, lesbian, mother, warrior, poet\\", and addresses the difficulties in communication between Black and white women. The collection is made up of five sections. A preface by Reni Eddo-Lodge, an introduction by Sara Ahmed, 13 essays, and 17 poems, and a Note on the Text. As the Note on the Text states, many of the essays in the collection were given as papers at conferences across the U.S. Further, Lorde often revised early poems and re- published them, so many of the poems in this collection are the latest versions of Lorde's work.  Background  Your Silence Will Not Protect You was published posthumously in order to bring together Lorde's essential poetry, speeches, and essays, into one volume for the first time. As Silver Press states, \\"Her extraordinary belief in the power of language ‚Äì of speaking ‚Äì to articulate selfhood, confront injustice and bring about change in the world remains as transformative today as it was then, and no less urgent\\".  Title  \\"Your Silence Will Not Protect You\\" is a quote from the first essay to appear in the collection, \\"The Transformation of Silence into Language and Action\\". She states, \\"My silences had not protected me. Your silences will not protect you\\". This references her belief in speaking for oneself and taking language into action.  Summary   Essays  In \\"The Transformation of Silence into Language and Action\\", Lorde discussed various themes that recur throughout the book, including silence as a form of violence, shifting language into action, and the splintering of the feminist movement. She argued that using her voice to speak and connect with other women during her treatment gave her strength, \\"I am not a casualty, I am also a warrior\\". \\"Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power\\", discussed how each person has both used and unused types of power. She speaks to the dichotomy of sexuality, and in particular how women have been suppressed from utilizing its power. \\"We have been taught to suspect this resource, vilified, abused, and devalued within western society\\". She also argued that erotic connection can be used as a form of exploration for self-expression, \\"In touch with the erotic, I become less willing to accept powerlessness...such as resignation, despair, self- effacement, depression, self-denial\\". \\"A Conversation between Audre Lorde and Adrienne Rich\\" discussed different periods in Lorde's life, and her struggles with family, writing, and teaching. At one point, she discusses how Black women were sexually assaulted and harmed during times of revolution. She recalls, \\"And while we‚Äôd be trying to speak to them as women, all we‚Äôd hear is, ‚ÄòThe revolution is here, right?‚Äô. Seeing how Black women were being used and abused was painful‚Äù. She also highlights the differences in protecting one's communities, \\"And this is what happens between Black men and women because we have perfected certain kinds of weapons that white women and men have not shared\\". \\"The Master's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House\\" is a commentary on a speech Lorde gave at The Second Sex Conference at New York University in 1978. She criticizes the lack of representation for \\"poor women, Black women, Third World Women, and lesbians\\", having been asked to speak at 'The Personal and the Political' panel. She argued that those who are poor, Black, older, lesbians, and the different intersections of these groups, have been made to stand alone and unpopular. She states, \\"For the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house. They may allow us temporarily to beat him at his own game, but they will never enable us to bring about genuine change\\". Lorde called for recognition and representation of the differences between women, in an effort to fight inequality and survival.  Poems  In \\"Equinox\\" Lorde describes events in history which coincide with events in her life. She describes that the year her daughter was born was the same year W. E. B. Du Bois died, and the same year she marched into Washington. The same year John F. Kennedy fell off a roof, she describes how her house burnt down with no one in it, and the next day Malcolm X was shot dead. She reflects on how her children talk about \\"spring and peace\\" and she wonders if they'll ever fully understand the fighting that activists and Black communities have to do in order to survive. In \\"A Conversation between Audre Lorde and Adrienne Rich\\" Lorde states, \\"That this was the most we could do, while we constructed some saner future. But that we were in that kind of peril. And here it was reality, in fact. Some of the poems-\\"Equinox\\" is one of them-come from then\\". In \\"For Each Of You\\" Lorde reinforced the idea of being proud and speaking your mind, especially for the Black community. She tells people to \\"be proud of who you are and who you will be\\", and \\"speak proudly to your children wherever you may find them\\". According to a series of interviews conducted with Lorde, this poem \\"urges women, Black women specifically, to break through their silence because it is the only way to break through to each other\\". \\"A Poem For Women in Rage\\", Lorde imagines a Black woman intending to kill a white woman waiting for her lesbian lover. Through fury and rage, Lorde confronts the issues between white and Black women and how, \\"I am weeping to learn the name of those streets my feet have worn thin with running and why they will never serve me\\". As a Black, lesbian, feminist, Lorde dealt with inequalities between how white and Black lesbians were treated in public spaces. She takes out this rage on this hypothetical person in the poem to exhibit her anger over such inequalities. \\"Sister Outsider\\" is a poem that also happens to be a book by the same name by Lorde. Lorde compares how, \\"We were born poor in a time never touching each other's hunger\\" but that now, children are raised to respect themselves and each other. She argues that while accepting and acknowledging the best parts of oneself are important, it is equally important to recognize the dark parts as well.

It is dedicated to the Christian figures of Saint Peter and Saint Paul. It was built to replace the old parish church of Saint Peter (the first church in Arese), which had become too small for the growing community. Construction began in 1880, on the initiative of the local priest Don Enrico Mora. The new church was funded, and blessed, by Monsignor Giuseppe Negri in 1882. The construction of the church was completed in 1938, and underwent re-consecration in 1982, on the occasion of the centenary of the foundation. History From the early 17th century, significant regional population growth created issues and inconveniences for church goers attending local religious functions in the city. Many of them were forced to follow the mass from outside the existing building due to the lack of space. As a consequence, the parish priest decided to give the community a larger and more functional church. Due to limited financial resources in the community, three members of the parochial vestry (Carlo Airoldi, Carlo Borghi e Carlo Minola) appointed themselves to raise funds through donations. The majority of financial funds came from local landowners and entrepreneurs who wanted to demonstrate their feelings of attachment towards the community, devotion and loyalty. The project for the new church was realized and managed by the engineer and architect Enrico Strada. The estimated cost for the work to be completed was 43 049 liras (the old Italian currency). Strada gave custody of the project to the local engineer Giuseppe Gallazzi (from Arese) and to the master builder Giuseppe Airaghi (from Passirana, Rho). Members of the local community also got involved in the project. The new church was completed in 1882 and blessed by Monsignor Giuseppe Negri. The estimated budget was surpassed, and the final cost was about 60 000 liras. Due to the limited amount of funds available, the church did not match the expectations of a part of the community. For example, the facade (the front of the church) was unfinished, the walls were not decorated, and the windows had no decorative panels. The black marble altar, which was kept from the old church, was out of proportion compared to the extended structure of the new church. More funds were necessary to carry on the project. For these reasons, in 1885, Monsignor Giuseppe Negri donated to the parish an additional 20 000 liras. This donation was used to contribute to the construction of the bell tower, which was completed in 1886, by the engineer Cesare Nava. After the building of the bell tower, a new donation was necessary to substitute the old bells, which did not conform to the church's new structure. The number of bells increased from three to five. Thanks to contributions from the community, the priest collected approximately 15 200 liras and in 1887 the bell tower and its new bells were consecrated. Architecture and decorations Central Nave of Church of St. Peter and Paul, Arese. The final decorative and executive project was assigned to the architect Zanchetta, who was inspired by the Neoclassical architecture used in Milan at that time. Zanchetta reused the classical style, inspired by Ancient Greek architecture (especially Doric and Ionic). He studied the ancient architecture and recreated a more modern and authentic style. The building evidences a dramatic use of columns. These were are not used to carry the weight of the building's structure but as a graphical and decorative element. The church has a salient structure and three aisles. The facade is an example of Neoclassical architecture: it is linear, flat, long and does not have any decorations. Painting on the left side of the altar of the church. The church is characterized by a marble altar which was sculpted by a company located in Milan in 1913. This altar is accompanied by two frescoes, made by Mario Grandi Chiodo, representing the Conversion of Paul the Apostle and Jesus handing over the keys to St. Peter. The cupola is decorated with a fresco made by Angelo Galloni in 1938 and represents the Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel, patroness of the Carmelite Order. Of particular interest is a pipe organ which is situated in the counter-front of the church, near the main entrance. In 1931, the parish priest began dealing with the decorations of the church and conceived the design of the individuals to portray on the walls near the main altar. He consulted famous painters and decorators and allocated the work to Comazzi (from Milan). The parish priest wanted Comazzi to paint two big frescos. Comazzi could not complete the work due to lack of time, and custody of the work was given to another painter, Mario Grandi. The frescos were completed in July 1931. Don Fedeli was satisfied with the work, but almost four years were necessary to repay the two painters. In 1934, some artistic glass walls were attached to the windows of the church as decorations. The Chapel In 1938, the chapel of the church was finally decorated, based on designs by the parish priest. The large fresco was painted by Gallone (from Milan) who had already painted the walls near the main altar. The cost of the work was approximately 20 000 liras. At the end of the year, when the work was completed, the community began thinking about finishing the construction of the parish church, which had begun 60 years earlier. The Square The square in front of the church is called St. Peter and Paul Square (in Italian, Piazza Ss. Pietro e Paolo). It includes buildings from the 8th century, including the reconstructed town castle (now used as council offices), and the old aristocratic ‚ÄúVilla Borghi‚Äù, which has become a cloister that houses the town's Salesian nuns order.

It is estimated that there are about 25,000 Jafarabadi buffaloes in the world. It is one of the important buffalo breeds of India and Pakistan. The Jafarabadi buffalo is also the first buffalo breed exported to Brazil, and is also one of the four buffalo breeds raised in Brazil as of 2017, the others being Mediterranean, Murrah and swamp buffalo. The Indian National Scientific Documentation Centre states that the Jafarabadi buffalo is a hybrid of the African cape buffalo and the Indian water buffalo, the former originally been brought to British India for slaughtering. The Centre notes this to be one of the major reasons for the buffalo's poor semen quality. The hybrid buffalos were widely present in Jafarabad, and were hence named as Jafarabadi buffalo.

It was originally formed in 1796 as the 24th Light Demi-Brigade, which was renamed the 44th Light Infantry Regiment and finally (in 1855) the 99th Infantry Regiment. It disbanded in 1997. It kept the traditions of the 44th Light Infantry Regiment as well as reviving the traditions and battle honours of the previous 99th Infantry Regiment which had merged into another regiment in 1803. Its motto was Ne Pas Subir and its marching song Au vieux 99, au vieux 99, tire au cul tu seras bien vu, tire au flanc tu seras content. History It was originally formed as the 24th Light Demi-Brigade in May 1796 and sent on the 1797 exp√©dition d'Irlande, in which two of its three troopships were wrecked, drowning 705 men. Augustin Pons (1774‚Äì1854) served in the 2nd formation then in 24th Light Infantry Regiment, rising from corporal to lieutenant. The unit served in 1797 at and Neuhof, in 1800 in the crossing of the Grand-Saint- Bernard, , Marcaria, Pozzolo and the siege of Verona. It was renamed the 24th Light Infantry Regiment in 1803, fighting at Nordlingen and in 1805, in 1806, , Lomitten, and in 1807 and , , , and in 1809. It took part in the French invasion of Russia and the subsequent retreat, including , , and before finally being disbanded in 1814. The regiment was re-formed in 1840 and took part in suppressing the June Days in Paris from 23 to 26 June 1848. It was renumbered as the 99th Infantry Regiment in 1855 and soon afterwards took part in the conquest of Algeria from 1855 to 1859. It formed part of 5th Corps during the 1859 Italian campaign but saw no actual fighting. Next it was put on garrison duties in Saint-Malo, Laval and Saint-Brieuc before being sent as part of the French intervention in Mexico, taking part in the siege of Puebla and the battle of Aculcingo and winning the l√©gion d‚Äôhonneur at the latter. It returned to garrison duties in Vienne and was still there on the outbreak on the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 ‚Äì it fought at on 6 August and in September, whilst three of its companies were used to form the 44th Marching Regiment, which fought at Chilleurs, Ladon, Boiscommun, Neuville-aux-Bois and Maizi√®res in the Loiret. It spent the next forty years on garrison duties at N√Æmes (1871‚Äì1873), Gap (1873), Embrun (1873), Brian√ßon (1873), Mont√©limar (1874), Vienne (1875‚Äì1885), Lyon (1875‚Äì1885), Lyon (1885‚Äì1889), Romans (1885‚Äì1889), Lyon (1889‚Äì1893), Gap (1893‚Äì1896), Mont-Dauphin (1893‚Äì1896), Lyon (1896‚Äì1902), Bourgoin (1896‚Äì1902), Gap (1902‚Äì1905), Mont-Dauphin (1902‚Äì1905), Ubaye (1902‚Äì1905), Queyras (1902‚Äì1905), Vienne (1905‚Äì1914) and Lyon (1905‚Äì1914). On mobilisation in 1914 it was based in Vienne and formed part of 55th Infantry Brigade, 28th Infantry Division and 14th Army Corps. It fought in the 1914 campaign in the Vosges and in March the following year its depot formed two companies of the new 414th Infantry Regiment. Captain F√©lix Fontan (1880‚Äì1914) was commanding its 12th Company in October 1914. Captain Jacques Lazare Olchanski (1891‚Äì1918) also served with the regiment. It fought in the 2nd Battle of Champagne in September and October 1915, at in 1916 and Chemin des Dames in 1917. In the battle of the Lys (1918) it had to hold mont Kemmel for two hours on 24 April under heavy artillery assault, then at 6am it was attacked with trench mortars by a Bavarian division. It was mobilised in September 1939 at Lyon and Modane as 99th Alpine Infantry Regiment under the command of colonel Lacaze, forming part of 28th Alpine Infantry Division on the Italian border. It was then based in northern Alsace from November 1939 to April 1940 before being rested near Poligny (Jura) before finding itself back at Chemin des Dames from 18 May 1940, twenty-three years after previously fighting there. The regiment was disbanded a few weeks later, though some of its men took part in the Ain-Jura resistance, a battle honour which was later added to its colours. The regiment re-formed in December 1944 on the Alpine front, where it took part in the recapture of the col de Larche (22‚Äì26 April 1945). In the post-war period it was sometimes a regiment and sometimes a battalion, providing men for the 25th Foot Chasseurs Battalion on its creation in June 1954 for the Tunisian campaign. In November 1954 it was converted into a Marching Regiment, the 99e BMIA, for the Algerian campaign ‚Äì under that name it briefly also stayed in Morocco in August and September 1955. On 1 October it was renamed 15th Alpine Chasseurs Battalion, marking the end of the presence of a unit numbered 99 in north Africa. What was left of the former 99th in mainland France was nicknamed the \\"neuf-neuf\\" or the \\"r√©giment de Lyon\\" and found itself demoted to training recruits for Algeria and to supporting the 8th Military Region. On 1 October 1968 it reverted to its original name of 99th Infantry Regiment and was detached from the mountain troops. In 1978 it formed a reserve regiment, the 299th Infantry Regiment. From 1982 to 1986 it provided several detachments for the fighting in Lebanon and from 1989 its 1st Combat Company was converted to special forces duties. Its last theatre of operations was Bosnia in 1992 and 1993 and the regiment was finally disbanded on 31 May 1997.

It was formed in Piedimonte D'Alife, now called Piedimonte Matese, in June 1860, and was officially established on 25 August of the same year. Membership in the legion gradually declined, and it broke apart on 3 March 1861. History The Matese Legion was an unconventional legion in that it was created after a number of Garibaldian volunteers joined together with the aim of tearing down the Bourbon power in Piedimonte and supporting the Southern Army of Garibaldi as it proceed in its advance from Sicily to Rome. 1107 Garibaldian volunteers had left Genoa to reach Sicily on 5 May 1860, guided by Garibaldi and Nino Bixio, an Italian general, as second in command. Their aim was to gain the approval of the population in order to take away power from the various insurrectionary movements in the south regions of the country. left After seeing the success that the Garibaldian campaign was having in Sicily, Beniamino Caso realized the value in creating a military troop to rebel against the Bourbon power, and in June 1860 in Piedimonte he assembled a group of liberal volunteers with the aim of overthrowing it. Originally nameless, the group was soon dubbed the Matese Legion by individuals in Turin, and the name was eventually adopted by all. On 18 August Beniamino Caso and Pasquale Casella travelled to Naples to personally pick up the weapons and the flag of the newly born legion. The two entered Piedimonte Matese the night of 24 August 1860 with the flag, 100 rifles and 12 boxes of ammunition, and the following morning the legion was officially constituted. The legion was organised into two different parties based upon the volunteers' area of origin, with the first party including the sections of Alvignano, Dragoni, S. Angelo d'Alife, Raviscanina e Piedimonte; the second one included the sections of S.Maria Capua Vetere, San Lorenzello and Calvi. From Piedimonte the legion, under the command of Major De Blasiis, departed on 31 August for Benevento. He entered the city on 3 September, welcomed by the population after having been liberated from seven centuries of pontifical rule. Throughout the period of unification, in addition to their participation in numerous battles, the legion was used to suppress brigandage and to provide public security alongside the authorities. Battles Battle of Caiazzo Between September 19 and 21, 1860, the Garibaldian armies fought against part of the Army of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in Caiazzo. The Battle began on 19 September, when the Garibaldian Column, guided by the Hungarian Csudafy, approached the town of Caiazzo. On 20 September over 300 members of the Matese Legion joined Csudafy's Army. On 21 September the legion, under Csudafy, fought unsuccessfully alongside the Garibaldian Column against the Bourbon Army, which conquered and set fire to Caiazzo. This early defeat prepared the Garibaldian Army for the following battle. Battle of Piedimonte The Garibaldian Column, guided by Csudafy, entered Piedimonte Matese on the night of 22 September 1860 to assist the legion with this battle. The Bourbon army consisted of 3000 men and 3 cannons, while the Garibaldians had only approximately 200 men. The latter were forced to find refuge in the Matese mountains, leaving the city to the enemy, who successfully conquered it on 25 September. Battle of Volturnus The Battle of the Volturnus (1860) refers to a series of military clashes between Garibaldi's volunteers and the troops of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies. It occurred around the river Volturno, in Capua, situated in the province of Caserta in northern Campania, between 26 September and 2 October 1860. The success of the Garibaldian troops in liberating Piedimonte was evidenced in the battle, where 191 volunteers of the Matese Legion participated, under the command of Major Guadagni. Battle of Isernia Following the Battle of Volturnus, the 180 surviving members of the Matese Legion prepared to return to battle against some bourbons troops that were based in Isernia. On 15 October they joined an army led by the Colonel Francesco Nullo, which consisted of 1160 volunteers. They began to move towards Isernia with the aim of conquering the city and, in this way, be the advance guard of the Garibaldian army in the region. Colonel Nullo was confident in the power of his army, but on 17 October they were defeated by the enemy, with 64 dead and 95 prisoners. The Matese Legion lost approximately thirty soldiers. End of the Matese Legion Following the end of the war for Italian Unification, all volunteers were released from service following a decree by Victor Emmanuel II. On 3 March 1861, the Matese Legion reunited for the last time in Caserta in front of the Mayor Giuliano Amato Giaquinto, in order to return their weapons. Colonel Francesco Materazzo asked the members to join the newly formed Italian army, but all declined the offer and disbanded. Significant People 179x179px The Matese Legion was founded by Beniamino Caso and Bonaventura Campagnano, who were in charge of recruiting all the volunteers in the district and in other localities within the province. The fighters recognized Beniamino Caso and Salvatore Pizzi as the leaders of the insurrectionary movement in Terra di Lavoro. Giuliano Iannotta was the Capitan of the Matese Legion, while Giuseppe de Blasiis was the Duce sent from Comitato dell'Ordine, tasked with supervising the Matese Legion. Giuliano Iannotta directed the volunteers during the Battle of Volturnus on 1 October 1860, and kept a journal detailing the events of the battle. During this battle the legion was commanded by a Florentine officer, Major Guadagno Guadagni. The established young painter Gioacchino Toma was a member of the legion. The Matese Legion Today The Matese Legion Today\\"First Matese Legion\\" is an historical Garibaldine association that commemorates the Legion by re-enacting important historical events. They stage events in cities across Italy, particularly in Rome, in order to share the history and spread awareness and knowledge the Matese Legion. The Matese Legion's flag was preserved, and is stored in the museum of Piedimonte Matese. There is a commemorative tombstone where there are the names of the most important members of the legion. This is located in the town hall and every year on 4 November the Mayor, followed by a parade, places a crown under the tombstone. The city of Piedimonte Matese is deeply entwined with legion, with many streets named after important members, such as Pietro Romagnoli and the bishop Gennaro di Giacomo, both of whom played an important role in encouraging the formation of the legion. The founder of the legion, Beniamino Caso, is commemorated in Piedimonte Matese in various ways. There is a palace which carries his name, where an epigraph testifies to the formation of the legion in this particular palace on 25 August 1860. Additionally, in San Gregorio Matese, his native town, the major square is called \\"Piazza Beniamino Caso\\".

Biography  Macquarie Lighthouse old and new removed lantern Marriage notice of Richard Siddins in 1816 Richard Siddins was born in 1770 (the exact place and date of birth is unknown) and died on 2 July 1846 in New South Wales, Australia. He travelled extensively in his work as a lighthouse keeper, merchant sailor, merchant ship's master and ship's pilot. He had three sons and nine daughters from three different wives. He had been married to Catherine Keenan (1804) and Eleanor Cooper (1809) becoming the father of William Keenan and Rebecca Cooper. On 24 April 1816 he married Jane Powell, daughter of Edward Powell, in the Church of St. Philip, Sydney. At the time Siddins was 45, while Jane was 16, although in the Church register it had been written Siddins was 35, and Jane 22. They had ten children: Ann J, Joseph, Mary, Jane, Isabella, Thomas, Elizabeth, Ellen, Maria A. and Sophia Siddins. At the end of 1807 he became master of the King George; later he was employed as captain of the Campbell Macquarie by the ship-owner Joseph Underwood. This vessel was a 248-ton full-rigged ship, built at Kolkata, India. It was the first known shipwreck on Macquarie Island, when sailors were marooned for four months during 1812 with the loss of four Indian crew members. In 1823 Richard applied for the position of harbour pilot in Sydney. The couple's son Joseph was born the following year. He became superintendent of the South Head Lighthouse (also called Macquarie Lighthouse) in 1832. In 1804 he arrived in Port Jackson aboard a British whaler. From 1804 to 1824 he had been on many voyages around the Pacific Ocean and Southern Oceans and north to the Indies, Kolkata and Canton, first as mate or captain and later as part-owner of his ship. Some details can be extrapolated from several books on his adventurous life and Australian maritime commerce. In the book Richard Siddins of Port Jackson,Richard Siddins of Port Jackson, Edition 38 di Roebuck Society publication, Author Lyndon Rose, , 9780909434298 Lyndon Rose describes the details of the journeys by the small band of sea hunters in the first years of Australia's international trade. Siddins worked mainly for the Port Jackson merchants Lord, Kable and Underwood, ex-convicts who made their fortunes building Australia's export-import trade. In it there are some illustrations about Siddins' journeys but the author could find no likeness of Richard Siddins. In The Canberra Times Helen Brown, reviewing Lyndon Rose's book, stated that there is no account of Siddins's life before he arrived in Port Jackson, The book Letter from Charles R. Siddins to H.F. Norrie, 1857 are letters that Siddin's grandson wrote to Harold F. Norrie. Norrie was a public servant who held several posts, including Secretary of the Sydney Harbour Trust, commissioner of the South Head Trust, and alderman of Vaucluse Council. The letters confirm that Captain Siddins built the Greenwich Pier (or Vaucluse Hotel) and after his death his son Joseph succeeded him as superintendent of the South Head lighthouse. He was claimed as possibly the most important captain in the history of exploration from the book Log-Books and Journals with maps and illustrations by Ida Lee F.R.G.S and Hon. F.R.A.H.S. :  Voyages  Campbell Macquarie crew list Richard Siddins was one of the earliest and best known merchant sea captains sailing out of Port Jackson. From 1804 to 1822 Siddins helped reap the vast harvest of seals and sandalwood on behalf of the Sydney traders. He took cargoes to China and India for them, and brought back Asian goods for the colonial stores. After many adventures in the Pacific and having survived the shipwreck of Macquarie Island, he became the Port Jackson pilot and later superintendent of the South Head Lighthouse. Richard Siddins arrived in Australia, to New South Wales, in 1804 aboard the English whaler Alexander. For many years he took part in trading voyages to Kolkata and the islands of the South Seas. He was in Port Jackson in 1806 aboard the King George and at the end of 1807 he brought cargoes of sandalwood, seal oil and seal furs to Port Jackson. From 1809 to 1815 Siddins was in the Fiji Islands. In Sydney, 1811, Siddins was employed by ship owner Joseph Underwood as Captain of the Campbell Macquarie. In 1811 and in 1812 Siddins returned to India on the Campbell Macquarie and later in that year arrived in Port Jackson with prisoners and a cargo of spirits. Soon after he again set out on the Campbell Macquarie on a sealing voyage to the South seas. They called at Kangaroo Island and collected seal skins and salt, then headed for Macquarie Island. He and his crew ended up being shipwrecked in Hasselborough Bay on 11 June 1812, and at least four of the castaways died. Twelve of them were rescued by the Perseverance, a ship that had arrived at Macquarie Island to collect a gang of sealers in October 1812. Joseph Underwood sent the ship Elizabeth and Mary to the Island to rescue the remaining crew. When Siddins landed on Macquarie island in 1812, he met the Russian explorer Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen there. Richard Siddins returned to Sydney on 20 January with 1700 skins and rigging form the wreck of the Campbell Macquarie. From 1814 Lyndon Rose, with his book Richard Siddins of Port Jackson, has set down his story as a tribute to his contribution to the trade out of Port Jackson in the early days of the Colony.  Bibliography  There are at least three books about Richard Siddins life and adventures: * Letter from Charles R. Siddins to H.F. Norrie, undated, with newscutting, 1857 * Richard Siddins of Port Jackson / by Lyndon Rose. * Richard Siddins pocket book and letter, 1815-1878 Letter from Charles R. Siddons concerning the career of his grandfather, Captain Richard Siddons, and his father Joseph Siddins. The letter states that Captain Siddins built the home which later became the Greenwich Pier or Vaucluse Hotel. His son Joseph succeeded him as superintendent of the South Head lighthouse. Also included is a newscutting of the poem 'The Wreck of the Dunbar' by George Ferris Pickering, which features the role of the dog of Joseph Siddins in the discovery of the shipwreck. The second one doesn't have the direct purpose to tell Siddins adventures but to describe how international trade was carried out in 1770 century. The last one is a pocket book, being an interleaved copy of the New South Wales pocket almanac for 1816 containing MS memoranda and tallies, and a set of letters that came from Sarah Wentworth to Mrs Siddins from Vaucluse, N.S.W., 6 February 1878. Death In 1832, he was compelled by ill health to exchange his situation as pilot with the superintendent of the South Head lighthouse. He died on 2 July 1846, aged 76. His wife died on 9 February 1883, and was buried at Richmond cemetery and his son, Joseph Richard (1823‚Äì1891), became a pilot at South Head.

Early life and education  Ingram was born in Dublin, Ireland, the son of a linen draper, and brought up in London. He first traveled to West Africa in 1822, working in Senegal as a shop boy before moving to Bathurst, the Gambia.  Merchant and government career  Ingram initially worked in Bathurst for a British merchant, Edward Bocock. However, he soon entered colonial service as first writer in the colonial secretary's office in 1826. He returned to trade, initially with success, but by the early 1830s he had fallen into debt and returned to government employment. In April 1834, he was appointed as director of the Liberated Africans Department. Following the yellow fever epidemic of April 1837, which killed George Rendall, the Lieutenant Governor, and Andrew Hunter, the Colonial Secretary, Anthony Clogstoun became the acting Lieutenant Governor. Clogstoun appointed Ingram as the acting Colonial Secretary. Ingram was also simultaneously appointed as the acting Queen's Advocate, due to the lack of European officials. When William Mackie, then-Lieutenant Governor, died in September 1839, Ingram became the acting Lieutenant Governor. Ingram reverted to being Colonial Secretary when Henry Huntley arrived in April 1840 but took over government again when Huntley departed in May 1841. Ingram retained the post until the first Governor of the Gambia arrived in April 1843, Henry Seagram. Ingram became acting Governor after Seagram's death in August 1843, serving until Charles FitzGerald arrived in August 1844. During the early 1840s, Ingram clashed with British merchants in the Gambia, including Thomas Brown and John Hughes. Brown and Hughes accused Ingram of exerting official pressure on the courts through his younger brother, Alexander, who was a judge, and his friend, John Mantell, who was the Queen's Advocate. Ingram was passed over as Governor proper by Richard Graves MacDonnell in 1847. His relationship with the governor frayed, and in 1849 he wrote to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Earl Grey, to investigate MacDonnell's conduct. However, Grey dismissed him in September 1849 for mishandling public accounts, ending Ingram's public career. Rather than returning to England, Ingram stayed in the Gambia and turned to trade. However, on a visit to England in 1860, he was declared bankrupt. He returned to the Gambia, finally leaving in 1866. He died in 1868.  Personal life and life  Ingram's younger brother, Alexander, joined the Gambian administration in the early 1840s, serving as Queen's Advocate, then Assistant Judge, then a clerk in the Customs Department, before drowning in 1849. Ingram's son, Thomas Lewis Ingram, went on to have an illustrious legal career. He was appointed as Queen's Advocate and Police Magistrate in the Gambia in April 1863. He was called to the bar in England in 1867, and went on to serve as a successful barrister in West Africa and India. This Ingram had three children. The eldest, also named Thomas Lewis Ingram, was a barrister of Middle Temple who in 1909 married Lilian Donnithorne. His third child was James Skinner Ingram, who was also a barrister of Middle Temple. In 1909, he married Loveday Isabel Donnithorne, the sister of Lilian. In 1912, his daughter, Victoria Catherine Ingram, married Harold Edward Donnithorne, the brother of Lilian and Loveday. Thomas Lewis Ingram, as a captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps, was killed in France on 16 September 1916. He had been awarded the Military Cross and the Distinguished Service Order.

It was written in October 1917 in Craiglockhart, a suburb in the south-west of Edinburgh (Scotland), while the author was recovering from shell shock in the trenches, inflicted during World War I. The poet died one week before the Armistice of Compi√®gne, which ended the conflict on the Western Front (November 1918).  History  The poem was first published in 1983 as part of The Complete Poems and Fragments. The original manuscript can now be found in The English Faculty Library at the University of Oxford (St. Cross Building, Manor Road OX2 6NN). In this manuscript it is possible to see Owen's self made corrections: notes, additions and edits. The original version of the poem is different from the published one. In particular there are dissimilarities in the syntactic and lexical structure. For example, in the original script it is written Christ whereas in the published version, the verse reads \\" Kind Jesus . Another difference can be evidenced in the second verse which the author eventually changed: initially he wrote Made a permanent stoppage in all bolts , then he changed it to Caused a permanent stoppage in all bolts .  Themes  The main theme of Wilfred Owen‚Äôs Soldier's Dream is the pity of war that he communicates through the image of Jesus smiling kindly. The poet wanted to represent the atrocity of warfare which is why the first stanza is mainly a list of weapons that were used in World War I. Soldier's Dream is a reflection of the author‚Äôs feelings about the time he passed in the trenches; unlike other war poets such as Rupert Brooke (author of The Soldier), who did not participate in military actions, Owen had an active role in the conflict. In this poem, the poet represents war as a dreadful parenthesis in human history. He believes that its only purpose is to divide families, friends, and countries. The poem adopts a neutral perspective and does not take anyone's side. It does not state who the enemy is. This means that for the author war is unrighteous no matter which country the soldiers are fighting for or why (\\"And there were no more bombs, of ours or Theirs\\"). In the author's opinion war does no good, it is useless and simply unjustifiable. One of the key elements of Owen's conception of poetry is the duty of the poet of being truthful, realistic and inspired by experiences. In the preface of Poems, published posthumously, he wrote: \\"My subject is war, and the pity of war./ The Poetry is in the pity./ Yet these elegies are to this generation in no sense consolatory. They may be to the next. All a poet can do today is warn. That is why the true Poets must be truthful.\\"  Title  The poet uses a first person narrator to describe the soldier's experience of the dream. This leads the audience to identify the protagonist with the author, a hypothesis strengthened by the fact that Owen himself was a soldier and that he shared his own dreams with the reader in other works (for instance in his poems Strange Meeting, Exposure and Dulce et Decorum est). It has been stated that the poem indicates that the desire for the end of the war does not belong only to the author or only to one soldier, specifically in the first World War, but is shared by all the soldiers of all the world. The poem ‚ÄúSoldier‚Äôs Dream‚Äù may have been inspired by a popular contemporary World War I song ‚ÄúA soldiers Dream‚Äù. The title closely matches Thomas Campbell‚Äôs \\"The Soldier‚Äôs Dream\\" (1804) written during the Crimean War to address the reading public‚Äôs anxieties and expectations about the welfare of the common soldier.  Symbols  \\"By creating a simple image of the weapons of war and their destruction followed by the image of their reinstatement, Owen creates a powerful picture of the pro- and anti-war lobbies of his time\\". * All the weapons destroyed by Jesus represent the army encountered by Owen on the Western Front during World War I. * The tears and smiles of Jesus symbolize all the people that protested against the war. * God sends Michael, the Archangel who leads the Heavenly army, to overthrow the fate of war. Michael reflects the establishment‚Äôs support of death and destruction. * Just as the weapons are both literal and symbolic, so is the dream. The dreaming and the awakening from the dream stand for all the hopes and dreams of Owen and his comrades in the midst of the seemingly unending carnage of war.  Structure  This poem is written entirely in quatrains and each of the two stanzas is divided into four verses. The poet's choice of the ABBA rhyme scheme (or enclosed rhyme scheme) emphasizes the simplicity of the poem. The pararhyme of 'Theirs', ‚Äògears‚Äô, ‚Äòtears‚Äô and ‚Äòrepairs‚Äô combines the two quatrains together and puts 'Theirs' (take note of the capital letter) at the heart of the poem.  Style  In this poem Owen uses the modern form and language typical of the war poets: the realistic and colloquial language a common soldier might use, to express a strong anti-war message. His poetry (and war poets' poetry in general) is a negation of Georgian poetry which belonged to the pre-war society. The former describes the daily experience of soldiers on the front with realistic and shocking images and language (an excellent example is given by Owen's poem Dulce et Decorum est), in order to show how brutal and meaningless war really is; the latter uses a very bombastic and artificial poetry, intending to present war as a noble affair. The tone of the poem is melancholic because the soldier misses peace. In the first stanza, the humanity of tone is given by the description of a \\"kind\\" Jesus, and of his \\"tears\\" and \\"smile\\". This tone contrasts with Jesus' act of destroying the weapons of war. In the second stanza, the initial peaceful tone describes how every weapon has been destroyed on either side and contrasts with the penultimate line where God repairs the reality of war, a change introduced by the preposition \\"but\\" at the start of the line. The poet uses harsh consonants and alliterations to draw attention to the weapons and to stress their power to hurt. Several applications of this device compare in the poem: the alliteration of ‚Äòg‚Äô in the ‚Äògun gears‚Äô; of 'b', in ‚Äòbig‚Äô / ‚Äòbolts‚Äô / ‚Äòbuckled‚Äô / ‚Äòbayonet‚Äô / ‚Äòbombs‚Äô; of ‚Äòp‚Äô in ‚Äòpermanent stoppage‚Äô / ‚Äòpikel‚Äô / ‚Äòpower‚Äô; and the sounds ‚Äòt‚Äô and ‚Äòk‚Äô in ‚Äòbolts‚Äô / ‚ÄòColts‚Äô / ‚Äòbayonet‚Äô / ‚Äòflint lock‚Äô / ‚Äòpikel‚Äô.

The two attackers wanted to avenge the death of a man from their town who was shot and killed by Israeli police as he was a part of a group of three who killed an Israeli policewoman at Jerusalem's Damascus Gate in February 2016. Attack On October 4, 2017, the day prior to the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, the body of Shmerling was found. After Shmerling was unable to be reached by phone, his family decided to go to his work in order to check on him. Shmerling's body was found in a building he owned, by his son, leading police to believe he was killed by one of his Arab employees. The day following the murder, initial reports suspected that the killing was the result of a monetary dispute, however this was later changed to a suspected terrorist attack. On October 8, 4 days after Shmerling's body was found, two Palestinians from the Arab village of Kabatiya in the West Bank were arrested for the murder. Following the arrest, the Shin Bet stated that details of the attack are under a gag order, however it was being investigated as a terror attack. On October 15, Shmerling was officially declared a victim of terror. Kamil and Al ARoub claim that they planned and carried out the murder of Shmerling in revenge for a friend, Ahmad Abu Al-Roub, who was killed while attempting to carry out a stabbing attack at the Jalameh Crossing during the 2017 Temple Mount crisis. On November 13, video footage was released of Shmerling arriving at the site, and one of the alleged murderers picking up a pick ax. They entered Israel illegally, and began working without work permits for Reuven Shmerling's son in his warehouse, living at the warehouse where they worked. They purchased a large knife and kept it hidden under their mattress. On the day of the murder, the two used a ruse to lure Shmerling to the room they lived in. Kamil got behind shmerling and stabbed him with the knife while he tried to defend himself with a chair and Al-Roub attacked him with a chair while Kamil continued to stab the older man with a knife. Kamil filmed the victim lying on the ground in his own blood before the two fled with the help of an accomplice. Blook identified as belonging to Kamil and Al-Roub was found on the fan and knife used as murder weapons. The two had also posted their intentions on Facebook. Suspects The Palestinian news agency Ma'an News Agency named the two suspects as Youssef Khaled Mustafa Kamil, (20), (alt.: Yousif Khaled Kmai, alt.: Yousef Kmeil), and Mohammed Zeyad Abu al-Rob (19) (alt.: Mohammad Abu al-Rub). On Friday, 6 October, Israeli Defense Forces searched the homes of both suspects in Qabatiya. Following their arrest, both suspects admitted to killing Shmerling, with a pickax, knife and fan. Protests erupted in Qabatiya during the searches of suspects homes. On the night of the 25th, the Israeli military notified the family of Mohammad Abu al-Rub, one of the alleged perpetrators, that their house is slated for demolition.DEFENSE MINISTRY TO DEMOLISH HOME OF SCHMERLING-MURDER TERRORIST, JPost, DANIEL K. EISENBUD, 26 October 2017 On November 1, additional suspected accomplices were arrested from Qabatiya. Legal proceedings The two suspects were indicted on 29 October in Lod District Court on charges of entering Israel illegally and premeditated murder. The charges read: \\"The accused caused the death of the deceased with the intention of killing a Jew because he is Jewish, and because they were angry at him for their work conditions,\\" ... \\"they attacked, stabbed and beat the deceased 70-year-old with a sharp implement, until he laid bleeding on the floor of the room, without moving, and then, in cold blood, showered, changed their clothes, and left the place.\\" Victim Shmerling, was married to his wife Chana, was a father of 4, and owned a coal business. Shmerling was a direct descendant of the Alter Rebbe, Shneur Zalman of Liadi. A total of 1,200 people attended his funeral. On October 15, Shmerling's family was visited by Israel's President Reuven Rivlin. Two days later they were visited by Israeli Arabs, including Kfar Qasim mayor Adel Badir and MK Issawi Frej, and Jewish MK Nissan Slomiansky. Related attack The two perpetrators claimed to be avenging a man from their hometown who was killed when he and two other Palestinian men carried out a terrorist attack on 3rd February 2016, killing Hadar Cohen (19) of Or Yehuda, an Israeli Magav policewoman. Cohen and two fellow officers approached two Palestinians seated on a bench near the Damascus Gate, and asked for their identity papers. One of the men stood up and stabbed one of the women officers (20) seriously wounding her, and Cohen shot him dead. A second man pulled out an improvised \\"carlo\\" submachine gun and starting shooting. A third Palestinian appeared and shot Cohen dead with a bullet to the head. Police in the area opened fire and killed all three. A third man was lightly injured. The three men were Ahmad Rajeh Ismail Zakarneh (20/21), Muhammad Ahmad Hilmi Kamil (20/21), and Najeh Ibrahim Abu al-Rub (alt.: al-Roub) (20/21) from the village of Qabatiya. All three had previously been barred by the Shin Bet from entering Israel.

Early life Born in Franklin, Vermont, Babcock moved with his family to Waukesha, Wisconsin in 1846. In 1849 they moved again to Neenah, Wisconsin, his father had gotten a contract to excavate and construct the Neenah portion of the Fox-Wisconsin Waterway. At age 12 he became a child laborer in his father's project, thus bringing an end to Babcock's education. Following his mother's death in 1851 and the completion of the waterway project in 1852, Babcock found work as a box boy at a local dry goods store where he also slept at night, as his widowed father had begun farming with a new wife six miles from town. At age 16 Babcock was promoted to clerk, in which he achieved notable success selling dress goods to women. In 1857 due to his success in sales, the wealthy father of his friend John A. Kimberly set the two young men up as equal partners in the Kimberly & Babcock Dry Goods Store, providing them with $5,000 in new goods. The business was an immediate success, and while still only in their teens, the partnership was quickly recognized as a formidable teaming of talent, leading to directorships with the newly organized First National Bank of Neenah (what is today Associated Banc-Corp), and to the construction in 1869 of the Reliance Mill, the largest flour mill constructed in Neenah, which helped make it the second largest flour milling center in the state behind Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In 1876 Babcock became a financial partner in the founding of the Bergstrom Brothers Stove Works under the direction of D. W. Bergstrom, a former clerk at Kimberly & Babcock. At the time of his death Babcock was planning to be a partner in the founding of the Bergstrom Paper Company. Kimberly-Clark Shortly after the Reliance Mill was up and running, Kimberly became interested in the manufacture of paper, and on the strength of his partnership with Babcock the two men brought together a group of investors to form a joint stock company. After several unsuccessful attempts at organization with a changing roster of players, the large number of prospective shareholders was cut down to four equal partners: Kimberly, Babcock, Charles B. Clark, and Franklyn C. Shattuck. Organized as Kimberly, Clark & Company in 1872, their guiding principle was that they would function as an interchangeable yet complementary team of players, much in the same way Kimberly and Babcock had in their dry goods business. Initially, however, construction of a mill and the operational start up were undertaken by Kimberly and Clark. Shattuck continued operation of his Chicago-based wholesaling business, while Babcock took charge of the businesses he held in partnership with Kimberly. These arrangements lasted only until 1878 when the company undertook a major expansion in neighboring Appleton, Wisconsin. At this point the dry goods store was sold to help finance the expansion. Clark had begun a political career, Babcock and Shattuck took on active roles in daily operations. Incorporated in 1880 as Kimberly & Clark Co., Babcock was named vice-president and resumed the close partnership with Kimberly that had launched both their careers. In the decade that followed the company pursued an aggressive program of expansion at mill sites along the Fox River, concluding in 1890 at De Pere, Wisconsin with the Shattuck & Babcock Paper Mill, the largest producer of fine writing papers in the U.S. As a result of these efforts Kimberly & Clark transformed the surrounding valley into one of the leading centers of paper production in the U.S. By the turn of the century both Clark and Shattuck had died, and soon afterwards Kimberly retired to Redlands, California, leaving Babcock as the only original partner on site during a period of violent labor strikes and a protracted lawsuit brought against Kimberly & Clark and other paper manufacturers under the Sherman Antitrust Act. The strain of these years contributed to Babcock's death in 1905 at a Winnetka, Illinois sanitarium, where he had been taken by his family to recover his health. The importance of Babcock's role in the company's founding was recognized in 2015 when he was inducted into the Paper Industry International Hall of Fame, maintained by the Paper Discovery Center in the former Atlas Mill, built during Babcock's vice presidency. Personal life Babcock (who was a devout Presbyterian) early success in dry goods was due in part to his physical attributes. In the decades before the Civil War women did not generally shop in public except in dry goods stores, a fact which New York's Alexander Turney Stewart turned into one of history's largest personal fortunes by hiring handsome young men to clerk in his Manhattan department store. Babcock, standing six feet tall with the brooding good looks of a Midwestern Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights), similarly assisted a dedicated following of local women in adapting current fashions to flatter their personal attributes. Best known among his followers was the wife of territorial governor James Duane Doty. A voracious reader in spite of his limited education, and possessed of artistic sensibilities, Babcock was also a talented tenor and soloist in his church choir. He initially hoped to marry his partner's sister, Emma Kimberly, but when she rejected his proposal Babcock turned his attentions to their cousin Frances Kimberly, a graduate of the Emma Willard School, and upon whom he called at her home in Watervliet, New York while in the East buying goods for the store. The two married in 1872, and on their wedding tour visited Babcock's cousin Orville E. Babcock, the personal secretary of Ulysses S. Grant who was later indicted in the Whiskey Ring. Together the Babcocks raised five children: Helen, Caroline, Henry, George and Elizabeth. Although it pained him to be separated from them, all five became graduates of Eastern colleges, his daughter Caroline also studying sculpture under Daniel Chester French at his studio in Manhattan, and later at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. A great hunter and fisherman, Babcock encouraged a taste for the out-of-doors in his children, taking them and their friends on annual camping parties at Eagle River, Wisconsin. His interests as a genealogist, music lover and Anglophile were similarly shared with his children, all but one of them as adults still living at home at his death in 1905. Three of Babcock's children subsequently married and only two had children, his granddaughter Anne becoming the wife of Theodore Roosevelt III. Those children that remained in Neenah were either founders or major contributors to the YWCA, the Boys' Brigade, Theda Clark Hospital, the Bergstrom-Mahler Museum, the Emergency Society, Oak Hill Cemetery, the First Presbyterian Church and the Visiting Nurse Association. More than 100 years since his death, Babcock's Bible study class - which was composed entirely of women - still meets at the First Presbyterian Church of Neenah and is known today as the Friends Class. Havilah Babcock House In addition to his association with the founding of Kimberly-Clark Corporation, Babcock is known for his role in the construction and decoration of the Havilah Babcock House. Upon the sale of the dry goods store in 1878, Babcock focused his creativity on the construction of a family home on Neenah's East Wisconsin Avenue. The land was purchased in 1879, after which William Waters (architect) of neighboring Oshkosh, Wisconsin drew up the plans for a Queen Anne residence. Construction commenced in 1881 with Babcock acting as construction manager, personally selecting tiles, stained glass, woodwork and furnishings in Milwaukee, Chicago and New York City. Two years later, while the newly incorporated Kimberly & Clark was building a third mill in Appleton, the family moved in with the interior still largely bare plaster walls. Ultimately the first house in Neenah fitted with electricity (the Kimberly & Clark generator serving as the power source), the interior decoration was completed under Babcock's watchful eye in 1888, with the parlor carefully replicating decorations he and his wife had seen and admired at the Centennial Exhibition in 1876. At the time William Morris, Charles Eastlake, Henry Hudson Holly and other leaders of the Aesthetic Movement were encouraging the use of instructive narratives in fireplace tiles, advice which Babcock subtly extended to whole rooms through his choices not only of tiles but stained glass, wall coverings, and even the placement of selected paintings and objet d'art. Principal among the stories were those of the Etruscan goddess Pomona (mythology) and William Morris' \\"The Defence of Guenevere,\\" both of which challenge the conventional roles and identities of men and women, and which taken together Babcock wove into a devotional to the love he and his wife Frances shared. Their daughters Helen and Elizabeth, who inherited the house upon their mother's death in 1917, were unaware of these narratives but were loath to change anything their father had done. As a result, the Havilah Babcock House remains almost exactly as it was at Babcock's death. It is today held in a family trust, with the current occupants being Babcock's great- grandson Peter Adams and his wife, Patricia Mulvey.The Babcock House The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. With . In 2010 it was identified by the Wisconsin Historical Society as one of the 20 most important homes in the state, along with Frank Lloyd Wright's Wingspread, Milwaukee's Pabst Mansion, and Ten Chimneys, the home of Broadway legends Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne. The designation served as the basis of the Wisconsin Historical Society Press book, \\"Wisconsin's Own,\\" by Louis Wasserman and Caron Connelly. Six of these homes, including the Havilah Babcock House, were featured in the 2015 Wisconsin Public Television documentary, \\"Remarkable Homes of Wisconsin.\\" See also *John A. Kimberly *Charles B.

The Genebank is in a collaboration with the Australian Seed Bank Partnership on an Australian Crop Wild Relatives project. It is located at Grains Innovation Park, in Horsham, Victoria, Australia. Objectives and challenges The Australian Grains Genebank (AGG) aims to collect and conserve the seeds of Australian crop wild species, that are not yet adequately represented in existing collections. 40 key species of crop wild, 32 of which are endemic to Australia, have been identified as being crucial to increasing Australia's stock of grain crops. Seeds of crop wild relatives (CWR) will be available to plant breeders and researchers in order to develop the plant varieties of the future. The seeds will be stored not only in the Australian Grains Genebank but also in the Australian Seed Bank Partnership member seed banks. This project will enable research into new plant varieties, that are vital to Australia's agricultural future. Progress can be made in understanding the genetic material contained in the crops. One of the main objectives of the Australian Grains Genebank is helping the research; for this reason, this institution distributes about 25,000 packets of seeds to scientists in Australia and overseas. Therefore, they can evaluate this material for characteristics that could be used to breed more productive grain crops. These characteristics include the resistance to heat, frost, drought, pests and diseases. Another fact about Australian Grains Genebank is that it uses a DNA-based soil testing service, to assist grain growers in predicting the losses from various diseases before a crop is planted. Growers have the option of changing cultivars or modifying cropping programs, in situations where the risk of crop loss is high. The service was launched in 1997 and the initial focus was on grain and barley, but pathogens of rotation crops are now included.  Facilities  In 2009 the Victorian Government provided $3 million to Sally Norton, leader of the Australian Grains Genebank to make the bank, also promising $600,000 per year for the next five years toward operating costs. The bank was officially opened in March, 2014. The budget is provided by the Government of Victoria and the Grains Research and Development Corporation, a corporation that is supported by the Government of Australia. The AGG is a national seed store bank completed by H2o architects, on the Wimmera flatland at the edge of Horsham, Victoria, for the Victorian Department of Environment and Primary Industries. The facility has more than 2.7 kilometres of space to give a secure store for seed specimens. The building is also used for seed development, seed requests and contains a packaging and receiving area, administration areas, drying facilities, freezers working at -20 degrees Celsius and a multipurpose national reception area, or lobby, to accommodate visiting groups. A double skin freezer design has an inner esky box of isolated panels, used for storing seeds and contained within an outer wood clad weather protecting cover. This design makes certain that the freezers work with less charge, reduce the energy consumption and operating costs of the facility. Efficiency is reached with a robust and environmentally responsible mechanical system. The building has a strong presence and provides innovation in design, technology and materials. The exterior layer is very similar to a pergola, with thousands of timber slats, each one 120 centimetres long, creating the top layer. Storage conditions and regeneration Wheat Ear milk full The Horsham bank is the biggest of its kind and is designed for long-term storage. The material they conserve includes released crop varieties, breeding materials, and crop wild relatives. It serves not only producers but also processors, marketers, breeders and regional farming communities. Peter Walsh, the Victorian Minister of Agriculture, explained that the bank could contain about 300 million seeds from all around the globe. The bank has the capacity to hold 200,000 packets of seeds and more than 200 different crop species. In 2017 the collection held about 138,016 different seeds (or assessions), and it is growing about 3000 seeds each year. The most representative crop names stored are: *Wheat with 42,624 different species coming from different areas of the world, mainly from Europe, Australia and Africa. *Barley with 19,062 different types, mainly from Europe and Central Asia. *Chickpea with 9,771 different breeds, coming from Australia, Africa, Europe and Asia Minor. *Pea with about 7,558 different categories, principally coming from Europe, the United States, South America and Australia. *Lentil with 5,061 different species, coming from Asia Minor, Central Asia, Europe and Africa. The seed drying room operates at 15 degrees Celsius and 15% of humidity. Seeds remain in this room form four to six weeks to dry down to around 6% seed moisture before being sealed into foil packets and placed under long-term storage at -20 degrees Celsius. AGG routinely conduct seed viability monitoring tests because seeds lose their ability to germinate, even under long-term conditions. Once seed germination drops below 85%, and the seed quantity they have in the store is below 500 seeds, the genebank regenerates the seed. They regenerate around 4000 different samples per year under field and greenhouse environments. When they regenerate seeds, they consider the biology of the plants to ensure the right soil mix, temperatures, control pollination for outcrossing species. Longevity In order to keep the seeds safe, they are stored in 2.7 kilometres of shelf space at -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit) with very low moisture. The seeds can remain viable for 50 or 100 years (depending on the kind of seed), preserving, in this way, the genetic materials. left The primary reason for the bank to be created was the extreme temperatures in the area, up to 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in the summertime. Because of that, they had to ensure the protection of the grains all year around. The longevity of seeds differs; some keep well for decades, crops are grown out regularly and new grains assembled to increase the collection. A database carries the information about the origin and characteristics of each seed line (none genetically modified) and features of seed viability and the quantity held. Seeds are placed in controlled maturing environments with high temperatures and a certain humidity (RH; 45 ¬∞C and 60% RH). The Lithium chloride (LiCl) helps to obtain the right RH environment. The seed survival curve, that can be acquired from the germination test, is compared with the longevity of ‚Äòmarker‚Äô species aged under the same conditions. From here, longevity categories can be distinguished: this is most important for alpine seeds, as recent proofs show that grains from cooler and wetter habitats are shorter lived than seeds from warmer ones. Longevity checks can also indicate how seeds should be conserved.  Australian Seed Bank Partnership The main goal of the Australian Seed Bank Partnership is to save about 1700 native species of plant and ecological communities facing extinction due to habitat loss, and the fragmentation and degradation of invasive species. To accomplish this objective, the partnership maintains a safe and sustainable environment, and collects and stores seeds to help research on the subject. Genebank's seeds The Australian Grains Genebank is one of the most important members of the Australian Seed Bank Partnership, which is an alliance between 12 organizations that are trying to deal with the multitude of threats facing Australian biodiversity by working together. The partnership consists of nine seeds banks, that are storing and conserving seeds, and three flora-focused organizations, that have the mission not only to fulfill the gap between policymakers, researcher, and seed collectors, but also to manage the on-ground conservation and restoration activities. The activities related to the Australian Seed Bank Partnership consist of four simple concepts: collecting, research, supporting restoration and sharing knowledge. * Collecting: the process of collection and conservation of the native seeds is carried out by organizations, non-profit institutions and community groups, that are working together to provide a future-proof insurance policy for Australian's unique seed flora, which is particularly important in time of environmental stress. One of the main activities, in the field of collecting and storing seeds, involves the coordination of seasonal seeds collecting fields trips. Some experts, in fact, follow a rigid protocol to recognize, collect, clean and store seeds. The experts have also the important task of recording the information (such as the time of the year the seed has been collected, the associated vegetation and the soil type in the seed-collecting region) and the principal characteristics of the seed. Those information are considered fundamental to the seed banks' future rule in conservation. * Research: to keep the collected seeds available for a long time and under controlled conditions, the research process is a central concept. To store a seed properly the researcher must establish what is required by each category or type of seed (for example if they require a specific temperature or if it needs light and moisture cues to germinate). * Supporting Restoration: one of the most important activities in which the Australian Seed Bank Partnership is involved, is the recording of all the data about Australian native crops. This process is considered that important because it informs the restoration of plant communities and landscapes. In order to achieve this objective, the Australian Seed Bank Partnership applies the scientific knowledge to the field and shares it with the restoration community. This institution, thanks to this process, has already saved a lot of Australian native plants, discovered new species and rediscovered species that they thought to be extinct in the wild. * Sharing knowledge: The Australian Seed Bank Partnership shares his knowledge among all the existing Australian conservation seed banks, restoration practitioners, and community groups. By sharing this knowledge, they hope to build a greater understanding of seed science in Australia. The Australian Grains Genebank is related to the Australian Seed Bank Partnership. They are actually collaborating on an Australian Crop Wild Relatives project. Through this project, these two institutions are trying to store all the Australian crop wild relatives, that are not yet represented in the ex-suit collection. The 32 wild crop species will be stored and preserved on the facilities of the Australian Grains Genebank. This project is considered really important, because saving and storing the wild crops will enable researchers into new plant varieties, that will be important for the future and the development of the Australian agriculture.

The first Sanitary Fair was held in Chicago from October 27 to November 7, 1863. The first Metropolitan Fair was announced by the New York Times on January 1, 1864, to be held on March 28th of that year However, the event was postponed to the 4th of April and it resulted in the largest Sanitary Fair ever which raised over a million dollars for the Union cause. Sanitary Fair's history Henry Whitney Bellows-President of Sanitary Commission The name \\"Sanitary Fair\\" was coined after the success of the big bazaars that took place in Chicago and shortly after in Boston during the winter of 1863-1864. In November 1863 the President of the United States Sanitary Commission, Dr. Henry Whitney Bellows, wrote on a paper called \\"Rough Hints\\" the main principles that needed to be applied to hold a fair in New York. It stated: View in Santary Fair, N.Y.C. Metropolitan Fair Building - NARA - 526151 To be Metropolitan, the Fair must be: # On a National scale ‚Äî its magnitude and results worthy of the occasion, the place, and the necessity. # It must be universal. Enlisting all sympathies from the highest to the lowest; democratic, without being vulgar; elegant, without being exclusive; fashionable, without being frivolous; popular, without being mediocre. In short, it must be inspired from the higher classes but animate, include, and win the sympathies and interest of all classes. To accomplish this, it must be diversified, various, many-sided: everybody must can do and buy something. It is important to gratify the sober and to please the gay, to meet the views and approbation of the serious and utilitarian, while catching the eyes, the tastes, and the proclivities of the young, the light-hearted, the thoughtless, and the frivolous. It must have the support of our good people, our rich people, our fashionable people, our politicians, our civic fathers, our clergy, Chamber of Commerce, police, fire department, trades-unions, and all the great industrial establishments. These suggestions were accepted during a meeting between approximately fifty or sixty ladies, held at the Union League Club House, on November 21, 1863. They started to work on the project and elected an Executive Board consisting of twenty-five ladies, who acted in connection with an Advisory Committee of twenty-five gentlemen, appointed by the Sanitary Committee on December 11. A prospectus was made and different committees were appointed to represent, to invite through advertisements and letters, and to collect contributions from trade and business interests in New York. The Twenty Second Regiment Armory, a square building of two hundred feet, was chosen to be the site of the Fair, but because of the great amplitude of the growing Fair, other buildings were put up in front of the Armory, on Fourteenth and Fifteenth Street, in the Union Square and on Broadway Avenue and Fourth Avenue thanks to the Building Committee and the faith and hard work of some Ladies. The Mayor of the city, Charles Godfrey Gunther, on April 2, in view of the important occasion arisen from the humanitarian labor of love of charity associations, had issued a proclamation recommending that the opening day of the Fair had to be considered as holiday. Major-General John Adams Dix had organized the largest military display of New York, with all the regular troops of the city, under command of General Stannard, and the militia under General Sandford. The Metropolitan Fair Building on Fourteenth-Street New York Monday, the 4th of April, 1864 the Metropolitan Fair was officially declared open. There were flags everywhere and the streets, starting from twelve o'clock, were filled by half million of gazing people. At three o'clock, one hour late than the original plan, eight thousand men, accompanied by the melodies of bands, started to march from Fourteenth Street, passing down Second Avenue, through Stuyvesant Place and Astor Place, to Broadway. Then the two mile procession stopped at the City Hall and the ceremony went on with two interesting speeches. In the evening, in the gallery over the entrance of the Fair's building on Fourteenth street, the ceremonies were opened by a choir and a military band that played \\"Star Spangled Banner\\" and then the solemn Holmes' \\"Army Hymn\\" to express the spirit that carried out Americans during the war and gave a prompt to the organization of the Fair. After that General Dix spoke in behalf of the Gentlemen's Executive Committee and ended his speech by thanking the Ladies with the following words: \\"To your hands, ladies, we commit these contributions from both hemispheres, to be disposed of under your auspices. And you may rest assured that the sources of consolation and comfort which you are opening for others, will be poured out in kindred currents of gratitude to you, to bless you with the highest and purest of all gratifications, ‚Äî that of alleviating the condition of those who are suffering for a cause involving in its issue every element of civilization and of social order.\\" To this it followed a long applause and Handel's \\"Hallelujah Chorus\\" and then the last speech was given by Mr. Joseph Hodges Choate in behalf of the Ladies' Committee. Finally, after singing \\"Old Hundred\\" the crowd melted itself through the Picture Gallery, the Arms and Trophies Room, the Indian Department, the Curiosity Shop and the Restaurant. So that day the Fair was inaugurated and lasted eighteen days, until Saturday the 23rd of April. Costume of ladies' at the Normandy stand, Metropolitan Fair, April 1864 Fair's buildings Metropolitan Fair's buildings in Fourteenth Street (first floor) The first possible location for the Metropolitan Fair was to hire the Academy of Music and Iring Hall but these buildings didn't have enough rooms. In a second moment, there was the idea of using the building then unfinished, bounded by Broadway, Sixth Avenue, and Thirty-Fifth and Thirty-Sixth Streets, in conjunction with the State Arsenal, Seventh Avenue and Thirty-Fifth Street, some vacant lots in Thirty-Fourth Street, and the house at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Thirty-Fourth Street, last used by the Spingler Institute. The offer of the use of the Twenty Second Regiment Armory was accepted. On April the 9th, 1864, Harper's Weekly published views of buildings on 14th Street and at Union Square. They were built and adapted for use of the Metropolitan Fair. The Fourteenth Street building consisted of the brick Armory buildings near Sixth Avenue, with wooden structures added thereto, affording a front of more than two hundred feet, and not only extending through from Fourteenth to Fifteenth streets, but including the north sidewalk on the lower street, and on the upper leaving room for the passage of only a single carriage. At fourteenth Street there were the main buildings of the Fair - with a dome, forming a large bazaar, with adjacent sections used for exhibition of paintings and similar adoptions. Previously described main buildings were the main focus because of The Book Department inside. Metropolitan Fair's buildings in Union Square and second floor of the building in Fourteenth Street In front of the Armory, the building was raised above the pavement and extended to the street. It was occupied by the Indian Wigwam, which displayed Indian costumes and depicted Indian life. \\"Red People\\" performed some of their traditional dances inside. During the Fair, there were many similar performances that were supposed to make time pleasant. The lower part of the building housed the Department of Ordnance, referring to the public service and the Museum of Arms and Trophies. The street front of the Fair was extended by incorporating a building occupied by the livery stable, and a building of three divisions designated for the Fair Restaurant. The Department of Machinery, a house, a shop with three other full parts were placed at Fifteenth Street. Temporary buildings on the fourteenth and fifteenth street cost more than sixty thousand dollars, although it was needed more space. The Sanitary Commission, in line with the idea to allow children to have an active role in the fair, agreed to be responsible for the additional buildings, and the organizers gained permission to use part of Union Square. The building in Union Square, though divided into four departments, was two hundred and eighty-five feet long, and consisted of two main buildings, each sixty by ninety feet, connected by a narrower one of one hundred and sixty-five feet in length and fifty-five feet wide. There was located the Children's Department. It was divided into ten booths which contained among other things, a miniature pond for skating and the embracing contribution from public schools. Union Square cost $17,000, was symmetrical, consisted of two main buildings, one on Broadway and one on Fourth Avenue. It housed also three other departmental fairs - International Department, Knickerbocker's Kitchen and Music Hall. At the construction of the building, bricklayers and fitters took part and due to the role of the building, performed their work at half the standard price of services. The entire construction lasted a little over two weeks. Financial Statement The Financial statement of the Metropolitan Fair reported that the whole amount received by the Treasury of the Fair up to the 1st of August,1864, date of the report of the Treasurer, was One Million Three Hundred and Forty Thousand Fifty Dollars and Thirty Seven Cents ($1,340,050.37). Moreover, the Financial Statement reports that the amount paid out for expenses was One Hundred Sixty Three Thousands Three Hundred and Seventy Eight Dollars and Forty Seven Cents ($163,378.47), leaving as the net profit of the Fair the sum of One Million One Hundred and Seventy Six Thousands Six Hundred and Seventy One Dollars and Ninety Cents ($1,176,671.90). As economic contributions continued to be donated and as further goods deliveries were expected and as many items remained unsold, the accounts of the Treasurer couldn't be closed on that day (1 August 1864), and a final statement showed the sum added to the sum they had already received. Of that sum, one million dollars was paid to the Treasurer of the United States Sanitary Commission, on the 17th May, 1864, by order of the Executive Committee. The role of chairman of the Finantial Committee was superintended by John Hamilton Gourlie, whereas Hamilton Wills and George Tuthill held the role of assistants of the Chairman. All the remaining goods at the end of the Fair were either sold at auction, or sent as gifts to other fairs in St. Louis and Philadelphia.

It is part of BBC foreign language output of 33 languages, of which five are African languages. The language service include radio station, Abuja bureau office and daily updated website which serves as a news portal and provides information as well as analyses in text, audio and video and provides online access to radio broadcasts. The radio service is broadcast from Broadcasting House in London and preliminary editing done at BBC bureau office in Abuja. History BBC Hausa service was the first African language service begun by BBC and is one of the five African languages it broadcasts. The service was launched on 13 March 1957, at 0930 GMT with a 15-minute programme under BBC World Service presented by Aminu Abdullahi Malumfashi. Later, a translated version was read by Abubakar Tunau in the programme West Africa in the News. The programmae was then aired on Wednesdays and Fridays only. Daily programme started one year later on 1 June 1958 and continuously run since then. In March 2017, the BBC celebrated its Hausa service 60th Anniversary in Abuja. The director of the BBC World Service Group, Fran Unsworth attended. She said in part: Nigerian President, Muhammadu Buhari also sent a voice message at the occasion where he made known that he is BBC Hausa loyal listener and has spent many years listening its programmes. In its early days BBC rose to prominence in Hausa speaking world due to style of its reporting. It has conducted interviews with many prominent African politicians. Abuja office BBC Abuja office was opened in 2002. Broadcasting At many times BBC Hausa service have senior editor, producers, assistant editor and senior reporter.

As FBI historian Athan Theoharis described in 1978, \\"The FBI compiled other lists in addition to the Security Index. These include a \\"Comsab program\\" (concentrating on Communists with a potential for sabotage), and \\"Detcom program\\" (a \\"priority\\" list of individuals to be arrested), and a Communist Index (individuals about whom investigation did not \\"reflect sufficient disloyal information\\" but whom the bureau deemed to be 'of interest ...

In contrast to the employee security program, these plans were not only withheld from the public and Congress but were framed in terms which disregarded the legislation enacted by Congress. Director Hoover's decision to ignore Attorney General Biddle's 1943 directive abolishing the wartime Custodial Detention List had been an example of the inability of the Attorney General to control domestic intelligence operations. In the 1950s the FBI and the Justice Department collaborated in a decision to disregard the attempt by Congress to provide statutory direction for the Emergency Detention Program. This is not to say that the Justice Department itself was fully aware of the FBI's activities in this area. The FBI kept secret from the Department its most sweeping list of potentially dangerous persons, first called the \\"Communist Index\\" and later renamed the \\"Reserve Index,\\" as well as its targeting programs for intensive investigation of \\"key figures\\" and \\"top functionaries\\" and its own detention priorities labeled \\"Detcom\\" and \\"Comsab\\". * 1995 ‚Äì M. Wesley Swearingen wrote: DETCOM was part of J. Edgar Hoover's (in)famous Security Index. \\"I became very knowledgeable about the Security Index, because all my subjects were tagged either DETCOM (\\"detain as communist\\") or COMSAB. COMSAB was the designation for someone who had a job in a company with government contractss, and who therefore had an opportunity to commit sabotage in the event of a national emergency. Subjects tagged COMSAB were to be arrested first, then those tagged DETCOM, followed by all others on the Security Index. After all the individuals on the Security Index were arrested, those on the Communist Index, later called the Reserve Index, were to be arrested.\\" * 2003 ‚Äì Fred Jerome wrote: \\"In the early 1950s, congressional committees were keenly interested in hearing how many hard-core communists Hoover was prepared to put into \\"detention camps\\" in case of a war with Russia. This was the \\"Detention of Communists\\"‚Äìor Det-Com‚Äìlst. While the FBI had millions of security files, \\"only\\" several thousand were slated for such emergency camps. The purpose of Det-Com, David Wise explains, was simply \\"to determine which of us to lock up in the event of war or a presidentially decreed 'emergency'.\\" On September 7, 1950 (the day G-2's first Einstein spy- memo arrived), Hoover told the senators the FBI had targeted twelve thousand Reds to be rounded up \\"in the event of war with Russia.\\" The Washington Post reported the next day that he also requested funding for 835 new agents and 1,218 new clerical workers ...

She was one of the first Parsis who took up Indian classical dance. A doyenne of Kathak, she was an acclaimed performer and teacher. Her choreography in the film Mayurpankh (1954) was lauded. Life Shirin Vajifdar was born in Bombay, India. She had two younger sisters, Khurshid and Roshan. They were brought up in an orphanage in Bombay. In the 1930s, defying the disapproval of her community, Vajifdar began to learn Kathak with Sunder Prasad, a teacher from the Jaipur Gharana. She also attended the Nrityalayam dance academy run by Madame Menaka in Khandala, at the same time as Shevanti Bhonsale and Damayanti Joshi. Here she learned other forms of Indian dance: Manipuri and Kathakali. Vajifdar married Mulk Raj Anand in 1950. She was his second wife. Career Vajifdar taught dance to Khurshid and Roshan, with whom she began to perform as the Vajifdar sisters. They trained in all the major schools of Indian dance, including Bharatnatyam and Mohiniattam. The sisters were the first Parsis to perform Indian classical dance. While conservatives in the Parsi community were opposed to them, she received support from others. The modernist dancer Ram Gopal was one of their instructors. Among the Vajifdars' contemporaries in performance were Mrinalini Sarabhai, Vyjayanthimala, and the Poovaiah sisters. Vajifdar ran a dance academy, Nritya Manjari, in Cuffe Parade in Bombay. Along with Krishna Kutty, she founded the Nritya Darpana Society. On the eve of Indian independence in 1947, Vajifdar and her pupils, The Marwari Belles, performed at Bombay's Taj Mahal Hotel. In 1951, Vajifdar and her sisters toured South East Asia, performing and promoting Indian culture. There do not appear to be any extant recordings of Vajifdar's performances. The Films Division of India had made a film, but it was lost. In 1952, she appeared on BBC Television. In 1954, Vajifdar choreographed a dance sequence in Kishore Sahu's film Mayurpankh. Roshan and Khurshid performed in the sequence. In 1955, she was part of a dance delegation to China. She essayed the role of Mohini and Bhasmasura with Krishna Kutty, to considerable acclaim. By 1957, Vajifdar had retired from performance. She then began to write reviews of dance for the Times of India.

Thanks to the many plays she wrote, she became the most successful female Danish playwright of the 19th century. Her Rosa og Rosita (1862) was performed more than a hundred times at the Royal Danish Theatre. She remained unknown to the general public during her lifetime as her plays were written anonymously and her novels and short stories were published under the pen-name Paul Winther. Biography Born in Copenhagen on 13 May 1826, Clara Elisabeth Andersen was the daughter of the musician Casper Heinrich Bernhard Andersen, who played the French horn at the Royal Theatre, and the actress Birgitte Andersen, who performed there. Andersen began writing plays when still young. In 1848, she sent En Evadatter to the poet Henrik Hertz who encouraged her to continue. She became acquainted with the dramatist Frederik H√∏edt who had the play performed at the Royal Court Theatre (Hofteatret) in 1855. It became one of the most popular plays written by a woman. Based on how a performance of Hamlet is perceived by London aristocrats, it was well received by the critics. Her most successful play, Rosa og Rosita, was staged at the Royal Theatre in 1862 but was also performed in Vienna, Berlin, Breslau and Kristiania. Other works included En Velg√∏rers Testamente (1858), En Teaterhistorie under Ludvig den XIV (1862), En nyttig Onkel (1870), Gr√∏ns F√∏dselsdag (1870), De lykkeligste B√∏rn (1871) and Sandt og usandt (1873). Most were staged at the Royal Theatre where they were well received. Adopting the pen-name Paul Winther, she published a collection of short stories titled Noveller in 1855 as well as the novel Kastaniebaandet (The Chestnut Band) in 1861. In later years, she lived alone in a Viennese boarding house but continued to take an interest in the theatre. She died in Copenhagen on 28 August 1895, still unknown as a playwright. She left a considerable sum to charity.

Biography  Gabriel Expilly's origin and education are unknown. The name is of Savoie origin (Savoie, Is√®re).One can quote Gabriel Expilly who received his doctorate on 18 November 1651 at the University of Avignon. (AD Vaucluse : D 136, f. 8) but there's no indication that it's the same person. This laureate is most likely related to the family of Claude Expilly, a well-known magistrate of his time.  Sub-Master of the Chapelle du roi  His first known job was as a sub-master of the Chapelle Royale of Versailles.On this episode of his career, see Decobert 2011, notably p. 92-93. The death of Jean Veillot had been the occasion to renew the position of sub-master, which had been divided into quarters (trimesters). In two stages, it seems that the positions fell to Thomas Gobert, Pierre Robert, Henry Du Mont and Gabriel Expilly. For Expilly, his quarter seems to be the result of the duplication of the semiannual charge, first passed to Thomas Gobert and had been the subject of a competition in 1663, if one believes what Pierre Perrin writes in the preface to his Cantica pro capella regis (1665): ::S‚Äôil luy plaist [√† Louis XIV] de se ressouvenir du succ√®s qu‚Äôont eu plusieurs de ces cantiques, lorsqu‚Äôils ont √©t√© chantez dans sa Chapelle ; entr‚Äôautres celuy du Martyr que luy fit entendre le sieur Expilly, lors de sa concurrence √† la maistrise, qui ravit toute vostre cour, & qui fit dire √† Votre Majest√© qu‚Äôil avait combattu avec des armes avantageusesThat is to say: he had composed on a text by Perrin. ; & en suitte ceux dont il l‚Äôa r√©gal√©e pendant son quartier, de Sainte Anne & de la Vierge martyre... Expilly held the quarter from July to September; he received wages of 1650 lt for his 1664 quarter, which includes his personal wages, food and pages maintenance.See Benoit 1971 p. 10 (1664), 20 (1668). In 1666 his wages were only 450 lt. He resigned in July 1668Paris AN : O/1/13, f. 183, 5 August 1669 (mentioned after Benoit 1971 p. 25). without us knowing the cause of his departure. At this point, the sub-master's charge remained divided by quarters, but with two sub- masters alternating between them. (Pierre Robert and Henry Du Mont).  Viol player from the King's Chamber  Expilly then became a viol player in the King's Chamber. He is cited several times in the payment lists of the Chamber, at 600 lt per year.See Benoit 1971 p. 64 (600 lt in 1678, idem in 1685, idem in 1688). Around 1678, he worked alongside Charles Le Camus, then around 1688 with √âtienne Lemoyne, successor of the previous one, both viol players. On 31 December 1689, he resigned his office in favour of Antoine Forqueray.Paris AN : O/1/33 f. 371 and 306, mentioned after Benoit 1971 p. 118). Since traces of him disappear after that, it is supposed he died shortly afterwards.  Works  Title page of the booklet of Motets et √©l√©vations d'Expilly (1666). Paris BNF. Expilly wrote a significant amount of religious music, which seems to have earned him some esteem from his contemporaries, but his work is completely lost.

He served five terms in the State House, where he was the only Hispanic representative at the time. He is best known for his work on behalf of Mexican-Americans and Tejanos in Texas, defending civil rights of Hispanic and other minorities. As a state representative, in 1919 he led a state investigation into the Texas Rangers, who had been accused of crimes and abuses in the Rio Grande Valley, and along with the US 8th Cavalry, were involved in the Porvenir Massacre in deep west Texas on the west side of the Sierra Vieja, north of Candelaria and Ruidosa. The committee heard testimony from 83 witnesses, who revealed extensive abuses by the Rangers of minorities and other poor citizens. After his service in the State House, Canales continued his work as civil rights activist through several Hispanic and Latin American organizations. Early life Canales was born in 1877 on his family ranch in Nueces County, Texas, the son of Andreas and Tomasa (Cavazos) Canales, a Tejano family who had deep roots in Texas that preceded the Anglo-Americans. He was a descendant of Jos√© Salvador de la Garza, who once held a Spanish land grant encompassing much of present-day Cameron County. Canales' family maintained significant ranch land in the area when he was born. He went to the public schools in Nueces County and to the Texas Business College in Austin, Texas. Canales went North to study law, receiving his degree from University of Michigan Law School in 1899. After his return to Texas and passing the bar, he worked for a few years in Corpus Christi and Laredo. He settled in Brownsville, Texas, where he set up a practice. He married Anna Anderson Wheeler. Their family included a daughter, Elizabeth McCaw Canales. During his life, he acquired 30,000 acres, which he initially dedicated mostly to ranching. Later he had much of the land developed for cotton. Career Canales became active in the Democratic Party and entered politics, running for the State House. He was elected and served for a total of five terms in the Texas House of Representatives, from 1905 to 1911 and from 1917 to 1921. He first represented the 95th District (Cameron, Hidalgo, Starr and Zapata counties). After redistricting, he was elected from the 77th district (Cameron and Willacy counties). Between his periods of service as a representative, Canales served as superintendent of public schools for Cameron County from 1912 to 1914. He left to serve a term as county judge for Cameron County. Political career Canales was the sole Hispanic representative in the state legislature during his years in the State House. He gained electoral support in his large district by his support of prohibition and women's suffrage. In 1909 he broke over prohibition with Democratic supporter, Texas Governor James B. Wells Jr.. Canales ran for county judge as an independent, but was unsuccessful. In 1910, he worked to organize Latin American scouts to gather intelligence about Mexican raids into Texas. Mexican social unrest was making the border more volatile. During the decade of the Mexican Revolution 1910-1920), revolutionary raids across the border damaged American ranches, irrigation systems, railroads and other infrastructure. Canales served as superintendent of the Cameron County public school system. He worked to emphasize English-language education and rural education initiatives. After being reelected to the House of Representatives in 1917 as a Democrat, Canales served as chair of the House Committee on Irrigation. In 1917 he helped gain passage of legislation preventing Mexican migrant workers from draft evasion in the United States, shortly before the US entered the Great War in Europe. Canales was an outspoken critic of the Texas Rangers force, who retaliated against raiders and had sometimes acted as vigilantes along the border, especially against people of Mexican descent, citizen and migrant alike. In 1918 he brought 19 charges of misconduct against the Rangers for actions during the border wars. Canales investigation A joint committee of the state Senate and House was set up to investigate the actions of the Texas Rangers, with hearings to be held in early 1919. Before the hearings, in December 1918 Canales was directly threatened by Frank Hamer, a noted Ranger, and he reported this to Governor William P. Hobby. Hamer was never disciplined and stalked Canales at the capital. State representative Samuel Ealy Johnson Jr., father of future president Lyndon B. Johnson, was among legislators who escorted Canales to the hearings as protection. The 1919 Canales investigation, as it became known, heard testimony from 83 witnesses over a period of two weeks, including Anglo, Hispanic, and African-American Texans, and Mexican migrants, who recounted abuses by Texas Rangers. Incidents included the Porvenir massacre in January 1918 of 15 unarmed ethnic Mexicans near the border, whom the Rangers rounded up from their settlement. The investigation revealed that the Rangers may have killed an estimated 5,000 people, mostly of Mexican descent, between 1914 and 1919. This material added support for widespread reform within the Rangers. Canales had supported a bill calling for professionalization of the force (which also provided for increased pay). Restrictions were added to reduce Texas Ranger vigilante actions against Mexicans and Tejanos in the Rio Grande Valley, and provide for citizen complaints. But the bill which Canales supported to regulate the force was so weakened in its final version that he voted against it. As a result of the personal and political backlash against him for the hearings, Canales did not run for re-election in 1920. In later years Canales reflected that his family feared he would be assassinated and said that the investigation had \\"nearly cost my life\\". Civil rights After his 1920 retirement from politics, Canales became an advocate for Mexican-American civil rights, working with the Order of the Sons of America, one of the first civil rights organizations for Mexican-Americans in Texas. In 1927, he addressed the Harlingen Convention, organized to address statewide racial discrimination. After the conference, he became the first president of the Latin American Citizens League. Alongside Alonzo Perales in 1929, he wrote much of the League of United Latin American Citizens' constitution. Canales served as president of the organization for the term 1932-1933, and established its first scholarship fund. Historian Canales wrote books and articles about Texas history.'Judge J. T. Canales Dies at Brownsville, Del Rio News Herald, April 1, 1976, p. 16 Much of his work was self-published, covering topics such as law, religion, and Mexican-American history. His autobiography, Personal Recollections of J. T. Canales (1945), is his best-known work. Death Canales died in Brownsville, Texas on March 30, 1976. His wife, Anne Anderson Wheeler Canales, had died before him. He was survived by one daughter, Elizabeth McCaw Canales Goldfinch, and one granddaughter, Anne Herlinda Goldfinch Locascio.

He wrote several major military-political works and military histories, which were very pro-Napoleon.  Life  He was born in Windheim, Westphalia into the Rhineland branch of the Sch√∂nhausener line of the House of Bismarck. In 1796 he entered military service as a cornet in the Hanoverian Army and in 1803 moved to the army of Nassau. In 1804 he entered the King's German Legion, with which he fought in northern Germany in 1805. He had to leave it in 1807 due to a duel, moving to become a cavalry captain in the Army of W√ºrttemberg. On 7 September 1807 he married Augusta Amalia (1778‚Äì1846), a daughter of Frederick Augustus, Duke of Nassau ‚Äì she had been in love with him before her unhappy marriage to Louis William, Landgrave of Hesse-Homburg in 1804, which had ended in divorce.

In 1812 he took part in all the battles fought by Michel Ney's corps. At the battles of Bautzen, near Seifersdorf on 26 May 1813 and Dennewitz on 6 September 1813 he commanded the 1st Chevau- L√©ger Regiment. He was finally captured at the battle of Leipzig. When W√ºrttemberg switched sides to fight against Napoleon, he was put on the general staff and in 1815 was made commander in chief of the Crown Provinces. The following year he was made a 'graf' or count and promoted to oberst and flugeladjutant. After the reign of William I of W√ºrttemberg he was entrusted with re-organising the army's cavalry, becoming a major general in 1819. He was made a member of the Kammer der Standesherren in the Estates of W√ºrttemberg, extraordinary envoy to the court at Karlsruhe in 1820, then five years later ambassador to the Kingdom of Prussia, the Kingdom of Saxony and the Kingdom of Hanover.

Barlow was born Hugh Owen, the son of Wyrriott Owen of Great Nash and his wife Anne Barlow, daughter of John Barlow MP of Lawrenny, Pembrokeshire. He married firstly Emma Owen, daughter of Lt.-Gen. John Owen MP. He succeeded his father in 1755. In the 1774 general election Owen was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Pembroke. He succeeded to Great Nash on the death of his nephew Wyrriot Owen in 1780. He was re-elected MP for Pembroke in the 1780 and 1784 general elections. When his cousin Sir Hugh Owen, 5th Baronet died in 1786 leaving an infant heir, Hugh Owen became acting head of the Orielton family interest. He was on poor terms with Sir Hugh's widow and his opposition politics were against the family's interest. Nevertheless, he carried on representing Pembroke Boroughs in that interest, unopposed. He succeeded to Lawrenny on the death of his Aunt Elizabeth Barlow, widow of Hugh Barlow in 1788 and assumed the name of Barlow in 1789. He was a childless widower and his main object was to secure the Pembrokeshire seat for his infant ward, Hugh Owen in the future. He was returned for Pembroke in 1790 and continued to vote occasionally with the Whigs, although no speech by him is known. He married as his second wife Anne Crespigny, daughter of Philip Champion Crespigny of Burwood, Surrey on 24 August 1791. He was returned for Pembroke again in 1796, 1802, 1806 and 1807. He resided seven months a year in Pembrokeshire and promoted local bills on roads and fisheries which ensured his popularity there. One critic described him as ‚Äúthe merest whiffler in the world‚Äù.

Bioassays are quantitative biological assays used to estimate the potency of agents by observing their effects on living animals (in vivo) or tissue/cell culture systems (in vitro). A bioassay experiment can either be qualitative or quantitative, direct or indirect. If the measured response is binary, the assay is qualitative, if not, it is quantitative. Bioassay is used to detect biological hazards or give a quality assessment of a mixture. Bioassay is often used to monitor water quality and also sewage discharge and its impact on surrounding. It is also used to assess the environmental impact and safety of new technologies and facilities.  Principle  Bioassay is a biochemical test to estimate the relative potency of a sample compound to a standard compound. Typical bioassay involves a stimulus (ex. drugs) applied to a subject (ex. animals, tissues, plants) and a response (ex. death) of the subject is triggered and measured. The intensity of stimulus is varied by doses and depending on this intensity of stimulus, a change/response will be followed by a subject.  History  The first uses of bioassay dates back to as early as the late 19th century, when the foundation of bioassays was laid down by a German physician, Paul Ehrlich. He introduced the concept of standardization by the reactions of living matter. His bioassay on diphtheria antitoxin was the first bioassay to receive recognition. His use of bioassay was able to discover that administration of gradually increasing dose of diphtheria in animals stimulated production of antiserum. Many of the early bioassays consisted of using animals to test carcinogenicity of chemicals. One well known example is a \\"canary in the coal mine\\" experiment. To test for methane, miners would take methane-sensitive canaries to coal mines to ensure safe air. In 1915, Yamaigiwa Katsusaburo and Koichi Ichikawa tested the carcinogenicity of coal tar using inner surface of rabbit's ears. Through 1940s and 1960s, animal bioassay was primarily used to test for toxicity and safety of drugs, food additives and pesticides. In late 1960s and 1970s, reliance on bioassay increased as the public concern for occupational and environmental hazards increased. While before this health risks of certain chemicals such as pesticide was tested in animal bioassay, it was still rare and testing was not seen often.  Classifications   Direct assay   The stimulus/standard sufficiently produces measurable and specific response. The response must be clear, easily recognized, and directly measured.  Indirect assay based on quantitative response   The relationship between the dose and the response is first ascertained. Then the dose corresponding to a given response is obtained from the relation for each preparation separately.  Indirect assay based on quantal response   The assay involves 'all or none' response (ex. life or death). The response is produced by threshold effect.  Examples   ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay)   quantitative analytical method that measures absorbance of color change from antigen-antibody reaction (ex. Direct, indirect, sandwich, competitive). ELISA is used to measure variety of substances in human body from cortisol levels for stress to glucose level for diabetes.  Home pregnancy test  Home pregnancy test involves ELISA to detect the increase of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) during pregnancy.  HIV test  HIV test also uses indirect ELISA to detect HIV antibody caused by infection.

The Nye Committee assigned him to work at Federal Laboratories in Pittsburgh; this organization provided munitions to steel companies and to both warring factions in Cuba. He also helped Caroll Dougherty, Economics professor, research material for Brookings Institution publications, through which he became interested in the Amalgamated Iron and Steel Workers Union (AKA Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers or \\"AA\\"). He then worked for the Pennsylvania Security League and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), which formed in 1936. Ruttenberg became regional research director of the Pittsburgh for the Steel Workers Organization Committee (SWOC), itself created by the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). He and brother Stanley collaborated on articles. In 1942, the brothers also worked with Hetzel, Lee Pressman, and Vincent Sweeney in writing the initial legal brief to the National War Labor Board (NWLB) for the Little Steel strike. In 1938 and again from 1942 to 1944 during World War II, he served as assistant director for steel in the War Production Board, which included the \\"Steel for Victory\\" drive in Pittsburgh (Summer 1943). By 1946, he had added chair of the CIO's wage research committee to USWA research director. The committee challenged U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures on fallen labor productivity 1939‚Äì1944, used by industry to justify refusals to grant adequate wage increases. Split In his obituary, the New York Times summarized a 1971 letter he had written that explained his decision to leave the labor movement and move to industry: > He said that the leadership of the steelworkers' union had let him and two > others resign from the union rather than have the union agree to pursue a > policy that the three \\"had advocated of assuming responsibility along with > management for increasing productivity as employment benefits increased so > that the union could restrain steel price increases.\\" He recalled that both > the union and the management sides had refused to do that in 1945 and 1946. He left the union when the USWA failed to implement his policy recommendations on wages. Steel industry years In 1946, Cyrus Eaton hired Ruttenberg for the Portsmouth Steel Company as vice president in charge of labor relations because he wanted to \\"make a lot of money.\\" . In 1949, he left Portsmouth to head Stardrill-Keystone Drilling Machine Company, Humanation Associates, and United Steel and Wire Company. His specialty was to rescue companies in financial difficulty. In 1948, Ruttenberg set off an investigation into former CIO and SWOC colleague Lee Pressman. On May 19, 1948, Securities and Exchange Commission official Anthon H. Lund accused Pressman of interfering in a lawsuit filed against the Kaiser-Frazer car manufacturing company in a Federal District Court in New York City. He specified that between February 3 and 9, 1948, Ruttenberg , then vice president of Portsmouth Steel Corporation, had contacted Pressman for advice on \\"how to go about filing a stockholder's suite against Kaiser-Frazer.\\" Later in May, during testimony before an SEC board of inquiry, Pressman declared he had \\"absolutely nothing to do with\\" the suit. \\"I have not been requested by anyone to suggest the name of a lawyer who would file a lawsuit against the Kaiser-Frazer Corporation.\\" He stated, \\"I demand that I be given the opportunity to examine Mr. Lund under oath on the stand to determine who gave him that inaccurate information.\\" The trial's examiner Milton P. Kroll informed Pressman, \\"You have been given the opportunity to state your position on the record. Your request is denied.\\" In 1958, Ruttenberg said in speech that steelworkers needed \\"steady jobs with 52 regular pay checks a year\\" over higher hourly wages. He also criticized David J. McDonald, USWA president, for \\"sidetracking the dynamic concept of the annual wage\\" and for resisting ties between wage increases and heightened industrial efficiency. He also criticized steel executives for lack of leadership. In 1968, in the aftermath of the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, he served as chairman of Rehovoth Instruments Company in Israel through 1978. In 1973, he became chairman and chief executive the AVM Corporation, where he remained until his death in 1998 (by which time AVM Corporation had become known as the American Locker Group, Inc., manufacturer and distributor of coin-operated metal lockers and plastic security mail boxes). Personal and death About 1936, Ruttenberg married Katherine Monori (1914‚Äì2002). They had four children. In 1968, the Ruttenbergs lived part-time in Israel through 1993. He died age 84 at home on August 15, 1998, in Pittsburgh of heart failure. Legacy In 1958, the New York Herald Tribune called Ruttenberg \\"the brilliant research director and economic wizard for the United Steel Workers and the righthand man of Philip Murray,\\" USWA and CIO president. The New York Times eulogized him, stating \\"In his years in the labor world and in management, Mr. Ruttenberg was a perennial advocate of improving ties between the two sides.\\" Lynn R. Williams cited The Dynamics of Industrial Democracy (1942) by Ruttenberg and Clinton S. Golden as a major inspiration to his own work and career.

It is based on his novel of the same name. The film stars Nagesh, K. R. Vijaya, T. S. Balaiah, S. V. Sahasranamam and Wahab Kashmiri. The film deals with a mentally retarded servant boy who is wrongly accused of theft in the lodge he works at. Yaarukkaga Azhudhaan was released on 14 April 1966. Although the film received critical praise for its content and technique, it failed commercially, and Jayakanthan did not direct any film afterwards.  Plot  Joseph is a mentally retarded servant boy working at a lodge in Madras. An inebriated Sait, who arrives at the lodge to stay, gives his cash to the lodge owner for safekeeping. The next morning, the Sait has forgotten to whom he gave the cash, so he accuses Joseph. The owner exploits this situation and keeps the money. When interrogated, Joseph remains taciturn. A woman lodger who was deserted by her lover, tries to help, but only the return of the head cook Naidu, who was previously on vacation, discovers the truth and clears Joseph's name.

It was his second directorial venture after Unnaipol Oruvan (1965), and based on his own novel of the same name. The original producer, G. N. Velumani, wanted Sivaji Ganesan and Savitri to be in the lead roles; days before principal photography began, he backed out and Jayakanthan took over as producer, with Nagesh and K. R. Vijaya cast instead. While primarily a melodrama, the film also included overtones of the thriller genre. Nagesh, then known primarily as a comedian, was cast against type in a serious role as the male lead Joseph. The cinematography was handled by Nemai Ghosh. The film had no dance sequences, and the music was composed by S. V. Ramanan. The film's final cut measured . Jayakanthan did not direct any further films after this, but did collaborate on the production of Sila Nerangalil Sila Manithargal (1976) and Oru Nadigai Natakam Parkiral and (1978), both adapted from his novels.  Soundtrack   Release and reception  Yaarukkaga Azhudhaan was released on 14 April 1966. Though the experimental film received praise for its content and technique, it was a commercial failure. Writing for Madras Musings, Randor Guy praised it for making a \\"strong socially relevant statement\\". Film historian S. Theodore Baskaran wrote that it brought a \\"whole new dimension\\" of Nagesh's acting ability, and that though film did not get much notice during its theatrical run, he was \\"lucky to catch it in its first few days in Chennai\\". He described the film as \\"very realistic natural cinema\\", praised Nagesh for \\"emoting more through body language than dialogue\\" and the cinematography by Ghosh, adding that the dialogues were \\"written so as to not divert the focus of the film.\\"  References   Bibliography  *  External links  Films based on Indian novels Indian films Indian thriller drama films 1960s thriller drama films 1966 drama films ","title":"Yaarukkaga Azhudhaan"},{"id":"55442247","text":"London Central Portfolio (LCP) is a UK real estate investment firm, founded in 1990 by Naomi Heaton and operating in the accommodation sector in central London.

Life  Birth records show that he was born in Gateshead in 1799. In 1841, he was recorded in the census as living in Newcastle, in Cumberland Row, Westgate Road.England and Wales Census, 1841. https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M7WZ-4RF : 7 September 2017 He was still living there in 1851, but subsequently moved to Tynemouth after his father's death in 1853. He died there in 1866.Shields Daily News, 20 February 1866, recovered from British Newspaper Archive.  Musical significance  He is a figure of some importance in the history of the instrument's repertoire. In 1858, William Kell, of the Ancient Melodies Committee set up by the Newcastle Society of Antiquaries, noted that Stanton owned one of only four surviving copies of the printed tunebook of John Peacock, published in about 1800 .Peacock's Tunes, 2nd ed., Northumbrian Pipers' Society (1999), At the launch of the Committee, Kell specifically thanked Stanton, in his address to the Duke of Northumberland, the patron of the Society.Alnwick Mercury, Tuesday 01 December 1857, recovered from British Newspaper Archive. Stanton also had a significant collection of music manuscripts, some of which are now bound in the Fenwick manuscript, while two manuscript books belonged to the late Lance Robson, who distributed transcripts through the Northumbrian Musical Heritage Society. Together, these two groups of papers give a picture of an able and enthusiastic amateur piper in the mid-19th century. As well as local pieces, including variation sets from Peacock's collection and popular Tyneside songs, he played many Scots and Irish tunes, as well as popular songs and dance tunes of the day. Some nursery rhymes are included, perhaps for the benefit of a young pupil. One variation set on \\"Sir John Fenwick's the Flower amang them\\", needing a keyed chanter, corresponds to that found in the Rook manuscript, and may derive from the Reid family, who lived nearby in North Shields; another tune in Stanton's hand \\"Shew's the way to Wallington\\", is identical to a version in the Fenwick manuscript, there stated to be James Reid's copy. Scans of two of the Stanton pages in the Fenwick manuscript are at , and ; these are for unkeyed and keyed chanter respectively. These tunes are in relatively simple versions, suitable for someone learning the instrument, suggesting that Fenwick studied the instrument with Stanton. Two of Stanton's tunes in Fenwick, \\"Little wot ye wha's coming\\" and \\"Blackett of Wylam\\" were explicitly attributed by him to Peacock, although they are not in Peacock's printed tunebook. These tunes appear in the manuscripts of Peacock's pupil Robert Bewick, so the attribution is very credible.Bewick's Pipe Tunes, ed. Matt Seattle, Northumbrian Pipers' Society, 2010, In 1881, John Stokoe, one of the editors of the Northumbrian Minstrelsy, referred to some of Stanton's manuscripts, then in the possession of the piper T. Errington Thompson, of Sewing Shields. He described Stanton as 'an amateur performer on the smallpipes, and an ardent lover of their music'. In the Minstrelsy, and in this article, Stokoe printed the tune \\"Follow her over the Border\\", taken from these manuscripts.Newcastle Courant, 3 June 1881, article \\"Northumbrian Pipe and Ballad Music\\", retrieved from British Newspaper Archive. Stanton had an unusual, perhaps unique, set of smallpipes made, with 6 drones rather than 4 or 5, which was assembled by James Reid, using parts made by his father Robert. Having 6 drones made it easier to change key while playing. A picture of this set was used as the frontispiece of James Fenwick's \\"Instruction Book for the Northumbrian Smallpipes\\", published in 1896.

Premiering on September 25, 2017, it replaced Today's Take as the third hour of NBC's national morning show Today. The program was hosted by Megyn Kelly, who had joined NBC News earlier in the year after leaving Fox News, and was the second of two NBC News programs promised to Kelly upon her arrival, alongside her newsmagazine Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly. Megyn Kelly Today received negative reviews upon its premiere, facing criticism for the quality of Kelly's hosting and her appropriateness as a daytime personality, as well as on-air interactions that proved controversial. On October 26, 2018, in the midst of backlash over remarks by Kelly on the program regarding blackface, and reports suggesting she wished to focus more on her role as an NBC News correspondent, NBC announced that the show had been canceled. Kelly ultimately departed NBC in January 2019.  History  After it was announced in January 2017 that former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly would move to NBC News and host a new daytime program, The New York Times reported on January 27, 2017 that NBC was planning to discontinue Today's Take, and schedule Kelly's new show at either 9 or 10 a.m. (either replacing Today's Take in its former timeslot, or in the latter scenario, displacing Today with Kathie Lee and Hoda to 9). It was reported that NBC staff had not yet determined whether Kelly's new program would be branded as part of Today or as a stand-alone program. It was subsequently announced that her new show would be titled Megyn Kelly Today, and premiere on September 25, 2017 as a replacement for Today's Take. The new program is structured as a talk show with a studio audience. Critics noted that the program was likely intended as a more direct competitor to the syndicated talk show Live with Kelly and Ryan, with Megyn Kelly trying to convey a \\"softer\\" personality to contrast her Fox News reputation of being an aggressive journalist and interviewer.  Reception  The first episode received negative reviews from critics, panning Kelly for her \\"awkward,\\" \\"chilly\\" performance and failure to connect with the audience. The show attracted controversy during its first week of episodes, which included actress Debra Messing expressing regret for appearing on the program after Kelly asked a Will & Grace fan if the show inspired him to be homosexual, as well as Kelly's questioning of Jane Fonda about her plastic surgery procedures. The incidents prompted widespread criticism of Kelly's daytime hosting abilities. The following week, Kelly again ignited controversy during a panel discussion following a mass shooting in Las Vegas, when Kelly interrupted and spoke over Tom Brokaw after he criticized the NRA, saying \\"Yep. Yep, got it. Gotta leave it at that, Tom. . . . We‚Äôre up against a hard break.\\" During the show's debut week, viewership was down 12 percent from the same time slot compared to the year prior; the second week brought in 24 percent fewer viewers, and the third week saw a 23 percent smaller audience. Additionally, the show trailed in the ratings behind Live with Kelly and Ryan. NBC personalities such as Al Roker, Savannah Guthrie, and Hoda Kotb appeared as co-hosts on various episodes in an attempt to bolster ratings. A month after the premiere, Julia Wallace wrote in USA Today that the show was \\"a disaster\\", but blamed NBC for trying to portray Kelly as an \\"almost comical\\" imitation of Kelly Ripa instead of tapping into the abilities that made her a success at Fox News. Variety noted Megyn Kelly Today for its coverage and discussions of the Me Too movement, including allegations targeting fellow NBC personalities such as Matt Lauer.  Blackface controversy  During the October 23, 2018 episode, Kelly participated in a panel discussion on the appropriateness of blackface in Halloween costumes. During the segment‚Äîwhose panel did not contain any African-American participants‚ÄîKelly recollected that \\"Truly, you do get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on blackface for Halloween or a black person who put on whiteface for Halloween. When I was a kid, that was okay as long as you were dressing up as like a character\\", and added that \\"Luann de Lesseps wants to look like Diana Ross for one day, and I don't know how that got racist on Halloween.\\" Kelly's comments were widely- interpreted as defense of the practice, which is generally considered to be a derogatory caricature of African-Americans. Critics likened Kelly's remarks to a previous incident during her tenure at Fox News Channel, where Kelly asserted that Jesus and Santa Claus were white. Later that day, Kelly issued an internal email apologizing for the remarks, stating that \\"I realize now that such behavior is indeed wrong, and I am sorry\\", and that \\"I've never been a '[politically correct]' kind of person ‚Äî but I understand that we do need to be more sensitive in this day and age. Particularly on race and ethnicity issues which, far from being healed, have been exacerbated in our politics over the past year. This is a time for more understanding, love, sensitivity and honor, and I want to be part of that. I look forward to continuing that discussion.\\" Kelly opened the October 24 episode with a public apology, and joined African-American journalists Amy Holmes and Roland Martin in a discussion over the controversies surrounding blackface. The same day, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Kelly had left the Creative Artists Agency, and had hired an attorney. The week's remaining episodes were replaced by encores.  Cancelation  Alongside the blackface controversy, it was reported that Kelly had discussed ending the program so she could focus more on her role as an NBC News correspondent, but that the comments may have an impact on her overall future at the network. Viewership of Megyn Kelly Today had been stable, but not as high as that of Today's Take. On October 26, 2018, NBC officially announced that Megyn Kelly Today had been canceled, and that its time slot would be assumed by other anchors. Kelly's attorney stated that her future with NBC News was to be determined. Kelly terminated her contract with NBC in January 2019. Since the program's cancellation, the Megyn Kelly Today set has been used for various NBC specials and productions, including occasional audience-based episodes of Today with Hoda & Jenna and All In with Chris Hayes (MSNBC), and currently as an interim studio for The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.

Specifically, this discipline is involved with treating, preventing, and researching traumatic situations and people's reactions to them. It particularly focuses on the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and acute stress disorder (ASD), but can be used to treat any adverse reactions a person may have after experiencing a traumatic event.  History  The emergence of psychotraumatology as a field begins with the legitimization of PTSD as a psychological disorder. Symptoms of PTSD have been continuously reported in the context of war since the 6th century B.C., but it was not officially recognized as a valid disorder until it finally classified by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) in 1980. Once it was officially recognized as an issue, clinical research on PTSD increased dramatically, giving way to the field of psychotraumatology. The term \\"psychotraumatology\\" was coined by George S. Everly, Jr. and Jeffrey M. Lating in the text entitled \\"Psychotraumatology\\" (1995).  Factors examined by psychotraumatology  There are three main categories that are looked at in psychotrauamatology: the factors before, during, and after a psychologically traumatizing event has occurred. Such factors include: # Factors examined before traumatizing event #* Personal developmental history #* Familial history (inclusive of both birth parents and primary guardians) #* Predisposing personality factors #* Occupational, behavioral and psychiatric risk factors #* Predisposing psychological states # Factors examined about traumatizing event #* Environmental, interpersonal, situational, and biological factors # Factors examined after traumatizing event #* Psychological responses to trauma #* Central nervous system, systemic pathophysiological, behavioral and psychophysiological effects from previous conditions #* Familial patterns #* Sociological patterns (inclusive of occupational, community, national, and international)  Major journals in the field  * European Journal of Psychotraumatology * Crisis Stress and Human Resilience * Traumatology * Psychological Trauma * Journal of Traumatic Stress References Branches of psychology Traumatology ","title":"Psychotraumatology"},{"id":"55442568","text":"The Military ranks of Angola are the military insignia used by the Angolan Armed Forces.

The three-term contingency was first defined by B. F. Skinner in the early 1950s. It is often used within ABA to alter the frequency of socially significant human behavior.  Components   Antecedent  The antecedent stimulus occurs first in the contingency and signals that reinforcement or punishment is available on the contingency of a specific behavior. A discriminative stimuli, or SD, directly affects the likelihood of a specific response occurring.  Behavior  The behavior, also referred to as the response, is any observable and measurable action a living organism can do. In the three-term contingency, behavior is operant, meaning it changes the environment in some way.  Consequence  Diagram of consequences in operant conditioning The consequence to a behavior can be reinforcing or punishing. Reinforcing consequences increase the likelihood of a behavior occurring in the future; it is further divided into positive and negative reinforcement. Punishing consequences decrease the likelihood of a behavior occurring in the future; like reinforcement, it is divided into positive and negative punishment. The effectiveness and value of a consequence is determined by the motivating operations the organism has. For example, deprivation of food can make food more effective as a consequence, and the satiation of hunger can make food less effective as a consequence.

He currently holds a joint appointment as a professor at Kyushu University‚Äôs Graduate School of Science and as director of the Super Heavy Element Research Group at Riken's Nishina Center for Accelerator-Based Science.  Professional life  K≈çsuke Morita is a Japanese physicist specializing in experimental nuclear physics. He was born in 1957 in the city of Kitakyushu (Âåó‰πùÂ∑û), located in the prefecture of Fukuoka. In 1979 he graduated from Kyushu University, where he would continue pursuing graduate studies. In 1984, he left Kyushu University after completing the doctoral program without receiving a degree. In an interview, Morita was asked why he left without finishing his PhD thesis. He responded, ‚ÄúThe reason was simple: I did not have the talent to finish it\\". However, he returned to Kyushu University to complete his thesis in 1993, 9 years after beginning graduate studies. After leaving Kyushu University in 1984 Morita joined Riken as a postdoctoral researcher, later on becoming a junior research scientist at Riken's cyclotron Laboratory. In 1991, he was promoted to Research Scientist and in 1993 to Senior Research Scientist. In 2006, he was appointed Chief Scientist of the Superheavy Element Laboratory at Riken's Nishima Center. Morita is currently a professor in the Faculty of Science at Kyushu University, where he has remained since his appointment in 2013. Additionally, he holds a position as the director of the Superheavy Element Production Team at Riken's Nishina Center for Accelerator-Based Science  Research achievements  Morita at the press conference where the name Nihonium (symbol Nh) was officially announced for element 113. (December 1st, 2016)  Synthesis of nihonium  Element 113 was first synthesized in 2004 by the Superheavy Element Production Team at Riken, under direction of K≈çsuke Morita. The element was synthesized using a cold fusion approach, making it the heaviest element discovered using this production method. Synthesis of element 113 was accomplished by bombardment of a 209Bi target with 70Zn projectiles using a beam energy of 352.6 MeV. The experiment concluded with the synthesis of the 278113 isotope of element 113. Morita's team successfully synthesized element 113 in a total of three occasions: July 2004, April 2005, and August 2012. This achievement was officially recognized by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry on December 31, 2015, granting Morita's team the element's naming rights. The name Nihonium was proposed, making reference to Japan's name (Japanese: Êó•Êú¨ Hepburn: Nihon). After a five-month public comment period, the union announced its formal approval on November 30, 2016. Nihonium is currently the only element to have been discovered by an Asian team. The team currently aims to discover element 119, whose provisional name is ununennium.

Unlike general embarrassment, vicarious embarrassment is not caused by participating in an embarrassing event, but instead by witnessing (verbally and/or visually) another person experience an embarrassing event. These emotions can be perceived as pro-social, and some say they can be seen as motives for following socially and culturally acceptable behavior. Vicarious embarrassment (German: Fremdscham) is often seen as an opposite to schadenfreude, which is the feeling of pleasure or satisfaction at misfortune, humiliation or embarrassment of another person. Vicarious embarrassment is different from an emotional contagion, which is when a person unconsciously mimics the emotions that others are experiencing. An emotional contagion is experienced by both people, making it a shared emotion. Vicarious embarrassment often occurs even when the individual experiencing the embarrassing event might not be aware of the implications. For an act to be considered an emotional contagion, more than one person must be affected by the emotion, but in vicarious emotions, it is only necessary that the observer experience the emotion. Furthermore, vicarious embarrassment can be experienced even when the observer is completely isolated. Vicarious embarrassment, like other vicarious emotions, presents symptoms that reflect the original emotion. However, unlike shared emotions, the experience of embarrassment for the observer is dependent on how they normally experience embarrassment. Individuals who experience social anxiety in their own life may experience the familiar symptoms of blushing, excess sweating, trembling, palpitations, and nausea. Other, less severe symptoms may include cringing, looking away, or general discomfort.  Psychological basis   Empathy  Vicarious embarrassment, also known as empathetic embarrassment, is intrinsically linked to empathy. Empathy is the ability to understand the feelings of another and is considered a highly reinforcing emotion to promote selflessness, prosocial behavior, and group emotion, whereas a lack of empathy is related to antisocial behavior. During an embarrassing situation, the observer empathizes with the victim of embarrassment, assuming the feeling of embarrassment. People who have more empathy are more likely to be susceptible to vicarious embarrassment. The capacity to recognize emotions is probably innate, as it may be achieved unconsciously. Yet it can be trained and achieved with various degrees of intensity or accuracy.  Self-projection  Psychological projection is a theory in psychology and psychoanalysis in which humans defend themselves against undesirable emotions by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others. Projection is a considered a normal, common process in everyday life. Vicarious embarrassment and other vicarious emotions, however, work in the reverse, a process called self-projection. The undesirable emotion is experienced in another person, and the observer projects what they interpret as the appropriate response onto themselves. For example, someone who lies easily might feel vicariously embarrassed if they self-project the experience of someone getting caught in a bad lie.  Cultural significance  Embarrassing situations often arise in social situations, as the result of failing to meet a social expectation, and is used to help learn what has been deemed culturally appropriate. While embarrassment isolates the victim based on a cultural bias, vicarious embarrassment is used to promote prosocial behavior between the victim and the observer.  Cringe comedy  Embarrassing situations have been used for a long time in situational comedy, sketch comedy, dramatic irony, and practical jokes. Traditionally, laugh tracks were used to help cue the audience to laugh at appropriate times. But as laugh tracks were removed from sitcoms, embarrassing situations on television were now accompanied by silence, creating a genre known as cringe comedy, which includes many critically acclaimed sitcom television shows, such as the British television series The Office.

Cancer diagnosis Hutton first smoked at age 12 and smoked habitually from her mid-teens to her early 20s, before quitting and becoming what she described as a \\"fanatically intolerant antismoking ex-smoker\\". On 26 November 2004, at the age of 49, she was diagnosed with stage 4 adenocarcinoma, a lung cancer which had metastasised to her bones and lymph nodes; she later wrote \\"there is no stage five\\". Several of her family members had previously died of lung cancer. Hutton said that there was evidence that low tar cigarettes like the Silk Cut she had smoked were more dangerous as they are inhaled deeper, in contrast to the safe and feminine image with which they are regarded. She pointed out that more teenage girls than boys smoke although their lungs are less resistant to carcinogens, and that lung cancer had overtaken breast cancer as the biggest killer of women. She urged the British government to take note of smoking among teenage girls. Hutton wrote a book titled What Can I Do To Help? with advice for companions of people with cancer, including contributions from public figures such as Tony Benn and Cherie Blair. It was published the day before her death, with all proceeds going to Macmillan Cancer Support. Macmillan offered a volunteering award in Hutton's memory. Her widower Charlie Stebbings set up Cut Films, which makes films encouraging teenagers not to smoke.

This finding shows that evidence that makes a defendant's guilt more or less probable will not necessarily make a guilty verdict more or less likely, which suggests that the judgments made in courts are not governed by rational decision making.  Origins  This behavioral effect was first established in a series of experiments by psychologist Gary L. Wells. This study examined the difference between how mock jurors judged naked statistics (statistical evidence that is unrelated to the specific case) and other forms of evidence, and found that a simple probability-threshold model (i.e., that jurors decide guilt when the subjective probability of guilt crosses a threshold value) cannot account for juror behavior. The experiments were based on variants of the hypothetical Blue Bus Case, which first appeared in the legal literature to describe the unsuitability of naked statistics in trial. In Wells's studies, participants were asked to rule on a case in which a woman had watched her dog get struck by a bus and killed, but was unable to identify the bus. One group of participants (in the rate of traffic case) was presented with evidence that the Blue Bus Company was responsible for 80% of the traffic on the road, and the competing Gray Bus Company was responsible for the other 20%; a second group (in the weight attendant case) was presented with the testimony of a weight attendant who made a record indicating that a Blue Bus was on the road at a time corresponding to the accident, and that of a second witness who testified that this record was known to be incorrect 20% of the time. When asked to guess the probability that the Blue Bus Company was responsible for the accident, participants from both groups correctly reported an average 80% chance. However, when asked to make a determination of guilt in the case, those in the first group made a judgment against the Blue Bus Company only 8.2% of the time, while those in the second group found the Blue Bus Company liable in 67.1% of the cases.  Variants and proposed mechanisms  The original study found evidence for a process Wells described as \\"fact- to-evidence reasoning\\". A juror engaged in such reasoning would ignore evidence unless the evidence itself can (or cannot) be supported by the judgment of the ultimate fact. I.e., jurors would ignore naked statistics (such as the rate of traffic) because the identity of the responsible bus wouldn't prove or disprove the statistics, but jurors would consider the weight attendant's testimony because his testimony could be supported (or not) by the identity of the responsible bus. In two additional experiments, participants were presented with the tire tracks case or the tire tracks- belief case. Both cases relied on the testimony of a transportation official who examined the prints of tire tracks and compared them to the buses from the two companies. In the tire tracks case, the official testified that the tracks matched 80% of the Blue Bus Company buses, and 20% of the Gray Bus Company buses. In the tire tracks-belief case, the official testified that he used a tire-matching technique that provides correct results 80% of the time, and he believed that a specific blue bus was responsible for the accident. As before, participants reported an average 80% probability that a blue bus struck the dog in both cases. However, the tire tracks participants tended not to judge against the Blue Bus Company, while the tire tracks-belief participants did. Subsequent research has led to the proposal of an \\"ease-of-simulation\\" mechanism being responsible for the effect. Niedermeier, Kerr, and Mess√© (1999) argued that jurors in Wells's experiments ruled in favor of the Blue Bus Company when they had an easier time imagining that the Gray Bus Company was responsible for the accident. They replicated the Wells Effect but also included manipulations that were meant to make it easier to imagine that a gray bus was responsible. For instance, their partial-match/simulation case was similar to Wells's tire tracks-belief case, except the witness was cross- examined by the defense and admitted that it was possible that a gray bus caused the accident. The researchers also probed participants with new questions meant to measure the ease of this mental simulation (e.g., \\"on an 11-point scale, how easy it was to imagine that a Grey Bus Company bus ran over the dog\\"). In these experiments, participants were less likely to make a judgment against the Blue Bus Company in cases where they had an easier time imagining that a gray bus was responsible for the accident, even though they reported an identical probability that a blue bus was responsible. More recent work has endorsed a model of juror decision making that includes subjective probability of guilt as only one of its inputs. Arkes, Shoots-Reinhard, & Mayes (2012) identified factors that influenced verdicts only by influencing subjective probability, and factors that influenced verdicts without changing subjective probability. For example, the addition of a non-diagnostic witness (whose testimony was shown to be unreliable during cross-examination) influenced verdicts but not subjective probability. On the other hand, negative evidence (i.e., evidence that they Gray Bus Company was not responsible) caused participants to erroneously make lower probability judgements that a blue bus struck the dog, and resulted in a concordant decrease in guilty verdicts. Across three experiments, the researchers also measured participants' level of agreement with the statement, \\"it is unfair to blame the Blue Bus Company unless you can prove that they hit the dog; just stating what is likely isn‚Äôt enough evidence, the plaintiff must show that they were directly involved in the accident.\\" Levels of agreement were strongly correlated with verdicts in favor of the Blue Bus Company across case variants. This body of work also supports an earlier non-empirical argument positing that jurors would object to the use of naked statistics on the grounds of morality, because doing so would deny the autonomy of the defendant; the morality of basing a decision on statistical evidence can influence verdicts without influencing the subjective probability of guilt.

It is the principal Anglican church in the city of Wollongong and the mother-church of the Bishop of Wollongong. It was designed by Edmund Blacket and built from 1858 to 1859. The property is owned by the Anglican Church Property Trust. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Aboriginal communities were present in the area, and first encountered Europeans in 1796. From the 1810s, cedar cutters operated in the Illawarra escarpment rainforests as the first European industry in the area. Dr Charles Throsby used the coastal Illawarra grasslands as cattle fodder in 1815, opening the area to European settlement. He focused his herd behind the fresh water lagoon, then situated at the junction of the current day Harbour and Smith Streets where he built a stockman's hut and cattle yards. The first settlement in the area now known as Wollongong was by Charles Throsby Smith, nephew of Throsby. He was one of the first to receive a land grant in the district and in 1822 was the first to settle on his 300-acre parcel. Smith's barn, located near Wollongong harbour, became the first school house in 1826 and then church building in 1828. A military presence was established in the area now known as Port Kembla in 1826. They were relocated to the area now known as Wollongong in 1830. They were replaced by a local magistrate in 1833. This activity was focused around the harbour. In 1834 Smith's land was nominated as the site for the township to be known as Wollongong.Detom Design, 2011. In 1834 Surveyor General Major Thomas Mitchell surveyed the town with the centrepiece of land devoted to the Church of England. As there was no Crown land in Wollongong, Throsby Smith sold his land to the Government, and it was transferred to the church. The surveyed town was bounded by streets to be known as Harbour, Keira and Crown Streets. The St Michael's site was the centrepiece of the town layout. St. Michael's church was built in 1859 and designed by Edmund Blacket for a church community that was small but had expectations of substantial growth. Serving a large region originally isolated by topographic constraints, St Michael's has served Wollongong throughout the most significant phases of the region's development. A focus of community activity and endeavour throughout that growth, the church has substantially contributed to the character of the township that was to become New South Wales' third largest city, and one of the main industrial centres of Australia. Wollongong expanded in the 1880s and the railway which finally linked the area to Sydney, encouraged movement away from Mitchell's plan. The relative isolation of the Illawarra ended in 1888 when the Illawarra railway was finally introduced to link the area to Sydney. The town was transformed from a focus on the wharves to one on the railway and began to expand away from St. Michael's central position. The rail allowed the area to ship milk, coal and coke to Sydney city, expanding Wollongong city's potential enormously.McDonald, 1989, in Davies, 2003, 14 Reverend Elder succeeded Reverend Ewing in 1892. At his arrival, the press began agitating for an on- site rectory. Dean Ewing had lived in \\"Cormiston\\" (demolished after 1960) which was possibly designed by Blacket. Despite the hardship of the times - the 1890s had brought years of depression to Australia - and no funds, the church bowed to the pressure and built the rectory in 1893‚Äì1894. A Mr Bevan completed the building. There is no mention of its architect. By the turn of the century a smelting works and number of coke oven batteries were opened and the town's population rose from 1635 in 1881 to 3545 in 1901 (an average growth rate of 3.9%). A second and worse mining disaster occurred in 1902, when the Mt. Kembla mine exploded, killing 96 men and boys, possibly Australia's worst land disaster. A state military funeral was held at St. Michael's for Major MacCabe, who died rescuing trapped miners. Changes to mining practices were implemented as a result of this disaster and the Bellbird Mine disaster of 1923. More significantly, the unions were strengthened and formed the Miners' Federation in 1908. The strike of 1909 brought a rebuke in the form of the Industrial Disputes Amendment Act and prosecution of the Miners' leader, but over the next 20 years the miners would win improved conditions.McDonald, 1989, 49, in Davies, 2003, 16 Elder's successor enjoyed a better period when the city was expanding its industrial base. Revered D'Arcy Irvine encouraged expansion of the parish and formation of new parishes. A conservative Anglican, he enjoyed the warm support of the Wollongong church. He left Wollongong in 1907 with a large and growing congregation, and would go on to become a widely loved Bishop Coadjutor of Sydney. Irvine's successor entered at the end of the term of the great administrator, Bishop Saumarez Smith's 19 years as Archbishop. Smith had been unable to resolve growing enmity between the Evangelicals and the Anglo- Catholics throughout this time. The incoming Reverend Lampard was regarded as something of an \\"extreme\\" Evangelical by the Anglo-Catholic group of the \\"Church Association\\", sufficiently so to motivate them to warn the congregation of St. Michael's before his arrival. Lampard inherited a strong congregation from Irvine. This time of expansion found expression in the Church Hall built on the corner of the site in 1908. In addition the rectory was fitted with the newly developing technologies, the telephone (1907) and town water (1909). The 1908 Hall is well built and true to the period, enhances the church by its form and siting without attempting to compete. The two form a strong urban relationship within the site and the hall's significance is derived more from its relationship with the church than its own individual merit. It features an interesting ceiling structure with exposed ornate trusses. It has been damaged by later work, and division of the building into offices makes appreciation of the interior difficult. In 1909 the Church sold the Corrimal Street site and the Glebe land to the south to the city. They used the funds to make \\"extensive alterations\\" to the interior of St. Michael's. These involved raising of the east end of the church, extension of the chancel platform, raising the choir stalls, with a step for the holy table, purchase and installation of a cedar reading desk and clergy seat.Lamb, et al, 1984, in Davies, 2003, 17 1908 was a time of crisis between the two leading ideologies within the Church of England, concerning vestments of priests and formality of the liturgy. At the end of Reverend Stubbin's ministry in 1922, Wollongong had all the hallmarks of a town about to grow into a very large city. Archbishop John Wright looked to put a strong Evangelical into the parish to see it through this growth. He found Reverend Knox, an outspoken Evangelical who had spent 10 years ministering in the High Church world of Adelaide. A highly intelligent and fine expository speaker, Knox confounded Wright's strategy by exchanging parishes with Reverend Walker of Chatswood in 1924, which led him to a leading role in Diocesan affairs. Knox initiated the second hall on the Wollongong site and whilst gathering funds found he was losing the struggle against inertia to achieve its completion before he left. His son Broughton Knox went on to become principal of Moore College, Sydney. The period between 1900 and 1920 was one of substantial growth for the Illawarra region. Whilst the population of the area that is now Wollongong city easily outstripped all but Sydney and Newcastle in size, the area was still characterised by pockets of population over a wide area and was not rated as a NSW city. In 1907 the population was 17.172, large by NSW standards of the time. In 1911 it was 24.940 and in 1920 32.381, a sustained growth rate of 3.7% and 2.6%. The 1940s boundary sandstone fences and retaining walls were dedicated as a memorial. A plaque is located in the northern boundary fence adjacent to the site entrance. Portable sandstone benches (also memorials) are located within the landscape to the south of the cathedral. The one hundredth anniversary of the foundation stone ceremony in 1958 saw improvements to the church and the construction of the curate's cottage. The growth of Wollongong in the post-war period is astonishing. The city grew from 62,960 in 1947 to 90,852 in 1954 (5.4%), and 131,754 in 1961 (5.5%). Wollongong was by this time amongst Australia's largest cities.McDonald, 1989, 57, in Davies, 2003, 25 In 1962 the role of Archdeacon became a separate position from Rector and Rural Dean, and Reverend Pitt was appointed Archdeacon of Wollongong. With two senior ministers overseeing the Illawarra region, the Sydney Synod purchased the Wollongong Fire Station for use in diocesan activities in Wollongong. St.Michael's began work with the local court, and the curate became part-time Court Chaplain. A drop-in centre was initiated, a Home Mission Society opportunity shop opened and an aged- persons home was opened.Lamb, 1984, 57-8, in Davies, 2003, 25 The grant of land to the Church of England made in 1842 was subdivided in 1963 and the corner of the site was leased to a service station. The site was consciously set apart in Mitchell's survey plan and this subdivision and development was a disturbing change to the urban environment of the historical part of Wollongong. In 1967 some significant work was carried out to the church buildings. Funded by the lease of the service station, the most obvious change was the blonde brick kindergarten extension to the 1925 hall, originally built as a space to hold regional gatherings. St Michael's was inaugurated as a pro- cathedral in 1970. The church was forced to relocate its rector away from the site in the 1980s as the lack of security was becoming untenable. It leased the curate's cottage for similar reasons. Canon Graham's ministry at St. Michael's spanned 1984‚Äì1891. He worked under Bishop Harry Goodhew (1982‚Äì93) throughout his term. The pressure of the enlarged ministry at St.Michael's appears to have reached its zenith in the mid 1980s. The number of proposals for the site increased and the resolution of property issues was high on the agenda. The main focus in the change of buildings was the possibility of a new cathedral building, funded by commercial development on the site. The focus of the brief was now overtly Evangelical, the \\"immediacy\\" of the congregation needed to be greater than that possible in the old church. The new building needed to be sufficiently flexible to provide an intimate area as well as cater for very large services. The main motivation however was that the church wanted something in keeping with the concept of a cathedral. In 1985 Wollongong City Council zoned the service station portion of the site with a plot ratio of 1.5:1. This was used as the basis for commercial proposal for the west end of the site. The 1986 population of Wollongong fell from 176,100 in 1984 to 173,550. Despite this the 1980s was a time of high property demands and many controversial high rise developments ensued.McDonald, 1989, in Davies, 2003, 28-9 The remarkably intact church building became a Cathedral at the centre of a regional Anglican Diocese in 1982 and continues its prominent role in the life of the surrounding community.Davies, 2003. In the mid 1980s Wollongong City Council threw its weight behind a drive for tourism to reduce the city's dependence on coal and steel. Income from tourism doubled between 1983 and 1985. An international hotel opened in 1983 and major conference facilities were completed in 1989, A leisure precinct was developed along the beachfront, the harbour was redeveloped, cycleways introduced and a heritage trail and drive were promoted in 1988. The council's Cityplan also aided construction of the Crown Gateway Shopping Centre (1986), Wollongong Mall (1987) and Council Administration Building and Performing Arts Centre (1988). The mid-1980s proposals for the St.Michael's site spanned a range of ideas including: liturgical reordering of the historic church, small extensions, multiple galleries with greatly increased seating, reworking the offices in the 1908 hall with an upper floor, additions to the 1925 hall, demolition of the 1908 hall, construction of a large modern cathedral against the historic (but decommissioned) cathedral, and numerous designs for commercial buildings on the west of the site. All had impacts on the place's significance but none proceeded past the draft stage. The church began to firm up on the idea of selling a portion of the site for a commercial venture, and put in train the necessary feasibility studies. Reinforcing the problems of the old church, the 1859 floor was replaced in 1987. Remnants of the rotted structure are displayed in the south porch. In the 1980s camellias (Camellia japonica cv.s) were installed at the base of the cathedral walls commemorating past congregation members. In recognition of its prominent place in NSW's history, a Permanent Conservation Order was placed on St Michael's Cathedral in 1988. The Anglican Property Trust objected to the order, stating that in their opinion only the 1859 church was of significance and outlining the commercial proposal at risk. The Heritage Council in December 1988 modified the order boundaries to suit the development and exempted all buildings except the cathedral and former rectory. The listing has since been transferred to the NSW State Heritage Register making the NSW Heritage Council the consent authority for works to the site. St Michael's congregation commissioned the Conservation Management Plan to guide management requirements and opportunities of the 1859 church building. The Conservation Management Plan (CMP) was endorsed subject to conditions by the Heritage Council under delegated authority in October, 2003. In recent times church policy has been not to permit the installation of memorials in any format in the cathedral grounds.  Description  ;Site The site is within the locally significant Market Street heritage conservation area. It consists of the modern UOW Marketview Student Residence (originally an Ibis Hotel)in two connected pavilions bounding the western side, the 1925 hall and 1908 hall (now Church Offices) along the northern side; the cathedral on the middle of the eastern side facing Church Street, a garden area to the south-east corner featuring lawns, a mature Cook's pine (Araucaria columnaris), brush box (Lophostemon confertus) and Port Jackson fig (Ficus rubiginosa), the 1892 Rectory midway along the southern side, again surrounded by lawns. The cathedral is sited at the high point of a hill and is visible for some distance along the east and west Market Street axis. The original town plan sited the St.Michael's site as the focal point of long view corridors. ;Church What is now St Michael's Cathedral was originally constructed in 1859 as a church building. The church is a well proportioned stone Gothic building designed by Edmund Blacket to sit on the commanding hilltop site in the middle of Market Street, Wollongong. The Victorian Gothic Revival stone building has some aspects that were not typical of the standard rural parish designed by Blacket at the time, including bellcote and strong geometrical planning. It is located centrally along the Market Street axis on a hilltop and set within a rectangular shaped block of . The church has a remarkably geometric influence, the plan being completely symmetrical with balanced porches and transepts, and the plan being seven bays of long by two bays of wide. The building is more pretentious than country parish churches, and the octagonal bell cote distinguishes it from more common parish churches that feature a rectangular bell cote. The external stonework (sandstone) is in remarkably good condition, predominantly due to the severity of the detailing. The interior has suspended timber floors, tongue and groove, which are generally sparrow-picked stone, with smooth faced stone around openings, indicating that the walls are not intended for render. The roof trusses sit on the unfinished stone block brackets. The reredos (panels behind the Holy Table) is fixed up against the internal stone wall. The windows to the nave and transepts all have Gothic paired \\"cusped lancets\\" with stained glass windows. The doors are generally double timber ledged framed doors with cover strip made to fit the Gothic arches. Ceilings are raked. The roof frame consists of trusses formed from an arch beam with the roofing material being slate.Engel, 2002 ;Other built elements Other built elements on the site date from 1892 (rectory), 1908 (hall), 1925 (hall) 1958 (curate's residence) and 1967 (kindergarten), in addition to the Ibis Hotel, which now lines the entire western side of the block, and replaced the 1963 service station. Of these, the halls in particular have a strong relationship with the cathedral and form a strong urban setting in conjunction with it, which is recognised by current heritage listings. ;Condition The church is generally in good condition and is remarkably intact as was inspected on site in March 2001 by James Nicholson for Paul Davies Pty Ltd.  Modifications and dates  Throughout the entire period of the church's use of the site, the landscape has been characterised by change. Records indicate that buildings have taken precedence over landscape to support the growing congregation's operational needs as they developed over time. Disturbances include the 1908 and 1925 halls' construction. The 1940s saw formalising of surrounding roads with kerbs and sealed pavements. Sandstone fences and retaining walls were installed on site boundaries, allowing flattening of steep gradients on the road verge and requiring removal of almost all of the significant early mature boundary trees. Formally placed plantings along the top of the eastern wall and randomly placed trees and shrubs were installed and removed during the ensuing period. The 1980s saw planting of small shrubs, groundcovers and annuals, where prior to that plantings were generally limited to large trees in grassed open space. Site levels appear to have remained relatively constant in areas between cathedral and the two halls. The layout of the north‚Äìsouth vehicular thoroughfare and southern turning circle are elements that have remained from the original layout until the present. However the levels and surface treatments have undergone some alteration over time. The open space between 1925/67 hall and 1859 rectory has been subject of various changes. Significant ground disturbance has occurred here in the following ways: *1960s-2000s installation and later removal of pre-school fencing; *2000s removal of large mature trees including roots; *2000s during construction of adjacent 150 room Ibis hotel immediately to west, construction of large retaining wall at western extent of area with associated drainage earthworks, ground level amendment for site construction office, installation of concrete path and new grass cover. The latter site is where the proposed amphitheatre is to be constructed.  Heritage listing  The prominent siting of St Michael's reflects the historic primacy of the Church of England in setting the direction for the Wollongong community, and the site remains a dominant landmark within a large metropolis. St Michael's built fabric and site development demonstrate the long-standing impact of the church upon its community. As the seat of the bishop in the Wollongong region of the Diocese of Sydney, the cathedral has associations with official recognition of the importance of the region to the state as a whole. St Michael's rectors and parishioners have always had a strong association with the leaders of the Wollongong community. Since the time of Dean Ewing, many St Michael's rectors have had the responsibility of overseeing the church activities of the Illawarra region as Rural Dean. St Michael's has had a strong association with the Church of England's national leadership. Bishops William Broughton, Frederic Barker, and Archbishops Saumarez Smith, John Wright and Howard Mowll all demonstrated a special and personal focus in the leadership and strategy for St Michael's, resulting in a church with strong ties to the Evangelical tradition within the Anglican Church. The perceptible upgrading of St Michael's importance in the post war period has created associations with some of the leading figures within the denomination. It has a special association with the retiring Sydney Archbishop Harry Goodhew who was rector, Archdeacon and Bishop of Wollongong. Blacket's design for St Michael's has some unusual features and is amongst the earliest works where Blacket began to express his own architectural confidence. The church structure remains largely intact as built, and much of the interior remains as Blacket envisioned it. The building is a high quality and rare example of a Gothic parish church with a developed geometrical base in its symmetry and planning layout. Its quality reflects the optimistic character of the local community in 1858. the church is part of a larger grouping of significant buildings that combine to form the most prominent historic group of buildings in Wollongong, and one that compares with the better civic groups in country NSW. St Michael's Cathedral, Wollongong was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

This overlap in meaning has led some researchers to consider a more detailed definition for each type of rescue that details 'assessment and documentation of pre- and post-translocation genetic ancestry'. Not every example of genetic rescue is clearly successful and the current definition of genetic rescue does not mandate that the process result in a 'successful' outcome. Despite an ambiguous definition, genetic rescue is viewed positively, with many perceived successes.  History  The conceptual foundation of genetic rescue can be traced back to the work of geneticist Sewall Wright, who studied the effect of immigration among populations linked by gene flow. More recently, genetic rescue has been defined by scientific reviews as: \\"when population fitness, inferred from some demographic vital rate or phenotypic trait, increases by more than can be attributed to the demographic contribution of immigrants.\\" Genetic mixing leading to fitness recovery could be described as \\"genetic rescue\\", but perpetuates the unclear differences between genetic rescue and pollution.  Genetic processes  When a species' population becomes too small, they are subject to genetic processes such as inbreeding depression from a lack of gene flow, allelic fixation from genetic drift, and loss of diversity. In combination these can lead to a decrease in population fitness, and increase the risk of extinction. Genetic rescue is a conservation tool which tries to address these genetic factors by moving genes from one population to another to increase the overall genetic diversity and minimize inbreeding. This conservation technique intended to increase the fitness of a small, imperiled population through the introduction of beneficial alleles through migration. It is often used for populations of species that are at a high risk of extinction. A successful genetic rescue occurs when the addition of new genes effectively introduces genetic diversity that leads to increased population size and growth rate, as well as a greater population fitness. An unsuccessful genetic rescue may occur if the addition of new genes causes outbreeding depression, which decreases their population fitness. Too much gene flow may lead to genetic swamping through extensive hybridization. Genetic rescue can occur through multiple pathways, including heterosis and adaptive evolution. It is closely related to, but distinctly different from the concepts of genetic pollution, evolutionary rescue, genetic restoration, and assisted gene flow.  Gene flow  Gene flow (migration) is the introduction of new individuals (and genes) into a target population. Predicting the impact of a migrant on a population will depend on combination of complex genetic and non-genetic factors. Whether migration increases population fitness will depend if the genes brought in are adapted to local conditions and if they decrease levels of inbreeding in the target population. An Introduced individuals can also positively or negatively affect genetic rescue through behaviors such as mate choice, dominance hierarchies, and infanticide.  Genetic drift  Genetic drift is the fixation of alleles by chance, hence reducing the overall diversity in the population. Genetic rescue can restore diversity by adding new genes to a population, counteracting fixation.  Selection and local adaptation  Natural selection occurs when variations in heritable traits determines reproductive success of an individual, and thereby determines the persistence of that trait in that population. Genetic rescue may introduce traits that are advantageous to the target population or reduced the frequency of disadvantageous traits, increasing the net fitness of a population to ensure the continued survival as a species.  Controversy  Genetic rescue can be a controversial tool because it is hard to predict how a population will be affected by a migration event. Genetic rescue has the possibility of actually lowering the fitness of a population by swamping the population or increasing rare deleterious alleles. This instance may simply be termed genetic pollution instead of being referred to genetic rescue. Rescue may also only be a short-term solution, as shown by the case of the Isle Royale Wolves. In that case, genetic rescue of the wolves resulted in a large initial increase in population fitness followed by a large decline in subsequent years. Many conservationists argue that genetic rescue could create unforeseen problems for species at risk, and that it overlooks the underlying problems that push so many species to the brink of extinction, including habitat loss due to human development. As with the term genetic pollution, 'genetic rescue' has political connotations. Some of the more controversial practices which can be considered genetic rescue include *De-extinction. *Genetic engineering to produce plants resistant to pests and disease. Although some environmental groups include the use of genetic engineering to save species in their use of genetic pollution. *Hybridization that increases the viability of endangered populations suffering from inbreeding and genetic drift or saves endlings may be considered part of genetic rescue.  Examples   Florida panther  A case of successful genetic rescue can be observed in the Florida panther population. Habitat loss and other anthropogenic influences led to small, inbred population which increased the decline of this subspecies (Puma concolor coryi), . Inbreeding depression resulted in kinked tails and cowlicks, sperm defects, and heart abnormalities. The population reached a low of approximately 22 panthers. Fearing inevitable extinction, eight panthers from Texas (Puma concolor stanleyana) were translocated to Florida in the mid 1990s. This effort was deemed successful after analysis showed a 4% annual population growth rate following the immigration event. Additionally, researchers found that the resulting hybrid kittens were three times more likely to survive to adulthood than purebred kittens. The Florida panther population increased from around 25 to over 100 individuals in roughly a decade.  Isle Royale wolves  A case of unsuccessful genetic rescue can be observed in the Isle Royale wolf population. In 1997, a single wolf arrived on the island and bred with the wolf population of about 25 individuals. Initially, the addition of his genetic variation resulted in a positive effects on the population , shown by a large increase in population fitness. However, the addition of genetic variation by this immigrant was only beneficial in the short term. The population swiftly declined, with only two wolves sighted in 2016. it is possible that the new immigrant brought a new detrimental allele that increased in frequency as he interbred with the original population or that a single individual was insufficient to overcome the negative impact of genetic load.  Greater prairie chicken  The greater prairie chicken is a ground- nesting bird with ecological and evolutionary hurdles that necessitated genetic rescue to avoid extinction. It was widely distributed across the North American great plains but now requires population management in small remnant areas. In Illinois, the greater prairie chicken declined from millions of individuals in the mid 19th century to 46 by 1998. This prompted genetic rescue efforts and movement of individuals from neighboring states to increase Illinois greater prairie chicken numbers. This has been considered an early and successful case of genetic rescue. Although the initial genetic rescue actions seem to have led to an increase in fitness, prairie habitat is now limiting recovery. Exclusively genetic efforts to rescue the species are considered insufficient and more focus on habitat protection may be required to save the species.

With the establishment of the General Grand Chapter, which would have full control over the ritual, Butler was elected to its highest office, becoming its first Most Worthy Grand Matron (1876‚Äì78). To be active among the first in any movement which is successful is to occupy a position of prominence. To be the first Matron of the first chapter in any State is an honor to any member of the Order of the Eastern Star; to be the first Grand Matron of a Grand Chapter is a greater honor; but to be the first Most Worthy Grand Matron of the General Grand Chapter ‚Äîthe federated head of the Order‚Äî was the highest honor one could receive within the Order. Butler (n√©e Golcher) was born in England in 1831. With her family, she came to the United States as a child, and settled in Pennsylvania. Her early womanhood was spent in Philadelphia, where she married Joseph Butler. In 1857, they moved to Chicago, Illinois, with their children. Upon the introduction of the Order into Illinois, she became a charter member, and Matron of Miriam Chapter, No. 1. When, the Order taking shape and system, the General Grand Chapter was organized by the representatives of the various Grand Chapters, at Indianapolis, Indiana, in November, 1876, Butler was unanimously elevated to the office of Most Worthy Grand Matron. Butler Chapter No. 36 was named in her honor. She died in 1906. Early years Elizabeth Golcher was born in Birmingham, England, October l6, 1831. At the age of 9, her parents came to the United States. After spending two or three years in changing localities, a permanent home was established in Philadelphia, where Butler grew up. Career In Philadelphia, she met her future husband, Joseph Butler, whom she married, July 4, 1850. After eight years, during which they had three children, the family removed their business to Chicago. In 1863, Joseph was made a member of Garden City Lodge A. F. & A. M. and in a short time after, was chosen as the Worshipful Master. He also became a Sir Knight in Chicago Commandery. When the idea of organizing a Chapter of the Eastern Star was proposed among their friends, the Butlers united their efforts with others in bringing it to a successful issue. A charter bearing date March 1, 1869, was granted them, as Miriam Chapter No. 1, of Illinois, with Mrs. Butler as Worthy Matron, which office she filled for two successive terms, and one after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. She said that upon receiving the degrees, she was impressed with the adaptiveness of the workings of the Order as an aid to woman in her individual efforts to better fit herself, socially and mentally, for the wider sphere of activities that seemed to be opening for her, and that therein she could find opportunities for useful work, however feeble her efforts, in making the Order a mighty lever to raise woman to a higher plane. She determined to unite with those who were endeavoring to bring the Order to a position where it would be deserving of general recognition. Her steady and persistent efforts for the advancement of the interests of her own chapter, led naturally to her elevation to the Grand East when the Grand Chapter was organized in 1875. The difficulties attending the establishment of the Order at that period could not be realized, aside from actual experience. As the Order progressed through the different states, it was found necessary to secure a more perfect uniformity of ritual work, and the several Grand Chapters proposed to make a General Grand body, which should have full control over the ritual, and appointed delegates to convene in session in the city of Indianapolis, where it was satisfactorily organized. Butler being present as the representative of Illinois had the honor to be selected as the first Most Worthy Grand Matron. Soon after the establishment of the Order in Illinois, the attention of the first Worthy Matron was drawn to the peculiar adaptation of the work as an aid to the outlook for widening the sphere of woman's usefulness, which was then being strongly agitated in general society, and as a factor to that end, Butler was led to feel that its success was a matter of the highest interest to women. Butler was heard on many occasions to remark that the Eastern Star contained in itself, not only all the facilities for the practice of benevolence and other kindred virtues suggested to woman, but it might further become a source for women to develop abilities and establish claims to a share in the advancement of social and civil reform. When in the performance of her duties as Grand Lecturess of Illinois, she made every effort to impress her audience with her own ideas in this respect. Much of the stalwart vigor which characterized the Order in Illinois, was due to her earnestness and sincerity, which was the more evident when the fact was known that she never asked remuneration for either labor or travel, and never presented a bill of expenses of any kind, to either Grand or Subordinate Chapters. A most unusual peculiarity in Butler's experience, was that every position to which she had been appointed or elected in the Order, from a District Deputy up to the Most Worthy Grand Matron, she was always No. 1, being after the creation of the office, selected as the first to fill it. This bears its own merit and speaks well for pioneer service. Personal life On January 27, 1885, she became a widow, her husband's death being the final result of a paralytic stroke, which occurred over five years previous. They had eight children, four sons and four daughters. She died July 13, 1906, and was buried beside her husband in Rosehill Cemetery.

Career Her early education was acquired in the district school, and after teaching for two years she entered Alfred University, Alfred (village), New York, and received the degree of A. B. She was afterwards a teacher in the Institute for the Blind in New York City. She spent her married life at the Institute, but her influence flowed outward into wider channels. Recognizing the need of a broader and more practical education for women, in 1868 she entered the New York Medical College and Hospital for Women, in New York City. In 1871 she received the degree of M D. In 1869 Alfred University conferred upon her the degree of A. M., recognizing her merit. Wait rendered valuable service in church work and for ten years she was president of the Dorcas Society of her local church and she was one of the managers of the Baptist Home for the Aged. She was a member of the national and county medical societies, showing in her essays on medical and kindred topics ability and originality in step with medical progress. In 1879 she received the diploma of the New York Ophthalmic Hospital and College. In 1880 she was elected to the chair of obstetrics in the New York Medical College and Hospital for Women. In that special line of medical work she was best known, and in it she showed exceptional skill and ability. In 1883 she was made chairman of the hospital stiff, which position she held uninterruptedly for many years.

Biography Elizabeth Subercaseaux grew up near Cauqenes, Chile at her grandparents' home called Santa Clara. Subercaseaux's father died in 1956, when he was 42 years old and she was 11. The five children of the marriage ‚Äì Bernardo and Juan, older than Elizabeth, and Martin and Ximena, younger ‚Äì were brought up by their mother, the sculptor, painter, and photographer Gerda Sommerhoff, who was a German and grew up in Holland. She is the great-great- granddaughter of the German composer Robert Schumann and Clara Wieck. After finishing high school in 1967, she traveled to Spain with her first husband, , from whom she would be separated seven years later and with whom she had three children: Angelica, Alejandra, and Carlos Lav√≠n Subercaseaux. Career Elizabeth Subercaseaux began her journalistic career as a contributor to the Nuevo Diario of Madrid. On her return to Chile in 1974, she served as director of the children's magazine El Peque, taught at the University of Chile's School of Journalism, and performed interviews for the magazines Cosas, Apsi, Master, and Caras. In 1990 she traveled to the United States, where she currently lives with her husband, Spanish-American literature professor, literary critic, and translator, John J. Hassett. There, in addition to continuing to write for various media, she has been a lecturer. She is a regular contributor to Ocean Drive magazine, and the newspapers La Naci√≥n of Santiago and Al D√≠a of Philadelphia. For 18 years she was a columnist for the magazine Vanidades Continental. \\"La Tia Eulogia\\", her humor column, was very successful in Latin America. Subercaseaux has been a columnist, interviewer, and reporter in various media, including the magazines Apsi, Cosas, Caras, Cuadernos Cervantes, El S√°bado, Vanidades Continental, Master, and Vivir Mejor. She has been a correspondent for the BBC, as well as for the Colombian magazine Semana and the Argentine '. It has been noted that \\"her work, mainly testimonial, is of political and social criticism of her country, with permanent concern for human rights and for the role of Chilean women in the last decades.\\" She has been cited as a major force in guiding public opinion about Augusto Pinochet, especially in grassroots movements. After attempting to arrange an interview with him for fifteen years, Subercaseaux finally received a chance to interview the dictator in 1988. In interviews with Subercaseaux after her time in Chile, she speaks of the great terror felt by uncensored journalists in Chile during the time of Pinochet's dictatorship. Subercaseaux was beaten by police on her own street when she lived in Chile. Half of her family was in exile during Pinochet's reign. Her first book of fiction, the story compilation Silendra, was published in 1986, though she claims to have been writing since age 10. In 1988 her first novel, El canto de la ra√≠z lejana, was published. Since then this has been her main genre, and she has written 25 books, among which are humor features, novels (two of crime fiction), and books of short journalistic pieces. Subercaseaux's Barrio Alto series ‚Äì the books Vendo casa en el Barrio Alto (2009), Compro Lago Caburga (2011), and Cl√≠nica Jard√≠n del Este (2013) ‚Äì constitute a portrait of Chilean society at the beginning of the 21st century. included the first in his book of essays Las novelas de la oligarqu√≠a chilena. The second novel, a continuation of the portrait of the upper class to which Subercaseaux herself belongs, was well received by critics and repeated the successful sales of Vendo casa en el Barrio Alto.

The decrease of the collision energy spread can be accomplished without reducing the inherent energy spread of either of the two colliding beams, introducing opposite correlations between spatial position and energy at the interaction point (IP). In beam-optical terms, this can be accomplished through a non-zero dispersion function for both beams of opposite sign at the IP. The dispersion is determined by the respective lattice. History Monochromatization is a technique which has been proposed since a long time for reducing the centre-of-mass energy spread at e‚àíe+ colliders, but this has never been used in any operational collider. This technique was first proposed by 1975 by A. Renieri to improve energy resolution of Italian collider Adone.

She was the first certified midwife in the country, as well as the first woman to attain a political office in Greenland. She was the first women appointed Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog. Early life Elisabeth Maria Sara Johansen was born on 1 August 1907 in Uummannaq, Greenland to Johanne Marie Gjertrud Fleichser and Johan Emil Hans Henningsen (da). Her father was a local council member of the Confederated Cabinet between 1862 and 1863 and in 1911 became a noted member of the North Greenland Provincial Council. Her childhood, as was typical for upper-class girls, did not include schooling. In 1923, Johansen took a post with a Danish family who were traveling as a nanny and was encouraged by her employer's wife to train as a midwife. In 1925, Johansen traveled to Denmark and began training despite her father's skepticism that she would be successful. In 1931, Johansen passed her midwifery examination at the Rigshospitalet with the highest scores in her class, becoming he first Greenlander to be certified as a midwife. Career Returning to Greenland that same year, Johansen began working in North Greenland under the primitive conditions that existed at the time. Often serving as the bookkeeper, cook and interpreter for the hospital, in addition to her midwifery, she assisted the doctor during surgical procedures. On 23 July 1938, she married Karl Isak Kristian Victor Johansen, a trading manager, and the two moved to Ukkusissat. Continuing her work as a midwife, she began her family then, giving birth to three children: Astrid (1938), Severin (1941) and Henrik Kristian (1943). In 1946, they moved to Illorsuit, in western Greenland, where her last two children, Lars Emil (1946) and Ole (1950) were born. Despite her growing family, Johansen was active in the community as well as in her practice, often using her home for consultations and patients. She established a women's association for the village in 1956. When her husband died in 1958, Johansen returned to her home town in Uummannaq because the schools were of higher quality. The following year, she ran for election as the Uummannaq district representative to the Greenland National Council. Women had earned the right to vote in 1948, but no candidates ran in the 1951 election, which was the first time women were able to participate. Johansen, who was supported by the Greenland Workers' Association, and the fishery and prison organizations was one of the first candidates to campaign actively, taking a dogsled or a boat to speak with constituents. Her election in 1959 marked the first time a woman served, and she would be the only woman to serve on the council before it was dissolved in 1979 upon formation of the Greenland Home Rule Government. During Johansen's tenure, many issues emerged which had to do with the modernization and urbanization of the country. She took special interest in closures of village facilities and believed that relocating residents and prisoners to urban areas would create problems. She pressed the council to create schools to educate prisoners and fishermen so that they would be able to earn living wages. Johansen opposed the birthright criteria, which allowed people born in Denmark to receive higher wages for the same position than native Greenlanders earned and was the only council member to stand against the policy. In 1960, she was the recipient of the Silver Royal Medal of Recompense for her public service. Johansen was active in programs aimed at alcohol abuse and in 1969, was appointed as a member of the committee for Greenlandic Women's Relations. This committee conducted studies and published four reports about the living conditions of women in the country. In 1973, she was appointed Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog, the first woman to be awarded the distinction. Johansen retired in 1975, but continued to remain active in spite of a degenerative eye disease. In 1977, she joined the Siumut Party, a social democratic political party in Greenland. She was made an honorary citizen of Uummannaq in 1981 and was awarded the silver Medal for Meritorious Service by the Greenland Home Rule government in 1989. Death and Legacy Johansen died on 21 June 1993 in Uummannaq. She is remembered as the \\"Only Man\\" to stand against the birthright policy and as a role model for other women wishing to enter politics. Two of her children, Severin and Lars also entered politics.

Over 200 pirates surrendered to him in March 1718, including Miller. Miller had returned to piracy by 1720. Authorities in New York accused him of piracy early that year, after which he sailed to Nassau. Royal Navy Captain Edward Vernon had been stationed in the area at the time and noted that an English warship had chased Miller away, preventing him from putting into port to resupply. A few months later Vernon accused a Port Royal tavern keeper of smuggling supplies and sailors to Miller. Vernon believed that Miller was planning on joining forces with Daniel Porter and William Fox, who had also accepted the King's Pardon and returned to piracy. Porter and Fox attacked ships and plantations in the area; later Porter, along with Richard Tookerman, met with Bartholomew Roberts to ask him for advice and supplies.

TransPod vehicles are being designed to travel at over 1,000 km/h (620 mph) between cities, using fully electric propulsion to carry passengers and cargo. The proposed system would create a faster and carbon-free alternative to jets and automobiles. The TransPod pods are designed to travel through a tube guideway which is similar to a hyperloop system, with variations based on magnetic levitation rather than air bearings to promote vehicle stability. In November 2016, TransPod raised a $15 million USD seed round from Angelo Investments, an Italian high-tech holding group specializing in advanced technologies for the railway, space, and aviation industries. It has since expanded from Toronto, Canada, to open offices in Toulouse, France, and Bari, Italy. In September 2017, TransPod's inventor Ryan Janzen revealed part of the technology in a paper published in the journal Procedia Engineering. The paper was presented at the EASD EURODYN 2017 conference, and introduces basic design elements of the TransPod system. Technology The TransPod tube system is being developed to carry vehicles at speeds greater than 1000km/h. Announced in 2016, the TransPod system contains aerodynamic and propulsion systems to reduce friction compared to trains, automobiles and jets, and to carry passengers at a faster speed. TransPod's technology is designed to be compatible with renewable energies including solar generation, supplemented by regional electrical grid connection link-ups. TransPod states the purpose of this is for reduced carbon emissions. To achieve fossil-fuel-free propulsion, TransPod pods take advantage of electrically driven linear induction motor technology, with active real-time control and sense-space systems. The TransPod tube system is distinct from the hyperloop concept proposed by Elon Musk's Hyperloop Alpha white paper. Unlike hyperloop, the TransPod system uses moving electromagnetic fields to propel the vehicles with stable levitation off the bottom surface, rather than compressed air. Passenger vehicles include seating, while cargo vehicles have a loadable interior. Each vehicle includes an aircraft-like fuselage pressurized for atmospheric air circulation and control ‚Äì and includes propulsion, guidance and control systems to operate at speeds exceeding 1000km/h within a protected tube guideway. The tubes are twinned to permit bidirectional vehicle travel. The cargo transport TransPod pods are designed to carry payloads of 10‚Äì15 tons and have compatibility with wooden pallets, as well as various unit load devices such as LD3 containers, and AAA containers. The vehicle's front has an axial compressor to reduce air resistance when moving through the tube. Even in low air pressure, a small amount of air exists in the tube which would otherwise cause drag forces at high speed. This compressor diverts airflow at high speed through ducts in the vehicle out through exhaust nozzles in the back thus reducing the effect of drag on the pod. At high speed, the vehicle's dynamic forces are controlled by an internal guidance system. Deviations of the vehicle's trajectory are sensed and tracked by a combination of inertial sensors and optical sensors. TransPod's systems use sense-space processing and real-time computer vision algorithms. At the InnoTrans Rail Show 2016 in Berlin, TransPod premiered their vehicle concept, alongside implementation of Coelux technology ‚Äì an artificial skylight to emulate natural sunlight within the passenger pods. Test track in France In January 2017 TransPod announced plans for a test track to be constructed in the village of Droux near Limoges in collaboration with the French department of Haute-Vienne. The proposed test track would exceed 3km in length, and operate as a half-scale system 2m in diameter. In February 2018, Vincent Leonie, vice president of Limoges M√©tropole and a deputy mayor of Limoges, announced that agreements for the \\"Hyperloop Limoges\\" organization have been signed to promote and accelerate the technology. Organization Funding & Partnerships In November 2016, TransPod secured $15 million USD in seed funding from Angelo Investments. As part of the partnership, Angelo Investment's member companies SITAEL, MERMEC, and Blackshape Aircraft will become key industrial partners with TransPod, collaborating with the development and testing of the TransPod tube system. TransPod's Toronto office is located at the MaRS Centre, home of MaRS Discovery District. TransPod's Italian office in Bari, Italy is home to commercial and industrial partners from Angelo Investments. TransPod is working there with SITAEL, Blackshape and MERMEC for testing and development. TransPod's French office is located in Toulouse, a hub for the European aerospace industry. TransPod is additionally partnered with IKOS, an engineering firm, and REC Architecture which are also both centered in the Toulouse area. In June 2017, TransPod announced a partnership with Liebherr- Aerospace to support the research, development, and production of new cabin and vehicle thermal systems. Governance Sebastien Gendron is the CEO and co-founder of TransPod. Ryan Janzen is the CTO and co-founder of TransPod. Janzen is also a composer of orchestral music, and was the first composer to create music for the hydraulophone. Planned Transportation Routes TransPod has plans to develop routes worldwide, and is designing line configurations between international cities. For example in Canada, TransPod lines are being designed for Toronto-Montreal, Toronto-Windsor, and Toronto-Waterloo corridors in Ontario and Quebec, as well as the Calgary-Edmonton corridor in Alberta, Canada. TransPod is preparing to build a test track for the pod vehicles in Canada. This track will be extendable as part of a full route pending a combination of private and public funding to construct the line. In June 2017, the first designs were unveiled for a TransPod station, based in a future transportation hub in Downtown Toronto at the Port Lands district. In June 2017, the governments of Toronto, Ontario and Canada announced a joint funding plan of $1.185 billion to revitalize this area with new developments and infrastructure. TransPod's station design is being developed in partnership with REC Architecture. Toronto-Windsor Corridor In July 2017, TransPod released an initial cost study which outlines the viability of building a hyperloop line in Southwestern Ontario between the cities of Windsor and Toronto. The Government of Ontario announced an environmental assessment for a high-speed-rail line along this route in May 2017 for the same corridor. The study indicates a TransPod tube system would cost half the projected cost of a high-speed rail line along the same route, while operating at more than four times the top speed of high speed rail.

Early Life Abbatemarco was born in 1899 in Red Hook, Brooklyn alongside 3 other siblings, his older brother Michael \\"Mike Schatz\\" Abbatemarco (1894-1928) was also a Brooklyn gangster and close associate of Frankie Yale. His brother would be gunned down in 1928. Abbatemarco was born to Italian immigrants from Salerno and they moved to the United States around 15 years before he was born. He grew up with the Cardello brothers, who would later join the Colombo and Bonanno crime family including future captain-turned informant Michael \\"Mikey Bat\\" Cardello. As a teenager his first job was at a local lumber yard in Brooklyn and then several years later he was employed to work at Manhattan's lower west side on a teamsters firm, he also worked as a truck driver. He married Lucy Abbatemarco in 1921 and moved in together into the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn. He had a son a year after named Anthony \\"Tony Shots\\" (1922-2005), who later became the underboss of the Colombo crime family in the 1970s. Criminal Career His first prison sentence was in October 1922, which was several months after he had his first son. He was sentenced to 2 years on a conspiracy to sell morphine charge alongside 4 other criminals and served his time at the Atlanta federal prison. Abbatemarco became a soldier in the Profaci (Colombo) crime family in 1928, shortly after Yale and his brother were murdered. He was arrested on August 27, 1931, for vagrancy however he was acquitted of all charges two weeks later. Another arrest would occur in 1932 in New Jersey on suspicion charges but was subsequently released. A year later in May 1934, he was arrested on an unknown charge and only spent several days in police custody before they released him. Abbatemarco became a high level earner for his crime family and began operating several illegal gambling operations during the 1930s, including a lucrative lottery in South Brooklyn. By the 1940s Abbatemarco was elevated to the rank of caporegime (captain) and ran a crew that specialized in racketeering and burglary. He recruited teenager Carmine Persico in the early 50s; who was the imprisoned boss of the Colombo crime family from 1973 till his death in 2019. On March 25, 1952, Abbatemarco amongst his son, Joe Gallo, his brother Lawrence Gallo and 18-year old Persico were arrested by the Special Rackets Squad of the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office for racketeering related charges and the operation was alleged to have earned them $2.5 million. Abbatemarco and his son were charged with conspiracy to operate a lottery and both plead guilty, however 7 of the other accused did not. He received a year in prison at Riker's Island Penitentiary. Death On November 4, 1959, Abbatemarco was gunned down by assassins as he left a tavern owned by his cousins, the Cardello brothers. Abbatemarco and his crew stopped paying tribute to boss Joe Profaci and it was his downfall. He claimed he was in debt although he owned two homes in New Jersey and Florida, and donated extravagantly to catholic causes. The Gallo brothers have been suspected of killing him as they were allegedly promised rackets by Profaci however he gave them to his own relatives. Abbatemarco's murder would start the first Colombo war. He is buried at the Holy Cross Cemetery in Brooklyn. His son Anthony went into hiding for 2 years and sought revenge. He assisted Profaci in killing Lawrence Gallo however he mistakenly shot a police officer and was charged with attempted murder. A month after his cousin Joseph Magnasco would be murdered. During the war Abbatemarco somewhat helped the Gallo brothers and changed sides several times in order to stay alive. The war ended after Joe Gallo was assassinated in 1971. Anthony Abbatemarco would later serve as underboss from 1973 to 1977.

Plot The film begins with a man killing his pregnant wife in their penthouse apartment in Farhope Tower after learning she had cheated on him, and there was a chance the baby was not his. The man then calmly puts a record on before hanging himself. Decades later, five amateur paranormal investigators ‚Äì Jake, Andre, Zoe, Judy, and Simon ‚Äì are struggling to get their own television series. They learn that a producer is interested in their show, but demands they film a pilot episode at Farhope Tower, which is infamous due to the high number of suicides and murders committed there. While Jake, Judy, and Simon are enthusiastic about the opportunity, Andre is worried, as Farhope Tower was the first place he and Jake encountered the paranormal as children, and they had sworn never to go back. Jake convinces Andre that everything will be fine. That night, Jake has a nightmare in which he is wandering Farhope Tower before an unseen person grabs him by the neck. The group go to the tower and find it abandoned and in disrepair. Simon finds a room with the message \\"Go Up\\" written all over the walls, then later finds several newspaper clippings regarding the incidents in the tower, including the murder from the opening scene, which also reveals that the pregnant woman's baby survived. The group deduce that, since all the suicides happened in the top floors of the building, that is where they will find indications of spirits. They discover a staircase and make their way to the tenth floor as night falls. Jake suggests the group split up, despite Andre's protests. Jake and Simon proceed alone and find an office, where Simon finds and reads a suicide note; as he reads it, Jake begins experiencing a severe headache. Simon then asks Jake if he and Zoe are a couple. Jake becomes suddenly angry and attacks Simon before immediately returning to normal. A panicked Simon demands they leave the tower, but Jake begins screaming at him again. Meanwhile, Zoe, Judy, and Andre hear music and find an unplugged radio that somehow works. Zoe makes contact with a spirit, but when she begins asking questions, extremely loud screams fill the room and destroy their equipment and cellphones. Jake awakens alone with his head bleeding and Simon missing. He meets up with the others. Zoe and Andre want to leave, but Judy refuses to abandon their chance at fame and Jake agrees. They begin searching for Simon, only to discover that the tower seems to be changing, with doors and staircases vanishing, leaving them with no way to get down. Andre angrily confronts Jake, revealing that when they came to Farhope Tower as kids, Jake was possessed by a spirit and nearly killed Andre. Jake refuses to leave without Simon, but begins hearing voices telling him to \\"go up\\". Zoe enters a room and begins screaming ‚Äì the others find her with her leg snapped, and she says the room had no floor and she was falling. Zoe reveals she is pregnant with Jake's baby. Jake sees Simon at the end of the hall and the group attempt to follow; Andre becomes separated from the others and is possessed by a spirit who forces him to disembowel himself. The group find him as he dies. They try to find a way to get out of the tower, but Zoe is suddenly possessed and begins flailing and moaning before suddenly miscarrying the baby. She returns to normal and breaks down sobbing, and Jake tries to comfort her while a horrified Judy runs away. Judy discovers Simon's GoPro camera on the floor and watches the footage, which reveals that Jake murdered Simon while being possessed by a spirit. Jake finds her and becomes possessed again, and he chases Judy through the hallway. Judy escapes, and a woman's voice tells Jake to \\"go up\\". Jake returns to Zoe and convinces her that going up is the only way to get out of the tower. Judy reaches the roof of the tower, where a ghost possesses her and forces her to stab herself in the throat. Simon and Zoe make their way to the penthouse. Zoe finds a photograph of the man and his wife from the opening scene, and realizes that Jake is the baby that survived and was given away ‚Äì the spirits of Jake's mother and his mother's killer had been luring him there ever since Jake entered the tower as a child. Jake, possessed by the man's spirit, brutally beats Zoe to death. Jake then calmly gets a chair and a rope and hangs himself, mirroring the deaths of his mother and father.

Vinsant Shea (February 20, 1917 - April 14, 1945) was an American flight nurse who served during World War II. She died in an aircraft crash and was later memorialized for her courage and sacrifice. She was the only servicewoman from Texas to die on active duty in Europe during World War II.  Biography  Vinsant was born in San Benito, was an only child and her mother was formerly a nurse while her father was a veteran of World War I. She was five feet tall and weighed around a hundred pounds. Vinsant attended and graduated from San Benito High School. Around 1934, she attended Brownsville Junior College. She received her nursing certificate from John Sealy Hospital. She began acting as a flight nurse for crews on Braniff Airways. On September 1, 1942, she enlisted as lieutenant in the Nurses Corps, training at Camp Swift. During the holidays of 1943, she took leave and visited her parents at home. She qualified for the Air Evacuation Nurse Corps and graduated with the first flight nurse class at Bowman Field, Kentucky. After graduation, she was stationed in England with the 806th Medical Air Evacuation Squadron and worked in combat situations for the next two years. She was also involved in transporting wounded and injured soldiers back to the United States in the Air Evacuation Service. Early in 1945, she married Walter Shea, an army operations officer, in England. Vinsant completed her hazardous flight quota and asked \\"to make one more trip.\\" On April 14, 1945, she died in action over Germany. The C-47 Dakota she was flying in crashed near Eschwege. Vinsant was the only woman from Texas and one of seventeen flight nurses to die on active duty in Europe during the war. After her death, she received a personal citation and a Purple Heart decoration from President Harry S. Truman. She had also earned the Air Medal and a Red Cross Medal. She was buried in the Netherlands American Cemetery in Margraten.  Legacy  In 1949, an eighty-one-bed hospital, named Dolly Vinsant Memorial Hospital, opened in San Benito. The hospital named after her was closed on October 2007. Later Southwest Key ran a shelter for undocumented immigrant children in the former hospital. The life- size portrait of Vinsant that once hung in the hospital is still missing. An organization named after her, the Dolly Vinsant Memorial Foundation, provides scholarships for local students who are interested in entering the medical field. An annual award, the Wilma \\"Dolly\\" Vinsant Flight Nurse of the Year award is given out by the Commemorative Air Force (CAF). Recipients of the award \\"put patient care above self\\" and must be involved in in-flight evacuations and healthcare missions.

It is the cause of red rot disease' or red wasting disease, also called ''''' () in Japanese. The specific epithet porphyrae () stems from the genus of one of its common hosts, Porphyra, and the purple-red color of the lesions on the thallus of the host. However, many of its hosts have been moved from the genus Porphyra to Pyropia. Economic impact P. porphyrae can destroy an entire crop of nori within 3 weeks.ARASAKI, S. (1962).

[In Japanese, English summary.] Bulletin of the Tohoku Regional Fisheries Research Laboratory (33), I 19-27. It will only grow in the 15-35 ¬∞C range. Mild winters correlate with higher infestations and lower crop yields, possibly due to decreased temperatures inducing the development of sex organs in the oomycete. Losses can be combated by destroying diseased fronds and exposing thalli to the air for 3‚Äì4 hours daily. The oospores can be spread in contaminated organic matter and the sporangia can spread through the water. Description P. porphyrae has a mycelial thallus that is eucarpic, meaning only part of the thallus turns into sporangia. It is primarily a facultative parasite of algae, but can also be saprobic. Its hyphae can grow up to 4.5 ¬µm wide, and are not septate. On algae, the hyphae will extend through the cell wall. It does not have haustoria not chlamydospores. The appressoria are club-shaped. It has sporangia that are unbranched, filamentous, and non-inflated, typically forming 6-17 zoospores per vesicle. Encysted zoospores are 8-12 ¬µm in diameter. Hyphal swellings are intercalary and globose, from 12-28 ¬µm in diameter. Oogonia average 17 ¬µm in diameter and are also intercalary and globose, but rarely are terminal. In each oogonium are 1-2 diclinous antheridia coming out far away from the oogonial stalk. The antheridia's cells are clavate (club shaped) or globose. The antheridia will be apical to the oogonial wall. Sometimes there will be two antheridial cells on one stalk. The yellowish oospores average 15 ¬µm in diameter, have thick (~2 ¬µm) walls, and are plerotic (fill the whole oogonium). Conidia are spherical at 8.8-30.8 Œºm diameter, but rarely produced. P. porphyrae shares many physical traits with P. marinum and P. monospermum, and appears to be most closely related to P. adhaerens. However it has up to four diclinous antheridia and sometimes two antheridial cells per stalk; P. monospermum has 1-4 either diclinous or monoclinous antheridia and P. marinum has only a single diclinous antheridium. P. monospermum and P. marinum also have oogonia terminally on short branches, yet in P. porphyrae they tent to be intercalary. In a laboratory it will grow 5 mm per day on seawater-cornmeal agar with low aerial mycelium and colorless colonies, but will not grow at all on potato-carrot agar. Ecology P. porphyrae has been found in Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, and Korea, but this range is likely underreported. It has a parasitic relationship with the following hosts. Though some species of Pyropia and Porphyra are susceptible to infection in their gametophytic phase, they are resistant in their Conchocelis (sporophytic) phase. *Bangia atropurpurea *Callophyllis adhaerens *Chondrus crispus *Gelidium elegans *Gloiosiphonia capillaris *Gracilaria spp. *Grateloupia turuturu *Griffithsia subcylindrica *Lomentaria hakodatensis *Mastocarpus papillatus *Polyopes affinis (Carpopeltis affinis) *Polysiphonia morrowii *Pterocladiella capillacea *Pyropia cinnamomea *Pyropia plicata *Pyropia suborbiculata *Pyropia tenera *Pyropia virididentata *Pyropia yezoensis *Rhodymenia intricata *Stylonema alsidii *Wrangelia tanegana Taxonomy A 2005 study concerning a case of Pythiosis from a related species (P. insidiosum) indicated that P. porphyrae is related to P. dissotocum, P. myriotylum, P. volutum, and P. vanterpoolii. In 2004, molecular analysis of Pythium determined that P. porphyrae is in \\"Clade A\\" along with P. adhaerens, P. deliense, P. aphanidermatum, and P. monospermum Clade A has two clusters, and P. porphyrae shares one with the species also originating on algae, P. adhaerens. A 2017 study of Pythium species in Clade A showed the following phylogenetic tree. It further demonstrated that P. porphyrae and P. chondricola are the same species. P. adhaerens may also be conspecific based solely on genetic comparison, but showed a number of physical differences that show it may be a separate but very closely related species.

F√ºrst zu F√ºrstenberg; 28 October 179622 October 1854) was a German politician and nobleman. From 1804 to 1806 he was the last sovereign prince of Furstenburg before its mediatisation, whilst still in his minority. He also served as the first-ever vice-president of the Upper Chamber of the Badische St√§ndeversammlung.  Life  Minority He was born in Prague, the only son of the Austrian general Karl Aloys zu F√ºrstenberg and his wife princess Elisabeth von Thurn und Taxis. Soon after his father's death on 25 March 1799 his cousin Charles Gabriel also died aged only fourteen (13 December 1799) - Charles Gabriel had been the last scion of the Bohemian F√ºrstenberg-P√ºrglitz line and this left the branch extinct. His uncle Karl Joachim, the last male survivor of the Swabian line, died in 1804, leaving that too extinct. This meant that in 1804 Charles Egon inherited almost all the F√ºrstenberg possessions except those of the Moravian line, which still had surviving issue. Charles was only seven years old when he succeeded, so his mother and Landgraf Joachim Egon von F√ºrstenberg, a distant uncle from the Moravian line, became his guardians and regents, though most of the actual governing was done by Joseph von La√überg.

In 1806 the princedom of F√ºrstenberg was abolished by the Treaty of the Confederation of the Rhine. Elisabeth and La√überg tried in vain to get this reversed at the 1814 Congress of Vienna. He studied at Freiburg and W√ºrzburg. In 1815 he accompanied Prince Schwarzenberg to Paris as staff-officer.

On 19 April 1818 he married Amalie of Baden, a daughter of Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden and his second wife Louise Caroline, Countess von Hochberg. Since her mother was a morganatic wife, so too was Amalie - although Charles, Grand Duke of Baden later elevated her to dynastic status (she was his father's half- sister), making her the first \\"princess\\" of Baden, which allowed Charles Egon's mother to finally accept the couple as a marriage of equals. Karoline von Freystedt: Erinnerungen aus dem Hofleben, Heidelberg 1902, S. 146/147. Political life Charles's status entitled him to sit in the , of which chamber he became the first vice-president, holding that office for thirty- three years from 1819 to 1852, whilst its president was Prince William of Baden. Karl Stiefel: Baden 1648‚Äì1952, Band 1, S. 258 His estates also meant he sat in the Upper Chamber of the Estates of W√ºrttemberg (whose vice-presidency he also held several times) from 1819 and in the Prussian House of Lords from 1850. History records him as a relatively progressive and unbiased for his time. Karl Stiefel: Baden 1648‚Äì1952, Band 1, S. 258. For example, during the full sitting of the German Confederation's landtag in 1831, he played a significant part in getting the upper chamber to approve the Liberal Press Act, put forward by the government under pressure from the lower chamber. \\"....

This removed censorship, at least for home affairs in Baden. He was also influential in the abolition of tithes and fedual duties. In 1836 he was made a knight of the Austrian Order of the Golden Fleece and on 18 January 1851 he was made a knight of the Order of the Black Eagle, the highest order in the Kingdom of Prussia.

Charitable work Charles was also distinguished by his large charities; among other foundations he established a hospital at Donaueschingen. For the industrial development of the country, too, he did much, and proved himself also a notable patron of the arts. His palace of Donaueschingen, with its collections of paintings, engravings and coins, was a centre of culture, where poets, painters and musicians met with princely entertainment.

He is remembered for his heroism following the Snaefell Mine Disaster of 1897, during which he displayed extraordinary courage and endurance and for which he received the Medal of the Honourable Order of the Knights of St John of Jerusalem. Biography John Kewley was born on the Isle of Man in 1832 and following his education he became a mine engineer. He took employment with the Great Snaefell Mining Company progressing to become manager of the mine, referred to as the Mine Captain.Mona's Herald, Wednesday, May 12, 1897; Page: 5 Snaefell Mine Disaster By 1897 the Snaefell mine had become increasingly difficult to work as a consequence of insufficient ventilation (the lowest depth of the mine shaft by this time being at 171 fathoms (). This ongoing problem had become increasingly acute as the various levels were driven further from the main shaft. During early May 1897, dynamite had been used to enable the extension of the workings in the lowest part in order for the working levels to be extended and an inspection of the mine had been undertaken by the Government Inspector, along with the Mine Captain on Friday 7 May, the purpose of which was to ensure there was sufficient ventilation, with their findings being satisfactory.Peel City Guardian, Saturday, May 15, 1897; Page: 4 Miners had finished their shift on Saturday 8 May, and the mine was closed the following day, Sunday 9 May. Due to inadequate safety measures a stray candle had been allowed to continue burning which in turn set fire to a nearby pit prop consequently starting a fire in the shaft. The fire would have continued burning so long as oxygen was present, the process forming carbon monoxide which filled the lower parts of the shaft. On Monday 10 May at 06:00hrs, 40 miners reported for the early shift, 34 of whom were required for the shift, and began descending into the mine using the ladders which were lashed against the side of the shaft. As the miners descended into the lower parts of the shaft they encountered the poisonous fumes which resulted in immediate breathing difficulties. At once the miners began to vacate the shaft, those at the top were able to make their way out without too much difficulty, however others arrived at the surface in a state of near collapse and it soon became apparent that a large number of the miners who'd made the descent were unable to return. Despite being 65 years of age at the time, Capt. Kewley immediately organised and personally led the rescue mission, and with complete disregard for his own safety descended the mine shaft in order to render aid to any who might be living and to recover the bodies of the dead miners. The Mine Captain's House, the residence of John Kewley at the Great Snaefell Mine On Saturday 15 May, Capt. Kewley and some other miners re-entered the mine in order to retrieve the body of Robert Kelly which was situated at the 130 fathom level, and where the presence of gas had made recovery impossible. As they descended the party became overpowered by gas which resulted in Capt. Kewley having to be placed in the kibble in order for him to be hauled to the surface. Unfortunately the kibble jammed in the shaft, and it took in excess of an hour before Capt. Kewley, in a state of semi-consciousness, could be brought to the surface. Medal of the Order of St John of Jerusalem At a meeting of the general committee of the Snaefell Mine Disaster Fund, presided over by the Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man, John Henniker-Major, 5th Baron Henniker was held on Monday 13 September 1897, at which it was announced that the Lieutenant Governor had been successful in obtaining for Captain John Kewley and Mr G. Williams under the Metalliferous Mines Regulation Act for the Inspection of Mines in the Isle of Man, the Medal of the Honourable Order of the Knight of St John of Jerusalem. The medal was rewarded for the self-sacrificing exertion and distinguished bravery displayed under the most trying and hazardous circumstances in their heroic efforts to save life and succour the helpless in connection with the disaster. Governor Henniker was a Knight of Justice of the Honourable Order and as such he had been requested to make the presentation on behalf of the Prince of Wales. The presentation took place at the Working Men's Institute, Laxey, on Saturday 25 September.Manx Sun. Saturday, September 18, 1897; Page: 5 Death It is said that Capt. Kewley never fully recovered from his exertions during the rescue and recovery of the miners in connection to the disaster. John Kewley passed away at the Snaefell Mine on 2 February 1905. He was 73 years of age.Manx Sun. Saturday, September 18, 1897; Page: 5 Funeral Captain Kewley's funeral took place on Monday 6 February 1905.

The Sicherheitspolizei, or security police, was a paramilitary German police group set up in most states of the Weimar Republic at the end of 1919 and largely financed by the central government. In its anti-riot role it can be seen as roughly analogous to the Bereitschaftspolizei in today's Federal Republic. In view of the unstable internal political situation in the Weimar Republic, especially in the imperial capital of Berlin, Hauptmann Waldemar Pabst of the Imperial Cavalry Guards Corps considered a barracked and militarily armed and trained police group necessary to control political violence. It was intended to be a more useful tool in the fight against insurrection than the existing police forces taken from the monarchy. After street extensive general strikes and street violence in March 1919, Pabst sent a corresponding concept to the Reichswehr Minister Gustav Noske during the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì19. Noske approved the plan and promoted its formation together with Wolfgang Heine. According to Noske's wishes, the police group thus constituted the nucleus of the new Reichswehr. In September 1919, 2,500 local and municipal police officers protested against the construction of the new national police service. In contrast to local police, who usually wore blue uniforms, the Sipo were called the \\"green police\\" after their uniform color.  Conversion and Reorganization  In response to protest from the French government in 1920, the national level security police units were dissolved were either sent to perform local policing. France feared a clandestine rearmament and saw the new para-military police force as a threat to its security. The planned airborne component of some security police had to be abandoned and their use of artillery and tanks were prohibited. France demanded the abolition of the green uniform, which they viewed as camouflage clothing. A blue uniform was introduced in most regions. Only Bavaria, Wurttemberg, Mecklenburg, and Bremen retained uniform components of a dark green color. The pants were mostly black or black-blue. Particularly striking was the Saxon version with a fairly light medium blue color. However, it took some years before the uniforming was completed, since the uniforms already purchased had to be used up before new ones could be requisitioned. Steel helmets were generally abolished and were not reissued until around 1930. The terms \\"Sipo\\" and \\"green police\\" continued in popular usage until the Nazi reorganization and disbandment of local police forces in 1935.  Strength, training, and equipment  Police cadets at an Academy in Brandenburg an der Havel practice marching insurgents. The training of the security police was tailored to a para-militarily force. The standard service period, analogous to the Reichswehr, was 12 years. The transfer to the local police or gendarmerie was by no means guaranteed, although in general a takeover was planned for the administrative service. With the global economic crisis of 1929, this could no longer be realized, as all countries had to save on personnel costs. Equipment and armament was entirely designed for combat against heavily armed insurgents. Depending on the size of the member state, the security police had a number of so-called special cars, mostly British Daimler DZVR 21s or German Ehrhardt 21s, which were usually equipped with two turrets with one machine gun each. Machine guns, carbines, and grenades were also issued. The entire training, equipment and armament aimed at a civil war- like use both in large cities and in the countryside. The security police were deployed extensively, combating the KPD's organized strikes and riots, including the Ruhr Uprising in the aftermath of the Kapp-Putsch in April 1920, the Mitteldeutscher Aufstand (\\"March Action\\") in March and April 1921, and the Hamburger Aufstand in October 1923, which were initiated in part by the KPD. From 1929 up to the ascension of the Nazi Party to power, the police were almost continuously engaged in operations protecting or dispersing demonstrations and political events.  Evolution after 1933  The Nazi concept of the role of the police originally called for only a very small force. Like the Communists, the National Socialists saw a kind of praetorian guardianship of the mainstream democratic parties, especially the SPD in Prussia, which continuously constituted the government there from 1919 to 1932. Moreover, on 9 November 1923, the Hitler's putsch was defeated in Munich by the intervention of the Bavarian state police . As early as 1933, the transformation of the remaining local police into the national state police had begun. From August 1934 until the end of 1935 these were dissolved and its members transferred to the Wehrmacht. Gallery  References   Bibliography  Lothar Danner: Ordnungspolizei Hamburg.

The game is about the titular character, D√©sir√©, an achromatic boy who only sees black and white, and the player guides him in 4 various parts of his life. The game contains themes such as sexuality, bullying, pedophilia, zoophilia, suicide, depression, morality, feminism, BDSM and criticism of aspects of modern society such as capitalism and materialism. Plot The game begins with a cutscene of a young D√©sir√© who is asked by his kindergarten teacher why he hasn't drawn the sun like the other children; he replies that he has never seen the sun, since it \\"is always night in his head\\". The game continues on a beach in 1992, where a young D√©sir√© wants to cast a \\"love spell\\" on a classmate he has a crush on. The player directs D√©sir√© in all his actions, such as picking up objects, talking to various characters, and exploring the world. After successfully burying a box with an egg, which has the name of D√©sir√©'s crush on it, the game continues to the next chapter. D√©sir√©, who lives in the suburbs of Lyon with his parents and brother Bruno, is advised by an old man (who is apparently imaginary, as other characters imply) to stand up against a boy named David who bullies him at school. D√©sir√© plots to catch David in the act of masturbating and distribute pictures of it around the school. After successfully doing this, David and D√©sir√© are both expelled from school. The next chapter starts in 2003. D√©sir√©, now an adult man living in Paris, is informed that his company is firing him because they are outsourcing part of its operations. D√©sir√© is in love with Elma, who doesn't seem to return the feeling, and he promises her a gig at a restaurant in an attempt to woo her. After successfully doing this, Elma doesn't show up at the day of the gig, and a heartbroken D√©sir√© comes to believe that it is better not to love. In 2011, D√©sir√© has discarded love and instead visits brothels to satisfy his desires. The chapter begins with a dream or hallucination of D√©sir√© standing before a brothel which appears as a giant woman's genital area. D√©sir√© also visits √âlodie, one of his friends, who is in love with her dog Rocco. He decides to visit another friend, Damien, and recruits the help of Andy, another friend, to find Damien after discovering threatening letters from Damien's neighbour. Eventually, it is discovered that Damien committed suicide; it is also revealed Damien was a pedophile but never acted on it. The chapter ends with D√©sir√© talking to a hallucination of an obese man who tries to convince him to stop changing society, however corrupt it might be, and just accept everything. The final chapter starts in 2020. D√©sir√© has been living a village in Congo for 2 years, but wants to return to France and find the manuscript which an old sailor gave him when he was a child. His parents gave the manuscript to a charity, and D√©sir√© returns to Lyon in search of it. A clue in a secondhand shop gives him a lead, but the shop salesman, who is revealed to be David, confronts D√©sir√©, who is forced to beat him up. D√©sir√© traces the manuscript to a small village. He finds a young girl, L√©a, alone on the streets and reveals her grandfather is Martin Lacour, an antique collector who currently owns the manuscript. D√©sir√© accompanies L√©a back home, and Lacour reluctantly allows D√©sir√© to read the manuscript. After realizing it is the real one, he steals it from Lacour's safe and reads it in the local church. D√©sir√© is now able to see colors, and is ecstatic, but can't bring himself to steal it and decides to return it to L√©a, who thanks him. The chapters ends with D√©sir√© hallucinating an apparition of Jesus, who claims D√©sir√© is afraid of change and gave the manuscript away for that reason. The game ends with D√©sir√© finally accepting the world as it ends, yet feeling condemned to live while pursuing his path. Reception Reception to the game on Steam was mixed. The French gaming website Joypad gave it a positive review. The game was notable enough to receive coverage on a TV report of La Une. The game won Best Mobile Game and Best Game Audio at the Tel Aviv Indie Game Awards 2016, and Best Game Narrative in the Asia Indie Game Awards 2016.

Background  Founded in 1993 in honor of its eponym, Albert B. Sabin, creator of the oral polio vaccine, Sabin works to reduce \\"human suffering from vaccine-preventable and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs).\\" The organization endeavors to reach its goal via its three main programs: Sabin Vaccine Development, the Global Network for Neglected Tropical Diseases, and Vaccine Advocacy and Education. Through its Product Development Partnership (PDP), Sabin has worked with organizations such as King Saud University, Texas Children's Hospital Center, International Vaccine Institute, and George Washington University School of Medicine & Health Sciences toward its goals, with funding and support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Brazilian Ministry of Health and other benefactors.  Vaccine development and research In 2012, Sabin partnered with International Vaccine Institute to combine their research, development, and promotion efforts in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Sabin is currently working on multiple vaccines for humans including vaccines for Hookworm infection (Na- GST-1, Na-APR-1), Schistosomiasis (Sm-TSP-2), Chagas disease (Tc24, TSA-1), Leishmaniasis (Ld-NH36, PdSP15), Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)/Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (Pan-Œ≤-CoVax), Soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH), and Onchocerciasis (Ov-103, Ov-RAL-2).  Neglected tropical diseases  In 2006, Sabin co-founded the Global Network for Neglected Tropical Diseases in order \\"to raise the awareness, political will and funding necessary to control and eliminate the most common NTDs.\\" Through its work on NTDs, Sabin hopes to reduce poverty caused by these diseases as many of them have been shown to adversely affect \\"childhood cognitive development among the poor, thereby reinforcing poverty.\\"  Advocacy and education  Sabin works with experts and organizations from around the world to advance knowledge of both infectious diseases and the vaccines that can prevent them. Through the International Association of Immunization Managers (IAIM) Network, Sabin arranges international forums to improve the success rates of immunization programs. Sabin serves as the Secretariat for the Coalition against Typhoid whose mission is to raise awareness of Typhoid and Salmonellosis.

Between November 1932 and February/March 1933 she sat as a member of the national parliament (Reichstag), representing Electoral District 12 (Th√ºringia).  Life  Maria Holl was born at Schwabm√ºnchen, a small town in the hills south of Augsburg. Slightly unusually for the time, according to her later entry in the official handbook of Reichgstag members, the family were not members of the church. They worked from home, making brooms and brushes. She attended school locally and then took a series of jobs locally, including work as an embroidery trainer and as a maid-servant on a farm. Next she moved to Munich where she took a job as a sales assistant. It was in Berlin that she got to know Jakob Blum, an active member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) whom she subsequently married. They moved to Berlin in 1912. The First World War broke out in July 1914. From the outset Maria Blum was an anti-war activist. She was conscripted to work at a munitions factory in Berlin's Spandau quarter. In August 1917 the couple relocated to Bad Kreuznach which was Jakob Blum's home town. Maria Blum had herself been a member of the SPD since before the war. She was one of many party members deeply critical of the decision by the party leadership to implement what amounted to a parliamentary truce over funding for the war. In 1917 the party finally split over the issue of support for the war. Maria Blum moved across to the newly launched break-away Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD). During the series of revolutions that erupted during 1918/1919 she was one of the senior USPD officers. She became involved in smuggling across to Luxembourg revolutionary activists who had found themselves sought by the police, and in August 1920 she herself moved to Luxembourg. During the final months of 1920 she was involved in setting up the Communist Party of Luxembourg, which led to the loss of her residence permit in 1921. She returned to Germany where, following a political reconfiguration on the political left, the USPD had been subsumed into the recently launched Communist Party of Germany (KPD), which she joined. Settling in Cologne she became a member of the KPD Central Rhine Women's Section. During 1923 she was sent to study at the Party Academy in Jena. From 1925, still at this stage based in Cologne, she was employed as an editor in the party's large press section. In 1926 she became a member of the party's Trotskyite Leftwing Opposition movement, although she would remain a member of the mainstream Communist Party through the fragmentation of the later 1920s. Between 1927 and 1929 she worked on the Arbeiterzeitung ('Workers' Newspaper') in Aachen. From 1928 that was combined with an editorial position on the Th√ºringer Volkszeitung ('Th√ºringian People's Newspaper') published at this stage in Jena, though shortly afterwards the operation moved to nearby Erfurt. In 1928 the criminal court in Leipzig sentenced her to an eighteen month jail term. The charge was the familiar one for political activists in Germany of 'preparing to commit high treason', although sources are silent as to the details of what it was she was deemed by the court to have done. In the general election of September 1930 there was a turnout of 82%, indicating that many voters who had stayed away from previous elections now came out to register a vote. The mainstream parties lost vote share, whilst the National Socialist German Workers Party ('Nazi Party') and, to a lesser extent, the Communist Party made gains in terms both of vote share and of the number of seats in the resulting Reichstag. Maria Blum was elected to the Reichstag as a Communist Party member, representing Electoral District 12 (Th√ºringia). Sources are not wholly consistent on the dates of Maria Blum's imprisonment: one source refers to her having been imprisoned on 8 July 1930, incarcerated at Preungesheim on the edge of Frankfurt. She was, however, let out in order to attend parliamentary sittings in Berlin. Around this time, desperate to try and defuse the political temperature, the government implemented a major amnesty for political prisoners, during the course of which, late in 1930 or early in 1931, Maria Blum was released. She moved to Berlin where she joined the National Women's Department of the Party Central Committee. Political and economic conditions continued to deteriorate, and 1932 was a year of two general elections. The principal gainers in the general election of July 1932 were again Nazi Party candidates, who saw the Nazi vote share reaching its all-time high point (for a democratically structured general election) at 37%. The Communist vote share increased marginally, to 13% but Maria Blum was not elected. Later that year the November general election saw further small gains for the Communists, while the Nazi vote share fell back to 33%. Maria Blum returned to the Reichstag, now representing the Merseburg electoral district. The result of the November 1932 election left the Nazis and the Communists together holding 296 Reichstag seats, which was more than 50% of the seat total of 584. The more moderate parties, even if they had been able to form a coalition between themselves, could not have commanded a parliamentary majority without co-operation from one or other of the extreme parties. Despite the parliamentary stalemate, following deft political machinations the Nazis, with the conditional agreement of President Hindenburg, took power in January 1933 and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Following the Reichstag fire at the end of February 1933, which was blamed on \\"communists\\" with implausible haste, the authorities were particularly ferocious in attacking communist activists. Maria Blum continued her (now illegal) political work till June 1933 at which point she was arrested. She suffered serious abuse, but by the end of that year she had been released: she emigrated to Moscow.G√ºnter Bers: \\"Rote Tage\\" im Rheinland, 1980, p. 39. In Moscow, between 1934 and 1936, using the party name \\"Maria Herbst\\", she studied at the so-called 'West University'. In 1937 she started teaching at evening classes for exiled German workers, and from 1938 she was working in an \\"Emigrant Home\\". In June 1941 the Berlin government turned its back on the non-aggression pact with Moscow and launched a massive land invasion of the Soviet Union. Several thousand German political refugees who had been living in Moscow were unceremoniously sent into internal exile. Maria Blum was exiled to Tomsk in Western Siberia. She was able to return to Germany only in August 1947. A large part of central Germany was administered, after May 1945, as the Soviet occupation zone. It would be relaunched in October 1949 as the German Democratic Republic. It was here, still using her Soviet party name, Maria Herbst, that she settled. She lost no time in joining the recently launched Socialist Unity Party (SED), by now well on its way to becoming the ruling party in East Germany. She spent several months as a patient in a sanatorium and then, in January 1948, took a job with the newly converted party academy near Schwerin at Castle Wiligrad. Between 1954 and 1958 she was employed at the party's Marxism-Leninism Institute in Berlin, where she was entrusted with care of the important literary estate of Ernst Th√§lmann. Maria Blum (Herbst) died on 11 May 1965 in East Berlin.

Biography Grachev was born on 18 July 1935 in Saint Petersburg into a single-parent family headed by his mother. Having lost her during the Siege of Leningrad, Rid spent eight years in an orphanage, the period he later described in his works numerous times. After graduating from the Leningrad State University in 1959, Grachev, a fluent French speaker, was involved in translating Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry for Soviet readers, as well as writing a number of articles and essays on French literature. Later on, he started writing his own stories and soon became one of the most influential \\"young authors\\" in Leningrad, along with Andrei Bitov, Alexander Kushner and many others. Even though his short stories were denied publication again and again due to censorship, he gained fame as part of the \\"New Petersburg Prose\\" movement, with his fiction and essays being distributed by the Samizdat. His only published book was a set of short stories entitled ¬´–ì–¥–µ —Ç–≤–æ–π –¥–æ–º?¬ª (Where's Your Home?). Unsurprisingly, the book, containing six short stories, was cut by the censors. He was never published again during the Soviet times, with two books of his previously unreleased works seeing the light of day in 1994 and 2014. Mental illness and death Starting from 1965, Grachev began to suffer from schizophrenia, possibly triggered by an incident when he was involved in a street brawl being drunk and got severely beaten up; also, his grandfather was reported to have a mental disease of his own, which Rid could have inherited.–†–∏–¥ –ì—Ä–∞—á—ë–≤: –ü—Ä–æ–∫–ª—è—Ç—ã–π –ü—Ä–æ–∑–∞–∏–∫ –®–µ—Å—Ç–∏–¥–µ—Å—è—Ç—ã—Ö A reference to Grachev's illness was made by Sergey Dovlatov in his 1979 novel The Invisible Book. There, Dovlatov tells a story of how he collected donations for Reed, who was ¬´undergoing treatment¬ª, from the Leningrad authors and journalists. In the end of the story, he sadly admits Grachev to be ¬´hopelessly insane¬ª. In 1994, Grachev had to have one of his legs amputated when a gangrene set in it. Even tied to a wheelchair, Grachev, with the help of Elisabeth Markstein, an Austrian translator, published his second book, entitled ¬´–ù–∏—á–µ–π –±—Ä–∞—Ç¬ª (Nobody's Brother), ready for publishing. This book included all of his works known by that time. Reed Grachev died on 1 November 2004 in his home in St. Petersburg in misery and totally mentally disabled. Legacy In 1967, Joseph Brodsky, a close friend of Grachev's, wrote a metaphorical ¬´protection document¬ª for him, calling him ¬´the greatest homme de lettres of today¬ª. In 2013, the Zvezda magazine, edited by Yakov Gordin, another Petersburg author and Grachev's friend, published an anthology of his works in two volumes. This led to Reed Grachev's prose being discussed again in the present day.

Albania is located in Southern and Southeastern Europe in the western section of the Balkan Peninsula. It borders on Montenegro to the northwest, Kosovo to the northeast, North Macedonia to the east, Greece to the south and the Mediterranean Sea to the west. The coastline occupies a total length of and explicitly marked by a mountainous landscape supplied with deep bays, numerous islands, high cliffs, rocky and sandy coasts and a unique marine life. The Ionian Sea is an arm of the Mediterranean Sea positioned south of the Adriatic Sea, which extend from Sicily up to the Strait of Otranto between Salento and Bay of Vlor√´. It is surrounded by Italy in the west, Greece and Albania in the east. Though considered by ancient authors to be part of the Adriatic Sea, the Ionian Sea is at present seen as a separate body of water. Traditionally, the region represents the most valuable tourist resource for the country, especially due to the unspoilt natural and cultural beauty expressed in the region's architecture, cuisine and tradition. Its most considerable attraction is the ancient city of Butrint, that is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, because it provides valuable remains of ancient civilizations. The region is populated by more than 50.000 people with the largest city being the seaport city of Sarand√´, one of the most appreciated tourist destinations in the Ionian Sea. Sarand√´ is served by Port of Sarand√´, one of the largest of the country, which has become a notable sailing and cruise port. The region is very scenic, with wild coastlines, mountains and a very substantial proportion of native forest. Some of the most prominent beaches along the coastline are Dh√´rmi, Himara, Qeparo, Borsh, Lukov√´, Vuno and Ksamil. The Albanian Ionian Sea Coast is known for its diverse landscapes, unique traditions, and its influence on Albanian culture. It is regarded as the birthplace of the Albanian iso-polyphony which was recognised as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.  Environment   Geography  Ksamil in the south of the coastline. The country of Albania is located in the southwest of the Balkan Peninsula and bordered by Montenegro to the northwest, Kosovo to the northeast, the North Macedonia to the east, and Greece to the south and southeast. Most of the country is rugged and mountainous with the Albanian Alps located in the north, the Korab Mountains in the east, the Ceraunian Mountains in the south and the Skanderbeg Mountains in the center. Being positioned in the Northern Mediterranean Sea, the country's coast touches both, the Adriatic Sea and Ionian Sea, forming the renowned Albanian Riviera. In contrast to the mountainous terrain of the country, the western lowlands consists mostly of coastal lowlands and plains. The Albanian Ionian Sea Coast is known for its rugged natural beauty, with rocky highlands and a great marine life, while the Albanian Adriatic Sea Coast consist of sandy beaches and shallow coastal waters. Topographical map of the Albanian Riviera. The coastline covers an extensive part of the Ceraunian Mountains, which extends parallel immediately along the Ionian Sea, starting at Sarand√´, running for over 100 kilometers in a southeast-northwest direction along the Albanian Riviera, to Orikum. The mountainous interior is fragmented into several massifs often reaching 2,000 metres above the Adriatic. This unique mountainous structure reaches its highest point at Maja e √áik√´s, and is full of wide and steep terraces that slope down towards the sea. The extreme southern region has a flat and shallow character with the presence of Lake Butrint that was formed during the quaternary period. Maja e √áik√´s inside the Ceraunian Mountains as seen from the beach of Dh√´rmi. In terms of geology, the major structural characteristic of the coastline is the presence of numerous carbonate anticlines for example in Karaburun and Sarand√´. The core of these structures, which are mostly not visible at the surface, are constructed of Permian‚ÄìTriassic evaporates, that were formed about 252 million years ago. The coastline is abundant in dolomites from the triassic period, the carbonate rocks follows with limestone from the jurassic period and bituminous schists, cretaceous porcelain and phosphate limestone. The coastline is dominated by several long straight and rocky beaches, the most famous of which is the inaccurately named 5 kilometre long stretch of Borsh Beach in the Albanian Riviera's center. The slightly shorter Dh√´rmi and Himara Beaches lies further north. Nonetheless, the coastline is rugged and is dotted with bays and peninsulas such as Porto Palermo in the center. Sarand√´ is the largest city in the region and has wide beaches and a sheltered harbour. The climate of the coastline is considerably influenced by the sea and mountains. Under the K√∂ppen climate classification, the coastline experiences mostly a moderately hot and sunny mediterranean climate under influences of the continental climate. The mediterranean climate is typical of the coastal areas with considerable differences in temperature and rainfall between the seasons. The mountainous areas have a typical mountainous climate with frequent snow during winter.  Biodiversity  The egyptian vulture thrives in the traditional rural landscapes of the coastline. The diversity, in terms of topography, geology, hydrology and climatic conditions, determined the broad variety of life in the region. The coastline features contrasting habitats and ecosystems impacted by various environmental factors, many of which are with conservation of national significance. In terms of phytogeography, the Albanian Ionian Sea Coast belongs to the illyrian province of the circumboreal region within the boreal kingdom. It falls completely within the illyrian deciduous forests terrestrial ecoregion of the Palearctic Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome. The vegetation is predominantly represented by evergreen and deciduous shrubs associated with the Mediterranean Sea. The woodlands, close to freshwater habitats, are represented by the alluvial, mixed and conifer forests but also coastal woods. The forests, at loftier elevations, contain various pine, oak, beech and fir species such as black pine, silver fir, ash trees and the mount tabor oak, which is exceptionally rare and classified as endangered. The seagrasses are dominated by posidonia oceanica, halophila stipulacea and cymodocea nodosa that are mostly to be found in the shallow waters which, however, can extend to more than 30 metres in the depth. The fauna is incredibly rich and diverse, with many endemic, rare and threatened species. Because of their size and untouched landscapes, the inaccessible caves, scattered along the coastline, provide habitats for resting shelters for the critically endangered mediterranean monk seal. Karaburun and Butrint are frequently visited by the world's rarest pinniped. The forests are inhabited by the beech marten, red fox, wild boar, golden jackal, hare and eurasian otter, while the grey wolf is only present in winter. Whales and dolphins are frequent guests in the offshore waters of the coastline, though the most common are cuvier's beaked whale, sperm whale, short-beaked common dolphin, striped dolphin, while the common bottlenose dolphin may be observed all around the coast of Albania. Three primary species of sea turtles have been discovered such as the loggerhead sea, green sea and leatherback sea turtle. bays along the coastline provide habitats for many important species, among them three types of endangered sea turtles. Although not very large in size, the coastline is home to numerous species of birds that vary from nesting to breeding birds, and migranting to wintering birds. At the minimum 246 species of birds have been reported only in Butrint National Park. The rugged slopes and vertical sea cliffs provides excellent breeding conditions for the endangered egyptian vulture and golden eagle. The short-toed snake eagle is frequently to be found in open habitats with scattered trees, meadows, forest and rocky slopes. Protected areas provide a vast array of social, environmental and economic benefits to people and communities worldwide, containing outstanding areas of biodiversity, essential and cultural significance. The region contains areas of great ecological importance and there are a number of designations of parks and protected areas in the coastline that reflect the great value and importance of the region. The Karaburun-Sazan Marine Park is the most extensive national park in the region, encompassing the borderline of Karaburun Peninsula and Sazan Island in the north. Its terrain is dominated by a variety of landscape formations and most notable by the mountains of the peninsula which belongs to the Ceraunian Mountains. It is host to a diverse marine and terrestrial life attracting thousands of tourists all year around. Butrint National Park is slightly smaller and is located in the extreme south of the country close to the border between Albania and Greece. The surroundings of Butrint are not only home to numerous globally threatened species, but offers also a rich cultural history. It comprises an extraordinary diversity of habitats, ecosystems and wildlife. Although Lake Butrint was further recognised as a wetland of international importance by designation under the Ramsar Convention. The Llogara National Park is located in the Vlor√´ District and the third largest national park in the region. The park's natural environment is a vast one of exceptional beauty and unique biodiversity. Maja e √áik√´s, part of the Ceraunian Mountains, is located at the center of the park and is surrounded by dense forest which provide an exceptional view of nature and sea, bird watching, various peaks and animals. The park is covered with limestone and mountainous terrains providing various geological features.  Economy   Tourism  Butrint is one of the most important archaeological sites in Albania. Tourism is considered one of the largest industries in the economy of Albania. It has significantly increased since following the fall of communism in the country. The country has a rich historical and cultural heritage and natural beauty varying from clear turquoise waters fringed by sandy and rocky beaches to contrasting mountainous interior. The Albanian Ionian Sea Coast has a great cultural and architectural heritage, expressed in the region's churches, monasteries, mosques, citadels, castles, villages and so on, found in the main cities but also in smaller villages scattered alongside the region. The sunny, hot climate, landscape scenery, delicious cuisine, vast history and the diverse architecture attract many tourists from Albania and other countries. The tourist season peaks in the summer months, although people visit the region all year round. The Albanian Riviera has been repeatedly recognized as the country's best and popular coast by several prestigious papers and organizations for its natural beauties. The Port of Sarand√´ is port for a wide variety of cruise lines offering trips to exciting destinations around the coast. The majority of cruise lines anchoring at the port includes ships from MSC, Holland America, P&O;, Oceania, Regent Seven Seas and so on.

Athletics career He competed in the men's 400 metres hurdles at the 1964 Summer Olympics. Warden, Mike Hogan and the eventual silver medalist John Cooper were the only two British men to contest the event. Warden progressed to the semi-final after placing third in his heat with a time of 51.6 seconds. He unfortunately missed out on a place in the Olympic final by just two hundredths of a second after placing fifth in his semi-final behind the gold medalist Rex Cawley. Representing England, Warden won a bronze medal in the 440 yard hurdles and the 4 x 440 yards relay at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games. In this individual race 'Little Peter Warden' as he was dubbed by the commentator, hits the first hurdle and flicks grit from the cinder track into his eye, but continues racing and pulls out a staggering finish. The English relay team consisted of Martin Winbolt-Lewis, John Adey and Timothy Graham, with Warden running the third leg. The team were drawn in lane 4 with the favourites, Trinidad and Tabago on their outside in lane 8. The team finished a fantastic third and gained England another medal and contributing to their total of 80 medals at these Games. In 1967, Warden competed at the Kenya AAA's Championships (known as the 'Three As') and finished third despite the oxygen deprivation caused by competing at 1,795m above sea-level. In the report by British Path√©, Warden and the British athletes had to be given pure oxygen after their races due to the impact of the altitude on their bodies. He is currently listed as 66th on the British All-Time list for the 400 meter hurdles Under the British Athletics Federation (later became UK Athletics) Warden was made National Coach for the North West and was later made National Jumps Coach. In this position he coached many athletes including Max Robertson and was team manager at several Olympiads. However, in 1997 when the British Athletics Federation collapsed Warden, along with 8 other National Coaches including Bruce Longden who was instrumental in the career of Sally Gunnell, were made redundant.

It grows on animal dung and occurs in Europe, Asia and America. Description This species becomes black as it matures and soon autodigests. C. sterquilinus has an ellipsoid or ovoid cap, some by when closed, becoming conical and then flattening out to a width of . It is white, flocculous and fibrillose when young, becoming more scaly with a creamy centre as it matures. There are more than fifty gills, white at first, turning to grey and then black. The stipe or stem is slender, tall, with a moveable ring just above the slightly bulbous base. The spores are ellipsoid and very large at 17‚Äì26 by 10‚Äì15 ¬µm, very dark reddish-brown to black. Distribution and habitat The species has an extensive range in Europe, Asia and America, but is uncommon. It grows in dung and on manure heaps, particularly on horse manure. Biology Coprinus sterquilinus is closely related to the shaggy ink cap (Coprinus comatus). Both share the characteristic of the genus to autodigest; starting at the base of the gills, the spores develop and discharge, and the discharged basidia and the supporting hyphae produce enzymes which dissolve the tissues, and these drip from the base of the gills as a black liquid (which can be used as ink). Research The stipe is a hollow cylinder with thin walls. It is slender and rather brittle but is strong in its longitudinal axis. This can be seen in the way that the cap is pushed through dung or even asphalt, and the caps scarcely sway, even in a gale. In an experiment, one fruit body lifted , giving an upward pressure of the stipe of two thirds of an atmosphere. This pressure is generated by the turgor pressure of the cells forming the thin walls of the stipe.

A contemporary of activists Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, she is featured in the 2017 documentary The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson. Early life and education Cruz was born in Gu√°nica, Puerto Rico. At the age of four, she moved with her family, which grew to 11 children, to Red Hook, Brooklyn. Cruz came out as transgender at a young age, later stating \\"I was born different and I always acted as a female.\\" Her family was supportive of her. Cruz graduated from high school with a cosmetology license, and later majored in theater at Brooklyn College. After finding a doctor to assist in her gender transition, Cruz performed as a stripper and dancer at clubs in the West Village. She spent time at the Stonewall Inn during the era of the Stonewall riots, as she was dating one of the club's doormen. In 1970, one year after the Stonewall uprising, Cruz took part in the first Gay Pride march, then called the Christopher Street Liberation Day. Career and activism Unable to find work in theater after graduating from college, Cruz worked as a hairdresser. She struggled financially, and became addicted to crack cocaine. Cruz then began working at the Cobble Hill Nursing Home in Brooklyn. In 1996, four female co-workers groped and sexually harassed her. With the help of the Anti-Violence Project, she reported the assault. Two of the four women were found guilty of harassment; the others were acquitted. Cruz then began working with the Anti- Violence Project in 1997. She dedicated her life to helping victims of LGBT violence and rape. In 2017, Cruz was featured in the David France documentary The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson. In the film, Cruz conducts an investigation into how Johnson, whose 1992 death was initially ruled a suicide, really died. Cruz has referred to Johnson as the \\"Rosa Parks of our community.\\" The documentary premiered at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival, and was subsequently acquired by Netflix for worldwide distribution, with a release date of October 6.

He has published more than a dozen books, as well as hundreds of journal papers, book chapters and reviews on faith and holiness. His works include religious social history, social theory and its connections with theology, the works of S√∏ren Kierkegaard, contemporary Eastern Orthodox theology and theologians of the Russian emigration and saints. More recently, his research and publications explore persons of faith, seeking identity and God in spiritual journeys. He is also writing about persons of faith struggling for social justice and for ways of rediscovering holiness in ordinary life. He is especially interested in the encounter with God in the everyday. Plekon's efforts to describe what holiness looks like in our time, the distinctive characteristics of women and men of faith, have been praised by colleagues. They see it as an important \\"new hagiography\\" or writing about saints who are our contemporaries, like Dorothy Day, Mother Teresa, Thomas Merton or Daniel Berrigan. Plekon has had a long career as an academic, theologian and clergy member. Since 1977, Plekon has taught at Baruch College, first as an Assistant Professor, and eventually as a Professor within the Weissman School of Arts and Sciences since 1998. In addition to his academic work, he has served as an Associate Priest as St. Gregory Orthodox Church in Wappingers Falls, New York since 1996. Ordained in 1983 in the Lutheran Church in America (LCA), later the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) Plekon was later received into the Orthodox Church in America (OCA). For almost 40 years, he has served as a parish pastor, alongside teaching and research. He is writing about his pastoral experiences and is examining the importance of community, not only for church but for meaning and depth in one's life in a book in progress. This work also deals with our need, in a diverse America, to cross into other cultures and religious traditions with respect, learning from them and becoming deeper persons from this encounter. This was something he experienced in his own family's ecumenical sensitivity. Plekon's book, Uncommon Prayer: Prayer in Everyday Experience, was named by Spirituality and Practice as one of the best spiritual books of 2016 and was the Gold Winner of the 2016 Foreword INDIES book of the Year Award in the Adult Nonfiction, Religion category. Biography Plekon's interest in studying religion began early on when he chose to pursue a bachelor's degree in Sociology and Philosophy from the Catholic University in Washington, D.C. in 1970. He later obtained a master‚Äôs degree and a doctorate in Sociology and Religion from Rutgers University in New Jersey. Plekon's doctoral advisor was renowned sociologist of religion and theologian Peter L. Berger, who mentions Plekon in his memoir among his students of interest as an \\"expert in the Orthodox (Christian) diaspora in the West.\\". Plekon met his wife Jeanne through a long-time friend while she was pursuing a master's in art history and museum studies at The Clark Institute, Williams College. They have been married since 1976 and have two children, Paul and Hannah. Awards and Honors Plekon has received more than twenty research awards in his years at Baruch College-CUNY, including annual PSC-CUNY Faculty Research Awards, several Baruch Faculty Fellowships for a year of study and other research grants. * Ecumenical advisor, Lutheran Forum, 1996-2007. * Nominee, Excellence in Teaching Award, Baruch College,1981, 1983, 1985, 1987, 1998. * Election as President of the Board of Lutheran Ministries in Higher Education, 1982-87. * Associate member, Columbia University Seminar in Religious Studies, 1982‚Äì87 * Honoree, CUNY Salute to Scholars, 1981. * National Endowment for the Humanities Fellow, honorary Fulbright, American Scandinavian Institute and Lutheran World Federation Fellow at the University of Copenhagen's Institute for Systematic Theology References Further reading * Michael Plekon, editor, Fossil or Leaven: The Church We Hand Down: Essays in Honor of the 50th Anniversary of New Skete, Montreal and Cambridge NY: Alexander Press/New Skete Monasteries, 272 pages, 2017. * Michael Plekon, The World as Sacrament: Ecumenical Reflections on Worldly Spirituality, Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 272 pages, 2017. * Michael Plekon, Uncommon Prayer: Prayer in Everyday Experience, University of Notre Dame Press, 2016, 285 pages. * Michael Plekon, Maria Gywn McDowell, Elizabeth Schroeder, eds., \\"The Church Has Left the Building\\": Faith, Parish and Ministry in the 21st Century, Eugene OR: Cascade, 2016, 141 pages. * John A.

These women were life peers appointed by the Prime Minister. Women hereditary peers were able to sit in the Lords from 1963. In 2015, the first female Church of England bishop sat as one of the Lords Spiritual. Today, women make up just over a quarter of the members of the Lords, which compares with a third of the members of the Commons. History Women were excluded from the House of Lords until the Life Peerages Act 1958, passed to address the declining number of active members, made possible the creation of peerages for life. Women were immediately eligible and four were among the first life peers appointed, including Baroness Wootton of Abinger, who was the first woman to be appointed, and Baroness Swanborough, who was the first to take her seat. However, hereditary peeresses continued to be excluded until the passage of the Peerage Act 1963; the first to take her seat was Baroness Strange of Knokin. The first female chief whip was Baroness Llewelyn-Davies of Hastoe in 1973. Baroness Young was the first woman leader of the House of Lords in 1981. Baroness Hale of Richmond became the first female Law Lord in 2004. Since the passage of the House of Lords Act 1999, hereditary peeresses remain eligible for election to the Upper House. Five were elected in 1999 among the 92 hereditary peers who continued to sit. Of these, three have since died, and the other two retired in 2014 and 2020 (the Countess of Mar was the last female hereditary peer in the Lords upon retiring), and they were all replaced by male peers in by-elections (except for the Countess of Mar, whose successor has not yet been elected, as of September 2020). Following a change to the law in 2014 to allow women to be ordained bishops, the Lords Spiritual (Women) Act 2015 was passed, which provides that whenever a vacancy arises among the Lords Spiritual during the ten years following the Act coming into force, the vacancy has to be filled by a woman, if one is eligible. This does not apply to the five bishops who sit by right. In 2015, Rachel Treweek, Bishop of Gloucester, became the first woman to sit as a Lord Spiritual in the House of Lords due to the Act. As of 2020, five women bishops sit as Lord Spirituals in the House of Lords.  Numbers  There are 206 female peers out of 781 (26%) in the House of Lords as of March 2019, up from 199 out of 826 (24%) in 2015, 176 out of 771 (23%) in 2013, and 164 out of 777 (21%) in 2010. Compared with the House of Commons, women make up slightly fewer of the total members of the Lords; 32% of the members of the Commons were women after the 2017 General Election.

Pictish Symbol Stone The roofless sandstone tower is 22.5m (74 ft) high and has a diameter of 4.57m (15 ft) at ground level, tapering upwards to 3.96m (13 ft). The walls are 1.07m (3.5 ft) thick. The 12 lower layers are of a different coloured stone to the rest of the building, leading to speculation that the base was built earlier than the rest. There are indications that the tower originally had six wooden floors, probably connected by ladders. Fixed to the outside base of the tower is a Pictish stone; the tower also has an iron joug or pillory attached. Various changes have been made to the tower over the years, including the installation of an iron spiral staircase when it became a lookout tower, windows and an outside clock. The current clock dates from 1868. Here Malcolm III of Scotland paid homage to William the Conqueror some six years after the Battle of Hastings.

Built in 1905, it is a well-preserved example of period mill architecture, which served as an important area employer for many years. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The Dexter Mill is located about east of downtown Newport, with Sunapee Street (New Hampshire Routes 11 and 103) to the north and the Sugar River to the south. The complex includes the main mill building, an office building, and a dam across the river. The primary structure is a three-story brick building, with a five-story tower at the southwest corner. The tower has narrow round-arch windows at its lower levels, and has an open fifth level with banks of larger round-arch openings. Connected to the mill via a tunnel is a small brick office building. The dam across the river is a concrete structure built in 1948, replacing an older stone structure, some of whose remains are still visible. The mill site east of Newport has a documented industrial history back to at least 1848, when the first known mill was built at the site. The present mill building was constructed in 1905 for the Richards family, prominent local businessmen and industrialists. It was designed by Peterborough native Edward A. Buss, and is stylistically typical of industrial buildings of the period. The Richards family operated the mill until 1926, after which a consortium produced woolen goods using the name Gordon Woolen Mill.

Modly (born December 15, 1960) is an American businessman and government official who served as acting United States Secretary of the Navy from November 24, 2019, to April 7, 2020. Modly's resignation occurred in the wake of firing and berating Brett Crozier, the captain of the aircraft carrier , for allegedly going outside his chain of command in calling for help to deal with a COVID-19 outbreak onboard. Later, Modly traveled to the ship at port in Guam, where he addressed the crew in a manner that was perceived as disrespectful. He was subsequently widely criticized, and soon resigned. Modly, who was confirmed as the United States Under Secretary of the Navy on December 4, 2017, also temporarily performed the duties of the Secretary of the Navy while Richard V. Spencer was acting Secretary of Defense and acting Deputy Secretary of Defense from July 15, 2019, to July 31, 2019. Career Modly was raised in Cleveland, Ohio, graduating from Shaker Heights High School in 1979. He is a graduate of the United States Naval Academy class of 1983, Georgetown University, and Harvard Business School. He served on active duty in the United States Navy as a helicopter pilot and spent seven years as a U.S. Navy officer. He has held various leadership positions at Iconixx, Oxford Associates, and UNC Inc., and taught political science at the United States Air Force Academy. Modly served as the managing director of the PricewaterhouseCoopers global government and public services sector and as the firm's global government defense network leader. He has served as the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Financial Management and as the first executive director of the Defense Business Board. He was nominated as Under Secretary of the Navy by President Donald Trump in September 2017 and was confirmed by the Senate two months later. USS Theodore Roosevelt USS Theodore Roosevelt in October 2019 Captain Brett Crozier was captain of the US aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, deployed in the Pacific. On March 24, 2020, after two weeks at sea, three members of the crew tested positive for COVID-19. The next day, eight more sailors were infected, and within a few days it was \\"dozens.\\" Crozier sent a letter to 10 people: Crozier's immediate superior, Rear Admiral Stuart P. Baker, plus two other admirals of U.S. forces in the Pacific, with copies to seven other Navy captains, but not including Acting Secretary Modly or Modly's chief of staff. The letter criticized the Navy's management of a COVID-19 outbreak onboard the Theodore Roosevelt, and recommended decisive action to deal with it. The letter was then leaked to the press. On April 2, 2020, while serving as Acting Secretary of the Navy, Thomas Modly dismissed Captain Crozier from command of the Theodore Roosevelt. Modly said he had lost confidence in Crozier's judgment because he claimed the letter went against the advice of Admiral Michael M. Gilday, Chief of Naval Operations, who argued that usual Navy procedures would require an investigation before such an action. Modly also said he acted to prevent a repetition of a 2019 incident in which \\"the Navy Department got crossways with the president\\" after Trump's intervention in the case of Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher. \\"I put myself in the president's shoes,\\" Modly stated. \\"I considered how the president felt like he needed to get involved in Navy decisions. I didn't want that to happen again.\\" The situation has been described as highlighting \\"a growing divide between senior uniformed commanders and their civilian bosses\\". On April 6, Modly flew to Guam and made a speech to the Theodore Roosevelt‚Ä≤s crew over the ship's PA system. In it he criticized and ridiculed Crozier, saying \\"if he didn't think that information was going to get out into the public...then he was [either] too naive or too stupid to be a commanding officer of a ship like this [or] he did this on purpose.\\" In other parts of Modly's speech, he told the sailors: \\"you're not required to love\\" Crozier, and that the only thing they should expect from their leaders is to \\"treat you fairly and put the mission of the ship first\\". Modly also used his speech to criticize the media, future Democratic Nominee Joe Biden, and China. While giving the speech, which The New York Times described as a \\"tirade\\", Modly was heckled by some of the sailors. Modly spent 30 minutes on the ship and left; the round trip taken by Modly took 50 hours and was estimated to have cost taxpayers more than $243,000. Due to his trip to the Theodore Roosevelt, Modly himself was quarantined. Modly's comments were quickly leaked to the media first as a transcript and then as an audio recording. When questioned about his comments to the crew, Modly said he stood \\"by every word\\", including profanity that he said he used for emphasis. He later apologized for his comments, saying \\"I believe, precisely because [Crozier] is not naive or stupid, that he sent his alarming email with the intention of getting it into the public domain in an effort to draw public attention to the situation on his ship.\\" When the audio of his speech was released, Modly resigned the next day. =Reaction to firing= Congressmen Ted Lieu (D-CA) and Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) called on the Department of Defense Inspector General to investigate whether Acting Secretary Modly had acted inappropriately in relieving Crozier of his command. The following week they sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Mark Esper calling for Modly to be fired because of his comments to sailors aboard the Theodore Roosevelt and his decision to relieve Crozier. Several other Democratic members of Congress, including Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, joined in the call for Modly's resignation or removal. On April 7, Modly apologized for his comments and resigned from his position. Personal life Modly is married to Robyn Modly; the couple have four children together.

The still extant companies in 1803 were amalgamated into the Royal Foreign Artillery. The units were among the large number of foreign units in British service during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. The Royal Foreign Artillery was disbanded in 1815. Origins Jeanne-Etienne Fourier de Nacquard established the unit on 29 March 1795. He had commanded an artillery company of French emigr√©es and Dutch troops in Dutch service in 1793. When the Anglo-Hanoverian forces retreated he took his unit with them to Hanover. There he put it in English service in January 1795. When he received permission to form a unit he drew on the men that he had brought with him. A second, separate company was formed in August, and in October the two companies came together at Stade. The Dutch Emigrant Artillery was then formally established on 8 December 1795, with now major Nacquard in command. His brother, le chevalier de Nacquard, commanded the second company. The British intent was station the unit in the West Indies, Grouvel (1957), pp. 285-91. where they would serve in forts as part of the coast artillery alongside units of the Royal Artillery. Move to England On 15 December the unit embarked at Stade for England, and by the end of the month it had arrived at the Isle of Wight. There they were assigned to a brigade under Sir John Moore, together with La Tour's Royal Foreigners and Hompesch's hussars. The Corps embarked for the West indies in March 1796 and arrived at M√¥le-Saint-Nicolas at the beginning of June. The brothers did not accompany the companies but rather stayed in England where they established a depot at Lymington.King (1879), p. 175. They also established a third, depot company, under the command of Captain de M√©nard. Formally, the corps consisted of three companies, each of four officers and 107 men. There was also a HQ staff of six men.Chartrand (2013). West Indies The move to the West indies was part of Admiral Hugh Cloberry Christian's expedition to the West Indies. After numerous false starts aborted by weather issues, the fleet sailed on 26 April to invade St Lucia, with troops under Lieutenant-General Sir Ralph Abercromby. St Lucia surrendered to the British on 25 May. The British went on to capture Saint Vincent and Grenada. sir John Moore accompanied Abercromby. Some part of the Corps apparently participated in the campaign. After the Corps arrived in Haiti it was broken into smaller detachments. Still, the 1st company essentially remained at M√¥le-Saint-Nicolas. The 2nd company was assigned to Port-au-Prince. In May 1797 the British, including the 2nd Company, attacked Mirebalais and Grand-Bois and recaptured them from Toussaint Louverture, who had expelled his rivals there. Major de Nacquard died on 23 June 1796. His brother replaced him as commander of the Corps, and received promotion to Major on 15 July. The 3rd Company remained at the depot in Lymington. The Corps also had a small recruiting office on the continent. Major de Nacquard in 1798 brought out to San Domingo a draft of troops drawn from the 3rd company. The Corps had a high casualty rate from disease and was consistently understrength. In 1798 the companies served with distinction in the defense of the fort at Les Irois, and at J√©r√©mie in the Grand'Anse department. de Nacquard returned to England in July. The British evacuated San Domingo in October 1798 with the Corps arriving at Port Royal, Jamaica, on 12 October. The third company, under the command of Captain de M√©nard, left England in October on the armed merchantman , bound for Jamaica. On 3 December 1799, in the latitude of San Domingo, they encountered and engaged the French privateer Entreprenante. Towards the end of the engagement the troops boarded the French ship and captured her. In the combat the French suffered somewhere between 75 and 100 dead and wounded, and the British, including the Dutch company, suffered one man killed and 14 wounded.\\"Ship News.\\" Times [London, England 3 Mar. 1800: 3. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 3 Oct. 2017.] Achilles then delivered her troops to Port Royal. The corps sent two officers and 24 men to the Bahamas. In 1801 it also stationed a detachment at Cura√ßao. In November 1801 the depot moved from Lymington to East Cowes. Peace of Amiens The end of the war after the Treaty of Amiens saw the corps reduced as an economy measure. The first company transferred an officer and 39 gunners to the third company, and then was disbanded. the second company sailed for Lymington in March 1803. The depot moved to Hurst Castle in April 1803, and then moved back to Lymmington where its men were incorporated into the returning second company and the depot closed. The third company remained in Jamaica as \\"Menard's supernumerary company attached to the Royal Artillery for service at Jamaica\\". Detachments served at Port Antonio, Montego Bay, and Rock Fort. With the activation of the Royal Foreign Artillery, the two companies of the Dutch Emigrant Artillery were amalgamated into it. de Nacquard and de M√©nard are listed in 1810 among the officers of the Royal Foreign Artillery.Accounts and Estimates, Army Returns (1810), vol. 13, p. 14.

Early life Thomas Munson \\"Tom\\" Scaperlanda was born in Galveston, Texas, on December 16, 1895. Career Tom Scaperlanda became a circus enthusiast in 1910. Scaperlanda and his brother Pasco Joseph Scaperlanda (1893‚Äì1941), together with Harry Hertzberg, were early members of the Circus Fans Association of which Scaperlanda later became president. The San Antonio chapter was named after Alfredo Codona, considered the world's greatest flying trapeze artist of all time, known for his daring triple somersault. He was a close friend of Scaperlanda and in 1932 gave him a detailed drawing of his trapeze rigging. He was a veteran of World War I. In 1969 Scaperlanda was one of four circus historians named to the National Awards Committee. The panel annually elects circus greats to the Circus Hall of Fame located in Sarasota, Florida.

He donated the elephant statue to Harry Hertzberg which became part of the Circus Collection donated to the City of San Antonio and now at the Witte Museum. Scaperlanda hired a San Antonio cast-stone worker, Julian Sandoval, to cast the elephant statue and it was originally placed in front of Hertzberg's house on Euclid Avenue. The statue was part of fives, and one of them was donated by his owner, Joaquin R. Abrego, to be placed near the Hertzberg's one.

Prior to 2005, matchups between CL and PL teams occurred only during spring training, the All-Star Series, a short-lived exhibition tournament called the Suntory Cup, and the Japan Series. Central League teams were reluctant to implement regular-season interleague play as it would cut into the money they would receive from games played against the Yomiuri Giants, the hugely popular CL team that generates the most money in Japanese baseball. However, during the 2004 NPB realignment, the merger of two PL teams that were struggling financially, the rumor of a second PL team merger, and talks of contracting and restructuring the two-league system into one ten-team league prompted the suggestion of interleague play as a possible solution. Team representatives eventually approved one merger, agreed to maintain the two-league system, and approved to hold interleague regular-season games during the 2005 season. Official regular-season interleague play was first introduced in the 2005 season and had each team playing 36 games against teams in the other league. Two years later, interleague play was cut to 24 games per team for the 2007 season. The amount of interleague regular-season games was again reduced for the start of the 2015 season to 18 games per team where it has remained through today. Currently, interleague play is a single event within the regular season with all games being played during a single three-week block beginning in late May. Each CL and PL team plays a three-game series at home against half the teams in the opposing league and a three-game set on the road against the other half. Each consecutive season, teams switch these home-and- away roles. The designated hitter is implemented when PL clubs are the home team. At the conclusion, the event's sponsor, Nippon Life, announces several awards, all of which are accompanied by monetary prizes. Player awards include one interleague MVP award and two Nippon Life Awards, one from each league. History Unlike Major League Baseball (MLB), Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) does not require teams to participate in revenue sharing strategies that would help correct the revenue imbalances between teams because of game attendance and television broadcasting contracts. These issues are problematic because the Yomiuri Giants, a team in the Central League (CL) and NPB's most popular team, generates revenue much easier than any other team. Daily Yomiuri baseball reporter Jim Allen has estimated that the Giants account for 40% of all NPB television broadcasting revenue, while the eleven remaining teams accounted for the other 60%.Klein 2006, pp. 148‚Äì149 Because of this imbalance, Pacific League (PL) team owners had lobbied commissioner's office and the CL owners for years to introduce interleague play into the regular season, however CL teams rejected the idea. They believed that if PL teams were allowed to play against the Giants, the remaining five CL teams would lose home games against Yomiuri and the sellout crowds and prime time TV and radio broadcasting rights money along with them. Additionally, Giants' owner Tsuneo Watanabe did not want his team competing against the PL teams. Suntory Cup Sponsored by Suntory, the Suntory Cup was a preseason interleague tournament created to serve as a test run for regular-season interleague play. It was held only twice, once before the 1999 and 2000 seasons. The tournament consisted of a series of exhibition games between CL and PL teams. After each team played one game against all six teams in the other league, the team with the highest winning percentage was declared the winner. All of the games featured the designated hitter rule and any game tied at the end of nine innings resulted in a draw. Among other payouts, the winning team received ¬•10 million of the ¬•34.6 million purse and the most valuable player of the series took home ¬•2 million. Discussion and approval Talk of introducing interleague play as regular season games emerged again before the 2004 season. In February, Keio University professor Masaru Ikei wrote an op-ed in the Sankei Shimbun detailing proposals that would help revive Japanese baseball; interleague play was his first idea. A few weeks later, Commissioner of Baseball Yasuchika Negoro expressed interest in exploring the idea of in- season interleague games and was willing to discuss the idea with general managers and team owners. During the 2004 Nippon Professional Baseball realignment, the planned merger of two PL teams, the Kintetsu Buffaloes and the Orix BlueWave, along with the rumor of a second PL team merger in the near future prompted talk of possibly contracting and restructuring the two-league system into one ten-team league. If NPB was restructured in this way, every team would be playing every other team throughout the regular season. Instead of this restructuring, Hanshin Tigers' president Katsuyoshi Nozaki proposed interleague play as a possible alternative solution. He claimed that interleague play would allow Central and Pacific League teams to play each other an equal number of times so that it would seem that it was a one-league system, however the All-Star Series and the Japan Series, two series played between teams and players from the opposing leagues, could be saved. Eventually, team representatives approved the merger between the Buffaloes and BlueWave but also agreed to maintain the two-league system while still looking into introducing interleague games for the next season. During an owners meeting on September 29, 2004, a plan was approved to hold interleague regular-season games during the 2005 season. Interleague play introduced Nippon Professional Baseball first implemented regular-season interleague games in the 2005 season. Thirty-six interleague games were played by all twelve teams during a single six-week block between May 6 and June 16 and the event was sponsored by Nippon Life. Each team in the Central and Pacific Leagues played three home and three away games against each club from the opposing league. All series during this period consisted of three games. For any weekend rainouts in any outdoor ballparks, Mondays served as makeup days. The four days between the end of interleague play on June 16 and resuming the regular intraleague schedule on June 21 were left open to accommodate any additional makeup games. After two seasons, the number of interleague games played by each team was reduced from 36 to 24. CL representatives pushed for a reduction in games because they believed that the four off days needed to potentially replay postponed games were too many. Each of the twelve series was reduced from three to two games. For only the 2014 season, the 10th season featuring interleague play, NPB inverted the designated hitter rule. Instead of the designated hitter being used in games where the Pacific League team was the home team, it was in effect in Central League parks. Later that same season, it was announced that the interleague schedule would again be changed for a third time starting with the 2015 season. Again, the CL was unhappy with the interleague schedule. They cited the frequent travel required for the shorter two-game series of the 24-game format as the reason for the change. CL officials used the increased frequency of games being played by the Japan national baseball team as leverage in the negotiations, and argued that the international competitions required a more efficient NPB schedule. Interleague play was again reduced, this time from 24 to 18 games for each team. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, NPB decided to cancel interleague play for the 2020 season. The cancellation marked the first time since its inception in 2005 that interleague games would not be held and was an effort to maximize the number of intraleague games that could be played during the shortened season. Cancellations and modifications of both the All-Star Series and Climax Series were also eventually announced for the same reasons. Current format and rules Interleague play is treated as its own event with definitive start and end dates within the regular season. All 108 interleague games are played in a three-week block beginning in late May. Ever since the 2015 season, each CL and PL team plays 18 games via a three-game series at home against half the teams in the opposing league and a three-game set on the road against the other half. Each consecutive season, teams switch these home-and-away roles. The Central League president is the authority for games played in the CL stadiums, and the Pacific League chairman oversees contests where the PL club is the home team. Likewise, the designated hitter rule is implemented when PL clubs are the home team, however pitchers bat when the traditional style of nine-man baseball is played when a CL team hosts the game. The PL rule of announcing starting pitchers the day before game day was not in effect regardless of where the games are played, and two umpires from each league work the games. Records and awards Since interleague play's implementation in the 2005 season, the Pacific League has won more games against the Central League every year except one, the 2009 season. At the conclusion of interleague play, the event's sponsor, Nippon Life, announces several awards, all of which are accompanied by a monetary prize. Player awards include one interleague MVP award and two Nippon Life Awards, one from each league. Nippon Life also awards money to the top six teams with the highest winning percentage as well as the team with the most wins. { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" border=\\"1\\" + Yearly interleague records and awards - !scope=\\"col\\" Season !scope=\\"col\\" Total games !scope=\\"col\\" CL wins !scope=\\"col\\" PL wins !scope=\\"col\\" Ties !scope=\\"col\\" Most Valuable Player !scope=\\"col\\" CL Nippon Life Insurance Award winner !scope=\\"col\\" PL Nippon Life Insurance Award winner - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" 2005  216  104  105  7    - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" 2006  216  107  108  1    - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" 2007  144  66  74  4    - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" 2008  144  71  73  0    - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" 2009  144  70  67  7    - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" 2010  144  59  81  4    - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" 2011  144  57  78  9    - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" 2012  144  66  67  11    - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" 2013  144  60  80  4    - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" 2014  144  70  71  3    - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" 2015  108  44  61  3    - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" 2016  108  47  60  1    - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" 2017  108  51  56  1    - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" 2018  108  48  59  1    - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" 2019  108  46  58  4    - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" 2020 colspan=7 Interleague play canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic } See also * Interleague play ‚Äì Major League Baseball's iteration of the interleague system Notes  References  * External links * (in Japanese) Interleague play Baseball terminology Nippon Professional Baseball competitions Recurring sporting events established in 2005 ","title":"Interleague play (NPB)"},{"id":"55446855","text":"Push and shove may refer to: *Push and Shove (album), by No Doubt, 2012 **\\"Push and Shove\\" (song), the title song *Push and shove router, a type of router supported by various EDA layout programs See also *A Push and a Shove, a 2007 novel by Christopher Kelly ","title":"Push and shove"},{"id":"55446878","text":"Worle is a surname.

(1826 ‚Äì 21 August 1899), generally referred to as H. T. Whittell or H. Thomas Whittell, was a medical doctor in South Australia and Adelaide's City Coroner. Biography Whittell was born in Warwick, England, and had a happy childhood. He was educated at one of the private schools in Leamington Spa. At age nineteen he entered Queen's College, Birmingham, to study medicine and in his spare time read books about legal cases. He received his diploma as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and served some time as house surgeon at Queen's Hospital. He spent ten years practising in Birmingham, then obtained his M.D. degree at Aberdeen. He arrived in Adelaide in May 1858 and was soon an active member of the Total Abstinence Society.He had a very busy practice, first operating from his home on Grenfell Street, near the Sturt Hotel, then ten years later on North Terrace. Adelaide experienced an outbreak of diphtheria around July to September 1859, and Whittell, who had had some experience of an epidemic in England shortly before he left, was kept busy. By a remarkable piece of timing, his booklet on the disease appeared in the bookshops in August that year. He initially had a solo practice, then after the death of Dr. Anton Bayer in 1866, joined his erstwhile partner Dr. William Gosse (c. 1813‚Äì1883) in partnership for about six years then returned to a solo practice. In 1879, suffering perhaps from overwork, he took on Dr. J. Davies Thomas (c. 1845‚Äì1893) as a partner. At the end of that year he sold the practice to Dr. Thomas, and sought recuperation in an extended trip to Europe. He remained in Europe for two and a half years, and became vitally interested in the recent microbial discoveries and developed a passion for microscopy. He associated with the leading microscopical men at the time when bacteriology was beginning to have a marked effect upon the views of the pathologists in London. He met Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur, the great scientists whose discoveries were attracting worldwide attention, and made a lasting impression on Whittell. Whittell succeeded Gosse as President of the Central Board of Health on 20 August 1883, and applied microscopy to the solution of many problems of public sanitation. In January 1886, as part of a series of retrenchments, he was appointed Registrar of Births, Marriages and Deaths to replace J. F. Cleland. This was in addition to his Board of Health duties without any addition to his salary. On the (perhaps forced) resignation of Thomas Ward (1815 ‚Äì 28 December 1888) in October 1888, Whittell was appointed City Coroner on top of his duties at the Central Board of Health, and in addition was made Vaccination Officer and Inspector of Anatomy. Despite his multiple roles, Whittell was being seriously discussed by Parliament for retrenchment. He was replaced as Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages by George Hamilton Ayliffe, son of Thomas Hamilton Ayliffe, in January 1889. It was perhaps as City Coroner that Dr. Whittell rendered the greatest official service to the colony. This is a job which on top of medical knowledge is required a great deal of tact and sensitivity, qualities which the obituarist declares, Whittell had in abundance, together with a working knowledge of the law. He was also considerate of witnesses, never allowing an inquest to extend into a second day if it could be dealt with in one. He died peacefully after a few months' illness; his remains were buried at the West Terrace Cemetery. His wife died of pneumonia a few months later, and his son may have been written out of his will, as the bulk of his estate was inherited by his daughter Anna.

An unusually fast-moving tropical cyclone, it caused severe flooding in Central America, leading to widespread destruction and casualties, during early October 2017, before making landfall on the US Gulf Coast. The fourteenth named storm and ninth hurricane of the hyperactive 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Nate originated from a broad area of low pressure over the southwestern Caribbean on October 3. The disturbance moved northwest, organizing into a tropical depression the next day and attaining tropical storm intensity early on October 5. The storm moved ashore the coastline of Nicaragua thereafter. Little change in strength occurred as the system continued into Honduras, and Nate began steady intensification over the warm waters of the northwestern Caribbean Sea shortly thereafter. It attained hurricane strength while moving through the Yucat√°n Channel early on October 7, attaining peak winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) in the central Gulf of Mexico later that day. Early on the next day, Nate made landfall near the mouth of the Mississippi River in Louisiana. After crossing the marshland of the Mississippi Delta, it made its second U.S. landfall near Biloxi, Mississippi early on October 8, causing a storm surge to flood the ground floor of coastal casinos and buildings, as well as causing rip currents, hurricane-force winds, and beach erosion. Moving northwestward at , Nate was the fastest-moving tropical system ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico. It is also the fourth Atlantic hurricane of 2017 to have made landfall in the United States or one of its territories; such a quartet of landfalls has not occurred since 2005. In addition, Nate was the first tropical cyclone to move ashore in the state of Mississippi since Hurricane Katrina. A total of 48 deaths were attributed to Nate: 16 deaths were counted in Nicaragua, 14 in Costa Rica, 5 in Guatemala, 7 in Panama, 3 in Honduras, 1 in El Salvador, and 2 in the United States. Meteorological history An elongated surface trough of low pressure began interacting with an upper-level low across the northwestern Caribbean at the start of October, resulting in widespread cloudiness and scattered showers across the region. Despite unusually low surface pressures, strong upper-level winds were initially forecast to prevent significant organization. During the afternoon hours of October 3, satellite imagery and surface observations indicated that a broad area of low pressure had formed over the extreme southwestern Caribbean. The disturbance began to show signs of strengthening almost immediately; satellite images the next morning showed large curved bands of deep convection wrapping into the well-defined center, prompting the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to upgrade it to a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC on October 4, while located about south of San Andres Island. The newly formed cyclone traveled on a northwest course during its incipience, steered by a ridge over the southwestern Atlantic. Later on October 4, the inner core convection blossomed, with a well-defined convective band on the eastern semicircle. The presence of a partial eyewall on the San Andres radar, coupled with surface observations from Nicaragua, incentivized the NHC to upgrade the depression to Tropical Storm Nate at 06:00 UTC on October 5. 6 hours later, the system had moved ashore just south of Puerto Cabezas. Combined with moderate southwesterly wind shear aloft, the storm's passage over the rugged terrains of Nicaragua and Honduras caused the cloud pattern to deteriorate, although its winds remained near tropical storm force. This lapse in structure was temporary, however, as Nate redeveloped deep convection even before re-emerging over water; in fact, the cyclone exhibited some semblance of a convective ring on microwave imagery. Embedded within a larger cyclonic gyre across Central America, Nate maintained a northwesterly course across land, bringing the storm into the Gulf of Honduras during the early hours of October 6. Infrared satellite loop of Nate making landfall in the Mississippi River Delta on October 8 Once over the warm waters of the northwestern Caribbean Sea, Nate began to strengthen slowly, despite its broad surface center and the disjointment of the maximum winds east from the center. A developing subtropical ridge over the western Atlantic turned the storm on a more north-northwest trajectory. NOAA and Air Force reserve reconnaissance aircraft sampling the system throughout the evening of October 6 confirmed continued intensification; data around 02:30 UTC the next day, showing a developing eyewall, supported upgrading Nate to the season's ninth consecutive hurricane. Continued flow between the ridge over the western Atlantic and the Central American gyre propelled Nate into the Yucat√°n Channel and then the Gulf of Mexico on October 7; in fact, with a 12-hour averaged motion of , Nate became the fastest-moving hurricane on record in the gulf. Favorable environmental conditions allowed the strengthening to continue: Nate developed a symmetrical central dense overcast, featuring cloud tops cooler than and a sizable eye underneath, attaining peak winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) at 12:00 UTC. The hurricane reached a minimum barometric pressure of 981 mbar (hPa; 28.97 inHg) 6 hours later. Impinging vertical wind shear caused Nate's convection to rapidly warm and lose structure, despite the storm's attempts to form a more distinct eye. Around 00:00 UTC on October 8, Nate made its second landfall near the mouth of the Mississippi River with winds of . Deep convection migrated to the north and east of the center, and a curve toward the north brought the storm ashore for the final time near Biloxi, Mississippi at 05:30 UTC with winds of . Inland, Nate became embedded within the fast mid- latitude westerlies, causing the storm to accelerate north-northeast while weakening to a tropical storm 30 minutes later. Surface observations indicated a rapidly weakening cyclone, prompting the NHC to downgrade Nate to a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC while it was located over southwestern Alabama; further advisories were relegated to the Weather Prediction Center (WPC). Nate continued to weaken, and degrading to a remnant low over Tennessee. A few hours later, the remnant low became an extratropical cyclone over the Ohio Valley. The extratropical cyclone moved northeastward into New England, then turned east-northeastward into Canadian Maritime on October 10. The extratropical remnant dissipated near Newfoundland on early October 11, as it degenerated into a trough rotating around another extratropical cyclone to its north.

Emergency agencies and governments issued various weather alerts for their respective countries, with the Caribbean shores of Nicaragua and Honduras placed under a tropical storm warning when a strengthening Nate approached land. Schools and public offices were closed as storm shelters were prepared. In addition, Nate led to the cancellation of a FIFA World Cup qualification match between Costa Rica and Honduras scheduled for October 6 at Estadio Nacional in San Jos√©. Still battling the preceding flooding, the entire region once again faced life- threatening situations as Nate's rains triggered mudslides and filled already rising rivers and streams to critical levels by October 5. Floods and mudslides were widespread, with Costa Rica and Nicaragua enduring the worst and deadliest impacts. As of October 11, the deluge had left 43 dead and nine missing across Central America, as well as causing serious structural damage. =Panama= During its formative stages, the precursor disturbance interacted with the monsoon trough to produce widespread cloudiness over Panama in the first week of October. Flooding rains fell over much of the Talamanca and Central mountain ranges, including the west-central provinces of Chiriqu√≠, Ng√§be-Bugl√©, Veraguas, Panam√° Oeste, Bocas del Toro, and Cocl√©, as well as Col√≥n and Guna Yala along the Atlantic coast. On October 3, Panamanian officials issued an alert for heavy rain with strong gusts and urged residents on the riverbanks of R√≠o de Jes√∫s to evacuate. In Ng√§be-Bugl√©, a landslide killed six people. Squally rains downed trees, damaged roofs, and flooded homes throughout Veraguas and Chiriqui; in the latter province, 150 homes in Puerto Armuelles were affected, and two people required rescue from the cascading waters of a river in the San Lorenzo District. Trees fell onto roads and homes in Panam√° Oeste, Panam√° Este, San Miguelito and Herrera, causing light damage. A few landslides impacted the roads in those regions, leaving some impassable and obstructing an important traffic junction in Vigu√≠. Blustery conditions associated with Nate affected 4,975 people throughout Panama and damaged or destroyed 84 houses. One person died in a shipwreck in Panama Bay. =Nicaragua= Tropical Storm Nate over Nicaragua on October 5 The Caribbean shores of Nicaragua were placed under alert as the precursor disturbance thrived, interacting with surrounding low pressures to produce widespread rainfall as early as October 3. Upon Nate's formation, a tropical storm warning was issued for the coast. Widespread flooding damaged or destroyed 5,953 homes, the vast majority in the Rivas Department, directly affecting approximately 29,000 people. At least 16 people died throughout Nicaragua while 1 other person was reported missing as of October 8. The term \\"Nate Effect\\" has been coined to describe a tropical cyclone in the Caribbean, that causes major damages on the Pacific side of the country. =Costa Rica= At the risk of flooding rains, Costa Rica's Central Valley, Pacific coast, and Huetar Norte region were placed under red alert for at least 3 days, starting on October 4, while a yellow alert was issued for the Caribbean coast. The greatest quantities, reaching , fell in Maritima; many other central Pacific locales, such as Quepos, recorded over that day. In contrast, the capital of San Jos√© received no more than . In the canton of Oreamuno, Cartago Province, a bridge and part of a riverside house succumbed to the forces of a river, swollen from the initial rains on October 3. By October 5, the situation culminated: muddy waters surged through streets, neighborhoods, and even homes‚Äîsome submerged to their roofs‚Äîas an increasing number of rivers burst their banks. About 800 residents living in risk zones had to be rescued, including 200 in Palmar Norte when the overflowing T√©rraba River swept away houses and belongings. The storm cut off drinking water to nearly 500,000 people, and left 18,500 without power. Torrents, landslides, and fallen trees‚Äîparticularly in the provinces of Cartago, Puntarenas, Guanacaste, Alajuela, and San Jos√©‚Äîclaimed the lives of 14 people, and forced 11,300 into 170 shelters across Costa Rica. The flooding was the worst to hit the country in recent years, leading to the \\"biggest crisis in Costa Rican history\\" according to President Luis Guillermo Sol√≠s. In response, Sol√≠s declared a state of emergency for the entire country on October 6, as well as a national day of mourning. The country's infrastructure, especially the road networks in southern regions, sustained tremendous damage from expansive flooding, landslides and subsidence; 117 roads throughout all provinces but Lim√≥n were affected in some way or form, 40 of which were rendered impassable. Spanning through Costa Rica, the Inter-American Highway suffered various degrees of damage at 112 different sites, ranging from superficial cracks and potholes, to total structural failures. At least 42 bridges collapsed, many waterways and drainage systems were overwhelmed, and a number of routes were practically \\"wiped out\\", isolating villages and leading to widespread disruptions in the transport sector. Many petrospheres at the World Heritage archaeological site of Palmar Sur were covered with up to of mud. The infrastructural costs across the country exceeded ‚Ç°10 billion (US$17.5 million), with repairs expected to take years. With over 306,000 acres (124,000 hectares) of arable land damaged, the agricultural sector reported significant losses. Among the hardest hit crops were sugarcane, vegetables, grains, melons and papayas, especially in the Guanacaste, Puntarenas and Central Valley regions. In Guanacaste, the storm converted pastures and sugarcane fields into ponds and washed out of rice. Material damage from Nate across Costa Rica is estimated at ‚Ç°106 billion (US$185 million). Total damages caused by the hurricane in Costa Rica are estimated at ‚Ç°322.1 billion (US$562 million), making it the costliest natural disaster in Costa Rican history. =Rest of Central America= Rainbow infrared satellite loop of Nate passing the Yucat√°n Channel on October 6 At least three people were killed and three others were reported missing across Honduras, including one in Tierra Blanca. One person was also killed in El Salvador. Cuba Heavy rains and strong winds impacted portions of western Cuba, particularly Pinar del R√≠o Province. Rainfall reached in San Juan y Mart√≠nez, bringing local reservoirs to near-capacity. Some flooding affected homes in the province, but overall damage was limited. Winds up to disrupted electrical service in Cabo San Antonio. United States A washed out road in Jackson County, Mississippi. The local officials in Louisiana, Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi declared states of emergency or also evacuation orders. In preparation for Nate, officials in Grand Isle, Louisiana, declared a voluntary evacuation. New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu met with local, state, and federal officials to discuss preparation measures as the city continued to experience critical deficiencies in its drainage system from two months prior. Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency for 29 counties in the northern portion of the state. Offshore, oil and gas companies began evacuating production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. Six platforms had been cleared by midday on October 5, and a movable rig was moved out of the storm's path. Aircraft of the Air Force Reserve Command's 403d Wing were evacuated from Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi, as a precautionary measure. The military also prepared the amphibious assault ship Iwo Jima and transport dock New York to assist with search-and-rescue and recovery effort. Rain-slicked roads may have been a factor in a fatal accident along Interstate 24 in Tennessee. A firefighter was struck and killed by a car while cleaning up storm debris in Morganton, North Carolina. Total damage reached $22.3 million, primarily in southwestern Alabama. Records and retirement On October 7, the National Weather Service stated that Hurricane Nate had broken the record for the fastest forward motion by a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico, with a speed of . This top forward motion occurred during a 12-hour period on Saturday, October 7, as Nate sped northward towards the Gulf Coast. On April 11, 2018, due to the storm's significant impacts in Costa Rica, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Nate from its rotating lists of names, and it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane. It will be replaced with Nigel for the 2023 season.

It aired on November 14, 2017, on the cable network FX. The episode was written by Tim Minear, and directed by Jennifer Lynch. Plot 2017 Kai assembles a meeting, during which he informs his devotees that the \\"night of a thousand Sharon Tates\\" has been downgraded to one hundred, though he remains adamant that there will still be enough public outrage to further his political ascent. The assembled devotees practice their kills on watermelons. Later, Beverly confides to Ally that she originally intended to be the last person alive, before begging Ally to kill her; Ally refuses. Kai, who has become increasingly paranoid over Speedwagon's disappearance, is shown by Ally the recording device she found two days earlier. She explains that she killed Speedwagon after learning he was a police informant that infiltrated the cult in order to avoid drug charges. Ally also relays that Winter was innocent the whole time, while simultaneously encouraging Kai to channel his rage and finish the plan in her memory. However, on the night that the killings are set to occur, Ally betrays Kai by allowing the FBI to storm the inner sanctum. She and Beverly are captured while Kai is led out, who then realizes that Ally set him up. 2018 Eleven months later, an incarcerated Kai manipulates guard Gloria Whitmore and cellmates Croutchy and Trevor into helping him escape from prison. Meanwhile, Ally has become a celebrity since her escape and is running for the Senate seat that Kai had intended to campaign for. She is visited by Beverly, who confesses that she fears possible retaliation from Kai, but Ally convinces her otherwise. Ally explains that the FBI approached her while she was committed, offering her immunity in exchange for Kai. Ally invites Beverly, who is no longer a reporter and now works as a bartender, to Oz's birthday party the following weekend. At the party, Ally receives a collect phone call from Kai, who swears vengeance against her. Later, Ally shows Beverly her campaign advertisement and reveals that she will enter the Senate on a mission to dismantle the two-party system. Beverly reports that focus groups have responded favorably to Ally as a candidate, though she is still trailing in the polls as she is not seen as experienced or strong. Ally scoffs, saying \\"lack of experience\\" is code for a being afraid of a strong woman. She emphasizes that she will show her strength in her upcoming debate with Senator Jackson. At the debate, Ally holds her own against Jackson until Kai arrives. Armed with a gun provided by Gloria, he proceeds to take credit for Ally's success and rant that women should learn their place. However, when he attempts to kill Ally, the gun is revealed to be empty and Gloria's true allegiance to Ally is exposed. Ally then taunts Kai, saying that a \\"nasty woman\\" is more dangerous than a \\"humiliated man\\", shortly before Beverly shoots Kai through the head from behind. Preliminary results for the election show that Ally wins an overwhelming majority of the vote, likely securing her victory. Later, Ally is seen putting Oz to bed. She then dons a SCUM cloak before departing into the night to attend a meeting with powerful women who want to change the system. Reception \\"Great Again\\" was watched by 1.97 million people during its original broadcast, and gained a 1.0 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49. The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, \\"Great Again\\" holds a 67% approval rating, based on 18 reviews with an average rating of 7.36 out of 10. Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode a 4 out of 5, saying \\"[the episode] is as subtly effective as the season has been peripherally horrific. Real life settings, secret organizations, crypto-SuperPACs and brown shirted thugs pick at the scabs of deep-seated conspiratorial paranoia. Politicians are every bit as scary as sad clowns and serial killers, and they have the power to affect more lives. That's pretty frightening, and fear is trust. But the season ends on a reassuring note for horror fans as we see Ally fitting herself in the cloak of the cult she now leads.\\" Kat Rosenfield from Entertainment Weekly gave the episode an A. She particularly enjoyed the last confrontation between Ally and Kai, saying it was what \\"we need and deserve\\". She also praised Kai's death scene, commenting that it was about \\"as satisfying an act of vengeance as we‚Äôve gotten on this series, ever.\\" Finally, even if she mentioned that the end would have been fine without it, she appreciated the final twist of the episode. Vulture's Brian Moylan gave the episode a 4 out of 5, with a positive review, commenting \\"This rather strong season was different, and so it necessitated a different kind of ending. It‚Äôs less of a frightfest than it is a fantasy.\\" Despite thinking that the shape of the episode was \\"strangely convoluted\\", he particularly enjoyed Paulson's performance and so the character of Ally, her development and her dynamic with Adina Porter's Beverly. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a 5.8 out of 10, with a mixed to negative review. He said \\"Cult continued with Kai's boring endgame misogyny, that only really started for real last week, and turned everything into a screaming showdown between him and Ally as they verbally volleyed tired memes and platitudes, undercutting some of the more interesting ideas that the season began with. Revenge is always sweet, but Kai had to go nuts and lose a lot of his edge, becoming quite boring in the process, in order to lose all he'd built up.\\" References External links * American Horror Story: Cult episodes ","title":"Great Again (American Horror Story)"},{"id":"55446983","text":"Dr Robert Lyell Mitchell FRSE FRSC (3 June 1910-7 February 1982) was a 20th- century Scottish chemist and mountaineer.

Published in 2017, Pachinko is an epic historical novel following a Korean family who eventually immigrates to Japan, The character-driven tale features a large ensemble of characters who become subjected to issues of racism and stereotypes, among other events with historical origins in the 20th-century Korean experiences with Japan. Pachinko was a 2017 finalist for the National Book Award for fiction. Apple Inc.'s streaming service Apple TV+ has purchased the rights for a television adaptation of the novel. Overview The novel takes place over the course of three books: Book I Gohyang/Hometown, Book II Motherland, and Book III Pachinko. *Book I begins with the story of Sunja's father, Hoonie and ends with Noa's birth. *Book II begins with Baek Isak's incarceration and ends with Sunja's search of Koh Hansu. *Book III begins with Noa's new beginnings in Nagano and ends with Sunja's reflections upon everything that has happened to her. Plot In 1883, in the little island fishing village of Yeongdo, which is a ferry ride from Busan, an aging fisherman and his wife take in lodgers to make a little more money. They have three sons, but only one, Hoonie, with a cleft lip and twisted foot, survives to adulthood. Because of his deformities, Hoonie is considered ineligible for marriage. When he is 27, Japan annexes Korea and many families are left destitute and lacking food. Due to their prudent habits, Hoonie's family's situation is comparatively more stable, and a matchmaker arranges a marriage between Hoonie and Yangjin, the daughter of a poor farmer who had lost everything in the colonized land. Hoonie and Yangjin eventually take over the lodging house. In the mid 1910s, Yangjin and Hoonie have a daughter named Sunja. After her thirteenth birthday, she is raised solely by her mother Yangjin, her father Hoonie dying from tuberculosis. When Sunja is sixteen, she is pursued by a wealthy fishbroker, Koh Hansu. Sunja becomes pregnant, after which Hansu reveals that he is already married but intends to keep her as his mistress. Ashamed, Sunja reveals the truth to her mother, who eventually confesses it to one of their lodgers, a Christian minister suffering from tuberculosis. Baek Isak, the minister, believes he will die soon due to his many illnesses, and decides to marry Sunja to give her child a name and to give meaning to his life. Sunja agrees to the plan and marries Isak, traveling with him to Osaka to live with Isak's brother and his wife. In Osaka, Sunja is shocked to learn that Koreans are treated poorly and are forced to live in a small ghetto and are only hired for menial jobs. Sunja's brother-in-law, Yoseb, insists on supporting the entire household on his own salary, but Sunja and her sister-in-law Kyunghee come to learn he is in heavy debt due to paying for Sunja and Isak's passage to Osaka. To pay for the cost, Sunja sells a watch given to her by Hansu. As time goes on, Sunja gives birth to her son Noa and then to a second son she conceives with Isak, Mozasu. While Noa physically resembles Hansu, he is similar in personality to Isak, and seeks a quiet life of learning, reading and academia. Shortly after Mozasu is born, Isak is taken prisoner when a member of his church is caught reciting the Lord's Prayer when they were supposed to be worshiping the emperor. Despite Yoseb's resistance, Sunja begins to work in the market, selling kimchi that she and Kyunghee make. Their small business goes well, but as Japan enters the Second World War and ingredients grow scarce, they struggle to make money. Sunja is eventually approached by the owner of a restaurant, Kim Changho, who pays her and Kyunghee to make kimchi in his restaurant, providing them with financial security. A dying Isak is eventually released from prison, and he is able to briefly reunite with his family. A few years later, on the eve of the restaurant's closure, Sunja is approached by Hansu, who reveals that he is the actual owner of the restaurant and has been manipulating her family for years, having tracked Sunja down after she sold her watch. He arranges for her to spend the rest of the war in the countryside with Kyunghee and her children, and for Yoseb to wait the rest of the war out working at a factory in Nagasaki. During her time at the farm, Hansu also reunites Sunja with her mother, Yangjin, and eventually returns a permanently crippled Yoseb to the family after he is horrifically burned during the bombings. The Baek family eventually return to Osaka where Noa and Mozasu resume their studies. The family continues to struggle in spite of Hansu's help. Though they long to return to the North of Korea, where Kyunghee has family, Hansu warns them not to. Noa succeeds in passing the entrance exams for Waseda University. Despite Sunja's resistance, Hansu pays for Noa's entire university education, pretending it is simply because as an older Korean man he feels responsible for helping the younger generation. Meanwhile, Mozasu drops out of school and goes to work for Goro, a man who runs Pachinko parlors. Mozasu eventually meets and falls in love with a Korean seamstress, Yumi, who dreams of moving to America. The two marry and have a son, Solomon. Yumi later dies in a car accident, leaving Mozasu to raise their son on his own. Noa, who has continued his studies and looks up to Hansu as a mentor, accidentally discovers he is his father and learns of his ties to the yakuza. Ashamed of his true heritage and being linked to corrupt blood, he drops out of university and moves to Nagano, intending to work off his debt to Hansu and rid himself of his shameful heritage. He becomes a bookkeeper for a racist Pachinko owner who won't hire Koreans and lives undercover using his Japanese name, Nobuo, eventually marrying a Japanese woman and having four children. After having abandoned his family and living sixteen years under a false identity, Noa is tracked down by Hansu at the request of Sunja. Though Hansu warns Sunja not to immediately approach Noa, Sunja refuses to listen to his warnings and begs Noa to reunite with her and the rest of the family. After promising to do so, he commits suicide. In the meantime, Mozasu has become an extremely wealthy man, owning his own Pachinko parlors and taking on a Japanese girlfriend, Etsuko, who refuses to marry him. Hana, Etsuko's troubled teenage daughter from her previous marriage, arrives to stay with the family after learning she is pregnant, later having an abortion. Hana is drawn to Solomon's innocence and they begin a sexual relationship; he quickly falls in love with her, giving her large sums of money when asked, which she uses to run away to Tokyo. Years later, Solomon, now attending college in New York and dating a Korean-American woman named Phoebe, receives a call from a drunken Hana in Roppongi. He relays the information to Etsuko and Mozasu, who manage to locate her. After graduating college, Solomon takes a job at a British bank and moves back to Japan with Phoebe. His first major client project involves convincing an elderly Korean woman to sell her land in order to clear way for the construction of a golf resort, which he accomplishes by calling in a favor from his father's friend Goro. When the woman dies of natural causes soon after, Solomon's employers claim the deal will attract negative publicity and fire him, citing his father's connections to Pachinko and implying that the woman was murdered by a hit. With newfound resolve and a clearer outlook on life, Solomon breaks up with Phoebe, goes to work for his father's business, and makes amends with a dying Hana in the hospital. Now an elderly woman, Sunja visits Isak's grave and reflects on her life. She finds out from the cemetery groundskeeper that despite the shame Noa felt for his family, Noa had been visiting Isak's grave longer after Noa ceased contact with his family and started a new life in Japan. This gives Sunja the closure and reassurance she needs, and she buries a photo of Noa beside Isak's grave.

Themes  Themes in Pachinko include racism, stereotypes, power, and the game pachinko. One of Koh Hansu and Sunja's first interactions involves young Japanese boys making fun of Sunja for being Korean, speaking to the discrimination that Koreans experienced within their own borders. This is a recurring theme throughout the book, especially present in the treatment of Koreans in Japanese schools, such as Mozasu's experiences with bullying. Power is another main theme. Koh Hansu is the main exhibitor of power, using his influence to directly affect Sunja's life throughout the novel. Through this power, Sunja's family is able to survive and thrive while other Koreans around them struggle to support themselves, living in the same neighborhood but in much worse conditions. Through Hansu's influence, Sunja was deeply moved, but also conflictingly aggravated, as she thought she had successfully rid her life of Koh Hansu. Pachinko is one of the themes directly addressed in the novel. Many times, the novel states that Koreans in Japan are often associated with the pachinko business. Lee has said that the novel's title, which was originally set to be Motherland, was changed to Pachinko when, in her interviews, Koreans seemed to relate back to the pachinko business.  Historical Context  Pachinko takes place between the years of 1910 and 1989, a period that included the Japanese occupation of Korea and World War II. As a historical novel, these events play a central role in Pachinko, influencing the characters' decisions like Sunja's moving to Japan. In an interview with Min Jin Lee, she references that the history of Korean-Japanese relationships are one of the most obvious displays of issues surrounding racism and exclusion outside the norms of the west.

Rempel's reporting about Colombian drug lords for the Los Angeles Times and in his book At the Devil‚Äôs Table have led to English and Spanish language television productions. He served as a story consultant for season 3 of the Netflix TV series Narcos (2017). The 80-episode telenovela En la Boca del Lobo (Sony-Telest, 2014) was based on the Spanish version of his book. Rempel's latest book, released by Dey Street and HarperCollins in January 2018, was The Gambler: How Penniless Dropout Kirk Kerkorian Became the Greatest Deal Maker in Capitalist History. For most of his 40-year newspaper career, Rempel was an investigative reporter and editor at the Los Angeles Times. In 2015, he toured Ukraine and the Republic of Georgia on a U.S. State Department-sponsored mission to advocate the value of aggressive investigative reporting in those young democracies.  Early life and education  Rempel was born in Palmer, the Territory of Alaska, a grandson of Matanuska Valley homesteaders from Michigan and Russia. When he was 10 years old, his family moved to California and continued to move frequently. His father was a door- to-door vacuum cleaner salesman, among other product lines. He attended public schools in Reedley, Fresno, Merced, Stockton, Oakland, El Monte and, finally, Whittier where he graduated from Richard Nixon's alma mater ‚Äì Whittier High School. His first paid writing job was as a sports stringer for the Whittier Daily News that paid 15 cents per column inch of his published stories. He attended Pepperdine College on a journalism scholarship. He graduated with a BA degree in 1969 and went to work for the South Bay Daily Breeze in Torrance, California. Three years later he joined the Los Angeles Times.  Career   Journalism Career  Rempel's 36-year newspaper career with the Los Angeles Times began covering Southern California suburbs where his stories about fraudulent remodeling contractors led to state consumer protection legislation. A stint covering the waterfront led to a series of investigative stories about oil tanker safety. Audubon Magazine published a cover story based on his first-person account sailing aboard the Arco Juneau from Alaska to California, a decade before the disastrous grounding of the Exxon Valdez in Prince William Sound. Rempel joined the newspaper's national staff in 1980 as a Midwest correspondent based in Chicago. As an investigative reporter assigned to the paper's financial staff, he was part of a team that exposed international arms and technology smuggling schemes that eventually became the Iran-Contra affair. Investigating the corrupt Ferdinand Marcos regime in the Philippines, he obtained then-secret Marcos diaries. Rempel's reporting from Arkansas in 1992 produced a series of exclusive stories about Bill Clinton that eventually became the Troopergate scandal in 1993. His role as a reporter and editor delving into terrorism threats led to exclusive reports about Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda organization two years before the 9/11 attacks. Among other major investigative projects was a report on widespread conflicts of interest among Las Vegas judges that resulted in statewide reforms. Rempel's work has also appeared in the International Herald Tribune, CNN.com and the Huffington Post. He has been a guest on various television news shows, including ABC‚Äôs Nightline, NBC‚Äôs Today, CNN‚Äôs Reliable Sources, Entertainment Tonight and Hardball With Chris Matthews.  Non-fiction Work  His most recent book, ‚ÄúThe Gambler,\\" debuted as a national bestseller. It is a narrative biography of Kirk Kerkorian, the media-shy billionaire and American business giant who transformed modern Hollywood and Las Vegas. Rempel's first book, Delusions of a Dictator ‚Äì The Mind of Marcos as Revealed in His Secret Diaries, (Little Brown, 1993), chronicled the former president's rise to dictatorial power. It was revised and updated as an eBook titled Diary of a Dictator ‚Äì Ferdinand & Imelda: The Last Days of Camelot, (Smashwords, 2015). His second book, At the Devil‚Äôs Table ‚Äì The Untold Story of the Insider Who Brought Down the Cali Cartel. (Random House, 2011) was based on secret contacts spanning nearly a decade with a former cartel chief of security under federal witness protection. The book has since been translated into Spanish as En la Boca del Lobo (In the Jaws of the Wolf), Portuguese, Polish, Dutch and (soon) Italian. His story was featured in a public radio broadcast of This American Life (2012).  Personal life  Covering the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, he met Barbara Hyde Pierce, a CBS News producer from Saratoga Springs, New York. Four years later they were married in the same log church in Palmer, Alaska, where his mother and father were wed in 1946. He has three grown children and two grandchildren. The couple lives in Los Angeles.

Published in 1887 by Robert Clarke & Company, Cincinnati, Ohio, the 75 page printed volume, written in Chariton, Iowa, was dedicated to Manning's mother, Mrs. Adeline Hensham Wilson. The work was a poem in five parts: I. \\"The Glamour of Youth\\"; II. \\"Song of the Soul\\"; III. \\"Lost Love\\"; IV. \\"May glides Onward into June \\"; V. \\"The Doubter \\". Plot The Passion of Life is the story of two lives, in their separate attraction and repulsion, told in smooth verse. The reader picks out the story from the poems, and has no great fault to find with it as a study of self- restraint. It is when he comes to inquire into the poetry of the thing that he begins at once to doubt. Critical reception According to the Masonic Voice Review (1887), the work was a well-woven story on the topics of heart and love; constancy and faith; as well as waiting and reward. While it pursued a somewhat \\"beaten path\\", it was written with grace in a \\"weird\\", attractive tone, and chaste rhythm. The author was constant to her purpose, and accomplished her task with well-sustained strength and beauty. The National Republican (1891) said that it was \\"A high attamment, a triumph of art. A poem in five parts, ... interesting and true throughout, often deeply thoughtful, often eloquent, ever sweet, tender, pure and beautiful, . . . showing the extraordinary power of the poet, and must introduce her favorably to exalted souls.\\" References Bibliography  American poems 1887 books 1887 poems Health in Iowa Literature by women ","title":"The passion of life"},{"id":"55447239","text":"World Ballet Day is an annual celebration of ballet held since 2014 in the first week of October.

His work blurred the boundaries between performance art, theatre, and fashion. Gallo performed outside the luxury stores and hotels on Fifth Avenue wearing costumes that referenced glamour, sadomasochism, and high fashion. His street performances challenged mainstream conceptions of identity, masculinity, and sexuality. He was known as ‚ÄúLemon Boy\\" for his use of lemons as props. Early life Gallo was born in the Kensington section of Brooklyn New York. He studied advertising, theater, and art studio at Pratt Institute from 1964-1968. While at Pratt he became close friends with fellow student Robert Wilson and performed in several of his early productions including The King of Spain (1969), The Life and Times of Sigmund Freud (1969), Deafman Glance (1970) and The Life and Times of Joseph Stalin (1973). Career Beginning in 1968, while still a student at Pratt, Gallo enlisted the help of several peers, including Alan Sigman and Robert Ippolito, to assist him in staging public performances. Many of the earliest performances were held at Grand Army Plaza in Manhattan. Often these performances would be interrupted by the police, which usually ended with a summons or arrest for not having a permit for exhibition.Summons no. K876042 Criminal Court of the City of New York. Issued 7.19.69 for holding exhibition without a park permit at Sherman Square on 59th Street. On one occasion, after refusing to break character when approached by the police, he was detained and spent several days in Bellevue Hospital.Ippolito, Robert. Personal Interview. 4 September 2017 Gallo described the typical arc of his performances: ‚ÄúThe crowd would build up and then the traffic would slow to see what was happening. Then the police would show up. When I heard the siren I knew the show was over. It was a good ending.‚Äùas recalled by Gallo in text on back of photograph Other performance locations included: Van Cleef & Arpels, Harry Winston, Tiffany & Co., Peck & Peck, and the steps and forecourt of the main branch of the New York Public Library. Around this same time (1971-1972) Gallo could often be found in the back room of Max's Kansas City amongst other habitu√©s of the New York City art scene, including Warhol superstars Holly Woodlawn and Candy Darling, as well as influential writers such as Rene Ricard, and Glenn O'Brien.Perich, Anton. Personal Interview 9 October 2017 In 1973, Gallo was invited to headline his original theatrical production of Squalls for the International Festival Mondial du Th√©√¢tre in Nancy France. Prior to the opening, hundreds of posters promoting the show were either defaced by graffiti or torn down. This vandalism foreshadowed the raucous crowds that attended the actual performances. One member of the crowd, theater critic and NYU Drama Professor Michael Kirby, described Squalls as the only theatrical event where he had ever witnessed an ‚Äúovert confrontation by the bourgeoisie‚Äù and ‚Äúaccording to the model of Ubu Roi‚Ä¶the only avant-garde performance [he had] ever seen.‚Äù After he returned from France, Gallo performed in Robert Wilson's The Life and Times of Joseph Stalin, which premiered on December 14, 1973 at the Opera House of the Brooklyn Academy of Music in Brooklyn, New York. After The Life and Times of Joseph Stalin, he discontinued working in theatre or performing on the streets. From 1974 though 1978, he became more immersed in the New York City fashion scene and began to frequent Studio 54 where he resumed his performance art. While there, he was photographed by several by Allan Tannenbaum, Anton Perich, Dustin Pittman and Felice Quinto. In 1978, he participated in Robert Wilson's Video 50. In 1979, he returned to theater when he was selected to perform his original production, Tip of the Iceberg / Suspect on Black Coal at the 1979 Pan American Games in San Juan Puerto Rico. Each of these performances culminated in Gallo floating across the stage on a 20 foot long fork, while below, the classically-trained vocalist Asha Puthli sang Ave Maria.Waldman, Gloria (1979). V Theatre Encounter / Spectacle and Controversy: Special to El Nuevo Dia The following year, he staged A Killer's Loose But Nobody's Talking with Sheryl Sutton at The Kitchen, a performing arts theater in New York City. Later years and death In the winter of 1982, Gallo suffered a stroke in the stairwell outside his apartment on the Upper East Side. As a result, he was partially disabled and unable to continue performing.Raymond, Alan.

Wanda has been included in the list of the 7 most trailblazing women in science by the BBC .  Early life  D√≠az-Merced was born in Gurabo, a small remote town in Puerto Rico. Both Diaz-Merced and her sister had physical disabilities, and had to learn to overcome the challenges that brings. As children, the two of them would pretend to fly a space craft and explore other galaxies. In middle school she entered the school science fair where she won second place. This was a turning point for her as this made her realize that pursuing a career in science was something that might be attainable. D√≠az-Merced lost her sight in her early 20s and found new ways to study stellar radiation without relying on her vision. She realized that she could use her ears to detect patterns in stellar radio data that could potentially be obscured in visual and graphical representation.  Education  D√≠az-Merced attended Mat√≠as Gonz√°lez Garc√≠a Middle School and Dra. Conchita Cuevas High School in Gurabo, Puerto Rico. She then went on to study physics at the University of Puerto Rico. She received an internship with the Robert Candey at NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center in Maryland, USA after she finished her undergraduate degree. She went on to receive a doctorate in computer science from the University of Glasgow in 2013, where she studied space data analysis. She was then accepted as a post-doctoral fellow at the South African Astronomical Observatory in Cape Town and Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.  Scientific career  In 2020, D√≠az-Merced accepted a simultaneous collaboration with the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and the European Gravitational Observatory proposal REINFORCE. Before this, she worked at the National Astronomical Observatory Japan (NAOJ) , and the South African observatory's Office of Astronomy for Development (OAD).

It was originally written in Spanish and was published by Random House Mondadori on 22 September 2007, and Random House Inc. of New York on 4 October 2007. The book describes the five years-long (1982-1987) romantic relationship of the author with Pablo Escobar, head of the Medellin cartel, and it became instantly the #1 bestseller in Colombia, Latin America, and the Hispanic market in the United States. It has been translated to sixteen languages, and inspired the film Loving Pablo (2017). Vallejo's memoir is also her personal intimate biography of Pablo Escobar; a moving and terrible love story with many facets, but also a historical document about Colombian tragedies and political corruption in the second part of the 20th century. Plot The book is divided in an introduction and three parts: The Days of Innocence and Dreams; The Days of Splendor and Terror; and The Days of Absence and Silence. In the Introduction, Virginia Vallejo describes her departure from Colombia on 18 July 2006 in a special flight of the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), after she has accused a former senator and minister of justice, Alberto Santofimio, of instigating the assassination of a former presidential candidate, Luis Carlos Galan, and after she had offered her cooperation to the Department of Justice in ongoing high-profile criminal cases. The story begins with the joy and passion of two new lovers -Pablo, an ambitious rookie politician from humble origins, and Virginia, a socialite and media personality, both 32 years old- and continues with the evolution of their relationship and Escobar's personality during his war against the extradition treaty between Colombia and the United States, and the terrorist activities of him and the Medellin cartel in their last years. Like a snowball, Vallejo describes the birth and boom of the cocaine industry that turned her lover into a billionaire, thanks to the cooperation of leading politicians; the origins of the Colombian rebel organizations, and the paramilitary squads founded by Escobar and his partners; the assassinations of the justice minister Rodrigo Lara in 1984, and the siege of the Palace of Justice in 1985; the suffering of the journalist after she had ended her relationship with the drug kingpin in 1987, and her cooperation with the anti drug German agency BKA in 1988; the Cuban connection, and the bombing of an airplane with 110 people on board in 1989 (Avianca Flight 203); the assassination of Luis Carlos Gal√°n, and three more presidential candidates; the origins of Escobar's war against the Cali cartel and the Colombian state, followed by the era of narcoterrorism from 1988 to 1993; the coalition of enforcement agencies and Escobar's enemies involved in his hunt; and, finally, the worldwide reaction to the death of the Number One Enemy of the United States on 2 December 1993. Reaction The release of the book created a political scandal in Latin America and the Hispanic television channels in the US, due to Vallejo's description of the relationship of Pablo Escobar and the Medellin and Cali cartels with several presidents - like Alvaro Uribe, Alfonso L√≥pez and Ernesto Samper - and Colombian enforcement agencies. Thanks to Vallejo's revelations, the Colombian government reopened the so-called \\"cases of the century\\": the siege of the Palace of Justice, followed by a massacre of more than 100 people, including eleven Supreme Court Justices, committed by the army; and the assassination of Luis Carlos Galan in 1989. Vallejo's book was commented on by The New York Times and El Pa√≠s of Madrid, among hundreds of media worldwide. Also, by Colombian, Venezuelan and Ecuadorian presidents, a former American ambassador to Bogota, human rights organizations, and the rebel FARC. In 2008 and 2009, president Rafael Correa of Ecuador showed \\"Amando a Pablo, odiando a Escobar\\" on television. Political asylum to the author On 3 June 2010, the United States of America granted political asylum to the Colombian author under the precepts of the American Constitution, the Geneva Convention Against Torture, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The decision of the judge was based on Virginia Vallejo's career of decades as a journalist; her testimonies under oath in historic criminal cases that resulted in lengthy convictions; her description of atrocities and massacres in her book and in the court; the threats that she had received from members of the Colombian Government and the paramilitary; and the brutal character assassination of the journalist in media owned by presidential families or their powerful associates, all of them documented in hundreds of pages of evidence and later erased from the Internet.

Radcliffe was the third son of John Radcliffe, a merchant trading with Turkey and his wife Anne Alcock, daughter of Lawrence Alcock of Trotton Place, Sussex. He was educated at Eton College from 1754 to 1755. He married Lady Frances Howard, daughter of Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle on 14 April1768. When they became engaged, George Selwyn wrote about Radcliffe to Lord Carlisle on 12 January 1768 ‚ÄúHe is very well spoke of, et le nom est assez beau‚Äù. Carlisle wrote to Selwyn, from Rome on 18 June 1768 ‚ÄúEverybody gives Mr. R. such a good character.‚Äù The Radcliffes were an old gentry family who were seated at Hitchin Priory from the sixteenth century.

The sculpture is a life-size full-length female figure rendered in marble. Completed in 1905, Lady Macbeth is one of Ney's last works and was regarded by the artist as her masterpiece. It is housed in Washington, D.C. in the Luce Foundation Center for American Art at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, which acquired the piece in 1998. History Ney began sculpting Lady Macbeth in 1903, shortly after she completed the design of her memorial statue of Albert Sidney Johnston. Unlike Ney's other major contemporary works, the statue was not made in response to any commission or for any particular buyer. She developed the piece in her Austin, Texas studio, Formosa (now the Elisabet Ney Museum), where the plaster model is still on display. Ney completed the statue in 1905, two years before her death; it proved to be her last major work. Design and interpretation The sculpture interprets the sleepwalking scene in act 5, scene 1 of Shakespeare's tragedy Macbeth. Lady Macbeth is depicted sleepwalking barefoot in a flowing nightgown, her eyes half closed, with her left arm reaching across her body to clutch her right hand. Her face is uplifted and turned away from her clenched hands; her facial expression is pained, and her body is twisted by the pose of the head and arms. The piece stands out among Ney's works, most of which were portraits of living persons or historical figures; she produced few other works on fictitious or allegorical subjects. With its exploration of subjective emotion, this work also represents a shift toward romanticism and away from the neoclassical sculpture more characteristic of Ney's work generally. Lady Macbeth has been understood both as a portrayal of a fictional character and as a self-portrait; the figure's face resembles the artist's own, and Ney wrote in 1903 that the piece was a result and expression of her own feelings of \\"cruel disappointment\\" in life. The statue's evocation of grief has been interpreted as a reference to a frustrated romance earlier in Ney's life (perhaps with King Ludwig II of Bavaria), to her participation in political intrigues in 1860s Germany, as well as to her estrangement from her son.

Concerned over policies that discuss disabilities or promote accessibility and independence, Winberg began writing for the Ontario Federation for Cerebral Palsy and eventually became the first disabled person to serve as president of the organization. In the 1980s, she approached the Toronto Sun about the lack of media coverage on disability issues and they hired her to write a weekly column. She was honored with the King Clancy Award and was inducted into the Terry Fox Hall of Fame by the Canadian Foundation for Physically Disabled Persons and a recipient of the Order of Canada. Early life Mona Fleur Winberg was born on 27 January 1932 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada to Sarah (n√©e Sadie Keller) and Max Winberg. She was the fourth and final child in the family. Her father, a farmer, was born in Poland and her mother, a telephone operator, was born in Hungary. Both were Jewish. Soon after birth, Winberg was diagnosed with athetoid cerebral palsy and her parents were encouraged to place her in an institution. Her mother refused and raised her at home and though Winberg had mobility problems and limited speech and hearing, she attended Wellesley Orthopaedic School. Her father died in 1944, requiring her mother to take a job in the office of the Young Men's Hebrew Association. Her widowed maternal grandmother, Fannie (n√©e Weis) Keller, moved in with the family to help raise the children. After completing eighth grade, Winberg was refused entry to high school, until Central Commerce High School agreed to allow her to audit classes part-time, as long as she did not appear on the official school roster. Completing her high school studies in 1952, she enrolled in journalism courses through the extension program of the University of Toronto, which she completed in 1954. Career That same year, Winberg began her career working as a payroll clerk for Corbrook Sheltered Workshop, a recreational center and supervised work center for adults with cerebral palsy. She remained there for fourteen years. At the beginning of the 1960s, Winberg began contributing articles to the Ontario Federation for Cerebral Palsy's newsletter. In 1972, she became the first disabled person to serve as president of the organization. In the mid-1970s, she worked as the editor of Contact Magazine and became known for her advocacy of self-reliant living for the disabled through her many speaking engagements throughout the country. By the 1980s, she was advocating before the Canadian Parliament for equal rights for the disabled community and pressing for improved accessibility to public facilities. Because little mainstream media coverage was devoted to disability issues, Winberg contacted the Toronto Sun in 1986 and proposed writing a weekly column. The newspaper accepted her proposal and her column Disabled Today appeared in the Sunday edition of the paper for the next decade. In 1988, she was honored for her column when the Canadian Foundation for Physically Disabled Persons bestowed the King Clancy Award upon her. In 1995, she was inducted into the Canadian Disability Hall of Fame. Her last Disabled Today column was written in 1999, and in 2002, she was awarded the Order of Canada by Governor General Adrienne Clarkson. She spent the next several years working on a compilation that would bring together the articles she had published in Disabled Today and her life story.

Located at the junction of New Boston and Greenfield Roads are the town's 1846 Greek Revival town hall and academy building, a former academic dormitory building, and the town's historic common, which includes a rare example of an early 20th-century platform scale. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. Description and history The town of Francestown was settled in the late 1740s, and was incorporated in 1772. In that year John Fisher gave the town of land for use as a town common and civic center. The northern part of this land was dedicated for the town cemetery and for its first meetinghouse, which was used for both civic and religious functions. The southern portion remained open land until 1846, when the town hall and academy building was built. This structure has seen a wide variety of civic uses over the years, including as town hall, school (these functions overlapping for many years), and post office, but has retained a great many original features despite its varied uses. Adjacent to this building is one known locally as \\"The Beehive\\", which was built as a dormitory for students at the academy. The platform scale The open area of the common between the meetinghouse and town hall has been somewhat encroached upon by road widening projects, and a small triangular section has been isolated from its bulk. On this section are found a granite watering trough, installed in 1889, and the surviving elements of a public platform scale, installed in 1908. The scales, whose working elements were provided by the Fairbanks Company, were installed by the town in collaboration with a local hotelier, who probably also acted as a hay merchant. The town purchased the scales outright in 1923.

Origins of the name  The original name of the village is Dovhe (ukr. dovhe - eng. long). The word mostyshche comes from the location of the village next to the bridge across the Kropyvnyk river. (ukr. mostyshche - eng. big bridge)  History   Establishment  The village was founded in1551. The first of its inhabitants were seven men with their families: Andriy Kravtsovych, Marko Lytvyn, Ivan Popovych, Yats'ko Popovych, Ivan Stankovych, Dan'ko Derkachovych. While in 1564 only 7 families lived in Mostyshche, since 1670 there were already 45 peasant farms. thumb According to the assumption—ñ of the old-timers of the village, Dovhe village could be located to the west of the current Mostyshche village. The today's landscape of people's plots still has the marks of previous land division in Dovhe village. Excavations of local residents showed the presence of antiques, but there is a need for archaeological excavations. According to the local historians, the village was burnt by tatars and rebuild later, and at the territory of the current woodshed there were fields.  Renaissance  After the 1848 revolution and abolition of serfdom the land plots and the forest in the village were divided between the peasants. The part of the land the community left undivided for community use. A polonyna next to the village Duba was also in the ownership of the community, but it was sold in 1870 when the church was being built. In 1880 there were 977 residents of the village and 9 at the surrounding area (majority - Greek Catholic, 20 - Roman Catholics). There were local Greek CatholicParish and permanent one-class school. A manuscript of the ancient Ukrainian drama \\"Povist' o zburenni pekla\\" (eng. The tale of the perturbation of hell) by Ivan Franko was found in the village. In 1899-1914 a public courtyard with a tavern was leased by the community. In 1902 the community of the village built a school, that works till today. In 1898 a branch of the Prosvita Society was opened in Mostyshche to oppose russophile policy of the local prist Arsen Avdykovsky. In 1915 after the return of the Austrian troops several people were accused to be Moscowphiles and sent to the concentration camp Talergof. Some families run away from the enemy with russian troops, however came back after the war was over.  War milestones  In the First and Second World Wars, the road through the village became the main way for the movement of troops between Kalush and Stryj. Limited number of men managed to enter the Legion of Ukrainian Sich Riflemen. It was also held a partial mobilization of the rest population to the Austrian troops, many of them were killed or taken prisoner. After the occupation of Galicia by Russian troops, the army headquarters were placed in the school, a field radio station was set up nearby. The Tsar's brother - Mikhail - served in the headquarters, he was a contact person on the issues of the looting by Russian soldiers. After the return of the Austro-Hungarian troops, full mobilization was carried out, including even those who returned from captivity. Mobilized troops were sent mostly on the Italian front, where in the fierce battles majority died. On 1st of November 1919 Ukrainians declared the creation of their own state. The next day Polish troops started their aggression against it. Mostyshche residents went into the ranks of Ukrainian Galician Army, however they could not save the independence.  Polish occupation  After the West Ukrainian People's Republic was occupied by polish troops, the peasants unified to defend their interests in Prosvita and Zlahoda cooperative. A dairy and creamery were opened, and a fire brigade was formed (for the work of fire brigade a pump and other equipment was bought). The community also bought \\"Trier\\" grain cleaning machine, that was withdrawn by the communists in 1950s for the collective farm. A summer kindergarten functioned in the village until 1939. In 1920s, a telephone line was established to Verhnya village through the Mostyshche village. Since 1 of August 1934 Mostyshche was included into Verkhnya gmina (gmina - administrative unit of the occupied by Poland territories). In 1920-1930s many Mostyshche residents worked on the construction of potash production in Kalush and bypass channel of Sivka river bypassing Kalush (between Mostyshche and Kalush). In 1938 the People's House was built by the community. Residents of the village covered the roof of the church with galvanized tin-plate, replaced the wooden crosses. In 1939 there were 1600 residents in the village (1550 Ukrainians, 5 Poles, 30 residents of latin rite (Poles and Ukrainians), 5 Jews, and 10 other nationalities).  Soviet and German occupation  In 1940 the USSR authorities built an airfield on the outskirts of the village (from that time this place is called the \\"Base\\"). The airfield was destroyed by German aviation on June 22, 1941. In 1942 the community built a symbolic grave for the fighters for the freedom of Ukraine, which in 1950 was blown up by the NKVD. Most of the village was burned down in 1945. On October 21, 1947, seven families were evicted to Siberia and Kazakhstan for the support of the Ukrainian movement, and their homes were destroyed. Even later on some Mostyshche residents were evicted to Syberia. In 1950s the USSR authorities identified the village as unpromising and forbidden to build new houses, demolished buildings and evicted residents from the separate parts of the village. The bridges and roads were not repaired. By 1972, the village was subordinated to the Kalush City Council, between 1972 and 1991 - to the Kopanky village council.  New time  In 1989 the gasification of the village was carried out, and the road was asphalted. A village council was formed in 1990. In 1994 a new symbolic grave for the fighters for the freedom of Ukraine was erected. A monument to Taras Shevchenkko was built in 1996 on public donations. Many efforts for this were made by the artist and a teacher Mykhaylo Tymchyshyn, who was the author of the bust. In the village buried a Ukrainian soldier Yuri Pukish, killed on 08/29/2015 near the city of Schastya in Lugansk (within the in the Russian- Ukrainian War).  Church  For the first time the church of St. Nicholas is mentioned in 1684 with no indication of the date of construction. Church In the minutes of Lviv and Halych-Kamianets' dioceses from 1740-1755 the Mostyshche church was described as new wooden building, built by the local pastor in 1728 with the support of parishioners. The parish consisted of 36 parish house owners. The new wooden church was built in 1870 with the efforts of local pastor. The primary paintings in the interior of the church were covered with new ones in the 1930s. In 1914, there were five bells in the bell tower, which were taken away at the beginning of the war for remelting for military needs. In 1918, when the West Ukrainian People's Republic was proclaimed, the parishioners ordered 5 new bells in Kalush foundry of Fel'chynsky brothers. However, with the new war, the bells were again taken to military needs, only one savvy peasant replaced the biggest church bell with the school bell, hide the church bell and after the war returned it to its place. After the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church was forbidden in 1946, the pastor Hnat Hunkevych was repressed, and the church was taken by the Russian Orthodox Church. However, with the weakening of the communist regime pressure, the parish villagers at the general meeting in 1990 voted to return to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. Now the church is a monument of local architecture ‚Ññ 775 in the use of the community of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. Preserved ancient books of the XVI-XVII centuries, collected during the years of community existence.  Leisure  In the village Mostyshche works the People's House, where there is a library and a museum. There is also a children's playground near the Peoples House, which was built in 2012. The youth of the village actively participates in the village life. At the People's House there are hobby groups. Namely the amateur folk choreographic collective \\"Malva\\", the vocal collective \\"Kalynon'ka\\" and the church choir.
