Career=Early career Tchakount√© played competitive football in Cameroon before moving to France playing for Grenoble followed by Hong Kong where he joined Buler Rangers. He later played for Kitchee. He then moved to the UK and played for the non-league side Carshalton Athletic F.C. in the 2005/2006 season. He then got his big break, signing for Championship side Queens Park Rangers in July 2006. Buler Rangers Armel Tchakount√© initially signed a two-year contract with Hong Kong Premier League side Buler Rangers. During his time at the club, the centre midfield player was described as a \\"Rock\\" due to his strength and power on the ground and in the air. He scored two goals for his side and played an important role in helping the side compete at the top of the league. This led to him attracting the attention of other teams such as South China, Kitchee and many more. After six months of playing for Buler Rangers, he earned the opportunity to sign for league leaders Kitchee, where he was described as one of the best centre midfielders they'd ever had.  Carshalton Athletic  On moving to the UK, Tchakounte was signed by English non-league side Carshalton Athletic at the beginning of January 2006. At the time, Athletics were struggling at the bottom of the Conference South league table. Tchakounte made his debut with the FA Trophy second round clash with Accrington Stanley and scored a magnificent goal. He then made his full league debut in the away fixture at the fellow relegation strugglers Hayes on 26 March 2006. His full playing record at Carshalton was 19 games and 2 substitute appearances. He was an unused substitute on 2 occasions, scoring 5 goals.  Queens Park Rangers  On 5 May 2006, Carshalton announced on their official website that Armel Tchakount√© had signed for the Football League Championship club; the Queens Park Rangers on a one-year deal after spending the final three weeks of the 2005‚Äì06 season with them. Upon his arrival, the Cameroonian midfielder was announced as a player to help them being promoted. However, he only managed four first team games and was an unused substitute on five occasions. The record also showed that he played six times for the reserve team before an injury in January 2007 brought his season to an abrupt halt.  International career  Armel earned his first cap with Cameroon under 18 a few weeks before his 16th birthday in a 3-1 win against Chad in Yaounde. He was the youngest player on the field but managed to imposed his authority in the midfield which led him to his first senior cap. The record also showed that he was called into the senior squad five times.  Style of play  Armel was a complete and versatile midfield, gifted with excellent technical ability, vision and passing range as well as powerful shot from distance, which enabled him to start attacking plays in midfield after winning back possession. He was also a strong, tenacious, hardworking, aggressive and physical player. In addition to these attributes, his pressing ability and stamina allowed him to link up the defense with the attack successfully.  Post retirement  After his football career ended prematurely, Tchakount√© decided to channel his efforts into football coaching and his academic studies. He obtained a Bachelor of Science Physics in 2010 and also a UEFA B Licence. He also obtained an MBA in International Business Management and a Masters in Banking and Finance at the University of Surrey. Armel was a pundit for Voxafrica's coverage of the 2015 African Cup of Nations. He currently lives in London.

The pole in the arena is a memorial to the people killed during this persecution. The persecution in Lyon in AD 177 was a persecution of Christians in Lugdunum, Roman Gaul (present-day Lyon, France), during the reign of Marcus Aurelius (161-180). An account of this persecution is a letter preserved in Eusebius's Ecclesiastical History, book 5, chapter 1. Gregory of Tours describes the persecution in De Gloria martyrum. Background Lugdunum was an important Roman city in Gaul. Founded on the Rhone river in 43 BC by Lucius Munatius Plancus, it served as the capital of the Roman province Gallia Lugdunensis. The emperor Claudius was born in Lugdunum. The first known Christian community established in Lugdunum some time in the 2nd century was led by a bishop named Pothinus from Asia Minor. In the first two centuries of the Christian era, it was local Roman officials who were largely responsible for persecutions. In the second century, the Caesars were largely content to treat Christianity as a local problem, and leave it to their subordinates to deal with. Until the reign of emperor Decius (249-251) persecution was local and sporadic. For Roman governors being a Christian was in itself a subversive act, because it entailed a refusal to sacrifice to the gods of Rome, including the deified emperor. Walton, Stephen. \\"Why were the Early Christians Persecuted?\\", The Theologian Account of the persecution By 177, a number of the Christians in the area of Vienne and Lyons were Greeks from Asia.Butler, Alban. \\"St. Pothinus, Bishop, Sanctus, Attalus, Blandina, &c.;, Martyrs of Lyons\\", Lives of the Saints, Vol.VI, 1866 Before the actual outbreak of violence, Christians were forbidden from the marketplace, the forum, the baths, or to appear in any public places.\\"The Letter of the Churchs of Vienna and Lyons to the Churches of Asia and Phrygia\\", Medieval Sourcebook, Fordham University If they did appear in public they were subject to being mocked, beaten, and robbed by the mob. The homes of Christians were vandalized. (Hist. Eccl., 5.1.5,7). The martyrs of Lyons were accused of \\"Thyestean banquets and Oedipean intercourse,\\" a reference to cannabalism and incest. How long all of this lasted is not indicated, but eventually the authorities seized the Christians and questioned them in the forum in front of the populace. They were then imprisoned until the arrival of the governor. According to Eusebius (Hist. Eccl.,5.4), while yet a presbyter or elder, St. Irenaeus was sent with a letter, from certain members of the Church of Lyons awaiting martyrdom, to Eleutherus, bishop of Rome. When the governor arrived at Lugdunum, he interrogated them in front of the populace again, mistreating them to such a degree that Vettius Epagathus, a Christian and man of high social standing, requested permission to testify on behalf of the accused. This request was refused and instead the governor arrested Vettius Epagathus when he confessed to being a Christian (5.1.9-10). These Christians endured torture while the authorities continued to apprehend others. Two of their pagan servants were seized and, fearing torture, falsely charged the Christians with incest and cannibalism (Hist. Eccl., 5.1.12-13). What followed was the torture of the captive Christians by various means. In the end, all were killed, some of whom had recanted but later returned to the faith (Hist. Eccl., 5.1.45-46). Blandine Deaths There were 48 victims at Lugdunum, half of them were of Greek origin, half Gallo-Roman.Goyau, Georges. \\"Lyons.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 22 Apr. 2013 The elderly Bishop Pothinus, first Bishop of Lugdunum, was beaten and scourged, and died shortly after in prison. A slave, Blandina was subjected to extreme torture. She was initially exposed, hung on a stake, to be the food of the beasts let loose upon her. As none of the beasts at that time touched her; she was brought back again to the prison, before being cast in a net and thrown before a bull.Whitehead, Kenneth D. \\"Witnesses of the Passion\\", Touchstone Magazine Also martyred at this time were Attalus, Epipodius and Alexander, Maturus, Saint Ponticus, a fifteen-year-old boy, and Sanctus, a deacon from Vienne.

Mi≈°koviƒá's net worth was estimated to be $2 billion in 2007, according to the list of 100 wealthiest persons of the post-communist countries made by Polish magazine Wprost.The wealthiest in post-communist countries Mi≈°koviƒá holds 22nd place on this list, but is fifth among the tycoons outside the former Soviet Union. According to the 2007 list of the richest people in the world, published annually by Forbes magazine, Mi≈°koviƒá is the worlds's 691st richest person, with a net worth of $2.9 billion. He is the first person from Serbia to enter this list. In 2019 his net worth was estimated to be $4.8 billion which a significant increase from 2007. He is unofficially one of the richest people in Eastern Europe. Early life Mi≈°koviƒá was born in 1945 in the small village of Bo≈°njane, Central Serbia. He was raised and lived on his family's farm. At age eight, Mi≈°koviƒá was almost blinded in his left eye when a playmate accidentally struck him with a rock while playing with a slingshot, losing 90% of his vision. Mi≈°koviƒá completed his high school education in the nearby city of Kru≈°evac and graduated from the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Economics branch in Kragujevac in 1971, majoring in finance and economics. Afterwards, he worked at Jugobanka and Trayal until 1977, when he found work at ≈Ωupa Chemical Industries (ZCI). Business career Mi≈°koviƒá became financial director of ZCI in 1984, and chief executive in 1987 until 1990, when he briefly served as deputy prime minister in the government of Serbia for only six months in office. Meanwhile, Mi≈°koviƒá founded Delta M (Delta M being a sort of abbreviation of his initials - double M) in 1991, a company that became very successful in the following years, during the Yugoslav wars and under the regime of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. Soon afterwards, he launched Delta banka (sold to Banca Intesa in 2005), that was to become the first part of Mi≈°koviƒá's extremely successful Delta Holding corporation that is involved in agribusiness, retail sales, distribution, financial brokerage, real estate development and insurance. Mi≈°koviƒá's connection to Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá was never obvious, except for his short stint as deputy prime minister in 1990. After the overthrow of Milo≈°eviƒá's regime, Mi≈°koviƒá was linked to Du≈°an Mihajloviƒá, the minister of police at the time, and the other leaders of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia coalition. After 5 October 2000, Mi≈°koviƒá took an advantage of privatisation and started building his empire. As he has managed to purchase most of large companies post Djindjic murder, it is often argued that Mi≈°koviƒá was 'buying Serbia' with money that was taken out to Cyprus during Milosevic reign. Mi≈°koviƒá is today considered to be a figure of great influence on the leading politicians in Serbia. Mi≈°koviƒá was abducted on 9 April 2001, but was released the next day, when the ransom (estimated at about 7 million Deutsche Mark's) was paid 18 hours later. After the assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá on 12 March 2003, the abduction of Mi≈°koviƒá was attributed to the same group that has been convicted of the death of the prime minister and other similar crimes. He was owner of Maxi and Delta stores, but sold them to Belgian Delhaize for 1 billion euros. Criminal investigation On 12 December 2012, Mi≈°koviƒá was detained along with his son Marko and eight others in connection with the privatization of several public road maintenance companies in 2005 during which the suspects allegedly ‚Äúgained illegal profit‚Äù of about ‚Ç¨30 million ($38.98 million). Mi≈°koviƒá and Milo ƒêura≈°koviƒá, who was also arrested, were ‚Äúco-owners in privatized road companies between 2005 and 2010‚Äù and they ‚Äúusurped money and property of those companies worth about 2.87 billion dinars at the time,‚Äù Serbian Special Prosecutor for Organized Crime said in a televised statement, adding that the partnership between the two began in 2005 when Mi≈°koviƒá‚Äôs Cyprus-based company Hemslade Trading Ltd. purchased a road maintenance company based in Belgrade for ‚Ç¨23 million. Mi≈°koviƒá was released from custody on 22 July 2013, after posting a ‚Ç¨12 million bail. In March 2016 he was acquitted by the Belgrade High Court of the abuse of office charges but found guilty of aiding and abetting in tax evasion. On appeal the Appellate Court in Belgrade upheld the ruling of the first-instance court, acquitting Mi≈°koviƒá of the abuse of office charges, but referred the case back to the first-instance court for retrial in regard to the tax evasion charges.

Career Bailey made his professional debut towards the end of the 2004‚Äì05 season at the age of 17, coming off the bench for Queens Park Rangers (QPR) in a Championship match away to Sheffield United. His premature call up was due to a lengthy injury list to Ian Holloway's side, but Bailey impressed with some strong tackles, good turns and an array of impressive passes. The following two seasons saw Bailey feature more regularly, but he failed to hold down a regular first team place, despite some promising displays. On 12 October 2007, he was signed by Oxford United on a one-month loan, where he made three appearances in the Conference Premier. Following his release from QPR, Bailey signed a one-year contract for Grays Athletic on 19 June 2008. He was transfer listed by the club in January 2009, with financial pressures and manager Wayne Burnett's plans being cited as the reason. Bailey was sent out on loan to Farnborough in March 2009. Ebbsfleet United signed Bailey in August following a successful trial. He made his debut against Stevenage Borough on 18 August in Ebbsfleet's 3‚Äì0 away loss in the Conference Premier. Bailey was released by Ebbsfleet in the summer of 2010 and went on to sign an initial short-term contract with Conference North club AFC Telford United. Bailey has since had spells with Kettering Town, two spells with Banbury United as well as a stint with Havant & Waterlooville. He then went on to sign for Isthmian Football League side Wealdstone and also had two spells with Dunstable Town. After a spell at Wealdstone, Bailey re-signed for his second spell at Southern Football League Premier Division side Arlesey Town for the 2014‚Äì15 season, the side managed by Rufus Brevett. Bailey went on to play for AFC Dunstable, Bovingdon, Barton Rovers and Kempston Rovers.

While Adorno and Horkheimer saw culture as subsumed by capital, and by an abstract mode of 'instrumental reason', Mi√®ge rejected what he saw as their economic determinism, arguing that the cultural industries were far more complex than their analysis allowed for. They were not a unified field, and he argued that whilst there was indeed increased commodification of culture by the introduction of industrial methods of production, this new technology also created the possibilities for new exciting innovations.

Jos√© Villalta Saavedra (born January 27, 1862, Havana, - died March 16, 1912, Rome) was a Cuban sculptor. One of the first native Cuban sculptors, Villalta was a mulatto born in Havana. Thanks to private patrons, he was able to train in Europe, first in Canarias (Spain) and then in la Reale Accademia di Belle Arti di Carrara. He worked in Italy and Cienfuegos.  Works  Villalta created several important Cuban monuments and statues, including the statue of Jos√© Marti located in Havana's Parque Central (Central Park) (dedicated February 24, 1905) and the monument to Cuban engineer Francisco de Albear. Vilalta completed the Albear statue in Florence, Italy in 1893. The sculptor won a national competition to create a memorial to eight Cuban medical students executed in 1871 by Spanish colonial troops. It was completed in 1889, and it was the first monument made in Cuba by a Cuban artist. Colon Cemetery in Havana. The Virtues atop the gate were sculpted by Vilalta. In Havana's Necropolis Cristobal Colon (Christopher Columbus Cemetery), Villalta made the sculptures of the Virtues (Faith, Hope and Charity) above the main cemetery entrance and the religious relief sculptures around the cemetery walls. Villalta also created the monument at the most visited place in Necropolis Colon, the grave of Amelia Goyri de la Hoz [de Adot], a woman known as \\"La Milagrosa\\" (\\"The Miraculous Woman\\" or \\"The Miraculous One\\"). An upper- class woman, she died in childbirth in 1901 at age 23, and her stillborn son was placed at her feet when she was buried. According to legend, when the grave was opened years later, her corpse was intact ‚Äì a sign of holiness ‚Äì and her son was nestled in her arms. Amelia is considered by many to be Cuba's unofficial saint. Cubans come to her grave every day to ask for children or love affairs.

His contemporary reputation was as a \\"scandalmonger\\", due to the content of some of his reporting, which overshadowed the political content -- some modern scholars note Callender's writings in favor of democracy. In the United States, he was a central figure in the press wars between the Federalist and Democratic-Republican parties. In the late 1790s, Thomas Jefferson sought him out to attack President John Adams, which Callender did. After Jefferson won the presidency, Callender expected employment as a postmaster, which was denied by Jefferson. Callender then published existing rumors claiming President Jefferson had children with slave Sally Hemings. Self-educated, Callender worked as a recorder of deeds in Scotland when he began publishing satire. He turned to politics, some thought to sedition, in a pamphlet, The Political Progress of Britain, which caused a furor and led him to flee Great Britain for America. He gained notoriety in Philadelphia in the 1790s with reportage and attacks on Alexander Hamilton. Subsequently, he was imprisoned under the Alien and Sedition Acts, and later turned against his one-time Democratic-Republican patrons. In 1803, he drowned, apparently falling in the James River due to intoxication -- although there was some speculation among Federalists that his death may not have been an accident, as he was due to testify in a highly publicized trial later that month.Chernow, Ron. Alexander Hamilton (Penguin Books, 2005) p. 668 Scotland Callender was born in Scotland. He was not given a formal education but secured employment as a sub-clerk in the Edinburgh Sasine office, the equivalent of the Recorder of Deeds. While working in that office, Callender published satirical pamphlets criticizing the writer Samuel Johnson. \\"Deformities of Samuel Johnson\\", published anonymously, appealed to Scottish sentiments.Durey 1990, p. 6 Later he wrote pamphlets attacking political corruption. Callender's political writings were tinged with radical democratic egalitarianism, Scottish nationalism, and a pessimistic view of human nature. They were critical of the liberal notion of progress.Durey 1990, p. 9 An admirer of Jonathan Swift, Callender sought to cut the wealthy and the powerful down to size in his writing. After clashes with his employers, Callender lost his job in the Sasine office. In 1791 Callender wrote a pamphlet criticizing an excise tax, paid for by the brewers who resented it. His writing attracted the attention of some reform-minded members of the Scottish nobility: Francis Garden, Lord Gardenstone, became his patron.Durey 1990, p. 22 In 1792 he published The Political Progress of Britain, a critique of war, imperialism, and corruption. He fled to Ireland and to the United States to avoid prosecution. After Callender left Scotland, Lord Gardenstone exposed him as the author; the journalist's reputation also was marred by the rumor that he had implicated Gardenstone.Durey 1990, p. 44 Philadelphia Callender quickly gained a position as a Congressional reporter in Philadelphia and wrote anonymously for the partisan press. His first American article lambasted pro-war sentiment.Durey 1990, pp. 53, 55 Although he was frequently dogged by poverty and unemployment, by 1794 Callender was a regular freelance commentator on American politics and he would remain at the epicenter of the political life within the new nation until his death.Durey 1990, p. 64 Over the next few years, while living by ghostwriting and piecemeal assignments, Callender became one of a group of radical Republican journalists who socialized together and held similar views on democracy and economic nationalism. During this period, he produced a series of pamphlets in which he attempted to frame a comprehensive political theory, advocating for the government's duty to the poor (in the form of progressive taxation), economic independence from Europe, and the promotion of native industry. These goals put him at odds with the Federalists as well as with some of the more conservative and agrarian Republicans.Durey 1990, pp. 74‚Äì83 Title page, Observations of certain documents contained in no. V & VI of 'The history of the United States for the year 1796,' in which the charge of speculation against Alexander Hamilton, late secretary of the Treasury, is fully refuted. Written by himself. Printed at Philadelphia, 1797 Title page, The Prospect Before Us, by James T. Callender, printed for the author by M. Jones, Jr., and J. Lyon, 1800 His writings attacked Federalist positions with a mix of reasoned argument, satire, and personal invective. His first pamphlet challenged the introduction of an excise tax into American commerce, but it was his invective against America's early national heroes -- George Washington, John Adams, and Alexander Hamilton -- and against their policies and failings, that gained him notoriety. In his pamphlet, A History of the United States for the Year 1796, published in installments in the late spring and early summer of 1797, he exposed the sexual relationship between Hamilton and a married woman, Maria Reynolds, and Hamilton's alleged financial corruption. Callender presented compelling evidence of adultery, but in the 1798 Sketches of the History of America, he wrote that the affair was a distraction from Hamilton's greater offense: partnering with Reynolds' husband in corrupt financial dealings.Durey 1990, p. 102 On August 25, 1797, Hamilton published his own pamphlet in response, later known as, The Reynolds Pamphlet, denying being a party to any improper financial matter, although he confessed to the adultery and proved that he had been victim of blackmail by James Reynolds over his adultery with Reynolds' wife rather than consorting with him in speculation. According to Callender, that was just a smokescreen. The financial charges were never proven, and after the scandal somewhat subsided, in 1798 President Adams appointed Hamilton for a new public office, Major General of the Continental Army. Callender's success was short-lived. By 1798 his fortunes were in a downward spiral: he was forced to seek poor relief, his wife died of yellow fever, and his anonymously published political broadsides were exposed as his by a rival pamphleteer, William Cobbet, putting Callender in legal jeopardy and physical danger.Durey 1990, pp.103‚Äì106 He fled from Philadelphia to Virginia, leaving his children behind. Prosecution for sedition Thomas Jefferson, impressed with Callender's attack on Hamilton, and eager to create a counterforce to the Federalist press,Durey 1990, p.106 sought to use Callender's talents against John Adams. Subsequent to meeting him in Philadelphia, Jefferson supported Callender financially and provided feedback on early proofs of Callender's anti-Federalist pamphlet, The Prospect Before Us.Miller 1977, pp. 148‚Äì151 Prior to the publication of the pamphlet, Callender was compelled to flee on foot from Philadelphia to Virginia, finding temporary refuge at the plantation of Senator Stevens Thomas Mason. This was due to his fleeing of the acts against him on sedition, after calling out Hamilton. In Virginia, he completed The Prospect Before Us, whose subject was the pervasiveness of political corruption, particularly among Federalists and the Adams administration. His populist style had his targets permanently on the defensive.Durey 1990, pp.109, 124‚Äì125 In June 1800, in retaliation for The Prospect, Callender was prosecuted under the Sedition Act by the Adams administration. His trial was presided over by Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase, who later was impeached, in part for his handling of the Callender trial. Callender was fined $200 and received the longest jail term of the journalists prosecuted under the Sedition Act. He was released on the last day of the Adams administration, in March 1801. After his release, Callender and the others who had been prosecuted were pardoned by the new president, Thomas Jefferson. Attacks on Thomas Jefferson Out of jail, Callender asked Jefferson to appoint him Postmaster of Richmond, Virginia, warning that if Jefferson did not, there would be consequences. Callender believed erroneously that Jefferson was conspiring to deprive him of money owed to him by the government after the pardon, and that Jefferson did not appreciate his sacrifices. Jefferson refused to make the appointment, as placing the ill- tempered Callender in a position of authority in the Federalist stronghold of Richmond would have been, in the words of the Jefferson biographer R.B. Bernstein, \\"like whacking a hornet's nest with a stick.\\"Bernstein, R. B. Thomas Jefferson (Oxford University Press, 2003) p. 154 With his career and his social ambitions thwarted, Callender returned to newspaper work, as editor of a Federalist newspaper, the Richmond Recorder. In a series of articles attacking corruption on all sides, Callender targeted Jefferson, revealing that Jefferson had funded his pamphleteering. After denials were issued, he published Jefferson's letters to him to prove the relationship. Later, angered by the criticism from Jefferson supporters, who asserted that Callender had abandoned his wife to die of a venereal disease,Randall, Willard S., Thomas Jefferson: A Life, Henry Holt & Co., 1993, p. 556 Callender reported in a series of articles that Jefferson fathered children by his slave Sally Hemings.Miller 1977, pp. 152‚Äì153Gordon-Reed, Annette. Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy. University of Virginia Press (April 1997), pp. 59‚Äì61. The first of those articles, printed on September 1, 1802, contained this excerpt: > It is well known that the man, Whom it delighteth the people to honor, keeps > and for many years has kept, as his concubine, one of his slaves. Her name > is Sally. The name of her eldest son is Tom. His features are said to bear a > striking though sable resemblance to those of the President himself. The boy > is ten or twelve years of age.Brodie 1974, p. 349 Callender's reporting on the Jefferson-Hemings relationship used racist rhetoric of the time. Although he had expressed anti-slavery views when he first arrived in the United States, he eventually adopted a position on slavery and race similar to that of Jefferson's in Notes on the State of Virginia.Durey 1990, p. 138 After the Hemings controversy ran its course, Callender turned to publicizing Jefferson's earlier attempt to seduce a married neighbor decades before. Death and legacy By some accounts, Callender was slated to provide testimony for a New York trial, The People vs. Croswell, which involved libel charges against a publisher, Harry Croswell, who had reprinted claims that Thomas Jefferson paid Callender to defame George Washington. Croswell's lawyer was Alexander Hamilton.Henderickson, Robert A., The Rise and Fall of Alexander Hamilton, (New York, Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1981), 579. Jefferson, wary of the controversy generated by the Adams administration's sedition prosecutions, had begun a selective campaign against individual newspaper critics. Despite his popularity among newspaper readers, Callender had an uneasy situation. Former allies had turned against him. In a surprise attack in December 1802, George Hay, one of his former defense attorneys, clubbed him in the head with a walking stick in retaliation for an article about an international incident to which Hay had ties.Durey 1990, p. 164 In 1802, Meriwether Jones who was a friend and supporter of Thomas Jefferson and James Callender, had published an open letter to Callender: > The James River you tell us has suffered to cleanse your body; is there any > menstrum [solvent] capable of cleansing your mind... Oh! could a dose of > James river, like Lethe, have blessed you with forgetfulness, for once you > would have neglected your whiskey.Brodie 1974, p. 356 In 1803, Callender's children joined him in Richmond, perhaps removed from Philadelphia due to the Jefferson controversy; he had a falling out with the owner of the Richmond Recorder over money. In March, the offices of the newspaper were attacked by young Republicans from Hay's law firm. One week after the People v. Croswell trial began, Callender drowned on July 17, 1803, in three feet of water in the James River, reportedly too drunk to save himself. In 1990, the Australian writer Michael Durey published a biography covering Callender's life. Durey noted that Callender's then-reputation as a liar, drunkard, and scandalmonger had been uncritically based on the original attacks against Callender by his political targets and rivals in the press. He believed their attacks obscured Callender's message of democratic egalitarianism, his relevance to the early formation of Republican politics, and his role in the birth of political journalism.Durey 1990, pp. 173‚Äì174 In 1997, the historian Annette Gordon-Reed published Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy, showing in detail how historians had traditionally discounted some of the evidence supporting the allegations of Jefferson's paternity of slave children. In 1998, a DNA analysis confirmed that Eston Hemings Jefferson's descendants were related to the Jefferson male line. Together with the historical evidence, the biographers Joseph Ellis and Andrew Burstein, as well the National Genealogical Society, published their conclusions that Jefferson had a long-term relationship and several children by Sally Hemings. In 2010 Gordon-Reed won a MacArthur Fellowship for \\"dramatically chang[ing] the course of Jeffersonian scholarship.\\" In 2000, the journalist and author William Safire published a historical novel, Scandalmonger, about Callender's life in the United States that was based on letters of notable people of the time, including presidents Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe. Forty-four pages at the end of the hardcover edition of the book are what Safire calls \\"the underbook\\", a section distinguishing the historical information from fiction and including notes and sources. In 2008, Kerwin Swint of CNN labeled Callender a \\"hatchet man\\" and credits his smearing of Adams as the critical factor that gave the presidency to Jefferson.

Education and career In 1886, he graduated from Harvard, where, after studying at the universities of G√∂ttingen (1887‚Äì1889) and Erlangen (Ph.D., 1890), he was instructor (1890‚Äì1893), assistant professor (1893‚Äì1903), and thenceforth professor of mathematics. He became professor emeritus in 1933. Osgood was chairman of the department of mathematics in Harvard from 1918 to 1922. From 1899 to 1902, he served as editor of the Annals of Mathematics and in 1904‚Äì1905 was president of the American Mathematical Society, whose Transactions he edited in 1909‚Äì1910. Contributions The works of Osgood dealt with complex analysis, in particular conformal mapping and uniformization of analytic functions, and calculus of variations. He was invited by Felix Klein to write an article on complex analysis in the Enzyklop√§die der mathematischen Wissenschaften which was later expanded in the book Lehrbuch der Funktionentheorie. Osgood curves, Jordan curves with positive area, are named after Osgood, who published a paper proving their existence in 1903.. Besides his research on analysis, Osgood was also interested in mathematical physics and wrote on the theory of the gyroscope.

Height: 2.05 metres (6 feet 9 inches) Apoxyomenos (the \\"Scraper\\") is one of the conventional subjects of ancient Greek votive sculpture; it represents an athlete, caught in the familiar act of scraping sweat and dust from his body with the small curved instrument that the Romans called a strigil. The most renowned Apoxyomenos in Classical Antiquity was that of Lysippos of Sikyon, the court sculptor of Alexander the Great, made ca 330 BCE. The bronze original is lost, but it is known from its description in Pliny the Elder's Natural History, which relates that the Roman general Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa installed Lysippos's masterpiece in the Baths of Agrippa that he erected in Rome, around 20 BCE. Later, the emperor Tiberius became so enamored of the figure that he had it removed to his bedroom.So Pliny reports. Compare the myth of Pygmalion and the anecdote that was circulating in Rome about an admirer of Praxiteles' Aphrodite of Knidos. Tiberius at least removed the statue to his private palace. However an uproar in the theatre, \\"Give us back our Apoxyomenos\\", shamed the emperor into replacing it. The sculpture is commonly represented by the Pentelic marble copy in the Museo Pio-Clementino in Rome, discovered in 1849 when it was excavated in Trastevere (illustration, right). Plaster casts of it soon found their way into national academy collections, and it is the standard version in textbooks. The sculpture, slightly larger than lifesize, is characteristic of the new canon of proportion pioneered by Lysippos, with a slightly smaller head (1:8 of the total height, rather than the 1:7 of Polykleitos) and longer and thinner limbs. Pliny notes a remark that Lysippos \\"used commonly to say\\" - that while other artists \\"made men as they really were, he made them as they appeared to be.\\" Lysippus poses his subject in a true contrapposto, with an arm outstretched to create a sense of movement and interest from a range of viewing angles. The Croatian Apoxyomenos Pliny also mentioned treatments of this motif by Polykleitos and by his pupil or follower, Daidalos of Sicyon, who seems to have produced two variants on the theme.Pliny: pueros duos destringentes se (Natural History 34.76); Daippos, Lysippos' son, was also credited with an apoxyomenos. A fragmentaryIt was reassembled from 234 fragments, originally cast in seven sections, according to Steven Lattimore, \\"The Bronze Apoxyomenos from Ephesos\\" American Journal of Archaeology 76.1 (January 1972:13-16) p. 13. bronze statue of the Polycleitan/Sikyonian type,The discovery of Daidalos' signature on a socle at Ephesus encouraged speculation that this apoxyomenos was his (Lattimore 1972:14 note 21 gives bibliography). who holds his hands low to clean the sweat and dust from his left hand,The first restoration made at the Kunstgewerbe Museum was adjusted in 1953; a small Roman marble copy in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts (acc. no. 00.304) retains the strigil and shows the positions of the hands (Cornelius C. Vermeule, \\"Greek Sculpture and Roman Taste\\", Boston Museum Bulletin 65 No. 342 (1967:175-192, illus. p. 178); a suggestion, before the discovery of the Zagreb Apoxyomenos, that he was actually cleaning the strigil with the thumb and fingers of his left hand was made by Lattimore 1972. was excavated in 1896 at the site of Ephesus in Turkey; it is conserved in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna. Its quality is so fine that scholars have debated whether it is a fourth-century original, in the sense that workshop repetitions are all \\"originals\\" or a later copy made during the Hellenistic period.A bibliography of the debate is in Lattimore 1972:13 note 7. A classicising version in the neo-Attic style in the Medici collections at the Uffizi had led earlier scholars to posit a classical fifth-century original, before the bronze was unearthed at Ephesus.L. Bloch, \\"Eine Athletenstatue der Uffiziengallerie\\" R√∂mische Mitteilungen 7 (1892:81-105) and Uffizi guidebooks, noted by Lattimore 1972:13 note 5. A substantially complete bronze Apoxyomenos of this model, who strigilates his left hand, held close to his thigh, was discovered by Ren√© Wouten from the northern Adriatic Sea between two islets, Vele Orjule and Kozjak, near Lo≈°inj in Croatia, in 1996. Rene Wouten found the bronze statue fully covered in sponges and sea life. No parts of the statue were missing, though its head was disconnected from the body. 1.92m long, the statue is currently thought to be a Hellenistic copy of Lysippos‚Äô Apoxyomenos from the second or first century BCE; it is conserved in Zagreb's Mimara Museum as the Croatian Apoxyomenos (illustration, left).Valvanis, P. (David Hardy, tr), \\"Bronze statues from the depths of the sea,\\" in Tzalas, ed., Great Moments in Greek Archaeology (Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum) 2007:359-60. It shares with the Ephesus bronze \\"the almost portrait-like individuality of the face, by no means a 'classical' type\\", with its broad, fleshy jaw and short chin and \\"hair made rough and unruly by sweat and dust\\".Lattimore 1972:15. An \\"excellent copy\\" of the head, known since the 19th century, is conserved in the Hermitage Museum.O. Waldhauer, Die Antiken Skulpturen der Hermitage, vol. II (1913) cat. no. 140, noted in Lattimore 1972. Another refined bronze head of an Apoxyomenos of this type (now in the Kimball Art Museum)Bronze head of an Apoxyomenos, Kimball Art Museum had found its way into the collection of Bernardo Nani in Venice in the early eighteenth century. Other antiquities in Nani's collection had come from the Peloponnesus; the Kimball Art Museum suggests that the Nani head may have come from mainland Greece too. The head, like the Croatian Apoxyomenos, has lips that were originally veneered with copperThe Croatian Apoxyomenos also has copper-inlaid nipples. and his eyes were inlaid in glass, stone, and copper.

Furlong has played in the Premier League for Chelsea and in the Football League for Coventry City, Watford, Birmingham City, Queens Park Rangers, Sheffield United, Luton Town, Southend United and Barnet. He has also played non-League football for Enfield and Kettering Town. At representative level, he has six caps for the England semi-professional team. Furlong's son Darnell made his professional debut with QPR in 2015. Playing career=Coventry City He began his career at non-League level with Conference side Enfield in 1986, remaining there until July 1991 when he signed for Football League First Division side Coventry City. He was brought to Highfield Road by the club's player-manager and former England defender Terry Butcher, and when Butcher was sacked in January he remained in favour under new manager Don Howe. Furlong only managed four goals from 37 league games all season, however, and after the season ended he was transferred to Watford. Watford Furlong was much more successful at Watford in Division One (the new name for the original Second Division after the creation of the Premier League), and was voted Watford Player of the Season in 1993. Although he failed to inspire Watford to a promotion challenge, he established himself as one of the finest strikers in the division at this time, alongside the likes of Steve Bull and Stan Collymore. Chelsea At the end of the 1993‚Äì94 season, he became Chelsea's record signing in a ¬£2.3million deal, and that season he helped them reach the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup semi-finals (losing to Real Zaragoza by a single goal) as well as finish 11th in the Premier League. However, the arrival of Ruud Gullit and Mark Hughes during the 1995 close season reduced his first team opportunities, and following the arrival of Gianluca Vialli a year later he opted to move on. During his time at Chelsea he scored 18 goals in 85 matches in all competitions. Birmingham City He became Birmingham City's record signing in a ¬£1.5million deal. Although it meant dropping down a division, Furlong knew he would have more chances of first team action in the West Midlands, and was part of an ambitious side managed by Trevor Francis and containing fellow big names including Steve Bruce, Mike Newell and Gary Ablett. He remained at St Andrew's for six years, scoring 50 goals in 130 Division One games, and having loan spells at Queen's Park Rangers (twice) and Sheffield United. Queens Park Rangers He finally left the Blues in the summer of 2002, the year they reached the Premier League after 16 years outside the top flight, and signed a contract with Queen's Park Rangers in Division Two. This was a return to a previous club as Furlong had been a youth team player at QPR at the start of his career. He continued to do well at Loftus Road, helping them win promotion in 2004, and by the time he left in 2007, he had played 162 league games and scored 54 goals. Luton Town On leaving QPR, the 38-year-old Furlong signed for Luton Town who had just been relegated from the Football League Championship. He scored eight goals in 32 games but was unable to prevent the financially troubled side from suffering a second successive relegation. Southend United He then signed for League One side Southend United, but made just 3 appearances during the first half of the season and was loaned out to Barnet in January 2009. After two goals in January the loan spell was extended until the end of the season. His goal in Barnet's 1‚Äì0 win against AFC Bournemouth was his 200th senior goal, and he marked the occasion by laying down his shirt and saluting it. Barnet He was released by Southend at the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season, and joined Barnet on a one-year deal after an excellent pre-season This was subsequently extended until the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season. On 2 June 2010, Furlong was released by Barnet. Kettering Town A few weeks later, he joined Conference National club Kettering Town as player-coach. During the 2010‚Äì11 season with Kettering, Furlong scored 5 times in 27 appearances for the club ‚Äì including a brace in a match against Eastbourne Borough on 22 January 2011 ‚Äì as they finished 15th in the Conference Premier. St Albans City On 10 August, Furlong was confirmed as player/coach at Southern Premier League side St Albans City. He scored on his debut for St Albans in a Southern League Premier Division game against Cirencester Town. International career When at Enfield he was capped six times for the England semi-pro team, scoring once. He was also eligible to play for Montserrat.

It begins at an intersection with US 9 in the Columbia County town of Stockport and extends for to an interchange with US 9 and US 20 in the Rensselaer County city of Rensselaer. The route parallels the Hudson River for its entire length, and several parts of the highway run directly alongside the river. NY 9J was assigned to its current alignment as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.  Route description  NY 9J proceeding northward from US 9 in Stockport NY 9J begins at an intersection with US 9 in the hamlet of Columbiaville, located within the town of Stockport. The route proceeds northwest along a two-rural street that parallels US 9 until the intersection with Day Road, where it turns westward. Reaching the Amtrak and Norfolk Southern's Hudson Subdivision, NY 9J and the tracks begin a northward trek near the Hudson River, winding past a junction with County Route 46 (CR 46) in the town of Stuyvesant. Winding northward along the tracks, NY 9J reaches the hamlet of Stuyvesant, where it intersects with CR 26A (Kinderhook Street), a highway formerly designated as NY 398. NY 9J continues north out of the hamlet of Stuyvesant, paralleling, crossing then paralleling a spur of the railroad tracks north of town. Retaining its northerly direction, the route parallels the Muitzes Kill and past Schodack Island State Park (composed of what was six islands now reduced to two). A short distance northward, NY 9J crosses into Rensselaer County and enters the town of Schodack. Immediately entering the hamlet of Schodack Landing, the route remains a two-lane residential street, crossing a junction with the western terminus of CR 2 (Schodack Landing Road). Just after crossing the intersection with Knickerboxer Road, NY 9J crosses under the New York State Thruway's Berkshire Thruway and the Castleton-on- Hudson Bridge. Past the Thruway crossing, NY 9J turns northeast, crossing Muitzes Kill and intersecting CR 1 (Muitzes Kill Road) on the river's north bank. At this point, the road becomes known as South Main Street as bends northward into the village of Castleton-on-Hudson. Crossing north through the village, NY 9J parallels the Norfolk Southern tracks to an intersection with the western terminus of NY 150 (Scott Avenue). The route continues through Castleton-on-Hudson's northern portion as North Main Street before leaving the village for more rural areas along the banks of the Hudson River. It continues northeast along the riverbank as River Road to Stony Point, a small hamlet north of Castleton-on-Hudson, where the route connects to CR 8 (Stony Point Road). NY 9J's northern junction at US 9 and US 20 in Rensselaer. Not far from Stony Point, the route crosses into the town of East Greenbush, a suburb of the city of Rensselaer. It intersects CR 58 (Hayes Road) in the southern part of town before heading into heavily industrialized areas near the southern edge of the Rensselaer city limits. The route passes east of an oil refinery for Sunoco as it enters Rensselaer, where NY 9J serves several other commercial and residential buildings along a stretch leading to an interchange with US 9 and US 20 (Columbia Turnpike). NY 9J feeds directly into the ramps to and from US 9 south and US 20 west while access to and from US 9 north and US 20 east is made by way of South Street, which connects to NY 9J just south of the interchange. History The section of NY 9J between Muitzes Kill in Schodack and the Rensselaer city limits was improved to state highway standards as part of three separate projects carried out by the state of New York in the 1910s. Each project covered a different segment of the route, and all three parts of the highway were added to the state highway system in 1915. The portion within the town of Schodack was inventoried as State Highway 1116 (SH 1116) while the section in East Greenbush was listed as SH 1115\\\\. Both state highway numbers are unsigned. The state assumed maintenance of the river road from Muitzes Kill south to Stuyvesant by 1926 and an extension of the road southeast to Columbiaville in the late 1920s. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the Columbiaville‚ÄìRensselaer riverside highway became part of NY 9J, a new route continuing north over locally maintained streets to US 9 and US 20 in Rensselaer.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931).

She was one of the subjects of the 2005 documentary film Lipstick & Dynamite: The First Ladies of Wrestling.http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/sptimes/obituary.aspx?pid=164620616http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2013/04/19/20754271.html Professional wrestling career Ella Waldek was born as Elsie Schevchenko in Custer, Washington and grew up as a self-described \\"farm girl\\". Originally a roller derby performer, Waldek's professional wrestling career began in 1952 after a male friend took her to a professional wrestling event. \\"I didn‚Äôt even know there was such a thing\\" she claimed years later. She was trained by The Fabulous Moolah.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, p.57. Despite her limited knowledge of professional wrestling at the time, Waldek began a career in Chicago, Illinois. She adopted the name \\"Ella Waldek\\" because, in her words, \\"who could stand in a ring and autograph an eleven letter last name?\\" Waldek earned the nickname \\"The Policeman\\" and also worked under the names \\"Jackie Lee\\" and \\"Charming Carmen\\". She adopted the short arm scissor lift as one her signature maneuvers. Over the course of her career, Waldek worked matches with other female wrestlers, including Mae Young. Janet Boyer Wolfe died after a body slam she had received from Waldek during a tag team match, though she was not injured by the move. Wolfe rolled out of the ring and collapsed at ringside. Waldek called for the timekeeper to assist her and get her away from the ring. Though Wolfe's death was eventually ruled to be an accident, police initially arrested Waldek and the other participants in the match‚ÄîMae Young and Eva Lee. The police reportedly considered charging the three with manslaughter, but all three women were eventually released. Ironically, as a result of the incident, people attended wrestling events to see Waldek, who had to endure crowd chants of \\"murderer\\" directed at her. Over the course of her wrestling career, Waldek held several titles including the NWA Florida Women's Championship, the NWA World Women's Tag Team Championship with Mae Young and two reigns with the NWA Southern Women's Championship, Florida version. Post-wrestling career After almost twenty years of wrestling, Waldek ended her career in 1971. She then became a private investigator and subsequently founded her own security firm, before taking up gardening part-time. Her professional career had apparently taken its toll though, as she had been rendered unable to have children due to a kick she had taken to the solar plexus. Waldek recounted her experiences as a professional wrestler for the documentary film Lipstick & Dynamite, reuniting with some of her fellow female wrestlers in the process. Through her involvement in the film, Waldek found out that singer-songwriter Neko Case, who had been working on music for the film, is her great-niece.

In the story, Kakashi is the teacher of Team 7, consisting of the series' primary characters, Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, and Sakura Haruno. He is initially portrayed as a detached and apathetic figure, but as the series progresses, his loyalty to his friends and students becomes increasingly apparent. Kakashi's past has been extensively explored in the series, resulting in a gaiden being devoted to his past experiences. Kakashi has appeared in several pieces of Naruto media, the featured films in the series, the original video animations, and the video games. Kakashi was originally created by Kishimoto to be a harsh teacher but the author decided to avoid that. Instead, he made him more generous to calm his students in difficult situations to the point of giving him feminine traits. Kakashi's design gave Kishimoto difficulties as a result of having most of his face covered and as a result it was difficult to show his emotions. For the anime series, he is voiced by Kazuhiko Inoue in Japanese and Dave Wittenberg in the English dub. Numerous anime and manga publications have praised and criticized Kakashi's character. Although he has been noted to be an echo of similar detached sh≈çnen manga characters, the duality of Kakashi's apathetic and serious sides have been praised. Kakashi has been highly popular with the Naruto reader base, placing high in several popularity polls. Merchandise based on Kakashi has also been released, including key chains and plush dolls. Creation and conception Masashi Kishimoto originally intended for Kakashi to debut in the second chapter of the Naruto manga, appearing prior to the other members of Team 7. This Kakashi was designed as a laid back but very skilled ninja that ended his sentences with the polite \\"de gozaru\\" in the Japanese versions of the series. After speaking with his editor, Kishimoto pushed this debut back, allowing him to better develop Kakashi and the rest of Team 7. Despite this, Kakashi retains many of his original personality traits, being easygoing, unfazed by the actions of others, and eyes appearing to be half-asleep. Kishimoto feels that this makes Kakashi a compelling leader and helps to keep the diverse members of Team 7 unified. Early in the making of the series, Kakashi was designed as a samurai but he was not sure what the character would do in the manga. Thinking about how the protagonists' teacher would behave, Kishimoto envisioned him as a rude adult. However, he was not happy with this type of personality so he rewrote it to a more laid back person. He found this portrayal funny but still made him hot-blooded for serious situations. As the manga continued, he changed his speech pattern and gave it a laid back touch, with kindness and a woman-like. There was no model for Kakashi; Kishimoto wanted to write a calm teacher who would help his students in complicated situations. Because he acts as a link between the other main characters of the series, Kakashi is rarely featured prominently in promotional artwork, instead appearing in the background while his students are the focus of the scene. In an interview in Sh≈çnen Jump's, Kishimoto said that if he were to make an extra story from the manga with a different character, such character would be Kakashi. In early 2014, Kishimoto commented he wanted to reveal Kakashi's face but was not sure whether it would be in the manga or an upcoming movie. The Raikiri, one of Kakashi's most common techniques, had a different name, but the author forgot about its original name. Nevertheless, he found the name Raikiri fitting for this lightning-based technique. Kakashi's was introduced to give the character mystery as only members from the Uchiha clan could possess it. By chapter 16 of the manga, Kishimoto had already decided how Kakashi obtained the Sharingan. He also added that Kakashi's face was difficult to draw since it is covered by a mask. In April 2015, Kishimoto revealed Kakashi's face for the first time during an exhibition. When deciding upon Kakashi's name, Kishimoto considered a number of possibilities: Kuwa („ÇØ„ÉØ, \\"hoe\\"), Kama („Ç´„Éû, \\"scythe\\"), Botan („Éú„Çø„É≥, \\"peony\\"), Enoki („Ç®„Éé„Ç≠, a nettle tree), and Kakashi („Ç´„Ç´„Ç∑, \\"scarecrow\\"). He eventually decided upon Kakashi, and remains glad that he did to this day. In keeping with the meaning of his name, scarecrows are occasionally used to represent Kakashi; Naruto, for example, uses a scarecrow that is dressed like Kakashi to help him train for a combat test between the two. Likewise, scarecrows are at times added to the background of scenes in which Kakashi appears, as is the case with the cover of the Naruto manga volume three. In animated versions of the manga, Kakashi has been voiced by Kazuhiko Inoue in Japanese. Inoue was surprised about Kakashi's popularity within the Naruto fans and expected people to continue supporting him. In an interview, Dave Wittenberg, who does the voice acting for Kakashi in the English dub, comments that he feels he is similar to the character since he tends to have one eye open at a time and he becomes angry if he is interrupted while reading. He also added that what he likes most about Kakashi is his relation with his students, noting him to be \\"a very nice person\\". Appearances=In Naruto Kakashi using Lightning Blade. Kakashi Hatake is introduced as the Jonin (elite ninja) leader in charge of Team 7, a new ninja team including Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno. He first appears as a carefree character as he tends to lose track of time, and is frequently late to his appointments as a result. However, when testing his students, Kakashi reveals himself as a strong opponent to the point where he fights while reading series of erotic novels. Kakashi is renowned throughout the Naruto world for the use of his Sharingan which he received from his teammate Obito Uchiha during the third shinobi world war and is revered as the ninja who has copied over a thousand jutsus, earning him the moniker . The Sharingan grants him the ability to mimic the movements and jutsu of others. Although most of Kakashi's abilities were acquired with his Sharingan, he also invented the and its variation, a collection of lightning chakra in one's hand that uses the Sharingan's visual ability to lock onto a target. When first forming Team 7, Kakashi does not turn them into his students until instilling in them the concept of teamwork even if they have to break the rules he gave them. Kakashi continues to further this philosophy for the duration of Part I upon Sasuke Uchiha but is unable to get through to him before the latter's defection from Konoha. Kakashi also reluctantly participates in various kinds of challenges by his childhood friend Might Guy who considers Kakashi his rival. Kakashi's background is explored in Kakashi Gaiden, a six chapter series that divides the gap between Part I and II of the manga. Kakashi is the son of Sakumo Hatake who was one of the most powerful shinobis Konoha ever produced and was renowned throughout the ninja world as \\"White Fang of the Leaf\\". During his lifetime, Sakumo's fame even surpassed that of the Sannin. Kakashi was himself a child prodigy and during the ninja academy years he was hailed as the best of his generation. Following his father's suicide after a failed mission, Kakashi adopted the philosophy that the success of a mission must always come first rather than the welfare of his comrades in contrast to his father. Kakashi is assigned by his teacher, Minato Namikaze, to lead a mission that would turn the current war in Konoha's favor. When his teammate, Rin Nohara, is captured by enemy ninja, his other teammate, Obito Uchiha, convinces him to rescue her despite the mission's ending. After finding Rin, an enemy-induced cave-in crushed Obito's right half. With his dying wish and the possibility of enemy reinforcements, Obito has Rin implant his newly acquired Sharingan into Kakashi's recently damaged eye socket as a parting gift. His new eye in place, Kakashi flees with Rin as the cave collapsed, eventually completing their mission. Shortly after this event, Kakashi has to rescue Rin again who is kidnapped by Kirigakure; however, he learns that the Kiri, under the influence of Madara Uchiha, has made Rin as the host of the Three Tails, Isobu. Rin requests Kakashi to kill her so she may not be used by the Hidden Mist ninja as part of a Trojan Horse scheme against Konoha, but Kakashi is reluctant. She eventually forces herself on the way of Kakashi's Lightning Blade that he originally directed at the pursuing Hidden Mist ninja, killing her. An anime exclusive flashback arc in Naruto Shippuden covered Kakashi coping with what he endured during the war as he becomes an ANBU operative during Minato's time as Hokage and influences Yamato into becoming a member of the ANBU as well. Once relieved of duty in the ANBU, Kakashi becomes a Genin instructor prior to the events of Part I. Kakashi's Mangekyo Sharingan Two-and-a-half years later in Part II, Kakashi reforms Team 7. During the gap in time, Kakashi hones the that he gained from result of Rin's death to master the Kamui ability that allows him to send any targeted object to another dimension. Because his students are now capable of taking care of themselves, Kakashi takes a more active role in the battles that go on during the series, particularly those with the criminal organization Akatsuki. When the Akatsuki leader, Pain, invades Konoha, Kakashi engages him in battle but he dies as a result of forcing all his energy. However, after his confrontation with Naruto, Pain decides to use all of his remaining power to revive all those killed in the battle at Konoha, including Kakashi. Following a brief encounter with Tobi, the Akatsuki's true leader, Kakashi becomes one of the generals to participate in the war against Tobi's army. As Naruto and Killer Bee continue to battle against Tobi and his forces, Kakashi and Guy arrive to join the fight against Tobi. During the encounter, Kakashi learns that Tobi is Obito, who in fact had survived his apparent death and had committed horrible deeds since Rin's death to destroy the world order that allowed their friend's demise to occur with Kakashi being left greatly stunned and also horrified at Obito's actions. Despite the guilt for what Obito has become, Kakashi is encouraged by Naruto to continue fighting and the battle ends with Kakashi managing to impale Obito. When Naruto is nearly killed by Madara, Kakashi and a redeemed Obito joined forces to protect Naruto by spiriting him off into the latter's dimension to be healed. After losing his Sharingan, Naruto using his new-found abilities to restore his original eye, Kakashi finds himself temporarily infused by the chakra-based spirit of Obito as he gains his friend's full Sharingan abilities and a Susanoo to help his team defeat Kaguya. Kakashi Hatake is the commander of the third battle unit in fourth great ninja war. Following the conclusion of the war, Kakashi is named by Tsunade as her successor, the Sixth Hokage, with his first act being to pardon Sasuke for his crimes. He holds this title for many years before finally passing it to Naruto, as revealed in the epilogue. Appearances in other media Kakashi has made appearances outside of the Naruto anime and manga. He is in ten of the feature films in the series: in the first movie he battles Nadare Rouga and later defeats him, in the third Kakashi battles the hired ninja Ishidate, whom he fights to a standstill, and he later acts as a distraction for his team by battling the minister Shabadaba's soldiers, in the fourth Kakashi fights against a large group of stone soldiers, in the fifth, Kakashi is sent alongside Shikamaru Nara, Sai, and Shino Aburame to investigate the base of the Sky Country, in the sixth, when the threat of war loom over Konoha from the other ninja villages, Kakashi is sent on a suicide mission to defeat a rogue ninja named Hiruko who wants his Sharingan, however, Naruto and Sakura ultimately prevent their teacher from throwing his life away, in the seventh movie, in which a younger Kakashi is a member of a team composed of himself, Minato, Shibi Aburame and Ch≈çza Akimichi to stop Anrokuzan with the help of a time displaced Naruto. In the eighth, he serves as part of the plan to lock Naruto in prison before subsequently helping to break him out, and in the ninth, an alternate version of him with an identical appearance to Guy is shown, to Sakura's dismay. Canonically, in the tenth, he appears as the Sixth Hokage, helping the village while Naruto is away, and in the eleventh he makes a cameo appearance waking up a drowsy Naruto (who is now the Seventh Hokage) shadow clone by tapping him on the head with a book. Kakashi is also present in all four of the original video animations produced for the series, helping Naruto and Konohamaru Sarutobi to find a four leaf clover in the first original video animation, joining his team in escorting a ninja named Shibuki to his village in the second, participating in a tournament in the third, and working with Team 7 in the fourth one. A light novel titled Kakashi Hiden: Lightning in the Icy Sky, written by Akira Higashiyama and illustrated by Kishimoto, focuses on the early days of Kakashi's appointment as the Sixth Hokage, in which he has to stop a terror plan conducted by a pair of Kirigakure ninja, who plan to take control of a newly unveiled airborne ship to stage a jailbreak of a notorious criminal, in the process learning about the pair's tragic reason for doing so. In the anime sequel of Naruto Shippuden, Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, Kakashi makes minor appearances until testing the young main characters during a test to see if they can become ninjas. Kakashi is a playable character in all Naruto video games, including the Clash of Ninja series and the Ultimate Ninja series. In some games, he is able to use his Sharingan in combat, often as a different character with the ability activated, and in other games, he is available in his ANBU attire. An upcoming light novel titled Kakashi Hiden will focus on the character. Reception Kakashi has ranked within the top five characters in every official Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump popularity poll, acquiring the first position, as the most popular character, several times. In the most recent poll, he ranked third, with Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha acquiring the top two positions. There has not been another official poll since the poll as of 2006. In the Anime Awards 2006 from About.com, Kakashi won in the category \\"Best Supporting Male Character\\". He was also a nominee during the first \\"Nickelodeon Magazine Comics Awards\\" in the category \\"Best Hair in Comics\\", losing to Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes. In an Oricon poll of \\"manga master\\", Kakashi was third with 8.4% of the votes. Merchandise based on Kakashi's character has also been released, including plush dolls, key chains, and a limited edition figurine. Several publications for manga, anime, video games, and other related media have provided praise and criticism on Kakashi's character. Christopher A. Born regards Kakashi's teaching of Team 7 to work as a team, even if they have to break the rules, to be reinforcing the Confucian values of the \\"importance of benevolence and reciprocity\\". IGN noted the duality of Kakashi's serious persona in combat and his laid back, apathetic countenance when dealing with his students, but accepted that he is one of the most popular characters in the series. They also commented that Kakashi is one of the more popular characters they have seen cosplayed at anime conventions. Active Anime celebrated Kakashi's abilities, noting that he fell into the overall theme of characters hiding detailed personalities and secrets. T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews derided Kakashi as a stereotypical \\"Man of Mystery\\" seen in other sh≈çnen manga, but praised him as being \\"much more interesting\\" than the three main characters, and felt that for all intents and purposes, the show could be renamed simply \\"Kakashi\\". Mania Entertainment's Dani Moure likes how Kakashi fits into Team 7 because he is a \\"hilarious character in that sometimes he doesn't seem all that bothered about things and yet is so masterful of his craft.\\" Chris Beveridge from the site stated that Kakashi is his favorite character from the series because of his personality and praised his fight against Pain, and that after its ending, the character gets \\"a very humanizing moment\\", making the episode from the battle stand out. Manga author Yoshihiro Togashi found Kakashi's first battle against his students as one of the first series' moments that impressed him due to how the difference in strength between such characters was shown by just making Kakashi read a book during the fight. IGN ranked him as the 15th greatest anime character of all time, saying that \\"He's a complex character, with an iconic character design and a laid back attitude that just exudes cool.\\" Amy McNulty from Anime News Network highly praised Kakashi's fight against Obito Uchiha due to its animation and the references to the two fighters' childhoods. In 2014, IGN listed him as the best Naruto character when the series ended. Kakashi's portrayal in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations attracted negative responses by Anime News Network. His rude demeanor during the ninja graduation exams was criticized as the reviewer noted Boruto did not deserve such poor treatment. In a latter review, ANN criticized the poor advice he gives to Sasuke when his former student is trying to bond with his daughter, Sarada Uchiha, making it unsuitable comic relief.

The Supreme Court has created a two-part test to determine when the death penalty is an appropriate punishment for felony murder. Under Enmund v. Florida,Enmund v. Florida, the death penalty may not be imposed on someone who did not kill, attempt to kill, or intend that a killing take place. However, under Tison v. Arizona,Tison v. Arizona, the death penalty may be imposed on someone who was a major participant in the underlying felony and acted with reckless indifference to human life. Proportionality and felony murder The Court's proportionality principle has three components, two of which are objective and one of which is subjective. The objective evidence the Court looks for is the legislative judgment of the states and the behavior of sentencing juries; the subjective evidence the Court looks for is the extent to which a particular death penalty serves the goals of retribution and deterrence. Examining nearly the same question a mere five years apart, the Court came to two different conclusions‚Äîthat the Eighth Amendment allows the death penalty for felony murder in some cases but not others, and that the dividing line is the situation presented by Tison. Legislative judgments of the states In Coker v. Georgia,Coker v. Georgia, the Court had rejected the death penalty for rape because only one state‚ÄîGeorgia‚Äîallowed that punishment. Accordingly, the task for the Court was to count the number of states that allowed the death penalty for felony murder to see if the death penalty was a comparatively rare sanction for that crime. This enumeration was not as simple as it might seem at first. In 1982, 36 states authorized the death penalty. In four, felony murder was not a capital crime. In 11 others, proof of some culpable mental state was an element of capital murder. In 13 states, aggravating circumstances above and beyond the fact of the murder itself were required before imposing the death penalty. This left eight states‚Äîout of 36‚Äîallowed the death penalty for merely participating in a felony in which a murder was committed. The Court concluded that this evidence \\"weighs on the side of rejecting capital punishment for the crime at issue\\"‚Äîfelony murder for a minor participant who did not actually kill anyone or intend to kill anyone. By 1987, the counting of the states had shifted. In response to Enmund, four states had modified their capital punishment statutes to reject the death penalty for murder committed in the course of a felony when the participant exhibited reckless indifference to human life. Nevertheless, the Court observed in Tison that of the states that authorized the death penalty for felony murder, only 11 forbade it even for major participants in the felony who exhibited reckless indifference to human life. By the time of Tison, some state supreme courts had expressly interpreted Enmund to allow the death penalty in these cases. Sentencing decisions of juries \\"The jury... is a significant and reliable objective index of contemporary values because it is so directly involved\\" in the criminal justice system. In Enmund the Court recited that of 362 appellate decisions since 1954, only 6 involved a death sentence for a nontriggerman convicted of felony murder, and all 6 executions took place in 1955. This was comparatively rarer than death sentences for rape, of which there had been 72 between 1955 and 1977. Also, as of October 1, 1981, there were 796 people on death row in the United States, of whom only 3 had been sentenced to death absent a finding that the defendant had actually killed someone or intended that a killing take place. In Tison, however, the fact that since Enmund, state appellate courts continued to review and approve death sentences for defendants convicted of felony murder who were major participants in the underlying felony and had exhibited extreme indifference to human life persuaded the Court that juries still considered the death penalty an appropriate punishment for at least some defendants convicted of felony murder. Retribution and deterrence Faced with the objective evidence suggesting that legislatures and sentencing juries did not uniformly reject the death penalty for all defendants convicted of felony murder, the Court had to limit the death penalty to a discrete and narrow category of felony murder defendants based on its estimation of which category would best effectuate the goals of retribution and deterrence. The Enmund Court stressed that the propriety of the death penalty must be measured in light of Enmund's own conduct. The Tison Court added that historically, the individualized determination incorporates an assessment of the mental state with which the defendant commits a crime, because a more culpable mental state merits a more severe punishment. In Woodson v. North Carolina,Woodson v. North Carolina, the Court had struck down a mandatory death penalty statute because it failed to provide for individualized consideration at sentencing. The rule fashioned by Enmund and Tison accommodated this concern by ensuring that only felony murder defendants who had a sufficiently culpable mental state received the death penalty. In an earlier case the Court had remarked that \\"capital punishment can serve as a deterrent only when murder is the result of premeditation and deliberation.\\" The Tison rule retreats from this belief with its implicit assessment that the death penalty can deter even those who act recklessly. \\"A narrow focus on the question of whether or not a given defendant intended to kill... is a highly unsatisfactory means of definitively distinguishing the most culpable and dangerous of murderers.\\" In the Court's estimation, \\"reckless indifference to the value of human life may be every bit as shocking to the moral sense as an intent to kill.\\" Imposing the death penalty on a major participant in a felony who exhibits reckless indifference to human life is justified because of the interest in expressing retribution; imposing it on someone who intends to kill serves deterrence. Justice Brennan on those who do not intend to kill Justice Brennan concurred in the result in Enmund but dissented in Tison because he believed that there was a measurable difference between one who acts intentionally and one who acts merely recklessly. Both cases had one crucial fact in common‚Äîneither Enmund nor the Tison brothers had committed an act of murder. Enmund had been in the getaway car; the Tison brothers had been fetching a jug of water for the Lyon family. If the death penalty is to be reserved for the worst murderers, Brennan believed in maintaining the distinction between an intentional act and a reckless one. \\"It is precisely in this context -- where the defendant has not killed -- that a finding that he or she nevertheless intended to kill seems indispensable to establishing capital culpability.\\" Yet the law had traditionally regarded reckless behavior to be less blameworthy than intentional behavior, because it recognizes the \\"freedom of the human will and a consequent ability and duty of the normal individual to choose between good and evil.\\" Because Enmund had not intended to kill the Kerseys, the Court had struck down his death sentence as not measurably contributing to either the goal of retribution or of deterrence. For Brennan, then, it was incongruous for the Court to hold in Tison that putting someone to death who had acted recklessly would. Brennan also faulted the Court for ignoring the states that had abolished the death penalty altogether when counting the states that authorized the death penalty for felony murder. \\"It is critical to examine not simply those jurisdictions that authorize the death penalty in a given circumstance, but those that actually impose it.\\" None of the 65 executions that had taken place after Enmund were carried out on a felony murderer who had not killed or intended to kill (as determined by a jury).

Latino Leadership Fund (not to be confused with the Hispanic College Fund, Hispanic Heritage Foundation or California Latino Leadership Institute) was an Oakland-based organization involved in multiple independent expenditures during California's Assembly District Elections in 2006. On June 10 and 11 of 2005, the California Latino Leadership Fund spent a total of $192,028 on independent expenditures within California's 43rd, 57th, and 34th Assembly District elections. Funding to the organization allegedly came from multiple sources, including PG&E;, Johnson & Johnson, and Cendant Corp. Controversy arose following alleged use of mass mailers and automated callers to non-Armenian voters labeling Krekorian and his wife, the Armenian National Committee of America (ANCA) and the Armenian community as ‚Äúterrorists‚Äù in a desperate attempt to scare away non-Armenian voters.  Spending history and funding  Campaign finance report consolidation organization Follow The Money published information regarding the California Latino Leadership Fund's spending during the 2006 California's Assembly District Elections. The organization found that the California Latino Leadership Fund spent $99,398 in support of California District 34's Lou Correa (Democrat) on June 11, $42,630 in support of California's District 57's Renee Chavez (Democrat), $31,567 in support of California District 43's Frank Quintero (Democrat) on June 10, and $18,433 on June 10 in opposition to Quintero's opponent, Paul Krekorian (Democrat). Funding to the organization allegedly came from tribal gaming groups, Pacific Gas and Electric, Johnson & Johnson, Inc., and Cendant Corp. Funding was also traced back to California's Latino Caucus. Due to the nature of the campaign spending done by the California Latino Leadership Fund, Quintero's campaign would have to break law to organize independent expenditures with a separate entity.  California's 43rd Assembly District 2006 Election Controversy  City Of Glendale request for investigation regarding 2006 distribution of controversial media fliers Leading up to California's 43rd Assembly District 2006 Election, campaign mailers and automated calls, allegedly funded by the California Latino Leadership Fund, were widely dispersed. These campaign mailers and automated calls attempted to link Quintero's Armenian-American opponent, Krekorian, to terrorism by way of the Armenian National Committee of America. The fliers attempted to draw connections between the Armenian National Committee of America, who endorsed Krekorian, and terrorist activities after a former Armenian National Committee leader was convicted in 2001 of possessing stolen explosives and assault weapons. This Armenian National Committee official had separated from the group following his conviction, and is no longer part of the organization. Following the campaign mailers and automated calls, Armenian voters turned out in large numbers to support Paul Krekorian. Throughout his campaign, Armenian Americans volunteered to support Krekorian in record numbers, including on the day of the election, during which time volunteers helped get out the vote, assisted at polling stations with translating while also monitoring and reporting problems and irregularities that occur during every election. During the weeks leading up to the election local the Armenian National Committee mounted an unprecedented voter education and get-out-the-vote campaign informing large numbers of voters of the issues at stake and getting people to vote. Upon the election's conclusion, Krekorian had won with 56.6% of the votes to Quintero‚Äôs 43.4%, with 100 percent of precincts reporting.  Reaction  Following the use of mailers and automated calls, city officials requested investigation by the state Attorney general Bill Lockyer into the campaign mailer. Quintero also pressed for an investigation, saying ' \\"I will either make the motion or second that motion. I've condemned the mailer when it first came out, and I've followed up with a letter to the attorney general and the secretary of state. ... We absolutely had no idea that was taking place.\\" \\"Councilman Bob Yousefian, a member of the council's Armenian-American majority and a Krekorian supporter, still faults Quintero for the mailer. 'It came out on a Friday night,' he said. 'On Friday night and Saturday, not once did Mr. Quintero come out and say he had nothing to do with it. If it was me, I would've been on TV Friday. ... Maybe the attorney general can get to the bottom of this.'\\" Quintero denied any knowledge or involvement with the Latino Leadership Fund or its activities. Quintero followed up by issuing mailers to the Latino Leadership Fund, stating his disapproval of the mailers in question.

Florida, 458 U.S. 782 (1982), is a United States Supreme Court case. It was a 5‚Äì4 decision in which the United States Supreme Court applied its capital proportionality principle, to set aside the death penalty for the driver of a getaway car, in a robbery-murder of an elderly Florida couple..  Background  While Earl Enmund sat outside in the getaway car, his accomplices Sampson and Jeanette Armstrong rang the doorbell of Thomas and Eunice Kersey, who lived at a farmhouse in Central Florida. When Thomas Kersey answered, Sampson Armstrong held him at gunpoint while Jeanette took his money. Eunice came out with a gun and shot Jeanette, wounding her. Sampson shot back and killed both of the Kerseys. The Armstrongs took all the Kerseys' money and then went back to the getaway car Enmund was driving. Enmund and the Armstrongs were indicted for first-degree murder and robbery. The judge instructed the jury that under Florida law, killing a human being while engaged in the perpetration or in the attempt to perpetrate a robbery is first-degree murder. Jeanette and Sampson Armstrong were convicted of first- degree murder. At a separate penalty hearing, the trial judge found that the murders were committed for pecuniary gain and were especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, and no statutory mitigating factors applied, and then sentenced Enmund to death. On appeal, the Florida Supreme Court rejected Enmund's contention that his death sentence was inappropriate because he did not kill or intend to kill the Kerseys. It held that the \\"felony murder rule and the law of principals combine to make a felon generally responsible for the lethal acts of his co-felon.\\"Enmund v. Florida, 399 So.2d 1362, 1370 (Fla. 1981).  Opinion of the Court  Justice White delivered the opinion of the Court. The question before the Court was whether death is a valid penalty under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments for one who neither took life, attempted to take life, nor intended to take life. The majority found that the record did not support a finding that Enmund killed or attempted to kill the Kerseys, and the record does not support a finding that Enmund intended to participate in the killing or facilitate the killing. Accordingly, the Court held the imposition of a sentence of death upon Enmund was prohibited by the Eighth Amendment because Enmund only \\"aided and abetted a felony in the course of which a murder is committed by others but who does not himself kill, attempt to kill, or intend that a killing take place or that lethal force will be employed.\\"  Concurring opinion  Justice Brennan delivered a concurring opinion and stated that the death penalty is a cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment in all circumstances.  Dissent  Justice O'Connor, joined by Chief Justice Burger, Justice Powell, and Justice Rehnquist, delivered the dissenting opinion, on the basis that the majority opinion interferes with state criteria for assessing guilt.

Arizona, 481 U.S. 137 (1987), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court qualified the rule it set forth in Enmund v. Florida (1982). Just as in Enmund, in Tison the Court applied the proportionality principle to conclude that the death penalty was an appropriate punishment for a felony murderer who was a major participant in the underlying felony and exhibited a reckless indifference to human life. Factual background This case stems from an infamous prison break during the summer of 1978. Gary Tison was serving a life sentence at the Arizona State Prison in Florence for killing a prison guard. His three sons, Donald, Ricky, and Raymond, plotted to break him and his cellmate, Randy Greenawalt, out of prison. On July 30, 1978, the sons entered the prison for a visit, taking advantage of a policy that allowed an informal picnic setting for weekend family visits, carrying an ice chest packed with revolvers and sawed-off shotguns. One of them aimed a sawed- off shotgun at a lobby guard. Greenawalt helped in the escape by cutting off telephones and alarm systems. They escaped in Donald Tison's 1969 Lincoln Continental, but the next day, one of the Lincoln's tires blew out on a stretch of road not far from the California border, near Quartzsite. Marine Sgt. John Lyons, 24, of Yuma, traveling with his wife, son, and niece on his way to visit family in Nebraska, stopped to help. While Raymond Tison was showing John Lyons the flat tire, the other escapees emerged from the brush. Raymond forced the Lyonses into the Lincoln, and then he and Donald drove the Lincoln down a service road. Meanwhile, the other Tisons transferred their belongings into the Lyonses' car, keeping the Lyonses' money and guns. Gary Tison shot out the radiator on the Lincoln and forced the Lyonses out. John Lyons began begging Gary Tison for his life; Gary Tison remarked that he was \\"thinking about\\" killing the Lyonses. Gary told Raymond and Ricky to go back to the Lyonses' car and get some water. According to Raymond, while they were gone, Gary started shooting the Lyonses; according to Ricky, the shooting began once they returned with the water. The two agreed that they had returned in time to watch the elder Tison and Greenawalt kill the Lyonses. Their bodies were found five days later. Then, in Colorado, police believe that on August 8 the gang murdered James Judge Jr. and his new wife, Margene. The Amarillo, Texas couple were honeymooning in southwestern Colorado at the time. (Their bodies were not found until November 1978, at a campsite near Pagosa Springs, Colorado.) The gang returned to Arizona, driving the Judges' van on Interstate 10, when they encountered a police roadblock. They ran the roadblock, and a shootout took place at a second roadblock, south of Casa Grande, Arizona. Donald Tison, who was driving the van, was killed at the scene; the others fled on foot. Raymond, Ricky, and Greenawalt were quickly caught, but Gary Tison escaped into the desert. Over 300 police officers and hundreds of volunteers searched for him, but he eluded them. He did not elude the August desert ‚Äî he died of exposure. His body was found eleven days after the shootout. Greenawalt and the surviving Tisons were charged with 92 crimes, including four counts of murder. (No charges were brought for the murder of the Judges, and Colorado authorities closed the cases when the surviving gang members were convicted in Arizona.) Criminal proceedings The two remaining Tison brothers were tried individually for capital murder in the deaths of the Lyonses. The murder charges were predicated on Arizona's felony-murder statute, which provided that killings that occurred during a robbery or kidnapping were first-degree, death-eligible murders. The Tison brothers were convicted. At a separate sentencing hearing, three aggravating factors were proved: the Tisons had created a grave risk of death to others, the murders were committed for pecuniary gain, and the murders were especially heinous, cruel, or depraved. The Arizona Supreme Court upheld the death sentences. In the intervening years, the Supreme Court decided Enmund v. Florida, leading the Tison brothers to bring a collateral attack on their sentences, claiming that Enmund required their death sentences to be struck down. The Arizona Supreme Court rejected this argument, asserting that the dictates of Enmund had been satisfied because the intent requirement of that case could be inferred from the fact that death was a foreseeable result of participating in a dangerous felony. Holding Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the majority, concluded that the death penalty would be appropriate for a murder like the ones the Tisons had been convicted of if it could be shown that the defendant was a major participant in the underlying felony and had acted with reckless indifference to human life. Later, the death penalties of Ricky and Raymond Tison were reduced to life sentences because they were both under 20 at the time of the crimes. Greenawalt was executed in 1997.

The expansion is uniform if all the edges are the same length. Animation showing an expanded cube (and octahedron) In geometry, expansion is a polytope operation where facets are separated and moved radially apart, and new facets are formed at separated elements (vertices, edges, etc.). Equivalently this operation can be imagined by keeping facets in the same position but reducing their size. The expansion of a regular polytope creates a uniform polytope, but the operation can be applied to any convex polytope, as demonstrated for polyhedra in Conway polyhedron notation. For polyhedra, an expanded polyhedron has all the faces of the original polyhedron, all the faces of the dual polyhedron, and new square faces in place of the original edges.  Expansion of regular polytopes  According to Coxeter, this multidimensional term was defined by Alicia Boole StottCoxeter, Regular Polytopes (1973), p. 123. p.210 for creating new polytopes, specifically starting from regular polytopes to construct new uniform polytopes. The expansion operation is symmetric with respect to a regular polytope and its dual. The resulting figure contains the facets of both the regular and its dual, along with various prismatic facets filling the gaps created between intermediate dimensional elements. It has somewhat different meanings by dimension. In a Wythoff construction, an expansion is generated by reflections from the first and last mirrors. In higher dimensions, lower dimensional expansions can be written with a subscript, so e2 is the same as t0,2 in any dimension. By dimension: * A regular {p} polygon expands into a regular 2n-gon. ** The operation is identical to truncation for polygons, e{p} = e1{p} = t0,1{p} = t{p} and has Coxeter-Dynkin diagram . * A regular {p,q} polyhedron (3-polytope) expands into a polyhedron with vertex figure p.4.q.4. **This operation for polyhedra is also called cantellation, e{p,q} = e2{p,q} = t0,2{p,q} = rr{p,q}, and has Coxeter diagram . **: 480px **: For example, a rhombicuboctahedron can be called an expanded cube, expanded octahedron, as well as a cantellated cube or cantellated octahedron. * A regular {p,q,r} 4-polytope (4-polytope) expands into a new 4-polytope with the original {p,q} cells, new cells {r,q} in place of the old vertices, p-gonal prisms in place of the old faces, and r-gonal prisms in place of the old edges. ** This operation for 4-polytopes is also called runcination, e{p,q,r} = e3{p,q,r} = t0,3{p,q,r}, and has Coxeter diagram . * Similarly a regular {p,q,r,s} 5-polytope expands into a new 5-polytope with facets {p,q,r}, {s,r,q}, {p,q}√óprisms, {s,r}√óprisms, and {p}√ó{s} duoprisms. ** This operation is called sterication, e{p,q,r,s} = e4{p,q,r,s} = t0,4{p,q,r,s} = 2r2r{p,q,r,s} and has Coxeter diagram . The general operator for expansion of a regular n-polytope is t0,n-1{p,q,r,...}.

It was originally released for the NEC PC-6001 and PC-8801 computers in 1984, in Japan only; ports for the MSX, MSX2, FM-7 and NEC PC-9801 were released the following year. A Famicom version was released under the name Hydlide Special in Japan in 1986. Three years later, it was localized and released in English regions for the Nintendo Entertainment System by Fujisankei Communications International, known as simply Hydlide. The game sold two million copies in Japan across all platforms. A 1995 remake was released for the Sega Saturn as Virtual Hydlide. Plot In the kingdom of Fairyland, three magic jewels were enshrined in the palace to maintain peace in the kingdom. One day, an evil man broke into the palace and stole one of the three magic jewels. Without the third jewel, the two remaining jewels lost their magic sparkle. The magic spell that sealed the power of Varalys, the most vicious demon in the kingdom, was broken. During the turmoil which followed, the last two jewels were stolen. Varalys cast a special magic on Princess Ann, turning her into three fairies, and hid her somewhere in the kingdom. He then let loose a horde of monsters across the land and became the ruler of the kingdom. Development The game was created by T&E; Soft's Tokohiro Naito. His idea behind Hydlide was to mix together action and RPG elements into a new \\"action RPG\\" genre. He was inspired by The Tower of Druaga and The Black Onyx, but said that The Black Onyx was not a direct influence, as Hydlides design leans more towards action rather than role-playing.John Szczepaniak (2016), The Untold History Of Japanese Game Developers, Volume 2, pages 38-49 Hydlide essentially took The Tower of Druaga formula to a colorful open world,1982-1987 - The Birth of Japanese RPGs, re-told in 15 Games, Gamasutra and added RPG mechanics. Naito noted that he was completely unaware of Western role-playing games like Ultima and Wizardry when he was developing Hydlide, as he had never used the Apple II before. He said that he only became aware of two other Japanese action RPG projects, Dragon Slayer and Courageous Perseus, while reading a magazine during Hydlides development, and was shocked to find that Hydlide was not the only attempt at the concept. He underestimated Dragon Slayer but felt threatened by Courageous Perseus, believing the latter to be more visually impressive; Courageous Perseus turned out to be not as successful, whereas Dragon Slayer went on to become Hydlides biggest competitor, through subsequent sequels. Reception Original PC-8801 version Hydlide was well- received and considered an innovator when released in Japan back in 1984. Hydlide was one of the first action role-playing games, along with Courageous Perseus and Dragon Slayer.Kurt Kalata, Dragon Slayer , Hardcore Gaming 101 Hydlide was also an early open world game, rewarding exploration in an open world environment.http://in.ign.com/india/82586/feature/ign-india-discusses- game-design-combat-in-open-world-games It also had the ability to switch between attack mode and defense mode, quick save and load options which can be used at any moment of the game, and the introduction of a health regeneration mechanic where health slowly regenerates when standing still. It sold 2 million copies in Japan, including 1 million for home computers (including the PC-88, PC-98, PC-66, Sharp X1, FM7, MSX, MSX2, and MZ-2000) and 1 million for the Famicom console.John Szczepaniak, History of Japanese Video Games, Kinephanos, ISSN 1916-985X It was the first computer game to receive a Platinum award from Toshiba EMI for a million sales. However, it failed to capture the same attention beyond Japan. The game was influential on the action RPG genre, including titles such as Ys. For example, Ys uses a similar health-regeneration mechanic. The recharging health mechanic first introduced by Hydlide in 1984 would, decades later, become a common mechanic widely used in many video games, (cf. ) including shooter games such as Halo. Hydlides open world game design inspired Hideo Kojima, who designed Metal Gear Solid V so that it captures the open-world feel he felt when he first played Hydlide on PC.https://twitter.com/hideo_kojima_en/status/470783176634163200 PlatinumGames director Hideki Kamiya was inspired by the Hydlide series, which he cited as an influence on Scalebound, an open world action RPG.http://www.polygon.com/a/life-in-japan/Hideki-Kamiya- Scaleboundhttp://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-08-07-scalebound-is-a- different-kind-of-platinum-game Hydlide was initially released outside of Japan through the European release of the MSX version. Beyond that, 1989 saw the release of a localization of Hydlide Special for the NES, simply titled Hydlide itself. Unlike Dragon Quest 1, which was improved upon for its US localization, Hydlide was left essentially unaltered beyond minor changes to the title screen and some prompts/messages. It received a negative reception, often compared unfavorably to The Legend of Zelda (1986), which had improved significantly upon Hydlide. The NES version of Hydlide became notorious in the West for its repetitive background music that bears similarity to John Williams' Indiana Jones theme or Disney's It's a Small World After All. Legacy Hydlide had several follow-ups: * Hydlide II: Shine of Darkness was originally released for the NEC PC-8801 in 1985 and then ported to the MSX in Japan. An official English version was released through the Dutch MSX games distribution platform WOOMB.net in late 2006, the first official release outside Japan. The game introduced a morality meter, where the player can be aligned with Justice, Normal, or Evil. Killing humans or good monsters lowers the player's morality, while fighting evil monsters increases it. If the player has an evil alignment, the townsfolk will ignore the player, denying access to certain clues, dialogues, equipment, and training. The game also introduced a time option, allowing the player to speed up or slow down the gameplay. * Hydlide 3: The Space Memories was released in 1987 for the MSX in Japan; a Family Computer version (with the subtitle Èóá„Åã„Çâ„ÅÆË®™ÂïèËÄÖ = yami kara no h≈çmonsha = visitor from darkness) was released in Japan in 1989. The game retains the morality meter of its predecessor and expands the time option with an in-game clock and a need to sleep and eat. The game uses four distinct character classes. This game was also re-released through the Dutch MSX games distribution platform WOOMB.net in late 2006, with an English translation. Super Hydlide is an updated port of Hydlide 3 released for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. It was released in Japan in 1989, in North America in 1990, and in Europe in 1991. * Virtual Hydlide is a 1995 remake of Hydlide, still developed by T&E; Soft but released exclusively for the Sega Saturn. It uses pseudo-3D graphics, a live action player character, and a system which creates a new game world for each game by randomly selecting from sets of pre- designed level maps.

The bay is primarily known for Cockle Bay Wharf, a waterfront entertainment area designed by Eric Kuhne that includes a wide variety of restaurants, pubs, clubs, cafes and function venues. History When the First Fleet reached Sydney Cove in January 1788, the convict transport Scarborough also carried 5,000 bricks and 12 wooden moulds for making bricks. This token consignment sufficed for the first settlers to make a start on the colony's first buildings, until they could find a suitable site for brick-making. Brick-making required a plentiful supply of clay and a ready source of fresh water. Approximately a mile from the settlement, at the head of a long cove (and consequently so named), a suitable site for brick-making was located.

Studies of the X chromosome as well as the entire human genome have linked Xq28 to the heredity of homosexuality in human males. Xq28 is a chromosome band and genetic marker situated at the tip of the X chromosome which has been studied since at least 1980. The band contains three distinct regions, totaling about 8 Mbp of genetic information. The marker came to the public eye in 1993 when studies by Dean Hamer and others indicated a link between the Xq28 marker and male sexual orientation. Initial linkage The 1993 study by Hamer et al. examined 114 families of gay men in the United States and found increased rates of homosexuality among maternal uncles and cousins, but not among paternal relatives. This pattern of inheritance suggested that there might be linked genes on the X chromosome, since males always inherit their copy of the X chromosome from their mothers. Polymorphisms of genetic markers of the X chromosome were analyzed for 40 families to see if a specific marker was shared by a disproportionate amount of brothers who were both gay. The results showed that among gay brothers, the concordance rate for markers from the Xq28 region were significantly greater than expected for random Mendelian segregation, indicating that a link did exist in that small sample. It was concluded that at least one form of male homosexuality is preferentially transmitted through the maternal side and is genetically linked to the Xq28 region. A follow-up study, Hu et al. (1995), conducted by the Hamer lab in collaboration with two groups of statistical experts in 1995, corroborated the original results for males with homosexual brothers sharing Xq28 at significantly elevated rates. This study also included heterosexual brothers, who showed significantly less than expected sharing of the Xq28 region, as expected for a genetic locus that in one form is associated with same-sex attraction and in another form is associated with opposite-sex attraction. In this study no link to Xq28 was found among homosexual females, indicating a different genetic pathway as for most sex- specific phenotypes. Hamer's findings were highlighted in scientific journals including Science, Nature and the topic of a mini-symposium in Scientific American. Controversy In June 1994, an article in the Chicago Tribune by John Crewdson stated that an anonymous junior researcher in Hamer's laboratory alleged that Hamer selectively presented the data in his 1993 paper in the journal Science. The junior researcher had assisted in the gene mapping in Hamer's 1993 study. Shortly after voicing her questions, she was summarily dismissed from her post-doctoral fellowship in Hamer's lab; who dismissed her could not be determined. Later, she was given another position in a different lab. Hamer stated that Crewdson's article was \\"seriously in error\\" and denied the allegations made against him. An official inquiry launched by the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) to investigate the allegations of selective presentation of the data ended in December 1996. It determined that Hamer had not committed any scientific misconduct in his study. Subsequent studies Two further studies in the 1990s gave mixed results. One was an X chromosome linkage analysis of 54 pairs of gay brothers carried out by the independent research group of Sanders et al. in 1998. The results of the study were indistinguishable from the results of the study by Hu et al.: both reported that the chromosomal location of maximum sharing was locus DXS1108 and both reported similar degrees of allele sharing (66% versus 67%). The second study by Rice et al. in 1999 studied 52 pairs of Canadian gay brothers and found no statistically significant linkage in alleles and haplotypes. Consequently, they concluded against the possibility of any gene in the Xq28 region having a large genetic influence on male sexual orientation (though they could not rule out the possibility of a gene in this region having a small influence). Rice et al. also asserted that their results do not exclude the possibility of finding male homosexuality genes elsewhere in the genome. Hamer criticized the study for not selecting families for their study population based on maternal transmission as selecting only families that show an excess of maternal gay relatives is necessary to detect the Xq28 linkage. A meta-analysis of all data available at that time (i.e., Hamer et al. (1993), Hu et al. (1995), Rice et al. (1999), and the unpublished 1998 study by Sanders et al. indicated that Xq28 has a significant but not exclusive role in male sexual orientation. The authors of the meta-analysis (which included three authors of the Rice et al. study, Rice, Risch and Ebers) presented several methodological reasons due to which Rice et al. (1999) may have been unable to detect statistically significant linkage between Xq28 and male sexual orientation: the families genotyped by Rice et al. were non-representative as they had an excess of paternal instead of maternal gay relatives thus obscuring the display of any X-chromosome linkage; the statistical power of their sample was insufficient to adequately detect linkage and they lacked definite criteria for what constituted as homosexuality (the researchers depended on their own judgement and sometimes based their judgement on a single question to the subject). They also lacked criteria \\"to select appropriate families for the study of a putative X-linked locus\\" ‚Äî as they did not select families based on the presence of maternal transmission of homosexuality, the Xq28 contribution to male sexual orientation may have been hidden. In addition, the meta-analysis revealed that the family pedigree data of Rice et al. (1999), in contrast to the genotyping data, seemed to support X chromosome linkage for homosexuality. In 2012, a large, comprehensive genome-wide linkage study of male sexual orientation was conducted by several independent groups of researchers. The study population included 409 independent pairs of gay brothers from 384 families, who were analyzed with over 300,000 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers. The study confirmed the Xq28 linkage to homosexuality by two-point and multipoint (MERLIN) LOD score mapping. Significant linkage was also detected in the region near the centromere of chromosome 8, overlapping with one of the regions detected in a previous genomewide linkage study by the Hamer lab. The authors concluded that \\"our findings, taken in context with previous work, suggest that genetic variation in each of these regions contributes to development of the important psychological trait of male sexual orientation.\\" It was the largest study of the genetic basis of homosexuality to date and was published online in November 2014.Bob Grant for The Scientist. November 19, 2014 Zeroing in on the ‚ÄúGay Gene‚Äù The largest study yet of the genetic roots of homosexuality links sexual preference in men to two regions of the genome In August 2019, a genome-wide association study of 493,001 individuals concluded that hundreds or thousands of genetic variants underlie homosexual behavior in both sexes, with 5 variants in particular being significantly associated. They stated that in contrast to linkage studies that found substantial association of sexual orientation with variants on the X-chromosome, they found no excess of signal (and no individual genome-wide significant variants) on Xq28 or the rest of the X chromosome. Other contents Xq28 is a large, complex, and gene dense region. Among its various genes are the 12 genes of the melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE) family, of which MAGEA11 has been identified as a coregulator for the androgen receptor. Mutations involving the production of extra copies of the MECP2 and IRAK1 genes within Xq28 have been associated with phenotypes including anxiety and autism in mice.

His father gave him a set of tools at age 6. By 8, he had built a set of farm machinery, by 10, a threshing machine that husked corn, and by 12 he was making car motors. Following his graduation from Ohio State with a combined master's degree in physics, mathematics, and astronomy in 1939, McMaster worked as the first research physicist ever employed by the Libbey Owens Ford Glass in Toledo, Ohio.The Founding Family, McMaster School for Advancing Humanity He received his first patent during WWII for a periscope used by fighter pilots to see behind them.Harold McMaster Permaglass In 1948, he started his own company, Permaglass, in Genoa, Ohio. Permaglass produced curved and tempered glass for the consumer and automotive markets. Within 3 months, he was producing glass for appliances, and for display cases; within 3 years, Permaglass was a leading manufacturer of glass plates for television sets. As the auto and electronics industries boomed in the 1950s, Permaglass was very successful. McMaster merged Permaglass into Guardian Industries of Detroit, Michigan in 1969, creating the third-largest glass company in the world, and left the company in 1971.

However, McMaster, was \\"recognized as the world's leading authority on tempering glass, that is, compressing glass to add tensile strength\\" \\"Department of Physics Distinguished Alumni Award,\\" in Ohio State University Department of Physics Magazine Sept. 24, 2003 and Glasstech essentially created the market for tempered glass, receiving not only the sticker price, but also a royalty on glass produced, for machines that produce 80% of the world‚Äôs automotive glass.  Solar cells  Inspired by a vacation in sunny Arizona, McMaster began another company, Glasstech Solar, in 1984, to produce cost-effective solar arrays. His insight was that the essential cost element of large area solar arrays was glass, and he could treat the actual solar cell as simply a different kind of coating on glass. After doing little except absorbing $12 million cash, McMaster gave up on the amorphous silicon research, offered to pay back the 57 investors who followed him into solar cells. He then raised yet another $15 million to create Solar Cells Inc. in Toledo OH to work on a different thin-film technology, cadmium telluride photovoltaics. By 1997, Solar Cells had a prototype production machine. In 1995, he brought in a new president, and bought still more stock in the company to fund research, although the company had yet to pay a dividend. According to Ken Zweibel, former head of the Thin Film Partnership program at the Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory, SCI was clearly the industry leader in thin-film photovoltaic technology.

It was based on a successful stage play of the same name written by Erik Jensen and Jessica Blank and first aired on the former CourtTV cable television network on January 27, 2005. It is directed by Bob Balaban was produced by Radical Media. Actors played the roles of the five men and one woman. It stars David Brown, Jr. (the only cast member to have appeared in the stage play - he played Robert Earl Hayes), Brian Dennehy as Gary Gauger, Danny Glover as David Keaton, Delroy Lindo as Delbert Tibbs, Aidan Quinn as Kerry Max Cook and Susan Sarandon as Sonia \\"Sunny\\" Jacobs. The script was based on the exonerees' personal experiences as well as court records and media accounts. Jessica Blank, who is married to Erik Jensen, got the idea for the play when she moved from Minneapolis, Minnesota to New York City. She and Jensen attended a conference about the death penalty and listened to stories about wrongful convictions and confessions gained via torture, threats and deception. The couple spent the summer of 2000 interviewing exonerees throughout the United States and adapted the stories of six people into a script. The play was first presented in New York City; the final performance was in Minneapolis in 2002. For their efforts, Jensen and Blank received the Champion of Justice Award from the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.

In 2011, she married Peter Pringle, who had himself been exonerated after being sentenced to death in Ireland for the murder of two officers of the Garda S√≠och√°na, the Irish police force, Henry Byrne and John Morley. The officers were shot while chasing three armed masked men who had robbed a bank and were fleeing the crime scene. Their car collided with the getaway vehicle and the robbers opened fire. In Ireland, the murders caused national outrage.

He was eventually freed in 1979 after serving time for an unrelated charge. At the end of the movie, each actor is voiced over by the real life exonerees and then fades to show them as their current selves at the time of filming.

Named after St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, the school was established in 1954 and is staffed by the Sisters of Charity of Seton Hill. History Originally known as \\"Seton High School\\" or later as \\"Seton Catholic High School\\", the school opened in 1954 in downtown Chandler. Initially founded as a parish school, Seton began to operate under the supervision of the Diocese of Phoenix as a diocesan school beginning in 1973. On September 12, 1980, a fire begun by one of the students destroyed much of the old campus, including eight classrooms in two buildings; the school would temporarily operate from the remaining classroom building, administration building, and gym. The fire, which caused $800,000 in damage, was found to have been started by three minors‚Äîone a student‚Äîafter the latter got into an argument with a teacher. At the time of the fire, the school had 130 students. After the fire, the school opted to relocate from downtown Chandler to a site more centrally located to serve the growing cities of Tempe, Mesa, and Chandler, which would allow the school to increase its enrollment. The school moved into the so-called Tri-City Campus in 1983 (and was even known as \\"Seton Catholic Tri-City High School\\" for a time in the 1980s); the former site was converted into a Boys and Girls Club. That fall, the school reached a then-all-time high for enrollment, 259 students. Though Seton entered the 1990s at enrollment levels lower than any seen since the new campus, it jumped to 343 students in 1994, when it broke ground on a new gymnasium, and to 493 students‚Äîthe highest in its history‚Äîby 1999. In the 1990s, the school also built six new science classrooms. The 1990s and 2000s were times of similarly prolific growth in the East Valley. As the only Catholic high school located centrally enough to serve the area, Seton continued to reap rewards in enrollment growth. At its height, in the fall of 2004, Seton had 604 students‚Äîa school record. In 2008, following a massive undertaking to secure funds for the construction, the school completed its new copper-domed chapel, located on land that had housed the school's football field. In May 2009, the school was officially renamed Seton Catholic Preparatory High School; the name was shortened to Seton Catholic Preparatory in 2014. In February 2010, the school broke ground on a new, two-story academic building and black box theater complex, which opened to students in 2011.

Description It is south-south-west of Yambuk, and south-west of Port Fairy. The island is about in length by in width, with an area of , comprising a plateau, varying in height from asl, surrounded by cliffs, rock platforms and reefs. It contains an important seal breeding colony. It has a long history of human exploitation, which has drastically affected its vegetation communities, though it is now protected as a State Faunal Reserve. It is listed on Australia's Register of the National Estate. It is best viewed from The Crags or Yambuk Lake, both of which are in the Yambuk area. History Deen Maar was well known to the Gunditjmara people; it is believed that the spirits of the dead were conveyed across the sea to the island from a cave called Tarnwirring (\\"the flowing of the wind\\") at the top of a rocky sea cliff. The island was also known as Tirngoona, meaning \\"where the sun go away longa night\\". The island was given the name \\"Lady Julia‚Äôs Island\\" in 1800 by Lt James Grant after either the wife or daughter of Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland. In 1802 Matthew Flinders expanded the name to Lady Julia Percy's Island as he sailed past on his ship the . Also in 1802, Nicolas Baudin sailed past the island in his ship the G√©ographe, and recorded the island as Ile aux Alouettes, a name that has not persisted. During the early 19th century, sealing took place with sealing gangs living on the island often for months at a time. There are two graves on the island ‚Äì one of a sealer buried in 1822, and one of a man named Hardman buried in 1828 by Captain Wishart of the Fairy., quoting the Portland Mercury Guano was mined on the island for fertiliser until 1861, being transported to Port Fairy in barges. In January 1936 a scientific expedition from Melbourne University's McCoy Society visited the island for six weeks and carried out a comprehensive ecological survey.Jones, 1936 Environment=Geology Formed some seven million years ago, the island is much older than other volcanoes in the region, and is also unusual in being built by both submarine and terrestrial eruptions. It provides exposures of internal volcanic structure, including a volcanic vent. Six successive lava flows can be seen in the coastal cliffs. It is Australia‚Äôs only off-shore volcano and the only large basalt island off the coast of western Victoria. Lady Julia Percy Island is considered part of the Newer Volcanics Province ‚Äî this polycyclic volcano erupted in two phases, at 7.80 ¬± 0.08 Ma and 6.22 ¬± 0.06 Ma Flora With regard to the flora, Frederic Wood Jones said in 1936 of the island, following his leadership of the 1936 McCoy Society expedition: > \\"A century ago it was covered with a dense, almost impenetrable, growth of > the mixed bushy scrub that characterizes certain parts of the coast of the > adjacent mainland. Some sixty years ago this dense scrub was still standing > over the major portion of the island; but to-day the whole of the plateau is > devoid of any growth more majestic than bracken fern and thistles. The whole > plateau is, at present, a windswept area, clothed only by vegetation knee- > high at the best, and at the worst, by loose volcanic soil or bare rock. > This denudation of forest cover is due to human interference, for pigs were > at one time turned down on the island, rabbits were liberated and are still > living in their thousands, and sealers, fishermen and guano workers have cut > down and burned the stunted and wind-blown trees that formerly covered the > island.\\" The landscape of the island's plateau is now bleak and windswept. It lacks trees and is still largely covered with grasses and bracken on thin black soil. The dominant vegetation communities are grassland and closed fernland. The vulnerable Shore Spleenwort (Asplenium obtusatum) still survives there. Fauna The island is one of four Australian fur seal breeding colonies in Victoria and, with an estimated 27,000 seals, is the largest such colony in Australia. It is occasionally visited by Australian sea lions and southern elephant seals. Pigs and rabbits were previously introduced but have since disappeared or been eradicated. The island is home to breeding little penguins (2000 pairs), common diving-petrels (1000 pairs), fairy prions (1000 pairs), and short-tailed shearwaters (15,000 pairs). White's skink is the only reptile present. The surrounding waters are visited by great white sharks.Australian Heritage Database Access Access to Lady Julia Percy Island itself is restricted, and landing is by permit only. However, boat cruises from Port Fairy to the waters around the island are popular; they allow people to see the seal colony and watch whales and seabirds on the way.

The screenplay is based on Jordan's family's efforts to salvage their Brooklyn-based wholesale and retail seafood operation when the bank defaulted on a loan they had secured to finance a restaurant extension to the business. Plot Frank Giorgio's life is thrown into chaos when the bank that loaned him money for a restaurant addition to his seafood business folds and the FDIC demands he repay the loan in full immediately. With the threat of a public auction looming, the very proud and stubborn Frank, his family, and eccentric crew rally to save the business. Frank's son Michael, who works in the tech world of Seattle, and his girlfriend Kerry return home for Christmas and are dragged into the family drama. Michael's childhood home has been sold, and his mother Maureen, who has separated from Frank and is hoping to establish her own identity apart from the business that has consumed her life, is scheduled to move into a rental house after the holidays. Over the course of two weeks, Michael finds himself sleeping on a pull-out couch with his father in Frank's office, catching wandering lobster crates in the bay, and trying to mend his relationship with Kerry after his father assaults her uncle. Meanwhile, his sister Lauren, who has worked with her father since graduating from college, is striving to keep the lines of communication open among all the family members. In the end, Frank's longtime customer and friend Bill Lau offers the highest bid on the property, with the idea he and Frank will complete construction of the restaurant and operate it as partners. Production In a bonus feature on the DVD release of the film, Kevin and Darren Jordan discuss family events that inspired them to develop the film. In 1938, their grandfather established a seafood business on Bleecker Street in Manhattan, and later moved it to a waterfront location in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn where, under the name Jordan's Lobster Dock, it became a popular local landmark. Their father Bill decided to expand the operation by adding a restaurant, but midway through construction the bank that loaned him money to finance the project failed, and the FDIC demanded full repayment of the loan, placing the family in a financial bind. The film was shot in less than five weeks on the actual site of the Jordan business, as well as in Chinatown and Rockville Centre. All members of Jordan's immediate family had cameo roles. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and was shown at the Hamptons International Film Festival, the Avignon Film Festival, and the Bahamas International Film Festival. It went into theatrical release in the US on November 4, 2005, and earned $11,729 in two theaters on its opening weekend.

Description  When seen at a distance, it resembles a small kauri in its overall appearance. It can be usually distinguished by its juvenile foliage, which often remains on the lower branches until the tree grows to approximately 10 metres tall. The tree ultimately reaches a height of about 25 metres, with a trunk up to 1 metre thick and grey-brown bark that has a rough, pustular texture. The pale reddish-brown wood is strong and durable. The leaves of the younger trees and on the lower branches of the adults are narrow and to some extent leathery, up to 4 cm long and 3 mm wide. The adult leaves are thick, scale-like and much smaller; the leaves overlap and lie appressed to the branchlets in 4 rows.

She served as a commissioned ship for 9 months. Sidonia (AKA-42) was laid down on 1 February 1945 under Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1903) by the Walsh-Kaiser Co., Inc., Providence, R.I.; launched on 7 April 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Gustave Metzman; and commissioned on 30 April 1945, Lt. Comdr. Charles E. Earl in command. Service history Sidonia's sea trials were interrupted when she struck a derelict off Cape Cod on 11 May 1945, and repairs to her port propeller and to metallurgical defects in her port shafting lasted until 31 May. The ship arrived at Norfolk on 3 June and underwent shakedown in Hampton Roads and Chesapeake Bay from 4-13 June. After post-shakedown repairs, she sailed on 23 June for France, arriving at Marseilles on 4 July. There she loaded 216 troops with their supplies and sailed on 14 July for the Pacific, transiting the Panama Canal on 28 and 29 July, and calling at Eniwetok from 18-21 August. On 22 August, Sidonia's starboard engine was disabled by an electrical ground, and it remained out of commission during the rest of the ship's career. Sidonia arrived at Lingayen Gulf on 31 August and disembarked her troops and cargo. On 13 September, a fire disabled her port engine, and repairs lasted until 24 September. The ship arrived at Manila on 29 September and departed on 7 October with 322 homeward- bound servicemen, whom she disembarked at Portland, Oregon, on 9 November.

Although girls typically begin the process of puberty at age 10 or 11, and boys at age 11 or 12, criteria for pedophilia extend the cut-off point for prepubescence to age 13. A person must be at least 16 years old, and at least five years older than the prepubescent child, for the attraction to be diagnosed as pedophilia. Pedophilia is termed pedophilic disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), and the manual defines it as a paraphilia involving intense and recurrent sexual urges towards and fantasies about prepubescent children that have either been acted upon or which cause the person with the attraction distress or interpersonal difficulty. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) defines it as a \\"sustained, focused, and intense pattern of sexual arousal‚Äîas manifested by persistent sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges, or behaviours‚Äîinvolving pre-pubertal children.\\" In popular usage, the word pedophilia is often applied to any sexual interest in children or the act of child sexual abuse. This use conflates the sexual attraction to prepubescent children with the act of child sexual abuse and fails to distinguish between attraction to prepubescent and pubescent or post-pubescent minors. Researchers recommend that these imprecise uses be avoided, because although some people who commit child sexual abuse are pedophiles, child sexual abuse offenders are not pedophiles unless they have a primary or exclusive sexual interest in prepubescent children, and some pedophiles do not molest children. Pedophilia was first formally recognized and named in the late 19th century. A significant amount of research in the area has taken place since the 1980s. Although mostly documented in men, there are also women who exhibit the disorder, and researchers assume available estimates underrepresent the true number of female pedophiles. No cure for pedophilia has been developed, but there are therapies that can reduce the incidence of a person committing child sexual abuse. The exact causes of pedophilia have not been conclusively established. Some studies of pedophilia in child sex offenders have correlated it with various neurological abnormalities and psychological pathologies. In the United States, following Kansas v. Hendricks in 1997, sex offenders who are diagnosed with certain mental disorders, particularly pedophilia, can be subject to indefinite involuntary commitment. Definitions The word pedophilia comes from the Greek œÄŒ±·øñœÇ, œÄŒ±ŒπŒ¥œåœÇ (pa√Æs, paid√≥s), meaning \\"child\\", and œÜŒπŒªŒØŒ± (phil√≠a), \\"friendly love\\" or \\"friendship\\". Pedophilia is used for individuals with a primary or exclusive sexual interest in prepubescent children aged 13 or younger. Infantophilia is a sub-type of pedophilia; it is used to refer to a sexual preference for children under the age of 5 (especially infants and toddlers). This is sometimes referred to as nepiophilia (from the (n√©pios) meaning \\"infant\\" or \\"child,\\" which in turn derives from \\"ne-\\" and \\"epos\\" meaning \\"not speaking\\"), though this term is rarely used in academic sources. Hebephilia is defined as individuals with a primary or exclusive sexual interest in 11- to 14-year-old pubescents. The DSM-5 does not list hebephilia among the diagnoses; while evidence suggests that hebephilia is separate from pedophilia, the ICD-10 includes early pubertal age (an aspect of hebephilia) in its pedophilia definition, covering the physical development overlap between the two philias. In addition to hebephilia, some clinicians have proposed other categories that are somewhat or completely distinguished from pedophilia; these include pedohebephilia (a combination of pedophilia and hebephilia) and ephebophilia (though ephebophilia is not considered pathological).APA DSM-5  U 03 Pedophilic Disorder Signs and symptoms=Development Pedophilia emerges before or during puberty, and is stable over time. It is self-discovered, not chosen. For these reasons, pedophilia has been described as a disorder of sexual preference, phenomenologically similar to a heterosexual or homosexual orientation. These observations, however, do not exclude pedophilia from the group of mental disorders because pedophilic acts cause harm, and mental health professionals can sometimes help pedophiles to refrain from harming children. In response to misinterpretations that the American Psychiatric Association considers pedophilia a sexual orientation because of wording in its printed DSM-5 manual, which distinguishes between paraphilia and what it calls \\"paraphilic disorder\\", subsequently forming a division of \\"pedophilia\\" and \\"pedophilic disorder\\", the association commented: \\"'[S]exual orientation' is not a term used in the diagnostic criteria for pedophilic disorder and its use in the DSM-5 text discussion is an error and should read 'sexual interest.'\\" They added, \\"In fact, APA considers pedophilic disorder a 'paraphilia,' not a 'sexual orientation.' This error will be corrected in the electronic version of DSM-5 and the next printing of the manual.\\" They said they strongly support efforts to criminally prosecute those who sexually abuse and exploit children and adolescents, and \\"also support continued efforts to develop treatments for those with pedophilic disorder with the goal of preventing future acts of abuse.\\" Comorbidity and personality traits Studies of pedophilia in child sex offenders often report that it co-occurs with other psychopathologies, such as low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and personality problems. It is not clear whether these are features of the disorder itself, artifacts of sampling bias, or consequences of being identified as a sex offender. One review of the literature concluded that research on personality correlates and psychopathology in pedophiles is rarely methodologically correct, in part owing to confusion between pedophiles and child sex offenders, as well as the difficulty of obtaining a representative, community sample of pedophiles.Okami, P. & Goldberg, A. (1992). \\"Personality Correlates of Pedophilia: Are They Reliable Indicators?\\", Journal of Sex Research, Vol. 29, No. 3, pp. 297‚Äì328. \\"For example, because an unknown percentage of true pedophiles may never act on their impulses or may never be arrested, forensic samples of sex offenders against minors clearly do not represent the population of \\"pedophiles\\", and many such persons apparently do not even belong to the population of \\"pedophiles\\".\\" Seto (2004) points out that pedophiles who are available from a clinical setting are likely there because of distress over their sexual preference or pressure from others. This increases the likelihood that they will show psychological problems. Similarly, pedophiles recruited from a correctional setting have been convicted of a crime, making it more likely that they will show anti-social characteristics. Impaired self-concept and interpersonal functioning were reported in a sample of child sex offenders who met the diagnostic criteria for pedophilia by Cohen et al. (2002), which the authors suggested could contribute to motivation for pedophilic acts. The pedophilic offenders in the study had elevated psychopathy and cognitive distortions compared to healthy community controls. This was interpreted as underlying their failure to inhibit their criminal behavior. Studies in 2009 and 2012 found that non- pedophilic child sex offenders exhibited psychopathy, but pedophiles did not. Wilson and Cox (1983) studied the characteristics of a group of pedophile club members. The most marked differences between pedophiles and controls were on the introversion scale, with pedophiles showing elevated shyness, sensitivity and depression. The pedophiles scored higher on neuroticism and psychoticism, but not enough to be considered pathological as a group. The authors caution that \\"there is a difficulty in untangling cause and effect. We cannot tell whether paedophiles gravitate towards children because, being highly introverted, they find the company of children less threatening than that of adults, or whether the social withdrawal implied by their introversion is a result of the isolation engendered by their preference i.e., awareness of the social [dis]approbation and hostility that it evokes\\" (p. 324). In a non- clinical survey, 46% of pedophiles reported that they had seriously considered suicide for reasons related to their sexual interest, 32% planned to carry it out, and 13% had already attempted it. A review of qualitative research studies published between 1982 and 2001 concluded that child sexual abusers use cognitive distortions to meet personal needs, justifying abuse by making excuses, redefining their actions as love and mutuality, and exploiting the power imbalance inherent in all adult‚Äìchild relationships. Other cognitive distortions include the idea of \\"children as sexual beings\\", uncontrollability of sexual behavior, and \\"sexual entitlement-bias\\". Child pornography Consumption of child pornography is a more reliable indicator of pedophilia than molesting a child, although some non-pedophiles also view child pornography. Child pornography may be used for a variety of purposes, ranging from private sexual gratification or trading with other collectors, to preparing children for sexual abuse as part of the child grooming process. Pedophilic viewers of child pornography are often obsessive about collecting, organizing, categorizing, and labeling their child pornography collection according to age, gender, sex act and fantasy. According to FBI agent Ken Lanning, \\"collecting\\" pornography does not mean that they merely view pornography, but that they save it, and \\"it comes to define, fuel, and validate their most cherished sexual fantasies\\". Lanning states that the collection is the single best indicator of what the offender wants to do, but not necessarily of what has been or will be done. Researchers Taylor and Quayle reported that pedophilic collectors of child pornography are often involved in anonymous internet communities dedicated to extending their collections. Causes Although what causes pedophilia is not yet known, researchers began reporting a series of findings linking pedophilia with brain structure and function, beginning in 2002. Testing individuals from a variety of referral sources inside and outside the criminal justice system as well as controls, these studies found associations between pedophilia and lower IQs, poorer scores on memory tests, greater rates of non-right-handedness, greater rates of school grade failure over and above the IQ differences, lesser physical height, greater probability of having suffered childhood head injuries resulting in unconsciousness, and several differences in MRI-detected brain structures. Such studies suggest that there are one or more neurological characteristics present at birth that cause or increase the likelihood of being pedophilic. Some studies have found that pedophiles are less cognitively impaired than non-pedophilic child molesters. A 2011 study reported that pedophilic child molesters had deficits in response inhibition, but no deficits in memory or cognitive flexibility. Evidence of familial transmittability \\"suggests, but does not prove that genetic factors are responsible\\" for the development of pedophilia. A 2015 study indicated that pedophilic offenders have a normal IQ. Another study, using structural MRI, indicated that male pedophiles have a lower volume of white matter than a control group. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has indicated that child molesters diagnosed with pedophilia have reduced activation of the hypothalamus as compared with non-pedophilic persons when viewing sexually arousing pictures of adults. A 2008 functional neuroimaging study notes that central processing of sexual stimuli in heterosexual \\"paedophile forensic inpatients\\" may be altered by a disturbance in the prefrontal networks, which \\"may be associated with stimulus-controlled behaviours, such as sexual compulsive behaviours\\". The findings may also suggest \\"a dysfunction at the cognitive stage of sexual arousal processing\\". Blanchard, Cantor, and Robichaud (2006) reviewed the research that attempted to identify hormonal aspects of pedophiles.Blanchard, R., Cantor, J. M., & Robichaud, L. K. (2006). Biological factors in the development of sexual deviance and aggression in males. In They concluded that there is some evidence that pedophilic men have less testosterone than controls, but that the research is of poor quality and that it is difficult to draw any firm conclusion from it. While not causes of pedophilia themselves, childhood abuse by adults or comorbid psychiatric illnesses‚Äîsuch as personality disorders and substance abuse‚Äîare risk factors for acting on pedophilic urges. Blanchard, Cantor, and Robichaud addressed comorbid psychiatric illnesses that, \\"The theoretical implications are not so clear. Do particular genes or noxious factors in the prenatal environment predispose a male to develop both affective disorders and pedophilia, or do the frustration, danger, and isolation engendered by unacceptable sexual desires‚Äîor their occasional furtive satisfaction‚Äîlead to anxiety and despair?\\" They indicated that, because they previously found mothers of pedophiles to be more likely to have undergone psychiatric treatment, the genetic possibility is more likely. A study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 heterosexual men by using the Wilson Sex Fantasy Questionnaire exam determined that males with a pronounced degree of paraphilic interest (including pedophilia) had a greater number of older brothers, a high 2D:4D digit ratio (which would indicate low prenatal androgen exposure), and an elevated probability of being left-handed, suggesting that disturbed hemispheric brain lateralization may play a role in deviant attractions. Diagnosis=DSM and ICD-11 The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition (DSM-5) has a significantly larger diagnostic features section for pedophilia than the previous DSM version, the DSM-IV-TR, and states, \\"The diagnostic criteria for pedophilic disorder are intended to apply both to individuals who freely disclose this paraphilia and to individuals who deny any sexual attraction to prepubertal children (generally age 13 years or younger), despite substantial objective evidence to the contrary.\\" Like the DSM-IV-TR, the manual outlines specific criteria for use in the diagnosis of this disorder. These include the presence of sexually arousing fantasies, behaviors or urges that involve some kind of sexual activity with a prepubescent child (with the diagnostic criteria for the disorder extending the cut-off point for prepubescence to age 13) for six months or more, or that the subject has acted on these urges or suffers from distress as a result of having these feelings. The criteria also indicate that the subject should be 16 or older and that the child or children they fantasize about are at least five years younger than them, though ongoing sexual relationships between a 12- to 13-year-old and a late adolescent are advised to be excluded. A diagnosis is further specified by the sex of the children the person is attracted to, if the impulses or acts are limited to incest, and if the attraction is \\"exclusive\\" or \\"nonexclusive\\". The ICD-10 defines pedophilia as \\"a sexual preference for children, boys or girls or both, usually of prepubertal or early pubertal age\\".See section F65.4 Paedophilia. Like the DSM, this system's criteria require that the person be at least 16 years of age or older before being diagnosed as a pedophile. The person must also have a persistent or predominant sexual preference for prepubescent children at least five years younger than them. The ICD-11 defines pedophilic disorder as a \\"sustained, focused, and intense pattern of sexual arousal‚Äîas manifested by persistent sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges, or behaviours‚Äîinvolving pre-pubertal children.\\" It also states that for a diagnosis of pedophilic disorder, \\"the individual must have acted on these thoughts, fantasies or urges or be markedly distressed by them. This diagnosis does not apply to sexual behaviours among pre- or post-pubertal children with peers who are close in age.\\" Several terms have been used to distinguish \\"true pedophiles\\" from non-pedophilic and non-exclusive offenders, or to distinguish among types of offenders on a continuum according to strength and exclusivity of pedophilic interest, and motivation for the offense (see child sexual offender types). Exclusive pedophiles are sometimes referred to as true pedophiles. They are sexually attracted to prepubescent children, and only prepubescent children. Showing no erotic interest in adults, they can only become sexually aroused while fantasizing about or being in the presence of prepubescent children, or both. Non-exclusive offenders‚Äîor \\"non-exclusive pedophiles\\"‚Äîmay at times be referred to as non-pedophilic offenders, but the two terms are not always synonymous. Non-exclusive offenders are sexually attracted to both children and adults, and can be sexually aroused by both, though a sexual preference for one over the other in this case may also exist. If the attraction is a sexual preference for prepubescent children, such offenders are considered pedophiles in the same vein as exclusive offenders. Neither the DSM nor the ICD-11 diagnostic criteria require actual sexual activity with a prepubescent youth. The diagnosis can therefore be made based on the presence of fantasies or sexual urges even if they have never been acted upon. On the other hand, a person who acts upon these urges yet experiences no distress about their fantasies or urges can also qualify for the diagnosis. Acting on sexual urges is not limited to overt sex acts for purposes of this diagnosis, and can sometimes include indecent exposure, voyeuristic or frotteuristic behaviors, or masturbating to child pornography. Often, these behaviors need to be considered in-context with an element of clinical judgment before a diagnosis is made. Likewise, when the patient is in late adolescence, the age difference is not specified in hard numbers and instead requires careful consideration of the situation.Pedophilia DSM at the Medem Online Medical Library Ego-dystonic sexual orientation () includes people who acknowledge that they have a sexual preference for prepubertal children, but wish to change it due to the associated psychological or behavioral problems (or both). Debate regarding criteria There was discussion on the DSM-IV-TR being overinclusive and underinclusive. Its criterion A concerns sexual fantasies or sexual urges regarding prepubescent children, and its criterion B concerns acting on those urges or the urges causing marked distress or interpersonal difficulty. Several researchers discussed whether or not a \\"contented pedophile\\"‚Äîan individual who fantasizes about having sex with a child and masturbates to these fantasies, but does not commit child sexual abuse, and who does not feel subjectively distressed afterward‚Äîmet the DSM-IV-TR criteria for pedophilia since this person did not meet criterion B. Criticism also concerned someone who met criterion B, but did not meet criterion A. A large-scale survey about usage of different classification systems showed that the DSM classification is only rarely used. As an explanation, it was suggested that the underinclusiveness, as well as a lack of validity, reliability and clarity might have led to the rejection of the DSM classification. Ray Blanchard, an American-Canadian sexologist known for his research studies on pedophilia, addressed (in his literature review for the DSM-5) the objections to the overinclusiveness and under underinclusiveness of the DSM-IV-TR, and proposed a general solution applicable to all paraphilias. This meant namely a distinction between paraphilia and paraphilic disorder. The latter term is proposed to identify the diagnosable mental disorder which meets Criterion A and B, whereas an individual who does not meet Criterion B can be ascertained but not diagnosed as having a paraphilia. Blanchard and a number of his colleagues also proposed that hebephilia become a diagnosable mental disorder under the DSM-5 to resolve the physical development overlap between pedophilia and hebephilia by combining the categories under pedophilic disorder, but with specifiers on which age range (or both) is the primary interest. The proposal for hebephilia was rejected by the American Psychiatric Association, but the distinction between paraphilia and paraphilic disorder was implemented. The American Psychiatric Association stated that \\"[i]n the case of pedophilic disorder, the notable detail is what wasn't revised in the new manual. Although proposals were discussed throughout the DSM-5 development process, diagnostic criteria ultimately remained the same as in DSM-IV TR\\" and that \\"[o]nly the disorder name will be changed from pedophilia to pedophilic disorder to maintain consistency with the chapter‚Äôs other listings.\\" If hebephilia had been accepted as a DSM-5 diagnosable disorder, it would have been similar to the ICD-10 definition of pedophilia that already includes early pubescents, and would have raised the minimum age required for a person to be able to be diagnosed with pedophilia from 16 years to 18 years (with the individual needing to be at least 5 years older than the minor). O'Donohue, however, suggests that the diagnostic criteria for pedophilia be simplified to the attraction to children alone if ascertained by self-report, laboratory findings, or past behavior. He states that any sexual attraction to children is pathological and that distress is irrelevant, noting \\"this sexual attraction has the potential to cause significant harm to others and is also not in the best interests of the individual.\\" Also arguing for behavioral criteria in defining pedophilia, Howard E. Barbaree and Michael C. Seto disagreed with the American Psychiatric Association's approach in 1997 and instead recommended the use of actions as the sole criterion for the diagnosis of pedophilia, as a means of taxonomic simplification.Barbaree, H. E., and Seto, M. C. (1997). Pedophilia: Assessment and Treatment. Sexual Deviance: Theory, Assessment, and Treatment. 175‚Äì193. Treatment=General There is no evidence that pedophilia can be cured. Instead, most therapies focus on helping the pedophile refrain from acting on their desires. Some therapies do attempt to cure pedophilia, but there are no studies showing that they result in a long-term change in sexual preference. Michael Seto suggests that attempts to cure pedophilia in adulthood are unlikely to succeed because its development is influenced by prenatal factors. Pedophilia appears to be difficult to alter but pedophiles can be helped to control their behavior, and future research could develop a method of prevention. There are several common limitations to studies of treatment effectiveness. Most categorize their participants by behavior rather than erotic age preference, which makes it difficult to know the specific treatment outcome for pedophiles. Many do not select their treatment and control groups randomly. Offenders who refuse or quit treatment are at higher risk of offending, so excluding them from the treated group, while not excluding those who would have refused or quit from the control group, can bias the treated group in favor of those with lower recidivism. The effectiveness of treatment for non-offending pedophiles has not been studied. Cognitive behavioral therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) aims to reduce attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that may increase the likelihood of sexual offenses against children. Its content varies widely between therapists, but a typical program might involve training in self-control, social competence and empathy, and use cognitive restructuring to change views on sex with children. The most common form of this therapy is relapse prevention, where the patient is taught to identify and respond to potentially risky situations based on principles used for treating addictions. The evidence for cognitive behavioral therapy is mixed. A 2012 Cochrane Review of randomized trials found that CBT had no effect on risk of reoffending for contact sex offenders. Meta-analyses in 2002 and 2005, which included both randomized and non-randomized studies, concluded that CBT reduced recidivism. There is debate over whether non-randomized studies should be considered informative. More research is needed. Behavioral interventions Behavioral treatments target sexual arousal to children, using satiation and aversion techniques to suppress sexual arousal to children and covert sensitization (or masturbatory reconditioning) to increase sexual arousal to adults. Behavioral treatments appear to have an effect on sexual arousal patterns during phallometric testing, but it is not known whether the effect represents changes in sexual interests or changes in the ability to control genital arousal during testing, nor whether the effect persists in the long term.Barbaree, H. E., Bogaert, A. F., & Seto, M. C. (1995). Sexual reorientation therapy for pedophiles: Practices and controversies. In L. Diamant & R. D. McAnulty (Eds.), The psychology of sexual orientation, behavior, and identity: A handbook (pp. 357‚Äì383). Westport, CT: Greenwood Press.Barbaree, H. C., & Seto, M. C. (1997). Pedophilia: Assessment and treatment. In D. R. Laws & W. T. O'Donohue (eds.), Sexual deviance: Theory, assessment and treatment (pp. 175‚Äì193). New York: Guildford Press. For sex offenders with mental disabilities, applied behavior analysis has been used. Sex drive reduction Pharmacological interventions are used to lower the sex drive in general, which can ease the management of pedophilic feelings, but does not change sexual preference. Antiandrogens work by interfering with the activity of testosterone. Cyproterone acetate (Androcur) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera) are the most commonly used. The efficacy of antiantrogens has some support, but few high-quality studies exist. Cyproterone acetate has the strongest evidence for reducing sexual arousal, while findings on medroxyprogesterone acetate have been mixed. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues such as leuprorelin (Lupron), which last longer and have fewer side-effects, are also used to reduce libido, as are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The evidence for these alternatives is more limited and mostly based on open trials and case studies. All of these treatments, commonly referred to as \\"chemical castration\\", are often used in conjunction with cognitive behavioral therapy. According to the Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers, when treating child molesters, \\"anti-androgen treatment should be coupled with appropriate monitoring and counseling within a comprehensive treatment plan.\\" These drugs may have side-effects, such as weight gain, breast development, liver damage and osteoporosis. Historically, surgical castration was used to lower sex drive by reducing testosterone. The emergence of pharmacological methods of adjusting testosterone has made it largely obsolete, because they are similarly effective and less invasive. It is still occasionally performed in Germany, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, and a few U.S. states. Non- randomized studies have reported that surgical castration reduces recidivism in contact sex offenders. The Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers opposes surgical castration and the Council of Europe works to bring the practice to an end in Eastern European countries where it is still applied through the courts. Epidemiology=Pedophilia and child molestation The prevalence of pedophilia in the general population is not known, but is estimated to be lower than 5% among adult men. Less is known about the prevalence of pedophilia in women, but there are case reports of women with strong sexual fantasies and urges towards children. Most sexual offenders against children are male. Females may account for 0.4% to 4% of convicted sexual offenders, and one study estimates a 10 to 1 ratio of male-to-female child molesters. The true number of female child molesters may be underrepresented by available estimates, for reasons including a \\"societal tendency to dismiss the negative impact of sexual relationships between young boys and adult women, as well as women's greater access to very young children who cannot report their abuse\\", among other explanations. The term pedophile is commonly used by the public to describe all child sexual abuse offenders. This usage is considered problematic by researchers, because many child molesters do not have a strong sexual interest in prepubescent children, and are consequently not pedophiles. There are motives for child sexual abuse that are unrelated to pedophilia, such as stress, marital problems, the unavailability of an adult partner,Howells, K. (1981). \\"Adult sexual interest in children: Considerations relevant to theories of aetiology\\", Adult sexual interest in children. 55‚Äì94. general anti-social tendencies, high sex drive or alcohol use. As child sexual abuse is not automatically an indicator that its perpetrator is a pedophile, offenders can be separated into two types: pedophilic and non-pedophilic (or preferential and situational). Estimates for the rate of pedophilia in detected child molesters generally range between 25% and 50%. A 2006 study found that 35% of its sample of child molesters were pedophilic. Pedophilia appears to be less common in incest offenders, especially fathers and step-fathers. According to a U.S. study on 2429 adult male sex offenders who were categorized as \\"pedophiles\\", only 7% identified themselves as exclusive; indicating that many or most child sexual abusers may fall into the non-exclusive category. Some pedophiles do not molest children. Little is known about this population because most studies of pedophilia use criminal or clinical samples, which may not be representative of pedophiles in general. Researcher Michael Seto suggests that pedophiles who commit child sexual abuse do so because of other anti-social traits in addition to their sexual attraction. He states that pedophiles who are \\"reflective, sensitive to the feelings of others, averse to risk, abstain from alcohol or drug use, and endorse attitudes and beliefs supportive of norms and the laws\\" may be unlikely to abuse children. A 2015 study indicates that pedophiles who molested children are neurologically distinct from non-offending pedophiles. The pedophilic molesters had neurological deficits suggestive of disruptions in inhibitory regions of the brain, while non-offending pedophiles had no such deficits. According to Abel, Mittleman, and BeckerAbel, G. G., Mittleman, M. S., & Becker, J. V. (1985). \\"Sex offenders: Results of assessment and recommendations for treatment\\". In M. H. Ben-Aron, S. J. Hucker, & C. D. Webster (Eds.), Clinical criminology: The assessment and treatment of criminal behavior (pp. 207‚Äì220). Toronto, Canada: M & M Graphics. (1985) and Ward et al. (1995), there are generally large distinctions between the characteristics of pedophilic and non-pedophilic molesters. They state that non-pedophilic offenders tend to offend at times of stress; have a later onset of offending; and have fewer, often familial, victims, while pedophilic offenders often start offending at an early age; often have a larger number of victims who are frequently extrafamilial; are more inwardly driven to offend; and have values or beliefs that strongly support an offense lifestyle. One study found that pedophilic molesters had a median of 1.3 victims for those with girl victims and 4.4 for those with boy victims. Child molesters, pedophilic or not, employ a variety of methods to gain sexual access to children. Some groom their victims into compliance with attention and gifts, while others use threats, alcohol or drugs, or physical force. History Pedophilia is believed to have occurred in humans throughout history, but was not formally named, defined or studied until the late 19th century. The term paedophilia erotica was coined in an 1886 article by the Viennese psychiatrist Richard von Krafft- Ebing but does not enter the author's Psychopathia Sexualis until the 10th German edition. A number of authors anticipated Krafft-Ebing's diagnostic gesture. In Psychopathia Sexualis, the term appears in a section titled \\"Violation of Individuals Under the Age of Fourteen\\", which focuses on the forensic psychiatry aspect of child sexual offenders in general. Krafft-Ebing describes several typologies of offender, dividing them into psychopathological and non-psychopathological origins, and hypothesizes several apparent causal factors that may lead to the sexual abuse of children. Krafft-Ebing mentioned paedophilia erotica in a typology of \\"psycho-sexual perversion\\". He wrote that he had only encountered it four times in his career and gave brief descriptions of each case, listing three common traits: # The individual is tainted [by heredity] (heredit√§r belastete)Roudinesco, √âlisabeth (2009). Our dark side: a history of perversion, p. 144. Polity, # The subject's primary attraction is to children, rather than adults. # The acts committed by the subject are typically not intercourse, but rather involve inappropriate touching or manipulating the child into performing an act on the subject. He mentions several cases of pedophilia among adult women (provided by another physician), and also considered the abuse of boys by homosexual men to be extremely rare. Further clarifying this point, he indicated that cases of adult men who have some medical or neurological disorder and abuse a male child are not true pedophilia and that, in his observation, victims of such men tended to be older and pubescent. He also lists pseudopaedophilia as a related condition wherein \\"individuals who have lost libido for the adult through masturbation and subsequently turn to children for the gratification of their sexual appetite\\" and claimed this is much more common. Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud briefly wrote about the topic in his 1905 book Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality in a section titled The Sexually immature and Animals as Sexual objects. He wrote that exclusive pedophilia was rare and only occasionally were prepubescent children exclusive objects. He wrote that they usually were the subject of desire when a weak person \\"makes use of such substitutes\\" or when an uncontrollable instinct which will not allow delay seeks immediate gratification and cannot find a more appropriate object.Freud, Sigmund Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex Mobi Classics pages 18‚Äì20 In 1908, Swiss neuroanatomist and psychiatrist Auguste Forel wrote of the phenomenon, proposing that it be referred to it as \\"Pederosis\\", the \\"Sexual Appetite for Children\\". Similar to Krafft-Ebing's work, Forel made the distinction between incidental sexual abuse by persons with dementia and other organic brain conditions, and the truly preferential and sometimes exclusive sexual desire for children. However, he disagreed with Krafft-Ebing in that he felt the condition of the latter was largely ingrained and unchangeable. The term pedophilia became the generally accepted term for the condition and saw widespread adoption in the early 20th century, appearing in many popular medical dictionaries such as the 5th Edition of Stedman's in 1918. In 1952, it was included in the first edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. This edition and the subsequent DSM-II listed the disorder as one subtype of the classification \\"Sexual Deviation\\", but no diagnostic criteria were provided. The DSM-III, published in 1980, contained a full description of the disorder and provided a set of guidelines for diagnosis. The revision in 1987, the DSM-III-R, kept the description largely the same, but updated and expanded the diagnostic criteria. Law and forensic psychology=Definitions Pedophilia is not a legal term, and having a sexual attraction to children is not illegal. In law enforcement circles, the term pedophile is sometimes used informally to refer to any person who commits one or more sexually-based crimes that relate to legally underage victims. These crimes may include child sexual abuse, statutory rape, offenses involving child pornography, child grooming, stalking, and indecent exposure. One unit of the United Kingdom's Child Abuse Investigation Command is known as the \\"Paedophile Unit\\" and specializes in online investigations and enforcement work. Some forensic science texts, such as Holmes (2008), use the term to refer to offenders who target child victims, even when such children are not the primary sexual interest of the offender. FBI agent Kenneth Lanning, however, makes a point of distinguishing between pedophiles and child molesters. Civil and legal commitment In the United States, following Kansas v. Hendricks, sex offenders who have certain mental disorders, including pedophilia, can be subject to indefinite civil commitment under various state laws (generically called SVP laws) and the federal Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006. Similar legislation exists in Canada. In Kansas v. Hendricks, the US Supreme Court upheld as constitutional a Kansas law, the Sexually Violent Predator Act, under which Hendricks, a pedophile, was found to have a \\"mental abnormality\\" defined as a \\"congenital or acquired condition affecting the emotional or volitional capacity which predisposes the person to commit sexually violent offenses to the degree that such person is a menace to the health and safety of others\\", which allowed the State to confine Hendricks indefinitely irrespective of whether the State provided any treatment to him. In United States v. Comstock, this type of indefinite confinement was upheld for someone previously convicted on child pornography charges; this time a federal law was involved‚Äîthe Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act. The Walsh Act does not require a conviction on a sex offense charge, but only that the person be a federal prisoner, and one who \\"has engaged or attempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child molestation and who is sexually dangerous to others\\", and who \\"would have serious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or child molestation if released\\". In the US, offenders with pedophilia are more likely to be recommended for civil commitment than non-pedophilic offenders. About half of committed offenders have a diagnosis of pedophilia. Psychiatrist Michael First writes that, since not all people with a paraphilia have difficulty controlling their behavior, the evaluating clinician must present additional evidence of volitional impairment instead of recommending commitment based on pedophilia alone. Society and culture=General Pedophilia is one of the most stigmatized mental disorders. One study reported high levels of anger, fear and social rejection towards pedophiles who have not committed a crime. The authors suggested such attitudes could negatively impact child sexual abuse prevention by reducing pedophiles' mental stability and discouraging them from seeking help. According to sociologists Melanie- Angela Neuilly and Kristen Zgoba, social concern over pedophilia intensified greatly in the 1990s, coinciding with several sensational sex crimes (but a general decline in child sexual abuse rates). They found that the word pedophile appeared only rarely in The New York Times and Le Monde before 1996, with zero mentions in 1991. Social attitudes towards child sexual abuse are extremely negative, with some surveys ranking it as morally worse than murder. Early research showed that there was a great deal of misunderstanding and unrealistic perceptions in the general public about child sexual abuse and pedophiles. However, a 2004 study concluded that the public was well-informed on some aspects of these subjects. Misuse of medical terminology The words pedophile and pedophilia are commonly used informally to describe an adult's sexual interest in pubescent or post-pubescent teenagers. The terms hebephilia or ephebophilia may be more accurate in these cases. Another common usage of pedophilia is to refer to the act of sexual abuse itself, rather than the medical meaning, which is a preference for prepubescents on the part of the older individual (see above for an explanation of the distinction). There are also situations where the terms are misused to refer to relationships where the younger person is an adult of legal age, but is either considered too young in comparison to their older partner, or the older partner occupies a position of authority over them. Researchers state that the above uses of the term pedophilia are imprecise or suggest that they are best avoided. The Mayo Clinic states that pedophilia \\"is not a criminal or legal term\\". Pedophile advocacy groups From the late 1950s to early 1990s, several pedophile membership organizations advocated age of consent reform to lower or abolish age of consent laws, as well as for the acceptance of pedophilia as a sexual orientation rather than a psychological disorder, and for the legalization of child pornography. The efforts of pedophile advocacy groups did not gain mainstream acceptance, and today those few groups that have not dissolved have only minimal membership and have ceased their activities other than through a few websites.Benoit Denizet-Lewis (2001). \\"Boy Crazy\\", Boston Magazine.Trembaly, Pierre (2002). \\"Social interactions among paedophiles\\" In contrast to these organizations, members of the support group Virtuous Pedophiles believe that child sexual abuse is wrong and seek to raise awareness that some pedophiles do not offend; this is generally not considered pedophile advocacy, as the Virtuous Pedophiles organization does not approve of the legalization of child pornography and does not support age of consent reform. Anti-pedophile activism Anti-pedophile activism encompasses opposition against pedophiles, against pedophile advocacy groups, and against other phenomena that are seen as related to pedophilia, such as child pornography and child sexual abuse. Much of the direct action classified as anti-pedophile involves demonstrations against sex offenders, against pedophiles advocating for the legalization of sexual activity between adults and children, and against Internet users who solicit sex from minors.Families flee paedophile protests August 9, 2000. Retrieved January 24, 2008.Dutch paedophiles set up political party, May 30, 2006. Retrieved January 2008. High-profile media attention to pedophilia has led to incidents of moral panic, particularly following reports of pedophilia associated with Satanic ritual abuse and day care sex abuse. Instances of vigilantism have also been reported in response to public attention on convicted or suspected child sex offenders. In 2000, following a media campaign of \\"naming and shaming\\" suspected pedophiles in the UK, hundreds of residents took to the streets in protest against suspected pedophiles, eventually escalating to violent conduct requiring police intervention.

Biography P√©rez signed with the Montreal Expos as an amateur free agent in . After being an All-Star pitcher in his debut season in , P√©rez's career looked extremely promising. However, he soon suffered an untimely and devastating injury which forced him to miss the entire 1996 season. After rehabilitation, he re-joined the Expos in but still displayed steady showings of his All-Star form. After several productive months into the 1998 season, P√©rez was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 31 along with Hiram Bocachica and Mark Grudzielanek for Peter Bergeron, Wilton Guerrero, Ted Lilly, and Jonathan Tucker. By the time he became a Dodger, his potential for being a dominant left-handed major league pitcher was quickly slipping away. Frustration grew and P√©rez had his two worst seasons in (2-10 in only 16 starts) and , and he was relegated to the bullpen (after an entire career as a starter). On June 16, 1999, P√©rez had an outburst during a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates at Dodger Stadium. After consecutively walking Abraham Nunez, Francisco C√≥rdova and Mike Benjamin to load the bases in the fourth inning, he was removed from the game by Dodger Manager Davey Johnson in favor of Jamie Arnold. Upon returning to the dugout, P√©rez proceeded to destroy a water cooler with a baseball bat. (The Dodgers won the game, 6-5.) His performance soon thereafter, coupled with a legal issue stemming from an airplane flight in which a flight attendant accused P√©rez of choking, threatening, and causing injury to her, forced him to an early exit from baseball. P√©rez was a highly animated player, especially when he was on the mound. Beginning in his rookie year, after every strikeout (and sometimes even after individual strikes), he made spastic movements, usually flailing an arm into the air while crouching very low to the ground and hopping in a semicircle (in the case of a strikeout, P√©rez would react in unity with the umpire who was signaling the strikeout motion). Sometimes batters took offense to it while others realized or knew that it was just part of his routine. Perez has gone on to play in his native Dominican Republic, to play winter ball, including the Caribbean World Series (2009) as well as the 2009 World Baseball Classic.

The Iya Valley (Á•ñË∞∑ Iya) region in Tokushima Prefecture, Japan is a scenic area known for its dramatic mountain valleys, thatched roof farmhouses and historic vine bridges. Although access has improved in recent years, the Iya Valley and the inner parts of Shikoku have historically been remote and difficult to enter, making them a favorite retreat for refugees and defeated warriors. Most notably, members of the Taira clan (aka Heike clan) were rumored to have entered the area after losing the Genpei War to the Minamoto clan in the late 12th century. In modern times, the Iya Valley has become an increasingly popular tourist destination due to its natural environment and to being one of the last few vestiges of old world Japan. Although the west part of the valley (known as Nishi-Iya) has good road access and other tourist facilities, the eastern area known as Higashi-Iya (Êù±Á•ñË∞∑) or Oku-Iya (Â••Á•ñË∞∑) is still relatively difficult to access. Several vine bridges, once the only method for crossing the rivers, continue to span the valleys and have become a tourist attraction.  Etymology  The name of Iya has somewhat cloudy origins. According to noted Japanese historical researcher Kunio Yanagita, the term \\"Iya\\" („Ç§„É§) or \\"Oya\\" („Ç™„É§) has been used since times immemorial to denote this mountainous valley region. This term is believed to translate as \\"ancestor\\" or \\"mountain/land spirit\\" (in the sense that according to Japanese tradition, one's ancestral spirits dwell in mountains), but since it is a phonetic term and predates the introduction of Chinese characters, it is difficult to say for certain. Yanagita further believes that with the introduction of Chinese characters, the kanji characters Á•ñË∞∑ (\\"Iya\\"), which translates as \\"ancestor valley\\", were chosen due to matching in both meaning and in phonetics.  Geography  Although there are several rivers that flow through the Iya Valley region, the Iya River (Á•ñË∞∑Â∑ù Iya-gawa) is the principal one, flowing from east to west and forming the entirety of the Iya Valley. Mount Tsurugi (Ââ£Â±± Tsurugi-san), the second-highest peak on Shikoku island, is at the east end of the Iya Valley along the border with Tsurugi town, and from here the headwaters of the Iya River begin their flow from springs that come off the mountain, some of which are as high as 1800m. The Iya Valley follows this river for about 50 km, to the village of Iyaguchi (Á•ñË∞∑Âè£) in Yamashiro District of Miyoshi City, where the Iya River joins the Yoshino River at an elevation of about 90m. The Iya Valley was formerly divided into two villages East Iya (Êù±Á•ñË∞∑Â±±Êùë) and West Iya (Ë•øÁ•ñË∞∑Â±±Êùë), however, on March 1, 2006, both villages merged with other local towns to form Miyoshi City. However the two former villages are still referred to by their old names locally, \\"Nishi-Iya\\" (West Iya) and \\"Higashi-Iya\\" (East Iya). The lower reaches of the Iya Valley are referred to as the Iya Gorge (Á•ñË∞∑Ê∏ì Iya-kei). This area is mostly undeveloped and unpopulated, but the original road that accesses the Iya Valley goes through here (Rt 32), which was built between 1902 and 1920. Though a more modern tunnel connecting the central valley to Oboke has been built (allowing faster and easier access to the main areas of the Iya Valley), it is still possible to enter by way of the old, mostly one-laned road through the gorge (called the \\"Iya Highway\\"). About halfway along this 20 km long cliffside, gorge road is the Peeing Boy Statue, which was installed in 1968 in honor of young boys who would traditionally relieve themselves from this high precipice.  Culture  As the valley has been historically isolated from the surrounding areas, it has developed its own unique heritage. Many of the traditions are still (just barely) alive, harking back to a time and style now largely lost elsewhere in Japan.  Food  Agriculture The traditional culinary offerings in the valley are based on what can be grown in the small terraced farm plots that climb up the hillsides through the valley's hamlets. Very few mechanized tools are used, though some people have small hand-pushed tilling machines. Nearly all crops are organically grown, with the main fertilizer being the susuki grass (also called kaya) that is also used for roof thatch. This grass is harvested in the mid-autumn and bundled into small pyramids around the fields so that it can be used in the spring. Grains and Vegetables Various vegetables are still produced for local consumption or for use in the valley's inns. In the past rice was grown but was difficult to cultivate in abundance, so the main staples are soba (buckwheat) and potatoes. The soba is either prepared as a whole-grain porridge (soba-gome) or as noodles. To this day noodles are still grounded by hand in traditional stone mortars in some households, and several people in the valley offer classes. The famed Iya potatoes are small and dense due to the rough and rocky soil conditions. Usually served roasted or in soups, a local dish consists of whole boiled potatoes mixed with miso paste and garlic. Other foods include the locally produced tofu, which is rather unusual for Japan, and called ishi-dofu or iwa-dofu by the locals, which literally means \\"stone tofu\\". It gets its name from its thick density, so stiff that a brick sized piece would be traditionally carried by a single rope wrapped around it. This is prepared in soups, roasted over charcoal with miso paste, or served uncooked with ground ginger, green onions, and soy sauce. Konnyaku is another locally produced delicacy, which is a rubbery gelatin produced from a Japanese yam. Renowned for its medicinal and health qualities, it is served in soups, roasted, or uncooked with miso paste. A common treat is called dekomawashi which consists of a whole Iya potato, a square of iwadofu, and a wedge of konnyaku all skewered together on a bamboo stick, then slathered with miso and slowly roasted over coals. This can be found at roadside shops and most hotels and restaurants. Various types of wild mountain sprouts collectively known throughout Japan as san-sai (mountain vegetables) are a garnish for soups and noodle dishes and are a rather sought after delicacy in the Iya Valley as such mountainous terrain is where they tend to randomly grow. However, like elsewhere in the country, due to the expense and difficulty in producing, it is probably more common at most local restaurants and hotels to be (unknowingly) served cheaper imported san-sai, usually from China. However, local people do produce san-sai for their own use, and if staying at a small inn or homestay you would probably have an opportunity to sample the real thing. Meat In the past farm animals were standard but nowadays (at best) one may find the occasional chicken or two. Hunting and fishing were once common, but are now less so. Wild boar and deer are still prized and the few hunters/trappers around can now sell their finds through the new (opened in 2014) hunters' butchery located in Higashi Iya. As a result, such wild game is becoming available in some local restaurants and hotels. Traditionally however, the local hunters would have huts deep in the mountains (only a dozen or so remain active) where their kills would be brought and butchered, the hunting dogs would be fed, and a feast of meat would be grilled up and shared. As the meat was so fresh, it was common for the prime cuts to be eaten raw. River trout (amego) is a popular delicacy and though still fished by some, it is more commonly gotten by the few local hatcheries. To prepare, usually the whole fish is encrusted in salt, skewered with a bamboo stick, and then roasted slowly over charcoal. The amego fish is also a main ingredient in hirara-yaki, which is an offering unique to the Iya Valley. This meal is traditionally slow-cooked on a large stone with a fire beneath, but nowadays it is more common to have it prepared on a large iron griddle. To prepare, thick walls of miso paste (both red and white miso) are formed in a circle around the edges, and inside a collection of fish, potatoes, tofu, onions, and konnyaku are cooked in a sake based broth which steeps in the surrounding miso. While usually only (and rarely) prepared at festivals or special occasions, it is possible to find it on the menu in individual portions at some inns and hotels.  Drink  Iya people love to drink; however, there is no local alcohol (legally) produced. While beer is common, the oldest generation still prefers sake, while the middle-aged men are more partial to shochu. The Iya drinking etiquette is usually practiced at shrine festivals, home parties, and banquets. In this drinking style, a person has his own small cup from which he must first consume a cupful in order to 'break it in'. Then he passes his cup to his neighbor and pours him a cupful (usually sake, but any alcohol or even non-alcohol is allowable). The receiving person must immediately drink this, so that he can return the cup. The cup is then filled for the original owner, and he must drink this cup quickly because he will then be given the cup owned by the person he just gave his to. This sharing and serving of cups will go on back and forth between two people for as long as their conversation continues, and then they both move on to other people in the room. It is proper to share at least one cupful with every person present at the occasion, which could take a rather long time and result in heavy intoxication at large gatherings. It is still common for local people to grow and roast their own tea, called bancha (Áï™Ëå∂), and is primarily used for household consumption. Each spring the youngest leaves are picked, roasted, pressed by hand, and dried in the sun on straw mats laid out in front of homes. When visiting a home, it is common to be served this either hot or lukewarm.  Festivals  Several festivals of various size are held throughout the year. Most local Shinto shrines host their own festivals for the surrounding neighborhood, usually once or twice a year according to their own traditions. In these events, local customs often call for a group of men to carry a small (70‚Äì150 kg) portable shrine around the shrine grounds while accompanied with drummers, people in costume, and sometimes pairs of people throwing long bamboo staffs. Each shrine and neighborhood has its own customs (one or two even have the attendees engage in sumo), but due to an ever- dwindling population, many of these traditions are being lost. The largest festivals in the valley are the summer festivals, one each in Nishi-Iya and Higashi-Iya. They are held at the middle-school grounds on the weekends before and after the national Obon Holiday (August 15) as this is a common time for family members who have moved away to return home for a visit. These events are open to anyone and include food tents, games, performances, and fireworks, so if visiting the area at this time, ask around or look for promotional posters. The Yukigassen (Snowball Fight Competition) is held each January in Higashi Iya, and has become a major event at a time when few visit the valley. Not simply a free-for-all, this event is team-based and participants often practice for months to coordinate their skills in the tightly ruled sport. There are several classes of participation including children, women's, men's, and 'just for fun' leagues, and the winners of the main event get to advance to the national competition annually held in Nagano Prefecture.  Architecture  Ochiai hamlet, Higashi-Iya The original Iya hamlets extend up the valley walls in clusters and only in the past forty years or so have roads been built connecting them to the main roadway at the base of the valley, with many hamlets only getting roads as recently as the 1990s. Many homes sit abandoned. The traditional home building style in the Iya valley is called kayabuki ( ËåÖËë∫ thatched roof house, also called minka Ê∞ëÂÆ∂) and many examples of these buildings still exist, though those with exposed thatch are now usually used as inns, restaurants, or historic sites and not for personal use. Since cutting, bundling and replacing the thatch is a time consuming and costly endeavor, most personal homes which still have thatch now have it covered over with corrugated tin panels to prevent it from rotting. Though the thatch isn't visible, it is easy to spot these homes on the hillsides as they have thick, high-pitched roofs. Since the 1950s or so many of the thatched homes have had their roof pitch lowered and the roof completely replaced with either tiles or corrugated tin. Historically, it was common for a home site to consist of three buildings: the main home, a barn, and what is locally called an inkyo (Èö†Â±Ö) \\"retirement home\\" which would be a smaller but independently functioning house for the family's oldest generation. As one set of grandparents died, the next would move into this separate house for some most likely much sought after peace and quiet. The most modern homes from the 1960s onwards lie along the main valley roadside and are often built on heavy steel scaffolds due to the lack of flat space. The frames of the traditional homes are made with massive, interwoven red pine (akamatsu Ëµ§Êùæ) or southern Japanese hemlock (tsuga Ê†Ç) logs for horizontal beams and squared-off chestnut (kuri Ê†ó) for vertical beams. All are connected through traditional craftsmanship without nails, allowing the wood to expand and contract with the seasons. Some of the oldest building examples still standing date back to the seventeenth century. The foundations are usually made entirely of chestnut beams due to its high strength and anti-rotting properties, and the base beams simply sit upon stone piles such that nothing is actually secured to the ground (that is, no concrete or planting of beams). Irori Inside, the center point of the home is the approximately one meter square irori (Âõ≤ÁÇâË£è sunken floor hearth) which would usually stay alight with low embers at all times. To maintain the burn, four chestnut logs would be placed inward at each corner and a small, flameless charcoal fire within the joining point at the center would slowly burn on the tips of the logs, and as the logs burned out they would be pushed slightly more into the center. The irori would be used for cooking, either with an iron pot stand or with the suspended jizai-kagi (Ëá™Âú®Èàé) which consists of an adjustable hook connected to a ceiling beam above and from which a pot could be hung, with the height adjusted according to the temperature sought. Often the jizai-kagi would be made of a bamboo pole with a carved wooden fish used for the hook adjusting mechanism (with the fish serving as a water talisman to ward off the danger of fire). As the fire would constantly burn, and since there are no chimneys, the ceilings and beams in these homes have now become blackened with soot, particularly the higher in the house they are. The internal bamboo lattice to which the roof thatch would be lashed to would accordingly turn a deep red-brown when polished (called susutake ÁÖ§Á´π), and it was sought after by handicraft workers whenever a roof was replaced. One of the main reasons to have such a smokey atmosphere was to help dry out the roof thatch from the inside and extend its lifespan (usually about 25 or 30 years). However the smoke-filled homes did serve an additional purpose, which was to help cure the tobacco leaves that would be hung from the rafters during the winter (until the 1970s, tobacco was the primary cash-crop in the valley. Currently it is no longer grown anywhere in Iya). Also standard in the homes is the storage cellar, located under a removable pair of floor boards. This cellar would be dug about one meter deep into the ground and would be used to store potatoes, pickles and other foods as the temperature would be cooler and more consistent down there in the summer. The best known historical houses of East Iya are: Asa-ke House Èòø‰ΩêÂÆ∂‰ΩèÂÆÖ. Located in the hamlet of Asa Èòø‰Ωê, this is one of the largest houses in Iya, formerly lived in by the leader of the descendants of the Heike warriors who fled into Iya in the late 12th century. The present house dates from 1862, and was fully restored in 1917.http://www.miyoshi.ed.jp/docs/2017040500023/, https://miyoshi- tourism.jp/spot/__trashed/ Kita-ke House ÂñúÂ§öÂÆ∂‰ΩèÂÆÖ.

Yet most people (about 95%) do not get much farther than this site, mainly due to the fact that the primary access road to the rest of the valley is only one lane at times which creates insurance restrictions for most group tour buses. However, the deeper reaches of the valley in Higashi Iya are much more preserved. For those visiting in the summer months, the pleasant temperatures are an escape from the usually oppressive heat found most other places in the country. Aside from the scenic double vine bridge deep in the valley (Oku-Iya Kazurabashi), there are historic hamlets, many thatched-roof homes, extensive mountain hiking, and one of the oddest art installations in the country.http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/village-scarecrows-residents-nagoro- japan-are-being-replaced-by-life-size-straw-dolls-1492079 Scarecrow Village File:Iya Jirogyu View.JPGIya Jirogyu view File:Iya vine bridge-3.jpgIya vine bridge File:lots of koinobori.jpgKoi banners flying over Oboke Koboke File:Yoshino River - Oboke Koboke looking West.JPGYoshino River, in Oboke Koboke (looking west), after typhoon No. 9, 2009 File:Yoshino River - Oboke Koboke looking East.JPGYoshino River, in Oboke Koboke (looking east), after typhoon No.9, 2009  Notes External links * IyaTime: Iya Valley Tourism Website in English * http://atlasobscura.com/places/vine-bridges-japan * The alluring lofty peaks of Iya Valley (The Japan Times) * Vine bridges cross Japan's remote Iya Valley (The Philadelphia Inquirer) * Few Americans know about this mysterious, remote valley in southern Japan (The Washington Post) * Off the Beaten Track on the Island of Shikoku (Channel NewsAsia) * In between days in Okayama, Japan (The Australian Financial Review) * (Chiiori Trust) * (Chiiori Org) * (Inside Kyoto) * (Huffington Post Japan) * (New York Times) * (Travel Age West) Regions of Japan Landforms of Tokushima Prefecture Tourist attractions in Tokushima Prefecture Valleys of Japan Miyoshi, Tokushima ","title":"Iya Valley"},{"id":"6341516","text":"Towson Catholic High School was a private Catholic, co-educational high school in the Baltimore suburb of Towson, Maryland, whose closing was announced in July 2009. At its peak enrollment in the 1960s and 1970s, more than 400 children attended. Founded in 1922 by a Catholic priest, Phillip Sheridan, it was the oldest co-educational Catholic high school in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore when it closed. During its 86 years, the small school was long noted for its successful athletics program as well as personalized secondary-level education. History Towson Catholic High School was founded in 1922 by Phillip Sheridan, priest at Immaculate Conception Church, to provide secondary-level education to Roman Catholics in the growing Baltimore suburb of Towson. The high school's original classroom building was replaced by a modern, masonry structure constructed in 1953 on the same campus as Towson's Immaculate Conception Church and its affiliated Immaculate Conception School for elementary and middle grades. The high school was renowned for its successful basketball program, producing a number of NBA players, including Gene Shue, Carmelo Anthony and Dont√© Greene. The girls' basketball team was ranked #1 nationwide in the U.S. three times during the early 1980s, as it fielded one of the most competitive teams in Maryland basketball history, going undefeated for 70 consecutive games from 1982 to 1985. Towson Catholic's athletic teams participated in the Baltimore Catholic League. Closing The Archdiocese announced on July 7, 2009, that the school would not re-open for the 2009-2010 term due to declining enrollment, which dropped from 244 students in the 2008-2009 school year to only 160 anticipated for 2009-2010.WBAL-TV 11 News, WBAL-TV, July 7, 2009. The resulting budget deficit of $650,000 projected for the following year necessitated the school's closure, an Archdiocesan spokesman told the Baltimore Sun. The parish's adjacent Immaculate Conception elementary-middle school is unaffected by the high school's closing and is said to be \\"thriving\\", according to the Archdiocese. At the announcement of the venerable school's closing, alumni said its students \\"got a solid education and learned to appreciate classical musicals as well as a good game of basketball\\". They praised the small school's personalized instruction and sense of community, \\"where everyone was popular\\". The news sparked a large demonstration by placard-wielding parents, students, and alumni in front of the school the next day protesting its closing, prompting a front page headline story, \\"Anger in Towson\\", in the Baltimore Sun. The protesters said they had no warning of the school's abrupt closing and told a reporter that greater fund-raising efforts should have been made to save the school. Baltimore Archbishop Edwin F. O'Brien said in a news release that the school's administrators had \\"expended great energy and countless hours to save the school from this fate.\\" Amidst continuing demonstrations and meetings with parents and alumni in the aftermath of the closing announcement, a lawsuit was filed by some parents on July 14, 2009, seeking to keep the school open. Alumni also began a fund-raising effort to overcome the school's financial deficit, although a Baltimore County Circuit Court judge declined on July 24 to grant an injunction that would have kept the school open. Following the closing of Towson Catholic High School in 2009, its building was subsequently renovated and is now used for Immaculate Conception School's performing arts program and expanded middle school.

History Yumbel originated from the small fort of San Felipe de Austria, raised in 1585 by Governor Alonso de Sotomayor, on the cerro del Centinela (Hill of the Sentinel). This fort was destroyed by the Mapuche and replaced in 1603, by Governor Alonso de Ribera as fort Santa Lucia de Yumbel. Destroyed in 1621 it was rebuilt the same year. It remained in use until 1648 when it was abandoned and its garrison sent to the fort of Nacimiento, Chile. Governor √Ångel de Peredo again constructed it in 1663 as fort Nuestra Se√±ora de Almudena. When Francisco de Meneses Brito populated it three years later he renamed it San Carlos de Austria de Yumbel. During the term of Diego Gonz√°lez Montero Justiniano a town that had evolved was given the name of Santa Lucia de Yumbel. Governor Antonio de Guill y Gonzaga gave it the recognition as a town in 1766. It grew little until the Chilean War of Independence when it was occupied by both sides at times and then was burned by the Spanish guerrilla Juan Manuel Pic√≥ and the end of 1820. The town was reduced to ruins in the earthquake of February 20, 1835, and was reestablished to the north of the old location on August 29, 1836. It alternated for some time with the town of San Luis Gonzaga as the capital of the Department of Rere, until the decree of June 2, 1853 confirmed Yumbel as the capital. On March 19, 1871 Yumbel was made a city. Geography The city lies a few kilometers northeast of the confluence of the Laja and B√≠o B√≠o rivers. The Biob√≠o River marks boundary between two natural regions of Chile, the Zona Central to the north and the Zona Austral to the south. Demographics According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Yumbel spans an area of and has 20,498 inhabitants (10,442 men and 10,056 women). Of these, 10,935 (53.3%) lived in urban areas and 9,563 (46.7%) in rural areas. The population grew by 0.2% (38 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. Administration As a commune, Yumbel is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years.

And, after proceeding a little further, he adds‚Äî :::::Thus first did some man, as I deem, persuade :::::Men to suppose the race of Gods exists.. Authorship The authorship of the fragment, which survives in the writings of Sextus Empiricus, is vigorously debated. Modern classical scholarship accepted the attribution to Critias on the basis of a hypothesis first advanced by Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff in 1875, and thereafter Hermann Diels, Johann August Nauck, and Bruno Snell, endorsed this ascription for which there is but one source in antiquity. In 1979, Albrecht Dihle in a major paper challenged this ascription and assigned the work to Euripides, arguing that the fragment comes from the latter's satyr play of this name, produced in 415 BCE. Dihle's gained wide acceptance, being endorsed by several modern scholars, among them Charles Kahn, Ruth Scodel, Martin Ostwald, Jan Bremmer and Harvey Yunis. Not all have been persuaded however. and, at that time, Walter Burkert, the doyen of scholars of Greek religion for one, remained skeptical. One source in antiquity ascribed the passage to Critias, one of the thirty oligarchs who ruled Athens in the immediate aftermath of the city-state's defeat in the Peloponesian War: two attribute it, or lines in it, to Euripides. Sextus Empiricus assigned these verses to Critias without however indicating which of his works. Both the Stoic logician Chrysippus and the doxographer A√´tius cited Euripides as the author, specifying that it was taken from that author's lost play Sisyphus. In modern times, Wilamowitz came down strongly for the view that it was written by Critias, a disciple of Socrates, and dated it, as forming the coda of a tetralogy, following three tragedies by Critias -Peirithous, Rhadumunthus and Tennes -, which he argued was written sometime after his return from exile in 411. The view that it was written by Euripides frequently identifies it as belonging to the Sisyphus, the satyr play capping his 415 trilogy: Alexandros, Palamedes and The Trojan Women, though Jan N. Bremmer suggests another lost play by Euripides, his Autolykos would be a more attractive candidate as the original source. A major issue in discussing authorship of the passage hinges on the question whether the speaker's views reflect those of a historic atheist, or whether the lines are simply a dramatic mise en sc√®ne of an atheistic outlook, and therefore not one entertained by its author. Dihle argued that there was no evidence in the surviving fragments of Kritias that he was an atheist, except for the testimony of Sextus Empiricus and Plutarch, a point Burkert challenged in the revised English version of his book on Greek Religion by citing the testimony of a fragment of Epicurus from Bk.11 of his work On Nature. Style The fragment is composed of 42 iambic trimeters. The topic concerns the mythical figure of Sisyphus. Style plays an important function in the authorship question: if we take it as expressing the view of the sophist Critias, the cynical deconstruction of religion would appear to harmonize perfectly with the character of that historical person, ‚Äì 'that brilliant but sinister figure in the politics and letters of the end of the fifth century' ‚Äì who gained a reputation for ruthless unscrupulousness. But were it to pertain to the genre of the satyr play, then we would not expect a straightforward exposition of a theory but rather a parody of it, a tone lacking in the surviving fragment. Interpretations W. K. C. Guthrie stated that the Sisyphus fragment is 'the first occurrence in history of the theory of religion as a political invention to ensure good behaviour,' an approach which was subsequently adopted by the Hellenistic historian Polybius in his 40 volume history of Rome's emergence as an empire. Karl Popper in his The Open Society and its Enemies noted a 'striking' similarity between the passage ascribed to Critias, and the views Plato, Critias's nephew, developed in his two dialogues, the Republic and the Laws regarding the Noble lie.

Jacob Weil. R. Jacob Weil was one of the leading authorities of his age\\" Biography Of his life, few details are known, but, according to Gr√§tz, he died before 1456. He was one of the foremost pupils of Jacob Moelin (Maharil), who ordained him in the rabbinate, and authorized him to officiate in Nuremberg. Weil, however, did not avail himself of this permission lest he should offend an older scholar, Solomon Cohen, who had been appointed rabbi of that city long before. This despite the fact that Weil himself ruled that a rabbi had no lifetime tenure (Responsa, No. 151). Indeed, this example illustrates two facets of Weil's personality - his deep humility and his deep- felt desire to avoid unnecessary confrontation and conflict. He generally signed his responsa \\"the little one, Jacob Weil\\". Weil was later called to the rabbinate of Erfurt; and congregations far and near, recognizing him as an authority, addressed their problems to him. Among the rabbis who addressed questions to him are Rabbi Israel Isserlein (Maharya) and his student Rabbi Israel of Brno. Weil approved of the pilpulistic method only as an aid to study, but rendered legal decisions purely on the basis of logic (Responsa, No. 164). Weil was especially severe on contemporary rabbis who regarded themselves as having peculiar privileges transcending the rights of the laity, declaring in a responsum (No. 163) that no rabbis of his time had any such prerogatives, and that, moreover, no man could be regarded as a scholar (Talmid ·∏§akam) in the Talmudic sense. Despite his humility and his belief in the value of peace, when he felt that the need arose Weill did not spare his pen. After his father in law refused to repay the debt of a man who paid the ransom of his mother in law, Weill ruled that \\"since I am close to the case, it is my responsibility to take action and to nullify his evil decree (not to repay the debt) so that a mishap does not occur in Israel and the door is not closed on those who perform good deeds and the name of heaven is not desecrated ... and if he does not obey this strict ruling he is to be cursed and excommunicated and separated from all that is holy\\" (Resp. No. 148). Of Weil's works only a collection of opinions and decisions, \\"She'elot u-Teshubot\\" (Venice, 1549), has been preserved. To this work was added an appendix entitled \\"She·∏•i·π≠ot u-Bedi·∏≥ot,\\" containing regulations for slaughtering and for the examination of slaughtered cattle.

Basketball career A 6'11\\" center from St. John's University, Ellis set the St. John's records for highest rebounding average in a season (16.5) and most rebounds in one game with 30. In his senior year, he received the 1962 Haggerty Award as the All-Metropolitan New York Division I men's college basketball player of the year. Ellis was selected by the Los Angeles Lakers in the first round (8th pick overall) of the 1962 NBA draft. He played in 1,048 games over 14 seasons (1962-1976) in the NBA with the Lakers, Baltimore Bullets, Portland Trail Blazers, and Philadelphia 76ers, and was a member of the 1971‚Äì72 Los Angeles Lakers championship team, which also won a then-record 69 games in the regular season, and recorded the longest winning streak in NBA history with 33 wins. The following season, Ellis was traded to the 76ers, who had an NBA-worst 73 losses in an 82-game season. At the close of his NBA career 1976, Ellis had amassed career totals of 10,176 points and 8,709 rebounds. Ellis was on the first Portland Trail Blazers team in 1970‚Äì71, selected from Baltimore in the 1970 expansion draft. He was in the starting lineup for the Trail Blazers' inaugural game. He was their third leading scorer (15.9 points per game)1970‚Äì71 Portland Trail Blazers Roster and Stats and the leading rebounder, averaging 12.3 per game, the third-best average in the Blazers‚Äô first three decades. He continued playing basketball long after his professional career ended, including being a part of several Senior Masters Games national championship teams in Portland. Personal life Ellis and his family settled in Portland, Oregon, while he played professional basketball. He later entered the tire industry during his retirement and moved to Southern California to operate a tire store in Orange County. LeRoy Ellis was accompanied by his son, LeRon, and the two moved to the city of Anaheim, California while waiting for the rest of their family to join them at a later time. Ellis and his wife eventually returned to Portland. Three of Ellis' children have gone on to play college basketball: his daughter Lisa played women's basketball for California State University, Long Beach and the University of Kentucky; his eldest son LeRoy Jr. played NCAA Division I men's basketball for the University of the Pacific and was a member of the 1990 NCAA Division II National Champion Kentucky Wesleyan College; and another son, LeRon, played at the University of Kentucky and Syracuse University before playing two and a half seasons in the NBA. LeRoy Ellis' youngest son, Lee Christopher Ellis, was shot to death on a Los Angeles street in 1998 at age 19. Ellis died of prostate cancer on June 2, 2012, at the age of 72.

Two round mullions separate each casement window, in Nov√Ω Bor, the Czech Republic. A muntin (US), muntin bar, glazing bar (UK) or sash bar is a strip of wood or metal separating and holding panes of glass in a window. Muntins can be found in doors, windows and furniture, typically in western styles of architecture. Muntins divide a single window sash or casement into a grid system of small panes of glass, called \\"lights\\" or \\"lites\\". In UK use a muntin is a vertical member in timber panelling or a door separating two panels. Windows with \\"true divided lights\\" make use of thin muntins, typically 1/2\\" to 7/8\\" wide in residential windows, positioned between individual panes of glass. In wooden windows, a fillet is cut into the outer edge of the muntin to \\"stop\\" the pane of glass in the opening, and putty or thin strips of wood or metal are then used to hold the glass in place. The inner sides of wooden muntins are typically milled to traditional profiles. In the U.S., the thickness of window muntins has varied historically, ranging from very slim muntins in 19th century Greek revival buildings to thick muntins in 17th and early 18th century buildings. Until the middle of the 19th century, it was economically necessary to use smaller panes of glass, which were much more affordable to produce, and fabricate into a grid to make large windows and doors. Many considered the division of a window or glazed door into smaller panes to be more architecturally attractive than use of large panes. In the UK and other countries, muntins (typically called \\"glazing bars\\" in the UK, or \\"astragals\\" in Scotland) were nevertheless removed from the windows of thousands of older buildings during the nineteenth century in favor of large panes of plate glass. Restoration of these buildings in the following century increasingly included reinstatement of the glazing bars, which many now see as an essential architectural element in period buildings. Muntins are often confused with \\"mullions\\" (which separate complete window units), and \\"astragals\\" (which close the gap between two leaves of a double door). Many companies use the term \\"grille\\" when referring to a decorative structure of wood or other material that is put over a single pane of glass to make it look as if there were muntins separating multiple panes of glass. In the UK, the term \\"grille\\" tends to be used only when there are bars sandwiched within the insulated glass glazing unit, and not stuck to the outsides of it. Double- or triple- layer insulated glass can be used in place of ordinary single panes in a window divided by muntins, though this reduces the effectiveness of the insulation. Other insulating glass arrangements include insertion of a decorative grid of simulated metal, wooden or plastic muntins sandwiched between two large panels of glass, sometimes adding another grid of simulated wood muntins facing the interior to produce a more convincing divided light appearance. In furniture In furniture, a muntin is the central vertical member of the framework of a piece of furniture, the outside members being called stiles.Fleming, John & Hugh Honour.

It is a Telecaster with body cavities. Designed by German luthier Roger Rossmeisl in 1968, it was introduced in 1969 and updated in 1972 by replacing the standard Telecaster pickups with a pair of Fender Wide Range humbucking pickups, bullet truss-rod and 3-bolt neck. The design was originally an attempt to reduce the weight of the solid-body Telecaster guitar, which had become ever heavier throughout the 1960s due to the dwindling supply of the light ash wood Fender had formerly used. The f-hole and reshaped pickguard are the most apparent visual clues to its construction. There have been many different versions of the Telecaster Thinline over the years, although the original two are more recognizable. The 1969 version has two standard single-coil pickups and a mahogany body, while the 1972 version, based on the Fender Telecaster Deluxe, has two Fender Wide Range humbucking pickups and a natural swamp ash body. Thinline versions have been made in Mexico and Japan as a part of the Classic Series of guitars and basses, followed by higher-end American-made Factory Special Run (FSR) versions from the Fender Custom Shop in 2005 and 2013. A much lower price Thinline design was produced in China and featured P-90 pickups and a mahogany body. While it retained the \\"Fender Telecaster\\" name on the headstock, it was not labeled as a Thinline, although the F-hole design and hollow construction makes its heritage obvious. 1990s Telecaster Thinline This short-lived model was based on the '69 Telecaster Thinline, but used many of the modern features found on the first-generation American Standard Series guitars manufactured between 1986 and 2000. It was introduced in 1998 and discontinued at the beginning of the 21st century. 2004 FSR American Vintage Telecaster Thinline In 2004, a few thinlines were made for the Yamano company in Japan. These are all USA Fender models made in the Corona factory. Though they were built strictly for sale in Japan, some seemed to make it straight to the United States for sale. Fender Cabronita Thinline Telecaster For two years, 2012 and 2013, Fender offered the Cabronita model as a Thinline in Shoreline Gold and a swamp ash bodied white blonde model. These were built in their Ensenada, Mexico plant. Squier Thinline Telecasters Fender's subsidiary company Squier also makes entry level Thinline Telecasters. This includes the Master Series Thinline Telecaster, the Vintage Modified Series Thinline Telecaster, and the Classic Vibe Thinline Telecaster. The Master Series features twin Duncan Designed P-90 style single coil pickups, 2 volume and 2 tone controls and a 3-position toggle switch. The Vintage Modified Series is more traditional, based around the '69 Fender Thinline, featuring 2 Duncan Designed single coil pickups, 1 volume and 1 tone control with a 3-position toggle switch. The Classic Vibe Thinline Telecaster is also based on the '69 Fender Thinline, but features a mahogany body, and Alnico V single coil pickups.

Dallas Morning NewsStaff report (September 25, 1996). Ex-Senate candidate indicted in fraud case. The Advocate Kirk's \\"LaSalle University\\" was shut down in 1996 following a raid by the FBI. Kirk was indicted for tax fraud in 1996 and, after a plea agreement, was sentenced to five years in U.S. federal prison. Kirk later died in January 2008.  History  The University of San Gabriel Valley was a correspondence law school based in California. At the time, California's regulations allowed for authorization of a degree program if the prospective operator provided a list of faculty and courses and demonstrated $50,000 in assets, and Southland met California's requirements. In 1984 Time reported that a former Southland registrar said that the school had granted a bachelor's degree in engineering based on the student's short r√©sum√© and had awarded a law degree to a real estate agent on the basis of an exam designed to test legal assistants. Time quoted Kirk, who claimed he no longer operated Southland, as saying he \\"had no interest as an educator,\\" but the school \\"was a good way to make money.\\"Ellie McGrath, Education: Sending Degrees to the Dogs, Time, April 2, 1984 Renamed LaSalle University, Kirk later moved it to Mandeville, Louisiana. According to John Bear, a renowned authority on diploma mills who consulted for the FBI, Kirk set up \\"World Christian Church\\" in Louisiana, placed the university in the ownership of the \\"church\\" to claim religious exemption from state education laws, and claimed to have taken a vow of poverty. In the mid-1990s, LaSalle provoked the attention of authorities because of evidence that government workers had been awarded promotions and salary increases based on fraudulent advanced degrees. According to a prosecutor with the Attorney General's office, more than a dozen known diploma mills had been set up in Louisiana, where the laws were particularly lenient. Federal investigators estimated that LaSalle, alone, had issued in excess of 40,000 fake diplomas, the bulk of them to government employees. In fact, LaSalle's sales and marketing materials highlighted the fact that many of its graduates occupied high positions in government. The school was shut down after a July 1996 raid by the FBI, U.S. postal inspectors, and the Internal Revenue Service. According to John Bear, the U.S. Attorney wrote to every person in the LaSalle files, officially informing them that LaSalle was nothing more than a diploma mill. All were advised that funds were available for refunds, providing they turned in their diploma(s). Many didn't, presumably so they could continue to parlay their degrees for more money in the marketplace, with impunity (they could always claim ignorance, later). The FBI report stated that LaSalle had only one faculty member serving 15,000 students (and her only degree was a Bachelor's from LaSalle). Furthermore, the back of the student application forms contained a disclaimer advising students that their signatures simply made them Ministers of Kirk's World Christian Church, and that any degrees they might get would merely be religious degrees, regardless of the subject.Bear, John, quoted on www.degreeinfo.com. Distance Learning Discussion June 29, 2009. Kirk was charged with 18 criminal counts, including mail fraud, tax violations, and other crimes.Sara Shipley, \\"Charges Filed Against LaSalle Pair,\\" The Times-Picayune, January 28, 1997 At the time of his arrest, the operation was discovered to have more than $35 million in bank deposits, current cash deposits of $10 million, and other assets.Glen Justice and Bill Voelker, \\"LaSalle Suspect Turns Himself In,\\" The Times-Picayune, October 1, 1996 Ultimately Kirk entered a plea agreement in which he was sentenced to five years in federal prison and was ordered not to operate any more schools.

It continued to operate under the LaSalle name from January 1999 until October 2000, during which time all academic work was intended to meet accepted academic standards. Beginning in October 2000 and continuing until its final closure in the summer of 2002 it used the name Orion College.Bears' Guide to Earning Degrees by Distance Learning by John B. Bear & Mariah P.

Notable incidents involving LaSalle University credentials  In 2000, in Texas, it was reported that a nutritionist advising U.S. Olympic swimmers Dara Torres and Jenny Thompson on the use of dietary supplements had received a doctorate degree in nutrition counseling from LaSalle University. In 2001, the Coquille Valley Sentinel profiled a hospital administrator who had asserted both a master's degree and a Ph.D. in Business Administration, from LaSalle University in Philadelphia.Richardson, Janet.

Richard Cormier had been newly selected for the head administrator role with Coquille Valley Hospital, when it was discovered that he had been lying about his education. When questioned, Cormier presented copies of his diplomas, both of which were awarded in October 1994 by Kirk's outfit in Louisiana. Shortly thereafter, Cormier recanted his acceptance of the position. In 2002, Stephen J.

In 2007, the Post Star (Glens Falls, NY) reported on the controversy of candidate Nathan York running for Warren County Sheriff when he included a bachelor's degree from LaSalle University on his campaign literature. In 2008, the Ethics Review Committee of the Georgia Professional Standards Commission (PSC) suspended the Georgia Educator certificate of one of its teachers. According to the published minutes, a high school science teacher in the Savannah- Chatham County School System had cited a Ph.D. from LaSalle University on his 2005 application for certification. Because the dates of enrollment conflicted with those shown on his employment application, the degree was called into question. The teacher could not explain the credits on his transcript, and he acknowledged that he never actually completed a written dissertation. Ultimately, he admitted that the degree from LaSalle was illegitimate, although he had been receiving a higher salary because of it. Consequently, the Commission sanctioned the teacher for misrepresenting his qualifications, stating that \\"the school system cannot have confidence in a teacher who would cheat the system by buying their doctorate degree online.\\"Minutes of the Georgia Professional Standards Commission February 14, 2008, pp. 10-11.

In March, 1926, Mr Mortimer C. Ritter, with Miss Jessie R. Dutton and Mr. Federick G. Bruck came to the third floor loft of the Greeley Arcade Building and with two classes, one in dressmaking and the other in garment cutting, organized what was to develop into the Central Needle Trades High School. The school building was completed in 1941 as the Central High School of Needle Trades.About the school at its official websiteChronology of school  Auditorium murals  These murals were painted between 1939 and 1940 by Ernest Fiene.Ernest Fiene's workArt: \\"Fiene's Whopper\\", Time. 1 July 1940. and have landmark status.Murals descriptions, adapted and condensed from a student handbook written in the late 1950s.

In his creative works Burger often focused on society's lonely outsiders and, increasingly, the inevitability of death. His virtuosity in applying literary styles and use of thorough research are significant features of many of his publications.  Life  Hermann Burger was born in 1942 in Menziken, Canton of Aargau; his father worked for an insurance company. He enrolled at the ETH Zurich in 1962 and began studying architecture, but switched to German literature and art history in 1964. The publication of the poetry collection \\"Rauchsignale\\" (\\"Smoke Signals\\") in 1967 marked the beginning of his literary career, followed by the prose collection Bork in 1970. For the next couple of years Burger focused on his career in literary studies, writing his thesis on Paul Celan and his habilitation treatise on contemporary Swiss literature. He taught at universities in Zurich, Bern and Fribourg and worked as a literary editor for the Aargauer Tagblatt. His academic experience is reflected in the loosely autobiographical novel \\"Die k√ºnstliche Mutter\\" (\\"The Artificial Mother\\") which won him the Conrad- Ferdinand-Meyer-Preis in 1980. It was dedicated to his wife and its first edition has the dedication ‚ÄûF√ºr Anne Marie‚Äú. Burger's first major novel \\"Schilten. Schulbericht zuhanden der Inspektorenkonferenz\\" (\\"Schilten. School Report for the Attention of the Inspectors' Conference\\") was published in 1976 and made into a movie by Swiss film director Beat Kuert in 1979. It is about a teacher who has to tell the conference of inspectors about the development of his pupils, but speaks about death cult, graveyards and burials in a very detailed way. Archetypes of this novels are Franz Kafka and Thomas Bernhard. Burger mixes reality and fiction, and the more one reads about him, the more one finds out, that Burger writes about himself, his own suffering. He won the Ingeborg Bachmann Prize in 1985 for his story \\"Die Wasserfallfinsternis von Badgastein\\" (\\"The Waterfall-Eclipse of Badgastein\\"). 1988, a changing of publishers from S. Fischer to Suhrkamp took place in a spectacular way. The novel Brenner (in two volumes, four were planned), shows a protagonist wrapped in cigar smoke, who tells his life - Burger himself was a cigar smoker and descendant of cigar producers. Volume 1 has exactly 25 chapters, like a cigar box contains 25 cigars. Each chapter's name contains the name of a famous cigar brand. The second chapter announces the author's suicide intention: A red Ferrari is bought, because saving money no longer makes sense. It is about the divorce and the grief about having no contact to his two kids. Burger's last lessor was emeritus historian Jean Rudolf von Salis (= ‚ÄûJ√©r√¥me von Castelmur-Bondo‚Äú in the novel). The last months of Burger's life and a review on his 46 years are described detailed in this roman a clef, he describes all coining persons (under changed names). Burger's depressive and desperate moods grew with his literary acclaim, leading him to write the \\"Tractatus logico- suicidalis\\" (1988), a collection of aphorisms advocating suicide. The 1046 aphorisms are about the sentence ‚ÄûGegeben ist der Tod, bitte finden Sie die Lebensursache heraus.‚Äú (Death is given, please finde the cause of life.) The title remembers Ludwig Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. The book about suicide was viewed by the critics with sarcasm, and the seriousness of his suicide plans were not recognized. On February 28, 1989 he committed suicide in Brunegg by taking an overdose of sleeping pills. Not until Burger's death the critics saw similarities to Jean Am√©ry and his book Hand an sich legen (that Burger knew). Burger's early promoter Marcel Reich-Ranicki, literature critic, wrote March 3, 1989, few days after his death, in an obituary: ‚ÄûHermann Burger war ein Artist, der immer aufs Ganze ging, der sich nicht geschont hat. Er war ein Mensch mit einer gro√üen Sehnsucht nach dem Gl√ºck. Die deutsche Literatur hat einen ihrer originellsten Sprachk√ºnstler verloren.‚Äú (‚ÄûHermann Burger was an artist who went the whole hog every time, didn't conserve himself. He was a man with a big longing for happiness. The German literature has lost one of her most inventive language artists.\\") His work‚Äîmainly prose‚Äîwas coined by very precise investigation. He e.g. has sworn the magic oath because he wanted to write about a magician (in Diabelli). The oath created a fascinating new challenge for him: Describing Diabelli's tricks without breaking the oath. Burger was very faithful in linguistic matters, too. When he was young and wanted to build his style of writing, he did copy passages out of literature (e.g. by Thomas Mann) and filled their syntax with new content. The protagonists of his novels and narrations try to describe the situation of their lives in a way that is linguistically virtuosic and in love with details. Those protagonists mostly are diseased and the receiver of their texts is very often a higher authority, e.g. the ‚ÄûInspektorenkonferenz‚Äú (inspector's conference) in \\"Schilten\\" (1976).

Mitchell's work details the true story of the eponymous Joe Gould, a writer who lived in Greenwich Village in the first half of the 20th century. Gould was an eccentric, bridging the gap between bohemianism and the beat generation, though he was an outspoken critic of both. This criticism alienated him from the social circles of poets, authors, and artists of his time, and instead he focused on documenting the history of what he called the \\"shirt-sleeved multitude.\\" Plot By observing the lives of those around him and recording the goings-on, Gould set about compiling an exhaustive record of modern life he called the \\"Oral History.\\" He claimed that oral history held more truth than the formalized history of textbooks and professors, as it gave voices to the lower classes that were representative of true humanity. In the 1920s, Gould had small portions of his \\"Oral History\\" published in magazines, but in the years that followed he became more secretive and eccentric. He was well-known among the local shopkeepers, artists, and restaurateurs, many of whom gave him handouts of money or food in support of his project. Mitchell met Gould in 1942 and wrote the profile \\"Professor Sea Gull\\" on him for The New Yorker. The first part of Joe Gould's Secret is made up of this profile, covering the period from Gould's graduation from Harvard University in 1911, leading up to the writing of his \\"Oral History\\", said to be composed of 20,000 conversations and 9,000,000 words. The second part of the book is a more personal memoir of Mitchell's experiences with Gould, their eventual falling out, and his discovery of Joe Gould's secret: that the \\"Oral History\\" did not exist. Gould suffered from writer's block and hypergraphia; while to those around him he appeared to be taking constant notes--a notion he was happy to reinforce--he was, in fact, re-writing the same few chapters dealing with seemingly trivial events in his own early life. He had filled countless notebooks with edited versions of these events, evidently searching for meaning in the revisions. Out of respect, Mitchell waited several years after Gould's death to reveal the secret. He wrote the second article in 1964, and combined it with the original article in book form in 1965. Mitchell's pieces on Gould were later collected along with many of his other prominent works in the volume Up in the Old Hotel, published in 1992. Film adaptation Mitchell's stories on Gould were adapted for the screen and directed by film auteur Stanley Tucci. The film was released in 2000 as an independent starring Ian Holm as Gould, Tucci as Mitchell, and Hope Davis as Mitchell's wife, with Susan Sarandon and Steve Martin in supporting roles. The film met with critical success, but remains relatively little-known. Several years after its release, it was praised as \\"a beautifully realized visual re-creation of exactly the time and place - Greenwich Village in the mid-1940s - when this Hippos story [by Burroughs and Kerouac] takes place, and thus the reader might do well to screen the movie to help in reimagining these settings, so distant now in time.\\" The sets were created by Broadway and film designer Andrew Jackness.

The name was a play on the word \\"druthers\\", and the mascot was a giant female bee named Queenie Bee. In 1981, Burger Queen changed to Druther's restaurants, although the changes were mostly cosmetic. One reason given for the name change was to eliminate the perception that they specialized in only hamburgers when they also had fried chicken and a serve-yourself salad bar. Druther's featured a character named \\"Andy Dandytale\\" on its kids meal items (and a live-action version in early TV advertising). The chain's slogan was \\"I'd Ruther Go to Druther's Restaurant.\\" History Druther's traces its history back to 1956, when Harold and Helen Kite opened the first Burger Queen restaurant in Winter Haven, Florida. In 1961, business partners George Clark and Jim Gannon bought franchise rights and permission to expand the chain to Kentucky. The Louisville partners James Gannon and brothers George and John Clark eventually bought the Florida-based company. George Clark eventually became CEO while his other partners left the company. The company opened its 50th location in December 1973 in Danville and had locations in Kentucky, Indiana and Tennessee at the time of the opening. In June 1981, Burger Queen Enterprises Inc. announced that it was changing its name to Druther's International Inc. and changing the names of it restaurants from Burger Queen to Druther's Restaurant. Despite the change in names, management and the menu remained the same. At the time of the announcement, the company operated 171 company-owned and franchised locations in seven states within the United States and also had international franchised in England, Canada, the Republic of China, and the United Arab Emirates. In September 1990, privately owned Druther's International Inc. agreed to become a Territory Operator for Dairy Queen and converted most of its restaurants to the Dairy Queen brand by the end of the first quarter of 1991. At the time of the conversion, Druther's had operated 145 restaurants in Kentucky and surrounding states. Druther's International later renamed itself Druther's Systems Inc. to better fit its new role as a Dairy Queen franchise operator. In 1996, International Dairy Queen Inc. bought 31 Dairy Queen/Brazier outlets in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Indiana from Druther's Systems Inc. for an undisclosed price. Former Druther's locations in Louisville, Kentucky currently house other businesses such as a Burger King and a local liquor store called Our Place Liquors. The last operating Druther's, a former franchise, is in Campbellsville, Kentucky. As of 2019, there are 2 active Burger Queen locations in Taipei, Taiwan.

Donncha was a common ‚Äúfirst name‚Äù in 9th Century Ireland, and when the use of surnames became more common in Ireland around the 10th Century, many people looked to a respected common ancestor to form a surname. The ancestors of the modern Donahues took the name O‚ÄôDonnchadha, meaning \\"the son of Donnacha\\" or \\"of the line of Donnacha\\". The modern Donahues are descended from one of at least eight unrelated Donnachas, each of whose descendants adopted the surname O‚ÄôDonnchadha. There are eight known O'Donoghue tribal areas in Ireland; in Munster the areas of Tipperary, Cork and Kerry, then there are Kilkenny, Wicklow, Dublin and Meath in Leinster and in Connaught there are Galway, Mayo, Sligo and Cavan. Considerable migration took place over the centuries and family groups took root in many other counties (e.g. Clare, Limerick, Waterford, Roscommon, and others), which would today be recognised as their areas of origin. The Donohoes of the ancient Kingdom of Breifne, centered in modern-day Co. Cavan, are genetically linked to 4th- century Irish warlord Niall of the Nine Hostages. When the name O‚ÄôDonnchadha became Anglicized, at least 30 different spellings developed in Ireland, but by the 19th Century the most common spelling was \\"Donohoe.\\" Of 2,800 families reporting variations of the name at the time of Griffith‚Äôs Valuation (1847-1864), 2,483, or 88%, were listed as ‚ÄúDonohoe.‚Äù None were listed as ‚ÄúDonahue.‚Äù The name distribution geographically during this same period reflects that there were significant clusters of Donohoes found in various parts of Ireland, including County Cavan, County Cork, County Galway, and County Kerry.

He was the W.T. Doherty-Welch Foundation Chair and Distinguished Professor of Chemistry at Texas A&M; University. He authored over 1600 scientific articles. Cotton was recognized for his research on the chemistry of the transition metals. Education Frank Albert Cotton (known as \\"Al\\" Cotton, or \\"F Albert\\" on publications) was born on April 9, 1930 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He attended local public schools before Drexel University and then Temple University. After earning his BA degree from Temple in 1951, Cotton pursued a Ph.D. thesis under the guidance of Sir Geoffrey Wilkinson at Harvard University where he worked on metallocenes. He received his Ph.D in 1955. Independent career Following his graduation from Harvard, Cotton began teaching at MIT. In 1961, at thirty-one years of age, he became the youngest person to have received a full professorship at MIT. His work emphasized both electronic structure and chemical synthesis. He pioneered the study of multiple bonding between transition metal atoms, starting with research on rhenium halides, and in 1964 identified the quadruple bond in the ion. His work soon focused on other metal-metal bonded species,Cotton, F. A.; Walton, R. A. \\"Multiple Bonds Between Metal Atoms\\" Oxford (Oxford): 1993. . elucidating the structure of chromium(II) acetate. He was an early proponent of single crystal X-ray diffraction as a tool for elucidating the extensive chemistry of metal complexes. Through his studies on clusters, he demonstrated that many exhibited \\"fluxionality\\", whereby ligands interchange coordination sites on spectroscopically observable time-scales. He coined the term \\"hapticity\\" and the nomenclature that derives from it. In 1962 he undertook the crystal structure of the Staphylococcal nuclease enzyme, solved to 2√Ö resolution in 1969, published in 1971, and deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB code 1SNS) as one of the first dozen protein crystal structures. In 1972 Cotton moved to Texas A&M; University as the Robert A. Welch Professor of Chemistry. The following year he was named the Doherty-Welch Distinguished Professor of Chemistry. He also served as the director of the university's Laboratory for Molecular Structure and Bonding. Pedagogical influence In addition to his research, Cotton taught inorganic chemistry. He authored Chemical Applications of Group Theory.Cotton, F. A., Chemical Applications of Group Theory, John Wiley & Sons: New York, (1st ed. 1963, 3d ed. 1990). This text focuses on group theoretical analysis of bonding and spectroscopy. Among college students, Cotton is perhaps best known as the coauthor of the textbook Advanced Inorganic Chemistry, now in its sixth English edition.Wiley: Advanced Inorganic Chemistry, 6th Edition Coauthored with his thesis advisor, Sir Geoffrey Wilkinson, and now with coauthors Carlos Murillo and Manfred Bochmann, the textbook is colloquially known as \\"Cotton and Wilkinson.\\" The text surveys coordination chemistry, cluster chemistry, homogeneous catalysis, and organometallic chemistry.Cotton, F. A. and Wilkinson, G., Advanced Inorganic Chemistry, John Wiley and Sons: New York, (1st ed. 1962, 6th ed. 1999). Cotton served on various editorial boards of scientific journals, including those of the Journal of the American Chemical Society, Inorganic Chemistry, and Organometallics. He chaired the Division of Inorganic Chemistry of the ACS and was an ACS Councillor for five years. He served on the U.S. National Science Board (1986‚Äì1998), which oversees the National Science Foundation, and the Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee of Argonne National Laboratory, and the National Research Laboratory Commission of Texas. Cotton supervised the thesis research of 116 doctoral students as well as more than 150 postdoctoral associates.Obituary in Current Science 92, 844 (25 March 2007) Recognition Among the awards Cotton received included the U.S. National Medal of Science in 1982,National Science Foundation - The President's National Medal of Science the Wolf Prize in 2000; and the Priestley Medal, the American Chemical Society's highest recognition, in 1998. In 1995, the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&M; along with the local section of the American Chemical Society, inaugurated the annual F.A. Cotton Medal for excellence in chemical research. A second award named in his honor, the F. Albert Cotton Award for Synthetic Inorganic Chemistry,F. Albert Cotton Award in Synthetic Inorganic Chemistry is presented at the National Meeting of the American Chemical Society each year. Cotton was a member of the National Academy of Sciences in the United States, and the corresponding academies in Russia, China, the United Kingdom, France, and Denmark, as well as the American Philosophical Society. He received twenty-nine honorary doctorates. Run for ACS presidency Cotton caused a controversy in his run for President of the American Chemical Society for 1984, wherein he mailed a letter to selected members describing his opponent as \\"a mediocre industrial chemist\\".Candid Science: Conversations with Famous Chemists.

A large force of warriors in the Western Confederacy attacked a fort held by United States soldiers deep in Ohio Country. The United States suffered heavy losses, but maintained control of the fort. The battle exposed a division in the Western Confederacy's military strategy at a time when they seemed to hold the advantage, and the United States pressed farther into the Northwest Territory. Background At the end of the American Revolutionary War, Great Britain ceded control to the United States the territories northwest of the Ohio River and south of the Great Lakes. The United States wanted to capitalize on the lands to pay debts, but the Western Confederacy of Native American nations united to maintain the border with the United States at the Ohio River. This initiated the Northwest Indian War. In St. Clair's Defeat of 1791, United States forces were decisively defeated by a combined army of Delaware, Miami, and Shawnee warriors. In response, the nascent United States created a large professional army, called the Legion of the United States. The Legion's commander, Major General Anthony Wayne, ordered construction of a series of forts to secure the supply route north from Fort Washington. He deliberately ordered Fort Recovery to be built on the grounds of St. Clair's 1791 defeat. In January 1794, Wayne reported to Knox that 8 companies and a detachment of artillery under Major Henry Burbeck had claimed St. Clair's battleground and had already built a small fort. By June 1794, Fort Recovery had been reinforced by a detachment of 250 soldiers, and the Legion had recovered four copper cannons (two six-pound and two three-pound), two copper howitzers, and one iron carronade from St. Clair's defeat in 1791. That same month, a large gathering of the Western Confederacy departed their encampments on the Auglaize River. They were acting on news that the British could soon be at war with the United States, and Blue Jacket took the opportunity to secure the support of British agents and traders in the region. Blue Jacket was convinced that another decisive battle would secure a final victory in the war, and he gained support from the Shawnee, Odawa, Potawatomi, Lenape, and Ojibwe. The Miami war chief Little Turtle did not want to engage the Legion without artillery, and dissuaded most of the Miami from joining this expedition. Blue Jacket did not intend to strike Fort Recovery specifically, using scouts to locate the best opportunity. By 25 June, the combined force had encamped within 20 miles of Fort Recovery, and moved towards the fort in a mass formation that was so large that the warriors outnumbered the available firearms. This army hunted as it traveled, using up available ammunition along the way. Reconnaissance patrols were sent to find the locations of United States forces. On 27 June, a scout detachment of Odawas and Ojibwe met a U.S. detachment of Choctaws and rangers from the Legion. CPT Bobb Sallad of the rangers was killed, while the rest escaped. They arrived at Fort Greenville the next day and reported a \\"great force\\" of Native Americans advancing with \\"a great number of white men.\\" Wayne received a follow-up report that a large hostile force was about to attack the Legion's supply lines, and that Fort Recovery had only three days of provisions. On 28 June, the confederation force encamped along the road between Fort Recovery and Fort Greenville. Here a debate arose on their next move. Blue Jacket wanted to attack the Legion's road south of Fort Greenville, cutting off supplies and reinforcements to the Legion's forts. Reconnaissance had noted movement near Fort Recovery, however, and the majority argued that it would be easier to attack the fort at the farthest reaches of the supply line. According to William Wells, the head of the Legion's reconnaissance companies, the entire Native American army was placed under the nominal command of an Odawa called Bear Chief, perhaps due to the large numbers of northern tribes who had journeyed south to join the campaign.Of the 1,200 confederacy warriors who attacked Fort Recovery, about 800 were Odawa and Ojibwa. These northern nations also suffered the most significant casualties. Sword, pp. 277-8 An estimated 1,200 warriors of the confederacy encamped just south of Fort Recovery and prepared an ambush. Battle Early on 30 June, a company of Choctaws and Chickasaws under CPT James Underwood arrived at Fort Recovery. Although none of them could speak English, they were able to communicate a large enemy presence and many shots fired. CPT Gibson sent a reconnaissance patrol around Fort Recovery, but finding nothing abnormal, the fort resumed normal operations and the farm animals were released to graze freely. Later that morning, a supply column left Fort Recovery for Fort Greenville, while the security detail finished breakfast at the fort. The column had gone about a quarter-mile when a small party of confederate warriors attacked the supply column and drove them back to the fort, while the rest of the army remained in position. At the sounds of gunfire and fleeing herd animals, the Legion quickly sent a reaction force of dragoons along the road and riflemen in the woods. The main body of the confederate force waiting until the dragoons were at close range, then fired a mass volley which killed several of the dragoons and horses, including the officer in charge, Major William McMahon. The riflemen under Captain Asa Hartshorn were flanked by small parties and cut off from the fort, then attacked by the main body. An injured Hartshorn was confronted by Thomas McKee, who demanded his surrender. CPT Hartshorn swung his pike at McKee and was quickly killed by McKee's slave and a Native American warrior. CPT Gibson sent a detachment under LT Drake to cover the retreat to the fort. They advanced to the edge of the forest with bayonets and momentarily slowed the confederacy's advance, but were soon forced to retreat. LT Drake had to be dragged back to the fort after being shot. The Legion's dragoons cut a retreat back to the fort, losing thirty-two killed (including Cornet Daniel Torrey) and thirty wounded, while inflicting an unknown number of casualties on their attackers. Some of the dragoons took shelter at a detached blockhouse by a stream, but most were forced to retreat again to the main fort. Many confederate warriors tried to capture the horses during the dragoon's retreat. The blockhouse itself remained under Corporal White and 6 privates, who may have killed more confederate warriors than the rest of the Legion inside the main fort. The Native Americans captured or scattered several hundred pack horses used for supply convoys. The Native Americans had only suffered 3 killed in the coordinated ambush, but Odawa and Ojibwa forces attacked the fort directly. A party of British officers under CPT Matthew Elliott argued against the attack, since they had already inflicted great damage on the Legion but had little chance of success against the fort. The attack was quickly neutralized by defenders from within the safety of the fort, including infantry, dragoons, and Chickasaw scouts. CPT Gibson also brought up the recovered artillery to defend the fort. The cannons did not seem to have a significant direct effect on the confederate force, but caused some warriors to flee. They refused to retreat, however, keeping the fort closed while a British artillery crew searched for the cannon's buried after St. Clair's defeat in 1791. Blue Jacket had no choice but to support the futile attack, which lasted until nightfall. The Chickasaw and Choctaw scouts managed to get behind the confederate line and shot some Ojibwe and Odawa warriors in the back. This spawned accusations by the northern nations that they had been fired upon by rival Shawnee. A rumor had already spread that some late-arriving Odawa reinforcements had harassed Shawnee women at Grand Glaize. Sword, p. 278 The scouts also observed a crowd of commanders, which included at least three British officers in red uniforms, a large number of white men, and Simon Girty. One officer, Captain Jean Baptiste Beaubien, was seen near the wood line just out of musket range. A Chickasaw rifleman finally shot him with a double charge of powder; he was carried into the forest but later died. Inflicting few casualties while taking on many, the confederacy decided to retire to the forest. That night, they attempted a surprise attack on the fort. It lasted nearly two hours, but accomplished little. Shots continued through the night, as soldiers from within the fort fired upon Native Americans who were gathering their dead and wounded. During the night, a scouting company under Captain William Wells reported that there were British officers behind the Indian lines, and that they had brought powder and cannonballs, but no cannons. They were looking for U.S. cannons that had been buried after St. Clair's defeat, not knowing that these had already been recovered by the Legion of the United States. The British officers recovered one cannon, but were unable to utilize it; one later stated that \\"had we two barrels of powder, Fort Recovery would have been in our possession with the help of St. Clair's cannon.\\" The next day, 1 July, some among the confederate forces attacked the fort again, but they began to withdraw by noon, and they were gone by nightfall. Aftermath On 2 July, the CPT Gibson sent burial details. They were fired on by a few remaining Native Americans, but the two sides did little more than exchange angry words from a distance. CPT Gibson counted 35 dead, 43 wounded, 20 captured or missing. In addition, 46 horses were killed and 9 wounded, while the confederacy captured 204 horses and 30 cattle. Wayne sent an emergency resupply train to the fort, fearful that the confederacy may regroup. Wayne finally arrived at Fort Recovery a month later, calling the garrison the \\"bravest boys in the world.\\" Estimates of confederate casualties varied significantly, from 17 in earlier reports to an inflated number of 130 in later reports. William Wells concluded over the years that between 40-50 had died, and nearly 100 wounded, some of whom later died. The leaders of the Western Confederacy were sharply divided after the battle. The Odawa accused Blue Jacket of cowardice for not fully supporting the direct assault on Fort Recovery. Blue Jacket was angry that his plan to attack Fort Greenville was rejected, and that the Odawa had directly attacked Fort Recovery after their initial success. The Odawa and Ojibwa departed for their homes to bury their dead, determined that they had done their part for the Confederacy. British MAJ William Campbell, commandant of Fort Miami, requested reinforcements when he received word of the battle. Governor John Graves Simcoe received the report and wrote on 10 July \\"I conceive war inevitable.\\" Little Turtle identified Wayne as a \\"black snake who never sleeps,\\", and insisted that the British provide 20 soldiers and 2 cannons for a renewed attack on Fort Recovery. When the commandant of Detroit, COL Richard England declined to promise this support, Little Turtle warned him that they could not continue to resist Wayne's Legion. Because the fort remained secure, Wayne's army was able to advance north and extend the line of forts. Fort Defiance was built in August, and became the Legion's main staging ground before it met and defeated a combined force under Blue Jacket at the Battle of Fallen Timbers. The following year, representatives from the Western Confederacy and the United States met to negotiate the Treaty of Greenville. This treaty ceded most of the modern state of Ohio to the United States, and used Fort Recovery as a landmark to draw the boundary with Native American lands. Tecumseh was among the Shawnee at Fort Recovery. He would later fight at Fallen Timbers and would form a new pan-tribal confederation in 1808.

He is the Chairman of the startup AMAbiotics , specialised in metabolic bioremediation and synthetic biology . He was the director of the Department Genomes and Genetics at the Institut Pasteur in Paris where he headed the Genetics of Bacterial Genomes Unit.  Life  He was trained as a mathematician at the Institut Henri Poincar√© and a physicist at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure. Working first with Mildred Cohn, Marianne Grunberg-Manago and Ionel Solomon in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Danchin became an experimental microbiologist in the early seventies. He created with Philippe Courr√®ge and Jean-Pierre Changeux at the Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique in Paris, France, a working seminar where they worked together on the construction of mathematical models of learning and memory.Changeux JP, Courr√®ge P, Danchin A. (1973) A theory of the epigenesis of neuronal networks by selective stabilization of synapses. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 70:2974‚Äì2978. Interested in University training he created, with Maurice Gu√©ron, the first semester of Biology at the √âcole Polytechnique, and developed his teaching during four years. Among his first students one can find Daniel Kahn, Patrick Charnay, and many others. The main goal of his research has been to try to understand how genes can function collectively in the cell. This led him to work on regulation systems which control global gene expression in bacteria. Part of his work was devoted to the study of the enzymes that synthesize cyclic AMP. He established the reference classification of adenylate cyclasesDanchin A. (1993) Phylogeny of adenylyl cyclases.

This convinced him that it was time to investigate genomes as wholes, provided that an important effort in computer sciences was initiated in parallel (in silico biology). Early in 1987 he proposed that a sequencing program should be undertaken for Bacillus subtilis. This proposal was actualized by a European joint effort on this genome, starting in 1988. The complete sequence was published in 1997.Kunst F, Ogasawara N, Moszer I, Albertini AM, Alloni G, Azevedo V, Bertero MG, Bessi√®res P, Bolotin A, Borchert S, Borriss R, Boursier L, Brans A, Braun M, Brignell SC, Bron S, Brouillet S, Bruschi CV, Caldwell B, Capuano V, Carter NM, Choi SK, Codani JJ, Connerton IF, Danchin A, et al. (1997) The complete genome sequence of the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Nature 390: 249‚Äì256. The first significant and unexpected discovery of this work was, in 1991, that many genes (at the time, half of the genes) were of completely unknown function. This led him to try to organize bioinformatics in France with the help of several colleagues at universities, CNRS and INRIA, through the creation of a nationwide group, GDR 1029 (1991‚Äì1995) and subsequently through the coordination of the bioinformatics programme of the Groupement de Recherche et d'Etudes des Genomes (1992‚Äì1996), then at the Comit√© de Coordination des Sciences du Vivant (1998‚Äì2000). Re-sequencing and re-annotation of the B. subtilis genome was completed in 2009 to update the sequence and annotation of this reference genome.Barbe V, Cruveiller S, Kunst F, Lenoble P, Meurice G, Sekowska A, Vallenet D, Wang T, Moszer I, M√©digue C, Danchin A.

In year 2000, Danchin created the HKU-Pasteur Research Centre in Hong Kong, meant to develop microbial genomics in the region, with the help of the Innovation and Technology Commission of the Hong Kong SAR government to develop bioinformatics (programme Biosupport).

He wrote Another Day in Paradise, later made into a film of the same name directed by Larry Clark. Little was also the author of \\"Outlaw LA\\" an ongoing article published in LA Weekly. His writings were a rugged portrayal of coming of age in the underbelly of society and heroin addiction. His books were largely autobiographical, and although his supporting characters tended to be fictional, the narrators were almost parallel with himself.

The unit survived in the Byzantine Empire until the 12th century. Michel Rouche succinctly traced the word's development, especially in the West: \\"The term schola, which once referred to the imperial guard, came to be applied in turn to a train of warrior-servants who waited on the king, to the group of clergymen who waited on the bishop, to the monks of a monastery, and ultimately to a choral society; it did not mean 'school' before the ninth century.\\"Rouche, \\"Private life conquers state and society\\", in Paul Veyne, ed. A History of Private Life: I. From Pagan Rome to Byzantium (Harvard University Press) 1987:429. The imperial Scholae While the singular schola still was used to refer to learning of singing and a mode of writing, the plural had an independent meaning. Next to the old kind of school, the Scholae Palatinae, established by Constantine the Great as a replacement to the Praetorian Guard, was the training center of the imperial palace guard. It remained based at Constantinople, eventually declining to a purely ceremonial role. However, in the 8th century, the Scholae were reformed into one of the elite cataphract Tagmata regiments, and continued to serve until the reign of Alexios I Komnenos.  Non-military scholae  Also, the guilds of notarii (notaries) called themselves one schola, or different scholae. In the 4th century, Pope Sylvester I (died 335) was said to have founded the schola cantorum, reformed by Pope Gregory (died 604), but there was an oral tradition until the written proof for the foundation of this schola from the 8th century.

He enjoyed cult status in the 1969-early 1970s era. In the mid-to-late 1960s, he was a regular performer at many Boston, Massachusetts, clubs and coffeehouses, including the White Whale, Beverly, MA; Damaged Angel and Quest, Boston, MA; and Club 47, Cambridge, Massachusetts. On his debut album, Remember the Wind and the Rain, he plays guitar, banjo, and dulcimer. Brockett was a favorite of devotees of late night progressive rock FM radio stations, particularly with his thirteen- minute-long adaptation of Lead Belly‚Äôs (via Blind Lemon Jefferson) \\"The Titanic\\", rechristened The Legend of the U.S.S. Titanic, co-written with Chris Smither. Brockett has released several albums over his career, including North Mountain Velvet, which has a guest appearance by Ramblin' Jack Elliott. Brockett has lived in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Colorado, Wyoming, and Ohio, among other places. While in Ohio, he supplemented his performance and recording income by teaching guitar. Also while in Ohio, he opened at a local club for folk musician Tom Paxton. Members of the audience included Arlo Guthrie (who was to do a benefit for Friends of the Homeless the next day) and then-governor Dick Celeste. A long-time friend of fellow musician Maria Muldaur, Brockett has also helped manage her career. In March 2012, The Altamont Enterprise & Albany County Post reported in a letter to the editor from John Elberfeld of Knox, NY that Mr. Brockett attended high school in the \\"early sixties at Westboro, MA High School\\". The letter goes on to state that his album, \\"Remember the Wind and the Rain\\" \\"got major airplay\\" and was \\"headed for gold.\\" It also referenced that Jaime \\"played for packed college auditoriums and toured the world\\". This contributor remembers several performances at Union and Skidmore Colleges from 1972 -1974. Brockett played the Union College Coffeehouse on the evening of April 15, 1972. When he was initially reluctant to perform his version of Titanic, coffeehouse proprietor Becky Grant showed him a newspaper clipping, that it was in fact the 60th anniversary of the sinking of the famous ship. He relented, and gave a vigorous rendition of the song, lasting at least one-half hour. The Enterprise also noted that as of March 15, 2012, Jaime Brockett was starting a \\"solo comeback tour\\" in Altamont, NY.

Case Jr. (born March 2, 1955) is an American software engineer and one of the leaders in the development of computer-aided software engineering (CASE) technologies and system development methodologies.  Biography  Case is a graduate of the State University of New York at Buffalo. He began his software development career in 1972 and worked in a variety of IT-related capacities, including director of Management Information Systems for Ryder System and co-founder of Maximus Systems, Inc., developers of the Maximus code generator. In 1982, Case joined start-up Nastec Corporation, a Southfield, Mich. based software development company. In 1989, Case left Nastec Corporation to join Gartner, Inc. (then GartnerGroup), the IT industry research and advisory firm, where he spent the next 13 years as a thought- leading industry analyst, speaker, writer and business executive. After 13 years, Case left Gartner to become an independent consulting executive and entrepreneur, with the goal of applying GST and \\"organizational engineering\\" in the laboratory of live businesses. Case served as a board member for Sky Capital Holdings, a New York-based investment bank; interim president and CEO of DuoCash Corporation, a payment processing services company; and as chairman of the board of eNucleus, InceNucleus Enucleus.com (ENUI.OB) a technology- based business process outsourcing firm; and president and CEO of Turbodyne Technologies, Inc.

He is also the Research Fellow and principal analyst with ES Research Group, Inc.,ES Research Group, Inc. which specializes in helping companies identify, select, implement and measure sales performance improvement programs.  Work  Case of the leaders in the development of computer-aided software engineering (CASE) technologies and system development methodologies. He also was a major contributor to the Spectrum System Development Methodology, from John D. Toellner Associates, developing the Structured Analysis and Structured Design design tips.  Computer-Aided Software Engineering  Nastec Corporation both coined the acronym CASE and launched the DesignAid analysis and design tool and the LifeCycle Manager project configuration and management system. For six years, Case served as Nastec's Vice President for Professional Services and Product Management. Case, and his associate Vaughn Frick developed a second generation structured analysis and design technique based on the Yourdon/Demarco/Constantine Structured Analysis/Structured Design technique. Frick, while working with Case at Nastec Corporation on the development of the PC-based DesignAid product, was the first to specify and teach a comprehensive technique for transforming a structured analysis specification into a structured design. The professional services division quickly became not only the largest component of Nastec Corporation, but also the largest provider of SA/SD education. Case was among the most prolific public speakers on the subject of CASE during the 1980s, helping launch, among other events, the Computer-Aided Software Engineering Symposium as its keynote speaker for its first two years. Case toured the country, promoting the integration of upper CASE and lower CASE with pro-football great and code-generation pioneer Fran Tarkenton, founder of Tarkenton Software. When Tarkenton Software and Nastec Corporation agreed not to merge, Tarkenton teamed up with James Martin and merged Tarkenton Software into KnowledgeWare, a direct competitor to Nastec.  Principles of Computer Aided Software Engineering  Case, also author of the book Information Systems Development: Principles of Computer Aided Software Engineering (Prentice Hall, 1986), was also a lifelong student of general systems theory (GST) and fascinated by the application of structured analysis and design techniques to the design of entire business operations, not just the information technology subsystems. At Gartner, Case quickly ascended the analyst ranks, going from the leading Software Engineering analyst to head of its business process reengineering practice - where he could spend full-time applying GST to business design, launching Gartner's e-Business Resource Center, its Vertical Industries practices and ultimately becoming the founder, group vice president and general manager of Gartner's TCO Software division. From there, Case became head of Gartner's IT benchmarking business and president of Gartner's eMetrix business performance management business. During his 13-year tenure at Gartner, Case launched dozens of product and service lines that accounted for over $100 million in revenue to Gartner.

He first studied at the Spanish-run public school in Montalban, then took his secondary course at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran in Manila, where he completed his Bachelor of Arts in 1896. He then studied law under a private tutor. To help himself in his studies, he worked as a farmer. Political life Rodriguez first served as Municipal President of Montalban, Rizal from 1906‚Äì1916; became Governor of Rizal in June 1916; and was reelected in June 1922. He was appointed mayor of Manila by Governor General Leonard Wood on July 23, 1923, and later served as Representative of Nueva Vizcaya District from February 1924 to May 1925. He became the Representative of the Second District of Rizal in 1925 and was reelected in 1931 and 1934. He was also appointed Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce by Governor Frank Murphy on July 26, 1934, re-appointed by President Manuel L. Quezon on January 15, 1940, and served as such until August 28, 1941. After his resignation as Mayor of Manila, he campaigned for a seat in the Senate and was elected senator in 1941. On May 20, 1953, he was elected Senate President, a position he occupied for the next ten years. As the third highest government official, he steered the Senate into greater heights in terms of legislation. He was replaced by then-Senator Ferdinand Marcos, then the Minority Floor Leader as Senate President in a leadership coup on 1963, ending his long leadership of the Upper Chamber. Rodriguez started his political career as a Democrata or a member of the opposition party, and not until there was a general realignment of parties due to the divisive struggle over the approval of the Independence Law in 1933, did he switch to the majority or the Nacionalista Party, to which he remained faithful until the day of his death three decades later. He nursed the party during its darkest hours, and steered it successfully through the political reefs and typhoons that rocked the local scene, thus earning him the nickname \\"Mr. Nacionalista\\". Unlike many politicians of his time, he did not switch parties for personal convenience. As a legislator, he always supported measures improving the lot of common man, for he knew that the upgrading of the masses was the best way of retaining democracy in the country. Many were sometimes politically at odds with him, but they always found him to be a reasonable opponent who played clean in a game known for its mendacity and unprincipled moves. A man of integrity, who played fair even with his opponents, and who could be generous in victory, Eulogio \\"Amang\\" Rodriguez was a man, a politician and a public official of sterling attributes. He had seven children by his first wife, Juana Santiago, namely Eulogio Jr., Jose, Ruperto, Leonor, Isidro, Constancio and Adelaida. With his second wife, Luisita Canoy, he had three children, namely, Adelaida (Baby), Erlinda and Rafael (Boy). References *Senate of the Philippines *Paras, Corazon.

It is a fictional account of the inner workings of the College of Arms in London. The book follows the exploits of the College's members after the announcement that the current Garter Principal King of Arms will be retiring. Plot summary The book begins with a brief introduction describing the lasting nature of the College of Arms through successive monarchs and governments. Immediately, though, the book shifts its focus to the current set of officers of arms at the College. At the end of the first chapter, Garter Principal King of Arms- the head of the body of heralds - announces his intended retirement from the post in six months time. The announcement by Garter throws the entire College of Arms into confusion. Set in the late 1960s, the retiring King of Arms had led the College since the end of World War II. Each of the other, twelve officers of arms in ordinary begins calculating his own chances of promotion to the top spot. Some continue about their own business, knowing that their dutiful service will be rewarded, however, Cecil Gascoigne, who is Chester Herald, decides he will stop only short of murder in obtaining the coveted office. Slowly, but surely, Cecil Gascoigne begins eliminating his competitors. His methods are diverse, and include devising for a colleague to be caught smuggling illegal substances into England; also using blackmail and bankruptcy to his advantage. Over time, Gascoigne begins grasping that unfortunate problems have befallen his fellow officers, and he is not the cause. Thinking that his competition has him on a list for elimination, Gascoigne begins doubling his efforts; by book's end, four officers of arms have died, and the rest disgraced. As Cecil Gascoigne awaits the inevitable appointment as Garter King of Arms, he is arrested for an arson at the College of Arms that he did not commit. With his staff depleted and the College demoralised, Garter King of Arms decides to shoulder the burden and continue on in his duties. Characters The vast majority of the plot revolves around the thirteen ordinary officers of arms at the college. There are many secondary characters that play minor parts, including the other tenants in Cecil Gascoigne's building, two Polish doormen at the College of Arms, various secretaries, and a mysterious former officer of arms known as Phantom Norroy and Ulster. Garter King of Arms Garter Principal King of Arms is described as a man of great character who was the guiding force behind the College of Arms during World War II. It was this man who kept the College going with a depleted staff. Following the war, he was rewarded with an appointment as Garter King of Arms. It was at a low point in the history of the College that Garter assumed control, and having rebuilt the staff of officers, he has prepared to retire. This retirement sets of the series of events that provide the story line. Chester Herald Cecil Gascoigne is the only officer at the College whose name is given. It is Chester Herald who makes it his life's work to reach the pinnacle of the world of English heraldry. As is expected of every herald, Gascoigne made a thorough search of his genealogy at his appointment. It was then that he discovered his family's original name was 'Gaskin' and that it had been changed to appear more noble. Gascoigne's mother had died when he was young, and his father was a drunkard who caroused with loose women. Gascoigne is personally responsible for the disgrace or death of several of his colleagues. His demise is at book's end, when arrested on suspicion of arson. Clarenceux King of Arms Clarenceux King of Arms is presented in The Heralds as the favourite to succeed to the post of Garter. Clarenceux King of Arms went off to World War II having already secured the second most senior post at the College. After the war, he assumed that he would be promoted to the top spot. Having been passed over, he assumes that the position will be his this time around. He is a very wealthy individual and has a house on Belgrave Square. He maintained a large staff at the College and showered his colleagues with gifts in an attempt to get votes from them. His demise came when he failed to file his income taxes. When Cecil Gascoigne tipped off the tax services of the problem, Clarenceux had a fatal stroke. Norroy and Ulster King of Arms Norroy and Ulster King of Arms is the complete opposite of Clarenceux. When word of Garter's retirement reaches the officers of arms, it is questionable if Norroy and Ulster even notices. His has been a life of hard work. He has become the poster child of the modern College of Arms and the ability of people to work their way up. His tabards are bought second hand as are his books. His colleagues know that his busy life is taken up doing as much work as possible. Norroy and Ulster dies of a heart attack when a mob swamps the College of Arms. Major themes In this novel, Brian Killick takes the reader on a journey into the secret inner politics of the herald's college. This is a world that few people have entered, and Killick's interpretation creates some very interesting personalities. The book is well written, though seen as a trifle contrived. In style, The Heralds has a narrative that is not quite sequential and is similar to Heller's Catch-22. This chronological befuddlement, combined with the convention of calling heralds only by their title can be confusing, but also adds to the humour.

Allusions/references to other works The plot resembles that of Roy Horniman's novel, Israel Rank (1907), on which the film, Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949), is based. In the film the anti-hero murders the six people who stand between him and succession to a Dukedom. He is wrongfully tried in the House of Lords for the murder of his mistress' husband, found guilty and sentenced to hang. On execution day a suicide note is 'found' by his mistress and he is reprieved. The high-sounding family name of the Dukedom in Kind Hearts and Coronets is D'Ascoyne and in Israel Rank it is Gascoyne. The plotter's name in The Heralds is Gascoigne.

Formerly portrayed by Kyle Lowder, the role of Brady has been portrayed by Eric Martsolf since 2008. Martsolf won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2014 for his role as Brady. Brady is the son of John Black and Isabella Toscano, and the grandson of crime boss Victor Kiriakis.  Casting  Kyle Lowder was cast in 2000 when the role was rapidly aged; he exited in 2005. The character was initially played by Alex, Max, and Dash Lucero from May 1992 to September 1994, and subsequently by Eric and Brandon Billings from October 1994 to July 1999. When news broke that the character of Eric Brady would be written out due to Jensen Ackles departing the series, Ken Corday and NBC made the decision to bring a SORAS'd Brady Black to help fill the void of the main focus and be a young hero. The character was then re-introduced as an adult with actor Kyle Lowder who debuted on August 21, 2000. In September 2005, it was announced that NBC had passed on renewing Lowder's contract with Days of our Lives. He last aired September 15, 2005. In August 2008, it was announced that Brady would return to the series. Former Passions actor Eric Martsolf was cast to bring the character back to Salem. He first aired in the role on November 13, 2008. In May 2020, Wes Ramsey revealed he previously auditioned for the role of Brady prior to Martsolf's casting. Storylines=Backstory Brady is born onscreen in 1992 to John Black and his wife, Isabella. Sadly, Isabella died soon after, leaving John to raise Brady on his own. John later marries Marlena Evans, and the two raise Brady and their daughter, Belle, together. Eventually, Brady is sent to a private school away from Salem. 2000‚Äì2005 Brady returns to Salem as a spoiled, disrespectful college student loner who lashes out at everyone, especially Marlena. As a result, he is distrusted by many, including his uncle, Philip Kiriakis, who considers him a freak. However, Chloe Lane, Philip's girlfriend, sees a glimmer of her once ostracized-self in Brady and develops a friendship with him, which eventually turns into something more. The couple marry in 2005, and move to Vienna. By then, Brady had long-since resolved his animosity towards Marlena, becoming a loving son and brother, as well as a responsible, promising executive in his father's fashion and publishing company, Basic Black. After leaving Salem, Brady becomes addicted to drugs. Blaming Chloe for his addiction, Brady's grandfather Victor Kiriakis kidnaps him and places him in a drug rehabilitation clinic. Brady blames Chloe for his addiction and subsequently files for divorce. 2008‚Äìpresent Brady returns to Salem in November 2008 after beating his addiction. Divorced from Chloe, he comes back to Salem to talk things out with her and reunite with his troubled family. Brady and Chloe eventually come to terms with the end of their marriage and decide to remain friends. Brady sensitively deals with a father who does not remember him. Supporting Marlena in her quest to help John regain his memory, Brady foils the plot for revenge leveled against his stepmother, and masterminded by none other than his father's therapist, Dr. Charlotte Taylor. Brady also makes peace with his old flame, Nicole Walker, who was pregnant at the time with EJ DiMera's child. As a peace offering, going through his own recovery, he offers to be her shoulder if she needs help with not drinking while carrying the child. When Nicole suffers a miscarriage, she confides in Brady about it, deeming she would continue to fake her pregnancy, something Brady was not taking kindly to. Brady soon enters into a relationship with Arianna Hernandez, the sister of Rafe Hernandez. After proposing to Arianna, she is framed by Nicole for the Salem muggings. Unable to convince Brady of her innocence, she breaks off the engagement. Determined to reconcile her relationship with Brady, Nicole begins to romance him and they rekindle their broken relationship. Brady soon begins drinking once again, providing worry for his close family and friends. Brady's life continues to spiral downward when Arianna is killed in a hit-and-run car accident. Nicole and Brady subsequently end their relationship once again when Nicole makes an arrangement with EJ, to get visitation with his daughter, Sydney. But when EJ cheats on Nicole with her sister Taylor, Nicole and Brady realize they both still love each other, and are reunited. However, the relationship ends when both of them feel like they have \\"fizzled out\\", and they decide to be good friends as Nicole vows to be independent. However, Nicole is eventually reunited with EJ. In 2011, Titan acquires Mad World Cosmetics, and with it comes the feisty CEO of the company, Madison James. After fighting the sexual tension between them, Brady and Madison eventually sleep together and begin a relationship. Brady also reconciles with his father, John, who returns to town. In early 2012, Brady decides to leave Titan to go back into business with his father at Basic Black. After proposing and it being turned down, Madison's husband Ian McAllister arrives in town, causing a further rift between Madison and Brady. By August 2012, they reconcile and plan to marry. On the day of their wedding, Brady leaves to rescue his friend, Melanie Jonas, who is trapped in the tunnels beneath Salem. An explosion occurs, trapping them inside. They managed to escape, but Brady found out that Madison was killed in the explosion, and he was devastated. In 2013, he starts dating Kristen DiMera and becomes entangled in Kristen's twisted revenge plot against John and Marlena. Brady and Kristen are almost married when he finds out that his fianc√©e raped his step-brother Eric Brady; he breaks up with her and starts drinking again. Brady hates his step-brother for sleeping with Kristen. A few months later in 2014, he meets Theresa Donovan, whom he doesn't like at first, but he eventually ends up sleeping and getting high with her, much to his loved ones' disapproval, thinking she's using him for money and is a bad influence on him. After months of dating, Brady and Theresa take a trip to Las Vegas, where he gets drunk and marries her. Once they get back to Salem, John confronts Theresa leading for her to hit him in the back of the head with a fire poker and sending him into a coma. Theresa blames Brady for the incident and due to his not being able to remember anything he believes the story but charges are not pressed against Brady. Brady gets sober and gets an annulment from Theresa; however, when Kristen comes back it sends him right back into the arms of Theresa. Kristen then begins suggesting that it was Theresa who hit John which Brady deems ridiculous and thinks Kristen is simply jealous of Theresa. Kristen then gets a drug which takes John out of his coma, where he backs up Theresa's story because he wants to keep Brady away from Kristen. Brady later finds out the truth after walking in on a conversation between John and Theresa and proceeds to dump Theresa. However just as he began to cut Theresa out of his life she announces to him that she is pregnant and he is the father. They go and get a pregnancy test done at the hospital where it is revealed that Theresa wasn't pregnant much to the shock of Theresa. Soon after, Brady's old friend Melanie Jonas comes back and starts a rivalry with Theresa much to the disdain of Brady and Daniel. Brady then begins a relationship with Melanie in which she figures out that Theresa really was pregnant, and that Kristen had stolen the embryo before she left town and gave birth to the child, naming it Christopher. When Brady and Theresa are reunited with their baby, they change his name to Tate. After Brady allows Theresa and Tate to move into the Kiriakis Mansion, he begins to fall for Theresa, to the disappointment of Victor. Brady ends up leaving Titan and he, Theresa and Tate move into a townhouse, and he becomes engaged to Theresa. On New Year's Eve of 2015, Brady, his brother Eric, Jennifer Horton, and Daniel Jonas are involved in a tragic car accident due to Eric driving drunk. The accident leaves Daniel brain dead, and Brady in need of a heart transplant. With Maggie's permission, Daniel is taken off of life support and his heart is donated to Brady. Eric is later sent to prison for causing Daniel's death. In August 2016, Tate is kidnapped, but is later found and the kidnapper is revealed to be Kate Roberts, after Victor was accused of being the kidnapper. Later, Theresa leaves Brady and Tate for Crime Lord El Fideo in order to protect them. After her return, Theresa got sole custody of Tate and then left Salem with Tate to go to California to take care of her mother Kimberly after her cancer return. After learning that Kristen is alive and well, who returns to Salem donning a mask, disguising herself as Nicole Walker (Arianne Zucker). She is helped, once again, by Xander Kiriakis (Paul Telfer) in carrying out her plan, which involves trying to seduce Brady while also using Nicole's identity to manipulate Stefan into giving her a place in the family business. Kristen talks her brother Tony, who is alive and still in love with his former wife Anna (Leann Hunley), into marrying her as Nicole in a scheme to take back DiMera Enterprises from Stefan (Brandon Barash) and Gabi Hernandez (Camila Banus). Her scheme and true identity is exposed at John and Marlena's wedding anniversary celebration. While in custody, Kristen admits to Brady that Nicole and her daughter Holly are alive. After making a deal with the D.A., Kristen is set free. She once again sets her sights on getting back with Brady. Kristen discovers that Sarah Horton (Linsey Godfrey) is pregnant and has decided to have an abortion. With the assistance of Dr. Rolf and Xander, she decides to steal Sarah's embryo and implant it in herself, in an attempt to pass the baby off as her own with Brady. Rolf informs Kristen that she is already pregnant after sleeping with Brady while impersonating Nicole, thus making the procedure on Sarah both unnecessary and impossible. Months later, the newborn baby dies, unaware that his newborn daughter Rachel Isabella, who was named after both Kristen's mother Rachel Blake and his mother Isabella Toscano was switched at birth by his cousin Xander under orders from his grandfather Victor to spare the knowledge that his wife Maggie Horton is responsible for the deaths of Adrienne Johnson and her own granddaughter: the real Mackenzie, Rachel is currently being raised as Mackenzie Horton. A year later, Brady was fired from Titan after the death of his daughter Rachel and Kristen left Salem. Brady is currently working for Basic Black with Nicole. Brady is unaware that his baby is alive and has developed cancer and will need a bone marrow transplant from her parents. Mackenzie's life is saved when Gabi donates her bone marrow to escape a prison sentence, but Kristen does not learn the truth until Nicole conducts her own investigation; Nicole admits that as much as she hates Kristen, she also knows a mother's pain of being separated from her child. After finding out his daughter is alive, Brady realizes that his grandfather Victor and his cousin Xander were behind the baby switch that cause Sarah to kidnap Rachel and flee to her cousin Abigail and Chad's apartment in Paris. After learning that Kristen stabbed Victor, Brady took the blame in order to protect her and went to jail. Kristen later tells Lani the truth about Victor's stabbing. Later, Kristen receive a phone call from Rex Brady (Lowder) and with the help of her nephew and Lani's brother Theo Carver (Kyler Pettis), she learns that Rachel and Sarah are in Paris by tracking Rex's phone.

A packing house is a facility where fruit is received and processed prior to distribution to market. Bulk fruit (such as apples, oranges, pears, and the like) is delivered to the plant via trucks or wagons, where it is dumped into receiving bins and sorted for quality and size. In the case of citrus, ripe fruit with a greenish tint is placed in special storage rooms where ethylene gas is used to bring out the color. Obvious \\"culls\\" (fruit that is not suitable to sell for eating due to cosmetic defects) is removed and sold for juice or other uses. Fruit that is ready to be packed into crates or flats is run through a washer and then air-dried. A light coating of natural wax is applied to help the fruit retain moisture and enhance its appeal. The fruit is transported via conveyor belts to the grading tables where it is visually sorted into three grades: top quality, average, and orchard run, and is then carried via belts to the packing tables. During the late 19th century top-grade fruit would be wrapped in printed tissue paper (a technique developed in the town of Orange, California in the 1880s) and placed in the boxes so that the printed names showed between the slats. In the 1920s tissue wrappers were replaced with printed logos, and ultimately paper stickers. Packed fruit is designated by size, based on the average number of pieces it takes to fill a box. In the days of wooden crates, sizes generally ranged from the 100s to the 390s, demonstrating the wide range of sizes. The sizes for the smaller cardboard boxes introduced in the 1950s and still in use today range from the 40s to the 210s, depending upon the variety of fruit being shipped. Today, packing is often still performed by hand, even though Sunkist developed robotic packing machines in the 1980s. Packed boxes are stored in a \\"pre-cooler\\" to prepare them for the trip to market by truck or rail. Fruit was shipped across the country in ventilated railroad cars or insulated boxcars before the advent of the refrigerator car.

The role has been portrayed by John Aniston on and off since 1985. His time on the show has been since 1985 with a storyline driven absence in 2004 when his character was \\"killed off\\" but found alive on the island of Melaswen.  Character history  Victor was born in Nafplion, Greece, and emigrated to the United States with his family as a child. He grew up and spent most of his childhood in rather modest circumstances in Salem, but then returned to Greece with his family as a young man, where he apparently made his fortune on both legitimate and illegitimate fronts. Victor came to Salem in 1985 as an old friend of the Brady clan. As time went on, it was revealed that he was not only a former paramour of Brady matriarch Caroline, and the biological father of Bo Brady, but that he was involved in various underhanded dealings around town. Initially a quiet sponsor of a local drugs-and-prostitution ring, it was eventually fleshed out that Victor was a full-fledged mobster, with Mafia connections in Greece and Italy as well as throughout the US, partnerships and rivalries with other villains (including the nefarious Stefano DiMera), and was the subject of various investigations by the local police and a fictional crime-fighting spy agency called the International Security Alliance (ISA). Victor's organization engaged in many schemes and plots all over the world during the late 80s and early 90s, including selling military secrets to the Soviets, hiding stolen Treasury bonds in Stockholm, Sweden, and stealing a computer disk from the U.S. government that turned out to be made of an indestructible material with various potential military applications. It was during this heyday that even the music played at the beginning of Victor's scenes resembled the main theme of The Godfather. Notably, Victor was the man most responsible for bringing the amnesiac John Black to Salem in 1986, having \\"outbid\\" corrupt ISA chief George Nickerson for Black, who was \\"offered up\\" by the DiMera organization under the guise of possibly being the believed-dead Roman Brady. Victor also was part of the game called \\"The Purse, The Power, and The Pawn\\" in which he, Nickerson and Ileya Petrov; who had taken over the presumed dead Stefano Dimera's criminal enterprise, fought to get money and ultimately the biggest prize of them all; the Pawn, aka John black. Victor had Petrov killed in 1986 outside a cabin. But, in 2016 it came to light that somehow Petrov had moved to the United States in 1987 and worked for an academy that trained assassins which is where John Black was originally trained before having his memory wiped. Though, technically he was trained before that time. The writers changed the storyline. Victor worked to help restore Black's memory and learn his true identity, until Black escaped. (Victor became aware that Black wasn't the real Roman Brady, and was upset that he had been tricked by Stefano DiMera. Information contained in files in his possession ultimately led to the return of the real Roman, the \\"Tale of Two Romans\\" saga, and the surrounding Mexican caper involving the location of an ancient and mysterious Mayan treasure.) Victor is the father of Isabella Toscano. Eventually, Victor \\"semi-retired\\"; in an effort to win the love and respect of his children, he eventually renounced his evil ways and became a legitimate, albeit still ruthless, businessman. However, occasionally Victor will use some of his old underworld connections to help his family and friends out of a jam. The Kiriakis name still commands considerable respect (and fear) in the underworld; few criminals of standing would knowingly or willingly cross Victor Kiriakis (at least without the protection of the DiMeras or some other powerful organization.) At one point, his son Philip, young and irresponsible (probably because he grew up pampered due to his father's wealth,) foolishly became indebted through illegal gambling to a criminal gang, who injured him in a ritualistic manner as a warning to him to pay up. Victor recognized the injury from his old criminal dealings, and, as well as punishing his son Philip, warned the gang's head (who had not realized that his gang was harassing the son of Victor Kiriakis) both verbally and with violent retributory attacks to renounce Philip's indebtedness, blowing up the home of the mob boss by Niko, one of Victor's former bodyguards, after they made sure the home was empty. Even before Victor began his attacks, the man was extremely respectful merely at the realization that he was speaking with Victor Kiriakis, and very frightened and apologetic when he realized that he may have harassed his son. In more recent years, it's been slowly revealed that Victor and the Kiriakis organization still maintains a very strong hand in the underworld, with deals and rivalries with the DiMera family and other criminals. Victor was briefly married to Nicole Walker, who had saved his life when Kate Roberts was trying to have him killed during Greta's coronation. Nicole had an affair with Colin Murphy and Victor wanted a divorce. In February 2004, Nicole got Jan Spears to kill Victor by electrocuting him in his bathtub. Victor survived the attempt on his life and was held prisoner by Andre DiMera with other victims of the Salem Serial Killer. While on Melaswen, Victor kept a low profile and reconnected with his former love, Caroline Brady. Nicole was stunned when Victor returned to Salem in August 2005 and he made it his mission to get revenge. When Phillip went missing in action during his second tour, Victor reverted to his old ways and was disowned by both his son Bo, and grandson Shawn, because he attempted to take Shawn's daughter Claire for Philip (who had raised Claire since birth, believing the child to be legally his). Victor won Philip custody, but Claire was taken out of the country by Belle and Shawn. Philip eventually found them on the island of Tinda Lau, near Australia. After surviving a typhoon in the Pacific, Philip agreed to drop the pursuit of custody if Belle and Shawn would allow him to be a part of Claire's life, to which they were okay with. This disappointed Victor, but he has since learned to accept it. After a brief absence from Salem, Victor made a dramatic return during John Black's funeral, with an extremely moving eulogy to a man who was once his bitter enemy, but eventually became a beloved friend and trusted member of his family and inner circle. Victor made attempts to amend his relationship with Bo. Victor's relationship with Bo rebounded in early 2008 following the death of Shawn Sr. Victor's was there for Caroline and helped support her through her grief. Victor also took an active role in helping Bo overcome his illness by bringing his godson Dr. Daniel Jonas to Salem. Victor suffered from a stroke and was incapacitated at University Hospital under the care of Dr. Daniel Jonas. Somehow, Victor was aware that Bo had received evidence that would possibly implicate Philip in the disappearance of Paul Hollingsworth. Recovering in the hospital from his stroke, Victor commiserated with Kate and expressed his fear that the worst may be yet to come for Philip. On December 22, 2008, Victor asked his grandson Brady Black to be the Vice CEO of Titan Industries. Brady and Arianna found he was once the drug lord before selling his business to EJ DiMera. When Vivian Alamain returns to town, Victor begins dating her once again, and marries her to protect his ex-wife Carly Manning from her wrath. In late 2010 Victor befriends and soon develops feelings for Maggie Horton. While still married to Vivian Alamain, Victor begins to woo the recently widowed Maggie. Vivian is furious, and plots to bury Maggie alive out of jealousy. By chance, it is Vivian who is entombed, and after escaping, traps Maggie. Victor helps save her, but Maggie learns that Victor knew that Vivian had been in the casket and had done nothing. Freed due to lack of evidence against her, Vivian realizes that Victor loves Maggie and not her, and divorces Victor. Maggie and Victor are officially a couple as of March 2011, and have shared one long-awaited on- screen kiss. Victor and Maggie are married as of November 2011. Victor's character has finally developed into that of a rather crusty \\"elder statesman\\" of Salem, maintaining his position as the head of Titan Industries and the mighty Kiriakis family, but delegating more of the \\"heavy lifting\\" on both the legitimate and \\"shadier\\" fronts to other, younger family members and associates. Victor's scenes have become fan favorites of late due to his biting sarcasm and witty one-liners, and his general desire to see family and friends safe and happy as he rounds out his twilight years. In April 2014, Victor hosted his grandnephew Sonny's wedding to Will Horton. While Victor remained happily married to Maggie, his life took a dramatic turn when his much younger brother Deimos showed up in early 2016, blaming him for his imprisonment many years before Victor settled in Salem. Deimos vowed to steal everything that Victor held near and dear, and even arranged for Maggie to have an accident which led her to break her back and become crippled once again. Maggie struggled for many months to regain the use of her legs, dealing with severe depression as a result, but with patience from Victor, was able once again to walk. Victor was shocked also during this time by the sudden murder of his arch-enemy Stefano DiMera by his daughter-in-law, Hope Brady.

Baylor Law School is affiliated with Baylor University and located in Waco, Texas. The school has been accredited by the American Bar Association since 1931, and has been a member of the Association of American Law Schools since 1938. The program offers training in all facets of law, including theoretical analysis, practical application, legal writing, advocacy, professional responsibility, and negotiation and counseling skills. Baylor Law School has been nationally ranked a \\"top-tier\\" law school by various publications in recent years. History Baylor Law School at dusk. Established in 1857, Baylor Law School was the first law school in Texas and the second law school west of the Mississippi River. Law classes continued until 1883 when the school was discontinued. In 1920, the Board of Trustees reestablished the law school (called the Law Department at that time) under the direction of Dean Allen G. Flowers. The school was temporarily suspended from 1943‚Äì1946 as a result of World War II. Bradley J.B. Toben has served as Dean of the Law School since 1991. He is the longest serving dean in the nation among the 203 ABA accredited law schools. Academics Baylor Law School on the banks of the Brazos River. Baylor Law School operates on a quarter system; a student may begin classes in either February (spring quarter), May (summer quarter), or August (fall quarter). The Law School also has four graduating classes per year (coinciding with the end of each quarter including the winter quarter). Each matriculate class has a separate application pool, and applicants are required to apply to the quarter in which they would like to begin (if a student wants to be considered for admission in different quarters a separate application package is required for each). A typical academic year consists of three-quarters, with students choosing to take off the fourth quarter of the year to complete a clerkship or internship. However, students may elect to complete the program in only 27 months by attending every quarter. The school's curriculum is a practical one, focused more on the positive state of the law than a normative one. In addition to the standard Juris Doctor degree, Baylor Law students can obtain a combined JD with either the Master of Business Administration (both traditional and with an emphasis in healthcare administration), the Master of Taxation, the Master of Public Policy and Administration, or the Master of Divinity degree.  First-Year Program  * First-year students are required to take 13 mandatory courses (41 credit hours) with no electives permitted. * The required courses are in: ** Legal Analysis, Research, and Communication (LARC I, II, and III) ** Civil Procedure ** Contracts (I and II) ** Criminal Law ** Criminal Procedure ** Legislation, Administrative Power and Procedure (LAPP) ** Property (I and II) ** Torts (I and II) ** Constitutional Law: Structure and Power ** Constitutional Law: Individual Liberties  Second-Year Program  * The second-year program consists of a mix of mandatory and elective courses. * The four mandatory classes (which must be taken in the student's fourth and fifth quarters) are: ** Basic Taxation Principles for Lawyers ** Business Organizations I ** Remedies ** Trust and Estates * At this point students can choose to concentrate in one of fifteen specialized areas of law: ** Administrative Practice ** Business Litigation ** Business Planning ** Commercial Law ** Criminal Practice ** Estate Planning ** Family Law Practice ** Fiduciary Litigation ** General Civil Litigation ** Healthcare Law ** Intellectual Property ** Intellectual Property Litigation ** Personal Injury Litigation ** Public Interest Law ** Real Estate and Natural Resources  Third-Year and Practice Court  The third-year program consists primarily of the School's Practice Court Program. Practice Court traces its roots to the original school, and was returned in 1922 shortly after the school was reinstituted. Though Practice Court is designed primarily for students who will practice law before trial courts; it is mandatory for all students. The program was ranked by the Princeton Review as ‚Äúarguably the best training ground in the nation for practical lawyering.‚Äù The program is regarded as ‚Äúthe Marine Corps Boot Camp of law schools.‚Äù The program is recognized as one of the most rigorous, most demanding‚Äîyet most rewarding‚Äî law school experiences for the honing of real-world lawyering and leadership skills anywhere in America. The program consists of four courses taught over two quarters: * Practice Court 1: Pre- Trial Practice & Procedure * Practice Court 2: Trial Evidence, Procedure & Practice * Practice Court 3: Trial and Post-Trial Practice, Procedure & Evidence * Professional Responsibility The Practice Court program covers not only mock trials but all aspects of the law and procedure process from the filing of a suit to post-verdict motions.http://www.baylor.edu/law/Advocacy/index.php?id=76233  Law Review  The ' is the law school's official student-run law review. The journal was founded in 1948 and is published three times per year (Fall, Winter and Spring). Students may grade on to the Law Review at the end of their first year or later as upper-quarters, being selected through a write-on competition, or writing a note or comment for the journal that is selected for publication.  Legal Clinics  Students looking for hands-on experience with actual client cases will discover both through Baylor Law's Legal Clinics. As part of the School's commitment to pro bono public service, students step outside the classroom and into the community, meeting and working with clients with real needs and real issues‚Äîmost of who cannot afford a lawyer. Baylor Law currently has five legal clinics: Estate Planning, Immigration, Intellectual Property and Entrepreneurship, Trial Advocacy, and the Veterans Clinic. Over the past few years, more than 1,500 central Texans have been served by Baylor Law students, faculty, and volunteer attorneys. Baylor Law's Director of Clinical Programs, Josh Borderud, was selected in early 2020 to receive the prestigious Sandra Day O‚ÄôConnor Award for Professional Service from the American Inns of Court. The Sandra Day O‚ÄôConnor Award for Professional Service is awarded each year to honor an American Inn of Court member in practice for ten or fewer years for excellence in public interest or pro bono activities.  Employment  According to Baylor's official 2019 ABA-required disclosures, 93.7% of the Class of 2019 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation. Baylor's Law School Transparency under-employment score is 3.9%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2019 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non-professional, short-term, or part-time job nine months after graduation. Costs The total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at Baylor for the 2020-21 academic year is $85,679. The Law School Transparency estimated debt-financed cost of attendance for three years is $310,638.

He is remembered as the founder of the Romanian Surrealist group. The artist Lygia Naum, his wife, was the inspiration and main character in his 1985 novel Zenobia. Biography Born in Bucharest, he was the son of the poet (who had been drafted in World War I and died during the Battle of MƒÉrƒÉ≈üe≈üti) and his wife Maria Naum n√©e Rosa Gluck. In 1933, he began studying philosophy at the University of Bucharest. In 1938, he left for France, where he continued his studies at the University of Paris. He took his PhD diploma with a thesis on the scholastic philosopher Pierre Abelard. In 1936 (the year when he published his first book), Naum met Victor Brauner, who became his close friend and who later introduced him to Andr√© Breton and his Surrealist circle in Paris. In 1941, he helped create the Bucharest group of Surrealists (which also included Gherasim Luca, Paul PƒÉun, Dolfi Trost, and ). Naum was drafted into Romanian Army during World War II and served on the Eastern Front after the invasion of the Soviet Union (see Romania during World War II). Marked by his wartime experience, he was discharged in 1944, after he had fallen ill. In December 1947, the Surrealist group succumbed to the vicissitudes of postwar Soviet occupation and successful Communist takeover of Romania's government. As Socialist realism had officially become Romania's cultural policy, he could only publish books for children (out of which the two books with Apolodor were reissued several times). Although he published several books in the line of Socialist realism, which he reneged on afterwards, he never stopped writing Surrealist poems, such as the 1958 poem composed of several parts Heraclitus (published in the 1968 volume Athanor) or the esoteric manuscript The Way of the Snake, written in 1948‚Äì1949 and published after his death, in 2002. Between 1950 and 1953, he taught philosophy at the Agronomic Institute in Bucharest while working also as a translator. He translated works by Samuel Beckett, Ren√© Char, Denis Diderot, Alexandre Dumas, p√®re, Julien Gracq, Victor Hugo, Franz Kafka, G√©rard de Nerval, Jacques Pr√©vert, Stendhal, and Jules Verne. He resumed his literary career in 1968, in the wake of a relative cultural liberalization under Nicolae Ceau≈üescu's regime. After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, he traveled abroad and gave public readings in France, Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. In 1995, the German Academic Exchange Service appointed him scholar at the University of Berlin. Naum spent much of his final years at his retreat in Comana.

A balikbayan box (literally \\"repatriate box\\") is a corrugated box containing items sent by overseas Filipinos (known as \\"balikbayans\\"). Though often shipped by freight forwarders specializing in balikbayan boxes by sea, such boxes can be brought by Filipinos returning to the Philippines by air. History The balikbayan box arose around the 1980s in the United States, brought about by the influx of overseas Filipino workers in the country. The first freight forwarder to offer balikbayan box services was Rico Nunga, who started REN International in Los Angeles, California, in 1981. The following year, Ramon Ungco, a Filipino residing in New York City, founded Port Jersey Shipping International. These two companies are considered the pioneers of door-to-door delivery of balikbayan boxes, which back then were charged import duties upon arrival in the Philippines. On 30 June 1987, then Philippine President Corazon Aquino enacted Executive Order No. 206. This order amended Section 105 (f), and added a new subsection (f-1) to Republic Act No. 1937, also known as the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines, which was signed into law on 22 July 1957 by former president Carlos P. Garcia. The amended Section 105 of the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines provides duty- and tax-free privileges to balikbayan boxes sent to the Philippines by overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) as recognition of the magnitude of their contribution and sacrifices in foreign lands, as well as bringing considerable amounts of foreign exchange annually, that contributed to the national recovery effort at that time. This allowed tax-free entry of personal goods into the country from Filipinos overseas. People then began sending balikbayan boxes through friends and co-workers returning to the Philippines. After the September 11 attacks in the US, and the passage of the Patriot Act by the US Congress, balikbayan boxes have been subjected to rigorous inspections by the United States Department of Homeland Security's Out-Bound Exam Team that caused massive delays of up to three weeks at the US Customs inspection facility. This extended shipping time from 21 days to 30 plus days. The inspections also resulted in opened balikbayan boxes and complaints of package pilferage and mishandling. The Bureau of Customs also conducts 100% inspections that added to the burden of delayed shipments. The inspections are the result of some unscrupulous individuals who use balikbayan boxes to smuggle commercial items without paying taxes, or to smuggle contraband. Since balikbayan box shipping is a consolidated shipment, even one illegal item will affect all 400 or so packages inside the container. The inspection process has been modernized with the installation of high performance X-ray machines. In 2012, these delays were further aggravated by the decision of the City of Manila to impose a truck ban along the route to and from the Port of Manila, causing backlogs in releasing and transporting not only balikbayan boxes, but all cargoes, domestic and international. Most balikbayan box companies, which are based in Para√±aque City near the airport, were heavily affected by the truck ban until it was resolved. The industry was scrutinized by the Philippine Senate in 2015, after mounting complaints were brought to the attention of the public through social media after the Philippine Customs Commissioner, Albert Lina, announced the opening of balikbayan boxes for inspection and additional taxes to be imposed. The inquiry brought the passage of the Customs Modernization Act, which had been pending for years, and the inclusion of the Balikbayan Box Law in the act, increasing the tax-exemption ceiling from PHP 500 to PHP 150,000. This included items being brought home by Filipino tourists from trips abroad, pasalubong or gifts, and returning resident shipments. To protect consumers, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), through its Philippine Shipper's Bureau, conducts regular accreditation of international freight forwarders and discourages consumers from patronizing unaccredited and incredibly cheap shipping companies. According to the Door to Door Consolidated Association of the Philippines, there are 400,000 balikbayan boxes that arrive in the Philippines every month. Description Balikbayan boxes may contain items the sender thinks the recipient would like, regardless of whether those items can be bought cheaply in the Philippines, such as non- perishable food, toiletries, household items, electronics, toys, designer clothing, or items difficult to find in the Philippines. A balikbayan box intended for air travel is designed to conform to airline luggage restrictions and many Filipino stores sell them. Some boxes come with a cloth cover and side handles. Others are tightly secured with tape or rope, and thus not confused with an ordinary moving box that is lightly wrapped. The balikbayan boxes come in three standard sizes: * Medium: 18 x 16 x 18 inches * Large: 18 x 18 x 24 inches * Extra large: 24 x 18 x 24 inches Shipped boxes are delivered directly to the recipient, usually the family of the overseas Filipino. Cultural significance Part of the attraction of the balikbayan box is its economic value, as it allows cheaper bulk shipment of items versus sending each individually or in smaller boxes through postal services. The tradeoff though is longer transit time by container ship, which typically requires several weeks, along with the lack of a firm delivery date. The balikbayan box is a modern manifestation of the general Philippine practice of pasalubong, where travellers within or outside the country are culturally expected to bring home gifts to family, friends and colleagues. the balikbayan box provides connections between family within the Philippines and those who are abroad, and provide goods for the family within the Philippines.

He is best known for his connection with Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson (1721-1764), future marquise de Pompadour. Her legal guardian from 1725, after her official father was forced to leave the country, he may have been her natural father. He raised her and educated her with care, and he married her in 1741 to his nephew, Charles-Guillaume Le Normant d'√âtiolles, from whom she was separated in 1745 at the request of Louis XV. Thanks to the influence of Madame de Pompadour, Le Normant de Tournehem was made directeur g√©n√©ral of the B√¢timents du Roi in December 1745, succeeding Philibert Orry. He held this post, overseeing royal building works, until his death. \\"Without artistic prejudices,\\" Fiske Kimball observed,Creation of the Rococo 1943, p. 186. \\"he was a man of ability, honesty and simplicity, who devoted himself to efficient administration.\\" Le Normant de Tournehem reinstated the post of premier peintre du Roi which had been allowed to lapse, in favour of Charles-Antoine Coypel, upon whose artistic advice he wisely depended. Coypel's own advisors were the comte de Caylus, the brilliant and tireless antiquary and founder of archaeology, who had been an advisor to Orry and was a close friend of the connoisseur Pierre-Jean Mariette, and Abb√© Leblanc, an early critic of the excesses of the Rococo and an advocate of a chastened simplicity in the arts of design.Kimball 1943.

History WORD signed on September 1, 1940 at 910 AM as Spartanburg's second radio station. under the ownership of Spartanburg Advertising Company which also owned WSPA, a station that was established a decade previous. WORD utilized studio and tower space from WSPA. In 1944 the FCC ordered the WSPA-WORD combo to be broken up due to ownership regulations which prohibited an owner from having more than one AM station per market. This was completed on March 17, 1947, when WORD was sold to Spartan Radiocasting. Sister FM station WDXY 100.5 signed on the air April 14, 1948, but would sign off the air by the end of the 1950s. 950 WORD's transmitter In 1952, a dispute erupted between both Spartan Radiocasting and Liberty Life over a proposed allocation for VHF TV channel 7 in Spartanburg. It was settled in 1958 when Spartan Radiocasting bought back WSPA-AM and FM from Liberty Life Insurance and spinning off WORD and WDXY to different ownership. WORD was well known as Spartanburg's Top 40 powerhouse in the 1960s and 1970s under the name \\"Big Word\\". Some of the South's heavy weights worked there during the 1970s that included: Russ Spooner, Bob Canada, Kemosabi Joe Johnson, Fred Hardy and Robert W. Morgan (not the same Morgan that worked at KHJ) though. The Inimitable MojoMan (aka Sid D. Grubbs)also worked there in the 1970s. By the 1980s, WORD faced declining audience shares from FM competitors WANS and WFBC- FM and switched to various formats before going dark in 1989. In October 1990, WORD signed back on as a simulcast of 1330 WFBC from Greenville as both stations switched to News/Talk with WFBC becoming WYRD in the mid-90s. In 2002, Entercom Communications moved the \\"News Radio WORD\\" format from the weaker 910 AM, which previously held the WORD callsign, to 950 AM. The programming at 950 AM was then moved to 910 AM, along with the WSPA calls. WSPA at 910 has since been sold and is now all Oldies as WOLI (AM) 910. 950 WORD's transmitter is located near the Spartanburg Community College campus (3 miles NW of downtown Spartanburg) at 245 Broadcast Drive (Business I-85 @ exit 3). Its general coverage area is from Gaffney to Greer (Spartanburg Metro), with secondary coverage in the Greenville area. Although WORD transmits with 5,000 watts of power like its counterpart, WYRD, its signal is somewhat stronger due to its lower dial position.

An Enlightenment-educated polymath and polyglot, he was one of the most influential people of his generation. Asachi was a respected journalist and political figure, as well as active in technical fields such as civil engineering and pedagogy, and, for long, the civil servant charged with overseeing all Moldavian schools. Among his leading achievements were the issuing of Albina Rom√¢neascƒÉ, a highly influential magazine, and the creation of Academia MihƒÉileanƒÉ, which replaced Greek- language education with teaching in Romanian. His literary works combined a taste for Classicism with Romantic tenets, while his version of the literary language relied on archaisms and borrowings from the Moldavian dialect. A controversial political figure, Asachi endorsed the Imperial Russian presence in Moldavia and played a major part in establishing the Regulamentul Organic regime, while supporting the rule of Prince Mihail Sturdza. He thus came to clash with representatives of the liberal current, and opposed both the Moldavian revolution of 1848 and the country's union with Wallachia. Engaged in a long polemic with the liberal leader Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu, he was, together with Nicolae Vogoride, involved in the unsuccessful attempt to block the unionist project through the means of an electoral fraud. Asachi was noted for his deep connections with the Western culture, which led him to support the employment of foreign experts in various fields and educational institutions. He cultivated a relationship with the French historian Edgar Quinet, whose father-in-law he became in 1852. Biography=Early life Asachi was born in Hertsa, a small town which is now part of Ukraine. His family originated in Austrian-ruled Transylvania, where it was known under the name Asachievici.Djuvara, p. 352 His father, LazƒÉr, was an Orthodox priest who kept close contacts with Metropolitan Veniamin Costachi; according to several sources, he was of Armenian descent. \\"Armenii √Æn istorie ≈üi culturƒÉ\\", in Observator Cultural, retrieved 3 June 2007 His mother Elena (n√©e Niculau or Ardeleanu) was herself the daughter of a Transylvanian priest. The couple had another son, named Petru. LazƒÉr Asachi was his son's first educator, after which the young Gheorghe most likely enrolled in the Church-run primary school in Her≈£a.CƒÉrƒÉbu≈ü, p. 185 In summer 1795, after deciding not to send Gheorghe and Petru to Moldavian Greek-language school in the capital city of Ia≈üi, LazƒÉr Asachi opted to give them a more modern education in Austrian lands, sending them to Lemberg, where they attended gymnasium. After completing seven terms of education in Latin, Polish and German, Gheorghe Asachi entered university (the present-day Lviv University) at the age of 14. He studied at the Faculty of Letters, Philosophy and Sciences (attending lectures in logic, metaphysics, ethics, mathematics, physics, natural history, and architecture), but, in 1804, after two years of studies, he withdrew and returned to Moldavia. Despite this, his level of familiarity with Western culture was arguably unparalleled in his native country during the first half of the 19th century. Over the following decades, he designed several lodgings in both his native country and Galicia.Oprescu, p. 29 His return followed the death of his mother and LazƒÉr Asachi's appointment as First Protopope of the Moldavian Metropolitan Seat, and saw the family settling in Ia≈üi. In Napoleonic Europe Mount Vesuvius seen from Castellammare di Stabia, 1821 painting by Johan Christian Dahl In early 1805, Asachi fell ill with malaria, and was helped by Metropolitan Veniamin to leave for Vienna, where doctors had advised him to seek treatment. As the recipient of a stately scholarship, Asachi studied mathematics and astronomy with Tobie B√ºrg, as well as pursuing training in the art of painting. His time in the city coincided with French Empire's successes in the Napoleonic Wars, and, most important, with the 1805 War of the Third Coalition, during which La Grande Arm√©e occupied Vienna; this allowed Asachi to familiarize himself with French Revolutionary and liberal tenets, which he partly adopted in his political activities. In 1808, as the Russo-Turkish War erupted, Moldavia was occupied by the Russian Empire, First Protopope LazƒÉr contacted Pavel Chichagov to have his son appointed lieutenant and local head of the Corps of Engineers, but Gheorghe Asachi refused to assume office or even return from Vienna. Instead, he left for the Italian Peninsula in April 1808, aiming to complete his studies in Rome, but making long stops in other localities on the way (he notably visited Trieste, Venice, Padova, Ferrara, Bologna and Florence). Reaching the capital of the Papal States on 11 June, Asachi left on 19 August to visit Naples, Pompeii, and other locations in the Kingdom of Sicily. Upon reaching Mount Vesuvius, he descended unaccompanied into the volcanic crater, and was encouraged by a cheering audience. He soon after returned to Rome, where he focused on studying Renaissance Latin and Italian literature, as well as taking classes in archeology, painting and sculpture, and entering his most prolific phase in visual arts. In 1809, while visiting an art shop near the Spanish Steps, he met Bianca Milesi, the 19-year-old daughter of a wealthy merchant from Milan, with whom he fell in love. Despite her 1825 marriage to a French doctor, he was to remain her passionate admirer until her death from cholera in 1849. He later stressed that she had been a major source of inspiration for him, especially in allowing him the transition \\"from painter to poet\\", while the literary critic Eugen Lovinescu believed she inspired Asachi's Romantic nationalism. At the time, he authored his first poems on Romanian nationalist subjects, which earned him an award presented by the Roman Literary Society. One of these was Viitorul (\\"The Future\\"), which voiced a call for national regeneration. Interested in the origin of the Romanians and the history of Roman Dacia, Asachi studied events depicted on Trajan's Column and searched the Vatican Library for documents regarding the history of Romania. It was during the latter research that he came across Dimitrie Cantemir's History of the Growth and Decay of the Ottoman Empire in its English-language edition.CƒÉrƒÉbu≈ü, pp. 186‚Äì187 Through Bianca Milesi, Asachi met Fran√ßois Miollis, the French commander in Rome, who reportedly told him that Napoleon Bonaparte intended to emancipate Moldavia and Wallachia as a result of the expedition into Russia, and thus create a new \\"Dacian Kingdom\\" in the area of present-day Romania. Partly as a result of this encouragement, Asachi decided to travel back home on 22 June 1812, and, sailing down to Gala≈£i, arrived in Ia≈üi on 30 August. His designs regarding French protection over the Danubian Principalities were ended by Napoleon's retreat from Russia, and by the restoration of Ottoman suzerainty and Phanariote rules, when Sultan Mahmud II appointed Scarlat Callimachi as Prince. Early lectures and mission to Vienna Portrait of a young Asachi, by Giovanni Schiavoni In reaction to these developments, Gheorghe Asachi centered his attention on cultural improvements, Westernization, and Enlightenment teachings, with support from Metropolitan Veniamin. In 1813, his expertise and familiarity with European languages led Prince Callimachi to appoint him Reviewer (Referandar) for the Department of Foreign Affairs.CƒÉrƒÉbu≈ü, pp. 187‚Äì188 In 1814, increasingly opposed to the Greek-language teaching favored by the Phanariotes, Asachi proposed the first in a series of Romanian-language educational institutions, a course in engineering and topography to be held at the Princely Academy in Ia≈üi;Djuvara, p. 215 once approved by the ruler and countersigned by Veniamin, the lectures attracted a number of young boyars (including the future Ottoman diplomat Alexandros Kallimachis, Scarlat's son, Teodor Bal≈ü (who was to serve as Moldavia's kaymakam in 1856‚Äì1857), Daniel Scavinschi, as well as Gheorghe Asachi's brother Petru.CƒÉrƒÉbu≈ü, p. 188 He gave various lectures, and offered additional training in drawing and art history, as well as in Romanian history. He organized several exhibits of his students' work in technical drawing. Despite a favorable report from its inspectors, Asachi's facility soon met with opposition from Greek teachers at the Academy, which led it to be closed soon after its original students graduated (1819).CƒÉrƒÉbu≈ü, pp. 188‚Äì189 Nevertheless, Asachi was not stripped of his professorship, and was allowed to maintain both his position as head of the Princely Library and his house on Academy grounds. Later in the same year, he was involved in reorganizing the Orthodox seminary at Ia≈üi's Socola Monastery, and traveled to Transylvania in order to enlist the help of scholars active there. His friendly relations with various leaders of the Transylvanian School helped in achieving this goal; in 1820, he returned to Moldavia accompanied by Vasile Fabian Bob, Ioan Costa, Ion Manfi and Vasile Pop, all of whom became teachers at the Academy. Early in 1821, Gheorghe Asachi's activities were interrupted when the Greek Filiki Eteria forces crossed the Prut River and took over Moldavia on their way to Wallachia, during what constituted the earliest stage of the Greek War of Independence. Like his father (who died in 1825), Metropolitan Veniamin, and many other notable Moldavians, Asachi fled into Russian territory. He returned the following year, as the Ottoman Empire retook the region and put an end to Phanariote rules (a measure which attracted Asachi's enthusiasm); the new prince, Ioan Sturdza, appointed him Moldavian representative to the Austrian Empire, an office which he held between 30 November 1822 and February 1827.CƒÉrƒÉbu≈ü, pp. 189, 192‚Äì193 With this, he was awarded the traditional rank of Great Comis, and thus joined the ranks of nobility. As a diplomat, Asachi was foremost noted for his contacts with nationalist intellectuals who represented various ethnicities subject to the Austrian Empire.CƒÉrƒÉbu≈ü, p. 193 While in Vienna, he met the Austrian woman Elena Tauber, former governess of the Sturdza children and widow of the merchant Kiriako Melirato; she was his concubine until 1827, when they were married in an Orthodox church in Ia≈üi. Tauber had three children from her marriage to Melirato ‚Äî a girl, Hermiona, and two boys, Alexandru and Dimitrie (later, a mathematician); all of them were adopted by Asachi. ≈ûcoala VasilianƒÉ and Albina Rom√¢neascƒÉ Albina Rom√¢neascƒÉ issue no. 9, cover dated 1 February 1840 Soon after returning, Asachi was appointed caretaker of all Moldavian schools and Vel Agha. In March 1828, he succeeded in opening a multilingual upper school and gymnasium, connected to the Trei Ierarhi Church, named ≈ûcoala VasilianƒÉ or Gimnaziul Vasilian (in honor of the 17th-century prince Vasile Lupu, who had created the original education institution on that site). It was the first modern institution of its kind in Moldavia, and was soon supplemented by a college. ≈ûcoala VasilianƒÉ also continued the engineering course, taught by Gheorghe Filipescu, and had additional chairs in mathematics, architecture, applied mechanics and hydraulics; in 1834, it sent several of its alumni, including the architect Alexandru Costinescu, for further studies abroad. On 19 July 1827, a great fire in Ia≈üi's western quarter destroyed Asachi's lodging, as well as the vast majority of his possessions and manuscripts. Upon the end of the Russo-Turkish War of 1828‚Äì1829, Moldavia and Wallachia again came under Russian administration. During that interval, Asachi decided to expand his educational goals and popularize new ideas through the means of press institutions, and requested approval from the Russian consul in Ia≈üi, Matvey Minciaky, to have these set up.CƒÉrƒÉbu≈ü, p. 190 In April 1829, Russia endorsed his project for a magazine titled Albina Rom√¢neascƒÉ, which first saw print in July of the same year.CƒÉlinescu, p. 62 The first periodical to be published in Moldavia, it ran its own printing press, known as Institutul Albinei and originally housed in the Trei Ierarhi area. Alongside its stated goal (which involved generating a literary language), Albina Rom√¢neascƒÉ hosted pieces on current events, scientific essays, as well as articles offering practical advice.CƒÉrƒÉbu≈ü, pp. 189‚Äì190 Over the following decades, it oversaw the publishing of several other magazines, which were originally designed as supplements;CƒÉrƒÉbu≈ü, p. 191 among these, AlƒÉuta Rom√¢neascƒÉ (1837‚Äì1838) and Foaea SƒÉteascƒÉ a Prin≈£ipatului Moldovei (1839) were initiated by the younger activist Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu, who, through his influential publication Dacia LiterarƒÉ, become a vocal critic of Asachi's political and cultural views.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 62, 77 First and foremost, KogƒÉlniceanu expressed his dissatisfaction over the fact that Albina Rom√¢neascƒÉ relied on publishing translations from foreign authors, instead of encouraging national specificity. In addition, Asachi also issued a large panel of related works, including a series of almanacs which ran between 1847 and 1870.CƒÉrƒÉbu≈ü, pp. 191‚Äì192 Another magazine created by Asachi, the short- lived Spicuitorul Moldo-Rom√¢n (1841‚Äì1842), was published in both Romanian and French, having a Frenchman named Gallice, who worked as a teacher, for its co- editor. Regulamentul Organic adoption In late 1829, through a framework first outlined in the Akkerman Convention, Russian governor Peter Zheltukhin established a boards of experts from both countries, charged with drafting the constitutional project eventually known as Regulamentul Organic. The project was delayed by the ongoing war and epidemics of cholera and bubonic plague until 1831‚Äì1832, as Pavel Kiselyov took over for Zheltukhin; Gheorghe Asachi served as secretary of the Moldavian board ‚Äî the body also comprised Mihail Sturdza, Iordache Catagiu, Constantin Cantacuzino-Pa≈ücanu and Costache Conachi. The membership outlined for the Moldavian board scandalized the lesser boyars, who pointed out that the Akkerman treaties called for the new legislation to be adopted through a vote in a representative Boyar Divan, and who attempted to have Asachi and Conachi recalled.CƒÉrƒÉbu≈ü, pp. 193‚Äì194 Despite the protests, the board continued its activities, being overseen by the former consul Minciaky; together with Mihail Sturdza and the Wallachian Alexandru Vilara, Asachi was dispatched to Saint Petersburg to obtain the approval of Emperor Nicholas I, which led to the document being enforced in both Principalities. In its final version, the Regulament endorsed his efforts as educator, regulating public education and transferring assets donated by Vasile Lupu to ≈ûcoala VasilianƒÉ.CƒÉrƒÉbu≈ü, pp. 189‚Äì190, 193‚Äì194 The trade regulations offered by the Regulament were welcomed with enthusiasm by Asachi, prompting him to write an ode in their honor, titled Annul nou al moldo- rom√¢nilor 1830, √Æn care s-a lucrat Regulamentul organic, acel √Ænt√¢i cod administrativ al Moldovei (\\"The New Year of the Moldo-Romanians 1830, in Which Regulamentul Organic, the First Administrative Code of Moldavia, Was Completed\\"). In sharp contrast to his later advocacies, Asachi attempted to introduce provisions for the two Principalities' union, and some of his interventions in the text were meant to facilitate this project.CƒÉrƒÉbu≈ü, pp. 196, 199 At the time, he took a compassionate view in respect to peasants, denouncing the exploitation of their labor by the boyars.CƒÉrƒÉbu≈ü, p. 198 Under Mihail Sturdza Gheorghe Asachi was heavily impressed by the institutions he saw functioning in the Russian capital, and did his best to replicate them in Moldavia. After his return from Russia, Asachi became head of the Moldavian National Archives, in which capacity he published the first collection of documents referring to the country's history. From early 1834 onwards, he was a main collaborator of the newly appointed prince and former colleague on the Moldavian board, Mihail Sturdza, receiving funds and benefiting from on order to prioritize education in \\"Moldavian\\" (Romanian).CƒÉrƒÉbu≈ü, pp. 190, 194 In July of the same year, Asachi visited the Wallachian capital of Bucharest, being charged by Minciaky with strengthening the common framework of the Regulament by ensuring that its two versions did not differ in content.CƒÉrƒÉbu≈ü, p. 194 By May 1833, he was able to move into a new house, which he designed and erected in the Muntenimea area of Copou Hill, on a large plot of land he had purchased from Lupu Bal≈ü; at around the same time, Institutul Albinei was also reopened on the new location. An 1852 survey showed that Asachi had a second, smaller, house in downtown Ia≈üi. In late 1834, on Asachi's request, Sturdza gave approval for the first Moldavian girls' school to be opened in the capital. On 6 June 1835, following Asachi's interventions, Academia MihƒÉileanƒÉ, the first Romanian-language institution of higher education, was established in the city. A fundamental institution of higher learning, and the nucleus for the present-day University of Ia≈üi, it also hosted lectures by cultural figures from Moldavia, Transylvania and Wallachia alike, including some of Asachi's young rivals; among the teachers were Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu, Ion Ionescu de la Brad, Eftimie Murgu, Ion Ghica, and August Treboniu Laurian. In addition, Asachi presented a plan to create a school of agronomy, to function alongside the city's military academy, and, by 1848, created a school for further qualification in engineering. On 15 November 1836, he founded, alongside Vornic ≈ûtefan Catargiu and SpƒÉtar Alecsandri (the father of poet Vasile Alecsandri), a conservatory, and, after 1837, was appointed head of the Moldavian Theater, among the first of its kind to showcase original pieces in Romanian.CƒÉrƒÉbu≈ü, p. 190, 192 At the head of a committee, he took charge of translating a German-language dictionary into Romanian, stressing that this was a response to the Moldavians' need for knowledge. During the early 1840s, he became interested in organizing education for the non-emancipated Armenian and Jewish communities ‚Äî in 1842, it was as a result of his efforts that an Armenian primary school was set up. In 1847, Asachi's printing press issued an Armenian-language primer. He was also the person behind the creation of the Ia≈üi School of Arts and Crafts (January 1841), as well as helping establish the first public library, the paper mill near Piatra Neam≈£, an Art Gallery and a National History Museum. In the meantime, Academia MihƒÉileanƒÉ was disestablished and transformed into a French-language school (overseen by a teacher named Malgouvern√©).Oprescu, p. 33 Over the same decade, Asachi moved towards Conservatism, defending Regulamentul Organic in front of the increasingly popular liberal current.CƒÉrƒÉbu≈ü, pp. 194, 198 He clashed with young activists who rejected Sturdza's rule, and, as early as 1839, noted with dissatisfaction that \\"a new people was born [...], with new wishes and ideas\\". His conflict with KogƒÉlniceanu was transported to the field of politics, and Asachi joined in condemning the anti-Regulament failed rebellion of 1848.CƒÉrƒÉbu≈ü, pp. 194‚Äì195 As most other press venues submitted to the minimal requirement of Russian officials and avoided publishing any material related to the revolution, Albina Rom√¢neascƒÉ criticized the revolutionaries for having discarded \\"their duty to the powers that be\\", and praised Russia for sending its troops to combat \\"anarchy\\". Despite this, KogƒÉlniceanu later claimed that, on one occasion, he had seen Asachi sobbing over having been made to criticize the Romanian activists. The debate prolonged itself over the following years, and, coupled with Asachi's unwaivering support for Sturdza, saw him joining the separatist camp at a time the post-revolutionary group Partida Na≈£ionalƒÉ began openly campaigning for Moldo-Wallachian unification. While supporting the interests of the middle class, Asachi stressed that these could compliment a feudal system, and rejected the revolutionary call for abolishing privilege. Also in 1848, Asachi lost his daughter, the 19-year-old Eufrosina, to the cholera outbreak. He published two poems written in her memory. 1850s In January 1850, almost one year after the Convention of Balta Liman awarded the Moldavian throne to the reform-minded and revolutionary sympathizer Grigore Alexandru Ghica, Albina Rom√¢neascƒÉ changed its name to Gazeta de Moldavia, adopting an official tone. Asachi, who resigned his positions as inspector and archivist in 1849, was awarded a substantial pension.CƒÉrƒÉbu≈ü, p. 195 Between 1851 and 1854, he was head of censorship, using this position to award imprimatur for reformist ideas (with Prince Ghica's tacit approval). At the time, he gave endorsement to the Chronicle of Huru, a document which was claimed to trace a direct lineage between Roman Dacia and Moldavia, and to clarify the more mysterious aspects of the country's early medieval history ‚Äî the document was used by separatists to emphasize Moldavia's tradition of independence, but was the subject to an inquiry and dismissed by KogƒÉlniceanu (it was later established that the text was a forgery). During the political battles which followed Ghica's retirement and the Crimean War, Gazeta de Moldavia transformed itself into an official platform for the anti-unionist camp. After the retreat of Russian troops and an interval of Austrian administration, Moldavia and Wallachia's government came under the direct supervision of various European powers, and Kaymakam Teodor Bal≈ü ensured the interregnum in Ia≈üi. In this context, Ottoman authorities, through the voice of Fuat Pasha, gave their approval for relative freedom of the press to be legislated. With Costache Negruzzi, Asachi again became an official censor, while again assuming the offices of archivist and inspector of Moldavian schools. As the Treaty of Paris imposed the creation of ad hoc Divans, through which the two countries' inhabitants were allowed to decide their future, the unionist camp saw a chance for fulfilling its goals; Asachi and his associates reacted vehemently, and, in May 1857, complained to the Porte that unification would bring about various perils. One month later, the government of Kaymakam Nicolae Vogoride carried out an electoral fraud to yield a separatist majority in the ad hoc Divan ‚Äî Asachi, who supported Sturdza's bid for the throne, is thought to have played a major part in bringing this about, and, together with Vogoride himself, Nicolae Istrati, and the Austrian consul Oskar von G√∂del- Lannoy, to have drawn up falsified the electoral lists.CƒÉrƒÉbu≈ü, p. 196 He was himself a candidate in the Ia≈üi electoral college, receiving 197 votes and placing himself second among the representatives it sent to the Divan.CƒÉrƒÉbu≈ü, p. 197 His magazine stood alone in claiming that the regime had acted impartially. The suffrage was hotly contested and annulled through an agreement between the Second French Empire and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland; Asachi himself was thus forced to note that the new elections in August managed to overturn the previous results.CƒÉrƒÉbu≈ü, pp. 191, 197 He was no longer elected a deputy, and his candidature for the position of secretary of the electoral board was awarded just one vote. In 1858, Gazeta de Moldavia was entirely dedicated to political subjects and support for Vogoride's policies, and ceased print in October, as the Kaymakam ended his mandate. In late November, it reemerged under the title Patria, which continued to criticize Partida Na≈£ionalƒÉ from a conservative position, notably hosting articles by the anti-unionist Istrati. As a new regency of three was preparing elections, the magazine rallied with ≈ûtefan Catargiu, Asachi's lifelong collaborator and the separatist representative in the body of kaymakams, against the two unionists (Vasile Sturdza and Anastasie Panu), before Catargiu was replaced with I. A. Cantacuzino. In November 1837, Asachi and another 36 separatist boyars issued a memorandum unsuccessfully asking the Ottoman Grand Vizier Aali Pasha to intervene against the unionist kaymakams, restore censorship, and to narrow down the electoral lists. Final years Asachi in old age (portrait originally printed in the first edition of his collected short stories) The situation changed in January 1859, when Partida Na≈£ionalƒÉ was able to ensure the election of Alexandru Ioan Cuza as both Prince of Moldavia and Prince of Wallachia, in what was the de facto union of the two countries. After congratulating Cuza on his accomplishment, Asachi authored a pome titled OdƒÉ la Dumnezeu (\\"An Ode to God\\"), which proclaimed the brotherhood of Romanians and the notion that \\"power resides in Unity\\". Patria drastically reduced its articles in support of separation, while allocating most of its space to reprinting official papers. Nevertheless, as Domnitor Cuza was deposed and the election of a foreign ruler over the Romanian Principality was being assessed, it is probable that Gheorghe Asachi again switched to a separatist stance: on 14 April 1866, after an incident during which Ia≈üi crowds protested the prolongation of unification beyond Cuza's reign, he was the subject of an inquiry on charges of sedition. This remains a mysterious aspect of his political career, and it is certain that Asachi eventually rallied with Carol later in the year. It is likely, however, that his inconsistent views prompted other intellectuals to reject his participation in founding the Romanian Academy. The various projects also involved Asachi's own financial reserves, which led him to become indebted and mortgage his assets on several occasions: in 1862, after Asachi was declared insolvent, the Copou house was put up for auction, but the writer was able to come up with the money before the sale was perfected. He continued to depend on debts in order to feed his family, and unsuccessfully offered Institutul Albinei to be purchased by the state. In February 1869, the Dimitrie Ghica government awarded Asachi a yearly pension of 8,888 lei, \\"for the important services he has brought to the country from 1813 to 1862\\". He died several months later in Ia≈üi, and was buried at the Patruzeci de Sfin≈£i Church. His printing press ceased its activity in 1867. Literature=Style and subjects During his youth, Asachi was one of the most representative members of an idealist generation of Moldavian intellectuals. In the context of early Romanian literature, where Romanticism and delayed Classicism coexisted, Asachi, like Grigore Alexandrescu, George Baronzi and others, tended to side with the latter,CƒÉlinescu, pp. 53‚Äì56 at a time when his counterpart in Bucharest, Ion Heliade RƒÉdulescu, bridged the gap between the two schools.MƒÉciucƒÉ, p. XXI The literary critic Garabet IbrƒÉileanu concluded that Asachi's literature signified a transition between a Classicist stage exemplified by Costache Conachi and younger Romantics such as Vasile Alecsandri and Dimitrie Bolintineanu (he also concluded that the casual comparisons made between Heliade RƒÉdulescu and Asachi had failed to note that the former was not a conservative). Gheorghe Asachi recommended his students to study Italian literature, and would frown upon models inspired by French literature. His creation comprised poems, the first of which were written in Italian,CƒÉlinescu, p. 53 as well as vast array of short stories and novellas, through which Asachi attempted to create a legendary history partly mirroring Romanian mythology.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 54‚Äì55 The major influences on his work were Renaissance authors such as Petrarch, Ludovico Ariosto, and Torquato Tasso, but he also accommodated more modern influences, such as Salvator Rosa, Thomas Gray, Gottfried August B√ºrger, Vasily Zhukovsky, Lord Byron and Friedrich Schiller. Thus, Asachi created himself a fictional location, called Dochia ‚Äî a reference to both Dacia and the myth of Baba Dochia, which houses the CeahlƒÉu Massif under the name of Pion. Asachi was also the first person to mention Baba Dochia in connection to the Roman Emperor Trajan and the Dacian Wars ‚Äî the vague and unprecedented references make it likely that he actually invented the original story as well. Carmen Ple≈üa, \\"St√¢nca Dochia\\" , in Jurnalul Na≈£ional, 19 December 2005; retrieved 3 June 2007 References to this universe are also present in an eponymous novella about Drago≈ü, the first Prince of Moldavia, which partly drew on old chronicles, and partly displayed Asachi's own fictional devices. The story centers on Harboe, a chivalrous Tatar ruler who resides in the Cumanian town of Romidava, who falls in love with Branda, the daughter of a Moesian lord and would-be wife of Drago≈ü. Dochia's hidden altar, referred to as \\"a simulacrum\\", is guarded by a Vestal- like priestess and a deer hind. Asachi's other prose works on historical subjects take similar liberties with their subjects (they notably describe large Gothic monuments and tournaments in medieval Moldavia, as well as improbable details from the lives of 14th‚Äì16th century Princes Bogdan I, Stephen the Great, and Petru Rare≈ü).CƒÉlinescu, pp. 55‚Äì56 Asachi's works also include romanticized accounts of a journey made by the Cossack Hetman Ivan Mazepa into Moldavia (Mazepa √Æn Moldova) and the life of Ruxandra, daughter of Vasile Lupu and wife of Tymofiy Khmelnytsky (Rucsandra Doamna), as well as Jijia, where a captured fairy recounts her previous existence as a Christian martyr, and Sirena lacului, where a dishonored maiden, who has turned into a siren, takes revenge on boyar. In connection with Nicolae Vogoride's policies, Asachi drew on historical subject to counter the calls for unity voiced by Partida Na≈£ionalƒÉ; in addition to the endorsement he gave to the Chronicle of Huru, he emphasized, in an article of June 1857, the campaign led by Stephen the Great into Wallachia, calling for a landmark to be raised in honor of \\"the vanquisher of the Wallachians\\". This mirrored the earlier comments made by the Wallachian anti-unionist Dimitrie Papazoglu, who proposed a celebration and monument honoring the 1653 Battle of Finta (during which the Wallachian forces of Matei Basarab had defeated an army of Moldavians and Cossacks). Gheorghe Asachi's style has been criticized from the time of his debate with other intellectuals of his age, when Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu argued that his lyrical works were mere replicas of foreign models. Several influential literary historians of the 20th century expressed similar views: George CƒÉlinescu indicated that, in general, poems by Asachi sounded \\"banal\\"; in one of his essays, Paul Zarifopol commented that Asachi and his generation, from Iancu VƒÉcƒÉrescu to Vasile C√¢rlova, Alexandru Hrisoverghi, and Heliade RƒÉdulescu, were \\"semi-cultured\\" and \\"amateurs\\". Both CƒÉlinescu and Zarifopol stressed that, in his best work, Asachi announced the poetic language of Mihai Eminescu, the most influential author of the late 19th century.CƒÉlinescu, p. 54 Language Present at the forefront during debates regarding the shape of literary language, Asachi drew criticism for introducing archaisms and marginally used neologisms to the Romanian lexis, as well as for the forms of spelling he encouraged. Commenting on a series of words which are nowhere used outside his novellas and poems, George CƒÉlinescu called them \\"impossible [...], presently seeming bizarre, mostly Romantic, lacking in historical perception\\". In essence, Asachi called for the modern language to reflect as much as possible the one used by the folk ‚Äî in this respect, he came closer to KogƒÉlniceanu's views than to those of Heliade RƒÉdulescu (at a time when the latter favored using the dialects employed by the Romanian Orthodox and Greek- Catholic churches). One of the first to discover old Moldavian chronicles and recommend them for reading, he came to propose that the Moldavian dialect, as reflected in these, could be used as a template for the modern speech. Nevertheless, his views fluctuated, and he was noted for proposing himself that the Church language be used as a template, while contrasting the support he gave to Westernization in general with his distaste for popular French- sounding neologisms. In an article he published in 1847, Asachi defined himself as a partisan of \\"the juste milieu\\" on language matters, and recommended adopting words and rules of grammar with moderation, and from all sources available. According to the literary critic Garabet IbrƒÉileanu, \\"[...] anybody who has ever read anything of what this writer has authored knows that he has a language of his own, a characteristic one, resembling those of many writers, without resemblig that of anyone else to the point where we could place him in any category.\\" The same commentator nonetheless noted that there were clear similarities between the way in which Asachi used Romanian and the language favored by Costache Conachi. His enduring aversion towards Western neologisms, as well as towards the Latin-based linguistic purism favored by many Transylvanian scholars, made Asachi a predecessor of the Bukovinan academic Aron Pumnul. However, in his later years, Asachi came to praise and uphold Heliade RƒÉdulescu's controversial advocacy in favor of modifying Romanian on the basis of Italian (with its claim that the two languages were in fact closely related dialects of Latin). The Ia≈üi National Theatre Asachi's experimentations with the Romanian Latin alphabet were noted for their inconsistencies, and criticized as such by KogƒÉlniceanu (who, as an example, pointed out that Asachi had alternatively used \\"tch\\", \\"tz\\", \\"c\\", and \\"cz\\" to mark the voiceless postalveolar affricate). Asachi and the Romanian theater Considered, together with the Wallachian Heliade RƒÉdulescu, the founder of early Romanian theater,MƒÉciucƒÉ, p. XII Asachi produced the first staging of a Romanian-language play, first performed for the public on 27 December 1816, at the Ghica family manor.CƒÉrƒÉbu≈ü, p. 192 The work was his own adaptation of Myrtil et Chlo√©, a pastoral theme authored by Solomon Gessner and retaken by Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian; in its printed version, the text also featured illustrations drawn by his own hand.DrƒÉgu≈£ et al., p. 113 Extremely popular, Asachi's play was celebrated for helping to counter the perceived xenophily of the early 19th century Moldavian cultural environment.CƒÉrƒÉbu≈ü, p.192 Two Ghicas and a Sturdza were assigned parts in the first staging, and Veniamin Costachi was present in the audience.Djuvara, p. 311 In early 1837, his conservatory began functioning regularly, which coincided with Asachi's leadership of the National Theatre. Before and after this moment, the writer contributed translations from various prestigious dramatists and playwrights, August von Kotzebue, Voltaire, Jean Racine and Nikolai Gogol among them. In parallel, he published librettos for popular operas, thus lending a hand to the development of local operatic theater. Contribution to visual arts Templul Iubirii (\\"The Temple of Love\\"), drawing by Gheorghe Asachi As a teacher, Asachi assisted and encouraged the development of Romanian art. Before he came to exercise his influence, Moldavian art was essentially dependent on boyar patronage, and, by the turn of the 18th century, had come to focus on portrait painting.Oprescu, pp. 26‚Äì28 Asachi centered his energies on introducing Romantic nationalist themes and popularizing new trends.DrƒÉgu≈£ et al., p. 112 He integrated painting, architecture, and drawing and oil painting in classes taught at Academia MihƒÉileanƒÉ (called class de zugrƒÉvie, an antiquated version of \\"painting course\\"), and introduced lithography through the means of his printing press. In the 1830s and 1840s, he encouraged artists the copying and publishing of paintings and drawings with historical themes. Asachi emphasized the educational aspects of zugrƒÉvitura istoricƒÉ √Æn oloiu (\\"history painting in oil\\"), and intended its creations to reach as wide an audience as possible. In this respect as well, his contributions were equivalent to those of Heliade RƒÉdulescu, who opened the first museum in Wallachia (1837).Oprescu, pp. 30‚Äì31 The resulting works are generally na√Øve in quality, and inaccurate in their reconstruction of historical scenes.Oprescu, pp. 31, 43 Gheorghe Panaiteanu Bardasare, the recipient of a scholarship to the Akademie der Bildenden K√ºnste in Munich, was the only one of his many disciples to remain under the influence of Asachi's tenets for the rest of his life, developing these into academic art.DrƒÉgu≈£ et al., pp. 125‚Äì126 Asachi's disciples also included Gheorghe Lemeni, who studied in Munich and Rome, and the minor artist Gheorghe NƒÉstƒÉseanu.DrƒÉgu≈£ et al., p. 125Oprescu, pp. 47‚Äì48 Arguably, Asachi's most important contribution to the artistic field was his involvement in attracting foreign painters to the Moldavian scene, by offering them commissions or educational assignments; among these were the Polish Ludwik Stawski and Mauriciu Loeffler, the Italian Giovanni Schiavoni,DrƒÉgu≈£ et al., pp. 113‚Äì114Oprescu, pp. 29‚Äì30 as well as the Austrian Josef Adler (noted for authoring an 1833 manual for landscape painting and still life works) and Ioan M√ºller (who taught figurative art).Oprescu, pp. 29, 44‚Äì49 Of them, Asachi reportedly considered Schiavoni to be the most competent, while he tended to replace most others after reexamining their skills.Oprescu, p. 30 Another important Italian artist who arrived in Ia≈üi during that period was the former Carboneria revolutionary Niccol√≥ Livaditti, to whom Asachi did not, however, assign a teaching post.DrƒÉgu≈£ et al., p. 114 In 1843, four years before the Ia≈üi Academia was radically transformed, the art classes were disestablished due to the protest of various boyars (who objected to the fact that members of all social groups could attend them).Oprescu, pp. 32‚Äì33 Gheorghe Asachi's own works, many of which date back to the time he spent in Rome, show the influence of Classicism. Noted for their rigorous use of artistic conventions and nature study, they are nonetheless considered inferior to both their creator's contributions to other cultural fields and the works of other many painters active in Moldavia at the time. Asachi himself is known to have sketched out works which were completed by his foreign collaborators or students (among these is a since-lost painting of Stephen the Great facing his mother, signed by the Italian artist Giani, and an 1845 painting of Moldavians in the battle of Malbork Castle).Oprescu, pp. 43‚Äì44 A series of Classicist drawings from the early decades of the 19th century have only tentatively been attributed to Asachi. Descendants Elena, Gheorghe Asachi's widow, died in 1877. Of his adopted children, Dimitrie Asachi was to be the most famous: a pupil of his stepfather's, he was to author the first original book on mathematics in his country (1841). Alexandru Asachi, who joined the Romanian Army and became an officer, was himself known as an artist: a lithographer and author of historical works, he published several albums of hand-colored prints during the 1850s.Oprescu, pp. 88‚Äì89 In 1835, Hermiona Asachi (whose given name was often Francised as Hermione) fell in love with Alexandru, the underage son of former Prince Alexander Mourousis, who soon after moved into Asachi's house; this scandalized other members of the Mourousis family, and the conflict was ended only when the two youths agreed to marry. They had a son, George Moruzi, who died in 1856. In 1843, Hermiona translated and published Silvio Pellico's collection of maxims, Dei doveri degli uomini.Alin CiupalƒÉ, Femeia √Æn societatea rom√¢neascƒÉ a secolului al XIX-lea, Editura Meridiane, Bucharest, 2003, p.76-77 She got married a second time, in 1852, to the well- known French historian Edgar QuinetIorga, La R√©volution de 1848 et les √©migr√©s (between 1841 and 1845, she had attended Quinet's lectures at the Coll√®ge de France); five years later, Asachi translated and Quinet's collected works into Romanian ‚Äî according to historian Nicolae Iorga, the edition was toned-down and censored. The Quinets did not have any children. Landmarks and portrayals Rectorate of the Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Ia≈üi In autumn 1890, a statue of Asachi was erected in front of the Trei Ierarhi Church school complex, an initiative taken by a group of his conservative collaborators. On the same occasion, Asachi's remains, together with those of his wife Elena, were placed in the monument's base. The courtyard of Asachi's house on Copou Hill hosts a small monument, which he raised to the memory of his daughter Eufrosina and his grandson George. Asachi laid out the plan for a monument honoring Regulamentul Organic, completed by the Russian artist Sungurov with workforce hired from Galicia, and raised on Copou as the first structure of its kind in Moldavia.Oprescu, pp. 49‚Äì50 He is also noted for having proposed, in 1853, to create a modern cemetery in Ia≈üi on Galata Hill ‚Äî his project was never used, but in 1871, Eternitatea, a cemetery corresponding to his requirements, was set up on land donated to the city. Silvia Craus, \\"Pietrele vorbitoare\\", in Ie≈üeanul, 7 February 2007; retrieved 3 July 2007 The Copou house itself was taken over by Malvina Czapkai, a creditor of Asachi and his son Alexandru; it served as a boarding school, and, during the Russo- Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878, as a Russian military hospital. In 1892, Marie of Edinburgh, who had just married the Romanian heir apparent, Ferdinand Hohenzollern, purchased it for 52,000 lei. It was subsequently the Principesa Maria School for Arts and Crafts, destined to women's education, and, during World War I, served as a home for orphaned girls. In 1937, Queen Marie transformed into an institute for welfare, which notably hosted the practice of sociologist and psychologist Mihai Ralea. The house was again a hospital in World War II, when it was taken over by the Romanian Air Force; in 1948, when the Communist regime was established, it was nationalized (together with all other Royal property), and served as the headquarters of the Romanian Land Forces 4th Corps, and was later rented for private use. Since 1976, it has housed two institutes of the Romanian Academy (the Alexandru Philippide Institute of Philology and the Gheorghe Zane Institute of Economic and Social Research). Among the artists two have depicted Asachi during his lifetime were his associate Giovanni Schiavoni (whose painting shows the young writer surrounded by objects illustrating his many interests)Oprescu, p. 45 and Constantin Daniel Stahi (a pupil of Panaiteanu Berdasare).DrƒÉgu≈£ et al., p. 160 In December 1937, a section of the University of Ia≈üi was created into an institute of technology, with the name of Gheorghe Asachi Polytechnic School (the present-day Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Ia≈üi). A public library in the city also bears his name, as do a school erected in 1900 on the site previously occupied by ≈ûcoala VasilianƒÉ and high schools in the Romanian cities of Boto≈üani and Sibiu, as well as in the Moldovan capital Chi≈üinƒÉu.

Although its numerical designation was bestowed upon it during World War I, the 17th Battalion can trace its lineage back to 1860, when a unit of the New South Wales Volunteer Rifles was raised in St Leonards, New South Wales. This unit has since been disbanded and reformed a number times. Through its links with the units of the colonial New South Wales defence force, the battalion's history includes service in the Sudan and South Africa. During World War I, the 17th Battalion was raised for overseas service as part of the Australian Imperial Force. Attached to the 5th Brigade, 2nd Division, the battalion was raised in 1915 and sent to Egypt initially, before taking part in the fighting at Gallipoli against the Turks. Later the battalion was sent to the Western Front in France and Belgium, where it served in the trenches as part of the Australian Corps. Throughout the course of the war, the battalion won numerous battle honours and its members received many individual awards, however, at the end of the war the battalion was disbanded in April 1919. In 1921, the battalion was reformed as a militia unit known as the 17th Battalion (North Sydney Regiment), before being disbanded in 1944. The battalion was reformed in 1948 as an amalgamated unit known as the 17th/18th Battalion (The North Shore Regiment), before being reduced to a company-sized element in the 2nd Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment in 1960. In 1965, the battalion was reformed again as the 17th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment, before being amalgamated to form the 2nd/17th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment in 1987. History=Formation The battalion's origins began when the St Leonards Volunteer Rifles was raised in 1860 in the northern suburbs of Sydney as part of the military forces of the New South Wales colonial defence force. Members of this unit served overseas in 1885 in Sudan, and then again in South Africa during the Second Boer War. In 1903, following the Federation of Australia this unit became part of the Commonwealth Military Forces and was renamed the 1st Australian Infantry Regiment. In 1912, a system of compulsory military service was introduced and the unit was renamed the 18th Infantry, and then later, in 1914, the 17th Infantry. World War I When World War I began, due to the provisions of the Defence Act 1903 which precluded sending conscripts overseas to fight, it became necessary to raise an all volunteer force, separate to the militia, for service in the Middle East and Europe.Grey 2008, p. 85. This force was known as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). As a part of this, the 17th Battalion was raised in March 1915 in Liverpool, New South Wales, forming part of the 5th Brigade, which was assigned to the 2nd Division. In May 1915, the battalion left Australia and after spending some time in Egypt training, they landed at Anzac Cove on 20 August 1915. They took part in the August Offensive, during which time they were engaged in the attack on Hill 60. Following this they were mainly used in a defensive role, defending Quinn's Post, which was one of the most fought over positions at Gallipoli. The battalion was withdrawn from the peninsula in December 1915 along with the rest of the Allied forces after the decision was made to abandon the campaign. After this, a further period of training in Egypt was undertaken as the AIF was reorganised and expanded from two infantry divisions to five.Grey 2008, pp. 99‚Äì100. In March 1916, the 17th Battalion was sent to France as the AIF's infantry divisions were transferred to the Western Front. The battalion moved up to the front line in April and took over the forward position in the eastern Armenti√®res section. It was in June, during the prelude to the Battle of the Somme, when the battalion was positioned in the line around Armenti√®res, that Private William Jackson earned the battalion's only Victoria Cross of the war. Later, the 17th Battalion took part in the first major battle at Pozi√®res, serving in the line twice at this time between July and August. A period of respite followed after this, as the 17th was moved north to Belgium along with the rest of the 2nd Division, remaining there until October when they were transferred back to the Somme. For the remainder of the year they undertook defensive duties along the front, although they were not involved in any major attacks. Victoria Cross recipient, William Jackson In 1917, after enduring a harsh winter, the 17th Battalion was involved in most of the major battles as the German Army shortened their lines and withdrew back towards the Hindenburg Line, seeing action at Bullecourt in May, Menin Road in September and Poelcappelle in October. At Lagnicourt, on 15 April, the 17th took part in a defensive action along with four other battalions from the 5th Brigade, defeating a counter- attack by a numerically superior German force, and recapturing the village that had been lost along with a number of guns that the German force had taken off the Australians earlier. In early 1918, the battalion was involved in repelling the German Spring Offensive, undertaking defensive actions in the Somme Valley, before taking part in the final Allied offensive that eventually brought about an end to the war. During this time they were involved in the battles at Amiens and Mont St Quentin in August, before participating in the attack on the \\"Beaurevoir Line\\" at Montbrehain in October. This would be the battalion's last contribution to the war, as it was out of the line reorganising when the Armistice was declared in November 1918. It was disbanded in April 1919, whilst at Montigny-le-Tilluel, Belgium, when most of its personnel were transferred to the 20th Battalion. During World War I, the battalion suffered 3,280 casualties, of which 845 were killed. Members from the battalion also received the following decorations: one Victoria Cross, one Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, seven Distinguished Service Orders, 19 Distinguished Conduct Medals, 33 Military Crosses, 138 Military Medals, 10 Meritorious Service Medals and 41 Mentions in Despatches.The figures for the MC includes one Bar. The figures for the MM includes 11 Bars. The AWM figures include eight foreign awards. These are not specified and are therefore not included here. Interwar years, World War II and post war The demobilisation of the AIF was completed in early 1921 and in April that year it was officially disbanded. The Australian government then decided to reorganise the units of the Citizen Forces (later known as the \\"Militia\\") in order to perpetuate the divisional structure, numerical designations and battle honours of the AIF.Grey 2008, p. 125. As a result of this, the 17th Infantry, a militia unit that could trace its lineage back to 1860, was reformed as the 17th Battalion (The North Sydney Regiment), drawing personnel from the 17th Infantry Regiment. Through this link, the 17th Battalion inherited two theatre honours, \\"Suakin 1885\\" and \\"South Africa 1899‚Äì1902\\". During the inter-war years, the battalion was assigned to the 8th Brigade, which was headquartered in North Sydney and formed part of the 2nd Military District. During World War II, the battalion undertook garrison duties in Australia, as part of the 9th Brigade, based in New South Wales.McKenzie-Smith 2018, pp. 2070‚Äì2071. Around November 1942, the battalion's machine gun company was detached and in conjunction with several other Militia machine gun companies, it was used to form the 6th Machine Gun Battalion.Morgan 2019, p. 5. Although there were reductions amongst the home forces as the war progressed, the 17th Battalion remained on the Australian order of battle until 6 April 1944 when it was disbanded, having not seen active service during World War II, as the Australian Army sought to reallocate manpower back to industry or to other units that were engaged in combat operations in the Pacific. In 1948, the battalion was re-raised as part of the Citizens Military Force, and was amalgamated with the 18th Battalion to form the 17th/18th Battalion (The North Shore Regiment). Upon reforming, the battalion was entrusted with the World War II battle honours of the 2/17th Battalion, in which many members of North Sydney Regiment had enlisted.Grey 2001, p. 172.2/17 Battalion History Committee 1998, p. 319. The Australian Army was reorganised along Pentropic lines in 1960, and the battalion became 'B' Company, 2nd Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment (2 RNSWR). The battalion also formed the nucleus of 2 RNSWR's support company and regimental band.2/17 Battalion History Committee 1998, p. 328. When the Pentropic divisional structure was abandoned in 1965, the battalion was reformed in its own right as the 17th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment. This lasted until 1987 when another reorganisation of the Australian Army Reserve led to the unit's amalgamation to form the 2nd/17th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment.Shaw 2010, pp. 10‚Äì11.2/17 Battalion History Committee 1998, p. 333.

As the king was a minor, just an infant, the pradani took over the controls of a languishing kingdom and brought order and a sense of well-being by his careful planning and introduction of several tax and revenue reforms. Due to ideological differences that arose between the king and himself, he was forced to retire from his position in disgrace, was labelled as a traitor of India, and was forgotten. The Ramnad Manual amply records his administrative prowess and tax reforms. The Period The last few decades of the 18th century were a troubled period in the history of India, and in the history of the kingdom of Ramnad in particular. In this period, the Marava chieftains resisted the suzerainty of the Muslim Nawab of Arcot. The Nawab responded by giving the Ramnad Estate the status of a tributary landlord with a tribute of 175,000 rupees, thus quelling the unrest of the Maravas. As the incumbent Sethupathi of Ramnad was an infant, three Pradanis were appointed as regents. The three Pradanis thus appointed were Muthia Pillai, Vellu Pillai and Sankaran Pillai. The three Pradanis, having no oversight from the Sethupathi, acted in their personal interested and neglected the affairs of state. The next Pradani, Muthirulappa Pillai, took sole charge of the administration. Governance for The People It was at this difficult juncture that Pradani Muthirulappa Pillai took control of the kingdom. He was not a starry-eyed idealist. His mission was to make Ramnad strong and her people comfortable. He had to pay tribute to the Nawab. Shrewd statesman that he was, he realised that while he paid his tributes, he must also keep the British happy for the Nawab was no more than a puppet on their stings. The quote from the Gazetteer of India continues thus: \\"He realized that he should placate the British in order to bring effective internal reforms, since the British were having the leading strings of the Nawab in their hands.\\" More information about this minister can be found in the Ramnad Manual that can be accessed in the Tamil Nadu Government Archives. It has this to say: \\"This Pradani had the direction of everything. Unlike his predecessors, it was his firm belief that the best chance of improvement of the country was by internal reform and a hearty cooperation with the British who were now becoming the virtual rulers of the Karnatic. He paid the tribute punctually. He improved the revenue and account system of the country as will be noticed in its proper place. He built several chattrams along the main roads of the pilgrimage. Roads were opened through the forests. Immense sums were spent on the restoration of the Pagodas which were falling into ruins, the splendid Chockattan Mantapam or the cloistered precincts of the temple at Rameshwaram being finally completed by this minister ...\\" In 1789, he undertook a study about a possible supply of water to the Vaigai River from the Periyar River. Nothing was done about it at the time due to a paucity of funds. Over a century later, the British implemented his plan as the Mullaperiyar Dam in 1895. Clashing Perspectives When the child king grew up, being young, he could not discern his minister‚Äôs worth. There developed between them an ideological conflict too wide to bridge. The older and more experienced pradani felt that Ramnad ought to take a pragmatic approach and ought not to rise up against the British at that point of time. The younger Sethupathy was determined to bravely fight the British, caught up as he was with the heady struggle of the freedom movement. Page 244 of the Ramnad Manual says: \\"In 1792, Ramnad country was ceded by treaty to the British Government who sent Colonel Martinz with English force to occupy the country which was considered rebellious and troublesome and to levy the annual tribute punctually from the Setupathy. He came and settled in the heart of the town occupying a bungalow, which still exists, on the bank of the Mugavai Urani, and bears the name Colonel 'Bungalow'. The stout Colonel's likeness in the stiff military dress of the period is depicted on the walls of the hall of installation in the palace, viz \\"Ramalinga Vilasam\\". He has behind him two young officers also in military dress. Facing them all, sits the Sethupathy with his consort. Behind the Sethupathy's chair stands the great minister Muthirulappa Pillai who was on intimate terms with the Colonel.\\" This painting can be seen in the Ramnad palace, Ramalingavilasam, even to this day. Shortly after this period, the pradani was dismissed in disgrace. From the Ramnad Manual: \\"It is said that the minister became very proud and arrogant as his intimacy with the Colonel increased. The Sethupathy was in consequence obliged to dismiss him in favor of his rival Muthukumaru Pillai. The dismissed minister appears to have gone and resided at Madura as the \\"Renter\\" of the British Revenue.\\" The young King Muthuramalinga Sethupathy courageously challenged the British who deposed him in 1795. (Shortly after that, in 1803, the East India Company reduced Ramnad to a zamindari.) He was thus the last of the Sethupathy kings of the Ramnad kingdom. The other noteworthy kings were Thirumala Sethupathy under whose reign the kingdom expanded and grew, Kilavan Sethupathy who built the palace in Ramnad, and Muthu Vijayaraghunatha Sethupathy.

It utilised the Silver Fern railcars and operated from 9 December 1991 until 7 October 2001.  Background  The Rotorua Branch line had a long history of express trains between Auckland and Rotorua since the branch line opened in 1894. Until 1959, the Rotorua Express was steam-hauled and was one of New Zealand's premier trains in its heyday. It was initially only run thrice weekly in the peak Christmas and Easter period, but by 1902, it ran daily year-round, and in December 1903, dining cars were introduced. This was a rare feature for trains operated by the New Zealand Railways Department, but shortages during World War I led to their withdrawal. In the post-war period, the service was briefly cancelled in 1919, but by 1925, it was experiencing a resurgence as more powerful motive power became available in the form of AB class locomotives, and in 1930, it was upgraded to become the Rotorua Limited, completing its journey in six hours. It reverted to the name Rotorua Express in 1937, and during World War II, services had to be cut to thrice weekly due to coal shortages, and then to twice weekly after the war. Patronage plummeted as travellers opted for other modes of transport, but the Rotorua Express survived to be the last provincial steam-hauled express, operating for the final time on 6 February 1959. It was replaced by an 88 seater railcar service. The introduction of railcars on this route provided a significant improvement in service, operating six days a week on a five-hour timetable. However, the railcars soon showed signs of ageing, and mechanical problems began to plague them towards the end of their service. The government of the day considered a replacement train too expensive and believed New Zealand Railways Road Services buses could provide an adequate service instead. The railcar service last operated on 11 November 1968. The only passenger trains to operate on the Rotorua Branch line for the next 23 years were chartered excursions.  Operation  The introduction of the locomotive-hauled Overlander on the North Island Main Trunk Railway in 1991 meant that the Silver Fern railcars could be deployed on new services. Two new provincial expresses were inaugurated for the Silver Ferns: the Kaimai Express between Tauranga and Auckland, and the Geyserland Express between Auckland and Rotorua. The twice daily service began operating on 9 December 1991, just over 23 years since the cancellation of the last regular passenger service to Rotorua. The morning service, train no. 401, departed Auckland at 8:45 am, reaching Rotorua at 12:45 pm; its return run, train no. 402, left Rotorua at 1:30 pm and reached Auckland at 5:30 pm. The afternoon service, train no. 403, departed Auckland at 12:45 pm and arrived in Rotorua at 4:45 pm; its return run, train no. 404, left Rotorua at 5:30 pm and arrived in Auckland at 9:30 pm. An unfortunate situation for the new service was the terminal at Rotorua, which was now the Koutu freight yard. The line into the Travel Centre in the central city had been closed and lifted in 1990. On 9 September 1995, a new but very small passenger station operated by the Second Chance Train Trust was opened on the north side of the Lake Road bridge at the entrance to the Koutu freight yard. The new passenger station at Koutu was intended as a temporary measure until the line could be relaid to a proposed new passenger station in the central city on the corner of Ranolf and Amohau Streets, which was being pursued by the Second Chance Train Trust and the Rotorua District Council. The new station never eventuated as the Rotorua District Council would not commit funding unless Tranz Rail guaranteed that the Geyserland Express would continue to run, and Tranz Rail would not make the necessary guarantee. In April 1995 the twice-daily afternoon services were cut back to Friday and Sunday only, due to poor patronage. A daily service still remained on all other days. In November 1996 the twice-daily afternoon services on Friday and Sunday ceased altogether. In 2000 a timetable change was made to enable the introduction of the Waikato Connection commuter service between Hamilton and Auckland and allowed for a southbound journey of 4 hours and 13 minutes duration and a slightly longer northbound journey of 4 hours and 16 minutes duration. Under the new timetable, train no. 401 departed Auckland at 8:04 am and arrived in Rotorua at 12:17 pm, and train no. 402 departed Rotorua at 1:30 pm for a 5:46 pm arrival in Auckland. Intermediate stops were at Middlemore, Papakura, Pukekohe, Huntly, Hamilton, Morrinsville, Matamata and Putaruru. Demise A lack of profitability, partly due to poor advertising and marketing of the service, led to the cancellation of the Geyserland Express early in the 21st century. At its end the train was attracting an average of only 30 to 40 passengers per day which was unsustainable and thus the final service ran on 7 October 2001.  Proposed reinstatement  Following the cancellation of the service the Geyserland Express Trust was established, seeking to re-instate the train as a five-star tourist venture under the Geyserland Express name. In response to the trust's proposal, national rail operator KiwiRail stated that it would not consider running such a service unless a third party contributed funding as the service would not be financially viable by itself. KiwiRail has also indicated that it would need to see a sound business case for reinstating the train that proves there would be sufficient demand with 120 passengers daily thought to be the number required for the service to break-even. This proposal has yet to come to fruition. In September 2006 a joint proposal was put forward to the government by the Rail and Maritime Transport Union and the Green Party, to have long- distance passenger rail services transferred to the government-owned track company ONTRACK (now part of the KiwiRail group) and make ONTRACK an operator, with Toll NZ supplying locomotives and drivers in a \\"hook and tow\\" arrangement. They proposed reintroducing a number of regional services, Rotorua being one of these. ONTRACK stated in 2006 that there were two tentative proposals to operate passenger services on this line. The biggest hurdle facing the reinstatement of the Geyserland Express is that the Rotorua Branch line has been inactive and mothballed since not long after the passenger train's cessation, and although most track remains in place, it will have to be significantly repaired before it can be used again. Not having a station in the central city at Rotorua also does not help make any potential rail passenger service look attractive.

Biography Otieno was born at Nyalgunga, Nyamila village, Siaya, in Nyanza Province of western Kenya, the seventh of twelve children in a Luo family. He was educated in a mission school, then worked briefly in the law courts before joining the nationalist movement, the Kenya African Union, precursor of the Kenya African National Union (KANU). In 1953 he won a scholarship to study law at the University of Bombay. He returned to Kenya in 1960 and was admitted to the bar of the Kenyan High Court in 1961. Otieno was in private practice between 1961 and 1963, but gave up his practice for public service between 1963 and 1968, serving as deputy town clerk in Kisumu and later as principal legal assistant to the East African Common Services Organization. He re-established a private legal practice in Nairobi in 1968 and from then until his death in 1986, Otieno built a reputation as an outstanding criminal lawyer.Stamp, (1991). Burying Otieno: The politics of gender and ethnicity in Kenya, p. 816. During his time working in the law courts, Otieno was introduced in the early 1950s to Wambui Waiyaki, later known as Virginia Wambui Waiyaki Otieno by her father, an Inspector in the colonial police force. They met again in 1961, marrying in August 1963 under the colonial Marriage Act.Stamp, (1991). Burying Otieno: The politics of gender and ethnicity in Kenya, p. 815. The couple had five children, Otieno accepted the four of Wambui‚Äôs children born before their marriage as his own, and he also fostered six orphaned children of a deceased friend. All 15 children were well educated, several attending universities in the United States.Wamai, (2011), Tribute to Wambui, a maverick freedom heroine Otieno died suddenly of a heart attack on 20 December 1986.Cohen and Odhiambo (1992), Burying SM: The Politics of Knowledge and Sociology‚Äô, pp. 2‚Äì3. Otieno burial case Soon after Otieno‚Äôs death, Wambui announced that Otieno would be buried on the farm the couple owned jointly at Ngong on the outskirts of Nairobi. However, his burial became a cause c√©l√®bre in Kenya when his wife's plans were challenged by his brother, who was his closest adult-male blood relation and the Luo of the Umira Kager clan of Nyanza Province.Cohen and Odhiambo (1992), Burying SM: The Politics of Knowledge and Sociology, pp. 3‚Äì5.Stamp (1991),Burying Otieno: The Politics of Gender and Ethnicity, p. 817. Both husband and wife were highly educated Kenyans who had largely turned their backs on their ethnic identities and exemplified an emerging Kenyan bourgeoisie, whereas his brother was a railway foreman, closely associated with the Umira Kager clan. Otieno's relationship with the clan was ambiguous as, despite his westernised lifestyle, he remained a member of his clan association.Gordon (1995), Gender, Ethnicity and Class in Kenya, pp. 891-3. The case went through several hearings in the Kenyan High Court and Court of Appeal over five months during which Otieno's corpse remained unburied. The case was an exemplar of the debate between customary (indigenous, ethnic, traditional) law as against the statuary and the (common) law that had been introduced in Kenya during the colonial period and largely retained after independence. Under Kenyan law at that time, a deceased person‚Äôs will or the wishes of their spouse were not sufficient to determine a dispute between any opposed parties,Cotran (1987), Casebook on Kenyan Customary Law, p. 345. and the case hinged on whether the relevant Kenyan law on burial was statute, Common law or Customary law, and who was the next of kin responsible for the funeral rites.Wanjala (1989),Conflicts of Law and Burial, p. 110. It emerged that ethnic interests still prevailed in Kenyan family and inheritance law. The Court of Appeals ruled that when there was conflict between common law and customary law, the later is given precedent. They declared that the courts of Kenya are guided by African customary law provided that such laws are \\"not repugnant to justice and morality\\".Gehman (1989). African Traditional Religion in Biblical Perspective, p.15-16 The judges concluded that the advocate for Mrs Otieno had failed to demonstrate that traditional Luo burial customs were opposed to justice or morality. In the end the Nairobi All Saints Cathedral refused to hold the funeral service at the cathedral as the clan had desired. Mr Otieno was finally buried at Nyamila on 23 May 1987.

Together with the Catholic Guides of Ireland, it forms the Council of Irish Guiding Associations. Whereas the Catholic Guides are an all-Ireland body, the Irish Girl Guides are not organised in Northern Ireland, where Girlguiding Ulster, the branch of Girlguiding UK, operates instead. History As a soldier, the Founder of Scouting and Guiding, Robert Baden- Powell discovered that boys could be trained and used to help in emergencies. He held an experimental camp at Brownsea Island in Dorset in 1907 at which the boys were divided into patrols and trained to be self-reliant. The first big rally for Scouts was held at Crystal Palace outside London in 1909. At this there were 10,000 boys as well as some girls who dressed in a uniform and called themselves \\"Girl Scouts\\". In 1910 Girl Guides were officially formed with the founder's sister, Agnes Baden-Powell, in charge. A syllabus for girls was drawn up for their training similar to that for the Scouts. Only a year after the Girl Guide Movement was founded the first official company in Ireland was formed, in 1911 in Harold's Cross. Guiding quickly spread to Cork and Wicklow. At this time there was no border between North and South so Guiding was run as one organisation for all Ireland. In 1921 Ireland was partitioned into the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland, by the Government of Ireland Act (1920), and a separate organisation for the Free State was created from the whole, the Irish Free State Girl Guides. Ireland became a separate member of WAGGGS in 1932. In 1938 the name of the organisation was changed to the Irish Girl Guides In July 1993 at the 28th World Conference in Denmark, the Council of Irish Guiding Associations was ratified as a full member of WAGGGS. The Council of Irish Guiding Associations consists of The Irish Girl Guides and the Catholic Guides of Ireland on behalf of their members in the Republic of Ireland. The World Conference was held in Dublin in July 1999. An International Guide Camp known as \\"Solas\\" was held in Charleville, Co. Cork in July 2002, International Camp known as \\"Campa Le Cheile\\" was held in Tattersalls, Co. Meath in July 2007, International Guide Camp: \\"Camp 101\\" was held in 2012, in Lough Key forest park, Boyle, with visitors from 14 different countries. The most recent International camp \\"IGGNITE2017\\" was held in Rockwell College, Co. Tipperary from 30 July ‚Äì 6 August 2017. The next International camp is due to take place in 2021. The Honorary Ambassador for 2017 was Sin√©ad Burke. Age groups The Irish Girl Guides has four different age brackets: Ladybirds are girls aged 5‚Äì7 Brownies are girls aged 7 ‚Äì 10 Guides are girls aged 10 ‚Äì 14 Senior Branch are girls aged 14 ‚Äì 30 And from the age of 18 onwards, you can be a Leader with the Irish Girl Guides. * The Ladybird Guides uniform is a red jumper, navy neckerchief, sash and woggle. * The Brownie Guides uniform is a yellow jumper, navy neckerchief, sash and woggle. * The Guides uniform is a blue hoodie with a blue or pink T-shirt, white neckerchief with pink and blue Celtic knots and navy woggle. * The Senior Branch uniform is navy with green lining and green logo in a T-shirt and hoodie, and a pink neckerchief. * Leaders wear a lilac or navy fleece, lilac T-shirt or blue blouse and a purple neckerchief with a navy woggle, or a blue and green neckerchief with a silver scarf ring. Leaders and Senior Branch members may also wear a badge tab. Ladybirds Ladybirds are aged 5‚Äì7 and make a two-part promise, which is reflected in their sign which uses only two fingers, unlike the Guide and Brownie sign which uses three. Brownies Brownies are aged from 7 to 10. Their Leader-in-charge is called a Brown Owl and her assistant a Tawny Owl The girls are divided into sixes, each headed by a sixer, for the purpose of many activities. Guides Guides, aged 10 to 14 years, not only enjoy active weekly meetings, but also have the opportunity to camp in the outdoors. There are heaps of opportunities to earn badges for your favourite pastime and activities range from camping & adventure sports to sleep overs and pyjama hikes. There is a huge international dimension to being a Guide, and girls have many opportunities to go on trips abroad to various camps and events. They also have the opportunity to participate in home hospitality in foreign countries where they can really get to know the culture and way of life in that country. Many foreign groups visit us here in Ireland as well. The Guiding programme gives the Guides an all round education and development. Senior Branch The Senior Branch of IGG covers the age grouping 14 to 30 years of age. Guiding has something important and valuable to offer these young women which can help them to be tomorrow‚Äôs leaders in Guiding and wherever else life takes them. Senior Branch offers them the opportunity to experience adventure, enjoy international events, develop self-confidence and grow in independence. ;Older guides: :When a Guide reaches 14 years of age she is eligible to attend Senior Branch events, follow the Senior Branch programme within her Guide Company (as a senior patrol or on her own) and she can be registered at National Office to be put on the mailing list for The Welly!! and Trefoil News. By the time she finishes Guides the natural progression will be to join a Senior Branch unit, become a Leader or both depending on the choices available to her locally. The aim of being a Senior Branch member is to enable the individual to work towards her full potential as an adult, physically, mentally, socially and spiritually.

The film dramatizes the crimes of notorious serial killer Ted Bundy, and stars Michael Reilly Burke as Bundy, and Boti Bliss as Bundy's girlfriend, Lee (a character based on Elizabeth Kloepfer, Bundy's real-life girlfriend at the time he committed his killings). Plot In Seattle, Washington, 1974, law student Ted Bundy (Michael Reilly Burke) appears to be the typical friendly guy-next-door; but underneath this gentle facade lies a monster. After watching women from their home window while masturbating, Bundy builds the courage to commit his first murder. From there, he always manages to lure a young woman to his car by faking a broken arm or an illness then asking for help or by disguising himself as a police officer. Then he knocks her unconscious with a tool, ties her up and drives her to an arranged location where he rapes and murders her. Driving his yellow VW Beetle, he leaves a bloody trail through the United States. The police are left in the dark, as no one suspects the young man for his reputable character in the community; being a model citizen and top-student. In 1975, one of his victims, Tina Gabler, escapes him when she throws herself from his moving car. Based on her description of his car, Bundy is stopped by a police officer and arrested. In his trunk, the officers find pantyhose masks, a hand saw, a crowbar, knives, ropes and handcuffs. Even though he is identified by Tina Gabler in a lineup, he denies ever having seen the woman. When he is visited by his girlfriend at the Colorado State Prison, he admits to her that charges are being brought against him for multiple murders but stresses the fact that there is no evidence, however, and that he will never be convicted; at this point she distances herself from him. Due to his wish to defend himself, he is granted access to the courthouse law library, and promptly escapes by jumping from an upper story window. He is jailed again after an auto theft, but manages to escape yet again months later. This time he overpowers four women in their home and brutally beats them. After the murder of a little girl he becomes heavily intoxicated and is recognized by a police officer and arrested after a short chase. At trial the judge sentences Ted to be executed by electric chair. After having a conversation on the phone, Ted makes a final statement before the execution is carried out.

It reduces food intake, in particular fat intake, when given peripherally or into the brain. Function Enterostatin is created in the intestine by pancreatic procolipase, the other colipase serving as an obligatory cofactor for pancreatic lipase during fat digestion. Enterostatin can be created in the gastric mucosa and the mucosal epithelia in the small intestine. An increased high fat diets will cause the procolipase gene transcription and enterostatin to release into the gastrointestinal lumen. Enterostatin appears in the lymph and circulation after a meal. Enterostatin has been shown to selectively reduce fat intake during a normal meal. The testing has been successful with different species. Signaling pathway The signaling pathway of the peripheral mechanism uses afferent vagal to hypothalamic centers. The central responses are mediated through a pathway including serotonergic and opioidergic components. Inveterately, enterostatin cuts fat intake, bodyweight, and body fat. This reaction may involve multiple metabolic effects of enterostatin, which include a decrease of insulin secretion, a growth in sympathetic drive to brown adipose tissue, and the stimulation of adrenal corticosteroid secretion. A possible pathophysiological role is indicated by studies that have associated low enterostatin output and/or responsiveness to breeds of rat that become obese and prefer dietary fat. Humans with obesity also exhibit a lower secretion from pancreatic procolipase after a test meal, compared with persons of normal weight. Effects Its effects include a reduction of insulin secretion, an increase in sympathetic drive to brown adipose tissue, and the stimulation of adrenal corticosteroid secretion. At the end level, it initiates a sensation of fullness of stomach which could be the reason for its role in regulation of fat intake and reduction of body weight. For enterostatin to be utilized it needs the presence of CCK A receptors. Studies based on rats who lack these receptors have found them to be un-responsive to enterostatin. When rats have been injected with high doses of enterostatin into the brain the rats ate progressively less food as the dose was increased. In rats, examination of experiments involving the effects of peripheral or intracerebroventricular administration of enterostatin show this selectively slows down fat consumption. Medical trials Although enterostatin-like immunoreactivities exist in blood, brain, and gut, and exogenous enterostatins decrease fat appetite and insulin secretion in rats, the roles of these peptides in human obesity remain to be examined., References Digestive system Peptides ","title":"Enterostatin"},{"id":"6342667","text":"Big Brother 2 is the second season of various versions of Big

Biography=Early life, training, and medical career Frank Henry Netter was born in Manhattan at 53rd Street and Seventh Avenue, and grew up wanting to be an artist. In high school, he obtained a scholarship to study at the National Academy of Design, doing so at night while continuing high school. After further studying at the Art Students League of New York and with private teachers, he began a commercial art career, quickly achieving success and doing work for the Saturday Evening Post and The New York Times. However, his family disapproved of a career as an artist and he agreed to study medicine. After getting a degree at the City College of New York, he completed medical school at New York University and a surgical internship at Bellevue Hospital and attempted to begin practicing medicine. However, as Netter put it: \\"This was in 1933‚Äîthe depths of the Depression‚Äîand there was no such thing as medical practice. If a patient ever wandered into your office by mistake, he didn't pay.\\"Medical Times. Romaine Pierson Pub, 1981. Early medical art career Having continued doing freelance art during his medical training, including some work for his professors, he fell back on medical art to supplement his income. In particular, pharmaceutical companies began seeking Netter for illustrations to help sell new products, such as Novocain. Soon after a misunderstanding wherein Netter asked for $1,500 for a series of 5 pictures and an advertising manager agreed to and paid $1,500 each - $7,500 for the series - Netter gave up the practice of medicine. Career with CIBA In 1936, the CIBA Pharmaceutical Company commissioned a small work from him, a fold-up illustration of a heart to promote the sale of digitalis. This proved hugely popular with physicians, and a reprint without the advertising copy was even more popular. Quickly following on the success of the fold-up heart, fold-up versions of other organs were produced. Netter then proposed that a series of pathology illustrations be produced. These illustrations were distributed to physicians as cards in a folder, with advertising for CIBA products on the inside of the folder, and were also popular with physicians. CIBA then collected these illustrations in book form, producing the CIBA Collection of Medical Illustrations, which ultimately comprised 8 volumes (13 books). Beginning in 1948, CIBA also re-used illustrations by Netter in another series of materials to be given to physicians, the Clinical Symposia series. These were small magazine-like brochures that typically featured an extensive article on a medical condition, commonly with about a dozen of Netter's illustrations. This series was produced until 1999. In 1989, Netter's Atlas of Human Anatomy was published, assembled from his previous paintings and correlated by updated diagrams. CIBA's Medical Education Department (East Orange, NJ) filtered the paintings for printing, in an effort that The Big Green Books \\"might appear more 'even' over time.\\" This sometimes resulted in a considerable reduction of color variation from the truly-unique originals. Digital re-scanning of the originals continue to be published by the current copyright owner to the collection, Elsevier Medical Publishing. Selected original paintings have been showcased internationally. Netter's career was presented in a commemorative video by Ciba-Geigy in 1988. Skepticism Netter was skeptical of the claims of alternative medicine and fad diets. He wrote Fad Diets Can Be Deadly (1975) which debunked the misleading claims of fad diets.Flinn, Lewis B. (1977). Review: Fad Diets Can Be Deadly by Frank Netter. Delaware Medical Journal 49 (2): 117. Legacy In all, Netter produced nearly 4,000 illustrations, which have been included in countless publications.Hansen, J. T. (2006). Frank H. Netter, M.D. (1906-1991): The Artist and His Legacy. Clinical Anatomy 19 (6): 481-486. In perspective, that number represents an image researched, sketched, and completely painted for every three business days for over 50 years. The vast bulk of Netter's illustrations were produced for and owned by CIBA Pharmaceutical Company and its successor, CIBA-Geigy, which has since merged with Sandoz Laboratories to become Novartis. In June 2000, Novartis sold its interest in Netter's works to MediMedia USA's subsidiary Icon Learning Systems, which in turn has sold the portfolio to Elsevier, which continues to make his work available in various formats. His Atlas of Human Anatomy and other atlases have become a staple of medical education. The Frank H. Netter M.D. School of Medicine at Quinnipiac University in North Haven, Connecticut opened its doors in 2013.

At only , it is the second-smallest Brazilian municipality in terms of area, and had a population of 2,707 in 2010. √Åguas de S√£o Pedro means \\"Waters of Saint Peter\\". Its name is derived from the mineral springs in its territory and their location, which before the city's founding were part of the municipality of S√£o Pedro (Saint Peter). The average annual temperature in the city is , and most of the municipality's vegetation consists of reforested area. In 2016 there were 2,491 vehicles in the city. Exclusively an urban area, with no rural areas, the city had four health facilities in 2009. Its Human Development Index (HDI) is 0.854, the second highest in the state of S√£o Paulo, as well as the second highest in Brazil, surpassed only by S√£o Caetano do Sul. √Åguas de S√£o Pedro was incorporated in the 1940s. The city is known for its mineral waters of medicinal value, their natural sources popular tourist attractions. One of the springs, Fonte Juventude, has the second most highly sulfurous water in the world. It also has two large parks, Dr.Octavio Moura Andrade Park and the Parque das √Åguas \\"Jos√© Benedito Zani\\", and the municipal mini-garden, all important green areas of the city. The municipality is located in the region of Itaqueri Ridge; Itaqueri means \\"lying stone\\" in Tup√≠‚ÄìGuaran√≠in the south-central part of the state of S√£o Paulo. It is a planned city and since its founding has been a tourist destination.  History = Origins  Until 1800 the region of S√£o Pedro and its enclave was virgin forest. The first known people to set foot in √Åguas de S√£o Pedro territory were, as in most municipalities in the S√£o Paulo countryside, bandeirantes seeking precious stones, especially gold, opening many roads and routes in the dense forest. One of these routes, called Caminho do Picad√£o (Way of the Forest Trail), started in Itu, passed through Piracicaba and advanced towards the hinterlands of Araraquara. For years, many farms were established in the region, until in 1883, S√£o Pedro was detached from Piracicaba and became politically independent. The economy at that time was based on coffee production, and many Italian families settled in these regions to work under partnership contracts to replace the slave labor. In this way, the Italian immigrant Angelo Franzin arrived in Brazil in 1887, going to work on a farm called \\"Recreio\\", owned by Jo√£o Rezende da Cruz; just a year later Franzin would run other farms, like Santa Rita, Santa Eul√°lia and Ros√°rio. After many years of work, he purchased land with his brother J√°como and decided to try coffee planting. The first properties they acquired were the farms Palmeiras and Limoeiro, followed by the lands of Floresta Escura, Gon√ßalves, Tuncum and Araqu√°, as well as houses, lots, and two machines to process coffee beans.  Search for oil and the discovery of springs  In the 1920s J√∫lio Prestes, the governor of S√£o Paulo, began exploration of the oil prospecting area in S√£o Pedro. His efforts failed to find petroleum, and the equipment was abandoned, but still gushing out mineral water. Subsequently, other attempts were made to find oil at greater depths, and again no oil was found. One oil rig structure still remains; it is called the Torre de Petr√≥leo Engenheiro √Çngelo Balloni (Engineer √Çngelo Balloni Oil Tower). Years later, in 1934, Franzin, owner of some of the land in the area, built a simple bath house (currently known as the \\"Youth Fountain\\") in one of the springs where he bathed, the waters of which had a characteristic smell of sulfur. A year later, a group of townspeople bought a lot measuring around the original wood bath house, where they built a health resort. It was composed of twelve masonry bathtubs. In that same year, Octavio Moura Andrade decided to build a spa there, giving it the name of Caldas de S√£o Pedro, and, along with his brother, Antonio Joaquim de Moura Andrade, established the company √Åguas Sulf√≠dricas e Termais de S√£o Pedro S.A. (Saint Peter Thermal and Sulphydric Waters S.A.). For four years, the Institute for Technological Research (IPT) of the University of S√£o Paulo conducted a series of studies of those waters. Generally, water from great depths has a high concentration of substances that may be harmful to human beings, and its pH may not be suitable for bathing. In 1940 the results were published in Bulletin 26 of the IPT. The waters were deemed good for bathing, and their medicinal properties were studied by Professor Jo√£o de Aguiar Pupo, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine of S√£o Paulo.  Foundation and incorporation  Recognizing the importance of the thermal springs in the region, the S√£o Paulo State Government on 19 June 1940 founded the (Hydromineral and Climatic Spa of √Åguas de S√£o Pedro). Despite this, the city celebrates its birthday on 25 July, the date in 1940 of the founding of the first major building in the city, the Grande Hotel (now Grande Hotel S√£o Pedro). The municipality of √Åguas de S√£o Pedro was incorporated by State Law No.233, of 24 December 1948.  Construction of the spa town and urban planning  Map in 1990 To promote the development and exploitation of the medicinal waters in an economically viable way, Octavio Moura Andrade conceived and designed a city focused on hydrotherapy and residential purposes: a spa town. √Åguas de S√£o Pedro was created as a hydromineral spa, fully planned and aiming to serve both those who needed treatment and tourists looking for fun and leisure. The urban planner Jorge de Macedo Vieira was chosen to integrate the use of space with the mineral waters, topography, soil, and climate, conducting a two-year-long detailed study of the area prior to designing the city. It was only in 1940 that the project was completed, being recorded in the Real Estate Registry Office of the District of S√£o Pedro under number1, in accordance with the requirements of the Brazilian Federal Decree-Law No.58, of 10 December 1937. As part of this project several buildings were constructed, including a large luxury hotel to welcome tourists, as well as a casino, one of the first in the country with activity regulated by the government. A sanitation system was constructed, with the technical firm Saturnino de Brito from Rio de Janeiro hired to study and control the sanitation system in the area around the Grande Hotel. Several roads were reconstructed, including an road connecting S√£o Pedro to the springs that can handle the traffic of heavy vehicles; construction of an airport (now S√£o Pedro Airport) in a 40-alqueire area (239.2acres, or 96.8ha) with four runways, a departure lounge, electricity, telephone, running water, hangar and refueling station. Energy infrastructure was improved. Because S√£o Pedro's power grid was in disrepair, a private power line was built connecting S√£o Pedro to the construction works of the spa, and in the Grande Hotel was installed an emergency powerhouse with two diesel generators capable of supplying the hotel and the town.  Contemporary history  After the opening of the spa, tourism gained momentum. The city became one of the members of the Regi√£o Tur√≠stica da Serra do Itaqueri (Touristic Region of the Itaqueri Ridge), composed of twelve municipalities. With the large influx of tourists, the need developed for improvements in the commercial sector, prompting renovation of the Rua do Com√©rcio (Trade Street, old nickname for the street Jo√£o Batista Azevedo). In 2013 a group of companies led by Telef√¥nica Vivo announced plans to make √Åguas de S√£o Pedro the first digital city in the country. In the first stage of the project, the telephone wiring of the city was replaced, changing from copper to optical fiber. An antenna, providing 4G technology, and security cameras were installed; tablets were distributed to students of the municipal school; presence sensors in a smart car parking system and a smart street lighting system were installed, reducing energy consumption. At the end of 2015, though continuing to provide services to the community, Telef√¥nica Vivo transferred managing responsibility to the city government. The second stage would begin in 2016, with the installation of interactive kiosks in public places, the training of teachers to work with new technologies, and the scheduling of medical appointments over the Internet, but ended up not being implemented. In addition, most of the residents went on to complain that most of the services promised no longer exist or do not work.

The city is located at latitude 22¬∞35'50.422\\" south and longitude 47¬∞53'02.309\\" west, and at a distance of northwest of the S√£o Paulo state capital. Its only adjacent municipality is S√£o Pedro, from which is one of the four enclaves of Brazil, besides Arroio do Padre, Lad√°rio and Portel√¢ndia.  Geomorphology and hydrology  Araqu√° River The geomorphology of the area of √Åguas de S√£o Pedro is characterized by reliefs of low, soft hillsseparated by valleys without major river plainsand it is slightly rugged, with sites that only rarely exceed of unevenness. The municipality is at an altitude of above sea level, and located in a geographic region called the S√£o Paulo State Peripheral Depression, near the border with the Western Plateau, in an area of basaltic cuestas. √Åguas de S√£o Pedro is located in the so-called Piramboia Formation (Piramboia means \\"snake fish\\" in Tup√≠‚ÄìGuaran√≠), one of the five stratigraphic subdivisions of the Paran√° Basin, all formed at different periods, in which Triassic and Early Cretaceous ages sediments predominate. The sediments are composed of thin to medium arenites, white-orange to reddish in color, and with tangential cross-bedding in a mid- size to large base; these features are indicative of temporary rivers in the past in a semiarid environment. The city is situated in the central part of the Medium Tiet√™ Zone, which occupies about , or two-fifths of the total area of the Peripheral Depression. It is bounded by Araqu√° River (Araqu√° means \\"hole of the world\\" in Tup√≠‚ÄìGuaran√≠), which has a general north‚Äìsouth route, and also by the Limoeiro and Das Palmeiras lakes.

The highest place of the city was selected to erect it. In 1946 a chapel was completed, its architecture based on a chapel seen by Dr.Octavio in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The chapel was dedicated to Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception. In 1954 √Åguas de S√£o Pedro was removed from the City of S√£o Pedro parish, and on 29 May of that same year, the present-day Immaculate Conception Parish was founded by Don Ernesto de Paula. The parish is subordinate to the Diocese of Piracicaba. Years after the foundation of the parish, a new site near the central area of the city was selected for the construction of a new church, but those plans were not completed because Canon Marcos Van Inn, the creator of the project, died. Then the parochial hall of the city was nominated by the Bishop of Piracicaba, Don An√≠ger Maria Melillo, to be adapted into the city's Mother Church, as it remains today. The title of Immaculate Conception was transferred from the old chapel to the Mother Church, and the chapel is now dedicated to Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception of the Apparition.  Economy  Small craft shops in the city According to data for 2016 from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), the municipality had a gross domestic product (GDP) of R$132,616,560.00, of which R$7,533,360.00 were product taxes net of subsidies, and the GDP per capita was R$41,378.02.

Salaries along with other compensation totaled R$32,625,000.00 and the average monthly wage of the municipality was 2.2 minimum wages. The city does not have a rural area, so the primary sector does not factor in the local GDP. Although the municipality does not depend on any major industry, the gross value added to the GDP from the secondary sector was R$10,504,940.00. R$94,367,210.00 of the municipal GDP is from services, currently the major source of GDP of √Åguas de S√£o Pedro. A major part of the tertiary sector is tourism, and the city's economy is geared exclusively toward this sector. The municipality of √Åguas de S√£o Pedro is integrated with the Tourism Region of the Itaqueri Ridge and has as its main attraction its medicinal mineral waters. According to city officials, the new tourism routes go through regionalization. Tourists attracted by the natural attractions also help to stimulate the commercial sector of the city. The busiest retail centres are Carlos Mauro Avenue and Trade Street, which after renovations costing R$302,000.00 has become a pedestrian street. According to the Brazilian Secretary of Foreign Trade (SECEX), in 2016 the exports of √Åguas de S√£o Pedro totaled only US$838, all originated from Australia. Among the products exported are imitation jewelry, woven baskets and plastic lids. The holidays also tend to bring more income to the city. In the 2016 Carnival, for example, the Municipal Secretary of Tourism said that the influx of tourists would result in the addition of R$5million into the local economy. Several economic programs were created to highlight the Tourism Region, attract more tourists, and improve the commercial and lodging sectors.  Media  Only one newspaper is published in the city, called Jornal √Åguas News, founded 21 May 2016 and have biweekly circulation. The city, however, is served by regional newspapers reporting events in the city, such as A Tribuna de S√£o Pedro, and Jornal O Regional, from S√£o Pedro, and Jornal de Piracicaba, A Tribuna Piracicabana, and Gazeta de Piracicaba, from Piracicaba. √Åguas de S√£o Pedro has only one radio station broadcasting from the city, R√°dio FM Est√¢ncia Ltda. (call sign ZYD 970), which began in 1987 and now is branded as 92 FM.  Culture and recreation = Tourism  On weekends the city receives an influx of tourists that numbers up to twice the number of year-round residentsabout 6,000 tourists. On the long holidays, the number of tourists can reach 30,000. √Åguas de S√£o Pedro is one of eleven municipalities considered hydromineral spas by the government of the state of S√£o Paulo, by fulfilling certain prerequisites set by state Law. Federal Law no.2,661 from 3 December 1955 states: \\"It is considered thermomineral, hydromineral, or simply mineral spa the location recognized by state law, and which has springs of thermal or mineral, natural waters exploited in compliance with the provisions of this law and the Federal Decree-Law no.7,841, from 8August 1945.\\" This recognition ensures these municipalities a larger budget from the state to invest in regional tourism. Also, the city has the right to add before its name the title of hydromineral spa, the term by which the city is to be designated by both the municipal administration as well as the state references. As green areas the city has the Mini Horto (Mini Garden), a place with a plant nursery and a pond, and two large parks: * Dr. Octavio Moura Andrade Park (named in 1975), area with more than one million square meters (approximately 10,763,900 square feet), with 16 hiking trails with a length of . In the park can be found several species of the regional fauna and flora, as about 250 types of birds and approximately 40 coatis. * Parque das √Åguas \\"Jos√© Benedito Zani\\" (Waters Park \\"Jos√© Benedito Zani\\", named in 2000), an area with with a jogging track, an outdoor gym, a skate ramp, and a bikeway. √Åguas de S√£o Pedro had the Museu das Telecomunica√ß√µes \\"Gilberto Affonso Penna\\" (Museum of Telecommunications \\"Gilberto Affonso Penna\\"), better known as Museu do R√°dio (Radio Museum), which was inaugurated in 2003 and had a collection of 117 items, ranging from gramophones to radio transmitters and typewriters. After a renovation in the place where it was located, the Centro Educacional e Cultural Angelo Franzin (Angelo Franzin Educational and Cultural Center, also known by the acronym CECAF), the museum was closed and has no forecast of reopening. There are two local holidays in √Åguas de S√£o Pedro: the city anniversary (25 July) and the day of the Immaculate Conception (8 December).  Mineral springs  Drinking fountain with the three types of mineral water of the city √Åguas de S√£o Pedro is popular for its mineral waters, as its name indicates. There are three fountains in the municipality: Fonte Juventude (Youth Fountain), Fonte Gioconda (Gioconda Fountain), and Fonte Almeida Salles (Almeida Salles Fountain), all with a much higher mineralization than most other Brazilian mineral springs. Of these three, only the last two have a natural outcrop, as the Juventude fountain water comes from the artesian well at an old oil exploration site. The water in the Fontan√°rio Municipal (Municipal Fountain) is potable, and for baths, there is the Spa Thermal Dr. Octavio Moura Andrade, the municipal bath house. The water of the Fonte Juventude is collected at a depth of ; it is the most highly sulfurous water in Brazil and the Americas and is the second in the world in sulfurous components (only behind the Pergoli fountain in Tabiano, Italy), with 34.3 milligrams of sulfur oxygenated compounds, 4mg of hydrogen sulfide, and 53mg of sodium hydrosulfide and sodium sulfide per liter of water. It is indicated for immersion baths and treatment of skin diseases. Fonte Gioconda has a high sodium sulfate content (42 mg/100 ml), and is therefore indicated in the treatment of stomach diseases. The fountain was named in honor of the Giocondo family, who ceded the land around the spring to Octavio Moura Andrade. The Fonte Almeida Salles is named in honor of the homonymous doctor of the Secretariat of Agriculture of the State of S√£o Paulo who first visited it and tested the medicinal qualities of the water. It is a sodium bicarbonate water indicated for stomach and liver diseases.  Caminho do Sol  Idealized by Jos√© Palma in 2002, the Caminho do Sol (Way of the Sun) is a preparatory way to the Way of St. James, and it is recognized by the Xunta de Galicia. The route ends at the city of √Åguas de S√£o Pedro, in the Casa de Santiago (House of St.James) located in the Mini Horto. Several pilgrims, with bicycles or hiking, come to the city every year along the way as a religious pilgrimage or tourism. The way is long and passes through 12 municipalities in the following order: Santana de Parna√≠ba, Pirapora do Bom Jesus, Cabre√∫va, Itu, Salto, Elias Fausto, Capivari, Mombuca, Saltinho, Piracicaba, S√£o Pedro, and √Åguas de S√£o Pedro.  Arts and crafts  In the field of performing arts, between 2006 and 2010, an ongoing Theatre Exhibition of S√£o Pedro and √Åguas de S√£o Pedro was held. In 2010 the project won the \\"Competition to Support Festivals of Art in the State S√£o Paulo\\" that was promoted by the Secretariat of State for Culture, part of the \\"Cultural Action Program\\" organized by the Associa√ß√£o Cultural Arte (Art Cultural Association), which ensured that the event had full and unrestricted support from the governments of the two cities. Crafts are also one of the most spontaneous forms of cultural expression of √Åguas de S√£o Pedro. In the city it is possible to find a variety of crafts, made with regional raw materials and created in accordance with the local culture and way of life. The \\"ART'S TRAMAArtisans Association of S√£o Pedro and Region\\", along with other institutions such as the municipal government or the Superintendence of Craft Work in Communities (SUTACO), bring together many craftsmen from the region and provide space for production, exhibition and sale of crafts such as quilts and crochet table runners, flowers produced with dry corn leaves, and woven pieces produced on looms. Usually, this material is sold at bazaars (like the ones promoted by the municipal Social Solidarity Fund), fairs, exhibitions or craft stores.  Sports  In 1941 the Grande Hotel hosted the first major chess competition in Brazil, the Torneio Internacional de √Åguas de S√£o Pedro (√Åguas de S√£o Pedro International Tournament). More recently, √Åguas de S√£o Pedro has sent delegations to participate in the Jogos Regionais do Idoso (Senior Regional Games, known by the acronym JORI) and the Jogos Abertos do Idoso (Senior Open Games, known by the acronym JAI). In 2018 56 athletes were sent to participate in the 22nd JORI, a competition with participation of athletes from 40 municipalities, and √Åguas de S√£o Pedro attained 11th place.  Government  City Hall (white and blue building at left) and the Municipal Council (yellow building in the center) The municipal administration is formed by the mayor and nine vereadores (councillors), who are elected for a term of four years. The installation of the Municipal Council and the inauguration of the first Sanitary Mayor, Carlos Mauro, appointed by the State Governor, took place on 2 April 1949. The mayor holds executive power and has nine secretariats under his command: Administration, Education, Finances, Tourism, Environment and Safety, Health, Social and Thermal Promotion, Public Works, and Urban Services.

According to the Regional Electoral Court of S√£o Paulo, the city had in 2014 2,881 voters, a number greater than the number of inhabitants. This happens because the city has many vacationers and students that end up transferring their electoral register to the municipality.

The numbers I, II and III represents the three different buildings of the school; each building houses different school grades. * Escola Estadual Angelo Franzin (\\"Angelo Franzin\\" State School), also known by the acronym E.E. \\"Angelo Franzin\\", is a high school. The city also has an institution of higher education: inaugurated in 1995, the Centro Universit√°rio SenacCampus √Åguas de S√£o Pedro (Senac University Center√Åguas de S√£o Pedro Campus) is a private university maintained by the Brazilian National Commercial Training Service, that is known by the acronym Senac (). It was formerly known as Senac Faculties, but in 2004 it was accredited by the Brazilian Ministry of Education and Culture as University Center. In Brazil there is a difference between Faculty, University Center and University, which respectively differ in size, in the academic titles of its teaching staff and in the time of dedicated service. In 2017 the municipality had a total student enrollment of 686 (105 in the pre-school, 431 in the elementary school, and 150 in the high school) and 51 teachers (5 in the pre-school, 34 in the elementary school, and 12 in the high school) in its schools. According to the Indicador Social de Desenvolvimento dos Munic√≠pios (Social Index of Development of Municipalities, known by the acronym ISDM) of the Get√∫lio Vargas Foundation in 2010, the percentage of illiterate people over 18 years of age was 1.71%, and among people aged 15‚Äì17 was 0%. According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) data from the 2010 census, there were in √Åguas de S√£o Pedro a total of 2,441 people over 10 years of age, of which 741 had no education and had not completed primary school, 360 had completed primary school and had incomplete secondary education, 729 had completed secondary education and had incomplete higher education, and 610 had completed higher education.  Infrastructure  The city of √Åguas de S√£o Pedro had 990 residences in 2010. Of this total 654 were owned properties, with 610 owned and already paid for, 44 being paid for, and 266 rented; 69 properties were lent, with 38 lent by an employer and 31 lent by other means.  Transportation  Bus station of √Åguas de S√£o Pedro In 1892 a railway station was opened in the town of S√£o Pedro; it belonged to the Companhia Uni√£o Sorocabana e Ytuana, which later served as a route for those who wanted to reach √Åguas de S√£o Pedro. Between 1907 and 1919 it was part of the Sorocabana Railway, and until 1966 it belonged to the Sorocabana Railroad, part of the already defunct Piracicaba Line. The station was deactivated at the end of the 1960s, when the first paved roads were built in S√£o Pedro and its enclave. Today, only one highway passes through the city, the SP-304, Rodovia Geraldo de Barros. It connects √Åguas de S√£o Pedro with the cities of S√£o Pedro ( northwest) and Piracicaba ( southeast). Due to the high volume of truck traffic, part of the road that passes through the urban area developed several potholes. In response to that problem, politicians of the municipality and the neighbouring cities pressured the state governor for the duplication of the highway. After the Department of Highways (DER) approved the project, the construction began on 22 August 2014, was finished and the state governor officially declared the work completed by inaugurating the last kilometer built on 16 March 2018. The city is located near the S√£o Pedro Airport, which opened in 1938 and has undergone renovation in 2010. It is situated near SP-304, and has a dirt runway long. The old city bus station was upgraded to properly receive the passengers of intercity buses, re-opening on 31 December 2008. The municipal fleet in 2016 had a total of 2,491 vehicles, registering 1.29 inhabitants per vehicle, which causes traffic flow problems, especially in the city center on weekends.  Utilities  Sabesp √Åguas de S√£o Pedro water treatment plant Electricity is provided to the city by the Companhia Paulista de For√ßa e Luz (S√£o Paulo State Power and Light Company). The entire public power grid has been donated to the company and has been run by it since 1973. Water is provided by the Basic Sanitation Company of the State of S√£o Paulo (Sabesp) since 1977, providing tap water to 100% of the city, but serves only 93.47%‚Äì95% of the city with sewage collection. √Åguas de S√£o Pedro had not a sewage treatment plant, so all the collected sewage (70,000 l/day, BOD/month) was not treated and flowed into the Araqu√° River, which is also one of the city's main water resources. The absence of a sewage treatment plant in the city has generated complaints from the population, questioning the responsibility of Sabesp in this problem. Other problematic cases such as water catchment, siltation, and environmental degradation have caused the mayor to consider not renewing the city's contract with the company. After several negotiations, the contract was renewed in May 2013. The first equipment for the construction of a sewage treatment plant arrived in November 2015, and the building was finished in 2016. Telephone and cable Internet services are offered by Vivo. At its foundation, it was attended by the company Companhia Telef√¥nica Brasileira (Brazilian Telephone Company, known by the acronym CTB), and at the end of 1963, Octavio Moura Andrade and partners founded the Telef√¥nica √Åguas de S√£o Pedro Ltda. (√Åguas de S√£o Pedro Telephone Ltd.), who started to lead the telephone industry in the municipality. In 1973, the company was acquired by Telecomunica√ß√µes de S√£o Paulo S/A (S√£o Paulo Telecommunications S.A., known by the acronym TELESP), and became part of the South-Central Regional A5 (OA5) District of the company. After the privatization of the Brazilian state-owned telephone companies in 1998, Telef√≥nica (now trading as Vivo) started to control the telephone services of the municipality.  Health care  In 2009 the municipality had four health care facilities, two private and two public (the Municipal First Aid Clinic and the Basic Health Unit Eurides de Lima \\"Dinho Barbosa\\"). The city also has outpatient care with medical care in basic specialties, dental care with a dentist, and access to services in the Sistema √önico de Sa√∫de (Unified Health System, known by the acronym SUS). In December 2009 √Åguas de S√£o Pedro had sixteen doctors, four general practitioners, four nursing assistants, three nurses, two nursing technicians, two physiotherapists and eight people distributed in other categories, for a total of 39 health care professionals.  Public safety  The absence of murders for more than a decade is celebrated in √Åguas de S√£o Pedro. Since its foundation, the municipality had recorded only one murder case, a double homicide on 17 August 1994, when F√°tima Rinaldi Dante, 40 years old, and her granddaughter, Maria Virg√≠nia Dante, 1year old, were shot dead. The case was never solved. The city has a third-class police station, and is patrolled by the 2nd group of the 3rd company of the 10th battalion of the Military Police of S√£o Paulo State and the Municipal Civil Guard. Also, the city does not have a Fire Department station, being then attended by the one located in the neighboring city of S√£o Pedro.

Soon after, a weak low pressure center associated with the system formed southwest of Acapulco, Mexico.http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/099/mwr-099-04-0286.pdf The system later went through rapid intensification, becoming a tropical depression on August 31 and Tropical Storm Norma later that day. Initially with a loose organization, Norma continued to organize and strengthen, reaching its peak of on September 2. Satellite pictures showed cirrus outflow was greater in the tops of the feeder bands than in the eyewall chimney. On September 3, Navy reconnaissance reported a 992 mbar pressure, Norma's lowest. The Labor Day Storm of 1970 on September 5th. The storm was drawing moisture from the weakening Norma, which is visible to the south southwest of the storm. Shortly after the 992 mbar report, however, Norma began to weaken. The same recon that reported the and 992 mbar reading reported back with a mere some time after. Despite the sudden drop in winds, the minimum pressure remained around 994 mbar. The weakening became obvious on satellite presentation, which showed cool inflow and a sheet of stratocumulus clouds around the west semicircle extending under the storm clouds. Norma continued to weaken, degrading into a depression by September 4. At this point, the circulation forced moist and unstable maritime air into Arizona which resulted in disastrous floods during Labor Day along with a slow moving cold front. This system would become known as the Labor Day Storm of 1970. On September 5, a cloud spiral was still visible west of Baja California, but the storm's circulation dissipated, with the remnants of the storm finally dissipating on September 6, just before making landfall on Baja California. Impact While Norma did not make landfall while tropical (even though it came close to making landfall on Baja California before dissipating), the circulation introduced unstable air into Arizona and Utah which, along with a cold front, resulted in record amounts of rainfall. Baja California For an stretch of the coat, waves were measured. Winds of were recorded at Bahia Tortugas, a village on Punta Eugenia. Arizona The rainfall in Arizona produced deadly flash floods which caused over $1 million in damages and killed 23 people, 14 of which died when Tonto Creek, which was in the vicinity of Kohl's Ranch, became flooded. Other deaths were reported among automobile drivers.http://ci.show- low.az.us/departments/public_works/MultiHazardMitigationPlan/Appendix%20F/HistoricalHazards_Navajo.pdf#search=%22%22Labor%20Day%20Storm%20of%201970%22%22 Total rainfall exceeded 7 inches in certain locations, with Workman's Creek receiving of rain.

The most noteworthy rainfall total was recorded in Bug Creek, which experienced an estimated of rain in a 24-hour period.http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/htmlfiles/state.extremes.html No deaths or damage was reported in connection to the storm. Records When of rain fell at Workman's Creek in a 24-hour period, it became the highest amount of rain to fall in Arizona in a 24-hour period. The record stood until 1997, when the remnants of Hurricane Nora produced of rain on the top of Harquahala Mountain. A similar record was recorded in Utah when of rain fell in Bug Creek in a 24-hour period. Unlike the Arizona rainfall record, this record still stands today. When the rains of Norma caused the San Juan River to flood its banks, a size of 1,090 m3 was obtained, making this the largest flood of the San Juan since 1962, when the Navajo Dam was completed. The most runoff from the storm was downstream from the reservoir.Changes in Riparian Vegetation in the Southwestern United States: Floods and Riparian Vegetation on the San Juan River, Southeastern Utah With 23 associated deaths in Arizona, Norma was the deadliest storm in the state's history.

It is a novelty song where each verse ends with a mind rhyme of shit, the initial sh- segueing into the refrain, \\"Shaving Cream\\"; for example: :\\"I have a sad story to tell you :It may hurt your feelings a bit :Last night when I walked into my bathroom :I stepped in a big pile of ...shhhhh . . . aving cream, :be nice and clean. . . . :Shave ev'ry day and you'll always look keen.\\" The original version of \\"Shaving Cream\\" was issued on Bell's Cocktail Party Songs record label in 1946, with Phil Winston on vocals under the pseudonym Paul Wynn, and, as that name was also used by Bell himself, Winston's version has often been mistaken for Bell's, and has appeared on Benny Bell compilation albums more frequently than Bell's own version. After the song began to be played on the Dr. Demento radio show in the 1970s, Vanguard Records reissued the song in 1975, and it became a hit, peaking at #30 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Early copies of the 1975 Vanguard single credited Bell as the performer. However, after controversy ensued, the same recording was re-released with revised labels crediting Paul Wynn as performer. A remake of \\"Shaving Cream\\" performed as a duet with Dr. Demento was released on the albums Dr. Demento's Dementia Royale and Dr. Demento's 25th Anniversary Collection. Dr. Demento occasionally performed the song live in concert with \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic's band (Yankovic playing accordion). Another 1970s cover version was recorded by a soca group, The Fabulous Five. Dave Van Ronk performed this song at his shows over the years, and a version is included on the CD of rarities, The Mayor of MacDougal Street. He modifies the trick of the song by changing the last line to \\"stick your head in a bucket of shit\\" rather than \\"a bucket of shaving cream\\". On the 2017 revival of The Gong Show, this song was performed as an intermission partway through each show, and was sung in audience sing-along fashion, led by a staff performer named Albert.

The gang's leaders, made the local inn, The Walnut Tree Inn, their headquarters and drop for their contraband. The Inn was often used when they waited for others of their group to bring in goods from across the Marshes. High up on the southern side of the inn is a small window through which the gang would shine a signal light to their partners up on Aldington Knoll when the way was clear for them. They were probably the last 'major' gang that existed in Kent and it is believed that they were known as The Blues from the colour of the clothing that they wore or from blue flares used for signalling.Whitstable Scene The Gang's activities The gang was probably founded in or around 1817, as gang-based smuggling returned, but the first mention of the Aldington Gang was in November 1820, after the men had returned home from the Napoleonic Wars and found little to do to make any money. It is believed that they were active well before this date and were responsible for incidents in Deal, St. Margaret's Bay, north of Dover.Kent Resources The gang carried out a landing near Sandgate with 250 men taking part, unloading a galley laden with spirits, tobacco and salt that had been rowed across the Channel from Boulogne and pulled up onto the shingle beach. Three groups of smugglers had gathered: one to unload and transport the cargo and two groups of \\"Batmen\\", to protect the first. They were spotted by a few local blockade men, as the main blockade force had been lured away by the smugglers. \\"Batmen\\" stood guard when a run was taking place to fight off anyone who tried to interfere; they gained their name from the long clubs, or ‚Äòbats‚Äô they carried. Some smugglers used guns, although the shooting of the Revenue officer often roused the authorities to step up their efforts against smuggling.Broughton School In February 1821 the Battle of Brookland took place between the Customs and Excise men and the Aldington Gang. The smugglers had sent 250 men down to the coast between Camber and Dungeness but the party was seen by the Watch House at Camber and a fight took place over Walland Marsh. Although the Gang successfully completed the unloading of the goods, they were harried right across the Marshes until they reached Brookland, where the Gang turned on the blockade force. Five men were killed in the fighting and there were more than twenty wounded.VillageNet Their leader at that time was Cephas Quested who, in the confusion of the Battle, turned to a man close by him, handed him a musket and instructed him to \\"blow an Officer's brains out.\\" Unfortunately for Quested, in the confusion of the fight and being somewhat intoxicated, the man that he had turned to was a Midshipman of the blockade force, who immediately turned the gun on Quested and arrested him. After being sentenced, Quested was taken to Newgate and hanged for his activities on 4 July 1821. In 1792 George Ransley was born at Ruckinge, and started work as a ploughman then a carter. The story goes that he found a stash of spirits hidden by the smugglers and with the proceeds of the sale bought his house The Bourne Tap, from where he frequently sold spirits that he had landed. Another location frequented by the Gang at this time was an Augustine Priory, at Bilsington which was used as a farm house and they would use as a store house. Ransley took over the gang of smugglers after the Battle of Brookland, and employed a doctor, with an allowance paid to a man's family if he was ill, a policy that avoided the capture of injured men by the revenue forces and helped to ensure loyalty. The gang became stronger and landed goods along the coast from Rye to Deal . In July 1826 they were caught on the beach at Dover and a Midshipman, Richard Morgan, was killed. In October 1826 Ransley was arrested at Aldington by the Bow Street Runners on suspicion of murder, but as it took place in the dark, the death sentence was converted to deportation along with his brother-in-law Samuel Bailey as was fellow gang members Thomas Gillham and James Hogben.George Ransley (b. 1821 Ruckinge, Kent) Ransley was sent to work on a farm in Tasmania where his knowledge of farming was a great benefit to him. Two years later his wife Elizabeth followed with their ten children - only nine survived the journey. He was assigned to his wife in 1833. He was finally granted a pardon in 1838 and farmed at River Plenty, Hobart. He died in 1856 and is buried in River Plenty, New Norfolk, along with his wife. Downfall The success of smuggling gangs is dependent upon the goodwill of the local people. The gang began to lose this special relationship as they extended their ruthless behaviour beyond that of the publicly acceptable crime of smuggling and turned on the rural communities. Some of the members of the Gang started resorting to breaking into local residences. The problems were compounded when Richard Morgan, a member of the blockade forces at Dover, was shot and killed. Morgan, who was a quartermaster with the blockade, was well liked in Dover and spotted the Gang trying to run a cargo ashore on Dover Beach. After firing a warning shot the Gang turned on him, resulting in his death and the wounding of a seaman who was with him. A reward was offered for information after this incident which was claimed by several people and as a consequence, in October, 1826 the blockade forces together with two Bow Street Runners raided The Bourne Tap and captured George Ransley and seven other members of the Gang. Eventually a total of nineteen men were captured and stood trial at Maidstone Assizes in January 1827. They were all found guilty of charges that carried the death penalty but their lawyer, a local gentleman from Maidstone, managed to get their sentences commuted to transportation. Stories *There is a story that as a result of a fight between the Gang members one night, one of the smugglers' number was murdered and the body disposed of down a well at the side of the Inn. It is said that on some nights the sounds of scuffling and a body being dragged outside can still be heard. *Although the Gang had a brutal reputation, they were not without a sense of humour. One officer who was blindfolded and had his legs bound was told he was to be thrown over a cliff. He managed to cling on to tufts of grass as he fell and hung with his legs dangling for some time. It was not until his blindfold slipped that he realised his feet were a matter of inches above the ground. The 'cliff' was only seven feet (2 m) high. *Ransley lived at a The Bourne Tap and stories were circulated about there being a ghost which manifested itself as a floating severed head in the old building which served well to keep the curious away. *Ransley was known for his organisational abilities but stories differ about the man. Some said he was a giant of over six feet, others said he was hardly more than five feet tall, some said he was a likeable rogue, others lived in absolute fear of him. Whatever was the truth, there was no doubt that he could be as ruthless as the situation demanded.

It has separate transmitter sites for daytime and night operations. Owned and operated by Entercom, its studios are located in North Highlands, with a Sacramento address. Previously, KIFM was known as KCTC, which has had a history in the Sacramento market as both an FM and AM station. KCTC as an FM station KCTC's most successful years were in the 70s, broadcasting a variant of the \\"Beautiful Music\\" format which they called \\"the California Sound\\" with its occasional vocals in each 15-minute set. The format continued until 1989, when KCTC became KYMX, a soft rock/adult contemporary station. In turn, the KCTC call letters moved to AM 1320, where for years it was an adult standards station as part of the Music Of Your Life network. KCTC as an AM station Competition for KCRA on the Sacramento AM dial in the mid-1950s included KROY 1240 (CBS), KGMS 1380 (MBS), KXOA 1470 (MBS), and KFBK 1530 (ABC), which was owned by McClatchy Enterprises, also owner of the Sacramento Bee.. From 1955 to 1978, KCRA was co-owned with TV Channel 3 KCRA-TV and in the '70s was known as KCRA Newsradio 132 while still under ownership of Kelly Broadcasting. Before its sale to Entercom, KCTC was owned by Tribune Broadcasting of Chicago, owners of WGN and the Chicago Tribune, from 1978 to 1996. For a time under the Tribune ownership (1978-1989), 1320 AM was known as KGNR Newsradio 132. In the early 1970s, prior to Tribune, 1320 KCRA was Sacramento's home for the syndicated \\"American Top 40\\" program with Casey Kasem; a September 1971 broadcast of the show mentions KCRA as an affiliate, as does a broadcast of the syndicated program from December 1974. In 1989, KCTC moved from its former FM position to its current home at 1320 AM. On November 1, 2005, KCTC changed formats, dropping the Music Of Your Life format to become an Air America affiliate after crosstown rival KSAC-1240 AM dropped its Air America affiliation. However, KCTC's website announced on February 15, 2007, that AM 1320 would no longer carry Air America programs, and also would not retain Enid Goldstein or The Morning Retort with Scott and Sims. The site announced that as of Monday, February 26, 2007 KCTC would become ESPN 1320, carrying the complete sports programming of the ESPN radio network. This move would make KCTC Sacramento's first full-time sports radio station. KIFM On April 28, 2016, KCTC changed its callsign to KIFM, former call letters that were used on 98.1 FM in San Diego, as part of a warehousing move by owner Entercom (that station concurrently changed call letters to KXSN as part of a format change).

Bunker Hill was built in 1907 at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for passenger service between Boston and New York City. Bunker Hill and her sister ship Massachusetts were among the eight ships acquired by the U.S. Navy in November 1917. The two coastal passenger steamers were converted to minelayers at the Boston Navy Yard. Service history On 2 October, 1907 the tug was sunk while assisting Bunker Hill when Bunker Hills propeller slashed her hull, in the New York City area. World War I for USS Aroostook‚Äì1918  After a brief shakedown cruise in mid-June 1918, Aroostook took on board a load of mines and then began a voyage across the Atlantic Ocean in the company of her sister minelayer, USS Shawmut. This voyage, aided by the novel technique of refueling at sea, took her to Scotland, where in July she participated in laying the North Sea Mine Barrage, laying thousands of mines across the mouth of the North Sea in order to create a barrier for German U-boats trying to depart from German seaports to the open Atlantic. Aroostook laid a total of 3,180 mines in this operation: * planted 320 mines during the 3rd minelaying excursion on 14 July, * planted 320 mines during the 4th minelaying excursion on 29 July, * planted 290 mines during the 5th minelaying excursion on 8 August, * planted 330 mines during the 6th minelaying excursion on 18 August, * planted 310 mines during the 7th minelaying excursion on 26 August, * planted 290 mines on 30 August to complete the 7th minefield after USS was unable to lay its mines, * planted 320 mines during the 9th minelaying excursion on 20 September, * planted 330 mines during the 10th minelaying excursion on 27 September, * planted 330 mines during the 11th minelaying excursion on 4 October, and * planted 340 mines during the final 13th minelaying excursion on 24 October.Belknap, Reginald Rowan The Yankee mining squadron; or, Laying the North Sea mining barrage (1920) United States Naval Institute p.110 This effort, nearly completed, was the major operation of the U.S. Navy in European waters during World War I, and it came to an end on 11 November 1918 with the Armistice with Germany and the end of fighting in World War I. USS Aroostook steamed home to the East Coast in December 1918 An aircraft tender, 1919‚Äì1931 During the spring of 1919, USS Aroostook was refitted as an \\"aircraft tender\\" to support the attempt by U.S. Navy naval aviators to make the first transatlantic crossing of the Atlantic Ocean by air. The Navy had four huge Curtiss NC floatplanes built for the project. These aircraft were twice the size of contemporary aircraft. The route for this attempt used southeastern Newfoundland and the Portuguese Azores Islands as stopping-off points for refueling and maintenance work on the new planes, and for rest and mess periods for their aviators. In the event of the attempt, mechanical problems and lack of replacement parts necessitated the cannibalization of one of the aircraft, leaving three \\"Nancys\\" for the attempt. Aroostook at Trepassey Bay in May 1919 During the first half of May 1919, Aroostook was waiting at the port of Trepassey, Newfoundland, to serve as a floating base for the three medium-sized Curtiss NC floatplanes that took off from the New York City area on 16 May. After taking care of the Curtiss NCs and their crews, and seeing them off towards the Azores, Aroostook next steamed to England, where she rendezvoused with the NC-4, the only airplane to complete the transatlantic flight, at the end of May. The crewmen of Aroostook then disassembled the NC-4 and loaded her onto the ship for the voyage back to United States. In August and early September, Aroostook carried a cargo of naval mines and supplies to California via the Panama Canal. She spent the rest of the year on the West Coast carrying out transportation missions and also as the aviation flagship for the Pacific Fleet. Though she continued to be classified as a \\"minelayer\\", and she received the warship designation CM-3 (minelayer) in mid-1920, Aroostooks remaining active service was as an aircraft tender. Throughout the 1920s, she mainly served on the Eastern Pacific Ocean, but she made occasional voyages to the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Seaboard to take part in the annual, massive \\"fleet problem\\" exercises. Aroostook also steamed to Hawaii and back in 1925 and 1928, including on the first occasion as the support aircraft tender for a pioneering attempt to fly two patrol planes from the West Coast to Hawaii. Decommissioning and sale, 1931‚Äì1947 Taken out of commission in March 1931 at the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Washington, Aroostook was laid up in reserve for the next decade. With World War II raging in Europe, and the war threatening to spread worldwide soon, she was considered for reactivation as a cargo ship, and in May 1941, she was re-designated AK-44. However, her age and her limited capabilities kept her inactive. In February 1943, Aroostook was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and then transferred to the War Shipping Administration. Regaining the name Bunker Hill, she stayed in port for the rest of the war. Although she was sold in 1947 to a firm headed by Anthony Cornero that planned to use her as a floating casino off of Malibu,Associated Press, \\"Cornero Says His Gambling Ships Will Be Lawful\\", The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Saturday 6 April 1946, Volume 52, page 1. those plans fell through, and the old ship was next seized by the U.S. Government, which sold her for scrapping in October 1947.

They are demersal fish living on or near sand, gravel or clay bottoms at depths of between . The halibut is among the largest teleost (bony) fish in the world, and is an endangered species due to a slow rate of growth and previous overfishing. Halibut are strong swimmers and are able to migrate long distances. Halibut size is not age-specific, but rather tends to follow a cycle related to halibut (and therefore food) abundance. The native habitat of the Atlantic halibut is the temperate and arctic waters of the northern Atlantic, from Labrador and Greenland to Iceland, the Barents Sea and as far south as the Bay of Biscay and Virginia. It is the largest flatfish in the world, reaching lengths of up to and weights of . Its lifespan can reach 50 years. Age can be estimated by counting the rings laid down inside the otolith - a boney structure found inside the inner ear of the fish. Description The Atlantic halibut is a right-eyed flounder. It is flattened sideways and habitually lies on the left side of its body with both eyes migrating to the right side of its head during development. When the larvae are born, they start in the upright position like most other fish having one eye on each side of the head. Once the larvae reach one inch in length, the left eye moves over the snout to the right side of the head. At the same time, the coloring on the left side begins to fade to white while the upper side of the fish is a uniformly dark chocolate, olive or slate color, and can be almost black. The end of the caudal fin is concave. Young fish are paler with more mottled coloration.Atlantic halibut Gulf of Maine Research Institute: Fishery Bulletin (February, 2006) Male adults average about 25 to 30 pounds but can range to upwards of 60 pounds, rarely reaching 100 pounds. Females can get as large as 600 pounds. The official state record halibut was 459 pounds caught in 1996 in Unalaska Bay. Most halibuts that are caught are between 5 to 15 years old. Biology Atlantic Halibut have a relatively slow growth rate and late onset of sexual maturity, with males attaining maturity at seven to eight years old, females at 10 to 11 years, and individuals averagely live around 25 to 30 years old. The oldest to have been caught was 50 years old. The Alaskan Halibut is a batch spawner where females lay anywhere from a few thousand to four million eggs (depending on the size and age of the fish, older females tend to only lay 2 million in one spawning period). Spawning occurs between December to April near the bottom of the ocean between 5-7 degree temperatures. The egg size is around 3.0-3.8mm and the larvae at time of hatching is 6.5mm. Growth weight is dependent on the density, competition, and availability of food. The Alaskan Halibut uses external fertilization where the female and males both release the eggs and sperm into the water and thus are fertilized outside the bodies. The fertilized eggs float freely in the water until they hatch approximately 16 days after fertilization. Adults are benthic but sometimes can be pelagic. Habitat This marine fish usually lives on the ocean floor at depths between , but it occasionally comes closer to the surface. The larvae are pelagic, drifting relatively helplessly, but at around 4 cm, they migrate to the bottom. Young between the ages of two and four years live close to the shore, moving into deeper waters as they grow older.  Geographic distribution  Found in both the eastern and western portions of the North Atlantic. In the western Atlantic, found from southwestern Greenland and Labrador, Canada to Virginia in the USA. They are found in the eastern Atlantic around Iceland, the United Kingdom, and northern Europe to Russia. A map of the Atlantic Halibut's geographic distribution can be found on the Official Website of Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs. This demersal fish is found ranging from the latitude and longitude coordinates: 79¬∞N - 36¬∞N, 77¬∞W - 55¬∞E. Role in ecosystem The Atlantic halibut occupies a relatively high trophic level in the food chain. Diet The diet of the Atlantic halibut consists mainly of other fish, e.g. cod, haddock, herring, pogge, sand eels and capelin, but it will also eat cephalopods, large crustaceans and other benthos organisms. During the first year of their life, halibut mostly feed on plankton. Once they turn 1, they feed on euphausiids and small fish until around age 3. As the halibut grows, the diet mostly consists of other fish including smaller halibut. Predators Atlantic halibut are eaten by seals, and are a staple food of the Greenland shark. Killer whales are also natural predators of the halibut. Commercial fishing of wild Atlantic halibut The wild Atlantic halibut was formerly a very important food fish, but due to its slow rate of population growth, it is unable to recover quickly from overfishing, and the fishery has largely collapsed. Consequently, wild fish labelled as \\"halibut\\" are usually one of the other large flatfishes, including Pacific halibut, Hippoglossus stenolepis. The most popular way to catch the Alaskan halibut is to use circle hooks that are baited with herring or other similar fish, fished from the bottom with cannonball weights of up to 36 ounces on a slider. The survival rate of caught and released halibut is 95 percent due to the lack of having a swim bladder and not severely suffering from changes in water pressure (as long as the captured halibut is in excellent condition). Farming Due to its popularity as a food fish, Atlantic halibut has attracted investment in fish farming. As of 2006, five countries‚ÄîCanada, Norway, the UK, Iceland and Chile‚Äîwere engaged in some form of Atlantic halibut aquaculture production. Conservation status In 1996, the IUCN rated it as Endangered and placed it on its Red List. Downloaded on 26 March 2018. The Atlantic halibut is a US National Marine Fisheries Service Species of Concern, one of those species about which the U.S. Government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has some concerns regarding status and threats, but for which insufficient information is available to indicate a need to list the species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA).Species of Concern NOAA The American Fisheries Society has classified the species as \\"Vulnerable\\". In 2010, Greenpeace International added the Atlantic halibut to its seafood red list of \\"fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries.\\"Greenpeace International Seafood Red list The Atlantic halibut has been on the endangered species list since 1996 due to overfishing since it became commercially important during the 19th century since the great meat demand of the halibut and being one of the largest flatfishes and essentially being easy to capture.

When Baghdad fell to the Mongols in 1258, al-Hakim I escaped to Damascus where he befriended the Arab tribal chief 'Isa ibn al-Muhanna, who tried to set him up as caliph, but in the confusion surrounding the Mongol invasion of Syria in 1259-1260, he ended up in Aleppo, where he was proclaimed. However, the much closer and probably genuine uncle of the last Abbasid caliph al-Musta'sim, Ahmad al-Mustansir, was proclaimed caliph in Cairo in 1261. Al-Hakim I joined Ahmad al-Mustansir's invasion of Iraq, also submitting to al-Mustansir as caliph, but the latter was slain with most of the invaders near Hƒ´t in Iraq by the Mongols. Only about fifty troops escaped with al-Hakim, who, making his way back to Cairo and after a careful scrutiny of his genealogical claim to be an Abbasid, was proclaimed caliph in succession to al-Mustansir in 1262. Since al-Hakim's connection with the Abbasids is distant and faint, it cannot now be known whether he was really from that family as he claimed or not. In any case, al-Hakim I had no further adventures, served as a legitimating and ceremonial functionary for the Mamluk sultans in Cairo, reigned for thirty-nine years, and became the progenitor of all the subsequent Abbasid caliphs of Cairo, whether he was really an Abbasid or not. Although he was kept in office after 1262, the Mamluk sultans kept him as a virtual prisoner in the citadel, until Sultan Lajin released him in December 1296, allowing him to live in a house in the city and giving him a bigger financial emolument.

He was the only Cairo-based caliph to hold political power as Sultan of Egypt, albeit for only six months in 1412. All the other Cairene caliphs who preceded or succeeded him were spiritual heads lacking any temporal power. Life Al-Musta'in was the son of al-Mutawakkil I by a Turkish concubine named Bay Khatun. He succeeded his father as caliph on 22 January 1406. At that point in time, the role of the caliphs had been reduced to legitimizing the rule of the Burji Mamluk sultans through the issuance of certificates of investiture. Al-Musta'in accompanied Sultan Faraj on his campaign in the Levant against the rebel amirs (governors) of Aleppo and Tripoli. Faraj's defeat at Lajjun on 25 April 1412 resulted in anarchy. Al-Musta'in was captured by the rebels, who competed against each other for the sultanate. Unable to choose a candidate from among themselves, the quarreling Mamluks followed the advice of Faraj's infant son Fath Allah, who had suggested appointing al-Musta'in as sultan. After formally removing Faraj from office, al-Musta'in reluctantly accepted the sultanate on 7 May 1412. He agreed to take on the post only after having obtained assurance from the Mamluks that he would retain his position as caliph in the event of his deposition from the sultanate. Faraj surrendered and was sentenced to death. His execution took place on 28 May. The Mamluk realms were divided, with Nawruz al-Hafizi receiving the Syrian provinces and al-Musta'in returning to Egypt accompanied by Shaykh al-Mahmudi and Baktamur Djillik. Al-Musta'in took up his residence at the Cairo Citadel on 12 July. He involved himself in the appointment and removal of ministers, and coins were struck in his name. This signalled his intention to rule as sultan and not to content himself with a figurehead role. Worried by such a prospect, Shaykh started to gradually isolate al-Musta'in, nearly turning him into a state prisoner. Baktamur Djillik's death on 15 September accelerated Shaykh's usurpation of power, which became complete when he had himself recognized as sultan on 6 November 1412, whereupon he assumed the title of al-Mu'ayyad. After long hesitation, al-Musta'in formally abdicated the sultanate, and was held in the Citadel. Having filled his role as interim sultan, he expected to remain as caliph, as had been initially agreed upon. However, he was deposed from the caliphate by Shaykh on 9 March 1414, and replaced by his brother al-Mu'tadid II. Shaykh's dethronement of al- Musta'in was declared unlawful by the ulama. Acting upon this, Nawruz al- Hafizi decided to wage battle against Shaykh. The latter transferred al- Musta'in to Alexandria along with Faraj's three sons on 29 January 1417. According to 15th-century historian al-Suyuti, al-Musta'in remained in the Mediterranean city until the reign of Sultan Sayf ad-Din Tatar, when he was released and allowed to return to Cairo. However, he preferred to stay in Alexandria, where he received considerable sums of money from the merchants. He died there of plague in 1430 at less than 40 years of age. In retrospect, al-Musta'in's short reign as sultan is viewed as a failed attempt at producing an Abbasid revival. In 1455, his brother al-Qa'im equally tried and failed to hold power as sultan. Nevertheless, al-Musta'in's position as caliph was recognized far beyond Egypt's borders, with distant rulers such as Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah of Bengal sending him large sums of money.

Engraving by Theodor de Bry from J.J. Boissard, Icones virorum illustrium doctrina & eruditione praestantium Pope Sixtus IV Appoints Platina Prefect of the Vatican Library, fresco by Melozzo da Forl√¨, c. 1477 (Vatican Museums) Bartolomeo Sacchi (; 1421 - 21 September 1481), known as Platina (in Italian il Platina ) after his birthplace (Piadena), and commonly referred to in English as Bartolomeo Platina, was an Italian Renaissance humanist writer and gastronomist. Platina started his career as a soldier employed by condottieri, before gaining long-term patronage from the Gonzagas, including the young cardinal Francesco, for whom he wrote a family history. He studied under the Byzantine humanist philosopher John Argyropulos in Florence, where he frequented other fellow humanists, as well as members of the ruling Medici family. Around 1462 he moved with Francesco Gonzaga to Rome, where he purchased a post as a papal writer under the humanist Pius II (Enea Silvio Piccolomini) and became a member of the Platonism-influenced Roman Academy founded by Julius Pomponius Laetus. Close acquaintance with the renowned chef Maestro Martino in Rome seems to have provided inspiration for a theoretical treatise on Italian gastronomy entitled De honesta voluptate et valetudine (\\"On honourable pleasure and health\\"), which achieved considerable popularity and has the distinction of being considered the first printed cookbook.Capatti and Montanari, pp. 10-11 Platina's papal employment was abruptly curtailed on the arrival of an anti- humanist pope, Paul II (Pietro Barbo), who had the rebellious Platina locked up in Castel Sant'Angelo during the winter of 1464-65 as a punishment for his remonstrations. In 1468 he was again confined in Castel Sant'Angelo for a further year, where he was interrogated under torture, following accusations of an alleged conspiracy by members of Pomponio's Roman Academy involving plans to assassinate the pope. Platina's fortunes were revived by the return to power of the strongly pro-humanist pope, Sixtus IV (Francesco della Rovere), who in 1475 made him Vatican librarian--an appointment which was depicted in a famous fresco by Melozzo da Forl√¨. He was granted the post after writing an innovative and influential history of the lives of the popes that gives ample space to Roman history and the themes of Antiquity, and concludes by vilifying Platina's nemesis, Paul II.Platina, pp. ix-x Biography Platina was born at Piadena (Platina in Latin), near Cremona.

In 1462 he proceeded to Rome, probably in the suite of Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga. After Pius II had reorganized the College of Abbreviators (1463), and increased the number to seventy, Platina, in May 1464, was elected a member. De honesta voluptate et valetudine Probably in the summer of 1465 Platina composed De honesta voluptate et valetudine (\\"On honourable pleasure and health\\"). This first printed cookbook, a monument of medieval cuisine in Renaissance intellectual trappings,\\"Many of the aspects of medieval Italian eating... are to be found in Master Martino,\\" observes John Dickie, Delizia! The Epic History of the Italians and Their Food, 2008, p. 67. left the press in 1474 and ran into dozens of editions, disseminating Roman ideas about fine dining throughout Western Europe. In a display of humanist learning Platina embedded recipes from the famous chef, Maestro Martino de' Rossi, whom he had met in the summer of 1463 at Albano, where Platina was the guest of Martino's employer, a cardinal. The cookbook also happens to contain the oldest recorded usage of cannabis in cooking. When Paul II abolished the ordinances of Pius, Platina with the other new members was deprived of his office. Angered by this, he wrote a pamphlet insolently demanding from the pope the recall of his restrictions. When called upon to justify himself he answered with insolence and was imprisoned in the Castel Sant'Angelo, being released after four months on condition that he remain at Rome. In February 1468, with about twenty other humanists, he was again imprisoned on suspicion of heresy and of conspiring against the life of the pope. The latter charge was dropped for lack of evidence, while they were acquitted on the former. However, members of the Roman Academy were found guilty of immorality. After his release on July 7, 1469, he expected to be again in the employ of Paul II, who, however, declined his services. Platina threatened vengeance and executed his threat, when at the suggestion of Sixtus IV he wrote his ' (1479). In it he paints his enemy as cruel, and an archenemy of science. For centuries it influenced historical opinions until critical research proved otherwise. In other places party spirit is evident, especially when he treats of the condition of the Church. Notwithstanding, his Lives of the Popes is a work of no small merit, for it is the first systematic handbook of papal history. Platina felt the need of critical research, but shirked the examination of details. By the end of 1474 or the beginning of 1475 Platina offered his manuscript to Pope Sixtus IV; it is still preserved in the Vatican Library. The pope's acceptance may cause surprise, but it is probable he was ignorant of its contents except insofar as it concerned his own pontificate up to November, 1474. After the death of Giovanni Andrea Bussi, Bishop of Aleria, the pope appointed Platina librarian with a yearly salary of 120 ducats and an official residence in the Vatican. He also instructed him to make a collection of the chief privileges of the Roman Church. This collection, whose value is acknowledged by all the annalists, is still preserved in the Vatican archives. In the preface Platina not only avoids any antagonism towards the Church but even refers with approbation to the punishing of heretics and schismatics by the popes, which is the best proof that Sixtus IV, by his marks of favour, had won Platina for the interests of the Church. Besides his principal work Platina wrote several others of smaller importance, notably: '. The Pinacoteca Vaticana contains a famous fresco by Melozzo da Forl√¨ representing Sixtus IV Appointing Platina as Prefect of the Vatican Library. Halley's comet As a paragraph from Platina's Vit√¶ Pontificum first gave rise to the legend of the excommunication of Halley's comet by Pope Callixtus III, we here give the legend briefly, after recalling some historical facts. After the fall of Constantinople (1453), Nicolas V appealed in vain to the Christian princes for a crusade. Callixtus III (1455‚Äì1458), immediately after his succession, sent legates to the various courts for the same purpose; and, meeting with no response, promulgated a bull June 29, 1456, prescribing the following: #all priests were to say during Mass the oratio contra paganos; #daily, between noon and vespers, at the ringing of a bell, everybody had to say three Our Fathers and Hail Marys; #processions were to be held by the clergy and the faithful on the first Sunday of each month, and the priests were to preach on faith, patience, and penance; to expose the cruelty of the Turks, and urge all to pray for their deliverance. The first Sunday of July (July 4), the first processions were held in Rome. On the same day the Turks began to besiege Belgrade. On July 14 the Christians gained a small advantage, and on the twenty-first and twenty-second the Turks were put to flight. In the same year Halley's comet appeared. In Italy it was first seen in June. Towards the end of the month it was still visible for three hours after sunset, causing great excitement everywhere by its extraordinary splendour. It naturally attracted the attention of astrologers as may appear from the long judicium astrologicum by Avogario, of Ferrara, dated June 17, 1467; it was found again by Celoria among the manuscripts of Paolo Toscanelli, who had copied it himself. The comet was seen till July 8. It is evident, from all the documents of that time, that it had disappeared from sight several days before the battle of Belgrade. These two simultaneous facts‚Äìthe publication of the bull and the appearance of the comet‚Äìwere connected by Platina in the following manner: :Apparente deinde per aliquot dies cometa crinito et rubeo: cum mathematici ingentem pestem: charitatem annon√¶: magnam aliquam cladem futuram dicerent: ad avertendam iram Dei Calistus aliquot dierum supplicationes decrevit: ut si quid hominibus immineret, totum id in Thurcos christiani nominis hostes converteret. Mandavit pr√¶terea ut assiduo rogatu Deus flecteretur in meridie campanis signum dari fidelibus omnibus: ut orationibus eos juvarent: qui contra Thurcos continuo dimicabant (A maned and fiery comet appearing for several days, while scientists were predicting a great plague, dearness of food, or some great disaster, Callistus decreed that supplicatory prayers be held for some days to avert the anger of God, so that, if any calamity threatened mankind, it might be entirely diverted against the Turks, the foes of the Christian name. He likewise ordered that the bells be rung at midday as a signal to all the faithful to move God with assiduous petitions and to assist with their prayers those engaged in constant warfare with the Turks). Platina has, generally speaking, recorded the facts truly; but is wrong at one point, viz., where he says that the astrologers' predictions of great calamities induced the pope to prescribe public prayers. The bull does not contain a word on the comet, as can be verified in the original, authenticated document. A careful investigation of the authenticated Regesta of Callixtus (about one hundred folios), in the Vatican archives, shows that the comet is not mentioned in any other papal document. Nor do other writers of the time refer to any such prayers against the comet, though many speak both of the comet and of the prayers against the Turks. The silence of St. Antoninus, Archbishop of Florence (1446‚Äì1459), is particularly significant. In his Chronicorum libri tres he enumerates accurately all the prayers prescribed by Callixtus; he also mentions the comet of 1456 in a chapter entitled, ' ‚Äì but never refers to prayers and processions against the comet, although all papal decrees were sent to him. Aeneas Sylvius and St. John Capistrano, who preached the crusade in Hungary, considered the comet rather as a favourable omen in the war against the Turks. Hence it is clear that Platina has looked wrongly upon the bull as the outcome of fear of comets. The historians of the 16th and 17th centuries contented themselves with quoting Platina more or less accurately (Calvisius 1605, Spondanus 1641, Lubienietski 1666). Fabre (1726) in his continuation of the Histoire Eccl√©siastique by Fleury gave a somewhat free paraphrase. Bruys (1733), an apostate (who afterwards entered the Church again), copies Fleury-Fabre adding que le Pape profita en habile homme de la superstition et de la cr√©dulit√© des peuples. It is only when we come to Laplace's , that we find the expression that the pope ordered the comet and the Turks to be exorcized (conjur√©), which expression we find again in Daru's poem L'Astronomie. Arago (Des Com√®tes en g√©n√©ral etc. Annuaire du Bureau des Longitudes 1832, 244) converts it into an excommunication. Arago's treatise was soon translated into all the European languages after which time the appearance of the comet (1456) is hardly ever mentioned, but this historical lie must be repeated in various shapes. Smyth (Cycle of celestial objects) speaks of a special protest and excommunication exorcizing the Devil, the Turks, and the comet. Grant (History of physical astronomy) refers to the publication of a bull, in which Callixtus anathematized both the Turks and the comet. Babinet (Revue des deux mondes, 23 ann., vol. 4, 1853, 831) has the pope lancer un timide anath√®me sur la com√®te et sur les ennemis de la Chr√©tient√©, whilst in the battle of Belgrade les Fr√®res Mineurs aux premiers rangs, invoquaient l'exorcisme du pape contre la com√®te. In different ways the legend is repeated by Chambers, Flammarion, Draper, Jamin, Dickson White, and others.

It is located in the Hamersley Range within the southeastern part of Karijini National Park in the Pilbara region, approximately from Wittenoom, and from Tom Price. The Pandjima peoples are the traditional owners of the area. The indigenous name for Mount Meharry is Wirlbiwirlbi. History Mount Meharry is named after William Thomas (\\"Tom\\") Meharry (1912-1967), Chief Geodetic Surveyor for Western Australia from 1959 to 1967. It was discovered by Surveyor Trevor Markey and his party in 1967. Tom Meharry directed the survey party and performed the calculations that confirmed the mountain was the highest peak in Western Australia, being higher than Mount Bruce which lies 62 km northwest of Mount Meharry. After Meharry's sudden death on 16 May 1967 the Nomenclature Advisory Committee (now the Geographic Names Committee) recommended to the Minister for Lands that the recently discovered peak be named after him. The Minister for Lands Stewart Bovell approved this on 28 July 1967 and a notice naming the peak was published in the Western Australian Government Gazette on 15 September 1967. In 1999, Gina Rinehart, daughter of Lang Hancock applied to the Geographic Names Committee to rename the mountain after her father. The application was declined and in 2002 she lobbied the then-Premier Geoff Gallop with the same proposal. He too declined the request. Geography The summit of Mt Meharry can be reached from the Great Northern Highway via an unsealed road in length and a vehicular track in length. Permission should be sought from the managers of the land over which the road and track pass. These are Juna Downs Station and the Department of Parks and Wildlife, which manages Karijini National Park. In dry conditions, a two-wheel-drive vehicle can reach the national park boundary at about 800 metres altitude, requiring a walk of about 7 kilometres to the summit.

She was the first known female landowner in the New World. As a wealthy titled woman, she had unusual influence in New Netherland, where she was respected. In the Massachusetts Bay Colony, where she had first settled after leaving England because of persecution as an Anabaptist, she had been described by contemporaries as \\"a dangerous woman\\" and chose excommunication over giving up her beliefs. Biography Deborah Dunch was born in London in 1586, the daughter of Walter Dunch of Avebury Manor in Wiltshire and his wife, also called Deborah. She was the daughter of James Pilkington, Bishop of Durham and his wife. Walter's father was Sir William Dunch, the Auditor of the Royal Mint.Cooper, A Dangerous Woman: New York's First Lady Liberty, Heritage Books, 1995. Deborah married Sir Henry Moody, 1st Baronet. By marriage she was entitled to be addressed as Lady Moody. She was widowed by 1629, after her husband died at age 46. Lady Moody left England in 1639 due to religious persecution, as she had adopted Anabaptist beliefs. At the age of 54, she settled in the town of Saugus, Massachusetts. She moved to a large farm in Swampscott, just outside of Salem. She corresponded with other religious Nonconformists in the area, attracting negative attention from her closest neighbor, Reverend Hugh Peter. Peter believed in religious unity in the Massachusetts Puritan colony. He had already expelled Anne Hutchinson, another Anabaptist woman, two years prior to Moody's arrival. In 1643, Moody was put on trial for allegedly spreading religious dissent. Puritan leader John Endecott described her as a \\"dangerous woman\\", during her trial. The Church told her to change her beliefs or be excommunicated. Moody chose excommunication. She gathered her fellow Anabaptists, and set out once again to find a place where they could peacefully practice their religion. In 1643, Director Willem Kieft of the Dutch West India Company was looking for new settlers to add to the population in New Netherland. He had recently started a war with the local Lenape and wanted more settlers to defend the newly seized land. Lady Moody had money and followers, and accepted the opportunity to create a new community. Since the Netherlands and their colonies had policies of relative religious tolerance, in order to encourage trade, Moody's Anabaptist beliefs presented less of a problem. The Dutch West India Company entrusted Moody with the southwestern tip of Long Island. This includes the areas now known as parts of Bensonhurst, Coney Island, Brighton Beach, and Sheepshead Bay. Moody named her new community Gravesend. Gravesend was the first New World settlement founded by a woman. Moody allowed total religious freedom in Gravesend, as long as it fell within the laws of the colony. As Gravesend prospered, Moody gained influence in the government of New Netherland. She was among the few prominent settlers invited to greet the new Director-General, Peter Stuyvesant, when he arrived in 1647. Stuyvesant called on her to mediate a tax dispute in 1654. In 1655, she was called upon to nominate magistrates for Gravesend. Moody lived in Gravesend until her death in 1659. Today, Gravesend, as its name became known, is part of Brooklyn in New York City, with the original town square still evident in the street layout. It is named Lady Moody Square (see photo) in honor of the founder. In the fall of 2014, Moody was honored for founding the town of Gravesend in \\"Built by Women New York City\\", a competition launched by the Beverly Willis Architecture Foundation. It identified outstanding and diverse sites and spaces designed, engineered and built by women. A memorial was erected to her at Lady Moody Square, named in her honor in Gravesend.

He was a prominent figure of Uganda National Liberation Front/Army that helped remove Idi Amin and was involved in the power struggles that followed. P'Ojok, an ethnic Acholi, was born in Pupwonya, a rural community near Atiak trading centre in Kilak County, Amuru District. During the rule of Idi Amin, p'Ojok fled to Kenya, settling in Nairobi, where he became the chief engineer of the Kenyan Electricity Utility company. Together with Yonna Kanyomozi, Ephraim Kamuntu, Richard Kaijuka and other prominent Ugandans living in exile, p'Ojok founded the Save Uganda Movement (SUM), one of the anti-Idi Amin organizations that subsequently united under the banner of Uganda National Liberation Front (UNLF) with groups having a reciprocal aim who, together with Tanzanian armed forces, removed Idi Amin in 1979. During the Uganda-Tanzania War, p'Ojok was the Vice Chairman of the military coalition that composed to form the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA, the military faction of UNLF) and Tanzania People's Defence Force, which resulted in Amin's overthrow. He later became the Vice President of UNLF, which de facto ruled Uganda immediately after Idi Amin. Akena p'Ojok was chosen to become the President of Uganda after Yusuf Lule (who was President after Idi Amin) however, following The Moshi Conference, Godfrey Binaisa was instead appointed as President. When political parties were being formed in preparation for the 1980 General Elections, p'Ojok vied for leadership of Uganda Patriotic Movement (UPM), but Yoweri Museveni was instead chosen for the post. Akena p'Ojok then joined Uganda People's Congress (UPC), and became Member of Parliament for Gulu West Constituency, having beaten his main competitor, Anthony Ochaya of the Democratic Party. Uganda People's Congress won the elections (which were largely believed to have been rigged). Akena p'Ojok became the Minister of Power Posts and Telecommunications, and later held various positions as Cabinet Minister in the government of UPC's Milton Obote. In 1985, Obote's government was deposed in a coup led by Tito Okello and Bazilio Olara-Okello. In 1986, in the aftermath of the chaos which followed the coup, Yoweri Museveni's National Resistance Army, which had been fighting against Obote's government for six years, seized power. P'Ojok declined several personal offers from Museveni to join his government and in 1987 was arrested and charged with treason for allegedly amassing weapons to overthrow the government. There is no record of his being found guilty of the charges, but he was sent to prison. In 1990 he was released by presidential pardon of Museveni, after which he left Uganda and settled in the United Kingdom. In early 2005 a congregation of Acholi elders approached p'Ojok and asked him to represent the Acholi in Uganda People's Congress, an offer which he declined. Since the 1990s, p'Ojok has lived with his wife and children on the outskirts of London.  Notes  References  * Nyai, Dick. The Origins of the Uganda Luwero War. Pdf Paper Submissions .

Ltd under the supervision of Swiss Engineering Project (SEP) which acted as trustee for the Department of Public and Municipal Works (DPMW).Special supplement of The Nation newspaper - September 24, 1973, p. 12. The main drivers behind the construction of the bridge were: * To alleviate the traffic congestion over and around the Memorial Bridge and to shorten travel time and cut costs * To foster inter- city relations between Bangkok and Thonburi * To facilitate the development in the vicinity of the bridge The Sa-nga Phanit Co., Ltd.

He was a member of the country's mixed-race elite. He used the political climate of World War II to sustain his power and ties to the United States, Haiti's powerful northern neighbor. His administration presided over a period of economic downturn and harsh political repression of dissidents. Early life Lescot was born in Saint-Louis-du-Nord to a middle-class mixed-race family, descended from free persons of color in the colonial era. He traveled to Port-au-Prince to study pharmacy after completing his secondary education in Cap-Ha√Øtien. He settled in Port-de-Paix to work in the export-import business. After his first wife died in 1911, Lescot entered politics. He was elected to the Chamber of Deputies two years later. After a four-year stay in France during the United States occupation of Haiti (1915 to 1934), he returned and held posts in the Louis Borno and St√©nio Vincent administrations. Four years later he was named ambassador to the neighboring Dominican Republic, where he forged an alliance with President Rafael Trujillo. He moved to Washington, D.C., after being appointed as ambassador to the United States. Wartime election His close political and economic ties to the United States helped lay the groundwork for his ascendancy to Haiti's presidency, and he received the State Department's tacit backing for his campaign to succeed St√©nio Vincent in 1941. Prominent members of the Chamber of Deputies opposed his candidacy, arguing Haiti needed a black president from a majority African ancestry. Taking the advantage of Trujillo's influence, Lescot was said to buy his way into power. He won 56 out of 58 votes cast by legislators. Deputy Max Hudicourt claimed the margin of victory was due to intimidation and beatings of legislators. Lescot quickly moved to consolidate his control over the state apparatus, naming himself head of the Military Guard and appointing a clique of white and mixed-race members of the elite to major government posts, including his own sons. This action earned him great disdain among Haiti's large majority of ethnic Africans. Poster from U.S. Office of War Information. Domestic Operations Branch. News Bureau, 1943 After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Lescot declared war on the Axis Powers and pledged all necessary support to the Allied war effort. His government offered refuge to European Jews on Haitian soil in cooperation with Trujillo. In 1942 Lescot claimed the war required the suspension of the constitution and had the parliament give him unlimited executive powers. Political opponents were subject to physical harassment and surveillance by security forces. Failed rubber cultivation program As an Axis blockade cut off rubber supplies from the East, Lescot's administration began an ambitious program, in cooperation with the United States, to expand wartime production of rubber in the Haitian countryside. The Export-Import Bank in Washington granted $5 million in 1941 for the development of rubber plants in Haiti. The program was called the Soci√©t√© Ha√Øtiano-Am√©ricane de D√©veloppement Agricole (SHADA) and managed by American agronomist Thomas Fennell. SHADA began production in 1941 with the provision of ample military support per contract with the US government. By 1943, an estimated were cleared for the planting of cryptostegia vine, which was considered to yield high amounts of latex. The program eventually claimed over 100,000 hectares of land. Farmers in Haiti's northern countryside were lured from food crop cultivation to meet increasing demand for rubber. Lescot energetically campaigned on SHADA's behalf, arguing the program would modernize Haitian agriculture. The United States also promoted the project with a robust public relations campaign. Peasant families were forcibly removed from Haiti's most arable tracts of land. After nearly a million fruit-bearing trees in J√©r√©mie were cut down and peasant houses invaded or razed, the Haitian Minister of Agriculture, Maurice Dartigue, wrote to Fennell asking him to respect \\"the mentality and legitimate interests of the Haitian peasant and city-dwellers.\\" But yields did not meet expectations, and insufficient amounts of rubber were produced to generate significant exports. Droughts contributed to poor harvests. \\"The worst thing that can be said of SHADA is that they are doing [their operations] at considerable expense to the American taxpayer and in a manner that does not command the respect of the Haitian people\\", concluded a survey by the US military. The US government offered $175,000 as compensation to displaced peasants after recommending the program's cancellation. Lescot feared SHADA's termination would add the burden of higher unemployment (at its height it employed over 90,000 people) to a sinking economy and hurt his public image. He asked the Rubber Development Corporation to extend its closing of the program gradually until the end of the war, but was refused. Decline and exile With his government near bankruptcy and struggling with a flagging economy, Lescot pleaded unsuccessfully with the United States for an extension on debt repayments. Relations between Lescot and Trujillo in the Dominican Republic broke down. In Haiti he expanded the corps of the Military Guard, including a core of light-skinned commanding officers. A system of rural police chiefs, known as chefs de section, ruled by force and intimidation. In 1944 low- ranking black soldiers plotting rebellion were caught, and seven of them were executed without court-martial. That same year Lescot extended his presidential term from five years to seven. By 1946, his attempts to muzzle the opposition press sparked fierce student demonstrations; a revolt broke out in Port-au-Prince. Black-empowerment noirists, Marxists, and populist leaders joined forces in opposition. Crowds protested outside the National Palace, workers went on strike, and the homes of authorities were ransacked. Lescot's mulatto-dominated government was highly resented by Haiti's predominately black military Garde. Lescot tried to order the Military Guard to break up the demonstrations, but was rebuffed. Convinced their lives were in danger, Lescot and his cabinet fled into exile. A three-person military junta took power in his place and pledged to organize elections. In the immediate aftermath of Lescot's exile, an independent radio and print press flourished and long- repressed dissident groups expressed optimism about Haiti's future. Dumarsais Estim√© eventually succeeded Lescot as head of the republic, becoming Haiti's first black president since the US occupation. References * Smith, Matthew J.

The deployment started in July 2003. The brigade's name was a reference to Plus Ultra, the national motto of Spain. The battalions of the four Hispanic-American countries were equipped and transported by the U.S. military, and received some specific training in Germany prior to their arrival to the Persian Gulf. The Spaniards were based in Al-QƒÅdisiyyah, and the Central Americans in Najaf, in south-central Iraq, near Dƒ´wƒÅnƒ´yah. Their objective was to relieve the U.S. Marine Corps in the area so that the Marines could be transferred to other, more problematic regions in the country. During their tenure in the region, the Plus Ultra Brigade's troops had few hostile clashes with insurgents. Some of their camps were harassed with RPG and grenade attacks, but there were few casualties. There was only one serious incident, a skirmish with insurgents in early April 2004 in Najaf, which left 1 dead Salvadoran soldier and at least 19 dead Iraqis. The Rules of Engagement that the units followed were very restrictive and the authorization to use deadly force needed high command clearance, due to a directive seeking to \\"avoid or minimize at all costs collateral damage to people or property\\". The Plus Ultra Brigade finally dissolved in April 2004, when the recently elected new Spanish socialist government and the governments of Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, and Honduras decided to withdraw their troops (a decision that somewhat tensed Spanish-American relations). The lack of public support for the deployment and the war in Iraq was cited as the main reason, with Nicaragua, additionally stating its financial constraints. The Salvadoran military had (200) troops in Iraq by December 2008: a reduction of almost half from its original deployment of 380 soldiers. Salvadoran troops were withdrawn in 2009.

During the time of stay, the Spanish and Central American troops had many confrontations with the Iraqi insurgency. One of the most important combats was the Battle of April 4, in the base Al-Andalus in Najaf.  Withdrawal  After the attacks of 11 of March 2004, the 2004 Spanish general election was won by Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who promised the withdrawal of the Spanish troops in Iraq. A new relay was being prepared but was interrupted on April 18 by the government, ordering the return of the force.

The priority of the mission was that the displacements were carried out with maximum security, reason why it became necessary to coordinate the operation with the American forces. The first phase of the withdrawal materialized on April, 26. The last 150 Spanish soldiers from Al Andalus Base in Najaf headed to Spain Base in Diwaniyah, US soldiers occupying positions at the base of Najaf to avoid occupation by militias of the Imam Muqtada al-Sadr Muqtada al Sader. The last 260 Spanish soldiers of the II Plus Ultra Brigade arrived in Kuwait on the afternoon of April 27, thus completing the exit from Iraq of all units. The last boat arrived in the port of Valencia on July 14, 2004, ending the withdrawal of the Spanish contingent, and also of the Central American contingent that retired at the same time, except the troops of El Salvador, who retired in 2009.

Early life Maharero, was born about 1820 at Okahandja. In 1843 he went with his father Tjamuaha to Windhoek to stay with Jonker Afrikaner, Captain of the Oorlam Afrikaners. Tjamuaha was an ally of Jonker Afrikaner until his death in 1861, albeit in a subordinate position. Maharero a leader of Ovaherero community in (1861-1890) was born in ca 1820 at Otjikune near Okahandja and he was the son of Tjamuaha and his chief wife Tjorozumo. He had several brothers and half-brothers, amongst them were Kavezeri, Kariteova, Kavikunua and Rijarua. Like his father, Maharero became an ally of Jonker Afrikaner in 1843. As from 1863 onwards, he refused to accept the dominance of the Afrikaners and was recognized by both Herero‚Äôs and the European in the country as the representative of all the Hereros. Shortly afterwards he emerged as the first Herero paramount chief though his leadership was not uncontested. He sought to consolidate his position by marrying into all the important Hereros families and he apparently had over 60 wives by the time he was old. In 1885 he signed a treaty accepting German protection over the country. When he died on October 5, 1890 a serious dispute about his succession erupted. Maharero‚Äôs brother Kavezeri, who was born in 1845, became custodian of the sacred fire. His other brother Kavikunua, who had already died in 1858, had a son named Nikodemus (Kambahahiza). Owing to Nikodemus powerful personality he had been in a strong position to become paramount chief of Hereroland but had obviously not been successful. As a result, Maharero requested his son Samuel Maharero to succeed as chief of the Hereros living in the east and Ovambanderu under Kahimemua and Tjetjoo. His request was supported by the German governor, who subsequently appointed Nikodemus in his new position. Sadly this brought so many arguments on this leadership style, which finally led to both Nikodemus and Kahimemua being captured and executed in Okahandja in 1896. Herero-Orlam hostilities When Jonker Afrikaner died, he was succeeded by Christian Afrikaner. Due to this, Maharero rebelled against the Afrikaners. They subsequently attacked Maharero's men at Otjimbingwe on 15 June 1863, a battle in which Christian Afrikaner was killed. Christian's successor, Jan Jonker Afrikaner did not want to allow the Hereros to escape from his overlordship, and so hostilities continued for several years. Some traders at Otjimbingwe, notably C.J. Andersson and Frederick Green, considered that the war was bad for trade, and took a hand in organising and leading the Herero army. Green led a force that captured most of the Oorlams cattle, and on 1864-06-22 there was a decisive battle in which Jan Jonker Afrikaner's forces were defeated. Dispensing with the services of the traders, Maharero won more battles, and took control of Damaraland, and even sent his forces into Namaqualand. Eventually in 1870 a peace was brokered by missionary Carl Hugo Hahn of the Rhenish Missionary Society. In the decade that followed, many more white traders entered Damaraland, mostly from the Cape Colony. More serious still were the Boer incursions into the Herero lands from the Boer republics to the east. Maharero complained to the governor of the Cape Colony about Boers entering the eastern part of the territory. The Cape government sent the Palgrave Commission, and later annexed Walvis Bay in 1878, though this was not actually part of Maharero's territory. In 1880 there were renewed hostilities between Maharero and Jan Jonker Afrikaner. What was originally a dispute over grazing escalated into a pogrom against all Nama living in Maharero's territory, and over 200 were killed. One who escaped with his life was Hendrik Witbooi, who thereafter led the opposition to Maharero. Also faced with repeated attacks by the «ÄKhowesin, a subtribe of the Khoikhoi under Hendrik Witbooi, Maharero signed a protection treaty with Imperial Germany's colonial governor G√∂ring on 21 October 1885 but did not cede the land of the Herero. Due to lack of German support against Witbooi Maharero renounced this treaty in 1888 and reopened negotiations with the government of the Cape Colony. But by that time the Scramble for Africa was under way, and the Cape Colony government was powerless to intervene, even if it had wanted to. The European powers had by then recognised South West Africa as a German sphere of influence. Maharero reaffirmed the treaty with the Germans in May 1890. Maharero died on 7 October 1890 in Okahandja. Historian Heinrich Vedder claims that his main wife Kataree poisoned him in order to prevent him from changing his mind on who his successor should be. His eldest son Samuel Maharero succeeded him as chief of the Herero.

There, Alvin Golub, a biochemist and pharmacologist, perfected the product and within one year it reached the national U.S. market. In 1976, the stage magician Harry Blackstone Jr. was endorsing what the television-commercial jingle called \\"the magic treat ‚Äî as much fun to make as it is to eat\\" p. 40 Podojil, John (Jack) Popcorn Favorites Trafford Publishing, 2013. Jiffy Pop was based on a similar product designed five years before by Benjamin Coleman of Berkley, Michigan, and marketed by the Taylor- Reed Corporation as E-Z Pop.Popped Culture: A Social History of Popcorn in America, by Andrew F. Smith, 1999. In the early 1960s, Taylor-Reed sued Mennen Food Products for patent infringement. The district court ruled for the plaintiff, finding Jiffy Pop and E-Z Pop equivalent products, but the case was overturned on appeal. American Home Products spun off its food division, and renamed it International Home Foods, in 1996. In 2000, ConAgra purchased International Home Foods. Original Jiffy Pop packages used a plain, bright aluminum pan. This was eventually replaced by an aluminum pan with a black treatment on the outside to improve heat transfer. Also, although at one time a \\"Natural\\" flavor and a Jiffy Pop Microwave Popcorn version was manufactured, Jiffy Pop is offered in only one stovetop version, Butter Flavor Popcorn. Advertising Jiffy Pop has run television commercials dating back at least to 1967. In one commercial, a genie appears and gives two children Jiffy Pop to eat. The slogan was repeated several times to highlight the fact that Jiffy Pop is \\"as much fun to make as it is to eat\\". It is mentioned in the American musical Heathers by both Veronica Sawyer and Martha Dunnstock at the beginning and end of the musical. It is referenced in the movie chicken little, when chicken little's dad is making jiffy pop popcorn. The brand is briefly shown on the movie Scream; a character played by Drew Barrymore at the beginning of the film is heating the popcorn while she gets a phone call from Ghostface.

The entire length of the river is a protected National Wild and Scenic River. Several portions are in protected wilderness. It is affluent to the Sandy River, a tributary of the Columbia River. Course The overall course is sickle-shaped with the point facing north at Mount Hood and the handle facing west. The headwaters are on the Mount Hood's south face at the foot of Palmer Glacier east of Silcox Hut. The river, which crosses the Pacific Crest Trail at , continues directly southward for a few miles and remains east of Timberline Road. As it descends below , it turns southwest, and continues under Oregon Route 35, elevation , just east of the junction with U.S. Route 26, and crosses under Route 26 as well. The map includes mile markers along the Salmon and Sandy rivers. The West Fork Salmon River begins in the Timberline Lodge ski area under the Pucci chairlift. It flows south-southwest and is joined by natural cold springs at the level, continues south-southwest and crosses under Highway 26 just west of the Highway 35 junction. Just after they cross Highway 26, the West Fork and Salmon River join, and a half mile (1 km) later, the Salmon is joined by the East Fork Salmon River which comes out of a steep valley just north of, and below, Barlow Pass. The combined river flows directly south through Red Top Meadow for about and begins meandering slightly through Salmon River Meadows, elevation . At the south end, the river is joined by Ghost Creek, which enters from the left and turns west-southwest for about before receiving Mud Creek, which flows from Trillium Lake and enters from the right. About downstream from Mud Creek, it receives Fir Tree Creek from the right as it enters the eastern boundary of the Salmon‚ÄìHuckleberry Wilderness. A steep east‚Äìwest gorge captures the Salmon River and collects several creeks‚ÄîWolf from the right; Inch, Draw String, and Linney from the left. The river turns northwest and in the next , flows over a series of six waterfalls ranging from high. These include Stein and Split (before Iron and Swift creeks enter from the left and Kinzel Creek from the right), then Little Niagara (before Goat Creek enters from the right), then Vanishing, Frustration, and Final Falls. Iron Creek, near its confluence with the Salmon River, flows over Hideaway Falls. OGNB Members at Frustration Falls, Salmon River Gorge Salmon River in winter A half mile below Final Falls, Copper Creek joins from the left and, a mile later, Bighorn Creek joins from the left and the river leaves the wilderness area. About later, the South Fork Salmon River‚Äîwhich drains about of rugged mountains northeast of Squaw Mountain‚Äîenters from the left about a mile above Green Canyon Campground. From here the river flows on a comparatively level grade, receiving Cheeney Creek from the left just above Welches. The river then flows roughly parallel to Route 26 past Wemme, then goes through Wildwood Recreation Site near Wildwood. Receiving Boulder Creek from the left, it crosses (again) under Route 26 and merges with the Sandy River near the community of Brightwood. This is upstream of the Sandy's confluence with the Columbia River.  Flora and fauna  The lower canyons have black bear, blacktail deer, cougar, badger, fisher, and marten. Dense western hemlock, Douglas-fir are mixed with western red cedar, red alder, and vine maple. The rare Alaska cedar is found in patches around the Salmon River Meadows. The upper reaches of the river support cutthroat trout. Downstream of the waterfalls, the river has excellent spawning habitat for steelhead, Chinook salmon, and coho salmon. The river is named for the fish (salmon).  Recreation =Boating Whitewater enthusiasts sometimes run a stretch of the lower river that begins downstream of the Salmon‚ÄìHuckleberry Wilderness boundary. The run of \\"fairly continuous class 2 rapids with great wilderness scenery\\" begins at a bridge near a wilderness trailhead and ends at the Arrah- Wanna Road bridge. This stretch of water is rated class II+ to III (intermediate) on the International Scale of River Difficulty. Hazards include logs along the banks and a stretch of boulders ending in a ledge. Expert kayakers have rarely completed runs in the Salmon River gorge further upstream. Oregon Kayaking says, \\"The Salmon River Canyon may just be the Mount Everest of Oregon Kayaking. Huge, marginally portageable waterfalls combined with crumbly, near-vertical canyon walls and questionable rescue possibilities make this a very serious venture indeed.\\" These gorge and waterfall runs have been rated class V to V+ (expert, extreme). Camping Alpine Campground lies to the east of Salmon River about halfway between it and the West Fork. The highest campground in the Mount Hood National Forest, it is near Timberline Lodge and offers access to trails for hiking and mountain biking. It has 16 sites for tent camping. Amenities include picnic tables and potable water. Open from early June through early September, the campground sometimes has snow in mid-summer. Trillium Lake Campground, along Trillium Lake, west of the Salmon River and at the head of one of its tributaries, has more than 50 sites for tents and trailers along a forest road connecting to Route 26 near Government Camp. Amenities include drinking water, picnic tables, toilets, and access to lake and pond fishing, hiking and mountain biking, and non-motorized lake boating. Green Canyon Campground, about by road from Wemme, is along the Salmon River about a mile downstream of the mouth of the South Fork. Open from late May to late September, the campground has sites for tents and recreational vehicles (RV)s, picnic tables, and access to hiking trails and rainbow trout fishing. It has vault toilets but no drinking water. Wildwood Recreation Site is a day-use area along the lower river near Wildwood and Route 26. Overseen by the Bureau of Land Management, the site has a variety of picnic tables, shelters, and kitchens, playing fields and courts, a wetland boardwalk, underwater viewing chamber, and an interpretive trail, as well as access to fishing, swimming, and other trails. Hiking The Salmon River West Trailhead, along Welches Road upstream of Green Canyon Campground, provides access to the Salmon‚ÄìHuckleberry Wilderness via the Salmon River Trail. This trail, long, generally runs along a forested bluff above the north side of the river. At its eastern end, the Salmon River Trail connects to the Pacific Crest Trail via the long Jackpot Meadows Trail. Between the end points, connecting trails such as the long Kinzel Lake Trail, make a variety of hikes possible in combinations.

In the past the German name was Landstra√ü. History The town is protected as a cultural and historical monument. Kostanjevica is the oldest city of the region. In the early 13th century, the Carinthian duke Bernhard von Spanheim established the Fons Sanctae Mariae Cistercian Abbey on the southern frontier of the March of Carniola, which he claimed against the resistance of the Patriarchs of Aquileia and the Dukes of Merania. Kostanjevica Abbey The monastery, a filial of Viktring Abbey near Klagenfurt, was enlarged in a Baroque style in the early 18th century. It was nevertheless finally disbanded in 1785 by the Habsburg emperor Joseph II. The settlement of Kostanjevica was first mentioned as a town in 1210 and received market rights in 1249. During the Late Middle Ages it was an important commercial centre in the Duchy of Carniola held by the Habsburg archdukes of Austria. After several devastations by Ottoman military raids in the 15th and 16th centuries, it lost its importance. After the 17th century, it turned into a mostly rural settlement, which however retained its town status. In 2000, it was recognised by the National Assembly as a city. In 1945, a mass post-war massacre occurred in the Krakovo Forest near Kostanjevica. The Commission on Concealed Mass Graves in Slovenia has discovered a World War II mass grave of victims of the Slovene Partisans.Uz granicu kod Dobove Slovenci otkopavaju kosti 6000 Hrvata, Slobodna Dalmacija Sights A former monastic complex, which was severely damaged in World War II, has been renovated and now houses the Bo≈æidar Jakac Gallery, an art gallery with a sculpture park and a permanent exhibition of works by Bo≈æidar Jakac.

Synopsis A typical teenaged girl obsessed with boy bands who is planning to sneak out and meet up with her friends is treated to the story of Little Red Riding Hood by her babysitting grandmother. She and her brother repeatedly offer suggestions on how to spice up the story. Red lives with her family in a lighthouse by the ocean. One day, Red is set to travel through the woods to her grandmother's house built on an oceanside cliff to bring her soup for her cold. Her mother warns her against using the woods as a shorter route due to the danger of a wolf therein but Red is disbelieving and uses the woods anyway. The wolf spots Red immediately and begins stalking her. When she is mugged by the three Ashleys (modeled after the Three Billy Goats Gruff), the wolf arrives soon after and gobbles them up, discovering Red's iPod in the process. When the wolf (disguised as a man) finally closes in on Red, he is caught in a trap from which he is released by his gullible prey. Before he can devour her, however, he is scared away by the arrival of a stranger on a white horse (with a blunderbuss). Hunter warns Red against traveling the woods as the creature she had released was a werewolf, further explaining that he had eaten his parents. Again, she is disbelieving and does what she wants. Finding herself stranded in the woods, Red calls her brother for help and prays to make it out of the woods safely. Her brother arrives but his help is inadequate and he finds himself stranded with her. The two manage to make it to their grandmother's house, but she has already been eaten and replaced by the wolf. Before he can eat Red, he is distracted by her brother and a chase ensues that nearly ends in Rusty being eaten. Hunter arrives to help but the wolf nearly eats Rusty anyway before Red tosses a silver bullet into his mouth which he swallows. Light begins to pour out from cracks in his body and he explodes, releasing all of the people he had swallowed whole since becoming a werewolf. Amid the happy reunions, the wolf (unharmed) finds the Gypsy Fortune Teller who had cursed him (and was subsequently the first to be eaten) and convinces her to remove the curse. Grandmother's story now ended, she offers to tell the children a sequel and Claire is convinced to stay in rather than sneak out. Although her friends find the idea laughable, Claire finds that if she had gone out, she would not have met the cute pizza delivery boy.

The remains of the victims were found during the construction of the church in the years 1888 - 1891. The new settlement of the territory of ≈†tilbach began in the middle of the 18th century. Upon the end of the revolt and cholera epidemics, the territory inhabited by the ancestors of the village's current inhabitants was mostly migratory from Zamaguria. At the end of the 19th century, people began massively leaving for work in America. Church of the Virgin Mary began to build in 1890, completed with the help of Count Andrassyi in 1891, but without a tower. It was built only in 1927, when the citizens bought a new bell, which was consecrated by the parish priest J√°n Koƒçi≈°.

Her murder inspired Judith Rossner's best-selling 1975 novel Looking for Mr. Goodbar, which was adapted as a 1977 film directed by Richard Brooks and starring Diane Keaton, and its follow-up fact-based semi-sequel for TV, Trackdown: Finding the Goodbar Killer, released six years later in 1983. Quinn's murder also inspired the 1977 account Closing Time: The True Story of the \\"Goodbar\\" Murder by New York Times journalist Lacey Fosburgh. The case was the subject of a Season 3 episode of Investigation Discovery's series A Crime to Remember in 2015 (\\"Last Night Stand\\"). Early life and education Quinn was born in 1944 in the Bronx, to Irish Americans John and Roseann Quinn. She had two brothers, John and Dennis, and a sister, Donna. When Quinn was 11 years old, her family moved to Mine Hill Township, near Dover, New Jersey; her father was an executive with Bell Laboratories in Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey. When she was 13, Quinn spent a year in the hospital after a back operation (due to scoliosis), which left her with a slight limp. Quinn attended Morris Catholic High School in Denville, New Jersey and graduated in 1962. Her yearbook said she was \\"Easy to meet ... nice to know.\\" Quinn enrolled in Newark State Teachers College (now Kean University) and graduated in 1966. Career After graduating, Quinn soon moved to New York City and taught for three years in Newark, New Jersey. In September 1969, she began teaching at St. Joseph's School for the Deaf in the Bronx, where she taught a class of eight eight-year-olds. She voluntarily stayed after school to help the children often, other teachers recalled. \\"The students loved her,\\" a spokesman for the school later said. By May 1972, Quinn had moved into a studio apartment at 253 West 72nd Street in Manhattan. The building had been known as the Hotel West Pierre before being converted to apartments four years earlier. According to her acquaintances and neighbors, Quinn would sit by herself and read at bars on the West Side. Police Captain John M. McMahon later said \\"she was an affable, outgoing, friendly girl. Her friends were rather diverse. She knew teachers and artists and her circle of friends was a very large, interracial group ... She knew an awful lot of people.\\" One friend who later spoke to the media said that Quinn had struck up a conversation with him by revealing that she had been reading his lips and following a conversation at the other end of the bar that she could not otherwise have heard. Alleged double life Quinn reportedly developed a habit of meeting and taking home men. Her next-door neighbor had previously heard screams coming from Quinn's apartment. One time, she intervened and saw a man dashing out of Quinn's apartment yelling obscenities. The neighbor found Quinn disheveled and bruised, with a black eye, sobbing. Quinn had been attending night courses at Hunter College, and by December 1972, had completed about half of the requirements for a master's degree in her specialty of teaching the deaf. Later that month, she attended the faculty Christmas party at St. Joseph's School and a party for the children the next day. Murder The All State Cafe (formerly Tweeds) across the street from Roseann Quinn's apartment building, where she met her killer. (Photo taken 2006) On the evening of New Year's Day 1973, Quinn went across the street from her apartment to a bar named W.M. Tweeds, at 250 West 72nd Street, where she met John Wayne Wilson. Wilson's friend, Geary Guest, had left around 11:00 p.m., before Wilson met Quinn. Wilson and Quinn went to her apartment, where they smoked marijuana and attempted to have intercourse. As Wilson later told his attorney, he was unable to achieve an erection. He claimed that Quinn insulted him and demanded that he leave her apartment, and an argument ensued. After a struggle, Wilson picked up a knife and, according to his police statement, stabbed Quinn 18 times in the neck and abdomen. After the murder, Wilson covered Quinn's body with a bathrobe, showered, and left the apartment. Before leaving, he wiped his fingerprints off the murder weapon, the doorknobs and other surfaces that he had touched. Later that night, Wilson confessed the crime to Guest. Believing that Wilson was fabricating the story in order to get a plane ticket home, Guest gave him enough money to leave town. Wilson first flew to Miami to pick up his wife, Kathy, and they later flew to Indiana. Quinn's body was not discovered until the morning of January 3. The authorities at St. Joseph's School, alarmed that Quinn had neither called nor shown up for work in two days, sent a teacher to her apartment to check up on her. Amedio Gizzi, the building superintendent, let the teacher into the apartment, where they found Quinn's body. Quinn's 25-year-old brother John later identified the body at the morgue. Funeral Quinn's wake was held at Bermingham Funeral Home at 249 S. Main Street, Wharton, New Jersey. Her funeral was held on January 6, 1973, at St. Mary's Church in Wharton, a mile from her family's home in Mine Hill. The funeral mass was led by Quinn's cousin, the Rev. John Waldron of St. Teresa of Avila Church in Brooklyn. She was buried at St. Mary's Cemetery, a quarter of a mile from the church. Investigation and aftermath In the days before DNA evidence, there was little to connect Quinn to her killer. No one at Tweeds knew the identity of the man with whom she had left, nor could they recall his appearance. The crime scene had been effectively sanitized. Desperate to crack a case that had been on the front pages for days, the New York City Police Department (NYPD) released a police sketch that ran in several New York City newspapers on Sunday, January 7, 1973. The sketch was not of the killer, but was that of Wilson's acquaintance Geary Guest. Guest was not sure whether Wilson had committed the murder until he saw Quinn's name in a newspaper article. Fearing that he might be charged as an accessory after the fact, Guest first called his friend Fred Ebb and Ebb's personal assistant, Gary Greenwood. Guest told Ebb and Greenwood that he could not tell them what had happened over the phone, but said that it was the worst thing with which anyone could be involved. He said he was going to California to see them and then hung up. Guest arrived at Ebb's home in Bel Air, Los Angeles the next day and then told Ebb and Greenwood about Wilson and the murder. Guest said that he had been out with Wilson and had left early because he had to go to work in the morning. He said that when he woke up, Wilson had not returned to the apartment, and Guest became worried. Wilson subsequently arrived and confessed the murder to him, and Guest gave him money. Ebb called Guest's therapist, Hadassah, in New York; she said that she would contact an attorney and would call him back as soon as possible. Shortly thereafter, she and the attorney called back; the attorney advised Ebb to put Guest on the first plane back to New York City. He also advised Ebb and Greenwood not to say a word about what Guest had told them. In mid-March, Ebb and Greenwood flew to New York City. It took more than two weeks to convince Guest to talk to the police, as Guest agonized over the fact that his information could send his friend Wilson to prison for life or to death row. Guest's lawyer contacted the police and secured his immunity in exchange for revealing Wilson‚Äôs location. NYPD detectives Patrick Toomey and John Lafferty of the Fourth District Homicide Squad flew to Indiana, where, accompanied by Indianapolis Police Sgt. H. Greg Byrne, they arrested Wilson at his mother's house in Indianapolis. Wilson was brought back to New York and was incarcerated in the Manhattan Detention Complex, known as the Tombs. After spending some weeks in the Tombs, Wilson was sent to Bellevue Hospital Center on April 19 to be tested for childhood brain damage, which his attorney planned to claim as part of an insanity defense. Wilson stayed at Bellevue for several weeks, but the tests were never administered, and he was eventually returned to the Tombs. Although he had been diagnosed as suicidal, the cells for the suicide watch were full, so Wilson was placed in a regular cell on the fourth floor. In May, Wilson got into an argument with a prison guard and threatened to kill himself. The guard taunted him by asking if he wanted sheets to help him commit suicide and later threw bed sheets into his cell. Wilson used those sheets to hang himself on May 5, 1973. An investigation was held into the circumstances of Wilson's death, but no charges were ever filed. In popular culture The case has been depicted (or adapted) several times, including: * Judith Rossner's best- selling novel Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1975), which was adapted as a 1977 film of the same title directed by Richard Brooks and starring Diane Keaton. *Lacey Fosburgh's true-crime, \\"interpretive non-fiction\\" book, Closing Time: The True Story of the \\"Goodbar\\" Murder (1977). *Trackdown: Finding the Goodbar Killer (airdate October 15, 1983), a fact-based CBS-TV movie semi-sequel to the 1977 film, starring George Segal and Shelley Hack; the events mostly followed the storyline of the Looking for Mr. Goodbar film but otherwise claimed no connection with Rossner's novel. *A Carol Burnett Show sketch, \\"Is She Alone?\\" (Season 11, Episode 12, originally broadcast on December 11, 1977), starring Burnett, Rock Hudson, and Tim Conway, has Hudson unsuccessfully trying to pick up an unpredictable Burnett in a bar. Conway enters at the end of the sketch; upon being asked his name by Burnett, he replies, \\"Goodbar. You can just... yeah, call me Mr. Goodbar.\\" Burnett's response, ending the piece, is: \\"I've been looking for you.\\" *The Saturday Night Live Season 3 parody sketch \\"Looking for Mr. Goodbar Sleepytime Playset\\" (broadcast on March 11, 1978) features Gilda Radner as a little girl in a commercial for the playset and an announcer who explains that she will not win until she is killed. Radner then makes up her own rules of play and destroys the playset. *The music video for Madonna's single \\"Bad Girl\\" (1993), loosely inspired by the book and film version of the case, features Madonna as a chain-smoking, heavy-drinking executive with a penchant for sexual encounters with random anonymous men, which ultimately leads to her being murdered by a shady low-life who strangles her to death with her pantyhose. *The Law and Order: SVU Season 2 episode \\"Secrets\\" (original airdate February 2, 2001) is based on the case. *The case is profiled in Episode 303 (\\"Last Night Stand\\") of the Investigation Discovery docudrama television series A Crime to Remember (original airdate November 17, 2015).

He has become an actor with a fan base and cult-following around the world. He has played dozens of major characters on television, most notably in the Science Fiction and Fantasy genres. His career in the world of voice-over and performance capture is extensive with multiple performance capture roles in films, TV shows and videogames and numerous voice-overs in animations and commercials. He lives in Los Angeles, California.  Career  He graduated from high school in 1994 and went on to obtain a diploma of college studies in theater from Dawson College in Montreal in 2000. In 2001 he moved to New York City. After a little over a year and a handful of off-on Broadway and fringe festival plays, he returned to Montreal, broke. He played Roger, the second lead role in the Canadian science fiction comedy film Decoys. The film was not successful but it gave him enough money to move to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and pursue acting there. Elias acted in small roles at first, eventually playing Morton in the made-for- television film The Five People You Meet In Heaven based on a book by Mitch Albom, in which he worked alongside Jon Voight, Michael Imperioli and Jeff Daniels. He then played Webber in a popular episode of Supernatural. Webber was an \\"evil twin with mind control powers\\" and it was a very well liked (or disliked) character. He followed that with his second appearance on Smallville (the first was a one line walk on) as the character Bronson, who could travel between radio frequencies and kidnaps Lex Luthor. His third character on Smallville was Emil Lasalle, a.k.a. Warp, a member of the Suicide Squad from DC Comics. He has since played the \\"villain of the week\\" on shows like Criminal Minds, The Listener, Painkiller Jane, Flashpoint, Flash Gordon, Stargate Atlantis, Lost Girl, and Houdini & Doyle. One of his most popular projects is his work on The Expanse where he played two major characters. In season one he played the role of Kenzo Gabriel, the spy that joins the crew of the Rocinante. In season two he played, by performance capture, the role of the Hybrid creature or \\"The Seventh Man\\". He started his video game voice-over and performance capture career in 2006 with Need for Speed: Carbon. He has since worked on multiple video games including an extensive amount of performance capture. His two most popular characters are Andriy Kobin and Adam Jensen.

Adam Jensen is the main character in Deus Ex: Human Revolution; Toufexis' wife Michelle Boback had a major supporting role in this game as scientist Megan Reed. Elias has publicly stated that he is a fan of the Deus Ex series, particularly the Deus Ex released in 2000. Toufexis was cast to play as the protagonist of Far Cry 3, Jason Brody. However, he was replaced by another voice actor Gianpaolo Venuta after he worked on the role for two years, as the publisher of the game did not want players to confuse Brody with Jensen. He played the lead role in Far Cry Primal, a spin-off of the Far Cry series. Toufexis reprised his role as Jensen in Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, a sequel to Human Revolution. On February 28, 2018, Toufexis announced on Twitter that he was voicing a character in the new BattleTech video game by Harebrained Schemes, stating that he had sought out a role and was accepted.

It is sometimes incorrectly referred to as \\"Tiezhi Island\\" (); () refers to another area 7.5 km northeast of this island. The modern Chinese name of the island was taken from one of the battleships named Chung-yeh (), sent by the Chinese government during the Republic of China era to regain control of the island in 1946. History=Early and colonial history There are historical records of the island having been inhabited, at various times in history, by fishermen from Champa in present-day Vietnam and the Chinese, and during the Second World War by French Indochina and Imperial Japanese troops. From 1930 to 1933, the French colonial government in French Indochina sent naval troops to the Spratlys, including Thitu Island. On 21 December 1933, Gouverneur M. J. Krautheimer in Cochinchina (now Vietnam) decided to annex the Spratlys to B√† R·ªãa Province. Post-independence history Occupation and Establishment of civilian administration = On 22 May 1963, the Republic of Vietnam Navy a sovereignty stele on Thitu Island by crew members of the three vessels Huong Giang, Chi Lang and Ky Hoa of the South Vietnam. There were no large settlements on the island until 1956, when a Filipino lawyer- businessman-adventurer named Tomas Cloma decided to \\"claim\\" a part of the Spratly islands as his own, naming it the \\"Free Territory of Freedomland\\". On April 18, 1971, due to a strong typhoon hitting Thitu Island (Zhongye Island), the Republic of China (Taiwan) authorities ordered all the garrisons on Zhongye Island to withdraw to Taiping Island to avoid typhoons. However, after the typhoon, the Taiwan side changed its defense, transferred the original troops back to Taiwan, and then used the landing ship to transport new troops to Zhongye Island. The Philippines saw this empty space and organized the troops to land on the island occupied by Taiwan on July 29 and renamed the island \\"Pag-asa Island\\". According to the 155th page of the second episode of \\"The Land Salary\\" published by the Taiwan Marine Corps Command, the Taiwan Navy detachment that arrived at Zhongye Island on the same day found that the Philippine Marine Corps was on the island, and Captain Hao Deyun immediately ordered the command. The 76mm gun was ready to be fired. The Philippine army on the island is a huge threat to Taiwanese forces, as a result they suddenly received an order from above: no challenge, the troops changed to Taiping Island. These Taiwanese Kuomintang officers and men had to watch the Zhongye Island fall back into the hands of the Philippines. The Philippines formally established the Municipality of Kalayaan on Pag-asa island on 11 June 1978, by virtue of Presidential Decree 1596 series of 1978. =Rejection of Chinese claim by Permanent Court of Arbitration = In January 2014, the Chinese media reported the ambitions of China to reclaim the island as its own. After Permanent Court of Arbitration rejected China's claims on the South China Sea in 2016 and ruled in favor of Philippines, in August 2017 China sent a contingent of naval vessels to the immediate vicinity of Thitu Island, including two frigates, one Coast Guard vessel, and two large fishing vessels.

Only this island among all Philippine-occupied Spratly islands is currently inhabited by Filipino civilians. The civilian population of about 300, which includes children, was introduced in 2001.Glionna, John M.

Development plans Philippine Navy has since 1999 proposed to create a long causeway leading to a deep-water region. The island has a white sand coastline, is filled with trees, and is a sanctuary of several species of sea birds. Its wide coral base makes for good diving. Senator Sonny Angara filed a bill on 27 August 2016 that aims to promote the island as an ecotourism zone. In 2017, approximately 1.6 billion pesos was allocated to the island's development, for projects including a desalination plant, a port, and runway repairs. Newly repaired naval and air ports will enable the delivery of construction materials and essential supplies to improve living conditions, and construction of desalination plant, renewable energy power source, cold storage facility, and fish port.

It calls upon the academic disciplines of history, anthropology, religious studies, political science, Thai language, Thai literature, musicology and the physical sciences such as geology. The first organisation to sponsor and promote Thai Studies was the Siam Society, established in 1904. The Siam Society and the affiliated Siamese Heritage Protection Trust maintain an extensive library of Thai studies materials and exhibits. The Journal of the Siam Society (JSS) is a peer-reviewed academic journal. Open access to PDF copies of all issues back to 1904 is available online. The Center for Thai Studies at Chulalongkorn University is a Thai studies center. The Thailand Information Center (TIC) at Chulalongkorn's main library maintains a repository of research materials for Thai studies. Cornell University was the first active center for Thai studies in the United States. In 1947, Lauriston Sharp began the Cornell-Thailand Project, an initiative to collate baseline data in a comprehensive study of what was then a farming village on the outskirts of Bangkok, now Tambon Bang Chan () in Bangkok's Khlong Sam Wa District (). Outside Thailand, a group of young, active academics at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) promoted Thai studies as a research discipline in social studies. The inaugural open-access Thai Studies Journal was launched at RMIT in 2011. RMIT hosted three Thai studies conferences in 2001, 2011, and 2014.

It is located just to the west of the northern part of Dangerous Ground, and is southeast of Philippine-occupied Thitu Island (Pag-asa) and north-northeast of Taiwan-occupied Itu Aba Island. The island is administered by the Philippines as part of Kalayaan, Palawan. Kota is a Philippine word for a fort. The island is also claimed by the People's Republic of China, the Republic of China (Taiwan) and Vietnam. Environment The island fringes the Loaita Bank, shoals and reefs. Its calcarenite outcrop is visible along its western side at low tide. The present shape of the island indicates sand buildup along its eastern side. The anchor- shaped side will eventually connect with the northern portion as the sand buildup continues, thereby creating another mini-lagoon in the process. The presence of migrating sea birds adds to the high phosphorus content of the island's sand. Occasionally, giant sea turtles lay their eggs on the island. The island is covered with mangrove bushes, above which rise coconut palms and other small trees. History On 22 May 1963, a sovereignty stele was rebuilt on Loaita Island by crew members of the three vessels Huong Giang, Chi Lang and Ky Hoa of the South Vietnam. Several Philippine soldiers have been stationed on the island since 1968 when the Philippines occupied it. There are only a few structures, which serve as shelters for the soldiers. The soldiers also guard the nearby Lankiam Cay (Panata) which lies about to the east- northeast. The cay is under observation from a tall structure on the island, and the Philippine soldiers also regularly visit it. Loaita Nan and Loaita Cay (Melchora Aquino), which are distinct from Kota, lie northwest and east- northeast. These are unoccupied features, but are also largely controlled by the Philippines.

The object is to catch falling rocks with a controllable set of paddles that diminish in number and size as the rocks fall faster and faster. The concept gained a much wider audience after Activision released an unauthorized adaptation in 1981 as Kaboom! for the Atari 2600. The only official home port of Avalanche is for the Atari 8-bit family. Gameplay Avalanche is for 1 or 2 players, alternating turns. There are six rows of rocks at the top of the screen. The game starts with a six-storied platform and the player loses one platform per row of rocks cleared. The player scores points for those rocks they prevent from reaching the ground. The farther the row of rocks, the smaller and faster they become. The ultimate goal is to get enough points so that the player can continue the game should they lose their first one. Development According to the manual for the Atari home computer version, Avalanche started out as a game about eggs and baskets called Catch. The game tested poorly, but was better received when the theme was changed to falling rocks. Avalanche is housed in a custom cabinet that includes two large lit start buttons and a rotary controller. The side art and bezel feature groupings of rocks with extending lines meant to convey the motion of falling rocks. The screen is black and white with two colored strips to provide colored rows of graphics as in Breakout. The circuit board is based on the 6502 CPU, with game code stored in multiple ROMs. All game text is selectable to 4 different languages: English, French, German, or Spanish. Avalanche also includes a built-in self-test diagnostic program that displays all microprocessor and memory functions, including all operator switches and functions. Ports Dennis Koble's official port of Avalanche for the Atari 8-bit computers was published through the Atari Program Exchange in 1981 instead of official Atari channels. It requires the paddle controller. Legacy Avalanche inspired many similar games including Kaboom! by Activision, Lost Luggage, and Eggomania, all for the Atari 2600. Chicken for the Atari 8-bit family and Popcorn for the TRS-80 Color Computer are others.

Directed by V√≠ctor Garc√≠a and written by William Massa, the film stars Amanda Righetti, Tom Riley, Cerina Vincent and Erik Palladino. The film follows Ariel Wolfe - younger sister of Sara Wolfe, a character from the previous film - being forced by a group of people to search for a mysterious idol hidden inside an abandoned and haunted psychiatric asylum. Plot Ariel Wolfe (Amanda Righetti) is the sister of Sara Wolfe, a survivor of a birthday event eight years ago in the Vannacutt Psychiatric Institute for the Criminally Insane, which at that time had been first abandoned and later converted into a private residence‚Äî but has since been abandoned yet again. In the 1930s, the asylum was overseen by the sadistic psychiatrist Dr. Richard B. Vannacutt (Jeffrey Combs). Sara claimed that ghosts of the house residents killed the party guests, and later commits suicide. Ariel and her friend Paul (Tom Riley) are kidnapped by an art dealer, Desmond Niles (Erik Palladino). Ariel realises that Sara didn't commit suicide: Desmond killed her. Desmond forces Ariel to help him find an artifact located inside the old Vannacutt Psychiatric Institute, a figurine of the demon Baphomet. Inside the building, they encounter Dr. Richard Hammer (Steven Pacey) and his assistants Kyle (Andrew-Lee Potts) and Michelle (Cerina Vincent). Ariel explains that the building has been rigged to keep everyone inside for at least 12 hours. The group splits up to search for the idol. Desmond's henchmen are killed by the inmate ghosts, having visions of the patients there suffering the same deaths as them. A ghost shows Ariel the depravity the inmates suffered under Dr. Vannacutt. These images reveal that Vannacutt was driven mad by the idol, and performed experiments on the mentally ill. The inmates led a revolt against Vannacutt, during which the sanatorium burned down. (The audience is shown footage from the 1999 film House on Haunted Hill.) The deaths in the previous film were assumed to be caused by the ghosts. But now Ariel is shown that the dead are actually forced by the idol to do Vannacutt's bidding and did not willingly kill. Although the 12 hours are up, the master locking mechanism begins to lock the house down again. Ariel escapes but discovers that Paul has entered into the house to look for her, and goes back inside. Convinced Michelle wants the idol for herself, Desmond attempts to kill her. Michelle however is killed by Vannacutt. The rest of the group discovers a way out of the asylum but it is blocked by iron bars. The ghost of an inmate shows Ariel that the idol is in the asylum's basement crematorium. Ariel, Paul, and Dr. Hammer descend to the crematorium and discover the \\"heart of the house,\\" composed of living flesh. Ariel tries to destroy the idol but it is indestructible. She then reasons that if it is flushed down the sewer and leaves the building, the spirits will be freed. The team is ambushed by Desmond, who wants the idol. The ghosts seize Desmond and burn him alive after he has a vision about a patient dying a similar death. Dr. Hammer is overcome by the idol's evil and tries to strangle Ariel. The ghost of Vannacutt and inmates appear, Vannacutt hoping one of them will die in the fight. Hammer recovers his senses, but Dr. Vannacutt kills him. Ariel throws the idol into the sewer. The spirits vanish, and several attack Dr. Vannacutt, tearing him apart. The building comes unsealed and Ariel and Paul leave. In a post-credits scene, a man and woman are about to have sex on a beach. The woman feels something under the sand. They dig, and pull the Baphomet idol into the light.

The pumpkin bomb had a similar size and weight distribution as the Fat Man plutonium bomb, giving it the same ballistic and handling characteristics. Specifications for the bomb required that it be carried in the forward bomb bay of a Silverplate B-29 bomber and be fuzed to be effective against actual targets. Pumpkin bombs were produced in both inert and high-explosive variants. The inert versions were filled with a cement-plaster-sand mixture that was combined with water to , the density of the Composition B high-explosive versions. The filler of both variants had the same weight and weight distribution as the inner spherical \\"physics package\\" of the Fat Man plutonium bomb. The concept for the high- explosive pumpkin bomb was originated in December 1944 by U.S. Navy Captain William S. Parsons, the head of the Ordnance Division at Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, and United States Army Air Forces Lieutenant Colonel Paul W. Tibbets, commander of the 509th Composite Group. Prior testing was carried out with an inert version. The name \\"pumpkin bomb\\" originated with Parsons and Dr. Charles C. Lauritsen of the California Institute of Technology, who managed the development team. The name was used for the training bombs in official meetings and documents, and probably derived from its large ellipsoidal shape. On the other hand, anecdotal sources attribute the naming of the bombs to a pumpkin color: While the bombs were painted olive drab or khaki in the field, photographs show that at least the units delivered to Tinian were shipped in the same yellow zinc chromate primer color worn by Fat Man. While many Manhattan scientists expected that the development of the means of delivery of the atomic bomb would be straightforward, Parsons, with his experience of the proximity fuze program, expected that it would involve considerable effort. The test program was initiated on 13 August 1943 at the Naval Proving Ground in Dahlgren, Virginia, where a scale model of the Fat Man plutonium bomb was developed. On 3 March 1944, testing moved to Muroc Army Air Field, California. The initial tests demonstrated that the Fat Man assembly was unstable in flight, and that its fuzes did not work properly.  Production  The shells of the pumpkin bomb were manufactured by two Los Angeles firms, Consolidated Steel Corporation and Western Pipe and Steel Company, while the California Parachute tail assembly was produced by Centerline Company of Detroit. After initial development, management of the program was turned over to the U.S. Navy Bureau of Ordnance in May 1945. A total of 486 live and inert training bombs were eventually delivered, at a cost of between $1,000 and $2,000 apiece. All of the inert versions went from the manufacturers directly to Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, by rail, where they were used by the 216th Base Unit in flight testing of the bomb. Some test drop missions were flown by the 509th Composite Group's 393d Bombardment Squadron as training exercises. The bombs intended as live ordnance were shipped to the Naval Ammunition Depot, McAlester, Oklahoma, for filling with explosives. The Composition B was poured as a slurry, solidified in a drying facility for 36 hours, sealed, and shipped by railroad to the Port Chicago Naval Magazine, California, for shipment by sea to Tinian. Description The pumpkin bombs were externally similar to the Fat Man bomb in size and shape, and both had the same California Parachute square tail assembly and single- point attachment lug. The pumpkin bomb had three contact fuzes arranged in an equilateral triangle around the nose of the bomb while the atomic bomb had four fuse housings. The atomic bomb had its shell sections bolted together and sealed with externally-applied, sprayed-on liquid asphalt, but most if not all of the pumpkin bombs were welded, with a four-inch hole used for filling the shell. The Fat Man also had four external mounting points for radar antennas which the pumpkin bombs did not have. The pumpkin bombs were in length and in maximum diameter. They weighed , consisting of for the shell, for the tail assembly, and of Composition B filler. The shells were made of steel plate and the tail assemblies from aluminum plate. Combat missions Combat missions were flown by the 509th Composite Group on 20, 23, 26 and 29 July and 8 and 14 August 1945, using the bombs against individual targets in Japanese cities. A total of 49 bombs were dropped on 14 targets, one bomb was jettisoned into the ocean, and two were aboard aircraft that aborted their missions. Mission parameters and protocols were similar to those of the actual atomic bomb missions, and all targets were located in the vicinity of the cities designated for atomic attack. The bombs were released at an altitude of and the aircraft then went into the sharp turn required on a nuclear mission. After the war, the Strategic Bombing Survey concluded that the pumpkin bombs were \\"a reasonably effective weapon against Japanese plants when direct hits were scored on vital areas, or when the near miss was sufficiently close to important buildings to cause severe structural damage.\\" NotesReferences World War II aerial bombs of the United States History of the Manhattan Project Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Nuclear warfare ","title":"Pumpkin bomb"},{"id":"6343685","text":"Iriaka Matiu RƒÅtana (n√©e Te Rio; 25 February 1905 - 21 December 1981) was a New Zealand politician and RƒÅtana morehu who won the Western Maori electorate for Labour in 1949. She succeeded her husband Matiu RƒÅtana to become the first woman to represent Maori in the New Zealand parliament. She held the electorate until her retirement in 1969. Early life An entertainer from an early age, she was a member of the RƒÅtana haka, poi, and waiata groups and travelled with them throughout New Zealand and overseas. In 1925, she married Tahup≈çtiki Wiremu RƒÅtana to become his second wife and had two children. Hamuera, the oldest died from tuberculosis in 1934, and the second, Raniera Te Aohou Ratana later became head of the RƒÅtana church. Following her husband's death in 1939, RƒÅtana married Matiu RƒÅtana, a son of T. W. RƒÅtana. The couple farmed until the death in 1945 of Matiu's elder brother, Haami Tokouru RƒÅtana who was Member of Parliament (MP) for the MƒÅori seat of Western Maori. Matiu RƒÅtana was elected in the 1945 election and held the seat until his accidental death in 1949. Political career Iriaka RƒÅtana's decision to stand for parliament was opposed by those supporting traditional leadership roles, with Te Puea Herangi speaking out against her claim to \\"captain the Tainui canoe\\". Only the strong backing of the RƒÅtana church and her threat to stand as a RƒÅtana Independent secured her the Labour Party nomination. She won the Western Maori electorate for Labour in the 1949 general election. She succeeded her husband Matiu Ratana to become the first woman to represent Maori in the New Zealand parliament. She got a similar majority (6317) to her husband in 1946 (his majority was 6491), but no less than seven independent candidates stood against her; they got 116 to 326 votes each. She held the electorate until her retirement in 1969. As an MP Iriaka RƒÅtana was concerned with welfare issues for Maori. She worked hard to improve living standards, particularly at the church settlement of RƒÅtana pƒÅ. Iriaka RƒÅtana was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to the MƒÅori people in the 1971 New Year Honours.

On the site of the former palace is the state-owned Parc de Saint-Cloud. The ch√¢teau was expanded by Phillipe of France, Duke of Orl√©ans in the 17th century, and by Marie Antoinette in the 1780s. After occupation by Napoleon I and Napoleon III, it was destroyed in 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War.  History = H√¥tel d'Aulnay The H√¥tel d'Aulnay on the site was expanded into a ch√¢teau in the 16th century by the Gondi banking family. The Gondis stemmed from a family of Florentine bankers established at Lyon in the first years of the 16th century, who had arrived at the court of France in 1543 in the train of Catherine de' Medici. In the 1570s, the Queen offered J√©r√¥me de Gondi a dwelling at Saint-Cloud, the H√¥tel d'Aulnay, which became the nucleus of the ch√¢teau with a right-angled wing that looked out on a terrace. The main front faced south, with a wing that terminated in a pavilion affording a handsome view over the Seine river. Henry III of France installed himself in this house in order to conduct the siege of Paris during the Wars of Religion, was assassinated there by the monk Jacques Cl√©ment.  17th century  View of a design for Saint-Cloud After the death of J√©r√¥me de Gondi in 1604, his son Jean-Baptiste II de Gondi sold the ch√¢teau to Jean de Bueil, comte de Sancerre, who died shortly afterward. The ch√¢teau was bought back by Jean- Fran√ßois de Gondi, archbishop of Paris. His embellishment notably included gardens by Thomas Francine. After the death of Jean-Fran√ßois de Gondi in 1654, the ch√¢teau was inherited by Philippe-Emmanuel de Gondi and then by his nephew Henri de Gondi, known as the Duke of Retz. The latter sold the property in 1655 to Barth√©lemy Hervart, a banker of German extraction who was intendant then surintendant des finances. He enlarged the park to 12 hectares and did considerable rebuilding. He built a grande cascade (not the present one) in the park. Garden details that seem to be of this phase of Saint-Cloud were drawn by Isra√´l Silvestre.Two views of the Grotte, a centrally-planned domed tempietto surrounded by rills of flowing water strictly contained within the stone curbs; a view of the Grand Jet d'eau, all engraved by Adam Perelle. It was built in Italian style, with an invisibly flat roof and frescoed fa√ßades. Its gardens descended in a series of terraces to the Seine, with fountains at each level. On 8 October 1658, Hervart organised a sumptuous feast at Saint- Cloud in honour of the young Louis XIV, his brother, \\"Monsieur\\", Philippe of France, Duke of Orl√©ans, their mother Anne of Austria and Cardinal Mazarin. On 25 October, Monsieur bought the ch√¢teau and its grounds for 240,000 livres. It appears that Mazarin pressed the sale, contributing to a policy of building a network of royal ch√¢teaux to the west of Paris and relieving the excessively enriched Hervart from the fate of Nicolas Fouquet, whose f√™te at Vaux-le- Vicomte precipitated his fall and imprisonment. Monsieur was engaged in building operations at Saint-Cloud until his death in 1701. The works were designed and constructed by his architect Antoine Le Pautre, who built the wings in 1677. The ch√¢teau as it was reconstructed for Monsieur took the form of a \\"U\\" open to the east, towards the Seine, with the Gondi ch√¢teau, which had faced south, integrated into its left wing. To the rear, a long orangery formed a wing that prolonged the right wing of the court.It was frescoed by Jacques Rousseau. The entrance avenue, bordered by dependencies, some of which survive, arrived on an angle from the bridge. Inside, the apartment of \\"Madame\\", Princess Henrietta of England, in the left wing was decorated by Jean Nocret in 1660, and the 45-metre Galerie d'Apollon, which occupied the whole of the right wing, was decorated with myths of Apollo by Pierre Mignard (finished in 1680). The last child of Philippe and Henrietta was born here in 1669 and named Anne Marie d'Orl√©ans. She was the maternal grandmother of Louis XV of France. The ch√¢teau was the site of the 1670 death of Princess Henrietta, for whose funeral Jacques-B√©nigne Bossuet composed the oration. The Grotto at Saint-Cloud, by Isra√´l Silvestre. In October 1677, five days of magnificent feasts in Louis XIV's honour inaugurated the new decorations and demonstrated the splendour of Monsieur's m√©nage.\\"Thus it preceded the undertaking of the Grande Galerie at Versailles, instead of following it as writers on Saint-Cloud have supposed.\\" (Kimball 1943, 20n. The Galerie was preceded and followed by a salon at either end, a measure to be taken up at Versailles, where Louis found himself outdone in the matter of magnificent galleries, both by his brother and by his mistress in the Ch√¢teau de Clagny,Kimball 1943 p40. and set out in 1678 to build the Galerie at Versailles. Following Le Pautre's death in 1679, the work was continued by his executive assistant Jean Girard, a master mason rather than a full-fledged architect, and perhaps by Thomas Gobert. Jules Hardouin Mansart intervened towards the end of the century, designing a grand stair in the left wing in the manner of the Ambassadors' Staircase at Versailles.It was eliminated in the late eighteenth century. Andr√© Le N√¥tre replanned the gardens, and the park took on the dimensions it retains today. The Grande Cascade, constructed by Le Pautre in 1664-65, has survived. Hardouin-Mansart added the basin and the lowermost canal in 1698. A total of 156,000 livres is estimated to have been spent over the years.  18th century  Saint-Cloud descended in the family of Monsieur's heirs, the Dukes of Orl√©ans, and remained in their hands for most of the 18th century. After protracted negotiations, the ch√¢teau de Saint-Cloud was bought in 1785 by Louis XVI for Marie Antoinette, who was convinced that the air there would be good for her children. Louis Philippe d'Orl√©ans, Duke of Orl√©ans, who had not visited the ch√¢teau since his morganatic marriage with Madame de Montesson, was induced to part with it for 6,000,000 livres. After the sale of the palace was officially finished, Marie Antoinette set about transforming her new private home. She set to transforming Saint-Cloud in 1787-88 by her preferred architect Richard Mique, who enlarged the corps de logis and the adjacent half of the right wing; he rebuilt the garden front. Hardouin-Mansart's staircase was demolished in favour of new stone stairs leading into the state apartments. The ch√¢teau was at first refurnished from the Garde Meuble with furnishings collected from other royal residences, but soon furniture was commissioned for Saint-Cloud. Gilded chairs and marquetry commodes with gilt-bronze mounts in the richest Louis XVI style were being delivered to Saint-Cloud right up to the opening days of the French Revolution. In 1790, Saint-Cloud was the setting for the famous interview between Marie Antoinette and Mirabeau. The ch√¢teau was declared a bien national and emptied by the Revolutionary sales. The Saint- Cloud orangery was the setting for the coup d'√©tat of 18 Brumaire (10 November 1799), in which the Directoire was suppressed and the Consulat declared. Napol√©on Bonaparte was proclaimed Emperor of the French on 18 May 1804 at Saint-Cloud. Saint-Cloud was later used by Bonaparte's family and was their main seat along with the Palais des Tuileries in Paris.  19th century  The ruins in 1871 Napoleon made Saint-Cloud his preferred residence and transformed the Salon de V√©nus to a throne room, which Saint-Cloud had naturally lacked, but neither he nor the occupants to follow did much more to Saint-Cloud than interior decoration. When the Prussians captured it in 1814, they supposedly found Altdorfer's The Battle of Alexander at Issus hanging in the Emperor's bathroom. It was at Saint-Cloud once again, in Monsieur's Galerie d'Apollon, that Napol√©on III invested himself as Emperor of the French on 1 December 1852. During the Second Empire, Napol√©on III and empress Eug√©nie held court at Saint-Cloud in the spring and the autumn. Napol√©on III had the orangery demolished in 1862, and Eug√©nie transformed the bedroom of Madame into a salon in Louis XVI style. At Saint-Cloud, Napol√©on III declared war on Prussia on 28 July 1870. The heights dominating Paris were occupied by the Prussians during the siege of Paris, who shelled Paris from the grounds of the ch√¢teau. Counter-fire from the French hit the building, and it caught fire and burned out on 13 October 1870. Much of its contents had been removed by Eug√©nie after war was declared. The burnt-out shell. The standing roofless walls were finally razed in 1891. The pediment of the ch√¢teau's right wing, one of the preserved parts of the building, was bought by Ferdinand I of Bulgaria and integrated in his palace Euxinograd on the Black Sea coast. Today, only a few outbuildings and its park of 460 hectares remain, constituting the Domaine national de Saint-Cloud. It includes the garden √† la fran√ßaise designed by Le N√¥tre, Marie Antoinette's flower garden (where roses for the French state are grown), a garden √† l'anglaise from the 1820s (the Trocad√©ro garden), ten fountains, and a viewpoint of Paris known as \\"la lanterne\\", because a lantern was lit there when Napol√©on I was in residence. The Pavillon de Breteuil in the park has been the home of the General Conference on Weights and Measures since 1875.  20th century  thumb The sculpture group France crowning Art and Industry was installed in the lower part of the park in 1900. Many thousands of trees in the park were knocked down or badly damaged in a storm on 26 December 1999, but restoration work continues.  21st century  The park has been the venue for the Rock en Seine festival since 2003.  Rebuilding the Ch√¢teau de Saint-Cloud  Since December 2006 there has been a movement to reconstruct the ch√¢teau de Saint- Cloud, chiefly led by an association and aiming at a primarily privately financed project rather than a government one. The association, \\"Reconstruisons Saint-Cloud !\\" or \\"Reconstruct Saint-Cloud !\\", was created in 2006 and aims to fund the rebuilding by imposing a fee on visitors.

He was the father of five children including Hermann G√∂ring, the Nazi leader and commander of the Luftwaffe. Personal life G√∂ring was born in Emmerich am Rhein. He was the son of Wilhelm G√∂ring (1791‚Äì1874), and his wife Caroline Maria de Neree (1815‚Äì1901).

G√∂ring's first action was to gain a 'protection treaty' with the leading Herero chief, Maharero. The treaty of protection wasn't worth the paper it was written on, as G√∂ring was in no position to offer assistance. Repeated, successful armed attacks by the Nama clan of Hendrik Witbooi proved the point. The treaty was torn up a few years later anyway by Mahrero, who also expelled G√∂ring from Hereroland: the behaviour of the Germans had become too much and, worst of all, G√∂ring had‚Äîperhaps unwittingly‚Äîextended his house on top of a Herero ancestral graveyard. The gold rush was a hoax, however, for the purported gold deposits were nothing apart from the remains of gold pieces fired at a rock face. The identity of the hoaxer remains a mystery, but suspicion falls on G√∂ring making a last-ditch, desperate attempt to bring investment into the protectorate, and thus save his failing mission. The expected vast gold deposits started a gold rush of German settlers and investors into South West Africa, whose behaviour further alienated the Herero. This eventually led to the Herero and Namaqua genocide. Herero skulls were eventually used by the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics, pursuing a policy of eugenics.

They generally are small flies (length 7 mm or less) with large compound eyes that often are brightly coloured in life, sometimes with characteristic horizontal stripes, such as in Cestrotus species. Many species have variegated patterns on their wings, but in contrast they generally do not have variegated bodies, except for genera such as Cestrotus, whose camouflage mimics lichens or the texture of granitic rocks. Some 1800 species of Lauxaniidae have been described and they comprise some 126 genera. The family has a cosmopolitan distribution, most of the species occurring in tropical regions of Asia and the Americas; relatively few species occur in Afrotropical regions, and Lauxaniid species diversity declines strongly towards the more temperate regions; for example fewer than 200 European species have been described. Most species inhabit forests, where the adults usually are found sitting on leaves of the understory. They are far less common in open country, such as grassland habitats. Morphological details of Lauxaniidae Description For terms, see Morphology of Diptera Lauxaniidae are small flies (2‚Äì7 mm in length). They are often rather plump, dull, or partly lustrous flies. The body colour varies from yellow to brown or black, or with a combination of these colours. The head is variable in shape, the face projecting or retreating, convex, flat or concave, usually without oral vibrissae (sometimes poorly developed, occasionally strong bristles near the vibrissal angle). The postvertical bristles converge (in rare cases parallel). The frons is wide, with two pairs of frontal bristles, the upper pair of which is always reclinate, the lower pair sometimes decussate. Interfrontal bristles are absent. The ocellar bristles are present or minute. The antennae are variable and the arista is plumose, pubescent to bare. The thorax has bristles, at least behind the suture. The scutellum is usually bare except for the marginal bristles. Propleural bristles are present or absent and one or two sternopleural bristles are seen. Tibiae all have a preapical bristle. The wings are marked or unmarked (in a number of species with spots along the veins). The wing venation is complete and the costa is continuous. The subcosta is entire and ends in the costa. The second basal and anal cells are short and the apical cell usually widely open. The abdomen is oval, rarely elongated. Biology The larvae are mostly saprophagous, feeding in leaf litter, soil, bird nests, etc. Larvae of some mine fallen leaves, others live in rotten wood, and some cause deformation of the flowers and pistils of violets.

Oppenauer oxidation reaction scheme The reaction is the opposite Meerwein‚ÄìPonndorf‚ÄìVerley reduction. The alcohol is oxidized with aluminium isopropoxide in excess acetone. This shifts the equilibrium toward the product side. The oxidation is highly selective for secondary alcohols and does not oxidize other sensitive functional groups such as amines and sulfides. Though primary alcohols can be oxidized under Oppenauer conditions, primary alcohols are seldom oxidized by this method due to the competing aldol condensation of aldehyde products. The Oppenauer oxidation is still used for the oxidation of acid labile substrates. The method has been largely displaced by oxidation methods based on chromates (e.g. pyridinium chlorochromate) or dimethyl sulfoxide (e.g. Swern oxidation) or Dess‚ÄìMartin oxidation due to its use of relatively mild and non-toxic reagents (e.g. the reaction is run in acetone/benzene mixtures). The Oppenauer oxidation is commonly used in various industrial processes such as the synthesis of steroids, hormones, alkaloids, terpenes, etc. Mechanism :Oppenauer oxidation mechanism In the first step of this mechanism, the alcohol (1) coordinates to the aluminium to form a complex (3), which then, in the second step, gets deprotonated by an alkoxide ion (4) to generate an alkoxide intermediate (5). In the third step, both the oxidant acetone (7) and the substrate alcohol are bound to the aluminium. The acetone is coordinated to the aluminium which activates it for the hydride transfer from the alkoxide. The aluminium-catalyzed hydride shift from the Œ±-carbon of the alcohol to the carbonyl carbon of acetone proceeds over a six-membered transition state (8). The desired ketone (9) is formed after the hydride transfer. Advantages An advantage of the Oppenauer oxidation is its use of relatively inexpensive and non-toxic reagents. Reaction conditions are mild and gentle since the substrates are generally heated in acetone/benzene mixtures. Another advantage of the Oppenauer oxidation which makes it unique to other oxidation methods such as pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) and Dess‚ÄìMartin periodinane is that secondary alcohols are oxidized much faster than primary alcohols, thus chemoselectivity can be achieved. Furthermore, there is no over oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids as opposed to another oxidation methods such the Jones oxidation. Modifications=Wettstein-Oppenauer reaction In the Wettstein-Oppenauer reaction, discovered by Wettstein in 1945, Œî 5‚Äì3Œ≤-hydroxy steroids are oxidized to Œî 4,6-3-ketosteroids with benzoquinone as the hydrogen acceptor. This reaction is useful in that it affords a one-step preparation of Œî 4,6-3-ketosteroids. :Wettstein-Oppenauer reaction Woodward modification In the Woodward modification, Woodward substituted potassium tert-butoxide for the aluminium alkoxide. The Woodward modification of the Oppenauer oxidation, also called the Oppenauer‚ÄìWoodward oxidation, is used when certain alcohol groups do not oxidize under the standard Oppenauer reaction conditions. For example, Woodward used potassium tert-butoxide and benzophenone for the oxidation of quinine to quininone, as the traditional aluminium catalytic system failed to oxidize quinine due to the complex formed by coordination of the Lewis-basic nitrogen to the aluminium centre. :Woodward modication  Other modifications  Several modified aluminium alkoxide catalysts have been also reported. For example, a highly active aluminium catalyst was reported by Maruoka and co- workers which was utilized in the oxidation of carveol to carvone (a member of a family of chemicals called terpenoids) in excellent yield (94%). :An Oppenauer oxidation modication In another modification the catalyst is trimethylaluminium and the aldehyde 3-nitrobenzaldehyde is used as the oxidant, for example, in the oxidation of isoborneol to camphor. :An Oppeneaur oxidation modification Synthetic applications The Oppenauer oxidation is used to prepare analgesics in the pharmaceutical industry such as morphine and codeine. For instance, codeinone is prepared by the Oppenauer oxidation of codeine. :An Oppeneaur oxidation of codeine The Oppenauer oxidation is also used to synthesize hormones. Progesterone is prepared by the Oppenauer oxidation of pregnenolone. :An Oppeneaur oxidation of pregnenolone A slight variation of the Oppenauer oxidation is also used to synthesize steroid derivatives. For example, an efficient catalytic version of the Oppenauer oxidation which employs a ruthenium catalyst has been developed for the oxidation of 5-unsaturated 3Œ≤-hydroxy steroids to the corresponding 4-en-3-one derivative. :An Oppeneaur oxidation of pregnenolone The Oppenauer oxidation is also used in the synthesis of lactones from 1,4 and 1,5 diols. :An Oppeneaur oxidation of diol Side reactions A common side-reaction of the Oppenauer oxidation is the base-catalyzed aldol condensation of aldehyde product, which have Œ±-hydrogens to form either √ü-hydroxy aldehydes or Œ±, √ü-unsaturated aldehydes. : An Oppeneaur oxidation of aldehyde Another side reaction is the Tischenko reaction of aldehyde products with no Œ±-hydrogen, but this can be prevented by use of anhydrous solvents. Another general side reaction is the migration of the double bond during the oxidation of allylic alcohol substrates. Oppenauer oxidation of a steroid derivative.

Quillen College of Medicine is a medical school and a part of East Tennessee State University, which is located in Johnson City, Tennessee. It is one of two public medical schools in Tennessee, the other being the University of Tennessee College of Medicine at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis. It was named for Congressman Jimmy Quillen, who led the fight to open a second public medical school in Tennessee. The school was originally named the ETSU Quillen-Dishner College of Medicine, but Dr. Paul Dishner's name was removed in 1989. In the 2011 edition of U.S. News & World Report's \\"America's Best Graduate Schools,\\" the James H. Quillen College of Medicine at East Tennessee State University is ranked sixth in the nation for excellence in rural medicine education. For several consecutive years, ETSU has been ranked within the top 10 schools in the country for rural medicine. Additionally, Quillen College of Medicine at East Tennessee State University was recognized in the 2011 edition of U.S. News & World Report's \\"America's Best Graduate Schools\\" for ranking 20th in the nation for family medicine education. Quillen has also been recognized by the American Academy of Family Physicians as one of the top 10 schools in the nation for producing family physicians. ETSU was also ranked in the top 25% of medical schools for primary care education by U.S. News & World Report. A study published in the June 15, 2010 edition of Annals of Internal Medicine by a professor of health policy, Fitzhugh Mullan, ranked East Tennessee State University‚Äôs James H.

Robinson, ETSU Dean of Health John Lamb, Johnson City attorney Mark Hicks, then Speaker of the House Ned McWherter, newspaper publisher Carl Jones, State Senator Marshall Nave, State Representative Gwen Fleming, Johnson City Physician Dr. Charles Ed Allen, and State Representative Bob Good. A 1971 study by the Tennessee Higher Education Commission concluded that it was not cost effective to have a medical school in Northeast Tennessee. This study was supported by the Tennessee Board of Regents. Shortly afterward, a new process for starting the school became available. Jimmy Quillen In April 1971, U.S. Congressman Olin Teague of Texas introduced a bill to create five medical schools in conjunction with established VA hospitals. Senator Alan Cranston of California introduced a companion bill. Known as the Teague-Cranston Act, the proposal called for the creation of five new medical schools in five states to meet the needs of the medically underserved areas of the country. Congressman Quillen claimed to have introduced an amendment, which required that any university to be considered for acceptance into this pilot program must be on government property contiguous and adjacent to a VA hospital, as East Tennessee State University was adjacent to the Mountain Home VA Hospital.\\"Story of ETSU medical school's founding not always in agreement with facts\\" Kingsport Times-News, October 4, 1993. Tom McGhee The bill passed without a dissenting vote in October 1972, and was signed by President Richard Nixon. The act, as passed, required that the new schools be \\"located in proximity to, and operated in conjunction with, Veterans' Administration medical facilities.\\" In Tennessee, Senator Nave called for consideration of legislation to establish a medical school at ETSU in the Senate on February 14, 1974 which was approved. Four days later, the bill failed to pass in the House. Representatives Robinson and Good used their political influence, and the measure was passed on second attempt on February 28. The bill was presented to Governor Winfield Dunn of Memphis, who vetoed it as expected. Motions to override the veto were made by Senator Nave and Representative Robinson in their respective houses. The Senate overrode with an 18-13 vote on March 6, and the House followed suit on March 12, 1974.Williams, p. 253 The next step was qualifying for the federal funds under the Teague-Cranston Act, with Quillen working with the State Board of Regents Chancellor Roy Nicks and President Culp on the application, which was approved by the Veterans Administration on July 11, 1974. On June 30, 1977, Dr. Culp's last day in office as the President of ETSU, the Liaison Committee on Medical Education issued a letter of reasonable assurance that the new medical school would be accredited. The first class of 24 students (out of 255 applicants) enrolled in September 1978.Williams, pp 253-4 Full accreditation was granted when that first class graduated in 1982.Frank B. Williams, Jr., Quillen College of Medicine. Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture version 2.0, 2011. Retrieved: 9 August 2011. The political fight for the school continued to reverberate through Tennessee politics. Quillen never forgave former Republican Governor Winfield Dunn for his opposition, and when Dunn ran for a second term in 1986, Quillen saw that Dunn's Republican support in East Tennessee was weak.Williams, p 330 Democrat Ned McWherter then won the election by a large margin.

He died on December 16, 2017, two days after taking medical leave from CSX. He is known for introducing precision scheduled railroading to the companies he ran, which resulted in lower costs and improved efficiency. Biography Born in Memphis, Tennessee in 1944, Harrison began his railroad career in 1964 when he worked as a carman-oiler for the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway (\\"Frisco\\"), while attending Memphis State University. Harrison was later promoted to railroad operator with Frisco and, later, with Burlington Northern Railroad (BN) following that company's acquisition of Frisco in 1980. Harrison was consistently promoted at BN, eventually being appointed Vice-President - Transportation as well as Vice-President - Service Design. Harrison left the BN in 1989 and secured a job with the executive team at the Illinois Central Railroad (IC), first as Vice-President and Chief Operating Officer, culminating with his appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer from 1993 to 1998. Following the acquisition of IC by CN in 1998, Harrison was appointed Vice-President and Chief Operating Officer by CN. Upon the retirement of Paul Tellier, he was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of CN on January 1, 2003, serving in that position until his retirement on December 31, 2009. During his time at CN, Harrison was named Railroader of the Year for 2002 by industry trade journal Railway Age as well as CEO of the Year for 2007 by The Globe and Mail's \\"Report on Business\\". On April 29, 2009, CN announced the company's plan for succession in Harrison's position by appointing Claude Mongeau as his successor effective January 1, 2010. Following his service at CN, Harrison retired to his estate in Connecticut where he raised and trained horses for show jumping. Bound by a non-competition clause with CN, Harrison maintained a low profile serving as a director for the Belt Railway of Chicago as well as Dynegy Holdings LLC. In fall 2011, Harrison was approached by the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management led by activist investor Bill Ackman, who was undertaking a proxy battle with the board of directors of CPR. Ackman had offered at that time to appoint Harrison as President and Chief Executive Officer of CPR should his proxy battle in spring 2012 be successful, which would necessarily result in the termination of Fred Green as President and CEO. Ackman was ultimately successful in the proxy battle at the CPR's annual shareholder meeting on May 17, 2012.‚ÄòHigh probability‚Äô ex-CNR head would take CP helm\\", Financial Post; accessed April 27, 2014. On June 29, 2012, Harrison was appointed President and CEO of CPR.\\"As Harrison takes CP‚Äôs top job, Ackman's coup is complete\\", The Globe and Mail; accessed April 27, 2014. CN halted nearly $40-million in benefits to be paid to Harrison after launching a lawsuit alleging he may have breached, or intended to breach, several confidentiality agreements with the railway dating back to his retirement in 2009. In the suit, CN's board of directors said it had grounds to believe Harrison may have violated his commitments to CN as part of push by activist shareholder William Ackman and his New York-based hedge fund, Pershing Capital Management LLC, to see Harrison replace Fred Green as CEO of rival CPR Ltd. On January 18, 2017, Harrison abruptly resigned as CEO of CPR Ltd. Instead, he joined Paul Hilal in involving himself in the management of CSX Corp., a US competitor. On March 7, 2017, Harrison was named CEO of CSX. Harrison died on December 16, 2017 due to severe complications from a recent illness, two days after taking medical leave from CSX. He was 73 and survived by his wife, Jeannie, and two daughters, Elizabeth (Libby) Julo and Cayce Judge.

Origins of the term=mSign The term first appeared in articles introducing mSign (short for Mobile Electronic Signature Consortium). It was founded in 1999 and comprised 35 member companies. In October 2000, the consortium published an XML-interface defining a protocol allowing service providers to obtain a mobile (digital) signature from a mobile phone subscriber. In 2001, mSign gained industry-wide coverage when it came apparent that Brokat (one of the founding companies) also obtained a process patent in Germany for using the mobile phone to generate digital signatures. ETSI-MSS standardization The term was then used by Paul Gibson (G&D;) and Romary Dupuis (France Telecom) in their standardisation work at the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and published in ETSI Technical Report TR 102 203. The ETSI-MSS specifications define a SOAP interface and mobile signature roaming for systems implementing mobile signature services. ETSI TS 102 204, and ETSI TS 102 207. Today The mobile signature can have the legal equivalent of your own wet signature, hence the term \\"Mobile Ink\\", commercial term coined by Swiss Sicap. Other terms include \\"Mobile ID\\" by Valimo Wireless, \\"Mobile Certificate\\" by a circle of trust of 3 Finnish mobile network operators implementing a roaming mobile signature framework Mobiilivarmenne, etc. According to the EU directives for electronic signatures the mobile signature can have the same level of protection as the handwritten signature if all components in the signature creation chain are appropriately certified. The governing standard for the mobile signature creation devices and equivalent of a handwritten signature is described in the Commission Decision 2003/511/EC of 14 July 2003 on the publication of reference numbers of generally recognised standards for electronic signature products in accordance with the Electronic Signatures Directive. If the signature solution is Common Criteria evaluated by an independent party and given the EAL4+ designation, the solution can produce what the EU directive and consequent clarifications are calling a qualified electronic signature. The current standard dates back to the year 2002/2003 and is in the process being renewed and published by the end of 2012. Most, if not all, mobile signature implementations to date generate what the EU Directive is calling advanced electronic signature. The most successful mobile signature solutions can be found in Turkey,http://www.valimo.com/news_and_events/15-10-2008/valimo-boosts-mobile- signature-usage-turkey Lithuania, Estonia and Finland with millions of users. Technically the mobile signature is created by a security module when a request for it reaches the device (SIM card) and after introducing the request to the user with a few explanation prompts, the device asks for a secret code that only the correct user should know. Usually, this is in form of a PIN. If the access control secret was entered correctly, the device is approved with access to secret data containing for example RSA private key, which is then used to do the signature or other operations that the request wanted. The PKI system associates the public key counterpart of the secret key held at the secure device with a set of attributes contained in a structure called digital certificate. The choice of the registration procedure details during the definition of the attributes included in this digital certificate can be used to produce different levels of identity assurance. Anything from anonymous but specific to high-standard real-word identity. By doing a signature, the secure device owner can claim that identity. Thus, the mobile signature is a unique feature for: * Proving your real-world identity to third parties without face- to-face communications * Making a legally-binding commitment by sending a confirmed message to another party * Solve security problems of the online world with identity confirmation (an anonymous but specific identity is often equally good as a high-standards identity)  Public services  Estonian Mobile-ID = See . = Mobile Ink (Finland) = Mobile Ink unites high security and user-friendly access to digital services which require strong authentication and authorization. Subscribers can get mobile signature access to m-banking or corporate applications for example. Mobile Ink is a commercial term associated with the mobile signature solution of Sicap building on Kiuru MSSP platform by Methics Oy.Methics Oy The platform allows simultaneous existence of multiple keys and associated identities with distinct registration procedures. This is used for example as a replacement for RSA SecureID dongles with anonymous but specific identity in corporate access applications. = Mobiilivarmenne (Finland) = Mobile Certificate i.e. Mobiilivarmenne in Finnish is a term used in the Finnish market space to describe the roaming mobile signature solution deployed by the three mobile network operators Elisa, Sonera, and DNA. This setup was developed in all three operators co-operation under national Telecom technology coordination group FiCom, and it is world's first system where a fully functional co- operating ETSI TS 102 207 roaming service mesh was established in multi-vendor software environment. Another national feature is that mobile phone numbers are portable across the operators, and thus the phone number prefix does not identify the operator. To make things easy for the Application Providers (see ETSI TS 102 204), they can purchase service from any one of the Acquiring Entity service providers (mobile network operators), and reach all users. Part of the background was update of national laws allowing digital Person Identity Certificates (for Mobiilivarmenne use) to be issued also by other parties than official registration authorities via Police offices. Another part was co- operation agreement between the operators on the form of the certificates, and certification procedures and practices producing similar certificate contents with similar identity issuance traceability. All of these were reviewed and approved by the Finnish Communication Regulatory Authority which tasks include the oversight of the identity registration services also at government registries. The MSSP software vendors in the service mesh are Methics Oy, and Valimo Wireless. Both Finnish companies. = Mobile ID in Ukraine = In Ukraine, Mobile ID project started in 2015, and later declared as one of Government of Ukraine priorities supported by EU.

It was provided bei mobilkom Austria, but ended in 2007. After a relaunch in 2009, named Handy-Signatur, it is well used, by 2014 over 300.000 people, 5% of the adult inhabitants, own a registered mobile signature. It is controlled by Austrian Government, National Bank and Graz University of Technology. It is based on a TAN sent bei SMS on request and confirmed with a private PIN.Das kann die Handy-Signatur, www.buergerkarte.at; Die B√ºrgerkarte, digitales.oesterreich.gv.at According to 1999/93/EG signing by Handy-Signature is completely equivalent to a handwritten autograph.  Technology providers  Mobile ID = Valimo Wireless, a Gemalto company, was the first company in the world to introduce mobile signature solutions into the market and creating the term Mobile ID. The initial mobile signature solution in Turkey by Turkcell used Valimo technology to implement the very successful mobile signature solution. Currently Valimo Mobile ID is in use in several countries. = Kiuru MSSP = Methics Oy is a privately held Finnish technology company with strong expertise on PKI and MSSP services. The Kiuru MSSP product line is used directly and as OEM product by several service and solution providers. = ID HUB ‚Äì Mobile ID = Mobile ID platform by Innovation Development HUB LLC is the only electronic identification and mobile signature solution, having already passed State certification in Ukraine. Uses both post-Soviet and European cryptography algorithms, which makes the platform suitable for CIS and EU PKI. = G&D; SmartTrust = G&D; SmartTrust is the original supplier of SIM card embedded WAP browsers with encryption plugins developed in late 1990es, it is called WIB (Wireless Internet Browser.) The WIB technology is licensed by the SmartTrust to many SIM card manufacturers, and the mobile network operators can choose to use cards with WIB capabilities in their normal user base immediately enabling them for use of the MSSP services. SmartTrust's MSSP offering is called SmartLicentio.  Security issues  Authentication may still be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and trojan horses, depending on the scheme employed. Schemes like one-time-password- generators and two-factor authentication does not completely solve man in the middle attacks on an open network like the Internet. However, supporting the authentication on the Internet with a parallel closed network like mobile/GSM and a digital signature enabled SIM card is the most secure method today against the man in the middle attack. If application provider provides a detailed explanation of the transaction to be signed both on its Internet site and signing request to mobile operator, the attack can easily be recognized by the individual by comparing both screens. Since mobile operators do not let applications to send signing request for free, normally the cost and technicality of intrusion between the application provider and the mobile operator makes it an improbable attack target. Very least there are trace evidences in multiple places for the attack to have happened. With on-board key generation When a mobile user creates the sPIN (signing PIN) and secret key online within the secure SIM card during the registration process, this is known as \\"on-board key generation\\". This requires a bit more interaction on user's behalf while registering, but on the other hand it makes the security mode interaction process familiar and lets them practice service usage. Also when the user forgets/locks the PIN associated with generated key, it is simple to generate a new key and assign it a new sPIN destroying the previous versions using same process as with original registration, and most importantly: without need for replacement of the SIM card. In these systems there is commonly no secondary signing PIN unblocking code (sPUK) at all, because revelation of such a code has identical requirements for the requesting person's identity verification as was with original person's identity registration. Compare this with older \\"factory generated keys\\" model for older technology SIM cards that had insufficient processing power to do on-board key generation. The SIM card factory ran key-generation with special hardware accelerator and stored the key material on card along with initial sPIN and sPUK codes. Sometimes actual generation happened within the SIM card that was running in special manufacturing mode. After the generation the capability of doing it at all was usually disabled by blowing a special control fuse. Delivery of in particular the sPUK codes creates considerable security information logistics problems, which can entirely be avoided with the use of on-board key generation. Turkcell was the first provider to roll out a mobile signature service with \\"On Board Key Generation\\" functionality, which enables customers to create their signing and validation key pair, after they get the simcard. In this way GSM operators do not need to distribute signing PINs to customers. Customers can create their sPIN anew, on their own. Turkcell.com In introduction of the Finnish Mobiilivarmenne service in 2010, only one out of three operators chose to use this on-board key generation capability with user interaction. Cited reasons claimed it to be too hard for the user. Actual experience did show that those without it created easily non- functional registrations without any online indication of the status, while usage of on-board key generation always resulted in positive indication of success when the service became fully functional for the user. Also if a mobile phone version had issues with SIM Application Toolkit protocol, that became evident immediately during a registration process using on-board key generation.

Also called downtown Beirut,. it has been described the ‚Äúvibrant financial, commercial, and administrative hub of the country.‚Äù It is thousands of years old, traditionally a focus of business, finance, culture and leisure. It is situated on the city's northern coast and is easily accessible from all parts of the city. This includes the adjacent Beirut Seaport and Rafik Hariri International Airport. Major roads converge on it or from boundaries to the east, south and west, or line its long seafront to the north. After the city center was destroyed by the Lebanese Civil War, it underwent thorough reconstruction and development, which restored its cultural and economic position in the region. A master plan for reconstructing the city was officially approved by the Lebanese Government in March 1994 after a series of detailed studies alongside public and professional seminars. On May 5, 1994, Solidere, The Lebanese company for the development and reconstruction of the Beirut Central District was formed, launching the largest urban redevelopment project of the 1990s. Ever since, Beirut Central District has evolved into an integrated business and commercial environment.

Culture and heritage projects=Heritage Trail Ruins in the Roman Baths Garden The Hamidiyi Clock-tower The Heritage trail is a pedestrian circuit in the city's historic core and the traditional Beirut city center. The trail connects the main archaeological sites, places of historic interest, monuments and heritage buildings which are important to Beirut's rich past. The trail's path is marked by bronze medallions grouted into the sidewalk, with large general or district panels and smaller monument panels made from glazed lava stone tiles with texts in three languages (Arabic, French, English). The Heritage Trail is planned to start and end at the \\"City History Museum\\" on the ancient Tell Area. In an initial phase, pending the completion of the museum, the circuit will start at Beirut Souks, which retain the 2500-year-old ancient street grid and Ottoman access gates, and several other archaeological remains like the Phoenician-Persian quarter, Byzantine mosaics, old city wall and moat. The trail is divided into four major sections: * First Route: The first route in the heritage trail covers the ancient archaeological \\"Tell Area\\". This site receives special treatment and much attention due to its significant historical importance, integrating several neighboring vestiges: preserved part of the Canaanite wall and gate, Phoenician glacis, Hellenistic remains, crusader castle foundations above earlier Roman fortifications, and remains of the Ottoman citadel. The future site museum will display remains from the Tell area and other archaeological sites which are part of the heritage trail. A sinuous underground path guides visitors through Canaanite, Phoenician- Persian, Hellinistic, Roman, Byzantine and Medieval ages. * Second Route: This section of the Heritage Trail will straddle along several significant Beirut landmarks and buildings like the Town Hall, Parliament, Mohammad Al-Amin Mosque, Saint George Maronite Cathedral, Garden of Forgiveness ... etc. The route will also stroll along the arcaded streets of Maarad leading up to the Grand Theater historic building and numerous stone churches and Mamluk-era mosques. * Third Route: This segment of the pedestrian circuit revolves largely around the \\"Roman Baths Garden\\" and the Grand Serail. The Roman Baths Garden at the base of the Serail Hill exhibits brick vaults, remains of ventilation networks, old water heating apparatuses, bathing areas among other archaeological remains from the bathhouse. The route also passes by terraced gardens, fountains, Olive and Pine groves, a small amphitheatre, leading all the way up to the hilltop where the route terminates at the Grand Serail, Hamidiyi Clock-tower, Council of Reconstruction and Development, and the St. Louis Capuchin crusader church. * Fourth Route: The fourth route in the Heritage trail lies substantially within the Beirut Souks area. This route contains the Phoenician-Persian quarter, Roman-Byzantine findings, part of the Medieval moat and the Ottoman wharf. Some mosaics, remains, or arcades will be integrated into the new buildings. Other points of interest along the route are the \\"Zawiyat Ibin Iraq\\" shrine, Majidiyya Mosque, and the \\"Antoun Bey Caravanserai\\". Another section of the route displays a late Roman house with an internal garden paved with mosaics and an elaborate water and drainage system, Byzantine portico paved with mosaics and labeled shops, Phoenician storage jars, Mamluk potter kilns ... etc. Shoreline Walk The \\"Shoreline Walk\\" is a proposes sequence of connected spaces which form part of the reconstruction of the Beirut city centre. Following the 1975‚Äì91 Civil War in Lebanon, the Beirut city centre was left devastated, Avenue des Fran√ßais and the coastline had become a dumping ground, extending the land by more than 600m to the north. The city was once known for its rocky shoreline Cornice, with its avenues of palms and caf√©s but during the war a rubbish mountain grew from daily waste tipped into the Mediterranean Sea. Areas have been both preserved and demolished by the new master plan, whilst the remediated landfill is set to become a new district, projecting out into the sea. Rather than leave the old coastline land-locked and redundant, it was decided to create a pedestrian route that straddled the old and new city boundaries. The ‚ÄòShoreline Walk‚Äô is placed between the natural topography and rationalised medieval street layout of the old city, and the engineered grid of the new land-filled area. Research revealed the evolution of Beirut's coastline. The first Phoenician settlers arrived in 1220 BC, followed by Romans in 64 BC, Mamluks in 1291 AD, Ottomans in 1516 and the French in 1918. Successive civilisations adjusted the coastline to create harbors that brought wealth to the city. Along the Shoreline Walk five squares provide areas to pause and relax: Harbour Square, All Saints Square, Shoreline Gardens, Zeytoune Square and Santiyeh Garden. Research into each space revealed remnants of the character of the pre-war city that had been forgotten or destroyed. Each \\"memory\\" generated the development of each square's atmosphere, aligned with the facilities and functions required by a contemporary city to create a network of complementary spaces. Roman Columns on the Garden of Forgiveness site Garden of Forgiveness The Garden of Forgiveness is a project under development in the BCD. The garden is a socio-cultural project that commemorates the scars of the Lebanese Civil War, hence its location along the Green Line that once divided the city between warring factions. Members from more than six religious denominations have participated in the concept, plan, and development of the project. The garden's site is currently filled with uncovered ruins from over fifteen civilizations, most importantly the remains of the Roman city of Berytus. The square is surrounded by three mosques (Mohammad Al-Amin Mosque, Emir Assaf Mosque, Grand Omari Mosque) and three churches (Saint George Maronite Cathedral, St. Elie Greek Melkite Catholic Cathedral, St. Georges Greek Orthodox Cathedral). The award-winning design was conceived by Kathryn Gustafson, the acclaimed architect behind the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain in London. According to the designers, Lebanon's \\"will to become unified and prosperous\\" will be symbolized by selecting plants representing the regions of Lebanon, including Judas trees from the mountains, olive groves from the agricultural plains, and citrus trees from the coast. The archaeological heritage of the site will be respected by referencing the Cardo (main north-south road) and Decumanus (main east-west road), to create strong linear axes. Traces of the ancient pathway will also be highlighted in the design, along with a 4000-year-old heart-shaped well that is believed to had been related to the goddess Astarte. A proposal was also made to add a 9/11 memorial for all the Lebanese victims that went down in the attack. St. Georges Cathedral Museum It is a crypt museum at the St. Georges Greek Orthodox Cathedral on Nejme Square. It is a relatively small museum that reveals layers of Christian heritage belonging to a series of seven churches built on the same exact site starting 2000 years ago. The current cathedral stands on layers of relics where at every stage of its existence its people attempted to enlarge and beautify it, adding more murals and icons. The museum is a crypt underneath the cathedral where oil lamps, pipes, clay and terra cotta pots, miniature statues, and crosses found in various digs are displayed. Glass panels cover some of the crypt's relics and a glass partition separates the crypt from the church's altar directly above it. A narrow metal walkway leads visitors through the twelve stops of the crypt displaying tombstones, mosaics, burial chambers, engravings on stones and columns, well- preserved skeletons, a covered canal, and part of an ancient paved road. The ruins and findings were excavated by Lebanese archaeologists before the cathedral underwent restoration; they aimed at locating the Byzantine church Anastasis, which according to ancient texts is believed to be near Beirut's famous law school before it was leveled by the 551. earthquake. Planet Discovery Planet Discovery is the only permanent children's museum in Lebanon. It is located in Souk Ayyas in Beirut Souks. The museum was inaugurated in 1999 as a collaboration between Solidere, Parc de la Villette, and Palais de la D√©couverte. Relocated to Beirut Souks from Minet El-Hosn, the museum is home to a variety of exhibitions on science and technology offering hands-on-learning experiences for children of all ages. The museum focuses on a handful of themes like revisiting space up-close, exploring our body senses, learning about conception and reproduction, discovering physical phenomena ... etc. The Museum also has a day care center, theatre performances and puppet shows, arts and crafts workshops, and science labs. They also have a summer camp program in collaboration with \\"Gifted and Talented\\". Exterior of the Robert Mouawad Museum Robert Mouawad Private Museum The Robert Mouawad Private Museum is a private residence in the Wadi Abu Jamil quarter that was turned into a museum by the Lebanese businessman Robert Mouawad. The palace was built by the Lebanese politician and art collector Henri Philippe Pharaoun in 1911 in Beirut. The museum houses a combination of art objects oriental and occidental cultures, and a rare collection of books, Chinese porcelain, ceramics, and other significant objects. The palace's architecture and design reflects Pharaoun's infatuation with Islamic Art and decorative wooden panels that date back to the 19th century, especially after his repetitive travels to Syria. Other displayed artifacts include Byzantine mosaics, Roman marble sculptures, jars and jugs, historical columns, pottery, ancient weapons, unique carpets, sophisticated jewelry pieces, rare precious stones, Melkite Catholic icons, and preserved manuscripts. Souk El Tayeb Souk el Tayeb is an open-air weekly market held every Saturday at Trablos street in Beirut Souks (previously located in Saifi). The word souk is Arabic for market and tayeb means good in terms of taste and character. It began in its concept as an organic market, but soon changed to be a farmers‚Äô market of fresh, local, and seasonal food products, that promotes small-scale farmers and producers. The market offers green vegetables, tomatoes, fresh aromatic herbs, pulses, Pomegranate juice, Kibbeh, freshly squeezed carrot juice, a honey distiller, Makdous, Lebanese pastries, fruits, olives, Rose Water, homemade pickled vegetables, Labneh, Manakish made on the Saj, Markook bread ... etc. The market is organized and run by a non-profit cooperative organization headquartered on Rue Gouraud. The organization works on many levels nationally and internationally to promote and preserve Lebanese food and culinary traditions, rural heritage and natural environment. Souk el Tayeb has achieved over the years an economically viable and socially responsive approach to supporting small-scale farmers and producers, contributing to local community development initiatives, and educating about food traditions and heritage. Conservatoire Libanais Le Conservatoire libanais national sup√©rieur de musique, or the Lebanese National Higher Conservatory of Music, was founded in the 1930s by Wadia Sabra, composer of the national anthem of Lebanon. In 1953, President Camille Chamoun along with the Minister of Education, ordered the creation of a board to manage the conservatory and the \\"Friends of Music\\" foundation was created to help finance the conservatory. In 1959, the Conservatoire became 1959 an Autonomous National Institution under the supervision of the Minister of Education. During the Lebanese Civil War (1975-1991) the National Conservatoire suffered great damage: all the instruments, documents and the library were looted and burnt. The Conservatoire resumed teaching in 1991 and was upgraded in 1995 to a National Institution of Higher Education. The conservatory is headed by the well-known composer and conductor Dr. Walid Gholmieh and has more than 4,800 students and 250 professors in more than 9 branches. The conservatory is home to the Lebanese National Symphony Orchestra, the Lebanese Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO) & the Lebanese Oriental Orchestra (LOO), that perform yearly more than 100 concerts and activities devoted to the conservatory's educational mission. Its main headquarters is on the Serail Hill in Downtown Beirut, directly facing the southern gate of the Grand Serail. Beirut City History Museum The Beirut City History Museum is a proposed project by Solidere on an archaeological site north of Martyrs Square. Excavations on the site in the mid-1990s unearthed such significant finds as the Phoenician Tell, the Bronze Age city gate and remains from the Persian, Hellenistic, Byzantine, Medieval and Ottoman periods. Shortly after Solidere commissioned french architect Michel Macary, known for his design of the Louvre extension, to undertake the initial study of the Tell and explore the concept of the site specific museum. The museum's design will be integrated with the Martyrs Square underground parking, the Petit Serail and the landscaped garden at the Martyrs Square and Tell site. Solidere commissioned renowned Italian architect Renzo Piano to study the square's architectural and urban design, including the Beirut City History Museum, in cooperation with the Ministry of Culture. In order to safeguard the location while providing vehicle and pedestrian access in a heavy use environment, Solidere commissioned a study of three road options and a detailed design of the most appropriate one. The chosen option incorporates a two-way road and bridge structure on the east side of the Tell and underpasses to ensure pedestrian connection to the museum. Civic institutions After the reconstruction, the city center regained its role as the focus of civic life in Lebanon. Several key institutions have relocated there including the Parliament and its related offices, the Government's headquarters, and the Beirut Municipality. The BCD also has a dense concentration of public agencies, important ministries, and governmental offices, some of which are:Lebanese Parliament House * Ministry of Culture and Higher Education * Ministry of the Displaced * Lebanese Customs * Investment Development Authority (IDAL) * National Economic and Social Council * Council of Reconstruction and Development (CDR) * Ministry of Finance * Ministry of Transportation * National Statistics Bureau * Post and Telecommunications * Ministry of State of Administrative Reform * Public Audit Court Facade of the Beirut City Hall Beirut City Hall Dating back to 1934, Beirut City Hall building has become an architectural landmark in the Downtown area. The building is located on the intersection of Foch Street and Rue Weygand in the city center. The building is in the Venetian and Arabesque architectural styles, a mix that expresses the regional identity of the area. The building was restored after the Lebanese Civil War and it currently houses the office of the Governor of Beirut and the municipal council. It is open to the public and for official registration of documents. Grand Serail Built in 1853 as an army barracks atop a hill in central Beirut, the Grand Serail currently hosts the office of the Prime Minister of Lebanon. The Grand Serail is a historic building, the most important of three Ottoman monuments on the Serail hill. The other two are the Council for Development and Reconstruction and the Hamidiyyeh clock tower. The Grand Serail followed the architectural design epitomizing the new Ottoman military organization. The building was severely damaged in the events of the Lebanese Civil War; its reconstruction took 900 work days and was completed in 1998. The Serail covers 39,700 square meters of floor space. The Grand Serail's four wings are disposed around a large courtyard which flanked at the center by a limestone and Carrera marble fountain. Both the exterior and interior facades are covered by a total of 588 arches and arcades. The two upper floors comprise the Prime Minister's residence and office, offices for his staff, as well as the cabinet room and ministers' offices. The ground floor consists of a banquet hall, two receptions areas, a press room and a courtyard. An underground level includes a car-park, offices and rooms for personnel. In all the Grand Serail includes 430 rooms and chambers in addition to the quarters for the maintenance and other service rooms. Squares and public spaces A pedestrian street in the Beirut city center The Beirut Central District contains over 60 gardens, squares and open spaces. These spaces comprise landscaped streets, gardens, historical squares, pedestrian areas and sea promenades thus totaling to an area of of open spaces. This makes the BCD home to 50% of the entire public spaces in Beirut, despite the fact that the BCD itself is only 10% of Beirut City. These public spaces gradually developed into a thriving social scene for the Beirut residents, thanks in part to the city's mild weather. City officials have imposed several plans to attract the urban users and the nature lovers to Beirut's squares and spaces. One of the plans is a \\"temporary uses\\" policy focused on a rambla pedestrian spine that links the existing city center and Beirut Souks northwards to the terraced corniche and promenade. The spine is now open for jogging and cycling, with surrounding roads being closed off to traffic on the weekends. They also include street markets and festivals, health and environment awareness campaigns, cat walks and dog shows. National Unity Square National Unity Square is a landscaped design garden on the southern slope of the Serail Hill. The garden was originally designed by Vladimir Djurovic in basalt stone; the project was completed in 2009 and is currently being upgraded. The garden was conceptualized in a cascading manner as to cope with the sloping nature of the area's topography. The Russian sculptor Maguerditch Mazmanian presented a statue of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri depicting him as if walking through the garden. Elongated planes of gray stone and water mirrors, laid on a grass surface, step down towards the city. A row of Jacaranda trees marks the edge between the steps and the Grand Serail‚Äôs fa√ßade. Khalil Gibran Garden This popular Beirut destination was named after the famous Lebanese- American Poet Khalil Gibran. With an area of 6000 square meters, this garden was landscaped to emphasize its status as a main entrance to the city center. Its landscaped design consists of two circular lawns looking out into the garden and the UN House. Trees surround a blue water fountain and a brick- tiled platform, with six obelisks marking the gates of the garden. Several sculptures of abstract art inspired by Khalil Gibran dot the location. The space also witnessed numerous political protests in the past years adding to the venue's strategic importance. It also hosts, since 2005, a permanent sit- in tent for the demand of the release of Lebanese prisoners in Syria. Omar Daouk Square in the Beirut Central District Nejmeh Square in Beirut Central District Omar Daouk Square The Omar Daouk Square is named after the Lebanese politician Omar beik Daouk. This 1,006 square meter square was designed by Mohammad Halawi around a bust by Maguerditch Mazmanian of Omar Daouk himself. The design of the Omar Daouk Square introduces three green terraces that soften the site incline, since it lies on the inclined Omar Daouk Street. The trees and flowers surrounding it create an attractive open area where one can sit and rest. Nejme Square Nejme Square, or Place de l'√âtoile, is the central square in the Downtown area. It is home to the Lebanese Parliament and its complementary buildings, two cathedrals, a museum, and several cafes and restaurants. Most notable for its Art Deco architecture, the square has become a recognizable icon of Beirut City worldwide. The jewel of the square is a 1930s clock-tower with its four-faced Rolex clock. The clock tower was gift from Lebanese-Mexican √©migr√© Michel Abed. Today, the square is filled with tourists and locals who come here to dine, walk or enjoy the street life. The square is also known for its noticeable population of pigeons. In 1994, archaeological diggings underneath the Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Beirut Central District's Nejmeh Square identified structural elements of the ancient \\"Anastasis cathedral\\", but they were restricted to an area of and failed to unearth the interred Law School of Berytus.Sartre 2005, p. 291Skaf 2005, pp. 224‚Äì229Johe Anastanes Hall 2004, p. 67 Waterside Park An ambitious future project, this park will be the largest park in the city of Beirut once completed. 78,000 square meters of green space will comprise this park and help transform it into a recreational attraction for the city and its metropolitan area. It will host a public performance space, an open-air amphitheater, retail kiosks, a main entrance pavilion, and will be directly connected to the Sea Corniche. The original plans for the park included a prepared strip along its northwestern edge designed to accommodate the Formula One pits, and other temporary Formula One facilities during Grand Prix events. However, plans for the future Formula One circuit have been abandoned due to excessive demands from the Formula One Committee. The Roman Baths Garden Roman Baths Garden The \\"Roman Baths\\" is a landscaped public space that lies on the eastern slope of the Serail Hill. It consists of a garden and a set of uncovered ruins of ancient Roman baths, hence the name of the place. Originally discovered in 1968-69, the ruins underwent a thorough cleaning and further excavation in 1995-1997. Designed by the British landscaping firm Gillepsies, the Garden's layout is dominated with low-slung glass walls and lookout platforms that can be turned into concert venues, thus giving a 21st-century touch without harming the area's historical fabric. The space contains elevated terraces that attempt to revive sights of ancient Mediterranean gardens. During the tourism season, the place hosts several open-air concerts and plays. Both tourists and locals are drawn to the popular international concerts that the place hosts as part of the World Music Day. Sea Corniche Once the Zaitounay Bay, the Corniche promenade, the Eastern Marina, and the Beirut Port First Basin promenade are completed, the city center will provide an uninterrupted corniche along Beirut's shoreline. This new addition will be four times the area of the existing Corniche Beirut. The new Sea Corniche will consist of a three-decked promenade, and will be more than long and between 110 and 45 meters in width. The master-plan for the Corniche intends to transform it into a socially active pedestrian arena with distributed \\"activity spots\\" for sports, recreation and children activities. Castle Square Belvedere Park Situated in the central business district of Beirut, \\"Castle Square Belvedere Park\\" is a public plaza adjacent to the oldest archaeological site in the city, the \\"Tell Area\\". The site, which includes findings that are over 6,000 years old, is the location of the ancient city of Berytus, the Roman origins of modern-day Beirut. The design of the square was conceived by the Boston- based architecture and urban design firm Machado and Silvetti in 2005. The centerpiece of the square is the \\"Beirut Citadel\\" which, although significantly reduced in size, still houses visible ruins including portions of a medieval castle and an Ottoman barrack. Water features and fountains were created on either side of the citadel to highlight the locations of both the ancient harbor and the medieval moat. Imam Ouzai Square Imam Ouzai Square The Imam Ouzai Square is part of the Beirut Souks project in the BCD. The square marks the main entrance to the souks from Rue Weygand. The square's floor is tiled with black basalt stone including an oval with outlines of the old Roman pavement, and it hosts an old olive tree in its center. Architecturally speaking, the design of the square integrates several features from its old heritage as well as several elements of modernity. A cupola-topped prayer hall to the left creates a virtual entrance to the square by mirroring a Mamluk-era shrine on the right. Some of the squares features are curved white marble planters surrounding Ibn Iraq monument, white marble circular planters with trees and shrubs; white marble circular steps guiding to Bab Idriss and the Souks upper floors; seating spaces facing the shop fronts, providing shade and emphasizing the entrance towards Souk Tawileh. The square also offers passages to Souk Sayyour and the Gold Souks. Zeytouneh Square Situated at the southernmost point of the Shoreline Walk, Zeytouneh Square forms a key link connecting the different sectors of the central district. Designed by Gustafson-Porter, the company of renowned American landscape architect and artist Kathryn Gustafson, the 600-sq-meters square was inaugurated in 2011, after eight years of designing, planning and construction works. Described by the square's architects as a \\"celebration of modern Beirut and place for cultural events\\", the square's terraces were made to utilize the existing slope to provide an informal amphitheater space from which concerts, festivals and films can be viewed. The surface of the Zeytouneh Square extends across the roads to the surrounding buildings, unifying the square as one large space. The bold paving patterns were inspired from the Black and White patterning found in traditional Lebanese houses, with the paving stripes changing with the topography of the landscape. Provided with free wireless internet access, the square's design was complemented with stone benches and Albizia trees, to gradually help the square become a popular hangout place. Samir Kassir Garden Samir Kassir Square A square on Rue Weygand street in the Beirut Central District commemorating the late journalist and political activist Samir Kassir. The square is located behind the An-Nahar building, the renowned newspaper headquarters where Kassir used to work. The garden boasts a bronze statue of Kassir done by the French sculptor Louis Derbr√©. Two historic ficus trees provide shade at the centre of the space, and a reflecting pool with water cascading over its edges marks the border with the street. The pool is flanked by a rectangular timber deck that encircles the two trees, and has at its western side a long bench of solid stone. The edges of the site have a ground cover of dwarf Natal plum (carissa macrocarpa), a water-conserving plant known for its dark evergreen leaves and its white, star-shaped flowers and red berries which grow throughout the year. In 2007, the garden won the Aga Khan Award for Architecture, an architectural prize affiliated with landscape design, area conservation, and community development and improvement. Martyrs' Square The \\"Old Opera House\\" on Martyrs' Square Synonymous with Lebanon's modern history, Martyrs' Square is a central, and biggest, town square in Beirut and its central district. Initially named \\"Place des Canons\\", or \\"Cannons Square\\", it was built by the Ottomans during their occupation of Lebanon in the 19th century. During World War I, Beirut suffered from a blockade by the Allies which was intended to starve the Turks out; however, the result was a famine that killed a quarter of Lebanon's population. An unsuccessful revolt against the Turks broke out which resulted in the execution of Lebanese nationalists in the square on 19 May 1916, hence bestowing upon it its current name, \\"Martyrs' Square\\". The Square was completely destroyed in the Lebanese Civil War, and reconstruction began in the early 1990s. The \\"Martyrs' Statue\\", the iconic bullet-riddled centerpiece of the square, was maintained and restored alongside the old opera house. After the assassination of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, the square regained its original role as the \\"throbbing heart of the political life in Lebanon\\". The Square became ground zero for the political sit-ins, demonstrations, and protests of the Cedar Revolution in 2005. Solidere recently commissioned the re-designing and landscaping of the square, after an international urban design competition for the Martyrs' Square axis was conducted by an international organization. Khan Antoun Bey Square \\"Khan Antoun Bey Square\\" is an under-construction project located in the northern section of the Beirut Souks. The Portuguese landscaping studio PROAP were selected as winners of the architectural landscaping contest, and were hence commissioned by Solidere to design the square. The square's master-plan addresses the site's history, location and surroundings, to develop its area as a link between the traditional city center and the newly constructed waterfront district. Once completed, the \\"Khan Antoun Bey Square\\" will be a major public plaza where pedestrian routes from the BCD converge. The square is divided into two main areas, a lower plaza and a higher circulation plaza. The transition between the two levels occurs through a pedestrian lane shaping a natural amphitheater and event seating area. Historically, this area used to be a loading dock connecting the harbor with the souqs. The square will pay tribute to this by including water features, re-installing the original harbor wall, and consolidating the remains of the ancient city wall with the square's design. Rafik Hariri Memorial Garden Rafik Hariri Memorial Garden The \\"Rafik Hariri Memorial Garden\\" is a public space in the Saint George Bay neighborhood facing the InterContinental Phoenicia Beirut Hotel. The garden pays tribute to the former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and the other 22 victims who died in the massive car bomb attack on 14 February 2005 on the same exact site. The garden's construction was completed in two and half months's and it was inaugurated on the third anniversary of the assassination of Rafic Hariri in 2005. The memorial is a 700-square-meter replica of the garden of the Hariri family residence in Qoreitem, with water flowing from the edges of the site and a 6-meter bronze statue of the late premier on top. A bronze pole with a clock and inscriptions of verses from the Lebanese National Anthem stands near Hariri's statue, and each day at 12:55 p.m. - the time of Hariri's killing - the clock emits the sounds of church bells and the Islamic call to prayer for five minutes. In the same five minutes, a flame also rises from a 4-meter statue in the garden in the middle of five bronze Lebanese flags.

Religious buildings Mohammad Al-Amin Mosque and Saint George Maronite Cathedral sit side by side in Beirut's central district The Beirut City Center is one of the most religiously diverse areas in the world. Mosques and churches lie side by side on the BCD's streets. Several of these churches and mosques are hundreds of years old and are of high archaeological significance. In total, the BCD is home to ten churches, six mosques, and one synagogue located in the Wadi Abu Jamil neighborhood. Despite the severe destruction incurred on these buildings during the Civil War, they have been restored to their prior shape and are all currently in use. During religious holidays and occasions, the churches and mosques host social gatherings, charity events, religious competitions, chorus recitals of religious verses, and mass prayers attended by Lebanon's top political figures. Mohammad Al- Amin Mosque The Mohammad Al-Amin Mosque is a Sunni Muslim mosque located on Beirut's Martyrs' Square. It is most known for being the backdrop of the Cedar Revolution events in 2005. Inspired by the Sultan Ahmed Mosque in Istanbul, this mosque follows the Ottoman architectural style with touches and illustrations in the Mamluk Egyptian style. It is most recognizable for its yellow ochre stone exterior, giant blue domes, and 72-meter-high Mecca-styled minarets. Construction began in 2002 by Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, and was finished in 2007. His son Saad Hariri inaugurated the mosque in a huge celebration on October 17, 2008. It is the central mosque for the Sunni Muslim denomination in Lebanon. Grand Omari Mosque The Grand Omari Mosque Before being eclipsed by Mohammad Al-Amin Mosque, this initially used to be the central mosque of Beirut. Named in honor of Umar ibn al-Khattab, this mosque was initially a Crusader church, that by its turn used to be a pagan temple. Occupied and reoccupied again and again by warring factions during the Crusades era, this mosque eventually rested in the hands of the Muslims in 1291. The mosque's interior sandstone walls are decorated in Mamluk and Ottoman inscriptions. Inside the mosque, a golden steel cage, a gift from Sultan Abdul Hamid II to Beirut, encircles a shrine for John the Baptist. The mosque's Mihrab, a semicircular niche in the wall indicating the qibla, is located on the eastern side, and bears distinct ancient Greek engravings. Three hairs from prophet Muhammad were preserved in the southwestern side of the mosque; they were presented to the mosque by Sultan Abd√ºlmecid I. The Mosque underwent several restorations by the General Directory of Awqaf and the Tourism Ministry, specifically in 1952 and 1949. It sustained severe damages in the Lebanese Civil War, and was attacked several times by militias that slashed the Sahabah names on the walls and stolen the hairs. During the reconstruction of the Beirut Central District, the mosque was renovated and enlarged to its current area. Saint George Maronite Cathedral The Saint George Maronite Cathedral is the cathedral of the Maronite Archdiocese in Beirut. After ten years of works started by Monsignor Joseph Debs, the construction of the cathedral was finished in 1894. The church's facade, interior and plan were inspired from the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in the city of Rome. The walls of the church are decorated with stucco and marble. The armchair that Pope John Paul II used during his visit to Lebanon in May 1997 has been preserved in the cathedral's Retroquire. St. Georges Greek Orthodox Cathedral Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral on Nejme Square The Greek Orthodox Cathedral of St. Georges, completed in 1772, is located directly on Nejme Square and is the oldest orthodox church in Beirut. Its location is believed to be directly adjacent to the site of the renowned Roman Law School of Beirut. The church underwent several restorations in its history due to natural disasters, erosion, and intentional destruction. During the Lebanese Civil War, the church was burned and destroyed with most of its belongings stolen. The Greek Orthodox Archbishopric of Beirut began its renovation on October 16, 1995. The excavation at the site led to the discovery of the remains of three other churches and part of the Roman colonnades. These artifacts were incorporated into an underground museum directly located below the cathedral.\\"Anastasis\\" ancient Roman cathedral St. Nishan Armenian Orthodox Church The Armenian Orthodox Church of St. Nishan This is the only church dedicated for the Armenian Orthodox Church in the Beirut Central District. It is constructed directly on the Serail Hill facing the Serail and the Conservatoire Libanais. Its name means \\"holy sign\\", referring to an important relic. The church's exterior is covered with white limestone tiles, while its roof is covered with red bricks and a grey lead dome. St. Elie Armenian Catholic Cathedral The Catholic Armenian church of St. Elie The first Armenian Catholic cathedral to be constructed in Beirut, its construction began with the Armenian Catholic Archbishop in 1860. It was severely damaged during the civil war, due to its location directly along the Green Line. The Archbishopric took control of it in the early 1990s and began restoration works. The church was destroyed several times in history, most notably when it was torn down to be expanded in 1901 and for the construction of the Saints' Convent in 1950. Amir Assaf Mosque The Amir Assaf Mosque is located on Weygand Street in the central district of Beirut, near the eastern side of Al-Omari Great Mosque and facing the southeastern angle of the Municipal Palace and Samir Kassir Garden. It was built by Emir Mansour Assaf between 1572 and 1580 on the site of the Byzantine Church of the Holy Savior. It is also called \\"Bab Al-Saray Mosque\\" meaning \\"Door of the Great Serial\\". Scholars disagree regarding the reason for the mosque's second name, some say it is referring to the Ottoman Grand Serail while others insist that it's referring to \\"Dar Al-Wilaya\\", an ancient government serail near the mosque that was built by Prince Fakhr-al-Din II, governor of Beirut and Mount Lebanon. Emir Munzer Mosque Named after the Prince Munzer Bin Suleiman, this mosque is also called the \\"Nafoura\\" (which means Fountain) due to the presence of an ancient fountain in its courtyard. The mosque was completed in 1620 during the reign of Fakhr-al-Din II, the Prince of Mount Lebanon. The mosque contains six Roman columns in its center. Saint Elias Greek Catholic Cathedral The Saint Elias Cathedral is located along Nejme Square in the Beirut Central District, and is affiliated with the Greek Melkite Catholic Church in Lebanon. At the time of its completion in 1863, the cathedral was perceived as a remarkable place due to its Byzantine architecture and beautiful oriental decoration. The cathedral is famous for its notable neo- classical interior design, its marble iconostasis, the Gothic arcs, and the celestial oculi. The cathedral was restored by the Archdiocese in 1994, after the damages caused by the war. The restoration works began at the end of 2003 and ended in May 2006. National Evangelical Church National Evangelical Church of Beirut The National Evangelical Church of Beirut is the first native Arabic Protestant congregation of the Middle East. Established in downtown Beirut in 1848 by Congregational and Presbyterian American missionaries, it is the oldest and biggest of nine congregations in Lebanon. During the Lebanese Civil War (1975‚Äì1990), the church was completely destroyed, except for the bell-tower, and the congregation consequently dispersed. Since its reconstruction in 1998, the National Evangelical Church of Beirut started re- gathering its parishioners in its fold, and holding regular prayer services and organizing socio-cultural activities. Residing directly adjacent to the Grand Serail, the architecture of this church is gothic and oriental with a red-brick roof. Saint Louis Capuchin Church The Saint Louis Capuchin Church is a Latin Catholic church in downtown Beirut, located to the north of the Grand Serail and Council of Reconstruction and Development. Built in 1864 by the Capuchin missionaries and named it in the honor of King Louis IX of France. The church was the first landmark structure to be renovated and opened in Beirut after the end of the Lebanese Civil War. The church is highly noticeable for its sandstone facades, rose-colored wooden windows, and its new towering white-limestone campanile. All Saints Anglican Church All Saints church was established in 1912. The church was founded by the sea shore close to Port of Beirut in order to serve the seafarers. It became then a church for the international English speaking community in the Lebanese capital. The Arab local congregation was established by the Palestinian refugees who were forced out of their land and homes in 1948. Many Lebanese families who came back to Lebanon from Palestine, where they became Anglicans, joined the church since then. All Saints is one of 27 Anglican/Episcopal churches in the territories under the jurisdiction of the Episcopal Church in Jerusalem and the Middle East. All Saints is the only Anglican Church in Lebanon. International and foreign institutions The Beirut Central District has become the heart of diplomatic life in Lebanon due to the secure environment, high-tech amenities, and modern services that it enjoys. Benefiting from the geographic location of the city center and the proximity to official and business institutions, Downtown Beirut has become the center for many international institutions, business and cultural delegations, and foreign embassies. As such, several countries have become officially represented in the city center through embassies, business and cultural cooperation agencies, humanitarian NGOs, and consulates. Some of these are: UN House which hosts United Nations headquarters * American-Lebanese Chamber of Commerce * Union of Arab Banks * ESCWA * Embassy of Belgium * Embassy of Italy * Consulate of Belize * Instituto Cervantes * Arab Cultural Foundation * Lebanese-German Business Council * Amideast Cultural Cooperation agency * Consulate of Turkey * Embassy of Japan * Embassy of Britain * Embassy of Argentina * Consulate of Gambia * Embassy of Australia * Embassy of Norway * Embassy of Denmark UN House A landmark development at the southern gateway to the city center, overlooking Riad Al Solh Square and Gibran Khalil Gibran monumental garden, UN House was designed by Pierre El Khoury Architects as an intelligent building to house several United Nations local and regional agencies. Since its inauguration by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in 1997, the UN House has become the focal point of the diplomatic activity in Lebanon. Best known for being the headquarters of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA), UN House also hosts several UN regional and local headquarters including the World Bank's permanent Beirut office. The architecture of this nine-story development is in the shape of an arch, with an internal landscaped atrium of 600 sq m providing a pleasant shaded area with trees, flowers and benches. Extensive use of glass in the external walls gives the building a glittering appearance and allows natural light throughout. It is an intelligent building equipped with state-of-the-art technology. It comprises 43,000 square meters of floor space including offices, a library, language lab facilities, a conference center, storage, parking and retail space. The UN House hosts important conferences throughout the year. Shopping and dining Chanel store in the BCD right The city center houses more than 350 retail outlets distributed along its streets and quarters. Shopping in the city center mainly consists of upscale fashion boutique chains, world-renowned designer shops, high-end stores, and luxury boutiques boasting the most expensive designer labels. Stores sell fashion clothing, accessories, jewelry, furniture, Hi-Fi and electronic equipment, records and books, handicrafts and gifts, art and antiques. The stores are mostly at street level, but recently some have expanded onto upper floors. Buildings or group of buildings are dedicated to department stores. Starting from the conservation area, stores are spreading to other areas to finally culminate in the Beirut Souks. There are over 100 cafes, restaurants, pubs and nightclubs open in the Beirut Central District. Restaurants offer a variety of French, Italian, American, Lebanese, Chinese, Japanese and other Asian cuisines. Sidewalk cafes are a trademark of the Downtown area, with tens of them lining the streets. They range from oriental cafes serving Turkish Coffee and Shisha to global franchises such as Starbucks. Beirut Souks Souk Tawileh The Beirut Souks is a mega-shopping district in Downtown Beirut. It is home to more than 200 shops and a department store, thus making it Beirut's biggest shopping strip. The souks project is a reconstruction of the old medieval market, after it sustained irreparable damage from the Lebanese Civil War. In 1994, the Lebanese Parliament approved a master-plan conceived by Lebanese architect Jad Tabet, and construction was taken on by the real estate company Solidere. Solidere sought to bring back the souks' historic commercial function at the heart of Beirut and appeal to the mercantile community that had fled during the war, while still preserving the original Hellenistic street grid that characterized the old souks and the area's historical landmarks. The souks were designed as interconnected open spaces with many access points along long vaulted shopping alleys and arcades. The Beirut Souks have retained their historical names: Souk al Tawila (the long souk), Souk Arwam, Souk Jamil, Souk Ayyass, Souk Sayyour, Souk Bustros and Souk Arwad. Some of the stores in the souks are Cartier, Gucci, Burberry, Fendi, Zara, Mark Jacobs, Dolce & Gabbana, Dior, Massimo Dutti, Mango, Bottega Veneta, Timberland, Yves Saint Laurent, Bershka, Roberto Cavalli, Springfield, Chloe, Jimmy Choo, Jack & Jones, Stella McCartney, Celine, Louis Vuitton, Vero Moda, and Pull and Bear. The northern section of Beirut Souks houses an entertainment complex designed by Paris-based architecture firm Valode & Pistre. A mega entertainment destination, it comprises 14 cinemas with two VIP halls served by large lounge and concession areas. At Allenby Street Level, high-end boutiques line the sides while the adjacent L-shaped building hosts the cafes and restaurants. The northern souks also have a large department store designed by the international architecture and design firm Zaha Hadid Architects, based in Clerkenwell, London. Art and music Street Art in front of a Cartier shop The Quartier des Arts at the Saifi Village A live performance at the Music Hall Beirut is the center of the entertainment business and art scene in the region. A thriving artistic center, Beirut has become a new regional hub for exhibitions, art galleries, and music performances. Local, regional and international exhibitions are regularly organized around the quarters of the city center. Those exhibitions cover a varied array of topics spanning sculptures, paintings, architecture and urban planning, manuscripts and archives, photography, handicrafts, and various other technical, commercial, industrial, and scientific themes. Venues that host these exhibitions range from historic buildings, cultural centers, media headquarters, bookstores and cafes to wholly dedicated exhibition centers and specialized display galleries. Also, open spaces often host numerous temporary art galleries and public shows. Beirut Souks, specifically Ajami Square and Trablous Street, have become a favorable location for street shows, exhibitions and concerts like the 2011 Miss Lebanon Pageant. Beirut International Exhibition & Leisure Center (commonly BIEL) is a dedicated fair ground, constituting 15000 sq meters of display floor, that hosts diversely themed exhibitions. Saifi Village is Beirut's \\"Quartier des Arts\\" or \\"Arts Quarter\\", hosting year-round events in its vibrant cluster of art galleries and artisan shops. Concerts and musical performances can be attended in churches or historic buildings, in open spaces, and in private venues like the Music Hall. Beirut Central District gradually regained, as well as evolved, its role as the cultural and literature pivot of the capital. Major bookstores and libraries in the country are located here, and constantly host book signings, book launching, seminars and conferences by world-renowned, regional and local authors. Major bookstores are Librarie Antoune, Al Bourj Bookstore, Virgin Megastores, and Sored bookstore; as well as a planned public library on Martyrs' Square. The central district is also home to the headquarters of the acclaimed Pan-Middle East newspapers An-Nahar, The Daily Star, and L'Orient-Le Jour. In 2010, Beirut was named the World Book Capital, celebrations and activities of the occasion were held in the BIEL center in the central district. The central district is home to the annual Beirut Arab & International Book Fair, that features works and authors from Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Iraq, Palestine and Egypt and several others, with some 180 Lebanese publishers, and dozens more from the rest of the Arab world participating. Another major Book Fair held in the central district is the Francophone Book Fair. The fair gathers together authors and personalities from Europe, North Africa and Lebanon, with a different country being chosen as the guest of honor each year. In its twienth year, the fair welcomed nearly 100,000 visitors. In 2012, The Arab and International Book Fair entered its 56th year, while the Francophone Book Fair turned twenty.

The list of performers in the festival's first year included Al Di Meola, Earth, Wind & Fire, Goran Bregovic, Ilham al-Madfai, Marcel Khalife, Natacha Atlas, Roger Hodgson and many more. Beirut Jazz Festival The Beirut Jazz Festival is an annual music festival and celebration that runs for almost ten days each year. The festival was launched in 2007 in downtown Beirut by Solidere, the real estate company behind the re- development of the Beirut Central District. The festival has taken place in different venues each year, most recently on Ajami Square in the Beirut Souks. According to the festival's organizers, the Beirut Jazz Festival doesn't limit itself exclusively to classical Jazz music but \\"integrates folkloric Arabic Music into western improvisational musical ideas whilst experimenting with traditional music genres from diverse parts of the world\\". Some of the jazz artists who have taken part in the festival recently are Rabih Abou-Khalil, Charbel Rouhana, Marcus Miller, Patti Austin, Randy Crawford, Joe Sample, Arturo Sandoval, Charlie Winston, Chucho Vald√©s and several others. F√™te de la Musique Initiated in Paris in 1982, The F√™te de la Musique, or World Music Day, has evolved into an international music festival that is celebrated worldwide, and in the Middle East only Jordan, Morocco, and Algeria celebrate it next to Lebanon. It is an all-night music celebration held at the moment of the summer solstice, and consists of free concerts by amateur and professional musicians and are accessible to all the public. It takes place in various venues in the Beirut Central District (mainly Martyrs' Square, Roman Baths Garden, and Samir Kassir Square) or outside of the district (Rue Hamra and Rue Gouraud). \\"Time Out Beirut\\" magazine described the festival saying that \\"it encourages people to see great free music and break down the barriers between the streets and the players, it‚Äôs a democratising evening of musical discovery\\". Beirut Celebrates \\"Beirut Celebrates\\" is the name of the annual Christmas and New Year's Eve festivities in the Beirut Central District. Under the patronage of the Prime Minister of Lebanon and the Lebanese Ministry of Culture, Solidere, the Lebanese Company for the Development and Reconstruction of Beirut, organizes a series of events on the occasion of the end of the year festivities. The downtown area witnesses a giant Christmas Parade that straddles along Martyrs' Square, Allenby Street, and Beirut Souks; and the inauguration of the \\" Santa's Village\\", a Christmas market in Saifi Village. Other celebrations include Christmas Lights, Lighting of the Christmas tree, Firework shows, singing carols, marching bands, Santa floats, and many more events. Beirut International Marathon \\"Beirut International Marathon\\" is an annual event in the Beirut Central District that started on October 19, 2003. It is organized by the non-profit NGO \\"Beirut Marathon Association\\" whose mission, according to their website, is to \\"passionately organize running events that inspire unity, positively change lifestyles, promote wellness, and provide an experience of challenge, achievement, joy, and glory; for the benefit of Lebanon, both for now and generations to come\\". Since it launched its first race in 2003, the marathon has grown noticeably receiving local and international recognition; thus earning the Bronze Road Race Label from the International Association of Athletics Federations, the \\"Power of Sports\\" award from the AIPSF, and the Laureus World Sports Awards. The marathon's trail starts at a different point in the Beirut Central District each year but always terminates at Martyrs' Square.

New Waterfront District Seafront Towers at Zaitunay Bay, Downtown Beirut thumb A good portion of the Beirut Central District lies on land reclaimed from the Mediterranean, providing an uninterrupted 3.5-km extension of the city shoreline. The Waterfront District is a prime, active, multi-use district with financial, business, residential, tourist and leisure facilities and extensive green areas and bold architecture, that overlooks the Saint George Bay and Mount Lebanon. When fully completed, it will contain two marinas, a waterside city park, Corniche and quayside promenades, with 29 ha of new waterside development land. The entire district comprises 73 hectares of reclaimed land north of the old seashore, enclosed within a terraced sea defense system designed to withstand centennial storms. Together with the Seaside Park, Corniche Beirut and the West Marina with land, quays and breakwater around, it includes development blocks and public domain extending north of Beirut Souks area to reach the corniche promenade, and east of the Seaside Park to reach the first basin of the Port of Beirut and the planned East Marina. The Seaside Park was recently the subject of a design competition among six international landscape architectural firms. Solidere's phasing strategy includes dedicating a carefully planned zone for temporary uses while allowing perimeter development to take place. The strategy spatially focuses on a pedestrian spine that links the existing city center and Beirut Souks to the terraced waterfront corniche promenades. The spine is open for walking, jogging, cycling, kiting and other similar activities. Solidere created cultural, recreational and commercial attractions via constructing structures and open spaces with a wide-ranging program of activities, such as the Beirut Exhibition Center. Other temporary structures in the New Waterfront are a sports center, a beach club, a winter sky bar, and many restaurants and cafes. An area in the eastern part of the district was leased to Beirut International Exhibition & Leisure Center (BIEL); it includes exhibition halls, conference areas, a banquet pavilion and a seaside restaurant. The marine works on the Waterfront District includes a submerged reef as first defense line extending 100 m seawards along the full extent of the Corniche - 80 reinforced concrete caissons, each 17.5 m wide, 27.75 m long and 10.5 m high, as second defense line. The superstructure provides two-level promenades over 1.3 km. Back-filling behind them provides a stabilizing bond and a third promenade, 5.5 m above sea level. On September 16, 2012, the New Waterfront District was the site of a huge mass held by the pope. The mass was the culmination of Pope Benedict XVI's three- day visit to Lebanon. An estimated 350,000 people gathered on the waterfront for the event. West Marina Marina Towers Beirut Central District has two marinas, to the west and east of the new Waterfront district. Beirut West Marina is to the west of the central district, within short walking distance of the Beirut Souks, BIEL and historic core. West Marina provides mooring for 164 boats on average annually, having been opened in 2001. Its capacity stands at 186 boats, ranging from 5 to 65 meters, with three-quarters of the mooring area accommodating boats of more than 25 meters long. Solidere developed and is operating the West Marina as part of its 50-year agreement with the Lebanese Government, which also includes planned underground corniche car park. Construction on the East Marina will commence in early 2013 in the northeast quarter of the Waterfront District. Beirut Exhibition Center Beirut Exhibition Center is the first structure dedicated to contemporary art in Beirut's new waterfront district. It is composed of 1200 square meters of art gallery space, with its exterior shell covered in reflective mirror-like steel. Working with the topography, the building sits in a reflective pool of water that further reflects both the building and its surroundings, including a bamboo grove to the north and a sculpture garden to the south. The center is designed by L.E.FT, an architecture and landscape design firm based in New York City. L.E.FT described the center saying: \\"The mirror facades allow the Beirut Exhibition Center to act as a scale reflecting the continuously changing landscape in the waterfront district. The city becomes a work of art, an abstract expressionist painting in motion. Beirut finally sees itself in the mirror.\\" An adjacent landscape garden and an outdoor cafe are annexed to the Beirut Exhibition Center. Zaitunay Bay The Boardwalk at Zaitunay Bay Zaitunay Bay is a quayside commercial and tourist strip around the West Marina, composed of 17 restaurants and cafes, 5 retail stores, 2 activity centers, a yachtclub and a boardwalk. The quayside restaurant strip is a prime destination in the city center with restaurants stretching along the Beirut Marina, from the site's western limit to the Yacht Club building on the east. The strip houses several international restaurant and cafe chains such as Paul, Moti Mahal Delux, H√§agen-Dazs, and The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, aside to many local outlets serving seafood, and Lebanese or French Cuisine. Zaitunay Bay is a joint venture between Solidere and Stow, and is designed by American architect Steven Holl, famous for projects such as the Simmons Hall at MIT and the Linked Hybrid complex in Beijing. The project is conceived as an urban beach, extending the existing Corniche Beirut and the new sea promenade in a series of overlapping platforms, reminiscent of sea waves, provide extensive outdoor spaces. These open public spaces in the Bay host cultural events, concerts, art exhibitions and a variety of seasonal celebrations. The one- floor construction remains below street level, with the roofs forming a continuation of the Corniche Beirut. The landscape design for the entry plaza, quayside and corniche sidewalk, create open-air terraces in the form of a ‚Äòstone beach‚Äô over the restaurants and shops. Zaitunay Bay is accessible to the general public with the promenade on the upper level linking the public sidewalk to the marina boardwalk in a vehicle-free environment accessible through 7 pedestrian access points with adjacent underground public parking facilities. The Yacht Club accommodates three basement levels; exclusive commercial shops at marina level; a yacht club and 53 state-of-the-art furnished and serviced apartments on the upper three levels, with one, two and three bedrooms. Two activity centers provide all sea-related services and water sports activities such as rentals for boats, yachts and jet-skis, fishing and scuba diving trips, boat rides, and water-skiing and para-sailing lessons. \\"Zaitunay\\", literally meaning olives, is the old name of the area in the pre-Lebanese Civil War era. Beirut International Exhibition & Leisure Center BIEL while hosting the Francophone Book Fair The Beirut International Exhibition & Leisure Center (BIEL) is a mixed-use center consisting of 82,000 square meters of multi-functional areas: 10,000 square meters of which is indoor column-free exhibition space, 25,000 square meters of outdoor exhibition space, a state-of-the-art conference center, a grand Ballroom and ample parking. BIEL hosts and caters for a wide array of events like professional trade exhibitions, public consumer shows, concerts, conferences, congresses and seminars, weddings and Gala dinners. The center also accommodates several music concerts with its capacity of 9,000 seated persons or 20,000 standing persons. The center is also equipped with 42000 square meters car parking capacity with Heavy Vehicle access. Pavilion Royal, adjacent to the main BIEL building; is a 2000 m¬≤ hall with an 8 m high ceiling and a 56m-glass Mediterranean-facing facade that can accommodate up to 1500-seated guests for weddings, gala dinners, cocktail receptions, corporate launchings, conferences and other events. BIEL also features 1200 square meters of underground multi-purpose conference halls: grand hall with a 9000 persons capacity, and two conference rooms with a 700 persons capacity each. Beirut Fitness Center The Beirut Fitness Center is developed by Solidere on a designated stretch within the New Waterfront District for temporary programs that are expected to operate for a period of 8‚Äì10 years. The aim behind the center is to establish activities that will generate new public destinations that connect to the planned central pedestrian spine, up to Beirut Souks and Rue Weygand. The center covers 8700 m2 serving up to 2000 members. A landscaped park is underway at a new reference level, 6 meters lower than the street level. Unlike conventional urban sports facilities and gyms, which are typically closed and contained within buildings, Beirut Fitness Center relies on its connection and exposure to outdoor spaces. The project develops around a 1260 m2 outdoor courtyard and 2 outdoor tennis courts of 1222 m2 located at the new reference level. Indoor activity spaces including fitness and aquatic zones, squash courts, reading rooms, and multipurpose spaces lie along the periphery of the outdoor courtyard and tennis courts separated only by clear glazed full-height operable panels. At this level, services including showers, lockers, treatment rooms and technical areas are inserted in a long narrow band along the north-south axis on the western side of the plot. The street level ground is highlighted by 5690 m2 of red epoxy finished concrete floor extending on the totality of the surface defining the open and permeable boundaries of the center, specifically in connection to the pedestrian spine on the eastern edge. There is no built mass on the ground level, only transparent planes 2.2 meters high that frame the courtyard and tennis courts below, allowing the public to overlook sports and related activities through the vertical open-air transparent facades. The automobiles‚Äô elliptical track and parking spots around the courts and the open voids frame the project's activities. The entrance and drop-off to the fitness center are accessed from the western side of the site and highlighted with a 40 m long portico.

Created in 1920, it occupies a wing of the building of the Polish National Museum as well as several branches in Poland. It's Warsaw's second largest museum and the largest collection of military objects in Poland. The collection illustrates a thousand years of Polish military history, from the 10th century to the Second World War. Establishment Decree about creation of Army Museum led by Bronis≈Çaw Gembarzewski Opened in 1920, the museum expanded in 1993 with the Museum of Katyn and the Museum of Polish Military Technology opened in the 9th Czerniakowski Fort. Collections Polish helmet (sz≈Çom), 10th century Karacena armour, 17th century M-3 Halftrack in front of the museum The forecourt of the museum houses several dozen armoured vehicles, artillery pieces and aircraft, an eclectic mix of Soviet, western and Polish equipment, mostly from the World War II era. The indoor galleries concentrate on the military history of Poland since the 10th century, and are particularly strong on Poland's era of military greatness in the 17th century, through the decline into anarchy in the 18th century. Several rooms are devoted to Poland's part in the Napoleonic Wars, and the national uprisings of 1830-31 and 1863. By far the largest part of exhibition space is devoted to the 20th century, especially World War II. Highlights of the Museum's collection include an extremely rare gilded helmet from the 10th century, which is said to have belonged to a Polish chieftain and the collection of hussars' armour. Additionally there is a permanent exhibition of oriental arms and armour from the museum's own extensive collection, which includes many world-class items from Ottoman Turkey, the Crimean Tatar Khanate, Mongolia and Japan. The heavy weaponry is on display in the adjacent park and at the Fort Czerniakowski (Museum of Polish Military Technology, closed at present while it is being repaired). The park surrounding the Museum is home to an open-air exhibition of heavy military equipment (tanks, artillery, aircraft and mine detection and diffusion). The Fort houses also the Museum of Katy≈Ñ Victims, a subsidiary of the Polish Army Museum. The museum was recently given the equipment from the soldiers lost in the Presidential Smolensk aircraft crash. The equipment includes the ID Passes, portable radios, torches, holsters and much more all in their original state. Permanent exhibitions * Polish Armed Forces in the Middle Ages * Polish Army at the Time of Renaissance * History of the Old Polish Military: 1576-1648 * Polish Army in the Second Half of the 17th Century * Polish Army in Saxon Times * Polish Army at the Time of the Enlightenment and the Kosciuszko Rising *Polish Legions in Italy and the Army of the Dukedom of Warsaw * The Army of the Kingdom of Poland and the November 1831 Rising * The January 1863 Rising * Polish Paramilitary Organisations of the Early 20th Century * The Roads to Independence: 1914-45 * The Polish Army: 1921-39 *Poland's Defence War of 1939 *The Armed Struggle in the Occupied Country: 1939-47 *Polish Army in the East: 1943-45 *UN Peace Missions of the Polish Army. The museum is run as a department of the Polish armed forces, an arrangement which brings advantages - such as limitless access to military surplus stock - but also disadvantages (not least the lack of a proper giftshop/bookshop, since, by law Polish military facilities cannot sell goods to the public on a commercial basis). New Building On December 15, 2008, the Museum of the Polish Army announced that it will sponsor an international competition to choose an architectural design for its new premises and surrounding area. The building will be built in the historic Citadel located in Warsaw's ≈ªoliborz district. The new museum is expected to be a modern multimedia institution similar in concept to the highly successful Warsaw Uprising Museum. The winner was expected to be selected in August 2009, construction of the museum was supposed to begin in 2009 or 2010 and completion due in 2013, however in early 2014, this still had not occurred.

They are the most modern of the so-called \\"Gotthard locomotives\\". Construction and Technology To reach the necessary tractive effort, a construction comprising six driven axles was necessary. In order to still get good running characteristics in curves, they were built into three two-axle bogies instead of two three-axle bogies as on the Ae 6/6. The middle bogie can move sideways, and the three bogies are connected by elastic cross couplings. Two of the four prototypes were built with a split locomotive body, whereby the joint may only move on an horizontal transverse axis, not on a vertical axis. The other two prototypes got a softer secondary suspension instead of the joint, which proved to be so reliable in everyday use that all series locomotives were built this way. Nevertheless, the two prototypes with a split body are still in regular operation. At time of construction, and nowadays still one of the world's most powerful locomotives, see List_of_largest_locomotives. The exterior design is similar to the Re 4/4II, as are the driver's controls and the conventional transformer technology with fixed running notches, which was applied for the last time for this locomotive. In contrast to the Re 4/4II, the Re 6/6 has two transformers (one power and one control transformer), which are mounted on the frame between the bogies. Due to the higher roof, the Re 6/6 looks more brawny than the Re 4/4II, especially when seen from the front side. Operations The Re 6/6 is equipped with multiple unit train control together with Re 4/4II, Re 4/4III, Re 4/4IV and RBe 540. In passenger traffic they pull heavy passenger trains over the Gotthard route (as an alternative to a double heading of Re 4/4). In freight traffic they are used all over Switzerland for heavy trains, on the Gotthard route very often together with an Re 4/4II or Re 4/4III. Such a couple, often referred to as \\"Re 10/10\\" (both locomotives are Re class, so the couple is Re class; 10/10 means that they overall have 10 driven axles out of 10), is capable of pulling the maximum train weight of on 2.6% gradients of the Gotthard line. For heavier trains, up to 1600 tons are operationally feasible; an additional bank engine has to help push the train in order not to overload the couplers. Locomotive 11638 was retired and scrapped in 1990 due to an accident. For the renumbering to the UIC-conforming new numbering scheme in 1992, only the still existing locomotives were considered, thus the 11638 got no new number any more. But the renumbering was never done consistently. During 2005, the UIC numbering scheme was reworked, and 620 001 (instead of 000) was defined to be the smallest number. To make things easy, the scrapped 11638 also got a new number, 620 038. About half a dozen locomotives bore the new numbers at the beginning of 2006. After two locomotives were tentatively equipped with radio remote control for pushing trains on the Gotthard line (such that the locomotive pushing at the end of the train may be controlled by the engineer at the front), about 30 locomotives were equipped with it in 2000. To make them administratively distinguishable, they got the new designation Ref 6/6. When SBB was divided into passenger services and freight, the first thirteen locomotives 11601‚Äì13 remained in the passenger division. On 1 January 2003 they were exchanged against Re 460. Now all remaining 88 locomotives are assigned to SBB Cargo. Due to the reassignment of the Re 460 to the passenger division, the Re 6/6 again dominate the freight traffic on the Gotthard line. The locomotives are assigned to the workshops Erstfeld, Bellinzona and Lausanne (Lausanne: 2000, today unknown), revisions are done at the main workshop at Bellinzona.

Located almost exactly halfway between Honduras' two largest cities of San Pedro Sula and Tegucigalpa, it is a major stopping point for rest and refreshment for Honduran and international inter-city traffic. The town is at the center of a regional vegetable and fruit production area, ensuring a year-round supply of fresh cheap produce. Climate The climate is mild. There are three seasons. During the wet and fairly cool season between May and November, enough rain falls in the area to ensure luxurious vegetation, while it escapes the excessive humidity of the far hotter and wetter lowland areas. A cooler interlude (November to February) provides seasonal contrast, with temperatures occasionally down to 8¬∞C (40¬∞F) as cold fronts enter from the north. This is followed by a dry season (February to May), with temperatures achieving a pleasantly warm peak of 32¬∞C (95¬∞F). Cool winds flow down from the local Calanterique forest and from the immense Cordillera Montecillos, a Biological Reserve on the southern edge of the valley. Even in the hot season air conditioning is unnecessary, with a fan almost always being enough. In the winter heating is rarely needed. History Founded by the Spanish in 1689 as a religious centre for retreats and monastic training, the population of the town grew through the intermarriage of colonists, the indigenous Lencas and the Mexican Nahuatl immigrants. The name Siguatepeque is made up of two words in Nahuatl, Cihuatl: Woman and Tepec:Mount, the mount of women. Siguatepeque is located more than 1,000 metres above the sea level. In 1861 the town became a municipality in its own right, and a city in 1926.

It is available either with or without beans. History of the brand In 1895, Lyman T. Davis of Corsicana, Texas sold \\"Lyman's Famous Chili\\" for five cents a bowl from the back of a wagon parked on the streets in downtown Corsicana, usually in front of the Blue Front Saloon on Beaton Street. Davis later began canning his chili and marketing it in the immediate area, produced by his company, Lyman's Pure Food Products. It was about that time that he adopted the brand name \\"Lyman's Famous Wolf Brand Chili,\\" a name in honor of his pet wolf, Kaiser Bill. In 1924, Lyman sold the Wolf brand to J. C. West and Fred Slauson who began expanding the area of distribution for the chili beyond Corsicana. Salesmen drove distinctive can-shaped trucks labeled with the chili's name, sometimes with Davis' pet wolf in a cage in the back. The vehicle not only provided practical transportation for company salesmen but also was an effective mobile advertisement for their products. During World War II, families from Texas sent cans of chili to their sons in service. As demand increased after the war, the factory added chili products such as hot dog sauce, turkey with beans and lean beef chili. In 1950, Fred Slauson, a gifted artist, sold his half of the company to Doyle and James West then moved to New Mexico to paint. In 1954 the Corsicana company expanded into interstate markets, having previously distributed its products only in Texas. In 1957 Quaker Oats of Chicago purchased Wolf Brand from then owners Doyle and James West. Quaker Oats continued to operate the Corsicana plant, continuing to use Davis's original recipe. In 1977 Wolf Brand, along with other chili manufacturers, successfully lobbied the Texas legislature to have chili proclaimed the official \\"state food\\" of Texas. In an effort to consolidate its operations, Quaker Oats closed the Corsicana plant in 1985 and merged its operations with another subsidiary, Stokley-Van Camp, in Dallas. ConAgra acquired Van Camp's and Wolf Brand from Quaker Oats in 1995. Davis died in 1954, Slauson in 1962, and West in 1963. All three are buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Corsicana. Doyle and Doris Newton West had two sons and a daughter: Conan Doyle West, Patricia Ann West and Jay Conrad West. James and Lois Toone West had three daughters, Dianne Sherrard West, Joanne Tinkle West and Bonnie Rebecca West. Doyle died in 1997 and James died in 2002. Slogan Wolf Brand Chili's trademarked slogan, \\"Neighbor, how long has it been since you had a big, thick, steaming bowl of Wolf Brand Chili? Well, that's too long!\\" is familiar to many Texans.

Founded in 1808, the school sits at the northern tip of Long Lake in North Bridgton, Maine. The school has been NEASC accredited since 1934, making it one of the oldest accredited schools in the country. The school is also a member of the National Association of Independent Schools. The campus hosts twenty four different buildings. The majority of classes are held in the new Humanities Center. There are seven dormitories on campus ranging in capacity from 18-40 students. In recent history, the school has expanded its number of two-year students, allowing for students to complete their high school diploma at Bridgton, as well as spending their second, prep, year at the Academy. History Cleaves Hall, pictured in the early 1900s Originally chartered when Maine was part of Massachusetts, Bridgton Academy submitted the articles of its incorporation by taking a horse and buggy all the way to Boston in 1806, and welcomed its first class in 1808. What was originally a 4-year, co- ed institution morphed into a boys-only school, and then finally a one-year preparatory school in the 1960s. From \\"A Brief History of Bridgton Academy\\" by Ernest N. Stevens (Class of 1899): \\"Bridgton was incorporated in 1794. It was still a small settlement. In 1800 it had only 646 inhabitants....The settlers in this whole region were chiefly from Massachusetts towns to the north of Boston, such as Andover, Boxford, Rowley and Newbury. They were largely of Puritan stock, of fair education themselves, and genuinely concerned about the education of their children. Within forty years from the original survey of the town and within twelve years of its incorporation they were talking of opening a secondary school. But the way was not easy. Massachusetts, within whose jurisdiction they then lived, would authorize no fly-by-night academies.\\" In 1806, three Bridgton citizens - Samuel Adams, Dr. Samuel Farnsworth and Enoch Perley - set about to raise the funds necessary to incorporate an Academy. The only question after their successful fundraising was where the school was to be located. At a stormy session held by the townsfolk and presided over by three trustees from neighboring academies, it was determined that the school would be located in North Bridgton because \\"...the natural beauty of the scenery was so great that it seemed that nature itself had designed that there should be a school in North Bridgton.\\" Beginning in 2013 the Bridgton Academy campus has undergone an extensive refurbishing, with major gardening and planting projects appearing throughout the campus, as well as new stonework, wrought iron gates, and paint and siding upgrades to every campus building. In 2018 major renovations were performed on Cleaves Hall, the school's largest residence hall. The entire interior was gutted, the floor plan was redesigned, and the building was completely updated.

Together with Franz Heinrich Kleinschmidt he set up the first Rhenish mission station to the Herero people in Gross Barmen. Hahn is known for his scientific work on the Herero language. Early life Hahn was born into a bourgeois family on 18 October 1818 in Aahof near Riga, Latvia. He studied Engineering at the Engineering School of the Russian Army from 1834 onwards but was not satisfied with that choice and, more generally, his parents' way of life. In 1837 he left ƒÄda≈æi (Aahof) for Barmen (today part of Wuppertal, Germany) to apply at the missionary school of the Rhenish Missionary Society. He was admitted to the Missionary School in Elberfeld (also part of Wuppertal today) in 1838 and graduated in 1841. Missionary work The Rhenish Missionary church in Otjimbingwe Hahn arrived in Cape Town on 13 October 1841. His orders were to bring Christianity to the Nama and the Herero in South-West Africa‚Äînot an easy task considering that both tribes were enemies at that time, albeit at peace from Christmas Day 1842 to 1846. He travelled to Windhoek (or as the locals called it then, «ÄAi«Ågams) in 1842 and was well received by Jonker Afrikaner, Captain of the Orlam Afrikaner tribe residing there. When in 1844 Wesleyan missionaries led by Richard Haddy arrived at the invitation of Jonker Afrikaner, Hahn and his colleague Franz Heinrich Kleinschmidt moved northwards into Damaraland in order to avoid conflict with them. Hahn and Kleinschmidt arrived at Otjikango on 31 October 1844. They named the place Barmen (today Gross Barmen) after the headquarters of the Rhenish Missionary Society in Germany and established the first Rhenish mission station to the Herero there. Hahn learned the language and taught gardening and animal husbandry, building a church in 1850 and attempting to evangelize. At that time Jonker Afrikaner oversaw the development of the road network in South-West Africa. Hahn and Kleinschmidt initiated the creation of a path from Windhoek to Barmen via Okahandja, and in 1850 this road, later known as Alter Baiweg (Old Bay Path), was extended via Otjimbingwe to Walvis Bay. This route served as an important trade connection between the coast and Windhoek until the end of the century. Their missionary work was not very successful, and in 1850, after a crushing Herero defeat at the hands of Jonker's Nama troops in Okahandja, the Herero fled the area. Hahn was recalled to Germany to report back, but was given new orders upon arrival in Cape Town in November 1852. Since Haddy had fled Windhoek in the wake of Jonker's raids, Hahn was tasked to fill the void, but he failed and returned to Germany, arriving in Barmen on September 13, 1853. He traveled Europe between 1853 and 1856 to gather support for his endeavors, which by then were considered futile by the Rhenish Missionary Society. He returned with the order to evangelize the people in Ovamboland, after a brief return to Otjimbingwe where some of the Herero had fled, but his four-month 1857 expedition with the Rev. Johannes Rath to the Ovambo at Ondangwa ended in a disaster, and the members barely escaped alive. Moreover, Gross Barmen was almost destroyed by then due to the skirmishes between Namas and Hereros. Hahn's next expedition took him, Rath, and Frederick Thomas Green to the banks of the Cunene River. His writing about the journey would later be published in the German travelogue Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen, in which his descriptions of northern Hereroland and the San language, territory, and culture corroborated Francis Galtons reports on Ovamboland. Hahn also included a description of the Etosha pan and collected animal specimens for the Natural History Museum, Berlin. A shortage of missionaries stymied the Rhenish Missionaries in Ovamboland, and Hahn himself returned to Germany in June 1859 to escape the Nama-Herero war, finding friends and support for the Rhenish Missionaries on a whirlwind tour of Germany, England, and Russia. After the Herero defeated the Nama on many occasions, missionary work was continued. Having turned down an offer to lead the Berlin Missionary Society in 1863, Hahn returned to Otjimbingwe in January 1864 and established a missionary station and a theological seminary there (which he named the Augustineum after St. Augustine of Hippo) to educate indigenous missionaries, this time recruiting German artisans and farmers to supply the settlement. In 1868, however, an attack by the Nama ended his hitherto successful project, and the Herero under chief Maharero fled the settlement to Okahandja and gave up their Christian affiliations. In 1870 Hahn brokered a ten-year peace deal between the Nama and the Herero and convinced the Finnish Missionary Society to take over missionary work in Ovamboland. When the Rhenish Missionary Society began trading for profit and colonizing (rejecting his Lutheran austerity for a more Reformed Church orientation), Hahn severed his ties with them March 4, 1872 and returned in 1873 to Germany, by which time 13 missions in Hereroland were prospering. He relocated to the Cape Colony. For the next twelve years, Hahn served as pastor of the German Lutheran congregation (St. Martini) in Cape Town. Assisted from 1875 onward by his son (the Rev. C.H. Hahn, Jr.), ministering to a growing population of poorly educated and largely illiterate German settlers in the Cape Flats (arriving largely between 1877 and 1884). During his tenure, he helped found the German International School Cape Town, pay off the debts from the building of St. Martini's church on Long Street, build a parsonage, and spin off daughter churches in Paarl and Worcester. After failed efforts by Cape Colony to make South West Africa a British protectorate, the Nama-Herero war sparked anew on the \\"bloody night\\" of August 23, 1880. When, at the end of 1881, a Herero attack was rumored to have occurred on the Cape magistracy in Walvis Bay, Hahn pleaded the Herero's case and urged restraint by colonial authorities in a letter published in the Cape Times on January 13, 1882. From 1882 until his retirement in 1884 he was the Cape Government's \\"Special Commissioner for the Walwich Bay Territory\\", traveling there at the behest of Commissioner Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead and attempting to restore peace to South West Africa in talks with Maharero in Okahandja (February 17-18, 1882). Apart from a treaty between the Swartbooi Nama and the Herero, Hahn was unsuccessful and recommended in his March 1882 report to the Cape government that the Walvis Bay area be maintained as British territory. Linguistic works Title page of Biblical History in Herero language, compiled and translated by Carl Hugo Hahn and printed in 1861. While in Gross Barmen, Hahn learned to speak Otjiherero (first gaining the ability to preach in the language on January 29, 1847) and translated the New Testament and other religious texts into the language of the natives. As early as 1846, he compiled the first Rhenish Missionary prayer book in Herero, and together with Rath, he released a collection of biblical stories and hymns translated into the language under the title Ornahungi oa embo ra Jehova in 1849. Additional prayer books in 1861 and 1871 book-ended his 1864 output of two further biblical narratives, a copy of Luther's Small Catechism, and a 32-song hymnal. Highlights of the Old Testament and the aforementioned complete NT began the work that Peter Heinrich Brincker and others would complete. Hahn also drafted W.H.I. Bleek's unpublished grammar of Otjiherero (Entwurf einer Grammatik der Herero Sprache, 1854) , ultimately delivering his own version to Riga in December 1854, and published its first dictionary, Grundz√ºge einer Grammatik des Herero (im Westlichen Afrika) nebst einem W√∂rterbuche (Berlin/London, 1857) through the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences. The latter, including a comprehensive grammar and a Herero-German dictionary of 4,300 words, was the first publication using Standard Alphabet by Richard Lepsius, eventually causing much consternation over its suitability for transcribing a Bantu language. During his visit to Germany in 1873/74, University of Leipzig awarded a Doctor degree honoris causa to Hahn for his research on the language of the Herero, although his domestic servant and interpreter, Urieta (Johanna Gertze) probably had a more than cursory role in the creation of his language studies and publications. Family life Carl Hugo Hahn married his wife Emma (n√©e Hone, daughter of William Hone) on 3 October 1843, on home leave in Cape Town. They had at least five children, including two daughters (Margaritha, wife of Carl Heinrich Beiderbecke since their marriage on November 24, 1875; and Eloisa) and three sons (including William Heinrich Josaphat, Carl Hugo Jr., and Traugott). While Carl Sr. ministered in South-West Africa, his children attended school in G√ºtersloh. Emma died on April 14, 1880 in Cape Town, after which he visited Germany for a short while. After his retirement for health reasons in 1884, Hahn visited Margaritha in the United States, and later lived with his son, Carl Jr. in Paarl, then minister of St. Petri's Lutheran Church there. Traugott worked in the Lutheran Church in Livonia, and several of his descendants became theologians and clerics in Germany. Carl Hugo Hahn, Sr., died in Cape Town on 24 November 1895 and is buried at St. Petri in Paarl.

As with most of the early E class boats, E18 was not fitted with a deck gun during construction but later had a 12-pounder QF gun mounted forward of the conning tower. She had five 18 inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, two in the bow, one either side amidships, and one in the stern; a total of 10 torpedoes were carried. E-Class submarines had wireless systems with power ratings; in some submarines, these were later upgraded to systems by removing a midship torpedo tube. Their maximum design depth was although in service some reached depths of below . Some submarines contained Fessenden oscillator systems. Crew Her complement was three officers and 28 men. Service history= 1915  E18 entered service in the UK in 1915, commanded by Lieutenant-Commander R.C. Halahan. She joined HMS Maidstone on 25 June 1915 and soon began North Sea patrols with the 8th Flotilla at Harwich. On her one and only patrol prior to leaving for the Baltic E18 departed Yarmouth with D7 and E13 on 9 July 1915. On 14 July 1915 when at the mouth of the Ems deep in enemy waters Halahan brought E18 to the surface as he preferred the sea to using the toilet arrangements on board. While in this awkward situation a Zeppelin appeared, E18 dived to the sea bed but was easily visible from the air. E18 was then straddled with 12 bombs which caused no damage other than some embarrassment to Halahan in being caught unawares. The fact E18 was surfaced wasn't passed on via Halahan's patrol report, he stated he was submerged at 20 ft, and an inquiry into submarine visibility from the air led E18 being painted in her camouflage scheme. Strangely there is no German claim of an attack on a submarine - the Zeppelins in the air that day in this area were, L4, L6 and L7, none of which sighted a submarine let alone attacked one. L6 was the closest to E18s position when a Zeppelin was sighted but she moved away to the west when the explosions occurred. German minesweeping divisions were exploding mines during the time of the alleged attack which could explain what the crew of E18 heard while submerged. E18 was dispatched to the Baltic as part of the British submarine flotilla in the Baltic. She left Harwich on 28 August with her sister-ship HMS E19, first travelling to Newcastle to swing their compasses during which E19 burnt out one of her main armatures. After the delay to repair E19 they left Newcastle for the Baltic on 4 September at 1630 hrs. The two submarines separated and passed through the √òresund between Denmark and Sweden on the night of 8‚Äì9 September. During the passage E19 at one stage found herself only metres from E18s stern and decided not to enter together. E18 encountered two German destroyers. She dived into water only deep and ‚Äî for almost three hours ‚Äî progressed by crashing into the seabed and rising back up to break the surface. After several hours resting in deep water she surfaced in the morning only to be fired on by the cruiser Amazone; once again she dived to the bottom. The German cruiser and attending destroyers then began to criss-cross over E18 knowing her batteries would be very low. E18 had to remain on the bottom until the German ships, not then equipped with depth charges, left the area. After escaping she was attacked by another two destroyers, one of which came close to ramming her. On 10 September 1915 Halahan sighted what he thought were the German battlecruisers Lutzow and Seydlitz, and tried in vain to get into an attacking position, but in fact the ships were two German destroyers, the battlecruisers not in the area at the time. On 12 September E18 joined E19 and E9 off Dagerort, arriving in Reval (now Tallinn, Estonia) on the 13th. Halahan later wrote that entering the Baltic again should not be attempted unless absolutely necessary. E18 operated out of Reval through the autumn of 1915, departing on her first Baltic patrol on 21 September 1915. The following day she was in an excellent position to torpedo the German cruiser Bremen, but a surfaced Russian submarine caused the Bremen to turn away just as E18 was about to fire and the opportunity was lost; she returned to Reval on 29 September.Forgotten Flotilla, Leslie Ashmore On 9 October 1915 E18 departed for her second patrol, by 12 October she was in position to attack the pre-dreadnought SMS Braunschweig whilst off Libau (now LiepƒÅja, Latvia), but her torpedo tube bow caps could not be opened. She then tried her beam tube but was forced to dive by German destroyers. When she did manage to fire a torpedo from her stern tube, the range was too great. She returned to Reval on 16 October.Baltic assignment: British Submariners in Russia 1914-1919, Michael Wilson. 1985 E18 departed Reval on 9 November 1915 to patrol the Swedish trade routes, returning on 15 November having sighted nothing of significance. During this patrol the crew had missed the visit of the Tzar. Her fourth and final patrol of 1915 was off Libau and try to find a way through the minefields by following the courses of German traffic. She departed for this patrol on 30 November and returned on 4 December.  1916  E18 left for her fifth patrol on 6 January 1916, her orders were to patrol the area between the Sound and Bornholm. Attempts were made to recall her, as the patrol had been cancelled but she did not reply. On returning, she encountered gale-force winds and icy conditions to the point where she had difficulty closing her conning tower hatch owing to ice. She was unable to return to Reval on her own and had to wait for the Finnish ice breaker Sampo to arrive and guide her in, completely iced over. The British submarines remained iced-in and could not move until April. Although she did not sail, E18 was made ready for sea by 13 February, and was the first of the British submarines to sail on 29 March after the freeze. E18 resumed patrols on 28 April, her penultimate patrol to the Gulf of Riga with HMS E1, to show their presence to the Germans, this was achieved by diving twice while Russian destroyers shelled beaches. While returning to Reval via Moon Sound on 1 May, E18 ran aground and had to be towed off. In late May, E18 sailed on her final patrol; E1, E8, and two Russian submarines left the same day. Records differ on her exact fate, but it is certain neither she nor any of her crew survived. The diary of Francis Goodhart, commander of E8, states that E1 and the Russian Bars departed at 1400 hrs, E8, E18 and the Russian Gerpard left port together at 1800 hrs on 25 May; E8 's patrol was uneventful, and she returned to Reval on the 31st. However, E18 failed to return; by 5 June Goodhart noted that the crews were \\"very worried\\". On the 6th, he noted that he had \\"Heard from Essen that their W.T. had vaguely indicated presence of a submarine off Redshoff\\"There does not appear to be a place called \\"Redshoff\\"; it may be a mishearing of Kurisches Haff, a German term for the Curonian Lagoon south of Memel/Klaipƒóda on Tuesdayi.e. 30 May 1916. Very slender hope...\\" By the next day, 8 June, he recorded that a meeting had noted she had sailed with only 15 days food; the situation was \\"very hopeless now, I fear. No news whatsoever\\" By the 9 June E8's officers began collecting the belongings of E18's Halahan, Landale and Colson from their cabins.Diary of Francis Goodhart, published in Imperial War Museum Review no. 9 Michael Wilson, a historian, records that E8 and E18 sailed on the 25th and parted the next day. On the 26th, at 4:42 PM, E18 torpedoed the German destroyer V100, blowing off her bow. Had it not been for the calm seas, it is likely she would have sunk from the damage; as it was, she was towed back to port with several of her crew killed, requiring major repairs. Two days later, on the 28th, E18 was sighted by a German aircraft off Memel (now Klaipƒóda, Lithuania), E18 was last sighted on the 1 June 1916 at 1500 hrs sailing north by the German U-boat UB-30 northwest of Steinort. Wilson further states that it is believed she was lost \\"most likely by striking a mine\\" on her return to Reval west of Osel. The logs of the German destroyers with V100 also support the same dates as Goodhart's diary and Wilson's observations. Various sources record her simply as having been sunk on 24 May by a German decoy ship,For example, a footnote by the editor of Goodhart's diary, which gives her as \\"sunk off Bornholm\\". The German ship is sometimes named as KE41; naval-history.net refers simply to \\"decoy ship K\\". though this clashes with the known attack on V100 on the 26th and the observations reported by Wilson and Goodhart in subsequent days. It is quite possible that this is a garbling of an encounter between one of the Russian submarines and a decoy vessel around the same time. The German decoy ship Kronprinz Wilhelm (known as Schiff KSee SMS Schiff K at German Wikipedia) did attack two submarines during E18s patrol in May. K rammed the Russian Gerpard and the following day took the Russian Bars under fire in Hano Bay. The Germans believed they had sunk both submarines; E18 was not in the area of these actions. Tsar Nicholas II sent a telegram of condolence on the loss of E18, and posthumously decorated the crew; Halahan awarded the Order of St. George, the other two officers the Order of St. Vladimir. These Orders were not normally awarded posthumously. Three of E18s crew did not sail on her last mission; one, Jeremiah Ryan had measles and later transferred to E19; another, Albert Phillips, missed her patrol for unknown reasons. The third was signalman Albert Edward Robinson who was replaced on this mission by E8s telegraphist George Gaby; he was later sent home in January 1917 and joined E4 on her recommissioning. Ryan and Phillips went home in January 1918. NB: 11 June 1916 is stated on the crew's papers as the date of being 'lost at sea', purely for administration purposes to close the books on E18, as the timing and circumstances of E18s loss were unknown. Discovery of the wreck, 2009 In October 2009, the wreck of HMS E18 was discovered by a ROV deployed by the Swedish survey vessel MV Triad. The position of the wreck lies off the coast of Hiiumaa, Estonia. Photographs taken of the wreck show the submarine with its hatch open, suggesting that it struck a mine while sailing on the surface.

The initial phase of the battle consisted of two and a half weeks of intense bombardment by air and artillery, followed by more than two weeks of intensive fighting in and around the town. The IDF failed to capture the town and suffered relatively heavy casualties in the process.Final Winograd report, p. 318  Background  On 12 July 2006, under the cover of mortar and rocket fire directed at Israeli communities and IDF positions, forces belonging to the Islamic Resistance launched a cross border raid into Israeli territory, killing three Israeli soldiers and abducting two, Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev. The abductors apparently headed for the town of Ayta ash-Sha'b, less than a kilometer from the site of the abduction. Nir Rosen writes that Ayta ash-Sha'b was defended by approximately 100 fighters, mainly local inhabitants. Some of the defenders of the town were not members of the Islamic Resistance or even of Hizbullah. According to Andrew Exum, the majority of the fighters were not \\"regular Hizballah fighters\\".Exum, pp.9‚Äì10 Blanford agrees that most the fighters were local residents, but that they were \\"no second-rate home guard. They were battle-hardened veterans,‚Ä¶ many of them with specialist training in anti-armor missiles and sniping.\\"Blanford, p.70 According to a study supported by Israeli authorities, Hizbullah‚Äôs military infrastructure in the village consisted of 60‚Äì70 Hizbullah operatives.  The battle  Ayta ash-Sha'b and other Lebanese border villages and Hizbullah outposts were immediately subjected to bombardment from aircraft and artillery, plus attack helicopters supporting Israeli ground forces. This would continue almost daily throughout the war.Arkin, p. 86 On the first day the IDF declared, somewhat optimistically, that \\"all Hezbollah outposts along the border were destroyed.\\" First attempted incursion Less than two hours after the capture of the two soldiers, the IDF sent a force of tanks and armored personnel carriers across the border following a dirt track, through an olive grove called Khallat al- Warda, leading to Ayta ash-Sha'b. The force was ordered to capture a Hizbullah post and to take control of the exit roads from the town, in case the abducted soldiers were still there. Only 70 meters into Lebanese territory, a Merkava heavy battle tank drove over a remote-controlled mine. The tank was destroyed and its four crewmen were killed instantly, and the mission to capture the access roads to the town was quickly abandoned. Hizbullah fire prevented the extraction of the destroyed tank and the remains of the four soldiers just inside Lebanese territory for several days. A fifth soldier was killed and two soldiers wounded in the effort.Harel and Issacharoff 2008, p.12 Defence Minister Amir Peretz, who watched the tank exploding live on his monitor, was stunned. It was later described as the \\"Zidane effect\\"Referring to an incident in the 2006 World Cup final in which as Italian player insulted Zinedine Zidane who responded by headbutting him. that cemented Israel's resolve towards going to war.Shelah and Limor 2007, Chapter 1 Second attempted incursion On the evening of 12 July, IDF Northern Command contemplated sending paratroopers to Ayta ash-Sha'b \\"to conduct arrests\\". This was postponed because of a lack of intelligence,Harel and Issacharoff 2008, p.270 but during the first week fighting was limited to exchanges of fire over the border. The original plan deemed it unnecessary to occupy Lebanese territory to rid the border of Hizbullah. Israel used the air force, both aircraft and attack helicopters, and artillery fire. The Lebanese fighters fired rockets, guided missiles, mortars, Katyusha rockets and heavy machine guns at Israeli towns and positions.Arkin p. 89 According to Yedioth Ahronoth more than 300 rockets were fired from the area during the war. The headquarters of the 91st Division at Biranit just across the border from Ayta ash-Sha'b was subjected to a \\"hard and extremely accurate\\" attack by Katyusha rockets. The Command bunker received a direct hit destroying the generator and cutting off light and air supply to the facility. Only the dim lights of cell phones could be seen when terrified Israeli soldiers called home.Rapaport (2007), chapter 3: Rubber stamp According to Islamic Resistance commanders the fighters suffered no casualties during this period. On 14 July the civilian inhabitants of the town were warned through loudspeakers to evacuate the town. The great majority of the population therefore left. About a week into the war the IDF resumed ground operations around Ayta ash-Sha'b, with nightly incursions by foot, mainly around the Old Quarter in the west and the northern sections of the town, such as the Abu Tawil hill. These incursions were described by Arkin as \\"probes\\" and probably served mainly to gather intelligence.Biddle and Friedman, p. 31 On the 19th, Northern Command launched a simultaneous attack on the border communities of Maroun ar-Ras, Marwahin and Ayta ash-Sha'b. The attack on Maroun ar-Ras failed, sustaining a number of casualties, and the forces about to attack Ayta ash-Sha'b were called back at the last moment. Decision to create a Security Zone Two weeks into the war it was clear that the Israeli strategy was not working. In late July the Israeli cabinet therefore approved Operation \\"Operation Web of Steel 4\\" (later renamed Operation Change of Direction 8), designed to take control of a \\"security zone\\", 6‚Äì8 kilometers wide, along the border. Reserves were called up and eight brigades amassed on the Israeli-Lebanese border.Biddle and Friedman, p. 32 On 31 July paratroopers effectively surrounded Ayta ash-Sha'b with the intention of driving out the Hizbullah. They were met with fierce resistance. On the next day they advanced on the town from two directions. One company- sized unit was advancing into the eastern Abu Laban quarter. The troops were discovered by Lebanese forces, which after several hours of fighting forced the Israelis to retreat. During this fight Hizbullah suffered its first fatality, Younis Surour. The other force, the 890th Paratrooper Battalion, attacked the Old Town from the north and advanced towards the mosque. The battalion came under fire, and its forces got separated as they took cover. Israeli soldiers were shocked by the ferocity of the fire and several stopped functioning. The attack was aborted and reinforcements were called in to extract dead, wounded and shell-shocked soldiers. According to Hizbullah, another Lebanese fighter, Hisham as-Sayyid, was killed while pursuing the retreating Israelis. Three Israeli soldiers, including an officer, were killed and at least 25 were wounded. The IDF had claimed that 15 Hizbullah guerrillas had been killed in the clash, though Hizbullah claimed it only lost two fighters. Israeli injured had to be carried by their comrades, under Hizbullah fire, back to the Israeli border. It took the wounded a whole day to reach the hospital in Nahariya. The Paratroopers were originally supposed to move north the following day but because of the casualties sustained, they were ordered to remain in the vicinity of the town.Final Winograd Report, p. 145 Defense Minister Amir Peretz expressed his growing frustration at the slow progress IDF was making to his senior officers: \\"It's infuriating ‚Äì we're circling Ayta al-Shaab for the third time already.\\"Final Winograd Report, p. 144 Continued street fighting On 2 August, \\"harsh battles\\" were reported inside the town. One Israeli paratrooper was reported killed and nine wounded. On the same day, an Israeli force surrounded a house in the northern Abu Tawil section of the town. When the house was searched two Hizbullah fighters hiding in the house were discovered and taken prisoner. Israeli media reports were still upbeat and reported that the IDF during the day was \\"set to complete its deployment\\" in a 5‚Äì6 kilometers wide \\"security zone\\" along the Lebanese border, all the way between Metula and Rosh Hanikra. Ayta ash-Sha'b, less than a kilometer from the border, was going to prove a much more difficult nut to crack than expected. The Hizbullah fighters generally fought from well- protected positions. A Hizbullah fighter told Lebanese daily as-Safir after the war how close the Israeli soldiers and Hizbullah guerrillas were, sometimes separated only by an alley or a destroyed house. The first time he saw Israeli soldiers he could not believe his eyes: \\"They were so close that sometimes our units would overlap theirs\\". The Israeli soldiers would advance into a neighborhood and seek cover in a building when exposed to fire. The fighters would then target the building with remote-controlled missiles or rocket-propelled grenades. Most of the casualties sustained by the IDF were caused by rockets or missiles. When Israeli forces retreated the fighters would generally take cover in tunnels or shelters to avoid the shelling or bombardment from the air that would usually follow. When the shelling stopped the fighters would emerge to face the expected Israeli advance. In one case, three Hizbullah fighters took cover in a shelter during an air raid. The shelter received a direct hit and collapsed, killing them. Their bodies could not be recovered for 10 days. Another Hizbullah fighter also became one of the first Lebanese killed by a drone strike during the war. In spite of the substantial losses, IDF officials denied that there was any intention of withdrawing from the village, without \\"a clear surrender\\" of Hizbullah, because it was major stronghold and considered a \\"symbol of the determination\\" of the movement. One soldier from the Carmeli brigade was killed and at least 19 were wounded in further heavy clashes in Ayta ash-Sha'b on 5 August. The losses precipitated a much criticized withdrawal of the reserve brigade from the village. On 6 August, the Defence Minister again expressed his dissatisfaction over the army‚Äôs inability to conquer Ayta ash-Sha'b.Final Winograd Report, p. 164 The orders to the IDF to quickly occupy Ayta ash-Sha'b were repeated several times over the coming days.Final Winograd Report, pp. 162, 169, 193 A negotiating team that had been sent to the town to negotiate a peaceful surrender of its defenders returned empty handed on 7 August.Final Winograd Report, p. 173  Fighting spreads to Dibil and al-Qawzah  Israeli forces eventually bypassed Ayta ash-Sha'b and started pushing northward towards the villages of al-Qawzah and Dibil, a few kilometers to the north of the town. Both of the villages were Christian and Hizbullah probably maintained a minimal presence there. The front line was thereby \\"extended from ash-Shomera-Zar‚Äôit [in Israel], over Khallat Warda [near the border] and reaching al-Qawzah and Dibil‚Äù. A heavy PUMA APC was hit by a missile in the village of Dibil on 7 August, killing one soldier and injuring five others. 9 August, a large IDF force was discovered by Hizbullah scouts while advancing from al-Qawzah towards Dibil. Local headquarters were alerted and the Israeli force was subjected to artillery and mortar fire, near the Dibil public swimming pool, from positions outside Ayta ash-Sha'b. Hizbullah did not maintain artillery inside the town. An Israeli unit, belonging to the 8219th Engineering Battalion, took up positions in a house on the outskirts of Dibil. The house was hit by two anti-tank missiles fired from Ayta ash-Sha'b (about 4 kilometers away) and the building collapsed.Final Winograd Report, p. 185 Nine soldiers were killed and 31 wounded, many of whom were buried under the ruins. Among those killed were Major Natan Yahav, the only senior IDF officer to die in the battle of Ayta ash-Sha'b. The incident was dubbed \\"The House of Death\\". Survivors later expressed bitterness at the IDF command, whose \\"incompetence and stupidity\\" contributed to the high number of casualties. \\"In Debel, those nine guys never even had a chance to shoot a single bullet.\\" The casualties had to be carried on stretchers back to Israel. The same day, a Merkava tank was hit by a missile, fired from close range in Ayta ash-Sha'b. The tank turret was blown off and the tank caught fire. Its four crewmen were killed instantly. On 10 August, IDF claims to have killed three Hizbullah fighters in Ayta ash-Sha'b.IDF: We drew lessons Ceasefire On 9 August, General Eisenkott had to inform the government that the army had failed to capture Ayta ash-Sha'b. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert demanded an explanation. Less than three days before the ceasefire Operation Changing Direction 11 was launched with the aim of pushing further into Lebanese territory. About a dozen Israeli soldiers died in the fighting around the villages of Haddatha, Yatar, at-Tiri, Rashaf and Ayta az-Zut, well to the north of Ayta ash-Sha'b. There are no reports of any offensive Israeli action against Hizbullah positions in the town itself. On the last day of the fighting, an IDF infantry force at the Abu Tawil hill in the northern part of the town was hit by an anti-tank missile. Four soldiers were killed and 20 wounded. By the time the cease-fire took effect on the morning of 14 August the IDF apparently had abandoned all its positions inside Ayta a-Sha'b. Blanford notes: \\"On the first day of the ceasefire, it was possible to reach [Aita ash-Sha'b]‚Ä¶ which lay behind the IDF‚Äôs frontline positions in Haddatha, Rashaf and Yatar without even seeing a single IDF soldier.\\"Blanford, p.72 A camera team from al-Jazeera reached the village and interviewed a Hizbullah fighter a few hours after the ceasefire took effect.  Aftermath  The Israeli army never occupied Ayta ash-Sha'b. According to Harel and Issacharoff, the town became \\"a symbol of Israel's performance in the war, the village where it all began, where the IDF thrashed about for four weeks and never succeeded in taking.\\" Exum described Hizbullah's \\"tenacity\\" in the defense of the border villages as \\"the biggest surprise of the war\\" and the performance of the village units as \\"exceptional\\". The Carmeli Brigade pulled a battalion out of the town, after one of its soldiers was killed, in what was described as a \\"tactical retreat\\".Harel and Issacharoff 2008, p. 177 The performance of the Carmeli Brigade was afterwards singled out (together with another unit, the 366th Division) for particular harsh criticism. It displayed a \\"lack of determination, an unnecessary retreat and a misunderstanding of the bigger picture. Much of the blame was placed on the top brass, but the [two] brigades were left thoroughly shaken by the war.\\" After the war a committee, headed by Col. (res) Yoram Yair, sharply criticized the conduct of 91st Division during the war, including the battle of Ayta ash-Sha'b. The battle was called \\"the black hole of the war\\".Shelah and Limor 2007, p 237 Brig.-Gen. Gal Hirsch, the commanding officer under which the Carmeli Brigade served during the war, was fired a few months after the war. The commander of the Northern Command, Gen. Udi Adam, was practically fired already on 8 Aug, after the repeated failures to capture Bint Jbeil and Ayta ash-Sha'b. Chief of Staff Halutz sent his deputy, Maj.-Gen. Moshe Kaplinsky, to Northern Command, to serve as his \\"coordinator\\" beside Adam. Adam formally resigned from the army in September. Chief of Staff Dan Halutz himself resigned in January 2007.Harel and Issacharoff 2008, pp. 242‚Äì243 Veteran Israeli war correspondent Ron Ben-Yishai claimed that the problem was not limited to the commanding officers. He claimed that a \\"crybaby culture\\" had developed among the soldiers of the Israeli army. Almost every Israeli offensive operation in the war, including those in Ayta ash-Sha'b, were called off as soon as resistance was encountered and casualties were sustained, even though IDF in almost every clash enjoyed superiority, both in terms of numbers and firepower. Soldiers often abandoned their missions and focused all efforts on evacuating casualties from the battlefield rather than continuing to pursue their objectives. Gilad Sharon asked in a column in Yedioth Ahronoth after the war: \\"How could it be that after a month of war, our soldiers were still being wounded among the still- standing houses of the village of Aita al-Shaab, hundreds of meters from the location of the abduction that sparked the war?\\"  Casualties  The Municipality of Ayta ash-Sha‚Äôb published a casualty list that included the names of 11 Hizbullah fighters who were killed in the battle of Ayta ash- Sha‚Äôb. Eight of these were locals and three were from other localities in Lebanon. Another Ayta resident, Commander Muhammad Wahbi Surour, was also named as a ‚Äúmartyr of Ayta‚Äù, but he died in the fighting around the village of Barish further to the north. These numbers were largely confirmed by other sources: Journalist Simon Assaf (eight locals), The Washington Post (eight locals), Nir Rosen and Hannah Alam of McClatchy (nine locals) and Yedioth Ahronoth (\\"around ten\\" locals). The IDF, on the other hand, claimed that 40 Hizbullah guerrillas were killed in the battle. Another eleven fighters were wounded. The town also suffered eight \\"civilian martyrs\\". Two Hizbullah fighters were taken prisoner by the IDF during the battle of Ayta ash-Sha'b. The captured fighters were not recognized as prisoners-of-war. In September 2006 the two prisoners were put on trial, together with a third prisoner, Mahir Kourani, who was captured a few days later at the village of Shihin. The three were accused of a long series of criminal offenses, including \\"providing service to an illegal association,\\" \\"weapons training in Iran and Lebanon without government permission,\\" \\"conspiracy to commit a crime,\\" and \\"conspiracy to commit murder\\" as well as participation in the kidnapping and attempted kidnapping of Israeli soldiers. Before the trial was concluded the three prisoners (including the fourth prisoner, Khadr Zaidan, who was captured at al-Ghandouriya) were released in the 2008 prisoner exchange. According to a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, only 100 of the 1300 houses in the town remained after the war. In spite of the widespread destruction in Ayta ash-Sha'b, there were surprisingly few civilian casualties. According to Lebanese sources only eight civilian residents were killed in the war. The main reason for this seems to have been that the great majority of the civilian population had been evacuated from the town early in the conflict. According to a Human Rights Watch report two of the civilian fatalities were actually killed outside the town. On 19 July Zaynab Salah Jawad, aged 7, and her brother Kawthar, 4, were killed when a 155 mm artillery shell struck the private home in the nearby Christian village of Rumaysh, where the family had sought refuge after being evacuated from Ayta ash- Sha'b.HRW (2007) p. 170 (The two siblings first names are given as Zainab and Qawsar in the report, instead of Safa and Kawthar.) One man was killed 20 July by an missile fired by a helicopter.HRW (2007) p. 107 An elderly couple and their son in his forties were killed the day after when their home was destroyed by an air strike.HRW (2007) p. 108 The IDF announced that 28 Israeli soldiers, five of them officers, were killed in 33 days of fighting in and around the town (including five at the border on 12 July, thirteen inside the town and ten in the nearby village of Dibil).

Waste autoclaves process waste either in batches or in continuous-flow processes. In batch processes, saturated steam is pumped into the autoclave at temperatures around 160 ¬∞C.Fibrecycle Process Environment Agency Waste Technology Data Centre Evaluation of Estech Fibrecycle Process The steam pressure in the vessel is maintained up to 6 bar (gauge) for a period of up to 45 minutes to allow the process to fully 'cook' the waste. The autoclave process gives a very high pathogen and virus kill rate, although the fibrous products which come from the process are susceptible to bacteria and fungus as they are high in starch, cellulose and amino acids. Some autoclaves, also referred to as waste converters, can operate in the atmospheric pressure range to achieve full sterilization of pathogenic waste. Super heating conditions and steam generation are achieved by variable pressure control, which cycles between ambient and negative pressure within the sterilization vessel. The advantage of this new approach is the elimination of complexities associated with operating pressure vessels. However, steam that is not 97% saturated may not contain sufficient energy to kill the spores that may be on the surface of the items it comes in contact with. Process results In \\"batch system\\" autoclave processes, the 'cooking' process causes plastics to soften and flatten, paper and other fibrous material to disintegrate into a fibrous mass, bottles and metal objects to be cleaned, and labels etc., to be removed. The process reduces the bulk volume of the waste by ~60%. After 'cooking', the steam flow is stopped and the pressure vented via a condenser. When depressurised, the autoclave door is opened, and by rotating the drum the 'cooked' material can be discharged and separated by a series of screens and recovery systems. In continuous flow autoclave processes, glass, stones, and metals are removed from the waste stream before the \\"cooking\\" process begins, thus saving considerable energy, labor and equipment costs. With this process, waste enters and the product leaves the autoclave without the loss of temperature or pressure in the vessel. The material moves continuously through the process via computer-controlled process conveyors. After the waste is loaded onto the initial conveyor, the entire process is automated and it does not require human intervention to clean the inside of the vessel. In early systems, the primary product was cellulose fibres. This comprises the putrescible (rottable), cellulose and lignin elements of the waste stream. The fibres can be fed into anaerobic digesters to reduce the biodegradability of the waste and to produce biogas. Alternatively the fibre could be used as biofuel. Some systems claim to wash out hydrolysed hemicellulose sugars and most of the protein as water-solubles. The remaining materials, after simple physical separation (trommel screen) has several valuable uses. One system claims to be able to dry the cellulose during processing using heat, and another system is able to dry the cellulose (much more economically) using pressure and steam kinetics. After fibre separation, the secondary streams consist of mixed plastics, which have normally been softened and deformed which eases separation, a glass and aggregate stream, separate ferrous and non-ferrous metals. The heat, steam and rotating action of the autoclave vessel strip off labels and glues from food cans leaving a very high quality ferrous/non-ferrous stream for recycling. With the removal of water, fibre, metals, and much of the plastics, the residual waste stream for disposal may be less than 10% by weight of the original stream, and is essentially devoid of materials that decompose to produce methane. Systems in Europe meet and exceed all of the European waste treatment and recycling requirements. The full process of loading, treatment and sorting is typically completed within 90 minutes. In a typical batch-type configuration, 2 10-ton units operating side by side would treat 440 tons per day with time for preventative maintenance. Continuous flow systems are modular and are specifically designed to match the necessary capacity. The size of the vessel varies between vendors. Experience shows that \\"small\\" vessels are not productive enough; while if the vessel is too large, the heavy weight of the vessel may cause equipment failures. Commercial application ECOHISP√ÅNICA has developed and built a municipal solid waste treatment plant based on an autoclaves system called \\"Waste Cleaner\\". It is the first system able to process municipal solid waste (MSW) in continuous mode. The plant is able to process up to 40.000 tons per year without previous selection, and the system has been internationally patented by ECOHISP√ÅNICA. The process applies water steam, pressure, temperature, and some internal movement. In about 20 minutes, the main part of the garbage (organic matter), is converted into a kind of biomass that is storable, valid for composting, gassification, or power generation (the calorific power is about 3.500 kcal/kg). The rest of the materials, like plastics or metals, can be selected once the garbage has been processed into the Waste Cleaner. This technology reduces the volume of the garbage by more than 80% and takes around 20 minutes. The plant of ECOHISP√ÅNICA is located in the city of Rivas Vaciamadrid (Madrid). Visits from more than 80 countries have been received in the Plant in the last 2 years. ECOHISP√ÅNICA is releasing the Waste Cleaner to the world market, and installation of plants in China, USA, Argentina, Chile, Israel, Brazil, Ghana and Spain is programmed for 2016 and 2017. Ambiensys has built a plant based on an autoclave for the treatment of municipal waste using steam, the city of Barbera del Valles near Barcelona (Spain). System designed by Rafael Ribas and Oscar Ribas, processes household waste without prior selection. The equipment has a capacity of 25,000 tons and is the first in a series that will work in parallel. The plant also has a section for selecting materials resulting from the process, especially biomass, obtained very clean and fit for further use.The plant was installed in an old textile factory and it could use existing facilities to produce the necessary steam. Babcock In 2010 Babcock built a single autoclave, based on Estech designs, as a proof of concept for the company's waste processing solution, the autoclave is capable of processing around eleven tonnes of unsorted waste per hour. This autoclave will be one of three autoclaves to go into a new facility at South Kirkby part of a PFI Project for the City of Wakefield Metropolitan District Council which will ensure that the Council achieves its strategic waste targets for diversion and recycling. The construction and commissioning of the new primary facilities at South Kirkby is scheduled to be completed in late 2012, the facilities at Denby Dale Road will be completed earlier during the same year. Together these facilities will treat 230,000 metric tons (253,531.6 U.S. tons) of municipal solid waste every year.. Babcock is operating under a license from EstechUSA LLC, who operated a commercial twin vessel plant in Wales beginning in 2004. Pictures from that operation, showing a pair of characteristic green and silver autoclaves, have been used by many startups as advertising literature. The Wakefield Project is being completed by the Shanks Group PLC, UK, a successor to the Babcock group. Estech began its autoclave business in 1998, and built its first full scale demonstration (single vessel system) in Sheffield UK. This is identified as the Model 1 system, and is now on display at Estech's headquarters in Ohio. A full size twin vessel facility, Model 2, was built in 2000 and operated in Bridgend, Wales. Recognizing the existing deficiencies in autoclave systems, Estech reviewed the worldwide state of the art of autoclave and other emerging waste technologies, assembled an engineering group with a broad background in technology development (from NASA, DoD, etc.) and privately funded a multi- million investment in improvements to produce its vessel-based Model 3 system. Others, including the UK, have determined that autoclave technology is the best solution for municipal waste management. The Model 3 system is built around its high-throughput autoclave/dryer (FiberCycle), which has been realized and demonstrated in numerous vessels. Recognizing the need for a proper path of utilization of the volumes of \\"fluff\\" produced, Estech developed early on an integrated electric/steam system to use the fluff as fuel. There are significant advantages to the use of a Brayton cycle engine, although other engines are also used. The resultant PowerCycle produces steam and commercial electricity from the dried/cleansed biomass. WaterCycle captures, cleans, and reuses water. Post-vessel separations cull out ferrous, non-ferrous, and plastic goods for commercial sale. The system is being commercialized globally. Much of combined equipment is available off-the- shelf, but the assembly has proprietary and specialized technological improvements. Estech is now finishing the construction of a proprietary Model-3 unit for a specialty municipal waste stream in the EU. Because of Estech's lead in the field, images of its autoclaves have been used by other companies in their advertisements. While Estech actively exercises its proprietary rights, those who contemplate systems promised on the basis of Estech's images should be aware that valid offerers would be showing their own images. Sterecycle claims to be the first company in the world to build and operate a full scale autoclave plant for household waste. In late 2005 the company started construction of the first vessel for their industrial scale autoclave plant to process household waste. Under contract from 3 local authorities, the Sterecycle plant has been in full commercial operation in Yorkshire, England since June 2008 (but for a period of shut-down for inspection by the Health and Safety Executive following an explosion in January 2011, see below) and processes mixed household waste. The twin autoclaves are commercial-scale, processing 100,000 metric tons (110,231.1 U.S. tons) per year of waste from Barnsley, Doncaster and Rotherham councils under a long term contract for up to 10 years. Sterecycle has folded. WastAway of McMinnville, Tennessee, U.S.A., has operated a small autoclave facility since 2003. The WastAway System processes waste on a continuous-flow basis with a complete processing time, from unseparated waste to final product, of approximately 25 minutes. The first WastAway commercial plant processed all the MSW of Warren County, Tennessee from 2003 through 2008. Product from this facility has been used predominantly as a soil amendment in the commercial horticulture industry. The company constructed a 150 U.S. ton (136 metric ton) per day facility in Aruba which began operations in July, 2009. The system separates metals and inert materials from the waste stream and produces an environmentally friendly, non-malodorous, bio-stabilized material that the company has trademarked, \\"Fluff\\". WastAway claims that it will soon begin manufacture of twin 200 ton per day facilities for St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands and St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. It is claimed that fluff from these two facilities will be used to fuel a new power plant being constructed on St. Croix.

It was built by Malik Deenar, Persian companion of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, on the orders of the successor of Cheraman Perumal, the Chera King of modern-day Kerala. The mosque was constructed in Kerala style with hanging lamps, making the historicity of its date claims more convincing. The mosque was completely destroyed by the Portuguese in 1504 when Lopo Soares de Albergaria attacked the port of Kodungallur. The old building was built some time after the 1504 de Algabaria attack (i.e., from mid-16th to the early 17th century). Modern corridors and halls were built in 1984. The 1984 extensions, which surround the old building, conceal almost all of the exterior features of the old building.Shokoohy, Mehrdad. Muslim Architecture of South India: The Sultanate of Ma'bar and the Traditions of the Maritime Settlers on the Malabar and Coromandel Coasts (Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Goa). RoutledgeCurzon, 2003. pp 139-42. History Structure of the old mosque According to some legends, Cheraman Perumal (\\"Cheraman Perumal\\" being the title held by Chera kings) witnessed the splitting of the moon, a supernatural event mentioned in the Quran as a miracle performed by the Islamic Prophet Muhammad when asked for one by Meccan unbelievers. The bewildered King confirmed with his astrologers that the incident had taken place, but didn't know what to make of it. Arab merchants who had arrived at a Malabar port, a bustling global marketplace, sought audience with the King to have his permission to visit Ceylon. In conversation with them, the King learnt about Muhammad, made his son the regent of his kingdom and travelled back with the Arab merchants to meet the man himself. The story goes that Cheraman Perumal arrived in Arabia with a gift of ginger pickles for Muhammad and his companions and converted to Islam \\"at the feet of Prophet Muhammad\\". The oral traditions of the legend differ greatly, another story goes that Cheraman Perumal was visiting the King of Maldives and they discussed the splitting of the moon, both men deciding to visit Mecca to find out the truth. S. N. Sadasivan, a social historian, believes that it wasn't the Cheraman Perumal of Malabar in the tale at all, but instead the King of Maldives, whose capital city \\"Mal√©\\" was confused for \\"Malabar\\". According to historian M.G.S. Narayanan, \\"there is no reason to reject the tradition that the last Chera king embraced Islam and went to Mecca, since it finds its place not only in Muslim chronicles but also in Hindu Brahmanical chronicles like the Keralolpatti it turns out was written by not Bhramins but converted Hindus the actual reality This story does not fit into the history of the 63 Nayanmars (Saiva Saints)[25]. Cheraman Perumal, also known as Perumaakothaiyar and Kalarittu Arivaar was a saintly Chera king who ruled from Kodungallur and was an ardent devotee of the Lord Mahadeva of Thiruvanchikalam just 3 km from Kodungallur. Researchers and experts conclude that there is no truth to this story since Muhammad lived from 570 to 631 CE and Cheraman Perumal who was a contemporary of Saint Sundarar, who lived later than Saint Thirugnana Sambandar and Saint Thirunavukkarasar, who are contemporaries and dated to have lived during Muhammad's time. Saint Sundarar and his friend Saint Cheraman Perumal are dated to have lived in the later part of 7th century and early part of 8th century CE. Saint Sundarar wrote 'Thiruthondar Thokai' in which he describes the lives, achievements and miracles of Saiva saints who lived before him, which includes Saint Thirugnana Sambandar and Saint Thirunavukkkarasar. If he sang about these two saints who lived at the time of the Prophet, he must have lived later than them which means his friend Cheraman Perumal must have lived later than Muhammad. The veracity of this story has to be verified.[26] But Sadasivan, in his book A Social History of India, argue that it was the king of Maldives, Kalimanja, who converted to Islam. Mali, which was known to seafarers then, might have been misunderstood as Malabar (Kerala) and this might have given rise to the tale of Tajuddeen in the Cochin Gazetteer., which need not be expected to concoct such a tale which in no way enhances the prestige of the Brahmins or Hindu population. It turns out that the\\" The history of the mosque has given it many architectural quirks including that since it was a repurpose Buddhist shrine, until its reconstruction in 1000 A.D. the mosque faced East instead of towards the Kaaba. Even today the mosque still includes some remnants of the shrine, including a traditional pond and a lamp that is said to have been burning for a thousand years, with oil that is brought for it by visitors and pilgrims of all religions. Location Masjid is located in the Paravur - Kodungalloor Road, NH-66 at Kodungalloor taluk, Thrissur District in Kerala.  Ceremonies = Vidyarambham  The ceremony of Vidyarambham (Vidya means \\"knowledge\\", arambham means \\"beginning'), held typically on Vijayadashami, is a Hindu tradition to initiate their children into learning under the supervision of a learned person like a priest. At Cheraman Masjid, this ceremony is performed by the mosque's Muslim Imam, who traces the alphabet drawn in the sand on a child's tongue, indicating an invocation to Saraswati, the goddess of learning. = Appointment of the Aven (Priest) = The aven (priest) of Shobhaparamba Sreekurumba Bhagavati temple in Tanur, Malappuram, is appointed a member of the Pazhayakath family, a local Muslim family. According to Chellikkattil Sundaran, president of the temple trust, the temple's aven had been traditionally appointed by a member of the local Thiyya family, a Brahmin family of Pazhayakhath Ilom. The family disintegrated over the years and its remaining members converted to Islam but both the temple authorities and the family upheld the tradition. The temple's Hindu priest is appointed in a special ritual once every 12 years, presided over by a Muslim member of the Pazhayakath family, who makes the formal announcement. Locals ascribe this camaraderie to Cheraman Perumal.  Maharajahs of Travancore  The legend of the \\"Makkattupoya Perumal\\" or \\"the King who went to Makkah (Mecca)\\" has lived on in Keralan memory and apparently, the Maharajahs of the Princedom of Travancore in pre-Independence India would say at their swearing in, \\"I will keep this sword until the uncle who has gone to Makkah returns\\".

The number of described species currently stands at around 1050 in 29 genera but the number of species is undoubtedly much higher than this and increases each time a new estimate is made. Description Adult beetles in this family are some shade of brown and between in length. The antennae have eight to eleven segments, the terminal one to three segments forming a club. The elytra are wider than the head and thorax, and are punctured by rows of small pits. The dorsal surface is rough. Most species are unable to fly. Ecology These beetles and their larvae are obligate feeders on the hyphae and spores of fungi, moulds and mildews. They occur in damp places where such fungi are found, under bark, in leaf litter, in decaying plant material, in timber stacked outdoors, and in ant and termite nests. They may be present in ripening cereal crops but will not persist in clean, dry stored grain; however damp grain, or grain heavily contaminated by other insects, will support them. They may infest brewers yeast and contaminate food by introducing mould spores. Species of Dienerella have caused the deterioration of foodstuffs, and hygiene problems in a hospital have been linked to Dienerella filum. They have been shown to consume Ustilago, Arcticum, Polysaccum, Tilletia, Lycoperdon and Trichothecium. They also thrive on mixed cultures of Penicillium, Mucor, Botrytis and Aspergillus.

It is south- east of the town of Kirkby Lonsdale where the main A65 road crosses the Leck Beck. It forms part of the civil parish of Burrow-with-Burrow. Clergy Daughters' School Cowan Bridge was the site of the Clergy Daughters' School attended by Charlotte and Emily Bront√´, the notable 19th-century writers, and their older sisters Maria and Elizabeth, who died after experiencing harsh privations at the school. There is a plaque commemorating this association on the former school building, which partially survives. The churchyard of St Peter's Church, Leck, has graves of several of the children who died at the school. Charlotte described the abuses, the typhus epidemic in which seven pupils died, the scandal which followed, and subsequent reform of the school in Jane Eyre. The character of Helen Burns is based closely on Maria. Reverend Brocklehurst is a portrait of William Carus Wilson, who managed the school in the Bront√´s' time. Women readers who had attended the school confirmed Charlotte's account. In a letter to her publisher W.S. Williams, Charlotte describes overhearing an elderly clergyman talk about reading Jane Eyre and saying \\"Why, they have got Cowan Bridge School, and Mr. Wilson here, I declare! and Miss Evans.\\" She says, \\"He had known them all. I wondered whether he would recognise the portraits, and was gratified to find that he did, and that, moreover, he pronounced them faithful and just. He said, too, that Mr. Wilson 'deserved the chastisement he had got.'\\"Letter from Charlotte Bront√´ to W.S. Williams, dated 1848-01-04 in Charlotte Bront√´ and Her Circle, by Clement K. Shorter, entire text online at gutenberg.org, page found 2010-08-30. The Clergy Daughters' School still exists. It was moved to Casterton shortly after the scandal. In 1840 another typhus epidemic struck 70 of the pupils, claiming the lives of three. By 1857 Dorothea Beale was teaching there. It was apparent to her that while some of the physical circumstances had improved since Charlotte's time, the spiritual aspects had not changed. When the Life of Charlotte Bront√´ by Elizabeth Gaskell came out, Beale began to write her own unfavorable impressions of the religious education handed out there.Entries on Dorothea Beale and on the Clergy Daughters' School in A Bront√´ Encyclopedia by Robert and Louise Barnard. .

It features a single or two-player story mode or multiplayer head-to-head mode, and was the first modern fighting game to feature assistant characters commonly referred to by gamers either as \\"helpers\\" or \\"strikers\\". The game is based on characters in the Marvel universe, primarily The Avengers but also the Kree. The game's plot and roster of playable characters is based on the Operation: Galactic Storm story arc. Before their bankruptcy in 2003, it was one of Data East's last fighting games, as well as their third and last game based on The Avengers after their two 1991 video games: the Captain America and The Avengers beat 'em up arcade and the NES platform game of the same name. On February 26, 1996, Pony Canyon and Scitron Label added the background music of Avengers in Galactic Storm with the background music of another Data East MLC System title, Skull Fang, both into an album titled Skull Fang / Avengers in Galactic Storm, which was released exclusively in Japan. Gameplay Avengers in Galactic Storm is mostly space-themed and plays similarly to other 2D versus fighting games during its release, which the player's character fights against his or her opponent in best two-out-of-three matches in a single player tournament mode with the computer or against another human player. The player has a character roster of eight playable fighters to choose from, each with their moves and fighting styles from the comics. The main unique feature of Avengers in Galactic Storm is the assistant character roster. Players choose both a playable character and an assistant to fight with before proceeding with the selected mode. There are three types of bars above the fighting segments: health, power and assistant. If the health bar becomes empty, that character becomes knocked out. If the power bar becomes full, that character now has a chance to perform desperation moves. If one of the two assistant bars become full, that character can call out his or her assistant to briefly attack his or her opponent (up to two times) before they leave the stage. There are two modes in the game, \\"Story Mode\\" and \\"VS Mode\\". In \\"Story Mode\\", when selected, the player has to select one of two \\"Mid-Game Participants\\": \\"Friend (Team Member)\\" or \\"Foe (Opponent)\\". One player can either fight alone or team up with a second player against opponents throughout this mode. The object of this mode is to knock out several characters in order of appearance throughout the Operation: Galactic Storm story arc. Each player will have two lives either at the beginning or when continuing. When completed, the game will force players to fight previously fought characters randomly selected and played by the computer player. When two players team up, and when both players' power bars are full, one of the players can create a \\"double-powerful tandem move\\", a duplex desperation move which is another unique feature of the game later inspiring others like Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes and Rage of the Dragons. \\"VS Mode\\" is like most multiplayer modes of other 2D versus fighting games, which two players fight head-to-head against each other. Plot Thunderstrike VS. Shatterax. The game's plot and roster of playable characters and their assistant characters are based on the Operation: Galactic Storm story arc.

They wrote that the 3D rendered graphics were just as good as the ones in Killer Instinct, but called the backgrounds \\"totally flat\\". The magazine said that the game was not bad, was \\"not great either\\".\\"Avengers in Galactic Storm.\\" Computer and Video Games. May 1996. p.10 A reviewer for Next Generation stated that despite the Avengers license, innovative assist character mechanic, and graphics (like Computer and Video games, he compared them favorably to those of Killer Instinct), at Golfland he observed a huge crowd around the Street Fighter Alpha 2 cabinet while one person was playing Avengers in Galactic Storm. He theorized that even with all its attractive \\"bells and whistles\\", the game could not complete in a market presently flooded with outstanding fighting games due to its merely average gameplay and character animations. He scored it 2 out of 5 stars.

In March 1870 he played in the first ever international football match, which took place at Kennington Oval, London. He represented England again in 1871. Early life Vidal was born at Cornborough House, Abbotsham near Bideford, Devon, England, and educated at Westminster School, being Captain of School and of the School's football and cricket XIs when he left in 1872. He entered Christ Church, Oxford where he graduated as B.A. in 1876 and M.A. in 1879. Football career Oxford University's F.A. Cup winning side of 1874 (Vidal standing extreme left). Vidal was well known as the \\"prince of dribblers\\". In those days, the rule was that the team that scored also kicked off afterwards. On one occasion this rule allowed Vidal to score three goals in a match without the other team touching the ball. He played in the first three FA Cup Finals, of 1872, 1873 and 1874. He was a member of the Wanderers F.C. team when they won the first ever FA Cup. It is said that he assisted the first FA Cup Final goal when, 15 minutes into the match, Vidal broke away and looped the ball across to Morton Betts, who shot between the posts. At 18 years 195 days he was the youngest ever player in a Cup Final until surpassed by 17 years old James F. M. Prinsep in 1879, and only winning player still at school on Cup Final day. The following year, Vidal had moved to Oxford. His team reached the Final, held on 29 March 1873 at Lillie Bridge ground, where they faced Vidal's old side, the Wanderers. However Oxford could not penetrate the defences and Wanderers won 2‚Äì0. In the next season, Oxford again qualified for the final, this time to face the Royal Engineers at Kennington Oval on 14 March 1874. Vidal played again, setting up Charles Mackarness's goal as Oxford University romped with a 2‚Äì0 victory. Vidal became the only person to have played in all three of the first FA Cup Finals. However, he never played in a final again. The University side reached the semi-finals in the next year, 1875, but the Engineers exacted their revenge by winning 1‚Äì0. He only received one cap for England. His cap came in the second official international football match, against Scotland on 8 March 1873 which England won 4‚Äì2. Vidal also played for Old Westminsters and Remnants football clubs and in representative matches for London and The South v The North. He was a member of the Football Association committee in 1872 and 1874. Other sports Vidal was an Oxford University rugby football Blue in 1873, and was a good oarsman. He also played county cricket for Devon and club cricket for North Devon. He was founder President of Oxford University Golf Club and in later life President of the Royal North Devon Golf Club (also known as Westward Ho!). Ecclesiastical career Vidal studied for the Church of England priesthood at Cuddesdon Theological College near Oxford, becoming ordained in 1877. He was Curate of St Edmund's, Salisbury, Wiltshire 1877‚Äì79; Vice-Principal of Ely Theological College 1879‚Äì81; Curate of Holy Trinity, Ely, 1880‚Äì81; and ultimately Vicar of Abbotsham, his native parish, from 1881 until his death. Later in his life he was Rural Dean of Hartland in the area his parish stood, and shortly before his death, which followed major breakdown in health, was made Prebendary of Exeter Cathedral. He was buried in Abbotsham Churchyard. He was also very active in local public affairs in Devon, as chairman of Abbotsham Parish Council, member of Bideford Rural District Council, vice- chairman of Bideford Board of Guardians, member of Devon County Education Committee and a local Commissioner for Income Tax. Change of surname On 26 May 1892, Vidal changed his surname back to his family's original name of Sealy, renouncing the surname of Vidal, following the succession of his father to ownership of the Cornborough estate.

The first volume of this series was originally called before the series was retitled Challengers. Challengers is licensed in German by Tokyopop Germany under the title K√ºss mich, Student! and in French by Taifu Comics under the title Rien n'est impossible. A spin-off series to Challengers, which follows Tomoe's older brother Souichi, is titled The Tyrant Falls in Love. Plot Tomoe Tatsumi, a high school student from Nagoya, goes on a trip to Tokyo to take a university entrance exam. He gets lost wandering around Tokyo when he runs into, Mitsugu Kurokawa, an office worker who had been out drinking with his friend Isogai. Isogai throws up on Tomoe and so Kurokawa takes him to clean his now ruined coat and tells him he'll help him find his hotel, but then they realize that the address to the hotel is in his coat pocket which is now in the wash, further complicating the situation. Since Kurokawa has an extra room at his place, he offers to let Tomoe stay at his place for the night. Tomoe accepts and the next morning he goes off to take his entrance exam. When Tomoe is getting on the train back to Nagoya, Kurokawa kisses him. Tomoe appears shocked and appalled at this and Kurokawa thinks he'll never hear from him again, but is surprised to receive a post card from Tomoe telling him that he passed the entrance exam. When Tomoe returns to Tokyo to look for a place to live, he asks for Kurokwa's help and Kurokawa offers to let him sub-lessee the extra room in his apartment. Tomoe thinks it would be a good idea since it would save his family money and accepts the offer. Kurokawa eventually confesses his love to Tomoe and their relationship develops gradually, but not without interference from various friends and relatives. Tomoe's short- tempered older brother, Souichi Tatsumi, is suspicious of the living arrangement and tries many times to get Tomoe to move back home. It is revealed that Souichi is homophobic because he was almost raped by one of his professors at his university but his lab assistant, Morinaga, saved him. As it so happens, Morinaga is gay and has had a crush on Souichi for 4 years starting from the moment they met. Souichi and Morinaga's story is continued in the spin-off series, The Tyrant Falls in Love.

However, Rosato found the first volume on the whole amusing. Writing about the second volume, Rosato feels that although the story is like other BL, Takanaga's execution is entertaining.

Born in Whitburn, County Durham, in 1912, he was the seventh son born in his family, hence the name Septimus. He is often considered the best all round player in Leicester City's historyLeicester City celebrates 125 years of football, Part One ‚Äì Leicester Fosse to Leicester City (Audio) bbc.co.uk, retrieved 2 April 2011Memories of Sep Smith, one of the greatest Leicester City players to grace Filbert Street thisisleicestershire.co.uk, retrieved 3 April 2011 and is also the club's longest serving player of all-time having been a player at the club for 19 years and 246 days, as well as captaining the club for 13 years (making him by far the club's longest serving captain). Smith spent his entire career at Leicester, starting in 1929 and ending in 1949. He made 373 competitive appearances for the Foxes, scoring 37 goals. However, he lost seven seasons of his career because of World War II, during which time he made a further 213 appearances and scored 48 goals during regionalised wartime football. Including these wartime appearances, his tally of 586 appearances makes him Leicester's second top appearance maker of all- time behind Graham Cross. Smith mentored former Leeds United and England manager Don Revie during his time at Leicester. Revie, who dedicated an entire chapter in his autobiography entitled \\"What I Owe to Sep Smith\\" claimed \\"I'm proud now to think of how much time Sep spent passing on his Soccer knowledge to me. He played a big part in my shaping my career.\\" He also referred to Smith as \\"an extraordinary footballer,\\" saying \\"he could place the ball within an inch of a man's toe ‚Äì [and] that when he lobbed the ball to his winger the opposing full back felt the ball graze his hair as he tried to strain his neck that extra inch, like a drowning man trying to lift his head out of the water.\\" He was the guest of honour at the Leicester's final game at Filbert Street (the club's home for over 110 years) in April 2002 and a suite at Leicester's current home ground The King Power Stadium is named after him in recognition of his service to the club.The Walkers Stadium ‚Äì Function Suites thewalkersstadium.co.uk, retrieved 2 April 2011  Career  Smith was snapped up for Leicester in 1929 by Willie Orr as an inside-forward at the age of 16. where two of his older brothers, Thomas and Joe, were both already playing for Leicester. Tom was a regular in the first-team before moving to Manchester United and Joe was a reserve player who later joined Watford. He made his debut against Huddersfield Town on 31 August 1929 coming in for Arthur Lochhead who had been suffering from illness, but after a disappointing performance in which the local press described him as being \\"unable to pull his weight\\" he played no further part in that season. However, as he began to grow he began to show his poachers instinct, top scoring for the reserves the following season and earning himself a recall to the first team. In 1931‚Äì32 he scored 11 times in 22 matches though still as he began to cement his place in the first team. However, it wasn't until 1932‚Äì33, when Smith began to truly blossom after was moved from his role of inside forward and shifted into a deeper role at right half, the position he would make his own for the club for the next 17 years. He helped Leicester to their first ever FA Cup semi-final in 1934 in which came up against two other of his older brothers, Jack and Bill, who were both playing for Leicester's opponents Portsmouth. He was made club captain two years later in 1936 and won his only honour with the club the following year, winning the Second Division title in 1936‚Äì37. During his time at Leicester, Smith was known to take many young up and coming players under his wing and tutor them, the most notable of these was Don Revie, Smith said of Revie \\"I could see he had potential when he came down for a trial and I used to coach him lots with the ball. I'd say come on with me, and we'd go into a corner and I'd teach him things. He was an eager young player but I used to make him cry when I told him he did things wrong. He told me he would go home after the match and start to cry. I was pushing him because I believed in him. When he used to cry, I told him he should do things right. But he could cross a ball and kick a ball the right way. I would teach him the way to go ‚Ä¶ to pass the ball in front of the player so he could run on to it. And I would teach him how to trap it.The Mighty Mighty Whites ‚Äì The Definitive history of Leeds United ‚Äì Don Revie ‚Äì Part 2 Learning the ropes (1927‚Äì51) themightyleeds.co.uk, retrieved 3 April 2011 In his biography of Don Revie: Portrait of a Footballing Enigma author Andrew Mourant states Smith's influence on Revie: \\"He drummed into the young, receptive Revie four principles: when not in position, get into position; never beat a man by dribbling if you can beat him more easily with a pass; it is not the man on the ball but the one running into position to take the pass who constitutes the danger; and the aim is to have a man spare in a passing move. Soccer would then become easy.\\" During his final season with the club Leicester reached the 1949 FA Cup final in which Revie missed out on through illness. He was many fans' choice to replace Revie for the final, but this would mean a tactical shift and the moving of star striker Jack Lee to facilitate Smith's inclusion so never happened. He helped aid Johnny Duncan's tactical preparations instead. Smith would end his career on the final fixture of the 1948‚Äì49 season, in which Leicester staved off relegation to the Third Division with a dramatic 1‚Äì1 draw with Cardiff City (there are still suggestions that the game may have been fixed). Smith retired from the game at the age of 37 after 20 years in the Leicester team. He stayed on as a coach at Leicester, however after Johnny Duncan resigned a few weeks later, Smith's ties with the club were cruelly severed under Duncan's replacement Norman Bullock International career Despite being called up to the national squad on several occasions, Smith played only once for England against Ireland in Belfast in 1935. In the same year, he played in the Jubilee International against Scotland and also for the Football League against the Scottish League.  Death  Smith died on 28 July 2006 at the age of 94. A minute's silence held in his honour at Leicester's Championship game with Burnley the Tuesday after his death. At the time of his death, he was the oldest surviving former England international, and the last surviving pre-World War II international.

Shree Shree Samaleswari, the presiding deity of Sambalpur, is a strong religious force in western part of Odisha and Chhattisgarh state of India. On the bank of the river Mahanadi the mother goddess Samaleswari is worshipped from ancient times as Jagatjanani, Adishakti, Mahalaxmi and Mahasaraswati. The region in which the temple is situated has a rich cultural heritage. Sambalpur region is popularly known as Hirakhanda from ancient times. Ptolemy has described the place as Sambalak, according to Tavernir, the French traveller, and Edward Gibbon, the English historian, diamonds were exported to Rome from Sambalpur. The temple is of Sandhara order (These types of the temples have a square sanctum enclosed by a gallery of pillars meant for Pradakshina). Thus, the Sandhara temples have a Pradakshinapatha is built of a kind of stone durable as granite, cemented with lime mortar, the whole building is plastered, but in the course of time the surface has become mouldy. The temple comprises two separate structures. The square sanctum sanctorum enshrining the deity is four step below the covered circumambulation, which is supported by 12 stone pillars. Eleven parswa devis (side Goddess), are embedded on the outer wall of the sanctum, so that the devotees can worship those deities during parikarma through the vaulted circumambulation. The Idol of Shree Shree Samalai Devi consists of a large block of Granite rock with an inverted, trunk like projection at the bottom. A shallow cut on her \\"Baraha\\" like face symbolises her mouth. Traditional Sambalpuri nose ornament of pure gold hangs down from her imaginary nose Beaten gold leave fixed on two disproportionate golden eye like depression on the face acts as substitute for her eyes in an attempt to define the face of the mother deity on a mass of self shaped rock, the devi's idol inspires sublime sentiments of awe, fear, reverence, devotion, love and affection towards all-pervading motherhood. She is worshiped with a great care and devotion by the natives in her temple, famously known as the samaleswari temple. Among the varieties of festivals observed before the goddess throughout the year three festivals are observed prominently. The first two are navaratra puja during the months of March and April and during the months of September and October. Among these two navaratra pujas (nine days continuous worship of the goddess) the second one is observed with a great splendour and devotion. The third festival which is said to be the chief festival of the whole western Odisha region is nuakhai. In this festival the farmers offer the first produce from their lands to the goddess before using it for his personal use.

At low engine speeds the wave pressure within the pipe network is low. A full oscillation of the Helmholtz resonance occurs before the exhaust valve is closed, and to increase low-speed torque, large-amplitude exhaust pressure waves are artificially induced. This is achieved by partial closing of an internal butterfly valve within the exhaust at the point where the primary pipes from the cylinders join. This junction point essentially behaves as an artificial atmosphere. The alteration of the pressure at this point controls the behavior of reflected waves at this sudden increase in area discontinuity. Closing the valve increases the local pressure, inducing the formation of larger-amplitude negative reflected expansion waves. A servo motor controlled by the ECU opens and shuts the valve. The valve goes from being almost fully closed at idle speed, through to fully open at higher engine speeds. This ensures superior low to mid-range performance, more linear power output and reduced exhaust noise levels while the valve is in its reduced opening position. Yamaha was the first to develop such a system, called the Exhaust Ultimate Power Valve (EXUP). It first appeared on the Yamaha FZR EXUP and was later used on many other Yamahas. Later versions from Honda went by the names Honda Titanium Exhaust Valve (HTEV) and Honda Variable Intake/Exhaust (H-VIX), appearing on the CBR600RR and Honda CBR929RR. Suzuki's version is called Suzuki Exhaust Tuning (SET). The system is also used on the Triumph Daytona 675 triple.

After his death, his American-born wife Beatrice was elected unopposed to succeed him as MP.Obituary of Tim Rathbone, from The Times The family lived in the constituency at Elmsleigh.  Foreign travel = United States of America  John and Beatrice travelled to the United States of America in the summer of 1934, sailing back to Britain aboard the RMS Aquitania in October. They returned to America in 1936, again sailing back to Britain in the October, this time aboard the RMS Queen Mary.  Germany  John travelled as part of a parliamentary delegation, accompanied by Beatrice, to Nazi Germany. A fluent German speaker, John was appalled at what he saw in the country as he participated in the work of the delegation. He was a qualified pilot, learning to fly with the Old Etonian Flying Club and getting his Avro Club membership on 19 May 1938. Upon returning from Germany, John called a meeting in his constituency to announce that he was joining the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve.  Second World War  He served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Supply from July to September 1939, when World War II broke out. A flight lieutenant and fighter pilot with the Royal Air Force, he was killed shortly after the Battle of Britain, on 10 September 1940. He was buried at Schoonselhof cemetery, Antwerp, Belgium. In his obituary in The Times noted -  Family members  Rathbone was the nephew of Eleanor Rathbone, who had been an independent MP for the Combined English Universities between 1929 and 1946, and a staunch women's rights campaigner. He was a grandson of William Rathbone, Liberal MP for Liverpool and later Carnarvonshire. His son, also called John Rankin Rathbone, but known as Tim Rathbone, was the Conservative MP for Lewes from 1974 to 1997. John's younger brother, Henry Stephen Nicholas Rathbone, served as a Captain in the Scots Guards and fell at Monte Cassino on 9 November 1943.

History It was built by King Sverre Sigurdsson (ca. 1150‚Äì1202) in the mid 1180s, 250 meters northeast of Bergenhus fortress. King Sverre Sigurdsson also had a Sverresborg built in Trondheim. It is thought that the fortress had an outer wall of stone and inner buildings of wood. Sverris saga mentions that 600 men and 40 noble women lived in the fortress ca. 1207. Sverresborg was the site of several battles during the Civil war era in Norway. The castle fell to the baglers and was destroyed, but was rebuilt by H√•kon Jarl. The baglers destroyed it a second time and it has been rebuilt several times. Much of the remaining structures are from the 17th century. The site was reinforced by King H√•kon H√•konsson after the great fire of 1248. The medieval fort remained until the mid-16th century. Directly underneath Sverresborg lies the residence of the master of the ramparts (Vollmesterboligen), the oldest of which go back to the 18th century. The master of the ramparts was in charge of the maintenance and upkeep of the fortifications and buildings. In August 1665, the fortress participated in the Battle of V√•gen. The last known expansions took place during the Napoleonic wars. Present day In the 1830s a park was laid out in the area and in 1911 a petty officers school was established for Bergen Brigade (Bergenske Brigades Underoffiserskole). During World War II the German occupants established two anti aircraft batteries in the fortress. After the war, Sverresborg used as the execution site in connection with treason settlement. Seven German and one Norwegian war criminals were executed in Sverresborg in 1946. The fortress has not fulfilled an operative capacity since World War II, but is still used by the military of Norway for office and training facilities. The area is today under the command of the commandant of Bergenhus Fortress and is a military area, but open to the public.Sverresborg (Bergen Hash House Harriers) ReferencesOther sources *Krag, Claus Sverre ‚Äì Norges st√∏rste middelalderkonge (Oslo: H.

Although Exhall is not mentioned specifically in the Domesday Book, it would have probably formed part of lands owned by Lady Godiva in Ansty and Foleshill. In any case, the parish was probably inhabited from at least the 13th century, as the nave and chancel of St Giles's church appear to date from this period, with the tower added in the 14th century. Although the area remained largely rural until recent times, coal mines were attested from the early 17th century onwards. During the Industrial Revolution, activities such as coal-mining and brick-making were further developed, leading to an increase in the population of the parish, and consequently the construction of many small houses for workers. These were mainly located along what is now Black Bank/Coventry Road Exhall, in Ash Green and in Goodyers End in Bedworth (part of which is included in the parish of Exhall). In 1868, the main industry in the parish ‚Äì in common with towns such as Nuneaton and Coventry ‚Äì was ribbon-making.Genuki page on Exhall (nr Coventry), Warwickshire Saunders Manor was located on the outskirts of Exhall (on the site near Springfield Crescent) before being demolished. From the 1930s onwards, Exhall became more residential in character, with the construction of numerous housing estates, both social (e.g. the Armson Road/Grant Road estate at Hayes Green) and private (e.g. the Cedars Estate). On 19 February 1949 two aircraft collided at 4500 ft near Exhall. The wreckage fell near an old people's home, the Exhall Lodge Hospital. There were no survivors. In the 1960s, a large industrial estate was created in the east of Exhall, bordering the Coventry‚ÄìNuneaton rail line, at Bayton Road. Other industrial areas were subsequently developed at Black Horse Road and Grovelands (off Longford Road). Today, the name Exhall applies principally to the area immediately south of Bedworth (centred on Black Bank and Coventry Road Exhall), with Ash Green retaining a somewhat separate identity ‚Äì a fact accentuated by the construction of the Bedworth Bypass (A444) in 1970 and the final section of the M6 motorway in 1971. Even today, Ash Green remains more rural than Exhall, with a number of farms still in operation (e.g. Exhall House Farm, Grange Farm, Newland Hall Farm, Barker's Farm). Both Exhall and Ash Green form part of the Coventry/Bedworth Urban Area, the conurbation that includes Coventry and Bedworth, and as such are in many respects outer suburbs of Coventry, as reflected by their inclusion in the Coventry post town. Governance From 1451 to 1842, Exhall was a parish in the Liberty of Coventry, which was geographically in the hundred of Knightlow in the county of Warwickshire, but administratively separate. Following the abolition of the Liberty of Coventry, the city boundary was revised, with Exhall excluded. With the passing of the Local Government Act 1894, which established urban and rural districts in England and Wales, Exhall formed part of the Foleshill Rural District,Exhall, Warwickshire on the A Vision of Britain website up until the creation of the Bedworth urban district in 1928, to which it was transferred. Following local government reorganisation in 1974, Bedworth urban district was merged with Nuneaton municipal borough to form the new borough of Nuneaton (renamed Nuneaton & Bedworth in 1980). For electoral purposes, Exhall is split (at both borough and county level) along Black Bank/Coventry Road Exhall/Longford Road. At borough level, western Exhall is covered by Exhall ward (together with Ash Green and Keresley End), while western Exhall is covered by Poplar ward (together with Coalpit Field and the southern part of Furnace Fields). Each ward is represented by two borough councillors, who are elected for a four-year term by halves. At county level, western Exhall is covered by the Bede division (which also includes the area covered by the borough ward called Bede), while eastern Exhall is covered by the Poplar division (which is identical to the borough ward of the same name). Ash Green and Keresley End, however, are included in the Bedworth West division, along with part of Bedworth Heath and Goodyers End. Each division elects one county councillor for a four-year term. Geography Exhall is an area 1.5 miles (2.5 km) south of Bedworth town centre, north-northeast of Coventry and south of Nuneaton. Though contiguous with the Bedworth urban area (and effectively a southern suburb of the town), its post town remains Coventry, given the CV6 and CV7 postcodes. The population of the ward taken at the 2011 census was 8,006. It is bounded (approximately) by a disused mineral railway (that used to serve Newdigate Colliery) to the north, the Coventry‚ÄìNuneaton railway line to the east, Pickards Way (B4113 spur) and the M6 to the south, and Church Lane/Bowling Green Lane and the River Sowe to the west. The area makes up the eastern part of the ecclesiastical parish of Exhall St Giles.See the \\"Find Us\\" tab on the parish page for Exhall St Giles on the Church of England's \\"A Church Near You\\" website However, the parish church of St Giles is located on the northeastern edge of nearby Ash Green (which forms the western part of the parish). The River Sowe and the Coventry Canal are the principal waterways in the area. Amenities Exhall has a post office and a number of small shops and pubs, mainly on Black Bank/Coventry Road Exhall, with some local shops on Trelawney Road and Exhall Green/Windmill Road. Bedworth Rugby Football Club has its ground at Rectory Fields (between Rectory Drive and Smarts Road), and there is a large playing field at Heckley Fields (between Heckley Road and Windmill Road). Education Educational establishments at Exhall are: * Exhall Cedars Infant School & Nursery, a state school for pupils aged 2 to 7, in Trenance Road * St Giles Junior School, a state school for pupils aged 7 to 11, in Hayes Lane * The Grove Nursery School, a private school for children aged from 2 months to 5 years * Wheelwright Lane Primary School, a state primary school for pupils aged 4 to 11, in Wheelwright Lane Before the reorganisation of schools in northern Warwickshire in 1996, there was another school in the area, Exhall First School (on the corner of School Lane and Exhall Green). This school merged with Cedars First School to form Exhall Cedars Infant School (on the Cedars site), and the old Exhall First School building is now a community centre. The secondary school for the area is Ash Green School, In July 2012, the school was formally recognised as a provider for Post 16 education. The Sixth Form Centre opened in September, 2012 and accommodates students studying AS, A Level courses and BTEC courses. Exhall Grange School, a school for students who are visually impaired and have other disabilities, can be found in the area. The school achieved Specialist Science College status in 2003.

She produced casts of her and her son's body. She worked mainly in bronze and stone and her provocative work recalled genres such as surrealism, nouveau realism, and pop art. During World War II she was imprisoned in the Pabianice and ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Ghettos and in Auschwitz, Bergen-Belsen and Theresienstadt Nazi concentration camps.  Biography  Alina Szapocznikow Grands Ventres, 1968, in the Kr√∂ller-M√ºller Museum.  Early life (1926-38)  Szapocznikow was born in Kalisz in 1926 to a Jewish family (mother, father, and one younger brother). Her father, Jakub, was a dentist and her mother, Ryfka (Regina), was a pediatrician. Her family lived in Pabianice near ≈Å√≥d≈∫. During these years, Szapocznikow attended a small Polish elementary school in Pabiance New Town and a State High School of St. Hedwig in Putawskiego St. Her father died from tuberculosis in 1938 right before the war broke out.  Life during World War II (1939-45)  As a thirteen year old, Szapocznikow was soon left all alone with her mother, as her brother went missing shortly after the start of the war. Once they were relocated to the ghetto in Pabianice, they spent two years (February 1940 to May 1942) at the ghetto employed in the hospital - her mother as a doctor and Alina as a nurse. The familial pair continued to work as a doctor and nurse when they were moved to the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ ghettos at the end of May before being shipped even farther. They passed through Auschwitz on their way to the concentration camp in Bergen-Belsen. Szpocznikow and her mother stayed at the camp for a total of 10 months, before being moved from the camp. According to documentation from their stay, the change in internment in autumn of 1943 was due to Szapocznikow's mother scolding of a German doctor who \\"did not acquit himself well of his duties.\\" By autumn 1943, the familial pair was moved to Terezin where they stayed together for one more year before ultimately being separated. The artist's experiences during the end of the war are unknown. After the war, Szapocnikow headed to Prague with a group of prisoners while her mother returned to ≈Å√≥d≈∫ . Alina Szapocznikow barely spoke of her war experiences during the entirety of her life. However, there are letter fragments of correspondences with her first husband, that mention her war experience: > \\"But the difference is that in the process of your formation in the last 10 > years you have not gone through that baptism of despair, all these things, > everything didn't end for you irretrievably several times as it did for me > in the ghettos and the camps. I'm sorry, Rys, I am embarrassed. You know how > much I hate, how ashamed I am for those people who go on or \\"brag\\" about the > years of torment they have lived through.\\"  Late life (1945-1973)  Friendship, a socialist realism sculpture by Szapocznikow, 1953‚Äì1954 Alina Szapocznikow, once in Prague, decided to study the art of sculpture. She trained as a sculptor in Otokar Velimsky's studio in Prague from 1945‚Äì1946. In 1947 she studied at the Academy of Art and Industry in Prague under the tutelage of Josef Wagner, after which she attended Paul Niclausse's atelier at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. During her time in Paris, she was introduced to the Polish community where she met her first husband, , a Polish art historian, and the director of the Museum of Modern Art in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. The artistic life of France was important in Szapocznikow's development as an artist - she was given the freedom to establish the fundamentals of sculpture. The artist was exposed to and inspired by the works of Jean Arp, Ossip Zadkine, Henry Moore and Alberto Giacometti. Between the years 1947-1949, Szapocznikow traveled back and forth between Prague and Paris for a time. In 1951, she was afflicted with a sudden illness. She was diagnosed with peritoneal tuberculosis, which was not treatable at the time. Under the recommendation of her doctor, she traveled to Sirod in the Jura Mountains, before a relapse caused her to go to a private hospital in Champagnole. After consulting her doctor, Szapocznikow allowed for the use of an experimental antibiotic (Streptomycin) which assisted in her recovery. She returned to Poland, where she married Stanis≈Çawski July 1952 and that same summer they adopted a son named Piotr. The artist took part in numerous competitions to create public monuments to Chopin, Polish-Soviet friendship, Warsaw heroes, the victims of Auschwitz, and Juliusz S≈Çowacki. Szapocznikow and Stanis≈Çawski only stayed together for 6 years, before divorcing the summer of 1958, though they remained close for the rest of their lives. She became romantically involved with Polish graphic designer Roman Cie≈õlewicz. They married 1967 in Paris. In 1962, Szapocznikow was offered a solo show in the Polish Pavilion at the Venice Biennale. The following year she moved to Paris where she became friends with the art critic and founder of the Nouveau R√©alisme movement, Pierre Restany. Back in Paris, Szapocznikow started to produce casts of her breasts, stomach, and legs. Working mainly in bronze and stone, Szapocznikow's early artistic production constitutes the first materially documented trace of her own embodiment. In 1963, the artist began to combine fragmented body parts with revolutionary sculpting materials including polyester and polyurethane. Such technical innovation allowed Szapocznikow to immortalize a personal language informed by her exposure to death in childhood, traumatic memories of the Holocaust, as well as witnessing the premature collapse of her own body due to tuberculosis.  Death  In 1968, the artist was diagnosed with breast cancer. Much of her work after her diagnosis, revolved around her inevitable death and the traumas she endured throughout her life. That same year Szapocznikow started making her \\"tumor\\" sculptures using resin, gauze, crumpled newspapers and photographs. Through casts of the human body, the artist intended to preserve the impermanence of the body as a source of pain, trauma and truth.Pollock, Griselda, \\"traumatic encryption: the sculptural dissolutions of Alina Szapocznikow\\" in: After- affects, After images. Manchester University Press, 2013, 165-222 Her choice of using photographs of herself and of friends in forms of synthetic resin calls upon the processes of sculpture and photography as grave diggers and carriers of melancholy. One of the last works that Szapocznikow worked on was a purely conceptual project. Encouraged by Pierre Restany, she explored a design that would celebrate and beautify the region of Vesuvius. A paradoxical production, it involved not the crown of Vesuvius but the inside of the crater itself. There was to be a skating rink - inviting skaters to waltz to On the Hills of Manchuria, lighting, ski-lifts, and artificial snow. The design can be described as \\"the gesture of someone who, in challenging nature, subjugates and enchants it\\" and the \\"triviality and the playful character of that gesture.\\" The artists herself comments on the inevitability of the end with the conceptual project: > \\"If one day during a figure skating competition some Peggy Fleming of the > time executes her program in the frozen crater and if we, the spectators, > amazed by her wonderful and frivolous pirouettes, are surprised by a sudden > eruption of lava and become petrified for ever, like the inhabitants of > Pompeii, then the triumph of the moment and of the force of transition will > be complete. And such a fleeting moment and such a transitory instant are > the only symbol of our earthy passage.\\" Alina Szapocznikow died March 2 in Praz-Coutant due to the last phase of her illness, bone cancer and advancing paralysis.  Reception  After the artist's death, Alina Szapocznikow's work was organized into a number of shows. In 1975, the posthumous reception of her work reached its peak where her work was shown extensively throughout Poland, lengthy articles and essays were also written. In the late 1970s and 80s, her work was shown in group exhibitions, but not in many solo exhibitions. In recent years, Alina Szapocznikw has been \\"rediscovered\\" by the public and major museums have organized shows including the Museum of Modern Art in New York.  Notable works = War  Throughout her career, Szapocznikow explored the fragmented human body through sculptures of bronze and later used modern plastic materials including polyester, polyurethane, and wiring. Influenced by her experiences as a Polish Jewish woman during World War II, she uses the distorted, decaying, and fragmented human body as a witness to wartime experiences, ultimately criticizing the valorization of labor and militarism. Exhumed, from 1955, is a portrayal of the body after war with a pitted surface texture and hollowed torso. The work evokes heroic Herculean figures and victims of the 79 CE Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in Pompeii, further driving the idea that valorized bodies are not immune to the impact of war.  Human body  Alina Szapocznikow is known for her sculptures of the fragmented female. Made in 1956, Difficult Age is constructed of patinated plaster ‚Äî a rather delicate medium for sculpture ‚Äî that can easily be read as a metaphor for the fragility and impermanence of youth and beauty. After being diagnosed with breast cancer, Alina Szapocznikow began her Tumors Personified series experimenting with polyester resin and polyurethane ‚Äî a new use of materials which most artists had not utilized at this time. She abstracts feminine sensuality in Illuminated Lips, Marching Lips, and Illuminated Breast among others from 1966 on, which transforms female body parts into utilitarian objects and changes their function. Her male contemporaries (e.g., C√©sar Baldaccini, Arman) had exhausted this notion of the mechanized body, but Szapocznikow‚Äôs functional household objects maintain a strange sensuality. One of her most recognized and well known works is Grands Ventres (Big Bellies) which depicts two large bellies stacked on top of each other, each around five feet tall. Compared to her other works regarding the body, these are very realistic and soothing to look at. Many of her other works have been regarded as impolite and are not what one might call \\"tasteful\\".  Bird  In 1959 Alina Szapocznikow created the sculpture Bird in her studio in Warsaw. Bird was part of a series of abstract works that Szapocznikow created in 1958‚Äì1960 that were characterized by their inverted center of gravity and their organic and distinctive expressive forms resembling shapes in nature. Bird is made from cement and metal, exceptionally heavy materials for its dimensions ‚Äî the sculpture stands 166 cm tall. With the bird‚Äôs neck and beak pointing straight upwards to the sky and its wings drawn together, the sculpture suggests the tension in the animal‚Äôs body during the precise moment of departing from earth, no longer fully on the ground but not yet in the sky. There are several photographs of Szapocznikow with Bird, including one made by the renowned photographer Tadeusz Rolke. The sculpture was last exhibited at Polish Painting and Sculpture in 1961 at the Gres Gallery in Washington, D.C., and was considered lost for over 50 years until it was rediscovered in the outhouse of an art collector in upstate New York. When Bird was sold at an auction in April 2016 it broke the record for the most expensive Polish sculpture. This work was shown to the public for the first time in 56 years at The Hepworth Wakefield art gallery.

Many scholars of Southeast Asian studies rely on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to create a concrete list of nations that fit under the umbrella of Southeast Asia. As of 2016, members of ASEAN include Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao DPR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.  History of the discipline = Before and During the Second World War  While the term \\"Southeast Asia\\" was first used in connection with the present region by American priest and educator Howard Malcom in 1837, the region presently referred to as Southeast Asia was split between India and the Far East by anglophone scholars prior to the Second World War and de-emphasized as an area of study due to the presence of national interests in the region. Initial inquiries into the culture and traditions of Southeast Asia were primarily conducted by German and Austrian scholars who had greater access to the region because their home countries had no colonies in the region The strategic importance of numerous locales in Southeast Asia such as the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines during the Second World War attracted increased attention from the West. This newfound attention led to the establishment of Mountbatten's South-East Asia Commant (SEAC) in 1943, and the publication of the first map of Southeast Asia by the National Geographic society in 1944.  Postwar  Immediately after the conclusion of the Second World War, the beginnings of the Cold War drew the attention of United States think tanks and intelligence organizations away from Southeast Asia. Events such as the 1949 Revolution in China and fear about the spread of communism re-centered much of the monetary focus on to China and the Soviet Union. This led to two results: while funding and the commitment of corporations to the area decreased, oversight also decreased; researchers in the West were free to pursue most avenues of interest without the objection of their sponsors.  In East Asia  In Japan, Southeast Asian studies became a more concrete field of study in the period after Japanese colonization of the region during the Pacific War. The Center for Southeast Asian Studies at Kyoto University was founded in 1963, and The Japan Society for Southeast Asian History was founded in 1966 In the United States, the rise of communism in Vietnam and Laos brought Southeast Asian studies to the forefront of academia and politics. In Korea, academics began forming groups focusing on the region of Southeast Asia in the 1990s. In 1991, the Korean Association of Southeast Asian Studies (KASEAS). Southeast Asian studies in South Korea focuses mainly on Southeast Asia's relationship with other regions in Asia, trans-border migration within and outside Southeast Asia, and the spread of Korean Wave in the region. Publication Southeast Asian Studies is also the English name of the Japanese scholarly journal Tonan Ajia Kenkyu. The journal has been published since 1963 by the Center for Southeast Asian Studies at Kyoto University.

Early life Burton was born in Melbourne, the son of the Rev John Wear Burton, a Methodist Minister. Hardcopy 1979, Vol.7. Nb. His fathers bio He was educated at Newington College (1924‚Äì1932) and went on to graduate from the University of Sydney in 1937. Public service In 1937 Burton became a member of the Commonwealth Public Service from where he was granted a Commonwealth scholarship to pursue a doctorate at the London School of Economics. He joined the Department of External Affairs in 1941 and served as private secretary to Herbert Vere Evatt. In 1947, aged 32, he became Secretary of the Department of External Affairs and held that position until June 1950. At the beginning of 1951 he took up the position of Australian High Commissioner to Ceylon, but resigned to return home and contest the Federal election of that year in the electorate of Lowe. As the Australian Labor Party (ALP) candidate he was beaten by William McMahon, a future Prime Minister of Australia. Academic career While writing his first book, The Alternative, Burton farmed outside Canberra and in 1960 was awarded a fellowship at the Australian National University. Two years later the Rockefeller Foundation awarded him a grant to study neutralism in Africa and Asia. In 1963, while a Reader in International Relations at University College University of London, he established the Centre for the Analysis of Conflict. He then went on to hold fellowships at numerous universities while living in Canberra.http://nla.gov.au/nla.ms-ms8405 National Library of Australia  Death  Burton died in a Canberra hospital on 23 June 2010 after suffering a stroke. He was survived by his third wife, Betty, and three children from the prior marriages. Another daughter predeceased him. Legacy In introducing Burton as a guest on Radio National, Phillip Adams said; \\"John Burton was probably the most controversial and visionary public servant of the 20th Century. Branded a pink eminence of the Labor Party by conservative critics, he was clearly one of the most important intellectuals and policy-makers associated with the Curtin Labor Government of the 1940s. As a close associate of 'Doc' Evatt and head of the department of External Affairs (now Foreign Affairs) he did more to shape Australian foreign policy towards Asia and the Pacific than any other person before or since.\\" Burton's theoretical work on conflict resolution has been highly influential in setting up conflict resolution as an academic discipline in its own right, which is very much needed in the modern globalised world because of the greater potential for disputes between different ethnic and religious communities. In Australia, Burton's work greatly influenced the pioneering course in conflict resolution at Macquarie University, Sydney.Tillett, Gregory (2006). Resolving conflict: A practical approach.

The story surrounds five bish≈çnen and their rather unlucky manager as they go about their daily routine at their caf√©. Characters=Main characters ;Kurihara Taro :Taro is usually considered the cutest and mature worker at the caf√©. He is a fastidious neat freak in glasses, and cannot stand disorder. It is too bad that one of his fellow employees wreaks havoc wherever he goes. Taro is the second in command of the caf√©, and his co-workers generally do as he says, with the exception of Minagawa and Maki. His apartment is spotless, and visitors have to go through a full body sanitization in order to come in. Taro has a huge closet full of different types of cleansers, and sends off overseas in order to get many of them. He used to be less obsessive about cleanliness until he fell under a sea of filth when visiting Maki's apartment. Taro has an ongoing rivalry with Maki, and is often seen hitting him over the head with a mop or various items. ;Okubo Maki :The rebellious pretty boy of the group, Maki lives to irritate Taro. Often Minagawa will step in and use voodoo in order to keep the fights from escalating. Despite his good looks, Maki is an enormous slob, and his apartment has little to no room for movement. He is the head waiter of the cafe, and often tries to hit on attractive female customers. Which, for the most part, results in rejection. ;Tokumi Shuta :A happy-go-lucky boy, Toku is often very naive and easily taken advantage of. He is one of the part-timers in the cafe that is currently going to college. Toku attends an unnamed athletic college, and has a master/servant relationship with several of his fellow female students. Due to his penchant for accidental destruction, Toku's paycheck is usually very slim. As such, he is usually starving and lives in a dilapidated apartment without a bath. Shuta does, however, have two pet hamsters which his co-workers refer to as a reserve food supply. ;Minagawa Hifumi :A great cook and more than slightly creepy, Minagawa works behind the scenes at the caf√©. He is very proficient in all forms of dark arts, and often uses it to get his way. His cooking tastes great, but how he prepares the food appears to be somewhat dodgy, as he uses a Necronomicon of sorts as his cooking guide. Minagawa has a strange sense of humor. He once sent his co-workers on a wild goose chase to prepare the day's dishes when Minagawa had the day off. No matter what strange happenings occur in the caf√©, he is never rattled. The manager's daughter also has a crush on Minagawa, after he reprimanded her for trying to destroy the caf√© and cut off Sukekiyo's whiskers. ;Ichinomiya Jun :The youngest member of the group, and one of the part-timers, Jun is often the most agreeable. He is very cute, polite and accommodating. However, Jun's pretty face hides an enormous temper that is provoked whenever anyone calls him cute or girl-like. He possesses inhuman strength that enables him to lift enormous boulders or the occasional cattle. Jun has a gang of schoolgirls that obey his every command, leading to a common belief that Jun's sweet personality only goes so deep. Minor characters ;Mitaka Yuichi :The ever burdened manager of the caf√©, he manages somehow to keep everything afloat. The task of running the cafe, doubled with trying to make enough money to cover daily damages, often leaves Mitaka with very little time to spend with his family. His daughter Reina tried to regain his attention by destroying the caf√©, hoping that it would give him more time to be with her. ;Mitaka Reina :Adorable, yet pesky, Reina idolizes her father, but wishes that he would spend more time with her. Not knowing where her father worked, she wandered around until she saw Taro. Recognizing the uniform, she followed him until they reached the caf√©. Initially there was some confusion about why Taro was wandering around with a 4-5 year old girl (which ranged from paedophilia to fatherhood), but it was eventually cleared up why she was there. Reina tried destroying the store, but was stopped by Minagawa after she started bullying the store cat, Sukekiyo, almost cutting off its whiskers. After being scolded Reina developed a strong crush on Minagawa, informing her father that she was going to marry him. He was not pleased. ;Sukekiyo :A fat black cat, Sukekiyo is the store cat. If there was a mascot for the store, Sukekiyo would be it. It is rumoured that most of his body mass is made up of fur and that he was initially many different cats. Of all of the employees, Minagawa is the most attached to him. Manga Unlike many other manga, there is no central or linear plotline to the series. Instead the manga is made up of individual stories divided by shorter stories called Chichai. Live-action drama The drama CDs were adapted into a live-action drama whose 64 episodes aired on TV Tokyo from September 29, 2008 to December 26, 2008. One notable change is that the role of Mitaka Yuichi has been changed from a male shop owner to a female shop owner. Also, the actor playing Taro is noticeably older than the character's original age.

He was President of Uruguay from 1919 to 1923. Background His political convictions closely followed those of liberal President Jos√© Batlle y Ord√≥√±ez, under whom Brum served as Education Minister 1913-1915. He was Interior Minister from 1915-1916. Foreign Minister of Uruguay Brum subsequently served as Foreign Minister under the Presidency of Feliciano Viera; in the latter capacity, Brum was noted for promoting good relations with the United States, which had joined World War I against Germany in 1917. Brum's period of office as Foreign Minister proved to be somewhat controversial. In the autumn of 1917, American warships sailed to the Argentine capital Buenos Aires and a delegation issued threats to the country's President Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen, in relation to the country's neutrality, which the United States insisted should be more clearly focused as being pro-American. Yrigoyen refused to be bowed by such threats from a military delegation, whereupon the American ships sailed to Montevideo, where they were warmly welcomed by Brum, in contrast to the guarded reception which the delegation had received in Buenos Aires. Brum later travelled to the United States and was received by the Secretary of State. President of Uruguay Brum thus came to Presidential office in 1919 as one with a reputation as a pro-American facilitator of US interests. During Brum's Presidency, he was noted for pursuing economic stability, but on the political front faced significant opposition from both his own Colorado Party, and notably from Luis Alberto de Herrera of the Blanco, or National, Party. Historical and literary interests Beyond the strictly political, Baltasar Brum was noted for interests in Uruguayan history and folklore. During his Presidential term of office he took measures with a view to preserving and protecting the historic Fort of Santa Teresa in the Rocha Department and after leaving office Brum collaborated in the preparation of related literature.'Fortaleza de Santa Teresa', Wikipedia (in Spanish), :es:Fortaleza de Santa Teresa#Folclore y leyendas, President Gabriel Terra's rule by decree and Brum's suicide On March 31, 1933, on the installation of President Gabriel Terra's rule by decree, Brum attempted to lead resistance to Terra's government. After having increasingly realized during the course of that day that Terra's authoritarian rule enjoyed at least tacit support by many Uruguayans, Brum hurried into the middle of a road in Montevideo, was heard to shout \\"viva la libertad! viva Batlle!\\" (long live liberty! long live Batlle!), and committed suicide by gunshot.S9 Biographical Dictionary He was aged 49 at the time of his death. To some observers, Brum represented a self- sacrificing romantic streak within Uruguayan politics at a time when many Uruguayans were prepared tacitly to accept extrajudicial changes brought in by Terra. To others, Brum's spectacular suicide suggested the presence of elements of mental instability, which, however, was not medically proven. Family and heritage His brother Alfeo Brum later served as Vice President of Uruguay.  Honours and Awards = National Honours  * A town in Artigas Department is named after him.

It used the Silver Fern railcars and operated from 9 December 1991 until 7 October 2001.  Background  In 1928, when the East Coast Main Trunk Railway was completed to Taneatua, a passenger train commenced operating from Auckland on a slow (12-hour) schedule. Within a year this was upgraded to 10.5 hours and named the Taneatua Express. For much of its life, it ran only twice or thrice weekly. In 1959 the express was replaced by a daily railcar service using 88 seater railcars: due to negligible traffic to Taneatua, it terminated at Te Puke. It did not last long, as the circuitous rail route struggled to compete with private cars, being withdrawn from 11 September 1967. In 1980 Tauranga radio station Radio BoP started running an excursion train from Tauranga to Matamata and Rotorua via the new Kaimai Tunnel under the name Kaimai Express, using NZR locomotives and carriages from Steam Inc and Railway Enthusiasts Society. The excursions were repeated in 1981 and 1982.  Operation  In 1991, the Silver Fern railcars that operated between Wellington and Auckland were replaced by the locomotive-hauled Overlander, and they were transferred to new routes from Auckland, the Geyserland Express to Rotorua and the Kaimai Express to Tauranga. The latter train's name came from the Kaimai Tunnel through the Kaimai Ranges, opened on 12 September 1978. This gave a much faster and more direct route to the Bay of Plenty, substantially faster than the Taneatua Express and 88-seater railcars. The first Kaimai Express ran on 9 December 1991, a morning service from Tauranga to Auckland and a return afternoon service, taking roughly 3.5 hours in each direction. In 2000 timings were changed to enable the introduction of the Waikato Connection morning and evening commuter service between Hamilton and Auckland. The southbound service departed Auckland at 8:20am and reached Tauranga 3 hours 31 minutes later at 11:51am, northbound from Tauranga at 1:05pm to Auckland at 4:34pm, 3 hours 29 minutes later. Consideration was made at one point by Tranz Rail to extend the service to Mount Maunganui, but this did not eventuate due to the cost of building a platform at Mount Maunganui which would be required. Whilst the Kaimai Express service had the potential to compete with car and bus services, a lack of marketing and advertising resulted in insufficient patronage for the service to be profitable, and in 2001 it was announced that the service was too uneconomic to continue. No subsidies came forth from the government and no private companies wished to invest in it. It operated for the final time on 7 October 2001.

He was deselected in 1959, losing his seat in the House of Commons, as a result of campaigning for homosexual law reform. Background Born at 16 Malone Road in Belfast, Hyde was schooled in England at Sedbergh, Cumbria. His father, James Johnstone Hyde, was a linen merchant and Unionist councillor for Cromac. Hyde took pride in his family connection to the Irish linen trade. Although his mother came from a Protestant Home Rule background, all were involved in the 1914 UVF gun running, the seven-year-old Harford being a dummy casualty for first-aid practice. He attended Queen's University Belfast where he gained a first-class history degree, and then Magdalen College, Oxford, and a second-class law degree. He was married in 1939 to Dorothy Mabel Brayshaw Crofts (divorced 1952); in 1955 to Mary Eleanor Fischer (dissolved 1966) and finally to Rosalind Roberts Dimond. By his will, the residue of his estate was left to his widow Robbie and his papers to the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland. Hyde when an MP lived at Bertha House, 71 Malone Road, Belfast. Early career Hyde was called to the Bar in 1934, working briefly in London and on the North East circuit. His first salaried employment was with the 7th Marquess of Londonderry whose wife Edith was a London political hostess, and whose influence on prominent Labour Party politician Ramsay MacDonald (who became prime minister) was held by some to be suspect. From 1935 until 1939, Hyde was librarian and private secretary to the marquess in his \\"appeasement\\" period, hired specifically to research the family papers and write its history. His works on the family included Londonderry House and its Pictures (1937), The Rise of Lord Castlereagh (1933), a book which remains very highly regarded, and The Londonderrys: A Family Portrait. Secret intelligence agent He joined the British Army Intelligence Corps in 1939, serving as an Assistant Censor in Gibraltar in 1940. He was then commissioned in the intelligence corps (MI6) and engaged in counter-espionage work in the United States under Sir William Stephenson, the Director of British Security Coordination in the Western Hemisphere. Hyde was also Military Liaison and Security Officer, Bermuda, from 1940 to 1941 and Assistant Passport Control Officer in New York from 1941 to 1942. He was with British Army Staff, USA from 1942 to 1944, attached to the Supreme HQ Allied Expeditionary Force in 1944, and then seconded to the Allied Control Commission for Austria until 1945 as a legal officer.

He would continue to cover the topic of espionage in his writings.H. Montgomery Hyde, Was Stalin a police spy? The Times, 10 July 1971 He wrote Secret Intelligence Agent (1982, describing his war experiences). After the war, he became assistant editor of the Law Reports until 1947, and was legal adviser to the British Lion Film Corporation, then managed by Alexander Korda, up to 1949. In 1948 he published The Trials of Oscar Wilde, a precursor of three further books about Wilde. Politics 1950‚Äì1959 Hyde had planned a parliamentary career since the 1930s, and actively scouted for seats until the war intervened, postponing an election until 1945. He then applied for the South Belfast Unionist candidature, and was unfortunate enough to miss the nomination by one vote. Five years later, North Belfast was to select him. He could have expected to hold his seat for a quarter of a century or more. In the event, he represented the constituency for just nine years. His maiden speech was on the contentious subject of the difficulty of enforcement of Northern Ireland maintenance orders in Great Britain, and the consequent problem of border-hopping husbands. He was a UK delegate to the Council of Europe Consultative Assembly in Strasbourg from 1952 to 1955, majoring on simplifying European visa and border controls. He was also an incessant traveller; a visit in 1958 to East Germany and Czechoslovakia got him into difficulty with political exiles, when he lamely defended himself saying, \\"There are terrible things going on. Cultural matters are a safe subject in common.\\" Hyde was Unionist MP for Belfast North, elected in 1950, and re- elected in 1951 and 1955. Deselection He was deselected by his party in 1959, after arguing in favour of the decriminalisation of homosexuality in a debate about implementing the Wolfenden report on 26 November 1958, a debate he had been most prominent in seeking. Indeed, Hyde was the most vocal of any MP in the 1950s about homosexual law reform.Belfast Telegraph centenary of birth article 14 August 2007 Hyde's reselection failed to be ratified by 171 votes to 152. He was absent for the vote, being on an international tour. By 19 votes, the Unionist Party lost its one respected voice at Westminster and abroad, and the only MP who ever advised his people of changing times, while attempting to modernise and moderate Unionist opinion. The Belfast Telegraph reported, \\"Mr Hyde's rejection is a result of criticism amongst constituents over his attitude over certain problems particularly the Wolfenden report, capital punishment and the return of the Lane pictures to Ireland; further there was a feeling he did not visit the division sufficiently.\\" One view expressed was that as the vote was so close he might have carried the day, had he been present. Two days later, from Belize City, Hyde complained that it was a \\"rank discourtesy holding the meeting without him\\", especially as there were 3,000 members in the constituency. His wife in London the next day said, \\"I shall advise him to cut out the rest of his tour if that is possible and deal with the matter on the spot.\\" She had however written earlier to him in Jamaica: \\"SO THAT'S THAT. I'm sorry darling perhaps it's for the best. No more politics. No more Belfast politics. Oh bliss.\\"Jeffrey Dudgeon (2018), H. Montgomery Hyde: Ulster Unionist MP, Gay Law Reform Campaigner and Prodigious Author, Belfast Press, p. 38 Hyde did make efforts to have the decision overturned by Unionist Party headquarters on procedural grounds but he had no high-level political support. Although he had made little secret of his progressive views during the capital punishment debates, the campaign for access to the Roger Casement diaries, and his writings on Oscar Wilde, Hyde's political undoing were his parliamentary interventions and outspoken views on the decriminalisation of homosexuality. He contributed a half-hour speech to that 1958 debate covering both aspects of the Wolfenden report. He concluded by demanding equality for the homosexual and the prostitute. Earlier he quoted a letter from a consenting adult who had been jailed and released, only to be informed on again, losing his new job. He pointed out \\"three popular fallacies that have been exposed by the Report\\": that \\"male homosexuality always involves sodomy\\", that homosexuals are \\"necessarily effeminate\\", and that most relevant court cases \\"are of practising male homosexuals in private\\". Only one hundred men a year, he said, were convicted of sex in private with consenting adults. Hyde's reform efforts at decriminalising homosexuality in England and Wales were not to be successful for another ten years. It took 25 years until 1982 for the same to happen in Northern Ireland. In later life, he became somewhat disillusioned with the cause of Irish Unionism. He famously moved a motion in Westminster calling for a tunnel to be constructed between County Antrim and the Scottish coast. He spent 40 minutes outlining its advantages. Echoing Jules Verne, he pronounced: \\"The dreams of yesterday are the realities of today\\".Boyd, Wesley (February 2004). \\"An Irishman's Diary\\". The Irish Times (Dublin). Hyde later in 1972 wrote the first history of homosexuality in Great Britain and Ireland, The Other Love, perhaps his most memorable and long-lasting work. With its rich and detailed narratives, \\"fusing legal knowledge with illustrative anecdotage,\\" it was the most extensive book on the subject. Antony Grey, secretary of the Homosexual Law Reform Society (HLRS) provided case histories and cuttings from the society's files for its contemporary section. Academia He was an extension lecturer in History at the University of Oxford in 1934, and professor of History and Political Science at the University of Lahore from 1959 to 1962. He also wrote a number of biographies of legal and political figures and books on spying, notably Room 3603 (1962) about Sir William Stephenson and the wartime efforts of British Security Coordination. He also wrote a biography of the British spy Amy Elizabeth Thorpe with the British Security Coordination code name \\"Cynthia\\". Hyde also wrote extensively about the Oscar Wilde trials and Wilde's immediate circle, the trial of Sir Roger Casement, and T. E. Lawrence. His involvement in progressive and controversial issues did not cease after he left parliament. He continued his work opposing capital punishment while he published two articles in May 1965 in the Sunday People to advance the cause of homosexual law reform. The second entitled \\"The Million Women\\", appeared after the House of Commons had rejected Leo Abse's first Bill, showing \\"itself more reactionary than the Lords\\", as he stated. That article dealt with lesbians whose \\"association\\" was not regarded as an offence, and \\"Sappho the poetess who wrote passionate verses about the lovely maidens who gathered round her.\\" Hyde was awarded an honorary degree by Queen's University Belfast in 1984. He lived at Westwell House, Tenterden, in Kent, in a house once inhabited by Horatio Nelson's daughter. Hyde was earlier a tenant of Lamb House in Rye, once home to his distant cousin, Henry James. He worked up to his death on 10 August 1989, just short of his eighty-second birthday. His third wife Robbie survived him. Many of his papers are in the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI). Others were sold to the University of Texas at Austin.

As soon as these two substances had been mixed together, I saw with astonishment that, without the aid of heat, the blue color had entirely disappeared; the powder [i.e., precipitate] at the bottom of the flask had only a rather gray color: having put this vessel on a sand bath in order to heat the solution until it simmered, this gray color also disappeared entirely, and all that was contained in the flask, both the powder [i.e., precipitate] and the solution, had only a yellow color [that was] a little red.); see p. 31.

The current lineup consists of Smith, guitarist Kavus Torabi, bassist James Sedwards and keyboardist Emmett Elvin of Chrome Hoof. Music Guapo have affiliations with the Rock in Opposition movement, after performing with bands such as Magma and Present at the Rock in Opposition Festival at Carmaux, France in 2007. The Trilogy The Guapo album Elixirs concludes a recondite trilogy of recordings initiated by Five Suns (2003) and Black Oni (2004), which has been referred to as the \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" record. Every record takes on new musical hues and offers disparate ideas and perspectives. However, an upheaval in the line-up, which of recent years had been anchored by the trio of Daniel O'Sullivan, Matthew Thompson, and David Smith, triggered a change in course when Thompson left the band in 2005. Other projects Both Smith and O'Sullivan perform in the antique-prog band Miasma & the Carousel of Headless Horses. Smith created a large scale, multi media installation entitled \\"The Other Side of the Island\\" for which he made a soundtrack with O‚ÄôSullivan and Antti Uusimaki under The Stargazers Assistant moniker (the recordings of which were released on Aurora Borealis last year). Smith also plays with members of Coil, Cyclobe and Shock Headed Peters in the Amal Gamal Ensemble. Despite these distractions, Guapo has been maintained as a primary focus and \\"Elixirs\\" has been three years in the making. Line-up Following the departure of Thompson, O‚ÄôSullivan and Smith added two London musicians to the fold, James Sedwards (of avant-rock band Nought) and Kavus Torabi (of Cardiacs, Knifeworld and formerly The Monsoon Bassoon). The line-up toured the US in 2006 with synth-prog band, Zombi. O'Sullivan recently left the band to concentrate on other projects (√Üthenor (Vhf Records), Mothlite (Southern Records), Grumbling Fur as well as moonlighting in the live line-up of Sunn O)))) and keyboardist Emmett Elvin recently joined. More recently Sam Warren (Tunguska Butterfly, Thumpermonkey) has joined on bass. Press Taken from Ipecac Recordings in reference to the release of Black Oni, produced by Jaime Gomez Arellano. \\"Guapo have conjured a harrowingly complex and unflinchingly epic piece of work. Heady and hypnotic, driving and relentless, tumultuous and visceral, sonic and serene, the sheer odyssey that is Black Oni encompasses many paradoxes in its massively dynamic scope. Picking up where they left off from their previous Cuneiform Records release Five Suns (2002), the band continue to expand on their palette of dexterous chamber-rock anomalies, modal transcendence, and apocalyptic death marches, and like its predecessor, Black Oni is one singular piece of music, making it the second record in a trilogy of large-scale symphonic forms. Incorporating elements of prog, avant-garde jazz, kraut-rock, minimalism and a range of folk mediums from Britain to Indonesia, Guapo take their queue from a disparate array of influences including Magma, King Crimson, Boredoms, Goblin, Sun Ra, Charlemagne Palestine, Univers Zero, This Heat, Olivier Messiaen and Popol Vuh. The assembly of Dave Smith's explosive drum assaults, Matt Thompson's brazen and prowling bass throb, and Daniel O'Sullivan's ethereal keyboard reveries telepathically collide in an augury of rich and cinematic musical ceremony.

The island is long and wide. It is one of the most unspoiled islands in Andaman Sea and in all of Thailand. Ko Tarutao is located about north of Langkawi Island in Malaysia. The Malay word tertua or tarutao means old and primitive.  Overview  There is a concrete road running through the island, but the terrain is rugged and mountainous with several peaks stretching more than high. The highest peak is high. Most of the island territory is covered in dense, old growth jungle. Mangrove trees and limestone cliffs cover much of the island shores. The western coast has long and wide white-sand beaches which are historical nestling ground sites for turtles. Langurs, crab-eating macaques and wild pigs are common on the island. Ao Son beach on the west side of the island is over long and over wide. From its eastern side the larger island of Ko Tarutao is encircled by over 10 smaller offshore islands and limestone karst islets, such as Ko Sing, Ko Kaman, Ko Ko Lo, Ko Klang, Ko Pulao Na, Ko Daeng, Ko Laen, Ko Lek, and others.  History  A dock and limestone cliff near the old prison site on the east side of the island Ko Tarutao is a place of historical importance. Between 1938 and 1948, more than 3000 Thai criminals and political prisoners were held here, including Sittiporn Gridagon, the son of Rama VII. During World War II, food and medical supplies from the mainland were depleted and many prisoners died from malaria. Those who survived, both prisoners and guards, became pirates in the nearby Strait of Malacca. Later they were suppressed by British troops in 1951 to deter the rise of more prisoners. In 2002, Ko Tarutao was used as the filming location for Survivor: Thailand.

Life and career Henry Burchard Fine (1858 ‚Äì 1928) played a critical role in modernizing the American university and raising American mathematics ‚Äúfrom a state of approximate nullity to one verging on parity with the European nations‚Äù. This tribute in Oswald Veblen‚Äôs obituary [see in \\"Obituary\\" below] accurately recognized Fine‚Äôs role both in training American mathematicians to provide international leadership to this field and in building Princeton University‚Äôs reputation in mathematics and science. Fine‚Äôs efforts contributed greatly toward making Princeton the site of Albert Einstein‚Äôs first North American lectures, and eventually his home. Fine began his time as a Princeton undergraduate studying Greek and Latin, but a mathematics tutor, George B. Halstead, convinced him to switch his considerable talents to mathematics. He ranked highest academically in his Class of 1880 for all four years, during which he caught the attention of President James McCosh. As a result, Fine was among a small group of highly talented undergraduates whom McCosh invited to his house for informal seminars and nurtured as future faculty. After graduation, Fine remained at Princeton (then called the College of New Jersey) for a year of post-graduate work followed by three more years as a tutor. Then, as Germany was the leading center of mathematics scholarship, he went to the University of Leipzig to study mathematics with Felix Klein under whom he earned his PhD in one year. He returned to Princeton as an Assistant Professor of Mathematics in 1885 and soon established himself as a leader in the faculty, ultimately named the Dod Professor of Mathematics in 1898. In addition, his reputation beyond Princeton grew through publications and his role as one of the founding members of the American Mathematical Society. However, it was reviving his undergraduate friendship with Woodrow Wilson (Class of 1879) that led to his subsequent impact on Princeton and American scholarship. Fine, (Class of 1880), one year behind Wilson, assisted him as a junior and then succeeded him as Managing Editor of the \\"Princetonian\\", the campus‚Äô student newspaper. When Wilson joined the Princeton faculty in 1890 their relationship resumed, beginning a close and consequential lifelong friendship. After McCosh‚Äôs retirement in 1888, the College of New Jersey‚Äôs new President, Francis Landey Patton, was satisfied to preside over what he called \\"the best country club\\" in the country. However, the young faculty whom McCosh had nurtured, including Fine, and their allies on the Board of Trustees grew restive and pushed him out in favor of Wilson in 1902. Wilson quickly chose Fine to be his right-hand man as the Dean of the College. They set about transforming Princeton by raising academic standards, revising the curriculum, and replacing several senior faculty members. Wilson also convinced the Trustees to hire 50 new young faculty members he called ‚Äòpreceptors‚Äô. The addition of this large number of young, enthusiastic junior faculty had a significant impact on the quality, focus and seriousness of Princeton at both the undergraduate and graduate school levels. Because Wilson lacked interest in science and mathematics, he delegated the preceptor appointments to Fine, giving him the opportunity to transform Princeton‚Äôs programs in those fields. Fine had an extraordinary ability to identify talented individuals in these fields and a commitment to promoting their careers. His initial preceptorial appointments all went on to become respected mathematicians and when some vacancies developed, he replaced them with similar young talent. He also recruited established American and European mathematicians. By 1911, Princeton‚Äôs Department of Mathematics ranked as one of the top three in America and had become the home of the prestigious Annals of Mathematics. In addition, Fine jump-started Princeton‚Äôs weak science departments by recruiting some leading scientists, including mathematical physicist James Jeans , physicist Owen Wilnans Richardson Owen Willans Richardson, and biologist Edwin Grant Conklin Edwin Conklin. Fine also nurtured younger scientists such as astronomer Henry Norris Russell. Fine‚Äôs time was increasingly focused on administration and the controversies that eventually dragged down the Wilson presidency. He and Wilson won one battle, gaining control of the Graduate School from Wilson‚Äôs archenemy, Andrew Fleming West. While ceremonial leadership remained with West, Fine became the dominant force in turning Princeton into a modern research university. However, Wilson lost his attempt to reduce the influence of Princeton‚Äôs undergraduate ‚Äòeating clubs‚Äô and to have the Graduate College constructed in the middle of campus. When Wilson left to enter politics, Fine became acting president in all but name, while also serving as President of the American Mathematical Society. Although Fine had loyally supported Wilson‚Äôs losing proposals and was a leading candidate to become president, he then loyally supported President John Grier Hibben for the rest of his career. With Hibben‚Äôs ascendance, Fine became in reality what he had long been, Dean of the Departments of Science, a position he held until his death 1928. He remained deeply loyal Princeton, turning down offers of the presidency of M.I.T. and Johns Hopkins University as well as Wilson‚Äôs offers to name him Ambassador to Germany and to the Federal Reserve Board. Fine continued teaching, publishing leading textbooks and occasional articles, and building his departments. The Department of Mathematics‚Äô prestige led, in 1921, to it hosting Albert Einstein‚Äôs first American lectures. In the 1920s, Fine was particularly successful in raising money from the General Education Board and Rockefeller Foundation to support Princeton‚Äôs growing science programs. As a consequence, in the 1920s only the University of Chicago attracted more National Research Council Fellowships and no Princeton application was rejected. [Roger Geiger, To Advance Knowledge, (1986), 200-203] In addition to his duties as Dean of Science, Fine served on numerous campus committees, especially chairing the Board of Athletic Control. In the community he served on and chaired the Board of Education for many years. His final gift to Princeton and mathematics was a consequence of his tragic death. His sister had founded Miss Fine‚Äôs School and his brother founded Princeton Preparatory School. Bicycling to visit the latter on a dark December evening in 1928 he was struck and killed by a car. In response, his close friend and wealthy Princeton Trustee, Thomas D. Jones, funded construction of Fine Hall, arguably the finest mathematics building in the country. Jones' response to cost overruns was \\"nothing is too good for Harry Fine.\\" [Princeton Alumni Weekly, Oct. 30, 1931] Finished in 1931, Fine Hall also served as the first home of the new Institute of Advanced Study , and of its most distinguished faculty member, Albert Einstein, until its separate building was completed in 1939. The other founding faculty member, and the person who convinced the funders to situate the IAS in Princeton, was Oswald Veblen, one of Fine‚Äôs original preceptors. Although he spent his entire career at one institution, Fine‚Äôs career is an important chapter in the emergence of the American university. Whereas he had been drawn to Germany for his PhD in the 1880s, shortly after his death, Princeton University and the Institute of Advanced Study surpassed G√∂ttingen as the world‚Äôs center of mathematical physics. And he had played a major role in that transformation. Henry Fine was one of the founders of the American Mathematical Society and served as its President in 1911‚Äì1912.

He was born on 9th Jamadi-us-Sani 1326, 9 July 1908 in Hyderabad, India. He was the eldest son of Maulvi Sharaf Hussain Khan, a nobleman from Hyderabad. He got his basic Islamic education from his father who taught him till the age of 5. He did matriculation from Hyderabad, Intermediate-high school from Shia College, Lucknow. He was awarded a BA from Osmania University (Hyderabad, India) and MA in Philosophy from University of Allahabad, India. He delivered more than 5,000 religious lectures and speeches over the period of 57 years that he spent out of his 65 years of total life in the service of Ahl al-Bayt. Allama Rasheed Turabi introduced many dimensions to the Art of Oratory. The most sought after Urdu public speaker of his times, he was indeed a persuasive and brilliant orator. He was the first person who delivered religious speeches for 10 days or more on selected topics. He was a very good student of Khalifa Abdul Hakim, who directed his studies in Philosophy and English. Along with his formal studies, he drank deep at the fountain of Arabic and Persian literature. Ilm was his main forte. He was among the scholars of Islamic learning who learnt a great deal from Ayatollah- ul-Uzma Syed Hossein Borujerdi, Ayatollah-ul-Uzma Muhsin al-Hakim al- Tabatabai, Ayatollah Mohsin Tehrani, Ayatollah-ul-Uzma Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei and Ayatullah Shahrestani, etc. All of the above named renowned scholars issued Ijazah (authority letters) to Allama Rasheed Turabi to act as a scholar on Quran and Sunnah. It was one of the greatest achievements of any religious scholar of the subcontinent. Allama Rasheed Turabi started his political career as a lieutenant of Nawab Bahadur Yar Jang. He Had served as a religious orator under the Last Nizam of Hyderabad Mir Osman Ali Khan. Later on, he became the Chief of the All India State Muslim League. The Quaid E Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah nominated him as the information secretary of States Muslim League and it is from this platform that Allama Rasheed Turabi rendered valuable service to the cause of Pakistan. He migrated to Pakistan in 1949 upon the request of Quaid E Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and started addressing majalis at the Imambargahs in Kharadar, Khaliq Dina Hall and Martin Road Pakistan Quarters in Karachi. He also addressed Eid Milad-un-NabiMawlid gatherings at Aram Bagh and Jahangir Park, this went a long way in establishing his popularity within both Sunnis and Shias alike. Later on he started addressing majalis in Nishtar Park and at Imambargah Hussainian Iranian Kharadar. His first Sham-e-Gareeban Majlis was broadcast on the Radio Pakistan in 1951. It became an annual feature till his death. The last Majlis He addressed was at Khaliq Dina Hall where he had a heart attack in 1971. He continued to address Majalis at Nishtar Park against his doctor‚Äôs advice till 1973. Allama Rasheed Turabi died on December 18th, 1973 in Karachi and was later buried in Hussainia Sajadia Imambargah in North Nazimabad, Karachi.

It is all that remains of the early 16th century parish church of Hackney of St Augustine, which replaced the 13th century medieval church founded by the Knights of St John. The Tower comprises four stages beneath a restored parapet with diagonal buttressing. A fine working 16th century turret clock has remained on the third floor of the Tower since at least 1608. The Tower and contents are Grade I listed. The Tower is seen as a symbol for Hackney, and is represented in the coat of arms of the London Borough of Hackney. During the First World War, it appeared on the cap-badge of the 10th (Hackney) Battalions of the London Regiment, together with the Metropolitan Borough of Hackney motto Justitia Turris Nostra, Latin for Justice is our tower.Cap badge of the Hackney battalions https://www.britishmilitarybadges.co.uk/products/10th-hackney-battalion- county-of-london-regiment-cap-badge-2.html St Augustine's Church=History The parish church of Hackney became a sinecure rectory in 1275. This meant there was a vicar and a rector representing the parish, both positions being in the gift of the Bishop of London, and the parish served the entire area of the present London Borough of Hackney until the parish was eventually divided up in the 18th century. Many of the position holders were absentee pluralists (i.e. they had other jobs, and Hackney just formed a part of their income). From the 14th century to the 17th century the church was dedicated to St Augustine. From about 1660, the church was dedicated to St John of Jerusalem, St John the Baptist, and known as St John at Hackney, representing the links of the parish with the Order of St John of Jerusalem.Hackney: The Parish Church, A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 10: Hackney (1995), pp. 115-122 accessed: 26 July 2008 The church tower was constructed as part of the early 16th century rebuilding of the church itself, commemorated by the arms of Sir John Heron (d. 1521) carved between each arch of the nave and also placed, with those of the rector Christopher Urswick (d. 1522), in the chancel. Thereafter the church consisted of a chancel, aisled and clerestoreyed nave, and south-west tower. The \\"so-called\\" Rowe Chapel, properly a mausoleum, was built on the south side of the chancel in 1614 and a vestry was added on the north side. In 1741, the church measured along its north wall and across; the tower bore a vane surmounted by a crown which reached to . The walls, with fenestration of c.1500, showed a variety of materials, as they did at the time of the church's demolition, when the exterior presented 'an incomprehensible jumble of dissonant repairs, without a trace of the original building, except the windows of part of it'. c.1750 View of St Augustine's Tower, showing the (then) adjacent Black and White House In Tudor times, many members of the court used the church, including Ralph Sadleir (Bryck Place), Thomas Sutton (The Tan House), Thomas Cromwell and the Earl of Northumberland (Brooke House). Lady Lucy Neville (d.1583), daughter- in-law of Queen Catherine Parr, was buried there. Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford (12 April 1550 ‚Äì 24 June 1604) was probably buried here. Samuel Pepys visited the church in 1667, after resting at the local Mermaid Inn. He remarked on the fine organ but confessed in his diary that that which we went chiefly to see was the young ladies of the schools, whereof this is great store, very prettyPepys' Diary for April 1667 ‚Äì Hackney being renowned for its girls' schools at the time. The constant increasing of Hackney's population meant that galleries were added to the church, and by 1789 it was able to hold a congregation upwards of 1,000. This was still inadequate to the needs of the parish, and on the advice of architect William Blackburn,http://www.stjohnathackney.org.uk/past.shtml the vestry petitioned Parliament in 1790 for the church's complete rebuilding at an adjacent site to the north. Blackburn died suddenly in November 1790; James Spiller, a friend of John Soane, was chosen from six architect candidates to replace him as designer of the new church. The body of the old church was pulled down in 1798, with many of the monuments preserved in the new Church of St John-at- Hackney. The stone was sold as building material. The extent of the original church is marked by four cornerstones to the east of the Tower. The Tower remained to house the eight bells of Hackney; these were finally relocated in the new church in 1854, after the new church tower was underpinned to take the weight. In modern times The Tower was subsequently used as a public mortuary, and a tool shed for the gardens of St John. The Metropolitan Borough of Hackney became responsible for the maintenance of the Tower and gardens in 1912. In more recent times, the Tower was made safe in 1983, and has been used for occasional art exhibits. It is normally opened as part of London Open House each year. Since 1990, the Tower has been in the care of the Hackney Historic Buildings Trust. A grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund has made possible repairs and improvements and a permanent exhibition on the history of the Tower, and its church, is now open to the public on the last Sunday of every month. It is now possible to climb its narrow winding stairway to the roof. St John's Church Gardens, around the Tower and later church, were awarded both a Green Flag Award, and Green Flag Heritage status, in 2008.

A range of voltages has been used, employing both overhead lines and conductor rails. The two most common systems are 25 kV AC using overhead lines, and the 750 V DC third rail system used in southeast England and on Merseyrail. As at April 2019, (38%) of the British rail network was electrified.[https://dataportal.orr.gov.uk/media/1532/rail-infrastructure- assets-2018-19.pdf Rail Infrastructure and Assets 2018-19 Annual Statistical Release] Office of Rail & Road 7 November 2019 According to Network Rail, as at 2003, 64% of the electrified network used the 25 kV AC overhead system, and 36% used the 660/750 V DC third-rail system.Network Rail, 2003 Technical Plan, Chapter 11 \\"Network Capability\\", page 7 \\"Electrification\\". \\"Approximately 40% of the rail network is currently equipped with electrification.\\" From page 1, total network is 30,764 km, 7,587 km of 25 kV AC, 4,285 km of 650/750 V DC and 28 km of 1500 V DV. Excludes CTRL, LUL, Old Danby test track, bulk of Tyne and Wear Metro, etc. NB it does not state what method of counting length of network is used - i.e. sidings, loops, double track etc. produce different numbers. The UIC statistics that are used in the chart showing electrification in Europe is based solely on line length. Thus, on this count, 11,900 km (38.7%) is electrified. Of the electrified network, 63.8% is 25 kV AC, 36.0% is 650/750 V DC and 0.2% is 1,500 V DC. The electrified network is set to expand over coming years, as 25 kV electrification is extended to currently unelectrified lines such as the Midland Main Line, and lines in the North of England as part of the Northern Hub. History The first electric railway in Great Britain was Volk's Electric Railway in Brighton, a pleasure railway, which opened in 1883, still functioning to this day. The London Underground began operating electric services using a fourth rail system in 1890 on the City and South London Railway, now part of the London Underground Northern line. The Liverpool Overhead Railway followed in 1893, being designed from the outset to be electric traction, unlike the City and South London Railway which was designed to be cable hauled initially. Main line electrification of some suburban lines began in the early years of the 20th century, using a variety of different systems. The Mersey Railway converted to 600 V DC electric multiple-unit operation on 3 May 1903, thus eliminating the problems caused by steam traction in the long tunnel under the River Mersey, and the Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway's Liverpool Exchange to Southport (and on to Crossens) suburban commuter line was similarly electrified at 625 V by March 1904. Both of these lines initially used a fourth rail system, In 1921, a government committee chose 1,500 V DC overhead to be the national standard, but little implementation followed and many different systems co-existed. During the interwar period, the Southern Railway adopted the 660 V DC third rail system as its standard and greatly expanded this system across its network of lines South of London. After World War II and the nationalisation of the railways in 1948, British Railways (BR) expanded electrification at both 1,500 V DC overhead and 660/750 V third rail. In 1956, BR adopted 25 kV AC overhead as standard for all projects outside logical extensions of third-rail systems. The 25 kV AC network has continued to expand slowly, and large areas of the country outside London are not electrified. In 2007, the government's preferred option was to use diesel trains running on biodiesel, its White Paper Delivering a Sustainable Railway,Delivering a Sustainable Railway - White Paper CM 7176 ruling out large-scale railway electrification for the following five years. In May 2009, Network Rail launched a consultation on large-scale electrification, potentially to include the Great Western Main Line and Midland Main Line and smaller \\"in-fill\\" schemes. Key benefits cited were that electric trains are faster, more reliable and cause less track wear than diesel trains.Rail Magazine 3‚Äì16 June 2009 \\"Network Rail's strategy to extend electrification by 3,000 miles\\" page 6 On 5 June 2009, Lord Adonis was appointed Secretary of State for Transport, and announced the plans to electrify the Great Western Main Line from London as far as Swansea, as well as infill electrification schemes in the North West of England. In Scotland, where transport is devolved to the Scottish Government, Transport Scotland is extending electrification, for example, on the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link. This is part of a larger plan that sees many major routes in central Scotland electrified, including the main ‚Äì route. In July 2012 the UK government announced ¬£4.2 billion of new electrification schemes, all at 25 kV AC and reconfirmed schemes previously announced by Adonis. These were to be Northern Hub, Great Western Main Line, South Wales Main Line, Midland Main Line, Electric Spine, Crossrail, Gospel Oak to Barking Line and West Midlands suburban lines including the Cross-City Line. Rail transport in Scotland is a devolved matter for the Scottish Government, but they too have pursued electrification with multiple schemes in the Central Belt. All these have been 25 kV AC, as in England and Wales. On 25 June 2015 the government announced that some of the electrification projects would be delayed or cut back because of rising costs. Electrification work was to be \\"paused\\" on the Trans-Pennine route between York and Manchester and on the Midland main line between Bedford and Sheffield. Electrification of the Great Western main line would go ahead but the status of the Reading-Newbury and Didcot-Oxford sections was unclear. However, in September 2015, the electrification work was \\"un-paused\\", but with a delayed completion date. Since then there have been regular updates including one published in October 2016. On 20 July 2017 Chris Grayling the Secretary of State for Transport cancelled a number of electrification projects citing disruptive works and use of bi-mode technology as an alternative.https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40669869 In June 2018, Electrification has not been without controversy with cancellations and various appearances of the Secretary of State for Transport called before the Transport Select Committee. The Transport Select Committee published its report into various matters including regional investment disparity on the railways and calling again for the reinstatement of various cancelled electrification schemes. A written question was submitted and answered in parliament regarding route miles electrified in the years 1997-2019. In March 2019 the Railway Industry Association published a paper on Electrification cost challenge suggesting ways forward and a rolling program of electrification. Future of third rail In June 2011, Peter Dearman of Network Rail suggested that the third-rail network will need to be converted into overhead lines. He stated, \\"Although the top speed is 100 mph, the trains cannot go over 80 mph well and 25% of power is lost from heat\\". Agreeing that conversion would be expensive, he said that the third rail network is at the limit of its power capability, especially as trains become more advanced in technology.Rail Magazine: Issue 673, Page 14-15, 29 June - 12 July 2011. The July 2012 Department for Transport High Level Output Specification for Network Rail Control Period 5 includes the conversion of the South Western Main Line between and from 750 V DC third rail to 25 kV AC overhead as part of a scheme to improve rail freight capacity from Southampton Port. This conversion is a pilot scheme to develop a business case for full conversion of the third rail network.http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/hlos-2012/railways-act-2005.pdf paragraph 37 The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) has also stated that on safety grounds - third rail 750 V DC has a limited future.http://orr.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/17621/dc-electrification- policy-statement.pdf Existing systems ‚Äì overhead line (OHL)=National Rail: 25 kV, 50 Hz AC overhead British Railways chose this as the national standard for future electrification projects outside of the third rail area in 1956. Following this, a number of lines that were originally electrified at a different voltage were converted, and a number of lines have been newly electrified with this system. Work started in the late 1950s. The first major electrification project using 25 kV was the West Coast Main Line (1959-1974). The 25 kV network has been gradually expanded ever since: = Existing = ;Great Western Main Line *Electrified from London Paddington via Reading, Swindon and Bristol Parkway to Cardiff Central. *Electrified from Reading to Newbury. *Electrified from London Paddington to Heathrow Terminal 4 in 1994 in a joint venture between British Rail and the British Airports Authority using the Mark 3B series. An electric express on the West Coast Main Line in the 1970s. ;West Coast Main Line: *Electrified from London Euston during the late 1950s and mid-1960s using the Mark 1 series under the BR 1955 Modernisation Plan to Crewe, extended to Glasgow Central in 1974 using the Mark 3A range. *Northampton: see Northampton Loop Line. *Birmingham New Street: see Rugby- Birmingham-Stafford Line. *Crewe to Liverpool Lime Street. *Stafford to Manchester Piccadilly: see Stafford to Manchester Line and Crewe to Manchester Line. *The \\"Abbey Flyer\\" (St Albans Branch Line) was electrified in 1987-88 by Network SouthEast. *Edinburgh Waverley in 1989 (from Carstairs Junction in conjunction with East Coast Main Line electrification) *In 2003, the Crewe to Kidsgrove section of the Crewe to Derby Line was electrified as a diversionary route for the WCML. *Since 1999, the line has been modernised and the overhead line equipment has been refurbished and renewed from Mark 1 / Mark 3A to UK1 range to allow an increase line speeds from 110 mph to 125 mph (with 140 mph capability in areas previously fitted with Automatically Tensioned Mark 1 equipment - subject to upgrading of the balance weight arrangement to provide individually tensioned contact / catenary wires and regrading of the contact wires). At the same time sections of the line are being progressively changed to autotransformer system. ;Midland Main Line *Electrified between London St Pancras and Bedford in 1983 using the Mark 3B range, and Dock Junction to Moorgate - now cut back to Farringdon. *Electrification from Bedford to Kettering and Corby using the UK Master Series (MS125) range is expected by Spring 2021 (MML Phase 1), further extensions to Leicester, Nottingham Trent Junction and Sheffield (via Derby) by 2023 (MML Phase 2) were cancelled in July 2017. However the section from Clay Cross to Sheffield will eventually be electrified by 2033 as part of HS2. ;High Speed 1 * Newest main line, completed in 2007. Links London St Pancras with Ashford International and the Channel Tunnel. InterCity 225 on the East Coast Main Line ;East Coast Main Line: *Electrified in two parts: 1975-78, and 1984‚Äì91 *The line between London King's Cross and Royston was electrified between 1976 and 1978 using the Mark 3A range as part of the Great Northern Suburban Electrification Project. This included the Hertford Loop Line. The section between and Cambridge was electrified in 1988 using the Mark 3B range. *In 1984, authority was given to electrify to Edinburgh and Leeds. The section between Hitchin and Peterborough was completed in 1987, and Doncaster and York were reached in 1989. By 1990, electrification had reached Newcastle, and in 1991 Edinburgh Waverley. The Mark 3B range was used throughout the electrification scheme, certain areas are presently being upgraded to the Mark 3D design range, this will eliminate known corrosion issues with the AWAC catenary and replace solid stainless steel droppers with flexible copper current carrying designs. Some headspan to portal conversions are also taking place. *In order to keep construction teams working, two additional schemes were authorised, to and North Berwick (North Berwick Line). *At the peak of the electrification project during the late 1980s, it was claimed to be the \\"longest construction site in the world\\" at over . ;West Anglia / Fen Line: This covers the lines from (Bethnal Green Junction) to Chingford, Enfield Town, Hertford East and . In the 1960s, the lines to Chingford, Enfield Town and Cheshunt were electrified at 6.25 kV, from Cheshunt to and at 25 kV. The Lea Valley line between Coppermill Junction and Cheshunt was electrified at 25 kV in 1969. All the 6.25 kV areas were converted to 25 kV in 1983. In 1987, electrification was extended from Bishop's Stortford to Cambridge at 25 kV. In 1990 the line to opened, and in 1992 electrification was extended from Cambridge to along the Fen Line. ;Great Eastern Main Line: *London Liverpool Street to Norwich. *Converted from 1,500 V DC (see 1,500 V DC section \\"Shenfield Metro\\") Converted from 6.25 kV/1,500 V DC to a combination of AT and FT 25 kV Mark GE (Great Eastern) between 1976 and 1980. Presently being upgraded to the GEFF (Great Eastern Furrer + Frey) range altering the catenary from a compound to simple sagged arrangement. *Romford to Upminster Line *Shenfield to Southend Line *Crouch Valley Line *Braintree Branch Line *Colchester to Clacton Line *Mayflower Line *Sunshine Coast Line ;London, Tilbury and Southend Railway London Fenchurch Street to Shoeburyness. The majority was originally electrified at 6.25 kV, final sections converted to 25 kV in March 1989. ;London Overground Local lines within London electrified with 25 kV are: *North London Line, between and . *Lea Valley Lines *Gospel Oak to Barking line *Various other suburban lines in the north of the city are electrified as part of other routes mentioned above. ;West Midlands *West Coast Main Line routes electrified in the 1960s: **Trent Valley Line **Stone to Colwich Line **Rugby-Birmingham-Stafford Line **Stafford to Manchester Line **Walsall to Wolverhampton Line *Commuter lines out of : **Cross-City Line: electrified 1993 **Chase Line: New Street to Rugeley Trent Valley completed 2017 ;Manchester and North West area *Manchester to Glossop / Hadfield (converted from the truncated 1500 V DC Manchester-Sheffield-Wath electric railway) *Manchester to Liverpool via Earlestown Line: electrified in 2015 as part of the Northern Hub project. *Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway (part was converted to Manchester Metrolink) *Styal Line: including branch to *Manchester to Preston: via Bolton and Chorley completed 2019 *Preston to Blackpool North: completed 2018 *Stafford to Manchester Line: branch of the WCML, electrified in the wake of the BR 1955 Modernisation Plan *Crewe to Manchester Line: branch of the WCML, electrified in the wake of the 1955 Modernisation Plan ;Leeds area In 1994, a project to electrify some of the local lines around Leeds was given authority to proceed. The project was called the \\"Leeds North West Electrification\\", which electrified: *Airedale Line to Skipton and *Wharfedale Line to Ilkley *Wakefield Line electrified in 1989 as part of the East Coast Main Line electrification to London King's Cross * In 2020 the electrification of the first part of the stalled Trans Peninne project, from Leeds to Dewsbury and Huddersfield, was approved and work also commenced on the York to Church Fenton section of the York to Leeds line. ;Edinburgh: *In 1991, the ECML to Edinburgh was electrified. A few local routes were also electrified. *Edinburgh Crossrail: Edinburgh Waverley to . The service is by DMUs, pending reopening of part of the Waverley Line. *North Berwick Line: Edinburgh Waverley to *Glasgow to Edinburgh via Carstairs Line: some North Berwick Line trains continue to . Intercity trains from the ECML continue to Glasgow Central. ;Central Scotland: The route from Edinburgh to Glasgow via Bathgate has been reinstated between Bathgate and Airdrie and electrified throughout. It opened on 11 December 2010. The electrification of the main inter-city route between Edinburgh and Glasgow Queen Street High Level via Falkirk was completed in 2017. The project, known as the Edinburgh to Glasgow Improvement Programme, entailed infill electrification in the Glasgow area and Greenhill Junction to Stirling, Dunblane and Alloa, which mainly carry commuter services. Electric services on these lines commenced in December 2018. ;Glasgow Suburban: Suburban electrification was begun during the 1960s in the wake of the BR 1955 Modernisation Plan. Electrification was piecemeal and is still incomplete, with a few commuter lines still unelectrified such as the East Kilbride branch and Glasgow to Anniesland via Maryhill, and the mainline from Glasgow to Carlisle via Kilmarknock and Dumfries. The Glasgow Suburban railway network can be divided into three main areas: *North Clyde Line: also known as the \\"Glasgow North Electric Suburban Line\\", one of the first lines in Glasgow electrified in 1960 (, and to Glasgow Queen Street (Low Level) and to and ). *South Clyde: the Cathcart Circle Line (Glasgow Central to Newton and ) was electrified on 22 May 1962. The Inverclyde Line (Glasgow Central to and ) was electrified in 1967. The Ayrshire Coast Line (Glasgow Central to , and ) was electrified in 1986‚Äì1987. The Paisley Canal Line was electrified to from Glasgow Central, in late 2012 extended to Paisley. *Argyle Line: between and Milngavie via Glasgow Central (Low Level) to Hamilton Circle, , and (via Hamilton, Motherwell or Holytown). There is also peak service to . On the Glasgow to Edinburgh via Carstairs Line, some North Berwick Line trains continue to Glasgow Central. A single daily East Coast intercity train from the ECML continues to and from Glasgow Central. The Shotts Line, Junction to was electrified in April 2019. The Cumbernauld Line to and the remaining section of the Motherwell to Cumbernauld Line was electrified in mid 2014. The line between Springburn and Glasgow Queen Street (High Level) has not yet been completed. Until Glasgow Queen Street High Level has been electrified, electric Cumbernauld Line trains reverse at Springburn and run through Glasgow Queen Street Low Level station. The Whifflet Line between and via was electrified in late 2014. =2010s Network Rail electrification programme= Class 800, for use on some of the newly electrified lines, being tested in 2015 In 2009, Lord Adonis was appointed Secretary of State for Transport. After a gap of more than a decade, electrification was back on the agenda and Adonis announced plans to electrify the Great Western Main Line from London to Swansea, as well as infill electrification schemes in the North West of England. In July 2012 the UK government announced ¬£4.2 billion of new electrification schemes, all at 25 kV AC and reconfirmed schemes previously announced by Adonis. These were to be Northern Hub, Great Western Main Line, South Wales Main Line, Midland Main Line, Electric Spine, Crossrail, Gospel Oak to Barking Line and West Midlands suburban lines. Rail transport in Scotland is a devolved matter for the Scottish Government but they too have pursued electrification with multiple schemes in the Central Belt. All these have been 25 kV AC also as in England and Wales. Electrification has not been without controversy with cancellations and various appearances of the Secretary of State for Transport called before the Transport Select Committee. The number of route miles electrified in these years was answered to a written question in parliament. In November 2019 the annual statistics for route miles electrified was published by the DfT and shows that 38% of the UK network is now electrified. The projects have been subject to cost overruns and delays, and on 8 November 2016 the government announced that several elements of the Great Western Main Line electrification programme would be indefinitely deferred. In an attempt to mitigate and improve the cost situation the Railway Industry Association published a report in March 2019 detailing why costs had risen and suggested ways forward. Other systems The alt=Yellow passenger train next to a stone wall =1,500 V DC, overhead= * Tyne & Wear Metro: The Tyne & Wear Metro, which opened in 1980, is now the only system left in the UK using the 1500 V DC overhead lines. Although it is often described as \\"light rail\\", it is closer to a heavy metro, using only segregated track. Much of its route follows that of the previous Tyneside Electrics, which had been converted to diesel by 1967. Since 2002, the Metro has shared main-line track on the Durham Coast Line to Sunderland. This presents a potential problem for main-line services if routes into Sunderland or Newcastle upon Tyne that use this section were to be electrified at 25 kV AC. Historically, there were more lines electrified at 1,500 V DC, but these have all since been either converted to 25 kV AC or closed. (see 1,500 V DC, overhead (historic)) =750 V DC, overhead= Tram on the Manchester Metrolink; Like most modern tram systems, it uses 750 V DC Used on several tram systems: * Edinburgh Trams * Manchester Metrolink * Sheffield Supertram * Croydon Tramlink * Nottingham Express Transit * West Midlands Metro =Other overhead systems= * Blackpool Tramway: originally 550 V DC, in 2011 upgraded to 600 V to operate more modern rolling stock. * The National Tramway Museum at Crich, Derbyshire uses 550 V DC. This voltage was chosen for maximum compatibility with its historic fleet of trams as well as more modern units. * The Wirral Tramway uses 550 V DC. * The Seaton Tramway uses 120 V DC. Existing systems - third and fourth rails=National Rail: 650 V - 750 V DC, third rail (top contact) Lines through equipped with third rail electrification. ;Southern Electric: The extensive southern third rail electric network covers South London and the southern counties of Dorset, Hampshire, Sussex, Surrey and Kent. The London and South Western Railway (L&SWR;) third-rail system at 660 V DC began before World War I from London Waterloo to suburban destinations. The Southern Railway was formed in the 1923 grouping; it adopted the L&SWR; system, and by 1929 the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR;) suburban overhead network was replaced by third rail. The South Eastern Main Line was electrified at 600 V, later upgraded to 750 V DC. The third rail extended throughout most South London lines out of all its London termini. Throughout the 1930s, there was much main line electrification, including the Brighton Main Line (including East, West Coastways and related routes in 1932-1933), the Portsmouth Direct Line (4 July 1937) and to Maidstone and Gillingham (1939). After World War II, electrification was soon resumed in the newly nationalised British Railways' Southern Region. The BR 1955 Modernisation Plan included the two-stage \\"Kent Coast Electrification\\". The Chatham Main Line was completed, followed by the South Eastern Main Line and related lines. The voltage was raised from 660 V to 750 V. Since then, all electrification has used 750 V; lines electrified before then remain at 660 V. Attention then switched to the neglected former L&SWR; area (then the South Western Division). The South Western Main Line (SWML) to Southampton Central and was electrified in 1967 and to in 1988. During sectorisation in the 1980s, Network SouthEast conducted extensive infill electrification. The Snow Hill tunnel was reopened, enabling Thameslink. The Hastings Line, Eastleigh to Fareham Line and the Oxted Line (East Grinstead branch) were electrified. This left only a few lines unelectrified: the West of England Main Line, the Wessex Main Line, the North Downs Line, the Oxted Line (Uckfield branch), and the Marshlink Line. ;Merseyrail: Two lines of the Merseyrail network; the Northern line and the Wirral line use 750 V DC third rail (see Suburban electrification of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway for its history). ;London Overground: * to (Watford DC Line). *Richmond to Stratford (North London Line). 750 V DC third rail from Richmond to Acton Central. See Suburban electrification of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway for its history. In 1970, the North London DC lines and the Class 501 EMUs used on these services were converted for third-rail operation, with the fourth rail generally being removed on sections not used by London Underground (LUL). Some fourth rail was retained in the Gunnersbury and Queens Park areas for emergency use by LUL. With the closure of Broad Street, the North London Line was joined with the Stratford to North Woolwich line; this was electrified with third rail and overhead line as far as Stratford, third rail to North Woolwich. Two branches of the Watford DC Line have been closed: to Rickmansworth in 1952 (to passengers, to goods in 1967) and to Croxley Green in 1996. The Watford DC Line between Queen's Park and Harrow & Wealdstone and the North London Line between Richmond and Gunnersbury are used by London Overground trains designed for 750 V third rail and Bakerloo line trains designed for 630 V third and fourth rail. As a compromise, the nominal line voltage is 650 V, and since 1970 the centre rail has been bonded to the return running rail. There are no special provisions required at Queens Park, where the two dissimilar systems meet, just a gap longer than one coach of a Bakerloo line train at the entry to (and exit from) the Bakerloo, which operates with a nominal -210 V on the fourth rail and +420 V on the third rail. There is no bridging of the incompatible systems as trains pass from one to the other since, like all UK electric trains intended to run extensively in tunnels, there is no continuity of traction power circuits between vehicles of the train. A similar arrangement applies between Putney Bridge and Wimbledon, where the District line runs over tracks owned by Network Rail, which is also used by South Western Railway, though normally only for stock movements. ;Northern City Line: The Northern City Line connects the East Coast Main Line to Moorgate. It was isolated by the abandonment of the 1930s New Works Programme (and the development of the Metropolitan Green Belt). Tube services were truncated at its northern end by the Victoria line in 1964 at Drayton Park. The remainder was handed over to British Rail in 1975 in conjunction with the suburban electrification of the East Coast Main Line. The line uses third-rail DC electrification between Moorgate and Drayton Park, where trains switch to 25 kV AC overhead. 630 V DC, third rail (top contact) ;Island Line (Isle of Wight): The single remaining national rail line on the Isle of Wight was electrified in 1967, so that former London Underground rolling stock could be used, due to the limited height of Ryde Tunnel. The Island Line used 630 V DC third rail, as it was a cheaper option to convert the LUL stock into third rail, and implement third rail only on the line. The rolling stock currently used is British Rail Class 483s. 630 V DC, fourth rail (top contact) alt=Spark coming from beneath electric passenger train alt=Red- and-white train pulling into outdoor station, with passengers waiting on platform ;London Underground: The London Underground is a large metro system operating across Greater London and beyond, commonly known as \\"the Tube\\". Its is made up of 11 lines; electrification began during the 1890s. It was largely unified between 1900 and 1910 and nationalised in 1933, becoming the railway component of London Transport (LT). A major expansion programme (the \\"New Works\\") was launched, in which LT took over several urban branches of mainline railways. The Underground is mostly in north London; its expansion into south London was limited by geology unfavourable to tunnelling and by the extensive main-line network, much of which was being electrified (see \\"Southern Electric\\"). The Underground uses a relatively uncommon four rail system of electrification. Two standard gauge rails are the running rails; the outer third rail carries positive current at +420 V DC and the inner fourth rail is the negative return at ‚Äì210 V DC, giving a supply voltage of 630 V DC. The chief advantage of the fourth-rail system is that, in tunnels with a metallic (usually cast-iron) lining, the return traction current does not leak into the lining causing electrolytic corrosion there or in adjacent utility mains. It also means that the two running rails are available exclusively for track circuits. The surface sections use the fourth rail solely for operational consistency; the system shares track with Network Rail in several places. Where the track is shared with 750 V third-rail stock, the central rail is bonded to the running rails and the outside rail electrified at 660 V. This allows both types of train to operate satisfactorily. The suburban network of the London & North Western Railway (LNWR) was electrified in co-operation with the Underground, but during the 1970s British Rail introduced third-rail EMUs and the sections of the LNWR suburban network not used by the Underground had the fourth rail removed (see \\"London and North Western Railway\\", above). The Underground has carried out studies to consider raising the voltage above the present 630 V nominal. New equipment at their substations does allow for a future increase to a standard 750 V nominal. In addition, the electrical equipment of new trains are also based on the use of 750 V rated equipment. So, whilst new equipment is being designed to for 750 V operation, no decision to increase the voltage has yet been made public by the Underground. 750 V DC, third rail (bottom contact) ;Docklands Light Railway: This uses bottom- contact composite third rail, with an aluminium body and a steel contact surface. The advantage of this is a low-resistance, high-current-capacity rail with a durable steel surface for current collection. The rail may be surrounded by insulating material on the top and sides to reduce the risk of electrocution to railway staff and trespassers. The bottom-contact system is less prone to derangement by snow than top contact. 600 V DC, third rail (top contact) * Glasgow Subway, electrified in 1935 250 V DC, third rail (top contact) * Hythe Pier Railway, electrified in 1922 110 V DC, third rail (top contact) *Volk's Electric Railway was originally electrified at 50 V DC, raised to 160 V in 1884 and reduced to 110 V DC during the 1980s. 100 V DC, four rail *The elevated \\"monorail\\" at the National Motor Museum, Beaulieu uses rubber tyres running on two metal tracks, one on either side of the central guide. Because it is rubber-tyred, it requires two current conductors and two collectors (hence the four-rail designation). Obsolete systems Great Britain has used different electrification systems in the past. Many of these date from the early part of the 20th century, when traction electricity was in the experimental stage. This section describes each system, in order of decreasing voltage. LB&SCR; 'Elevated Electric' train on the South London Line, about 1909 6,600 V, 25 Hz AC, overhead *Lancaster to Heysham via Morecambe: Used for an early trial of electrification; opened between 13 April and 14 September 1908. In 1953, it was converted to 50 Hz, and operated until 1966. *'Elevated Electric' London suburban lines of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR): The first large-scale suburban electrification scheme; starting with the South London Line and then extended to other commuter lines around the south of London, operational from 1 December 1909. Following the grouping into the LBSCR into the Southern Railway in 1922, all of the 6,600 V lines were converted to the 650 V DC third rail system by September 1929. 6,250 V 50 Hz AC, overhead During the initial electrification of parts of the network to 25 kV 50 Hz AC overhead, the initial solution to the limited clearance problems in suburban areas (due to numerous tunnels and bridges) in London and Glasgow was to use the lower voltage of 6.25 kV. Later technological improvements in insulation allowed these areas to be converted to 25 kV. The last sections of 6.25 kV were converted during the 1980s. ;London, Tilbury and Southend Lines: The 6.25 kV section was from Fenchurch Street to beyond Barking, with changeovers there on both the Upminster and Tilbury lines. The section between and was also at 6.25 kV. The remainder was at 25 kV. The sections electrified at 6.25 kV were converted to 25 kV during the early 1980s. ;Great Eastern Lines: The line from Liverpool Street to Southend Victoria was originally electrified at 1,500 V DC overhead during the 1940s-50s. During the early 1960s, the whole of this line was converted to 6.25 kV AC overhead, while the main line east of Shenfield was progressively electrified at 25 kV, with changeover east of Shenfield. During the early 1980s, the line was again converted, this time to 25 kV. The Cambridge line and branches from Liverpool Street was electrified in the early 1960s, with 6.25 kV out to a changeover at Cheshunt, and 25 kV beyond. The Chingford and Enfield lines were thus at 6.25 kV throughout. This route was again fully converted to 25 kV in the early 1980s. As part of the electrification onwards to Cambridge and Norwich in the 1980s, electric locomotives were transferred to these routes from the West Coast route. These locomotives would not have been able to operate at 6.25 kV. ;Glasgow Suburban network: On the North Clyde, the central section between Parkhead and before Dalmuir (Clydebank loop) and Westerton (Anniesland loop) were at 6.25 kV, with the outer sections at 25 kV. The Bridgeton and Springburn branches were thus at 6.25 kV throughout. The sections electrified at 6.25 kV were converted to 25 kV during the early 1980s. On the South Clyde, the route from Glasgow Central around the Cathcart Loop was initially at 6.25 kV, with changeovers to 25 kV at Kings Park and Muirend on the Motherwell and Neilston routes. These lines were progressively converted to 25 kV in the 1970s-80s. 3,500 V DC, overhead ;Bury to Holcombe Brook: This was electrified by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway in 1913 as part of a trial system for export. The system was converted to third rail in 1918 (see below).Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Society 1,500 V DC, overhead (historic) After World War I, the UK Government set up a committee to investigate the various systems of railway electrification; in 1921, it recommended that 1,500 V DC overhead should be the future national standard. Several schemes were implemented in its wake, but the Great Depression and World War II meant that very little work was done. Technological advances after 1945 meant that the 25 kV AC system was adopted instead for the West Coast Main line and Glasgow suburban electrification (as set out in the BR 1955 Modernisation Plan). However, at the same time, large amounts of money had been (and were still being) spent converting several lines to 1,500 V DC. ;Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway: A joint LMS and LNER scheme, it opened on 11 May 1931. The success of this scheme influenced LNER's later electrification schemes. The line was converted to 25 kV AC in 1971, but the stretch between Altrincham and Trafford Bar (plus the stretch between Trafford Bar and the Cornbrook viaduct) were later incorporated into Manchester Metrolink and converted again (this time to 750 V DC). EM1 (Class 76), 1,500 V DC electric locomotives on the Woodhead Route in 1954alt=Black-and-white photo of electric locomotive with overhead wiring at a station ;Manchester ‚Äì Sheffield ‚Äì Wath: Known as the Woodhead Route, the LNER chose this hilly (and busy) main line for its first mainline electrification, with work beginning in 1936. Due to the Depression and World War II, it was not completed until the 1950s. After completion, the government chose to standardise on 25 kV AC instead, leaving the Woodhead Route and the few other 1,500 V DC lines isolated and non-standard. The passenger locomotives were sold in 1969 and saw further service in the Netherlands. In a subsequent rationalisation, BR closed much of this route east of Hadfield in 1981 in favour of the more southerly Hope Valley Line, which serves more local communities. A section of the line between Manchester, Glossop and Hadfield remained open as part of the Manchester suburban network, and was operated by Class 506 EMU's, until it was converted to 25 kV AC in December 1984. ;Shenfield Metro: The LNER decided to electrify the to section of the Great Eastern Main Line (GEML), known as the Shenfield Metro. Civil engineering works began during the 1930s, but World War II intervened. Work was completed in 1949 and extended to and in 1956, using Class 306 (AM6) EMUs. It was converted on 4‚Äì6 November 1960, in the wake of the BR 1955 Modernisation Plan, to the new standard of 25 kV AC (initially with some sections at 6.25 kV). The rest of the GEML was subsequently electrified. ;Shildon to Newport: This line ran from Shildon (County Durham) to Newport (near Middlesbrough). The route was initially over the 1825 Stockton-to-Darlington line, then via Simpasture Junction (the former Clarence railway) through Carlton, Carlton Junction to Carlton South Junction, Bowesfield West Junction to Bowesfield Junction, through Thornaby and ending at Erimus Yard (Newport East). In the wake of the electrification of Tyneside by the NER, this coal-carrying line was electrified between 1 July 1915 and 1 January 1916 as a planned precursor to electrifying NER's busy York to Newcastle main line (part of the East Coast Main Line). The LNER removed this electrification system in 1935 (between 7 January and 8 July); the decline in the coal market making it economically unfeasible to undertake the significant renewals required to continue electric operation. The locomotives were stored for other electrified routes. 1,200 V DC, third rail (side-contact) Class 504 (1,200 V DC) train at Manchester Victoria station, weeks before closure for conversion to the Metrolink light- rail systemalt=Yellow-and-black locomotive at a covered station ;Manchester Victoria - Bury: In 1916, the line between Manchester Victoria and Bury was electrified using 1,200 V DC third rail (side contact). The line between Bury and Holcombe Brook which had been electrified using 3,500 V DC overhead in 1913 was converted to this system in 1918. It was abandoned in 1991, when the line was converted to a 750 V DC system and became part of the Manchester Metrolink.Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Society - History - P14 Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Society - History - P15 650 V DC, overhead *Swansea and Mumbles Railway 600 V DC, third rail ;Tyneside Electrics: This was electrified in 1904, in response to extensive competition from new electric trams. The concept was a success for the North Eastern Railway (NER), a noted pioneer in electrification, as passenger numbers returned to pre-tram levels. As the stock reached life expectancy in 1937, the network was remodelled by London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) to reflect the changing industrial and residential makeup of the area. Electrified at the same time was the dockside branch, where a pair of Class ES1 (formerly NER No.1 and 2) locomotives were introduced in 1905. These British Thomson-Houston locomotives operated from both the third rail and overhead line. British Rail removed the electrification between 1963 and 1967, citing the changing industrial and population makeup of the area which reduced the need for electric traction. Much of the Tyneside network was later re-electrified (using 1500 V DC overhead) as the Tyne & Wear Metro. 525 V DC, third rail alt=Old green electric locomotive in a museum ;Liverpool Overhead Railway: The Liverpool Overhead Railway was one of the earliest electric railways in Great Britain. The first section, between Alexandra Dock and Herculaneum Dock, was opened in 1893. The line connected with Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's North Mersey Branch. It was never nationalised, and closed on 30 December 1956 due to extensive corrosion throughout its iron infrastructure (which was deemed uneconomical to replace). 500 V DC, overhead *Grimsby and Immingham Railway 500 V DC, third rail ;City and South London Railway: The City and South London Railway electrification was unusual (compared with later schemes) in that it used a three-wire DC system. This meant that although the offset centre third rail was electrified at +500 volts in the northbound tunnel, it was electrified at -500 volts in the southbound tunnel. The motors on the locomotives and the incandescent electric lamps in the carriages worked, regardless of the polarity of the supply. The three-wire system was adopted because the initial system was fed directly from the dynamos in the surface power plant at the Stockwell end of the line. It was important to minimise the voltage drop as much as possible, bearing in mind the rather steep gradient on the approach to King William Street station. 440 V DC, third rail ;Post Office Railway: Underground railway under London operated by the Post Office.

Codex products include recorders and media processing systems that transfer digital files and images from the camera to post- production. In addition to these processing systems, Codex also has tools for color, dailies creation, archiving, review, and digital asset management. Codex is based out of London, UK, with offices in Los Angeles, CA, and Wellington, NZ. In April, 2019, Codex was acquired by PIX System - designer of the PIX app for online collaboration and based in San Francisco, California. Products Codex was founded in 2005, and its first product was the Codex Studio recorder. It was introduced in 2005 and was used as the capture device for early digital cameras such as the Dalsa Origin, Thomson Viper, Panavision Gensis, and Sony F23 & F35. This was followed in 2007 by the Codex Portable Recorder, and by the Codex Onboard Recorder in 2010. Codex continued to work on miniaturizing its technology, partnering with ARRI to deliver its recording technology deeply integrated inside the ALEXA XT camera, recording to new high-performance. Codex XR capture drives at up to 800MB/s. The technology was subsequently upgraded to support the requirements of the ALEXA 65 camera, with Codex SXR capture drives able to sustain 2500MB/s. Codex has continued to support ARRI with built-in recording for the ALEXA SXT and ALEXA LF cameras. They also partnered with Canon on an integrated recording solution for the Canon C700 camera and with Panasonic on the VariCam Pure camera. In 2014, Codex also launched Codex Action Cam, a RAW-capable, tiny camera head, designed as a POV, Action or Witness camera. Codex uses a \\"Virtual File System\\" meaning that when the recorded files are accessed, they can be viewed in a number of different resolutions and formats, and high performance, rugged, solid state recording media. Codex recording solutions are used on most motion pictures shot today. Early projects included Tim Burton's \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" Michael Apted's \\"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\", Joseph Kosinski's \\"Tron Legacy\\", Roland Emmerich's \\"Anonymous\\", and Ang Lee's \\"Life of Pi.\\" More recently, all Academy Awards for Best Cinematography predominately using digital capture have used Codex recording, including \\"Gravity\\", \\"Blade Runner 2049\\", \\"The Revenant\\", and \\"Roma.\\" Codex recorders are high-resolution media recording systems, designed to capture pictures and sound from digital cinematography cameras. The first cameras Codex supported were the ARRI Alexa, the Sony CineAlta series, the Panavision Genesis and the Arriflex D-21. They recorded twin 4:4:4 dual-link HD-SDI inputs for A & B camera or stereoscopic 3D work at up to 16-bits colour depth. Codex products used a touchscreen interface and removable \\"data packs\\" containing up to 10TB of raid array disk storage. Interfaces for digital cinematography cameras include single and dual-link HD-SDI and Infiniband. The Codex portable recorder 2007 saw the introduction of the Codex portable recording system. 2010 saw the introduction of the Codex onboard recording system. Based on the larger Codex portable recorder, this is another compact, battery-powered variant which offers uncompressed and wavelet-based recording.

The Headteacher is David Godfrey. It is the largest middle school in Whitley Bay, with about 730 pupils on roll and SATs results are significantly above the national average. It serves a mainly suburban catchment. Its motto is \\"What do you want to achieve?\\" Most students transfer to Whitley Bay High School at the end of Year 8 due to its close proximity. Prior to school reorganisation in the 1970s the building was a secondary modern; hence it has always had relatively good technology facilities for a middle school. History The school has had a varied history. The school was built in 1957. It closed through the summer of 1973 and turned from Whitley Bay County Secondary School into Valley Gardens Middle School . For the academic year 1973-74 it operated as a Middle School with only years 2,3 and 4. Year 1 of the Middle school commenced in 1974-75. In 2000 the school was threatened with closure after North Tyneside council wanted to turn to a two- tier system instead of the three-tier system that was then used, this did not happen. In 2002, an extra year five class was added to take the numbers from 5 classes to 6. At that time, every other year had six classes already. This move was taken to increase capacity and increase chances of getting into sixth form in later life. Also in 2002 the school governors encouraged the local education authority to provide more classrooms and modernise the buildings. Renovation Recently, the school has been renovated to fit the large number of pupils in the school. A new year five block with state-of-the-art interactive whiteboards in each classroom has been built and was opened by the former Foreign Secretary, David Miliband. These boards have now been fitted into nearly every classroom in the school. The front of the school has been rebuilt with a new main office, a head teacher's room and a meeting room. Two special needs rooms have been also built to help with the number of pupils on the special needs register. This is all to bring the school from its 1970s style into the 21st Century. Awards The school has been awarded numerous awards and trophies. One of them is the International School Award, which celebrates the school success in doing international activities such as an International Day in 2005, plus the schools high success in languages. It was presented by BBC News reader Anna Ford in 2006. The school received an Outstanding review from Ofsted in 2013.

About 500 described species are placed into 9 genera. These are generally small but robustly built flies with blue-black or metallic bodies. They are found, mainly in wooded areas, throughout the world with the exception of polar regions and New Zealand. Description For terms see Morphology of Diptera. The Lonchaeids are small flies with a black or blackish-blue body, which is often metallic, glossy, and with hyaline (lacking dark spots) wings. The head is hemispherical (shorter than high) and the lunule is well defined. The third antennal segment is usually elongated and the antennae are decumbent. Ocelli are present and the postocellar bristles are divergent. The frons is narrow in males; in females it is broad. One pair of orbital bristles is on the head. The postvertical bristles on the head are parallel or weakly divergent. Distinctive vibrissae on the head are lacking, but vibrissa-like bristles are present along the border of the mouth. A subapical bristle is absent on tibia. The wing venation is complete. The costa has two interruptions: near the humeral crossvein and before the subcostal vein. The subcostal vein varies in size. The anal vein of the wing is shortened. The abdomen is oval and rather flat, and in females has a long, sclerotized ovipositor. The ovipositor is rather long and triangular. This family is readily distinguished from the family Periscelididae by the entire subcostal vein, from the Sapromyzidae by the absence of preapical tibial bristles on at least the anterior and posterior tibia, and from Pallopteridae by the presence of a propleural bristle and the exposed frontal lunule. Morphological details of the Lonchaeidae The larva is amphipneustic (has only the anterior and posterior pairs of spiracles) slender tapering at the anterior, and smooth except for ventral creeping welts. The cephalopharyngeal skeleton of the larva consists of two stout untoothed mandibles, a dental sclerite, an elongate hypopharyngeal sclerite, a parastomal bar, and an anvil- shaped tentoropharyngeal sclerite. The anterior spiracles (prothoracic spiracles) each have five to ten papillae which are arranged in a fan shape. The posterior spiracles (on the anal segment) are placed on a raised, sclerotized posterior spiracular tubercle. Each spiracle has three oval, radially arranged slits and four groups of branched spiracular hairs. The pupa is enclosed within a puparium. Biology Lonchaea sp. oviposits into the boreholes of beetles on a fallen beech The larvae are mostly phytophagous, feeding on already damaged plant tissues, although coprophagous, mycophagous, saprophagous, and predatory species are known. Larvae may be found under bark, in tunnels of bark beetles, in decomposing wood and other decomposing plant residue, and in dung. Larvae of some species cause formation of galls on plants (including cereals), while larvae of other species live in juicy fruits (figs, etc.). Flies are found on trunks of trees, logs, cut wood, leaves of shrubs, and in grass. Some species are agricultural pests. The polyphagous and oligophagous species of the family Tephritidae (also called fruit flies) and Lonchaeidae are the main pests of horticulture in the neotropical region. Also in the neotropics, Neosilba perezi (Romero & Ruppel), known as the cassava shoot fly, is a pest of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz). Dasiops passifloris McAlpine (Diptera: Lonchaeidae) infests the fruit of the corky- stemmed passion flower Passiflora pallida L. in the Americas. Species in the genus Earomyia are pests of fir and spruce trees, destroying the seeds and cones. The black fig-fly Silba adipata McAlpine is a pest of figs. Lonchaea chorea is synanthropic and may become a nuisance pest.

One of the few remaining examples of such helmets. The nasal helmet was a type of combat helmet characterised by the possession of a projecting bar covering the nose and thus protecting the centre of the face; it was of Western European origins and was used from the late 9th century to at least . Early forms Helmet of Saint Wenceslaus, Prague The nasal helmet was characterised by the possession of a nose-guard, or 'nasal', composed of a single strip of metal that extended down from the skull or browband over the nose to provide facial protection. The helmet appeared throughout Western Europe late in the 9th century, and became the predominant form of head protection, replacing previous types of helmet whose design was ultimately based on Late Roman types such as the 'ridge helmet' and early helmets of spangenhelm construction. Early nasal helmets were universally conical in shape. The skull could be raised from a single sheet of iron or be of composite, segmented (spangenhelm) construction. The spangenhelm variety was, in general, the earlier method of construction. Single-piece skulls, being technically more difficult to produce, became more common with the increase in metallurgical skill over time.Gravett, p. 11 Though nasals had been used on earlier helmets, and on contemporary helmets found in Byzantium, Slavic Eastern Europe and the Middle East, those characteristic of the nasal helmet were in general larger and were fully integrated into either the skull or browband of the helmet.Gravett, p. 20 The nasals of other helmets tended to be riveted to the skull either directly or as part of a, 'T' shaped, combined nasal and eyebrow-piece.D'Amato, p. 33 and 47 Later developments Nasal helmet of the 'Phrygian cap' shape, 12th century Nasal helmet with a rounded skull, latter part of the 12th century From being uniformly conical in shape, the skull of the nasal helmet became more varied during the 12th century. For most of the century nasal helmets with a forward deflected apex, often called the 'Phrygian cap' shape, were in widespread use. It is possible that the deflection of the apex of the skull was the natural result of making the front of the helmet thicker than the rest of the helmet during the process of raising the skull from sheet iron.Gravett, p. 17Nicolle (1988), p. 55Nicolle (1987), p. 9 Though still used, the conical type of helmet declined in popularity during the latter half of the 12th century and round-topped nasal helmets came into fashion. King Richard I of England is depicted wearing a round-skulled nasal helmet on his first Great Seal (1189).Nicolle (1988), p. 56 The knight at the centre is wearing a flat-topped helmet. Murder of Thomas Becket, manuscript c. 1200 A further type of nasal helmet developed in the late 12th century. This helmet had a flat top and a square profile. This form of nasal helmet was the forerunner of deeper, cylindrical helmets with greater facial protection, enclosed helmets, and eventually the great helm.Nicolle (1988), p. 57 The existing nasal formed the basis for increased facial protection, eventually, by 1200, producing a face covering plate which was pierced for sight and ventilation.Gravett, p. 17 The helmet began to lose popularity at the end of the 12th century to helmets that provided more facial protection, and although the nasal helm lost popularity amongst the higher classes of knights and men-at-arms, they were still used by archers to whom a wide field of vision was crucial. Round-skulled nasal helmets can also be seen worn by a proportion knights throughout the French Maciejowski Bible dating to 1250.Nicolle (1988), p. 27 No doubt some knights preferred the better vision and hearing afforded by this more open helmet. Use The nasal helmet would usually have been worn over a mail coif, which protected the lower parts of the head, throat and neck. The coif could be a separate item of armour or be formed as an extension of the mailcoat itself. The existence of rivets and holes around the lower edge of these helmets indicate that they were lined in some manner, though no linings as such have survived. Practical considerations suggest that linings must have been adjustable to ensure a secure fit.Gravett, pp. 9-11 The nasals of these helmets were often so large that the wearer was unrecognisable to an observer. The celebrated incident at the Battle of Hastings, illustrated on the Bayeux tapestry, where William the Conqueror had to lift his helmet to show his troops that he was still alive is an indication of the anonymity nasal helmets produced.Nicolle (1987), p. 56 ReferencesBibliography *D'Amato, Raffaele (2010) The Varangian Guard 988-1453, Osprey, London. *Gravett, Christopher (1993) Norman Knight 950-1204 AD, Osprey, London. *Nicolle, David, (1988) The Crusades, Osprey, London. *Nicolle, David, (1987) The Normans, Osprey, London.

Until mid-2009, Stuart Crystal still had their main retail unit on the site, and for many years previously had a factory unit on the opposite side of the road. The firm became part of the Waterford Wedgwood group which was world- renowned, however went into administration in January 2009 meaning the store unfortunately closed. A site, on which the cone stands, was sold by John and Ann Southwell and Rebecca Stokes was sold to Richard Bradley, a wealthy glass- manufacturer, on 21 June 1788. It is believed that Bradley began construction on the site soon after purchase, meaning that the cone would date to around 1790. The cone was built by Bradley in partnership with his brother-in-law, George Ensell, for the manufacture of window glass. Ensell installed a moving lehr in the cone, which remains today and is the only surviving one in the world. The cone received Grade II* listed building status on 23 September 1966.  Representation in the media  The Red House Cone was featured in an episode of BBC Two's Great British Railway Journeys, in the episode Sarah Cordingley taught Michael Portillo how to make a lampwork bead.

He is also accredited with collecting and compiling other early medieval thinkers' commentaries on these works.\\"Un commento del commento\\", according to C. Marchese, \\"Gli scoliasti di Persico\\" Rivita di Filologia39-40 (1911-12), noted by J. P. Elder, \\"A Mediaeval Cornutus on Persius\\" Speculum 22.2 (April 1947, pp. 240-248), p 240, note; 243f. Biography Remigius, likely born in Burgundy,Cora E. Lutz, ed. Remigii Autissiodorensis commentum in Martianum Capellam, (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1962), p. 1. was a disciple of Lupus of Ferri√®res and Heiric of Auxerre (d. 876),Margaret T. Gibson, ‚ÄúBoethius in the Carolingian Schools,‚Äù Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, Fifth Series, Vol. 32, (1982), p. 48. who was himself a disciple of Johannes Scotus Eriugena. He also borrowed heavily in his commentaries from the Irish teacher Dunchad of Reims, Sedulius Scottus, and Martinus Hiberniensis. \\"Usually, in accordance with Gresham's law of scholarship, Remigius' commentaries ultimately drove from the field those from which he had so generously borrowed,\\" J. P. Elder has remarked.J. P. Elder, \\"A Mediaeval Cornutus on Persius\\" Speculum 22.2 (April 1947, pp. 240-248), pp 243f. Putting the same phenomenon under a more positive light John Marenbon assertsJohn Marenbon, Early Medieval Philosophy (480-1150): An Introduction, (London: Routledge with Kegan Paul, 1983), p. 86. that Remigius's extensive 9th century collection of commentary on classical texts (both his own and those of the authors upon which he drew), preserved for later academics not only the works of other early medieval thinkers, but also certain elements of the ancient Greek and Latin languages and philosophies.M. Esposito, ‚ÄúA Ninth- Century Commentary on Donatus,‚Äù The Classical Quarterly, Vol. 11, No. 2 (April 1917), p. 97. Later documentation shows that Remigius's collections were used across Europe in the later Medieval period, especially in the 12th century.Lutz, 1. He taught at the monastery of Abbey of Saint-Germain en Auxerre, becoming the school master after Heiric's death in 876. In 883 he was called to teach at the Cathedral School in Reims by Archbishop Fulk, and made its headmaster in 893. Upon Fulk's death in 900, Remigius left to teach in Paris, where he remained until his own death. By this time he had earned the reputation of \\"egregius doctor\\" and \\"in divinis et humanis scripturis eruditissimus\\".Lutz 1 As a teacher, Remigius interested himself in the problem of universals, and seems to have attempted a compromise between the extreme Realism of Eriugena and the Anti-Realism of his teacher Heiric. In general, he sought to interpret both classical texts and Christian Scripture in a way that could be taught to his students, exploring the ways in which ancient philosophy could be applied to the Christianized world in which they lived.Marenbon, Early Medieval, 78. Although the texts he examined were numerous and varied, his main commentaries were on the works of the late Roman philosophers Boethius and Martianus Capella, in which he found flexible allegories that he felt could co-exist with Christian theology.He also investigated the problem of the origin of the universe and in his commentary on Martianus Capella gave a Christian interpretation to the passages in which Martianus Capella speaks of the invisible world of Platonic ideas. From the Catholic Encyclopedia, 1913. Writings During his long academic career, Remigius wrote a number of glossaries and marginal commentaries on a wide variety of texts, both of classical and Christian origin. His glosses, which borrowed freely from earlier scholars, are of very great interest to the student of medieval Latin philology. His commentary on the Bible includes work on the Book of Genesis, and the Book of Psalms (his Ennarationes in Psalmos). He also wrote on the grammar of Priscian, Donatus, Phocas, and Eutyches. His favoured classical texts include works by Terence, Juvenal, and Caelius Sedulius, the Disticha Catonis, and ' Ars de nomine,M. Esposito, \\"A Ninth- Century Commentary on Phocas\\" The Classical Quarterly 13.3/4 (July 1919), pp. 166-169. as well as the later commentary of Bede. However, he is best remembered for his contribution to, and collection of, commentaries on the Opuscula Sacra and De Consolatione Philosophiae of Boethius, and the De Nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii et de septem Artibus liberalibus libri novem, or On the Wedding Day of Philology and Mercury and of the Seven Liberal Arts, in Nine Books, of Martianus Capella. He is also thought to have written a commentary on some of the works of Prudentius, but the attribution is not secure.Burnham 1910 Remigius wrote his commentaries mostly for the benefit of his pupils, explaining the meaning and significance of texts in a dispassionate, concise way, placing emphasis on grammatical structures and linguistic peculiarities.Lutz, 18, 24. Like most scholars of the Carolingian period, he had great respect for philosophy, particularly that of Plato and the Neo-Platonists that followed. He was an avid teacher of the Seven Liberal Arts, with emphasis on music and dialectic,Lutz, 6. indicating that he, like so many Carolingians, embraced classical virtues. However, he was also a devout Christian, and thus prone to using philosophical texts to clarify and make sense of certain aspect of Christian theology.John Marenbon, From the Circle of Alcuin to the School of Auxerre: Logic, Theology, and Philosophy in the Early Middle Ages, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981), p. 4. Thus his commentaries examine the allegories and symbols in the texts in a way that reflects the older philosophies from which they are derived, but in a way that could be applied to the rituals and theology of the Church.Donnalee Dox, ‚ÄúThe Eyes of the Body and the Veil of Faith,‚Äù Theatre Journal, Vol. 56, No. 1, (March 2004), p. 16. His synthesis of Classical and Christian thought was in no way unprecedented, but in compiling the commentaries of other thinkers he perpetuated that early medieval inclination.Gibson, 55. Influence on music During Remigius‚Äôs lifetime, music in the domain of the Church was monophonic, which would not change until the 12th and 13th centuries.Margot E. Fassler, ‚ÄúAccent, Meter, and Rhythm in Medieval Treatises ‚ÄòDe rithmis,‚Äô‚Äù The Journal of Musicology, Vol. 5, No. 2, (Spring 1987), p. 164. However, the groundwork for polyphony was laid in his lifetime, with the examination and interpretation of ancient philosophical works. Texts by figures from Plato to Martianus Capella explored the philosophical relationships between mathematics and sound, and later, verse. Early medieval thinkers interpreted these texts in different ways, the grammarians among them (including Remigius of Auxerre), discovering innovative connections between the structures of music and verse.Fassler, 174. Through the grammatical exegesis of philosophical texts on the mathematics of music, the foundation was laid for polyphonic music, which came to fruition at Notre Dame de Paris some three centuries later. During the Carolingian period, the Roman Church had difficulty instituting a universal structure of the Mass because the ritual in France included a strong oral and musical tradition not present in that of the Roman Church. Music was then institutionalized by Rome, necessitating the grammarians‚Äô interpretation of ancient philosophical discourses on music.Craig Wright, Music and Ceremony at Notre Dame of Paris: 500-1550, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989), pp. 60-65. Historical context Remigius wrote and taught in the fading light of what has been referred to as the Carolingian Renaissance,‚ÄùG. W. Trompf, ‚ÄúThe Concept of the Carolingian Renaissance,‚Äù Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. 34, No. 1 (Jan-March 1973), pp. 3-26. which is said to have occurred during the reign of Charlemagne (800-814)Charles Van Doren, A History of Knowledge: The Pivotal Events, People, and Achievements of World History, (New York: Ballantine Books, 1991), p. 105. also known as Charles I. At this time, Charlemagne‚Äôs guidance sparked a new interest in the works and ideas of ancient thinkers, especially in regard to the structure and application of Neo-Platonic philosophy, and Roman education and law (with emphasis on studying the seven liberal arts). Although Remigius of Auxerre was not directly involved in this cultural revival, he certainly benefitted from its influence. His academic position of grammarian hearkens back to the ancient Roman education model, in which Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric stood as the three pillars of learning (the Trivium, on which theoretical knowledge is built). More importantly, Remigius‚Äô exposure to ancient Greek and Latin, brought to the West through contact with the Byzantine Empire, gave him the opportunity to understand and comment upon philosophical texts. Finally, the prevailing sentiment of this ‚ÄúCarolingian Renaissance‚Äù is clearly present in Remigius‚Äô works, namely, that Platonism and Christianity could co-exist; the former explained the universe, but with the necessary tools of the latter.Gibson, 56. Authorship controversy Initial studies of Remigius‚Äô commentaries concluded that he had drawn extensively from the works of John Scotus Eriugena, who had introduced the French Court and schools to Neo- Platonism a generation before.Marenbon, Alcuin 10. Remigius was accused by E. K. Rand of applying ‚Äúscissors and paste‚ÄùE. K. Rand, ‚ÄúHow Much of the Annotationes in Marcianum is the Work of John the Scot?,‚Äù Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association, Vol. 71, (1940), p. 516. to Eriugena‚Äôs work, based on the fact that while Eriugena was a philosopher, Remigius was merely a grammarian.Rand, 516. However, more recent scholarship has shown that not only are such condemnations unfair, neither are they entirely true. Remigius was greatly influenced by Eriugena, and certainly wrote his commentaries with his predecessor‚Äôs ideas firmly in mind. In fact, Remigius is known to have written his commentaries on Martianus Capella‚Äôs work with the help of two books, one by Eriugena, and the other by Martinus Hiberniensis.Lutz, 17. However, Remigius‚Äôs glosses are likely his own, given that examination of the documents indicates they were written at Auxerre.Marenbon, Alcuin, 119. The problem with claiming that Remigius plagiarized is simply that at that time and in that place, most scholars were quite familiar with Eriugena‚Äôs work, and made use of his ideas in their own work with the understanding that his ideas would be easily distinguished from their own.Marenbon, Alcuin, 10. Furthermore, Remigius‚Äôs commentary tends to be more concerned with grammatical matters than those of detailed philosophy, despite his belief that philosophy and religion were joint paths to wisdom.Lutz, 22. It is likely then, that he began with the Eriugena‚Äôs philosophical base, and added his own interpretation of texts.Charles M. Atkinson, ‚ÄúMartianus Capella 935 and its Carolingian Commentaries,‚Äù Journal of Musicology, Vol. 17, No. 4, (1999, 2001), p. 515. This seems even more likely when the difficulty of learning ancient Greek is taken into account. Until the 13th century, no proper book of Greek grammar existed, requiring scholars to apply what they knew of Latin grammar, from reading Donatus, Priscian, and Isidore of Sevilla, to ancient Greek texts. Eriugena learned enough Greek to write commentary on the texts, and it seems plausible that a grammarian like Remigius would build his understanding of the language based on the work of another.Bernice M. Kaczynski, Greek in the Carolingian Age: The St. Gall Manuscripts, (Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Medieval Academy of America, 1988), pp. 43, 49, 56. Taking all of this into account, the controversy over Remigius‚Äôs supposed plagiarism appears, to modern scholars, to be a matter of early medieval scholastic circumstance rather than intent.Gibson, 48.

It was ported to the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, and MSX. A sequel, Dynamite Dan 2, was released the following year. Gameplay The game starts where Dan lands his airship on the top of the evil Dr Blitzen's hideout. The aim of the game is to find eight sticks of dynamite that are placed randomly around the playing area whilst avoiding the perils of the game such as moving monsters, drowning and falling from great heights. Once Dan has all eight sticks of dynamite, the player must make their way to the central safe to blow it open and steal the plans for the evil doctor's Death Ray and escape to his airship. The playing area is one large building split up into multiple screens that wrap around a central elevator. Each screen contains a number of moving monsters that, once the player moves into them, are destroyed but take off a life in return. The only exception to being destroyed once walked into are Dr Blitzen and his assistant Donner (Donner and Blitzen) who are both located on the same screen as the safe. Other perils to Dan's life include running out of energy (caused by not collecting enough food, falling from heights and being hit by laser beams). If Dan should also fall into the underground river that flows beneath the building, the player will receive a game over unless Dan had picked up oxygen, in which case they will be sent back to the start of the game. Once completed, the game provides a secret code to be deciphered and a telephone number to call with the answer. While the number no longer works now, the prize was a ride in the Mirrorsoft blimp. The background music when choosing the game settings and waiting for the game to start is the third movement (Rondo Alla Turca) from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 11 in A major, K. 331.

The Irish Traction Group is a railway preservation society dedicated to preserving diesel locomotives from Irish Railways. It was formed in 1989, with the intention of attempting to preserve at least one example of every type of diesel locomotive to have operated on Irish Rail. History The Irish Traction Group was founded on 4 June 1989 with the intentions to preserve one locomotive of each class of diesel locomotives to have been operated on the Irish railway system. However, they were unable to initially purchase any locomotives from Iarnr√≥d √âireann, who wanted the ITG to have a home for their locomotives before they would consider selling any locomotives to the group. Initially the group was offered the old Portarlington goods shed in December 1990, but were unable to procure the building when IE decided to redevelop the property in March 1991. The group was later offered the old Carrick-on-Suir goods shed, which they had previously considered but decided against it due to its poor condition, removal of its siding, and its distance from Dublin. However, with few other sites available, the group reluctantly agreed to lease the shed in May 1992, with a one-year rent-free period for the shed to be rebuilt as a workshop. Subsequently, IE began the process of selling diesel locomotive C226 to the group; this was the first locomotive to arrive at Carrick-on-Suir on Sunday 6 December 1992 for restoration. Locomotives The ITG owns thirteen locomotives and has previously owned another three locomotives: Locomotive C231 at Carrick-on-Suir prior to restoration. This engine is now operational at the Downpatrick and County Down Railway. Locomotives currently owned by the ITG *001(A) class: A3R & A39R *101(B) class: B103 *121(B) class: 124 *141(B) class: 146 & 152 *181(B) class: 190 *201(C) class: C226 & C231 *601(G) class: G601 *611(G) class: G611, G616 & G617 Locomotives formerly owned by the ITG *NIR 1 Class: 1, 2 and 3. Purchased from NIR as their DH class in 1994, the ITG sold locomotives DH 2 and DH 3 to Beaver Power Ltd in 2005 for work in Sri Lanka, and were subsequently overhauled at Beaver's Merthyr Tydfil workshops, the work including regauging to 5' 6\\" and the fitting of a new diesel engine. In 2010, the ITG sold locomotive DH 1 to Beaver for eventual overhaul (it had been moved with DH 2 and DH 3 in 2005 for use initially as a source of spare parts) and reuse in Sri Lanka; today, DH 2 is operational at a Holcim cement plant in Puttalam province, Sri Lanka, while DH 1, stripped for parts during the rebuilding of the other two, remains stored at Merthyr Tydfil. After several years of operation, DH 3 has also been stripped for parts in Sri Lanka for the upkeep of DH 2. Location The ITG are based in the former Carrick-on-Suir goods shed in Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary,Current campaigns include fundraising to secure an example of the 141(B) Class locomotives. In addition to the Carrick on Suir goods shed, which serves as the group's main restoration base, some of its locos are located at Moyasta Junction on the preserved West Clare Railway, Co. Clare. Locomotives A39R, 146, C231, G611 & G617 are on loan to the Downpatrick & County Down Railway, where they are used to haul regular heritage services. Restoration At present, the ITG have four locomotives at their Carrick-on-Suir site, mainline locomotives C226 and B103, and shunting locomotives G616 and G601. Present work is focused on restoring C226, while B103 and G601 are stored outside under protective steel covers. G616 is currently stored inside the shed in a partially dismantled state, the results of an overhaul started in 1993 but stopped in 1996 due to a lack of volunteers to continue work on the locomotive. Work resumed on this locomotive in early 2012. The engine was started for the first time in some 26 years on Saturday 29 September 2012. G611 Class locomotives G617 and G616 while under restoration at Carrick-on-Suir At present four locomotives, A3R, 124, 152, and 190 are located in Moyasta. C231 was previously stored at Moyasta but has been moved to Downpatrick and County Down Railway; it has been restored to running order. Locomotive 152 was undergoing repairs to its brake valves and cabs when it was sold to the ITG in 2010, and could be brought back to operating condition in the future if required. The other locomotives are all cosmetically in good order, but have either been in storage for long periods of time (124) or were part-way through overhauls that have since been stopped (A3R, C231). The only exception to this is ex-Inchicore works pilot B190, which was trucked directly from Inchicore to Moyasta in November 2009. This locomotive may be nominally operable, though the ITG does not state on its website.

Samata helps tribal groups address problems of land alienation, displacement, and political dis-empowerment. Its mission is to uphold the traditional, constitutional, and human rights of the tribal or adivasi people. Samata focuses primarily on projects in the tribal villages of East Godavari and Vizag districts in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India. This region forms a part of the Eastern Ghats range of mountains. History of Samata Samata achieved NGO status in 1990 and has become one of the primary advocates for tribal and adivasi rights in India. It continually expanded as an organization, taking on new campaigns and issues as the demand for its services grew in the 1990s and into the new millennium. Beginning In 1987 Samata was formed to mobilize groups of tribal and rural youth against exploitation by non-tribal people and address the government's neglect of the villages of Mallapuram, East Godavari District of Andhra Pradesh. Samata applied tribal land protection laws to prevent further abuse of tribal land rights, and they eventually won the implementation of government programs in 49 villages of the area that led to the construction of primary schools, housing, roads, drinking water projects, and electricity grids. Samata was formally registered as a non-government organization in August 1990 under the Indian Societies Registration Act. The day after their official formation, Growth New projects and campaigns followed the early actions in Mallapuram. Samata organized communities in the hills of Poolabanda, Andhra Pradesh and facilitated an ongoing dialogue with government officials covering primary education, development projects, and environmental rights. In Sovva, Orissa Samata helped farmers form the Vegetable Growers‚Äô Cooperative and successfully lobby the Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) for assistance with the transportation of their goods to the market. Samatha judgment During an organizing session on tribal land alienation in January 1993, villagers informed Samata of mining companies acquiring tribal land specifically protected by the Fifth Schedule of the Indian Constitution referring to Scheduled Tribes. Samata mobilized a grassroots movement among villagers in the affected areas and began a legal battle that same year. They filed a case in the local court and again in the High Court against the Government of A.P for leasing tribal lands to private mining companies in the scheduled areas. The High Court dismissed the case after which Samata filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court of India. In July 1997 by a three judge-bench. In its final verdict the Supreme Court of India declared that the term ‚Äòperson‚Äô would include both natural persons as well as juristic persons, including constitutional governments, and that all lands leased by the government or its agencies to private mining companies in the scheduled areas were null and void. It also held that transfer of land to the government or its instrumentalities is an entrustment of public property. Since public corporations function in public interest, such transfers were upheld. Community development focus For the last ten years Samata has focused on community-based development with the following objectives: * Assist tribal people in obtaining basic development and infrastructure facilities for education, health care, drinking water, and housing. * Encourage sustainable development with regard to forests and other natural resources. * Raise consciousness of legal rights among tribal groups. * Organize tribal communities to resist exploitation, assert their rights and control their natural resources. * Promote accountable, grassroots-level institutions for socio-economic independence and self-governance. Problems and issues * Land alienation, exploitation by non-tribal groups, industrialization and displacement, state violation of constitutional and protective legislation * Loss of control over natural resources and rights to decision-making * Economic exploitation and abuse by moneylenders and traders * Deforestation and indiscriminate plunder of natural resources through ill-conceived development policies of the state * Government negligence and lack of infrastructure facilities to the tribal groups whose basic needs are scarcely addressed; * Ill-health and inaccessibility of health services resulting in high mortality; * Inadequate and substandard educational facilities to the tribal children with a very high drop out rate at the school level particularly, of girl children. Activities of Samata during the period Within a larger development context, Samata explored ways of creating holistic approaches to supporting tribal groups struggling for land rights, environmental protection, and a responsive democracy. Samata's action took the form of grassroots campaigns to address the problems and issues facing tribal groups. These campaigns included: * Building up micro credit networks among tribal women. * Encouraging alternative development systems and local democratic institutions to avoid future economic exploitations and deprivations. This led to the creation of business associations and cooperatives, grain banks, property protection groups, health centers, and water-user associations. * Constructing community managed primary education centers to meet the growing demand for education among tribal groups at the village level. * Resolving forest conflicts, attaining recognition of forest settlements, and forming Vana Samrakshana Samithis (forest protection committees under the World Bank-aided forestry project). * Using alternative technology development systems. These systems combine the traditional knowledge of tribal groups with low-cost modern technologies for safe drinking water, environmentally friendly irrigation, electricity, housing and land development projects. * Promoting eco-tourism. * Setting a precedent for conflict resolution between tribals and the state by settling conflicts over the designation of forest village by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, according to the guidelines set in 1980. * Setting up a micro-hydel project as a model in an interior tribal area as alternate source of energy generation in the hills. The Metamorphis ‚Äì 1998 Samata, having played the role of a community-based micro level development organisation with its focus on organising tribal communities shifted its focus to advocacy and to providing support to address the macro issues of the region of north coastal Andhra Pradesh and Southern Orissa. Under the changed perspective, Samata‚Äôs new focus is: *To work towards a people and environment friendly development of the Eastern Ghats region. *To enable community-based organisations working with the marginalised like tribals, farmers, fishermen, etc. build up their capacities with the support and experience of Samata. *To endeavour towards development of alternate development designs for optimal utilisation of natural resources. *To empower poor communities in the Eastern Ghats and help them in their right to decision-making and right to gain control over their natural resources. *To build up a strong Resource Centre for research and documentation on the issues related to north coastal Andhra Pradesh, particularly the tribal areas. Services provided by Samata 1\\\\. Capacity building : Samata, with its vast experience in community organisation, provides capacity building support to small groups and local organisations working for people‚Äôs rights as they find it difficult to obtain information and inputs on their own. Samata assists ten community-based organizations in north coastal Andhra Pradesh in capacity building, education and health, legal aid, linkages, information and documentation, organisation management, financial support, campaign support, marketing and technical expertise. 2\\\\. Mines, Minerals & People: Samata is the National Secretariat for a national network of communities, NGO‚Äôs, resource organisations and several concerned institutions and individuals called Mines, Minerals & PEOPLE (mm&P;). This network addresses the problems of communities and mine-workers affected by mining and also its impacts on the environment. It has about 150 member groups from 16 states in the country. The network support local campaigns through information, linkages, legal, media, technical and policy support on mining issues and highlights them at a national and international level. 3\\\\. Industry Watch: Samata, being an advocacy and support group, monitors the proposed and existing industries and development projects in the state of A.P in order to act as a vigilant civil society. It participates in public hearings, accesses information and disseminates it to the local communities affected. It takes up legal, technical and media advocacy on urban and rural environment issues affected by industries. 4\\\\. Support to Development Activities: Samata implements development programmes in the tribal villages through local community participation to meet their basic requirements of housing, drinking water, education, health services, etc. by linking up with either government departments like Tribal Welfare, Panchayat Raj and Rural Development, Forest Department, etc. or with institutions/organizations concerned with the development of tribals. Samata also encourages communities to build up local sustainable institutions for over-coming exploitation through women‚Äôs thrift societies, forest protection committees, health and education committees and farmers‚Äô associations. 5\\\\. Direct legal services: Legal aid which is most crucial for marginalised communities fighting for their rights is inaccessible to them. Inability to understand the laws or approach the judiciary on their own makes local communities and small organisations working with them vulnerable to exploitation by the state and other forces. Samata provides direct legal services to communities and groups by helping in legal problems like false criminal cases, illegal custodies, getting bails, harassment and human rights violations, land alienation, either through writ petitions or public interest litigations. It takes up legal action and advocacy on issues related to tribal, forest, environment, industrial violations of the Constitution. 6\\\\. Campaign support and legal advocacy: Samata provides assistance to local struggles of tribals, farmers, fishermen, etc. who are fighting in the region for their specific rights of land, water, resources and struggles against displacement by industries. Local groups in Orissa and North Coastal Andhra Pradesh have asked Samata for guidance in organising committees, dissemination of information, planning and implementing campaign strategies, cultural training, help in legal advocacy through public interest litigations and writs, spreading legal awareness and literature among communities, etc. 7\\\\. Information support: Communities affected by private or government projects have a right to information on these projects and their likely impacts. Information should also be accessible to local groups and communities on legal rights, laws and regulations, and other programmes relevant to them. As there is an information-vacuum due to reluctance from government and industries in sharing it, Samata collects information, compiles into brief informative documents and disseminates it. Demystifying legal and technical information, particularly in the context of development projects and spreading this literature in the vernacular is another important activity of Samata. 8\\\\. Media advocacy: Media being the most powerful instrument of publishing information, gathering information, creating public awareness and acting as a pressure on the government to follow transparency and objectivity in its policies and programmes, Samata has been using media advocacy in all its campaign for the protection of peoples rights. Samata would concentrate on developing media advocacy for the issues of the Eastern Ghats and to give strength to local struggles. 9\\\\. Linkages: Small local groups need to come out of their isolated struggles as issues affecting people are based on micro- level policies of the state. Samata, with its experience and access to other people‚Äôs networks helps local struggles by providing linkages to larger movements and fora so as to build up a strong lobby support for the issues in the region. 10\\\\. Technical expertise and alternatives: Samata supports small organisations and communities with technical expertise in seeking alternative sustainable development designs which can be managed by the communities. This includes harnessing locally available natural resources for meeting basic needs of drinking water, electricity, irrigation, housing, etc. appropriate to the area. With the help of the technical experts Samata also takes up impact assessment studies and gives constructive alternatives which are ecologically and socially enduring and press for balanced development policies of the government. 11\\\\. Research and Documentation: Samata takes up research, studies and prepares reports on issues related to tribals/scheduled areas, mining, forestry, environment, human rights, land alienation, rural development programmes, legal issues, etc. Some of the studies undertaken Samata have been on the impact of the Joint Forest Management program in A.P, the impact of Water Users‚Äô Associations, feasibility studies for micro-hydel projects, socio-economic status of mining affected tribals in Anantagiri mandal of A.P, etc. External links *SAMATA ‚Äì A PROFILE *Visit Samata India *The \`Samata judgment' *http://www.dhimsa.net ORGANISATION DETAILS: Registered under Societies Registration Act XXI of 1860.

She established the Virginia Industrial School for Colored Girls, a pioneering rehabilitation center for African-American female delinquents. She was also the founder of the Virginia State Federation of Colored Women's Clubs.  Early life  Barrett was born in Athens, Georgia, on August 9, 1865. Her mother Julia was a former slave. Barrett's father's name is unknown; however, he is thought to have been Caucasian because of Barrett's fair skin. The Skinners, a Caucasian family, hired Barrett's mother as a live-in housekeeper and seamstress. The Skinners pampered Barrett and educated her along with their own children. As well as receiving an education in literature and mathematics, Barrett was exposed to privileged and refined people. Her childhood was atypical of the African-American community of the time. Barrett's mother married a railway worker and lived with him while still working for the Skinners, but Barrett continued to live with the Skinners. Mrs. Skinner wanted to become her legal guardian so that she could send Barrett to a school in the northern U.S.A. where Barrett could live as a white person. Julia vetoed this plan and sent Barrett to the Hampton Institute in Hampton, Virginia, where she would live as a black person in a black environment. Barrett had never lived among African- Americans before attending the Hampton Institute. She also had to do manual labor for the first time at the Institute. Hampton emphasized vocational education, and women were trained in morality and housekeeping in preparation for careers as wives or domestics. Barrett gradually adapted to the system at the Institute and she was especially influenced by a novel about a cultured and advantaged woman similar to herself who devoted her life to social service. While at Hampton, she began to volunteer for community projects that helped people. Barrett trained as an elementary school teacher at the Institute. The Institute taught her lessons \\"in love of race, love of fellow- men, and love of country\\", inculcating her with altruistic and patriotic values, and a sense of duty towards her race.  Career  Barrett graduated from the Hampton Institute in 1885. She worked as a teacher in a rural school in Dawson, Georgia, and then at Lucy Craft Laney's Haines Normal and Industrial Institute in Augusta, Georgia. She taught night school classes in the Hampton Institute from 1886 to 1889. In 1889 she married Harris Barrett, the Institute's cashier and bookkeeper. They had four children.  Locust Street Social Settlement  Soon after she married, Barrett began holding an informal day care and sewing class at her home in Hampton. The class grew rapidly into a club that tried to improve both home and community life. It was formally organized as the Locust Street Social Settlement in October 1890. It was the first settlement organization for African Americans in the USA. In 1902 the Barretts built a separate structure on their property to house the Settlement's numerous activities, which included clubs, recreation, and classes in domestic skills. They received assistance from Hampton Institute students and faculty, who also found several philanthropists ‚Äî who were mostly from the northern U.S.A. ‚Äî to fund the settlement. By 1909 the settlement had clubs for children, women, and senior citizens. Committees supervised these clubs and Barrett concentrated her efforts on large-scale annual events.  Virginia Industrial School for Colored Girls  In 1908 Barrett helped to organize, and was the first president of, the Virginia State Federation of Colored Women's Clubs. The Federation engaged in a wide range of social services. It helped in the provision of environments that were appropriate for children, rather than their being placed in institutions like jails and almshouses. For several years after 1911, the Federation gradually raised money for the establishment of a residential industrial school for the large number of young African-American girls that were being sent to jail. They planned to pay in full for land after five years of fundraising. However in 1914, Barrett read in a newspaper that an eight-year-old girl had been sentenced to six months in jail and she immediately appealed to the judge in Newport News, Virginia, to send the girl to the Weaver Orphan Home in Hampton, where Barrett was living at the time. The judge reluctantly released the child into her care. The Federation quickly raised $5,300 and bought a farm in Hanover County, Virginia, and chartered their center. The center was a rehabilitation center for African-American female juvenile delinquents and was called the Industrial Home for Wayward Girls. It opened in January 1915 with 28 students. After several name changes the center became known as the Virginia Industrial School for Colored Girls. With advice from many prominent social workers and especially from the Russell Sage Foundation, the school developed a program that stressed self-reliance and self-discipline. The school had academic and vocational instruction, visible rewards, \\"big-sister\\" guidance, and close attention to individual needs. In 1915 and 1916 the Virginia Assembly appropriated more funds for the school, and Barrett was named secretary of the board of trustees. Harris Barrett died at about this time. Barrett also turned down a job offer as dean of women at Tuskegee Institute. She became superintendent at the Industrial School. One of her fellow trustees at the school was suffragist and activist Mary-Cooke Branch Munford, who had assisted in its creation. Barrett was deeply involved in every aspect of the Industrial School's program. She personally managed the parole system by which girls who demonstrated sufficient responsibility were placed in carefully selected foster homes. These girls also were given jobs and were supported by follow-up services such as ministerial guidance, a newsletter called The Booster and personal letters. The school operated on an honor system and did not use corporal punishment. A special feature of Barrett's work was that each resident had their own bank account, so that upon discharge each resident had some money to take with them. Barrett excelled in her role at the school. Her childhood had equipped her to deal with the socially important white women who controlled the trustee board and who were able to influence state legislators to appropriate funds for the school. She said: \\"You know we cannot do the best social welfare work unless, as in this school, the two races undertake it together.\\" She was held in such a high regard that she could demand that the future Caucasian employers of her students treated them humanely. While the Industrial School was under Barrett's supervision in the early 1920s, the Russell Sage Foundation rated the it as one of the five best schools of its kind in the USA. At the time its enrolment was about 100. The school became a model of its type, with many successful rehabilitations of young women who were able to find employment and get married after being released. The school was known especially for its cultivation of character and morals. In 1920 the state of Virginia assumed financial responsibility for the school. The state and the Federation shared the supervision of the school until 1942, when it became supervised by the Virginia Department of Welfare and Institutions alone.  Further achievements  In 1929 Barrett received the William E. Harmon Award for Distinguished Achievement among Negroes. In 1930 she took part in the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection. She served as the president of the Virginia State Federation of Colored Women's Clubs for twenty-five years. She chaired the executive board of the National Association of Colored Women for four years. Barrett retired in 1940. She died in Hampton on August 27, 1948. In 1950 Barrett's training school was renamed the Janie Porter Barrett School for Girls. It became racially integrated in 1965. The Virginia Industrial School existed as the Barrett Learning Center until 2005.

It was first published in 1997. Some consider the book to be a series of connected short stories. Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld, a pompous professor of Romance languages, graduates from college, and works hard to write a tome on Portuguese irregular verbs, his claim to academic fame. He talks and talks about it at conferences, usually attending with his two closest colleagues. They encounter the world outside academia with entertaining clumsiness. One review says the main character is \\"a gentle figure who deserves every cartoon anvil that falls on his head\\", in the humorous tradition of fictional characters Mr. Samuel Pickwick (in The Pickwick Papers by Charles Dickens), Bouvard and P√©cuchet (in an unfinished work by Gustave Flaubert), and Mr Pooter of Diary of a Nobody. Another reviewer considers the book to be a series of connected short stories, \\"gentle farces\\", \\"where much is made of nothing -- to great comic effect.\\" That reviewer likens the stories to E. F. Benson's Lucia books. Plot summary German professor Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld feels that he is not accorded the scholarly recognition and veneration he deserves, though he has a good position as a philologist at the Institute of Romance Philology in Regensburg, Germany. Von Igelfeld is extremely tall, like his closest colleagues. They are professors Dr Dr (honoris causa) Florianus Prinzel and Dr Detlev Amadeus Unterholzer. Von Igelfeld is plagued by envy and suspicion of them. The old Irish language was the first interest of von Igelfeld in pursuing his doctoral studies. He moves to Munich to work under an expert in Irish. They go on a field trip to Cork, where they are directed to a man in the west who will not let them in his home; rather he shouts invective at them for an hour until they leave. Von Igelfeld takes it down phonetically, to learn later that all the vocabulary are curse words based in pornography. His landlady sees the page of Irish (translated into German) in his room, and throws him out on the spot. He had already been considering irregular verbs as a topic of greater interest, so he parts from the unsupportive professor in Munich for the study of Romance languages at the University of Wiesbaden. Professor von Igelfeld's interest in, and extensive knowledge of, Romance languages take him abroad for conferences or vacations, where he finds adventure and mishap. He is invited to conferences because of the definitive book he researched and wrote, Portuguese Irregular Verbs, which sold about 200 copies to libraries, leaving several hundred of the original print run of this hefty tome. While at college, he commits his friend Prinzel to a duel, thinking him an athletic type of man, for whom von Igelfeld serves as second. Prinzel is not athletic and rather upset. Duels are fashionable on the campus; von Igelfeld accepted the challenge from a group who are well practised at fencing. Prinzel loses the tip of his nose in the duel. The surgeon who patches him up attaches the lost skin upside down. Von Igelfeld never again refers to his friend as an athlete. In another chapter, the three attend a conference in Z√ºrich, choosing a hotel a little out of town with nicer walks outdoors. Seeing a tennis court, they decide to play a game, getting equipment and an old book on the rules of tennis (written by someone from Cambridge) from the hotel. After ten minutes reading the book, they start the game, with two playing and the third as referee. None of them can serve, which sounded simple in the book. No-one can achieve the required number of sets to win. They give up playing, attributing their failure to have a winner to the Cambridge book, after providing excellent entertainment to others in the hotel with a view of the tennis courts. Von Igelfeld sees a dentist for a troublesome tooth, deciding he will pursue her romantically. He gives Lisbetta, the dentist, a copy of his only book as a gift. She stands on the book to make it easier to care for her patients. He tells his colleague Unterholzer about this excellent new dentist. Unterholzer acts more quickly in courting Lisbetta, and the couple become engaged. Von Igelfeld endures the emotional challenge of attending their wedding. He then takes a vacation to Venice in September with the Prinzels, where he learns that the Venetians are not fond of German tourists, as not enough of them have been visiting. Oddly, he chances upon a Geiger counter in their hotel. He finds no evidence of radiation on himself. When Florianus Prinzel tries the device, it reveals radioactivity on his shirt, where water had splashed on him in a gondola ride with his wife. Von Igelfeld shares the remarks made to him about a problem with the water in Venice, leading to a decline of German tourists in the summer. The courses of their meal were measured, leading them to send the fish course back to the kitchen. The three decide to end their stay in Venice early, so Prinzel can seek medical advice in Germany. Then young Tadeusz ‚Äì a boy with a Polish family staying at the same hotel ‚Äì walks past the measuring device, which reveals that he has a very high level of radiation. Von Igelfeld approaches the mother, speaking in French, telling her that her son has an issue with radioactivity. She replies politely, thanking him for the information, and indicating she has a theory about children and radioactivity, saying no more. Von Igelfeld receives a telegram from Unterholzer about an award from the Portuguese government. He is happy because he thinks the curtly worded telegram meant it was for himself. As they drive through Austria back home, Prinzel points out that Unterholzer probably meant the award was given to him, not to von Igelfeld. After a moment of sadness, he realizes this is not the end, and the three head back to Germany, \\"where they belong\\". Characters *Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld: A tall German scholar of philology, who has specialized in Portuguese irregular verbs. He is about 35 years old in the last five chapters. *Dr Dr (honoris causa) Florianus Prinzel: Colleague of von Igelfeld. Igelfeld thinks of him as the athlete-scholar, though he is not an athlete. Prinzel first met von Igelfeld at college. He marries Ophelia, and works at a language institute near her home town, keeping touch with von Igelfeld regularly. He received an honorary doctorate from a university at Palermo. *Dr Detlev Amadeus Unterholzer: Colleague of von Igelfeld. Igelfeld scorns his family's social status, but never mentions this to Unterholzer. *Professor Vogelsang: Professor who excels in old Irish, at Munich, and where von Igelfeld begins his doctoral studies. Vogelsang has no qualms in taking advantage of the work of his student, and offers no support when the foul language transcribed in Ireland leads to his student being tossed out of his lodgings. *Patrick Fitzcarron O'Leary: Contact for the field trip to Cork, where von Igelfeld finds Ireland to be a very different place from Germany. *Signora Margarita Cossi: Proprietor of an inn in Montalcino rural Tuscany who is an \\"incorrigible xenophobe\\", an unfortunate characteristic in her profession. *Professor J. G. K. L. Singh: Indian professor of philology who invites von Igelfeld to present at a conference in Goa. Prof. Singh is injured in a train accident, and does not reach the conference. *The holy man: Guru whom von Igelfeld meets in Goa. The man tells him of something bad happening to a friend connected to Goa, and that a plot against him is happening at his home. Both events happen: Professor Singh's injuries, and the plot by Unterholzer and Prinzel to have the book Portuguese Irregular Verbs taken off the shelves in the library of his institute, which he stops by leaving the conference in Goa early. *Doctor Lisbetta von Brauthein: Dentist who fixed von Igelfeld's painful tooth, then married Unterholzer, who pursued her while von Igelfeld loved her but did not act. *Polish tourists in Venice: A mother with her son and several daughters stay in the same hotel as Von Igelfeld. He learns the son's name, Tadeusz, by hearing the mother call to him. The boy makes Von Igelfeld nervous, as the boy seems to stare at Von Igelfeld. The mother is attractive and the children are well-behaved. The family speaks French. Title The book's title refers eponymously to von Igelfeld's magnum opus, a tome of nearly 1200 pages, which sells poorly. This is his academic specialty. Short story titles Some find the book to be a series of connected short stories. Following that view point, the titles of the eight are listed. # Eins: The Principles of Tennis # Zwei: Duels, and How to Fight Them # Drei: Early Irish Pornography # Vier: Italian Matters # F√ºnf: Portuguese Irregular Verbs # Sechs: Holy Man # Sieben: Dental Pain # Acht: Death in Venice Reviews Kirkus Reviews enjoys this lovable anithero who is \\"as predictable in his habits and as impervious to the outside world as Kant\\", following a great tradition: > ‚ÄúAll I want is love,‚Äù dolefully reflects the author of that standard but > slow-selling reference work, Portuguese Irregular Verbs, ‚Äúand a tiny bit of > recognition from the Portuguese.‚Äù What he gets instead is a series of eight > little adventures that add up to a life of quiet desperation.

(Illus. throughout with b&w; block > prints) Dawn Drzal reviews the first three books, after they were issued in the US. She likens the stories to E. F. Benson's Lucia books. Drzal says the first book is a collection of short stories, not a short novel as labelled in the US. The stories are \\"gentle farces\\", creating a place \\"where much is made of nothing -- to great comic effect. The humor is heightened, of course, by the lofty formality with which the professors address one another, even as they're thinking the basest thoughts.\\" The humor plays \\"many variations on von Igelfeld's unshakable belief in German superiority.\\" Drzal considers the first three stories as unimportant, and sees a sharp improvement in the remaining five stories. She notes \\"McCall Smith's astounding level of productivity\\" in writing books, and will not be surprised if he exceeds P. G. Wodehouse's total, exceeding 100 books. (Most of the experts just say ‚Äúabout 100‚Äù\\" as to the number of novels that Wodehouse wrote.) At the release of the audio book, Library Journal Review referred to the book as \\"these sequential collections of stories\\". The \\"comic vignettes based on the classic form of minutiae inflated to monstrous proportions,\\" but the reviewer expects these stories are not as charming as those in the series set in Gaborone. Sarah Weinman reviewed this book when the first three books were published in the UK in one volume, The 2 1/2 Pillars of Wisdom. She remarks that \\"The stories that make up the von Igelfeld trilogy are rooted in McCall Smith's own career in academia as a professor of medical law.\\" She credits the success of the novel to the author's \\"charming, gentle voice\\" which is \\"always clear and present, brimming with intelligence and humour and rooted in curiosity, one that elevates even the most innocuous interactions to both high comedy and art.\\" This reviewer noted the illustrations favorably, \\"perfectly match the text at any given point.\\" Development of the novel Per Dawn Drzal, \\"the book began as a private joke with a very distinguished real-life German professor, McCall Smith's friend Reinhard Dr. Dr. Dr. Zimmermann. (His official title: German academics line up all their doctorates.)\\" Zimmerman bought half of the print run of 500 books, and slowly it built a cult following (\\"a kind of samizdat\\"), which increased with each successive novel of the three. Publication history The book was published in the UK in 1996 with a run of 500 copies. Half were purchased by his friend, Reinhard Dr. Dr. Dr. Zimmermann, a German academic. The first three books were published in the US at once in 2004, following the wildly popular success of McCall Smith's other series, The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, which \\"shower[ed] the globe with four million copies in English alone.\\" Alexander McCall Smith followed Portuguese Irregular Verbs with two sequels: The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs and At the Villa of Reduced Circumstances, both published in 2003. In 2004, Abacus (an imprint of Little, Brown and Company) republished all three novels in a paperback omnibus titled The 2¬Ω Pillars of Wisdom.

(German title: Kleiner Mann ‚Äì was nun?) is a novel by Hans Fallada, which although first published in June 1932Kleiner Mann ‚Äì was nun? Roman. Rowohlt, Berlin 1932, is set between 1930 and November 1932. The book was an immediate success in Germany, given its intense descriptions of the harsh life in the years after the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the first years of the Great Depression. The book was also the breakthrough for Fallada as a writer of fiction. After Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933, Fallada had to make a few changes to the novel that removed anything that showed the Nazis in a bad light: a Sturmabteilung (SA) thug had to be turned into a soccer thug, for example, and the book stayed in print through 1941 after which paper shortages curtailed the printing of novels. In 2016 a complete editionKleiner Mann ‚Äì was nun? Roman. Erstmals in der Originalfassung. Aufbau, Berlin 2016, was published in Germany that added about 100 pages to the original 400 pages in the 1932 edition. The cuts had been made with Fallada's consent by his publisher Ernst Rowohlt. German reviewers agreed that the tone and the structure of the novel had not suffered from the cuts, but that the restored sections added 'colour and atmosphere,' such as a dream like Robinson Crusoe island fantasy taking the main character away from his drab everyday life, a visit to the cinema to see a Charles Chaplin movie, and an evening at the Tanzpalast (Dance Palace). Kleiner Mann is today considered a modern classic in Germany, with its depiction of the last days of the Weimar Republic, and was one of the first novels to be republished after the war in 1947. Its success in 1932 rescued Ernst Rowohlt's publishing house, and he made it No.1 in his numbered series of paperback novels. The complete 1932 edition of the novel is available in German at Projekt Gutenberg-DE.Kleiner Mann ‚Äì was nun? Complete novel in German at Projekt Gutenberg-DE. Much of Fallada's work is available in German at Projekt Gutenberg-DE Hans Fallada. The 1933 German film Kleiner Mann - was nun? was made under Nazi censorship. Fallada had already remarked in 1932 that the script had little to do with his novel, and that the script writers \\"would take a different approach.\\"Illustrierter Film-Kurier, 29. September 1932, Vereinigte Verlagsgesellschaften Franke & Co., Berlin 1932. In 1934 the film Little Man, What Now? was released in the United States. It clearly reflects the situation of the young German mind during that period, especially the effects of war and the economic shut down and is a little closer to the novel than the German film. Plot synopsis The bookkeeper Johannes Pinneberg and his girlfriend, the sales girl Emma \\"L√§mmchen\\" M√∂rschel, marry when they find out that she is two months pregnant. Hardly any time passes until Pinneberg is fired and must find a new job in the middle of the economic crisis. Pinneberg's despicable mother Mia, a nightclub hostess from Berlin, comes to the rescue by finding her son a job as a salesman in the Berlin department store Mandels. However, Pinneberg is under heavy pressure because the boss, Spannfuss, introduces a monthly quota for all salesmen to achieve, otherwise they are made redundant. This leads to fierce competition between the colleagues. As their son Horst, whom they affectionately call ‚ÄúShrimp,‚Äù is born, money again becomes scarce because their health insurance payouts are delayed. After a year Pinneberg becomes less able to work at Mandels. After many warnings about lateness, he is very behind on his monthly quota. He begs the film actor Franz Schl√ºter, who wanders into the shop, to buy something from him. The actor refuses and complains to the manager about Pinneberg's behavior, and Pinneberg is promptly fired. In November 1932, the small family illegally moves into Pinneberg's former colleague's summer house 40 km east of Berlin. Although Pinneberg has been unemployed for 14 months, his wife forbids him to steal coal. Instead, she darns socks and does dressmaking for local families to earn a bit. One of Pinneberg's journeys to Berlin ends in a fiasco, as Pinneberg, with his poor appearance, is chased away from Friedrichstrasse by the police. The couple realize that good old-fashioned love is all that matters. Fallada gives a detailed description of the living conditions of the white-collar workers of the time. He also shows the roles of trade unions, governmental institutions, and sacking in the labor market, while also highlighting the benefits of Germany's social care system which pays unemployment benefits for a while, takes care of the medical bills when baby Horst is born, and pays Emma so that she doesn't have to work in the weeks before and after giving birth. Businesses are shown to exploit and pit people of the same class against each other, and reveal everyone's worst side.

He was assistant professor and professor at Wesleyan (1895‚Äì1906), and after 1906 a professor at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, where the mathematics building is named after him.Sterling Hall map; Van Vleck Hall is adjacent to Sterling Hall, where the Sterling Hall bombing occurred in August 1970, but Van Vleck Hall suffered merely broken windows. His doctoral students include H. S. Wall. In 1913 he became president of the American Mathematical Society, of whose Transactions he had been first associate editor (1902‚Äì05) and then editor (1905‚Äì10). He was the author of Theory of Divergent Series and Algebraic Continued Fractions (1903), and of several monographs in mathematical journals. His son, John Hasbrouck Van Vleck, was a notable physicist who received the Nobel Prize in 1977. Japanese art collector E. B. Van Vleck is also important art collector, particularly in the medium of Japanese woodblock prints (principally Ukiyo-e), known as Van Vleck Collection. He began collecting around 1909, but became a serious collector in the late 1920s, when he acquired approximately 4,000 prints that had been owned by Frank Lloyd Wright. His collection, one of the largest in the world outside the Library of Congress, features more than 2,000 prints by Utagawa Hiroshige as well as many prints by Hokusai, and fine examples of shin hanga (new prints) made well into the 20th century.

She is the eldest daughter of the late Ira Tucker (of the Dixie Hummingbirds) and Louise Tucker. Her sister is Lynda Laurence, once a member of the Supremes, and her brother is Ira Tucker Jr. Early career Born and raised in Philadelphia, Sundray was a member of an earlier version of Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles, the Ordettes; she left the group due to troubles in school before the group changed its name to the Blue Belles (later Bluebelles). Sundray also performed under the name Cindy Scott. Her most notable single was the Northern Soul classic \\"I Love You Baby\\", backed with \\"In Your Spare Time\\". In 1967, Sundray joined the Three Degrees and performed alongside Fayette Pinkney and Sheila Ferguson for touring purposes only. Stevie Wonder Sundray joined her sister Lynda and third member Terri Hendricks on the road as back-up vocalists for Stevie Wonder on a tour to promote Signed, Sealed & Delivered in early 1970. The group were known as the Third Generation, which became Stevie's resident backing group, Wonderlove. Sundray's stay with this group was relatively short-lived as she joined Ernie Terrell and the Heavyweights as lead vocalist, replacing departing member Jean Terrell. In 1976 Sundray performed background vocals for Stevie Wonder's critically acclaimed album Songs in the Key of Life, providing backing vocals for several tracks, most notably on \\"Ordinary Pain\\". The Supremes Throughout her long career, Sundray has held a connection to the Supremes in one way or another. Starting off in 1962, Sundray left the group the Ordettes and group member Patti LaBelle to be replaced by Cindy Birdsong. In turn Cindy would leave the group in 1967 to replace departing Supreme Florence Ballard. In 1970 Sundray was recruited to replace Jean Terrell from Ernie Terrell and the Heavyweights as lead vocalist of the group. Jean in her turn was replacing Diana Ross in the Supremes. In 1972 Supremes member Cindy Birdsong announced she would be retiring from the group to concentrate on family life and her initial thought as an ideal replacement was Sundray. Sundray auditioned for the part, but due to contractual obligations was unable to replace Cindy in the Supremes; however her sister Lynda Laurence joined the Supremes with Jean Terrell and Mary Wilson. Former Ladies of the Supremes In early 1993 Sundray was approached by Scherrie Payne and Lynda Laurence and was asked to replace departing member Jean Terrell in the Former Ladies of the Supremes. Sundray made her stage debut with Lynda and Scherrie on a tour of Japan in March 1993 and quickly established herself as a fan favorite. The following year Sundray made her recording debut with the group when she appeared on the autumn release of the album Supreme Voices. Sundray had one solo lead track, \\"I'm A Fool For Love\\", as well as sharing lead vocals with Scherrie and Lynda on a remake of George Benson's song \\"Give Me The Night\\". A re-recording of the Supremes classic 1970 hit \\"Up The Ladder To The Roof\\" is another highlight on this album, as is the studio version of the ladies' show-stopper, \\"How Do You Keep The Music Playing\\". The following year another album was released entitled Supremely Yours with liner notes by the noted Motown historian Sharon Davis, this album equalled Supreme Voices. Sundray featured on several shared- lead tracks with Scherrie and Lynda, notably \\"Feel Like Making Love\\", \\"Stop To Love\\" and another '70s Supremes re-make, \\"Touch\\". Solo leads on the album include \\"Stop! I Don't Need No Sympathy\\", \\"Never Can Say Goodbye\\" and \\"Just Like That\\". Whilst with the group Sundray re-recorded her own hit \\"I Love You Baby\\" which was expected for release on the follow-up album to Supremely Yours. The album project was postponed and ultimately cancelled. In its place the enormous task of re-recording the Supremes songbook was undertaken by the group. It has been reported, but not confirmed, that other tracks were recorded by Sundray while with the group that still await the light of day. One of the unreleased tracks, composed by Sundray and entitled \\"Nervous\\", was recorded in April 1996. In the summer of 1996, Sundray left the FLOS to concentrate on other projects, and was subsequently replaced by Freddi Poole. Revival In 1999, it was announced that independent UK label Driving Wheel Records had signed Sundray Tucker. By this time Sundray had reverted to her earlier stage name of Cindy Scott. Owner/producer David Powner oversaw the creation of the album. Providing backing vocals was longtime friend and former Persianette Vera Carey. The resulting album The Loving Country was released in the autumn of 1999 and received a 4.5 star (out of 5) rating at Allmusic. In summer 2000, Sundray/Cindy made her UK solo stage debut at the Patshull Golf & Country Club outside Wolverhampton in England. The show was recorded and subsequently released as a souvenir album to limited release in 2002 under the title Live and Red Hot. Cindy's follow-up studio album, The Loving Country 2, was released in 2004. In 2016, Cindy Scott recorded two brand new songs for Driving Wheel Records, \\"Life Iza B\\" & \\"Fine Time\\".

The Cotzumalhuapa archaeological zone is near the town of Santa Luc√≠a Cotzumalguapa (the city is spelled with a g ‚Äî Cotzumalguapa ‚Äî and the culture tends to be spelled with an h ‚Äî Cotzumalhuapa). The Cotzumalhuapa archaeological zone is a pre-Columbian Maya archaeological zone dating mainly to the Late Classic period in Mesoamerican chronology, although it was occupied since the Middle Preclassic period and there is evidence of a major development during the Late Preclassic period. The famous Stela 1 from El Ba√∫l has one of the earliest inscriptions in Mesoamerica, with the earliest legible hieroglyphic Long Count date in Guatemala equaling 37 CE. Introduction Cotzumalhuapa is located on the Pacific piedmont of southern Guatemala, in the Escuintla Department, on the outskirts of modern Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa. During the Late Classic period, Cotzumalhuapa was a major city that extended more than . It encompassing three major compounds, known as El Ba√∫l, Bilbao, and El Castillo, with extensive settlements between and around them. The Cotzumalhuapa Zone contains not only the 3 main sites, but the minor site of Gol√≥n as well as connecting stone-paved causeways and bridges. Its main structures were made of earthen filling and carefully chosen stones. There have been found more than 200 structures and 187 sculptured monuments here dating from Pre-Classic (see Stela 1, to right, dated at 37 CE) to the Late Classic (600-1000 CE). In the Late Classic phase, El Ba√∫l was one of the most important Pacific coast sites. Artefacts A corpus of more than 200 monumental sculptures are known from the city and from neighboring sites that include Palo Verde, Aguna, Palo Gordo, and others. Examples of the Cotzumalhuapa sculptural style are found across the Pacific Coast and highlands of Guatemala, and into El Salvador, where Cara Sucia marks the southeastern limit of the Cotzumalhuapa zone.Guthrie Hingston (1989, 2003), p. 135. Culture The inhabitants of Cotzumalhuapa developed an original artistic style and a writing system of their own, which remains undeciphered. Hieroglyphic signs usually are inscribed in circular cartouches, but they may also acquire complex animated forms. The number of known inscriptions is quite small. Cotzumalhuapa people produced a large corpus of monumental sculptures. These include rock carvings, stelae, altars, colossal heads, and sculptures, both free-standing and as a component of the architecture (e. g. carved stairs, pillars, and pavement stones). There are also numerous portable sculptures. Characteristic of the Cotzumalguapa style is an extraordinary degree of realism in the representation of human figures, which in many cases may be considered as individual portraits, possibly representing kings and nobles. In many cases, these individuals participate in complex scenes, where they interact with other human characters or with supernatural beings. Sacrificial scenes are frequent. Distinctive elements of the Cotzumalguapa style include speech scrolls shaped as vines with a variety of flowers and fruits. Influence Cotzumalhuapa was most likely the seat of a powerful state, which exerted political control over a vast region of the Pacific coast. The diffusion of the sculptural style provides a measure of the geographic extension of Cotzumalguapa influence. The style is found along a 200 kilometer stretch of the Pacific coast, from the modern border between Guatemala and El Salvador to the Suchitep√©quez Department. It also had strong presence in some regions of the Central and Eastern Highlands, particularly in the region of Antigua Guatemala. Some elements of the style are perceptible in sculptures from various sites located in Chimaltenango in the Central Highlands, the western Pacific Coastal area, and the Motagua River valley.

Gatch was born in a rural community near Baltimore. His family had no sympathy with his artistic aspirations, which was a source of pain throughout his life, but he was determined to make a name for himself as an artist.John Loughery, \\"The Lyrical Abstractions of Lee Gatch,\\" pp. 78-80. He graduated from the Maryland Institute College of Art in the early 1920s; there a visiting instructor, New York painter John Sloan, made a strong impression on him and confirmed him in his sense of his vocation.John Loughery, John Sloan: Painter and Rebel (New York: Henry Holt, 1995), p. 272. In 1924, in search of more advanced instruction and more exposure to modern art, he went to Europe and studied with the painter Andre Lhote. While in Paris, he was a particularly avid student of the French modernism of Andr√© Derain, √âdouard Vuillard, and Pierre Bonnard, inspirations which are evident in his own refined color sense.Loughery, p. 79. According to the online biography of Gatch at the Phillips Collection website, Gatch exhibited in the Venice Biennials of 1950 and 1956, and he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1957. Although he is best known for his nature-inspired abstract works, he also worked for a time as a muralist for the Federal Art Project, painting murals., Tobacco Industry in 1940 in Mullins, South Carolina and Squaw's Rest, 1942. in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania.Park, Marlene and Gerald E.

They had one child, Merriman Gatch. According to MarylandArtSource.com, \\"His abstract painting style combined elements of Post-Impressionism, Cubism, and Symbolism in mystical evocations of nature.\\" The Phillips Collection article asserts that \\"Gatch strove throughout his career to maintain an individual style based on the American representational tradition while reaching beyond appearances to find meaning through design and color.\\" Despite the admiration of discerning men like collector Duncan Phillips and the art dealer J.B. Neumann, Gatch had a difficult time creating a stable career and attracting the critical and public attention he felt he deserved. His marriage to Driggs, who gave up her own career until Gatch's death in 1968, was source of essential support to him during his darker periods, and the couple lived a financially straitened life in rural Lambertville, New Jersey .Elsie Driggs Wikipedia entry. In the heyday of Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art, and the other radical postwar movements, he was a little-known presence in American art.

Antecedents Under the Merovingian Kings of the Frankish kingdoms there was established at the court a 'palatial' school -- scola palatina, the chroniclers of the eighth century styled it‚Äîfor the training of the young Frankish nobles in the art of war and in the ceremonies of the court. With the accession of the future emperor Charlemagne (768) a scheme of educational reform was inaugurated, first in the palace school itself, and later in the various schools established or reformed by imperial decrees throughout the vast empire over which Charlemagne reigned. The reform of the palace school, i.e. the change from a school of military tactics and court manners to a place of learning, was begun in 780, as soon as the victories over the Lombards, Saxons and Saracens (in Iberia) afforded. The start at court It was not, however, until the arrival of Alcuin at his court seat Aachen in 782 that the work of educational reform began to have any measure of success. Alcuin was not made head of the emperor's school in the palace, but was admitted to the council of the emperor in all educational matters and became Charlemagne's \\"prime minister of education\\". Charlemagne also built new monasteries and encouraged the learning of Latin. He represented the learning of the school of York, which united in its traditions the current of educational reform inaugurated in the South of England by Theodore of Tarsus and that other current which, starting from the schools of Ireland, spread over the entire northern part of England. He was not an original thinker, but he exerted a profound cultural influence on the whole Frankish Kingdom by reason of the high esteem in which Charlemagne and his courtiers held him. He taught grammar, rhetoric, dialectic and the elements of geometry, astronomy and music (see Seven Liberal Arts), and his success as a teacher of these branches seems to have been generally acknowledged by all the courtiers as well as by his royal patron. We know from Einhard's biography of Charlemagne that the emperor, the princes and princesses and all the royal household formed a kind of higher school at the palace in order to learn from Alcuin what would nowadays be considered the merest rudiments. Further ambition Charlemagne was not content with securing for his palace school the services of the ablest teacher of that age. Acting under Alcuin's advice he proceeded by a series of enactments dating from 787 (two years after the final triumph over the Saxons) to 789, to inaugurate a reform in the educational conditions throughout the empire. In 787 he issued the famous capitulary which has been styled the \\"Charter of Modern Thought\\", addressing himself to the bishops and abbots of the empire, informing them that he \\"has judged it to be of utility that, in their bishoprics and monasteries committed by Christ's favour to his charge, care should be taken that there should not only be a regular manner of life, but also the study of letters, each to teach and learn them according to his ability and the Divine assistance\\". He has observed, he says, in the letters which, during past years, he has received from different monasteries, that though the thoughts contained therein are most just, the language in which those thoughts are expressed is often uncouth, and the fear arises in his mind lest if the skill to write correctly were thus lacking, the power of rightly comprehending the Scriptures might be less than it should be. \\"Let there, therefore, be chosen [for the work of teaching] men who are both willing and able to learn and let them apply themselves to this work with a zeal equal to the earnestness with which we recommend it to them\\". Copies of this letter are to be sent to all suffragan bishops and to all (dependent) monasteries. In the major Council of Aachen of 789 he issued more explicit instructions regarding the education of the clergy. From the wording of the capitulary of 787, it is clear that Charlemagne intended to introduce the reform of education into all the cathedral schools and monastic schools of the empire. Again in the capitulary of 789 we read: \\"Let every monastery and every abbey have its school, in which boys may be taught the Psalms, the system of musical notation, singing, arithmetic and grammar\\". There can be no doubt that by boys are meant not only the candidates for the monastery and the wards (generally the children of nobles) committed to the care of the monks, but also the children of the village or country district around the monastery, for whom there was usually an external school attached to groups of monastic buildings. This is made evident by an enactment of Theodulf, Bishop of Orl√©ans, who succeeded Alcuin (retired to the monastery of Tours) in 796 at the Court as adviser of the emperor in educational matters. The document dated 797, ten years after Charlemagne's first capitulary was issued, enacts explicitly \\"that the priests establish schools in every town and village, and if any of the faithful wish to entrust their children to them to learn letters, that they refuse not to accept them but with all charity teach them ... and let them exact no price from the children for their teaching nor receive anything from them save what parents may offer voluntarily and from affection\\" (P.L., CV., col. 196). To Alcuin himself tradition has assigned the lines set up in the streets of Strasbourg in which the attractions of a school are compared with those of a nearby tavern: \\"Choose, O traveller; if thou wilt drink thou must also pay money, but if thou wilt learn thou wilt have what thou seekest for nothing.\\" In these free schools the teacher was, apparently, the priest of the town or village, and, as far as we can judge, the curriculum composed what may be called the rudiments of general education, with an elementary course in Christian Doctrine. Actual spreading The \\"new learning\\" inaugurated at the palace school, which seems to have had no fixed location, but to have followed the court from place to place, was not slow in spreading throughout the empire. Its first noticeable success was at Fulda, which since the days of its first abbot, Sturm, had maintained a tradition of fidelity to the ideals of St. Benedict. The man to whose enlightened zeal the success of the schools of Fulda was largely due was Rhabanus Maurus. While still a young monk at Fulda, Rhabanus, learning of the fame of Alcuin, begged to be sent to Tours, where he listened a year to the aged teacher and imbibed some of his zeal for the study of the classics and the cultivation of the sciences. On his return to Fulda he was placed at the head of the monastic school and, amid many difficulties, continued to labour for the intellectual reform of his own monastery and his own land. What these difficulties were we may judge from the treatment which he received at the hands of his abbot, Ratgar, who, believing that the monks were better employed in building churches than in studying their lessons, closed the school of the monastery and confiscated the teacher's note-books. Rhabanus' unpleasant experiences on this occasion are reflected by his saying \\"He alone escapes calumny who writes nothing at all.\\" He was not, however, discouraged, and the day finally came when, as Abbot of Fulda, he could give full authority to his measures for educational reform. Later, as Archbishop of Mainz, Rhabanus continued to sustain the programme of the Carolingian revival, and by his efforts for the improvement of popular preaching, and by his advocacy of the use of the vernacular tongue, earned the title of the \\"Teacher of Germany\\". His influence may be traced beyond the territory which belonged to the monastery of Fulda; to him and to his educational activity is due the revival of learning in the schools of Solenhofen, Celle, Hirsfeld, Petersburg and Hirschau. Even Reichenau and St. Gall owe much to him, and it is perhaps no exaggeration to say that he, like Otfried of \\"Der Krist\\", first made the Old High German an instrument of literary expression. In France, the Carolingian revival was, as has been said, taken up by Theodulf, Bishop of Orl√©ans, who by his own diocesan enactments and by the advice which he gave the emperor proved his right to the title of Alcuin's successor. Alcuin himself, after his retirement to the monastery of Tours, devoted his attention almost exclusively to monastic education and the transcription of liturgical and theological works. Whatever love he had for the classics changed towards the end of his life into a deep-seated suspicion of all \\"pagan literature.\\" In this he offers a striking contrast, with Lupus Servatus, a disciple of Rhabanus, who, as Abbot of Ferri√®res, early in the ninth century encouraged and promoted the study of the pagan classics with all the ardour of a fifteenth-century Humanist. Through the influence of Alcuin, Theodulf, Lupus and others, the Carolingian revival spread to Reims, Auxerre, Laon and Chartres, where even before the schools of Paris had come into prominence, the foundations of scholastic theology and philosophy were laid. In Southern Germany and Switzerland the Carolingian revival was felt before the close of the eighth century in Rheinau, Reichenau and St. Gall, and early in the following century in Northern Italy, especially in Pavia and Bobbio. Under the successors of Charlemagne there sprang up the schools of Utrecht, Li√®ge and St. Laurent, Liege in the Low Countries which continued the movement. The Irish Teachers With the extension and promotion of the Carolingian revival of education are associated the names of the Irish teachers, Alcuin's rivals who certainly share in the credit of having been the first masters of the schools. According to the St. Gall chronicler who wrote the history of Charles the Great, two Irish monks arrived in France before Alcuin had received Charlemagne's invitation, and having made known somewhat boastfully their desire to teach wisdom, were received by the emperor with honour, and one of them placed at the head of the palace school. The story, however, is not accepted as reliable. We know for certain that after Alcuin left the court of Charlemagne, Clement the Irishman succeeded him as master of the palace school, and that he had pupils sent to him even from the monastery of Fulda. The grammarian Cruindmelus, the poet Dungal of Bobbio and Bishop Donatus of Fiesole were among the many Irish teachers on the Continent who enjoyed the favour of Charlemagne. Indeed, the emperor, according to Einhard, \\"loved the strangers\\" and \\"had the Irish in special esteem\\". His successors likewise invited the Irish teachers to their court. Louis the Pious was the patron of the Irish geographer Dicuil, Lothair II stood in a similar relation to the Irish poet and scribe Sedulius Scottus, founder of the school at Li√®ge, and Charles the Bald equalled his grandfather in his affectionate esteem for the Irish teachers. Under him Elias taught at Laon, Dunchad at Reims, Israel at Auxerre, and the greatest of all the Irish scholars, Johannes Scotus Eriugena, was head of the palace school. Naturally the Irish teachers flocked to the places already known to them by the missionary activity of their fellow- countrymen of former generations We find them at Reichenau, St. Gall and Bobbio, \\"a whole herd of philosophers\\" as a ninth-century writer expresses it. Every monastery or cathedral school at which they appeared soon showed the effect of their influence. To the curriculum already in vogue in the Carolingian Schools the Irish teachers added the study of Greek, and wherever they taught philosophy or theology (dialectic and the interpretation of the Scriptures) they drew largely from the writings of the neo-Platonists and from the works of the Greek Fathers. School resources With regard to the details of schoolwork in the institutions founded or reformed by Charlemagne, the chronicles of the time do not furnish us as much information as one would desire. We know that the course of studies in the town and village schools (per villas et viccos) comprised at least the elements of Christian Doctrine, plainsong, the rudiments of grammar, and perhaps, where the influence of St. Benedict's rule was still felt, some kind of manual training. In the monastic and cathedral schools the curriculum included grammar (corresponding to what we now call language-work in general, as well as the study of poetry), rhetoric, dialectic, geometry, arithmetic, music and astronomy. The text-book in these subjects was, wherever the Irish teaching prevailed, Martianus Capella, \\"De Nuptiis Mercurii et philologiae\\"; elsewhere, as in the schools taught by Alcuin, the teacher compiled treatises on grammar, etc. from the works of Cassiodorus, St. Isidore of Seville and Venerable Bede. In some instances the works of Boethius were used as texts in dialectic. The master, scholasticus or archischolus (earlier capiscola), had at his command, besides his assistants, a proscholus or prefect of discipline, whose duty it was (in the monastic school of Fulda, at least) to teach the children \\"how to walk, how to bow to strangers, how to behave in the presence of superiors\\". The teacher read (legere was synonymous with docere) while the pupils took down his dictation in their wax tablets (parchment was too expensive). Discipline in the Carolingian schools was maintained by the proscholus, and that the medieval scholar dreaded the rod is clear from an episode in the history of the school of St. Gall where, in order to escape a birching, the boys set fire to the monastery. Regulations regarding neatness, the hours to be given to work, and provision for the mid-day siesta etc. show that some attention was paid to the health and comfort of the pupils. The \\"school-room\\" was, until as late as the twelfth century the cloister of the monastery and, in the case of some very popular teachers, the street or a public square. The floor of the schoolroom was strewn with straw on which the pupils sat -boarded floors and benches do not appear to have been in use in schools until the fifteenth century, although seats of a certain kind were provided at Cluny Abbey, in the twelfth century, namely wooden boxes which served both as seat and repository for writing materials. Dawn After the death of Charlemagne and the dismemberment of the empire, the educational reforms introduced by him received a setback. There was a brief period under Charles the Bald, when royal favour was once more bestowed on scholars. But with the advent of the tenth century came other cares and occupations for the royal mind. Nevertheless, the monastic and episcopal schools, and no doubt the village schools too, continued wherever war and pillage did not render their existence impossible. Thus the educational influence of the Carolingian revival of learning was continued in some way down to the dawn of the era of university education in the thirteenth century.

It is situated six miles south of the city, and is one of the so-called \\"Southern Suburbs\\", it is situated alongside Lansdowne. It is an important commercial and residential area, which is currently experiencing significant growth and development. History Until the arrival of Dutch colonists in 1652, the uncultivated veld of the Cape Peninsula was used by the nomadic Khoisan as grazing for their cattle. The Dutch established an outpost on the shore of Table Bay, and in 1657 they established a number of farms south of the outpost. The most southerly of those original farms, named Louwvliet and Questenburg, are today covered by the suburbs of Claremont and Newlands. The area was agricultural for about 150 years. Other estates that were established included Veldhuyzen in 1676, Stellenberg in 1697, Weltevreden (originally part of Stellenberg) in 1730, Sans Souci (originally part of Questenburg) in 1786, and The Vineyard in 1798. They produced grain and grapes, and some farmers made wine. After the colony had been taken over by the British in 1814, the character of the area gradually changed from agricultural to residential. British settlers and officials bought the farms, renamed some of them, and turned them into country residences. Weltevreden was subdivided in 1822, and it was a portion of it that was later to be renamed Claremont. The distinguished British astronomer Sir John Herschel put the area on the map by living at Feldhausen (formerly Veldhuyzen) from 1834 to 1838. Village (1840‚Äì1886) A village began to develop on the main road near Feldhausen in the 1830s, and by 1840 it had become known as 'Claremont'. The annual Cape Almanac for 1840South African Directory & Almanack (1840) described the area and stated that : > The new village of 'Claremont' succeeds, near to which, on the left, is > 'Claremont House', the property of R. Waters Esq, who has lately laid out > the grounds with much taste, in the manner usually known as the English > style of landscape gardening. The village grew during the 1840s and 1850s. Public transport consisted of horse-drawn omnibuses which plied along the Main Road from 1837 until the railway was opened in 1864.Coates, P.R. (1976). Track and Trackless In 1863, the Anglo-Italian immigrant and businessman John Molteno, who was later to become the Cape Colony's first prime minister, bought 140 acres of land centred on the Claremont House estate. The property was subdivided and developed from 1897 onwards, and Claremont House itself, situated in modern terms between Molteno Road to Pine Road, was later demolished. However its two extensions, Greenfield House and Barkly House, still stand today as schools. Claremont Train Station. See photosphere version The opening of the railway from Cape Town to Wynberg in 1864 spurred subdivision and development.http://www.atlanticrail.co.za/stations_history.php The Feldhausen estate (also known as \\"The Grove\\") was subdivided in 1869‚Äì1870. A new Congregational Church was built on the Main Road in 1877. The Claremont Hall was opened in 1879. The land along Lansdowne Road east of the railway line was subdivided and developed from 1882, creating a large residential area which is now known as \\"Harfield Village\\". Municipality (1886‚Äì1913) In 1882, a village management board was formed, and in 1886 it was replaced by the Municipality of Claremont, which managed neighbouring Newlands too. The privately owned Claremont Hall was taken over as a town hall. The first telephone system was installed in the early 1880s. There was further residential development, with the subdivision of the Claremont House, Lansdowne, Milburn House, and Paradise estates in the 1890s. An electricity power station was built, and an electric tramway service was introduced in 1897. The housing boom which followed the Anglo-Boer War saw the subdivision of further estates in the 1900s. Most streets were named in 1903‚Äì1904, many of them thematically (e.g. after saints, explorers, British counties and towns, American presidents, and British politicians).Hart, P. (1999). Claremont, Newlands and Bishopscourt Street Names Suburb (1913‚Äì ) In 1913, Claremont and several other municipalities were incorporated into the city of Cape Town. Considerable residential growth took place in the 1920s and 1930s, when estates such as Palmyra, Keurboom, Ravensworth, Sanatorium Estate, The Vineyard, Wyndover, and Edinburgh Estate were subdivided and developed. An additional railway station, named \\"Harfield Road\\", was built in 1931. The government enforced its apartheid system on Claremont in the 1960s, forcing the Coloured residents to leave. As a result, large areas of the suburb stood derelict for several years. Claremont remained predominantly residential until the early 1970s, when commercial development began. A major shopping mall, named Cavendish Square, was opened in 1973, and other shopping centres followed. There was a further building boom in the 1990s, and the suburb is currently experiencing another, which includes the construction of three large apartment blocks, a hotel, two office blocks, the re-modeling of three other commercial buildings, and the construction of a transport interchange and a bypass road.

It consisted of a weekday single return service using diesel multiple unit railcars. Like its southern counterpart, the Capital Connection between Palmerston North and Wellington, the service was operated by Tranz Scenic and run as a commercial venture. The service is expected to be restored in 2021 for a five-year trial as \\"Te Huia\\".  History = Operation  The service commenced as a six-month trial on 26 June 2000 and was primarily aimed at business people who regularly commuted to work in Auckland. It used Silver Fern railcars with full onboard catering and stopped at the intermediate stations of Huntly, Pukekohe, Papakura, Middlemore, and Newmarket. Four months into the trial the service was reported to be \\"performing up to expectations\\" and was later extended beyond the trial period.  Demise  Tranz Rail announced in October 2000 that it intended to exit the passenger rail business to concentrate on its freight interests. The new owner of Tranz Scenic, two directors of West Coast Railway in Australia, had limited purchase funds, and so were only prepared to purchase the most profitable services, prompting Tranz Rail to terminate those services that were not purchased, including the Waikato Connection. It was officially cancelled on 7 October 2001 along with the Geyserland Express, the Kaimai Express, and the Bay Express. A replacement Tranz Metro service between Auckland and Pukekohe commenced the following day. Efforts were made to save the service prior to its cancellation, including an investigation made by Environment Waikato into the possibility of subsidising it. The Council, which at the time had a policy of not subsidising rail services, decided against providing funding at $400,000 pa, which was deemed to be too expensive. An approach was also made to the government for funding, especially in light of the subsidy that they had extended for the Southerner, but this was also declined. West Coast Railway reported that the Waikato Connection was \\"the most unprofitable service\\" but that they would be prepared to consider retaining it with community support which they expected would be needed for about three years. At the time of its cancellation the Waikato Connection was being patronised by an average of 129 passengers per trip, most of whom boarded at Pukekohe or Papakura, with only about 30 of those travelling the full distance between Hamilton and Auckland. Some considered the cancellation premature as the service was beginning to grow in popularity.  Predecessor  A refurbished NZR RM class (88 seater) nicknamed the Blue Streak was used for a trial Hamilton‚ÄìAuckland service from 8 April 1968, which was discontinued for lack of patronage.  Reintroduction  The service will be reintroduced in August 2020 as Te Huia.

He is described as: \\"... one of those who most influenced progress in fluid dynamics during the 20th century.\\" He was especially known for his work on steady-flow laminar boundary-layer equations and on the turbulent resistance to rotation of a disk in a fluid. Goldstein was extremely knowledgeable on aerodynamics and his work had a significant impact in that area. Early life Goldstein went to school at Bede Collegiate School in SunderlandSYDNEY GOLDSTEIN, Who was Who, A&C; Black and went on to the University of Leeds in 1921 where he studied mathematics but was to move to St John's College, Cambridge, graduating from the Mathematical Tripos in 1925 and gaining the Smith's Prize in 1927. He was awarded an Isaac Newton Studentship to continue research in applied mathematics under Harold Jeffreys. His 1928 PhD thesis was entitled The Theory And Application Of Mathieu Functions. Career He was appointed Rockefeller Research Fellow and spent a year working in University of G√∂ttingen. In 1929 he became a fellow of St John's College but later the same year was appointed to a lectureship in Mathematics at the University of Manchester. At Manchester the influence of Osborne Reynolds and Horace Lamb in fluid dynamics was still felt there and had a strong effect on Goldstein. Moving to Cambridge in 1931 he took over the editorship of Modern Developments in Fluid Dynamics on Lamb's death. During World War II Goldstein worked on boundary layer theory at the National Physical Laboratory and at the end of the war he was appointed to the Beyer Chair of Applied Mathematics in Manchester. Goldstein strongly supported the State of Israel and in 1950 he accepted the chairmanship of the department of mathematics at Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology. having made a major contribution to the establishment of the Technion he found the administrative load too heavy and moved again, accepting the chair of Gordon McKay Professor of Applied Mathematics at Harvard University in 1954.

It is situated at Metlakatla Pass near Prince Rupert, British Columbia. It is the one Tsimshian village in Canada that is not associated with one particular tribe or set of tribes out of the Tsimshian nation's 14 constituent tribes.  History  The name derives from Tsimshian Maax≈Çakxaa≈Ça meaning \\"saltwater pass.\\" Traditionally, this site has been the collective winter village of the \\"Nine Tribes\\" of the lower Skeena River, which since 1834 have been mostly based at Lax Kw'alaams, B.C. In 1862, the Anglican lay minister William Duncan established at Metlakatla a utopian Christian community, made up of about 350 Tsimshian from Lax Kw'alaams (a.k.a. Port Simpson) but with members of other Tsimshian tribes as well. Almost immediately thereafter, a smallpox epidemic tore through Lax Kw'alaams but left Metlakatla relatively unscathed, which Duncan interpreted for his followers as a sign of God's providence. Some of these followers, including Duncan's key convert, Paul Legaic, the most powerful Tsimshian chief, continued to divide their time between Lax Kw'alaams and Metlakatla and continued to divide their allegiances between Christianity and the traditional culture. Other missionaries who served in Metlakatla have included Robert Tomlinson (briefly), as well as William Henry Collison, author of the North Coast missionary memoir In the Wake of the War Canoe. By 1879 the population had grown to about 1,100. Duncan's own style, in the image of which the new community was shaped, was a dissident, evangelical form of low-church Anglicanism that omitted the sacrament of communion. This, and his independent temperament, led to Duncan's expulsion from the Church of England's Church Missionary Society in 1881 and the creation of his own nondenominational \\"Independent Native Church.\\" Eventually, in 1887, he took with him 800-some Metlakatla Tsimshians in an epic canoe journey to found the new community of \\"New\\" Metlakatla, Alaska. After Duncan's departure, the 100 or so remaining residents of \\"Old Metlakatla,\\" as it was now sometimes known, were left in the hands of William Ridley, Duncan's nemesis and the Anglican bishop of the newly formed Diocese of Caledonia. In July 1901 a fire destroyed St. Paul's Church at Metlakatla, demolishing what was said to have been the largest church north of San Francisco and west of Chicago, built by Duncan in 1874. Some sources indicate that the fire was started by a band of Alaska Tsimshians under Duncan's orders, including Peter Simpson, later the prominent Alaska Native rights activist. This tragic fire led to Ridley's departure for England in 1905. A second St. Paul's Church was built in 1903 and was burned 11 years later. In 1972, Metlakatla Pass was designated a National Historic Site of Canada. Since those days, Metlakatla, B.C., has remained among the smallest of the Tsimshian communities. In 1983 its population was 117, and quite dependent on the nearby city of Prince Rupert. It is still predominantly Anglican. In November 2016, a study published in Nature Communications linked the genome of 25 Indigenous people who inhabited modern-day Prince Rupert, British Columbia 1000 to 6000 years ago with their descendants in the Metlakatla First Nation. The study validated the oral history of the Metlakatla, which had maintained their presence in the region for thousands of years.

He is sometimes regarded as the first humanist of the Early Middle Ages because of the quality of his literary style, his love of learning, and his work as a scribe and textual critic.  Early life  Lupus was born into an influential family within the Archdiocese of Sens. Many of his family held influential positions in the Church or court. His father was Bavarian and his mother Frankish. He assumed the nickname of Servatus in commemoration of his miraculous escape from danger either in a serious illness or on the battlefield. He began his education at the Abbey of Saints Peter and Paul in Ferri√®res-en-G√¢tinais under St. Aldric, then abbot of the monastery. Here he was educated in the trivium and quadrivium. Lupus was not fond of the required learning but developed a passion for Classical studies. Abbot Aldric saw fit to send him to deepen his theological education at the Abbey of Fulda under Rabanus Maurus. Spending years in study and writing he developed a reputation as a scholar. Rabanus made use of his pupil, having him translate and compose bodies or works. During his residence at Fulda (c. 830‚Äì36) he became an intimate friend and disciple of the learned Einhard, whose Vita Karoli magni he was one of the first to read and praised it because of its style (epist. 1, 5). Lupus had written a letter to Einhard expressing his admiration and asked for a loan of Einhard's secular works (this would become a common practice of Lupus). His opinion was that education should be esteemed and intended not for a certain purpose, but as a good of its own value (epist. 1, 5). He was interested therefore not only in Christian but also in pagan classical authors and even those who did not belong to the reading canon of the Carolingian schools, such as Suetonius, of whom he was one of very few readers in the early Middle Ages, and Cicero, whose works he seems to know almost in their entirety, not only his better known rhetorical writings, and whom he mentions and cites very often. He borrowed manuscripts from Einhard (epist. 1, 6) and from the library of the monastery of Fulda and corresponded therefore with Abbot Markward (epist. 10, 4; 91, 4). Even before Lupus returned to France he had become favourably known at court and was especially esteemed by the Empress Judith, the second wife of Louis the Pious. Lupus returned to Ferri√®res in 836 and followed the normal life of a monk, although he became recognized as the literary leader of Ferri√®res, until his election as abbot on 22 November 840. He owed his election to Empress Judith and her son, Charles the Bald, whose political interests he always defended.  Lupus as abbot  After Louis the Pious died in 840, there were widespread uprisings and rivalries. One of his other sons, Lothair, recently named as emperor, invaded the western territories of Charles, Louis' designated heir. The current Abbot of Ferri√®res, Odo, was uncertain which ruler had rights to his fealty. Eventually Odo supported Lothair either because he seemed far more likely to provide support for Ferri√®res or because he saw him as the legitimate heir and representative of the unity of the empire. When the Treaty of Verdun was negotiated, Lothair gave up to Charles authority over the lands where Ferri√®res was situated. As a result of Odo's past support of Lothair, Charles had him removed from the abbacy. Lupus was left in charge of the abbey in Odo's absence. His position of abbot was formalized because of an election prompted by Charles the Bald, due to Lupus' ties to his family. Subsequently, Lupus took a prominent part in contemporary political and ecclesiastical events. As Abbot of Ferri√®res he devoted himself to the spiritual and earthly concerns of the monastery. He waged a war of letters to try and regain the land of Ferrieres which had been handed over to a private owner thereby causing the monastery's revenue to drop.  Military service  In these days it was common for abbots to serve as military commanders who supplied their own forces, if the king decided to go to war. Ferri√®res was one of these monasteries that had to provide soldiers and accommodate them. Lupus was not fond of leading soldiers into battle. He wrote a letter to the Bishop of Pordalus, begging him to use his authority to influence the king so that he could carry on as an abbot, not as a military leader. During the war between Charles the Bald and Pepin I of Aquitaine, Lupus was captured at the Battle of Toulouse and held prisoner. Shortly after his capture he was ransomed with several other high ranking men.  Public affairs  In 844 Lupus was sent to Burgundy to carry out the monastic reforms decreed by the Synod of Germigny (843), and attended the Synod of Verneuil on the Oise, whose resulting canons had been written by him. He was also present at several other Church councils, notably that of Soissons in 853, and played an important part in the contemporary controversy regarding predestination. He believed in a twofold predestination, not indeed in the sense that God predestined some men to damnation, but that he foreknew the sins of men and foreordained consequent punishment. \\"Lupus not only took part in the most lively ecclesiastical controversy of his age, but also, by the method of his treatment, showed himself a skilled dialectician at the time when dialectics were still very imperfectly developed.\\" In 847 Lupus accompanied Charles the Bald to a conference at Meerssen, whereby the three brothers again swore peace with one other. He was sent on a mission to Pope Leo IV in 849. Following the invasion by Nominoe, the Governor of Brittany, Lupus composed the letter of censure. His last civic appearance was in 862 at the Synod of Pistes where he drew up a sentence against Robert, Archbishop of Mans. The closing years of the life of Lupus were saddened by the threatened devastation of his monastery by the invading Normans. He occupies a prominent place in medieval literary history, being one of the most cultured and refined men of the ninth century.  Writings  During the reign of Charles the Bald an enormous amount of written material was produced. Lupus' letters, of which 132 remain, are distinguished for literary elegance and valuable historical information. Most of these letters were written to church officials, monks in neighboring monasteries, clergymen, Popes Benedict III and Nicholas I, Charles the Bald and Lothair. His own writings show him as a classicist and admirer of the Ciceronian style. He made his vast translation of Cicero's letters serve as a code of communicating with other well-read individuals. Lupus was requested in 839 by Waldo, the Abbot of St. Maximin of Treves, to write the Life of St. Maximin Bishop of Trier (d. 349) and a \\"Life of St. Wigbert\\", Abbot of Fritzlar in Hesse (d. 747). He also wrote his Epistolae in which almost on every page had forms of direct quotations and paraphrases revealing his familiarity of the Vulgate edition. In the controversy on predestination he wrote his De tribus quaestionibus, a work which treated of the threefold question of free will, predestination, and the universality of redemption. To illustrate the teaching of the Church on these topics he brought together pertinent passages from the Church Fathers in his \\"Collectaneum de tribus quaestionibus\\".  Literary contribution  Lupus made a tireless quest of manuscripts of classic authors, as it has long been known to readers of his letters. It is because of his passion for copying and preserving manuscripts so that they may be passed on that he is regarded as an influential literate figure and the first humanist. Though his personal works and letters discuss theological matters it was not his chief interest. Philology was his desired area of expertise. Scholars have increasingly become aware of the detailed examination that Lupus undertook when studying his acquired texts. The scholar E.K. Rand of Harvard University reveals: > \\"...no less than five manuscripts that contain the corrections or collations > of Lupus and one that is entirely written by that scholar himself.\\" These manuscripts are rewrites of Cicero's De Oratore, his De Inventione and his Letters, a Commentary on Virgil and a revision of Codex Bernensis 366. Over the years modern scholars have made investigations as to what Lupus had participated in. Charles H. Beeson has been the foremost scholar on Lupus Servatus. Beeson took to studying the different handwriting styles of manuscripts according to area of the Early Middle Ages. He concluded that Lupus had written or been a part of copying texts more than originally thought. Lupus had a rigid adherence to the rules of the Roman grammarians for the division of syllables, whereby any pronounceable group of consonants is placed with the following vowel. Lupus not only conformed to this rule in his personal practice, but also made the texts that he collected adhere to the style.  References = Sources   External links * Servatus Lupus of Ferri√®res.

She served on the Oregon Court of Appeals from 1997 until her election to the state's Supreme Court in the 2006, an electoral campaign in which she defeated former Labor Commissioner and Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Roberts. Early life Virginia Linder was born in Colorado, the daughter of two teachers, but grew up mostly in Carmichael, California. Linder earned her first degree in political science from Southern Oregon State College in Ashland, Oregon in 1975. She then spent two years working on the East Coast in order to save money for law school before returning to Oregon in 1977 to study law at Willamette University College of Law in Salem. She graduated from Willamette in 1980 with a Juris Doctor. While in school she worked at the Oregon Department of Justice during both her second and third years of law school, clerking in the Appellate Division of the Attorney General's Office. Legal career She began her career as an Assistant Attorney General in the Appellate Division of the Oregon Department of Justice, starting in 1980. Then in 1984 Linder was appointed as assistant solicitor general of Oregon. In 1986, at the age of 33, she was appointed Oregon Solicitor General, being the first woman to hold that position and serving in that office for longer than anyone else in state history. During her time as Solicitor General, she represented the state of Oregon in front of the United States Supreme Court, winning Oregon v. ACF in 1994. Judicial career In 1997, she was appointed to the Court of Appeals by Governor John Kitzhaber, and was re-elected in 1998 and 2004. Her campaign for a seat on the Oregon Supreme Court began in 2005 when Chief Justice Wallace Carson, Jr. announced that he would retire from the court in 2006. She faced Roberts and Pendleton attorney Gene Hallman in the May primary, winning 39% of the vote to Roberts' 42%. Because no candidate won a majority of the votes, Linder and Roberts advanced to the November runoff. In that runoff, Linder defeated Roberts by 52% to 48%. Linder's campaign committee raised just over $350,000 for her campaign but was outspent by more than two-to-one by the Roberts committee, which raised over $710,000. Since 1998 she has been a professor at Willamette's law school. Linder was the first woman elected to the Oregon Supreme Court; all previous female justices had been appointed to fill vacancies. She was also the first ever openly lesbian member of a state supreme court anywhere in the nation and the first openly LGBT person elected as a non-incumbent to a state supreme court. When in office, she served as one of eight openly LGBT supreme court justices in the United States, alongside fellow Oregonian Rives Kistler, Colorado Supreme Court justice Monica Marquez, Hawaii Supreme Court justice Sabrina McKenna, Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court justice Barbara Lenk, Connecticut Supreme Court justice Andrew J.

Early life and career Herbert William Lloyd was born in South Yarra, Melbourne, the son of a police officer. He was educated at University High School and Wesley College. On 26 June 1902 he joined the public service in the treasury department. Lloyd was commissioned in the Australian Field artillery as a second lieutenant on 9 July 1906. He was promoted to lieutenant on 2 July 1907 and then to captain on 16 August 1909. On 31 March 1910, Lloyd quit the treasury department and joined the Permanent Forces as a full lieutenant. He was promoted to captain again on 1 May 1914. First World War Lloyd was appointed to the Australian Imperial Force on 18 August 1914 with the rank of captain as adjutant of the 1st Field Artillery Brigade, which sailed for Egypt in October 1914. He landed on Cape Helles with the 1st Brigade on 4 May 1915. On 9 May 1915, the commander of the 1st Field Artillery Battery, Major Sweetland, was evacuated sick and Lloyd took over as battery commander. The battery fired in support of the British until shifted to Anzac Cove in September, Lloyd remaining in command until Gallipoli was evacuated in December. For his services at Gallipoli, Lloyd was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). Lloyd held the position of Brigade Major of the 2nd Divisional Artillery from 1 January to 11 March 1916. In preparation for the move to the Western Front, the number of batteries per division was increased from nine to sixteen. As a consequence, most of the original battery commanders were given brigades to form. Lloyd was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 12 March 1916 and given the new 22nd Field Artillery (Howitzer) Brigade. On 13 April 1916 he took over the 5th Field Artillery Brigade and in February to March 1917 was acting commander of the 2nd Divisional Artillery. He commanded the artillery in support of an advance column under the command of Brigadier General Harold Edward Elliott. In May he became acting commander of the 2nd Divisional Artillery again. For his services in these battles, Lloyd was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG), and awarded the Serbian Order of the White Eagle. Lloyd took over command of the 6th Field Artillery Brigade on 28 November 1917 and then the 12th Field Artillery Brigade on 7 February 1918. Lloyd was credited with turning the 12th Artillery Brigade into an outstanding unit. On 11 April 1918, Lloyd and his 12th Brigade was sent forward to assist the Scottish infantry attempting to stop the German advance in the Lys sector. On 8 November 1918, Lloyd took over command of the 5th Divisional Artillery from Brigadier General Alfred Bessell- Browne and was promoted to temporary brigadier general. On 5 December Lloyd took over command of the 1st Divisional Artillery, holding the position until 24 March 1919. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1919 King's Birthday Honours for his services on the Western Front, during which time he had been Mentioned in Despatches four times. Between the wars Lloyd's appointment to the AIF was terminated on 15 July 1919 and he was posted to Army Headquarters in Melbourne where he was Chief Inspector of Field Artillery from 16 July to 1 November 1919, Director of Artillery from 2 November 1919 to 31 March 1920, and general staff officer Artillery from 1 April to 3 September 1920. While in the AIF he had been given the rank of brevet major on 1 December 1915. He was promoted to the substantive rank of major on 1 November 1919 and brevet rank of lieutenant colonel on the same day. He was promoted to the permanent rank of lieutenant colonel on 1 January 1920. He held the honorary rank of brigadier general from 8 November 1918. Lloyd acted as transport officer for the 1920 visit to Australia of the then Prince of Wales, for which he was appointed a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO). From September 1920 to January 1922, Lloyd attended the Staff College at Quetta, in India. On his return to Australia Lloyd was posted to 1st Division Headquarters in Sydney from 1 February 1922 to 26 August 1925. Lloyd resigned from the permanent forces on 26 August 1925 and transferred to the Militia's unattached list. In 1925 Lloyd took up a job with Vacuum Oil. He was elected as the Nationalist candidate for the Legislative Assembly seat of Parramatta at the 1929 by-election following the death of the Nationalist member, Albert Bruntnell. He was defeated in the 1930 election, but in 1932 won the seat of Mosman as a United Australia Party candidate, holding the seat at the 1935, and 1938 elections. He was defeated by Donald Macdonald an Independent UAP candidate at the 1941 election. Second World War From May to July 1940, Lloyd held the post of Director General of Army Recruiting. He was recalled to active duty on 1 August 1940 with the rank of brigadier as Deputy Adjutant General at Army Headquarters. He was promoted to temporary major general on 23 October 1940 when he took over command of the 2nd Division, a Militia formation. From 25 April to 31 July 1941, he was also Director-General of Army Recruiting. In 1942, the 2nd Division was assigned to III Corps‚Äîcommanded by Lieutenant General Gordon Bennett‚Äîwhich was tasked with defending Western Australia. Lloyd joined the Second Australian Imperial Force on 15 January 1943 with the substantive rank of colonel, but as a temporary major general. However, in September 1943, he returned to Sydney to command the 1st Division, another Militia unit. On 8 May 1945, Lloyd took command of the Second Army. General Sir Thomas Blamey recommended him for an active command, but the War Cabinet ruled that as Lloyd was now 61, the post-war army would be better served by the appointment of a younger officer. Lloyd retired on 1 February 1946 as a major general. He became a company director, with his appointments including the Adelaide Steamship Company. He died on 10 August 1957 and was cremated.

Fishing industry observers believe IUU occurs in most fisheries, and accounts for up to 30% of total catches in some important fisheries.World Wildlife Fund. \\"Fishing problems: Illegal fishing\\" Illegal fishing takes place when vessels or harvesters operate in violation of the laws of a fishery. This can apply to fisheries that are under the jurisdiction of a coastal state or to high seas fisheries regulated by regional fisheries management organisations (RFMO). According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Fisheries and Aquaculture Department, illegal fishing has caused losses estimated at US$23 billion per year, with about 30% of illegal fishing in the world occurring in Indonesia alone. Unreported fishing is fishing that has been unreported or misreported to the relevant national authority or RFMO, in contravention of applicable laws and regulations. Unregulated fishing generally refers to fishing by vessels without nationality, vessels flying the flag of a country not party to the RFMO governing that fishing area or species on the high seas, or harvesting in unregulated areas. The drivers behind illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing are similar to those behind many other types of international environmental crime: pirate fishers have a strong economic incentive ‚Äì many species of fish, particularly those that have been over-exploited and are thus in short supply, are of high financial value. Such IUU activity may then show a high chance of success ‚Äì i.e. a high rate of return ‚Äì from the failure of governments to regulate adequately (e.g. inadequate coverage of international agreements), or to enforce national or international laws (e.g. because of lack of capacity, or poor levels of governance). A particular driver behind IUU fishing is the failure of a number of flag states to exercise effective regulation over ships on their registers ‚Äì which in turn creates an incentive for ships to register under these flags of convenience. Since no one reports catches made by pirates, their level of fishing cannot be accurately quantified. Economic and environmental impacts One economic impact of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing on developing countries is the direct loss of the value of the catches that could be taken by local fishermen if the IUU fishing were not taking place. These losses include a loss to GNP, and government revenues from landing fees, licence fees, and taxes payable by legal fishing operators. There are further indirect impacts in terms of loss of income and employment in related industries; losses in income will tend to reduce the consumer expenditures of families working in the fishing industry. IUU harvests may be brought to market at a lower price as unfair competition to the same products from the regulated supply or as a mislabeled competing product. In either situation this illegal unregulated contribution to the market may lower the overall quality and price of products available, thus creating an economic burden on harvesters following the laws and regulations. IUU fishing can have a significant impact on the sustainability of both the targeted species and the ecosystem. Fishing generally has the capacity to damage fragile marine ecosystems and vulnerable species such as coral reefs, turtles and seabirds. In fact, all eight sea turtle species are now endangered, and illegal fishing and hunting are two major reasons for their destruction. Regulating legitimate fisheries is aimed at mitigating such impacts, but IUU fishers rarely comply with regulations. This may reduce future productivity and biodiversity and create imbalances in the ecosystem. This may lead to reduced food security in communities heavily dependent on fish as a source of animal protein. IUU fishing can also lead to increased pressure on endangered fish species. IUU fishing can directly affect the population of fish species by increasing the number of fish caught within the population in spite of population management efforts by the international community. Indirectly, the substitution (mislabeling) of IUU caught fish for popular, but threatened or endangered species, increases the perceived supply of these species, thus decreasing the price and increasing the demand for the fish species. Certification and labeling Mandatory product certification and catch documentation are increasingly part of fishery monitoring and enforcement, and to exclude IUU products from consumer markets. Certification is also used for timber and for diamonds, which have analogous enforcement problems. Labels can reward harvesters and supply chains which honor regulations. Labeling may also provide accountability for adaptive management planning, as well-managed fisheries may provide higher quality products and more stable economics for producers.Presidential Task Force on Combating IUU Fishing and Seafood Fraud Action Plan for Implementing the Task Force Recommendations at noaa.gov. 2014-5.Waitt Institute. Factsheet: Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing The use of certification or catch document schemes is encouraged in the FAO's International Plan of Action on IUU Fishing. Several RFMOs include them, including CCAMLR's Catch Documentation Scheme for Toothfish, CCSBT's Trade Information Scheme for Southern Bluefin Tuna and ICCAT's Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document Programme. Similar systems are applied at a national level, including the USA's Certification of Origin of Tuna and Tuna Tracking and Verification Systems, Japan's reporting requirements (including area of capture) for all imports or transportation of tunas into Japan by boat, and the EU's labelling of all fish products (including area of capture). Marine Stewardship Council The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) is an international non-profit organization that runs a certification and ecolabelling program for traceable, sustainable seafood. To achieve certification as sustainable a fishery must meet a standard based on three principles: # ensuring healthy fish stocks # minimal impact on the marine ecosystem # effective management (which includes ensuring the fishery operates within national and international laws). Fisheries that meet the MSC standard for a sustainable fishery can use the blue MSC ecolabel on their seafood products. The second element of the program is a certification for seafood traceability. This is called MSC Chain of Custody. From the fishery, every company in the supply chain that handles the certified fish is checked to ensure the MSC label is only applied to fish products that come from a certified fishery. This requires effective record-keeping and storage procedures. This traceability element of the program helps to keep illegally fished seafood out of the supply chain by linking seafood sold in shops and restaurants to a certified sustainable fishery. The MSC eco-label enables consumers to easily identify sustainable seafood when shopping or dining out. As of June 2014, there are over 14,000 MSC-labelled seafood products sold in over 90 countries around the world. The MSC website lists outlets selling MSC-certified seafood. The six MSC certified Patagonian toothfish and Antarctic toothfish fisheries (which are the South Georgia, Ross Sea, Heard Island, Macquarie Island, Kerguelen Islands and Falkland Islands fisheries) provide a good example of how good fisheries management can reverse the trend of illegal fishing. These fisheries took significant steps to exclude illegal vessels from their waters: * strict vessel licensing systems are rigorously enforced, * each vessel must have at least 1 CCAMLR approved Government observer on board its vessel to verify catch data, * each vessel must have port-to-port monitoring of its movements via two tamper-proof Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) units on board, * all toothfish product that is transported must be accompanied by a CCAMLR Dissostichus Catch Document (DCD), with details of where and when that fish was caught. These are only some of the measures taken by the toothfish fisheries to achieve MSC certification. Further information on each of these toothfish fisheries can be found on the MSC website.http://www.msc.org =Responsible Fishing Scheme= The Responsible Fishing Scheme is the only global standard that audits compliance on board fishing vessels, including ethical and welfare criteria. First launched in 2006 by Seafish to help fishing vessels demonstrate their commitment to a responsibly sourced catch, in January 2016 a revised scheme was launched to include the health and safety and welfare of crew on board. The new scheme has been re-developed in accordance with the requirements of internationally recognised standard ISO17065. Initially focused on vessels supplying the UK market, the scheme will be rolled out internationally over the next two years. The Responsible Fishing Scheme website has the most up to date information.http://www.seafish.org/rfs Seafish is the UK's authority on seafood. It was founded in 1981 by an Act of Parliament and aims to support all sectors of the seafood industry for a sustainable, profitable and socially responsible future. It is the only pan-industry body offering services to all parts of the industry, from the start of the supply chain at catching and aquaculture; through processing, importers, exporters and distributors of seafood right through to restaurants and retailers. Seafish is funded by a levy on the first sale of seafood landed in the UK. Its services are intended to support and improve the environmental sustainability, efficiency and cost- effectiveness of the industry, as well as promoting responsibly-sourced seafood. Enforcement Design for an environmental protection patrol vessel Illegal and unreported fishing (two of the three components of IUU fishing) essentially arise from a failure to adequately enforce existing national and international laws. There are, however, many factors underlying enforcement failure, including, notably, poor levels of national governance. There are obvious problems with enforcing fisheries regulations on the high seas, including locating and apprehending the pirate ships, but solutions are available, chiefly through improved monitoring and surveillance systems. Many fishermen are getting away with IUU ocean fishing due to the difficulty of monitoring every single fishing boat. This will begin to change with new technology that is able to watch and follow each boat from space consistently. This will be done through radio beacons, which all boats in the ocean are required to have. By implementing this new monitoring system, it will be impossible for fishermen to get away with IUU fishing in the future. MSC systems are similarly of value within exclusive economic zones, including, for example, offshore patrols and licensing schemes. Flag state liability Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, states bear responsibility for the vessels (including fishing vessels) that fly their flag. While it is uncontroversial that individuals engaged in IUU fishing may be subject to legal sanctions, the extent to which flag states may be held liable under international law for the IUU fishing activities of their vessels is less clearly defined. In March, 2013 the issue of flag state liability for IUU fishing was brought before the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea in a request for an advisory opinion submitted by the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission (SRFC) of West Africa. \\"Request for an Advisory Opinion Submitted by the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission (SRFC)\\" The SRFC asked the Tribunal to advise on the following four questions: # What are the obligations of the flag State in cases where illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities are conducted within the Exclusive Economic Zone of third party States? # To what extent shall the flag State be held liable for IUU fishing activities conducted by vessels sailing under its flag? # Where a fishing license is issued to a vessel within the framework of an international agreement with the flag State or with an international agency, shall the State or international agency be held liable for the violation of the fisheries legislation of the coastal State by the vessel in question? # What are the rights and obligations of the coastal State in ensuring the sustainable management of shared stocks and stocks of common interest, especially the small pelagic species and tuna? In its submissions to the Tribunal, the SRFC emphasized the severity of the IUU fishing problem in West Africa and the need for a clear regime of flag state responsibilities with respect to vessels engaged in this trade. \\"Written Statement of the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission\\" The SRFC argued that its member states had been unable to mount successful prosecutions against IUU fishers following boardings due to a lack of support and cooperation from flag states. A number of states and international organizations also made submissions adopting a range positions with respect to the four questions above. It was held by some states that the Tribunal lacked the advisory jurisdiction to respond to these questions. Both the government of Spain, a major contributor to the problem of IUU fishing, as well as the United Kingdom adopted such a view. A number of other states took the position that flag state responsibility for IUU fishing should take the form of a general responsibility to perform due diligence with respect to vessels and their activities, rather than an obligation to assist in prosecutions or another more substantive requirement. In its Advisory Opinion issued on April 2, 2015, the Tribunal adopted the ‚Äúdue diligence‚Äù approach. The Tribunal found that flag states are under only a general obligation to take the necessary measures to ensure that their nationals and vessels flying their flag are not engaged in IUU fishing activities. This obligation may be satisfied by adhering to generally accepted international norms of fishing vessel regulation and complying with international treaties that indicate best practices. At the same time, the Tribunal found that in coastal waters the coastal state bears primary responsibility for preventing IUU fishing and not the flag state. Political processes=EU action plan The EU helped draw up FAO's international plan of action to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing, endorsed by the FAO Council in June 2001. The EU then developed its own plan to implement the commitments agreed at international level, and the European Commission's action plan for the eradication of IUU fishing was published in May 2002. It is intended to be implemented at four levels: At the EU level, more responsibility will be requested with regard to member state nationals acting under a flag of convenience. Moreover, market measures concerning fisheries products caught in violation of the international agreements will be adopted. In addition, information actions addressed to the fishing industry, consumers, and the public will be launched to raise their awareness. In the framework of Regional Fisheries Management Organisations, control and inspection plans would be adopted as well as specific conservation and management measures. In addition IUU vessels would be identified and monitored and their catches would be quantified. At the international level, concepts like genuine link would be defined, and a number of rights and obligations of the port state would be established. Moreover, the exchange of information on IUU activities and the international co-operation would be strengthened. In partnership with developing countries, the necessary means would be provided to enable them to effectively control fishing activities undertaken in waters under their jurisdiction. European Commission sanctions against states operating open ship registries and flags of convenience for illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing have been effective in pressuring states to reform or limit their open ship registries to fishing vessels, or at least in severely curtailing registrations under that jurisdiction. These sanctions generally limit or ban access to the European Common Market for fisheries products produced by vessels of a certain state. High Seas Task Force The High Seas Task Force comprises a group of fisheries ministers and international NGOs working together to develop an action plan designed to combat IUU fishing on the high seas. Launched in 2003, the Task Force includes fisheries ministers from Australia, Canada, Chile, Namibia, New Zealand and the UK, together with the Earth Institute, IUCN-World Conservation Union, WWF International and the Marine Stewardship Council. The goal of the Task Force is to set priorities among a series of practical proposals for confronting the challenge of IUU fishing on the high seas. A series of expert panels have been convened to identify the legal, economic, scientific and enforcement factors that permit IUU activity to thrive, and then determine key points of leverage that can brought to bear at national, regional, and global levels to minimise the incentives to carry out IUU fishing on the high seas. The completed action plan, published on 3 March 2006, will be placed by ministerial members of the Task Force directly in the hands of other ministers.  Regional Fisheries Management Organizations  Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) are affiliations of nations that co-ordinate efforts to manage fisheries in a particular region.http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/IRS?iid=4566 RFMOs may focus on certain species of fish (e.g. the Commission for the Conservation of Southern bluefin tuna) or have a wider remit related to living marine resources in general within a region (e.g. the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR)). This wide diversity of mandates and areas of application, and also effective implementation of regulations, opens up opportunities for IUU vessels.FAO website UN high seas processes The present system of high seas governance has evolved over a period of several hundred years, the end result being a patchwork quilt of measures in the form of binding and non-binding instruments with different geographical and legal reaches and different levels of participation. Most legal instruments build on the foundation established by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which was agreed in 1982 and entered into force in 1992. The UN Fish Stocks Agreement, which entered into force in 2001, sets out principles for the conservation and management of fish stocks and establishes that such management must be based on the precautionary approach and the best available scientific information. The Agreement provides a framework for cooperation on conservation and management, but since only about a third of the parties to the Law of the Sea Convention have ratified it, its impact is inevitably limited. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) carries out much of the technical work on international fisheries management, and provides a forum for the negotiation of agreements and codes of conduct. In 1995 the FAO agreed its Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries to promote long-term sustainable management. In 2001, the FAO adopted the International Plan of Action (IPOA) on IUU Fishing. The aim of this voluntary instrument is to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing by providing all states with comprehensive, effective and transparent measures by which to act, including through appropriate regional fisheries management organisations established in accordance with international law. The FAO Compliance Agreement, which entered into force in 2003, is designed to close a major loophole in international fisheries management, that of the circumvention of fisheries regulations by ‚Äòre-flagging‚Äò vessels under the flags of states that are unable or unwilling to enforce such measures. In 2009, the FAO brokered the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing, which entered into force in 2016. The agreement closes ports to vessels suspected of illegal fishing. The treaty requires that fishing vessels request permission to dock and inform the port of the details of its fishing operations. Permission to dock can be denied if unregulated fishing was occurring. The measure is intended to block illegally caught fish from entering the marketplace. Other measures in the treaty include inspections of equipment, paperwork, catches, and ship's records. Though the treaty does not compel countries to apply these measures to ships under their own flags, they may choose to do so under the agreement. China The Chinese commercial fishing fleet is responsible for more IUU fishing than that of any other nation. The overcapitalization of the Chinese fishing fleet has exacerbated traditional concerns about IUU. From modernization through 2008 China reduced the capacity of their fishing fleet, since 2008 there has been a rapid increase in capacity due to the rise of the People‚Äôs Armed Forces Maritime Militia and subsidies given by regional and local governments to fishing companies to upgrade vessels and expand capacity. The other factors leading to the increase in China‚Äôs fishing fleet are the implementation of the BeiDou navigation/communication system and paramilitary training given to Chinese fishermen.

There is a great deal of grain farming in Uzbekistan, so breads and noodles are of importance, and Uzbek cuisine has been characterized as \\"noodle-rich\\".\\"The noodle-rich cuisine of Uzbekistan\\", The Village Voice, Dining, 19 January 1999. Mutton is a popular variety of meat due to the abundance of sheep in the country and it is a part of various Uzbek dishes. Uzbekistan's signature dish is palov (plov or osh or \\"pilaf\\"), a main course typically made with rice, pieces of meat, grated carrots and onions. It is usually cooked in a kazan (or deghi) over an open fire; chickpeas, raisins, barberries, or fruit may be added for variation. Although often prepared at home for family and guests by the head of household or the housewife, palov is made on special occasions by the oshpaz, or the osh master chef, who cooks the national dish over an open flame, sometimes serving up to 1,000 people from a single cauldron on holidays or occasions such as weddings. Oshi nahor, or \\"morning plov\\", is served in the early morning (between 6 and 9 am) to large gatherings of guests, typically as part of an ongoing wedding celebration. Other notable national dishes include: shurpa (shurva or shorva), a soup made of large pieces of fatty meat (usually mutton) and fresh vegetables; norin and lagman, noodle-based dishes that may be served as a soup or a main course; manti (also called qasqoni), chuchvara, and somsa, stuffed pockets of dough served as an appetizer or a main course; dimlama (a meat and vegetable stew) and various kebabs, usually served as a main course. Green tea is the national hot beverage taken throughout the day; teahouses (chaikhanas) are of cultural importance. Black tea is preferred in Tashkent. Both are typically taken without milk or sugar. Tea always accompanies a meal, but it is also a drink of hospitality, automatically offered green or black to every guest. Ayran, a chilled yogurt drink, is popular in the summer. The use of alcohol is less widespread than in the West. Uzbekistan has 14 wineries, the oldest and most famous being the Khovrenko Winery in Samarkand (est. 1927). The Samarkand Winery produces a range of dessert wines from local grape varieties: Gulyakandoz, Shirin, Aleatiko, and Kabernet likernoe (literally Cabernet dessert wine in Russian).Dessert wines from Uzbekistan Tokay-style wines from Uzbekistan Uzbek wines have received international awards and are exported to Russia and other countries in Central Asia. The choice of desserts in Uzbek cuisines is limited. A typical festive meal ends with fruit or a compote of fresh or dried fruit, followed by nuts and halvah with green tea. Bukharan Jewish cuisine Central Asian-style dumpling soup called shurbo dushpera or tushpera (left), along with traditional tandoor bread called lepyoshka in Russian and non in Uzbek, Tajik, and Bukharian (right) The cooking of Bukharan Jews forms a distinct cuisine within Uzbekistan, subject to the restrictions of Jewish dietary laws.Claudia Roden, The Book of Jewish Food: An Odyssey from Samarkand to New York, Alfred Knopf, New York (1996). The most typical Bukharan Jewish dish is oshi sabo (also osh savo or osovoh), a \\"meal in a pot\\" slowly cooked overnight and eaten hot for Shabbat lunch. Oshi sabo is made with meat, rice, vegetables, and fruit added for a unique sweet and sour taste.Oshi sabo recipe ; recipe in English from Jewish Woman , Fall 2005. By virtue of its culinary function (a hot Shabbat meal in Jewish homes) and ingredients (rice, meat, vegetables cooked together overnight), oshi sabo is a Bukharan version of cholent or hamin. In addition to oshi sabo, authentic Bukharian Jewish dishes include: * Osh palov - a Bukharian Jewish version of palov for weekdays, includes both beef and chicken. * Bakhsh - \\"green palov\\", rice with meat or chicken and green herbs (coriander, parsley, dill), exists in two varieties; bakhshi khaltagi cooked Jewish-style in a small bag immersed in a pot with boiling water or soup and bakhshi degi cooked like regular palov in a cauldron;Ethnographic Atlas of Uzbekistan: Central Asian Jews, p. 93 bakhshi khaltagi is precooked and therefore can be served on Shabbat. * Khalta savo - food cooked in a bag (usually rice and meat, possibly with the addition of dried fruit).Bukharian Jewish practice of cooking in a bag * Yakhni - a dish consisting of two kinds of boiled meat (beef and chicken), brought whole to the table and sliced before serving with a little broth and a garnish of boiled vegetables; a main course for Friday night dinner. * Kov roghan - fried pieces of chicken with fried potatoes piled on top.Kov roghan recipe and photo in Wiki Cookbook * Serkaniz (Sirkoniz) - garlic rice dish, another variation of palov. * Oshi piyozi - stuffed onion. * Shulah - a Bukharian-style risotto. * Boyjon - eggplant puree mixed only with salt and garlic, the traditional starter for the Friday-night meal in Bukharan Jewish homes. * Slotah Bukhori - a salad made with tomato, cucumber, green onion, cilantro, salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Some also put in lettuce and chili pepper. * Noni Toki - a crispy flat bread that is baked on the back of a wok. This method creates a bowl shaped bread. * Fried fish with garlic sauce (for Friday night dinner): \\"Every Bukharian Sabbath ... is greeted with a dish of fried fish covered with a pounded sauce of garlic and cilantro.\\"\\"The Silk Road Leads to Queens\\", Brief culinary history of Central Asia from New York Times, 18 January 2006, accessed 13 September 2008. In the Bukharan dialect, the dish is called mai birion or in full mai birion ovi sir, where mai birion is fried fish and ovi sir is garlic sauce (literally \\"garlic water\\"). Bread is sometimes fried and then dipped in the remaining garlic water and is called Noni-sir. Other Uzbek dishes * Oshi toki - stuffed grape leaves, similar to dolma, usually served as a cold appetizer. Breads Bread baking in Samarkand Patyr Traditional Uzbek bread, called generically noni or patyr, is baked in the form of circular flat loaves (lepyoshka in Russian) with a thin decorated depression at the center and a thicker rim all around. Nons are brought to the table with the decorated side up, then torn into irregular chunks which are stacked on the bread plate. Every region has different varieties of non, most prominent are: * Obi non is the staple bread of Uzbek cuisine. Obi nons are mentioned in one of the oldest written works, the Epic of Gilgamesh. Obi nons are baked in clay ovens called tandir. * Samarkand non. In different areas of Uzbekistan, obi non is baked in different ways. In Samarkand, small thick obi nons, the shirma nons are the most popular. * Bukhara obi non sprinkled with sesame or nigella, making a delicate aroma. * Wedding patir (flaky obi non) from Andijon and Qashqadaryo. According to ancient traditions, this aromatic bread prepared with cream and butter was served during matchmaking meetings. * Tashkent lochira, plate-formed obi non, baked from short pastry (milk, butter, and sugar). Jirish non is specially prepared bread from flour mixed with wheat. Nomadic tribes did not make tandirs because of their way of living, but cooked bread on butter in kazans (cauldrons), preparing the dough on a milk base.

Rugby Union career McCarthy played his first club rugby match in 1947 at the age of 27. After just one season he was selected for the state team and the following year he represented the national team. Former Queensland manager, Tom Blue, described McCarthy, along with Paul Costello as the \\"finds of the tour\\" following his first tour of New South Wales with the Queensland team in 1948. McCarthy was regarded as a hard rucking, tireless forward who displayed plenty of strength and vigour during his games against New South Wales. He earned his place on the Australian rugby union team and toured New Zealand in 1949. McCarthy was amongst an impressive Australian pack including, Col Windon, Keith Cross, Dave Brockhoff, Sir Nick Shehadie, Rex Mossop, Bevan Wilson, Nev Cottrell, and Jack Baxter. Captained by Trevor Allan, the Australian team of 1949 defeated the All Blacks in both tests and lost only one of its twelve games. McCarthy continued to display excellent form throughout the 1950 season. Max Hawkins wrote that McCarthy played \\"the game of his career\\" against the Western District. Hawkins continued his praise of McCarthy by writing that \\"he proved in Sydney that he is the finest tight forward playing in Australia today\\". Former Queensland manager-coach, Joe French, described McCarthy's game against the Western Districts as \\"one of the greatest forward efforts he had ever seen\\". McCarthy was selected to play in the first test against the British Isles in 1950. Captain Trevor Allan was forced to pull out of the Australian team two days before playing the first test match due to a thigh muscle injury. He was replaced by Nev Cotrell who led the team into what proved to be a bitter blow for the Australians. The Wallabies lost the first test by 19 points to 6. Welsh fullback, Lewis Jones, scored an impressive 16 of the teams 19 points. McCarthy retired from rugby union in 1950 but continued to play rugby league locally until 1956.

Despite being distributed throughout the world, they form a small family with only around 250 described species in 27 genera, although many await description and doubtless even more await discovery. These are generally small, sometimes minute, dark flies (from 0.6 to 5 mm), generally similar to black flies (Simuliidae), but usually lacking the humped thorax characteristic of that family. The larvae of most species are unknown, but the few that have been studied have a rather flattened shape and are terrestrial and saprophagous. Scatopsids are a well established group and fossils are known from amber deposits dating back to the Cretaceous period. Scatopse notata (Linnaeus, 1758) is a cosmopolitan species. Its larval stages are found in decaying plant and animal material.

Prior is instantly recognizable for his retro dress sense, usually a tartan jacket with a sheepskin collar and a pair of uncomfortable-looking platform shoes. * Alexander Graham Bell-End ‚Äì a crazy inventor who continually rubs his penis on things and then tricks his assistant into touching them with his hands or mouth, at which point Alexander laughs uproariously whilst exclaiming \\"I TOTALLY rubbed my bell end on that!\\" A pun on Alexander Graham Bell. * Anna Reksik ‚Äì a model who repeatedly vomits in order to keep her thin shape. Most strips involve Anna resorting to extreme lengths to lose weight (encouraged by her friend Belle Emia, a fellow model); only to unwittingly eat something that causes her to instantly put on an unrealistically huge amount of weight. The strip attracted press controversy because of the strip's portrayal of eating disorders and cocaine addiction. * Archie McBlarter - Everyday Farting Dilemmas - A newer strip featuring a middle-aged and rather obese man who has almost permanent trouble with his guts. He is his own worst enemy, as he loves the various types of food which cause extreme flatulence, such as scotch eggs, curries, beans, etc. Sometimes he comes to grief in the most extreme way, for example he has a giant fart at the same time a bolt of lightning hits his house, and the fart explodes spectacularly, destroying the home and he ending up in hospital! The last frame has him ordering his breakfast - scotch eggs! * Arse Farm ‚Äì A strip about a farmer who cultivates human buttocks on his land. * Arsehole Kate ‚Äì One-off parody of Keyhole Kate in which Kate instead likes to look up people's bottoms. * Auntie Cockwise ‚Äì An old lady who can tell the size of a man's penis just by looking at him, much to the amusement of her little nephew. * Bad Bob, the Randy Wonder Dog ‚Äì A strip about a policeman who visits a retirement home on Christmas Day with his Jack Russell terrier Bad Bob, who proceeds to have sex with one of the resident's legs causing him to have a heart attack (with Bad Bob doing the same to the thigh of the matron who bends down to try and revive him). * Badly Drawn Man ‚Äì a poorly drawn character. * Badly Overdrawn Boy ‚Äì a parody of the pop singer Badly Drawn Boy, who is seen busking outside his local bank because he's broke. * Balsa Boy ‚Äì a take on Pinocchio, in which a lonely old pensioner makes a \\"son\\" from balsa wood. While Balsa Boy does have dialogue, all the speech bubbles unambiguously emanate from the old man. The strip ends with the old man being sent to a mental institution after burning down the house while trying to dry off Balsa Boy in front of the fire, but by the last frame he is busy working on making another \\"boy\\" out of scones. * Barbara Cartland's ... ‚Äì a strip in which Barbara Cartland pays a visit somewhere (such as a farmyard or barber salon) and ends up inadvertently foiling criminals. * Barney Brimstone's Biscuit Tin Circus ‚Äì a boy who owns a miniature circus inside a biscuit tin. * Barry the Cat ‚Äì a one-off parody of The Beano's acrobatic crimefighter Billy the Cat. Unlike his Beano equivalent, Barry is incompetent, hopelessly uncoordinated, and is immediately recognised despite his \\"cat-suit\\" disguise. The final panel shows him in hospital, suffering from multiple injuries, being told that he has acted \\"very foolishly\\". * Bart Conrad ‚Äì a store detective who takes his job far too seriously. * Baxter Basics ‚Äì an extremely amoral and sexually deviant Conservative (and later Labour) MP who first appeared at around the same time as John Major's Back to Basics campaign, and a transparent statement on the hypocrisy of politicians. Drawn by Simon Thorp.\\"Who farted? British comic art\\". Tate Modern, 1 May 2010. Retrieved 15 March 2014 * Becky Thump ‚Äì a girl from the North of England who hates southerners so much she even assaults a supermarket delivery man for bringing her southern fried chicken. * Beeny of the Lamp ‚Äì An Aladdin parody in which Sarah Beeny comes out of a magic lamp to help a young couple wishing for advice on buying a property. * Ben and the SpaceWalrus ‚Äì a one-off strip centred on a fat kid named Ben who finds a SpaceWalrus and eats his dog Bunny. * Bert Midler, Biddy-Fiddler ‚Äì a pervert with a fetish for very elderly women. After he finally gets a date with a 92-year-old, he's disappointed to be told that she has died; only to cheer up again when he's invited to her funeral with all her friends of similar age. * Bertie Blunt (His Parrot's A Cunt) ‚Äì a boy who owns an extremely violent, foul mouthed parrot that insults everyone and encourages him to commit suicide. When the parrot kills Bertie's grandmother, who leaves them all her money, Bertie fights back by spending his inheritance on a microwave oven which he then uses to cook the parrot alive. Chris Donald, creator of Viz, has said that in the early days of the magazine he would not permit the \\"c word\\" to be used, until an outside artist (Sean Agnew) sent him this strip which he found to be so good he decided to use it anyway. * Biffa Bacon ‚Äì Biffa (shortened from Bifferidge) and his family ‚Äì Mutha and Fatha (real names Vermintrude (n√©e Haystacks) and Billy or Basha Bacon) ‚Äì hail from the Tyneside region of North East England and speak in the Geordie dialect. Biffa is constantly subjected to abuse by his parents ‚Äì even being kicked in the groin by both of them. Biffa is a visual parody of the character Bully Beef from The Dandy. His mother, who is rough-looking and masculine, bears a striking resemblance to Desperate Dan. The characters were allegedly inspired by a real family observed by Viz editor Chris Donald in Newcastle upon Tyne city centre, where the son began an unprovoked assault on another boy; the parents, rather than intervening, began shouting encouragement to their child. As soon as it appeared the victim of the assault was able to defend himself, the father joined in the attack that only ceased when police officers intervened. Some characters who have extended the Bacon family include Biffa's new baby brother Basha and a dog called Knacka (a pun on Dennis The Menace's dog Gnasher and the slang word \\"knacker\\"), Biffa's uncle Dekka, Biffa's grandfather (on his father's side) who is bald, and also Biffa's grandma. * Big Fuckin' Dave ‚Äì a big, burly and mentally unstable man with his name often tattooed across his forehead, sometimes back-to-front, who beats people up for being 'queeahs' because he believes they're only drinking a half-pint of beer, not drinking the full ten pints before having a slash or smoking less than full-strength cigarettes. Usually egged on by his much smaller, trouble-making friend. Has been part of other strips, notably Sid the Sexist. * Big Jobs ‚Äì a one-off strip in which Steve Jobs unveils the iPoo, a portable toilet which he demonstrates by defecating and vomiting into it. It is revealed that the waste is sent to another dimension (rendered, unusually for Viz, in full colour) where it is eaten by the inhabitants who don't care where it comes from since it's free. * Big Vern ‚Äì an East End gangster. Almost every strip follows the same story, in which Vern and his friend Ernie will begin an ordinary activity but with Vern convinced they're actually committing a criminal 'job', believing Ernie's protests that they aren't is just a cover story. At some point, a person will make an innocent remark which makes Vern shoot the person in the head believing he's the police (while shouting something along the lines of \\"No bastard copper's gonna take me alive!\\" or \\"Get dahn, Ernie, he's going for his piece!\\") before then shooting Ernie (sometimes believing Ernie 'grassed' him up, while other times doing it to save him from prison) and finally himself. The shootings are always shown in an extremely graphic fashion, but despite this both are always resurrected for the next issue. Vern's second name is Dakin, a reference to the notably violent 1971 British crime thriller Villain, whose anti-hero (played by Richard Burton) is named Vic Dakin. * Bicycle Bellend ‚Äì a man on a bicycle berating drivers for 'showing him disrespect' even though he is actually the dangerous road user (often not looking and causing accidents, and at one point he rides the wrong way up a one-way street), getting his comeuppance when he tells off a burly driver who subsequently beats him up. * Billy Bloater ‚Äì an extremely fat and greedy schoolboy whose gut is so vast that it distorts gravity and pulls stray bank notes into his reach, allowing him to indulge in an 'all you can eat' feast which increases his density until he effectively becomes a black hole and the artist realises that he doesn't know how to complete the strip. * Billy Bottom and his Zany Toilet Pranks ‚Äì a literal toilet humour strip, based around a man and his attempts to defecate whilst various factors and circumstances conspire to prevent him from doing so. The first strip carried a spoof certificate of the type given to films by the BBFC, classifying the strip as \\"puerile\\". One of the latest has him as a caveman who is caught by the incoming Ice-Age, and is frozen solid for two million years. He is eventually freed by two archaeologists but the stink is so atrocious that he advises them 'I'd leave it for ten minutes if i were you!' Conceived by Tom Bambridge. * Billy Bound (It's Always His Round) ‚Äì a man whose friends constantly trick him into offering to buy the next round of drinks. * Billy Britain ‚Äì a right-wing ultra-nationalist resembling Enoch Powell who appeared in two very early strips. Chris Donald considers him an early prototype of Major Misunderstanding. He also made a one-off reappearance in the September 2002 issue satirising the issue of asylum seekers, where after he spends the strip making several futile attempts to round up illegal immigrants, the local authorities turn his home into a detention centre for refugees. * Billy Bumble Beard - A strip about a man who has a beard of bees. * Billy the Fish ‚Äì half man, half fish, he is a star footballer despite being drawn with no legs (he does apparently own a pair of football boots, but it is not clear why). The strip is a satire of, or homage to, the popular football comics of the 1960s and 1970s such as Roy of the Rovers, and also satirises topical football incidents. Starred in a spinoff cartoon, voiced by Harry Enfield. According to Viz cartoonist Graham Dury, \\"half the readers thought [the strip] was shit, and the other half thought it was really shit.\\" Undaunted, Viz cheerfully called one instalment \\"Billy the Shit\\". * Billy No-Mates ‚Äì a miserable, asocial teenage boy who spends most of his time alone in his dark room playing video games. If anyone disturbs him he becomes extremely irritated. He also has an obsession with masturbating, collecting large numbers of pornographic magazines and calling sex hotlines. * Billy Quiz ‚Äì a man who constantly acts like a game show host in everyday situations. * Bipolar Bear ‚Äì a polar bear who suffers from severe bipolar disorder. * Biscuits Alive! ‚Äì some biscuits that mysteriously come to life to help their boy owner out of some trivial problem. * Black Bag ‚Äì \\"The faithful border bin liner\\". A black bin liner which lives the exciting life of a sheepdog; a parody of The Dandy's Black Bob and the anthropomorphism of animals. Black Bag was drawn by Graham Murdoch, under the pen name of Snoddy (his cat). Black Bag rescued Brotherhood of Man from a well. * Bo and Luke Brummell ‚Äì A parody of The Dukes of Hazzard in which the two main characters are Regency-era dandies. * Bodley Basin ‚Äì \\"He's On The Square\\". The adventures of a \\"strict Freemason\\". This one-off strip ended with the apparent murder of the cartoonist. * The Bottom Inspectors ‚Äì based on the Traffic Wardens of Newcastle. Simon Donald autobiography \\"Him Off The Viz\\" (2015) p163 and p158-9 The Bottom Inspectors were also influenced by a single editorial comment made by John Brown, the original publisher of Viz Comic: \\"The only editorial comment I ever made\\", explains Brown, \\"was in the early days, when I told Chris that I thought one issue was particularly 'bottomy'. He didn't say much at the time, but The Bottom Inspectors appeared for the first time in the next issue.\\" * Boy Scouse ‚Äì a gang of delinquent schoolboys from Liverpool who earn Boy Scout badges for mugging pensioners, spraying graffiti and other such antisocial activities. MP Louise Ellman complained that it set a bad example and petitioned to have it banned. * Brian Cunt ‚Äì a representative from a gas supply company, who, when called out to a suspected gas leak, does nothing to help and instead pressures the customer to buy a new central heating system they don't need (resulting in the house blowing up). * The Broon Windsors - a parody of the Royal Family in the style of The Broons * Brown Bottle ‚Äì a reporter (sometimes a bank clerk) who thinks he becomes a superhero when he is drunk on Newcastle Brown Ale. In reality, all that happens is that he becomes viciously drunk and passes out, but the twist in the story is that he manages to save the day anyway, by sheer accident. The character is based on Davey Graham, a musician friend of Chris Donald's, who made a similar transformation under the influence.Rude Kids: The Inside Story Of Viz Brown Bottle's enemy Ciderwoman (a \\"supervillain\\" who gets her powers from drinking cider) appeared in this strip and her own occasional strips in the magazine. * Brucey's Magic Flying Carpet ‚Äì A strip about Bruce Forsyth who goes around on his magic flying carpet helping some guy with his thatched cottage roof. * Buffalo Jill ‚Äì a strip narrated in the story of 1950s-60s girls' comics, where a typical heroine from such comics (politely spoken and pony-loving) becomes a stagecoach robber in the Wild West, earning a vicious gang's respect by gorily shooting several people in the head. * Busted ‚Äì who, until they disbanded in 2005, occasionally appeared in strips (as well as spoof interviews and other features in the magazine) portraying them as pyromaniacs/arsonists who would set anything on fire \\"for a laugh\\". James Bourne would always be referred to by the wrong name, making fun of his status as the \\"least famous\\" of the group. * Buster Gonad and his Unfeasibly Large Testicles ‚Äì a boy who somehow manages to always solve people's problems with his ridiculously large testicles. * Camberwick Greggs ‚Äì a very bleak parody of Camberwick Green, where Mickey Murphy the baker is driven out of business after a branch of Greggs opens across the road. * Calvin and the Chipmunks ‚Äì A strip featuring John Calvin and some mischievous chipmunks who get him into trouble with King Henry VIII. * Captain Morgan and his Hammond Organ ‚Äì a pirate who sails round the Caribbean inviting people to sing along with him as he plays a Hammond organ. His character was cut when legal action was threatened over the copyright of some of the songs; according to creator Chris Donald in his book, he did not think that making the character sing royalty-free hymns or nursery rhymes would have quite the same comedic effect. * Captain Captured ‚Äì the man who's constantly caught. At the start of each strip, Captain Captured would get captured in a mysterious Bond villain-like fashion. He would then escape only to get captured again, and again, and again... * Captain Magnetic ‚Äì A strip about a man who claims to be a superhero with magnetic powers, only to find out his powers are useless. * Captain Oats ‚Äì a one-off strip lampooning the real Antarctic explorer Captain Lawrence Oates. An explorer obsessed with pornography and masturbation, he is depicted skiing across the icy wastes, dragging a wardrobe upon which is hidden his stash of pornographic magazines. However, his efforts to masturbate are continually frustrated by the presence of his companions. * Charitable Chester ‚Äì an unintelligent boy who constantly tries to raise money for charity, but either fails or raises very little, leaving his father (who has to foot the bill for either damages to a dairy or catering for a pop concert) seriously out of pocket. * Cilla Blackbeard ‚Äì a strip portraying Cilla Black as a vicious pirate captain who evades and defeats the Royal Navy, led by Admiral Noel Edmonds and his crew of rival TV presenters. * Colin the Amiable Crocodile ‚Äì strips centred on a small crocodile named Colin. In one strip he was shot by a birdwatcher because he said \\"hello\\" to the man. The character also appeared later on front covers of other issues, such as with a skinhead who tells people to buy the comic or he shoots the croc. * Champion the Wonder Arse ‚Äì Young Chip McCain had befriended a magnificent wild hairy arse named Champion, which roamed the plains around the little town of Windy Creek in Arizona. * Chester Thing ‚Äì The comic character with no attribute. * Christ on a Bender ‚Äì a strip which depicts Jesus as a family man who keeps trying to escape the house to get \\"crucified\\" with his friends but is thwarted at every turn by his wife forcing him to stay home with her and look after their children. * Christ on a Bike ‚Äì a strip which depicts Jesus's life riding a magical bicycle. Pontius Pilate has him crucified due to envy since Pilate only has a girl's bike. * Cockney Wanker ‚Äì a swaggering, bigoted Londoner who speaks in rhyming slang. The character is based on actor Mike Reid. He wears lots of cheap gold jewellery or Argos bling and East End gangster dark glasses, and is often seen smoking a cigar. Wanker's speciality is the buying and selling of cars, often buying one, selling it back to the same person at the same price and then waving his wad of cash declaring the transaction to have been \\"a nice little earner\\". His name, as it contains an obscenity, is \\"spoonerised\\" whenever featured on the front page of an issue of Viz, as it would be easily read by children who are otherwise not entitled to buy the magazine. Hence he becomes \\"Wockney Canker\\". * Cop Her Knickers ‚Äì an elderly woman's dealings with a gang of policemen who are constantly, and inexplicably, trying to steal her underwear. * Copper Kettle ‚Äì quoted as \\"The PC who loves his PG\\" (PG meaning tea brand PG Tips), the strip follows the life of the policeman and his futile attempts to obtain some tea ‚Äì his favourite beverage ‚Äì while on his beat. * Crap Jokes ‚Äì a diverse range of verbal and visual puns or one-liners, usually deliberately corny or old- fashioned. The best known of the Crap Jokes are seemingly endless \\"Doctor, Doctor\\" gags, with the reader's sympathy drawn to the endlessly hapless straight man Doctor. * Crawford Crayon ‚Äì He's Quick On The Sketch ‚Äì a one-off story about a brilliant and mischievous quick-sketch artist, whose 'harmless fun' leads to the death of the hapless Bully Smith. * The Critics ‚Äì pretentious and shallow high-culture critics who lampoon the perceived elitism of the \\"chattering classes\\". They work for The Sunday Chronicle, though they have done freelance work with the BBC and Channel 4, writing elitist and sometimes sycophantic articles on contemporary art. The artists they admire are all fictional, but are clearly inspired by real-life artists such as Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin. A frequent plot device involves Natasha and Crispin mistaking some everyday object ‚Äì like a fire extinguisher, puddle of vomit or even some public toilets ‚Äì as a piece of modern art. In other episodes, they don't grasp the concept of art at all. They once received a booby prize at the Critics' Awards for bringing the reputation of critics into disrepute for writing a review that was not only positive, but actually made sense. * Daley Starr ‚Äì a schoolboy aspiring to be a journalist, who turns his family's and classmates' misfortunes into exaggerated \\"scoops\\". His name is a play on the Daily Star tabloid newspaper. * Danny's District Council ‚Äì a one- off story parodying General Jumbo of The Beano, in which a young boy commands his own electronic radio-controlled district council. The tiny robotic council workers are all lazy, corrupt and incompetent and eventually switch their allegiance to the villains. The comic occasionally features other parodies of General Jumbo, including \\"Jimbo Jumbo's Robo Jobos\\", \\"Oliver's Army\\" and \\"Drill-Sergeant Jumbo\\". * Darren Dice ‚Äì a young man who is obsessed with gambling. Sadly, he often chooses to gamble with the wrong crowd. The character is allegedly based on, and bears a remarkable resemblance to, retired Scottish footballer Darren Jackson. Jackson spent a couple of seasons at Newcastle United in the late 1980s and became a familiar face in bookmakers' shops in the city. * D.C. Thompson The Humourless Scottish Git ‚Äì created in retaliation after D. C. Thomson & Co. Ltd threatened legal action over a variety of Viz spoofs based on characters from The Beano and The Dandy, including Biffa Bacon, Black Bag, \\"Roger the Lodger\\", \\"Wanker Watson\\", \\"Arsehole Kate\\" and many more. The title character was portrayed as a miserly stereotypical Scotsman (complete with tam o‚Äôshanter, kilt and sporran) who goes about looking for breaches of copyright he can report, such as threatening to sue a woman who calls her son Dennis a \\"menace\\" in his earshot, and demanding that a pet shop owner remove an advertisement for \\"Three Bears for the Price of One\\" from the shop window. Eventually, he becomes so enraged that he urinates in his kilt.https://78.media.tumblr.com/8414271a5d71cf9c4d3ad62b12f019f4/tumblr_n0ooovQoLj1s8su8go1_1280.jpg Not to be outdone, The Dandy responded by resurrecting an old strip The Jocks and the Geordies ‚Äì representing the Scottish-based D.C. Thomson and Newcastle upon Tyne-based Viz. In the strip, the rival gangs of schoolboys are asked to produce a comic. The Jocks' comic is better, of course, but the underhand Geordies decide to copy them. Viz responded in kind by parodying Korky the Cat as \\"Corky the Twat\\" in the next issue. * Denis Helium ‚Äì a boy who believes he is as light as a feather, but is in fact quite obese. * Desert Island Desk ‚Äì a dialogue-free strip about an office desk which has been marooned on a desert island; the title refers to Desert Island Discs and the Topper comic story Desert Island Dick. * Desert Island Teacher ‚Äì a teacher stranded on a windswept rock. He has decided that \\"once a teacher, always a teacher\\", and inflicts monotonous lectures on the seagulls and molluscs. A major feature of the strip is that he never actually says anything of any academic value, but instead spends all his time saying things like \\"Face the front\\" and \\"I will not start until I have absolute quiet\\". He is rescued by a navy search and rescue team, only to admonish them as if they were a delinquent pupil, saying: \\"You think you're so clever, being able to fly a helicopter, but it's not going to help you in the real world.\\" The rescue crew throw him off the helicopter for insulting them. * Desperately Unfunny Dan ‚Äì parody of barrel- chested Desperate Dan who tries too hard to amuse people with his superhuman feats of strength. * Dickie Beasley ‚Äì a schoolboy who wants to be an ad executive. His attempts to advertise or improve something menial (e.g. a church jumble sale) and fails because he puts too much thought and planning into it (treating as something more complex). * Doctor Poo ‚Äì a spoof of Doctor Who depicting the title character, utterly desperate to move his bowels, unable to find a toilet in the whole of space‚Äìtime. He eventually relieves himself in Davros's \\"private shitehouse\\" on the planet Skaro.https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CVpK352m5q8/UpBYvzMVYFI/AAAAAAAACBs/iK7RYPDmZws/s1600/doctor+poo+scan.jpg * Doctor Poolittle ‚Äì a spoof of Doctor Dolittle depicting the title character severely constipated and attempting to learn how to defecate from zoo animals. After a lion roars at him, he soils his trousers.http://viz.co.uk/wp- content/uploads/2014/11/080-34-doctorpoolittle.jpg * Doctor Sex ‚Äì \\"He has the power of all sex.\\" * Drill-Sergeant Jumbo ‚Äì one of several parodies of \\"General Jumbo\\" of The Beano. Young Jumbo Williams commands his own miniature platoon of electronic soldiers, but is so busy verbally abusing them that he ignores all requests for help from the emergency services. * Dom and Jerry ‚Äì a parody of Tom and Jerry where a BDSM-obsessed cat is trying to catch the mouse to perform his twisted sexual acts on it. * Driving David Beckham or Driving Mister David ‚Äì a spoof of Beezer and (later) Beano comic strip \\"The Numskulls\\" in which we see the inner thought processes ‚Äì or lack thereof ‚Äì of David Beckham. The title is based on the film Driving Miss Daisy. *Drum Miner ‚Äì a drummer who can only play in confined spaces, made redundant by the closure of his local coal mine. He attempts to find work, but fails due to his niche abilities and finally commits suicide by jumping off his bass drum with a noose around his neck. Tragically, an eccentric millionaire appears minutes later looking to offer permanent employment to someone who can play drums inside his cupboard. A spoof of the films of Ken Loach. * Drunken Bakers ‚Äì two alcoholic bakers who, because of their affliction, hardly ever manage to bake anything, and if they actually do it is almost always spoiled by one of them vomiting over it. Their shop is run down, and is often burnt down due to a left-on stove, and has few customers; the pair sometimes look back to more prosperous, happier times, but are always brought back to their dismal present-day reality. * Eight Ace ‚Äì an alcoholic who drinks \\"Ace\\" beer (eight cans for ¬£1.49) and struggles to stay on the right side of his wife and many children as a consequence, not being allowed to live in the house, and ending up in a shed in the front garden. Many of the strips involve Ace being entrusted with or somehow managing to acquire exactly ¬£1.49 which he inevitably uses to buy \\"Eight Ace\\". His real name has been mentioned as \\"Octavius Federidge Tinsworthy Ace\\", the \\"Federidge\\" in his name being derived from the now-defunct Federation Brewery which brewed \\"Ace\\" lager, and \\"Octavius\\" being derived from octo, Latin for \\"eight\\". The 'Tinsworthy' speaks for itself. * Eight Ball Joe ‚Äì An early strip from the early 1980s where the titular character is portrayed with no intelligence. * Elton John's... ‚Äì a series of strips have the pop star portrayed as a petty scamster. The strips typically open with John engaged in a stereotypical celebrity activity like launching a new album, being interviewed for a celebrity magazine, or partying with fellow A-listers. But they soon descend into the surreal when, despite his enormous wealth and fame, John embarks on a small-scale con to make trivial amounts of cash. Scams include Baccy Run, Dole Fiddle, Hooky Videos, Electrical Goods Scam, Bandit Beater, Lottery Syndicate Diddle (consisting of himself, Bono, Phil Collins and Paul McCartney), Roofing Racket, Marked Note Con, Window Cleaning Scam and Compen Con. At the end of each strip John, having been rumbled through bad luck or incompetence, is normally shown to have been beaten at his own game by other celebrities, mostly his \\"enemies\\", e.g. David Bowie, The Bee Gees, Rod Stewart or \\"the surviving members of Queen\\", who are shown launching more successful small-scale scams of their own, often singing iconic lines from their own songs. * Embarrassing Wife ‚Äì One-off quarter-page strip featuring a two-faced husband attending a party with his wife. Just as they ring the bell the husband warns the wife 'not to do anything stupid'. He then goes on to behave disgustingly, drinking to excess, slobbering over another female party-goer, vomiting in the flowers, bashing the host and finally ending up with his trousers around his ankles, dead drunk, and with the wife carefully saying (probably in a whisper) 'I think maybe its time we made tracks dear.' He responds, 'DO you!' In the car back home he berates her: 'I hope you're satisfied! You made me look like a right fool back there!' * Eminemis The Menace ‚Äì starred in a one-off strip, a cross between Eminem and Dennis the Menace. * Eric Daft ‚Äì \\"His IQ is less than 2\\" ‚Äì An early Terry Fuckwitt prototype. F‚ÄìJ * Farmer Palmer ‚Äì a paranoid, money-grabbing farmer with an inbred son whose catch phrase is \\"Get orf moi laaaand!\\". He frequently berates and physically threatens (usually with a double-barrelled shotgun) innocent members of the public for encroaching on his property, yet he hypocritically treats the countryside with complete disdain. He has a habit of shooting every dog he sees with a shotgun, claiming \\"'Ee wuz worrying moi sheep.\\" or words to that effect. In one extreme example, the dog's owner claimed his dog was on public property and thus well within its right to be there. Farmer Palmer then had his son Jethro transport the dog to his own farm with a tractor, to get an excuse to shoot it. Farmer Palmer and Jethro later appear in an episode of The Fat Slags animated series. Often he will go out of his way to make someone's life miserable. Twice he has hosted a huge music festival just like Frank Yasker who hosted the original Woodstock, once in a full two-page feature, which as you look at it, it becomes obvious that it is nothing but a money-grabbing venture, and in the other he introduces Snoop Dogg as the star, only to go backstage and grab his gun. As Snoop is introducing his first song, Palmer shoots him with the usual phrase \\"E were worrying moi shizzles!\\" Then he stands in the middle of the stage and thunders to the enormous but now silent crowd, \\"Now Get Orf Moi Laaand!\\" * Farting Dilemmas with Archie McBlarter ‚Äì a man who, as the title suggests, suffers from extreme flatulence that causes those around him to become sick or unconscious. He is his own worst enemy, as he is very fond of extremely flatulence-producing food, such as Scotch Eggs, Vindaloo, Heavy Oatmeal Stout, etc. * Father McFiddly ‚Äì \\"He Loves Diddling Kiddies\\" - about the antics of a priest trying to peek up the altar-boys' cassocks, etc. A skit on the Catholic sex abuse cases scandal. * The Fat Slags ‚Äì two enormous sluttish women living in Mansfield, San (Sandra Burke) and Tray (Tracey Tunstall), with huge appetites for both sex and food. Starred in a spinoff cartoon and a live-action movie. * Fat Sod ‚Äì a one-off greedy character who steals a large pie from the windowsill of one Farmer Palmer (possibly the same character described above, despite physical dissimilarity), only to be ruthlessly shot dead and baked in a pie by Palmer, who hides inside the false pie initially stolen to do so. * Father Christmas ‚Äì a man so obsessed with Christmas he believes that it is the festive season in the middle of August. * Fatty and Skinny, Susannah and Trinny ‚Äì A strip portraying Susannah Constantine and Trinny Woodall as school bullies who ridicule classmates for their unfashionable clothes, only to end each cartoon forced to wear a horrendously uncomfortable outfit for detention or gym class. This strip prompted legal action from Woodall and Constantine themselves. * Feet and Two Reg ‚Äì Two neighbours (who as the title suggests are called Reg) who are due to enter a competition where their diseased feet are to be judged where one of them trying to ruin the other's chances by curing his bad feet, but failing. * Felix and his Amazing Underpants ‚Äì a boy with underpants which he believes have amazing powers. They are in fact completely ordinary, albeit being a bizarrely large size. Occasionally, he manages to do good deeds with his underwear in order to help out someone in need, for example, using his underpants as a container for a French salesman's onions. The comic strip was created by editor Chris Donald, but is now drawn by Lew Stringer. * Ferdinand the Foodie ‚Äì a self-proclaimed culinary expert and restaurant critic. * Finbarr Saunders and his double entendres ‚Äì a boy with a good ear for homophones. The strip almost always revolves around his liaisons with his neighbour, Mr Gimlet, whose manner of speech is always interpreted by Finbarr as graphically sexual in nature (in fact, it is deliberately scripted this way), usually when Gimlet is reminiscing about everyday situations with Saunders' mother. However, at the end of each strip, Mr Gimlet and Finbarr's mother invariably do end up having sex and make blatantly obvious verbal references to their doing so, but Finbarr interprets these as being nothing untoward. Finbarr's creator, Simon Thorp, described the character as a cross between a small boy and Sid Boggle (Sid James) from Carry On Camping. He is sometimes visited by his mother's Russian friend, Sergei, whose English pronunciation is very bad, which results in his sentences being corrupted in often lewd ways (for instance, \\"Your mother wants me to fetch her aerosol\\" becomes \\"Your mother wants me to felch her arsehole\\"). * Fixed Odds Betty ‚Äì a sombre one-off strip depicting a woman selling her possessions and emptying her bank account to buy her grandson a bike for his birthday, only to end up being waylaid by his mother and spending it all at a fixed-odds betting machine in a bookmakers while the boy waits outside in the rain. This strip guest-starred the main character from fellow Viz strip \\"We ...\\" * Flash Harry ‚Äì a man who is constantly trying to indecently expose himself to women but regularly fails. * Foodie Bollocks ‚Äì a man who goes into a fish and chip shop or bakery and asks several annoying questions about the food as if he's ordering from a Michelin-starred restaurant. One strip has him ordering an ice-cream from an ice cream van wanting to know about the story of all the ingredients and getting punched in the face by the man behind the queue as he is taking ages to decide. *The Folkie - a man who tends to sing everything like a folk song annoying everybody (even other folk singers), even having an appearance of a folk singer (spoting a beard, wearing clogs and a thick woollen jumper). * Foul-Mouthed Super-Obese Mobility Scooter Woman ‚Äì a lazy, benefit-dependent woman who blames her total lack of work ethic on her morbid obesity; which requires her to use a mobility scooter. * Friar Fuck ‚Äì a monk with Tourette's syndrome. * Frankenstein's Cock ‚Äì a parody of Frankenstein in which the scientist has created a giant, sentient penis which comes to life and is hunted through the town by a torch-wielding mob. Prompted follow-ups and sequels in the comic including \\"Frankenstein's Turd\\" and \\"Frankenstein's Cock Must Be Destroyed\\". * Frankie Feel - an early strip featuring a man who is always grabbing women's breasts. * Fru T. Bunn ‚Äì a \\"Master Baker\\" who makes his own sex dolls out of gingerbread and then attempts to have sex with them. * Garry and Barry the Identical Twins ‚Äì a boy convinced that a tree in his garden is actually his identical twin brother. * George Best is a Cinema Pest ‚Äì a one-off strip featuring George Best prematurely disclosing the final twists of notable movies such as The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects to incensed cinema goers. * George Bestial ‚Äì a George Best lookalike who, as his name implies, enjoys committing bestiality. After the death of the real Best, the strip was redesigned so that it became longer (full-page), the title character looks less like Best, and his zoophilia is merely the most obvious symptom of his clearly very disturbed mind. * Gilbert Ratchet ‚Äì a boy who can invent anything, usually to solve people's bizarre \\"problems\\" as he comes across them. However, his inventions invariably cause far more problems of their own. Usually the entire premise of the strip turns out to be a highly contrived misunderstanding. Gilbert's creator, Davey Jones, describes the character as \\"like (the Dandy's) Screwy Driver‚Äîonly with more genital mutilation of vicars\\". * Gin Damon ‚Äì A man who is obsessed with gin yet fails to realise how much he has drunk. * God, You're Embarrassing ‚Äì A strip which depicts God, embarrassing his son, Jesus in front of his disciples. * Goldfish Boy ‚Äì a schoolboy who lives in a goldfish bowl and is raised by the Reverend Brown. * Gordon's Grandad ‚Äì one-off strip about a boy who believes his perfectly ordinary grandfather has magical powers. The strip ends with the death of the grandfather, devastating Gordon who believes that Grandad was about to build him a time machine. * Granny Smith - an old woman who has a habit of murdering people. * Grassy Knollington ‚Äì a schoolboy conspiracy theorist who would spend every strip putting together and explaining complicated and outlandish theories behind certain events (such as 9/11 and the death of Princess Diana) often to the exasperation of his friends. Typically at the end of every strip it would be revealed that Grassy was actually correct. His name is a pun based on the 'Grassy Knoll' where it is said a gunman was hiding who shot JFK. * The Green Grass ‚Äì a one-off, quarter- page strip where Orville the Duck is caught and destroyed by a Government respond unit during a bird flu epidemic after being betrayed by Cuddles the Monkey. * Harold and Fred - they make ladies dead! ‚Äì A one-off strip in which serial killers Harold Shipman and Fred West compete to be the first to murder a new female neighbour; only to discover that she is actually Ed Gein wearing the skin of one of his victims. This strip created controversy in the media, including complaints from the families of some of Shipman's victims. * Helpful Herbert ‚Äì A boy whose good deeds always land him in big trouble. * Hector the collector and his metal detector ‚Äì strips about a boy named Hector who finds big and small things with his metal detector. In one strip he found a key that according to a passing rich man opened up a chest with gold inside and gave him ¬£500. The character later returned in the 30th edition comic. * Hell Below Zero ‚Äì One-off strip depicting a man on a zero-hours contract called in by his boss first thing in the morning and made to wait around all day while only being paid for thirty-seven minutes work. This same concept was used as an episode of 'We...' (which see). * Hen Cabin ‚Äì A takeaway run by two scruffy, dishonest men who cut corners by making their takeaways from chicken declared unfit for consumption or using easily obtained birds (such as pigeons or in one episode, seagulls!) instead of chicken. Their product is disgustingly unpalatable but they keep doggedly on making it! Often they go out of their way to make their opposite numbers (on the same street) to appear worse than themselves. Mostly they fail. * Honour Bound ‚Äì A strip about a Samurai trying to defacate. * Hugh Phemism ‚Äì He is unable to communicate in anything other than circumlocutory language, leading to predictable misunderstandings. * Hubble and Bubble - \\"They're looking for trouble\\". This strip portrays two policemen, one appearing normal and the other a caricature of a pig. They are out to make as much trouble as possible, even concocting situations for their own 'entertainment'. One episode has an elderly lady bewailing her cat up a tree. H & B come on the scene and immediately accuse her of using the tree ('This big lump of wood') to attack them. Both woman and cat finally are murdered, and the two 'cover their badges' and leave. * Incontinent Boxing Tortoise Hero ‚Äì a senile old man who believes he is a superhero with tortoise- themed powers. In reality he fails to defeat a gang of robbers and wets himself again. * Il Duce, Old Duce ‚Äì A strip featuring Benito Mussolini who wants the people of the town to bow down to his fascist dictatorship, but his hippie father keeps ruining his day. * Ivan Jelical ‚Äì an evangelistic fundamentalist Christian whose proselytising is spectacularly unsuccessful. He is only ever happy when he is God-bothering, \\"comforting\\" grieving widows with descriptions of their husbands' (supposed) sufferings in Hell, and getting himself beaten-up in the process. On one occasion, after failing to convert a single person all day he hung himself (though this didn't stop him reappearing alive in a new strip a few months later). He (and his fellow evangelists) are often portrayed with 'spinning' eyes, a display of their unawareness of the real world. * Ivor the Skiver ‚Äì \\"His dad's a bad driver\\". One-off strip in which a boy begs his father for a lift as he is too lazy to walk to school. Due to Ivor's dad having poor road sense, they are involved in a crash and end up seriously injured in the hospital, where they are reminded that it was Saturday and Ivor didn't have to go to school anyway. * Jack Black and his dog Silver ‚Äì a young amateur detective staying with his Aunt Meg on an eternal school holiday. Often gets well-meaning people, who have done nothing wrong, arrested (or worse) on a minor technicality or obscure law for his own benefit, often with another awful crime being committed right under his nose which he completely fails to notice. The first strip was apparently \\"traced by Chris Donald\\", according to fellow Viz cartoonist Davey Jones, \\"out of an old copy of Whizzer and Chips\\". As the strip has progressed, Jack has been increasingly portrayed as a racist and a xenophobe among other major faults. Jack's adventures are regularly drawn in the style of other comics (such as Tintin or Asterix), taking place in other countries (such as a manga-style strip relocating the action to Tokyo) and even in different time periods (including the Victorian era, the Future Space Era and the Stone Age). * Jack in the Box ‚Äì A strip about the titular character who sets about doing cardboard box related pranks, only to be involved in a car accident. * Jasper the Gasper ‚Äì A homeless man who is desperate for a cigarette. * Jamie Bond ‚Äì A child parody of James Bond. Rather than go with the plot that Jamie is just a regular child who is delusional about his secret agent alter ego and that his next door neighbour is not really a global villain out for world domination. The latter is indeed revealed to be one, whose plot Jamie foils and then makes his escape with the story's Bond girl. * Jellyhead ‚Äì The girl with no brain. A one-off superhero parody about a girl born with lime jelly instead of a brain. Jellyhead spends her entire time in this story in a catatonic state, yet still manages to foil an armed robbery. The one-off strip was the work of Charlie Higson. * The Adventures of Jeremy Clarkson, the Petrolhead Motormouth ‚Äì One- off strip featuring former Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson talking extensively about cars to an uninterested Big Issue salesman. * Jeremy Futcher - His Dad's a Butcher ‚Äì - A strip about the titular boy who goes around solving problems with his father's select cuts of meat, only to have him being butchered. * Jimmy Hill ‚Äì The bespectacled and bearded television presenter. He has become something of a cult following as his caricature has turned up in all shapes and sizes, hiding in many of the strips, and often spotted by write-ins, claiming money for discovering him. * Joe Blogs ‚Äì a teenager trying, and spectacularly failing, to become famous from his online blog. * Joe Robinson Crusoe ‚Äì a thinly disguised parody of flamboyant Newcastle pub and nightclub operator Joe Robertson. * John Logie-Baird ‚Äì A strip about the Scottish inventor who makes a machine that spouts out faeces, and his rival from next door, the Italian inventor known as Guglieimo Marconi is envious about it, so he tries to outdo the Scottish inventor by making a machine that spouts out testicles. The strip ends with the two surprised by the English inventor, Tim Berners-Lee and his machine that spouts out male and female reproductive systems. * Johnny Fartpants ‚Äì a boy afflicted with extreme flatulence. Tagline: There's always a commotion in his trousers. He suffers from extreme, excessive flatulence which is not only offensive to the nose and ears, but destructive to those around him. His gaseous emissions have been known to destroy houses and other hard-surfaced articles, as well as injure people. He is always apologetic, and constantly reminds people that his colonic expulsions are beyond his control - despite his insistence on \\"keeping to a strict pump diet\\", which often includes beans and \\"cabbage water\\". In Viz 166 (June/July 2007), Johnny was forced by his father to attend a lecture on global warming, presented by none other than Al Gore, so that he would learn about the impact his farting was having on the environment. When Johnny intentionally farted during the applause for Gore (so that nobody would hear it), the former Vice President became violently ill, causing Johnny to observe that Gore was now \\"greener\\" than his environmental message. * Jump Jet Fanny and her Hawker-Siddeley Twat ‚Äì A woman who can perform VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) with her vagina. Other strips using the same premise included \\"Hawker Siddeley Harriet\\" and \\"Colin Concorde Cock\\". * Junior Cop - a boy who acts like a policeman, informing a mother that her son has died (annoying her as it's not true, as her son is watching TV in the other room) and battering a confession out of his own mother (with the support of his father who is actually a policeman himself). * Just Williams ‚Äì a parody of the Just William stories by Richmal Crompton, with Archbishop Rowan Williams in the place of Crompton's boy-hero. Williams steals buns from the kitchen and allows his pet mice to escape during a General Synod meeting, whilst maintaining a William- esque self-justificatory monologue. K‚ÄìO * Kewl Chix ‚Äì shallow, vacuous and materialistic teenage girls who only care about their social life. Initially presented as bimbo/dumb blonde caricatures but in recent years the strip has primarily served as a satire of social networking sites and text messaging. Often their observed lives have nothing to do with reality, which leads to considerable clashes with their surrounds. * Kid Politician ‚Äì a child who speaks and behaves like a politician (for example, producing dubious statistics to \\"prove\\" that he wasn't late for school.) * The Lager Lads ‚Äì somewhat like the Real Ale Twats, these are a group of clean-cut, upstanding beer aficionados who like lager more than anything. Inevitably, barmen tell them to \\"piss off\\" or urinate in their beer. The Lads never seem to notice there's anything wrong with their drinks after this happens, both highlighting the weak flavour of lager compared to other beer and showing the Lads up to be idiots. The strips were inspired by a series of advertisements for McEwan's lager, in which - Chris Donald noted - a group of smiling, happy young men drink copious amounts of lager but never \\"got pissed or glassed anybody\\". * Large Breasted Wet T-Shirt Pneumatic Drill Girl ‚Äì A masked superheroine, dressed for a wet T-shirt contest, who works at the roadside with a pneumatic drill and fights crime. * Last Tan&Go; in Powys ‚Äì Bleak one-off strip about a young woman who develops an addiction to indoor tanning and subsequently dies from skin cancer after her friends make fun of her pale appearance. The title is a pun on Last Tango in Paris. * Laurie Driver ‚Äì the schizophrenic long- distance driver of an articulated lorry, who murders female hitchhikers and dumps their bodies by the roadside. * Last-Minute Man ‚Äì One-off strip where a man, despite having months to prepare, doesn't start Christmas shopping until 3:45pm on Christmas Eve resulting in him giving his family presents that he bought in a local garage. * Lazy Disinterested 16 Year-Old Photo Shop Girl ‚Äì a teenage girl who works in a local photo supply shop. She has a very unenthusiastic attitude, and is unhelpful to her customers; preferring to chew lots of bubblegum and text on her mobile phone for hours on end. Similar strips have the \\"Lazy Disinterested 16-Year-Old\\" working in a supermarket, a shoe shop and a chip shop - the latter seeing her rather talk to a friend (possibly her boyfriend) than serve anyone, and being extremely slow and deliberately uninterested when she does serve someone. Her equally unhelpful counterparts are sometimes featured, including \\"Ugly Miserable Butch Bus Driver Lady\\" and \\"34-Year-Old Obsessive War Workshop Assistant\\" (an older man so obsessed with role-playing games that when a boy tries to buy two sets of figures from different sets, he will only sell one or the other, but not both as they \\"are from different scenarios\\"). * Lenny Left ‚Äì a one-off strip featuring a \\"radical\\" left-wing alternative comedian whose hackneyed \\"street theatre\\" routines about Thatcherism arouse complete disinterest from the public. Lenny eventually sells out, and the last frame of the strip shows him doing a sexist and homophobic stand-up routine in a Conservative club. * Little Big Daddy ‚Äì A schoolboy who thinks he is 1970s wrestler Big Daddy. * Little Old Man ‚Äì A young boy who acts like a stereotypical elderly man and at the end of the strip ends up being taken to a retirement home. He was introduced as the counterpart of Playtime Fontayne, but unlike Playtime, he has so far only been a one-off strip. * Little Plumber ‚Äì Spoof of Beano comic strip Little Plum, in which the American Indian is a jobbing plumber. * Lonely Sidney Sidebottom ‚Äì A one off strip from the early 1980s (also featured in The Big Hard One annual) about a single man who has difficulties talking to women. * Lord Shite and Nanny No-Dumps ‚Äì a one-off strip which draws upon the urban myth that the aristocracy do not poo. It's about an aristocrat who wishes to defecate \\"like common people\\" and his former nanny who is determined to stop him. * Lucky Frank ‚Äì A young boy who seems to seems to have bad luck turned into good luck. An earlier (and later revived) version of Spawny Get. * Luke O'Like - He is One ‚Äì A strip about the titular character who gets mistaken for someone else. * Lumberjack Veterinarian ‚Äì A lumberjack takes on the duty of making people's pets better, only to get fired for murdering them. * Luvvie Darling ‚Äì a melodramatic and self-important thespian who is always \\"Resting Between Jobs\\" (out of work), principally because he is completely talentless. He presents himself as an A-list actor but is only offered very minor (and ultimately humiliating) roles. Darling is depicted as an exaggerated parody of old-school British Shakespearian stage actors: pompous, bombastic, profligate and pretentious in his use of literary quotes, and habitually referring to famous, real-life actors in familiar terms (such as \\"Dear old Larry\\" for Sir Laurence Olivier). Darling's name is a pun on the insincere and over- affectionate terms, \\"luvvie\\" and \\"darling\\" that actors and actresses are stereotyped as employing with each other. Each Viz episode begins with Luvvie \\"resting between jobs\\" - a showbiz term for being out of work. His manager Louie is as useless as himself, drives (very badly) in a huge car, smokes a huge cigar, and drinks from a bottle marked \\"Eau de Tap\\" (pig French for \\"Tap Water\\") - obviously unable to afford anything stronger. Darling is in his forties, dresses in a Hamlet-style period costume with embroidered tunic, frilled collar and cuffs, high boots and short ornamental cape. He has an Errol Flynn moustache and pointed goatee beard to offset his receding hairline. His appearance is based on stereotypical images of Shakespeare. Darling auditions constantly for roles which are often completely unsuited to him. In one strip a director casting for Romeo and Juliet was hard-put to convince Luvvie that the role of Romeo required a man half his age. Darling's ludicrous ham acting style and overbearing personality result in him gaining only bit (walk-on) parts at best; at worst, his only theatre employment is cleaning the theatre's toilets. In several episodes, Darling ends up having to perform in pornographic films, yet he often has trouble remembering his lines and so has the need for a prompt from a lowly stage hand. In one episode, to his delight he is offered the \\"leading role\\" in \\"Cyrano de Bergerac\\", and goes all out to produce himself as the ideal leading man, complete with a huge nose. However when he appears it turns out that the \\"role\\" he thought he was in is actually to play the opening \\"roll\\" on the kettledrum for the opening announcement! He passionately believes in promoting the cultural value of theatre, is ecstatic at any chance to show off his self- proclaimed (and utterly non-existent) acting talent (once even in a prison, where he comes (horribly) to grief)! Thorp, Simon. Luvvie Darling, you're hired!\\". The Guardian, 15 June 2005. Retrieved on 5 February, 2009. In another episode he is interviewed by \\"Michael Perkinson\\" (a blatant reference to another very famous interviewer) and with every question he reveals more and more how much of a failure he is. * Major Misunderstanding ‚Äì As his name suggests, he often misunderstands situations, and is seemingly unable to interpret incidents in their own context, instead viewing them through the prism of his own prejudices, typically centred on inter-war upper-class values. For example, he once believed that a blood donor van was a chip van, and berated the nurse operating the van for trying to bring \\"unwanted custom\\" (i.e. proles) to his \\"close-knit community\\". The Major has mistaken hooded monks for Asbos and vendors at a church fete for asylum seekers. He is apparently a retired major who dresses in the regimental blazer, cravat, slacks and has a bushy walrus moustache and proudly wears his medals on his chest for all to see; characteristics which suggest a very pompous individual. He walks with a stiff upper back, and displays signs of senility in his disregard of others opinions and actions. This satire of an old school gentleman soldier set in his ways emphasises his ranting against anything that he believes goes against his dearly held traditionalist right wing moral values. He reads the Daily Mail and is always drawn by the cartoonists with his fists tightly clenched at his waist. The major's personality and manner is similar to that of earlier Viz characters, including the early Billy Britain and Victorian Dad. He has never been shown with his family, and like Victorian Dad, is often presented as dogmatic, but ultimately as a hypocrite with no self-awareness or idea of his own position as a social relic. * The Male Online ‚Äì A middle-aged man who spends most his time in his study looking at and posting on the Daily Mail website. He always believes and endorses everything the Daily Mail says, often screaming an extended version of \\"GAH\\" before ranting about health and safety, foreigners coming to Britain and other right-wing paranoia to his long-suffering wife Beryl, who will occasionally try and reason with him (always to no avail) but will inevitably just walk away exasperated. The Male will also spend his time on the website looking at (and often masturbating to) revealing photos of female celebrities with an appropriate comment (\\"Yes, she certainly is all grown up\\"). * Max Power ‚Äì a breakdown mechanic who, instead of repairing cars, rebuilds them into hot- rods. His name is a parody of Max Power magazine, which is aimed at people who are into \\"pimping\\" up cars. * Maxwell Straker ‚Äì Record Breaker. Maxwell spends most strips making increasingly futile attempts to appear in the Guinness World Records, only to end up in a bad situation where he inadvertently gets his wish: such as falling into the world's longest coma, getting the longest ever prison sentence, or breaking the record for \\"the world's daftest cunt\\". * Max's Plank ‚Äì Max is constantly plagued by pranks that are carried out by a simple plank, that always appears inanimate. Eventually he takes it to a factory to be made in to matchsticks. However, the matchsticks return to further plague him by ringing his doorbell. The title is a pun on physicist Max Planck. * Meddlesome Ratbag ‚Äì a series of strips featuring a pinch-faced, headscarf-wearing middle-aged woman (Mrs Ratbag). She takes great delight in delivering nagging lectures to complete strangers about minor breaches of social etiquette, and will go to extreme lengths to engineer a situation where she can make such a complaint. One strip began with her seeing a TV news item about the Rio de Janeiro carnival, whereupon she immediately flew to that city and booked a hotel room overlooking the carnival procession, purely in order to complain about the noise. Another strip was set during a minute's silence for a \\"some terrible tragedy or other\\" and saw her desperately (and unsuccessfully) trying to find someone who was breaking the silence, in order to remonstrate with them. She finally achieved her aim by breaking into a maternity ward and rebuking an exhausted birthing mother for the \\"disrespect\\" of failing to silence her newborn baby's cries. Another episode has her reading about NASA receiving radio transmissions from a planet many light- years away. She buys lengths of piping which she fits together and after a huge length is constructed it reaches for the alien planet. She uses it to bang on the planet with the shout, \\"Keep the noise down!\\" * Mickey's Miniature Grandpa ‚Äì a senile old man, convinced that he's four inches tall. This causes trouble for his grandson Mickey, whose mother refuses to acknowledge Grandpa's obvious insanity. Grandpa's delusion usually leads to him getting beaten up, involved in a fatal accident, injuring Mickey, or (in some cases) managing to convince others that he really is four inches tall. The strip is ostensibly a parody of Peter's Pocket Grandpa. * Mickey's Monkey Spunk Moped ‚Äì a motorised scooter which uses simian semen as fuel. In the character's first appearance, his moped runs out of simian love fuel a few panels into the story, and much hilarity ensues as he attempts to avail himself of fresh supplies so he can continue on his journey. In a final dramatic twist, Mickey eventually realises his monkey spunk moped is probably not the most practical means of transport, and so he exchanges it for a car which runs on leopard's fanny batter, which is obviously not much easier to obtain. In a slight non-sequitur to the original storyline, Mickey and the Monkey Spunk Moped are reunited for the character's second appearance in the 197th (August 2010) issue of Viz, as the last cartoon in that issue. In this second story, Mickey decides to modify the moped to run on renewable energy, as he fears additional running costs of a government increase in fuel tax. * Mickey the Martian ‚Äì An early strip featured in Viz The Big Hard One annual, which features a martian consisting of a head with three eyes and one foot. * Mike Smitt the Patronising Git ‚Äì A strip about a man who goes around pestering everyone much to their annoyance. * Millie Tant ‚Äì A caricature of the militant feminist, Millie thinks of herself as a champion of \\"Wimmin's\\" rights but is often self-centred and dismissive of the feelings of others. She rants, raises her fist in the air and foams at the mouth. She often refers to men as \\"phallocrats\\" and \\"potential rapists\\" or just \\"rapists\\", referring to other women as \\"fellow lesbians\\" regardless of their actual orientation. Most of the storylines seem to indicate sexual frustration. She often complains that various phenomena are actually metaphors for the suppression of women: fireworks are actually \\"big explosive penises\\" that \\"skewer and rape the virgin female sky\\". She refuses to make a snowman, instead offering to make a snow-black-lesbian-rape-victim- in-a-wheelchair: she plays cards with an old woman and ends the game by calling her a homophobe because she said \\"straight flush\\". In the end she often forgets her feminist stance and is shown asking a man to get rid of a mouse while she is standing on a chair, or knitting baby clothes with a simper. * The Modern Parents ‚Äì and their long-suffering children, Tarquin and Guinevere. The two, Malcolm and Cressida, are middle-class, left-wing, self- absorbed and sanctimonious, often waxing lyrical about issues such as environmentalism. Their two sons, Tarquin and Guinevere (who was given a girls' name as his parents didn't want to conform to gender stereotypes) are more down-to-earth, with Tarquin often, usually unsuccessfully, trying to reason with his parents. * Morris Day: Sexual Pervert - A moustachioed, jumper-wearing middle-aged man who is obsessed with pornography, ignoring his attractive wife who waits for him in their bedroom. Kentish Town estate agents Morris Day changed their name to Day Morris around the time of the first appearance of this character. * Mr. \\"Eating\\" Charlesworth ‚Äì An early strip featured in The Big Hard One annual, which features a gluttonous man who eats too much. * Mr Logic ‚Äì (\\"such is my name, therefore one may infer that this strip is in some way about me\\") - a serious and humourless young man with no real empathy for other people. He uses highly technical and over-elaborate language rather than straightforward speech and takes everything people say to him literally. The strip usually ends with Logic becoming the victim of his misunderstandings with others. Mr. Logic was inspired by Chris Donald's own brother, Steve, who was much later diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. Early versions of the character used the monikers \\"doodle duck dandy\\" and Hello World before arriving on Mr Logic. * Mr Rudewords ‚Äì a one-off strip about a man with coprolalia, who shouts rude words such as \\"toilet seats!\\" at socially inappropriate times. * Mrs Brady Old Lady ‚Äì an old woman who spends all her time exaggerating her age and complaining about young people of today and how things were different in her time. Mrs Brady constantly talks about her ailments; she is forgetful, inattentive, bigoted while always referring to her youth and how life was so much simpler and clear back then. She could also be seen as an object of pathos, she typically misunderstands what other people are telling her and so appears as rude, spiteful and self-absorbed - when a friend of hers is dying she seems unable to notice and only talk about her own ailments. In one episode she completely fails to realise that the friend she is talking to has been dead for over a year, and the corpse is decomposing horribly in front of the heater. Mrs Brady's full name is Ada Florence Agnes Pankhurst Brady. She is widowed and often fondly refers to her late husband, Sidney (however, according to a game on the Viz website that featured Mrs Brady shoplifting (something she did very often in the early strips) Sidney isn't dead - he just left her because he \\"couldn't stand the old cow\\" and moved to Carlisle). She is often portrayed as being a hypocrite as in most episodes complains about how immoral the modern world is and how values have gone down, while also talking of happy memories of doing the same sort of things herself in her youth because \\"you had to in them days\\". She is a hypochondriac, and particularly obsessed with her bowel movements. During a \\"convention\\" strip where multiple characters met each other in an anniversary issue Postman Plod was surprised by Mrs Brady who revealed herself to be an intelligent and witty lady, who was \\"just playing a part\\". * Mrs Clean ‚Äì a woman obsessed with having a clean house. In most strips she ends up killing or mutilating her children to keep them from making a mess in the house (e.g. stuffing and mounting them; or flaying them alive after hearing that dust mites live in skin particles). This strip appeared in several other comics around the same time. * Mrs Maybe and her Crazy Baby ‚Äì strips about a fat lady called Mrs Maybe, who makes suggestions to her baby on such matters as to where to go out to: the baby's usual response is \\"Let's fuck a coppa!\\" Very similar in premise to Rude Kid from the same comic. * My Workfare Lady ‚Äì a young woman exploited on a workfare scheme until she finally snaps and walks out. The unscrupulous employer, undeterred, phones the local authorities to have her child taken into care and request an attractive female replacement. * Nash Gordon ‚Äì a futuristic benefits cheat who eventually gets found out when he goes to the benefits office planet instead of a driving range as a result of a dodgy sat-nav. * Nobby's Piles ‚Äì a man with incredibly bad haemorrhoids. * Norbert Colon ‚Äì an old miser. In one strip, Colon shared top billing with hopeless ventriloquist Boswell Boyce (\\"he throws his voice\\") and wound up in a lunatic asylum; in another strip he went on a blind date only to find the dating agency had fixed him up with his own mother (\\"Oh turds! It's that tightwad son of mine!\\"), a dead ringer for Norbert only wearing a (clearly labelled) NHS wig. One strip featured a parody of A Christmas Carol involving his ancestor Ebenezer Colon, who is exactly like him; suggesting Norbert's miserly ways are hereditary. * Norman the Doorman - a strip about a violent doorman named Norman who works at the cinema, and then can be found in the most inopportune places such as a funeral, challenging everyone who attempts to enter. He even appears as a 'Santa's Elf' at one point, refusing entrance to a little boy and his father, before turning on Santa himself, fists flying as he shouts \\"Who let you in here with a hat on, sunshine?\\" * Norman's Knob ‚Äì the puerile tale of Norman, who thinks if he rubs his brass doorknob that he keeps in his pocket, magic things will happen to him. Norman rubs his doorknob a lot at inappropriate moments and indeed things do happen for him - in the form of arrests from irate policemen. * Nude Motorcycle Girl ‚Äì a heroic female biker who solves crimes - naked except for a crash helmet, bikini pants and motorcycle boots. * Nudge Dredd ‚Äì an overenthusiastic security guard who patrols a seaside amusement arcade, harassing customers over minor infringements and otherwise making a nuisance of himself but treated as a hero. * On Das Buses ‚Äì A slightly dark parody of the 1970s sitcom On the Buses where both the driver (Hitler) and conductor (unknown, but bearing a resemblance to Goering) tend to kill passengers who do not agree with them. Various wartime characters appear (Stalin and Churchill) driving other buses and picking up non-Aryan passengers - one a very obvious orthodox Jew - which finally give the Nazis enough fury to commit suicide! * One Cut Wally ‚Äì a gents' barber who gives all his customers exactly the same haircut even when they asked for something else. * One Man and his God ‚Äì A one off strip featuring a shepherd praying to God to round up the sheep by striking thunder and lightning at them. * Only Fools and Norses ‚Äì a Viking-themed parody of the BBC comedy Only Fools and Horses. * Orson Cart, He Comes A.P.A.R.T ‚Äì A kid who can remove his body parts thanks to once receiving a blast of radioactivity. * Our Neighbours are Bastards ‚Äì a man (later his wife after he dies of heart failure) who makes his neighbours' life hell by complaining about their behaviour (which it appears he has created himself in order to have some to complain about). * Out Comes Stanley ‚Äì a man who slashes people with a Stanley knife at the most trivial of provocation. * Outcast of the Pony Ballet School ‚Äì a parody of the comic strips in the 1970s/1980s style of teenage girl's magazine such as Pony School and Bunty, in which Steve McFadden, for no apparent reason, attends a private school for girls where all his classmates are eleven or twelve years old. The wealthy students bully him for being poor and having a shabby-looking pony, until it is discovered at the end of the story that he is really a princess. The title may be based on \\"Outcast of the Pony School\\", a real comic strip which ran in Bunty. P‚ÄìS * Page 3 School ‚Äì An all-teenage-girl school where the students are required to attend topless (much to the arousal of all men they encounter, with the exception of their male teachers). They are often inspected at the gate by a teacher to ensure their nipples are erect and up to school standard. They later compete in a polo game against a rival girls' school who instead go full nude. As the title implies, the strip parodies topless female posers who appear on the 3rd page of various newspapers, particularly The Sun. And, like their pictures, the comic strip was printed on the third page of the issue it was published in. * The Parkie ‚Äì An extremely angry, to say nothing of cruel, park keeper who extremely viciously abuses people that seem like they are breaking park rules, when in fact they are not - he even creates his own rules just so that he can abuse them. Early strips carried satirical introductions like \\"Totally Dodgy Cartoons Present...\\" and \\"A social comment (why not?)\\". * Pathetic Sharks ‚Äì (sometimes called the Crap Sharks). An occasional strip featuring a group of sharks, much feared not for their ferocity, but their mind-numbingly boring and pathetic behaviour and conversational style. Instead of hunting for prey, they ask people on the beach for crisps, ice cream and toffee, except for one shark who claims to be \\"lactose intolerant\\". Generally the strip consists of some sort of shipwreck or holiday-by-the-seaside theme; the initial apprehension at the sighting of shark fins turns into abject horror: \\"Oh no! Crap sharks!\\". In one strip a group of WWII shipwreck survivors blow themselves up with a hand grenade rather than face the Crap Sharks. * PC Blouse ‚Äì a police officer who is ineffective at his job because he is weak and cowardly and is also not taken seriously by the public. * PC Hopper, Bent Copper ‚Äì a corrupt police officer who often takes bribes and is frequently shown beating a confession out of a suspect. * PC Plod ‚Äì a police officer who carries a woven bag, wears sandals and is more concerned with the criminal's human rights than arresting them. * Paul Whicker, the tall vicar ‚Äì A deliberately crudely drawn cartoon of a misanthropic vicar. In one strip, he commits insurance fraud to maintain church funds by gambling (which he then appropriates for his own use). He is often challenged by his superior, Bishop Bloggs, who tries to thwart Whicker's schemes. At one point, he is about to be arrested by police only to tell the bishop and the arresting officer that he won a bet on the horses and the parish funds are five thousand pounds up as a result. Although amoral, Whicker has ironically been known to expose the hypocrisy of his superiors. Especially as Whicker uses \\"missionary work\\" as an excuse for drug trafficking after being shunted from parish to parish, covering up his misdeeds (sleeping with the bishop's wife and daughter). He has even been known to have connections to corrupt officials, such as a customs officer. One early strip has a frame with a skinhead and media studies lecturer sitting on the bench where Whicker plans on getting drunk. The media studies lecturer gives his thoughts on the strip as an indictment of pious hypocrisy, whereas the skinhead thinks he's \\"A fuckin' magic violent Vikka (sic)\\". Another one-of character is Pat Berger, the Fat Verger. At some point, Whicker is made a bishop as he is seen drinking with Roger Mellie following Roger's rather dreadful attempt to present a religious programme having subsequently got drunk on communion wine and relieved himself in the church font. * Peter the Slow Eater ‚Äì a man who, as the title suggests, takes his time eating meals much to the frustration of his family, especially his kids whom he will not allow to leave the table \\"until everyone has finished eating\\". Another scenario has him with two mates in the pub (as a slow drinker) insisting on buying a round when his pint is untouched, and letting everyone else get served before him, much to the frustration of his drinking buddies (who discreetly drink his pint and order two pints for themselves without looking and by the time he gets back to the table they have gone). * Phil's Spectre ‚Äì A strip about a young boy who believes he can see a \\"ghost\\", in reality an escaped convict hiding underneath a white sheet. The strip is very similar in premise to Zip O'Lightning (see below). The title appears to be a pun on Phil Spector's name. * The Pie-Eyed Piper ‚Äì A parody of The Pied Piper of Hamelin where the titular piper is so drunk he even makes the rats get drunk. * The Pirates of Ben's Pants ‚Äì A one-off strip featuring a young boy named Benjamin whose underpants are home to a crew of miniature pirates (the name being an obvious play on The Pirates of Penzance). * Playtime Fontayne ‚Äì a middle-aged bank clerk who behaves like a primary school-aged child. He made his first appearance in the comic along with his opposite \\"Little Old Man\\", a more short-lived character of a young boy who acts like the stereotype of an elderly man. Often the other members of the bank are also portrayed as children, especially when their boss is away sick. * Pop Shot ‚Äì Real name: Gerald. A man who is almost always naked; sporting a stereotypical 1970s pornstar moustache, afro and chest hair, who always finds himself accidentally slipping into the language of a porn film while performing everyday activities, much to the annoyance of his wife. The strip always ends with his wife spontaneously having sex with a complete stranger, with Gerald left out of the proceedings. * Pope-eye the Pontiff Man ‚Äì A parody of Popeye the Sailor depicted as the pope. * Poppy Bullshit and Araminta Bollocks, Art Makers ‚Äì Two women who try and create modern forms of art from basic situations but always fail through lack of foresight - for example they set up a trap to lure a mouse, which turns out to be a rat. * Posh Street Kids ‚Äì A parody of the Bash Street Kids from The Beano. In this one-off strip, these schoolkids annoy their teacher by leaving their butlers lying about in the playground, smoking high-priced Cuban cigars behind the bike shed and having food fights in the canteen with caviar, strawberries and champagne. In the end, they do get dealt with, but they craftily prevent painful canings on their backsides by slipping thick literary works of art \\"worth thysands of pynds\\" down the backs of their trousers, though the teacher seems not to notice the extra padding as he administers their punishment. * Postman Plod, \\"The Miserable Bastard\\" ‚Äì a mean-spirited postman with a serious attitude problem and a highly questionable work ethic. Plod is bone idle and lethargic and frequently takes extended periods off work with questionable excuses that only hold water because they are supported with notes from his doctor who is just lazy as he is. The pair of them often concoct some excuse for time off work so that they can go and play golf. Whenever he turns up for work at all Plod is completely lacking in any work ethics, and often enjoys opening and reading the post he is meant to be delivering. He is not even bothered about hiding this activity, and after reading someone's bank statement, either mocking or embarrassing that person for their poor financial situation (another example is when he exposes a resident's arrival of brown-enveloped \\"jazz mags\\" to the whole street). The other post office staff are also shown to be lazy and dissatisfied with their jobs and spend most of the time sat playing cards (with the exception of the post office manager who tries desperately in vain to run a tight ship). In the lead up to Christmas once, Plod and all his fellow postmen opened up all the parcels at the sorting office and stole whatever they wanted to save having to buy their own presents. On one occasion he even just threw all the post he was meant to deliver in a hedge and went home early. Another Christmas feature he took part in the poem 'The Night Mail' which was specially re-written for him, and displayed his uselessness for all to see. He was eventually chucked off the train and the final frame had him, drunk and lying in the snow, wishing the reader a Merry Christmas! * The Princess Who Would be King ‚Äì a strip portraying Mervyn King as a fairytale princess who secretly wants to be the Governor of the Bank of England. * Professor Fuck ‚Äì The weekly professor who answers awful questions, supposedly submitted by readers. * Professor Piehead ‚Äì an inventor of amazing inventions which always go wrong and normally kill the Professor or his lab assistant, Tim (whom the Professor always addresses as Joe, for unknown reasons of his own). * Quentin Tarranteeny ‚Äì a parody portraying Quentin Tarantino as an extremely foul-mouthed baby who speaks as if delivering a monologue in one of Tarantino's films. * Raffles, Gentleman Thug ‚Äì a late 19th-century aristocrat who behaves like a stereotypical 21st- century thug. * Rainbrow ‚Äì a violent and adult-themed parody of Rainbow (minus Geoffrey) that sees an abusive Zippy and gullible Bungle meet with kidnappers to pay for George's ransom. During the exchange, Zippy upon learning how meager the ransom was, boasts how he and the gang are worth far more and what the kidnappers wanted, causing them to then kidnap and ransom him to a reluctant George and Bungle. * Randall and Diana (Deceased) ‚Äì a controversial one-off parody of Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) with Diana, Princess of Wales taking the place of Hopkirk to become \\"the people's ghost private detective\\". She and Randall investigate the claims of a man who believes his wife is having an affair, only to discover that the woman is in fact selling landmines to Africa; at which Diana promises \\"Dead or alive, I'm determined to put a stop to it.\\" The strip attracted press controversy because of the real Princess Diana's then-recent death. * Rat Boy ‚Äì a pre-teen repeat offender and drug addict, characterised by a permanent \\"tail\\" of excrement protruding from his backside - his every strip involves burglary, vandalism, assault and/or substance abuse, with minimal reprisals by the police. He is the brother of Tasha Slappa. The inspiration of his character is from that of the real-life career criminal, Tommy Laws, who was nicknamed Spiderboy by the police and the media due to his habitual climbing onto roofs and high places in order to evade capture. Most of his adventures involve breaking and entering, vandalising a place and taking anything of value, then usually either evading the law, or getting off very lightly because he is a child. When arrested at one house which he ransacked he is sent on a \\"self-esteem building for young offenders\\" programme, which turns out to be a holiday in Spain.Viz #100 After another crime spree, he is put on trial by remote TV link to a detention cell (intended to be less traumatic than a courtroom trial); the kindly judge allows him to go free, whilst Rat Boy has already escaped through a sewer, somehow taking the TV with him, and is busy selling it as a stolen good. He was once subject to house arrest, enforced by electronic tagging on his ankle - unable to remove the tag, he gnaws his own leg off and hops outside to quickly rob several more houses.Viz #109 (Needless to say, his loss of limb is forgotten in subsequent comics.) He even once managed to steal the Crown Jewels.Viz #158 He proceeds to steal an old cruise ship used as a floating nightclub off the Newcastle coast and abandon it (burnt-out and balanced on bricks, like a stolen car) in Amsterdam, where he gets arrested for seeking drugs and underage sex. His punishment, ironically, is to be used as a lab rat in a drugs testing clinic, which he finds delightful...Viz summer special 2000 * Ravy Davey Gravy ‚Äì a young man into rave culture who breaks out into strange dances whenever he hears any kind of repetitive everyday noises, including car alarms and road drills. His name possibly derives from Wavy Gravy. * Raymond Porter and his Bucket of Water ‚Äì a boy who carries around a bucket of water which he uses to solve all sorts of problems. It appeared only in early episodes of the comic, and may have been shelved to make way for the similarly-themed \\"Felix and his Amazing Underpants\\". * Raymond the Large Caterpillar ‚Äì A one off strip from the early 1980s about a caterpillar who takes up all the panels of the comic. * Real Ale Twats ‚Äì three rather pompous men (of whom only one has lines) - who speak in an affected style. They only drink real ale, and the speaker even going so far as to keep extensive \\"reviews\\" of all the real ales that they have supped. He is also known to criticise lager drinkers. A parody of the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA). Many times his boring speeches, or his attitude to those around them result in dreadful injuries. It is also made clear that in some cases they are not made welcome when they enter a pub (one barmaid saying \\"Oh God!\\" when seeing them) likely due to their previous behaviour when they've been there. * Reverend Milo's Lino Rhino ‚Äì a vicar who travels around on a rhinoceros distributing rolls of linoleum and \\"converting\\" carpet users. * Roswell Stiles and his Intriguing X-Files ‚Äì a one-off strip centred on a character named Roswell who wears glasses and carries a cabinet of \\"X-Files\\" and attempts to search for phenomena such as falling fish, spontaneous human combustion, crop circles, UFOs, big cats etc. but has no success; such as mistaking a kitten standing next to a Bonsai tree for an alien big cat winding up in the seals' enclosure at the zoo and many others. When he attempts to fake a UFO sighting by throwing an old car wheel trim into the air, it smashes another man's green house, who shoves the filing cabinet up Roswell's bottom. * Reverend Ramsden's Ringpiece Cathedral ‚Äì a vicar with a life-sized church up his bottom. * Robbie on the Run ‚Äì a young orphan boy running away from a foster mother who is using him as \\"slave labour\\" (in reality, a perfectly ordinary and kind woman who simply asked him to help clear the table after dinner). * Robot Nun (She's Got Tommy-Gun Tits!) ‚Äì She bursts into a service being held in a church in outer space, and massacres the congregation with automatic weapons firing through her nipples. * Rod Hull and Emo - A one-off strip parodying Rod Hull and Emu, in which Emu becomes Emo, a stereotypically maudlin emo fan. * Roger Irrelevant (\\"He's Completely Hatstand\\") ‚Äì a young man with a very strange mental problem where he continually produces irrelevant and surreal streams of language and behaviour. In one strip, Roger throws a lamp from the roof of a house after a long, impassioned (and obviously unsuccessful) plea for the lamp not to commit suicide. On another occasion he decides to elope with an armchair, declaring it is pregnant with his children. Another time sees him disrupting the funeral of a relative by dragging the corpse out of the coffin and - employing a Brooklyn accent and emulating a character from a Mickey Spillane novel - aggressively questioning the deceased about some stolen goods. His parents seem to be very understanding and merely politely request that he stops his behaviour. These are the only times that Roger manages to show any sign of interaction with real people, although usually it is only in the form of saying things like \\"wibble wibble\\". (Dictionary.com attributes this nonsense-word to Roger; see External Links below.) \\"Frisnit\\" and \\"z'goft\\" are two of Roger's other favourite words. * Roger Mellie (\\"The Man on the Telly - who says 'Bollocks!'\\") ‚Äì a foul-mouthed, perverted, corrupt and violent TV presenter, whose activities satirise real TV shows and incidents. His on-screen greeting was originally 'Hello, Good Evening and Bollocks'! Starred in a spinoff cartoon, voiced by Peter Cook. He has in recent years lent his name to Roger's Profanisaurus, a book which purportedly lists all the obscenities used in the English-speaking world. The work is updated in every issue of Viz, and periodically reprinted under various risqu√© titles. * Roger the Lodger ‚Äì a parody of the Beano character Roger the Dodger. * The Adventures of Rolf Harris the Cat ‚Äì A one-off strip which features a Scottish Rolf Harris in feline form attempting to deliver a package and avoid water- based hazards, only to find the package was a diver's watch. * Ronnie Barker In Heaven ‚Äì A strip depicting Ronnie Barker in Heaven where a shopkeeper (looking suspiciously like Ronnie Corbett) constantly \\"misunderstands\\" Barker's requests in the style of the famous Four Candles sketch. Barker is so irritated by this that he decides to go to Hell instead, but ends up stuck in a queue behind the Devil who is arguing with an identical shopkeeper. * Rotating Chin Men ‚Äì A gang of flying villains with jetpacks whose intention is to spoil Queen Elizabeth II's coronation by squirting semen onto her via a pump squeeze mechanism linked to their revolving chins. Paraphrased quote by the Archbishop of Canterbury: \\"I can't crown a queen with all jizz matted in her hair, it would be most unconstitutional\\". The villains are foiled by the two child heroes who hook one of the villains' rotating chin with the archbishop's crook, causing the mechanism to overheat and \\"dribble jissom all down his chin\\". * Roy Schneider - Joy Rider ‚Äì A 14-year-old perpetual truant yob whose attempts to cause trouble in his community usually end up with him looking ridiculous. For example, he twocs a car, looks in the rear-view mirror, and expresses delight that the police are chasing him already; in the next frame it is revealed that both Roy's car and the \\"pursuing\\" police car are models on a fairground ride, from which Roy is summarily ejected by the operator. * Roy Wood is Watching - So far two strips have appeared under this grim title, which is a spoof of George Orwell's Nineteen_Eighty-Four. A telemarketer is featured undergoing impossible situations. Not actually evil, but impossible. You end up feeling quite sad for the fellow. * Rubber Johnny ‚Äì A strip about a boy with an elastic body. * Ruby Mary and her Arse of Fire ‚Äì A strip about a girl who eats too much Indian food. * Rude Kid ‚Äì one-frame strip where a young boy answers the most polite request with a rude word or phrase, such as his mother saying \\"Are you looking forward to the Eurovision Song Contest, son?\\" and he replies with \\"Granny's pubes, y'whore!\\". This comic actually predates Viz, featuring in some of the proto-Viz fanzines created by Donald in the 1970s. * Sam, Son of Man ‚Äì a young boy who believes himself to be the second (or third) coming and moves in a mysterious way. * Sammy and his Stammer ‚Äì A strip from the early 1980s issues of Viz (and later featured in The Big Hard One annual) in which the titular character has a speech impediment and ends the strip by swearing. * The Scaffolders Were Bastards ‚Äì a group of construction workers who solicit an old lady for a contract to renovate the front of her beautiful thatched cottage; but when they get the job are extremely rude, aggressive and deliberately careless in their work, further adding to the cost. The strip ends with the house collapsing because of their negligence. * Schools ‚Äì One-off strips featuring a school where the students have the same thing in common, e.g. Page 3 School pupils are all well-known Page 3 girls. * Scooter Dolphin Boy ‚Äì A young boy who travels around on a kick scooter, solving crime with the help of his dolphin friend. The strip ends with him failing to catch the crooks, ending up in hospital, and being arrested for cruelty to the dolphin. * Scottie Trotter and his Tottie Allotment ‚Äì A boy with a portable miniature garden with several scantily-clad women on it. * Scum Mothers, Who'd 'Ave 'Em? ‚Äì Occasional strip created by Barney Farmer and Lee Healey (also responsible for the Drunken Bakers, George Bestial, Hen Cabin and We...), in which a young middle-class couple are continually embarrassed by the husband's drunken, foul-mouthed mother and her various thuggish boyfriends. The title is a play on Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em. * Sheridan Poorly ‚Äì A man convinced that he is terminally ill, even though he is constantly being told by doctors that there is nothing wrong with him. The character's name references Sheridan Morley. * Sherlock Homeless ‚Äì the street-homeless main character is a parody of Sherlock Holmes who solves crimes for the reward money - which is inevitably spent on Tennents Super. * Sherlock Homo ‚Äì an outrageously gay version of Sherlock Holmes. Despite the clear lack of justification for searching them, he employs various ruses to have well-built men stopped and searched in order to investigate their backsides, sighing \\"some day my prince will come\\". * Shirker Bee ‚Äì A once-only strip featuring a worker bee within a hive who is unusually lazy, feigning illness and quoting bizarre contractual details to get out of doing his job. * Shitty Dick ‚Äì a man with a difficult medical condition, wherein he expels impossibly large stools whenever he interacts with a vicar. The humour of the strip usually revolves around him explaining away the turds, often disguising them as something else (a snowman, a large Easter egg, etc.) * Sid the Sexist ‚Äì a young man with no sexual experience who boasts of his success with women. His distinct lack of tact or any social graces do not help him in his quest to \\"pull\\" women. Starred in a spinoff cartoon. * Silvio Berlusconi's Jaffa Cake Bunga-Bungalow ‚Äì surreal strip in which Silvio Berlusconi owns a giant Jaffa Cake converted into a one-storey house, which he uses to hold wild sex parties. * Simon Lotion, Time and Motion man ‚Äì a hopeless male parent who insists his family reorganise every mundane household and leisure activity to fit his \\"professional\\", pedantic view of how the world should be run more efficiently. This always results in the complete failure of the proposed activity to meet any kind of performance or time constraint, with pathetic yet humorous consequences. * Simon Salad-Cream ‚Äì A pastiche of TV and radio presenter Simon Mayo. The strip shows him presenting a very mundane radio show. Not an overtly funny strip; its humour lay in the implied criticism of the supposed dullness of Mayo's show at the time. * Simon's Snowman ‚Äì Occasional strip which featured in some Christmas issues during the 1990s. A parody of The Snowman, in which a violent, foul-mouthed snowman takes a young boy on a drinking and gambling spree. * Sir Edmund Hilarity ‚Äì a mountaineer who continually endangers the lives of his team by playing inappropriate practical jokes on them during an expedition to climb Mount Everest. The team die when a Sherpa unwittingly lights up one of Hilarity's joke exploding cigars, causing a fatal avalanche. Hilarity's camera is discovered 50 years later by modern-day climbers, who develop the film to discover that Hilarity did not take any pictures of the trip, and instead used the entire roll of film to take pictures of himself at Base Camp with his teammates' toothbrushes inserted up his bottom. He is a parody of the real-life explorer Sir Edmund Hillary. * Sir Fred Goodwin the Fat Cat ‚Äì the former governor of the Royal Bank of Scotland Fred Goodwin parodied as an overweight feline forced to catch mice in order to earn his pension. * Skinheed ‚Äì An early comic strip showing a young man with social problems turning into an inhuman monster. * Skippy the Bush Kangaroo ‚Äì A kangaroo that lives in a woman's pubic hair. * Spawny Get ‚Äì a boy whose initial apparent bad luck always turns into incredible fortune. * Specky Twat ‚Äì a boy who suffers bad vision, and wears thick glasses. He often mistakes things for something else. * Spoilt Bastard ‚Äì Real name: Timothy (Timmy) Timson. A horrible, fat, ungrateful and vicious-tongued boy who manipulates his weak-willed mother into satisfying his hollow and selfish desires, usually with serious health-threatening, or financial destroying, or both, consequences for her. She is named more than once as \\"Sissy\\" - which pretty much describes her personality. She often addresses him in terms of endearment: \\"My Little Prince\\", etc. The character is similar to a comic strip which appeared in Monster Fun and later Buster called Mummy's Boy. His name, as it contains an obscenity, is often altered slightly whenever featured on the front page of an issue of Viz, as it would be easily read by children who are otherwise not entitled to buy the magazine. For example: \\"Sboilt Pastard\\". One shudders to think what his life would be like for those around him if he were released after schooling on the rest of the world! * Stag Knight ‚Äì a one- off strip of a buck's night/stag night in the time of King Arthur/Camelot. Strip shows, late-night kebab shops and a barroom brawl is presented in Ye Olde English. * Stalin on the Corner Watching the Girls Go By ‚Äì a strip about Joseph Stalin attempting to pick up women with a series of increasingly ridiculous lines. Most of the women are horrified, but when he finally meets one who is attracted to Communist dictators, she instead goes home with Chairman Mao. * Stamp-Addressed Antelope ‚Äì A one off strip about an antelope who offers people rides by means of adding a stamp to it. * Stan the Statistician ‚Äì a nerd who tells everybody the probability of every event. * Step Ladder ‚Äì A strip about a family of ladders. * Steve Irwin - Nursing Home Care Assistant ‚Äì A one-off strip featuring Steve Irwin as said nursing home care assistant, describing the elderly as the animals he encounters such as crocodiles. * Straw, Berry and Cream ‚Äì surreal strip where the British Government assigns Jack Straw, Mary Berry and the band Cream to stop an alien threat in 60 minutes or the world will be destroyed with nuclear weapons. After many mishaps, the aliens turn out not to be hostile, and everyone enjoys a picnic at 10 Downing Street with food provided by Berry. * Student Grant ‚Äì an upper middle-class student at Fulchester (or sometimes Spunkbridge) University, who is fashionably and smugly \\"right on\\" and a left-wing radical, and who is routinely bailed out by his affluent parents when things go wrong. Grant does little or no work for his degree. One strip had him visiting his department (he had to be directed by a friend) to see his personal tutor, who pointed out that he had not handed in a single essay in three years. The terms seem ridiculously short (4 weeks in one case, the Christmas vacation lasting from mid-November to late March). When UK students received a maintenance grant and free tuition Student Grant appeared in most issues. In late 2010/early 2011, Grant reappeared again following the student riots against tuition fees, ending up in a \\"taxi\\" that turns out to be a limousine carrying Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall. He has a number of friends just like him, eager to express their individuality by wearing the same clothes, fashions, invariably ridiculous, like huge hats, bright yellow dungarees and T-shirts with slogans on them like Thunderbirds Are Go! and, in the late 1990s especially, Teletubbies Say \\"Eh Oh\\"!. They are opinionated and talk loudly and ignorantly about various subjects, tagging \\"...actually!\\" at the end of their sentences, \\"proving\\" their intelligence by listing the grades they got in their A-levels. Several of Grant's friends have bizarre speech impediments, dental deformities, or both. * Suicidal Syd ‚Äì a manically depressed young man who makes various unsuccessful attempts to kill himself. Each strip involves Syd becoming depressed over some issue and deciding to commit suicide and will typically make three attempts only for each of them to fail somehow (for instance, in one strip he draws what he thinks is a cartoon of Muhammad and shows it to a group of fanatical Islamists, hoping they will murder him, but he then realises he has actually drawn a picture of Muhammad Ali). After his failed attempts to kill himself, Syd's faith in humanity will be restored only for him to die in random circumstances soon afterwards. Much like Big Vern, he is always resurrected in time for the next strip. * Supergod and the Son of Man Wonder ‚Äì A strip about God and Jesus depiced as superheroes. * Super Mario Curie ‚Äì A strip depicting Marie Curie as Mario from Super Mario Bros. * Super Villain Dad ‚Äì A strip about a father who thinks he's a supervillain. * S.W.A.N.T ‚Äì a crack paramilitary police team with \\"Special Weapons and No Tactics\\" which parodies American SWAT teams. * Sweary Mary ‚Äì a character who resembles The Beano's Minnie the Minx. Her sole purpose in life was to say as many rude words as possible; and the comic's story revolved around her attempts to evade censorship. When she was finally granted her wish to swear on the front cover, she lost her voice and was ridiculed by the other regular characters. Since then she has not reappeared as the comic's creators felt that the character had been taken as far as she can go; although other characters still use the word \\"fitbin\\" (which Mary claimed was incredibly rude) as an expletive. The first appearance of what would be known as \\"Roger's Profanisaurus\\" was a special \\"Sweary Mary's Dictionary\\" that came bundled with a regular issue of the magazine. The latest edition of the Profanisaurus is titled \\"Hail Sweary\\" which is probably a nod to her heritage. T‚ÄìZ * Tarquin Hoylett ‚Äì he has to go to the toilet ‚Äì finds himself saving a desperate situation - e.g. landing a jumbo jet after the flight crew fall unconscious - only to abandon the effort at the last moment in order to visit the lavatory. \\"Excuse me, I must go to the toilet.\\" * Tasha Slappa ‚Äì originally Kappa Slappa, after the sportswear brand, but changed on \\"legal advice\\". She is a teenage girl who follows a stereotypical \\"chav\\" lifestyle, and lives at home in Newcastle with her lazy, irresponsible mother and countless siblings, all from different (and unknown) fathers. Her main pursuits involve maximising her income from the state benefits system (for her own use) and shoplifting. Tasha is a moody, belligerent and foul-mouthed teenage girl. She is arrogant, aggressive and frequently dismisses things with \\"I divvint give a fuck\\" (divvint is Geordie dialect for don't). She also has a boyfriend called Bobba ‚Äì who it is hinted may also be her father and grandfather ‚Äì who is fiercely defensive of her and has a violent temper, so that she can persuade him to beat up just about anyone for the most arbitrary of reasons. He is not very intelligent and is susceptible to anything she tells him, enabling her to get the better of him if he upsets her or tries to order her about. She is unbelievably lazy, constantly truants and will go to any lengths to avoid any other work. She is an avid fan of The Jeremy Kyle Show (a British television chat show aimed at a lower-class audience) and many of her schemes centre on procuring a way for her to sit at home all day and watch it non-stop. Her other hobbies include having sexual intercourse with strangers (when Bobba isn't around), binge drinking, smoking and gossiping with her equally delinquent friends. As well as her being Rat Boy's sister, Tasha's mother (\\"Mam\\") and numerous children have had their own strips in the comic. * The Teacher from the Black Lagoon ‚Äì a parody of the Creature from the Black Lagoon. A monstrous teacher drags victims to his underwater classroom where he bores them to death with lessons. * Teevee Twins ‚Äì Two young boys who attempt to make their own TV programmes (using a cardboard box as a pretend camera), pestering people for interviews and even deliberately causing accidents so they have something exciting to film. The strip would usually end with them trying to \\"film\\" some kind of violent criminal and being beaten up. * Telly Evangelist ‚Äì A Roman Catholic priest, Father O'Brien, who is addicted to television. Whenever he isn't watching television he is talking about it (often doing both at the same time). * Terry Fuckwitt ‚Äì \\"The unintelligent cartoon character\\"; an extremely dim-witted boy. Fuckwitt continuously mistakes situations, objects and people for each other. In appearance, he is cross-eyed and has wild black hair sticking up in a style resembling dreadlocks, and wears absurd platform shoes. Due to the swear word in his name, the comic never prints it in its entirety on the front page, often obscuring it with another graphic element, or else spoonerising it to \\"Wuckfitt\\". In one strip he appears to be getting married, but it is revealed that he is not in a church, but in a nuclear power plant, and that his bride is a rod of uranium. Fuckwitt's surreal misunderstandings are sometimes extended in multiple directions, or even circularly. Fuckwitt may be chastised by another character for being in the wrong place, and that character may later themselves be revealed to be someone completely different based on a misunderstanding of the first character, making it apparent that in fact Fuckwitt's initial impression was correct. These \\"facts\\" then may be completely reversed in a surprise reveal in the next frame, and so forth. * Terry the Tanked-Up Engine - Spoof on Thomas, in which Terry and his friends are found sleeping off a huge binge, and they wake up and immediately throw up. * Terry Tree ‚Äì A man who turns into a tree at inconvenient times. * Tex Wade ‚Äì \\"Frontier Accountant\\"; cowboy desperado and financial auditor who shoots dead anyone who crosses his path (and fails to balance their books properly). * The Artist Formerly Known as Prince in the Tower ‚Äì whimsical strip where, after reading about the Princes in the Tower, musician Prince travels back in time to Plantagenet London to save them from Richard III. * The Human League (In Outer Space) ‚Äì a strip featuring the 1980s pop band and their adventures in outer space (parodying the cartoon series Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space). * The Three Blairs ‚Äì A parody of The Beano's Three Bears featuring Tony, Cherie and Leo. * The Things ‚Äì bizarre aliens that were contrived into situations whereby the human participants could say things like \\"These things... (situation)...\\" * Thermos O'Flask ‚Äì A man who dresses as a Thermos flask and can't keep away from prostitutes. Each strip revolves around Thermos's attempts to avoid encountering a prostitute, but he always gives in by the end. * There's a Holness in my Pocket ‚Äì Young Danny Dearelizadeareliza was the luckiest owner of a miniature Blockbusters host Bob Holness, which lived in his jacket pocket. * Thieving Gypsy Bastards ‚Äì Infamous one-off strip about Irish travellers, \\"Mc O'Dougles\\", who descend on a middle-class front garden, steal and vandalise everything in sight, with the approval of the local council before moving on. On the next page there was a three-panel \\"compensatory\\" strip entitled The Nice, Honest Gypsies. It involved an old Romany woman giving change back to a home owner who had been overcharged for some clothes pegs. An end note adding that in next month's strip The Good Honest Gypsies would be renewing the car tax on their big American car. Both strips caused uproar from race relation groups in the UK. The publishers were accused of promoting prejudice and hatred against an ethnic minority. Following involvement by the UK's Commission for Racial Equality, the British Romany Council and even receiving a reprimand from the United Nations, the next issue of Viz contained a 'cut-out-and-keep' apology, subtitled \\"what every gypsy's been waiting for!\\". * Thoughtful Bully ‚Äì A high-school student who can present a good case to his teacher why he should be allowed to bully his classmates. * The Mcbrowntrouts ‚Äì strip centred on a Scottish family and their toilet-humour antics. A parody of the real comic strip The Broons. * The Vibrating Bum-faced Goats ‚Äì an influential one-off strip where two schoolchildren from the city go to stay with their grandfather in the countryside. The grandfather owns a herd of petrol-driven mechanical goats with buttocks in place of faces ‚Äì referred to in the strip as robotic rump- resembling ruminants. * Thomas the Tank Top and Friends ‚Äì A parody of Thomas and Friends depicting the titular E2 Tank Locomotive as a jumper. * Timothy Potter ‚Äì Trainspotter ‚Äì Went round taking video of trains with his camcorder, in particular British Rail Class 37 locomotives, then had \\"one off the wrist\\" whilst playing back the videos on the telly. Often portrayed as being very short sighted (for example he mistook a set of golf clubs for his brother). * Tina's Tits ‚Äì A schoolgirl with unreasonably large breasts. She is convinced that they possess magical powers, when they clearly do not. * Tinribs ‚Äì recalls the adventures of schoolboy Tommy Taylor and his 'incredible robot' Tinribs. Despite the fact that Tinribs is supposedly a highly advanced robot, it is obvious that he is made up very basic parts including a skateboard, a box, two tins and a voicebox that constantly repeats \\"Hi. I'm Barbie. I love you very much.\\". Regardless, everyone around Tommy believes Tinribs to be a miracle of technology, with the exception of teacher Mr Snodworthy who always ends up suffering graphic and very painful injuries during the course of each strip. Based on the D.C. Thompson character Brassneck. * Toast Kid ‚Äì a child who attempts to solve problems using toast. * Toby's Jug ‚Äì A strip about a boy called Toby who claims that his jug can solve people's problems, except it doesn't. * Tom and Gerry ‚Äì a one off strip that is a parody of Tom & Jerry, the only real difference being that Jerry's name is spelt with a G instead of a J. The strip is centred on Tom finally catching Jerry and commenting, \\"Got the bastard!\\" * Tommy and his Magic Shoes ‚Äì A one off strip from the late 1970s (also appears in The Big Hard One annual) in which the titular character gets requested from a random reader who appears in the strip to see his magic shoes, only to be told that \\"some bleeder ripped them off\\". * Tommy and his Trifle ‚Äì \\"Young Tommy Thompson was the luckiest boy in Barndale, for he had an enormous trifle.\\" Tommy and his trifle get involved in snack-related hijinks at his school. * Tommy \\"Banana\\" Johnson ‚Äì an influential early strip since reprinted in different formats such as a \\"12\\" remix\\" and an \\"on ice\\" version. The strip depicts the titular boy with a giant banana, pointlessly offering it to solve people's problems. A policeman then shoves the banana up Johnson's anus.http://bimshwel.com/beets/bananaice.jpg * Tommy Salter ‚Äì Chemical Capers ‚Äì A young boy obsessed with performing bizarre experiments (such as forcing his sister to smoke asbestos cigarettes) with a total disregard for safety. His name comes from the Thomas Salter range of chemistry sets popular during the 1970s and 1980s. * Topless Jan Fox and her Cornflakes Box ‚Äì A dimwitted young woman who wanders around wearing nothing above the waist (hence the \\"topless\\" part) who believes a box of cornflakes she is holding has magical powers. * Topless Skateboarding Nun ‚Äì A companion piece to Nude Motorcycle Girl, this strip features a well-endowed young nun who fights crime and saves orphans while riding on a skateboard ‚Äì naked except for a wimple, a sensible skirt and big clumpy shoes. * Tranny Magnet ‚Äì a short, balding middle-aged bachelor who is irresistibly attractive to transsexuals and cross-dressers, although he desperately wants to find a real woman. (The title is a pun on the expression \\"Fanny Magnet\\" meaning variously something which will supposedly make a man highly attractive to women, or, a man who imagines himself to be so.) * Tubby Johnson ‚Äì an impossibly fat boy. * VAR Wars - A one-off strip where Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader's lightsaber duel is interrupted by a referee wanting to check a video replay of Luke's hand being sliced off, with the two complaining that things were much better when they were allowed to just get on with it. * Vicki Drake ‚Äì A woman who acts everyday life as if she's hosting a talk show. A parody of real-life talk show host Ricki Lake. * Victor and his Boa Constrictor ‚Äì A strip about a man and his pet boa constrictor. * Victor Pratt, the Stupid Twat ‚Äì A top hat-wearing twat, who makes poor puns to his friend on a motorcycle. * Victorian Dad ‚Äì a father who applies strict Victorian values to himself and his family, even though they are living in the present. This also appeared during the Back to Basics campaign, and could be seen as a satirical commentary on it. * Vidal Baboon ‚Äì A baboon employed as a \\"stylist\\" at an upmarket hairdresser's; it ends up scalping the customer and trashing the salon. * Wacky Racists ‚Äì a parody of the Hanna-Barbera cartoon television series Wacky Races, featuring a number of far right personalities including Adolf Hitler, Eug√®ne Terre'Blanche, Unity Mitford (akin to Penelope Pitstop), the Ku Klux Klan and David Irving with his companion mutt Mosley (akin to Dick Dastardly and Muttley). Vehicles included the \\"Mein Kampfervan\\". * Wanker Watson ‚Äì a parody of the Winker Watson strip from The Dandy, set in a boys' boarding school, following the antics of Watson and his friends, and their hapless nemesis, Mr Creep. This strip prompted litigation by Dandy owners, D. C. Thomson & Co. Ltd. * We ... ‚Äì A very bleak strip in which a man is seen working in different businesses, usually providing some kind of service to people in financial hardship (such as a bank, private loans company, pawn shop, car hire, or running a guest house). He is completely unsympathetic to customers' personal circumstances, insists they pay the maximum of charges and fees, refuses to negotiate, and constantly mocks and demeans them for their unfortunate situation. However, some of his customers are shown to be equally unscrupulous, e.g. in one strip where the man's business is buying hair for use in wigs, he deals with a family who have forced all their children to sell their hair in order to raise enough funds for an Xbox. Some strips have shown him in positions of authority (such as a bailiff or security guard) or simply as an aggressive salesman - one strip had him exploiting a customer's pay per view porn habit in order to sell an outrageously expensive TV and sound system. The title of the strip comes from its description of the business involved, e.g. \\"We Buy Gold\\" or \\"We Give Money\\"; and the main character's habit of saying \\"We ...\\" in order to justify his actions as company policy. * We Three Kays ‚Äì A one-off strip featuring Peter Kay, Vernon Kay and Gorden Kaye in the roles of the Three Wise Men visiting the newborn Jesus during the Nativity. Despite Gorden's worries that he's not as famous as Peter and Vernon, he is gratified when Jesus asks him to recall his car accident from 1990. * Wee Radge Joe ‚Äì A short man who tends to make too much of an accident, misunderstanding or taunting from youngsters, ending in him getting beaten up as he won't \\"Let it go\\" or walk away when the other person involved (who is usually larger than him) is happy to do so. * Will Selfie ‚Äì A narcissistic young man obsessed with taking the perfect selfie, even to the extent of mutilating himself to look good in the pictures. His name appears to be based on that of author Will Self. * William's Pissed Wellingtons ‚Äì a young boy and his alcoholic wellington boots. The name is a pun on the UK children's TV cartoon series William's Wish Wellingtons. * Whinging Pom ‚Äì a stuffy, homesick English expatriate who unfavourably compares everything he experiences in Australia, including a beating meted out to him. * Whoops! Aisle Apocalypse ‚Äì a strip concerning a couple whose husband insists on buying food (and occasionally other items) from the discounted aisle in his local supermarket. As a result, the couple often end up eating food that is past its sell by date (and usually having already started to spoil) as well as often getting into fights with similar thrifty people. * Wolf Halls ‚Äì A middle-aged couple obsessed with wolves who appear to dislike another couple of a similar age, who appear to have an obsession with tigers. The two couples are oblivious that the daughter of the wolf couple and the son of the tiger couple are in a relationship (i.e. a modern take on Romeo and Juliet). * Wooly Wilfy Wichardson ‚Äì a man with a left-wing leaning (e.g. he tries to tell two other men to stop fighting in a pub) and a speech impediment (as suggested in the title) who had his own strip in an early issue of Viz, but has more recently appeared in other strips - for example, as a counsellor who tries to curb Spoilt Bastard's bad behaviour, but actually ends up spanking the obnoxious boy. * Xmas Perv - A one-off strip featuring Maxwell, a kinky Christmas pervert. Mrs Ottershaw makes an appearance, as does the \\"Ladies Fundamentals\\" shop, both featured in Archie McBlarter's Farting Dilemmas. * Yankee Dougal ‚Äì an English kid who thinks he is American. He eventually gains US citizenship, and is drafted to serve in the Vietnam War. * Young Bailey ‚Äì A one-off strip featuring a schoolboy who looks and behaves like Rumpole of the Bailey. He argues constantly with his parents and teachers over trivial points and shouts \\"Objection!\\" while being caned by the headmaster. The original Young Bailey is a character in Dickens' Martin Chuzzlewit. * Young Max and his Celebrity Pervert House of Wax ‚Äì a schoolboy who owns a wax museum where all the exhibits are of celebrities convicted of child molestation. * Young Stan, Son of Man ‚Äì A young boy who blesses his family, says \\"verily\\" a lot, blesses the bread at breakfast, and moves (i.e., walks) in a mysterious way. An irritation to his mother. * Zip o' Lightning ‚Äì a strip about a young boy who believes he has an alien friend, who is actually a robber with a bucket on his head.

The song appeared on Rush's eleventh studio album Power Windows in 1985. \\"Manhattan Project\\" is the third track on the album and clocks in at 5:07. Despite not being released as a single, it did reach #10 on the U.S. Mainstream Rock Chart. Lyricist Neil Peart read \\"a pile of books\\" about the Manhattan Project before writing the lyrics so that he had a proper understanding of what the project was really about. The song consists of four verses, addressing the following: #A time, during the era of World War II, #A man, representing J. Robert Oppenheimer and other scientists around the world who were engaged in nuclear weapons research, #A place, the Los Alamos facility in New Mexico at which American scientists carried out their work, #A man, Paul Tibbets, pilot of the bomber Enola Gay that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. The chorus refers to the explosion as \\"the big bang\\", in allusion to the start of a new universe following the singular event, although the absolute reference is the use of Fat Man and Little Boy, America's two nuclear bombs to bring an end to the Pacific conflict with Japan (\\"shot down the rising sun\\"), which only happened after both were dropped, repeating the theme of the verses marking when and/or where \\"it all began.\\" The remaining lines refer to the start of the Atomic Age and the reactions of different segments of the global population (\\"the big shots,\\" \\"the fools,\\" \\"the hopeful,\\" \\"the hopeless\\").  Live performances  Rush performed the song live on their Power Windows Tour, Hold Your Fire Tour, and Presto Tour before it was dropped. It was brought back live over twenty years later on the Clockwork Angels Tour where the band played it with a string ensemble. Live performances of the song are included on the A Show of Hands concert film, the live album of the same name, and on the Clockwork Angels Tour live album and concert film. An additional live performance (recorded during the Presto Tour) is included in the bonus material on the home media release of Time Stand Still, a 2016 documentary about the band's R40 Live Tour.

Their music has been classified as garage rock, garage punk, gothic rock, shoegazing and post-punk revival. The band have released five studio albums: Strange House (2007), Primary Colours (2009), Skying (2011), Luminous (2014) and V (2017) all of which charted within the UK Top 40. History=Origins (2005‚Äì2006) In the early 2000s, the Horrors coalesced around shared interests in obscure vinyl and DJing. During trips to London and on the Southend circuit, Webb met Badwan (formerly of the Rotters) and Furse through their mutual interest in 1960s garage rock and new wave as well as post-punk bands such as the Birthday Party and Bauhaus. In 2005, the three formed a band with Hayward and Spurgeon. The band was centred around Junkclub, an underground club founded by Webb and Oliver Abbott. Their first rehearsal consisted of two covers: the Sonics' \\"The Witch\\" and Screaming Lord Sutch's \\"Jack the Ripper\\" (interpreted in the tradition of previous garage covers such as those by the Fuzztones, One-Way Streets and the Gruesomes). The latter rendition was later rerecorded as the opening track of their debut album, Strange House.Stool Pigeon magazine, April 2007. The Horrors made their first live performance at The Spread Eagle on Kingsland Road in London on 16 August 2005. The Horrors drew the attention of critics and the public with their debut single, \\"Sheena Is a Parasite\\". Their second release, \\"Death at the Chapel\\", a high-profile show at London's 100 Club in July 2006, and an appearance on the cover of NME that August greatly increased their profile. The band played the NME Awards Indie Rock Tour in early 2007 along with Mumm-Ra, the View and the Automatic, which helped garner further notoriety. Strange House (2007‚Äì2008) After the release of Strange House in March 2007, the Horrors embarked on an 18-month promotional world tour. A slot supporting Black Rebel Motorcycle Club in the United States in summer 2007 was cancelled because of lack of funds, but the band instead headlined a US tour that June. They made a number of festival appearances throughout 2007, including the Glastonbury Festival, the Carling Weekend (on the Radio 1/NME stage), various Scandinavian festivals, the Summer Sonic Festival in Japan and Splendour in the Grass in Australia. Their setlists throughout that summer included a cover of \\"No Love Lost\\" by Joy Division. In December 2007, they featured in the All Tomorrows Parties festival curated by Geoff Barrow of Portishead. The Horrors also appeared in the third series of The Mighty Boosh in December as the fictional band \\"the Black Tubes\\", and supported the Arctic Monkeys on their short sellout tour of the UK, receiving a mixed reception. The band played an NME Awards show in 2008 with Crystal Castles, Ulterior and These New Puritans, and supported the Sonics on 23 March. Another London show followed at Bethnal Green's Rich Mix Cultural Foundation on 23 May of the following year. On 18 January 2008, Counting in Fives, a documentary of the band's 2007 US tour, was unveiled at the Sundance Film Festival. Eventually, Strange House reached No. 37 on the UK Albums Chart. Following the \\"She Is the New Thing\\" single release in June 2007, the band recorded a cover of Suicide's \\"Shadazz\\" for Blast First Petite as part of their tribute to Alan Vega in October 2008, their only release before their new material in 2009. Primary Colours (2009‚Äì2010) At the end of 2007, the Horrors announced the forthcoming recording of a new album, which was produced by the band, Craig Silvey, Barrow and music video director Chris Cunningham. Recording took place in Bath during the summer of 2008. Barrow's influence brought the use of keyboards and electronics. The band were forced to pull out of their planned appearance at the Underage Festival due to recording schedule conflicts. After they left Loog Records in 2007, the band signed to XL Recordings. A number of songs from the new album were leaked a few weeks before the album's release. The album's first single, \\"Sea Within a Sea\\", was released only as a digital download on 17 March 2009, together with a music video directed by Douglas Hart which was posted on the band's website on the same day. Their second album, Primary Colours, was officially released on 4 May 2009 to critical acclaim, and reached No. 25 on the UK Albums Chart. The single \\"Who Can Say\\" was released on 7\\" vinyl one week later. Primary Colours was nominated for the 2009 Mercury Prize. NME later awarded the album first place in the 50 Best Albums of 2009. After headlining London's Offset Festival and touring for Primary Colours, the Horrors indicated a desire to build their own studio to record at obscure hours. Skying (2011‚Äì2012) In April 2010, singer Badwan announced on the band's official forum that the Horrors had already started working on their third album, to be called Skying, and had been in the studio for some months. A track from the album, \\"Endless Blue\\", was first unveiled at the Latitude Festival in July 2010, and later performed at Poland's Off Festival and Belgium's Lokerse Feesten in August 2010. In February 2011, after rumours that the album had been delayed, Badwan announced via the official forum that the album would be released in July. The first single, \\"Still Life\\", premiered on 24 May on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show. The full album was made available for streaming from the band's website on 4 July, and officially released on 11 July 2011. The band were announced as headliners on the Festival Republic Stage at the Reading and Leeds festivals in August 2011. They were joined on stage by the Vaccines, whose guitarist is Tom Furse's younger brother Freddie Cowan; Tom Furse had also joined the Vaccines on stage earlier on the same day. They were also chosen to perform at the ATP I'll Be Your Mirror festival curated by ATP and Portishead in September 2011 in Asbury Park, New Jersey. The band joined Florence and The Machine on the UK and Ireland leg of her Ceremonials Tour in March 2012. The band also headlined the Word Arena tent of 2012's Latitude Festival. In December 2012, the Horrors released the remix vinyl box set Higher.  Luminous (2013‚Äì2014) The Horrors headlined the Y Not Festival in Derbyshire on 4 August 2013. and the Truck Festival in Oxfordshire on 19 July 2013. The band's fourth studio album, Luminous, was released on 5 May 2014. The record was self-produced and recorded in their own studio in Hackney, London. It was described as being \\"fun and danceable\\".  V (2015‚Äìpresent)  In June 2015, Badwan said that the band were working on an album with producer Paul Epworth, and were aiming to release it before the end of 2015. They supported New Order in November 2015, and played several festivals in 2016, including the Victorious Festival in Portsmouth, UK on 28 August.

A good example of a meydan can be seen in Ohrid, North Macedonia. On two sides of the meydan in Ohrid, there are two mosques. In the centre of the meydan there is a √ßinar (plane tree) to shade one from the heat. There are places to sit and there is water to drink. One can deduce from the historical existence of the water source, the reason for existence of both the √ßinar and the meydan. The √ßinar is said to be 900 years old. From this we may deduce that the meydan already existed at least 500 years before the arrival of the Ottomans. There is an interesting literary insight into the function of the meydan in Birds Without Wings by Englishman, Louis de Berni√®res.

It lives on the island Nosy B√© in the Antsiranana province of Madagascar, and on the mainland near the village of Manehoka, including Lokobe Reserve. The scientific type name, mamiratra, comes from Malagasy and means \\"clear and bright\\"; this refers the Theodore F. and Claire M. Hubbard Family Foundation, which has contributed to genetic research on Madagascar. This species is closely related to another new species, \\"M. species nova # 5\\"; which is related to the Sambirano mouse lemur, Microcebus sambiranensis, and the northern rufous mouse lemur, Microcebus tavaratra. This lemur is, with a weight of 60 g, average for its genus. The fur of the upper part is reddish- brown and becomes darker in the middle of the back. The tail is also reddish- brown, but the underbelly is white or creamy. It has a total length of 26 to 28 centimeters, including 15 to 17 centimeters of tail. The species status of Claire's mouse lemur has been recently challenged by a broad study of nuclear DNA and gene trees in mouse lemurs. Results showed that although the mitochondrial DNA differed from that of the Sambirano mouse lemur, its nuclear DNA did not. This is likely due to female philopatry. Since females stay close to the home range in which they were born, mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited from the mother, is likely to remain similar within a small area while nuclear DNA within a species is likely to be similar over a much larger area. According to the study, this is the case for Claire's mouse lemur. For this reason, it was suggested that Claire's mouse lemur no longer be recognized as a distinct species.

On an international level, a garden with tulips is also easily labelled as a Dutch garden. In England, Dutch garden was the description given to a particular type of rectangular garden space, often enclosed within hedges or walls, even if part of a larger garden or parkland. This space would be laid out in a highly cultivated and geometrical, often symmetrical, fashion, shaped by dense plantings of highly coloured flowers, and edged with box or other dense and clipped shrubs, or low walls (sometimes in geometrical patterns), and sometimes, also, with areas of artificial water, with fountains and water butts, which were also laid out in symmetrical arrangements. The flower beds and areas of water would be intersected by geometrical path patterns, to make it possible to walk around the garden without damaging any of its features. An example is to be found adjacent to Kensington Palace, due south of the orangery. Another example, less ambitious, is at Clandon Park in Surrey. The Dutch garden, with its geometry and formality, was in opposition to the cottage garden, which is characterised by grass, winding and asymmetrical paths (if any) and a blurring of the lines between flowers and grass by allowing shrubs to grow over flower bed boundaries. The placement of flowers and shrubs in the Dutch garden in Holland, however, may be non-linear and informal, though still efficiently making use of space and light. Because the Netherlands is one of the most densely populated countries, gardens are generally small and because houses are placed right next to each other, there is not very much light available. Because of these restrictions, the distinctive style of garden design associated with the Dutch emerged.

He, along with Des Ramsay, became a Coach at the club at the end of the Second World War. David Theile was initially coached by Ramsay, but soon switched to Cusack, even though Cusack was thought to be a difficult coach by many swimmers, as he would require long, tiring sessions in the pool. In 1958, Cusack left Maryborough.Walker, Douglas, History Maryborough Swimming Club, Maryborough Swimming Club Inc website (accessed 11 January 2008) In 1962, Cusack was appointed as a coach on the Australian 1962 Commonwealth Games team in Perth.Australian Commonwealth Games Association, Officials List 1962,(accessed 11 January 2008) In the mid-60s, Cusack took over the lease of the Centenary Pool in Brisbane.

New turning technique Arthur Cusack introduced a backstroke turn and a bent-arm stroke to assist David Theile in his quest for Olympic gold. This new turning technique was seen as suspect by some officials during the heats of the 100m backstroke at the 1956 Olympics, who wanted Theile to give a demonstration for their review, a request Cusack refused. The turn was not subsequently used by Thiele during the final, but during the 1957 Queensland Championships, Theile was disqualified for the only time in his career when officials ruled that the turning style was illegal. This turning style was soon adopted by other swimmers, and is still used today. Awards and recognition Cusack was a member of the Australian Olympic Committee for many years.

See Panzer Elite Action: Fields of Glory.  Campaigns  There are three campaigns The German, The Russian and The American campaign. In all these campaigns a user is given command of a WW 2 tank (belonging to the type of army). The user is given a task that involves tank fighting, taking out artillery and strafing infantry. The user has to drive the tank and use the primary as well as the secondary armament. There are frequent ammo reload and repair points in the game. Sometimes a user is given a command of tank squadron. One can use these squadrons for offensive (flanking attack) and defensive (holding the position) purposes. You start out as the Germans with two missions involving the invasion of Poland in 1939. They are fairly easy, since the German tanks were far superior to any other tanks or weapons at that point in time. After the Poland missions, you have a mission against the French in Belgium. The difficulty begins to rise as the French had better tanks than the Poles and they also make use of anti-tank guns. Then, you have a mission as part of Operation Barbarossa, where you are part of the army advancing towards Moscow. Then you come to the final German mission: the attack on Stalingrad. For the first time, you get to use a Tiger tank and you also face more powerful Soviet tanks. After the German Campaign there is the Russian campaign. In the first mission, you have to cross the Volga and complete the encirclement of Stalingrad. In the next mission, you have to stop the German's Operation Winter Storm by destroying a heavily armored supply train. And then you get to go into Stalingrad and root out the Germans in the Red Square there. The next Russian mission is to stop the initial push of the German at Kursk in July 1943. After, that you get in a German Panther tank and sneak behind the German lines to rescue some Russian POWs. And then you have to destroy the German's last all-out attempt to win the battle of Kursk. After defending the Motherland, you get into a Sherman and land on Utah Beach, where you have to clear the bunkers and advance to St. Mere Eglise. Then you get to drive around the Bocage and destroy some V-2 rockets. And after that, you get Operation Cobra, where you have destroy some artillery. The next mission is probably one of the hardest. You go up against nothing but Tigers, and you have to get the tank ace named Michael Wittmann. Following that, you join the 3rd Army and drive like hell up to Bastogne to rescue the 101st Airborne in the Battle of the Bulge. Next you get to go in a King Tiger and sneak behind enemy lines again. And the last mission is the drive to and crossing of the Rhine, where you have to break through to the river and get over before the bridge is blown up.

This was the first toll point encountered along the Bath Road, upon leaving London. Turnpike trusts were bodies set up by individual acts of Parliament, with powers to collect road tolls for maintaining the principal roads in Britain from the 17th but especially during the 18th and 19th centuries. At the peak, in the 1830s, over 1,000 trustsParliamentary Papers, 1840, Vol 280 xxvii. administered around of turnpike road in England and Wales, taking tolls at almost 8,000 toll-gates and side-bars. During the early 19th century the concept of the turnpike trust was adopted and adapted to manage roads within the British Empire (Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, and South Africa) and in the United States. Turnpikes declined with the coming of the railways and then the Local Government Act 1888 gave responsibility for maintaining main roads to county councils and county borough councils. Etymology Chevaux de frise, Siege of Petersburg, American Civil War The term \\"turnpike\\" originates from the similarity of the gate used to control access to the road, to the barriers once used to defend against attack by cavalry (see Cheval de frise). The turnpike consisted of a row of pikes or bars, each sharpened at one end, and attached to horizontal members which were secured at one end to an upright pole or axle, which could be rotated to open or close the gate. Precursors to turnpike trusts Great North Road near Highgate on the approach to London before turnpiking. The highway was deeply rutted and spread onto adjoining land. Pavage grants, originally made for paving the marketplace or streets of towns, began also to be used for maintaining some roads between towns in the 14th century. These grants were made by letters patent, almost invariably for a limited term, presumably the time likely to be required to pay for the required works. Tudor statutes had placed responsibility on each parish vestry to maintain all its roads. This arrangement was adequate for roads that the parishioners used themselves but proved unsatisfactory for the principal highways that were used by long-distance travellers and waggoners. During the late 17th century, the piecemeal approach to road maintenance caused acute problems on the main routes into London. As trade increased, the growing numbers of heavy carts and carriages led to serious deterioration in the state of these roads and this could not be remedied by the use of parish statute labour. A parliamentary bill was tabled in 1621/22 to relieve the parishes responsible for part of the Great North Road by imposing a scale of tolls on various sorts of traffic. The toll revenue was to be used in repairing the road, however, the bill was defeated. During the following forty years, the idea of making travellers contribute to the repair of roads was raised on several occasions.Records of Turnpike Trusts National Archive. Accessdate 6 December 2012 Many parishes continued to struggle to find funds to repair major roads and in Hertfordshire, way wardens on behalf of the vestries stood frequent trial at quarter sessions for their failure to keep the Old North Road in a good state of repair. In 1656 the parish of Radwell, Hertfordshire petitioned their local sessions for help to maintain their section of the Great North Road. Probably as a result judges on the Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire circuit represented the matter to Parliament.Webb. English Local Government. pp. 157‚Äì159 It then passed an act that gave the local justices of the peace powers to erect toll-gates on a section of the road, between Wadesmill, Hertfordshire; Caxton, Cambridgeshire; and Stilton, Huntingdonshire for 11 years, the revenues so raised to be used for the maintenance of the road in their jurisdictions.Statute, 15 Car. II, c.1. The toll-gate erected at Wadesmill was the prototype in England. Parliament then gave similar powers to the justices in other counties in England and Wales. An example is the first Turnpike Act for Surrey in 1696, during the reign of William III for enhanced repairs between Reigate in Surrey and Crawley in Sussex.Turnpike Trusts: County Reports of the Secretary. p. 4. The act made provision to erect turnpikes, and appoint toll collectors; also to appoint surveyors, who were authorized by order of the justices to borrow money at five per cent interest, on security of the tolls. The first turnpike trusts Fyfield Turnpike Trust on the Great Road to Gloucester in 1738 The first scheme that had trustees who were not justices was established through a Turnpike Act in 1707, for a section of the London-Chester road between Fornhill (near Hockliffe) and Stony Stratford. The basic principle was that the trustees would manage resources from the several parishes through which the highway passed, augment this with tolls from users from outside the parishes and apply the whole to the maintenance of the main highway. This became the pattern for the turnpiking of a growing number of highways, sought by those who wished to improve flow of commerce through their part of a county. The proposal to turnpike a particular section of road was normally a local initiative and a separate Act of Parliament was required to create each trust. The Act gave the trustees responsibility for maintaining a specified part of the existing highway. It provided them with powers to achieve this; the right to collect tolls from those using the road was particularly important. Local gentlemen, clergy and merchants were nominated as trustees and they appointed a clerk, a treasurer and a surveyor to actually administer and maintain the highway. These officers were paid by the trust. Trustees were not paid, though they derived indirect benefits from the better transport, which improved access to markets and led to increases in rental income and trade.Webb. English Local Government. pp. 159-165 The first action of a new trust was to erect turnpike gates at which a fixed toll was charged. The Act gave a maximum toll allowable for each class of vehicle or animal ‚Äì for instance one shilling and six pence for a coach pulled by four horses, a penny for an unladen horse and ten pence for a drove of 20 cows. The trustees could call on a portion of the statute duty from the parishes, either as labour or by a cash payment. The trust applied the income to pay for labour and materials to maintain the road. They were also able to mortgage future tolls to raise loans for new structures and for more substantial improvements to the existing highway. Map of the Turnpike Tollgates in London 1801. The trusts applied some funds to erecting tollhouses that accommodated the pikeman or toll-collector beside the turnpike gate. Although trusts initially organised the collection of tolls directly, it became common for them to auction a lease to collect tolls. Specialist toll- farmers would make a fixed payment to the trust for the lease and then organise the day-to-day collection of the money, leaving themselves with a profit on their operations over a year. The powers of a trust were limited, normally to 21 years, after which it was assumed that the responsibility for the now-improved road would be handed back to the parishes. However, trusts routinely sought new powers before this time limit, usually citing the need to pay off the debts incurred in repairing damage caused by a rising volume of traffic, or in building new sections of road. The growth of the turnpike system Woodstock to Rollright Turnpike Trust on the Great Road to Worcester in 1751 During the first three decades of the 18th century, sections of the main radial roads into London were put under the control of individual turnpike trusts. The pace at which new turnpikes were created picked up in the 1750s as trusts were formed to maintain the cross-routes between the Great Roads radiating from London. Roads leading into some provincial towns, particularly in Western England, were put under single trusts and key roads in Wales were turnpiked. In South Wales, the roads of complete counties were put under single turnpike trusts in the 1760s. A further surge of trust formation occurred in the 1770s, with the turnpiking of subsidiary connecting roads, routes over new bridges, new routes in the growing industrial areas and roads in Scotland. About 150 trusts were established by 1750; by 1772 a further 400 were established and, in 1800, there were over 700 trusts. In 1825 about 1,000 trusts controlled of road in England and Wales.Hampshire Maps University of Portsmouth. Accessdate 6 December 2012 Roadside sign marking boundary between parish and turnpike trust responsibility, Christchurch Road East, Frome, SomersetThe Acts for these new trusts and the renewal Acts for the earlier trusts incorporated a growing list of powers and responsibilities. From the 1750s, Acts required trusts to erect milestones indicating the distance between the main towns on the road. Users of the road were obliged to follow what were to become rules of the road, such as driving on the left and not damaging the road surface. Trusts could take additional tolls during the summer to pay for watering the road in order to lay the dust thrown up by fast-moving vehicles. Parliament also passed a few general Turnpike Acts dealing with the administration of the trusts and restrictions on the width of wheels ‚Äì narrow wheels were said to cause a disproportionate amount of damage to the road. The rate at which new trusts were created slowed in the early 19th century but the existing trusts were making major investments in highway improvement. The government had been directly involved in the building of military roads in Scotland following a rebellion in 1745, but the first national initiative was a scheme to aid communications with Ireland. Between 1815 and 1826 Thomas Telford undertook a major reorganization of the existing trusts along the London to Holyhead Road, and the construction of large sections of new road to avoid hindrances, particularly in North Wales. By 1838 the turnpike trusts in England were collecting ¬£1.5 million per year from leasing the collection of tolls but had a cumulative debt of ¬£7 million, mainly as mortgages.Parliamentary Papers, 1840, Vol 289 Even at its greatest extent, the turnpike system only administered a fifth of the roads in Britain; the majority being maintained by the parishes. A trust would typically be responsible for about of highway, although exceptions such as the Exeter Turnpike Trust controlled of roads radiating from the city. On the Bath Road for instance, a traveller from London to the head of the Thames Valley in Wiltshire would pass through the jurisdiction of seven trusts, paying a toll at the gates of each. Although a few trusts built new bridges (e.g. at Shillingford over the Thames), most bridges remained a county responsibility. A few bridges were built with private funds and tolls taken at these (e.g., the present Swinford Toll Bridge over the Thames). Operation of turnpike trusts=Quality The Round House (Old Toll House) at Stanton Drew The quality of early turnpike roads was varied.Parliamentary Papers, 1840, Vol 256 xxvii. Although turnpiking did result in some improvement to each highway, the technologies used to deal with geological features, drainage, and the effects of weather, were all in their infancy. Road construction improved slowly, initially through the efforts of individual surveyors such as John Metcalf in Yorkshire in the 1760s. 19th-century engineers made great advances, notably Thomas Telford and John Loudon McAdam. The Turnpike Trust Schools History.org, Accessed July 2011 The engineering work of Telford on the Holyhead Road (now the A5) in the 1820s reduced the journey time of the London mail coach from 45 hours to just 27 hours, and the best mail coach speeds rose from 5-6 mph (8‚Äì10 km/h) to 9-10 mph (14‚Äì16 km/h). McAdam and his sons were employed as general surveyors (consultant engineers) to many of the main turnpike trusts in southern England. They recommended the building of new sections of road to avoid obstructions, eased steep slopes and directed the relaying of existing road-beds with carefully graded stones to create a dry, fast-running surface (known as Macadamising). Coach design improved to take advantage of these better roads and in 1843 the London-to-Exeter mail coach could complete the 170-mile (270-km) journey in 17 hours. Social impact The introduction of toll gates had been resented by local communities which had freely used the routes for centuries. Early Acts had given magistrates powers to punish anyone damaging turnpike property, such as defacing milestones, breaking turnpike gates or avoiding tolls. Opposition was particularly intense in mountainous regions where good routes were scarce. In Mid Wales in 1839, new tolls on old roads sparked protests known as the Rebecca Riots. There were sporadic outbursts of vandalism and violent confrontation by gangs of 50 to 100 or more local men, and gatekeepers were told that if they resisted they would be killed. In 1844, the ringleaders were caught and transported to Australia as convicts.The Rebecca Riots Powys Digital History Project However, the result was that toll gates were dismantled and the trusts abolished in the six counties of South Wales, their powers being transferred to a roads board for each county. The end of the system By the early Victorian period toll gates were perceived as an impediment to free trade. The multitude of small trusts were frequently charged with being inefficient in use of resources and potentially suffered from petty corruption. The railway era spelt disaster for most turnpike trusts. Although some trusts in districts not served by railways managed to increase revenue, most did not. In 1829, the year before the Liverpool and Manchester Railway opened, the Warrington and Lower Irlam Trust had receipts of ¬£1,680 but, by 1834, this had fallen to ¬£332. The Bolton and Blackburn Trust had an income of ¬£3,998 in 1846, but in 1847 following the completion of a railway between the two towns, this had fallen to ¬£3,077 and, in 1849, ¬£1,185. The debts of many trusts became significant; forced mergers of solvent and debt-laden trusts became frequent, and by the 1870s it was feasible for Parliament to close the trusts progressively without leaving an unacceptable financial burden on local communities. From 1871, all applications for renewal were sent to a Turnpike Trust Commission. This arranged for existing Acts to continue, but with the objective of discharging the debt, and returning the roads to local administration, which was by then by highway boards. The Local Government Act 1888 gave responsibility for maintaining main roads to county councils and county borough councils. When a trust was ended, there were often great celebrations as the gates were thrown open. The assets of the trust, such as tollhouses, gates and sections of surplus land beside the road were auctioned off to reduce the debt, and mortgagees were paid at whatever rate in the pound the funds would allow. The legacy of the turnpike trust is the network of roads that still form the framework of the main road system in Britain. In addition, many roadside features such as milestones and tollhouses have survived, despite no longer having any function in the modern road management system.

It is 628 metres (2,060 feet) high and in shape resembles the upturned hull of a boat or a barrow. Yewbarrow is on the left in the classic view of Great Gable and Wast Water. The top of Stirrup Crag forms a second summit 616 metres (2,021 feet) high, half a mile north of the main summit. The Hewitt and Nuttall lists classify the Yewbarrow North Top as a separate summit. The name is derived from the past prevalence of yew trees on the fell and its \\"barrow\\" shape. Topography The Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the north-east and Wasdale to the south-east. Westwards the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumberland. At the central hub of the high country are Great Gable and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of Ennerdale, the western fells in effect being a great horseshoe around this long wild valley.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Volume 7 The Western Fells: Westmorland Gazette (1966): Yewbarrow is an outlier of the southern arm. The main watershed runs broadly westwards from Great Gable, dividing the headwaters of Ennerdale and Wasdale. Travelling in this direction the principal hills are Kirk Fell, Pillar, Scoat Fell, Haycock and Caw Fell. Scoat Fell throws out a long southern ridge terminating in Yewbarrow, with Red Pike standing part way along. The southern end of Yewbarrow rises steeply from the shore of Wastwater, the crest of the fell running a little east of north for about two miles. Just beyond the second top, the ridge swings sharply to the west at the depression of Dore Head (475 m. / 1,560 ft) continuing then onto Red Pike. The strath of Wasdale Head forms the eastern boundary of the fell with the quiet valley of Over Beck to the west. The ridge-top is rimmed by crags, particularly above Over Beck, and at either end. Stirrup Crag lies below the north summit, sometimes lending its name to the top, while Dropping Crag and Bell Rib guard the southern end of the crest. Geology The summit is formed from the tuff, lapilli-tuff and breccia of the Lingmell Formation. The eastern slopes display the rhyolitic rocks of the Long Top Member and Crinkle Member. The crags on the western face are outcrops of the plagioclase-phyric andesite lavas of the Birker Fell Formation.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 38: BGS (1998) Ascents The northern face of Yewbarrow as seen from the slopes of Pillar The view from the cairn put up by the Westmorland Brothers to the SW of the summit of Great Gable, showing Yewbarrow in right centre. Although smaller than the other fells surrounding Wasdale Head ‚Äî Scafell Pike, Scafell, Great Gable, Kirk Fell and Pillar ‚Äî the ascent of Yewbarrow by the two traditional routes involves some scrambling. There are two primary ascents to Yewbarrow from Wasdale Head, via Overbeck Bridge and the Great Door (a cleft in the rocks providing thrilling views of Wast Water) or via Dore Head and Stirrup Crag. It is possible to circumvent almost all the scrambling on the route via Great Door by taking a path to the left of the major gully, and a cairned track without any scrambling runs up the west side from below Stirrup Crag to the minor col between the two tops of Yewbarrow. It can also be climbed as part of the Mosedale Horseshoe, which can start or end at Yewbarrow and also includes Red Pike, Scoat Fell, Steeple and Pillar.Bill Birkett:Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): Summit The summit bears a cairn set on grass, perhaps a surprise after the rough ascent.

Modern anti-Armenianism is usually expressed by opposition to the actions or existence of Armenia, aggressive denial of the Armenian Genocide or belief in an Armenian conspiracy to fabricate history and manipulate public and political opinion for political gain.Black Garden, by Thomas De Waal (Aug 25, 2004), page 42 Turkey Of this photo, the United States ambassador wrote, \\"Scenes like this were common throughout the Armenian provinces, in the spring and summer months of 1915. Death in its several forms‚Äîmassacre, starvation, exhaustion‚Äîdestroyed the larger part of the refugees. The Turkish policy was that of extermination under the guise of deportation.\\" Armenian Genocide and its denial Although it was possible for Armenians to achieve status and wealth in the Ottoman Empire, as a community they were never accorded more than \\"second- class citizen\\" status and were regarded as fundamentally alien to the Muslim character of Ottoman society.Communal Violence: The Armenians and the Copts as Case Studies, by Margaret J. Wyszomirsky, World Politics, Vol. 27, No. 3 (Apr., 1975), p. 438 In 1895, revolts among the Armenian subjects of the Ottoman Empire led to Sultan Abd√ºl Hamid's decision to massacre tens of thousands of Armenians in the Hamidian massacres.Hamidian Massacres, Armenian Genocide.

The survey showed an unfavorable stance toward Armenians was \\"relatively more widespread among those participants with lower levels of education and socioeconomic status.\\" According to Minority Rights Group, while the government recognizes Armenians as a minority group, as used in Turkey this term denotes second- class status. The Ankara Chamber of Commerce included a documentary, accusing the Armenian people of slaughtering Turks, with its paid tourism advertisements in the June 6, 2005 edition of the magazine Time Europe. The magazine later apologized for allowing the inclusion of the DVDs and published a critical letter signed by five French organizations.\\"In Turkey, a Clash of Nationalism and History,\\" The Washington Post, 2005-09-29 The February 12, 2007 edition of Time Europe included an acknowledgment of the truth of the Armenian Genocide and a DVD of a documentary by French director Laurence Jourdan about the genocide.. Hrant Dink, the editor of the weekly bilingual newspaper Agos, was assassinated in Istanbul on January 19, 2007, by Og√ºn Samast, who was reportedly acting on the orders of Yasin Hayal, a militant Turkish ultra-nationalist. For his statements on Armenian identity and the Armenian Genocide, Dink had been prosecuted three times under Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code for ‚Äúinsulting Turkishness.‚Äù (The law was later amended by the Turkish parliament, changing \\"Turkishness\\" to \\"Turkish Nation\\" and making it more difficult to prosecute individuals for the said offense.) Dink had also received numerous death threats from Turkish nationalists who viewed his \\"iconoclastic\\" journalism (particularly regarding the Armenian Genocide) as an act of treachery. ƒ∞brahim ≈ûahin and 36 other alleged members of Turkish ultra-nationalist Ergenekon group were arrested in January, 2009 in Ankara. The Turkish police said the roundup was triggered by orders ≈ûahin gave to assassinate 12 Armenian community leaders in Sivas.Turkish police uncover arms cache, The Wall Street Journal, Jan. 10, 2009 According to the official investigation in Turkey, Ergenekon also had a role in the murder of Hrant Dink. Accounts of hate speech towards targeted groups in Turkish news outlets with Armenians shown as being targeted the most according to a January‚ÄìApril 2014 Media Watch on Hate Speech and Discriminatory Language Report. In 2002, a monument was erected in memory of Turkish-Armenian composer Onno Tun√ß in Yalova, Turkey. The monument to the composer of Armenian origin was subjected to much vandalism over the course of the years, in which unidentified people had taken out the letters on the monument. In 2012 Yalova Municipal Assembly decided to remove the monument. Bilgin Ko√ßal, the former mayor of Yalova, informed the public that the memorial had been destroyed by time and that it would shortly be replaced with a new one in the memory of Tun√ß. On the other hand, a similar memorial stays in place at the village of Selimiye, where an aircraft had crashed; and the people in the village of 187 expressed their protest about the vandalism claims regarding the memorial in Yalova, adding that they paid from their own funds to keep up the maintenance of the monument in their village against the wearing effect of natural causes. Sevag Balikci, a Turkish soldier of Armenian descent, was shot dead on April 24, 2011, the day of the commemoration of the Armenian Genocide during his military service in Batman. It was later discovered that killer Kƒ±van√ß Aƒüaoƒülu was an ultra- nationalist. Through his Facebook profile, it was uncovered that he was a sympathizer of nationalist politician Muhsin Yazƒ±cƒ±oƒülu and Turkish agent / contract killer Abdullah √áatlƒ±, who himself had a history of anti-Armenian activity, such as the Armenian Genocide Memorial bombing in a Paris suburb in 1984. His Facebook profile also showed that he was a Great Union Party (BBP) sympathizer, a far-right nationalist party in Turkey. Testimony given by Sevag Balƒ±k√ßƒ±'s fianc√©e stated that he was subjected to psychological pressure at the military compound. She was told by Sevag over the phone that he feared for his life because a certain military serviceman threatened him by saying, \\"If war were to happen with Armenia, you would be the first person I would kill.\\" On February 26, 2012, on the anniversary of the Khojaly Massacre a demonstration took place in Istanbul which contained hate speech and threats towards Armenia and Armenians. Chants and slogans during the demonstration include: \\"You are all Armenian, you are all bastards,\\" \\"bastards of Hrant [Dink] can not scare us,\\" and \\"Taksim Square today, Yerevan Tomorrow: We will descend upon you suddenly in the night.\\" In 2012 the ultra-nationalist ASIM- DER group (founded in 2002) had targeted Armenian schools, churches, foundations and individuals in Turkey as part of an anti-Armenian hate campaign. On 23 February 2014, a group of protestors carrying a banner that said, \\"Long live the Ogun Samasts! Down with Hrant Dink!\\" went in front of an Armenian school in Istanbul and later walked in front of the main building of the Agos newspaper, the same location where Hrant Dink was assassinated in 2007. On 5 August 2014, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, in a televised interview on NTV news network, remarked that being Armenian is \\"uglier\\" even than being Georgian, saying \\"You wouldn't believe the things they have said about me. They have said I am Georgian...they have said even uglier things - they have called me Armenian, but I am Turkish.\\" In February 2015, graffiti was discovered near the wall of an Armenian church in the Kadikoy district of Istanbul saying, \\"You‚Äôre Either Turkish or Bastards\\" and \\"You Are All Armenian, All Bastards.\\" It is claimed that the graffiti was done by organizing members of a rally entitled \\"Demonstrations Condemning the Khojali Genocide and Armenian Terror.\\" The Human Rights Association of Turkey petitioned the local government of Istanbul calling it a \\"Pretext to Incite Ethnic Hate Against Armenians in Turkey\\". In the same month banners celebrating the Armenian Genocide were spotted in several cities throughout Turkey. They declared: \\"We celebrate the 100th anniversary of our country being cleansed of Armenians. We are proud of our glorious ancestors.\\" On 20 February 2015, the Mayor of Bayburt Mete Memis called the deeds of Turkish soldiers who massacred Armenians a hundred years ago \\"heroism.\\" He made a congratulatory statement on the 97th anniversary of Bayburt's sacking, in which its Armenian resident were massacred and exiled as part of the Armenian Genocide, claiming that 97 years ago, the Turkish soldiers in Bayburt had \\"written their name in history for defending the homeland.\\" In March 2015, the mayor of Ankara, Melih G√∂k√ßek, filed a formal complaint on defamation charges against journalist Hayko Baƒüdat because he called him an Armenian. The complaint petitioned that the statements by the journalist are \\"false and include insult and libel.\\" G√∂k√ßek also demanded 10,000 liras in compensation under a civil lawsuit against Baƒüdat for psychological damages, and the lawsuit is now pending. During the official state funeral of Turkish serviceman Olgun Karakoyunlu, a man exclaimed: \\"The PKK are all Armenians, but are hiding. I am Kurdish and a Muslim, but I am not an Armenian. The end of Armenians is near. God willingly, we will bring an end to them. Oh Armenians, whatever you do it is in vain, we know you well. Whatever you do will be in vain.\\" Similarly, in 2007, a state-appointed imam, presiding over a funeral of a Turkish soldier killed by the PKK, said that the death was due to \\"Armenian bastards.\\" In September 2015, during the Kurdish‚ÄìTurkish conflict, a video was released which captured police in Cizre announcing on a loudspeaker to the local Kurdish population that they were \\"Armenian bastards.\\" A few days later, in another instance, the Cizre police made repeated announcements on loudspeaker saying \\"You are all Armenians.\\" On 9 September 2015, a crowd of Turkish youth rallying in Armenian populated districts of Istanbul chanted \\"We must turn these districts into Armenian and Kurdish cemeteries.\\" In September 2015, a 'Welcome' sign was installed in Iƒüdƒ±r and written in four languages, Turkish, Kurdish, English, and Armenian. The Armenian portion of the sign was protested by ASIMDER who demanded its removal. In October 2015, the Armenian writing on the 'Welcome' sign was heavily vandalized. The Armenian portion of the sign was ultimately removed in June 2016. In April 2016, Barbaros Leylani, the head of the Turkish Worker's Union in Sweden, referred to Armenians as \\"dogs\\" in a public speech in Stockholm, and added: \\"Turks awaken! Armenian scums must be finished, die Armenian scums, die, die!\\" (external link of speech (in Turkish)) Juridikfronten, a Swedish watchdog organization, filed a report to the police due to an \\"incitement to racial hatred\\". Thereafter, Leylani resigned from his post. In August 2020 the statue of Komitas in Paris has been vandalized. The inscription \\"it is false\\" has been written in red ink on the plinth of the Armenian Genocide Memorial.French MP Valerie Boyer condemns the profanation of Komitas statue in Paris, by Siranush Ghazanchyan, Public Radio of Armenia, August 31, 2020Komitas statue vandalized in Paris, Panorama.am, August 31, 2020 Azerbaijan Anti-Armenianism exists in Azerbaijan on institutional Fyodor Lukyanov, Editor-in-Chief of the journal Russia in Global Affairs and social levels. Armenians are \\"the most vulnerable group in Azerbaijan in the field of racism and racial discrimination.\\" Throughout the 20th century, Armenians and Muslim inhabitants of the Caucasus (Azerbaijanis were called Caucasian or Azerbaijani Tatars before 1918) had been involved in numerous conflicts, including pogroms, massacres and wars. The two ethnic groups intensified \\"mutual distrust\\" and the clashes throughout the 20th century \\"have been significant factors in the shaping of the national self-consciousness of the two peoples.\\" From 1918 to 1920 organized killings of Armenians occurred in Azerbaijan, including in the cities of Baku and Shusha, the centers of Armenian cultural life under the Russian Empire. However, the current xenophobia in Azerbaijan toward Armenia and Armenians have shaped mostly during the last years of the Soviet Union, when Armenians demanded the Moscow authorities to incorporate the mostly Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast with the Armenian SSR. In response to Armenian claims, the Azerbaijani nationalists, most prominently the Azerbaijani Popular Front, organized pogroms of Armenians in Sumgait, Kirovabad and Baku. An estimated of 350,000 Armenians left \\"in two waves in 1988 and in 1990 after anti-Armenian violence.\\" The tensions eventually escalated into a large-scale military conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. The Armenian forces took control of most of former NKAO and seven adjacent districts outside of NKAO area. A cease-fire was reached in 1994 and is still in effect as the Republic of Artsakh is de facto independent, while de jure inside the Azerbaijani borders. Since then the Armenian side accuses the Azerbaijani government for carrying out anti-Armenian policy inside and outside the country, which includes propaganda of hate toward Armenia and Armenians and destruction of cultural heritage. In 2011, the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance report on Azerbaijan stated that \\"the constant negative official and media discourse concerning the Republic of Armenia helps to sustain a negative climate of opinion regarding people of Armenian origin, who remain vulnerable to discrimination.\\" Alt URL Russia A 19th-century Russian explorer, Vasili Lvovich Velichko, who was active during the period when the Russian tzarism carried out a purposeful anti- Armenian policy, wrote \\"Armenians are the extreme instance of brachycephaly; their actual racial instinct make them naturally hostile to the State.\\"Benthall, Jonathan (ed.), The best of Anthropology Today, 2002, Routledge, , p. 350 by Anatoly Khazanov According to a 2012 VTSIOM opinion research, 6% of respondents in Moscow and 3% in Saint Petersburg were \\"experiencing feelings of irritation, hostility\\" toward Armenians. In the 2000s there have been racist murders of Armenians in Russia.Armenian student killed in Moscow race attack Nick Paton Walsh in Moscow, The Guardian, Monday 24 April 2006Six Russians Jailed For Racist Killing Of Armenian March 14, 2007, (Reuters) In 2002 an explosion took place in Krasnodar near the Armenian church which the local community believed was a terrorist act. Georgia Unrooted Armenian gravestones in a church yard in Velistsikhe, Kakheti, Georgia In the late 19th century and early 20th century anti-Armenian sentiment was prevalent in both socialist and nationalist Georgian circles. The economic dominance of Armenians in Tbilisi fueled verbal attacks on Armenians. Droeba, an influential journal, described Armenians as people who \\"strip our streets and fatten their pockets\\" and \\"but the last piece of property from our indebted peasant families.\\" Both Ilia Chavchavadze and Akaki Tsereteli, two major literary figures, attacked Armenians for their perceived mercantilism. Tsereteli portrayed Armenians as a flea sucking Georgian blood in one fable. Chavchavadze denounced Armenians for \\"eating the bread baked by someone else or drinking that which is creating by another's sweat.\\" Chavchavadze's newspaper, Iveria, depicted Armenians as \\"sly moneylenders and unscrupulous traders,\\" according to Stephen F. Jones. The Social Democratic Party of Georgia (Georgian Mensheviks) attacked the bourgeoisie and imperialism to liberate Georgia from both Russian imperialism and perceived Armenian economic exploitation. During the existence of the Democratic Republic of Georgia (1918‚Äì21), the independent Georgian government saw Armenians as a potential \\"fifth column\\" for their supposed loyalty to the First Republic of Armenia and subject to manipulation by foreign powers. The Georgian‚ÄìArmenian War of December 1918 increased anti-Armenian sentiments in Georgia. In post-Soviet Georgia, first president Zviad Gamsakhurdia, an outspoken nationalist, viewed Armenians, along with other ethnic minorities, as \\"guests\\" or \\"aliens\\" who threaten Georgia's territorial integrity. Joseph Stalin wrote in his 1913 essay Marxism and the National Question: Around the time of the 2007 parliamentary elections in the breakaway region of Abkhazia, the Georgian media emphasized the factor of ethnic Armenians in the area. The Georgian newspaper Sakartvelos Respublika predicted that much of the parliament would be Armenian and that there was even a chance of an Armenian president being elected. The paper also reported that the Abkazanian republic might already be receiving financial assistance from Armenians living in the United States. Some Armenian analysts believe such reports are attempting to create conflict between Armenians and ethnic Abkhazians to destabilize the region. A policy of desecration of Armenian churches and historical monuments on the territory of Georgia has actively been pursued.The cultural genocide of Armenian historical monuments in Georgia, Organisation for the support of the Armenian Diocese in Georgia ‚ÄúKanter‚Äù On November 16, 2008, Georgian monk Tariel Sikinchelashvili vandalised the graves of patrons of art Mikhail and Lidia Tamamshev. The Armenian Church of Norashen in Tbilisi, built in the middle of the 15th century, has been desecrated and misappropriated by the Georgian government despite the fact that both Armenia's and Georgia's Prime- Ministers have reached an agreement on not to maltreat the church. Due to no law on religion, the status of Surb Norashen, Surb Nshan, Shamhoretsor Surb Astvatsatsin (Karmir Avetaran), Yerevanots Surb Minas and Mugni Surb Gevorg in Tbilisi and Surb Nshan in Akhaltsikhe is unknown since being confiscated during the Soviet era. Since independence in 1991, Georgian clergy have occupied the Armenian churches. Armenians in Georgia and Armenia have demonstrated against the destruction. On November 28, 2008, Armenian demonstrators in front of the Georgian embassy in Armenia demanded that the Georgian government immediately cease encroachments on the Armenian churches and punish those guilty, calling the Georgian party's actions \\"white genocide.\\" In August, 2011, Georgia's Culture Minister Nika Rurua sacked director Robert Sturua as head of the Tbilisi national theatre for \\"xenophobic\\" comments he made earlier this year, officials reported. \\"We are not going to finance xenophobia. Georgia is a multicultural country,\\" Rurua said.Georgia sacks theatre legend for 'xenophobia', AFP, August 2011 Provoking public outrage, Sturua said in an interview with local news agency that \\"Saakashvili doesn't know what Georgian people need because he is Armenian.\\" \\"I do not want Georgia to be governed by a representative of a different ethnicity,\\" he added. In July 2014, the Armenian Ejmiatsin Church in Tbilisi was attacked. The Armenian diocese said it was \\"a crime committed on ethnic and religious grounds.\\" In 2018 the Tandoyants Armenian church in Tbilisi was gifted to the Georgian Orthodox Patriarchate. The Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Holy Orthodox Church in Georgia stated that the church was ‚Äúillegally transferred‚Äù to the Georgian Patriarchate. According to the Human Rights Education and Monitoring Center, Tandoyants is not the only historic Armenian church the Georgian Patriarchate has targeted. There are at least six others the Patriarchate has its sights set on.Georgian Orthodox Church takes aim at Armenian churches ‚ÄúThere is interest in erasing any evidence of Armenians in Tbilisi.‚Äù by Neil Hauer, Bradley Jardine, Eurasianet, Nov 5, 2018 United States There has been historic prejudice against Armenians in the United States throughout various times, at least beginning from the early 1900s. In early 1900s Armenians were among the group of minorities who were barred from loaning money, land, and equipment particularly because of their race. They were referred to as \\"lower class Jews\\". Moreover, in Fresno, California, among other minorities Armenians lived on one side of Van Ness Blvd., while the residents of European white origin lived on the other side. A deed from one home there stated, \\"Neither said premises nor any part thereof shall be used in any matter whatsoever or occupied by any Black, Chinese, Japanese, Hindu, Armenian, Asiatic or native of the Turkish Empire.\\" In Anny Bakalian's book Armenian-Americans: From Being to Feeling Armenian, various groups of Armenians were polled for discrimination based on their identity. Roughly 77% of US-born Armenians felt they were discriminated in getting a job while 80% responded positively to a question whether they felt discriminated in getting admitted to a school.Anny Bakalian. Armenian-Americans, From Being to Feeling Armenian. 1993. , pp. 223-4 American historian Justin McCarthy is known for his controversial view that no genocide was intended by the Ottoman Empire but that both Armenians and Turks died as the result of civil war. Some attribute his denial of the Armenian Genocide to anti-Armenianism, as he holds an honorary doctorate of the Turkish Boƒüazi√ßi University and he is also a board member of the Institute of Turkish Studies.MacDonald, David B. Identity Politics in the Age of Genocide: the Holocaust and Historical Representation. London: Routledge, 2008, p. 121. . On April 24, 1998 during a campus exhibit organized by the Armenian Students' Association at UC Berkeley, Hamid Algar, a Professor of Islamic & Persian Studies, reportedly approached a group of organizers and shouted, ‚ÄúIt was not a genocide but I wish it was‚Äîyou lying pigs!‚Äù The students also claimed that Algar also spit at them. Following the incident members of the Armenian Students' Association filed a report with campus police calling for an investigation. After a five-month investigation the Chancellor's office issued an apology, though no hate charges were filed as incident did not create a \\"hostile environment.\\" On March 10, 1999 the Associated Students of University of California (ASUC) passed a resolution titled, \\"A Bill Against Hate Speech and in Support of Reprimand for Prof. Algar,\\" condemning the incident and calling for Chancellor to review the University decision not to file charges. In 1999, after Rafi Manoukian got elected to Glendale City Council, one resident attended the Council‚Äôs meetings every week to ‚Äútell Armenians to go back where they came from.‚Äù Manoukian campaign had made a point to galvanize Glendale's large Armenian American electorate. In April 2007, the Los Angeles Times Managing Editor Douglas Frantz blocked a story on the Armenian Genocide written by Mark Arax, allegedly citing the fact Arax was of Armenian descent and therefore had a biased opinion on the subject. Arax, who has published similar articles before, has lodged a discrimination complaint and threatened a federal lawsuit. Frantz, who did not cite any specific factual errors in the article, is accused of having a bias obtained while being stationed in Istanbul, Turkey. Harut Sassounian, an Armenian community leader, accused Frantz of having expressed support for denial of the Armenian Genocide and has stated he personally believed that Armenians rebelled against the Ottoman Empire, an argument commonly used to justify the killings. Frantz resigned from the paper not long afterward, possibly due to the mounting requests for his dismissal from the Armenian community. In March 2012 three of five Glendale Police Department's officers of Armenian origin filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court against Glendale Police Department claiming racial discrimination. In 2012 surgeon's assistant Ani Chopourian, a graduate of UCLA and Yale, was awarded $168 million in punitive damages for racial and gender discrimination by her co-workers. Another incident that received less coverage was a series of hate mail campaigns directed at Paul Krekorian, a city council candidate for Californian Democratic Primary, making racist remarks and accusations that the Armenian community was engaging in voter fraud. In 2016, during a race between Glendale City Clerk Ardy Kassakhian and Glendale Council Member Laura Friedman for the 43rd District Assembly seat, Kassakhian‚Äôs campaign faced numerous threats and criticism based on the candidate's ethnicity. At one point in the campaign Kassakhian‚Äôs office was evacuated after receiving a phone call that threatened the safety of employees and volunteers. On April 20, 2016, Armenian genocide denial propaganda appeared in the sky over the Hudson River between Manhattan and Northern New Jersey. The skywriting featured messages such as \\"101 years of Geno-lie,\\" \\"BFF = Russia + Armenia,\\" and \\"FactCheckArmenia.com.\\" The aerial stunt was part of a campaign by the website Fact Check Armenia, an Armenian Genocide Denialist site. The writing could be seen from roughly a 15-mile (24 km) radius. The media attention from the incident resulted in an official apology by the skywriting company. On April 21, 2016 students at Clark Magnet High School, which currently has 60% Armenian student body, wrote an open letter accusing the school administrators of cultural insensitivity. In the letter students explained that as a day of remembrance students wore black T-shirts. Because of Clark's collar dress code policy school staff browsed through classrooms and gave detention slips to students who wore black T-shirts. They also accused one of the teachers of shaming their actions, who \\"according to more than fifty Clarkies, one of the faculty members called the students' patriotic actions a \\"disgrace to America\\" and stated that she considers them to be \\"disrespectful to other Americans.\\" In the 4th episode of Season 3 of the CBS sitcom 2 Broke Girls (aired on October 14, 2013) \\"when a new cappuccino maker is brought into the cupcake store by a co-worker, he says he bought it for a cheap price from a person who stole it but sells it at a profit, adding 'it's the Armenian way.' When the character is pressed that he is not Armenian, he says 'I know. But, it's the Armenian way.'\\" This scene was characterized as \\"racist\\" by Asbarez Editor Ara Khachatourian, who criticized CBS for promotion of racial stereotypes in their shows. In the January 9, 2018 episode of the Comedy Central late-night program The Daily Show Trevor Noah stated: \\"This is, like, really funny. Only Donald Trump could defend himself and, in the same sentence, completely undermine his whole point. It would be like someone saying, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm the most tolerant guy out there, just ask this filthy Armenian.'\\" Armenian American organizations criticized Noah for alleged racism against Armenians. In a joint press release the Armenian Bar Association and the Armenian Rights Watch Committee (ARWC) compared \\"Filthy Armenians\\" to racial epithets as \\"Dirty Jew\\" and \\"Lazy Nigger\\", which although \\"may have been intended to coax a laugh from the audience by ridiculing President Trump's self-proclaimed genius and tolerance,\\" constitutes \\"affront and slander.\\" The organizations called for The Daily Show and Trevor Noah to issue a retraction and an apology. The Armenian National Committee of America (ANCA) also called for an apology. In July 2020 the KZV Armenian School and its adjacent Armenian Community Center in San Francisco were vandalized overnight with threatening and racist graffiti.

In 2011 several instances of spitting and verbal attacks on Armenian clergymen by Haredi Jews were reported in the Old City. In a 2013 interview Armenian Patriarch of Jerusalem Nourhan Manougian stated that Armenians in Israel are treated as \\"third-class citizens.\\" Pakistan Pakistan is the only United Nations member state that has not recognized the Republic of Armenia, citing its support to Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Tajikistan In early 1990, 39 Armenian refugees from Azerbaijan were settled in Tajikistan. False rumors spread that allegedly up to 5,000 Armenians were being resettled in new housing in Dushanbe experiencing acute housing shortage at that time. This led to riots which targeted both the Communist government and Armenians. The Soviet Ministry of Interior (MVD) suppressed the demonstrations, during which more than 20 people were killed and over 500 were injured. Ukraine In 1944, in the town of Kuty in eastern Poland, Ukrainian nationalists from the OUN-UPA massacred (as part of the Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia) Armenians and Poles, killing 200 people.

Career Born in Ballarat, Australia, Hobson sang with church and school choirs and local music groups as a child, but he was still vocally untrained when he performed as lead singer and bass guitarist with rock bands while studying at the University of Melbourne. However, despite this lack of formal training, after his voice was heard on a demonstration tape of Macbeth (see below) he was invited to join the Victoria State Opera, understudying the role of Frederic in the VSO's Joseph Papp (Broadway) version of The Pirates of Penzance in 1986. This led to his becoming a member of the company's Young Artists Programme, and making his debut as Rodolfo in a Victorian country tour production of La boh√®me in 1987. In 1988 he made his debut with The Australian Opera (now Opera Australia) when he created the role of Lawrence in the world premiere of Brian Howard's opera Whitsunday. He is the composer of Macbeth (a 1985 music theatre piece), Remembering Rosie (2001 chamber opera), The Loch Ard Suite (for the 2002 light/sound installation Shipwrecked at Warrnambool) and the award-winning 2004 orchestral score for the Australian film One Perfect Day, as well as a number of songs including Inside This Room and the title song for One Perfect Day. Cheryl Barker and Hobson, 2014 In 1990, he reprised the role of Rodolfo, opposite Cheryl Barker as Mim√¨, in a new production of La boh√®me for The Australian Opera, directed by Baz Luhrmann; this went on to become one of the company's most successful productions. It was filmed during its 1993 return season and broadcast on ABC TV several times. Released on VHS in 1994, it was to become the first opera available on DVD (1998) and continues to be a best seller worldwide. Hobson's Gilbert and Sullivan roles with Opera Australia, include Nanki-Poo in The Mikado, Marco Palmieri in The Gondoliers, Ralph Rackstraw in H.M.S. Pinafore and the Defendant in Trial by Jury. Hobson returned to the role of Frederic in the record-breaking Opera Australia production of The Pirates of Penzance with seasons during 2006 in Sydney at the Sydney Opera House, in Canberra, and in Brisbane at the Lyric Theatre, Queensland Performing Arts Centre. The national tour continued in 2007, with seasons in Adelaide and Melbourne, making a total of 100 performances in ten months. Although his operatic repertoire extends from 17th century works to the present, Hobson's high lyric tenor voice (he is actually a rare haute-contre or baroque tenor) is best suited to the baroque and bel canto operas of the 18th and early 19th centuries, such as those composed by Mozart and Rossini. His Mozart roles include Ferrando in Cos√¨ fan tutte, Don Ottavio in Don Giovanni, Tamino in The Magic Flute and Belmonte in The Abduction from the Seraglio. His Rossini roles include Lindoro in L'italiana in Algeri, Ramiro in La Cenerentola, Count Almaviva in The Barber of Seville, Dorvil in La scala di seta and Florville in Il signor Bruschino. Many other roles have included Ernesto in Donizetti's Don Pasquale, Nadir in Bizet's The Pearl Fishers, and a highly acclaimed Orph√©e in Gluck's Orph√©e et Eurydice, (the rarely performed 1774 Paris version for tenor). In 2008, he made his role debut as Nemorino in Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore with the Victorian Opera, and created several roles in their world premiere season of Through the Looking Glass by Alan John. Hobson created the role of the Chevalier de Danceny in the San Francisco Opera world premiere of The Dangerous Liaisons by Conrad Susa, as well as the Architect in The Eighth Wonder by Alan John and Michael Chamberlain in Lindy by Moya Henderson for Opera Australia. In 2006, he sang the title role in a Perth International Arts Festival concert performance of Candide by Leonard Bernstein and received rave reviews. Just weeks later he had the honour of singing before Elizabeth II and many other distinguished guests, at a State Dinner in Canberra. Hobson is a much sought-after concert artist, frequently appearing in Musica Viva recitals, and oratorios such as Handel's Messiah, and Mendelssohn's Elijah, as well as opera galas, recitals and solo concerts, displaying both his extensive classical and lighter repertoires. Since 1991 he has been a regular performer at the outdoor Christmas concerts in either Sydney (Carols in the Domain) or Melbourne (Carols by Candlelight) and, more recently, has appeared regularly in Christmas at the House at the Sydney Opera House. In February 2008 he made his debut at the Leeuwin Estate Concert Series in Margaret River with Australian soprano Yvonne Kenny, and in March returned to Mildura with another regular partner, Marina Prior, to sing at the Opera by the Lock. Working around his opera, recording and TV commitments, Hobson performed a series of concerts between April and September, appearing in Melbourne and regional Victoria and, marking the release of his CD, A Little Closer, performed in two concerts in the Sydney Opera House Concert Hall in November. Hobson and bass- baritone Teddy Tahu Rhodes' CD You'll Never Walk Alone was released in February 2009, followed in March by an extensive Australian recital tour. One of the recitals was in Hobart, and a few weeks later Hobson returned for concerts with the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra in Hobart and Launceston. Much of the second half of 2009 was occupied with touring for Musica Viva, while December was devoted to another performance of Handel's Messiah with the Royal Melbourne Philharmonic at Melbourne Town Hall, a season of Christmas at the House in the Sydney Opera House Concert Hall, and an appearance at Melbourne's traditional Christmas Eve celebration Carols by Candlelight, at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl, televised nationally. Hobson's 2010 schedule began with a return to Opera in the Alps at Beechworth, with Marina Prior, and continued with a reprise performance in the title role of Candide for the Sydney Festival concert presentation of Opera in the Domain (both in January); another recital with Teddy Tahu Rhodes in Adelaide (March); and the principal role of Eisenstein ‚Äì which he last performed in 2000 ‚Äì in the Opera Australia production of the Johann Strauss II operetta Die Fledermaus at the State Theatre, Arts Centre Melbourne, during May. April saw Hobson's debut as a specialist presenter on the new pay-TV STVDIO arts channel. Hobson followed the Fledermaus season of traditional operetta with something completely different when he appeared at the Adelaide Cabaret Festival in his stagework Am I Really Here? in June 2010 and a performance of Zender's contemporary interpretation of Schubert's Winterreise at the Brisbane Powerhouse in July. The CD album Singing for Love, a compilation of work by Hobson and Yvonne Kenny, was released in 2010 before their nationwide concert tour. A busy and varied year concluded with a series of concerts in four states, including three performances in Brisbane for the 25th anniversary season of Spirit of Christmas at QPAC and a regulation appearance at Melbourne's Carols by Candlelight. Hobson's 2011 schedule included a West Australian Opera concert performance of Die Fledermaus in Perth; a flying visit to New Zealand in March; a third concert appearance with the Victoria Welsh Choir in June; his role debut as Count Danilo in Opera Australia's new production of Leh√°r's The Merry Widow, followed immediately by another national concert tour with Teddy Tahu Rhodes and performances of Handel's Messiah with the Sydney Philharmonia Choirs and Orchestra at the Sydney Opera House Concert Hall. There was another compilation CD, The Best of David Hobson and more solo concerts in several states. In 2012 and 2013, Hobson appeared as Caractacus Potts opposite Rachael Beck as Truly Scrumptious in an Australian touring production of the musical Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. The inaugural Australian cruise of the performing arts on the in November 2014 included Hobson as well as, among others, Cheryl Barker, Colin Lane, Teddy Tahu Rhodes, Simon Tedeschi, Elaine Paige, Marina Prior, and Jonathon Welch.\\"Bravo!

He met his wife, ballerina Amber Simpson, when they performed together in 1992 in L'italiana in Algeri. They married in 1997. They have two children; daughter Madi (born 1998) and son Sam (born 2001). Other activities Hobson was mentor to model and TV host Erika Heynatz when they won the Seven Network reality singing show, It Takes Two in 2006, and returned in the 2007 season to partner celebrity Mimi Macpherson. In late 2007 Hobson appeared in Dancing with the Stars Series 7, with he and his mentor, Karina Schembri, finishing in third place. In 2008 he resumed his more familiar role of mentor to win It Takes Two Series 3, with Julia Morris. In 2000, Hobson became the Inaugural Patron of the Ballarat Arts Foundation, and continues in that capacity. At the end of March 2008, Musica Viva Australia announced Hobson's appointment as the Musica Viva in Schools Ambassador for a programme to raise an awareness of the importance of music education in Australian schools.Singing for Love, Yvonne Kenny and David Hobson, ABC Classics 2010, liner notes, p. 8 Awards and nominations * The Dame Joan Sutherland Scholarship 1988 * Inaugural R√©my Martin Australian Opera Award nominee 1991 * Sydney Theatre Critics' Award (Opera Performance) nominee 1992 * Sydney Theatre Critics' Award for roles of Rodolfo and Orph√©e 1993 * Operatic Performer of the Year (Mo Awards) 1994 * The Melbourne Age Performing Arts Award for role of Orph√©e 1994 * ARIA (The Australian Record Industry Association) Award for Best Music Video: Now Until the Break of Day 1998 * ARIA Award Nomination, Best Classical Recording for Handel Arias 2002 * The Handel Society International Recording Prize Nomination ~ Handel Arias 2003 * AFI (Australian Film Institute), APRA (Australian Performing Rights Association), Inside Film Awards Nominations, and the Film Critics Circle of Australia Award for Best Music Score, One Perfect Day 2004 * Nominee in the 2008 Mo Awards (Classical/Opera Performer category) * Nominee in the 2009 Mo Awards (Classical/Opera Performer category) * ARIA Fine Arts Award Nomination, Best Classical Album, You'll Never Walk Alone 2009 * ARIA Genre (formerly Fine Arts) Award Nomination, Best Classical Album, Enchanted Way 2010 ReferencesExternal links * David Hobson official website * Biography, Opera Australia \\"Maybe it's time to break the mould?\\" by Jill Sykes, Opera~Opera, November 2006 * David Hobson on Facebook * , STVDIO * , from La boh√®me, with Cheryl Barker, Opera Australia 1993 * 1960 births Living people Australian male composers Australian composers Australian operatic tenors People from Ballarat Singing talent show winners Musicians from Victoria (Australia) ","title":"David Hobson (tenor)"},{"id":"6347546","text":"The Nikon D80 is a digital single-lens reflex camera model announced by Nikon on August 9, 2006. The camera shipped the first week of September to US retailers. Considered by many to be a hybrid of design elements of the entry- level D50 and high-end D200 cameras, it occupied the same price bracket the Nikon D70 did at the time of its release. It was replaced by the Nikon D90 in August 2008. Features * 10.2 Megapixel CCD sensor * Seven preset scene modes (Auto, Portrait, Landscape, Macro, Sports, Night Landscape and Night Portrait) selectable using a top-mounted dial * User-selectable image optimization options (Normal, Softer, Vivid, More vivid, Portrait, Custom and Black-and-white) * In-camera Retouch feature with D-Lighting, Red-eye correction, Trim, Image overlay, Monochrome and Filter effects * In-camera Multiple exposure feature (merges up to three consecutive images) * USB 2.0 Hi-speed interface * Pentaprism viewfinder, rather than the more compact penta-mirror set up (0.94√ó magnification vs. 0.8√ó for the D40x).

Elected to the Alaska House of Representatives in 1968, he served a single term from 1969 to 1971. He was then elected to the Alaska Senate, serving in that body from 1971 to 1979, including serving as the president of the Senate from 1975 to 1977 during the 9th Alaska State Legislature. Facing reelection in his downtown Anchorage-area district in 1978, he instead ran for governor of Alaska. Winning the Democratic nomination in the primary election over two challengers, he would become the first of 3 major party nominees in Alaska gubernatorial elections to place third in the general election. The 1978 gubernatorial election was dominated by Republican challenger Walter Hickel. Hickel lost the primary to incumbent Jay Hammond by 98 votes, then launched a write-in campaign, which outpolled Croft in the general election. Croft largely retired from electoral politics after this campaign, but continues to practice law and remains prominent in legal and political circles in Alaska. He served a term on the University of Alaska Board of Regents from 1995 to 2003, including as chair of the body from 2001 to 2002. His older son, Eric, has gone on to have his own political career. Early life Leland Chancy Croft was born in Jennings, Louisiana on August 21, 1937, the son of Leland Croft, an oil and gas landman and geologist, and Dorthy (n√©e Chancy) Croft, a violin teacher. He grew up in Odessa, Texas, where he graduated high school. He graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with baccalaureate degrees in government and sociology, as well as a law degree. Not long after arriving in Anchorage from Texas in 1962, Croft became a charter member of the Alaska Legal Services Corporation, serving as chairman of the Board of Governors from 1971 to 1978. Political career Chancy Croft was elected to the Alaska House of Representatives in 1968, serving a single term. He was then elected to the Alaska Senate in 1970, serving from 1971 until 1979.Alaska Legislature Roster of Members 1913-2010, p. 47-54 He served as Senate President from 1975 to 1977. He was the Democratic Party's nominee for Governor of Alaska in 1978. Croft won the nomination over Jalmar M. Kerttula and Ed Merdes; both had served in the Senate themselves. Croft was paired with lieutenant gubernatorial nominee Katie Hurley. Hurley, as Katherine T. Alexander, was a government official in the latter days of the Territory of Alaska, who married Alaska constitution signer James J. \\"Jim\\" Hurley in 1960 and settled in his home area, the Matanuska-Susitna Valley. While still involved in Democratic Party politics, Hurley was largely out of the public eye at that point, busy raising her daughters in Wasilla. Croft's campaign would be the first of three times in Alaska gubernatorial elections that the major party nominee came in third in the general election. The campaign was overshadowed by the aftermath of the Republican primary between incumbent Jay Hammond and former governor Walter Hickel. Hickel lost the primary by 98 votes, and after an extensive court challenge, launched a write-in campaign. Both Hammond (who won reelection) and Hickel outpolled Croft in the general election. He was a member of the University of Alaska Board of Regents from 1995 until 2003; he was chairman from 2001 to 2002. He has worked to provide educational service to rural Alaska communities while guiding the university toward increased distance delivery education. He is responsible for establishing the Regents Scholarship benefiting UA junior, senior and graduate students. Croft holds an Honorary Doctor of Law from the University of Alaska Anchorage. Legal career Chancy Croft has appeared before the Alaska Supreme Court in over sixty cases, winning two-thirds of those cases. In at least twelve cases, he has lost to the Alaska Workers Compensation Board and in the Alaska Superior Court, only to succeed in the Supreme Court. He practices with The Croft Law Office, located in an older downtown Anchorage office building near the Conoco-Phillips Building. In 1986, his article, Something More Important Than Money: Vocational Rehabilitation in Workers Compensation Cases, was published in the Alaska Law Review. The article lauded the Alaska statute providing injured workers with training for new careers. The legislature promptly repealed the statute. More recently he unsuccessfully worked with the legislature on potential changes to the Alaska Workers Compensation Act. In 2005, he sued the governor of Alaska, challenging the constitutionality of legislation which created a new executive court to hear appeals from decisions of the Alaska Workers Compensation Board. Personal life Leland Chancy Croft is commonly known by his middle name, which is also his mother's maiden name. His oldest child, Eric (see below), bears the same middle name. He is married to Antoinette Ruth \\"Toni\\" (n√©e Williamson) Croft, a graduate of Stanford University. His children are Eric, Kymberly and Lee. Eric's own career in politics would also include serving in the legislature and running for governor. He additionally ran for mayor of Anchorage. Eric works with his father at The Croft Law Office. His sister, Dona Lee Croft, is a professor of violin at the Royal College of Music in London.

A group of 321 armed soldiers who called themselves \\"Bagong Katipuneros\\" (Filipino: New Katipuneros) led by Army Capt. Gerardo Gambala and Lt. Sg. Antonio Trillanes IV of the Philippine Navy took over the Oakwood Premier Ayala Center (now Ascott Makati) serviced apartment tower in Makati to show the Filipino people the alleged corruption of the Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo administration. They also stated that they saw signs suggesting that the President was going to declare martial law. The group was dubbed \\"Magdalo\\" by the press, in a reference to the insignia they adopted during the incident‚Äîthe perceived flag of the Magdalo faction of the Katipunan during the Philippine Revolution. Sources conflict on whether the eight-rayed-sun version of the flag was used by the Magdalo faction, the sixteen-rayed-sun version of the flag was used by the Magdiwang faction, or vice versa. Background According to the Fact Finding Commission created by Pres. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, the incidents leading to the mutiny were not spontaneous, but a mere alternative plan to an overarching plot to overthrow the government. Contrary to the statement made by Trillanes before the Fact Finding Commission that the takeover of Oakwood by the Magdalo Group was unplanned and spontaneous, the facts gathered by the Commission show that extensive planning and preparations for several months had preceded the events of July 27. There was the holding of gripe sessions among soldiers sought to be recruited, the distribution and discussion of copies of the \\"National Recovery Program\\" (NRP) of Senator Gregorio Honasan and a document entitled ‚ÄúThe Last Revolution‚Äù, bloodletting meetings and taking of an oath of loyalty by the recruits, the purchase of flags, armbands, uniforms, backpacks, and other rebel paraphernalia, and telecommunications equipment and vehicles, and so on. From July to December 2002, rumors had been spreading that some military personnel were inquiring about the grievances of members of the armed forces. Talks about recruitment from the ranks of the discontented and potential rebels in the military were heard from former members of the Reform the Armed Forces Movement (RAM) and junior officers in the military. These reports were relayed to Brig. Gen. Victor Corpus. It was later verified that a series of secret meetings among junior officers in the military had taken place in various parts of the country, in Metro Manila, Central Luzon, and Mindanao. A bloodletting ritual took place on June 4, 2003 in a house in San Juan, Metro Manila. Honasan allegedly presided over this occasion with junior officers of the AFP. At this meeting, Honasan discussed the NRP which sets forth his platform of Government, and the document entitled ‚ÄúThe Last Revolution‚Äù which emphasizes that the only means to achieve that platform or vision is through the use of force, violence, or armed struggle because incumbent officials will not give up their positions voluntarily. The bloodletting rite was administered to those who agreed to be part of the Magdalo group. To carry out the bloodletting rite, he provided special knives and showed the participants how to inscribe the letter ‚Äú·úÉ‚Äù (or ‚ÄúKa‚Äù in the old Tagalog alphabet) under their left upper arms. It was during this meeting that Major Perfecto A. Ragil, a member of the AFP Communications Electronics Information Service detailed in Malaca√±ang Palace was tasked by Alejano, a member of Philippine Military Academy(PMA) class of ‚Äô95, to switch off the Malaca√±ang Palace‚Äôs telephone system on ‚ÄúD-day.‚Äù The gripe sessions progressed to a recruitment process. Two meetings were held in Metro Manila, one in Robinson‚Äôs Galleria Suites in Mandaluyong on June 4, 2003 and another in an old house in San Juan on June 12, 2003. A photograph taken in one of these meetings, which was released to the press by the Presidential Security Group (PSG), shows Trillanes and a person who appears to be Honasan standing before the Philippine flag and a flag or streamer with the Magdalo countersign. In the June 12 meeting in San Juan, the following topics were discussed: the peace and order situation, the national economy, the alleged illegitimacy of the Arroyo administration, the Estrada plunder case, the NRP, the need to rectify the errors brought about by EDSA 2, and the contents of a document entitled ‚ÄúThe Last Revolution‚Äù . To implement ‚ÄúThe Last Revolution‚Äù the junior officers took their oath of loyalty as ‚ÄúNew Filipino Heroes‚Äù in this and other similar meetings. Based on intelligence reports, two documents of dubious origin were distributed during the meeting in San Juan. These documents were ‚Äúdesigned to pollute the minds of the junior officers.‚Äù The first is a supposed Memorandum of Instructions addressed to the Secretary of National Defense dated February 11, 2003, directing the full implementation of ‚ÄúOplan Greenbase.‚Äù The document, purportedly signed by the President, contains a plan to capture Hashim Salamat dead or alive and to occupy the Buliok Complex at the Liguasan Marsh area in North Cotabato. Secretary Eduardo Ermita of the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process (OPAPP) purportedly signed the other document entitled ‚ÄúThe President‚Äô s Four-Point Policy Framework in Addressing the Southern Philippines Secessionist/MILF Problem,\\" allegedly pursuant to the February 11 Presidential Memorandum of Instructions. This latter document purports to show that \\"there is apparently a plan by the government to hold the MILF responsible for AFP-backed bombings in urban areas in Mindanao.\\" President Arroyo denied having issued the first memorandum, and Ermita denounced the second document as being spurious and fabricated. The meeting on the night of June 12 was reportedly attended by top RAM officers including Honasan and retired Navy Capt. Felix Turingan, and the rebel leaders Trillanes, Gambala, and other junior officers. The group planned to attack high impact targets such as the Malaca√±ang Palace, Ninoy Aquino International Airport, Fort Bonifacio, Camp Crame, Villamor Air Base, Camp Aguinaldo, and all television and radio stations in Metro Manila. The plotters underwent the ritual earlier described as bloodletting, which they termed ‚Äúdinuguan.‚Äù Apart from the gripe sessions and bloodletting rites, the Magdalo group‚Äôs preparations included the acquisition of rebel paraphernalia. On June 4, 2003, a male customer went to the International Flag House (IFH) in Manila and placed a job order for 100 pieces each of Philippine flags and Bonifacio flags (i.e., displaying the Magdalo symbol). He deposited P1,000.00 for the job order, the total cost of which was P24,000.00. The customer wrote his name on Job Order 2186 as Armand Pontejos and his telephone number as 456-3222. Subsequent additional orders were placed for more flags, which orders raised the total cost to P45,000.00. The customer was later identified as Navy Ensign Armand Pontejos, PMA ‚Äò00, one of the rebel soldiers who went to Oakwood. Another rebel soldier who went to Oakwood was Navy Lt. Manuel Cabochan, of PMA ‚Äò95 who bought 49 sets of battle dress attire (BDA) uniforms, T-shirts, and combat boots worth P108,780.00 on June 30, 2003. There is evidence the Magdalo group also acquired vehicles apparently to transport troops to target areas. On July 23, five Hyundai Aero buses (presumably second hand) were purchased for P2.10 million in cash by Francisco Dimaculangan and Isidro Samaco from a company named Car Option Sales, Inc. One bus was later found in Oakwood while another was abandoned in Binakayan, Cavite. There is also evidence that some communications equipment used by the rebel soldiers were of the same specifications as those proposed to be acquired under the AFP Modernization Act. It was established that such equipment was not taken from any known or existing inventory of the AFP. The Magdalo group, it appears, targeted Oakwood as the site for the execution of \\"Plan Charlie.\\" On July 19, Gambala checked in at Oakwood under the name of George Uy, coincidentally the same name as SOUTHCOM Admiral George Uy. A cash deposit of P48,800.00 for room rental from July 19 to 28, 2003 was paid by a certain Tina Uy Angeles who made the reservation. Discovery of the plot From July 21 to 23, unauthorized troop movements apparently bound for Manila had been monitored upon validation of the information that there was restiveness among junior AFP officers. Having validated the coup rumors and considering the troop movements, the Government took a number of pre-emptive measures. It was fortuitous that these rumors and troop movements materialized just prior to the President‚Äôs State of the Nation Address (SONA) scheduled for delivery on July 28. In connection with the SONA, the Government was already taking measures to ensure the security of the President and the Government. On July 10, the National Security Council (NSC) had requested the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency (NICA) to host a ‚Äú small group‚Äù meeting of the Special Monitoring Committee Alpha (SMC Alpha), which was organized to ensure security during the SONA, together with the major service intelligence chiefs of the AFP and counter-intelligence specialists. SMC Alpha is composed of representatives from various intelligence bodies, and is mandated to monitor domestic threats, particularly destabilization plots against the Government, and to recommend appropriate counterintelligence measures. Its task is to prevent mass mobilizations from turning into a situation similar to the attempted siege of Malaca√±ang Palace on May 1, 2001 by the supporters of former President Joseph Estrada.[Testimony of NICA Dir. Gen.Cesar Garcia on August 14, 2003 on ‚ÄúHow the Coup Was Cracked Down‚Äù.] At the SMC Alpha meeting held on July 11, the details of the recruitment by the Magdalo group were discussed and those involved were identified. On the same day, NICA Director General Cesar Garcia reported to National Security Adviser Roilo Golez on the ongoing recruitment activities in the AFP by certain junior officers. Subsequently, SMC Alpha submitted a report from various intelligence sources that the plot being watched involved plans to temporarily reinstate deposed President Estrada. On July 12, the intelligence group informed the President about persistent reports of rebel recruitment activities in the AFP and the Philippine National Police (PNP), particularly in Mindanao, Central Luzon, and Metro Manila. The Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence (J2), MGen. Pedro Cabuay, presented a summary of what was taken up at NICA the previous day. Considering its highly sensitive nature, the information was kept within a small group. Apart from the top officers of the AFP and the PNP, only a small number of Cabinet members attended. Recruitment efforts were noted to be most intense in the First Scout Rangers and Special Forces Regiment of the Special Operations Command, the Philippine Navy (SWAG), Fort Bonifacio Units, the Philippine Army‚Äôs Light Armor Brigade (LABDE) and the Anti-Crime Task Force (ACTAF). Most of those who were approached were junior officers from the PMA classes of ‚Äô95 thru ‚Äô99. Considering the situation as having developed into a crisis, the President immediately designated Golez as crisis manager. An action plan was approved which consisted of pre-emptive measures employing persuasion efforts on the one hand, and cracking down on the suspected plotters should they commit any overt illegal acts, on the other.[Testimony of Golez on August 12, 03.] Recruitment activities by suspected rebels were again reported during the July 14 meeting of the Cabinet Oversight Committee ‚Äì Internal Security (COC-IS). The meeting discussed threats to SONA and the concomitant security preparations. At this time, the Government had not yet established concrete links between the recruitment of military officers as rebels and the anti- government mass actions mobilized for the SONA. In the meeting of SMC Alpha on July 15, the recruitment had been reported as led by a covert fraternity called the ‚ÄúNew Filipino Heroes‚Äù who were advocating the adoption of the NRP of Honasan. Plans of the groups to rescue and release ex-President Estrada from the Veterans Memorial Medical Center (VMMC) and to take over radio and TV stations were likewise revealed. Another meeting by the SMC Alpha took place on July 18 to ensure that the action plans agreed upon were already in place and being implemented.[Ibid.] Having received reports about the troop movements, PNP Chief, Director General Hermogenes Ebdane, Jr. issued a directive to all field commanders to coordinate with AFP units and investigate any unauthorized movements and other groupings. He also ordered all PNP personnel to be accounted for, and declared a full alert status for the PNP National Headquarters in Camp Crame, effective 6:00 pm on July 22, 2003. There was also an order to reinforce the guards at Camp Crame. It further appears that the intelligence community had been receiving reports that Honasan had been holding sessions with the members of the Magdalo group in Metro Manila and Sangley Point, Cavite. Information on these sessions was shared during the preparation for the President‚Äô s SONA. At the meeting on July 23, the SMC Alpha discussed plans on how to counter the likely staging of mass actions by anti-government groups at the Batasang Pambansa Complex during the SONA. At this meeting, the efforts at recruitment of junior officers in the AFP and the PNP in Mindanao were reported. The February 11 Memorandum of Instructions to the DND Secretary purportedly issued by the President and the ‚ÄúOplan Greenbase‚Äù attributed to Ermita were reported to have been disseminated to bolster the recruitment effort. Troop movements actually occurred two days before the Oakwood incident. Some 47 marines, carrying firearms were sighted coming from Ternate, Cavite. In the early morning of July 25, Some 28 Scout Ranger personnel boarded a Cebu Pacific flight for Manila and were monitored to have proceeded to Virramall Shopping Center in Greenhills, San Juan. On the same day several Scout Rangers were also reported surveying the Makati business district.[From the Briefing Manuscript by Cabuay during his testimony to the Commission on August 12, 2003.] Moreover, a group of Scout Rangers and members of the Philippine Marines boarded Superferry 2 from Zamboanga City for Manila via Iloilo City.[Testimony of PNP Chief Superintendent Arturo Lumibao on August 14, 2003.] The troop movement was being monitored and it was decided that the soldiers be met once they arrive in North Harbor. Upon their arrival, they were in fact met by some officers, including Col. Danilo Lim of the First Scout Ranger Regiment (FSRR), and were found to have apparently legitimate reasons for coming to Manila. They carried documents showing either they were on rest and recreation or about to undergo training. Despite the coup rumors, government security forces refrained from taking punitive action against the junior officers at that time as nothing overtly illegal had been committed. Some of them came in BDA uniforms and carried arms and ammunition. Some of them ended up in Oakwood. Before the Oakwood incident, amid the coup rumors, the President met with officers and men, including Trillanes and some members of PMA ‚Äô94 and ‚Äô95. On July 10, Navy Lt. Christopher Magdangal, an Aide-de- Camp to the President and a member of PMA ‚Äô95, called his classmate Trillanes to ask him about the veracity of reports that the latter was a leader of a rebel group moving to destabilize the Government. Trillanes said he was surprised to hear such report and later confided to Magdangal, after several exchanges of text and cellular phone messages, that he was in fact receiving death threats over the phone. Trillanes then asked Magdangal if he could see the President in Malaca√±ang on July 13 to clarify the issue with her.[Testimony of Trillanes on August 13, 2003.] Trillanes, who would later act as spokesman of the Magdalo group, met with two members of the PSG, Col. Delfin Bangit and Magdangal in the early morning of July 13. They talked for nearly four hours from 3:00 am onwards.[Testimony of Bangit on September 9, 2003.] The two officers were present when Trillanes met with the President at 7:00 am of the same day. During the meeting with President Arroyo, Trillanes brought up the problem of corruption as discussed in the two term papers which he submitted for his masters program at the University of the Philippines‚Äô National College of Public Administration and Governance. He later alleged that the President did not give him a chance to discuss the papers and instead scolded him. The President allegedly ordered the PSG officers to parade him before the media to give him a lesson and called the Flag Officer-in-Command (FOIC), Vice Admiral Ernesto de Leon, to detain him at the Naval Intelligence and Security Force (NISF) in Fort Bonifacio. In this connection, Magdangal, testified that, to the contrary, the conversation between the President and Trillanes was cordial. The President‚Äôs parting shot was ‚ÄúTrillanes, you are a young, very bright and very idealistic officer. Huwag mong gayahin si Honasan at si Carde√±o.‚Äù[Testimony of Magdangal on September 9, 2003.] The meeting lasted for about an hour. In the evening of July 23, 2003, about 100 members of PMA ‚Äô94 and ‚Äô95 had dinner and a ‚Äúphoto opportunity‚Äù with the President in Malaca√±ang Palace. A few days before the dinner, Chief of Staff, AFP (CSAFP) General Narciso Abaya held separate meetings with the officers of the two classes. He was informed of their sentiments, particularly that they were being unjustly dragged into the alleged plan for a rebellion.[Commission interview with Abaya during ocular visit to GHQ on September 29, 2003.] Through the efforts of their classmates in the PSG and Abaya, the dinner with the President took place. Members of PMA ‚Äò94 and ‚Äô95 were invited to the occasion for ‚Äúpure socializing‚Äù through text messages that originated from Magdangal.[Interview by Commissioners Gonzaga-Reyes and Narciso with Capt. Segundino Orfiano in the presence of Atty. David Gabriel and Atty. Irwin Tiamson in the detention facility at the Villamor Airbase on October 6, 2003.] The class officers, expecting to have a ‚Äú dialogue‚Äù with the President that night regarding the issues in the AFP that they would like to raise, got frustrated as all Air Force Capt. Segundino Orfiano was able to say after the dinner, when the President briefly asked about the coup issue, was ‚Äú‚Ä¶we are against corruption.\\" Likewise, based on the remarks made on television immediately after the dinner, PMA ‚Äô94 class president Army Capt. Ma. Noel Tolentino said, ‚Äúwe assured her that we are still‚Ä¶ we are loyal to her‚Äù. The President also attended on July 24 the turn-over of the command at the FSRR in Camp Tecson in San Miguel, Bulacan as part of the effort to neutralize the coup threat. The President took this opportunity to visit with the members of the FSRR, which at that time was reported to have been significantly infiltrated by suspected rebels. She also visited on July 25 the Marine Training Camp in Ternate, Cavite, the PAF 15th Strike Wing, and the SWAG in Sangley Point, Cavite. Abaya made rounds of other units where restiveness had been reported. In the early morning of July 26, the 10 suspected leaders declared unaccounted for by the AFP were identified as Trillanes, Layug, Gambala, Maestrecampo, and Army officers Capt. Lawrence Louis Somera, Capt. Albert Baloloy, 1st Lt. Lawrence San Juan, 1st Lt. Florentino Somera, 1st Lt. Jose Enrico Demetrio Dingle, and 1st Lt. Waren Lee Dagupon. At 5:00 am, emergency meetings were held by Abaya, Golez, and Garcia with the general staff and senior officers to discuss the reports on the missing officers and the reported destabilization plot. At around 10:00 am, President Arroyo and Corpuz met with a group of NGOs at the EDSA Shrine. Corpuz announced that certain units from Tanay were missing. At 2:00 pm, a meeting was held by the same group with House Speaker Jose de Venecia and the House Committee Chairman for Defense and Security, Prospero Pichay, to discuss the matter.[Testimony of Garcia on August 14, 2003.] At 5:00 pm of July 26, 2003, the President convened a full cabinet meeting where Cabuay presented a briefing on the looming coup plot.[From the ‚ÄúBriefing on the 2003 SONA and the Attendant Destabilization Activities‚Äù given to the Commission by NICA on August 14, 2003.] Thereafter, the President publicly announced for the first time at 8:19 pm in the media that ‚Äúa small band of rogue junior officers and soldiers had deserted their posts and illegally brought weapons with them.‚Äù[Statement of President Arroyo ordering the arrest of coup plotters on July 26, 2003 shown on ABS-CBN News Channel The World Tonight on July 26, 2003.] The security plan of action was immediately set in motion. Task Force Libra (TF Libra), the counter-coup composite unit of the AFP, was set in motion. The action forces were immediately dispatched in anticipation of the rumored coup. A week earlier, a meeting of the leaders of ‚Äúanti-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo‚Äù (PGMA) groups allegedly to discuss pre-SONA activities at the Danarra Hotel in Quezon City was monitored by Government intelligence.[Testimony of Garcia of NICA on August 14, 2003.] On July 25, 2003, intelligence reports were received that some so-called ‚Äúanti-PGMA‚Äù groups like the People‚Äôs Movement Against Poverty (PMAP) and DEMOKRASYA had been instructed to assemble at the EDSA Shrine at 4:00 pm on July 27 and hold an overnight vigil there before proceeding to the Batasan area to hold anti-government rallies during the SONA. Invitations by the ‚Äú anti-PGMA‚Äù group members to civilians to join the coup to be staged on July 27 were made through cellphone text messages. Among those who were recruited were past and present members of the DIABLO and Philippine Guardians Brotherhood, Inc. (PGBI\\" ).[Testimony of CIDG Chief Dir. Eduardo Matillano on August 25, 2003.] Police Chief Inspector Leborio Jangao, one of the founding members of PGBI, stated he received cellphone text messages on July 26 informing him that a coup d‚Äôetat would be staged on July 27. At this time the crime disturbance personnel of the PNP had already been instructed to secure the EDSA Shrine, the Connecticut Street area, and the Ortigas Avenue Extension area from rallyists. There were reports the EDSA Shrine would be the target where another EDSA 2 or EDSA 3 would be staged.[Testimony of PNP Gen. Reynaldo Vicente Velasco of NCRPO Mandaluyong on August 27, 2003.] Early on Friday night of July 25, the 80th Infantry Battalion based in Camp Capinpin was ordered to augment TF Libra. The mission of the TF Libra included the securing of vital communications installations such as radio and TV stations. It assisted the PNP in securing the EDSA Shrine and containing civilian groups in the area. The first elements of the joint TF Libra arrived in Camp Aguinaldo at about 11:00 pm.[Testimony of PA Vice Commander Gen.Efren Abu on August 14, 2003.] For his part, Ebdane declared a full alert status nationwide, effective on 12:00 noon on July 26, as a contingency measure. All PNP field commanders were directed to secure vital installations and key establishments. At around 2:00 pm of July 26, the Mandaluyong City police started the deployment of at least one hundred forty (140) personnel at the Poveda, Connecticut, and Ortigas areas. Later at 3:00 pm, intelligence reports indicated a change of instructions to the rallyists manning the EDSA Shrine. The anti-government groups were advised to assemble at the EDSA Shrine at 6:00 am on July 27 instead. At about 7:00 pm of July 26, Maj. Gen. Efren L. Abu, Vice Commander PA and Commander of TF Libra, visited the 80th Infantry Battalion. By this time, TF Libra was already at its full strength. An hour later, President Arroyo went on air and ordered the arrest of the junior officers who had deserted their posts. A conference presided over by Abaya was held at about 9:00 pm to assess the intelligence situation. Abu gave an update on the forces composition of TF Libra. The PNP report on troop movement by Marines from Ternate, Cavite to the North or to Manila was confirmed by Cavite PNP Provincial Director Police Senior Superintendent Roberto L. Rosales and Marine Commandant, Maj. Gen. Emmanuel Teodosio. The advancing Marines were able to avoid checkpoints on their way to Makati by evasive movements. The PAF civil disturbance contingent earlier deployed at the Batasan area and the PN contingent at the VMMC, both in Quezon City, were then redeployed to the Makati area. An additional 100 Special Action Force (SAF) personnel of the PNP were then sent to secure the Batasan complex. In addition, one PA platoon and a PNP contingent reinforced the security forces of TV stations and telecommunications facilities.[Exhibit ‚ÄúN-1‚Äù identified by Garcia on August 14, 2003, Fact Finding Commission] Also on July 26, Naval Base personnel in Cavite received a report that three suspicious-looking vehicles were parked at the back of the Naval Sea Systems Command Armory in Fort San Felipe, Cavite City.[This report was relayed to the command duty officer, Naval Base Cavite and further relayed to Commander of NBC Commo Sanglay. On the investigation of vehicles used by rebel soldiers, a special report submitted by Capt. Alexander Pama, the assistant Chief for Naval Intelligence, provided details on the recovery of vehicles abandoned by the Oakwood mutineers.] Following the order issued by President Arroyo to the AFP and PNP for the arrest of the Magdalo officers at around 8:00 pm and the conference called by Abaya to assess the intelligence reports at 9:00 pm, operatives of the PNP‚Äôs Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) were dispatched to Dasmari√±as Village, Makati at around 10:00 pm that same night of July 26 to verify the presence of heavily armed men in military uniform reported by security guards of the Dasmari√±as Village. National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) agents were also dispatched to monitor this development.[Testimony of Matillano on August 25, 2003.] The Mutiny Location of Oakwood Premiere and the Manila Peninsula Hotel in Makati. These hotels had become the location of the Magdalo mutiny of 2003 and 2007, respectively. The Oakwood siege had been facilitated by earlier activities as seen in the foregoing account. The antecedents show that the rebellion was not a spontaneous phenomenon as extensive preparations and mobilization activities were undertaken prior to the occupation and control of the Oakwood Apartments. The rebels took over Oakwood at past 1:00 am of July 27. Over 300 soldiers quietly entered the premises of Ayala Center in several groups.[Testimony of Josefino Marcellones, September 8, 2003.] The soldiers disarmed the security guards and took over Oakwood. They planted claymore mines around the building and in the vicinity. Snipers were posted at the Oakwood roof deck.[From the Briefing Manuscript submitted by Cabuay to the Commission on August 12, 2003.] Two government command groups were immediately dispatched after reports of the occupation of Oakwood, and of movement of the Marine contingent from Ternate towards Camp Aguinaldo were confirmed. The Crisis Management Staff was formed at the Command Operation Center in Camp Crame, and the Advanced Command Post of the PNP was established behind the Intercontinental Hotel in Makati. Marines and Army officers later joined the PNP at the Makati post, and the Southern Police District Director, Police Chief Superintendent Jose Gutierrez, was designated as the ground commander. At around 2:00 am on July 27, Abu was informed by the Joint Operation Center in Camp Aguinaldo about the presence of troops moving towards Metro Manila. Most of these troops were coming from Ternate, Cavite. At this time, the Marines under Teodosio were already poised to stop the troops. They were pre-positioned around the car park behind Oakwood. At about the same time, the security guards of Dasmari√±as Village in Makati confirmed the presence of heavily armed men in full battle gear marching from Paraiso Street to the EDSA-Pasay Road gate of the village. The armed soldiers, wearing red armbands, forced the security guards to open the gate. They were seen crossing EDSA and going towards the direction of Ayala Center, Makati. The CIDG-NBI composite team confirmed that the rebel soldiers came from a house at 2177 Paraiso Street, Dasmari√±as Village, owned by Ramon Cardenas who was residing at 1346 Palm Avenue in the same village. At 4:00 am TF Ayala of the Marine Corps had been activated and had occupied positions with infantry and armor, encircling the Ayala Center Complex.[From the After- Operations Report of the Philippine Marine Corps dated July 28, 2003 submitted to the Commission.] Between 4:00 and 5:00 am, the rebel soldiers were able to make arrangements to go on air to issue a public statement. The ABS-CBN News (ANC) network showed a live TV coverage of the prepared statement read by Gambala. In the statement, the rebels declared their withdrawal of support from the chain of command and presented their grievances against the Arroyo government. They demanded the resignation of the Arroyo administration leaders and endorsed the NRP as the solution to the problems of the Philippines.[From the video tape of ANC‚Äô s Special Coverage of the Oakwood Incident of July 27, 2003.] Also at dawn, Alex Benasin, a resident of the Baseco compound at the Port Area, was busy recruiting residents of the compound to go to Oakwood for a consideration of P300.00 each.[Exhibits ‚ÄúHH-1‚Äù to ‚ÄúHH-7‚Äù identified by DILG Sec. Jose Lina, Jr. on August 26, 2003.] Later, at about 8:30 am, members of the PGBI carrying banners of the NRP were seen in the Makati area but they were prevented by the PNP from reaching and camping in the vicinity of Oakwood. Pro-Estrada rallyists headed towards the People Power Monument on EDSA were also dispersed by police stationed in the area. It was reported that more pro-Estrada followers actively recruited people from various Metro Manila locations to regroup in the EDSA Shrine. Members of the PMAP marched in the direction of Makati from Greenhills. After 9:00 am of July 27, President Arroyo gave the rebel soldiers a 5:00 pm deadline to give up their positions peacefully and return to barracks. At around 1:00 pm, she declared the existence of a ‚ÄúState of Rebellion‚Äù and issued an order to use reasonable force, and pay due regard to constitutional rights, in putting down the rebellion.[General Order No. 4 read on air by Presidential Spokesman Sec. Ignacio Bunye on July 27, 2003.] The rebel soldiers held another public airing of their grievances at around 4:20 pm. By that time, 25 rebel soldiers had surrendered to the TF Libra in two batches, as revealed by the Government command stationed outside of Oakwood. The announcement of the surrender was downplayed by the Magdalo group as part of a ‚Äúpsywar‚Äù operation on the part of the Government, during an ambush interview of Trillanes. During the media briefing in the afternoon, other rebel officers besides the known leaders expressed their grievances against the Government while the press conference was going on. Trillanes, in a side interview by a news reporter, stated that they were willing to negotiate. Teodosio arranged for the rebels‚Äô close family members to go to Oakwood and help persuade members of the rebel group to give up their plans. Shortly before the 5:00 pm deadline, the President announced an extension of the deadline to 7:00 pm. It was during the two-hour reprieve that negotiations with various personalities and groups of negotiators prospered. As the deadline approached, negotiations between the rebel soldiers and the Government team led by the Government chief negotiator, Ambassador Roy A. Cimatu, effectively extended the deadline indefinitely. An agreement was forged between the two groups at 9:30 pm At 10:00 pm, President Arroyo announced that the occupation of Oakwood was over. The rebels agreed to return to barracks and were out of the Oakwood premises by 11:00 pm. Grievances Based on the press conference held by the rebels during their hold of the hotel, they justified their actions that they are merely taking this drastic actions to air their grievances which are to name a few: *Corruption in the AFP's Procurement System *AFP Grievances Mechanism *Sad and obsolete state of the AFP equipage *State of the AFP Medical Services *Benefits of soldiers Killed in Action *State of the Philippine Air Force, and modernization *Inadequate housing program for soldiers *Overstaying retired officers in official housing for soldiers Outcome Image:Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.jpg President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo Image:Philippine revolution flag magdalo.png Flag of the rebel soldiers The bloodless mutiny ended unsuccessfully within 18 hours when the soldiers failed to rally support from the public or the armed forces. All soldiers involved surrendered peacefully and were charged in a general court martial. More than a year after the mutiny, its leaders apologized to the President for the failed military rebellion. Arroyo accepted the apology, but ruled out immediate pardon and said their trial would proceed. The officers faced sentences up to life in prison for the mutiny. Trillanes ran for a senatorial position during the 2007 Philippine Elections, using Magdalo paraphernalia. In November 2004, President Arroyo ordered 133 of the 321 soldiers freed, saying they were deceived by their officers into joining the mutiny. But insiders say that this was made possible through back-channel negotiations in the wake of the Magdalo leaders' apology. Escape On December 14, 2005, Marine Capt. Nicanor Faeldon, one of the alleged leaders, escaped from custody and heavy guard after a hearing at the Regional Trial Court of Makati. He later issued a statement saying that after keeping his silence for over two years, he was leaving to \\"join the fight for a credible government.\\" He stated that he knew that such actions would bear no benefit for himself, that he would never run for public office, while noting that the events since 2003 have proven him right. Shortly after his escape, four others of his co-accused, led by Army Lt. Lawrence San Juan also escaped from their detention in Fort Bonifacio, Makati. While outside, Capt. Faeldon called for civil disobedience and set up an organization, Pilipino.org. His website, www.pilipino.org.ph, received over a million hits in the days following his escape. He also had himself videotaped and photographed inside various military camps throughout the Philippines posting the videos and pictures on his website, saying that: ‚Äú Unless those corrupt generals man the gates themselves, no one can stop me from going in and out of these camps. The enlisted men and officers of the military and the police who remain loyal to the people will not turn me in.‚Äù He was recaptured on January 27, 2006, in Mandaluyong by the AITF under the supervision of PCI Franz Georsua He was placed in solitary confinement in the detention center of the Intelligence Service Armed Forces of the Philippines, in Camp Aguinaldo. His salary was also suspended indefinitely. Thereafter, he was transferred to the Philippine Marine Brig in Fort Bonifacio where he was incarcerated until he disappeared during the Manila Peninsula mutiny. Guilty plea On July 10, 2007, twelve junior officers, leaders of the Magdalo group ‚Äì Magdalo is the name of the group of Officers involved in Oakwood Mutiny Incident, entered guilty pleas on charges of \\"conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman\\" ‚Äì (Article 96, Articles of War) at a hearing at Camp Aguinaldo. They were Army Captains Gerardo Gambala, Milo Maestrocampo, Lawrence Luis San Juan, Albert Baloloy, John Andres, Florentino Somera and Alvin Ebreo, and First Lieutenants Cleao Donga-as, Audie Tocloy, Von Rio Tayab, Rex Bolo and Brian Yasay. The verdict on the twelve officers, along with 17 others, will be released on the next scheduled hearing. The court will likely impose the penalty of ‚Äúdishonorable discharge‚Äù on the junior officers. Five other junior officers, including former Lt/SG Grade Antonio Trillanes IV, who won a seat in the Senate in the 2007 Philippine mid-term elections, have not indicated any intention to enter into a plea bargaining agreement with the court. Trillanes, Gambala and Maestrecampo are members of the Philippine Military Academy Class of 1995. On August 22, 2007, twelve of the accused were meted the sentence of dishonorable discharge by a military court under Brig. Gen. Nathaniel Legaspi. Sentenced were Army Captains Milo Maestrecampo, Gerardo Gambala, Albert Baloloy, Alvin Ebreo, Lawrence Somera, and John Andres; and First Lieutenants Rex Bolo, Von Rio Tayab, Audie Tocloy, Cleo Donga-as, Florentino Somera, and Brian Yasay. The sentence will take effect once approved by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. On December 20, 2007, fifty two officers led by Lt Jeveehboy Macarubbo of the Philippine Air Force was released upon the order of the Military Court. These officers were sentenced to be separated from the service. The mass release came after they were granted executive clemency that shortened the jail term handed down by a military tribunal. On April 29, 2008, the military tribunal, presided by Brig. Gen. Nathaniel Legaspi, sentenced 5 Magdalo soldiers to be discharged from service for pleading guilty for violation of Articles of War 96 (conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman) for their participation in the July 27, 2003 Oakwood mutiny. Army 1st Lieutenants Lawrence San Juan, Sonny Bumidang, and Nathaniel Rabonza were discharged from the military service. Also sentenced were 1Lt. Jason Panaligan and 2Lt. Christopher Orogan, to 7 years and 6 months imprisonment for violating AW 97 (conduct prejudicial to good order and military discipline). The court's decision is still subject to the approval of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. 11 junior officers, led by Navy Lt. Senior Grade James Layug and Marine Capt. Gary Alejano, on June 10, 2008 altered their pleas to guilty to a general court martial for violations of the Articles of War concerning the Oakwood (now Ascott hotel) mutiny. Accordingly, just 6 officers remain charged before the court martial, including Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV, and fugitive Marine Capt. Nicanor Faeldon.www.abs-cbnnews.com/, 11 Magdalo officers charged in military court change pleas to guilty Appointment, Presidential pardon and release from detention 17 former members of the Magdalo group were each given a Philippine Drug Enforcement Agent (PDEA) badge and were appointed PDEA agents on May 6, 2008. They were part of the 53 junior officers who were honorably discharged after a plea bargain agreement after 4 years of detention. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo on May 12, 2008 approved the conditional pardon for 9 convicted Magdalo soldiers. Captains Milo Maestrecampo and Gerardo Gambala, Albert Baloloy, John Andres, Alvin Ebreo, Laurence Luis Somera, First Lieutenants Florentino Somera and Cleo Donga-as and Second Lieutenant Bryan Yasay, were all released from detention in Fort Bonifacio on May 16, 2008 by newly installed Army commander Lt. Gen. Victor Ibrado per Court release order, and after their signing of the joint sworn acceptance of conditional pardon. On April 8, after plea of guilt, the Makati Regional Trial Court sentenced Gambala and Milo Maestrecampo to reclusion perpetua, while Army Captains Alvin Ebreo, Laurence Louis Somera, Albert Baloloy and John Andres, 1Lt. Florentino Somera, 2Lt. Kristoffer Bryan Yasay and 1Lt. Cleo Dongga were sentenced to prison mayor. On April 11, Army Captain Gerardo Gambala spoke for the 9 Magdalo officers, appealing for presidential pardon. The 9th division of the Court of Appeals acquitted the coup d'etat charges of Army 1Lt. Lawrence San Juan and 1Lt. Rex Bolo filed by the Department of Justice on April 5, 2015. Refusal to plea bargain Marine Capt. Nicanor Faeldon, one of the accused officers, refused to enter a guilty plea and issued a statement on July 27, 2007, the fourth anniversary of the incident, explaining his decision.

WebMD online page. Accessed on 2018-06-14. History The solution takes the name from British chemist Henry Drysdale Dakin (1880‚Äì1952) who developed it in 1916, during World War I, while he was stationed at a field hospital in Compi√®gne. He worked there in collaboration with French physician Alexis Carrel, and the particular use they made of the solution is known as the Carrel‚ÄìDakin method for wound treatment. Sodium hypochlorite solution had been developed as a bleaching agent around 1820 by the French chemist Antoine Labarraque, as a cheaper substitute for Claude Berthollet's potassium hypochlorite solution, produced as Eau de Javel since the late 18th century. Around that time, he also discovered the disinfectant properties of his Eau de Labarraque, which was quickly adopted for that purpose.Scott, James, transl. (1828). On the disinfecting properties of Labarraque's preparations of chlorine Published by S. Highley. His work greatly improved medical practice, public health, and the sanitary conditions in hospitals, slaughterhouses, and all industries dealing with animal products.Labarraque, Antoine-Germain, Nouvelle biographie g√©n√©rale, volume 28 (1859), columns 323‚Äì324. However, those products were too concentrated and alkaline for use on wounds, as they strongly irritated healthy tissues. Almost a century later Carrel and Dakin observed that few doctors at the time practiced asepsis, and moreover there were no studies of the effectiveness of various antiseptics for wounds. They set out to look for a substance that did not irritate skin, yet had sufficient bactericidal power. Dakin tested more than 200 substances, measuring their action on tissues and bacteria. He found chloramines to be the best, for being stable, non-toxic and not very irritant, yet powerful bactericides, presumably due to their release of hypochlorous acid. However, the difficulty of procuring them led him to choose \\"hypochlorite of soda\\" as a practical alternative.Henry D. Dakin (1915): \\"On the use of certain antiseptic substances in the treatment of infected wounds\\". British Medical Journal, volume 2, issue 2852, pp. 318‚Äì310.H. D. Dakin and E. K. Kunham (1918).

Cited by Marcel Dufresne, Presse m√©dicale' (1916) Between the two world wars the preparation was often called \\"Carrel‚ÄìDakin solution\\", even though Dakin did the bulk of the research work that led to its formulation. The name of Carrel was dropped after World War II, presumably due to his active involvement in eugenics movements and the advocacy of elimination of \\"inferior\\" humans. Since penicillin became established as an antibiotic in 1943, use of Dakin's solution and other topical antiseptics for wound treatment has declined, and their use is frowned upon in modern medical care.N.

Formulation Dakin's original solution contained sodium hypochlorite (0.4% to 0.5%), prepared by treating calcium hypochlorite with sodium carbonate (\\"washing soda\\"). The solution left after removal of the insoluble calcium carbonate still contained some soda. Boric acid (4%) was then added as a buffering agent to maintain a pH of between 9 and 10. Dakin found that alkalinity outside this range was too irritating.Glenn E. Cullen and Roger S. Hubbard (1919): \\"Note on the stabilization of dilute sodium hypochlorite solutions (Dakin's solution)\\". Journal of Biological Chemistry, volume 37, pp. 511‚Äì517. The solution, while unstable, if made to the correct pH remains effective for at least a week. Other formulations have been developed over time. Already in 1916, Marcel Daufresne substituted sodium bicarbonate for Dakin's boric acid as buffering agent.Marcel Daufresne (1916), \\"Mode de pr√©paration de l'hypochlorite de soude chirurgical - Differ√©nce entre la soulution de Dakin et celle de Labarraque\\".

(1981). The Wonder that was India, Calcutta:Rupa, p.437) is a five-act Sanskrit play by ancient Indian poet Kalidasa, who lived in the 4th or 5th Century CE, on the Vedic love story of king Pururavas and an Apsara (celestial nymph) named Urvashi, known for her beauty. As per the tradition, while the basic plot has taken elements from the sources such as the Samvada SuktaText of Samvada Sukta (‡§∏‡§Ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§¶ ‡§∏‡•Ç‡§ï‡•ç‡§§) of the Rigveda (‡§ã‡§ó‡•ç‡§µ‡•á‡§¶), Mahabharata and others, Kalidasa has made significant adaptations to make the presentation more appealing while establishing his prowess as a playwright (‡§®‡§æ‡§ü‡§ï‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞). Vikramorvashiyam is the second of the three plays written by Kalidasa, the first being MƒÅlavikƒÅgnimitram (‡§Æ‡§æ‡§≤‡§µ‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ‡§ó‡•ç‡§®‡§ø‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡•ç) and the third being the celebrated Abhij√±ƒÅna≈õƒÅkuntalam (‡§Ö‡§≠‡§ø‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§®‡§∂‡§æ‡§ï‡•Å‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§≤‡§Æ‡•ç). According to one theory, \\"Vikrama\\" in the title alludes to Kalidasa's patron king Vikramaditya. However, there is no conclusive evidence for this, although both are said to have lived around the same time period. It simply means \\"Valour\\". Origin of the plotPatel, G. (2014). [in Gujarati] Vikramorvashiyamnu Mool ane Kavini Maulikata. Chapter-25, Part-2: Vikramorvashiyam in 'Mahakavi Kalidasvirachitam Malavikagnimitram, Vikramorvashiyam', Vol. 3 of Mahakavi Kalidasa-Samagra Granthavali, p. 238-240.Pandya, S. M. & Shah, U. (1993). The Sources of the Play and the Changes Brought about by Kalidasa. (Ed.s) Chapter-3, Mahakakavikalidasavirachitam Vikramorvashiyam, Saraswati Pustak Bhandar, Ahmedabad. p. 25-29. The classical theory of Sanskrit drama, known as Natyashastra (‡§®‡§æ‡§ü‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∂‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞) makes it a rule that the plot of a Sanskrit drama 'must be famous' (‡§®‡§æ‡§ü‡§ï‡§æ: ‡§ñ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§§‡§µ‡•É‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§æ: ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§§‡•ç). Accordingly, authors of Sanskrit plays use the stories from Puranas, Vedic texts and classic epics, namely Mahabharata and Ramayana for developing plays. However, the core objective of a drama is entertainment (‡§Æ‡§®‡•ã‡§∞‡§Ç‡§ú‡§®). Since everyone is familiar with the basic plot, if the presentation of the play is not interesting or enchanting in some way, people would be bored. Hence there is emphasis on originality (‡§Æ‡•å‡§≤‡§ø‡§ï‡§§‡§æ) of the playwright. In the case of Vikramorvashiyam, here is how Kalidasa has adapted the original subject: Rigveda (‡§ã‡§ó‡•ç‡§µ‡•á‡§¶): In the 95th section, called Sukta (‡§∏‡•Ç‡§ï‡•ç‡§§) of the tenth cluster (called Mandala/‡§Æ‡§£‡•ç‡§°‡§≥), there is a dialogue between Pururava and Urvashi. Situation suggests that she has left the king after living for four years with him. The king beseeches her to return, but she refuses (saying, \\"‡§® ‡§µ‡•à ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•à‡§£‡§æ‡§®‡§ø ‡§∏‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§ø ‡§∂‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§µ‡•É‡§ï‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§π‡•É‡§¶‡§Ø‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á‡§§‡§æ:\\" - meaning, the hearts of women are not like those of jackals). The story ends at that. Shatapatha Brahmana (‡§∂‡§§‡§™‡§• ‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§£): Apparently aimed at emphasizing importance of a Yagya, Pururava was attracted to Urvashi when she came to his city. She agreed with a condition, but when the king could not honor it because of manipulation by Gandharva people, she left him. Later, moved by the king's plight without her, she agreed to return once every year to him. The king still missed her a lot, so now convinced of his love, the Gandharvas asked him to perform a Yagya, due to which Pururava attained Gandharva-hood and could reunite with Urvashi (P. 1.2). Purana: In all, Vishnu Purana (‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡•Å ‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡§æ‡§£) (4.6, 34-39), Padma Purana (‡§™‡§¶‡•ç‡§Æ ‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡§æ‡§£) (Srishti Khanda/‡§∏‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü‡§ø‡§ñ‡§£‡•ç‡§° 12, 62-68), Matsya Purana (‡§Æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡§æ‡§£) (24, 10-32), Mahabharata, Bhagavat Purana (‡§≠‡§æ‡§ó‡§µ‡§§ ‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡§æ‡§£) (9, 14) and the story of Gunadhya in Brihatkatha are the sources of the story of Pururava and Urvashi. There are multiple versions of these stories in different sources, but one can see the following elements in this pool: *(a) That Urvashi descended from heaven for some reason and met Pururava; *(b) The two lived together under some condition(s) for some time; *(c) At least on one occasion Urvashi had to part from the king under some sort of breach, for which she changed form; *(d) Urvashi returned to her form and got reunited with the king, but there came a time when she had to return to the heaven to serve Indra (e) The two had a son together, named Ayush (‡§Ü‡§Ø‡•Å‡§∑). Whether they lived together happily ever after is questionable, because there is one more story in Mahabharata in which Arjuna (a descendant of Pururava) goes to heaven and meets Urvashi there. Hence, by inference she and Pururava lived together during his lifetime, as he was a mortal. Adaptations by KalidasaPatel, G. (2014). [in Gujarati] Vikramorvashiyamnu Mool ane Kavini Maulikata. Chapter-25, Part-2: Vikramorvashiyam in 'Mahakavi Kalidasvirachitam Malavikagnimitram, Vikramorvashiyam', Vol. 3 of Mahakavi Kalidasa-Samagra Granthavali, p. 238-240.Pandya, S. M. & Shah, U. (1993). The Sources of the Play and the Changes Brought about by Kalidasa. (Ed.s) Chapter-3, Mahakakavikalidasavirachitam Vikramorvashiyam, Saraswati Pustak Bhandar, Ahmedabad. p. 25-29. Adaptations by Kalidasa add novelty and surprise in the original subject, and infuse fresh depth and perspective. Here is how: (1) Urvashi was banished from the heaven, but how she got that punishment is Kalidasa's own imagination. According to Vikramorvashiyam, she was playing the part of Lakshmi in a play directed by Bharata Muni, performed in the court of Indra. In the scene of Lakshmi Svayamvara, she was asked who she had given her heart to. Urvashi, smitten by Pururava at that time, could not distinguish between her role and her self, and ended up saying 'Pururava' instead of 'Purushottama'. This lack of mindfulness angered Bharata Muni, who cursed her to fall to earth. This curse, actually, was a boon for her. Indra, out of his appreciation for her, modified the curse by saying that she would return from earth when Pururava sees the face of their son. (2) Some of the original versions suggest that Urvashi returned to heaven the moment her conditions were breached, without consideration for Pururava's repeated requests and his anguish at parting. However, Kalidasa adds the wonderful element of Sangamaniya gem (‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ó‡§Æ‡§®‡•Ä‡§Ø ‡§Æ‡§£‡§ø) for reuniting Urvashi and Pururava with their son Ayush, and then adds visit by Narada carrying the message from Indra that since Pururava is a valued friend of his, and in future wars with demons his support is going to be pivotal, Urvashi could stay with him until end of his days. This addition of Indra's gesture at once depicts Urvashi's hesitation and pain to leave, desire to stay, being bound by the curse - all being eased by Indra's favor. (3) Forest of Kartikeya where women were banned: Again, the original story mentions that the two were sent apart due to a curse, but Kalidasa adds the imagination that when the two went to Mount Gandhamadana (‡§ó‡§®‡•ç‡§ß‡§Æ‡§æ‡§¶‡§® ‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§§) after their marriage, Pururava once stared at a young Gandharva girl named Udayavati, who was playing by the river. Enraged by jealousy or displeasure, Urvashi stormed out of that place - and went straight into a forest which was prohibited for women. Thus she turned into a vine. Pururava, moved to extreme sixth stage of being in love, tried to find her and this is an opportunity Kalidasa creates to add narration of Nature, and conversation of Pururava with various elements of Nature, flora and fauna. Description of Nature (‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡§ø ‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§£‡§®) is Kalidasa's forte and the metaphors he uses to describe his beloved are wonderful. (4) Urvashi's dilemma: Kalidasa adds complexity confronting the character of Urvashi by introducing the condition that when Pururava sees the face of their son, Urvashi will return to the heaven. In Vikramorvashiyam, Urvashi conceives and delivers the son quickly without the knowledge of Pururava who never saw her pregnant (explanation is that she is a celestial being, and they have different patterns of carrying children). Son is placed under the care of Chyavan Rishi, who makes sure that since he is a Kshatriya, he would be taught Dhanurveda along with other systems of knowledge, but he will abide by the rules of the Ashram. The day Ayush breaks the code of non-violence by hunting a bird who carried a red gem, is also the day when Pururava's cherished Sangamaniya Gem is picked up by a bird who believed it to be a piece of red meat. Someone brings to the king the dead bird with the gem and the arrow that hit the bird. Chyavana Rishi sends back Ayush to Pururava's court. King reads the inscription on the arrow, which says that it belonged to \\"Ayush, the son of Ila's son (implying Pururava) and Urvashi\\". Urvashi tells the whole story of curse to Pururava who is very happy that his bane of being childless is removed, who appoints Ayush as the Prince and is very unhappy that Urvashi would now have to leave. At that point Narada brings the happy tidings and the play ends. PlotPandit, P. S. (1879). The Vikramorvashiyam: A Drama in Five Acts by Kalidasa (Ed.) The Department of Public Instruction, Govt. Central Book Depot, Bombay. Urvashi Pururavas, painting by Raja Ravi Varma. Once upon a time, Urvashi, who was an Apsara, was returning to heaven from the palace of Kuber on mount Kailas leaving her son Risyasringa with Vibhandaka rishi. She was with Chitralekha, Rambha and many others, but the demon named Keshin abducted Urvashi and Chitralekha and went in the North-East direction. The group of Apsaras started screaming for help, which was heard by the king Pururava, who rescued the two. Urvashi and Pururava fall in love at first sight. The nymphs were immediately summoned back to heaven. King tried to focus on his work, but he was unable to shake off the preoccupation with the thoughts of Urvashi. He wondered if his was a case of unrequited love. Urvashi, who had gone in invisible form to see the king, wrote a message on a birch leaf instantly, conforming her love. Unfortunately, the leaf was carried off by the wind and stopped only at the feet of the queen Aushinari, the princess of Kashi and the wife of Pururava. The queen was enraged at first, but later declared that she would not come in the way of lovers. Before Urvashi and Pururava could talk, Urvashi was summoned again to heaven to perform in a play. She was so smitten that she missed her cue and mispronounced her lover's name during the performance as Pururava instead of Purushottama. As a punishment, Urvashi was banished from heaven, which was modified by Indra as until the moment her human lover laid eyes on the child that she would bear him. After a series of mishaps, including Urvashi's temporary transformation into a vine, the curse was eventually lifted, and the lovers were allowed to remain together on Earth as long as Pururava lived.

The origins of Videon date back to October 1959 when original General Manager Claude Boucher applied to the Lakehead Public Utilities Board in Port Arthur, Ontario (now Thunder Bay) to provide cable television service to the town through the new company Lakehead Videon. The cable system was built and was sold to Maclean-Hunter in July 1970. This was done because the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) had complained that Famous Players had 50% ownership of Lakehead Videon and Metro Videon, which in turn was primarily American owned. CRTC rules stated that Canadian cable companies must be at least 80% Canadian-owned. Videon Cablesystems, Inc. (also Videon Cable-TV, Winnipeg Videon Inc., Metro Videon Community Antenna Television Inc.) was a cable television company serving Winnipeg on the west side of the Red River from August 14, 1968 until 2002. The company was owned by the Moffat family through their company Moffat Communications Ltd. Randall L. Moffat was its president.  History  Metro Videon Community Antenna Television Inc. was formed \\"quietly\\" in 1962, after three additional television signals -- CBWFT, KCND, and CJAY, started broadcasting in 1960. The initial partners were Randy Moffat, owner of CKY (radio); Ralph Misener, owner of CJAY Channel 7 television; Famous Players theatres, owner of several cable TV systems including the one at Thunder Bay, Ontario; and Claude Boucher, Videon's first general manager. They expanded service to Pinawa, Manitoba before approaching the federal Department of Transport for a license to operate in Winnipeg. Metro Videon had waited to apply for a cable-TV license because the Department had \\"frozen\\" new applications for community antenna (CATV) companies to serve towns and cities so they could draw up regulations for this type of service. But yet at the same time, the company was so confident that everything would work out, that prior to the announcement of the service, they pre-purchased and installed large amounts of coaxial cable underground in parts of Tuxedo, Fort Garry, and Assiniboia. They paid a rental rate of 60 cents per 100 feet of coax. to Manitoba Telephone System (MTS). This saved Videon money because MTS was placing their telephone cables underground at the same time. Preliminary negotiations with MTS for use of telephone poles and underground right-of-way to string coaxial cable through the western half of metropolitan Winnipeg went from 1963 to 1967. Later in the year, Videon had started to construct the headend and cable TV infrastructure. Videon had hoped to include the suburbs east of the Red River, but this fell to another company, Greater Winnipeg Cablevision. The new cable company announced that they would charge $10 to connect to their service, and $5 per month to subscribe to the signals. This low fee remained much in effect until the advent of Canadian pay television in 1983. Videon's first administrative offices were located at 2 Donald St. South, but moved to 651 Stafford St. around January 1976. For a short while in 1976, Videon carried the audio of CJOB-FM on cable 6, CBW-FM on cable 7, CKY-FM on cable 9. The CRTC did not allow this and Videon had to discontinue the service in early April 1976. A month later Videon had to pull a special closed-circuit program signal between Health Sciences Centre and the St. Boniface Hospital because the CRTC did not allow \\"point-to-point undertakings.\\" In 1978 Videon applied to the CRTC for a 50 cent fee increase, the first since the cable company began operations in Winnipeg. After the major rebuild of 1987, Videon added the Assiniboia Downs Racing Network on January 23, 1988. This made possible for the first time so-called \\"off track\\" betting. In the 1990s, Videon bought up several locally owned cable companies, creating Canada's fifth largest cable company. They had expanded their reach to include Headingley. They also purchased cable companies in northwest Ontario and Alberta (Edmonton and 24 other communities). In 2001 the Moffat family sold Videon Cable-TV Inc. to SHAW Cable of Calgary, Alberta.  Coverage area  Videon served Winnipeg proper, Assiniboia, St. James, Brooklands, West Kildonan, Old Kildonan, Fort Garry, Charleswood, and Tuxedo. Videon also served West and North Edmonton, Alberta. The first area to receive cable-TV was St. Norbert in August 1968. The headend and administrative offices were located in a former A&P; supermarket building at 651 Stafford St. until 1995 when Videon moved to a suburban location at 22 Scurfield Blvd. in Fort Garry. The headend and administrative offices for Edmonton were located in the current West Edmonton Shaw Cable building at 10450-178 St.  Programming = Distant signals  From August 14, 1968 until March 1986 Videon carried two Fargo, North Dakota stations, KTHI-TV 11 (ABC then NBC), and KXJB-TV 4 (CBS). The distance to the headend was long and Videon applied to the CRTC for a microwave link, which was approved on July 5, 1974, and installed at Tolstoi, Manitoba to pick up these two stations directly from Fargo. However, during very hot and humid summer weather, the signal quality would degrade to the point of being unwatchable. Later on Videon received KXJB via a translator at Glasston, North Dakota (K58BP). On July 9, 1975 Videon added the signal of KGFE (PBS) Grand Forks. Initially Videon tested the channel on 3 and 7 to find out which had the least interference from local over the air channels (CBWFT and CKY-TV respectively). They later went with cable 3. After several years of complaints of poor signal quality, Videon applied to the CRTC to replace its NBC and CBS affiliates with those of WDIV 4 and WJBK 2, both from Detroit, Michigan via Anik satellite, and in March, 1986 the Fargo stations were replaced with those from Detroit. However by 1993, complaints over the level of crime reporting on the commercial Detroit stations lead Videon to not renew its agreement to carry WDIV and WJBK, and instead replaced them with other stations, first from Toledo, Ohio, and later from Minneapolis, Minnesota.  Community programming  Between August, 1968 and 1976, Videon used to have a simple B&W; camera housed on a track go back and forth to display the weather on analog dials. At the end of one way was a small poster for advertising. This was cablecast on channel 13 until 1976 when Videon went to an all electronic text system which is still used today. > The Broadcasting Act, passed by Parliament in 1968, made CATV systems an > integral part of the broadcasting system and established the Canadian Radio > Television Commission to regulate and supervise all aspects on the > Broadcasting system, with a view to implementing the broadcasting policy > enunciated in the act. The commission recognized the need for a medium of local expression and took positive steps to fill this need. The CRTC summarized its policy as follows: > Cable television, which began as a service to remote communities with > reception difficulty, has now become a major factor in the Canadian > Broadcasting System, and has a potential for a wide range of services in all > communities. These community programming services can be of a complementary, > rather than a competitive nature to those already provided by other > broadcasting services. The CRTC mandated that cable companies across Canada provide a channel for the use of the community. They had the revolutionary idea that Canadian airwaves belong to the Canadian people. The cable companies were expected to spend ten per cent of their income on a Community Channel. At that time, the CRTC had policies for the operation of the Community Channel, but no regulations. They wanted people across the country to experiment with various ideas before regulations were put into place. In September 1972, Winnipeg Videon Inc. hired a program manager to search the community for individuals and groups who would be interested in, or benefit from, programming on the channel. Videon provided two community channels: 1. Public Access - Programs produced by the public, using Videon's facilities and staff. Individuals were trained in the use of the equipment. 2. Informational Programming - National Film Board material and tapes and film provided locally. When mobile facilities became available later, Videon took suggestions from the community as to what event to cover, but reserved to make the choice. VPW began on channel 9 and moved to channel 13 in September 1975 when CKND went on the air, then channel 11 after CHMI moved to channel 8 from 13. Videon had a program sharing agreement with Greater Winnipeg Cablevision to retransmit programming on each others community channel. Videon wanted to cablecast the monthly Community Committee meetings, and they appeared at the Fort Rouge meeting in April, 1977 to request that their recording equipment be allowed. The first cablecast meeting took place at the VPW studio at 657 Stafford St. on June 21, although later meetings were held at the regular Community Committee rooms. A newspaper article at the time quotes politician June Westbury saying \\"I support the idea because the more coverage we have, the more community involvement we can hope for.\\" Videon carried coverage of the CBC licence renewal hearings in October 1978 on VPW13, which were one of the first CRTC hearings carried via cable television in Canada. From 1996 till 2001 Videon produced a weekly public affairs phone-in program, Insight, mainly hosted by Kelly Parker. It featured topics, such as downtown revitalization, urban crime, and other local issues. One of its most noted episodes was the WREB Mayoral Forum of October 1998, held at the Walker Theatre in downtown Winnipeg. However this program was cancelled when SHAW purchased Videon in 2001. For a time in the 1980s they used a song from The Alan Parsons Project, \\"Where's the Walrus\\", while a narrator, Richard Hersley, told of the community programming services offered by Videon Cable-tv in Winnipeg. Prior to that the title theme from the movie Benji was used as background music to the VPW13 daily open. In the early 1990s Videon lost its corporate commitment to community programming and with the permission of the CRTC, cut its programming staff in half. The layoffs were a sad \\"how not to do a mass layoff\\" chapter in the history of the company. As the staff were informed off-site, the locks on the doors were changed and the remaining staff were not allowed into the building until \\"job re-entrance interviews\\" were conducted. Most jobs were changed and neither the staff nor the programming was ever the same. What once was a leader in community programming, became another victim of corporate greed. Early in 1979, the CRTC allowed Canadian companies to purchase TVRO equipment and use it to receive and then transmit Canadian broadcasts. In September 1979 Winnipeg was the first city in Canada to receive the House of Commons via the Anik-B satellite and cablecast on VSP-7. On October 30, 1982 Videon transferred some of its programming from VPW-13 such as city hall, community committee meetings and created a secondary community access channel, VSP-7. Later in the decade it carried Manitoba Educational Television, Genesis Storytime. In 1982 there was a consumer info show and another segment on law, produced by the Public Legal Education Association. And in 1983 a program called Health and Wellness aired Wednesday nights at 7 p.m. and replayed Sundays at 6:30 p.m. When VSP-7 wasn't cablecasting video programming, it would function as the Community Billboard channel.  Live coverage events  City Council, Community Committees, Manitoba Legislature Question Period, House of Commons Proceedings, Canada Day celebrations. Until 1991 Videon replayed City Council meetings on Saturday mornings. However, for some unknown reason they stopped doing this after signing a multi-year contract with the City Hall Clerk's Department. Also, until the early 1990s Videon carried Live coverage of Community Committee meetings. These are no longer carried.  Tiering  By 1989 the CRTC allowed MuchMusic and TSN to be part of basic cable rather than pay television stations. So Videon created a tier of services beginning in July 1989 called the Variety Pak. It was sold for $5.95/month and included TSN, CNN, WTVS 56 Detroit, A&E;, TNN, TV5, and MuchMusic. This package was to become known as Tier 1. On January 1, 1995 several new Canadian satellite-cable (also called specialty) networks started broadcasting. These were Bravo!, Discovery Channel Canada, NCN, Life Network, and WTN. R√©seau de l'information (RDI) was part of basic cable. This was Tier 2. And by this time, people in other cities such as Toronto and Vancouver were starting to get annoyed at the high cost of cable- tv, threatening to disconnect their cable service and get a grey-market DirecTv satellite service instead. Tier 3 was implemented in stages between September 1997 and October 1998, beginning with CTV News1, MuchMoreMusic, ROBtv, Star!, and TalkTv.  Pay television  In 1983 Videon had two channels left for pay-tv. It used just one of them, choosing to offer the national First Choice service on channel 22. Videon claimed at the time that they might be able to make channel 23 (J) available for another pay-tv service, having to choose between C-Channel or Superchannel. But they did not follow through on this, possibly because of co-channel interference. A long- time dispute between Videon Cable-tv and MTS over ownership of the wiring and poles used to carry the signal caused Videon to get far behind other cablecos. in offering an expanded channel lineup. Both parties were very stubborn for several years, hindering the growth of cable tv service in Winnipeg. However, it wasn't until a full cable rebuild in the summer of 1987 that Videon was able to offer the other pay television services. Videon used the Zenith Z-Tac cable scrambling system to keep its pay-tv signals from theft. This was an advanced addressable system where each descrambler has an ID, similar to an IP address on a computer today. Beginning June 28, 1991, Videon added three U.S. Superstations to its pay-tv lineup: WTBS Atlanta (cable 33), WGN Chicago (cable 34), and WSBK Boston (cable 35).  Internet service  In the mid-1990s when Internet access from home became affordable, Videon had helped to create a high-speed cable modem service called Wave. Then in March 1999 Videon switched to the @Home Network. For business users, Videon had FiberLink, a SONET-based voice, data communications line, which has the ability to interconnect LANs and PBXs.  Expansion to other towns  In the 1990s Videon bought up several locally owned cable companies, creating Canada's fifth largest cable company. They had expanded their reach to include Headingley. They also purchased a cable company in Alberta.  Videon is sold  In 2001 the Moffat family sold Videon Cable-tv Inc. to SHAW Cable of Calgary, Alberta.
