Youth  Etxenike was the son of the medical doctor Pedro Etxenike and the teacher Felisa Landiribar. Growing up with one brother and one sister in a small navarrese village (with about 800 inhabitants at the time) he later attended a Capuchin boarding school He attended the University of Navarre and graduated in Physics in 1972, receiving the Special Degree Prize and End-of-Studies Award. In 1973 began his studies at the University of Cambridge with a March stipend. In 1976 he obtained his Ph.D. (with a thesis directed by John Pendry) and in 1977 he received (directed by Rufus Ritchie) a Doctorate in Physics from the Autonomous University of Barcelona, for which he received the Special Doctorate Prize.  Academic career  After post-doctoral studies at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee and as Nordita Fellow of the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen and with stays at Lund University he became Professor of Solid State Physics at the University of Barcelona in 1978. In 1980 he stepped down from this position to join the government of the Basque Autonomous Region. In 1984 he returned to academia as a visiting lecturer at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge. In 1986 he moved back to the Basque Country as Professor of Condensed Matter Physics at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) at its campus in Donostia / San Sebasti√°n. Since 1999 he is also president of the Donostia International Physics Center (DIPC). Etxenike has co-authored over 400 scientific articles. His research has focused on explaining the behaviour of solid bodies and their interaction with beams of charged particles. His work has opened new lines of research and has stimulated innovative theoretical and experimental lines of work in very diverse fields of condensed matter physics such as electron and tunnel microscopy, physical chemistry on the femtosecond scale, electronic surface localization, reverse photo-emission, atomic collisions, the interaction of ions with plasma particles, ion implantation and surface excitations in superfluid helium. Many works, starting with his PhD thesis in Cambridge study the interaction of electrons, atoms, and ions with surfaces. An important concept introduced and developed by Etxenike are image-potential states at metal surfaces in which electrons can be trapped in the potential of their own image charge. Etxenike and co-workers computed and analyzed these states for many different materials and surfaces as well as their interaction with surface excitations such as surface plasmons, surface plasmon polaritons, and surface phonons. Etxenike is co-author of a highly cited review on the theory of surface plasmons They analyzed theoretically the technique of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in order to interpret STM images and, in particular, relate them to the topography of the studied surfaces and to the spectroscopy of surface states (\\"scanning tunneling spectroscopy\\"). More recent works study topological insulators, attosecond physics, and quantum plasmonics. Etxenike has directed 27 PhD theses. Among his former students are Javier Aizpurua, Ricardo Di√®z Mui√±o, and Jos√© Mar√≠a Pitarke. Notable are also Etxenike interest and ability in disseminating scientific and technological knowledge and making it more accessible to society at large. He has been very active in this field in recent years, giving numerous lectures in different university, cultural and business forums, at which he has always defended the cultural value of scientific activity and encouraged young people to pursue science. He has co-organized outreach activities such as since 2010 the triennial festival \\"Passion for Knowledge\\" in San Sebasti√°n.  Political activity  In 1980 he gave up his professorship in Barcelona to join the first government of the Basque Autonomous Community after the Francoist dictatorship. In the government of Carlos Garaikoetxea he first served as Minister of Education and in 1983 he became Minister of Education and Culture and Spokesman for the Government until the end of the legislative period in 1984. One of the milestones in this legislative period was the law on the normalisation of the use of Basque, for which Etxenike was the driving force and proponent. These early years of the Department of Education were also crucial in putting in place most of the foundations in the education system of the Basque Autonomous Community, including freedom of education. The setting up of R&D; centres and the internationalization of study scholarships were also promoted. After leaving government politics, Etxenike continues to play an important role in the science policy of the Basque country. He was central in founding and leading a number of centers, agencies, and initiatives that are now leading research institutions in the Basque country. He is the founder and first president of Donostia International Physics Center (DIPC), founded in 1999. He was a promoter and creator of the mixed CSIC-UPV/EHU centre, the Centre for Materials Physics (CFM) and was its first director (1999-2001) and is still president of the Materials Physics Center associated with CFM. He played a similar role for the Cooperative Research Centre CIC nanoGUNE (founded 2009) and is (in 2019) chairman of its Governing Board. In 2007 he was among the founders of the Academy of Sciences, Arts and Letters of the Basque Country Jakiunde and served as its first president until 2012. He then was named Honorary Chairman. Other positions held include membership of the governing board of the CSIC (Spanish National Research Council) (2001-2007), deputy chairperson of the board of the franco-spanish Euskampus Foundation, and vice-chairmanship of the innovation agency of the Basque government, Innobasque (2008-2012). Since 2012 he chairs the panel of judges of the Princess-of-Asturias-Prize for Scientific and Technical Research.

It envisions itself as a regional center of excellence in science and mathematics education at the secondary level that shall develop potential leaders in science and other related fields. It seeks to develop responsible and morally upright science- oriented leaders through relevant and globally competitive science and mathematics education programs. History Alabel National Science High School was established in Alabel, Sarangani Province through RA 8078, authored by the late Congressman James L. Chiongbian. It was conceived in 1995, primarily, to cater the intellectually capable students of Sarangani Province and nearby areas. Classes were formally organized and began on June 3, 1996. Students are intensively screened and mostly belong to the upper 10% of the graduating pupils of the elementary schools in the region.http://rshsxii.edu.ph/about/admission-policy The school started its operation with zero budget. Funds for the maintenance and operation of the school were sourced out from private individuals, GOs, NGOs and LGUs of Alabel, Malapatan, and Sarangani Province. Textbooks, books, chairs and other school needs were provided by nearby high schools and DECS Division Office. Teachers were borrowed from Alabel National High School and it was manned on a part-time basis by the principal of Kling National High School. The school received its first budget in CY 1997, with appropriations for salaries of three teacher items and ‚Ç±45,000 allotment for school maintenance and other operating expenses (MOOE), until finally, the school was allotted appropriations for salaries of four teacher items and ‚Ç±1,122,000.00 for MOOE in the 1999 General Appropriation Act. On June 1, 1999, through DECS Order No. 58, the school was designated as the Regional Science High School for Region XI effective SY 1999‚Äì2000, in replacement of Philippine Science High School in Mintal, Davao City which was previously identified as the Regional Science Competition. During SY 1999‚Äì2000, the school has finally occupied its newly constructed building worth ‚Ç±5 million, erected at a 5-hectare school site donated by the benevolent Alcantara Family. The school has a water system and school cafeteria with a total budget of ‚Ç±3 million. This project, worth ‚Ç±8 million, was constructed through the CDF of the late Hon. Congressman James L. Chiongbian. On August 6, 2002, when the Soccsksargen area was turned over to Region XII, the Alabel National Science High School became the Regional Science High School for Region XII.

It was released on July 28, 2014 as the fourth single from his debut studio album Worlds (2014). Robinson wrote, produced, and performed the track. Musically, the song contains elements of disco and hip-hop, as well as sampling of soul music. Vocally, the song contains a text-to-speech voice incorrectly translating \\"never seen\\" Japanese song titles that have been chopped and screwed in a rap-like style. An official music video for the single premiered on August 14, 2014, and involves footage of Japan filtered with effects including those of 8-bit video games. The song was well-received from critics, and was a hit on the American Dance/Electronic Songs chart. Composition With \\"Flicker\\", one of Porter Robinson's favorite songs of his debut studio album Worlds (2014), he wanted to experiment with samples of soul music, which he became a fan of ever since he listened to his favorite album, Daft Punk's second studio record Discovery (2001). The result was a hip-hop- style instrumental that he felt was \\"incomplete\\" with only drums and the phased samples. He didn't initially plan \\"Flicker\\" to be a track on Worlds until some time later when he was using a translation website to translate \\"song titles that would never be seen\\" incorrectly into Japanese, and then put the Japanese text into a text-to-speech program for it to be converted into a WAV file for him to \\"cut it into a rap\\" which he called a \\"charming little thing\\". Finally, he composed the lead melody and chord progression. Robinson described \\"Flicker\\" as more of a \\"journey\\" than a pop song, saying that it goes \\"to a lot of different places\\" structure-wise.Worlds Commentary. Porter Robinson. 2014. Spotify.

However, there were never significant Spanish communities on the island, which was why it easily occupied by the British.  History  The arrival of Spaniards in Jamaica began in 1494, with the arrival of Christopher Columbus to the island in search of gold (as in Cuba and the Spanish, where he had reported the existence of the island, calling it Xaymaca, intending to say, in the indigenous language, \\"place of gold blessed\\"), but then discovered that there was no gold on the island. Columbus named the island as Santiago and used it as a mini-state for his family. In addition, he and his sailors founded some settlements, such as Santa Gloria (now St. Ann's Bay), named by Columbus, as it was the first that was sighted when they came to Jamaica. In 1505 Juan de Guzman, Duke of Medina Sidonia in agreement with Columbus proposed a project to populate the island but Ferdinand turned it down because he worried that the cumulative power nobiliaria house. In 1509 the first Spanish settlement on the island was founded which was named New Sevilla and was located in a place near Santa Gloria. As early as 1510, the first governor of Jamaica, Juan de Esquivel, was appointed and the island was incorporated into the Viceroyalty of New Spain. In 1524, the settlers left New Seville and, around 1534, moved to the current Spanish Town, founded by the a colonial governor of Jamaica Francisco de Garay with the name of Our Lady of the Blessed Villa de la Vega, Santiago de la Vega, St. Jago de la Vega or Villa de la Vega (the place that the English renamed Spanish Town when they conquered the island in 1655). Here the oldest cathedral in Jamaica was built. Eventually the Spanish founded other settlements elsewhere across the island (such as Las Chorreras or Eight rivers, and Santa Cruz), but that city was chosen as the capital of Jamaica. The settlers, as they used to do in the colonies in which they settled, took crops (such as sugar cane and banana) and pets (including dogs, cats and horses), to Jamaica.This is Carzy My friends this is Alayna Simpson from Stella maris Prep in grade 4 my friends do not Most Spaniards arrived on the island for gold and silver but due to its absence in Jamaica, they generally neglected the island, being based only on the coastal plains, mainly in the northern part of the island. So, Jamaica became a center mainly supply and descanso. However, from 1595, pirates, buccaneers and English privateers began to attack the island with some frequency, in order to challenge the papal bull, which stated that all territories of the new world belonged to the kingdoms of Castile and Portugal. The 1596 attack was followed by attacks in 1603, 1640 and 1643. Thus, the Spanish were forcibly evicted by the English at Ocho Rios in St. Ann. However, it was in 1655 when the English army, led by the British Admiral Sir William Penn and General Robert Venables, finally occupied the island, taking over the last Spanish fort in Jamaica. Dominated the Spanish colony by the British, the fear of loss of the island official from Spain meant that, in 1659, the political and noble Spanish Juan Francisco de Leiva, began to develop means to expel foreigners on the island, proposed sending a \\"dispatched armed Peninsula, full of people who should be working and enjoyment such as the Canary\\". Thus, a group of Spanish soldiers came to Jamaica, who settled in the already Santiago de la Vega, reinforcing this Spanish community in the capital of the island, to exert greater resistance to British occupation. Meanwhile, in 1660, was named the first British governor of Jamaica, Edward D'Oyley. The British government was already a sign of sovereignty, but Spain did not recognize Jamaica as a British colony until 1670. Furthermore, in 1660, as in other Spanish colonies, Jamaica became a refuge for Jews, also attracting those who had been expelled from Spain and Portugal. Already in 1510 an agreement had been signed with the Jews, shortly after the son of Christopher Columbus was established on the island. The Jewish community in Jamaica, mainly composed of merchants and traders, were forced to lead a secret life, calling themselves \\"Portugals\\". All this increased the Hispanic community on the island. With the signing of the Treaty of Madrid in 1670, Spain finally gave Jamaica and the Cayman Islands to the UK. After the official British occupation of the island, the Spanish colonists fled after freeing their slaves, which were scattered throughout the mountains, joining the Maroons, slaves who had previously escaped from the Spanish to live with the Ta√≠nos. The Jamaican Maroons fought the British during the 18th century After the British took Jamaica, the Jews of the colony, many of whom were from Spain and Portugal, decided that the best defense to try to prevent the recovery of the island from Spain was encouraged to make the colony a base for pirates of the Caribbean. With pirates installed in Puerto Real, the Spanish would be deterred from attacking. British leaders agreed on the feasibility of this strategy to prevent aggression was abroad.\\"10 and began an arrivo of Caribbean pirates to the island again.\\" - previous section in \\"\\" makes no sense  Legacy  According to JG Bruton, apart from Santiago de la Vega, other places named by the Spaniards during this time, and extending across the island are eight rivers (also known as Robert Wallace Thompson, Las Chorreras by Spanish coloniales5) Rio Bueno, Santa Cruz, 6 Mi√±o7 River and Port Antonio (also known as Thompson, during the Spanish era, Puerto Ant√≥n5) .6 Also, the name of Montego Bay, the capital of St. James Parish, could lead according Bruton, the Spanish name Bay butter, referring to the large number of pigs used there in the industry butter, 12 and the people Oracabessa derived surely the Spanish word Cabeza de Oro with which would be designated the people during the Spanish domination of all, due to the existence of a nearby hill to the region, whose summit is covered, at certain times of the year, yellow flowers. For its part, the names of other places, according to the author, are a translation of the names by which the Spaniards called it: Thus Bay Dry Harbour (Puerto Seco) was a place where he entered Col√≥n for water when he sought refuge with two caravels already in bad shape and partially destroyed. Runaway Bay (Bay Escape), meanwhile, is a bay from which fled in 1665, the Spanish governor of the island, Ysassi, bound for Cuba. On the other hand, the town's name derive from the Spanish Moneague The adjective Monte de Agua (the name by which the Spaniards called it because it is a village surrounded by hills, one of which emanates a creek) 7 or, as Yates, La Manigua, word much used in Cuba to refer to a dense forest and impenetrable.5 Some Spanish gentilicios of the island, however, have been lost, such is the case of the R√≠o de la Villa (Current Copper River name appointed to the region by the British, probably as HP Jacobs, after seeing the word copper on a map, pointing at one point there, and believe that was the name of the Rio5) and river near Spanish Town, Boca Water, river is now called Bog Walk (Paseo del Pantano) .7 However, Robert Wallace Thompson rejects the idea of Bruton on the relationship between the current names of Jamaican places mentioned the names designated by the Spanish in the same the absence, according to him, documents and colonial sources indicating, if you like, the existence of those names during the Spanish era of the island, indicating that such names derive from Indian words (Orocabezzas, perhaps Orocavis, word found in Santo Domingo) or English (Ocho Rios, Port Antonio maybe) .5 The Spanish introduced many crops Jamaica as sugar cane, bananas and citrus. Also it was they who apparently introduced most of the pets that are currently on the island, such as pigs, horses, goats, cats, dogs and chickens.

It was formerly known as a subspecies of Melaleuca apodocephala but was reassessed in 2010 and raised to species status. Its branches are corky, the leaves pointed although not prickly and the flowers are creamy white, tipped with yellow. Description Melaleuca calcicola is a shrub growing to about tall with corky branches that are glabrous when mature. Its leaves are arranged alternately, long and wide, linear to narrow egg-shaped and slightly fleshy. The ends are pointed although not prickly. The flowers are white to creamy white with the tips of the stamens a contrasting yellow. The flowers are arranged in heads on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering and also on the sides of the branches. Each head contains up to 15 individual flowers and is up to in diameter. The petals are long and fall off as the flowers mature. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flowers and there are 12 to 23 stamens per bundle. The flowering period is mainly in November and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules long with teeth around the edges and in clusters along the branches. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca adopdocephala subsp. calcicola was first formally described in 1999 by Bryan Barlow and Lyndley Craven in Australian Systematic Botany from a specimen collected in a nature reserve north-east of Condingup. It was raised to species status in 2010 by Craven, Lepschi and Cowley in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (calcicola) is derived from the Latin calcium meaning \\"calcium\\" hence lime and the Latin -cola meaning \\"dweller\\", referring to the preference of this species for growing on limestone.

Due to thousands of youth submitting their forms on the same day, these activities have the character of mass demonstrations. The movement had in a first round in November 2014 achieved a wave of individual land applications in Windhoek, Namibia's capital, which had since spread to other Namibian towns. The Affirmative Repositioning movement had threatened to take the land by force had the applications not have been processed and approved by July 2015 in the local municipalities.https://www.namibian.com.na/77892/read/AR-to-launch-Peoples- Litigation-Centre  The Namibianhttps://allafrica.com/stories/201901220516.html  Namibia: AR to Challenge Squatters Law After Activist's Bail - allAfrica.com Establishment and land applications On 9 November 2014, Amupanda, Kambala and Nauyoma cleared land which they named \\"Erf number 2014\\" in Windhoek's affluent Kleine Kuppe suburb, stating high rental prices in town and nepotism in the municipality as reasons for their actions. The action was widely seen as illegal land grabbing. Amupanda, who was SWAPO Party Youth League (SPYL) Secretary for Information, Publicity and Mobilisation at that time and also served in the youth wing's executive committee, resigned his positions shortly before all three activists were expelled from SWAPO for their actions. This expulsion was ordered by the 'Top four' of SWAPO party: president Hifikepunye Pohamba, vice-president Hage Geingob, secretary-general Nangolo Mbumba, and his deputy Laura McLeod-Katjirua. The trio vacated the illegally occupied plot after a few days. In the meantime, AR activists started mobilising young people to apply for land at the Windhoek municipality. They used social media and existing SWAPO Youth League party structures. On 21 November 2014 the City of Windhoek received 14,000 individual land applications. In a second round of mass action on 27 February 2015, Windhoek received a further 2,500 applications. Land applications were also handed in to the municipalities of Walvis Bay (9,500 applications), Okahandja (4,000), Swakopmund (3,000), Ongwediva (2,500), Oshakati (2,500), Keetmanshoop (800), Rundu (400), Otjiwarongo (200) and Tsumeb (200). In April 2015 the municipality of Henties Bay offered 120 serviced land plots to applicants of the AR movement, among them Amupanda, Nauyoma, and Kambala. This move has been widely criticised, and the AR leaders were accused of misusing their movement's goals by applying for plots in the upmarket holiday town of Henties Bay while being residents of Windhoek. the plots have not been transferred yet. In May 2016 all three AR leaders were reinstated as SWAPO members after they won a respective court case against the party. Reception AR has been described as the \\"biggest peaceful mass action since Namibia‚Äôs independence in 1990.\\" The level of organisation within the movement as well as the variety of political promises by its main activist Amupanda has raised the concern that AR might be a \\"political party in the making\\".

See description The Monckton Commission, officially the Advisory Commission for the Review of the Constitution of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, was set up by the British government under the chairmanship of Walter Monckton, 1st Viscount Monckton of Brenchley, in 1960. Its purpose was to investigate and make proposals for the future of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (or Central African Federation), made up of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland‚Äîrespectively equivalent to today's Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi. Members The Commission had 20 members, appointed as representatives of six different interest groups:CENTRAL AFRICA (ADVISORY COMMISSION), Hansard 24 November 1959. ;Representing the UK * Lord Monckton (chairman) * Donald MacGillivray (vice-chairman) * Elspeth Huxley * Daniel Jack * R.

It advocated a majority of black African members in the Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesian legislatures and giving these territories the option to leave the Federation after five years.R Blake, (1977). A History of Rhodesia, Knopf P.331. .P Murray, (2005). British Documents on the End of Empire: Central Africa, Part I, Volume 9, pp.lxxiv-v, lxxx. Released in October 1960, the report advocated sweeping changes to be made to the federal structure, including black African majorities in the Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesian legislatures. The Federal Prime Minister Sir Roy Welensky was outraged when the report was published, calling it the \\"death knell of federation\\" and rejecting it out of hand.Collapsing Bastion (24 October 1960), Time Magazine; accessed 21 May 2007. Black nationalist opinion was just as opposed, but on different grounds. All nationalists wanted an end to federation, and independence for the territories as black-majority-ruled states. The Monckton Commission toured the Federation in February 1960. It had been given limited terms of reference and was boycotted by the opposition Labour Party and the black nationalists in Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia. As the Commission's composition seemed weighted towards a continuation of the Federation, its report disappointed the British government. The Monckton Commission reported widespread and sincere opposition to the Federation in the two northern territories. It considered Federation could not survive without at least a major devolution of powers to Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia, giving more voting rights to black Africans and lessening racial discrimination. Most importantly, it also recommended that Britain should retain the right to allow the secession of either northern territory, recognising that black nationalists would not accept even a modified Federation. The British government broadly accepted Monckton's report, and this signaled a withdrawal of support for the Federation and the acceptance of early majority rule for Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia. Accordingly, and despite opposition from Sir Robert Armitage, the Governor of Nyasaland, from the Governments of the Federation and of Southern Rhodesia, and from some colleagues in the cabinet, Colonial Secretary Iain Macleod released Hastings Banda from detention on 1 April 1960 and immediately began to negotiate with him on Nyasaland's constitutional future. The state of emergency was lifted on 16 June 1960.C Baker, (1997). Nyasaland, 1959: A Police State? Vol. 50, No. 2, pp. 23‚Äì4. The Malawi Congress Party was formed in 1959 as the successor to the banned Nyasaland African Congress, with Banda as leader. Following an overwhelming Malawi Congress Party victory in August 1961 elections, preparations were made for Nyasaland's independence, which was achieved on 6 July 1964 under the name Malawi.J McCracken, (2012) A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 367‚Äì9. Conference to review the Federal Constitution The Federation was created under a British Act of Parliament of 1953 which made provision for a conference to be held at some time during the period 1960 to 1962 to review the Federal Constitution. The United Kingdom and Federal Government and the governments of the three constituent territories were to be represented, and any Federal Bill to amend the Constitution required the votes of two-thirds of the members of the Federal Assembly and had also to gain the assent of the United Kingdom parliament before becoming law. If the such proposed amendment were objected to by one or more of the territorial Legislatures, the British government could not override that objection if either House of Parliament resolved to accept it.G H Baxter and P W Hodgens, (1957). The Constitutional Status of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, International Affairs, Vol. 33, No. 4, p. 445 Following the report of the Monckton Commission, which suggested an early conference on the Federal Constitution, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Kilmuir stated the British government‚Äôs position on the future of the Federation. He accepted that it had no power to intervene in the internal affairs of Southern Rhodesia, but said that Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland remained the British government‚Äôs responsibility. Kilmuir also stated that the Act of Parliament that created the Federation expressly reserved to the British parliament the right to make such provision for the Federation‚Äôs future as it saw fit. J J B Somerville, (1963). The Central African Federation, International Affairs, Vol. 39, No. 3, p. 394-5 It had been agreed between the British and Federal governments in 1957 that a Federal Review Conference on future of Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland would be held in 1960, and this began in London, on 5 December 1960. However, the Federal talks were suspended on 16 December 1960 so that talks could be held on constitutional developments in two of the three constituent territories. These continued until February 1961, but did not include Nyasaland, as Hastings Banda, who only attended the conference with extreme reluctance, walked out on 12 December. The talks also failed to produce a workable constitutional solution for Northern Rhodesia; Banda‚Äôs success in the Nyasaland elections of August 1961 made it inevitable that Nyasaland at least would leave the Federation. J J B Somerville, (1963). The Central African Federation, International Affairs, Vol. 39, No. 3, pp. 397-8 The conference did little except to make clear the views of Banda for Nyasaland and Kaunda for Northern Rhodesia that Africans in the northern two territories wanted to leave the Federation, and of Joshua Nkomo that the African majority in Southern Rhodesia wanted majority rule. .

It is believed that 'Bircle' is a shortening of the phrase 'Birch Hill' as it is suggested that birch trees are found in abundance. This is very plausible idea until one searches for birch trees and finds the majority of trees in the area are sycamore and ash even where the thickly wooded areas reach the borders of the parish. Such names such as \\"Cleggs Wood\\" \\"Simpson Clough\\" and \\"Dobb Wood\\" appear on early Ordnance Survey maps. What adds confusion to the whole picture is that 'hill' does appear in the fourteenth century in the name of 'Birkhill' but it never found a permanent place. Over a period of time its name has also appeared as Brithull, 1243; Birlcil, 1246; Birkhill, 1334, 1573; but Bircle appears in the Diocese of Manchester directory in England.

The church was designed by architect George Shaw and was first dedicated in 1846. It is a small church and is a relatively early example of ecclesiologically correct gothic rock-faced ashlar with ashlar dressings and slate roofs with stone- coped gables. The nave and chancel both have hammer beam roofs rising from stone corbels. Carved angels holding shields are on the ends of the hammer beams. There are four stained glass windows in the nave. These were given in memory of loved ones. They depict Ruth, St Peter, St Paul and Mary, the mother of Jesus. On the wooded ceiling are carved angel figures. Long:-2.260 Lat:53.607 The Workhouse In 1852 plans were made for a workhouse to accommodate 400 inmates, with a separate 60-bed hospital in Jericho. Jericho workhouse, also known as the Bury Union Workhouse, was opened on 21 January 1857, and a year later the total expenditure for the scheme had swollen to ¬£20,481. Inmates came from as far away as Spain. In the 1881 census a 64-year- old named Susannah Allport, a Bonnet Maker (Milliner) from Salamanca was in residence. Today it is the site of Fairfield General Hospital. Historical timeline of Bury Workhouse The Road to Jericho 1775- A workhouse was built on Manchester Road, Redvales, Bury. 1825 - Bury Select Vestry recommended that the town needed to build a new workhouse or improve the existing one. 1827 - The Vestry decided to extend the existing Bury workhouse. 1837 - The Poor Law Union was formally declared on 8 February 1850 - The Bury Board of Guardians were refused an extension on the lease of land for the workhouses 1852 - The Bury Board of Guardians gave notice that they were prepared to receive plans and specifications for a new Union workhouse capable of support 400 inmates with suitable outbuildings, yards and conveniences. 1853 - The Vaccination Act introduced compulsory vaccination against smallpox. It required that every child, health permitting should be vaccinated within 3 months, or in the case of orphans, 4 months of birth. 1855 - Work began on the new Bury Union workhouse at Jericho, almost two miles east of Bury on Rochdale Old Road. 1857 - The Bury Union workhouse opened on 21 January. The total cost of building and land was ¬£21,418. 1858 - The Bury Union workhouse was consecrated by the Bishop of Manchester on 26 July 1862 - Additions were made to the Bury Union workhouse providing separate infant accommodation. 1867 - The poor law guardians were to control vaccination districts and pay vaccinator from 1 - 3 shillings per child vaccinated in the district. 1868 - Additions were made to the Bury Union Workhouse to provide separate accommodation for the 'insane'. 1877 - On 9 June the foundation stone for a new 32 bed infectious diseases hospital at Jericho site was made by Alderman John Duckworth, chairman of the Bury Board of Guardians. There was also to be a nurses' home and mortuary. 1878 - The infectious diseases unit was opened on 24 August 1903-1905 - A new 126 bed infirmary with a maternity ward and staff accommodation was erected on the Jericho site. The site was officially opened on 20 September 1905. 1904 - The Registrar General requested that the workhouse births were to be disguised by the use of postal addresses. Birth certificates for those born in the Bury Union workhouse gave the address 380 Rochdale Old Road, Bury and did not name the workhouse. 1911 - Bury Union workhouse added an annexe to house male inmates. 1929 - Bury Union workhouse was renamed Jericho Institution. 1946 - The last burial took place at the Jericho Institution cemetery. 1948 - The Jericho Institution became part of the NHS and was renamed Fairfield General Hospital. Cheesden Valley The Cheesden Valley runs on a north-south alignment between Bury and Rochdale. Cheesden Brook runs through the valley, joining with Naden Brook to eventually run into the River Roch near Heywood. During the industrial age the valley became a centre of cotton production dependent on running water. The valley is now slowly but surely reclaiming the once busy mills and taking it back to nature. It encompasses Deeply Vale, Bircle Dene and Ashworth Valley. Mining As early as 1580, Queen Elizabeth I granted John Blackwall the right to mine coal in the Cheesden Valley. In addition, it is believed that during the 17th century small communities ‚Äì ‚ÄòFolds' ‚Äì could have had their own mines. Pre-Industrial History There are signs of human activity dating from about 8000 BC. Flints from the Mesolithic period have been found in the Cheesden Valley and Knowl Moor areas. All were discovered on high ground close to a water source, and all are quite small and suitable for use as arrowheads and similar objects.

It caused considerable damage in the cities of Peshawar, Nowshera, and Charsadda. The storm featured heavy rains accompanied by hail and high- speed winds of over 120 kilometers per hour (or 75 miles per hour). As a result of the storm's damaging effects, 45 people were killed and over 200 were wounded. The storm occurred after parts of Pakistan were already partially flooded from prior rainfall in February 2015, up to a meter (or three feet) deep in some places. The storm also collapsed many buildings‚Äô walls and roofs, took down many electricity poles, and killed livestock and damaged many crops in rural Peshawar and Charsadda (including wheat crops and orchards). After the storm, many people remained injured or without drinkable water, food, and shelter. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government organized and sent members of the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PMDA) and the military to aid with rescue and recovery efforts in the areas affected.Satellite imagery at time of event The storm was informally dubbed a ‚Äúmini-cyclone‚Äù in the press. Satellite imagery (see sidebar) and ERAI reanalysis data suggest that it was not a synoptic-scale cyclone but was rather a form of mesoscale convective system, which can create intense winds in the form of a tornado or a derecho. Heavy weather on the subsequent day forced the Pakistani military to cancel two flights to Nepal taking supplies to survivors of the earthquake on the previous day.

Biography Turpin began his career in 1945 at Ealing Studios as a camera assistant to Douglas Slocombe and Stanley Pavey. From 1953, he worked as a camera operator, and worked with Pavey, Gordon Dines, Desmond Dickinson, Otto Heller, Gilbert Taylor, Reginald H. Wyer and Harry Waxman. He made his first film as director of photography, The Queen's Guards (1961) with director Michael Powell. For his first collaboration with Bryan Forbes, Seance on a Wet Afternoon (1964), he received a nomination at the British Academy Film Awards in 1965. For a later film with Forbes, The Whisperers (1967), he received a BAFTA Award for Best Cinematography, and for Oh! What a Lovely War (1969), Richard Attenborough's directorial debut, he received the 1969 BSC Best Cinematography Awardhttp://www.bscine.com/2011/bsc- best-cinematography-award/ and his second BAFTA. On Attenborough's, Young Winston (1972), Turpin used a camera lens mounted device he had developed called ColorFlex which represented an alternative to conventional pre-exposure (flashing) of negative film in the lab. The pre-exposure of the film material means dark areas of the image are brightened. From 1973, Turpin developed his ColorFlex system into a comprehensive system called Lightflex which was used by cameramen such as Oswald Morris (The Wiz, 1978), Freddie Francis (Dune, 1984), Sven Nykvist (Swann in Love, 1984), Adam Greenberg (La Bamba, 1987) and Jost Vacano (Total Recall, 1990). At the 56th Academy Awards in 1984, Turpin received a technical Oscar (Scientific and Engineering Award) for Flex.

It tells the story of the developing relationship between 26-year-old Leo (Hepple) and 40-year-old Judy (Root). The script, by Elliott Kerrigan, was discovered through the Trans Comedy Award, a 2013 BBC talent search for scripts with positive portrayals of transgender characters. Both Root and her character Judy are transgender, making this the first BBC comedy to feature transgender issues prominently, and the first sitcom to star a transgender actor. Sophie Clarke-Jervoise, the executive producer, stated \\"we always knew we had to get a trans actress ‚Äì I don't think we auditioned anyone who wasn't trans for the role. It just didn't feel right.\\" The first series of six episodes aired between 3 September and 8 October 2015. A second and final series began airing from 6 July to 4 August 2016. It comprises six episodes. Episodes  Background and production  In January 2012, All About Trans organized an event, \\"Trans Camp\\", involving people from the trans community and media, and aiming to help the media provide accurate depictions of transgender people. Off the back of this, the BBC ran a talent search later that year, the Trans Comedy Award, offering comedy writers up to ¬£5000 for scripts with positive portrayals of transgender characters. The BBC received 320 script entries, with the winners being Boy Meets Girl (then titled Love) by Elliott Kerrigan and Nobody's Perfect by Tom Glover. Boy Meets Girl was created by Elliott Kerrigan, and written by Kerrigan, Simon Carlyle, and Andrew Mettam. It stars Rebecca Root as Judy, Harry Hepple as Leo, Denise Welch as Pam (Leo's mother). Also appearing are Janine Duvitski, Nigel Betts, Lizzie Roper, and Jonny Dixon. It is directed by Paul Walker. The producer is Margot Gavan Duffy, and the executive producers are Sophie Clarke-Jervoise for Tiger Aspect and Kristian Smith for the BBC. A pilot episode was shown at the BBC's Salford Sitcom Showcase in March 2014, and the show was commissioned after that. The main series acquired co-writers Simon Carlyle and Andrew Mettam, and had six 30-minute episodes (including the pilot episode with some re-shot scenes) set and recorded in Newcastle upon Tyne. The theme tune is \\"Meet Me on the Corner\\" by Lindisfarne.  Reception  After the pilot episode aired, The Independent compared Boy Meets Girl to Gavin & Stacey, an award-winning BBC comedy from 2007‚Äì2010, a comparison the BBC had said they were looking to make. On the topic of having a trans woman character played by a trans woman, Paris Lees wrote in The Guardian \\"About bloody time\\" and \\"It's great to see trans folk bringing authenticity to roles ... [Comedy] is at its best when it helps us to understand a complex and often cruel world by laughing at our own, previously unexamined, prejudices. I haven't seen Boy Meets Girl yet, but it has already put a smile on my face.\\" Jasper Rees in the newspaper The Telegraph was rather less impressed, describing the show as \\"packaged in a demoralisingly traditional form of comedy\\".

It is located at the southern end of Unai Lagua (Parrot Fish Beach), which stretches along the northern shore of the island. The pillbox is fashioned out of poured concrete and coral boulders, and uses natural rock formations as part of its walls. This construction was necessitated by a severe shortage of building materials on the island as the Japanese prepared the island's defenses against the advancing Allied forces in 1943‚Äì44. The use of natural materials and terrain had the added benefit of rendering the position nearly invisible to aerial or offshore observation. The pillbox was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985; it is also a contributing element to the \\"Landing Beaches; Aslito/Isley Field; & Marpi Point, Saipan Island\\", a National Historic Landmark District encompassing surviving World War II military infrastructure on Saipan.

Section 21 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 (NZBoRA 1990) incorporates this right into New Zealand law, stating that: \\"Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, whether of the person, property, or correspondence or otherwise.\\" This right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure is primarily concerned with protecting the privacy interests of individuals against intrusions by the State. The Court of Appeal of New ZealandWilliams v Attorney-General [2007] NZCA 52. and Supreme Court of New ZealandHamed v R [2011] NZSC 101, [2012] 2 NZLR 305, (2011) 25 CRNZ 326. have both recognised that the protection of privacy is core purpose of s21 NZBoRA 1990. Chief Justice Elias described the right protected as \\"the right to be let alone\\"Hamed v R [2011] NZSC 101, [2012] 2 NZLR 305, (2011) 25 CRNZ 326, at [10]. however it currently does not provide a full right to privacy of the kind in Article 17 of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights.Helu v Immigration and Protection Tribunal [2015] NZSC 28, at [118]. Individuals subjected to a search or seizure that is unreasonable they may have a claim for a remedy, generally the exclusion of any evidence obtained by the search or seizure. An analysis of whether an unreasonable search of seizure has occurred under section 21 is a two-step process of asking: # Was there a search or seizure? # Was the search or seizure unreasonable? Unlike other rights protected under the NZBoRA 1990 there are no possible grounds for a reasonable limitation on section 21 under section 5 of the NZBoRA 1990 as if a search or seizure is unreasonable it is contradictory to say it could then be reasonably justified.Hamed v R [2011] NZSC 101, [2012] 2 NZLR 305, (2011) 25 CRNZ 326, at [162]. Search and Surveillance Act 2012 While the NZBORA 1990 establishes the overall right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 provides the statutory framework for the practical application of the law in this area in New Zealand. Searches and seizures that do not comply with the requirements of the Act will be unlawful. The purpose section of the Act states that these requirements \\"recognise the importance of the rights and entitlements affirmed in other enactments including the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990\\".Search and Surveillance Act 2012, s5. The provisions of the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 accommodate the need to protect against unreasonable search and seizure. Therefore, cases involving possible unreasonable searches or seizures will involve significant consideration of whether the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 has been complied with. Unlawfulness vs unreasonableness If a search or seizure is unlawful under the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 then it is also likely to be considered an unreasonable search or seizure. However, the concepts of unlawfulness and unreasonableness are independent and it is therefore possible that, for example, a lawful search can be unreasonable.R v Williams [2007] 3 NZLR 207, (2007) 23 CRNZ 1 (CA). Despite this, the courts have said that in terms of the most common remedy of exclusion of evidence an unlawful search should usually be considered an unreasonable search. Elias CJ went so far as to say that unlawful searches should automatically be unreasonable.Hamed v R [2011] NZSC 101, [2012] 2 NZLR 305,(2011) 25 CRNZ 326, at [50]. An exception is that where the search is only unlawful on minor or technical grounds it may still be reasonable.Hamed v R [2011] NZSC 101, [2012] 2 NZLR 305,(2011) 25 CRNZ 326, at [174]. Search The Search and Surveillance Act 2012 does not provide a definition for the term \\"search\\". While the courts have not formed a single definition, Elias CJ has said that police investigation which invades private space where individuals have an expectation of privacy constitutes a search.Hamed v R [2011] NZSC 101, [2012] 2 NZLR 305,(2011) 25 CRNZ 326, at [10]. McGrath J recognised \\"search\\" has a broad meaning in terms of section 21 of \\"an examination or investigation for the purpose of obtaining evidence\\".Hamed v R [2011] NZSC 101, [2012] 2 NZLR 305,(2011) 25 CRNZ 326, at [164]. It is not settled whether a reasonable expectation of privacy must exist for there to be a search. In many cases there will be little difficulty in deciding that there has been a search as the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 specifically identifies and gives procedure for most common types of search. Common activities that are searches include:Hamed v R [2011] NZSC 101, [2012] 2 NZLR 305,(2011) 25 CRNZ 326, at [165]. * Entry into and inspection of buildings, enclosed spaces or vehicles. * Physical examination of a person. * Taking bodily samples.R v Whimp [2007] NZCA 111. * Internal examination of personal property (for example a bag or wallet). Visual observation An area of difficulty is whether simply visually observing something amounts to a search. If a police officer simply sees something relating to an offence in the course of their normal duty without any conscious effort to find it then there will generally not be a search. However, cases have shown that even where there is some conscious action there may not be a search as requesting an individual hold their hands out to be observedR v Yeung (HC Auckland CRI-2006-092-10945, 22 May 2009). or hold a bicycle up so the serial number could be seenEveritt v Attorney-General [2002] 1 NZLR 82. were both not seen to be searches. Covert surveillance The use of surveillance equipment and whether covert recording amounts to a search has been a significant issue for New Zealand courts. In Tararo v R (2010)[2010] NZSC 157, [2012] 1 NZLR 145, (2010) 25 CRNZ 317. the Supreme Court held that an undercover police officer video recording a drug transaction was not a search due to the low expectation of privacy. Covert surveillance of public areas will generally not be search due to the low expectation of privacy.Lorigan v R [2012] NZCA 264, at [22]. In contrast, surveillance of private property will likely be a search due to the high privacy interests.Hamed v R [2011] NZSC 101, [2012] 2 NZLR 305, (2011) 25 CRNZ 326. The Search and Surveillance Act 2012 now provides clear statutory guidance for when covert police surveillance can lawfully occur.Search and Surveillance Act 2012, Part 3, Subpart 1. Seizure There is no statutory definition of the term \\"seizure\\" in the Search and Surveillance Act 2012. In the Supreme Court Blanchard J defined seizure as simply the removing of something from the possession of someone else.Ngan v R [2007] NZSC 105, [2008] 2 NZLR 48, at [106]. Seizure can involve the taking into custody of personal property including vehicles and clothing. It can also relate to detaining individuals to search or obtain evidence from them. Any seizure must be for a legitimate law enforcement purpose to be reasonable,Attorney-General v P F Sugrue Ltd [2004] 1 NZLR 207, (2003) 7 HRNZ 137. this will generally mean the seizure must be authorised by an empowering statute. Most cases in New Zealand under s21 have focused on unreasonable searches rather than seizures. Search warrants Searches by police and other law enforcement agencies must, in most cases, be carried out under a warrant to be lawful.Dotcom v Attorney-General [2014] NZSC 199, at [71]. In order for a search warrant to be issued there must be:Search and Surveillance Act 2012, s6. * ‚ÄúReasonable grounds to suspect‚Äù the commission of an offence punishable by imprisonment, and * ‚ÄúReasonable grounds to believe‚Äù evidence related to the offence will be found in the search location. What amounts to ‚Äúreasonable grounds‚Äù is not defined in the Search and Surveillance Act 2012, however a search warrant will be invalid only where the application for it was insufficient or it is so defective as to be likely to mislead the affected parties.Search and Surveillance Act 2012, s107. Part 4, subpart 3 of the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 sets out the requirements for lawfully carrying out a search once a warrant has been obtained. A search conducted without a search warrant or outside of the terms of a search warrant is highly likely to be unlawful and unreasonable. Warrantless searches are lawful in certain circumstances under Part 2 of the Search and Surveillance Act 2012. For example, where they are incidental to an arrestSearch and Surveillance Act 2012, s11 and Part 3, Subpart 4 or drug offences.Search and Surveillance Act 2012, Part 2, Subpart 9 Implied license Generally police officers must have statutory authorisation to enter on to private property. Police entry on to property outside of statutory powers may be lawful and reasonable where an implied license exists. An implied license permits an officer to ‚Äúgo to the door of private premises in order to make inquiry of an occupier for any reasonable purpose‚Äù.Tararo v R [2010] NZSC 157, [2012] 1 NZLR 145, (2010) 25 CRNZ 317, at [14] This is significant as a police officer may find evidence of an offence while on the property under the implied license. Finding this evidence will not be an unlawful search as a result of trespass as the officer is lawfully on the property, this was the scenario in Tararo v R (2010)NZSC 157, [2012] 1 NZLR 145, (2010) 25 CRNZ 317. For this reason the scope of implied licenses is strictly limited in New Zealand. The Supreme Court has said an implied license is unlikely to exist if the purpose of the entry was not to make a reasonable inquiry or if it cannot be assumed that the occupier would have consented to the police entering had they known the particular purpose for the entry.Hamed v R [2011] NZSC 101, [2012] 2 NZLR 305, (2011) 25 CRNZ 326. An implied license can extend to allow entry into a private premises in certain circumstances but this will be in the minority of cases and there will generally be no right of access even where, for example, the door to the premises is open.R v Pou [2002] 3 NZLR 637, (2002) 19 CRNZ 563. An implied license can be revoked by the occupier through a clear unequivocal revocation, further, the existence of gates or signs may amount to a physical revocation.R v Ratima (1999) 17 CRNZ 227, (1999) 5 HRNZ 495. Consent to searches A search with no statutory authorisation may be lawful where consent to the search has been given. A search by consent will only be lawful if all of the following are satisfied:Search and Surveillance Act 2012, s94. * The search is for one of the purposes given in s92 of the Search and Surveillance Act 2012, and * The searching officer has advised the person giving consent of the reason for the proposed search and that they may either give or refuse consent,Search and Surveillance Act 2012, s93. and * The person giving consent has legal authority to give that consent. However, even if valid consent to a search has been given it does not automatically make the search reasonable. A lack of entitlement to conduct the search or the manner in which the search is conducted may still make the search unreasonable under s21.Cropp v Judicial Committee [2008] NZSC 46, [2008] 3 NZLR 774, at [18]. Remedies Exclusion of evidence The primary remedy for breaches of the right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure is the exclusion of evidence obtained by the search or seizure. This remedy is provided by s30 of the Evidence Act 2006 where evidence has been \\"improperly obtained\\". Evidence is \\"improperly obtained\\" if it has been obtained in breach of s21 of the NZBoRA 1993 or the various regulations of the Search and Surveillance Act 2012.Evidence Act 2006, s30 (5). S30 requires the judge to conduct a balancing exercise to decide whether the exclusion of the evidence is a proportionate response to the impropriety or breach of s21 committed. If the judge decides exclusion is proportionate to the impropriety then the evidence must be excluded. This means that in some cases even where a search is unreasonable evidence. Retrieved may still be admitted if excluding it would not be proportionate to the breach. The factors that the judge will have regard to in the balancing process are given in s30 (3) of the Evidence Act 2006, these include: * The nature of the breach of s21, in particular, whether it was deliberate, reckless, or done in bad faith. * The nature and quality of the improperly obtained evidence. * The seriousness of the offence with which the defendant is charged. * Whether there were any other investigatory techniques available that would not have breached s21. * Whether there are alternative remedies to exclusion of the evidence which can adequately provide redress to the defendant. * Whether there was any urgency in obtaining the improperly obtained evidence. A useful example of this process in action is Hamed & Ors v R (2011)[2011] NZSC 101, [2012] 2 NZLR 305, (2011) 25 CRNZ 326. where police unlawfully filmed activities on private land and parts of the evidence obtained were ruled admissible while other parts were inadmissible under the balancing process Damages In rare cases damages may also be available for breaches of s21 of the NZBoRA 1993 where the court wishes to highlight its disapproval of a breach of a fundamental right.Forrest v Attorney-General [2012] NZCA 125, [2012] NZAR 798.

Geography Borders of Bant, from the east by Almorada Street, a two-way street extends from north to south, and Alarbeen Street which extends from north to south divided the district into Bant East and Bant West. It is bordered on the south by Alawda street adjacent to the military area, and form the north Abukdok and officers district . Its borders ended at Almutamer Secondary School for boys Corner.  History  Although the district is one of the Urban of the new residential districts, but it was founded in the late 1940s and early 1950s of the past century after the central government distributed plots of land to the population of Almorda district, as compensation for what they had lost as a result of residential land in Architectural planning processes in the Postal area and Almorda Street.  Etymology  There was a lot of stories about the name which was given after: * The story which was closer to the truth that Bant has been created in a beautiful way and houses which in it were built aesthetically, streets well organized, and the first started construction there is Adlan Beah, who built his house during the autumn rainy season and echoed by those who followed him in the construction in the area is a ¬´Alrejal Bant¬ª. * There was another story, which says that the name of the Bant is fully was (Alrejal Bant), and so named because when housing land distributed in the region on which Bant today, was barren nothing ther non wild plants and people were saying, \\"Do not build there only a brave man. \\"In reference to the courage and fearlessness of construction in an empty region non inhabited. Thus called on the place name of Alrejal Bant. * There is a story that says the area was a space to come flocks of hawks and eagles from the dimension, was said to ¬´Sogoor Bant¬ª There is now an area neighborhood in Bant known district of eagles (Sogoor) at the west side of Almorada sports club. Climate Bant features a hot desert climate, with only the months of July and August seeing significant precipitation. Bant averages a little over of precipitation per year. Based on annual mean temperatures, Omdurman is one of the hottest major cities in the world. Temperatures may exceed in mid-summer. Its average annual high temperature is , with six months of the year seeing an average monthly high temperature of at least . Furthermore, none of its monthly average high temperatures falls below . This is something not seen in other major cities with hot desert climates. Temperatures cool off considerably during the night, with Omdurman's lowest average low temperature of the year just above .

Gene  The human TMCO6 is found on chromosome 5 (position 5q31.3). The entire gene spans 5568 base pairs on the positive strand of chromosome 5 (140019113-140024689bp) but is alternately spliced into different variants. There are three known variants for TMCO6. Variant 1 is the longest and variant 2 and 3 are spliced into shorter mRNA strands. There is also a predicted variants X1-X7.  Expression  TMCO6 is expressed in liver tissue and is found during the fetal stage of development in humans.  Homology  Orthologs of the TMCO6 protein have been found among sequenced organisms with the exception of invertebrates, fungi, plants and bacteria. Tmco6 (transmembrane and coiled-coil domains 6) - Rat Genome Database. This includes close primates to some distant fish. Graphs show the evolutionary rate of TMCO6 with respect to different species and compared to other proteins. It is concluded that TMCO6 is a fairly fast evolving protein, similar to fibrinogen. Evolutionary history of TMCO6 is show with respect to different organisms. The evolutionary rate of TMCO6 (blue) is compared to a relatively fast evolving fibrinogen protein (green) and cytochrom c (red) that is relatively slow evolving.  Transcription  There are four known isoforms associated with this gene/protein (1, 2, 3 and X2). The longest variant of TMCO6 is variant 1, encoded by a 12-exon long, 1,925 base pair mRNA sequence. Variant 2 is the second longest at 1,907 base pairs in length and also consists of 12 exons. This transcript variant has an alternate splice site in the central coding region that does not alter the reading frame. Variant 3 has a total length of 1,614 base pairs and differs from variant 1 because it lacks two consecutive exons. It has an alternative splice site in the 5‚Äô region that causes the translation to initiate downstream at an in frame AUG. Variant X2 is predicted using computational analysis and is 1,892 base pairs in length.  Protein  The TMCO6 protein is found in the membrane and is considered a multi-pass membrane protein. There is evidence of its presence in the nucleus, cytosol, ER, mitochondria and the plasma membrane. The predicted molecular weight of Isoform 1 in humans, but is conserved, is 55kDa. Variant 1 is translated into a 499 amino acid sequence isoform. Isoform 2, encoded by transcript variant 2, is 493 amino acids in length and has a predicted molecular weight of 54 kDa. Transcript variant 3 encodes isoform 3 which is the shortest protein because of its spliced N-terminus. Isoform 3 is 253 amino acids in length with a molecular weight of 28kDa.  Domains and motifs  Evidence of two reserved ARM superfamily domains are shown in the TMCO6 protein. The ARM domain, Armadillo/ beta-catenin-like-repeat, is about a 40 amino acid long tandem repeat that forms superhelix of helices. Another feature is that TMCO6 has an Arginine rich region that is within the coil-coiled region. This indicates that the Arg rich area might be an important structural feature of the coiled- coil region. There are 17 regions for protein binding, 2 transmembrane domains and an addition of a poly-A tail to the mRNA. An SRP1 is also found from the 23-399 amino acids. The SRP1 domain is Karyopherin(importin) alpha. This is involved in the exchange of molecules from the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The exchange involves the active transport by a carrier protein called karyopherins. A di-leucine motif is also abundant in TMCO6. This motif is commonly known to be a lysosome targeting motif. A nuclear localization sequence of 5 positive amino acids is found near the 5' end indicating its transport to the nucleus.  Structure  The 5' and 3' end of TMCO6 is predicted to be located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. There is a small portion located in the non-cytoplasmic side.  Function  Function of the conserved ARM domain and SRP1 domains are known. The ARM domains play a role in mediating the interaction of beta-catenin with its ligand. They are responsible for transduction of the Wnt signal, intracellular signaling and cytoskeletal regulation. The SRP1 domain encodes alpha-Karyopherin (importin) and is known for intracellular trafficking and secretion on the membrane. TMCO6 is thought to be involved in the transport of molecules through the nuclear membrane.  Interactions  Two-hybrid experimental evidence suggests UBQLN1, or ubiquilin 1, has a high potential to interact with TMCO6.

Steinhoff deals mainly in furniture and household goods, and operates in Europe, Africa, Asia, the United States, Australia and New Zealand. History Steinhoff was founded in 1964 by Bruno Steinhoff in Westerstede, Germany. Bruno Steinhoff sourced furniture from communist Europe and sold it in Western Europe. In 1997, Steinhoff acquired 35% of South-Africa-based Gommagomma, preparing for a merger the following year. The company moved its headquarters to South Africa in 1998, attracted by the low production costs, and went public on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange that same year. In 2005, Steinhoff invested ¬£86 million to revive the UK's Homestyle Group, thus taking ownership of the company. In 2011, Steinhoff bought Conforama, Europe's second largest retailer of home furnishings, with over 200 stores in France, Spain, Switzerland, Portugal, Luxembourg, Italy and Croatia, spending $1.2 billion for the acquisition. In December 2015, Steinhoff International moved its primary listing to the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, and founded a new Dutch holding company based in Amsterdam. The management remained in South Africa. In 2015, South African low-end retail investment and holding company Pepkor became a member of the Steinhoff International Group for $5.7 billion. In July 2016, UK discount retail chain Poundland accepted Steinhoff's takeover offer of ¬£597 million which was then increased by Steinhoff to ¬£610 million in August 2016. The takeover received shareholder approval in September 2016. In August 2016, Steinhoff announced its plan to purchase the US-based Mattress Firm for $3.8 billion. In October 2018, Mattress Firm filed for bankruptcy but emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy 2 months later after financial restructuring. A$1.9 billion margin loan was provided to Steinhoff by a consortium of lenders, including Japanese bank Nomura and a range of U.S. institutions. Nomura confirmed that it had booked an unrealised loss of 14 billion yen (or $128 million in 2018 dollars). The loan itself had been partly organised by Steinhoff's Chairman, Christo Wiese. In November 2019, UK chains Bensons for Beds and Harveys and upholstery and bedding manufacturer Relyon were sold by Steinhoff to UK-based private equity group Alteri Investors. Controversies On 5 December 2017 the CEO Markus Jooste resigned after the company announced accounting irregularities. The share price immediately plunged 66% and went on to fall by over 90% as it emerged that the company had overstated profits and assets by nearly $12 billion. In December 2017, the Standing Committee on Finance of the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa condemned Steinhoff and called for investigations of the company by regulatory bodies including the Financial Services Board (FSB) and the South African Reserve Bank (SARB). A PricewaterhouseCoopers investigation, requested by Steinhoff, reported in March 2019 that \\"A small group of Steinhoff Group former executives and other non-Steinhoff executives, led by a senior management executive, structured and implemented various transactions over a number of years which had the result of substantially inflating the profit and asset values of the Steinhoff Group over an extended period\\" and went on to state \\"it appears that the Steinhoff Group entered into a number of transactions (some of which were fictitious or irregular) with allegedly independent third party entities which resulted in the inflation of profits and asset values.\\" The report revealed irregular transactions with eight firms not tied to the Steinhoff group from 2009 and 2017 amounted to $7.36 billion. In March 2019 the company share price was still down 96% from its value before the scandal erupted. In September 2019, during a presentation to their investors, the company announced its intentions to sell off non-retail assets and cut jobs at French retail chain Conforma and urgently address its $10 billion debt. Brands As of August 2016, Steinhoff held retailing activities in 30 countries, counting 6,500 retail outlets belonging to 40 different brands, and employing about 90,000 employees. 60% of the company's revenue, and two-thirds of its benefits, are made in Europe. Steinhoff expanded into the United States market on 7 August 2016. Steinhoff's South African brands include Ackermans, Buco, Dunns, Flash, HiFi Corp, Incredible Connection, John Craig, Pennypinchers, Pep, Refinery, Russels, Shoe City, Tekkie Town, Timbercity and Unitrans. Powersales is another African Steinhoff brand. In the UK, Steinhoff owns the high street brands Pep&Co;, Poundland and Sleepmaster. In Ireland, Steinhoff operates Dealz and Pep&Co.; Steinhoff's other European brands include Conforama, Pepco and Poco.

History and ownership  In the early 1960s, Pierre and Guy Sordoillet, Jean Moll and Jacques Ragageot, supported by furniture dealers in the north and a Bordeaux manufacturer, Charles Minvielle, created a \\"Carrefour of furniture\\" by testing a discount formula in the dependencies an old farm in the suburbs of Lyon. In 1967, a first Conforama was opened in Saint-Priest, Rh√¥ne in a 2,500-square-metre industrial building. In 1976, Conforama was acquired by Agache-Willot. In 1981, the financial holding company experienced serious legal difficulties, and in 1991, Conforama was acquired by Pinault SA. Conforama sets up its first commercial website in 1998. In March 2011, Conforama was sold by Kering (formerly Pinault Printemps Redoute) to Steinhoff International, for a consideration of ‚Ç¨1.2 billion. A Conforama store in Wallisellen, Switzerland in April 2012 In March 2016, Darty announced it had agreed to be purchased by Steinhoff for ¬£673 million, through Conforama subsidiary. Fnac returned with a higher offer, resulting in a bidding war between Fnac and Conforama during April 2016. On 26 April, Conforama announced that it has dropped out in the battle for Darty. The Fnac offer was declared unconditional on 19 July 2016, thereby allowing the takeover to be completed. In September 2016, it was reported that Conforama and Casino had forged a supply purchase co-operation agreement. In April 2017, Conforama signed title sponsorship with France's Ligue 1. The deal, reportedly worth ‚Ç¨10 million a season, started in the 2017‚Äì18 season and ended on 2019‚Äì20. The next month, Conforama announced that it would take a 17% stake in the French number two in online clearance retail site Showroompriv√©.fr in the amount of ‚Ç¨157.4 million. On 11 January 2018 this stale was urgently sold off on the orders of Steinhoff, which was suffering from its own accounting scandal. The proceeds of this sale to Carrefour amounted to ‚Ç¨79m, a loss of 50 %. Although the group had a net turnover of ‚Ç¨3.4 billion euros in 2018, in France has accumulated losses since 2013 of close to ‚Ç¨500 million ($564 million), according to its parent. To that end, and to address the challenges in the retail sector, the company announced the departure of Frank Deshayes, General Manager France, on 9 July 2019. A major restructuring plan for 2020 that was announced in July 2019 involved the closure of 32 stores ‚Äì including the chain's flagship store in Pont Neuf ‚Äì and the loss of 1,900 jobs.

The creek was historically affected by streams of surface water and sewage. A number of wetlands are in the creek's vicinity. Course Pancoast Creek begins on Bell Mountain in Dickson City. It flows nearly due south for about a mile and receives an unnamed tributary from the left before turning south-southwest. The creek then turns southeast for several tenths of a mile before reaching its confluence with Price Creek. Hydrology In the early 1900s, Pancoast Creek was clear of culm from its source downstream to its mouth unlike Price Creek, into which it flows. However, Pancoast Creek was discolored by streams of surface water and sewage. The borough of Dickson City once applied for a permit to discharge stormwater into the creek. A mid-20th-century report estimated that the rate of surface water seepage into mine workings at Pancoast Creek was 6.24 gallons per minute per inch of rain. The estimated rate of streambed seepage into mine workings was 3.49 gallons per minute per inch of rain. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Pancoast Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. A mid-20th-century report found that a total of of the watershed of Pancoast Creek was on coal measures.

Located at the junction of Main and Broad Streets, it has been a focal point of Bangor's economy and business since the city's incorporation in 1834. The district includes seven buildings reflective of its appearance in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description and history When Bangor was incorporated in 1834, the junction of Main and Broad Streets, just west of Kenduskeag Stream, was already known as \\"Market Square\\", and was the site of an open-air market. It became known as West Market Square later, to distinguish it from East Market Square, located across Kenduskeag Stream at the junction of Central, Harlow, and Park Streets, which developed later. West Market Square was a central focal point of Bangor's commercial business activity into the 20th century. The east side of the square is lined by six, built between c. 1834 and 1870, with the seventh building in the historic district, the Merrill Trust Company building at 2 Hammond Street, located just off the square to the northeast. It is a Classical Revival structure, designed by New York architect Frank E. Newman and completed in 1907. The six buildings lining the square were all built before 1870, and are reflective of commercial Victorian architectural styles. Three of the buildings are Second Empire in style, including the individually-listed Wheelwright Block, which anchors the square at the northern end. All of these buildings are brick with stone and wood trim elements, and are four stories in height, except the five-story Wheelwright Block. The oldest building, the E.P. Baldwin Building at 10-12 Broad Street, is the oldest building in the district; it was built sometime before 1843, and is Greek Revival in style.

Although his research activity encompassed no more than fifteen years, the themes treated by Sterzi are relevant to neuroanatomy and history of anatomy. Sterzi‚Äôs research on comparative neuroanatomy and embryology were acknowledged by numerous contemporaries (Bardeleben, Chiarugi, Edinger, Eisler, Johnston, Krause, Nicolas, Obersteiner, Sobotta) and many of his discoveries were soon incorporated into anatomy textbooks. Sterzi was awarded several scientific prizes, among which were the ‚ÄòPremio Fossati‚Äô of the Reale Istituto Lombardo di Scienze e di Lettere, Milano in 1909 and the ‚ÄòPrix Lallemand‚Äô of the Acad√©mie des Sciences de l'Institut de France, Paris in 1912. Biography Sterzi was born into a noble family in Cittadella, Italy. His father Paolo, who in his student years in Padova had been involved in the patriotic uprisings against the Austrian government, was an engineer; his mother was Carolina Barolo. In 1893 he matriculated in the University of Pisa where he joined the medical school. The Chairman Professor Guglielmo Romiti asked him to enter the Anatomy department. In 1899 he graduated in Medicine, and few months later was appointed senior lecturer in the Anatomy Department of the University of Padova, then directed by Professor Dante Bertelli. In 1906 he became Professor of Topographical Anatomy on annual contract and in 1910, having been selected by the National Search Committee, he was made full Professor and Chairman of the Anatomy Department of the University of Cagliari. In the summer of 1915, Sterzi volunteered for the Italian Army where he served as medical officer. After the end of World War I, Sterzi, who had the rank of lieutenant colonel and was entitled to be released from the army, chose to remain in his office as director of the military hospital of Arezzo during the postwar Spanish flu epidemic. During the winter of 1919 he contracted a fever and died at the age of 43. He left a wife, and four sons, one of whom later became a doctor and Professor of Dermatology, Guido Sterzi. Scientific career Sterzi wrote the following textbooks: ‚ÄúIl Sistema nervoso centrale dei vertebrati‚Äù (The vertebrate central nervous system), 1907-1912; and ‚ÄúAnatomia del sistema nervoso centrale dell'uomo‚Äù (Anatomy of the human central nervous system), 1914-1915. Following the publication of the first book, John Black Johnston (1908), one of Sterzi's illustrious American contemporaries, wrote in a review published in The Anatomical Record: ‚ÄúSterzi's work promises to be the most extensive work in any language dealing with the central nervous system of vertebrates.‚Äù ‚ÄúMeninges of the Spinal Medulla and of the Brain‚Äù (1899‚Äì1902) is a series of seven articles that represents the progression of his thesis and that includes a monograph on medullary meninges. Sterzi illustrates the comparative anatomy of meninges from the amphioxus to man. Contrary to previous reports the spinal meninges, both in the adult lower vertebrates and in the early developmental stages of the more advanced vertebrates, are very simple. From the mesenchyme surrounding the neural tube only a single leaflet forms the primitive meninx. In the following phylo- and ontogenetic stages, the latter divides into an internal leaflet: the secondary meninx, and into an external one: the dura mater. Finally, in higher vertebrates, even the secondary meninx divides into the arachnoid and the pia. In the same animals, Sterzi demonstrated that, while in the spinal medulla the dura keeps its identity, in the skull it fuses with the periosteum (Sterzi, 1902). He also demonstrated the continuity of all meninges with the envelopes of nerves and with the filum terminale. The second group of studies, ‚ÄúVessels of the Spinal Medulla‚Äù (1900‚Äì1904) and of the Brainstem (1913) started with a communication read by the young Sterzi at the 14th Congress of the German Anatomical Society in 1900. It includes a paper of 370 pages written in German for the journal Anatomische Hefte (Sterzi, 1904), dealing with the comparative anatomy and embryology of these vessels from the cyclostomes (petromyzontes) to man. Sterzi showed that, both in petromyzontes and in the precocious developmental stages of higher vertebrates, the spinal medulla receives its blood from the superficial vessels. It is only in later stages that vessels penetrate the spinal medulla in various patterns. He also demonstrated that, whereas in lower vertebrates there are portions of the spinal medulla supplied by venous blood and others by the arterial one, in later phylo and ontogenetic stages the blood supply becomes uniform for the formation of longitudinal tracts among the primitive metameric systems. In 1913, Sterzi published a study on the development of mammalian central arteries in the spinal medulla, medulla oblongata, and pons (Sterzi, 1913). He observed that these arteries maintain their symmetrical arrangement in the pons, whereas in the lower segments, owing to the formation of the median fissure, they give rise to a single median tract. In ‚ÄúHypophysis‚Äù (1904), Sterzi studied the hypophysis of petromyzontes and, at variance with previous findings, demonstrated that no infundibular gland exists in these cyclostomes (Sterzi, 1904). He also investigated the comparative anatomy of this organ in all vertebrates. In ‚ÄúThe Regio Parietalis (of Diencephalon) in Lower Craniates‚Äù (1905), Sterzi demonstrates that there are organs which are single (epiphysis and paraphysis) and organs that are originally double (pineal and parapineal organs; Sterzi, 1905). The latter, however, in adult petromyzontes become both asymmetrical acquiring a median location below the cranial vault, which is fissured in their correspondence. They have the structure of a sort of eyes (parietal eyes). ‚ÄúGeneral Neuroanatomy‚Äù (1912‚Äì1914) is a series of articles on the development of the longitudinal cerebral fissure (Sterzi, 1912) and that on the significance of the human encephalon and telencephalon (Sterzi, 1914). Concerning the first topic, Sterzi demonstrates that, contrary to earlier reports, the longitudinal fissure is not due to pressure exerted by the falx cerebri but that it is the product of the rapid outgrowth of the cerebral hemispheres from the lateral portions of the telencephalic vesicle. He also maintains that the third ventricle consists, not only of the posterior diencephalic portion, but of a smaller anterior one of telencephalic origin. In the second article (Sterzi, 1914), Sterzi criticizes the concept put forward by Edinger(1911) that the human brain consists of a neoencephalic portion: the cerebral cortex, and of a paleoencephalic one: the remaining encephalon. He demonstrates that even in the portion that Edinger considers paleoencephalon there are neoencephalic derivatives. Concerning whether all portions of the brain really evolve from lower craniates to man, he demonstrates that this is not the case because, in the course of phylogenesis, some parts evolve and others regress. The article ‚ÄúAnatomy and Embryology of the Endolymphatic Sac‚Äù (1909) is devoted to the anatomy and embryology of the endolymphatic sac. In humans the sac is included into the endocranium, while in lower vertebrates it is located in between the dura and the endocranium. It is absent in selachians and teleosteans while its presence is doubtful in petromyzontes. In the work ‚ÄúAnatomy of Subcutaneous Tissue‚Äù (1910), the subcutaneous tissue is carefully studied in its general characteristics: development, chronology, gender, and nutritional conditions (Sterzi, 1910). In addition it is described in the various regions of the human body. The subcutaneous tissue is divided into two layers: superficial and deep, that in the head, neck, trunk, and proximal limbs are separated from each other by an intermediate layer homologous to the muscular one found in other mammals. This intermediate layer in man gives rise to the cutaneous muscles of the head and neck and to the subcutaneous and superficial parts of the external anal sphincter. In the other regions it constitutes the superficial fascia, which is lacking in distal limbs. Medical historian By searching in the archives of the University of Padova, Sterzi came to know that Fabricius ab Aquapendente had willed to the government of the Republic of Venice the famous Tabulae Anatomicae that had been considered lost for 200 years. He found them, together with three other works of Fabricius, in the Marciana Library in Venezia. Of the 300 tables mentioned by Fabricius, there were only 167, bound into eight volumes (seven devoted to human and one to comparative anatomy). Besides being the most important anatomical work of the 16th and 17th centuries, the Tabulae Pictae, which are in folio, represent the first coloured (hand-painted) anatomical atlas in history. In ‚ÄúThe Tabulae Anatomicae (Pictae) by Fabricius ab Aquapendente‚Äù (1909) Sterzi could ascertain that Fabricius incorporated into these drawings findings obtained by his former dissectors Giulio Casseri and Giulio Cesare Sala. In the monograph ‚ÄúGiulio Casseri (Casserius; 1552‚Äì1616) Anatomist and Surgeon‚Äù (1910), Sterzi gives a report of the biography and achievements of this anatomist, and of the teaching of Anatomy in the Padua Medical School. The works of Casserius (De Vocis Auditusque Organis, Pentaestheseion, Tabulae Anatomicae), who started as house servant of Fabricius and then became dissector and eventually the first Professor of Surgery in Padova, is described and documented in detail, as well as the long quarrel that later developed between him and his former master, Fabricius. Sterzi published in 1910 an article about the period of lectorship in Padua of the Polish physician Joseph Struthius (1510‚Äì1568). \\"I Progressi della Nevrologia\\" (1910), is a concise history of neuroscience based on a direct reading of classic works. Among the theories reported by Sterzi is that of Plato, who stated that man has three souls with different functions, an idea that resonates with the modern concept of the triune brain (MacLean, 1970). He also reported the progresses of neuroscience from the Renaissance to the 19th century. He stressed the importance of the anatomical and embryological comparative approach started by Willis and later revived by Cuvier and His. Later that year, Sterzi wrote another article, where he demonstrated that Botallus, and not Carcano (as Scarpa believed), had been the first discoverer of the foramen ovale.

The primary sequence found at NCBI and Aceview on NCBI predicts there are five spliceforms, with four closely resembling one another and the fifth missing a large 5' intron region. Softberry reinforces the Aceview data by predicting five exons, which are seen in four of the five spliceforms of Aceview. The general structure of the TMEM249 transcript has a large 5' UTR followed by exon 1, then a large intron followed by exon 2, a small intron then exon 3. The rest of the protein follows exon 3 with a large intron, exon 4 a small intron then exon 5, the 3' UTR. The primary transcript contains all five exons and produces a protein that is 235 Amino Acids long. Transcript 1 and 2 are translated in the 3' to 5' direction while transcripts 3 through 5 are translated in the 5' to 3' direction. Note that the gene is encoded on the minus strand within the chromosome.  Paralogs  20 of TMEM249's orthologs graphed by sequence similarity and date of divergence (MYA).The only known paralog of human TMEM249 is found in the second isoform of the protein in Gorillas. Of the 217 amino acids aligned between gorilla and human TMEM249, 96% are in complete consensus and 99% are conserved.  Orthologs  TMEM249 orthologs includes all groups of life except birds, fungi, archea, protists, and plants. The most distant ortholog, Rozella allomycis, was the most diverged species that qualified as an ortholog. The last shared ancestor between Rozella allomycis and Homo sapiens is the Opisthokonts.  Homologs  No homologs or homologous domains exist within TMEM249.  Phylogeny  No fungi orthologs were found in the search for similar sequences, so it could be assumed that the gene may have arisen in Opisthokonts and proliferated down the animal tree. This would mean the protein diverged too late to evolve through the fungi tree. This would explain why there are no found plant orthologs as the gene would have arose after animals and plants diverged evolutionarily.  Domains and motifs  Predicted transmembrane domains of human TMEM249.There are three predicted transmembrane domains. It is unknown whether these transmembrane domains affect the larger structure of the protein complex once properly expressed in tissue. Evolutionary analysis showed that these transmembrane domains are highly conserved across all ortholog taxa.  Post-translational modifications  TMEM249 predicted serine phosphorylations at the C-terminus of the protein. There is an area near the 3‚Äô end of the protein that is predicted to be heavily serine phosphorylated. This end of the protein is likely on the cytosolic half of the protein and serves in some activation function of a pathway.  Secondary structure  Conceptual translation showing the predicted secondary structure of human TMEM249 isoform 1.TMEM249 has a highly varied structure. Prediction data supports alternating regions of beta sheets and alpha helices. These predictions may support a beta barrel or \\"helix barrel\\" through the membrane made up of multiple protein monomers of TMEM249.  Promoter  The TMEM249 promoter region annotated for predicted transcription factor binding sites.The promoter region was found using Eldorado from Genomatix.de (source), the region occupies a region upstream of the 5‚Äô region of TMEM249 on the minus strand of chromosome 8. This promoter binds a number of transcription factors as determined by Eldorado at Genomatix.de.  Tissue Expression  The GEO profile taken from NCBI showing a wide variety of tissues that TMEM249 is present in. TMEM249 expression is present at a high level in a wide variety of human tissues. GEO tissue profiles for this protein show that this protein is present in a wide variety of locations within the human body. The human protein atlas claims an even wider expression scope for this protein(source).  Interacting Proteins  There were no known protein interactions for TMEM249.  Clinical Significance  TMEM249 has no known link to medical disease.  Mutations  Single nucleotide polymorphisms of TMEM249 as collected by the SNP database on NCBI. There exist a number of SNPs for TMEM249 in humans. The mutations are scattered for the most part, with the largest changes in amino acids occurring in the domain of unknown function.

The lock employed the first known high-security design. History After attending some lectures on technical aspects of locks, Bramah designed a lock of his own, receiving a patent for it in 1784. In the same year he started the Bramah Locks company at 124 Piccadilly, London. The locks produced by his company were famed for their resistance to lock picking and tampering, and the company famously had a \\"challenge lock\\" displayed in the window of their London shop from 1790, mounted on a board containing the inscription: The Great Exhibition 1851 The challenge stood for over 67 years until, at the Great Exhibition of 1851, the American locksmith Alfred Charles Hobbs was able to open the lock and, following some argument about the circumstances under which he had opened it, was awarded the prize. Hobbs' attempt required about 51 hours, spread over 16 days. The Challenge Lock is in the Science Museum in London. An examination of the lock shows that it has been rebuilt since Hobbs picked it. Originally it had 18 iron slides and 1 central spring; it now has 13 steel slides, each with its own spring. Bramah received a second patent for a lock design in 1798.Skempton (2002), p.70 Design The Bramah lock used a cylindrical key and keyhole. The end of the key had a number of different slots of varying depths, which, when inserted into the lock, would press a number of wafers to a specified depth and enable the key to turn and open the lock. It shares some similarities to a modern tubular pin tumbler lock, but used fixed wafers instead of two-part pins. The original Bramah lock had 18 different wafers, which allowed for 470 million possible permutations. The lock's innovative design presented a unique engineering challenge to create tools capable of making the different parts involved. Bramah worked extensively with an engineer named Henry Maudslay to create a number of different machine tools for working with the cylindrical key and lock. Today The Bramah company is currently based in Fitzrovia, London and Romford, Essex. Though no longer thought to be completely unpickable, the venerable design is still sold as a very secure lock.

This genus of bacteria lacks a cell wall around their cell membrane. Without a cell wall, pathogenic species in this genus are unaffected by many antibiotics such as penicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics that target cell wall synthesis. Mycoplasma are the smallest bacterial cells yet discovered, can survive without oxygen and are typically about 0.1 Œºm in diameter. The etymology of the name of the species comes from the Latiny: L. part. adj. spumans, foaming, presumably alluding to thick dark markings that suggest the presence of globules inside the coarsely reticulated colonies. The type strain is ATCC 19526 = IFO (now NBRC) 14849 = NCTC 10169. Its genome has been determined. It is associated with respiratory infections in dogs. M. spumans is Gram-negative and appears round or coccobacillary in form. Individual cells vary in diameter from 300 to 600 nm, and each is surrounded by a three-layered cytoplasmic membrane. The cell has a 'fried-egg' resemblance on a variety of growth media. It is anaerobic.

At various times a meeting place for intellectuals and revolutionaries, the caf√© witnessed many historically significant events over the 20th century. It is said to be where King Farouk saw his second wife, Nariman Sadek; where the perpetrator of the 1919 failed assassination attempt on Egypt's last Coptic Prime Minister, Youssef Wahba Pacha lay in wait for his target; and where several members of the resistance during the 1919 revolution met the basement to organize their activities and print their flyers. Patrons included the political novelist Naguib Mahfouz and the then-future president Gamal Abdel Nasser. History The caf√© has its origins in 1908, but was not named Caf√© Riche until it was bought in 1914 by Frenchman Henry Recine. Shortly after acquiring the caf√© however, Recine sold it to Michael Nicoapolits from Greece and returned to France. Nicoapolits added theater to the caf√©, bringing in such performers as Monira il-Mahdiyya and Umm Kulthum. On November 4, 1942, Nicoapolits sold the caf√© to George Basile Avayianos, who focused his efforts on adding a restaurant onto the caf√©. In 1962 Avayianos gave the caf√© to Abdel Malak Mikhail Salib, who became the first native Egyptian to own the caf√©. This change in ownership marked a change in the country too, as Egyptians were starting to take back their country's economic identity from the prominent foreigners who previously controlled many successful businesses. Notable events Cairo: Caf√© Riche Those who frequented the caf√© were mostly of higher socio-economic status. Up until World War II, most of the customers were foreigners living in the country. As ownership changed to native Egyptians, so did the clientele. Cairo became the home to many newspapers, magazines, and law offices helped build up the client base of the caf√©. Its proximity to then-Pasha Square (present Talaat Harb Square) and Tahrir Square made the caf√© a prime location for gatherings. Revolutionaries would meet at the caf√© to plan strategies during the 1919 revolution against the British rule of Egypt. The caf√© was the site of an assassination attempt on the Egyptian Prime Minister on December 19, 1919. Gamal Abdel Nasser was known to frequent the caf√© while planning his 1952 overthrow of King Farouk. Naguib Mahfouz was one of the most famous intellectuals to frequent the caf√©, so much that Malak would close the caf√© on Fridays to give Mahfouz a place to hold meetings. The political novelist even mentions the caf√© is several of his books and received inspiration for characters from his fellow customers. Present day Caf√© Riche was closed for almost a decade in the 1990s. A court case by the Egyptian government was brought against the caf√© about a public passage the caf√© occupied, causing a temporary close. The earthquake of October 1992 caused considerable damage and the caf√© struggled to rebuild. The decline in popularity of the caf√© has been credited to the rise of digital media. Formal meeting places like caf√©s have taken a backseat to online platforms and groups. Caf√© Riche was a hub for large literary and intellectual groups to meet, but also youth in general. With the emergence of large shopping malls, small businesses are no longer the major gathering place for the younger generation, as it once was. Yet, during the 2011 revolution it served as a refuge to the many protesters in the city.

Starring Herbert Lom and Sally Smith, it ran for two series, which were first transmitted during 1963 and 1965. Outline The majority of the episodes (26 x 50mins) each focused on one patient, whose psychological ailment Dr Corder would treat using a humane yet idiosyncratic approach that mixed Freudian psychoanalysis with the contemporary methods associated with the then-fashionable theories of R. D. Laing. Several psychiatric techniques, such as word association, group work, role-play and hypnotherapy, were featured in the series. Because of the demands of the 50-minute television episode, it was often suggested that Corder would continue to see his patient after the denouement. Frequently, Corder's initial patient in a story would turn out not to be the character with the pressing mental health issue.

Gene Evolution of the C12orf40 gene (and its more conserved sub-region of the first 4 exons) across several taxa. Information available from NCBI BLAST software. Human gene In humans, the gene for C12orf40 is located on chromosome 12. There are 13 exons in the highest quality isoform,UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Basic Local Alignment Tool forming an mRNA of 2797 base pairs.NCBI Nucleotide Three other isoforms have been isolated. Evolution Homologs exist as distant as the green sea turtle and chickens at approximately 60% sequence identity, suggesting that the gene may have arisen in the amniotes after their divergence from other tetrapods;NCBI Basic Local Alignment Search Tool the first 4 exons are conserved with 36% identity as distantly as the anemone. Protein  Properties The human C12orf40 protein is 652 amino acids in length.NCBI Protein Its molecular weight is predicted to be 74.52 kDa,Stothard, P. Protein Molecular Weight and its isoelectric point 7.822.Toldo, L. EMBL WWW Gateway to Isoelectric Point Service Amino acids 229-652 contain a domain of unknown function (DUF4552) which is conserved in vertebrates. C12orf40 is predicted to be a soluble protein with no transmembrane segments. Its secondary and tertiary structures are not currently known. Interactions Experimental evidence shows that C12orf40 has a physical interaction with dynein light chain 2 (DYNLL2). This protein is part of a complex that regulates the function of the motor protein dynein. Expression Within the cell, C12orf40 is predicted to be present in the nucleus based on signals within its sequence.Kenta Nakai, Human Genome Center, Institute for Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Japan. An analysis of normal human tissues shows that C12orf40 expression occurs primarily in the testis, suggesting importance to the male reproductive system. Clinical significance The function of C12orf40 is not yet well understood. However, the three prime untranslated region (3' UTR) of C12orf40 is highly similar to the 3' UTR of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which may mean that the two genes share certain expression patterns. In the fibroblasts of hypertrophic scars, exposure to the immunosuppressant Tacrolimus causes C12orf40 up-regulation. In pigs, a region homologous to human C12orf40 plays a role in arthrogryposis, a disease characterized by congenital fibrosis. The common thread of these studies suggests that C12orf40 may have a connection to the formation of healthy connective tissue.

It is a rhizomatous perennial, from Central Europe, found in Hungary, Austria, Romania, Czech Republic and Ukraine. It has grass-like leaves, a short stem and pale yellow flowers. It has had a mixed origin and was once Iris humilis subsp. arenaria, a subspecies of Iris humilis (another Psammiris iris), until it was reclassified as a separate species. But many sources still state that it is either a synonym or subspecies of Iris humilis. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. Description It is similar in form to Iris pumila, but differs by being smaller in all parts.Sydenham Teast Edwards and John Lindley It has a long, thin rhizome, which is about 2‚Äì5 mm thick. Which has many thickened branched nobes. These creeping branched rhizomes make clumps of plants. The rhizome has the remains of last seasons leaves. It has long, thin and flat leaves, that are long and 1.5-10mm wide.Thomas Gaskell Tutin (Editor) It has an erect, simple, unbranched and green stem, that grows up to between tall. The stems have 1‚Äì2 spathes (leaves of the flower bud), which are green, lanceolate and (scarious) membranous. They are 2‚Äì3.5 cm wide. They have short, 6mm long pedicels (flower stalk). The stems hold between 1 and 2 flowers,Elizabeth Lawrence, Nancy Sanders Goodwin and Allen Lacy in spring, between April and May. The flowers have a very short flowering period, that only last one day, it opens in the morning and then closes in the afternoon. The fragrant flowers, are vanilla scented, and come in shades of yellow, between light yellow, and pale yellow, to bright yellow. It has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The falls are sub- orbicular, and long, and 1.3 cm wide. They have purple veins, and an orange, or deep yellow beard. The standards are narrow, oblanceolate, with a short claw (section closest to the stem). They are long, with darker veins. It has a perianth tube that is hypanthial (cup shaped) or infundibuliform (funnel shaped) and 5-12mm, and 3 cornered oblong ovary. After the iris has flowered, in July‚ÄìSeptember, it produces an oblong or fusiform (spindle shaped) seed capsule. The capsules dehisce (split open), laterally (similar to Iris korolkowii). Inside the capsules, are brown, ovoid, globose or pyriform seeds. which have a circular aril. Biochemistry As most iries are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has a chromosome count: 2n=22, (Dobe≈° et al.) in 1997.  Taxonomy It is commonly known as sand iris, or sandy iris or rock sand iris (of Iris humilis subsp. arenaria), or 'Hungarian Sand Flag'. The Latin specific epithet arenaria refers to sand, hence growing in sandy places. It was first published and described by Franz de Paula Adam von Waldstein and P√°l Kitaibel in 'Descriptiones et Icones Plantarum Rariorum Hungariae' (Descr. Icon. Pl. Hung.) Vol.1 table57, between (1799 and 1802). In 1961, √Å. L√∂ve & D. L√∂ve reclassified it as Iris humilis subsp. arenaria in 'Bot. Not.' Vol. 114 page 51. In 2013, Barker & Govaerts created the \\"World check-list of selected plant families\\" from the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, which lists Iris arenaria (Waldstein & Kitaibel in 1802) and Iris humilis (Georgi, 1775) as two separate species. It is also listed in 'Atlas of Seeds and Fruits of Central and East-European Flora: The Carpathian Mountains Region' as Iris arenaria.V√≠t Boj≈àansk√Ω and Ag√°ta Farga≈°ov√° It has not been verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service as of 28 April 2015. As of 29 April 2015, Iris arenaria is still described as a synonym of Iris humilis by the RHS. Distribution and habitat Iris arenaria in Austria Iris arenaria is native to central and eastern Europe. Range It is found in Hungary, (including Kiskuns√°g,) Austria, Romania, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Ukraine. It is commonly found on Pannonian steppe, (within Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Serbia and Slovakia). Habitat It grows on the sunny rock steppes, and on stony slopes, from lowlands to highlands. In Ukraine, it is found in the (pine) forest steppes beside Seversky Donets (river), on the sandy riversides and in sand dunes. In the Czech Republic, it is found in the sand dunes of ƒåenkov (within a national nature reserve). It is also in the dunes of Romania. It likes shallow and sandy soils. Conservation It is listed in Annex II of the FFH Directive (Flora, Fauna, Habitat) of the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC, with Adenophora lilifolia, Aldrovanda vesiculosa, Angelica palustris, Cirsium brachycephalum , Iris aphylla subsp. hungarica and Pulsatilla pratensis ssp. hungarica. Iris arenaria is listed as 'endangered species'. In Ukraine, it is listed as 'vulnerable'. In Romania, it is listed as 'rare'. In Czech Republic, it is listed as endangered as well. It is threatened by extensive grazing of sheep and goats, also sand extraction and urban development. It is protected in Czech Republic,(7 of 8 populations are located with reserves), Slovakia, Hungary and Serbia. Within Hungary, it is thought to be a 'Plant Species Of Community Importance', with 'Sand saffron' (Colchicum arenarium). Cultivation Iris arenaria in Czech Republic It is hardy plant, more hardy than Iris humilis. It may need to be sheltered in the winter. It prefers to grow in sandy, well drained soils, with lime. It likes positions in full sun. It can be grown as rock garden or alpine plant. It is rarely grown in the UK. Propagation It can be propagated by division or by seed growing. To grow new plants by seed, the seed capsule should be removed from the stem, before it is ripe. Then it should be left to dry for a few days, before removing the seed (from the capsule) and sowing in trays or pots. The seedlings need to grow for a year or two, before maturing enough for the plants to flower.

TERRA is RNA that is transcribed from telomeres -- the repeating 6-nucleotide sequences that cap the ends of chromosomes. TERRA functions with shelterin to inhibit telomere lengthening by enzyme telomerase. TERRAs are essential for telomere length and maintenance. At least four factors contribute to telomere maintenance: telomerase, shelterin, TERRA and the CST Complex. TERRA can also regulate telomere length by increasing euchromatin formation. On the other hand, nonsense-mediated decay factor enrichment at telomeres may exist to prevent TERRA inhibition of telomerase. TERRA levels vary during the cell cycle, decreasing during S phase, and increasing in the transition from G2 phase to G1 phase.

Life The son of Thomas Charles Bigge, he was born, according to his own Memoir, in 1776. He was baptised on 2 October 1784.

Geography The island is around 300 acres (1.2 square kilometres) in area. It lies off the Donegal coast near Kincasslagh. The island's highest hill, Moylemore, is at 102 m. The buildings of the island are located on its southern part, being the northern one rocky and exposed to winds. On Owey there is no mains electricity or public water supply. Demographics The table reports data taken from Discover the Islands of Ireland (Alex Ritsema, Collins Press, 1999) and the Census of Ireland. Owey Island was full-time inhabited up to the mid 1970s. Later on it only had part-time residents, mainly at summer. Most of them own old cottages inherited by ancestors who used to permanently live in the island. History Abandoned schoolhouse; the new house at the right appears to be in use seasonally Overall view from the neighbouring Cruit Island Plenty of fish in the waters surrounding the island and the land that, fertilized with seaweed, was suitable for growing vegetables, allowed a simple lifestyle to more than 100 people. Turf was used to heat the homes; some of the islanders used it also to heat the equipment to produce single malt and liquors. In the olden days Owey had a post office and a school, which closed in 1971; its remains are still there. It had just one teacher in charge of the primary education of all ages, while for their secondary education children had to be sent to the mainland.

The amendment envisages the dilution of many powers of Executive Presidency, which had been in force since 1978. It is the most revolutionary reform ever applied to the Constitution of Sri Lanka since JR Jayawardhane became the first Executive President of Sri Lanka in 1978. Introduction The amendment was a result of promise made by President Maithripala Sirisena leading up to the 2015 Presidential Election. The main prospect of the amendment was to repealing the 18th Amendment which gave the President extreme powers and to reinforce democracy in the country. It establishes a Constitutional Council (Sri Lanka) which will exercise some executive powers previously held by the President. The 19th amendment restores many components of the 17th amendment letting the Constitutional Council to set up the proposed Independent Commissions; Drafting process In early May 2013 the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government had started drafting a constitutional amendment to reduce the terms of office of the President and the Chief Justice to five years each, instead of Six years for the President and unlimited term, to age 65, for the Chief Justice. According to the proposed amendment, there would be no limit, however, on how often a President could be re-elected. That drafted amendment had addressed National issues of power devolution and proposed to repeal land and Police powers vested with the Provincial Councils. And by May 2013 then opposition political groups, diplomats and civil organizations like the People's Liberation Front or JVP, Jathika Hela Urumaya, Athuraliye Rathana Thero of Pivithuru Hetak National Movement, and Maduluwawe Sobitha Thero had proposed to change the Constitution back to a Westminster style Parliamentary system for the country to address various issues, especially the issues arisen by the 18th Amendment. The UNP had appointed a committee chaired by the Member of Parliament and former Bar Association President Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe to draft the constitution. The party also proposed as a novel system the Executive powers of the President to be exercised on political basis and to be subject to checks and balances. The proposals guaranteed the freedom of expression and the right to information. The UNP also proposed that the system of preference votes be abolished and the tenure of the Parliament and the Provincial Council fixed at five years. The Key-elements of the proposed Constitution were; # Restoration of the People‚Äôs Sovereignty # Legislature # Executive # Devolution of Powers # Judiciary # Good Governance # Participatory Democracy History Queen Elizabeth II, Head of state of Ceylon Under the Soulbury Constitution which consisted of The Ceylon Independence Act, 1947 and The Ceylon (Constitution and Independence) Orders in Council 1947, Sri Lanka was then known as Ceylon. The Soulbury Constitution provided a parliamentary form of Government for Ceylon and for a Judicial Service Commission and a Public Service Commission. Minority rights were safeguarded by Article 29(2) of the Constitution. The Governor-General (The Viceregal Representative of the Queen of Ceylon, also Queen of the United Kingdom, as well as the other Commonwealth Realms, and therefore usually resident in London), the Senate and the House of Representatives exercised legislative power. The House of Representatives consisted of 101 Members, of which 95 were elected by universal suffrage and 6 were nominated by the Governor-General. That total number was increased to 151 by the 1959 Delimitation Commission and the term of the House was 5 years The S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike Government set up a Joint Select Committee of the Senate and the House of Representatives to consider a revision of the Constitution on 10 January 1958 but the Committee was unable to come to a final conclusion on account of the propagation of Parliament on 23 May 1959. A similar attempt by the Dudley Senanayake Government was failed due to such a propagation on 22 June 1968 too. The Senate consisted of 30 Members (elected 15 by the House and 15 by the Governor -General) was abolished on 2 October 1971.

The Republican Constitution 1972 - Ceylon became Sri Lanka. Sirimavo Bandaranaike came to office for the second time as Prime Minister in May 1970. Her United Front Government used the parliament as a Constituent Assembly and drafted a new Republican Constitution. It was promulgated on 22 May 1972. This Constitution provided for a unicameral legislature named the National State Assembly with a term of office of 6 years and Sovereignty was entirely vested in it. A nominal President with a term of office of 4 years was appointed as the Head of State by the Prime Minister, Head of the Cabinet of Miniaters responsible to the National State assembly. Ceylon was replaced by republic of Sri Lanka (Resplendent Island). this constitution contained a declaration of fundamental rights and freedom was amended on 11 February 1 975 to change the basis of delimitation of constituencies from 75,000 persons per electorate to 90,000 persons. J. R. Jayewardene who came to office in July 1977 with a five-sixths majority passed the second amendment to the 1972 Constitution on 4 October 1977 and then Prime Minister Jayawardene became the first Executive President of Sri Lanka on 4 February 1978. 19th Amendment & the Supreme Court The Supreme Court of Sri Lanka concluded on 6 April 2015 considering petitions filed in connection with the 19th Constitutional Amendment. The respective verdict was submitted to the President as well as the Speaker of Parliament. The 19th Constitutional Amendment Draft Bill was presented to Parliament by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on 24 March. Later 19 petitions were filed with regard to the new amendment. Five of them were filed for the amendment while 14 petitions were filed against it. A panel of Supreme Court Judges led by Chief Justice K. Sri Pavan started to consider the petitions on 4 March 2015. The other Supreme Court judges who sat on the panel were Chandra Ekanayake and Priyasad Depp. While presenting his submissions, the Attorney General told the court that the 19th Amendment could be passed with a two-thirds majority in Parliament without calling for a referendum. At that point, the Chief Justice pointed out that in the 19th Amendment the President is depicted as the symbol of national unity. Therefore, the Chief Justice stressed as the national flag is currently depicted as the symbol of national unity, replacing such a position with the President is disputable. The Chief Justice further questioned whether it curtailed the power of the President after the Prime Minister was named as the head of the Cabinet. Thereafter the Attorney General informed the Supreme Court that he would forward further submissions in writing to that regard. The Bill to this effect was presented to Parliament on 24 March. A special political party leaders meeting in connection with the proposed debate was presided over by the Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa at the Parliament complex on 6 April 2015.Former President Maithripala Sirisena Addressing political party leaders, Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa said that he would inform all political leaders whether the debate would be held on the following Wednesday and Thursday only after he received the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision with regard to the debate. Meanwhile, MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena said during the political party leaders‚Äô meeting that the Attorney General had submitted a 12-paged amendment to the Supreme Court. He also said that the amendment submitted by the Attorney General was contradictory to that of the 19th Amendment presented to Parliament recently by the Prime Minister. He had then pointed out that they should be provided with an opportunity to express their views in Parliament. Former Minister G. L. Peiris had also presented details in this regard and Opposition Leader Nimal Siripala de Silva, former ministers Prof.Tissa Vitharana, D. E. W. Gunasekera and W.D.J. Seneviratne had also supported Professor Peries‚Äô reasoning. However, Chief Government Whip and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said participants of the political party leaders‚Äô meeting agreed to pass the 19th Amendment after it is debated on 9 and 10 April. Challenges and legal validity. Since the 19th Constitutional Amendment Draft Bill was presented to Parliament by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on 24 March 2015, 19 petitions were filed with regard to the new amendment. Five of them were filed for the amendment while 14 petitions were filed against it. On 9 April 2015, the petitions were considered and the amendment was reviewed by a panel of Supreme Court Judges led by Chief Justice K. Sri Pavan and determined that it was consistent with the Constitution. While presenting his submissions, the Attorney General told the court that the 19th Amendment could be passed with a two-thirds majority in Parliament without calling for a referendum. The three-judge bench ruled that the Proposed Bill complied with the provisions of Article 82(1) of the Constitution but required to be passed by a special majority of the parliament as specified in Article 82 (5) of the Constitution and certain sections required to be approved by the people of the country at a general referendum. The Sri Lankan government had to change the bill several times in a bid to get the backing of parliamentary opposition parties and amended the relevant clauses and removed the sections that need a referendum before presenting it to parliament.

In 1996, he co-founded the online mortgage lender E-Loan, and during his tenure as CEO E-Loan became the first company to freely provide consumers' FICO credit scores. By 2000, E-Loan's market value was estimated at $1 billion, and Larsen left the company when it was sold to Banco Popular in 2005. In 2006, he co-founded Prosper Marketplace and he served as CEO until 2012. Later in 2012, he co-founded the company Ripple Labs, Inc., which developed Ripple, software that enables the instant and direct transfer of money between two parties. Self-described as \\"radically pro-consumer,\\" Larsen has been a vocal advocate of financial privacy in California, and in 2001 he co-founded the coalition Californians for Privacy Now. He has appeared as a speaker at industry events such as Sibos, SWIFT's flagship conference, and written articles for publications such as American Banker. He is also a board-member or advisor for organizations such as Credit Karma, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), Qifang, and Betable. On January 4, 2018, Forbes estimated Larsen's worth at $59 billion, briefly putting him ahead of Mark Zuckerberg and into fifth place in their list of world's richest people. Larsen and Ripple together donated US$1 million each to five local SF food banks for Covid-19 relief efforts. Early life and education Chris Larsen was born in San Francisco, California in 1960. His mother worked as a freelance illustrator, while his father worked as an aircraft mechanic for United Airlines at San Francisco International Airport. After high school, Larsen attended San Francisco State University, where he earned a B.S. in international business and accounting in 1984. He began working for Chevron after college, doing financial audits in Brazil, Ecuador, and Indonesia. He graduated with an M.B.A. from the Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1991. Business career Development of E-Loan (1992-1998) In the early 1990s, Larsen began working at a mortgage lender in Palo Alto, California. Becoming friends with his colleague Janina Pawlowski, they quit their jobs together in 1992 to found a mortgage business, By 1996, they had switched their focus from loans to the development of a mortgage lending website. Both Larsen and Pawlowski had been frustrated with aspects of the mortgage lending industry, and saw the internet as a way to circumvent agent commissions and other fees. Initially raising $450,000 in funding from friends and family, Larsen and Pawlowski moved from their small Palo Alto office to a larger \\"low-rent site\\" in nearby Dublin to work on the project. The E-Loan website became accessible to the public in 1997, and having success as one of the first online mortgage lenders in the United States. The website allows borrowers to search and shop for loans directly, without the fees charged by brokers and sales agents. The website would later begin offering direct home equity and car loans as well. By 1998, E-Loan was running into difficulty funding their operations. Pawlowski had served as chief executive officer for the first two years, and in 1998 she offered to switch jobs with Larsen, taking Larsen's previous role of President. E-Loan funding and public offering (1998-2000) E-Loan's former headquarters in Pleasanton, California (now occupied by Workday, Inc.). Pawlowski and Larsen were in talks with Intuit over a $130 million buyout in the fall of 1998. Forbes wrote that \\"Pawlowski and Larsen, who together held a 40% stake and had placed 20% more in an employee stock plan, would each walk away with $10 million in cash and $16 million in Intuit stock.\\" Days before the deal closed in August, however, Yahoo CEO Timothy Koogle pitched a deal to buy a 23% stake of E-Loan's outstanding shares for $25 million. Both Larsen's and Pawlowski's payouts would be less, but they would retain control of the company and the E-Loan brand would survive. Choosing to work with Yahoo, E-Loan also raised venture capital from Softbank and Sequoia Capital. In 1998 E-Loan had total annual revenues of $6.8 million, and the following year Larsen offered the role of CEO back to Pawlowski, though she elected to remain President. In late March 1999, E-Loan filed for an initial public offering, and it went public in June 1999. The company processed $470 million of mortgage loans in the first quarter of 1999, and by the second financial quarter, revenues for the year had reached $4.6 million. E-Loan lost $13 million in the third quarter of 1999, though revenues overall had grown from the year before by 200%. As of October 1999 the company employed around 350 people. That year overall E-Loan processed 5000 loans, which at 25% of the online mortgage loan market was the highest percent of any online company. By February 2000, E-Loan's market value was estimated at around $1 billion, with Larsen serving as both CEO and Chairman. During his tenure E-Loan became the first company to freely provide consumers' FICO credit scores. Privacy activism and E-Loan sale (2001-2005) Larsen has described himself as \\"radically pro-consumer,\\" and in the early 2000s he became a vocal advocate of financial privacy in California. In 2001, a bill sponsored by Assemblywoman Jackie Speier proposed a requirement for consumers to opt in before financial services companies could share or sell personal information such as bank balances, phone numbers, and social security numbers. While the bill had public support, it was initially defeated by pro-business legislators. In response, Larsen co-founded the coalition Californians for Privacy Now, helping fund the project with $1 million of his own money. Larsen spearheaded the collection of 600,000 signatures in support of Speier's bill, which was almost double the required amount to issue a ballot to state voters. The signatures, combined with a lobbying campaign by Consumer Watchdog throughout 2002, led to major financial firms and legislators withdrawing their opposition, and the bill passed in August 2003. Speier acknowledged Larsen's influence on the ruling, stating \\"without Chris Larsen, California's financial privacy law, which sets the standard for the rest of the nation, would never have become a reality.\\" As of May 2004, E-Loan had sold over $18.9 billion in consumer loans since its inception, and the company had remained profitable for eight quarters in a row. Larsen stepped down as CEO in early 2005 to start Prosper Marketplace and remained Chairman until E-Loan was sold to Banco Popular in 2005. Prosper Marketplace (2005-2011) In 2005, Larsen and John Witchel co-founded Prosper Marketplace Larsen served as CEO. From 2006 to 2009, Prosper operated a variable rate model, acting as an eBay-style online auction marketplace with lenders and borrowers ultimately determining loan rates using a Dutch auction- like system. Through the website, borrowers can request personal loans, while Prosper handles the servicing of the loan and distributes borrower payments and interest back to the loan investors. Prosper also makes borrowers' \\"credit grades\\" public, and verifies identities and select personal data. Larsen himself had funded 450 loans through the website as of 2008, with borrowers as diverse as homeowners, college students, credit-card users, and entrepreneurs. By 2008, Prosper had facilitated the funding of over $120 million in loans, with an average loan amount of $7,000. In 2008 Fast Company named Prosper to its Fast 50 List of the \\"most innovative companies of the year.\\" The company soon ran into regulatory opposition from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as current loan regulations were focused on traditional banks, not technology startups. In 2008, Prosper filed its first prospectus with the SEC, changing its business model to use pre-set rates based on a formula evaluating each prospective borrower's credit risk. In 2011 Larsen was outwardly supportive of the Occupy Wall Street movement, raising money to help feed protestors at the nearby OWS encampment in San Francisco. By the end of the year, Prosper had facilitated $271 million in peer-to-peer loans, and the company had received a total of $74.5 million in funding from investors such as Jim Breyer, Tim Draper, Omidyar Network, Nigel Morris, and Court Coursey. On March 15, 2012 Larsen announced that he would be resigning from his role as CEO, though he remained Chairman of the company. Founding OpenCoin (2012-2013) In September 2012, Larsen co-founded the company OpenCoin, which began developing a new payment protocol called Ripple, based on a concept developed by Ryan Fugger. The Ripple protocol enables the instant and direct transfer of money between two parties. As such the protocol can circumnavigate the fees and wait times of the traditional correspondent banking system, and any type of currency can be exchanged including gold, airline miles, and rupees. To maintain security OpenCoin programmed Ripple to rely on a common ledger that is \\"managed by a network of independent validating servers that constantly compare their transaction records.\\" Servers can belong to anyone including banks or market makers. The company also created its own form of digital currency in a manner similar to Bitcoin, using the currency to allow financial institutions to transfer money with negligible fees and wait-time. On May 14, 2013, OpenCoin announced that it had closed a second round of angel funding, and among their earliest investors were Andreessen Horowitz, Google Ventures, and IDG Capital Partners. Ripple Labs (2013-2020) In September 2013, OpenCoin changed its name to Ripple Labs, Inc., with Larsen remaining CEO. Ripple Labs then announced that the source code for the peer-to-peer node behind the Ripple payment network was open source. Ripple Labs continued as the primary contributors of code to the consensus verification system behind Ripple, which it said could integrate with banks' IT systems. In 2014 Ripple was the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, after Bitcoin. Also that month, Ripple Labs was named one of the 50 Smartest Companies by MIT Technology Review.

Career In 1945, AG Fronzoni opened his own studio in Brescia, Italy that specialized in publishing, graphic design, architecture, exhibition design and industrial design. He edited architectural magazines including Punta and Casabella. In 1956, Fronzoni founded a second studio in Milan. In 1963 he designed the minimalist, Quadra Lamp and a sleek briefcase in collaboration with Italian luxury brand Valextra. From 1965 to 1967 Fronzoni was the designer for the architectural magazine Casabella. Fronzoni taught at the Societ√† Umanitaria in Milan, Istituto d‚Äô Arte of Monza and the Istituto Delle Industrie Artistiche in Urbino. He founded his own school in Milan in 1987. During this period, Fronzoni founded a workshop school which he ran from 1982-2001. Fronzoni died in 2002. The Bottega With the Bottega, Fronzoni developed a new type of teaching different from the models used by vocational schools, known for the relationships established with its students. For Fronzoni, projects came to life from reality: every event is subject to design analysis, and the practice of provocation is always pushing for the comparison, reflection, and formation of a critical sense. Education, like all other forms of social communication, was essential for Fronzoni. He felt it necessary to pass on the knowledge he had accumulated through years of practice. Fronzoni's workshop \\"trained and directed students towards the art of continual research and turning that research into the essence of life, nature and the form around them\\". \\"Since being invited into schools in 1967, I have become more and more aware that the real job of the designer, rather than any technique, is to cultivate: the designer's real objective is not to build the city but to show how a city may be built, with the city as a tangible form of civilisation.\\" - AG Fronzoni Manitto, Ester. \\"A Lezione Con A G Fronzoni, Il Libro Su Ag Fronzoni Scritto Da Ester Manitto.\\" A Lezione Con A G Fronzoni, Il Libro Su Ag Fronzoni Scritto Da Ester Manitto. Core Progetti, n.d. Web. 19 Feb. 2017. \\"My ambition is not to design a poster, it's designing men.\\" The Philosophy \\"The deeper meaning of the design is not so much to build a house, how to build it ourselves. Design their own existence is a commitment that must be our main concern, and this commitment must be total and continuous, non-drinker and relative.\\" Fronzoni believed in the ability to transform the world through design and design through culture. He did not hesitate to fight for the sense of form, even to defending a tiny typeface. The small historic influence in Italy of the Bauhaus made him maintain an attitude of critical and uncompromising standing of what is conventional, formal and conformist, which is reflected in its particular way of life transgression, a transgression absolutely \\"governed rather than disobedient\\".\\"Philosophy.\\" Agfronzoni.com. N.p., n.d. Web. 19 Feb. 2017. Fronzoni claimed that he was not aiming to satisfy the needs of the clients, but rather to do away with them. Fronzoni believed that the art of design should not be kept to the professionals but be as \\"widespread as writing\\". He believed his only client was the community and in turn became a designer for the people. Black & White Fronzoni considers black and white as the colors representative of the design of man, an expression of opposition and reflection, while the color belongs to the natural world and is so alien, but not as an alternative to the work of man. Fronzoni's many projects reflect his ideals towards black and white: the rigor of the contrast of white and black, provides a sense of conceptual purity as well as the tones of minimalism. The poster is the space of freedom of thought, without limits or rules, essentially a sandbox. The typefaces are for Fronzoni the \\"grammar\\" of graphic design: small if you have to emphasize the space of reading if you are thinking are large, cut, scored, manipulated.http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/black-white-design/ \\"The symmetry of the past, while the asymmetry is modern, because it is dynamic, and a staple for contemporary design. What has been done not only is modern: it is the mirror of a society is not advanced.\\"  Projects  Casabella: During the mid-sixties, Fronzoni and Alessandro Mendini were responsible for the visual language and layout of one of the most important magazines on architecture: Casabella. Fronzoni's approach as art director shaped its style and content. The issues published between 1965 and 1967, under his direction can be considered a radical reinterpretation of the already established Swiss style. Each cover featured a tiny masthead accompanied by one picture printed in a single colour. The arrangement of the image gave a preview of the grid Fronzoni used for the pages inside. The upper quarter of the page was reserved for headlines. The rest of the page was based on an asymmetric layout with text starting on the left column and pictures spreading alongside over two columns. The whole magazine was typeset in Helvetica. After two years of successful collaboration, when the editor Gian Antonio Bernasconi asked Fronzoni to redesign the magazine he resigned.\\"Household Cleaning Tools and Supplies.\\" Casabella.com  Household Cleaning Tools and Supplies.

The market houses more than 35 year-round vendor stalls, and is open seven days a week. An outdoor farmers' market that is open on Sundays and Wednesdays from May to November began in 2014 on the plaza next to the building. Vendors for the indoor market are selected by the operator, the non-profit Boston Public Market Association, and must sell food and other products that are produced or originate in New England, as well as a limited amount of certain produce that is not able to grow in New England. The market was the first in the United States with an all-local-food requirement. That being said, the requirement was not met by all vendors. The association operates a second seasonal outdoor farmers' market in Dewey Square, near the southern end of the Greenway. The Trustees of Reservations operates a vendor booth with dairy products from its Appleton Farms. The Trustees also operates a 3,200 square foot kitchen within the market that will be \\"programmed with hands-on cooking demos, lectures, family activities, exercise classes, training and community events.\\" Building The market occupies most of the ground floor of a mixed use building constructed as part of the Big Dig highway and tunnel project. The building, on a site known as Parcel 7, also includes ventilation towers for the underground highway, a portion of the Haymarket Station of the MBTA Green and Orange lines, the Haymarket Center Garage, and office space occupied by the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles. The building's architect was Arrowstreet. Market District Markets have been in operation in this part of Boston at least since 1743, when a market opened on the ground floor of the new Faneuil Hall. The three buildings of Quincy Market were added in 1826. These four buildings are today referred to as Faneuil Hall Marketplace. Street vendors have sold fruit, vegetables, and other products in the area since about 1830. The street vendors now operate as Haymarket, which consists of temporary stalls on Blackstone and Hanover Streets on Fridays and Saturdays year round, and which is managed by the Haymarket Pushcart Association. In 2009, the Project for Public Spaces released a \\"Boston Market District Feasibility Study\\" commissioned by the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA). The proposed district would encompass the Parcel 7 market, a market on the ground floor of a building to be built on the adjacent Parcel 9, Haymarket, and the Faneuil Hall Marketplace. History The site that eventually became Parcel 7 was cleared of its former buildings as part of the construction of Government Center in the 1960s. A map in the 1964 Government Center Redevelopment Plan shows that a hotel was planned to be built on the site, but the hotel was never built. A 1969 aerial photo shows the site being used for parking. In 1987, a 19-story hotel and office building was proposed for the site; it was never built. Parcel 7 building before construction of the market The land continued to be used for parking until construction of the Tip O'Neill Tunnel began in the early 1990s as part of the Big Dig, when the mixed use structure was built on Parcel 7. As a mitigation measure for the loss of this parking lot and other nearby parking, the Parcel 7 garage offers low-cost validated parking to customers of local merchants. The expansion of the Haymarket MBTA station into the basement of the building was completed in 2000. The parking garage opened for public use in 2001. The Big Dig ventilation equipment in building was put into use when the tunnel opened in 2003. Fit-out of the office space for use by the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority was halted in 2006 following the resignation of Turnpike Chairman Matthew Amorello. In 2008, the Massachusetts General Court passed an environmental bond authorization that provided \\"that not less than $10,000,000 shall be expended to establish a program to facilitate the creation of a general public market in Boston to provide local agricultural, seafood and aquaculture, dairy and specialty foods produced in the commonwealth\\". In 2009, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation issued a request for proposals from developers to lease the office space, garage, and ground floor market in the Parcel 7 building. Two bids were received, but the state rejected both bids. State officials said neither bid provided high enough lease payments. The state subsequently decided to keep the office space for state agency use, to retain control over the parking garage, and to seek an operator for the ground floor market. The Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles moved into the office space in 2014. In 2011, the state Department of Agricultural Resources commissioned the Project for Public Spaces to develop an implementation plan for a market in the building. Later the same year, the department issued a Request for Proposals for the development and operation of a \\"Public Food Market.\\" The bid submitted by the Boston Public Market Association was the only one submitted to the state. The Association was awarded the project in March 2012. In 2014, the Boston Public Market Association submitted to the BRA its plans for the market, which were developed by the firm Architerra. The BRA approved the plans in April 2014, and construction began later in the year. The market opened in July 2015. The estimated construction cost of $15 million was funded with $6 million in grants to the market from the 2008 state bond authorization, $6 million in private donations, and a $3 million loan from The Conservation Fund. The market's first CEO was Liz Morningstar. She was succeeded by Cheryl Cronin in January 2016.

The books are published by former residents or landsmanshaft societies as remembrances of homes, people and ways of life lost during World War II. Yizkor books usually focus on a town but may include sections on neighboring smaller communities. Most of these books are written in Yiddish or Hebrew, some also include sections in English or other languages, depending on where they were published. Since the 1990s, many of these books, or sections of them have been translated into English, digitized, and made available online. History The publication of Yizkor books was one of the earliest ways in which the Holocaust was communally commemorated. A memorial book about the Jewish community of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ was produced in New York City in 1943. It was the first of more than 900 of this type that were subsequently published. More of these books began to appear in the mid to late 1940s and were usually published privately rather than by publishing companies. Voluntary societies and welfare services of the various European Jewish communities, called landsmanshaften, usually took the lead in publishing them for their members who shared a common regional origin, history and culture. The first Yizkor books were published in the United States, mainly in Yiddish, the mother tongue of most of the members of the landsmanschaften and Holocaust survivors. Beginning in the 1950s, after the immigration of large numbers of Holocaust survivors to the newly independent State of Israel, most of the Yizkor books were published there, between the mid-1950s and the mid-1970s, and mainly, but not exclusively, in Hebrew. From the late 1970s, the number of collective memorial books published declined, but this was offset by the publication of an increasing number of Holocaust survivors' personal stories and memoirs. In total, about three-quarters of all the Yizkor books were ultimately published in Israel, and more than 60% of the total are in Hebrew. Collections and translations Most Yizkor books were published in very limited quantities, and are therefore usually difficult to find and expensive to purchase. However, there have been a number of projects to collect and preserve these publications, digitize their contents and translate them into English, and make them available online: Large collections of Yizkor books are housed at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., the Jewish Theological Seminary and Yeshiva University in New York, University of California Los Angeles, the Holocaust Center of Northern California in San Francisco, Harvard and Brandeis universities near Boston, the Price Library of Judaica at the University of Florida, Gainesville, the Jewish Public Library of Montreal, and the Jewish Documentation and Research Center of Mexico. YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, and the New York Public Library in New York City, and the National Yiddish Book Center at Amherst, Massachusetts, have physical copies of the books as well as publicly accessible online repositories. The Jewish family history website, JewishGen, established a Yizkor Book Project in 1994 to make the contents of Yizkor books more accessible to researchers, historians and genealogists by translating them into English and compiling an index of names of Holocaust victims memorialized, or others who are mentioned, in the books. The site also contains a bibliographic database of locations and libraries with Yizkor book holdings worldwide and includes call numbers for over 50 libraries.

Legal Tech companies are often startups founded with the purpose of disrupting the traditionally conservative legal market. Definitions Legal technology traditionally referred to the application of technology and software to help individual lawyers, law firms, medium and large scale businesses with practice management, document storage, billing, accounting and electronic discovery. Since 2011, Legal Tech has evolved to be associated more with technology startups disrupting the practice of law by giving people access to online software that reduces or in some cases eliminates the need to consult a lawyer, or by connecting people with lawyers more efficiently through online marketplaces and lawyer-matching websites. Industry context The legal industry is widely seen to be conservative and traditional, with Law Technology Today noting that \\"in 50 years, the customer experience at most law firms has barely changed\\". Reasons for this include the fact law firms face weaker cost-cutting incentives than other professions (since they pass disbursements directly to their client) and are seen to be risk averse (as a minor technological error could have significant financial consequences for a client). However, the growth of the hiring by businesses of in-house counsel and their increasing sophistication, together with the development of email, has led to clients placing increasing cost and time pressure on their lawyers. In addition, there are increasing incentives for lawyers to become technologically competent, with the American Bar Association voting in August 2012 to amend the Model Rules of Professional Conduct to require lawyers to keep abreast of \\"the benefits and risks associated with relevant technology\\", and in late 2019, the Federation of Law Societies of Canada adopted a similar amendment to the Model Code of Professional Conduct.https://flsc.ca/interactivecode/ The saturation of the market is leading many lawyers to look for cutting-edge ways to compete. The exponential growth in the volume of documents (mostly email) that must be reviewed for litigation cases has greatly accelerated the adoption of technology used in eDiscovery, with elements of machine language and artificial intelligence being incorporated and cloud-based services being adopted by law firms.James N Dertouzos, Nicholas M Pace and Robert H Anderson, The Legal And Economic Implications Of Electronic Discovery (Rand Institute for Civil Justice, 2008) 3; Pavan Mediratta, \\"Using Legal Data Analytics To Gain A Competitive Advantage\\", LAW.COM (Webpage, 2017) . Stanford Law School has started CodeX, the Center for Legal Informatics, an interdisciplinary research center, which also incubates companies started by law students and computer scientists. Some companies that have come out of the program include Lex Machina and Legal.io. Key areas Traditional areas of Legal Tech include: * Contract Management * Matter and Case Management * Accounting * Billing * Document automation * Document storage * Electronic discovery * Legal research * Practice management * Case management More recent areas of growth in Legal Tech focus on: * Providing tools or a marketplace to connect clients with lawyers *Client Relationship Management (CRM) tools * Providing tools for consumers and businesses to complete legal matters by themselves, obviating the need for a lawyer * Data and contract analytics * Law practice optimization * Use of legally binding digital signature, which helps verify the digital identity of each signer, maintains the chain of custody for the documents and can provide audit trails * Automation of legal writing or other substantive aspects of legal practice * Platforms for succession planning i.e. Will writing, via online applications * Providing tools to assist with immigration document preparation in lieu of hiring a lawyer.

The House of Representatives version was also known as H.R. 920 and was re-drafted by Raul Labrador, (R-ID) on February 12, 2015. The Senate version of 2015 was known as S. 502 and was drafted by Mike Lee, (R-UT). Similar to the 2013 version, it was legislation focused on reducing the federal prison population and the strain on limited federal resources in the federal prison system. It amends the federal criminal code to direct the court to impose a sentence for certain offenses with discretionary regard to any statutory minimum sentence. It specifies that the most serious offenders be exempt from statutory minimum sentences which caused many of the very longest sentences.  History  The Smarter Sentencing Act of 2015 was a continued effort from the Smarter Sentencing Act of 2013/2014. The Senate version of 2013/2014, called S 1410, was introduced by Richard Durbin (D-IL) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT). The 113th Congress held several hearing and heard testimony through 2013 and 2014 without passage. A Bi-partisan Summit on Criminal Justice Reform, met in March 2015 to discuss reforming America's criminal justice system and received national news coverage.https://huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/30/bipartisan- summit-criminal-justice_n_6971242.html The Senate version (S.502) had gained 12 Bi-partisan co-sponsors by late May 2015; the house version (H.R.920) had 43 Bi-partisan co-sponsors by the same date. By the summer recess, H.R.920 had 52 co-sponsors and S. 502 had 12. Both version had been moved to committee for further discussion. The bill's Bi-Partisan support from both the Republican and Democratic parties helped increase its likelihood of moving through committee hearings. Additionally, organizations were behind the bill and actively encouraging its passage.http://famm.org/s-502-the-smarter-sentencing- act/ The House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary was the next step in the bill being passed into law. The hearings and testimony that occurred in 2013 in relation to the 2013 version continued to be on record and in support of the 2015 version. The United States Sentencing Commission ( www.ussc.gov) prepared a publication called \\"Life Sentences in the Federal System\\" in February 2015. The document discussed the sentencing guidelines causing life sentences to be issued for various types of offenses. It detailed the costs associated with inmates serving life sentences and detailed the consideration for public safety should modifying the guidelines and reducing the sentences occur. In October 2015 Bob Goodlatte (R-VA)revised it and used the name, H.R. 3713 Sentencing Reform Act of 2015. Edits include language to define a serious violent felony and reducing the terms on a number of drug offenses. It was proposed to strike ... \\"mandatory life imprisonment... to ...\\"not less than 25 years. It also added language making the reforms applicable to past cases. The Senate bill, now named S.2123: Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, was revised by Charles Grassley R-IA. The committees assigned to this bill passed the act by a vote of 15-5 and sent it to the House or Senate as a whole for consideration on October 22, 2015. On November 5, 2015 there was a significant move with the legislation. Both parties and both chambers of Congress agreed to revisions to federal sentencing guidelines and the mandatory minimums. The text of the 140 plus page bill was posted at the Judicial Committee's website,.http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/10-01-15%20Sentencing%20Reform%20and%20Corrections%20Act%20-%20Bill%20Text.pdf Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015.  Text  The original language in the bill references the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 and specific language detailing certain drug offenses. The original text reduces sentences by about half. As written ... \\"Sec. 4.Sentencing modifications for certain drug offenses (a)Controlled Substances Act.‚Äî The Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.) is amended‚Äî (1)in section 102 (21 U.S.C. 802), by adding at the end the following: (57)The term \\"courier\\" means a defendant whose role in the offense was limited to transporting or storing drugs or money. ; and (2)in section 401(b)(1) (21 U.S.C. 841(b)(1))‚Äî (A)in the flush text following clause (viii)‚Äî (i)by striking \\"10 years or more\\" and inserting \\"5 years or more\\"; (ii)by striking \\"such person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be less than 20 years and\\" and inserting \\"such person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years and\\"; and (iii)by striking \\"mandatory term of life imprisonment without release\\" and inserting \\"term of imprisonment of not less than 25 years\\"; and (B)in the flush text following clause (viii)‚Äî (i)by striking \\"5 years\\" and inserting \\"2 years\\"; and (ii)by striking \\"not be less than 10 years\\" and inserting \\"not be less than 5 years\\"...\\" The text goes on further directing the United States Sentencing Commission to consider the safety of the public when reducing the sentences of offenders and the Attorney General to report on the results of the Smarter Sentencing Act of 2015. The November 2015 edits additional safe guards from releasing repeat, violent offenders and applied retroactivity to sentences.

History The institute was established on the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine on July 23, 1936 and the Presidium of Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR on July 27, 1936 based on several departments and commission of the Academy and the All-Ukrainian Association of Marx-Lenin Institutes (VUAMLIN). Original it was composed of three departments: history of Ukraine in feudalism epoch, history of Ukraine in epoch of capitalism and imperialism, and history of Ukraine in Soviet period. After the Soviet annexation of eastern Poland during the World War II, in Lviv, Western Ukraine was established a branch of the institute, which was headed by Ivan Krypiakevych. After the war in 1946, the branch was liquidated. In 1951 the Lviv's branch was revived as part of the UkrSSR Academy of Science Institute of Social Studies (today known as the NASU Krypiakevych Institute of Ukrainian Studies). During World War II, the institute was evacuated to Ufa, Bashkir ASSR where it along with the UkrSSR AS Institute of Archaeology became a department of history and archaeology of the UkrSSR AS Institute of Social Studies. It returned to Kyiv on 25 March 1944. On 17 July 1944 the institute was reconstituted with four departments: history of feudalism, history of capitalism, history of Soviet period, history of archaeography. In 1945 the Institute of History of Ukraine had staff of 13 scientists, including 3 doctors of sciences and 7 candidates of sciences. On 9 June 1944 the All-Union Committee in affairs of Higher School confirmed its pre-war decision for providing the faculty council of the institute the right to accept for review candidate dissertations and award based on thesis defense a science degree of candidate of historical sciences specializing in \\"History of Ukraine\\" and \\"History of the USSR\\". In 1950 the institute had eight departments history of feudalism, history of capitalism, history of Soviet society, military history, history of countries of people's democracy, historiography and historical funds, worldwide history and international relations, archaeography. In the spirit of the 1947 Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine guidelines there was prepared a dual volume book \\"History of Ukrainian SSR\\" (1953‚Äì1957). In connection with celebration of the 300th Anniversary of Ukraine annexation to the Russian state there were prepared collection of documents \\"The Union of Ukraine with Russia\\" (, Moscow, 1953), written texts to collective monograph \\"the 1648-1654 Liberation War and union of Ukraine with Russia\\" (Kiev, 1954). Since 1955 the institute had six departments history of Soviet society, history of capitalism, history of feudalism, history of countries of people's democracy, worldwide history and international relations, archaeography. In 1960 the department of history of Soviet society was split in two history of the Great October Socialist Revolution and civil war, history of socialist and communist development.

It was the most powerful earthquake to strike Nepal since the 1934 Nepal‚ÄìBihar earthquake. Many thousands of people died as a result, with most casualties reported in Nepal, including on Mount Everest, and adjoining areas of India, China, and Bangladesh. Within minutes of the earthquake, the Government of India, via the Indian Armed Forces, initiated Operation Maitri (Operation Amity), created humanitarian missions with the primary objective of conducting relief and rescue operations in Nepal. India has been the largest aid donor to Nepal following the earthquake with a billion dollar support apart from other non- monetary reliefs extended. Many countries and organizations have donated aid including China, the United Kingdom,; and the United States, all of which provided or funded helicopters as requested by the Nepali government. Numerous charitable organizations, such as UNICEF and Doctors Without Borders, are delivering aid on the ground. Israel provided a large team of people to the relief effort in Nepal, second only to India. Another earthquake, or major aftershock struck Nepal on 12 May 2015. A total of $3bn was pledged by donors to help rebuild Nepal. India Saturday, 25 April: Initial response Government of India was among the first to respond to the crisis, by launching a full-fledged rescue and relief operation codenamed Operation Maitri (Operation Amity). Within 15 minutes of the quake, Prime Minister Narendra Modi responded, directing immediate dispatch of relief and rescue teams, including medical teams, to Nepal. By the same afternoon, ten teams from India's National Disaster Response Force, totaling 450 personnel and including several search and rescue dogs, had already arrived in Nepal; ten additional Indian Air Force planes soon departed to join them with further aid. In the immediate aftermath of the quake, India sent 43 tons of relief material, including tents and food. Prime Minister Modi spoke with Nepalese Prime Minister Sushil Koirala and assured him of India's support and assistance. The Indian Army sent three top military commanders, led by Major General J. S. Sandhu to Nepal to coordinate, oversee and fast-track the rescue, relief and evacuation efforts. The Indian personnel are working closely with hundreds of retired Gorkha soldiers of the Indian Army. The Indian Air Force mobilised its Ilyushin Il-76, C-130J Hercules, Antonov An-32 and C-17 Globemaster transport aircraft and Mi-17 helicopters for Operation Maitri. Sunday, 26 April The Indian Air Force evacuated over 500 citizens from Nepal late Saturday through Sunday morning, and hundreds more on Sunday. Ten flights were planned for Sunday. These would airlift army forward hospitals, teams of doctors, nurses, and paramedics, engineering task forces, water, food, National Disaster Response Force teams, medical personnel and equipment, blankets, stretchers and tents. Prime Minister Modi vowed to wipe the tears of every person in Nepal in his Mann Ki Baat address to the nation. An Indian army mountaineering team recovered the bodies of 19 mountaineers from Everest base camp and rescued at least 61 stranded climbers from Mount Everest. Indian Air Force helicopters reached Mount Everest on the morning of 26 April for rescue operations. Indian Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar announced that six more National Disaster Response Force teams would be sent to Nepal in the next 48 hours. He also announced that the aircraft sent to Nepal would not just rescue Indians, but citizens of other countries as well. By Sunday night, India dispatched a further 10 tons of blankets, 50 tons of water, 22 tons of food items and 2 tons of medical supplies to Kathmandu. Nearly 1,000 National Disaster Response Force personnel were also pressed into service, and a \\"big evacuation\\" of Indian citizens was underway through the road route. The government deployed 35 buses to evacuate stranded Indians in Nepal via two routes‚ÄîSonauli and Raxaul‚Äîalong the Indo-Nepal border. India started issuing goodwill visas to foreigners stranded in Nepal and mobilizing buses and ambulances to bring them to India by road. Indian Railways shipped 100,000 (one lakh) bottles of drinking water via the Air Force to be delivered as part of the relief effort. Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu later tweeted out that there were arrangements being made to supply 100,000 bottles every day. Air India reduced fares on flights bound for Kathmandu from Delhi, Kolkata, Varanasi, and announced that it would also carry relief material on its flights. Similarly, SpiceJet offered to accommodate \\"accredited NGOs and relief organizations looking to transport emergency supplies\\" and doctors free of charge. Monday, 27 April By Monday morning, the Indian Air Force had evacuated 1,935 Indian citizens from Nepal using 12 aircraft sorties. Indian Army sources said six of 18 medical teams tasked to help with the relief efforts in Nepal had been deployed. The Indian Army was in the process of sending 10 engineer task forces with machinery to clear roads and debris. The troops have taken with them a further 10,000 blankets and 1,000 tents are on standby. The Indian army was also bringing oxygen cylinders for distribution to medical teams. An inter-ministerial team comprising senior officials from the ministries of Home, Defence, External Affairs and the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) have gone to Nepal to coordinate rescue and relief operations. The decision to send the high-level team was taken at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday.

Avalanches The avalanche is reported to have started between Pumori (Left) and Lingtren (middle peak) Khumbutse to the right Mount Everest is approximately east of the epicentre, and between 700 and 1,000 people were on or near the mountain when the earthquake struck, Page not found including 359 climbers at Base Camp, many of whom had returned after the aborted 2014 season.

No longer available This report cites the Associated Press and Misidentifies Pumori and Komori An Indian Army mountaineering team recovered the bodies of 19 mountaineers from the South Base Camp and rescued at least 61 stranded climbers from the mountain. At least 61 people were injured, with dozens initially reported missing, and many more stranded at camps at higher elevations, having lost secure descent routes.\\"Avalanche sweeps Everest base camp, killing 17, injuring 61\\", 25 April 2015; accessed 28 April 2015. Rescue operations Map showing peak locations Helicopters reached Mount Everest on the morning of 26 April to commence rescue operations, managing to transport 22 of the badly injured to Pheriche village, before the operation was halted by bad weather. Pheriche is an important stopover for climbers, and has a rudimentary hospital staffed by volunteer doctors from the Himalayan Rescue Association. Later that day, a helicopter reportedly evacuated several climbers from Camp I, the first camp above Base Camp, with some 100 mountaineers still unable to safely descend from Camps I and II. Expedition leaders decided to try to evacuate climbers from Camp I by repairing the route through the Khumbu Icefall. On 26 April, a helicopter dropped additional technical gear at Camp I, and a team of Sherpas and foreign guides attempted to re-establish the route from the top back down to Base Camp. Simultaneously, another team dispatched from Base Camp tried to re-establish the route from the bottom up. But this attempt was unsuccessful as a subsequent avalanche took out most of the ladders and reportedly killed three Sherpas at Khumbu Icefall, pushing the death toll on the mountain to at least 24. Further climbers were rescued via helicopter on 27 April. Climbers at Base Camp posted on Twitter in the days after the disaster, writing of \\"great desolation\\" and \\"high uncertainty\\" among those who were left, and stating that the area looked as if it had been hit by a nuclear bomb; one mountaineer, commenting on Facebook, said that people stuck higher up on the mountain were \\"getting desperate\\".

Effect on 2015 climbing season Although the ladders at the Khumbu Icefall were damaged by the avalanches, a handful of mountaineers, undeterred by the disaster, immediately sought Nepalese government permission to continue with their attempt on the mountain and were granted permission to do so on 29 April 2015. \\"The ladders will be repaired in the next two to three days and climbing will continue, there is no reason for anyone to quit their expedition,\\" said Tulsi Gautam, chief of the Nepal Department of Tourism. \\"There is no scientific reason to expect another quake... and we feel the ground is stable enough for climbing despite aftershocks.\\" The closure of routes over the icefall for the remainder of the season was later announced, the second consecutive year that the mountain has been closed due to avalanches. After the second earthquake on 12 May 2015, Dambar Parajuli, president of the Expedition Operators' Association of Nepal, said there were no climbers or Nepali sherpa guides remaining at Everest Base Camp.

The tunnelling units were occupied in offensive and defensive mining involving the placing and maintaining of mines under enemy lines, as well as other underground work such as the construction of deep dugouts for troop accommodation, the digging of subways, saps (a narrow trench dug to approach enemy trenches), cable trenches and underground chambers for signals and medical services.The Tunnelling Companies RE , access date 25 April 2015 Background By January 1915 it had become evident to the BEF at the Western Front that the Germans were mining to a planned system. As the British had failed to develop suitable counter- tactics or underground listening devices before the war, field marshals French and Kitchener agreed to investigate the suitability of forming British mining units. Following consultations between the Engineer-in-Chief of the BEF, Brigadier George Fowke, and the mining specialist John Norton-Griffiths, the War Office formally approved the tunnelling company scheme on 19 February 1915. Norton-Griffiths ensured that tunnelling companies numbers 170 to 177 were ready for deployment in mid-February 1915. In the spring of that year, there was constant underground fighting in the Ypres Salient at Hooge, Hill 60, Railway Wood, Sanctuary Wood, St Eloi and The Bluff which required the deployment of new drafts of tunnellers for several months after the formation of the first eight companies. The lack of suitably experienced men led to some tunnelling companies starting work later than others. The number of units available to the BEF was also restricted by the need to provide effective counter-measures to the German mining activities.Peter Barton/Peter Doyle/Johan Vandewalle, Beneath Flanders Fields - The Tunnellers' War 1914-1918, Staplehurst (Spellmount) (978-1862272378) p. 165. To make the tunnels safer and quicker to deploy, the British Army enlisted experienced coal miners, many outside their nominal recruitment policy. The first nine companies, numbers 170 to 178, were each commanded by a regular Royal Engineers officer. These companies each comprised 5 officers and 269 sappers; they were aided by additional infantrymen who were temporarily attached to the tunnellers as required, which almost doubled their numbers. The success of the first tunnelling companies formed under Norton-Griffiths' command led to mining being made a separate branch of the Engineer-in-Chief's office under Major-General S.R. Rice, and the appointment of an 'Inspector of Mines' at the GHQ Saint-Omer office of the Engineer-in-Chief. A second group of tunnelling companies were formed from Welsh miners from the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the Monmouthshire Regiment, who were attached to the 1st Northumberland Field Company of the Royal Engineers, which was a Territorial unit. The formation of twelve new tunnelling companies, between July and October 1915, helped to bring more men into action in other parts of the Western Front. Most tunnelling companies were formed under Norton-Griffiths' leadership during 1915, and one more was added in 1916.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 52. On 10 September 1915, the British government sent an appeal to Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand to raise tunnelling companies in the Dominions of the British Empire. On 17 September, New Zealand became the first Dominion to agree the formation of a tunnelling unit. The New Zealand Tunnelling Company arrived at Plymouth on 3 February 1916 and was deployed to the Western Front in northern France.Anthony Byledbal, \\"New Zealand Tunnelling Company: Chronology\\" (online ), access date 5 July 2015 A Canadian unit was formed from men on the battlefield, plus two other companies trained in Canada and then shipped to France. Three Australian tunnelling companies were formed by March 1916, resulting in 30 tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers being available by the summer of 1916. Unit history Map of the mines laid before the Battle of Messines, 1917 Plan for the British deep mine at Hollandscheschur Farm with its three chambers Plan for the British deep mine at Petit Bois with its two chambers and the crater of the German counter mine of 1916 clearly visible Plan for the British deep mine at Peckham Farm Spanbroekmolen crater in November 2009. It was created in 1917 by one of the mines in the Battle of Messines. It is also known as \\"Lone Tree Crater\\" or \\"Pool of Peace\\". 250th Tunnelling Company was formed in Rouen in October 1915. It was then moved into the Ypres Salient, where it relieved 177th Tunnelling Company, which at that time was stationed in a wide area facing Wijtschate. From May 1916 until December 1918 the company served under Reserve (later Fifth) Army.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 21. Messines 1916/17  As part of the prelude to the Battle of Messines, deep-level mine galleries were dug by the British 171st, 175th and 250th Tunnelling companies and the 1st Canadian, 3rd Canadian and 1st Australian Tunnelling companies, while the British 183rd, 2nd Canadian and 2nd Australian Tunnelling companies built dugouts (underground shelters) in the Second Army area. 250th Tunnelling Company's role prior to the Battle of Messines was to dig the mines at Petit Bois, Peckham and Spanbroekmolen under the Messines ridge. The mines at Messines were detonated on 7 June 1917, creating craters. In November 1915, 250th Tunnelling Company began work on the deep mine at Hollandscheschur Farm as it sank a shaft to some and then drove a tunnel over extending well behind the German lines. Despite counter-mining by German units, three charges were eventually placed and fired. The mine consisted of three chambers (Hollandscheschur Farm 1, 2, 3) with a shared gallery. It was placed around the German strongpoint G√ºnther between Wijtschate and Voormezele, not far from the Bayernwald trenches in Croonaert Wood. The logic behind the exact placing of the charges at Hollandscheschur Farm was to take out a small German salient (strongpoint G√ºnther) that protruded into the British lines. In December 1915, 250th Tunnelling Company began work on the deep mine at Petit Bois. The mine consisted of two chambers (Petit Bois 1, 2) with a shared gallery. Tunnelling began about 170 m behind the British forward lines and first went down over . As with many deep mines, compressed air and electricity were supplied from the surface. The tunnellers experimented with a mechanical excavator operated by hydraulic rams, similar to those used for the London Underground. The device weighed more than half a ton and promised to cut a tunnel about in diameter. In March 1916 it was used to dig but developed difficulties and was abandoned in situ. The main gallery of the Petit Bois mine was taken out by clay kicking over and reached beyond the German lines when it was breached by enemy counter-mining. When the enemy blew a camouflet in June, 12 men were trapped by a collapsed tunnel over below the surface. After six days, the British tunnellers managed to rescue Sapper Bedson, a veteran of the Ypres Salient and of Gallipoli. When after six and a half days he was rescued, his first words were: ‚ÄúFor God‚Äôs sake give me a drink! It‚Äôs been a damned long shift!‚ÄùThis well-known anecdote is quoted in many places, e.g. here When completed, the main gallery leading to the two mine chambers was more than long. On 18 December 1915, the 250th Tunnelling Company began work on the deep mine at Peckham Farm. It consisted of two chambers (Peckham 1, 2) with a shared gallery. The shaft was sunk to , the heavy clay requiring much timber as the tunnel was driven forward to the German lines. Despite strenuous efforts to work as silently as possible, including the use of the 'clay kicking' method, German trench mortar activity caused many delays and flooding swamped much of the work, causing several earlier tunnels to be abandoned. The main charge was eventually placed below Peckham Farm as planned and in time, some from where the digging had started. Peckham 2 was placed under a farm building but abandoned after the tunnel flooded. Peckham 1 was detonated on 7 June 1917. 250th Tunnelling Company also started the deep mine under the German positions at Spanbroekmolen. This mine was named after a windmill that stood on the site for three centuries until it was destroyed by the Germans on 1 November 1914. In order to start a mine gallery, the tunnellers looked for some cover under which to dig a vertical shaft from which the tunnel could be driven forward towards the enemy lines. At Spanbroekmolen, the start point for the tunnel was in the area of a small wood some to the south-west. In December 1915, 250th Tunnelling Company dug a shaft and then handed over the work to 3rd Canadian Tunnelling Company in January 1916. Two shafts were sunk by 250th Tunnelling Company late in 1916 from Maedelstede Farm. They ran two long drives parallel for about then branched: one to place a mine away in the Bois de Wytschaete, the other beneath the front line. The Germans blew several heavy camouflets in the area and work was delayed as the miners had to be withdrawn from the tunnel regularly. The first gallery was driven but was halted when it became clear that it would not reach its objective in time. The second gallery was only completed on 6 June 1917, one day before the attack. 250th Tunnelling Company carried out the preparations for digging the deep mines at Kruisstraat, which were begun in December 1915, handed over to 182nd Tunnelling Company at the beginning of January 1916, and to 3rd Canadian Tunnelling Company at the end of the month.

Brooklyn: Pub. by the Veteran association of the regiment, 1885. The 48th New York Infantry mustered out of service on August 16, 1865. Detailed service The 48th, the \\"Continental Guard,\\" contained seven Brooklyn companies, one from New York, one from Monmouth County, N. J., and one from Brooklyn and Monmouth county. It was mustered into the U. S. service at Brooklyn Aug. 16 to Sept. 14, 1861, for three years; left the state for Washington Sept. 16; was attached to the 1st brigade of Gen. Sherman's force; embarked for Port Royal late in October, and was active in the capture of the fortifications of Port Royal ferry Jan. 1, 1862. In the siege operations against Fort Pulaski, Ga., the 48th took a prominent part and after the fall of the fortress was assigned to garrison duty there with expeditions in September and October to Bluffton, Cranston's Bluff and Mackay's Point. In June, 1863, the regiment with the exception of Cos. G and I, left Fort Pulaski and proceeded to Hilton Head, where it was there attached to Strong's Brigade, 10th Corps, with which it participated in the movement against Fort Wagner in July. In the assault of July 18, the loss of the 48th was 242 killed, wounded and missing, including Col. Barton wounded and Lieut.-Col. Green killed. The regiment received high praise from the commanding officers for its gallantry in this action. In August it formed a part of the Florida expedition; was posted for some time at St. Augustine; participated in the disastrous battle at Olustee, with a loss of 44 in killed, wounded and missing; then retired to Jacksonville; proceeded up the river to Palatka on March 10, 1864, remained there until April when it was transferred to the Army of the James at Bermuda Hundred, and was assigned to the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Division, 10th Corps. In the engagement at Port Walthall Junction the regiment again showed its mettle by heroic conduct in spite of severe loss. On May 30 it was assigned to the 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, 18th Corps, and on June 15, to the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Division, 10th Corps. It took a prominent part in the battle of Cold Harbor; was in the first assault on Petersburg and in action at the explosion of the mine; and was engaged at Strawberry Plains and Fort Harrison. The original members not reenlisted were mustered out at New York City on Sept. 24, 1864, but 350 members having reenlisted in Dec., 1863, the regiment retained its organization. In Dec., 1864, with the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Division, 24th Corps, the 48th was ordered to Fort Fisher, N. C., was active in the capture of the fortifications there in Jan., 1865, and served for some months in that vicinity. In March it was attached to the provisional corps, in April to the 10th Corps and during the summer months performed various routine duties in the neighborhood of Raleigh, N. C., where it was finally mustered out on Sept. 1, 1865. During its term of service 2,173 members were enrolled, and of these 236 or over 10 percent, were killed or mortally wounded in action, a loss exceeded among the regiments of the state only by the 69th and 40th. It was 17th in the list of all of the regiments of the Union armies in total loss. In the battles of the regiment 868 men were reported killed, wounded or missing, and it earned by desperate fighting its right to be known as a crack fighting regiment. Casualties The regiment lost a total of 369 men during service; 18 officers and 218 enlisted men killed or mortally wounded, 2 officers and 131 enlisted men died of disease.

The company also said that UnitedHealth had significantly reduced its payments to Team Health for out-of-network services.\\" In August 2019, a Qui Tam lawsuit was filed on behalf of the US Government alleging systemic billing fraud involving Federal and State payor systems.https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20190822f66 In January 2020, TeamHealth acquired the anesthesiology practice operations of Jon. A Harmon, M.D., P.A., for services provided at Brandon Surgery Center. In November 2019, NPR revealed a billing practice of TeamHealth's of suing poor and unfunded patients. https://www.npr.org/sections/health- shots/2019/11/27/783449133/a-private-equity-owned-doctors-group-sued-poor- patients-until-it-came-under-scr In February 2020, TeamHealth announced broad compensation reductions for its providers subsequent to its dispute with United Healthcare that began in August 2019. In February 2020, the Chief United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Rodney Gilstrap, ruled in a False Claims Act case against TeamHealth could proceed and denied TeamHealth's motion to dismiss. In his opinion Judge Gilstrap described \\"two schemes to defraud Medicare and several state Medicaid programs\\" that were intended to increase billing for patient care that did not take place: > 2. The first Scheme is the ‚ÄúMid-Level Scheme.‚Äù Under the Mid-Level Scheme, > TeamHealth overbills for services provided by ‚Äúmid-level‚Äù practitioners. The > term ‚Äúmid-level‚Äù refers to non-physician healthcare providers, such as > Physician Assistants (‚ÄúPAs‚Äù) and Nurse Practitioners (‚ÄúNPs‚Äù). Under Centers > for Medicare and Medicaid Services (‚ÄúCMS‚Äù) rules, a mid-level‚Äôs services are > reimbursed at 85% of the standard physician rate, while services rendered by > a physician are reimbursed at 100% of the standard physician rate. These > rates and percentages are set by CMS, and the Plaintiff States have largely, > if not entirely, adopted these same rates and percentages for reimbursement. > 3. The appropriate rate payable for service rendered to a CMS beneficiary > is automatically triggered by the National Provider Identifier (‚ÄúNPI‚Äù) > submitted with the claim for reimbursement. Services rendered by a mid-level > should be submitted under the mid-level‚Äôs NPI, triggering the 85% rate. > Services rendered by a physician should be submitted under the physician‚Äôs > NPI, triggering the 100% rate. However, as outlined in ¬∂¬∂ 2-7, herein, and > stated with more particularity in ¬ß¬ß V-IV, infra (principally ¬ß V.B), > TeamHealth‚Äîthrough its billing policies, procedures, and protocols (which > include training and guidelines), and through its coordinated operation and > influence over its subsidiaries and affiliated professional > entities‚Äîsystematically submits claims for mid-level services under various > physicians‚Äô NPIs (as assigning charts to a physician by a midlevel is > usually based on shift assignments and how shifts overlap), triggering the > 100% rate when in fact the 85% rate applied. TeamHealth does this > intentionally and has done so for years. 4. Through its billing policies > and practices, TeamHealth attempts to cover up the Mid-Level Scheme by > characterizing mid-level services as ‚Äúsplit/shared.‚Äù Under CMS rules, > ‚Äúsplit/shared‚Äù services occur when both a mid-level and a physician treat > the same patient during the same visit, such that the services are split or > shared between a mid-level and a physician. When this happens, the mid- > level‚Äôs services may be billed under the physicians‚Äô NPI at 100% of the > physician rate. However, true split/shared visits are exceedingly rare at > TeamHealth facilities‚Äîthey almost never occur. This is because TeamHealth > requires mid-levels to treat patients alone, maximizing mid-levels‚Äô > efficiency and profitability. To cover this up, TeamHealth requires its > healthcare providers to falsify medical records to reflect a split/shared > visit when none actually occurred. 5. TeamHealth accomplishes this cover-up > in two ways. First, TeamHealth requires its mid-levels to indicate on > medical records that a physician was involved in each patient encounter, > when in fact a physician never saw the patient. For example, an August 11, > 2011 email from TeamHealth West mid-level, Chuck Nemejc, indicates that > TeamHealth mid-levels must add supervising physicians to patient charts. For > each patient Relator Whaley saw, TeamHealth instructed him to list as his > supervising physician that physician whose shift most closely paralleled his > shift, whether or not that physician ever saw the patient or had any > interaction with Relator regarding the patient. Relator Whaley complied with > this policy daily while he worked for TeamHealth so that he would not lose > his job. 6. Second, TeamHealth requires on-duty physicians to sign mid- > level medical records, again suggesting that the physician treated the > patient. TeamHealth‚Äôs formal policy (as adopted on October 5, 2011 at the > North Colorado Medical Center Emergency Department) requires that physicians > ‚Äúfor billing purposes‚Ä¶ review and sign all charts forwarded to them within > 48 hours of the encounter, regardless of whether they saw the patient or > not.‚Äù (emphasis added). Relator Dr. Hernandez complied with this policy > daily at every TeamHealth location at which he worked by signing patient > charts regardless of whether he saw the patient or not‚Äîso that he would not > lose his job. The result is a medical record that appears to indicate that a > split/shared visit occurred. TeamHealth then sends these falsified medical > records to a coding and billing employee who ‚Äúrelies‚Äù on the falsified > record to submit claims for reimbursement under the physician‚Äôs NPI. This > results in the mid-level‚Äôs services being reimbursed at 100% of the > physician rate. 7. TeamHealth employs this Scheme through its billing > policies and practices to bill federal and state governments for millions of > dollars for the services concerned. Through the Scheme, TeamHealth has > fraudulently obtained tens of millions of dollars every year since at least > 2011 (the year Relators began working for TeamHealth). Based on information > and belief (and the specific example in ¬∂ 93 infra), TeamHealth began > employing the Scheme much earlier than 2011 and continues to employ the Mid- > Level Scheme today. 8. The second Scheme is the ‚ÄúCritical Care Scheme.‚Äù > This Scheme is a classic upcoding scheme. Under the Critical Care Scheme, > TeamHealth bills CMS for ‚Äúcritical care‚Äù‚Äîthe highest level of emergency > treatment reserved for life-threatening situations‚Äîwhen in fact critical > care services were not rendered and/or were not medically necessary, thereby > submitting false claims through fraudulent billing. For example, in an April > 2014 email from TeamHealth West Associate Medical Director Elisa > Dannemiller, Relator Dr. Hernandez was told, ‚ÄúJust a reminder to keep up the > critical care billing! Abnormal vital signs, ICU admits, blood transfusions, > trauma activations, and IV ggts all warrant critical care. We are still > missing some obvious opportunities‚Ä¶‚Äù However, these situations Dannemiller > lists do not necessarily, and likely do not, require critical care in every > instance because they do not necessarily meet the CMS definition for > ‚Äúcritical care.‚Äù Yet Dannemiller told healthcare providers that all of these > situations warrant critical care every time. Dannemiller also explained in > an October 2, 2013 PowerPoint presentation, ‚Äú[y]ou can bill for critical > care and send the patient home!‚Äù And in an October 26, 2014 email, > Dannemiller imposed critical care billing quotas at 6-12%. 9. Because of > the heightened skill and decision-making critical care requires, CMS > reimburses providers for critical care services at a significantly higher > rate than ordinary emergency services. To capitalize on this up-charge, > TeamHealth requires its providers to (1) meet stated critical care quotas > each month; (2) falsify critical care on patient medical records when the > care they provided did not meet CMS critical care requirements; and/or (3) > perform and chart critical care services when those services were not > medically necessary. Again ‚Äúrelying‚Äù on falsified medical records, > TeamHealth coding and billing employees submit claims for reimbursement for > the critical care services reflected in the patient chart. 10. TeamHealth > employs this Scheme through its billing policies and practices to bill > federal and state governments for millions of dollars for the services > concerned. Through the Critical Care Scheme, TeamHealth has fraudulently > obtained multiple millions of dollars each year since at least 2011 (when > Relators began working for TeamHealth). Based on information and belief, > TeamHealth began the Scheme much earlier than 2011 and continues to employ > the Critical Care Scheme today. 11. TeamHealth is able to conceal these > fraudulent claims because a critical care claim is a ‚Äúpass through‚Äù claim > for billing purposes, meaning there is no front-end auditing of these > charges. For example, the April 2, 2014 TeamHealth Meeting Minutes reveal > the following findings from a meeting regarding charting and billing: > ‚ÄúCritical care billing has tapered to 3% compliance in February. There is > significant variability in billing for those services and continued efforts > are occurring to reach the desired 5-8%. Anything that can be done to > enhance charting to collect more through billing is greatly appreciated and > members noted that this type of charge is a pass through for billing, noting > there is no auditing of these charges.‚Äù (emphasis added). 12. Both of > TeamHealth‚Äôs Schemes clearly violate CMS‚Äôs and the Plaintiff States‚Äô billing > regulations and guidelines. TeamHealth perpetrates both Schemes on a > nationwide basis. For example, evidence of the Mid-Level Scheme on a > nationwide basis is seen in a January 31, 2012 email from a Kansas-based > TeamHealth administrator, Jan Hook, to Relator Dr. Hernandez at the Colorado > TeamHealth facility requiring Relator Dr. Hernandez to co-sign a patient > chart. Further, in a May 24, 2013 email from Gloria Brunette, a TeamHealth > Site Coordinator located in Arizona, Brunette requests ‚ÄúSupporting Physician > Documentation‚Äù for multiple mid-level charts from Relator Dr. Hernandez. And > in a May 6, 2011 email from TeamHealth West‚Äôs California facility employee, > Kathryn E. Moreno, to Relator Whaley and others, Moreno explains that > TeamHealth‚Äôs North Colorado facility will soon implement a new Chart > Documentation system. An example of the nationwide scope of the Critical > Care Scheme is seen in an April 10, 2013 email from a Texas-located > TeamHealth administrator, Kim-Diep Do. In the email, Do encourages > TeamHealth providers to bill critical care and points out the loss of money > (i.e., ‚Äúloss of RVUs‚Äù) when providers fail to bill critical care. 13.

He is best known for his extended walking expeditions in Africa, Asia and Central America. Beginning in December 2013, over the course of nine months he undertook the first ever expedition to walk the entire length of the river Nile from the Nyungwe Forest in Rwanda. The expedition was commissioned as a four-part documentary series for Channel 4 in the UK. He also wrote a Sunday Times bestselling book detailing the expedition, Walking the Nile. In 2015, he walked the length of the Himalayas, from Afghanistan in the west to Bhutan in the east. A year later he walked from the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, where the early Spanish conquistadors landed, to Colombia, a journey of following the spine of Central America, crossing the infamous Dari√©n Gap. His book Walking the Americas became a bestseller in the UK and USA. From 2017 to the spring of 2018 he undertook another two journeys. Russia to Iran followed his early hitchhiking adventures as a student, retracing his steps from the Black Sea to the Caspian, following the Caucasus mountains through the North Caucasian republics, via Azerbaijan, Georgia, Armenia and Iran. In September 2017 he began his most ambitious challenge to date: a full circumnavigation of the Arabian Peninsula: travelling from Syria, through Iraq, the Gulf, crossing part of the Empty Quarter desert in Oman, traversing Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the Holy Land to finish in Lebanon; an expedition totalling . During the course of the journey he was embedded with Iraqi troops fighting ISIS where he witnessed the liberation of Sharqat and also encountered Palestinian guerrillas and Hezbollah operatives. He visited the city of Palmyra which was then under Russian control. This journey was documented in the Discovery series Arabia With Levison Wood. He has also undertaken numerous other overland journeys, including a foot crossing of Madagascar and mountain climbing in Iraq. He documents his journeys through books, documentaries and photography. Life The son of teachers Janice Wood (n√©e Curzon) and Levison Wood Sr. Wood was born on 5 May 1982 at the North Staffordshire Royal Infirmary in Hartshill, Staffordshire, and grew up in nearby Forsbrook. Levison was educated at Painsley Catholic College, before obtaining an honours degree in history at the University of Nottingham. He was commissioned as an officer into the Parachute Regiment on 13 April 2006 where he spent four years, serving in Afghanistan in Helmand, Kandahar and Zabul. Wood was promoted to Captain on 13 October 2008. He left the army in April 2010, took up a career in writing and photography, and has become a bestselling author. He has extensive experience in travel and exploration in over 100 countries and in 2011 was made a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. He is an elected Fellow of the Explorers Club in New York, an Honorary Fellow of CASS Business School and holds an honorary doctorate at Staffordshire University. Wood acts as patron and ambassador for a number of charities including the Tusk Trust, The Glacier Trust and the ABF The Soldiers' Charity. He rejoined the army in 2012, serving as a reservist Major in the 77th Brigade. Overland expeditions The expedition to walk the length of the Nile was inspired by explorers John Hanning Speke, Richard Francis Burton, David Livingstone and Henry Morton Stanley. Wood was accompanied by numerous guides, journalists (including Matthew Power) and friends along the different stages of the route. The expedition was commissioned into a television programme for Channel 4 that aired in January 2015, and Wood detailed the trip in his book Walking the Nile. Power died during the programme from severe heat stroke. Wood was forced to abandon a section in South Sudan due to heavy fighting caused by civil war. In 2015, Wood embarked on another challenge: to walk the length of the Himalayas from Afghanistan to Bhutan, filming a documentary series and writing another book about the experience, which was published in January 2016. Channel 4 broadcast Walking the Americas from January 2017, featuring an expedition from Mexico to Colombia. The channel then broadcast his journey along the Caucasus in the four-episode series From Russia to Iran: Crossing Wild Frontiers. In May 2020, Channel 4 commenced broadcasting Walking with Elephants, where Levison followed the 650-mile migration of elephants across Botswana.Channel 4 - Walking with Elephants Awards Walking the Himalayas was voted \\"Adventure Travel Book of the Year\\" for 2016 at the Edward Stanford Travel Writing Awards.

Late in life and after abandoning communism, he was noted as a local historian in Essen. Life Schmidt was an eager member of Hitlerjugend and served as a soldier on the easternt front during the Second World War. After being taken prisoner of war, he attended a Comintern indoctrination school in the Soviet Union and became a fanatical stalinist prior to his return to Germany. After the war, he joined the Communist Party of Germany, which was banned by the West German government in 1956. In the 1950s, Schmidt was one of the publishers of the newspaper Der Ruhrbote, which supported the then-banned Communist Party. For this reason he was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment for anti-constitutional activities. He served six months and was released on parole. In 1968 he joined the German Communist Party. In the 1970s, he began revisiting his political views and finally came to abandon communism, which he later would describe as the second totalitarian ideology he had succumbed to.

The altarpiece dedicated to the Assumption is in the north transept and has at the centre a tableau depicting Christ's tomb surrounded by the twelve apostles with a statue of the Virgin Mary above it. She is surrounded by angels. In the south transept there is an altarpiece dedicated to Saint Herv√©. The blind saint is being led by his guide Guic'haran and they are accompanied by a wolf. The tableau is surmounted by a statue of the Holy Father. The church has a baptismal font dating to 1612 with a baldachin on six columns. At the top there is a sculpture depicting Saint Michael fighting the dragon surrounded by statues depicting the six virtues. The bell-tower This is built in the Beaumanoir style and dates to 1589. The porch has twelve empty niches inside; outside are three niches with a statue of Christ placed in the central niche. Statuary The oldest statue in the church is a carving in wood of the Virgin Mary with child, which is thought to date from the 15th century. There is also a remarkable pi√©ta thought to be Flemish.

Breton legend recounts that Melor was only seven when his uncle, Riwal, murdered his father, St Miliau or Milio. Riwal also wanted Melor killed but was persuaded not to act by a council of bishops. Riwal decided instead to maim the boy, cutting off his right hand (later replaced by a silver prosthesis) and left foot (replaced with one of bronze). Melor was then sent away to Quimper Abbey to be educated. Here, his metal limbs began to work as if they were natural, and to grow along with him.

Transactions of the International Conference of Orientalists in Japan (TICOJ) 37, 42-57. Most of the texts only survive in Chinese and were key works in the development of the Buddhist meditation practices of Chinese Buddhism. Overview The DhyƒÅna sutras focus on the concrete details of the meditative practice of the Yogacarins of northern Gandhara and Kashmir and were known as masters of Buddhist meditation. Kashmir probably became a center of dhyƒÅna practice due to the efforts of MadhyƒÅntika (Majjhantika), a disciple of ƒÄnanda, who traveled north to practice and teach meditation.Chan, Yiu-wing (2013), An English translation of the Dharmatrta-Dhyna Sutra, PhD thesis, University of Hongkong The five main types of meditation in these sutras are: * anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing), * pa·π≠ik≈´lamanasikƒÅra meditation - mindfulness of the impurities of the body, * loving-kindness maitrƒ´ meditation, * the contemplation on the twelve links of pratƒ´tyasamutpƒÅda, * the contemplation on the Buddha‚Äôs thirty-two Characteristics. In addition some sutras contain instructions on contemplation of the dhƒÅtu-s (elements); contemplation of white bones and fresh corpses; and contemplation of bodhisattvas such as AmitƒÅbha.Ven. Dr. Yuanci, A Study of the Meditation Methods in the DESM and Other Early Chinese Texts , The Buddhist Academy of China. The content of these texts is connected with the Yogacara abhidharma works, especially the AbhidharmamahƒÅvibhƒÅsƒÅ-≈õƒÅstra (MV≈ö, ÈòøÊØóÈÅîÁ£®Â§ßÊØóÂ©ÜÊ≤ôË´ñ), which frequently cites the practices of the early Yogacarins, and the large YogƒÅcƒÅrabh≈´mi-≈õƒÅstra (YB≈ö).Cheung Tsui Lan Liza (2013), Doctrines of Spiritual Praxis from Abhidharma to MahƒÅyƒÅna YogƒÅcƒÅra: With Special Reference to the ≈örƒÅvakabh≈´mi of the YogƒÅcƒÅrabh≈´mi-≈õƒÅstra, PhD dissertation, University of Hong Kong. Though the doctrines in these sutras are mostly in line with early Buddhist orthodoxy, they are the work of Buddhists and translators who also lived and traveled through Central Asia and China, therefore some of them also include Mahayana Buddhist teachings and meditation methods common to the Samadhi sutras. The DhyƒÅna sutras are thus a set of texts which illustrate the evolution of meditation from early Buddhist methods to Mahayana techniques. Sutras such as the Chanfa Yaojie (, compiled in India no later than the third century) contain meditations which are derived from the earlier nikƒÅyas as well as material dealing with the Mahayana bodhisattva ideal Thich Hang Dat, A REAPPRAISAL OF KUMƒÄRAJƒ™VA‚ÄôS ROLE IN MEDIEVAL CHINESE BUDDHISM: AN EXAMINATION OF KUMƒÄRAJƒ™VA‚ÄôS TRANSLATION TEXT ON ‚ÄúTHE ESSENTIAL EXPLANATION OF THE METHOD OF DHYANA‚Äù and Mahayana ≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ teachings.Deleanu, Florin. 1993. ‚ÄúMahƒÅyƒÅnist Elements in Chinese Translations of ≈örƒÅvakayƒÅnist YogƒÅcƒÅrabh≈´mi Texts.‚Äù Translations One of the earliest Chinese translators of meditation summaries was the Parthian meditation master An Shigao (ÂÆâ‰∏ñÈ´ò, 147-168 CE) who worked on various texts including the influential Anban shouyi jing (Sanskrit: ƒÄnƒÅpƒÅnasm·πõti-s≈´tra), or the ‚ÄúMindfulness of Breathing discourse‚Äù.Phra Kiattisak Ponampon Kittipanyo (2014), Mission, Meditation and Miracles: An Shigao in Chinese Tradition, MA thesis, Dunedin, NZ: University of Otago. During the Eastern Han period the foremost meditation technique taught by An Shigao and his school was a form of anapanasati (annabanna ÂÆâÈÇ£Ëà¨ÈÇ£) which remained influential for centuries afterwards. Most of these summaries only survive in Chinese translation and often they are not in their original form but also include later accretions such as commentary work by Chinese translators. The difficulty of working with the Chinese translations is shown by the corrupt nature of the Da Anban shouyi jing, which according to Florin Deleanu \\"gathers together An Shigao's original translation, almost impossible to reconstruct, fragments from An Shigao's own commentary as well as fragments from glosses by Chen Hui, Kang Senghui, Zhi Dun, Daoan, and Xie Fu.\\" A recently discovered manuscript of the Anban Shouyi Jing at Kongo-ji temple (Japan) seems to be an actual An Shigao translation.Huei, Shi Guo (2008). The Textual Formation of the Newly Discovered Anban Shouyi Jing, Chung-Hwa Buddhist Journal 21, 123-143 Other highly influential and widely studied An Shigao meditation treatises by early Chinese Buddhists include the 'Scripture on the Twelve Gates' (Shier men jing) and the 'Canonical Text Concerning the Skandha-s, the DhƒÅtu-s, and the ƒÄyatana-s' (Yin chi ru jing, YCRJ). According to Eric Greene, the Scripture on the twelve gates and its commentary provide some of the most comprehensive information on the practice of early Chinese Meditation (Chan),Greene, Eric (2014). HEALING BREATHS AND ROTTING BONES:ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BUDDHIST AND CHINESE MEDITATION PRACTICES DURING THE EASTERN HANAND THREE KINGDOMS PERIOD, Journal of Chinese Religions 42 (2), 145-184 while Zacchetti concludes in his paper on the YCRJ that this text was considered by An Shigao‚Äôs disciples, Kang Senghui Â∫∑ÂÉßÊúÉ (? - 280 CE) and Chen Hui Èô≥ÊÖß, to be ‚Äúone of their main doctrinal sources‚Äù.Zacchetti, (2002). ‚ÄúAn Early Chinese Translation Corresponding to Chapter 6 of the Pe·π≠akopadesa,‚Äù Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London 65 (1), 76. Another work, the Discourse on the Essential Secrets of Meditation (Taisho 15 no. 613) is one of the oldest texts to be translated into Chinese on the subject of meditation (circa 2nd or 3rd century CE) and therefore was likely to have had an influence on the meditation practices of Tiantai Buddhism and Chan Buddhism. This text belonged to the Buddhist DƒÅr·π£·π≠ƒÅntika school and the first Chinese translation was made by Zhi Qian in the early part of the 3rd century CE. A later important Chinese translator of these texts was KumƒÅrajƒ´va (334‚Äì413 CE) who translated several important meditation sutras by 402. Kumarajiva's translated meditation scriptures such as the Chanfa yaojie (Á¶™Ê≥ïË¶ÅËß£) were widely promoted by his disciple Tao Sheng. A contemporary of Kumarajiviva, Buddhabhadra, a Sarvastivadin from Kapilavastu, translated the Damoduoluo chan jing (DharmatrƒÅta DhyƒÅna s≈´tra), a Sarvastivada DƒÅr·π£·π≠ƒÅntika meditation manual associated with the Indian teachers DharmatrƒÅta and Buddhasena. This text, written in verse, includes orthodox Sarvastivadin meditation techniques such as ƒÅnƒÅpƒÅna-sm·πõti as well as tantric Mahayanist practices such as visualization and ma·πá·∏çala instructions. Hence this work is proof that some later Mahayana meditation practices were derived from techniques developed by Sarvastivada Yogacarins. Taken together, the translations by Kumarajiva and Buddhabhadra of Sarvastivadin meditation manuals laid the groundwork for the practices of Chan Buddhism (Zen) and the works of the Tiantai meditation master Zhiyi.

Eilers from the Max Planck Institute for Microbiology. C. litoralis KT71 is described as a pleomorphic bacterium and has a size of 2 x 0.5 Œºm. When grown in culture, C. litoralis KT71 has a generation time of 4.5 hours and prefers to grow on complex substrates where the sole carbon source is undefined, though it can utilize some sole carbon sources because they are most likely used by the organism for its central metabolism. Classification Phylogeny Congregibacter litoralis KT71 was one of the first cultured members of OM60/NOR5 clade and is part of the aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs (AAnPs), a group of bacteria that include marine and freshwater Gamma- and Alphaproteobacteria. Within the environment, members of the OM60/NOR5 clade are cosmopolitan in ocean environments, but seem to have a greater abundance in euphotic coastal marine areas. In April 2015, C. litoralis KT71 was classified into the newly proposed Order of Cellvibrionales and Family Halieaceae. Within the OM60/NOR5 clade, Congregibacter litoralis KT71 clusters, based on the 16S rRNA gene with the genera Congregibacter, Haliea, Halioglobus, Luminiphilus, and Pseudohaliea. Discovery and Isolation KT71 was first isolated from a surface water sample taken near Helgoland, an island in the North Sea by Eilers et al. in August 1999. To isolate the organism, Eliers et al. used direct plating on complex low- nutrient media called MPM developed by Schut et al. MPM was designed to mimic seawater. However, Eilers et al. modified this to adjust the pH to 7.5 and reduced NH4Cl and KH2PO4 to 50 and 1.5 ŒºM, respectively. Briefly, seawater was plated onto MPM and modified MPM and allowed to grow for 37 days. During the 37 days, colonies were picked and placed into liquid MPM culture. Basic Genomic Information In 2004, C. litoralis KT71 was picked for whole genome sequencing. To sequence the organism, plasmid and fosmid libraries were prepared with insert sizes of 4 and 40 kb. The clonal sequences were sequenced by an Applied Biosystems 3730XL DNA sequencer at the J. Craig Venter Science Foundation Joint Technology Center. From this, it was determined that C. litoralis KT71 had a genome size of 4.35Mbp with a GC content of 57.7%. Moreover, the genome contains 3933 coding genes. KT71's assembled genome was assessed for protein coding regions using the Prokaryotic Genomes Automatic Annotation Pipeline (PGAAP) from the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Once completed, genome annotation of the open reading frames was done with GenDB v2.2 annotation system. Metabolism Congregibacter litoralis KT71 is an aerobic anoxygenic photoheterotroph (AAnPs). In general terms, this means that KT71 is a strict aerobic organism with preference for low-oxygen environments. To find these environments, KT71 uses a flagellum combined with chemotaxis to move towards low-oxygen areas. Though it does contain a complete photosynthesis superoperon, KT71 cannot grow autotrophically. Instead, KT71 uses light for light-dependent cyclic electron transport through its photosystem to generate a proton gradient. To determine the metabolism of KT71, the organism was grown in mineral medium containing: 35.0 g of sea salts, 0.1 g of NH4Cl, 0.05 g of K2HPO4, and 10 ml of a vitamin solution. The mineral medium was then supplemented with various carbon compounds to determine the ability for KT71 to use in its metabolism. From this it was determined that KT71 can grow well with carbon sources such as glutamate, pyruvate, and fatty acids as well as more complex substrates like yeast extract and trypticase peptone. Within its genome, genes, determined from genome annotation, involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, trichloroacetic acid cycle (TCA), citric acid cycle were found which correlated to the metabolism observed in culture. Further, KT71 is unable to use glucose as a sole carbon source, which was supported by genome analysis that showed a lack of glucose metabolism genes. Although the supplementation of inorganic sulfur to media did not promote growth, KT71 does contain sulfur- oxidizing (sox) genes that are uniquely arranged in its genome. It is predicted that the potential use of the sox genes would be in the adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS)/ 3'-Phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) pathway. Importance and Role Importance Though KT71 and other AAnPs can make up over 10% of the bacterioplankonic community in oligotrophic oceans, more recent studies have shown them to be less important in open ocean and more important (over 15%) in eutrophic and mesotrophic coastal ocean regions. Further, though AAnPs have been characterized previously in Alphaproteobacteria, KT71 was the first Gammaproteobacteria AAnP to be isolated and suggest a potential for a second group of AAnPs. KT71 will therefore serve as the model organism for this group to help shed light on the importance of Gammaproteobacteria AAnPs in the coastal environment. Role When grown in pure culture, it was observed under a microscope that KT71 formed aggregates. These formations were supported by genome analysis in which genes coding for Type IV pili as well as extracellular polysaccharide production were found. It was predicted by Fuchs et al. that KT71 uses the polysaccharide formation to help form marine snow. KT71 uses these particles that are high in nutrients as a source of nutrients or live in a commensal relationship with other bacteria that provide the necessary compounds that KT71 uses for substrates.

Its objective is to bring literacy through art to children and empower the youth. It is located in Kathmandu, Nepal. It was established in the year 2014.  Location  It is located northeast of the Durbar Marg street, in Kathmandu. The foundation is situated at the top of a 5-storeyed commercial building in the heart of Kathmandu.  Founder of Children's Art Museum of Nepal  The Founder-president Sneha Shrestha, a graduate of Gettysburg College with a major in studio art and globalization studies, was awarded an Advanced Leaders Fellowship from World Learning. After graduation, she moved to Boston and was hired at Artists for Humanity as the Mentoring Artist in Painting and Education Coordinator. Shrestha‚Äôs grant required a time frame of six months, however, she changed her original plan of renting a space into building a permanent one, making her project sustain longer. As part of the fellowship, her social innovation project was CAMON which aims to \\"encourage children's appreciation of their culture and promotes self-expression through hands-on art experience\\".  Mission  * To establish itself as an institution and resource for art and education in Nepal. * To provide children and youth with creative and educational outlets for expressing themselves. * To include art as part of children‚Äôs education in schools.  Interior Design  The art museum houses two rooms, the Exhibition Room and the Education Room, inside a 1,200 sq. foot rooftop space. The Exhibition Room displays art that were produced in regularly scheduled museum workshops by Nepali students. It also displays art by local artists, international collaborators. The space is used as a miniature art gallery as well as an impromptu workshop. The Education Room houses a mini library and serves as the center of activity or the creativity lab. The room also includes a workshop stocked with art supplies. The rooftop has been crafted into a small living space, called the ‚ÄúCloud‚Äù and is used for artist residency.  Programs/ Activities  According to CAMON's Program Coordinator Pranjali Singh, children explore without direction however, \\"most activities tackle specific social issues\\". Starting 2013, even before the official establishment of the museum, Shrestha and her team conducted various activities under CAMON‚Äôs Community Outreach Program which started in June. Programs include an alphabet workshop where kids are taught to learn and appreciate the uniqueness of the Nepali alphabet, winter art camp and a ‚ÄúWall of Hope‚Äù mural for the Half the Sky Film and Art Festival organized by Human Rights Film Focus Nepal in November. Moreover, the CAM team also known as the CAM crew carried out multitude of creative murals throughout Kathmandu. The volunteers also organized a hand-washing awareness day which involved school-children making a mural at school.  Funds/ Grants  The museum is majorly funded by its Indiegogo campaign which raised $5,795 of its $9,200 goal by the end of October 7, 2013. It is partially funded by a $10, 000 grant received by the founder from the Advanced Leaders Fellowship.

Early life Christodoulou was born in May 1965, in Nicosia, Cyprus. He came to London as a boy in 1974, as his family fled the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. Career He started with a studio flat, and now owns extensive property in the London Docklands through his Yianis Group. Christodoulou owns 100% of Yianis Group, which owns the London hotels Marriott West India Quay and the Canary Riverside Plaza (formerly Four Seasons Canary Wharf). He owns Wool House in London. As of April 2020, his net worth is ¬£1.8 billion, according to the Sunday Times Rich List 2020. The value of Christodoulou's property holdings increased by 25% in the 12 months to April 2019 to ¬£1.5 billion, due to a buoyant London rental market. Personal life Christodoulou lives in Monaco with his wife and four children. He has a $50 million 74m yacht, Zeus, previously owned by Aidan Barclay. Charity  Yianis Christodoulou Foundation  Christodoulou is involved in philanthropic endeavours. Inspired by his own childhood, displaced from his homeland as a child, he founded the Yianis Christodoulou Foundation (YCF), which seeks to support disadvantaged children and their families in the UK and abroad. The charitable foundation has a special focus on poverty alleviation and education. Christodoulou has donated ¬£1 million to the eponymous philanthropy organisation. The property magnate has also hosted high profile fundraising events, such as the 2017 Star Ball at the Hilton Manchester Deansgate where over ¬£1.5 million was raised. In December 2018, Christodoulou's foundation ran a Christmas card competition, with the cash prizes going to a number of Cyprus primary schools for teaching resources and new infrastructure. Covid-19 The Yianis Christodoulou Foundation funded the distribution of free food packages offered to the homes of 355,000 members of the Cypriot community in the UK for the in need, vulnerable and elderly during the COVID-19 pandemic. YCF distributed 6,107 International Workers' Day appreciation energy snack-packs to health professionals and workers across all public hospitals in Cyprus. The eponymous philanthropy organisation also funded 6,000 individual care packs for the NHS staff at The Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel, London. Honours and awards Christodoulou won the Foreign-based Cypriot Entrepreneur of the Year 2013 award from IN Business Magazine. Christodoulou is the president of the Monaco and Cyprus Jubilee Sailing Trust. Controversies Christodoulou's business practices have attracted considerable media attention. The Times notes that \\"his company has been challenged by residents of a luxury development of more than 300 flats who complained they were being charged sky- high service charges and unreasonably high sums for repairs.\\" This is a reference to Canary Riverside, where Christodoulou was stripped of day-to-day management control over the property in October 2016, with a professional court appointee installed to act in the best interests of the site. Leaseholders were able to prove fault against CREM, a subsidiary company, that they had suffered over many years due to poor management of the estate, in particular a lack of transparency surrounding how their money was being used. Tribunal judges found that Marathon Estates, the Christodoulou-appointed managing agent, \\"has been unable to produce accurate financial information on time, including budgets and accounts, has not engaged with leaseholders and has a muddled hierarchy of command.\\" Similar complaints of estate mismanagement by Christodoulou leaseholders at 1 West India Quay have emerged in a Sunday Times feature on the so-called leasehold property scandal. Leaseholders there have taken legal action against Christodoulou over expensive energy bills, raising concerns that they have been subsidising his commercial interest on the site. In May 2014, they won the right to form a recognised residents' association, despite Christodoulou having hired a QC and spent ¬£74,000 in trying to block their efforts. Christodoulou has also been named in parliament, with former MP for Poplar and Limehouse Jim Fitzpatrick claiming that the litigation and threats faced by the court-appointed manager at Canary Riverside are \\"little short of harassment\\". A former secretary of the 1 West India Quay residents' association has been subjected to a defamation threat by Christodoulou's lawyers, as have 100 leaseholders at neighbouring Canary Riverside. In July 2018, his lawyers unsuccessfully sought to prevent the then local MP, Jim Fitzpatrick, from raising the case of Canary Riverside in parliament. It had been claimed that Fitzpatrick's intervention could breach sub judice rules. In April 2020, The Guardian reported that tenants at Somerford Grove, east London, were denied a 20% rent cut, in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic and their allegedly precarious employment situations. The renters are said to have been told by the lettings agent, acting on behalf of the three corporate landlords all ‚Äúmajority owned‚Äù by Christodoulou, that the request was ‚Äúunreasonable‚Äù and ‚Äúunrealistic‚Äù. The agent had suggested that ‚Äúany drop in tenants‚Äô income would be minimised by a reduction in spending on holidays, entertainment, travel, clothes and lunches.‚Äù London mayor Sadiq Khan tweeted: ‚ÄúThis is a prime example of how unrealistic it is to expect landlords & tenants to sort difficulties out amongst themselves,‚Äù and that the story is ‚Äúexactly why‚Äù he is calling on government to ‚Äúintroduce immediate measures to protect tenants who go into arrears‚Äù because of the public health emergency. These tenants were later threatened with legal action by the lettings agent and alleged harassment and surveillance by agent-hired security guards. After continuing to make public statements about the situation, several tenants received eviction notices in August in what Hackney Mayor Philip Glanville called a \\"revenge eviction\\" and \\"a direct response to [the tenants] seeking greater security for themselves and their neighbours at a time of crisis.\\" References 1965 births Living people English billionaires British corporate directors Cypriot billionaires People from Nicosia Cypriot emigrants to England Businesspeople from London Naturalised citizens of the United Kingdom English people of Greek Cypriot descent British expatriates in Monaco Cypriot expatriates in Monaco ","title":"John Christodoulou"},{"id":"46551043","text":"Robert Tod Schimke (October 25, 1932 ‚Äì September 6, 2014) was an American biochemist and cancer researcher. He was born in Spokane, Washington, the son of a dentist and a homemaker. Schimke obtained an undergraduate degree from Stanford University in 1954, and an MD degree in 1958. From 1958 to 1960 he performed internship and residency training at Massachusetts General Hospital. From 1960 to 1966 he served in the Public Health Service at the National Institutes of Health, where he worked on the way dietary changes affect the enzymes controlling the urea cycle in rats. In 1966 he returned to Stanford, where from 1969 to 1972 he was on the board of the Faculty of Pharmacology, and from 1978 to 1982 he was chairman of the Department of Biology. At Stanford he examined the effects of steroid hormones on the synthesis of certain proteins, leading to new techniques in genetic engineering. In 1977, he (and doctoral student Fred Alt) discovered the phenomenon of gene amplification in mammalian cells. This discovery had great importance for cancer research, for example, in understanding the genetic instability of cancer cells and the mechanisms by which cancer cells can resist chemotherapy. The mechanism also found applications in biotechnology, for example in the production of proteins, including erythropoietin, of which he helped to develop a commercial version. Later he studied regulatory mechanisms in the cells, including the regulation of apoptosis. He was a Research Professor of the American Cancer Society and later Professor Emeritus at Stanford. In 1985, he received the Alfred P. Sloan, Jr. Prize for Cancer Research. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was president of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. In 1995, Schimke was injured when a car struck the bicycle he was riding. He recovered, but needed to use a wheelchair for the rest of his life. After the accident, he focused on his art, particularly painting. In 2009, the Stanford School of Medicine recognized his many contributions with the J. E. Wallace Sterling Lifetime Achievement Award.

After being identified in 1913, the site was excavated between 1914 and 1915. It was believed to have been largely destroyed by coastal erosion later on in the century, but investigations carried out in 2015 revealed that the remains of the temple still survive, along with a previously unrecorded megalithic structure nearby. Site Xrobb l-Gƒßaƒ°in Temple had a typical temple plan with two apses and a central niche. It also had a paved court, with its entrance facing the southeast. The temple was built on ground with a steep gradient, and due to this an artificial terrace was built in front of the structure. The earliest remains in the area date back to around 4000 BC, but the temple itself was built between 3600 and 3000 BC, during the ƒ†gantija phase of Maltese prehistory. Excavations and recent history The megalithic site was discovered by Carmelo Rizzo, an architect in the Department of Public Works. Rizzo visited the site together with archaeologist Themistocles Zammit on 10 April 1913. The site was excavated by Zammit and A. V. Laferla between December 1914 and January 1915, revealing the core of a megalithic temple. A second excavation was carried out in May 1915 under the direction of Thomas Ashby, who subsequently produced a brief but detailed report about the site. A clay bowl, some slingstones and a decorated slab which formed part of a niche were retrieved during these excavations and they are now displayed at the National Museum of Archaeology in Valletta. The remains were included on the Antiquities List of 1925. At the time of the 1915 excavations, parts of the temple had been destroyed by coastal erosion and the collapse of the remaining parts of the structure was already imminent. The exact location of the site was lost in subsequent decades, and the ruins were presumed to have been eroded away, being described as a \\"destroyed site\\" in 2002. The exact site of the temple was identified once again by Ruben P. Borg and Reuben Grima after they carried out inspections in the area between 2012 and 2015. Some of the megaliths recorded by Ashby in 1915 were rediscovered, and on 7 February 2015 a number of previously unrecorded megaliths were discovered in a gully. These are probably the remains of another megalithic structure, possibly a monumental retaining wall which lined the gully. However, there is also the possibility that the retaining wall might be of a much later date, having been built using megaliths taken from the temple. In 2017, it was announced that the environment and culture ministries were forming an inter-ministerial committee in order to safeguard the remains of the temple. The remains of the temple are accessible to the public, and they fall within the limits of the Xrobb l-Gƒßaƒ°in Nature Park, which is managed by Nature Trust Malta. However, the area is considered extremely dangerous to visit since it is located at the edge of an undercut cliff face.

Built by proprietor Charles Stovall early in the 19th century, it was the most famous health retreat in South Mississippi during the period, mostly catering to the aristocracy of the region. Planters, politicians, merchants and attorneys alike were drawn from as far away as New Orleans, Louisiana, and Natchez, Mississippi, likely paving the way for the hotel's temporary status as Mississippi state capital in 1821. Unfortunately, a gentleman's disagreement occurring at the hotel ultimately led to two separate dueling incidents, which likely contributed to the decline of the establishment. Beginnings Mineral spring retreats and spas were fashionable in the early 19th century and natural springs were abundant in Marion County, Mississippi due to the Pearl River. Just north of Columbia, Mississippi, Charles Stovall constructed \\"Columbia Springs\\" near the eastern banks of Pearl River and the mouth of Buckhorn Creek. The large wood frame hotel building was three stories high with suites on each floor and verandas overlooking the Pearl River. The interiors were lavishly furnished and finished in fine hardwoods such as mahogany, oak and walnut.History of Marion County, Mississippi, Walsworth Publishing, 1976, page 18. Columbia Springs was advertised as having medicinal properties and promoted good health which attracted seasonal visitors, many of them the most influential in southern antebellum society. Visitors enjoyed more than bathing, they also hunted, fished, played billiards and raced horses. While documentation is scarce, sources suggest that several soldiers of Andrew Jackson's army were sent to the springs to recuperate after the Battle of New Orleans in 1815. In 1826, shortly before Columbia Springs fell into decline, Stovall ran the following advertisement in a Natchez newspaper: > COLUMBIA SPRINGS ‚Äì The public is again respectfully invited to turn its > attention to these celebrated Springs, the waters of which have been found, > by experience, to be efficacious in the preservation of health, and also a > powerful auxiliary for the restoration of that invaluable blessing, to > convalescents from acute diseases. The virtue of these waters, the salubrity > of the atmosphere, and the very extensive and improved style of the > accommodations since last year, will, it is confidently believed, ensure to > the visitants a more desirable retreat than is to be found in this section > of the United States. The mineral qualities of these waters have been tested > by scientific gentlemen, and although the exact proportion of the > ingredients was not accurately established, enough was ascertained to prove > them highly medicinal. The predominant quality of the water is diuretic; the > tonic and aperients qualities are considerable; in short, these waters > promote the different secretions, by imparting tone and vigor to the system. > The Columbia Springs are situated near the bank of Pearl River, about two > miles from the town of Columbia, and sixty-five miles from Covington, > surrounded by a country remarkable for its health and the salubrity of its > atmosphere.

Temporary capital of Mississippi Charles Stovall served as a state representative in 1822 and through this term of office forged relationships with the powerful and influential in the region, beneficial to his resort business. When the Mississippi legislature met in Natchez for its fourth session in February, 1821, the site of the permanent capital of Mississippi had yet to be established. As a compromise between the delegates it was voted to temporarily move the capital to Columbia, Mississippi until a permanent site could later be agreed upon. The move was passed on January 1, 1821 and recorded in Section 1 of the Mississippi Journal of the House of Representatives: \\"Section I. Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the State of Mississippi in General Assembly convened, that after the adjournment of the present session of the General Assembly of this State, each ensuing session of the Legislature of this state shall be held at the town of Columbia, until otherwise altered by law.Journal of the Mississippi House of Representatives, January 1, 1821: Chapter LXXIX, \\"an act for the removal of the seat of government,\\" Section 1.\\" Charles Stovall offered an entire wing of his hotel to the legislature for their use, which was accepted. The next regular session of the Mississippi Legislature was held in Columbia in November, 1821, and during this session Mississippi Governor George Poindexter's term expired. Subsequently, Governor Walter Leake was sworn in at Columbia Springs as Mississippi's third governor. Governor Poindexter's legal code, commonly known as \\"Poindexter's Code,\\" was passed during the session, much of it written and finalized while at Columbia Springs. The issue of the permanent site for the state capital was again discussed, and it was decided to appoint Thomas Hinds, William Lattimore and James Patton to select a permanent seat for Mississippi government, eventually settling on what is today Jackson, Mississippi. The close of the fifth legislative session on January 7, 1822 marked the end of Columbia Springs as the temporary capital of Mississippi. Dueling incidents During the summer of 1826, Mississippi Attorney General Richard Stockton, son of a signer of the Declaration of Independence, was vacationing at Columbia Springs. Among others visiting that summer were the Payson family, merchants from New Orleans. One night at a formal dinner, Stockton and Payson had a disagreement with one another. As tempers flared, both men drew pistols on one another until a bystander defused the situation. Emotions festered for several days until a challenge was made for the men to settle their differences by fighting code duello.Elias Safford, esquire, New Orleans Times Picayune, 1880. Ross and Gibbs Almost simultaneously, another argument ensued between two other men at the hotel, one named Ross and the other Gibbs. These two men, one a planter and the other a Jefferson County attorney, fought a duel in 1826 near Grand Gulf, Mississippi, on the west bank of the river. Both parties selected muskets for their weapons, and at first fire, both men fell mortally wounded. One man died after only a few hours while the other lingered for months. Richard Stockton was present when the Ross/Gibbs duel was fought in the capacity of a surgeon.Biographical and Historical Memoirs of Mississippi: Embracing an Authentic and Comprehensive Account of the Chief Events in the History of the State and a Record of the Lives of Many of the Most Worthy and Illustrious Families and Individuals. Goodspeed Publishing, 1891. Stockton and Payson Richard Stockton and Payson met in New Orleans in early 1827 to fight their duel. Using pistols, at first fire Stockton was struck in the head by Payson's ball, and Payson left the dueling field without injury. Stockton had left a note in his pocket which stated that he felt his \\"own conduct had been rash and wrong from the beginning\\" and it was his intention upon surviving the first fire to acknowledge his error and make amends with Payson. A New Orleans newspaper published on February 4, 1827 mentions the duel between Stockton and Payson and reported of the death of Stockton. It also refers to Payson as a \\"Bostonian.\\" By 1830, Payson had accidentally drowned in the Mississippi River. In his 1876 History of Hancock County, Mississippi, congressman John Frances Hamtramck Claiborne made reference to the Stockton and Payson duel and stated that Stockton had been shot in the heart; \\"Richard Stockton resided in Natchez, was from New Jersey, son of one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, graduated at the head of his class at Princeton, began a brilliant career in Mississippi, was attorney general I believe, quarreled with a New Orleans gentleman at Stovall's Springs, in Marion County, and in the duel that followed, was shot through the heart.John Frances Hamtramck Claiborne, Historical Account of Hancock County and the Sea Board of Mississippi, Hopkin's Printing, 1876.\\" Decline Although neither the Ross and Gibbs nor the Stockton and Payson duels were fought at Columbia Springs, these tragic events were rooted there and tarnished the reputation of Columbia Springs enough that it never recovered. At least one source states that the hotel closed immediately after the duels and never reopened. The ruins of the hotel and outbuildings may have still been standing by 1891 when a writer then commented; \\"scarcely a vestige of the hotel now remains.Robert Lowry, William McCardle, A History of Mississippi: From the Discovery of the Great River by Hernando, including the Earliest Settlements Made by the French under Iberville, to the Death of Jefferson Davis, 1891, page 532.\\" Eventually the main building as well as the service buildings were dismantled. Poetry The serenity of the springs proved inspirational to those who visited and vacationed there during its prime. At least one unknown poet was inspired to pen the following epic poem while at the springs, which was first published in the Louisiana Advertiser, October 7, 1826. Written in the port folio of a Gentleman at the Columbia Springs, of Charles Stovall esq. on Pearl river, Mississippi, in 1826.Louisiana Advertiser, October 7, 1826. In this retired sequestered scene, Where Dryads sport in mantles green; Far from the noisy maddening throng; The minstrel wakes his sylvan song. What chastened beauties strike the eye As flood and field commingling lie; And verdant groves or flowery dell, Where peace and pleasure love to dwell? With circling course, Pearl pours his flood, Through sunny glades and forests rude; While glistening with the orient day, Around his chrystal waters play. And thus his gentle ode has run, Since time his annual course begun; And thus shall pour his lucid wave To where old Ocean's billows lave; 'Till time shall cease his swift career, And man and being disappear; Immersed in the unfathomed sea, Of boundless, vast eternity. Now on his bank, lo beauty's form. With soul enshrined, and feelings warm, Delights the sparkling wave to trace, And catch each wild surrounding grace; O'er the clear tide behold her bend; While Naiads on her steps attend; And in the Mirror of the stream Sees all her blushing beauties beam; The rosy cheek, the sparkling eye; The lips where Loves in ambush lie; The snow white neck, the clustering hair, Each valued charm reflected there: Proud she exalts with conscious power And reigns the sovereign of the hour. Or haply in some pensive mood, She pauses o'er the chrystal flood. And views its circling current sweep, In constant journey, to the deep; Emblem of man, whose ceaseless wave Is rolled to that dark gulf, the grave! When starry evening pours her ray, And mellows all the landscape gay; These bowers so formed by nature's care, Receive the constant, plighted pair, Whose hearts are one, by feeling blent; Whose souls (entwined each ligament) Have breathed that vow which, heard on high, E'en angels witness in the sky:- Elate with joy, with rapture warm, They gather every passing charm; And o'er the future, spread each flower Which hope can cull from fancy's bower; And fondly view their years bestrewed With roseate bliss and halcyon good. Ah! Reckless they what griefs assail, When bleak misfortune blows her gale:- Affections crushed by wasting Death, The eye bedimmed, and gasped the breath; Beauty's bright form to dust returned, And life's fond hopes with her enurned; A solitary mourner's tread Is heard o'er mansions of the dead; The sad spectator of mankind, Who lives without one joy behind. But see, a gayer scene inspires, Where love illumes his brightest fires; And keener points his polished dart, To carry captive all the heart. The ballroom mopes, and high the blaze Of radiant beauty, strikes the gaze: Soft music floats upon the air, And woman's charms shine doubly fair; The dancer's steps drawn cut with art, Their gay mysterious joys impart; And mingling in the magic maze, Each fair her brightest power displays;- Now treading, to melodious sounds, The blithe cotillion's graceful rounds; Now, in the measured contra dance, Shoots from her eye the thrilling glance, Or, in the reel's fantastic measures Trips the gay paths of sprightly pleasure; While strains enamored breathe the sigh, That magic chord of sympathy. No wanton waltz shall here intrude, With manners low and action rude- Columbia's fair detest the art, When siren song pollutes the heart; And wakes its wild lascivious charms To give to vice alluring forms. With dimpled cheek, and laughing eye, Their brightest gem is modesty. Such are the scenes which, here awhile, Shed o'er my lot joy's roseate smile; As on the banks of Pearl I stray, And laughing pass the hours away: Here in these cool secluded shades, These verdant lawns and sylvan glades; How pleasure's beams, with brightening ray, Illumine all the live long day; And yield each bliss, whose charms impart Their soothing solace to the heart Friends I have found, but late made known, Friends whom my feelings fondly own; Beauty's high charms, and woman's worth; All-all have poured their brilliance forth; And wit and talents have bestrewed Their flowrets on my solitude. These dreams are o'er; again my way, Is far from Pleasure's fading ray: The tumult of the world I seek, Its halcyon sky, or tempest bleak; Alike prepared with purposed mind, Its sunshine or its storm to find. Then farewell Pearl, and friends adieu, My destined path is far from you: Yet oft in memory's bright array. Will throng the hours while here I stray; And oft in dreams the heart shall trace, Friendship's loved forms and Beauty's grace.

Historical periods  Historians distinguish at least three periods in the history of the Catholic church in Belize. The first period saw missionaries accompany Spanish conquistadores among the Mayas in western Belize, from 1524 until 1707 when such activity drew to a close. A century later separate incursions into the central, southern, and northern parts of the territory led to the first permanent residency of the Jesuits in Belize, in 1851. This marks the beginning of the second period which saw the rapid spread of mission churches throughout Belize. The third period began with appointment of the first native bishop, thus handing over to the native, diocesan clergy administration of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Belize City- Belmopan.  Missionary ventures: 1524 to 1851  300px 1524 to 1707 Friars accompanied the earliest Spanish expeditions into Central America, in accordance with the Patronato system and its intermingling of politics and religion. While the Spanish pursued the false hope of finding gold in Peten, Guatemala, the missionaries accompanied them south from Yucatan, Mexico, and north from Cob√°n, Guatemala. Scattered physical and documentary evidence of friars among the Maya in Western Belize exists for the period 1524 to 1707.Waddell, D.A.G.

Near the Maya site at Xunantunich in west central Belize lies Tipu with the remains of a primitive church building, mentioned in Spanish records, and a large number of Maya skeletons around its confines.Dobson, N. A History of Belize (London: Longman Group, 1973), p. 46. Tipu ceased to exist as a Maya/Christian settlement in 1707 when the Spanish moved its residents to the shores of Lake Pet√©n Itza. Sixty miles to the north of Tipu lies Lamanai (Indian Church) with the remaining stone walls of a missionary church and the ruins of a second church. Maya rebellions were frequent since the system of reducciones‚Äîgathering the scattered Maya into Spanish-controlled villages‚Äîmeant paying taxes and loss of freedom.Thompson, J.E.S. The Rise and Fall of Maya Civilization, 2nd ed. (Norman,Oklahoma: University of Oklahoma Press, 1966). The South witnessed the only recorded martyrdom of missionaries in Belize: in 1684 at Paliac (Rio Grande, Toledo) three Franciscans and some Spaniards were martyred, presumably a sacrificial offering following the Maya method of ripping out the heart. But it was usually the political rather than the Christianizing effort that provoked Maya resistance. Missionaries who resumed the evangelizing effort over 100 years later would attest to remnants of Christian belief. 1830 to 1851 Around 1830 Catholic priests reappear in the historical record of Belize.‚ÄúArmstrong to WMMS‚Äù (November 19, 1830) in Johnson, W.R. A history of Christianity in Belize: 1776-1838. (Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 1985). Mestizos had come as refugees from Honduras to Mullins River south of Belize Town. Fray Antonio worked among them from 1832 to 1836 when he was replaced by Fray Rubio from Bacalar in Yucatan. Rubio built in Mullins River in 1837 the first Catholic church in modern Belize.The Angelus. (September 1894). Retrieved at Roman Catholic Diocese of Belize archives. Then in 1840, Frs. Sandoval and Rivas from Yucatan built a chapel in Belize Town. This had been the coastal center of the British logging industry in the central part of the colony since the late 18th century. The town was served by Anglican, Baptist, and Methodist ministers but Spanish merchants from Yucatan, along with mestizos and Garifuna from the South, would enlarge the Catholic community in the mid-19th century. A large migration of Garifuna had come up the coast from Honduras in 1832, to what became Punta Gorda and Dangriga in the south of Belize. Their ancestry, of African and Carib Indian mix, traces to Saint Vincent. There they rebelled against the British in 1797 and were expelled to Roat√°n, from which they spread along the Honduran coast. By the 19th century they were settling along the southern coastline of Belize. They had been catechized by Spanish priests while on St. Vincent, as evidenced in ‚Äúmakeshift beads and crosses to ward off evil and danger.\\"Johnson, W.R. A history of Christianity in Belize: 1776-1838. (Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 1985), p. 185. They would be sought after by the British as strong warriors and sturdy workers.Shoman, A. 13 chapters of a history of Belize (4th ed.). (Belize: The Angelus Press, 1994), p. 78. But it was as good students and educators that they impacted Catholicism in Belize, with several priests and the first native bishop coming from their number. The Holy Family Sisters would come in 1898 specifically to minister to Garifuna communities, and within a century 45 Belizeans had joined these sisters.Behrens, S.F. (January 2013) \\"The New Orleans Sisters of the Holy Family.\\" Edward T. Brett (review). The Catholic Historical Review. 99(1): pp. 185-187. doi: 10.1353/2913.0061. Jesuit H. Gillett & Icaiche c.1890 The third and largest migration to Belize followed the Caste War of Yucatan when Santa Cruz Maya drove out mestizos from the coast. Between 1847 and 1855 thousands of mestizos fled from Bacalar to Belize, enlarging Corozal and Orange Walk towns. By 1850 there were 7,000 Catholics in the territory, mostly Spanish and mestizo refugees of the Caste War in Yucatan. These mestizos also settled alongside the Icaiche Maya in the northern forests, with gradual movement down the western high ground, above the coastal swamps. In the West, the township of Benque Viejo del Carmen was followed after some years by El Cayo whose population grew from the timber industry that had moved west along the Belize River. Missionary contacts with the Santa Cruz, Icaiche, and mestizos are mentioned in several of the \\"Letters and Notices\\" of the English Province of Jesuits who would arrive in 1851.\\"Letters and Notices,\\" English Province of Jesuits, Volume 7, letter from Fr. Bavastro in 1866, retrieved at  Jesuit mission: 1851 to 1983  Holy Redeemer parish complex In 1837 the Catholic mission office in Rome made Jamaica a vicariate responsible for the whole Caribbean area. With few resources spread over this vast region, little attention was given to the territory of Belize until Catholics of Spanish ancestry were driven from Yucatan to northern Belize during their strife with the Maya (1847-1901). After this influx of Catholics, in 1851, Belize was made a Jesuit mission under the care of the English Province of the Jesuits, eleven years before it became the crown colony of British Honduras. In December 1851 the vicar apostolic from Jamaica, along with his successor in 1855, Jesuit Fr. James Eustace Du Peyron, travelled to Belize to assess the situation. Du Peyron would oversee the building of the first Catholic church in Belize Town for what is today Holy Redeemer parish. The great fire of July 17, 1856, destroyed the north side of town including the church building. By April 1858 the present Holy Redeemer Cathedral building was completed. Other parishes followed along the coastline: Corozal (1859), with a large population of mestizo Catholics; Punta Gorda (1862) with Garifuna on the coast and Maya inland; and Stann Creek (1867) mostly Garifuna. Between 1852 and 1893, 58 Jesuits from 10 countries came to establish these churches: from Italy (18), England (14), Spain (11), Belgian (5), France (3), Ireland (3), Germany (1), Greece (1), Guatemala (1), Columbia (1).Woods, Charles M. Sr., et al. Years of Grace: The History of Roman Catholic Evangelization in Belize: 1524-2014. (Belize: Roman Catholic Diocese of Belize City-Belmopan, 2015). In 1888 British Honduras became a prefecture and in 1893 a vicariate with Salvatore di Pietro, S.J., as prefect apostolic and then vicar apostolic with the title of bishop. The presence of three American bishops for his consecration evidenced the growing importance of the United States to the mission. In 1894 the Jesuits transferred responsibility for British Honduras from the English Province to the Missouri Province of the central United States. Bishop di Pietro died in 1898 and was succeeded by Bishop Frederick C. Hopkins, S.J., the last of the English Jesuits in Belize. St. John's College at Loyola Park, 1917 Permanent parishes among the Maya in west central Belize were begun in Benque Viejo (1905) and San Ignacio (1909). St. John's College, founded at the cathedral in 1887, was moved to Loyola Park in 1917. In 1923 Bishop Hopkins along with two Pallottine sisters drowned when the boat they were taking to Corozal sank. St. John's College after 1931 hurricaneBishop Joseph Anthony Murphy, S.J., succeeded Hopkins. His tenure was marked by a rebuilding effort following the hurricane of 1931, that destroyed St. John's College at Loyola Park and took an estimated 2500 lives including eleven Jesuits. He also built Holy Redeemer Hall which became the premier indoor facility for large events in Belize, until the construction of Bliss Institute in 1954. In 1938 at the age of 80 Bishop Murphy retired and Bishop William A. Rice, S.J., succeeded him. Rice died of a heart attack in 1946. Next came the last vicar apostolic of Belize, David Francis Hickey, S.J., who would become first bishop of the Diocese of Belize when it was raised from vicariate status in 1956. In 1957 he resigned and Bishop Robert Louis Hodapp, S.J., replaced him. Hodapp remained in office for 25 years, attending all five sessions of the Second Vatican Council and working toward its implementation in the diocese. He resigned in 1983.  Native clergy and laity: since 1983  In 1982 Fr. Osmond Peter Martin, from the Garifuna people, became the first native Belizean to be raised to the episcopacy. He became auxiliary to Hodapp and then in 1983 bishop of the diocese. Martin summoned the first diocesan synod in 1989, focused on activating the laity to take ownership of their church. In April 2001 he inaugurated at the cathedral the Monsignor Facundo Castillo Diocesan Center, home to the diocesan radio, television, and newspaper ministries. Dorick M. Wright became auxiliary in 2002 and succeeded Martin in 2007. Due to Wright's failing eyesight, in 2012 Christopher Glancy was named auxiliary and assumed many of the responsibilities of the diocese. The number of Catholics in Belize had grown by 16,414 or 15% since 1991, while total population had grown by 131,723 or 70% in the same period. The number of Belizeans entering the diocesan priesthood was six from the 1930s through 1950s, then peaked with eleven in the 1960s through 1980s, but from then to 2014 had fallen to three. In 2013 Bishop Wright opened a minor seminary, St. Benedict's Diocesan Seminary, in the facility built by the Benedictines near Santa Elena. Four young men constituted its first class. Bishop Lawrence Sydney Nicasio took office on May 13, 2017. Bishop Emeritus Dorick McGowan Wright died on April 15, 2020.  Religious congregations   Jesuits  Jesuits working in Belize c.2008 The Jesuits (S.J.) were responsible for establishing a permanent Catholic presence in Belize beginning in 1851, as detailed above. From then until 2015, 374 Jesuits worked in Belize, founding most of the parishes and missions. They also founded Trinidad Farm Retreat Center near Belize City. In 2015 they remained as pastors at St.Martin de Porres parish in Belize City and at the largely Garifuna St. Peter Claver parish in Punta Gorda, with its 30 Maya mission stations and schools. In June 1885 Jesuit Henry Gillett began publication of The Angelus, ‚Äúa Catholic monthly periodical ‚Ä¶ written partly in English and partly in Spanish, ‚Ä¶ [intended] to refute error and to give people correct information about Catholic affairs.‚Äù\\"British Honduras.\\"(1898) The Angelus (Roman Catholic Diocese of Belize City-Belmopan Archives:Belize Vicariate), p. 379. It included substantial documentation, as in Fr. Hopkins's 1851-1893 ‚ÄúHistorical Sketch of the Catholic Mission in Belize‚Äù published in 1897. The Angelus ceased publication in 1905. The current Catholic monthly The Christian Herald began publication in September 1979 under Jesuit Fr. Maher, who also initiated the diocesan radio and television apostolates. St. John's College (SJC), which \\"would become one of the largest and most prestigious educational institutions in the country,\\" was founded by Fr. Cassian Gillett, S.J., in 1887,Jesuit Archives, Belize Collection in quarters on the cathedral grounds. It moved to a spacious Loyola Park campus south of town in 1917 where it served as a boarding school for many who would become leaders in Belize and throughout Central America. The hurricane of 1931 destroyed the Loyola Park campus (see above), taking the lives of 6 priests, 1 brother, and 4 scholastics. SJC then returned to the cathedral grounds until 1952 when it moved to a spacious campus northwest of town. It now has 20 buildings to accommodate its secondary and junior college divisions, and an additional extension division in town. In the late 1890s celebrated Jesuit naturalist William A. Stanton taught at St. John's College. The influence of Jesuit education on Belizean politics is covered under \\"Apostolic works\\" below, along with their part in initiating credit unions and cooperatives in Belize. The Boy Scout movement in Belize was introduced by Brother \\"Jake\\" Jacoby in Holy Redeemer parish during his long tenure in Belize, 1928 to 1957.  Sisters of Mercy  In 1883 the Sisters of Mercy (R.S.M.) came to Belize and established a lasting presence. Since then 156 of their number have worked in Belize. Bishops di Pietro and Hopkins did much to secure their services and then to arrange for their separate foundation in Belize, independent of the motherhouse in New Orleans. On coming to Belize, the sisters assumed the task of running Holy Redeemer Primary School that by the early 1900s enrolled nearly 400 students. Their three-storey brick convent and school building, built in 1885, was destroyed by the 1931 hurricane. It was rebuilt in 1935 along with an elementary school and St. Catherine Academy which continues to educate girls in the Belize City area. On the same campus is Our Lady of Guadalupe Mercy Center, which accommodated 1600 persons in 2014 for retreats and other programs. Since 1967 the Mercies have managed Muffles College in Orange Walk Town. They also inaugurated Belmopan Comprehensive School in 1970, Mercy clinic in 1981, and Mercy Kitchen in 1986. Together with a Sister of Charity of Nazareth they founded a clinic for Mayan women in rural Toledo in 1964. In 2012 Sr. M. Caritas Lawrence, R.S.M., an educator, liturgical translator from Mayan to English, and senior officer in the Ministry of Education, was awarded the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth for her life's work.  Holy Family Sisters  The Holy Family Sisters (S.S.F.), an African-American congregation from New Orleans, arrived in 1898 to manage the small parochial school in Dangriga. By 2000, 95 had served in Belize, of whom 19 were native Belizeans. They founded Austin High School for Girls, since amalgamated, and Delille Academy in Dangriga, and also have charge of two grade schools. There have been 27 Belizeans who joined the congregation and served only abroad.  The Pallottines  Pallottine Sisters Pallotti High School Arriving in 1913, the Pallottines (S.A.C.) established convents in Benque Viejo and Corozal, and later throughout Belize. By 2001, 162 had served in Belize, of whom 69 were native Belizeans. In 1931 they built a large novitiate near Punta Gorda, from which they minister in 30 Maya villages that have Catholic chapels and schools. In 1957 they opened Pallotti High School for girls in Belize City (at right). In 1968 Belize became an independent province of their congregation. In 2013 their century of service was commemorated by a Belizean stamp.  Sisters of Charity of Nazareth  In 1975 the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth (S.C.N.) were called to assist at Sacred Heart Parish in Dangriga and then to foster lay ministry in the spirit of renewal in the Catholic church. From 1975 to 2014, 22 had worked in Belize, of whom 4 were Belizean. In 2014 Sr. Barbara Flores, S.C.N., was the President/General Manager of Catholic Public Schools.  Madrecitas (Our Lady of the Light)  In 1975 these religious sisters began coming four at a time from Mexico and realizing their charism of evangelizing in remote villages, first in Orange Walk District then also in Corozal District. In 1979 they opened a convent in San Juan Village, Corozal. By 2000, 22 had worked in Belize, of whom 11 were Belizean.  Guadalupanas and Dominican Sisters  The Guadalupana sisters from M√©rida, Yucatan, worked in lay ministry at St. Francis Xavier Parish in Corozal during the 1970s and early 1980s. From 1985 to 1994 six Sisters of the Dominican Order from Springfield, Kentucky, also served in Belize.  Society of Our Lady of the Most Holy Trinity  The Society of Our Lady of the Most Holy Trinity (SOLT) includes both lay and religious, men and women. Its mission to Belize began in the late 1960s in Benque Viejo in the areas of health care and pastoring. This expanded into managing schools and teaching at the secondary level. Then in 1976 Deacon Cal Cathers of SOLT founded BRC Printing Limited to print primarily reading and math textbooks for schools. In 1990 SOLT founded Mt. Carmel High School in Benque, staffed largely by foreign volunteers, and also opened Divine Mercy Church in Belize City. In 1998, John Marhevka of SOLT founded a Catholic bookstore and radio station in Benque. In 2005, he built a media center and radio station in Belize City and in 2010 Power FM Catholic Youth Radio began broadcasting, to which was added Radio Guadalupe Catholic Radio Station in 2013. By 2014, 20 members had served in Belize for extended periods of time.  The Benedictines  In 1971, the Benedictine monks (O.S.B.) from Subiaco Abbey (Arkansas) established a monastery near Santa Elena, Belize. By 1999, 23 Benedictines had served in Belize, but the monastery was then closed for lack of numbers. The fine buildings and property were bequeathed to the Diocese and in 2013 re-opened as St. Benedict Diocesan Seminary.  The Viatorians  The Viatorians (C.S.V.) came to Xavier Parish in Corozal in 1998. They organized teacher training workshops, especially for catechists. They assumed responsibility for and expanded the high school in Chunox, Corozal District, enlarging its departments in agriculture, science, computers, and home economics. After much consultation, they implemented a pastoral plan that would unify the parish with its many missions. In May 2012 Fr. Christopher Glancy, C.S.V., who had guided Xavier parish in Corozal through much of its renewal, was called to the episcopacy to assist Bishop Dorick M. Wright whose eyesight was failing.Rodriguez, P., \\"We ordain a new Bishop,\\" The Christian Herald, May 2012, pp. 2,4. In 2014, after supplying 11 members for its work in Belize and realizing one Belizean member's ordination, they could no longer supply men and withdrew from Belize.  Columbans and Claretians  Coming in 1986, 15 Columbans served at St. Ignatius, St. Vianney, and Ladyville around Belize City as well as in Dangriga, leaving in 1999. Four Claretians also served in Dangriga, between 2002 and 2014.  Apostolic works   Independence movement  Price and Peace Corps volunteer Edward J.

Class members included future political and People's United Party leaders George Cadle Price, Philip Goldson, Herman Jex, John Albert Smith, Leigh Richardson, and Nick Pollard Sr. Price, popularly known as the \\"Father of the Nation,\\" led Belize through its independence movement, holding the top office in the country for a cumulative 27 years. Price‚Äôs authorized biographer observes that Price had great respect for the Jesuits, and his policies based on social justice are easily traced to Quadragesimo anno.

Credit unions and cooperatives  Fr. Ulrich's scale Marion M. Ganey, S.J., was largely responsible for introducing cooperatives and credit unions to Belize beginning in 1943, in response to Pius XI‚Äôs social encyclical Quadragesimo anno. Within 10 years of the first credit union, the colony had 22 credit unions and the ‚Äúvarious cooperatives embraced consumer, marketing, housing, hog, chicle, and farmers co- operatives.‚Äù\\"I‚Äôll take the high road\\".

William Ulrich gave the Maya of San Antonio village a scale for weighing their hogs, protecting them from sharkers who grossly underestimated the weight. From increased revenue the villagers bought a truck to carry their hogs and other produce to market, and a hog cooperative was formed. Ulrich's action also impacted village politics. By encouraging ‚Äúthe election of younger and more progressive men to the Alcalde‚Äôs Council which had been set up by Fr.

The credit union movement included Jesuit Henry Sutti, the first priest to come out of Boys Town, Nebraska, and in 1943 founder of the Holy Redeemer Credit Union, which in 2009 was capitalized at Bz$322.7 million with 42,262 members. Since 1956, the Director of the Credit union has been Jane Ellen Usher.  Schools  From the 1850s laws were enacted in British Honduras so that by the end of the century the church-state system of education was well established, with payment by results, for the benefit of every denomination of Christians.Bennett, J.A. A history of education in Belize. The Angelus Press, 2008, p. 21. But the problem of finding qualified teachers persisted. From the late 1940s prospective teachers among Catholic young men were hosted in a teachers‚Äô hostel on New Road in Belize City, to return to their villages as teachers. This lasted until the building was destroyed by hurricane Hattie in 1961. By then several future government ministers and Fr. Calistus Cayetano had received their education through this program. In 1957 Fr. John Stochl introduced a high school equivalency program for adults in the downtown Extension Division of SJC. The first government secondary school, Technical High School, did not open until 1952. In 1954 the Diocese established St. John's Teacher Training College at Holy Redeemer. In 1965, it was amalgamated with the government's St. George's Teachers‚Äô College to become Belize Teachers‚Äô College. At that time total enrollment at five church-run schools in Belize City was 815 students; of these, 589 were in primary school and 226 were in secondary school.Young, C.N. Language and education in Belize, 3rd. ed., 2002. Belize: The Angelus Press, p. 41. In 1961 two more Catholic secondary schools were opened: St. Francis Xavier in Corozal and St. Peter Claver in Punta Gorda. In 1953 an agricultural branch of St. John's College, called Lynam College, was opened in Stann Creek on land lent by the government. The college operated until 1971 when lack of funding and criticism that it was not fulfilling its function as an agricultural school caused its closing.Interview 2002: Charles Woods Sr. with Fr. Leo Weber, SJ, mission superior in 1971. After the hjurricane of 1931, St.John's College returned to the cathedral grounds until 1952 when it moved to a spacious campus northwest of town. It now has 20 buildings to accommodate its secondary and junior college divisions. St. John's Junior College grew out of the Sixth Form (1952) that was connected to the high school (1887). In 1966 it began offering associate degrees in affiliation with the American Association of Community Colleges. Two more Catholic junior colleges were founded in the 1990s. Muffles Junior College near Orange Walk Town was opened in 1992. It grew out of Muffles High School that originated in 1953. And Sacred Heart Junior College in San Ignacio Town was opened in 1999. It grew out of Sacred Heart High School which was the first secondary school in Cayo District when it opened in 1960. Seminarians from nearby St. Benedict's attend Sacred Heart Junior College. By 2015 the Catholic church had 148 elementary schools, attached to all of its 18 parishes and to most all of its mission stations, along with 11 high schools and 3 junior colleges. Not until 1986 did the government found a university independent of church control. There have been efforts to detach education from the British A-level system and associate it more closely to the American system of accreditation, but the Chamber of Commerce and Rotary business people resisted. Pallottine Communion class in Benque Sir Alan Burns, Governor of British Honduras (1934-1939), used Benque Viejo as an example of one challenge that teaching in Belizean schools presents: ‚ÄúI have heard German nuns trying to teach Maya children out of an English textbook which they had to explain in Spanish.‚ÄùRuiz, David N., ‚ÄúOn visit of Mother Holisz & Provincials of the Pallottine Order,‚Äù March 6, 1999, pp. 3-10. Retrieved at Roman Catholic Diocesan Archives. The solution, in higher education at least, has been to require English in the classroom. The Garifuna have enculturated the Catholic Mass and have it in their own language. As regards the Kriol language which most speak in Belize City there has been more controversy. Several Christian churches have introduced Kriol into their services and a Kriol New Testament has been produced. But the Catholic Mass, requiring approval from Roman authorities, has not been translated into Kriol. On the other hand, Catholics are deeply involved in the Kriol Council, and St. John's College through its Belize Institute for Social Research and Action (BISRA) publishes Belizean Studies which carries articles on the role of Kriol and other cultures in Belizean Society.\\"The Future of Belizean Creole,\\" Belizean Studies: A Journal of Social Research and Thought, 1974, Vol. 2, No. 3. In 1970 Ms. Signa Yorke was the first layperson appointed dean of sixth form at the Jesuit-run St. John's College. Then the by-laws of the college were rewritten so that the Jesuit superior for Belize was no longer automatically president of the college and lay members were added to the board of trustees. Mr. Stuart Simmons was appointed the first lay principal of the high school division. In 1994 the by-laws were again changed so that a lay person could be president of the college, and in 1999 Mr. Carlos Perdomo became the first lay president. The chairperson of the board had already for many years been a layperson. Over 25 years the transition to lay leadership was effected, while efforts were made to assure the continuing presence of the Jesuit charism in the college. At St. Catherine Academy Mrs. Alice Castillo became the first lay principal in 1997. Prominent graduates. Zee Edgell attended St. Catherine Academy and is author of the award-winning novel Beka Lamb. Those attending some division of St. John's College and prominent in government service include Emil Arguelles, Johnny Brice√±o, Jorge Espat, Manuel Esquivel, Francis Fonseca, Ralph Fonseca, Caritas Lawrence, Zenaida Moya, Said Musa, George Cadle Price.

Following three false starts during the ten years after the American Civil War, the railway was launched in July 1874. Work was completed on the valley-to-coast road in 1884. The line is today operated by Portland and Western Railroad. History Background The Willamette Valley (in green) includes the bulk of Oregon's population. The Willamette Valley & Coast route approximates the red road line running from Newport to Corvallis. From the earliest days in which surplus agricultural production existed in Oregon's Willamette Valley, producers desired a transportation system to allow their output to reach outside market through ocean ports. The size and fruitfulness of the valley seemed vast, including as it did some 3 million acres of land, of which 1 million was well adapted to grain production. The valley's mild climate and fertile soil made commercial production of other crops practicable, if only transportation difficulties could be resolved. The early settlers of Benton County, Oregon were proactive in seeking to create such a railway line across the Coast Mountain Range running from the county seat of Corvallis to the Pacific port at Yaquina Bay, part of today's Newport through a natural gap in the mountains near Mary's Peak. A trail first established by Native American peoples followed the route, used as well by the European American pioneer settlers who followed them. Commercialization of the path began in 1863 with the organization of a toll road company called the Wagon Road Company, headed by local doctor J. R. Bayley, to construct and maintain a wagon road through the gap. This toll road company's ranks were expanded in 1865 with additional investors. On August 15, 1867, Articles of Incorporation were filed for a new entity called the Willamette Valley and Coast Railroad Company, with a group of 14 Benton County citizens listed as incorporators. This initial group failed to construct a railroad and gave way in October 1871 to a second company which included J. R. Bayley, Ben Simpson, and A. B. Meacham. This second group similarly failed to construct a railroad, although Messrs. Bayley and Simpson would soon return for the third iteration of the WV&C; Railroad Company. In 1871 members of the Wagon Road Company, taking advantage of a liberal land grant policy, filed for grants from the United States government which claimed staggered land sections running for six miles on either section of the road, thereby locking up the valuable path for future development and exploitation. On October 14, 1872, a third Willamette Valley and Coast Railroad Company was established, with principals including J. R. Bayley and Ben Simpson from the second iteration of the firm, together with Colonel T. Egenton Hogg. The company listed as its objective the construction of a narrow gauge rail line from Yaquina Bay to a junction with the Oregon and California Railroad line in Linn County, located just to the east of Benton County. For the third time, this effort to construct a valley-to-coast railway line in Western Oregon was stillborn. Launch A fourth attempt to form a railway company came in July 1874, with G. W. Houck heading a group of 16 Benton County investors. This group successfully obtained a charter from the Oregon legislature which defined the methods by which bonds could be issued in an effort to oversee the firm's financial practices. As a means of subsidy, the railroad company was granted title to all tidal lands in Benton County and was to be exempted from all taxation for 20 years. In return, the WV&C; consented to transport all troops and war materiel for the state of Oregon for the same 20-year period of time. The legislature insisted that before this charter and its associated subsidies was made real, the company must first build 10 miles of its line. This distance was surveyed, running from Corvallis to the neighboring town of Philomath along the Marys River and local citizens turned out to grade the path of the line by hand. With the first ten miles flattened and rocked, a search was initiated for investors. With no financial angels visible, Col. Hogg proposed that $35,000 be raised locally, this being deemed the minimum sum necessary to purchase iron rails for the 10 miles of track and a small locomotive to aid in the construction. This amount was duly raised and the ten miles of line built, but this exhausted the funds and patience of the community. Contributing to the disruption was the ongoing Long Depression of 1873-1879, which erased potential sources of speculative investment. Work on the WV&C; came to an abrupt halt. External funds at last became available by the summer of 1881 and in July Col. Hogg set the wheels in motion for construction of the line through to Yaquina Bay. It was also planned for the line to extend eastwards as far as Boise, Idaho at the appropriate juncture in the future. Sawmills were put into operation at various points along the proposed rail line and in August and September hundreds of Chinese coolies began to arrive in Corvallis in anticipation of working on the WV&C; project. A parallel construction company called the Oregon Pacific Company, with Hogg serving as President of both firms, was established to coordinate work on the WV&C; project. Construction Some 2,000 men and about 250 horses were set to work on the construction in summer 1881, with about 13 miles on the eastern end completed by the time the fall rains had arrived in force. The rainy season proved harsh and reduced the work site to a sea of mud, forcing shutdown of all but tunnel-drilling and lumber operations. Further disruption was offered by the Depression of 1882, which made the raising of additional investment capital difficult. Hogg raised the necessary funds, however, enabling work to continue. The source of said funds remained a mystery, with one contemporary historian noting: > \\"No information was ever given by Colonel Hogg as to who were the chief > supporters of the Oregon Pacific ‚Äî but as one name after another was > disclosed by circumstances, it was found that he had enlisted some of the > wealthiest and most conservative of American capitalists...\\" The state's charter with the WV&C; called for completion of the Corvallis-to- Yaquina Bay route by October 14, 1884, but the line was not to be finished until the second week of December of that year, with plans made for a ceremony to drive the final spike in the line about 15 miles outside of Corvallis on the Marys River near a place called Harris' Mill. Just as preparations were being made for a Final Spike ceremony to be attended by Governor Z. F. Moody and other political worthies from around the state, a massive snowstorm hit the region, putting a rare 24 inches of powder on the ground, which subsequently thawed and refroze, coating everything with a blanket of ice and disabling the engines. Nearly 2,500 men remained stranded along the route, unable to be supplied with food by trail or rail. General Manager William M. Hoag, himself stranded along the line, managed to break through the ice and snow for a distance of nearly 20 miles to reach Corvallis, where relief efforts were organized. Sledges containing necessary supplies were hauled by men pulling on foot. A few days later, horse-drawn sleds were dispatched and the supply emergency came to an end. It was with scant ceremony that the final spike was at last driven at 3 pm on December 31, 1884, by William Hoag. The weather disaster led to false reports and rumors about failure of the project in the East, generating a cash flow crisis that made timely payment of railway workers for their last three months of work impossible. A near riot erupted and a strike was organized, culminating in April 1885 when in an act of sabotage the timbering of a tunnel was set on fire and burned out, effectively shutting down the railroad for months. An infusion of money into the company followed, creditors were paid off, and on July 4, 1885, the trains began running again. Yaquina City The WV&C; Railroad's track came to an end several miles upriver from today's Newport at a hastily contrived terminus called \\"Yaquina City.\\" Instead of reaching Yaquina Bay at Newport, a new \\"city\\" was created several miles upriver called Yaquina City. Envisioned as a hub of trade, the small loading dock that served as the terminal point of the WV&C; proved to be economically unsuccessful and quickly atrophied. The site of Yaquina City is now entirely abandoned, with few traces remaining. Railroad today The remaining stretch line constructed by the Willamette Valley and Coast Railroad, running between Corvallis and Toledo, is today part of the Portland and Western Railroad. In 1909 the Oregon legislature repealed a law giving the WV&C; title to the overflowed and tidal lands adjoining the Alsea River, Siletz River, and Yaquina Bay.

The types of investment are residential investment in housing that will provide a flow of housing services over an extended time, non-residential fixed investment in things such as new machinery or factories, human capital investment in workforce education, and inventory investment (the accumulation, intentional or unintentional, of goods inventories). In measures of national income and output, \\"gross investment\\" (represented by the variable ) is a component of gross domestic product (), given in the formula , where is consumption, is government spending, and is net exports, given by the difference between the exports and imports, . Thus investment is everything that remains of total expenditure after consumption, government spending, and net exports are subtracted (i.e. ). \\"Net investment\\" deducts depreciation from gross investment. Net fixed investment is the value of the net increase in the capital stock per year. Fixed investment, as expenditure over a period of time (e.g., \\"per year\\"), is not capital but rather leads to changes in the amount of capital. The time dimension of investment makes it a flow. By contrast, capital is a stock‚Äîthat is, accumulated net investment up to a point in time. Determinants Investment is often modeled as a function of income and interest rates, given by the relation , with the interest rate negatively affecting investment because it is the cost of acquiring funds with which to purchase investment goods, and with income positively affecting investment because higher income signals greater opportunities to sell the goods that physical capital can produce. In some research, investment is modeled as an increasing function of Tobin's q, which is the ratio between a physical asset's market value and its replacement value. If, for example, this ratio is greater than 1, machinery can be bought at one price and then generate output worth the larger amount that is reflected in its market value, giving positive economic profit. In some research, investment is modeled as an increasing function of the gap between the optimal capital stock and the current capital stock. Here the optimal capital stock is modeled as that which maximizes profit.

Feenstra, 450 U.S. 455 (1981), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held a Louisiana Head and Master law, which gave sole control of marital property to the husband, unconstitutional.  Background  In 1974, Joan Feenstra charged her husband Harold had molested their daughter. Harold hired an attorney, Karl Kirchberg, to defend himself against the charges, and mortgaged the Feenstras' home toward paying the cost of that attorney. Joan was not informed of this mortgage because Head and Master provisions of Louisiana law allowed him to do so without her consent or knowledge. She dropped the charges, and the couple separated. Joan did not learn about the mortgage until 1976, when Harold's attorney returned to demand payment and threatened foreclosure. She then filed a lawsuit arguing that Louisiana's laws giving sole control of marital property to the husband were unconstitutional. The district court upheld Louisiana's law. On appeal, the Fifth Circuit overturned the district court, finding the law unconstitutionally violated the Equal Protection Clause, but limited the application of their ruling to future decisions. Feenstra appealed to the Supreme Court.Opinion of the Court at Justia  Opinion of the Court  Applying intermediate scrutiny as they had in Craig v. Boren, the court held that Louisiana's law lacked an \\"exceedingly persuasive justification\\" for its sex-based classification, and therefore was in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Marriage today is not what it was under the common law tradition, under the civil law tradition. Marriage was a relationship of a dominant male to a subordinate female.

Currently the women's water polo team participates in Serie A1; the male, after the promotion in 2013, are recorded in Serie A2. The team colors are yellow and blue, the symbol of a fish.  History  The first edition of the club (A.S.D. Rapallo Nuoto) was founded in Rapallo on November 30, 1971. In the early years, due to the lack of swimming facilities in the town of Rapallo, the team was forced to \\"migrate\\" in the nearby ski Camogli, Recco, Bogliasco and Genoa and carry out the necessary training at sea, in the summer, or at the gym in the autumn and winter seasons. The move in the other pools was interrupted in 1975 when the new Olympic pool in Rapallo (located in the hamlet of San Pietro di Novella) was brought to completion and delivered to the company Rapallo Nuoto, which still keeps management. Among the athletes who played in the rapallese men's and women water polo teams there were Marco Formentini, and world champions and Olympic Francesca Christiana Conti and Cinzia Ragusa. In 1994, the Italian National Olympic Committee has awarded the company the \\"Bronze Star for Sporting Merit\\" and in the years 1995-1997-1998-1999-2004-2007 the title \\"Company of the Year\\" by the local section of town Panathlon International. The women's water polo team has played, after promotion in 2006, won by the playoffs against the team Serapo Gaeta, in the Serie A1 league. In the 2010-2011 season the women's team after beating the Dutch sports club Het Ravijn won the LEN Trophy, the first title in its history and the seventh title for Italy from 1999. In the summer of 2011 it is made official the passage of the same team in the ranks of Pro Recco, becoming, in fact, the new \\"pink\\" of the club. The \\"transfer\\" of the former company Rapallo Recco will last, however, only one championship in the summer of 2012, following the resignation of the presidency recchelina Gabriele Volpi and family, the team and the women's title will return to Rapallo. The August 11, 2012 is then re-founded the company rapallese water polo - with the name of Rapallo Pallanuoto  heir of the historic Rapallo Nuoto and continuing the albeit brief period of Pro Recco female. Militant in Serie A1, the new presidency is chaired by Enrico Antonucci and Mario Sinatra in the role of coach and collaborator. In the 2012-2013 season the women's team became champion of Italy, the first title in its history. The men's team of the club, after years of militancy in the championships of Serie B, with victory over Bergamo Alta won in June 2013 the promotion to Series A2. In August 2014, the Under-19 team of Rapallo is Champion of Italy after a final victory against the 'SIS Roma.

Punta Cumplida is the oldest of the four main lighthouses on La Palma, each one being located near to a different cardinal point of the island. Punta Cumplida marks the north-eastern tip; Fuencaliente the southern point, and the two modern lighthouses at Punta Lava and Arenas Blancas, the eastern and western points respectively.  History  The need for a lighthouse on La Palma was included in the first maritime lighting plan for the Canaries produced in 1857, and although the site for the first light was given as Puntagorda on the north western side of the island, subsequent studies determined that it was more convenient to construct a lighthouse on the north east coast instead. The project was given approval in 1861, and the contract was awarded to Jose Rodriguez Gonzalez, a resident of Santa Cruz de la Palma at a cost of just over 500,000 reales. The lighthouse first entered service in 1867, and was built in a similar style to other 19th century Canarian lights, and consists of a whitewashed single storey keeper's house, with dark volcanic rock used for the masonry detailing. A plain masonry tower rises from the side of the house facing the Atlantic Ocean. The cylindrical tower supports two galleries and a lantern dome, which originally contained a second order Fresnel lens. In 1982, the tower was extended by 4 m to its current height of 34 m. Punta Cumplida, was depicted as part of a set of six commemorative stamps by the Spanish postal service Correos in 2010. The five other lighthouses included the Ciutadella Lighthouse of Menorca. The Fresnel lens from the lighthouse which was displayed inside the ferry terminal at the Port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife on Tenerife, returned to La Palma in 2013. It was installed within a specially designed structure of glass and stainless steel, and is now on view at the crossroads in Barlovento. In 2017 it was announced that as part of the Faros de Espa√±a project, the unused keeper's house at the lighthouse would be developed into high quality tourist accommodation. The Port Authority of Santa Cruz de Tenerife will renovate the building adapting it for use as tourist accommodation, but retaining certain areas for equipment needed for the operation of the lighthouse as an aid to navigation.  LED lighting  In 2011 the lighthouse was converted to operate using Light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs, the first lighthouse in Europe to do so. The new lighting system consists of six vertical panels each with four bulbs; these panels are mounted on a rotating hexagonal drum, which reproduces the original light characteristic of one flash every five seconds. Punta Cumplida was chosen for the new system, due to its high electrical consumption, which was reduced significantly by installing the 24 LED lamps. The nominal range of the new system is 24 nautical miles, although it was seen 40 nautical miles away during good atmospheric conditions by a local ferry.

Known for her intricate beadwork, dance regalia, and cultural items, Coser's work has been purchased by the Philbrook and Gilcrease museums in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Early life Born in 1955 in Lawton, Oklahoma, Judy Deer Coser first became interested in beadwork after seeing her great- grandmother‚Äôs regalia, that is, culturally-informed clothing and accessories. Coser's father worked as a leather craftsman, and seeing him work with his hands throughout her childhood inspired Coser to follow in his path. Coser was raised in Shawnee, Oklahoma, and took her first beading class at a church summer camp in Wyandotte, Oklahoma. Education Coser attended a semester at St. Gregory‚Äôs University and Oklahoma City University, but eventually graduated from the University of Oklahoma with a degree in political science. While Coser attended the University of Oklahoma, she partially funded her education through beadwork and sewing. Coser later started a master‚Äôs program at Northeastern State University and then went to the University of New Mexico. In 1989, Coser married George Coser. Style and Notable Works Coser specializes her beadwork in cultural clothing and items, such as pouches and bandolier bags. and beaded collars. Coser first entered her beadwork in competitive juried art shows in 1994. One of the first shows she competed in was the Red Earth Festival. She entered some beaded flaps for a pair of Kickapoo moccasins and was awarded second place. The following year in 1995 she entered the same show and got first place. One of Coser‚Äôs most notable works is an otterskin bag that is currently owned by the Philbrook Museum in Tulsa, OK. Coser and her husband were also very involved with powwows because of their love of dance. They traveled to Wisconsin several times to visit with fellow Great Lakes people. Awards and Achievements One of Coser‚Äôs greatest accomplishments has been finishing a Great Lakes bandolier bag in honor of her maternal great-uncle, who was Sac and Fox. Along with her beadwork and classes in moccasin-making, Coser is regularly asked to share her cultural knowledge with the Native American Student Association in the Glenpool school district. Her work has been purchased by the Philbrook and Gilcrease museums in Tulsa as well as the Creek Council House Museum. Coser‚Äôs work has been featured in Oklahoma Today and the Tulsa World. In 2011, her artwork was also featured in the film The Cherokee Word for Water. Earlier in 2004, both Judy and her husband George were Tulsa Sister City representatives to Celle, Germany, where they demonstrated powwow dancing. In 2012, George and Judy were named Native American Elders of the Year by the Oklahoma AARP.

Plot Bright Morning is a young girl who is part of the Navajo tribe. As a Navajo woman, her mother was the owner of a large flock of sheep since shepherding is part of the Navajo way of life. With her black dog in tow, Bright Morning takes the flock to the High Mesas so they can feed on new grass. Her friends White Deer and Running Bird always join her. One day, Bright Morning and her friend Running Bird are caught by men who they later realize are Spaniards. The leader of the Spaniards, \\"the one with white teeth\\", as Bright Morning describes him, is a slave catcher that has made a deal with a Se√±ora in a small town. The Se√±ora has a 12-year old maid named Rosita, who was also brought by the leader of the Spaniards. Running Bird and Bright Morning are sold separately. Although the Se√±ora treats her kindly, Bright Morning is miserable and plans to escape. One day, Rosita and Bright Morning go to town for an Easter Celebration. Here she meets Nehana, an Indian girl who is part of the Nez Perce tribe. Nehana tells Bright Morning where Running Bird is and that they will escape soon. Later, Bright Morning, Nehana, and Running Bird attempt their plan. However, the Spaniards catch up. Luckily, Bright Morning's future husband Tall Boy is there with Mando and his men. After a fight against the Spaniards, Tall Boy is shot and the leader of the Spaniards is killed. When they reach home, the \\"Long Knives\\" Americans are claiming the land. They threaten the Navajo and force them to leave Canyon De Chelly. The tribe leaves their home and members slowly started dying because of the hazardous conditions. Critical reception Many critics agree that \\"Sing Down the Moon\\" is beautifully written with simplicity and intensity, making it book of the year claimed by The New York Times. The Horn Book said that the book is the depiction of the triumph of the human spirit. The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books wrote \\"The very simplicity of O'Dell's writing, at times almost terse, makes more vivid the tragedy of the eviction and the danger and triumph of the return\\". Book World- The Washington Post also acknowledges the beautiful writing and adds that it is immensely moving and is a memorable reading experience for any age. Shirley Nelson, a reviewer for children's literature, called this short novel a heart-wrenching story of the Long Walk of 1863 through 1865, seen through the eyes of the young Navajo woman, Bright Morning.

He sat briefly in the Irish House of Commons and was then appointed a justice of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland). In his own lifetime his lack of legal learning was proverbial, but on the other hand he was universally esteemed as a kindly and humane man. In the nineteenth century his principal claim to fame lay in his being the father of Thomas Kelly junior, a prolific writer of hymns and founder of a breakaway Protestant sect.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol. 11 p.220 Early life He was born at Fidane, in County Galway, third son of Edmond Kelly, or O'Kelly, a minor landowner, and Margery Bourke. His family were traditionally Roman Catholic, but Thomas from political necessity became a member of the Church of Ireland, as Catholics were then barred by the Penal Laws from entering the legal profession. He entered the Middle Temple in 1747 and was called to the Bar in 1753; he is said then to have spent some years in the West Indies.Ball p.167 On his return to Ireland he began his legal practice on the Connacht circuit, where sat as an extra judge of assize; he became King's Counsel in 1767 and Prime Serjeant in 1782. Political and judicial career He entered politics: he was a close friend and strong supporter of Henry Grattan and sat briefly as MP for Portarlington in 1783. His support for the cause of full independence for the Parliament of Ireland made him very popular. It seems to have been his popularity, rather than any great legal expertise, which enabled him to become one of the most successful barristers of his time, and this in turn led to his gaining a seat on the Bench in 1783, and on the Privy Council of Ireland. Reputation Kelly as a judge proved to be something of an embarrassment to the Government which had appointed him. His problem, according to his colleague on the Bench, the memoirist Sir Jonah Barrington, was that his great popularity as a barrister was entirely unrelated to his legal abilities, which were mediocre at best, and he was appointed to the Bench due to a quite unjustified belief in his legal learning. Barrington records a story of Kelly, who had decided a point of law wrongly twice, expressing the hope that he could get the law right the third time.Barrington, Jonah Historic Memoirs London 1833 Vol.1 p.268 Nonetheless he retained his great popularity, having the reputation of being a kindly and humane judge, with a sense of humour, and a notable reluctance, unusual at the time, to impose the death penalty. Henry Grattan called him the most honourable and humane judge he ever knew. Barrington's low opinion of Kelly as a judge was fully shared by the English- born politician Edward Cooke, always a stern critic of the Irish judiciary: he wrote that \\"Kelly has been most unfortunate in his judgments: (there is) scarcely one upon a dubious point which has not been set aside.\\"Ball pp. 166-7 Death He had a town house in Dublin and a country seat, Kellyville (formerly Derrinroe), near Ballintubbert, County Laois, which he purchased around 1777, and substantially rebuilt. He retired in 1801: by some accounts he resigned in protest against the passing of the Act of Union 1800, which destroyed the independent Irish Parliament to which Kelly was devoted. He died in Dublin in 1809. Family He married Frances Hickie, daughter of James Jephson Hickie of Carrick-on-Suir and his second wife Anne Salisbury Jephson. They had three daughters, Annabella, who married Sir George Pigott, first of the Pigott baronets, Harriet, who married Sir Richard Bligh St George, the second of the St George baronets, and Charlotte, and one son, Thomas Kelly (1769‚Äì1855).

A flood has destroyed the only bridge so communications with the village are cut. This event mobilised the whole community, which started to work tirelessly in order to reconstruct the bridge.

The theatre was named after the Illinois town where the father of one of its actors, Jack Wallace, worked. Pyskacek allowed Harry Hoch and a partner to use the Kingston Mines name for a small eatery/caf√© in the front of the building.

The attack is thought to have targeted Croat civilians and policemen as retribution against the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), which had fought Bosniak forces for control of the city during the Croat‚ÄìBosniak War. The attack was organized by Ahmad Zuhair Handala, with his associates, Ali Ahmed Ali Hamad from Bahrain, Nebil Ali Hil, nicknamed Abu Yemen, Saleh Nedal and Vlado Popovski from the Republic of Macedonia. At least two of the arrested had links to Al-Qaeda. The attackers did not mention that whether the bombing was religiously motivated or whether it was retribution against the Croatian Defense Council.  History  On 18 September 1997, a car bomb exploded on Splitska Street, in front of a police station in majority-Croat western Mostar. During the Bosnian War, the building had housed the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia. Twenty-nine people were either seriously or lightly wounded in the attack, including three police officers. The explosion created a crater wide and deep. In total, 120 apartments sustained some level of damage, of which 56 were completely destroyed. About 120 vehicles were also affected, including 46 that were completely destroyed. NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR) peacekeepers were the first to arrive at the scene. An investigation commenced the following day, and was carried out by the criminal police of the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton with help from experts from Zagreb and Split. Immediately after the attack, domestic and foreign security agencies began searching for the perpetrators. Bosniak politicians, including prime minister Haris Silajd≈æiƒá and media outlets accused the Croats of carrying out the attack. As it occurred shortly after the Croat and Bosniak city police forces were united, and after the Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina (HDZ BiH) secured victory at the general elections, SFOR suspected three possible motives. In their opinion, it was either politically motivated and designed to sabotage the re-unification of the city's police force; mafia-related; or carried out by Islamic extremists with the goal of creating as many casualties and causing as much damage as possible. SFOR considered the latter hypothesis the least likely of the three, as it expected that a terrorist group would have taken responsibility immediately after such an attack. These doubts were soon dispelled. Handala's name was made public by the leader of the Wahhabi community in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Alu Husin Imad, known as Abu Hamza. Abu Hamza told reporters that \\"[the Wahhabist community] doesn't justify, but understands the crime\\". Handala and his associates apparently carried out the attack as a retribution to the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), which had fought the predominantly Muslim Bosniaks during the war.  Arrests and trial  In September 1998, Italian attorneys issued an international warrant for a group of criminals suspected of multiple crimes in Italy, including terrorist acts. Among the group was Saleh Nedal. He was arrested in Travnik in April 1999. Investigating judge Mirjana Grube≈°iƒá and district attorney Marinko Jurƒçeviƒá, both Croats, asked the County Court in Travnik to comply with the Italian request to extradite Saleh but the court, presided by Senad Begoviƒá, a Bosniak, ruled against Saleh's extradition in July 1999. The same judge later signed a decree which terminated Saleh's imprisonment. The Supreme Court of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, presided by judge Nazif Sulman, a Bosniak, affirmed the decree in August 1999. Saleh later warned Zuhair, who fled Bosnia before the start of his trial on 18 September 1998. During the police investigation, Ali Ahmed Ali Hamad admitted committing the crime and made the same admission before the investigating judge. However, he denied any involvement at the trial, stating that the police had coerced him by promising a quick trial followed by his release. He was not charged with terrorism, but for constructing a car bomb, a criminal act which endangered the general safety and as a result all the accused received lighter sentences. Zuhair was tried in absentia and sentenced to ten-years in prison, while Ali Hamad received eight- and Nebil Ali Hil five-years in prison. Handala was eventually arrested after the September 11 attacks, and in 2007 was being detained in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.

Unveiled on 28 April 2015 and first released in South Korea on 29 April 2015 and widely released in June 2015, as the successor to 2014's G3. The G4 is primarily an evolution of the G3, with revisions to its overall design, display and camera. The G4 received mixed to positive reviews; while praising the G4's display quality, camera, and overall performance, critics characterized the G4 as being a robust device that did not contain enough substantial changes or innovation over its predecessor to make the device stand out against its major competitors, but could appeal to power users needing a smartphone with expandable storage and a removable battery due to the exclusion of these features from its main competitor on launch, the Samsung Galaxy S6. The device also became the subject of criticism due to instances of hardware failure caused by manufacturing defects, deemed \\"bootloops\\", which culminated in a class-action lawsuit filed in March 2017. Specifications Hardware The LG G4 Display = Design = The design of the G4 is an evolution of the G3, maintaining elements such as its rear-located volume and camera buttons. Several back cover options are available, including plastic covers with a diamond pattern and plastic covers coated in leather, stitched down the middle. Six leather color options are available. = Display, chipsets, battery = The G4 features a , 1440p \\"Quantum IPS\\" display, which LG stated would provide better contrast, color accuracy and energy efficiency over another display that LG did not explicitly specify. The G4 utilizes a hexa-core Snapdragon 808 with 3 GB of RAM, consisting of four low-power Cortex-A53 cores and two Cortex-A57 cores. The G4 includes a removable 3000 mAh battery and supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 technology with a compatible AC adapter, which is not included. The G4 comes with 32GB of storage with the option to expand the amount of available storage with a microSD card up to 2 TB in size. = Camera = The rear-facing camera has a 16-megapixel sensor with a f/1.8 aperture lens, infrared active autofocus, three-axis optical image stabilization, and LED flash. A \\"RGB color spectrum sensor\\" is located below the flash, which analyzes ambient lighting to optimize the white balance and flash color to generate more natural-looking images. The front-facing camera is 8-megapixels with an aperture of f/2.0. While main camera is able to record video at 2160p (4K) with 30fps and 720p (HD) with 120fps, 1080p (Full HD) is unconventionally limited to 30fps, rather than 60fps, as from competing mobile phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S6, the HTC One M9 and the iPhone 6. Software The G4 is supplied with Android 5.1 \\"Lollipop\\", although the overall user experience is relatively similar to that of the G3. The camera software was upgraded with raw image support, along with a new manual mode offering the ability to adjust the focus, shutter speed, ISO and white balance. Optionally, a photo can be taken automatically by double-clicking the lower volume button when the screen is off. The \\"Glance View\\" feature allows users to view notifications when the display is off by dragging down. On October 14, 2015, LG announced that the G4 would be upgraded to Android 6.0 \\"Marshmallow\\", with its release beginning in Poland the following week. followed by releases in other European countries, South Korea, and in the U.S. on Sprint. It enables new features such as \\"Google Now on Tap\\", which allows users to perform searches within the context of information currently being displayed on-screen, and \\"Doze\\", which optimizes battery usage when the device is not being physically handled. By February 2016, it had reached wider distribution, such as in Canada. Android 7.0 \\"Nougat\\" became available for selected models in July 2017. Reception The G4 was met with mixed to positive reception from critics. The Verge felt that the G4 could appeal to power users alienated by the removal of expandable storage and replaceable batteries on the then-recently released Samsung Galaxy S6. The display was praised for its improved color accuracy and energy efficiency over the G3, remarking that it was \\"as good, if not better\\", than the S6. The G4's rear camera was praised for its quality and color reproduction, along with its \\"comprehensive\\" manual mode and its \\"uncommon\\" ability to save raw images, but it was noted that its autofocus sometimes missed focus or took long to achieve focus, and that the manual mode did not offer saturation or sharpness controls. LG's software was criticized for being relatively unchanged from the G3, and for suffering from feature creep and \\"ugly\\" aesthetics. The G4 given a 7.9 out of 10, concluding that it \\"actually functions just fine ‚Äî but you're not going to see it in the hands of every person at the state fair this summer.\\" The performance of the LG G4 was contrasted to devices that utilize Qualcomm's Snapdragon 810 (such as the LG G Flex 2), which was known to have overheating problems. Ars Technica felt that the need to throttle CPU- intensive tasks to prevent overheating had a negative effect on the 810's performance, arguing that as a result, the G4's Snapdragon 808 performed better in some cases than the 810 (represented in comparison testing by the HTC One M9), but that the Exynos processor of the Galaxy S6 had better overall performance than the two Snapdragon chips on benchmarks. Considering its camera to be the best part of the device, Ars Technica concluded that the G4 was \\"a perfectly competent smartphone, but doesn't really stand out much.\\" Technical problems =Touchscreen problems= Some users reported inconsistencies in the performance of the G4's touchscreen, with some units‚Äîparticularly U.S. T-Mobile and Verizon variants‚Äîhaving problems registering quick taps and swipes. LG released an update to fix the problem in its keyboard app in June 2015, followed by Verizon releasing a major OTA update in November 2015 to fix the touchscreen problems and address other problems with the device. =\\"Bootloop\\" hardware failure= In January 2016, LG confirmed that some G4 units had a manufacturing defect that eventually caused them to enter an unrecoverable reboot loop, resulting from \\"loose contact between components\\". The company stated that it would repair or replace affected devices under warranty at no charge. In March 2017, a class- action lawsuit was filed against LG Electronics in the U.S. state of California, alleging that despite acknowledging its existence, LG continued to produce units of the G4 and its sister model, the V10, with the defect, and distributed phones that could succumb to the defects as warranty replacements. The lawsuit stated that LG did not recall or \\"offer an adequate remedy to consumers\\" who bought the two models, nor provide any remedy for devices that fell outside of the one-year warranty period. The lawsuit was never certified as a class action, and was sent to arbitration. In January 2018, LG agreed to pay the participants in the lawsuit a $700 credit towards the purchase of a LG smartphone or $425. Since the lawsuit was not certified as a class action, consumers not actually participating in the lawsuit did not receive any payment.

One London weeklyThe Spectator, 18 October 1879. wrote admiringly of a poem in Bevington's 1879 Key-Notes, describing it as \\"an exposition of the theory, physical and moral, of Evolution, which she entitles, 'Unto This Present'. If it were nothing else, it would be quite remarkable, as a literary tour de force, for the extraordinary ingenuity and success with which the writer has reduced to verse that never ceases to have a certain smoothness and even harmony, an argument bristling, so to speak, with philosophical terms. But it is more than this. It is a very eloquent and lucid philosophical statement, which, we take it, a scientific teacher would allow to give a clear and well-defined outline of the theory.\\" Another reviewer, however, found that Bevington's style was one for which, \\"in the present condition of the English language, there is no vocabulary, but which exactly corresponds to the peculiar qualities known as 'goodiness,' 'cant,' and 'unctuosity,' when the writer or speaker happens to be content with the faith of his or her fathers. To us the style is equally offensive, whatever may be the opinions of the stylist, and we have rarely come across a more offensive example of it than these Key Notes... [although] in the midst of this come a series of poems on the months, and a few miscellaneous songs which possess great simplicity, melody, and truth.\\"The Examiner, 12 April 1879. More widely read and appreciated were her prose arguments on similar subjects. In an article in The Nineteenth Century in October 1879, entitled \\"Atheism and Morality\\", Bevington took a clear secularist position that provoked a clerical response. In December the same year, Bevington concluded a two-part essay entitled \\"Modern Atheism and Mr. Mallock\\". This reacted to an attack on atheism in the same paper by a young Oxford graduate, by putting forward a spirited defence of secular morality: \\"So far as human life is worth living, so far is it worth protecting. So far as it is not worth living, so far is it needful to ameliorate it. Duty, on secular principles, consists in the summarized conduct conducive to the permanent protection and progressive amelioration of the human lot.... Religion's foster-child, Society, must eventually learn to trust her own two feet of civil and moral law, and run alone.\\"The Nineteenth Century, December 1879, pp. 1001 and 1015.

A further contribution to the debate was prompted by a letter to Bevington from the philosopher Herbert Spencer, pointing out that rationalists showed greater humanity than adherents of organized religion.Letter of 18 May 1881, quoted in David Duncan: The Life and Letters of Herbert Spencer (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2014 [1908]), p. 216.

In 1883 Bevington travelled to Germany, where on 2 May that year she married the artist Ignatz Guggenberger in Munich.'Marriages', Sussex Agricultural Express, 8 May 1883. However, writing under her maiden name in 1888, she complained, \\"The minor and superficial domesticities of the hour are [the German woman's] only field of aspiration; klatsch [gossip] with her feminine acquaintances, or hanging out of window, are the most usual delights of her leisure hours; and even within the province assigned to her she habitually shrinks from the smallest mental departure on her own account....

Anarchist writings Bevington quickly came to know many London anarchists and gain a name as an anarchist poet. This was probably achieved through Charlotte Wilson, who with Peter Kropotkin had founded the anarchist paper Freedom in 1886. However, Bevington rejected the tactics of bombs and dynamite and became associated with another paper, Liberty, edited by the Scottish anarchist and tailor James Tochatti (1852‚Äì1928), for which she wrote numerous articles and poems. She also contributed to The Torch, which was edited by Helen and Olivia Rossetti, nieces of the painter, and in an Anarchist Manifesto distributed in 1895 for the short-lived Anarchist Communist Alliance. She translated an essay on the Paris Commune by Louise Michel, who became a friend. Shortly before her death from dropsy and mitral heart disease on 28 November 1895 at the age of fifty, Bevington wrote further articles for Liberty and published a final collection of poems, of which some were later set to music.British Library Catalogue.

The song depicts the experiences of the character during a road travel across the United States. The song was produced during the recording sessions of his second and last album, Grievous Angel. Parsons sang with the participation of Emmylou Harris backed with the main core of the TCB Band. Background and recording In 1972 Gram Parsons signed a recording contract with Reprise Records. At the time, Parsons saw singer Emmylou Harris performing at a Washington D.C folk club. Parsons hired Harris and the core of Elvis Presley's TCB Band with James Burton (guitar), Ronnie Tutt (drums) and Glenn Hardin (piano) for the recording of his solo debut album, GP. In the spring Parsons formed his road band, The Fallen Angels and started a tour. In the summer of 1973, Gram Parsons' Topanga Canyon home burned to the ground, the result of a stray cigarette. Nearly all of his possessions were destroyed with the fire. Following the incident, Parsons left his wife and moved into a spare room in Phil Kaufman's house. While not recording, he frequently hung out and jammed with country rockers Quacky Duck and His Barnyard Friends. At the time, Parsons took the role of producer and recorded new songs with his road band. He then grouped again the musicians he used for his GP album, and called for a new set of sessions in Los Angeles in the late summer. For the recording of \\"Return of the Grievous Angel\\", Eagles lead guitarist Bernie Leadon joined in, while Al Perkins played steel guitar and Byron Berline the fiddle. Parsons sang the lead, while Harris joined in harmony. Content Parsons was inspired to write a song by Boston poet Tom S. Brown, who gave him his composition entitled \\"Return of the Grievous Angel\\". Brown wrote the lyrics with Parsons on his mind to sing them. Parsons revised the poem and adapted it for the song. Recurrent in Parsons compositions, the themes of the song include instances of wandering, homesickness and experiences with road life. The song depicts a truck traveling through the United States, with the name of the unit being the \\"Grievous Angel\\". The singer tells \\"sweet Annie Rich\\" of his experiences on the journey, and his ultimate decision to return home based on his gained wisdom. It contains references to Presley as \\"the king\\" who wore \\"on his head an amphetamine crown\\" and his change of musical scene to Las Vegas. Parsons states that \\"(he) talked about unbuckling that old bible belt and lighted out for some desert town\\". The music style included a mixture of folk revival and traditional country music. During the musical breaks, the song is led to a temporary harmony and melodic cadence, which progressively is restored to a four-measure phrase. Release \\"Return of the Grievous Angel\\" became the opening song of Parson's second and last album Grievous Angel. In 1982, the song was reissued as a single, featuring \\"Hearts on Fire\\" on the B-side by Warner Bros. Records. Mojo called the song \\"terrifically cinematic\\", a \\"country rock standard\\". BBC Radio stated that the song offered the casual listener \\"an easier way into modern country\\". Allmusic called the song a \\"beautiful and marvelously literate distillation of Parsons' musical style and the myth he created for himself\\". Meanwhile, it praised Brown's writing, determining that \\"(brought) an almost cinematic feel to his broad, sweeping narrative and lending a perspective that's impressionistic while still maintaining a firm grasp of the iconography of classic country music\\". The A.V. Club described its content as \\"surrealistic imagery ... swooning romanticism and playful sincerity that establishes a hypnotically dreamy mood\\". Popmatters felt that the song had \\"the right amount of self- mythologizing to make Parsons seem like his place in the pantheon had always been assured\\". In 1999 it was covered by Lucinda Williams with the participation of David Crosby for Return of the Grievous Angel: A Tribute to Gram Parsons.

Life Jerzy Iwanow-Szajnowicz was born in Warsaw on 14 December 1911, as the son of the Russian army colonel Count Vladimir Ivanov, and a Polish mother. His parents divorced soon after. His mother married a Greek, Ioannis Lambrinidis, and together they emigrated to Thessaloniki in northern Greece in 1926. He became an athlete in the G.S. Iraklis Thessaloniki sport club, and a distinguished swimmer: in 1934, he became Greek champion in 100 m freestyle. After becoming a Polish citizen in 1935, he became part of AZS Warsaw's water polo team and of the Polish national water polo team, and was declared Poland's top water polo player in 1938. Iwanow also graduated from the University of Louvain in agricultural engineering, followed by post-graduate courses at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure d'agriculture coloniale in Paris, before returning to Greece. Statue of Iwanow in Thessaloniki With the outbreak of World War II and the German invasion of Poland, he helped to organize the evacuation of Polish refugees coming to Thessaloniki, and in 1940 was enlisted into Polish intelligence. Fleeing the German invasion of Greece in April 1941, he left the country for the Middle East, to join the exiled Polish forces there. There he was chosen by the Polish and British intelligence services for an undercover mission in Greece. On 13 October 1941, the British submarine brought him to the coast of Attica near Nea Makri. His subsequent activity in the Greek underground was prodigious: apart from establishing an extensive intelligence network for the Allies reporting on the military and political situation in Greece, on the Greek war industry, now used by the Germans, and on ship and railway schedules, he engaged in numerous sabotage missions. He was responsible for the sabotage of the German aircraft motor repair facilities in the Maltsiniotis plant, which is credited with affecting over 400 engines and causing the crash of several German aircraft due to engine malfunctions, as well as the destruction of two German U-boats, U-133 and U-372, sabotaging the latter and forcing it to surface and be sunk by the RAF off Haifa. The first time he was caught by the Gestapo, after being betrayed by one of his associates, Konstantinos Pantos, he managed to escape after three days. The Germans then put a reward on him of 500,000 drachmas. He was finally captured after another betrayal on 8 September 1942, and sentenced by a German tribunal on 2 December to a triple death sentence. He was executed at the Kaisariani shooting range on 4 January 1943. Memory Memorial plaque at the house Iwanow lived in Warsaw On 5 December 1944, Field Marshal Harold Alexander, Allied Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean, sent a diploma of thanks to his mother, while on 30 March 1945, the Polish government in exile honoured Iwanow with the Virtuti Militari cross. On 5 March 1962 he was decorated by the British government for his service with the Polish forces, and on 25 May 1976, he was awarded the highest Greek medal for gallantry, the Cross of Valour in Gold. In 1972, his life was made into a movie in the Polish People's Republic, as Agent Nr. 1.

The Horsecatcher. Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1957. Print (5). Plot The novel is set in the 1830s. Elk, a Southern Cheyenne adolescent, dresses plainly, does not care for ceremonials, has no interest in warfare and coup- counting and little more in hunting. He has undergone his fast, but nobody is quite able to figure out what his dream meant. He knows he is a disappointment to his father, Elk River, to his uncle Owl Friend, who founded a warrior society, and to his older brother Two Wolves. But he cannot help what is in his heart. He wants to be a tamer of wild horses. When we first meet Elk, he has slipped away from his village on a lone horse-hunt, hoping to catch Bear Colt. But despite hardship and deprivation and even almost getting accidentally killed by some of his own tribesmen, he succeeds, and that is worth the shaming he gets from his kin. Over the next two years Elk learns his chosen profession, along with the misunderstandings that come with it. Even when he bravely warns his village of approaching Kiowa raiders and kills one with his rabbit bow, he fails to see his accomplishment. Furthermore, after his brother is killed, along with his entire war party, he helps to save the tribe's great talismans. He then penetrates deep into Kiowa country, alone and afraid, to recover and bury the remains. For a culture that places great value on horses, it is surprising that no one seems ready to recognize what a real contribution he could make to his tribe.

The film explores themes of technology, government repression, greed, and true love. The film was partially funded through the crowdfunding website Kickstarter, and filmed over the summer of 2014. The film was released on April 15, 2016, through video on demand. Premise The film revolves around Aladdin's dysfunctional family, who live in an average American city ruled by a corrupt sultan with a decadent socialite daughter.

Some of the smaller parts were performed by artists doing residencies at the nearby Pioneer Works studio. Green has stated that falling in love with his wife, Yasmin Green, heavily influenced the plot and that wedding vows that Aladdin gives are nearly identical to his own. After completing the project, Green said he had some problems distributing it, with most film festivals finding it too \\"off brand\\". However, after releasing the trailer online, Green started to get offers for screening the film. Vice Media also got in contact with Green after seeing the trailer, asking him to pitch a TV show for their Viceland channel.

Litterscapes Inspired by Road Debris,‚Äù Los Angeles Times, 19 June 1989. The project, created by photographic artists Jerry Burchfield and Mark Chamberlain, was a response to explosive growth in south Orange County and especially to the threats of development within their hometown of Laguna Beach, California. What began as a 10-year project lasted for three decades. Over its first 10 years, the project drew an ever-expanding number of supporters. It empowered local artists and concerned citizens to get actively involved in the fate of the Canyon, while informing the greater Orange County, California about the environmental issues. The project reached its high point in 1989 when, in celebration of the Orange County Centennial and the Sesquicentennial of the discovery of photography, the art partners erected a giant photographic mural in a critical location of the Canyon. They built this 636-foot-long mural, entitled The Tell,Cathy Curtis. \\"The Tell Does Indeed Deliver Its Message of Protest,‚Äù Los Angeles Times, 21 August 1989. in the Sycamore Hills area of Laguna Coast Wilderness Park.Adam Maya. ‚ÄúLaguna Coast Wilderness Park,‚Äù Orange County Register, 23 September 2012.

During their many hours working together, they often discussed what they could do to protect the Laguna Canyon. They ultimately agreed upon a course of action and in the spring of 1980 commenced the \\"Laguna Canyon Project: The Continuous Document,\\" their long-term environmental art project. The immediate goal was to preserve the canyon in the tradition of documentary photography, while challenging the community to preserve it in reality.Richard Chang. ‚ÄúCapturing the Canyon: The Story of ‚ÄòThe Tell‚Äô,‚Äù Laguna Beach Magazine, November 2015. For Phase I of the project, with a handful of volunteers, they photographed both sides of the Laguna Canyon Road. The resulting 646 frames per side were printed into twin color prints, depicting their passage down the ‚Äúlast nine miles of the westward migration.‚Äù Evolution to performance art Soon after, they repeated the survey, but this time at night, and dubbed it Phase III, \\"Nightlight Documentation.‚Äù Publicity from these ventures was beginning to generate responses from people offering to help with future phases. The partners also realized that the project's phases were turning into performance art, in addition to documentation. The next phase was to ‚Äúpaint the canyon with light.‚Äù This phase took two years of planning, required more people, expensive equipment, and permits from multiple level governmental agencies. The pair lobbied regional environmental groups, the art community, and local public officials for permission and support. In September 1983, Chamberlain and Burchfield executed Phase V, \\"Primary Light Documentation,‚Äù requiring 65 designated participants (plus backup) obtained 13 vehicles and a 30,000-watt generator, towed by a 40-foot flatbed truck. They moved this entire caravan down Laguna Canyon Road from 6 PM to 6 AM, while escorted by three different police agencies and Caltrans officials. The resulting images were printed onto a single print 3.5 inches wide by 516 feet long, depicting the entire length of the Northeast side of the road in kaleidoscopic color. The Tell photographic mural Coyote Door at The Tell By 1987, core samples were being taken for Southern California's first toll road, which would bisect Laguna Canyon, and maps were being drawn for the 3,200-unit Laguna Laurel housing development, which the road would serve. Construction for both was scheduled to begin in 1989. In response to these expected developments, Burchfield and Chamberlain began extensive lobbying to execute their next phase, which was to build a giant photographic mural in the canyon, directly in the path of the toll road, and across the highway from the proposed new city. On May 1, 1989, after three years of planning and months of fundraising, the art partners, along with a growing army of environmentalists, began constructing an outdoor photographic mural called The Tell. Since 1989 was the Centennial of Orange County, CA and the 150th anniversary of the discovery of photography, they decided that the project would be composed of photographs contributed by local residents and by people from all over the country. The installation would express concern, artistically, about the survival of the historic Laguna Canyon. When completed, Phase VIII, The Tell was a contemporary mound of artifacts and an environmental artwork, which reflected the community's past and looked to its future.Allan Jalon. \\"Two Artists Challenge Developers to Help on Canyon Photo Project,\\" Los Angeles Times, 30 May 1988.Robert Lachman. ‚ÄúPhotographers' Mural to Document Canyon Changes in 40,000 Pictures,‚Äù Los Angeles Times, 8 April 1989.Rick Vanderknyff. ‚ÄúArtists 'Tell' All to Save Laguna Canyon (part 1),‚Äù Los Angeles Times, 3 September 1989.Rick Vanderknyff. ‚ÄúArtists 'Tell' All to Save Laguna Canyon (part 2),‚Äù Los Angeles Times, 3 September 1989. The name \\"Tell\\" comes from the archeological term for a mound of artifacts from prior civilizations, buried over by natural elements. This Tell was built (rather than unearthed) as a small mountain composed of thousands of photographs, reflective of the lives of the people who donated images. It grew to 636-feet long and ranged from 36-feet high, dwindling down to the ground, as it undulated across the landscape and dove back into the hillside. The sculptural character of the artwork resembled the voluptuous nature of the surrounding canyons, with echoes of a female figure in its shape. It had a stylized Easter Island head as its physical and philosophical foundation. The pictures, glued onto the wooden framework, were woven together like pixels in a pointillist painting by density, color, content and type of material. They told numerous stories of man, woman and the land. These symbols were positioned by story lines on the chakra points of the larger body of the mural. Visitors to The Tell in the early spring saw vibrant, colorful images of themselves, their families and friends as part of the very large art work. Later in the summer and fall, as the canyon was transformed into desert colors, these photos and stories faded to become a part of the background fabric of a larger story of man's relationship with spaceship Earth. During the months of construction, the mural became the focal point and catalyst for numerous events and demonstrations. Some were planned and many happened spontaneously. The Tell dedication Mark Turnbull at the Tell More than 2,500 people attended the August 19 dedication of The Tell, erected in Laguna's Sycamore Hills area, including scores of environmental groups from all across the county. The installation also attracted media attention, including articles in the Los Angeles Times,Cathy Curtis. ‚ÄúDedication Expressed in Many Forms,‚Äù Los Angeles Times. 21 August 1989.

But it was so politically charged that no art organization would assist in its preservation. Lacking safe storage, most of the photographic mural burned in the Laguna Beach fire of 1993. Unlike an actual Tell, the structure was carefully removed to leave little evidence in the land it was attempting to save. All that remains at the site today are 88 barely visible postholes filled with pea gravel rhythmically spaced on the hillside for future explorers to discover. From October 18, 2015 through January 17, 2016, an exhibition on the Project, titled \\"The Canyon Project: Artivism,\\" including pieces of \\"The Tell,\\" was held at Laguna Art Museum, Laguna Beach, California.Antoine Boessenkool. \\"New exhibit in Laguna recalls 'The Canyon Project'‚Äù Orange County Register, 17 October 2015. The Walk  The Walk to Save Laguna Canyon On November 11, 1989, The Tell became the destination for an estimated 8,000 to 11,000 people who marched there from downtown Laguna for the \\"Walk to Save Laguna Canyon.\\" These participants then held a demonstration protesting the proposed 3,200 unit Laguna Laurel housing development, which was scheduled to be built across the road from The Tell site. Largely as a consequence of months of community involvement in the building of the mural, and of this dramatic public display, the Irvine Company negotiated with the cities of Irvine and Laguna Beach to release that land for public acquisition. In 1990, Laguna residents voted overwhelmingly to tax themselves to purchase the land to keep it as open space.Sharael Kolberg and Linda Domingo. ‚ÄúResidents Have Forged Policies, Protected Place and Stood Up For Their Beliefs,‚Äù Laguna Beach Magazine, January 2013. Laguna Beach environment Laguna Coast Wilderness Park entrance The most traveled route into town is the nine-mile Laguna Canyon Road within the Laguna Coast Wilderness Park, which has some of the last remaining undeveloped coastal canyons in Southern California. The park is dominated by coastal sage scrub, cactus and native grasses. Over 40 endangered and sensitive species call Laguna Coast home, including California gnatcatcher, cactus wren, and the endemic Laguna Beach dudleya. Drive further down the road toward the Pacific Ocean, and you pass the campus of Laguna College of Art and Design, artists‚Äô studios, numerous public art pieces, and three world famous summer art festivals. Laguna‚Äôs artistic legacy stretches back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries when people from across this country and Europe, many steeped in French Impressionism, moved to this area. Artists, including Frank Cuprien, Joseph Kleitsch and William Wendt, settled here, formed an art colony and used Canyon landscapes as subjects of their paintings. They employed the broad- brush strokes and pure, bright colors of their earlier French counterparts to capture the canyons; their artistic style came to be called California Impressionism. These paintings, displayed all over Laguna today, have transcendent qualities, expressing reverence for the beauty of the land. As you drive, hike or bike through Laguna Canyon, you can view vistas evocative of these paintings.

Launch Progress M-27M was the 27th Progress-M 11F615A60 spacecraft, with the serial number 427. It was built by RKK Energia and was operated by the Roscosmos. This was the second time the upgraded Soyuz-2.1a rocket was used for an ISS mission launch. The spacecraft was launched on 28 April 2015 at 07:09:50 UTC from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Progress M-27M was launched with a planned six-hour rendezvous profile to the ISS. During the launch the spacecraft achieved low Earth orbit, but a malfunction occurred near the end of the upper stage burn shortly before the separation of the Progress spacecraft, generating a debris field and leaving the spacecraft spinning and unable to be fully controlled. The spacecraft was deemed to be a total loss. Cargo The spacecraft carried of food, fuel and supplies, including of propellant, of oxygen, of water, and of spare parts, supplies and experiment hardware for the six members of the Expedition 43 crew aboard the International Space Station. Spacecraft failure Diagram: Free fall, Altitude/Date, Progress M-27M, Object 2015-024A After reaching low Earth orbit, but before separation of the spacecraft from the rocket, communication with the vessel was lost. Ground controllers only received brief telemetry shortly after that confirmed spacecraft separation as well as the deployment of the solar panels, but were not able to confirm the deployment of rendezvous antennas of the KURS system. Initially controllers tried to fall back to the plan of making a two-day rendezvous with the ISS, but this was also abandoned after ground stations were not able to communicate with the spacecraft during the next three orbits. During its fourth orbit, video released from an onboard camera used for docking showed that the spacecraft was spinning wildly in space. Further efforts on that day to establish communications with the spacecraft were unsuccessful. Two more communication sessions were attempted on 28 April to regain control of the spacecraft, but did not succeed. On 29 April, Roscosmos officially announced that the spacecraft was out of control and its orbit would eventually decay to fall back into Earth's atmosphere, with multiple systems suffering from failure and the main engine's fuel lines depressurized. The spacecraft was expected to disintegrate in the Earth's atmosphere between 7 and 11 May 2015. On the same day, the United States' NORAD reported that 44 pieces of debris \\"in the vicinity of the resupply vehicle and its upper stage rocket body\\" were being tracked by space tracking systems. Currently, various Russian sources reported that the potential cause of the anomaly may be related to the upper stage rocket engine shutdown or with the separation of the Progress spacecraft from the upper stage. A representative of the United States Air Force claimed that debris in the area indicated a blast. > Given [the altitude of the debris] and the fact that Progress was found 30 > to 40 kilometres above its intended orbit, we can say with confidence that > there was some kind of blast at the moment of separation from the third > stage of the rocket\\".

Postflight investigation found that the failure was caused by an unforeseen design flaw in the new Soyuz 2.1a Blok I stage ‚Äî the propellant tanks were shaped differently than in the older Soyuz-U booster, which ended up producing resonant vibration when attached to the Progress spacecraft. The normal flight program would vent out the nitrogen pressure gas from the Blok I tanks following spacecraft separation, but engine cutoff produced a hammer effect that sent a shock wave through the stack, rupturing the propellant tanks and blasting the Progress into a much higher than planned orbit, while also leaving it in an uncontrollable spin and having suffered structural damage from being struck by flying booster debris.http://spaceflight101.com/progress-ms/successful-launch-of-first- progress-ms/ The cost of the loss of the mission was valued at 2.59 billion rubles (US$50.7 million).

After moving to the academy of FC Nordsj√¶lland in 2010 from childhood club Br√∏ndby IF, Maxs√∏ made his professional debut in 2012 against Copenhagen. In 2017, he joined Turkish club Osmanlƒ±spor before signing for Swiss side FC Z√ºrich the following season, where he had a successful Europa League campaign, making the round of 32 in his season there. In 2019, he signed for KFC Uerdingen 05 before leaving the club by mutual agreement two months later and returning to his first club, Br√∏ndby. There, he became team captain after six months. Maxs√∏ has played for various Danish national youth teams. Most notably, he gained 24 caps for the Denmark national under-21 team. Club career Early career Originally starting out his career as a midfielder, Maxs√∏ went through the youth ranks of Br√∏ndby IF whom he joined when he was six years old. In 2009, he was promoted to the under-17 team and competed for a starting position on midfield against the likes of Pierre-Emile H√∏jbjerg, Andrew Hjulsager and Frederik Holst, who were all regulars on the Danish national under-17 team. In his early days at Br√∏ndby, Maxs√∏ did not stand out as a player as he was neither big nor particularly quick, but those who worked with him noted his constant desire to improve various aspects of his game. Nordsj√¶lland In 2010, he joined the FC Nordsj√¶lland youth academy and had a large growth spurt that made him taller and physically stronger, which meant that he could transition to defense more easily. On 9 December 2012, Maxs√∏ made his professional debut for FC Nordsj√¶lland, in a Superliga match against FC Copenhagen, where he was assigned to cover their striker, Andreas Cornelius. Despite losing 1-4, Maxs√∏ stated after the match that he felt his debut went \\"alright.\\" Two months later, he was one out of six under-19 players, who were invited to participate in the first-team training camp in La Manga. Maxs√∏ signed a contract extension with Nordsj√¶lland in the summer of 2016 and turned down a transfer offer from Danish top side FC Copenhagen, citing a desire to play abroad. While at the club, Maxs√∏ grew out to become one of the most important players in Nordsj√¶lland and a key player in defense. After having the role of vice- captain in the 2015‚Äì16 season, he became club captain in the 2016‚Äì17 season. On 11 January 2017, Maxs√∏ revealed his intensions of leaving Nordsj√¶lland in the summer of 2017 with the goal of being sold after the 2017 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. Osmanlƒ±spor On 4 August 2017, it was announced that Maxs√∏ was sold to Turkish club Osmanlƒ±spor. In his S√ºper Lig debut against Yeni Malatyaspor he scored his first goal for the club but could not prevent his side losing 1-3. He would struggle to find his footing in Osmanlƒ±spor, and was taken out at halftime in the 2-4 loss to Sivasspor on 17 September after being a part of a defense conceding four goals before half. Maxs√∏ had strong performances during the rest of the fall season, however, as he started in the first 15 matches. Despite this, Osmanlƒ±spor finished the first half of the season 16th out of 18 in the table. Maxs√∏ was benched during almost the entire second half of the season. He played his first minutes of the second half of the season on 3 March 2018, coming on in the 84th minute for Tortol Lumanza in a match against Kasƒ±mpa≈üa. He left the club after its relegation from the Turkish S√ºperlig at the end of the season.  Z√ºrich  On 29 June 2018, Maxs√∏ signed a three-year contract with Swiss Super League side FC Z√ºrich. He made his league debut for the club on 23 September 2018 in a 1-0 home victory over FC Luzern. He played all ninety minutes of the match. On 25 October, he was part of the starting lineup as Z√ºrich won 3-2 over Bayer 04 Leverkusen in the Europa League group stage. He would later also appear in the round of 32 matchups against Napoli, where Z√ºrich lost 1-5 on aggregate.

Bundesliga club KFC Uerdingen 05 announced that they had signed Maxs√∏.Top-Transfer: Andreas Maxs√∂ kommt zum KFC, kfc-uerdingen.de, 3 July 2019 On 2 September, he left the club by mutual agreement only two months and six appearances after his arrival, due to personal reasons.Maxs√∂ verl√§sst den KFC aus pers√∂nlichen Gr√ºnden , kfc- uerdingen.de, 2 September 2019 He later explained to Danish newspaper B.T. that his move to Uerdingen happened as part of a deal with Z√ºrich, who had a cooperation agreement with the former. He had initially expected to be sent on to Bournemouth of the Premier League, with whom the two clubs also had an agreement. Bournemouth had scouted him in Osmanlƒ±spor, and encouraged Maxs√∏ to sign with their cooperation club, Z√ºrich, with the goal to sign him later on, in case his performances kept improving. However, as the transfer window closed, Maxs√∏ explained that he was 'stuck' in Uerdingen 05 and had decided to buy himself out of his contract; something which according to him cost him millions of Danish kroner, but was a necessary career move. Br√∏ndby Maxs√∏ joined Br√∏ndby IF on a four-year contract on 9 September 2019. On 15 September, he made his Superliga-debut for Br√∏ndby in a 4-2 home win over his former team, Nordsj√¶lland. On 25 September, Maxs√∏ scored his first goal for Br√∏ndby, a vital equalizer in extra time in the Danish Cup against Skive IK. The match ended in a 3‚Äì2 win for Br√∏ndby. Throughout the fall, he established himself as a leading figure in the central defense of manager Niels Frederiksen's 3-5-2 formation and stabilising a formerly struggling defense together with fellow defenders Sigurd Rosted and Hj√∂rtur Hermannsson. In late January 2020, after the departure of Kamil Wilczek, Maxs√∏ was named club captain after having only been at the club for six months.

The tunnelling units were occupied in offensive and defensive mining involving the placing and maintaining of mines under enemy lines, as well as other underground work such as the construction of deep dugouts for troop accommodation, the digging of subways, saps (a narrow trench dug to approach enemy trenches), cable trenches and underground chambers for signals and medical services.The Tunnelling Companies RE , access date 25 April 2015 Background By January 1915 it had become evident to the BEF at the Western Front that the Germans were mining to a planned system. As the British had failed to develop suitable counter- tactics or underground listening devices before the war, field marshals French and Kitchener agreed to investigate the suitability of forming British mining units. Following consultations between the Engineer-in-Chief of the BEF, Brigadier George Fowke, and the mining specialist John Norton-Griffiths, the War Office formally approved the tunnelling company scheme on 19 February 1915. Norton-Griffiths ensured that tunnelling companies numbers 170 to 177 were ready for deployment in mid-February 1915.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 49. In the spring of that year, there was constant underground fighting in the Ypres Salient at Hooge, Hill 60, Railway Wood, Sanctuary Wood, St Eloi and The Bluff which required the deployment of new drafts of tunnellers for several months after the formation of the first eight companies. The lack of suitably experienced men led to some tunnelling companies starting work later than others. The number of units available to the BEF was also restricted by the need to provide effective counter-measures to the German mining activities.Peter Barton/Peter Doyle/Johan Vandewalle, Beneath Flanders Fields - The Tunnellers' War 1914-1918, Staplehurst (Spellmount) (978-1862272378) p. 165. To make the tunnels safer and quicker to deploy, the British Army enlisted experienced coal miners, many outside their nominal recruitment policy. The first nine companies, numbers 170 to 178, were each commanded by a regular Royal Engineers officer. These companies each comprised 5 officers and 269 sappers; they were aided by additional infantrymen who were temporarily attached to the tunnellers as required, which almost doubled their numbers. The success of the first tunnelling companies formed under Norton-Griffiths' command led to mining being made a separate branch of the Engineer-in-Chief's office under Major-General S.R. Rice, and the appointment of an 'Inspector of Mines' at the GHQ Saint-Omer office of the Engineer-in-Chief. A second group of tunnelling companies were formed from Welsh miners from the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the Monmouthshire Regiment, who were attached to the 1st Northumberland Field Company of the Royal Engineers, which was a Territorial unit. The formation of twelve new tunnelling companies, between July and October 1915, helped to bring more men into action in other parts of the Western Front. Most tunnelling companies were formed under Norton-Griffiths' leadership during 1915, and one more was added in 1916. On 10 September 1915, the British government sent an appeal to Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand to raise tunnelling companies in the Dominions of the British Empire. On 17 September, New Zealand became the first Dominion to agree the formation of a tunnelling unit. The New Zealand Tunnelling Company arrived at Plymouth on 3 February 1916 and was deployed to the Western Front in northern France.Anthony Byledbal, \\"New Zealand Tunnelling Company: Chronology\\" (online ), access date 5 July 2015 A Canadian unit was formed from men on the battlefield, plus two other companies trained in Canada and then shipped to France. Three Australian tunnelling companies were formed by March 1916, resulting in 30 tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers being available by the summer of 1916. Unit history Formation 170th Tunnelling Company was formed in February 1915, and initially attached to the 11th Field Company of Royal Engineers. The nucleus of 170th Tunnelling Company consisted of civilian sewer-workers from Manchester who had been employed in John Norton- Griffiths' business and were specialists in clay-kicking, as well as former miners who had been withdrawn from a number of regular infantry units, particularly the 8th Battalion of the South Wales Borderers, the 11th Battalion of the Welsh Regiment and the 8th Battalion of the South Staffordshire Regiment. 170th Tunnelling Company thus included a significant number of miners from South Wales, as did the 184th, 171st, 172nd, 253rd and 254th Tunnelling Company.Ritchie Wood, Miners at War 1914-1919: South Wales Miners in the Tunneling Companies on the Western Front, Wolverhampton Military Studies, Solihull (Helion and Company) 2016, . Givenchy 1915 Immediately after its formation, 170th Tunnelling Company was rushed to Givenchy for operations to counter enemy mining activity in that sector. The unit was relieved by 176th Tunnelling Company in June 1915. Cuinchy 1915 170th Tunnelling Company was next deployed under the command of 2nd Division on operations near Cuinchy and against the German position known as Brick stacks near La Bass√©e Canal in the vicinity of Cuinchy in summer 1915. 176th Tunnelling Company was also deployed under the command of 2nd Division near Cuinchy at that time, as was the 173rd Tunnelling Company. Hohenzollern Redoubt Diagram of crater mine galleries and saps Diagram of mine warfare, tunnels, galleries and ventilation In the opening of the Battle of Loos (25 September ‚Äì 14 October 1915), the unit blew two mines at the Hohenzollern Redoubt. 170th Tunnelling Company remained in this very active area for a considerable time, until 251st Tunnelling Company took over in October 1915. The Hohenzollern Redoubt near Loos-en-Gohelle in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region of France was the site of intense and sustained fighting between German and Allied forces. After an earlier British attack in October 1915, extensive tunnelling had been conducted by the Germans during the winter of 1915‚Äì1916; due to the nature of the clay covering and chalk below ground, mine explosions threw up high lips around mine craters, which became good observation points. It had been calculated that the German mining effort was six weeks more advanced than the British effort. 170th Tunnelling Company began work for a mining attack on the Hohenzollern Redoubt on 14 December 1915. By the end of the month, it was in the process of sinking six shafts. Two sections of 180th Tunnelling Company were then attached to 170th Tunnelling Company, and the miners began another three shafts. Mining was carried out in the clay layer to distract the Germans from other mine workings in the chalk. The British tunneling effort over the winter gradually overtook the German mining operation and a plan was made to destroy the German galleries. By late February 1916, 170th Tunnelling Company had driven deep galleries through the chalk between to within of the German front-line trenches, where four mines were placed underneath the shallower galleries dug by the Germans. An infantry attack was prepared by the 12th Division for 2 March. The four mines would counter the German advantage in observation from and possibly lead to the destruction of the German gallery system. Chamber A was loaded with of ammonal, Chamber B with of blastine and of ammonal and Chamber C with a charge of . 170th Tunnelling Company produced a forecast of the effect of the mines, in which mines A and B were predicted to make craters wide, deep and that Crater C to be wide and deep. The fourth, smaller mine had been planted under the side of Crater 2. At the mines were sprung, which made crater lips from which the German trenches could be seen. The explosion of the four mines (the largest yet sprung by the British) on 2 March was followed up by an attack of the British infantry. The new craters, A, B and C, older craters Triangle Crater were occupied and 170th Tunnelling Company destroyed German mine entrances found in the Triangle Crater. German counter-attacks retook Triangle Crater on 4 March and from skirmishing took place during heavy snowstorms and bitter cold. 170th Tunnelling Company eventually got into the German gallery system from a British tunnel and were able to demolish the system on 12 March, which relieved the threat of another German mine attack. On 18 March, five German mines detonated short of the British lines at , after which the Germans pushed back the British to the old front line. A counter-attack was organised, and the craters re-captured. The Germans retired and drove new galleries through the clay layer on top of the chalk, which could be dug more quietly and contributed to the surprise of the German mine explosions. By the time that the crater fighting died down, both sides held the near sides of the craters. The British exploded another mine on 19 March and the Germans two mines in the Quarries on 24 March. British mines were blown on 22 April; German mines were exploded on 31 March, 23 April. Each explosion was followed by infantry attacks and consolidation of the mine lips. From May 1916 until the end of the war, 170th Tunnelling Company was assigned to Reserve (later Fifth) Army.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 21. Bethune 1918 In April 1918, troops of 170th Tunnelling Company fought a large fire in B√©thune.

He introduced me to a local journalist in Lisbon and a few of their friends including a doctor and some others including academics from the Sloan School at MIT. They had noticed that there were quite a few non-medical people who were doing really innovative stuff in healthcare to make lives easier for people with handicaps, or with serious medical conditions. Many of these things were so different from anything a doctor would have ever said that they thought that it would be good if they could put together some kind of network where people who came up with these kind of ideas could advertise them and could share them with other patients who might benefit. I thought that was just a great idea, especially since I love this sort of maverick approach to medicine or science or anything else\\". * European Commissioner Carlos Moedas made the following remarks:SPEECH by Carlos Moedas - Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation - 13 July 2015 Sharing Solutions, Improving Life through Citizen Innovation \\"I think what you've achieved is nothing less than astonishing!

He is best known as the founder of Cool Group, which comprises over 50 companies. At age 30, Issa's first business venture was a petrol station named Cool Oasis, which was the catalyst for the Group becoming the largest Jamaican owned operator of petrol stations in Jamaica. In 2003, he set up a telephone card distribution business called Cool Card. Later, he extended the distribution business to include automotive and household products, among others, under the Cool brand. Over the next decade, the Cool brand grew rapidly into a group of over 50 companies engaged in a wide variety of activities. Joseph John Issa Chairman of Cool Group of Company  Early life  Issa was born in Kingston. His father is Chairman of SuperClubs Resort, John Issa, 29 December 1939 ‚Äì present. Issa's father was placed among the top 10 personalities of the decade 1990‚Äì2000. Issa received his secondary school education at Campion College in Kingston. In 1985 he became the 11th member of the Issa families to attend College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, USA, where he pursued an accountancy degree, which included one year at the London School of Economics (LSE) in the United Kingdom. He graduated in 1988 and Valedictorian Cum Laude with a number of awards, including the youngest resident Jamaican to become a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). Upon returning home from university, he joined SuperClubs Resorts, which his father had started in the early 1980s.  Career  Issa started work as the purchasing manager at the Grand Lido Negril, Negril, Jamaica one of SuperClubs chain of resorts. He became Resident Manager of the hotel a year later. During the next three years, Issa helped to reorganize the hotel as a resort for romantic vacations and honeymooners. In 1991 he assumed the position of general manager of Couples Hotel, the first to be established as an all-inclusive by his father in 1978 when Issa was 12 years old. He oversaw the refurbishment of the hotel. Issa was moved to the money-losing Grand Lido San Souci, which he made profitable within six months. In 1995, Issa was promoted to President of Development and Special Projects in the corporate office, a position in which he was involved in developing the various brands, including the establishment of new properties. He was subsequently promoted to Senior VP of Sales in 1996, and initiated a customer satisfaction program which led to increased bookings and sustained brand loyalty through repeat visits. In 1999, when Issa became Executive Vice- President, he instituted marketing programmes, including the establishment of a new website to take reservations online 24/7, which led to higher occupancy levels. He remained at the helm of SuperClubs until 2003, when he left to concentrate his own business, the Cool Group of Companies trading as Cool Corp.  Business Ventures  In 1994 created a company called Cool Corp, and started by opening a petrol station in Saint Ann's Bay, Jamaica named Cool Oasis. The company grew strategically over the years as Issa engaged in various business ventures. In 2001, Cool Automotive Distributors was established to deliver motor oil and lubricants to gas stations, auto stores, companies with fleet vehicles and trucking companies. IN 2014, it is one of the leading retailers of automobile-related lubricants and accessories in Jamaica, and also sells basic household products such as toilet paper and soap. In 2002, Issa formed Cool Card to distribute telephone cards in Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, offering phone cards from Jamaica's three cellular phone providers, Digicel, Cable & Wireless and MiPhone, and both cellular providers in Trinidad and Tobago, Digicel and Bmobile. In 2003, he created Cool Biz, and introduced 'EZ Card' an electronic top-up of telephone credit operated by over 3,000 individuals. In 2005, Issa started Cool Petroleum, which became the licensed user of Shell brands in Jamaica.

Activism  Issa undertook a number of extra-curricular activities while attending College of the Holy Cross in the US. He was the founder and editor of Holy Cross Journal of Political Economy in 1988. He also had a radio programme through which he informed of Jamaica's culture and heritage while playing Reggae music. While attending London School of Economics, he became President of the Afro- Caribbean Society, a multi-ethnic group which undertakes high-level discussions on social, political and economic development throughout the world. Issa also founded a charity, Educate the Children Fund, while at LSE and was active in fundraising to send school books to Caribbean children. When he returned to Jamaica in 1988, his passion for advocacy did not wane, especially as it relates to a credible social and economic environment, and accountability in governance. In 2000, Issa participated in media discussions on the impact of the high murder rate on foreign direct investments (FDIs) and economic growth in Jamaica. Issa also commented on the state of the tourism industry, advocating for government support to the small hotel sector and seeking to stem a brewing controversy of variable head tax rates for different cruise ship ports. In 2001, Issa addressed public concerns about political corruption by suggesting paying politicians more, Issa had based his position on KPMG Peat Marwick figures which showed that politicians earn significantly less than top civil servants and private sector counterparts. The following year, ahead of the 16 October, general elections, Issa took a stand for accountability in governance with what became known as the \\"Issa Initiative\\", calling for those seeking political office sign a pledge with their constituents promising that if elected, they would address two pivotal issues in their constituencies within a reasonable period of time. The idea resonated with people across the country and was supported by the two main political parties ‚Äì the Jamaica Labour Party and the People's National Party. The Gleaner newspaper called it a watershed in Jamaica's political culture, and said \\"the proposal from Joe Issa of the St. Ann Chamber of Commerce, which was taken up by the island's Chambers of Commerce has the potential of bringing about a change in the relationship between constituents and their elected representatives,\\" and that \\"it would require a greater level of consultation between those who are seeking political office and those who they hope to represent, on the priority needs of the constituencies.\\" A cartoon in The Gleaner depicted a politician telling an agitated female constituent, \\"just vote fi mi an' yu get light, water, telephone, roads, etc.\\", while Issa steps behind him with a covenant and pen, asking, \\"care to sign a pledge for just two of those?\\" Issa represented the island's 13 Chambers of Commerce during negotiations with the government concerning the Cess on street lights, intervening to avoid a threatened protest march.  Philanthropy  In 1987, Issa founded the \\"Educate the Children Fund\\" while attending the LSE. The school adopted the program, and the Fund was officially launched by Jamaica's then Acting High Commissioner in London, Dale Anderson. In his remarks, Anderson said Issa's initiative was particularly welcome at a time of scarce resources. A year later, after completing his studies at College of the Holy Cross and becoming a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), Issa launched the Joe Issa Holy Cross/Jamaica Scholarship Fund, which provided a scholarship to a talented undergraduate Jamaican child once every four years to attend his alma mater university. In 1991, while he was working at his parents' SuperClubs Grand Lido Negril resort, Issa launched a cricket and tennis training programme for young children in the parish of Negril. In the new millennium, Issa founded another charity, \\"Global Education 2000\\", to help Jamaican schools by partnering them with their US counterparts. The initiative has resulted in the implementation of various exchange programmes which have benefited several Jamaican schools and were widely reported in the Jamaican media. Also, while, at SuperClubs, Issa helped employees at the resorts to buy and develop land under a project called \\"People Development Programme\\". Since 2003, as Chairman of Cool Corporation, a group of 'Cool' branded companies that cut across many industries, Issa has set up Cool Charities, and has donated hundreds of computers, books, air conditioners and other school- related supplies primarily to educational institutions in the parishes of St. Mary and St. Ann. Issa volunteers as a Justice of the Peace (JP) for the parish of St Mary. He is a former director of First Global Bank, Guardian Life Limited and Supreme Ventures Limited; and board member of Seville Great House. He has been bestowed with an honorary life membership of the Rotary and Kiwanis clubs and is a past President of the St. Ann Chamber of Commerce. Also, since 1983, Issa has been serving as a Eucharistic Minister for the Catholic Church.  Honours and awards  Issa was Valedictorian for the Class of 1988, a first for an international student and an Economics/Accounting major in the 148-year history of College of the Holy Cross, where he graduated with honours ‚Äì Cum Laude. He made history again in 1988, when he became the youngest resident Jamaican to pass all four parts of the prestigious Certified Public Accountant examination in one sitting; and was awarded the Most Outstanding Junior Student by the Massachusetts Society of CPAs Inc. Issa is a member of several honours societies, namely, Phi Beta Kappa, Alpha Sigma Nu, and Omicron Delta Epsilon and a Dana Scholar. In 1994, at age 29, he was presented with the Young Hotelier of the World award by the International Hotel Association in Sydney, Australia. He was among Travel Agent Magazine's 100 Rising Stars for four consecutive years ‚Äì 1997‚Äì2000. Soon after taking charge as Executive Vice-President of SuperClubs in 1999, Issa succeeded in increasing bookings and building brand loyalty, which earned him the Jamaica Observer's Tourism's Brightest Spark award and a place among Jamaica's top 10 personalities for that year. The following year, he was among Jamaica's 10 sexiest men. Since venturing into his own business in 2003, Issa has received several more awards for \\"developing a multifaceted group of companies that provide employment for hundreds of people in St. Ann, and in the process creating a powerful 'Cool' brand that is being leveraged abroad\\".

Publia rescued most of the 156 passengers and crew, who had left the ship by lifeboat. Four crew were injured. They were taken off by helicopter and transferred to hospital in Palma de Mallorca. The Ports de Balears said in a Twitter post that they feared that Sorrento might sink. On 29 April 2015, it was announced that efforts would be made to bring the stricken ferry to a harbour in the Balearic Islands. This was welcomed by environmentalists, who criticized a decision two weeks earlier to tow a burning fishing vessel out of port in the Canary Islands. The Oleg Naydenov subsequently foundered and created an oil spill. Sorrento had developed cracks in her hull, and was in danger of sinking some off Majorca. If she were to sink, this would have an adverse effect on the Sa Dragonera natural park. The weather forecast for the days ahead was for increased winds and wave height. The burnt out ferry was subsequently towed to Sagunto, north of Valencia, where it arrived on 6 May.

Bell (born September 26, 1971) is an American former Seventh-day Adventist pastor who became an atheist after spending a \\"year without God\\" as an experiment. He has publicly spoken about his experiences before, during, and after this year, and he wrote about it in his blog \\"Year Without God\\" (later hosted by Patheos). He is a regular contributor at The Huffington Post and, in August 2015, launched a new blog and podcast \\"Life After God.\\" He currently serves as the National Organizing Manager for the Secular Student Alliance and as the Humanist Chaplain at the University of Southern California.  Early life  Bell was born in Parma, Ohio, and spent his childhood in Loma Linda, a California suburb largely populated by Seventh-day Adventists. Growing up, Bell was strictly religious. He was baptized when he was nine years old and not long after that his parents got divorced and he moved with his mother to live in southern Oregon. Bell lived with his grandparents, who were very faithful, traditional Adventists, during his high school years. That had a great effect on Bell, who became very conservative in his faith. Because his grandparents were volunteers at Weimar Institute at the time, Bell decided to transfer there during his junior year. He later served at the Covelo Church in the Northern California Conference, where Doug Batchelor was a pastor, and he did some ministry alongside Batchelor. After finishing at Weimar, Bell went to work for the Pennsylvania Conference where he realized that \\"my harsh ideology was bumping up against real life. I realized that God is not as much about ideas as he is about people. I knew that if I didn't love people, then I couldn't do my ministry.\\"  Career as a pastor  When Bell started his career as a pastor, he learned that his congregation did not follow the Adventist religious laws to the letter. They wore makeup and jewelry and some smoked, which all went against what Bell believed a true Adventist should be like. He realized \\"my ideology clashed with real people\\", and he decided not to exclude them. Bell became liberal in his views and opened his church to those who were not sure about organized religion. He became an advocate of social justice, speaking for gay rights and marriage equality. In 2010, the Hollywood Adventist Church, where Bell was pastor at the time, won the \\"2010 Innovative Church of the Year\\" award. During his time as pastor, his church was part of many different social initiatives and charities: One mile mission, where people took responsibility for the well being of every person within a one-mile radius; LA Voice, a faith-based organization which seeks to improve local communities through social change; and Imagine LA, which helps congregations mentor families coming out of homelessness. In March 2013, Bell was forced to resign from his position as a pastor, after he had argued in favor of ordination of women and the rights of homosexuals. According to Bell, the gap between him and his fellow clergymen had also widened due to his efforts for peace, justice, and interfaith dialogue, which were constantly met with resistance.  A Year Without God  After being a Seventh-day Adventist pastor for 19 years, Bell announced his 'A Year Without God' experiment on December 31, 2013, on his Huffington Post blog. The idea came from the question that Bell's friend once asked him: \\"What difference does God make?\\" He decided to find out by living the year without God. \\"For the next 12 months I will live as if there is no God. I will not pray, read the Bible for inspiration, refer to God as the cause of things or hope that God might intervene and change my own or someone else's circumstances.\\" Right after stating his intention, Bell lost his position and income at two Christian universities, Azusa Pacific University and Fuller Theological Seminary. In response, an early critic of the experiment, \\"Friendly Atheist\\" blogger Hemant Mehta, started a fundraising campaign among atheists to support Bell. The effort garnered $17,000 in its first few days. Tim Minchin, Heather Henderson, Ryan Bell and the film crew of A Year Without God The campaign raised over $27,000 to help Bell to support his family during his unemployment. The decision to live a year without God was met by criticism from faith-based communities. Christianity Today published an article, in which they criticized Bell's idea: \\"this notion that he can turn his faith off for one calendar year, then flip the switch back should he so desire strikes me as strange,\\" wrote Laura Turner. In an interview on the CBC Radio Tapestry podcast, Bell responded to some of the criticism by saying that he understands the position of \\"you either believe in God or not\\", but he also believes that people should be able to try things out, go wherever your questions lead you, pursue your own truth. On this podcast Bell also talks about how his life was affected by his decision to live without God. He said that his \\"life hasn't changed that much\\", he is not praying or reading the Bible but other than that he was always \\"a feet on the ground\\" pastor. In April 2014, Bell attended the American Atheists National Convention in Salt Lake City. When asked how his journey into atheism was faring, he stated, > It is still very confusing. I do still think faith is very understandable. > And I would be fine to return to it. But with another part of my mind, I'm > constantly puncturing holes in it. There is also a cost-benefit analysis to > it. Religion is beautiful, but it can also encourage violence, and taking > away the rights of others. Especially the monotheistic religions; they claim > the exclusive truth.  Life After God podcast  Life After God logo. In August 2015, Bell launched the Life After God podcast, to discuss his and other people's apostasy, and how they live their lives now without religion. The podcast is part of the broader project Life After God, which serves to provide a \\"safe, hospitable space for people to explore their doubts, recalibrate their ‚Äòmoral compass‚Äô, and create new friendships.\\"  References   External links  Year Without God - The Film 1971 births Living people People from Parma, Ohio American atheists American bloggers American former Protestants Former Seventh-day Adventists People from Loma Linda, California ","title":"Ryan J.

Cabellut works on large scale canvases using a contemporary variation of the fresco technique. Early life and influences Born in a village in Aragon, Cabellut moved to Barcelona as a child where her mother ran a brothel. She was left under the care of her grandmother but spent most of her days on the streets selling 'imaginary stars'. When her grandmother died, Cabellut went to live in an orphanage. At the age of twelve Lita was adopted by a Catalan family. During this new period she discovered the Prado Museum and became inspired by the paintings of Goya, Vel√°zquez, Ribera and Rembrandt. Lita Cabellut moved to the Netherlands at the age of 19 to pursue her studies at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam, where she studied between 1982 and 1984. During these years her work would be influenced by the Dutch masters and she developed some of the artist techniques that have become her distinguishing mark. Work Miquiztli, from the series A Chronicle of the Infinite, 2018  Art techniques  Working on large-scale canvases, Spanish artist Lita Cabellut has developed a contemporary variation of the classic fresco technique and a recognizable personal palette style that comes from her obsession to provide her characters with a skin. However, beyond her most recognized works and techniques Cabellut is a multi-disciplinary artist whose works also include: drawings on paper, sculptures, photography, scenography, installations, poetry, visual poems and videos.  Collections  Lita Cabellut's work is grouped conceptually in collections or series of paintings. The collection ‚ÄúFrida, The Black Pearl‚Äù (2010) pays tribute to Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, in which Cabellut depicts Kahlo‚Äôs life while including many of her own experiences. This series inspired Cabellut to create ‚ÄúCoco, The Testimony of Black and White‚Äù (2011), a collection that portrays this fashion icon through 35 large-scale portraits. ‚ÄúA Portrait of Human knowledge‚Äù (2012) continues Cabellut‚Äôs previous work with portraits of some of the most influential icons of knowledge from the past 150 years, including Stravinsky, Nureyev, Marie Curie, Billie Holiday, Federico Garcia Lorca, Rudolf Steiner and Sigmund Freud. With ‚ÄúThe Trilogy of the Doubt‚Äù, a collection composed by socially inspired triptych paintings about power, injustice and ignorance, Cabellut received attention both in her native Spain in The Netherlands. The portrait collection ‚ÄúDried Tear‚Äù (2013) expresses Cabellut‚Äôs fascination and admiration for Asian culture. Cabellut‚Äôs series about the Dutch Golden Age entitled ‚ÄúThe Black Tulip‚Äù (2014) was inspired by one of the most famous national symbols of the Netherlands. For her latest collection ‚ÄúBlind Mirror‚Äù (2015), Cabellut explored culture and religion, focusing on some of the most influential religions that have been known to humanity. The innovative series A Chronicle of the Infinite (2018) addresses the effects of time and experience on the process of human transformation.

Description  The work was commissioned by the tenor Peter Pears.Liner notes by Peter Pears on LP Argo ZK 28-29 It consists of settings of texts by John Donne (15721631), adapted from three of the Meditations in his Devotions upon Emergent Occasions. A typical performance takes 9 minutes.

Now this bell, tolling softly for another, says to me, Thou must die. Peter Pears has said: \\"Whereas the medievals for the most part dispensed with any harmonic implications, here the composer has suggested a strong harmonic skeleton behind the solo voice, to fine effect: in the last section the use of different registers of the voice vividly underlines Donne's wonderful text.  The song texts  The texts use 17th century spelling. Modernised, they read:  1. \\"Wee Cannot Bid the Fruits\\"  We cannot bid the fruits come in May, nor the leaves to stick on in December. There are of them that will give, that will do justice, that will pardon, but they have their own seasons for all these, and he that knows not them, shall starve before that gift come. Reward is the season of one man, and importunity of another; fear is the season of one man, and favour of another; friendship the season of one man, and natural affection of another; and he that knows not their seasons, nor cannot stay them, must lose the fruits.  2. \\"In the Wombe of the Earth\\"  In the womb of the earth, we diminish, and when she is delivered of us, our grave opened for another, we are not transplanted, but transported, our dust blown away with profane dust, with every wind.  3. \\"Nunc, lento, sonitu dicunt, morieris\\"  Nunc, lento, sonitu dicunt, morieris. The bell doth toll for him that thinks it doth. Morieris.Latin. Thou must die. Who casts not up his eye to the sun when it rises? but who takes off his eye from a comet when that breaks out? Who bends not his ear to any bell, which upon any occasion rings? Morieris. But who can remove it from that bell which is passing a piece of himself out of the world? Nunc, lento, sonitu dicunt, morieris. No man is an island, entire of itself; no man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main.

Ondiveeran came from the Arunthathiyar community and is viewed by them as a hero. Pressure from the Arunthathiyars led the Government of Tamil Nadu to build a memorial to him in Tirunelveli district. The community's efforts to obtain a monument included public protests. The foundation stone for the memorial was laid in 2011. *THE STORY OF ONDIVEERAN PAGADAI After borrowing 20,000 rupees from the East India Company, Arcot Nawab handed over the right of getting tax over the kings of Tamil Nadu to the East India Company and so the company came to the state with their weapons and thousands of soldiers to get back their money. In the year 1755, camped at Thenmalai, the British chieftain sent a message to Poolithevan stating to pay the tax to the East India Company and failing to do so can provoke a war by the East India Company and to start the war by proving the Poolithevan's bravery, he must take the following things from the camp of The East India Company situated at Thenmalai in Nerkattan Sevvayal. * The personal sword of Arcot Nawab. * The personal horse of Arcot Nawab. * The war Drum of Arcot Nawab These need to be taken while fighting with thousands of soldiers residing in the camp. As Poolithevan was completely provoked and his chieftain took this as a challenge, the chieftain secretly galloped his horse to the camp and fought efficiently. Then he took the things that was mentioned in the message from The East India Company. Then, Poolithevan was happy that he won, and because of the fight that happened before, the camp lost its armories and soldiers and had left the place to avoid further loss. This made them to develop a grudge against the Poolithevan and his chieftain Ondiveeran. It resulted in the initiation of 11 wars successively. During one of the wars, the East India Company arrested Poolithevan from his fort situated at Vasutheva Nallur. He was beheaded. Then Ondiveeran was enthroned as the king and fought against them. He also took care of Poolithevan's family. At last, Ondiveeran fought 11 great wars against the East India Company and passed away out of injuries at the battlefield but still lead his army to victory. He was able to penetrate into enemy's fort and made many heads rolling, and just made them run for their life. He was a brave warrior and a great commander-in- chief. Historically, he is the first person to fight a war against the British empire in India in 1755, which in other words, he is the first freedom fighter of India. A book written by Poolithevan known as the \\"Poolithevan Sindu\\", states that Ondiveeran was very brave and a person who is very down to the earth. Despite the fact that he fought against the British empire bravely, he was never praised by the people of the country because of two main factors: *Due to lack of historical records about his personal life. *Discrimination based on caste by the people. Ondiveeran belongs to the Arunthathiyar community which now comes under scheduled caste in the present day's India. *ORIGIN OF THE WORD \\" PAGADAI \\" He also has a title known as \\"Pagadai\\" which basically translates to \\"Dice\\" in English. The title was given to him because a die is thrown with an expectation in the mind of the doer and also the title bearer also sent to the war to win the war representing the Empire he belongs to. Today, a temple has been built in the place where he had died and the people of that region maintain strict discipline within the premises of the temple.

A longtime professor of comparative biosciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, Kummerow was best known as an opponent of the use of artificial trans fats in processed foods, carrying out a 50-year campaign for a federal ban on the use of the substance in processed foods.Katie Hafner, Fred A. Kummerow, an Early Opponent of Trans Fats, Dies at 102, New York Times (June 1, 2017). He was one of the pioneers in establishing the connection between trans fats and heart disease, and he helped to cement the inclusion of trans fats into the Nurses' Health Study.Melanie Warner, A Lifelong Fight against Trans Fat, New York Times (December 16, 2013). He also helped discover that it is oxidized cholesterol, rather than the cholesterol, that causes heart disease.Scientist, 98, Challenges Orthodoxy on Causes of Heart Disease, SciCast (adapted from the University of Illinois) (July 31, 2013). Early life and education Kummerow was born in Berlin on October 4, 1914; his father was a laborer. At the age of eight, he moved with his family to the United States, arriving at Ellis Island on Memorial Day 1923.Joan Cary, Papers of 102-year-old U. of I. professor reflect work in lab, a world of change outside it, Chicago Tribune (March 18, 2017) The family settled in Milwaukee. An interest in science was sparked by a gift of a chemistry set on his twelfth birthday. Kummerow was graduated from the University of Wisconsin at Madison in 1939, with a degree in chemistry; he received a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the same university in 1943. Career Kummerow researched lipids at Kansas State University during and after World War II. He won a contract from the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps to investigate methods of preventing frozen turkeys and chickens from tasting rancid. Ultimately, \\"a simple change in the poultry feed solved the problem, making possible the sale of frozen poultry in grocery stores.\\" The feed change was from linseed to corn.Schudel, Matt, Fred A. Kummerow, scientist who raised early warnings about trans fats, dies at 102, June 3, 2017, The Washington Post During his early career, Kummerow participated in developing a cure for pellagra through enrichment of grits with niacin. Pellagra was a chronic disease affecting millions with inadequate diets, mostly in the southern U.S., and having a death toll of 100,000 between 1900 and 1940. In 1950, Kummerow joined the staff of the University of Illinois, where he remained throughout the rest of his life. His research, funded by National Institutes of Health grants, focused on heart disease, until shortly before his death. His research led to the discovery of the link between trans fats and cardiac disease. As a researcher during the Cold War, Kummerow traveled widely in Soviet bloc countries to speak with scientists, reporting back to the State Department on what he had learned. He turned his attention to Parkinson's and Alzheimer's in 2013. Kummerow authored at least 460 journal articles over the course of his career. He published the first paper suggesting a connection between trans fats and heart disease in 1957. The article, which appeared in Science, did not meet with widespread acceptance initially and even received scornful disdain from some associated with the food industry. It took decades before the link between trans fat-consumption and heart disease was fully accepted. Kummerow's work, however, helped to cement the inclusion of trans fats into the Nurses' Health Study. The results of that study further confirmed the link. He also helped discover that it is oxidized cholesterol (oxysterols), rather than the cholesterol, that causes heart disease. Kummerow urged food companies to lower the amount of trans fat in foods laden with the substance, such as shortening and margarine,Brady Dennis, Fred Kummerow, U. of I. professor who fought against trans fats, dies at 102, Washington Post (June 2, 2017). and the multitude of products containing them. As further studies confirmed the trans fat-heart disease link, the Center for Science in the Public Interest filed 1994 petition with FDA to require that the trans-fats substance be listed on nutrition facts labels (the petition was ultimately granted 12 years later), and the American Heart Association began to warn about the health risks of trans fats in 2004. Food companies also began voluntarily to remove trans fats from their products amid growing scientific and consumer pressure. In 2009, at the age of 94, Kummerow filed a petition with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a federal ban on artificial trans fats. The FDA did not act on his petition for four years, and in 2013 Kummerow filed a lawsuit against the FDA and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, seeking to compel the FDA to respond to his petition and, \\"to ban partially hydrogenated oils unless a complete administrative review finds new evidence for their safety.\\" Kummerow 's petition stated that \\"Artificial trans fat is a poisonous and deleterious substance, and the FDA has acknowledged the danger.\\" Three months after the suit was filed, on June 16, 2015, the FDA moved to eliminate artificial trans fats from the U.S. food supply, giving manufacturers a deadline of three years. The FDA specifically ruled that trans fat was not generally recognized as safe and \\"could no longer be added to food after June 18, 2018, unless a manufacturer could present convincing scientific evidence that a particular use was safe.\\" Kummerow stated: \\"Science won out.\\" The ban is believed to enable the prevention of approximately 90,000 premature deaths annually. Later years Kummerow formally retired at the age of 78, taking the title of emeritus professor of comparative biosciences. He continued to conduct research, even as a centenarian. Around his one hundredth birthday, Kummerow switched his focus to Parkinson's and Alzheimer's research, rather than heart disease, saying that he \\"felt that he was through with heart disease.\\" He also said that he wanted to research Parkinson's disease, the cause of his wife's death two years earlier, and Alzheimer's disease, the cause of his sister-in- law's death. Kummerow maintained his lab at the University of Illinois until the year before his death.Bernhard, Blythe, Oldest working scientist takes on Alzheimer's disease, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, October 4, 2015 In addition to his scientific and science advocacy work, Kummerow was involved in citizen advocacy more broadly; his papers include copies of \\"letters to five U.S. presidents, members of Congress and other people of distinction on topics such as the national debt, the Vietnam War, nuclear weapons, and energy.\\" Death Kummerow died on May 31, 2017, at his home in Urbana, Illinois, at the age of 102. He had been married for 70 years to his wife, Amy, who predeceased him. She died in July 2012. Kummerow is survived by a son and two daughters.

Written and directed by Sanjay Patel, and based on his childhood, it premiered on June 15, 2015 at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival in France, and accompanied the theatrical release of Pixar's The Good Dinosaur on November 25, 2015. Inspired by Patel's own childhood when he felt conflicted by the modern world and the Hindu traditions of his family, Sanjay's Super Team follows the daydream of a young Indian boy, bored with his father's religious meditation, who imagines Hindu gods as superheroes. Plot An inter-title card at the start of the short states that it is based on a (mostly) true story. A young boy, Sanjay, is watching his favorite superhero show, Super Team, at home and sketching its characters in his notebook. At the same time, his father is trying to meditate at a small Hindu shrine in the same room. Each is annoyed by the sounds of the other's activity until Sanjay's father turns off the television, confiscates his son's Super Team action figure, and makes him participate in prayer. Sanjay retrieves the toy while his father is distracted, but accidentally sets its cape on fire from the shrine's oil lamp. While putting out the cape, he extinguishes the lamp as well and is transported to a temple with three stone statues. Suddenly, a demon-figure similar to Ravana appears and begins to steal the statues' weapons. Sanjay breaks the light-up mechanism in his toy and uses it to ignite the giant lamp in the middle of the room, bringing the statues to life as the gods Vishnu, Durga, and Hanuman. The gods begin to fend off the demon‚Äôs attacks and ring their bells to drive him back, but he retaliates, destroying their bells. Sanjay recognizes the giant lamp as an upside-down bell and breaks his toy on it to ring it aloud, calming the demon so that he departs the temple. Sanjay receives a new toy from Vishnu as well as his blessing, then finds himself back in the real world, the cape on his action figure intact. His father returns the remote control, disappointed at his son's lack of interest in their cultural traditions. Instead of turning the television on, Sanjay begins drawing in his notebook and surprises his father with a new sketch: the gods from his daydream watching over the Super Team heroes. The story ends with real life pictures of Sanjay Patel and his father, during his childhood and in the present day. Production Patel premiered the film at the 2015 Annecy International Animated Film Festival The inspiration for the short film came from Patel's own childhood, growing up in San Bernardino in the 1980s, in a family of Indian immigrants. Like many American children of the era, he played with Transformers, watched Looney Tunes cartoons and read Superman comics. He also performed daily Hindu rituals of meditation and prayer with his father. He felt conflicted by his parents' traditions, saying \\"Our worlds were diametrically apart. I just wanted my name to be Travis, not Sanjay.\\" Growing up, he became more confident with his identity, although he still found it challenging to openly embrace his Indian background at work. As a child, he \\"felt deeply the absence of anyone who looked like him in films and television.\\" To \\"bring a young brown boy's story to the pop culture zeitgeist,\\" Patel first pitched the short to Pixar executives during 2012. Pixar's chief creative officer, John Lasseter, was very welcoming to the idea \\"about celebrating the personal side of the story.\\" The film's setting was inspired by the Lido Motel, an old Route 66 motel which his parents bought and worked at when he was a child. Patel started the film with only Vishnu, which served as a \\"mirror of my father\\" and would contrast one deity with three superheroes. Then the development team suggested adding more gods, with Patel choosing Durga to showcase a goddess as \\"in Vedic philosophy, there's always a masculine energy and a feminine energy\\", and Hanuman for a half animal deity. The demon-figure was inspired by a number of sources, including the notions of disrespect and greed. Finally, drawing from Buddhist tradition, \\"the demon isn't vanquished, he isn't destroyed.

Although six scientific publications were submitted purporting to show the existence of measles, they failed to meet the contest requirements as set by Lanka.[1] .  Life  Bardens was born in Homburg, Saarland. After his service as a conscientious objector, Bardens trained as a paramedic in Mainz. In 2014, he completed the study of medicine at the Saarland University in Homburg with a dissertation on laparoscopic hysterectomy: new findings on surgical techniques, influencing factors and postoperative course of pain. During his studies, he worked as a teacher at a school of midwifery and as a perfusionist at the German Foundation for Organ Transplantation. Bardens also founded a food company in 2011 in Bremen to sell the anti-hangover lemonade freigeist. He worked after graduation for a short time as an assistant physician at the University‚Äòs Women's Hospital in Homburg before moving to Sweden where he is currently a general practitioner. Bardens is also the grandson of the former German Member of Parliament Dr. Hans Bardens.See \\"One could hand the virus to Lanka on a silver platter‚Ä¶ an interview with David Bardens at positivists.org  The David Bardens vs. Stefan Lanka law suit In November 2011, the anti-immunization activist Stefan Lanka guaranteed a prize of ‚Ç¨100,000 for proof of the existence of the measles virus, specifically the determination of its diameter.The original page is no longer online.

Tsarnaev's attorney, Judy Clarke, opened by telling the jurors that her client and his older brother, Tamerlan, planted a bomb killing three and injuring hundreds, as well as murdering an MIT police officer days later. \\"There's little that occurred the week of April the 15th ... that we dispute,\\" Clarke said in her 20-minute opening statement. Tsarnaev was found guilty on all 30 counts and has been sentenced to death by lethal injection for his crimes. Pre-trial events Tsarnaev's arraignment for 30 charges, including four for murder, occurred on July 10, 2013, in the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts in Boston before U.S. Magistrate Judge Marianne Bowler. It was his first public court appearance. He pleaded not guilty to all 30 counts against him, which included using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death. Tsarnaev is represented by Miriam Conrad, David Bruck, William Fick, Timothy G. Watkins, and Judy Clarke. On January 30, 2014, United States Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the federal government would seek the death penalty against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. A plea deal failed when the government refused to rule out the possibility of the death penalty. The proceedings are led by Judge George O'Toole. Jury selection lasted two months. Opening statements Opening statements took place on March 4, 2015. Assistant US Attorney William Weinreb opened for the prosecution. \\"He pretended to be a spectator, but he had murder in his heart,\\" Weinreb said. Weinreb gave graphic details of the aftermath, while some of the victims' family members were in the courtroom listening. Weinreb said eight- year-old Martin Richard \\"bled to death on the sidewalk\\", L√º Lingzi (), had the \\"inside of her stomach pouring out\\", and Krystle Campbell was left with \\"gaping holes\\" in her body. It was revealed on the first day that Tsarnaev stood on Boylston Street for four minutes before placing a backpack with a bomb in it on the ground. After planting the bombs, Tsarnaev went shopping for milk at a Whole Foods Market after the bombings as if \\"nothing had happened\\". Jurors also learned that Stephen Silva, a friend of Tsarnaev's, gave the 9mm Ruger pistol that killed MIT police officer Sean Collier while the Tsarnaevs attempted to escape. Collier was shot twice in the side of the head, once between the eyes, and three times in the right hand. A graduate student saw the Tsarnaevs standing by the police cruiser Collier was sitting in, and another person heard the gunshots. Prosecutors contended that the Tsarnaev brothers were inspired by Al-Qaeda, and it was by reading Inspire, an Al- Qaeda-sponsored online publication, that they learned to construct the pressure cooker bombs used. It was also learned that Tamerlan died when Dzhokhar ran over him while attempting to escape from a shootout with police in Watertown. In admitting to the crimes, Clarke said that \\"the circumstances that bring us here today still are difficult to grasp, they are incomprehensible, they are inexcusable\\", but tried to say that Dzhokhar acted under the influence of Tamerlan. Marathon victims and witnesses On the second day of the trial, March 5, seven witnesses testified about what they saw before, during, and after the blasts. The testimony of Bill Richard, Martin's father, caused several in the courtroom to cry, including at least one juror. Iraq war veteran and Boston police officer Frank Chioloa, testified about the last moments of Krystle Marie Campbell, and fellow officer Lauren Woods did the same about Lu Lingzi. Woods refused an order to leave Lu's side after she died.. Also Boston Police Captain Frank Armstrong and Massachusetts State Police patrolmen Frannie Deary, Paul Downey, Bill Zubrin, and Jimmy Scopa testified about standing over Martin's body for 12 hours after the bombing. Jeff Bauman, a victim who lost both legs, appeared in court wearing shorts. A photo of him being pushed in a wheelchair by \\"the man in the Cowboy hat,\\" Carlos Arredondo, was widely circulated after the blasts. He testified that he noticed an uncomfortable Tamerlan leaving a backpack on the ground moments before it exploded. By the third day of testimony, March 9, jurors had heard from 27 witnesses who were either injured in the explosions, or who attempted to help those who were. Jurors also saw a compilation of security camera videos that show the Tsarnaev brothers approach the finish line, place the bombs on the ground, and then walk away. It was also revealed that Tsarnaev had a secret Twitter account with which he posted extremist Islamic material. James Hooley, head of Boston Emergency Medical Services, testified ambulances brought 118 victims to hospitals. Police vehicles were also used to transport victims, and every available Boston Police resource was brought to the scene, according to Boston police Superintendent-in-Chief William Gross. Gross told the jurors that public transportation to the area was suspended and the police swept for other explosives. A police commander screamed into the radio to \\"Stop the race; give me everything you have to Boylston Street!\\" The area was cleared of spectators, runners, and other victims within 22 minutes. Jurors also saw video of Tsarnaev 20 minutes after the explosions, pondering which type of milk to buy, and another of him in the UMass gym later that evening. Collier murder and carjacking On the fourth day of the trial, a note scrawled by Tsarnaev in the boat where he was hiding out was shown to jurors. Tsarnaev was found hiding in a fetal position by the boat's owner, David Henneberry. He said he was jealous of his brother who had received Jannutul Firdaus, or the highest paradise, and asked God to make him a shaheed. Jurors saw the boat in person on the seventh day of the trial. The murder of Sean Collier was the primary focus of the fifth day of the trial. Collier was found alive but possibly unconscious, and making a gurgling noise. He was shot three times in the head, including once between the eyes, and three times in the hand. At least one bullet was fired with the muzzle pressed against his skin. Both he and his car were covered in blood after he was shot when the Tsarnaev brothers tried to steal his gun. On the trial's sixth day, Dun Meng (Â≠üÁõæ)Chinese name from: described being carjacked by the Tsarnaev brothers and being forced to drive for 90 minutes before escaping. Gun battle in Watertown The seventh day of the trial brought discussion of the gun battle between police and the Tsarnaev brothers in Watertown, Massachusetts. Tamerlan was trading shots with Watertown Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese when the officer's gun ran out of ammunition and Tamerlan's jammed. They then wrestled on the ground, when Dzhokhar sped past them in a stolen SUV close enough that Pugliese could feel the wind on his face. Tamerlan was hit by the car, and dragged for 30 feet, killing him. Police from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Police also took part in the battle. Richard Donohue, an MBTA officer, was shot during the firefight and nearly died. The brothers also threw bombs at the officers. Jurors learned that the Tsarnaev brothers received the gun they used in their escape attempt from Stephen Silva, a childhood friend of Dzhokhar. While he was on the stand prosecutors attempted to \\"portray Tsarnaev as a secret jihadist with murderous plans, a depraved criminal worthy of the death penalty\\" while the defense team tried to portray Tamerlan as the dominant figure and Dzhokhar as subservient to him. The two friends were both drug dealers, according to Silva, who was facing drug and gun charges of his own. Sentencing By the jury On April 8, 2015, Tsarnaev was found guilty on all thirty counts of the indictment. The charges of usage of a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death, in addition to aiding and abetting, made Tsarnaev eligible for the death penalty. Bill and Denise Richard, parents of the youngest of the three killed in the bombings, urged against a death sentence for Tsarnaev. They stated that the lengthy appeals period would force them to relive that day continually, and would rather see him spend life in prison without possibility of release or parole. Tsarnaev, who had been largely emotionless throughout his trial, appeared to weep when his relatives testified on May 4, 2015, during the sentencing phase of the trial. The defense characterized life in prison as a harsh punishment, and did not try to convince the jury that Dzohkhar's actions deserved anything less. The prosecution argued that death by lethal injection was a more appropriate punishment. On May 15, 2015, the jury recommended that Tsarnaev be sentenced to death by lethal injection on six counts of the indictment. The death sentence counts were related to the setting of the second bomb, which killed Lu and Richard. The counts related to the deaths of Campbell and Collier did not result in death sentences; the jury believed that Tamerlan Tsarnaev had responsibility for the first bomb, which killed Campbell. Federal death sentences have been carried out at the USP Terre Haute in Indiana. By the judge O'Toole formally handed down the death sentence on June 24, 2015. Victims and family members had the opportunity to make statements beforehand, although the judge was required to deliver the jury's death verdict. \\"He chose to do nothing to prevent all of this from happening. He chose hate. He chose destruction. He chose death,\\" Bill Richard said. \\"We choose love. We choose kindness. We choose peace. This is our response to hate. That's what makes us different from him.\\" Speaking for the first time, Tsarnaev apologized to the victims and the survivors. \\"I am Muslim. My religion is Islam. I pray to Allah to bestow his mercy on those affected in the bombing and their families,\\" he said. \\"I pray for your healing ... I ask Allah to have mercy on me, my brother and my family.\\" After officially ordering that Tsarnaev be executed, O'Toole told him, \\"No one will remember that your teachers were fond of you, that you were funny, a good athlete ... Whenever your name is mentioned, what will be remembered is the evil you have done .... What will be remembered is that you murdered and maimed ... It was a monstrous self-deception. You had to forget your own humanity. The common humanity you shared with your brother Tamerlan.\\" Appeals Tsarnaev submitted a placeholder appeal with an actual appeal coming sometime before the deadline of August 17, 2016. On January 15, 2016, Judge George O' Toole denied Tsarnaev's appeal and ordered him to pay $101,125,027 to the victims and the Massachusetts Victim Compensation Fund. In December 2018 Tsarnaev's lawyers filed an appeal on several grounds, including the trial not being moved outside of Boston, and two of the jurors making false claims about their pre-trial communication about the incident. The appeal was upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit on July 31, 2020, reversing three of the convictions and vacating the death sentence, and a new sentencing trial was ordered for the overturned charges. The remaining convictions still carried multiple life sentences that kept Tsarnaev in prison regardless of the fate of the new trial.

Hunt monitoring is an activity undertaken by concerned individuals who want to see the UK Parliament‚Äôs Hunting Act upheld and endeavor to bring the persecutors of our wildlife to justice. A hunt monitor observes a hunt in England Hunt monitoring activities are undertaken mainly by private individuals who wish to see The Hunting Act 2004, passed by The U.K. Parliament, upheld by The U.K. Courts. Hunt monitoring is also carried out by a number of animal welfare organizations in The U.K.. The prime aim of hunt monitors is to facilitate successful prosecution of those who do not hunt within the laws of The U.K., through gathering evidence of illegal hunting. The Hunting Act 2004 became law, in England and Wales, in February 2005. It bans hunting with dogs of particular wild mammals, namely: foxes, deer, hare and mink. The ban was achieved through efforts of many campaigners, over almost a century. In recent years, evidence gathering by hunt monitors became central to the long campaign to ban hunting with hounds, as hunt monitors began to use portable video cameras to record hunting activity. Recorded evidence of hunting with dogs, collected by hunt monitors, was shown in the media and to Members of Parliament, and contributed to evidence used to support passage of The Hunting Bill through Parliament. Before the hunting with dogs ban came into force, it was reported that an estimated 50,000 hunt supporters had signed a \\"Hunting Declaration\\", pledging that they would break any such anti-hunting law, should it be put onto The Statute Book. Local newspapers were invited to hunting rallies, in order to publicize signings of \\"Hunting Declarations\\". Since The Hunting Act became law, in contrast to tackling illegal hare coursing fairly consistently, the police and The Crown Prosecution Services appear to have been reluctant to act against organized hunts. Nevertheless, numerous members of organized hunts have been taken to court. A significant number of members, as well as an organized hunt, acting as a corporate body, have been convicted of hunting illegally . The work of hunt monitors has been recognized by Ann Widdecombe, a former Conservative Minister and MP. On 22 March 2007, Ann Widdecombe, MP led an Adjournment Debate in The U.K. Parliament, where, in The House of Commons, she raised an issue of enforcement of The Hunting Act 2004. She explained to The House the roles of hunt monitors and the problems which they encounter. She paid tribute to hunt monitors, saying \\"‚Ä¶ some of them are extremely brave.\\" Later in 2007, on 31 October, Ann Widdecombe, MP held a reception in Parliament, where she showed film to those present, including representatives of 11 police forces, The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and Members of Parliament, which demonstrated that the hunting law was being broken, up and down the country. She pointed out that the only people monitoring these activities were groups of hunt monitors. In January 2011, The Huntsman and a Terrierman of The Fernie Hunt were found guilty of digging a fox out of a sett and, in May 2012, three members of The Crawley and Horsham Hunt were found guilty of illegal hunting. In August 2012, two members of The Meynell and South Staffordshire Hunt were found guilty of illegal hunting. The Hunt Master and a Terrierman were each convicted at Derby Magistrates' Court. An illegally hunted fox at Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire 2012 In December 2012, The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) took out a private prosecution, using evidence collected by several, independent hunt monitors, against Heythrop Hunt Limited. This was a landmark case, as it was the first time that an organized hunt was prosecuted as a corporate body. The Heythrop Hunt, its Huntsman and its Senior Master all pleaded guilty to four charges of illegally hunting a fox. Heythrop Hunt hounds maul a fox on 29 February 2012 A major reason why some hunts have been prosecuted and convicted successfully is because of the availability of compelling evidence, gathered by hunt monitors, whose footage of certain, organized hunts' illegal activities has provided important evidence, necessary to bring illegal hunters to justice. Hunt monitors have been subjected to threats, assault, damage to their cars, cameras and radios, as well as verbal abuse, obstruction and intimidation. On 13 February 2013, Chris Williamson, MP led a debate in The House of Commons, entitled Policing of Violence at Hunts, to highlight, as he put it \\"... the antisocial and criminal behaviour ...\\" directed towards hunt monitors by some hunt supporters. In 2014, The RSPCA commissioned an independent review of its prosecution activity.RSPCA Wooler Review Final Sept 2014 In the review, Stephen Wooler, CB refers several times to hunt monitors, e.g., \\"The volume of footage available [taken by hunt monitors] leaves the objective viewer in no doubt on the balance of probabilities that it is ‚Äòbusiness as usual‚Äô for many hunts because enforcement is so difficult.\\" While some hunt monitors are employed by organizations and charities, such as The League Against Cruel Sports and International Fund for Animal Welfare, most are private individuals, who are unpaid and self-funded. Some hunt monitors accept donations to support their activities, made through social media sites, such as GoFundMe and Facebook.

He currently resides in London, England after his arrest, torture, and conviction in Bahrain for political crimes. Early life Prior to his entry into political activism, Abbas Al Omran worked in the oil industry at Bahrain Petroleum Company, also known as Bapco. His time, however, was short-lived after Al Omran was found communicating to the media regarding poor reviews on Bapco. The company then proceeded to dismiss him from his position after they had already banned him from the company's e-mail. Political Activism Abbas Al Omran is a member of the British-based Bahrain Centre for Human Rights. He is a primary activist for Bahrain that now resides in the United Kingdom after he was arrested and tortured. Although he has recently resided in London, he was put on the list of wanted persons in 2011 in Bahrain. Involvement In 2009, Al Omran was physically abused, along with Ali Mushaima, by a group of three that were said to be of African descent. In this attack, Al Omran suffered several injuries including swelling of his right eye, lower right shoulder, knees and elbow. Al Omran and Mushaima were known in the London area for their peaceful protests because Al Omran is a human rights activist. In Bahrain in 2013, the use of protest masks, also known as Guy Fawkes masks, have been banned and the country has strictly shut down the import of these masks. Al Omran became involved in this issue, as he stated in an interview with The Cutting Edge News that \\"he didn't think the ban would have much effect, as there are already many of the masks already in Bahrain, and the masks can still be sneaked in or even made at home.\\" Conviction On September 29, 2013, roughly 50 individuals were tried under the terrorism laws, including many Bahrain Centre of Human Rights members. Among the accused was Al Omran. This case is known as the \\"February 14th Coalition.\\" Al Omran was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment. However, in an interview regarding the court case, Maryam al-Khawaja, who is the President of the Bahrain Centre of Human Rights, was quoted saying, \\"There was no due process in the entirety of this case which is why the defendants and their lawyers decided to boycott. From the time that the defendants were abducted, tortured and then sentences, nothing was done according to international standards of a fair trial. If these fifty people were really guilty of a crime, why was the only evidence presented confessions extracted under torture? This was a sham trial with a political verdict, they should be released immediately.\\" See also * Bahrain Centre for Human Rights * Torture in Bahrain * Abdulhadi al-Khawaja * Maryam al-Khawaja References Bahraini dissidents Bahraini human rights activists Politics of Bahrain Living people Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Abbas Al Omran"},{"id":"46554498","text":"is a 2015 Japanese comedy drama film directed by Hajime Hashimoto.
