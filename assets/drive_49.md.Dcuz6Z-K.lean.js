He is Professor and Museum Director at the Macquarie University History Museum in Sydney, Australia and the Director of the Qubbet el-Hawa Research Project (QHRP) in Aswan, Egypt. He has published widely on ancient Egyptian mortuary liturgies, rituals and religious texts spanning the Old Kingdom to the Christian era. In archaeology, he has examined the Old and Middle Kingdom settlement remains and the 18th Dynasty temple of Khnum at Elephantine as well as the Old and Middle Kingdom Lower Necropolis at Qubbet el-Hawa. As a museum director, his focus is on historical anthropology, decolonisation and the repatriation of illicitly trafficked artefacts. Academia Martin Bommas studied Egyptology at the University of Heidelberg, completing his M.A. in 1994 and his PhD in 2000. During this period, he worked in the Egyptological Institute of Heidelberg as a research associate in the library (1988) and a tutor of undergraduate students in Egyptology (1991-1994) before becoming Lecturer in Egyptology (1994-2002). Following his time in Heidelberg, he was appointed Assistant Professor at the Egyptological Seminar at the University of Basel in 2001-2004 and Lecturer in Egyptology in 2004-2006. During this period, he also taught Egyptology at the University of Rome (2004), the University of Zurich (2005), and the University of Sheffield (2006). In 2006 he was appointed Senior Lecturer in Egyptology at the University of Birmingham where he taught extensively in the fields of Egyptology and archaeology, and in 2014 he was selected as Reader in Egyptology at the university. He remained in this position until 2018 when he accepted his position as Museum Director at Macquarie University. He served as the editor-in-chief of the Journal of Egyptian Archaeology from 2014-2018. Since 2008 he has also been the editor-in-chief of the Cultural Memory and History in Antiquity series of Bloomsbury publishing.  Philology  In 1994, Martin Bommas began working on religious texts at the University of Leiden, studying the early New Kingdom Papyrus Leiden I 346 on ancient Egyptian epagomenal texts (published 1999). Between 1994 and 2008, together with Jan Assmann, he edited and published Ancient Egyptian Mortuary Liturgies. Based on a papyrus from the Middle Kingdom held in Moscow, he reconstructed the ritual of investiture carried out for both living and dead pharaohs, published in 2013.  Archaeology  Martin Bommas began his archaeological work in Pakistan in 1990 where he participated in survey and excavation work in the Karakorum region in association with the Academy of Sciences, Heidelberg. He then joined the German Archaeological Institute's mission in Elephantine, Egypt in 1990 as a research associate before being made field director in 1991. Notably, this role was maintained during the Gulf Crisis. He continued to work at Elephantine until 2009 and during this period he contributed significantly to the reconstruction of the 18th Dynasty temple of Khnum, the restoration and reconstruction of the monumental gate of Amenhotep II and Ptolemy I which once stood in the southern temenos wall of the temple of Satet, and the discovery of a First Intermediate Period/Middle Kingdom settlement north of the Sanctuary of Heqaib. Since 2015 he has directed the ‚ÄúQubbet el-Hawa Research Project‚Äù (QHRP) in Aswan, now a joint excavation between Macquarie University and the Egypt Exploration Society. Among the notable discoveries at the site was the causeway of Sarenput I, which led him to receive the Luxor Times Top 10 Discoveries award in 2017. In 2016 he also discovered the Lower Necropolis of Qubbet el-Hawa dating to the Old and Middle Kingdoms.  Museums  In the museum sector, Martin Bommas has contributed to the establishment and maintenance of temporary and permanent exhibitions around the world. He acted as a consulting Egyptologist for the establishment of the new Archaeological Museum at Elephantine in Egypt (1995-1998) and for an exhibition on Egypt in Graeco-Roman times at the St√§dtische Galerie Liebieghaus in Frankfurt (2003-2005), as well as a consulting archaeologist for a permanent exhibition on Egyptian gods in the Aegean world at the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki. Between 2010 and 2018 he served as Curator of the Eton Myers Collection of Egyptian Art at the University of Birmingham. In 2018 he moved to Macquarie University in Sydney to occupy the role of Museum Director at the Macquarie University History Museum. This Museum is part of the Arts Precinct (opened 2020) at the University and the collection comprises over 18,000 objects that span ancient cultures around the world to modern Australian history. In his role as Museum Director, Martin Bommas directed the Museum‚Äôs layout and he oversees the collection.  Non- Archaeological Discoveries  Some notable achievements in Martin Bommas‚Äô career include the discovery of several papyrus fragments. In 1998, he published the long lost fragments of the magical Papyrus Harris 501 that he discovered in the Von-Portheim Stiftung, Heidelberg. Between 2016 and 2017, he was resident Getty Research Scholar at the Getty Villa in Los Angeles where he discovered a large collection of unpublished hieratic papyri, mainly stemming from the Book of the Dead. This material has been published in the Google Arts & Culture online exhibition: The Getty Book of the Dead. At the Nicholson Museum at the University of Sydney, he discovered, translated and researched more unpublished papyri fragments, including a papyrus dating to the earliest period of Islam in Egypt.  Media  Martin Bommas has participated in various media productions, such as The Verb with Ian McMillan, Jenny Uglow, Julian Glover, Amy Cooke-Hodgson and Rachel Parris. In 2016, he was featured with Dr Eman Khalifa on Radio Cairo's World of Info. Presenting new discoveries made by the QHRP at Qubbet el-Hawa, both were featured in the UK national TV Channel 5 series \\"Egyptian Tomb Hunting with Tony Robinson\\", shown on 27-28 November 2018.

On the side, he wrote children's literature. Several of his novels were successful in their own right during the 1980s and 1990s. Pornography During his youth, he had developed a taste for pornography and considered himself a \\"voyeur\\". At 35, after several years of marriage, he had a \\"mid-life crisis\\". In 1994, as an experiment, he created an interactive pornographic CD- ROM, the first of its kind in France, which was bought and distributed by the French version of Penthouse and met an unexpected success. He subsequently created his own production company with the aim of developing children's television programs. However, he was unable to find buyers for his projects and, to make ends meet, started creating new porn CD-ROMS. Since he had become relatively well known as a children's writer, he started using the alias \\"John B. Root\\". \\"B. Root\\" is a play on the French slang word biroute, meaning penis, while \\"John Root\\" is a literal translation in English of Jean Racine's name.Carr√© Rose : interview avec le r√©alisateur John B Root, eklecty-city.fr, 8 July 2017 For several years, he created a series of pornographic CD-ROMs, two of which won the award for best European CD-ROM at the Brussels International Festival of Eroticism.Jacques Zimmer (edited by), Le Cin√©ma X, La Musardine, Paris 2012, p. 456 In 1996, he directed for Canal+ his first feature film, Cyberix, which was the first interactive French porn fiction. The next year, he directed Sextet, a more classical feature, which cemented his reputation in the French porn industry. He soon became known for his unusually well-crafted scripts and imagery. His new career, however, caused his wife to divorce him. He quickly developed in France a reputation as an \\"intellectual\\" porn director,Inkorrektes: John B.

He also attracted media attention by speaking out in favor of \\"quality porn\\" and insisting that adult films could be a legitimate art form.'There's no reason why a porn film can't also be a good film', The Guardian, 28 August 2002 In 1998, he wrote and open letter to the French Ministry of Culture in which he pleaded that porn should receive public funding like other forms of entertainment.Projection Privee.

He has always insisted that his performers use condoms, with the exception of those who are legitimate partners outside their work in porn. He has stated that one of his goals is to avoid sexism and misogyny in his films, by not depicting sexual situations that could be perceived as demeaning to women.#Toutsexplique: On a pass√© une heure chez John B.Root, 20 Minutes, 12 August 2016 He has also been one of the first French pornographers to use the Internet.

Over the years, he directed hundreds of videos for his website. For several years during the 2000s he concentrated on gonzo content, as he found the production of feature films to be too difficult and costly.

Acoustic Highway, co-written and co-produced by keyboardist Ozzie Ahlers, was released on June 11, 1993, through the Higher Octave label. The album was an immediate musical and critical success, becoming Billboard magazine's #1 Indie New Age Album of the year.  Background  When Chaquico left Starship in 1990, he began looking for a new musical direction, opting for a solo career as a jazz and new age instrumentalist to showcase his acoustic music.  Recording  The album was recorded at Chaquico's Lunatunes Studio in Mill Valley, California, mixed at Auravision Studios in Ojai, California, and mastered at Quad Tech Studios in Los Angeles.  Music and lyrics  The album features nature-conscious songs such as \\"Return of the Eagle\\", \\"Mountain in the Mist\\", and \\"Land of the Giants\\". Chaquico produced distinctive \\"rippling, glistening, fluid tones\\" by processing his customized Washburn acoustic guitar through electronic effects. Chaquico includes elements that draw from new age, contemporary and smooth jazz compositions while containing subtle undertones of Native American influences. Chaquico's original recording of his jazz track \\"Sacred Ground\\" was included on the original Harley Davidson Road Song Collection in 1994, alongside classic rock songs such as \\"Born to Be Wild\\", \\"Rockin' Down the Highway\\" and a song by his former band, Jefferson Starship, \\"Ride the Tiger\\".  Critical reception and accolades  Besides becoming Billboard magazine's #1 Indie New Age Album of the year, it also won the Bammie (Bay Area Music) Award for Best Independent Album of 1993. It charted in the top 10 of the GAVIN Adult Alternative chart in the same year.http://www.americanradioresearch.com/Archive-Gavin- Report/90/93/Gavin-1993-10-01.pdf  Track listing  All tracks were written by Craig Chaquico and Ozzie Ahlers.

They are electronically related to acetylenes but are usually more reactive due to the polarity.  Structure and Bonding  Parent compound HB‚â°NH  Lewis Resonance Structure of HBNH. For iminoboranes, two resonance structures mainly contribute to the final structure (Figure 1). Substituent effect  Because the substituents can donate their lone pairs into one of the B-N anti-bonding orbitals, the bonding scheme can be dramatically altered when substitution occurs, and the new bonding scheme highly depends on the nature of substituents and the site of substitution, which can be investigated theoretically. HBNH HBNH is an intermediate from the photolysis of solid H3BNH3 Strong shielding effect of bulky substitutions can make the iminoboranes more stable and more resistant to oligomerization, which allows for the storage at room temperature. 282x282px Thermal decomposition of azidoboranes and trimethyl- silyl(trimethylsilyloxy)aminoboranes can be used to access symmetric iminoboranes, especially those with bulky R groups.frameless  Reactivity   Oligomerization  Iminoboranes tend to oligomerize. Five types of oligomerization product are mainly produced: cyclodimers (1,3,2,4-diazadiboretidines, Di), cyclotrimers (borazines, Tr), bicyclotrimers (Dewar borazines, Tr‚Äô), cyclotetramers (octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetraza-2,4,6,8-tetraborocines, Te), and polymers (polyiminoboranes, Po); which are shown below. Which product is dominant depends on the structures of reactants and the reaction conditions. Some of the products can be interconverted. frameless  Polar Addition  = Acid = If there is a œÄ-electron donating group such as -NR2 connected to B, the neutral Lewis acids can be bonded to the N atom of the B‚â°N. The product shown in the following scheme is a famous diaminoboron cation [C9H18N=B=NR2]+, where the positive charge is balanced intramolecularly, not by a external anion. 401x401px = Base = The 11BNMR signals of iminoboranes can be altered when the iminoboranes are dissolved in liquid with Lewis base activity (tertiary amines, tetrahydrofuran). There may be interactions between the positive-charged B and the Lewis base, but the chemistry behind this still needs to be further investigated.Figure 7: addition of iminoboranes with protic agents. H-Y can be HCl, tBuOH, Et2NH, iPr2NH, tBuNH2, (Me3Si)2NH. = Addition of protic agents = The addition of protic agents is a quantitive reaction, fast even far below 0 ‚ÑÉ, while the addition of protic agents of acetylenes requires higher temperature, which also indicates that iminoboranes are more reactive towards polar addition than acetylenes. = Boration = Boration reaction of iminoboranes is the addition of B-X single bond to B‚â°N, where -X can be -Cl (chloro-boration), -N3 (azido-boration), -SR (thio- boration), -NR2 (amino-boration) and R (alkyl-boration). One of these reactions are illustrated here. frameless = Cycloadditions = Cycloaddition is the addition of œÄ bond to B‚â°N, and can be categorized into [2+2]-cycloadditions, [2+3]-cycloadditions, [2+4]-cycloadditions etc. One of the widely investigated [2+2]-cycloadditions is the reaction of aldehydes and ketones with iminoboranes, which has two possible pathways. Usually, the relatively stable iminoboranes which are less likely to undergo the total opening of B‚â°N, and the ketones containing enolic protons, prefer to undergo path b. The typical [2+3]-cycloaddition is the addition of B‚â°N and RN3,and the typical [2+4]-cycloaddition is the addition of B‚â°N and cyclopentadiene.frameless  Coordination to transition metals  Like acetylenes, iminoboranes can also coordinate with transition metals. frameless  References  Boranes Amines ","title":"Iminoborane"},{"id":"55362873","title":"Timandra (1814 ship)"},{"id":"55362890","title":"2017‚Äì18 Oklahoma State Cowboys basketball team"},{"id":"55362891","text":"Killabakh is a small village located on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales, and north east of the state capital, Sydney.

The standoff ended after diplomatic negotiations. In 2012, the two countries resolved their maritime boundary disputes at an international tribunal. Background The Bay of Bengal has large untapped reserves of oil and natural gas. In November 2008, Myanmar allowed the South Korean company Daewoo to explore the seabed in an area 50 nautical miles south-west of St. Martin's Island. The area was contested between Bangladesh and Myanmar as part of their respective exclusive economic zones. Standoff Citing international law, Bangladesh asserted that Myanmar should not allow exploration activities in disputed territories until a resolution. After Bangladeshi requests were not heeded, the Bangladesh Navy deployed three warships in the area, including the BNS Abu Bakr, BNS Madhumati and BNS Nirbhoy. Myanmar deployed at least two naval vessels. Negotiations The Government of Bangladesh said Myanmar was operating well within disputed territory. The Foreign Secretary of Bangladesh Towhid Hossain summoned the Myanmar ambassador and later himself flew to Yangon with a team of Bangladeshi diplomats. Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, the interim Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, vowed that his country would protect its sovereignty and territory with \\"all necessary measures\\". There was no statement from Myanmar. Withdrawal On 7 November 2008, it was reported that Myanmar withdrew its warships and Daewoo began to remove its equipment from the area.

It depicts the Vorticist group gathered at a French restaurant in London. Description The painting shows a crowded table inside the restaurant of the H√¥tel de la Tour Eiffel at 1 Percy Street, London. Around the table are the key members of Vorticism, a British abstract art movement that flourished briefly in the 1910s. The six seated men are, from left to right: Cuthbert Hamilton, Ezra Pound, William Roberts, Wyndham Lewis, Frederick Etchells and Edward Wadsworth. Etchells holds a copy of the first issue of the Vorticist magazine Blast. In the doorway to the left are the movement's two female members, Jessica Dismorr and Helen Saunders. Standing to the right are the waiter Joe and the restaurant's proprietor, Rudolph Stulik. Creation The Tour Eiffel restaurant had been visited frequently by the Poets' Club of T. E. Hulme, including F. S. Flint and Ezra Pound, and thus had been a centre for Imagism. It became a favourite location for the literary circles around Augustus John, Wyndham Lewis and Nancy Cunard, which through Lewis included the Vorticists. It was where the magazine Blast was launched in June 1914. In a 1957 piece for The Listener, Roberts reminisced about the relationship between Vorticism and the restaurant: > In my memory la cuisine Fran√ßaise and Vorticism are indissolubly linked. > Both Signor Rossi of the Etoile, and M. Rudolph Stulik of the Tour Eiffel > should rank in the records of Vorticism as honorary members of the 'Group'. > Lewis who liked good food, and fine wine to go with it, kept a ringed > serviette in each of these restaurants. If, as he claimed, Vorticism was the > expression of a new philosophy, then it must be the newness of Rabelais, and > of old Omar Khayyam's 'A jug of wine, a loaf of bread and thou beside me > singing'. Nor was it developed in the gloom of a studio, but at the Tour > Eiffel over a tourne-dos and a bottle of Burgundy. The first and only exhibition of the Vorticist group was held in June 1915 at the Dor√© Gallery in London. In addition to the artists present in Roberts' painting, the exhibition featured Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, Bernard Adeney, Lawrence Atkinson, David Bomberg, Duncan Grant, Jacob Kramer and Christopher R. W. Nevinson. Provenance The painting was purchased from the artist by Tate in 1962 through the Chantrey Bequest.

Life Kilpack was born in Covent Garden in London. Her father, Thomas, was the proprietor of a popular tobacconists and bowling alley called Gliddon's Divan. She was a talented but shy child, enjoying artistic pursuits including drawing and music. As a young woman she became a King's Scholar at the Royal Academy of Music, under the tutelage of Kate Loder. She became an Associate of the Academy and began a career as a pianist, performing in concerts and providing tuition. Income from her musical work enabled her to travel outside of London, where she would sketch. The family became more dependent on the income from her concert playing particularly after the death of her mother in 1863. At this time she first travelled to the Channel Islands where she became a frequent visitor. She remained somewhat distrustful of people, which is reflected in the stormy nature of many of her paintings. In 1876, following the demise of her father, she gave up music and concentrated on art. She became a very successful artist with a particular focus on marine art, exhibiting 119 landscapes at the Society of Women Artists between 1867 and 1909, and also at the British Institution. In the early 1880s she was earning about ¬£500 a year from painting. She died in 1909 of cancer. Legacy In 1989, a series of stamps was issued to mark the 150th anniversary of Sarah Louisa Kilpack's birth, highlighting her importance in the culture of Jersey. Her works are exhibited in the Jersey Museum and Art Gallery, and in the Rona Cole Art Gallery on Guernsey.

The song was written by Bob Saker and Jack Winsley, and produced by Chas Chandler. It failed to make an appearance in the UK charts. Background Following the lack of commercial success of their 1969 debut Beginnings, Ambrose Slade, with their new manager Chas Chandler, began considering their next career move. Having not been pleased with the debut album, Chandler thought the band would benefit from writing their own material and a change of image. He decided that the band should project a skinhead image in the effort to generate interest in the band. Both guitarist Dave Hill and bassist Jim Lea were mortified by the revised image, but the band agreed to try the idea and adopted Dr Marten boots, braces, cropped hair and aggressive \\"bovver boy\\" posturing.Beginnings/Play It Loud - 2006 Salvo remaster booklet liner notes Coinciding with the new image, Ambrose Slade changed their name to \\"The Slade\\". Shortly afterwards, Chandler was sent \\"Wild Winds Are Blowing\\" by a publishing company. He felt the song, written by Bob Saker and Jack Winsley, was perfect for Slade and had them record it. Released in October 1969 on Fontana, the single failed to chart. In a 1977 interview, drummer Don Powell singled out the song as the only one embarrassing to him and the band. He said: \\"There's only one, \\"Wild Winds are Blowing\\", but that wasn't one of our songs anyway. That came from the office at Brook Street. We didn't know any better in those days.\\" Lead vocalist Noddy Holder later recalled in his 1999 biography Who's Crazee Now?: \\"It was a good pop-rock song, not too commercial. It was really our first proper single, although we had released two tracks from Beginnings, neither of which was ever going to be a hit.\\" Release \\"Wild Winds Are Blowing\\" was released on 7\\" vinyl by Fontana Records in the UK, Germany and the Netherlands. Both the German and Dutch releases came in a colour picture sleeve. The B-side, \\"One Way Hotel\\", was written by Lea, Holder and drummer Don Powell. The song was initially exclusive to the single, but would soon appear as an album track on the band's 1970 album Play It Loud. The original 1969 B-side version features jazzier guitar parts that were removed or replaced for the version that appeared on Play It Loud.B-Sides - 2006 Salvo remaster booklet liner notes \\"Wild Winds Are Blowing\\" later received greater recognition when it was included on the band's 1973 compilation album Sladest.

To further promote the song, the band made their first national TV appearance on Alan Price's Monster Music Mash. The band performed \\"Wild Winds Are Blowing\\" live, along with a cover of The Beatles' \\"Martha My Dear\\", which they had covered on Beginnings.

Rev Guy Ramsay was President of the Baptist Union of Scotland during the late 1940s. Early life Robert Guy Ramsay was born in Maybole, Ayrshire, in south-west Scotland in 1895. His father was the Baptist lay preacher and industrialist Thomas Ramsay, associated with establishing Maybole Baptist Church, where he served as pastor from 1901-1919. The family had historical roots in Ayrshire. Robert Guy Ramsay's uncle, James Ramsay, was provost of Maybole during the 1910s. He attended High School of Glasgow, Glasgow University, and following war service, the Baptist Theological College of Scotland (1918‚Äì22), all located in Glasgow, Scotland. Career Great War service (1915-1917) During the Great War, Robert Guy Ramsay was commissioned into the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles), in 1915, through the Inns of Court regiment in London, and served as Lieutenant in France. He was invalided from the regiment on medical grounds in 1917. Baptist minister (1918-1970) Following his Great War service, Rev R Guy Ramsay held seven consecutive Baptist pastorates spanning half-a-century. While studying at the Baptist Theological College of Scotland (1918-1922) Rev Guy Ramsay was elected a student pastor to Kirkintilloch Baptist Church, with a congregation numbering 200. After completing his theological college accreditations, in 1922, Rev Guy Ramsay made a preaching tour of the United States and Canada, after which he accepted a full pastorate to Dunfermline West Baptist Church in the east of Scotland. In the 1930s, after two more ministries in England, he was appointed by Horfield Baptist Church, then one of the largest churches in the United Kingdom, with a congregation exceeding a thousand. During the Second World War, Rev Guy Ramsay provided ministry during the Blitz aerial bombing of London, including Church services and support to London-based families in north London. This included, for example, services for young children at Ebeneezer Baptist Church in the summer of 1942. He later wrote of surviving the Blitz, \\"When the German bombers were roaring over London, one had occasionally a strange kind of feeling that they were after you personally. But it was a fleeting ephemeral mood, dispelled each morning by the rising sun.‚Äù Rev Guy Ramsay returned to Scotland in 1943, accepting the pastorate of Hillhead Baptist Church in 1943, his seventh and final ministry, where he served for nearly three decades. As one highlight of his ministry, in 1955, members of Hillhead Baptist Church facilitated contact between visiting New Zealand clergyman Lloyd Crawford and the American evangelist Billy Graham. This led to Billy Graham visiting New Zealand in the 1950s. Graham was in Glasgow for a six-week visit, stressing spiritual and euphoric aspects of evangelism. This received mixed views from Scottish Baptist ministers more focused on practical interpretations and guidance. The complete list of Rev Guy Ramsay's ministries were: * 1918-1922: Kirkintilloch Baptist Church, Dunbartonshire, Scotland (concurrent with studies at Baptist Theological College of Scotland) * 1922-1924: West Baptist Church, Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland * 1924-1930: Accrington Baptist Church, Lancashire, England * 1930-1936: Letchworth Baptist Church, Hertfordshire, England * 1936-1939: Horfield Baptist Church, Bristol, England * 1939-1943: Ferme Park Baptist Church, Hornsey, London * 1943-1970, his retirement: Hillhead Baptist Church, Glasgow, Scotland President of the Baptist Union of Scotland (1948-1949) Rev Guy Ramsay was elected president in 1948, thirty years into his ministry. His commencement address, delivered in Aberdeen, stressed the importance of reducing Church divisions. He was the fourth minister from Hillhead Baptist Church to be president of the Baptist Union of Scotland. Rev Guy Ramsay's father, Thomas Ramsay, of Maybole Baptist Church, was a past President of the Baptist Union of Scotland in the 1920s. Shortly after assuming the presidency, Rev Guy Ramsay marked the golden jubilee (fifty year anniversary) of Dundee Baptist Church in 1948. Rev Guy Ramsay retained active interest in the Scottish Baptist community as a result of the presidency. In 1950, for example, he spoke at the Baptist Missionary Society, in Stirling; in 1952 he inducted new Baptist ministers in Aberdeen; in 1952, he opened the Christian Youth Assembly in Glasgow; in 1954 he spoke at Dundee Christian Conference and provided Christian service to the Glasgow Boys' Brigade. Plaque commemorating Rev R Guy Ramsay at Hillhead Baptist Church, Glasgow, Scotland During the 1950s, he continued a theme from his presidency, warnIng against the decline in church numbers and rise of secularism within Scotland and around the world. He sought greater unity among religious denominations, and stressed: ‚ÄúWe use the same Bible. We sing the same hymns, and we hold the same fundamental doctrines of the faith. Religious competitive enterprise should be left behind.‚Äù Writing Rev Guy Ramsay published three books, all with Christian themes and connected to his preaching. * Since the World Began: Studies in Genesis (1927). * Christ's portrait of a Christian: A series of studies on 'The Sermon on the Mount (1947).

She received her bachelor's degree from the University of California, Berkeley in 1972 and later went on to get her PhD in Geology from Stanford University in 1977. She is best known for her contribution in determining the correlation between sedimentary deposits and plate tectonics. By the 1980s the exploration of hydrocarbons and a continuation of tectonic studies in the Pacific Northwest area of the United States led to a need of increased knowledge of the Tertiary sedimentary basins and Suczek's mapping of the area. Professor In her professional career, Suczek was a professor emeritus at Western Washington University for nearly 40 years. Some of the courses she taught were stratigraphy, sedimentation, physical and historical geography. Suczek also held a seat on the Auditing Committee for the Paleontological Society. Suczek was a known mentor to many of her students, especially her female students. She was known for always speaking her mind and leading the way for women in a field that is still underrepresented by females. Along with being a successful professor and sedimentary geologist Suczek also had a son and a granddaughter. Suczek died on April 10, 2014 at age 71, at her home in Bellingham, after being ill for over a year with pancreatic cancer. Scientific work Suczek's first major contribution to the scientific world of plate tectonics came in the form of her dissertation that she composed while completing her Ph.D. at Stanford University (1977). In her dissertation, she studied the Upper Cambrian Harmony Formation in Northern Nevada, in an intent to prove if any of the plate tectonic models could be accurate. Throughout her study, Suczek develops two models in an attempt to describe plate tectonic behaviour in connection with the Upper Cambrian Harmony Formation. Out of these two models Suczek found evidence to believe that the passive continental margin model seemed to be most likely as it lasted until the end of Cambrian time and a time constraint of 650 million years of spreading event are met. A lack of volcanic ash can also be accounted for with the passive continental margin model. Suczek does note that some problems remain even with this model such as the nature of crust under the miogeocline and the continued finding of almost pure quartzite in the eugeocline. Suczek herself notes that further study to find comparisons between the harmony foundation, Northern Sierra, Klamath Mountains, Shoofly Moffett Creek and Antelope Mountain could lead to more evidence supporting this model. Publication In 1983, Suczek published a journal article on Disaggregation of quartzites in the Journal of Sedimentary Petrology. She explained that the common method of analyzing grain sizes was through sieving and that this method was very time-consuming and the results are not accurate (apart from the median and graphic means). Instead, she proposed and described a method where the cement is dissolved by hydrofluoric acid to isolate the quartzites. She built this off of a model developed by Pessagno and Newport. Her method is more efficient as the immersion is only 30 minutes long. Suczek worked with Raymond V. Ingersoll (from the Department of Earth and Space Science at the University of California) in 1985 to publish their work in the Journal of Sedimentary Research on Petrology and provenance of Cenozoic sand from the Indus Cone and the Arabian Basin. The article describes the uplifted gneissic, sedimentary and metasedimentary terrane of the western Himalayas that was produced by the closing of the ocean between India and Asia. They were trying to test if the sand from the Arabian Basin was derived from the Himalayas to find out what petrographic characteristics were present. They then compared samples with the sand from the Bengal and Nicobar Fans. This comparison would help explain tectonic movements in the region from convergence and collision of India and Asia causing the Himalayan orogenic belt. In order to do this, they used samples from three of the Deep Sea Drilling Project's holes, counting the layers to find the Cenozoic sand. Using their findings, they compared results with other petrological data. Part of the discussion includes references to Suczek's previous work with others where they were attempting to find data to differentiate sand weathered off orogenic belts created by continental collision. The new data they found strongly suggests that parts of the samples show characteristics of the sands derived from collision zones as opposed to Atlantic-type margins. There is a reference to papers she collaborated on in 1979 where triangular diagrams were used to differentiate sands of different tectonic provenance. However, in the paper 6 years later they decided to use the QpLvmLsm plot instead of as it visibly illustrates their sands as part of the group of sands derived from continental collisions and distinct from other groups. Finally, the conclusion explains that two out of the three Deep Sea Drilling Project samples were derived from the Himalayas and the third sample was a combination of Himalayan and Arabian sources. Also, the Arabian Sea samples matched the sand samples from the Bengal and Nicobar Fans. Paleogeographic evolution paper In 1986 and then revised in 1987, Suczek along with Paul Heller and Rowland Tabor published their paper on paleogeographic evolution of the United States Pacific Northwest during Paleogene Time in the Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences. This work was to brief the paleogeographic history of the area during Paleogene times. To do this Suczek, Heller and Tabor looked at igneous, sedimentary and deformational histories which then allowed them to create a series of paleogeographic maps. This study resulted in the description of three main phases of Paleogene basin evolution. The first phase consisted of formation due to the collision of oceanic islands which occurred along the continental margin. Sediments found in this phase were created from orogenic highlands. The second phase had formed within a broad forearc region and was marked by rapid subsidence of individual basins. Due to extension, maybe in conjunction with transcurrent faulting, nonmarine basins had formed. Found in both the marine and nonmarine basins were rapid sedimentation that was made up of sandstone from cretaceous plutonic sources far to the east. The third and final phase was marked by the growing Cascade volcanic arc which had begun in early Oligocene times. This growth in the volcanic arc caused changes to the basin makeup. The Cascade Range would divert streams carrying eastern derived material, reduce sedimentation rates in the coastal basins and provide a local source of volcanic detritus.

MR imaging was invented by Paul C. Lauterbur who developed a mechanism to encode spatial information into an NMR signal using magnetic field gradients in September 1971; he published the theory behind it in March 1973. The factors leading to image contrast (differences in tissue relaxation time values) had been described nearly 20 years earlier by physician and scientist Erik Odeblad and Gunnar Lindstr√∂m. Among many other researchers in the late 1970s and 1980s, Peter Mansfield further refined the techniques used in MR image acquisition and processing, and in 2003 he and Lauterbur were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their contributions to the development of MRI. The first clinical MRI scanners were installed in the early 1980s and significant development of the technology followed in the decades since, leading to its widespread use in medicine today. Nuclear magnetic resonance In 1950, spin echoes and free induction decay were first detected by Erwin Hahn and in 1952, Herman Carr produced a one-dimensional NMR spectrum as reported in his Harvard PhD thesis. The next step (from spectra to imaging) was proposed by Vladislav Ivanov in Soviet Union, who filed in 1960 a patent application for a Magnetic Resonance Imaging device.–ü–†–ò–í–ï–¢ –ù–û–ë–ï–õ–Æ –û–¢ –ò–í–ê–ù–û–í–êPatents by Ivan Vladislav Ivanov's main contribution was the idea of using magnetic field gradient, combined with a selective frequency excitation/readout, to encode the spatial coordinates. In modern terms, it was only proton-density (not relaxation times) imaging, which was also slow since, only one gradient direction was used at a time and the imaging had to be done slice-by-slice. Nevertheless, it was a true Magnetic Resonance Imaging procedure. Originally rejected as \\"improbable\\", Ivanov's application was finally approved in 1984 (with the original priority date).  Relaxation times and early development of MRI  By 1959, Jay Singer had studied blood flow by NMR relaxation time measurements of blood in living humans. Such measurements were not introduced into common medical practice until the mid-1980s, although a patent for a whole-body NMR machine to measure blood flow in the human body was filed by Alexander Ganssen in early 1967.History of MRIFirst MAGNETOM scanner in the USA in 1983Nachruf auf Alexander Ganssen In the 1960s, the results of work on relaxation, diffusion, and chemical exchange of water in cells and tissues of various types appeared in the scientific literature. In 1967, Ligon reported the measurement of NMR relaxation of water in the arms of living human subjects. In 1968, Jackson and Langham published the first NMR signals from a living animal, an anesthetized rat. In the 1970s, it was realized that the relaxation times are key determinants of contrast in MRI and can be used to detect and differentiate a range of pathologies. A number of research groups had showed that early cancer cells tended to exhibit longer relaxation times than their corresponding normal cells and as such stimulated initial interest in the idea of detecting cancer with NMR. These early groups include Damadian , Hazlewood and Chang and several others. This also initiated a program to catalog the relaxation times of a wide range of biological tissues, which became one of the main motivations for the development of MRI . Raymond Damadian's \\"Apparatus and method for detecting cancer in tissue\\" In a March 1971 paper in the journal Science, Raymond Damadian, an Armenian-American doctor and professor at the Downstate Medical Center State University of New York (SUNY), reported that tumors and normal tissue can be distinguished in vivo by NMR. Damadian's initial methods were flawed for practical use, relying on a point-by-point scan of the entire body and using relaxation rates, which turned out not to be an effective indicator of cancerous tissue. While researching the analytical properties of magnetic resonance, Damadian created a hypothetical magnetic resonance cancer-detecting machine in 1972. He patented such a machine, on February 5, 1974. Lawrence Bennett and Dr. Irwin Weisman also found in 1972 that neoplasms display different relaxation times than corresponding normal tissue. Zenuemon Abe and his colleagues applied the patent for a targeted NMR scanner, on 1973. They published this technique in 1974. Damadian claims to have invented the MRI. The US National Science Foundation notes \\"The patent included the idea of using NMR to 'scan' the human body to locate cancerous tissue.\\" However, it did not describe a method for generating pictures from such a scan or precisely how such a scan might be done.  Imaging  Paul Lauterbur at Stony Brook University expanded on Carr's technique and developed a way to generate the first MRI images, in 2D and 3D, using gradients. In 1973, Lauterbur published the first nuclear magnetic resonance image and the first cross-sectional image of a living mouse in January 1974. In the late 1970s, Peter Mansfield, a physicist and professor at the University of Nottingham, England, developed the echo-planar imaging (EPI) technique that would lead to scans taking seconds rather than hours and produce clearer images than Lauterbur had. Damadian, along with Larry Minkoff and Michael Goldsmith, obtained an image of a tumor in the thorax of a mouse in 1976. They also performed the first MRI body scan of a human being on July 3, 1977, studies they published in 1977. In 1979, Richard S. Likes filed a patent on k-space . MRI Scanner Mark One. The first MRI scanner to be built and used, in Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in Scotland.  Full-body scanning  During the 1970s a team led by John Mallard built the first full-body MRI scanner at the University of Aberdeen. On 28 August 1980 they used this machine to obtain the first clinically useful image of a patient's internal tissues using MRI, which identified a primary tumour in the patient's chest, an abnormal liver, and secondary cancer in his bones. This machine was later used at St Bartholomew's Hospital, in London, from 1983 to 1993. Mallard and his team are credited for technological advances that led to the widespread introduction of MRI. In 1975, the University of California, San Francisco Radiology Department founded the Radiologic Imaging Laboratory (RIL). With the support of Pfizer, Diasonics, and later Toshiba America MRI, the lab developed new imaging technology and installed systems in the US and worldwide.http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt3199s1qf/admin/#ref732 Lawrence Crooks Radiologic Imaging Laboratory Records In 1981 RIL researchers, including Leon Kaufman and Lawrence Crooks, published Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Medicine. In the 1980s the book was considered the definitive introductory textbook to the subject. In 1980 Paul Bottomley joined the GE Research Center in Schenectady, New York. His team ordered the highest field-strength magnet then available, a 1.5 T system, and built the first high-field device, overcoming problems of coil design, RF penetration and signal-to-noise ratio to build the first whole-body MRI/MRS scanner. The results translated into the highly successful 1.5 T MRI product-line, delivering over 20,000 systems. In 1982, Bottomley performed the first localized MRS in the human heart and brain. After starting a collaboration on heart applications with Robert Weiss at Johns Hopkins, Bottomley returned to the university in 1994 as Russell Morgan Professor and director of the MR Research Division.  Additional techniques  In 1986, Charles L. Dumoulin and Howard R. Hart at General Electric developed MR angiography and Denis Le Bihan, obtained the first images and later patented diffusion MRI. In 1988, Arno Villringer and colleagues demonstrated that susceptibility contrast agents may be employed in perfusion MRI. In 1990, Seiji Ogawa at AT&T; Bell labs recognized that oxygen-depleted blood with dHb was attracted to a magnetic field, and discovered the technique that underlies Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). In the early 1990s, Peter Basser and Le Bihan working at NIH, and Aaron Filler, Franklyn Howe and colleagues published the first DTI and tractographic brain images. Joseph Hajnal, Young and Graeme Bydder described the use of FLAIR pulse sequence to demonstrate high signal regions in normal white matter in 1992. In the same year, arterial spin labelling was developed by John Detre and Alan P. Koretsky. In 1997, J√ºrgen R. Reichenbach, E. Mark Haacke and coworkers at Washington University developed Susceptibility weighted imaging. Advances in semiconductor technology were crucial to the development of practical MRI, which requires a large amount of computational power. Although MRI is most commonly performed in the clinic at 1.5 T, higher fields such as 3 T for clinical imaging and more recently 7 T for research purposes are gaining popularity because of their increased sensitivity and resolution. In research laboratories, human studies have been performed at 9.4 T (2006) and up to 10.5 T (2019). Non-human animal studies have been performed at up to 21.1 T.  Bedside imaging  In 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration proffered 510(k) approval of Hyperfine Research's bedside MRI system. The Hyperfine system claimed 20X lower cost, 35X lower power consumption, and 10X lower weight than conventional MRI systems. It uses a standard electrical outlet for power. 2003 Nobel Prize Reflecting the fundamental importance and applicability of MRI in medicine, Paul Lauterbur of the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign and Sir Peter Mansfield of the University of Nottingham were awarded the 2003 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their \\"discoveries concerning magnetic resonance imaging\\". The Nobel citation acknowledged Lauterbur's insight of using magnetic field gradients to determine spatial localization, a discovery that allowed the acquisition of 3D and 2D images. Mansfield was credited with introducing the mathematical formalism and developing techniques for efficient gradient utilization and fast imaging. The research that won the Prize was done almost 30 years earlier while Paul Lauterbur was a professor in the Department of Chemistry at Stony Brook University in New York.

Havea used the coconut to point to certain theological themes, such as the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ and God's action in the world. Though it has not been widely embraced by Oceanic churches, it marks the first significant attempt towards a Pacific theology.  Background  The call for a viable Pacific theology can be traced back to the founding of the Pacific Conference of Churches in 1976. At the Third Assembly of the PCC, Sir John Guise challenged Christians to begin looking for the Pacific Christ, rather than \\"a Christ who was white faced, thin lipped and blue eyed\\". He felt that the church could not relate to a Christ that was not a living reality in their context. The term coconut theology was first coined by Sione 'Amanaki Havea in 1985 in a paper he gave at a theological consultation in Suva, Fiji. Havea argued that when missionaries brought Christianity to the Pacific in the 19th century, they failed to remove it from Western culture and assumptions. It was brought in a \\"Western theological pot\\" and needed to be nurtured in \\"local soil\\". This became known as the \\"pot-plant transportation model\\" of contextualization. He proposed that Jesus chose symbols from his own Hebrew- Palestinian culture not because of their intrinsic value but because they were ubiquitous. However, many of these symbols, such as sheep, bread, ploughs, and olives, never existed in the Pacific islands before contact with the West. Therefore, Havea suggests, if Jesus had been born in the Pacific context, he would have used symbols that were more indicative of life there, such as coconuts, taro, and kava. He claimed that Jesus would have said \\"I am the coconut of life\\" rather than \\"I am the bread of life.\\"  Key principles  Coconut theology is based on the assumption that coconuts are essential to all life in the Pacific Islands. From this symbol, three theological categories are derived.  Christology  The coconut exemplifies the incarnation, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The coconut falls from the highest point on the tree, symbolizing Jesus' descent from God the Father. Then, the coconut rolls to the lowest point on the ground, representing Christ's humility, and if left, it will begin the process of dying. A shoot will push through the shell and the husk to form a new coconut tree. This is similar to the way that Jesus was left to die, but from his death new life comes forth.  Kairos  The coconut cannot mature faster or slower. It goes in its own time. This suggests that all things will happen in their own course and cannot be hurried by human intervention, the same way that we are subject to God's ordination of time. This is supported by the bible, such as Ecclesiastes 3:1‚Äì8 and Mark 1:15, that says that there is a time for everything.  Communion  The coconut has been used as the elements of the Lord's Supper. When it is broken, it provides both food and drink. This is in line with Havea's thinking that if Jesus were born in the Pacific, he would have used the local equivalents of bread and wine. The coconut can also be used in liturgy to dramatize the life and death of Jesus.  Critiques  One critique which has been raised again Havea's coconut theology has been that it focuses too much on Oceanic culture and traditions while straying too far away from the Bible. Havea's theology is based in the belief that the idea of Christ existed in the Pacific, and missionaries simply provided the full understanding of his personhood. Ma'afu Palu argues that, instead, Jesus should not be taken too far from how he is revealed in scriptures. Another accusation by Palu is that this concept of the Pacific Christ does not focus enough on the cross. While the symbol of death is present in the coconut, there is not the same notion of suffering and salvation as there is in the bible. The Pacific Christ presented focuses primarily on Christ's role as a good moral teacher. There is also suggestion from Randall Prior that the symbol of the coconut is not strong enough to be the total embodiment of a Pacific theology. He seems skeptical that it can hold up to global scrutiny against other theologies, like liberation theology, which was born out of a particular experience and struggle. The coconut alone cannot fully speak to the larger political and economic context of Oceania. There are also larger theological implications to using the coconut instead of bread and wine for the Eucharist, particularly for those holding to a higher understand of the sacraments.  Legacy  Though coconut theology never became a fully embraced contextual theology, it incited efforts from other Oceanic theologians to develop an appropriate Pacific theology. The former principal of the Pacific Theological College Ilaitia Suvati Tuwere thought that vanua, the Fijian word for \\"land\\", was important to salvation as a sign of God's redemptive power. He used traditional beliefs to highlight that humans must maintain a connection to the land in order to be renewed. Bishop Leslie Boseto of the United Church in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands took up the cause of Pacific theology by saying that the Gospel may be universal, but it must be translated into the local context. He saw a key characteristic of Pacific culture as being its strong sense of community and interdependence. Keiti Ann Kanongata'a focuses on the woman's experience and claims that the Gospel is a call of liberation from oppressive social structures. She likens the birthing process and the hope for new life that accompanies it to God's mercy. Seforosa Carroll also notes that one of the challenges facing Pacific Islanders is increasing migration of peoples which in turn leads to a feeling of a feeling of displacement. As a result, any Pacific theology must address the loss of belonging and home.

It is the largest Tibetan Buddhist monastery in Inner Mongolia, and was designated a Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level in 1996. Names Badekar Monastery has three names. One is Mongolian, which is Wudang Temple (); Wudang is a Chinese transliteration of the Mongolian word for willow, whilst zhao is a transliteration of the word for temple. Badekar is the Tibetan name and means white peony. The Chinese name is Guangjue Temple (), which was granted in 1756 by the Qianlong emperor. History The Qing government was a major patron of Tibetan Buddhism in Hohhot and Inner Mongolia more broadly. The association between the government and religion assisted the Qing in maintaining their power in Inner Mongolia. Badekar Monastery was built sometime after the Kangxi era as part of the rapid construction of Tibetan Buddhist structures. The monastery was expanded on a massive scale under the Qianlong emperor, reportedly to pacify the local Mongolian population after the Qing massacred a rebellious group from the Dzungar Basin. The complex also received generous grants and expansion under the Jiaqing emperor and Daoguang emperor. The monastery is located 54 km from Bugat, but was developed as a major tourist destination during the reforms of the 1980s. In 2001, the area around the monastery was declared a national park. Architecture In contrast to other Tibetan Buddhist institutions in Inner Mongolia, Badekar Monastery was constructed according to the layout of Tashi Lhunpo Monastery in Xigaz√™, thus it incorporates no Han-style architecture. All structures are positioned horizontally along the mountain, with halls along the central access ascending up into the mountains. Environment From the late 1990s, it was observed that much of the vegetation near the monastery was receding, streams were drying up, and desert was spreading. The problem has been exacerbated by heavy summer rains, which inundate the dry soil, washing it away. The area in front of the monastery has been urbanised and, in 2009, it was noted that very few willow trees could be found in its vicinity, despite them once having been plentiful.

Centrally located on the northern fringes of Gotha‚Äôs old town, it was completed in 1909. After prolonged use, the original building was closed in the 1980s due to its dilapidated state. In 2007 the baths underwent a thorough restoration, modernisation and expansion programme, the resultant surface area being more than twice that of the original building. The baths were reopened in 2014.  History  Gotha's historical Public Baths date back to 1905-09, a time when similar bathing facilities were being put up across Germany. Gotha's baths were designed and built under the supervision of Wilhelm Goette, the town's head of municipal planning. In common with public baths in other towns, those in Gotha consisted of a swimming hall, sauna as well as baths to wash in. The baths are Historicist in style, with strong Art Nouveau influences.Nils Meyer: Sanierung und Erweiterung des historischen Stadtbades in Gotha. Denkmalgesch√ºtzten Bestand respektieren und integrieren. AB Archiv des Badewesens 09/2014, S. 506‚Äì524 The restoration of the complex has created barrier-free facilities for families, schools and swimming clubs, as well as additional health and fitness and therapy treatments. As was the case in the original structure, the swimming hall remains at the heart of the complex. Other historical parts of the building, such as the domed sauna rooms, have been integrated into the modern design. A new sauna has been added, as have a competition-level 25 metre sports pool and a beginner's pool. Architect Nils Meyer, of Veauthier Meyer Architekten, Berlin, led the design and comprehensive renovation and extension of the baths, which received several architectural prizes. Arc Nova also carried out supervisory work and quality control. Swimming pool at the Stadtbad Gotha While initial projections placed the cost at around 12 million euros, the final cost turned out to be around 19 million, making it the largest infrastructure project in Germany since German reunification; the project took 23 years to go from initial planning to final completion, and was organised by a team of 30 people.  Layout  The extensions to Gotha's historical public baths have been designed in a clear but restrained architectural style. New parts of the building have been laid out in a linear fashion to the west and east of the historical swimming hall, which is set back from the historical building fa√ßade facing Bohnstedtstrasse. Linked by a new large staircase, the interior's principal spaces comprise the historical swimming hall with therapy pools and the new swimming hall, with its beginner's and children's pools as well as its main pool for both competition and recreational use. The main entrance to the original building on Bohnstedtstrasse remains the entrance to the newly restored baths. The oval vestibule, with its historical staircase and new lift, accesses both the upper floors and the changing area on the upper ground floor, from which the swimming pool can also be accessed. Synthesising old and new into a unified whole proved a challenge in many regards, in particular bringing the old buildings up to today's standards in terms of structural engineering and building physics, as well as acoustic and energy requirements. The same was true of fire safety and, in particular, updating the pool's technical facilities. From a design standpoint, the challenge lay in creating contemporary interiors that nonetheless harmonised with the building's historical context. Lighting and the careful use of colour were an important means of achieving this. The building extensions are of ferro-concrete construction. Ferro-concrete supports hold up pre-stressed, single-span concrete girders 20 metres wide and 1.4 metres high. The roof consists of plywood boards covered with insulated flat roofing material. Much care was taken to assess and restore the roof beams in the old buildings.

The branch was officially announced on July 18, 2015, and held its first show on February 25, 2016. In addition to NJPW wrestlers, the Lion's Gate Project shows also feature wrestlers from other promotions, resulting in unique cards. The events are held at Tokyo's Shinjuku Face. The first three shows featured heavy participation from wrestlers from the Pro Wrestling Noah promotion. Wrestlers from promotions such as All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), Big Japan Pro Wrestling (BJW) and Kaientai Dojo (K-Dojo) have also taken part in the project. NJPW rookies Takumi Honjo, Shota Umino, Tetsuhiro Yagi and Ren Narita have made their official debuts at Lion's Gate Project shows, while Katsuya Kitamura and Tomoyuki Oka wrestled their unofficial debuts as part of the project. History On July 18, 2015, NJPW held a press conference on various items relating to the future of the promotion. One of these was the establishment of a developmental branch, where NJPW could discover and develop both Japanese and foreign wrestlers. It was also intended as a place where trials could be held for outside wrestlers and where injured wrestlers could go to get back in shape. The plan was for the branch to eventually start running its own small shows. The project quickly drew comparisons to WWE's NXT developmental branch. NJPW had earlier attempted a developmental branch with a project named NEVER, which held shows between 2010 and 2012. Recently, NJPW had been described as \\"lax in cultivation of new talent\\", however, on January 3, 2016, the promotion introduced four new wrestlers with Hirai Kawato and Teruaki Kanemitsu wrestling their debut matches, while Katsuya Kitamura and Tomoyuki Oka were announced as the two newest recruits to the NJPW dojo. Dave Meltzer called the recruitment of the two former top amateur wrestlers \\"[p]robably the biggest move in a couple of years when it comes to new talent\\". The same day, NJPW announced that their developmental branch Lion's Gate would be holding its first show on February 25, 2016, in Tokyo's Shinjuku Face. Events Lion's Gate Project 1 The first Lion's Gate Project event was held on February 25, 2016, in Tokyo at Shinjuku Face. The event featured ten matches, including one dark match, an \\"exhibition match\\" featuring the unofficial debuts of Katsuya Kitamura and Tomoyuki Oka, working under amateur wrestling rules. The other nine matches featured NJPW wrestlers taking on Pro Wrestling Noah wrestlers. The second match saw the debut of Animal Hamaguchi trainee Takumi Honjo, who was defeated by Noah's Maybach Taniguchi. The show was main evented by NJPW veteran Yuji Nagata defeating Noah's Mitsuhiro Kitamiya. Lion's Gate Project 2 The second Lion's Gate Project event was held on May 19, 2016, in Tokyo at Shinjuku Face. Much like the first Lion's Gate Project show, the event featured several wrestlers from Pro Wrestling Noah as well as Ayato Yoshida from Kaientai Dojo (K-Dojo). All in all, the event featured eight matches. Lion's Gate Project 3 The third Lion's Gate Project event was held on September 1, 2016, in Tokyo at Shinjuku Face. The event featured nine matches, including one dark match, and again featured heavy participation from Pro Wrestling Noah. One of the matches saw the NJPW debut of the promotion's newest international trainee, Henare, who was defeated by Noah's Quiet Storm. In addition to the NJPW and Noah wrestlers, the event featured Ayato Yoshida and Go Asakawa from Kaientai Dojo (K-Dojo). The dark match featured another exhibition match between NJPW trainees Katsuya Kitamura and Tomoyuki Oka, this time worked under professional wrestling rules. Lion's Gate Project 4 The fourth Lion's Gate Project event was held on April 13, 2017, in Tokyo at Shinjuku Face. The event featured six matches, including the debut match of Shota Umino, son of NJPW referee Red Shoes Unno. Unno refereed the match, where his son was defeated by Taka Michinoku. Following the dissolution of the partnership between NJPW and Pro Wrestling Noah at the end of 2016, this was the first Lion's Gate Project show not to feature any wrestlers from Noah, instead Ayato Yoshida and Dinosaur Takuma from Kaientai Dojo (K-Dojo), Koji Iwamoto and Yuma Aoyagi from All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) and Toru Sugiura from Pro Wrestling Freedoms took part in the event as outsiders. Lion's Gate Project 5 The fifth Lion's Gate Project event was held on May 9, 2017, in Tokyo at Shinjuku Face. The event featured six matches, including the debut of Tetsuhiro Yagi in the opening match.

As is in postcolonial discourse, the term postcolonial is used without a hyphen, denoting an intellectual reaction against the colonial, instead of being merely sequential to it.  Background  Postcolonial theologians argue that, in the past, the dominant Western form of Christianity is actually determined, shaped, and defined by European colonialism, implying and reinforcing notions such as Eurocentrism, colonial exploitation, and the superiority of European values and culture. Therefore, critical examination is needed, and alternative interpretations to colonially-tainted narratives need to be constructed. This is done by \\"revisiting the question of how indigenous cultures can contribute to theology and biblical studies\\". Although decolonization took place shortly after the Second World War, postcolonial theories did not emerge until the late 1970s. The field of postcolonial theology, correspondingly, did not arise until the 1990s. Notable biblical scholars include R. S. Sugirtharajah and Fernando Segovia and theologians include Musa W. Dube, Wai-Ching Angela Wong, Kwok Pui-lan, and Mayra Rivera.  Biblical criticism  Given its similarities with literary analysis, it is not surprising that biblical studies was the first field within Christian studies to apply postcolonial criticism. Adopting postcolonial critical methods, biblical studies is inspired to take into account issues of \\"expansion, domination, and imperialism\\" in examining existing biblical interpretation, and in constructing new narratives. Indigenous non-Western approaches to theologizing the Bible, previously neglected under the colonial context \\"in favor of European methods\\", are now revisited, in hope to \\"make the Bible comprehensible to the colonized cultures on their own terms\\". Therefore, traditional fields of translation, exegesis, and hermeneutics in biblical studies have to be reconsidered in light of postcolonial criticism, and non-Western perspectives have to be taken into account, even as focal points. Among various scholars, R. S. Sugirtharajah, one of the principal advocates of postcolonial biblical studies, outlined in his book The Bible and the Third World three hermeneutic approaches which emerged after colonialism: the native or vernacular approach, the liberation approach, and the postcolonial approach. There are certain benefits of applying postcolonial criticism to biblical studies. First, it opens up potential areas and possibilities for interdisciplinary work, enriching the discipline by enabling multiple approaches to bring in their insights. Second, it allows for criticism towards the way things are done, including the principles and presuppositions of the field. In addition, it also avoids detachment from the contemporary world, as work done in the discipline would have to respond to postcolonial contexts.  Christian mission historiography  Reviewing Christian history from a postcolonial critical perspective, history is realized to be intrinsically more than just impartial facts. As history is essentially a narrative of what happened, it is always an interpretation, which is \\"bound by time, place, and the social, political, religious, cultural and economic positions of writers\\", and a representation, being an \\"interested construction of representation through which power is expressed, reflected, and exercised.\\" Postcolonial historical methods, therefore, begins with tracing the development of the dominant narrative, followed by a critical reassessment of the sources and the historiography of the mainstream narrative, and finally teasing out the colonial taints and construct new, alternative narratives. This is especially relevant in the history of churches in which missionary work has been heavily involved, as such historiographies tend to have more difficulty in treating Western engagement and local churches from an egalitarian perspective. As such, postcolonial criticism contributes to the discipline by putting forth a recognition that current narratives are, or at least are likely to be, shaped by the colonial context. This leads to the awareness that there could be, and should be, alternative representations of those parts of history. Biased historical readings are therefore prevented or at least reduced.  Christian theology  Given the short history of engaging with postcolonial criticism, postcolonial theology as a field of study is still \\"in its infancy.\\" It is argued by R. S. Sugirtharajah that its development is further held back by Western reluctance to analyse the theological implications of colonial imperialism. However, theologians from the colonized non-West such as C. S. Song and Chung Hyun Kyung have long been theologizing with reflection or even resistance against the colonizing West. Interpreted from the perspective of postcolonial criticism, these theologies could be retrospectively categorized as postcolonial theology. Geographically, they could also be conceptualized according to the three main continents, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Regional theologies are also influenced by other intellectual trends, such as liberation theology or feminist theology.  African theology  In Africa, theology is often articulated in one of two aspects: inculturation and liberation. The former is often described as African theology, which is a term first appeared in 1965 at the All Africa Conference of Churches, and could be identified as \\"an attempt by Africans to give theological articulation to their spiritual, political, and economic struggles.\\" The latter is a form of liberation theology and also has an interesting relationship with black theology in North America. This would later influence South African theology, especially during and after Apartheid.  Asian theology  Asian theology could be understood to be inherently postcolonial, as it has moved towards a \\"discontinuity with Western theology and denounced the usefulness of a theology that allied itself with colonial powers and their dominance.\\" This resonates with the strong currents of nationalism. However, since Asian churches have historically been considered under colonial authorities, theologians have had to wrestle with the tension (or even conflict) between religious and national identity. In addition, its focal points include indigenization, liberation from poverty, as well as practical commitment in engaging with the praxis of reality. Hence, the influence of liberation theology is easily notable. Asian local theologies include Dalit theology in South Asia, Minjung theology in South Korea, and Burakumin theology in Japan.  Latin American theology  The Latin American church has been famous for their liberation theology, which influenced numerous theological trends worldwide. It is arguably the earliest postcolonial resistance to western dominance. In comparison, it seems more politically minded, and less concerned in formulating an inculturated theology. Inspired in the 1950s within the Roman Catholic Church, it critiques the colonial situation in three ways, addressing how oppression was structurally enforced by the authorities, complicit by the church, and internalized by the oppressed themselves.

Background The title \\"Bible woman\\" was first used in London in connection with a female evangelist, Ellen Henrietta Ranyard, who put effort to reach sick and poor women in the poorest area of London in the mid-nineteenth century. Ranyard's heart was heavily burdened with the poor condition of women in St. Giles district that she decided to start an evangelistic work among them. Ranyard found a Christian woman who had a similar life as such and hired the woman to go with her to the poorest district in London to evangelize and help the sick women there. The woman who had the similar life as her recipients would freely visit the poor women and read the Bible to their hearings. She also distributed the Bible and tracts to the area, this is why she was called Bible woman. From this little seed, sprang Ranyard's mission. In 1879, there were about 170 Bible women employed in the mission. After Ellen Ranyard's death in 1879, her work was continued as the London Bible and Domestic Female Mission. The idea of \\"Bible women\\" did not stay in her home of origin, in London, but spread throughout England, Scotland, and it travelled to Asia, Africa, and rest of the non- western world with women missionaries. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the creation of many interdenominational mission organizations was influenced by the Evangelical revivals, anti-slavery movements, and free trade theories, especially in Britain. The urge to preach the gospel to individuals shifted to nations and was motivated not only by religious zeal but was also inspired by Enlightenment ideology (which saw liberation and salvation of the world as an equal) to improve one's self to contribute the global progress. In this context, Protestant missionary women from the western world became increasingly interested in mission and trained themselves as educators, doctors, nurses, and other professionals to join in the mission work. They played a central role in mission fields as doctors, nurses, and teachers; they ran schools, hospitals and orphanages for children, etc. By the beginning of the twentieth century, most of the missionaries operating in the mission field were women. Role In the mission field, \\"Bible women\\" or \\"Bible readers\\" were local indigenous women. Initially, Bible women were recruited from domestic workers in missionary homes and from the wives and mothers of indigenous male evangelists. The majority of them held lower social status in their respective countries. They were either supported by female missionaries or by local churches but were usually the lowest paid or even sometimes they were unpaid. These local Christian women helped the British missionaries, especially female missionaries to perform their daily tasks and to accomplish their mission goal. Ruth Tucker argues that \\"without Bible Women, female missionaries would have been at a loss.\\" Ministry Accompanying western missionaries on their missions were a significant part of Bible women ministry, but on many occasions, they served alone or in teams without any direct assistance from the missionaries. Their ministry was wide in its range: they openly shared their faith with their fellow women, read the Bible in communities, taught children in village schools, called on the sick or troubled, worked among girls, and visited women in their homes. Bible women served as evangelists not only in their homelands but also in foreign settings. In the beginning of the 20th century, there were a number of Korean Bible women in Manchuria, Japan, and Hawaii sharing Bible stories with women and children, as well as Chinese Bible women such as Dora Yu in Korea, engaged in educational, medical, and evangelistic work. Bible women also itinerated in villages to distribute and sell Bibles, tracts, and religious literature. In 1913, thirty-six Bible women were employed by the British and Foreign Bible Society for the purpose of helping distribute scripture, and this practice continued with other Bible societies. Even though there were few who wished to buy the Bible, Bible women were successful in winning women for the Gospel. The Bible women were more effective in their evangelistic task than that of missionary women because they had open access to local women, girls, and children. In addition, they did not have a language barrier as most of the missionaries did have. Although Bible women focused on ministering to other women, occasionally, there were opportunities to minister to men as well. Training Initially, Bible women were trained by women missionaries on an individual basis. They were taught the Bible, but on occasion, they were taught nursing, writing, homemaking, and health. However, in later years, the number of Bible women increased and female training schools were opened: in China, alone, forty girls' schools were running in 1900. Bible women were trained as Bible teachers, nurses, and healthcare providers. Bible women who had a solid foundation in biblical studies were trained to be Bible teachers. In Sudan, Bible women used a book entitled One Hundred Lessons from the Bible that took the student through the Bible in outlined studies that involved answering questions and memorizing verses. Following the one hundred lessons, there was a \\"Way of Salvation\\" series that was geared to bring the student to a personal commitment to Christ. Bible women were actively involved in medical ministry too. They were taught basic medical skills by their female medical missionaries and then they worked as nurses and healthcare providers; they cared patients and shared the Gospel with them. Today Although Bible women played a major role in evangelizing their fellow women in their countries, they are largely left behind in contemporary study of Christian mission. There are not many records of Bible women today, neither of their successes nor their failures. It is because women were disregarded in their own cultures or may be they were ignored by their western male and female missionaries. Although they were the least known evangelists, Bible women played a major role in furthering the Kingdom of God in their homelands and beyond.

An outstanding example of architecture from the National Socialist era, it was used by the American military from 1945-1994. Due to its historical and architectural significance, the building received listed building protection in 2001. After being comprehensively restored between 2008-2014, its doors were opened to the public in August 2014, since which the pool has been used by schools and clubs and for sports events. The pool is located in the Lichterfelde district of Berlin.  History  The indoor pool was built on land belonging to the former Prussian Central Cadet School (at Finckensteinallee 63‚Äì97) as part of its expansion for use by the SS regiment Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler. In keeping with the importance accorded to swimming for the training of SS recruits, from the outset, the building was conceived as an expensive architectural showpiece. The pool was designed by the secret state councillor Karl Reichle in cooperation with undersecretary Karl Badberger, both of the Third Reich's Ministry of Finance. Once completed, the pool complex ranked among the largest and most modern in Europe. The pool itself was 50 metres long and 25 metres wide. With a depth of between 2.5 and 4.8 metres, it was equipped with a 10-metre-high diving platform. One special design feature was the skylight which spanned the entire ceiling above the pool. The building has two entrance portals, each flanked by a pair of larger-than-life statues of archetypal National Socialist style idealising the sexes. While the barracks in Finckensteinallee suffered major bomb damage during the Second World War, the swimming pool itself suffered only minor roof damage. In 1945 the site was taken over by the American military. Renamed Andrews barracks, it was enlarged into a military headquarters for the American Sector in West Berlin. After prolonged disuse, the swimming pool was pressed back into service in 1954. Prior to this, the technical facilities were updated and modifications made to the hall's interior. In the early 1970s, the swimming hall's glass roof was replaced by a solid lead roof, its transparent ceiling being replaced by an opaque acoustic layer. At the same time, the hall's fenestration was drastically simplified. Following the departure of the US military in 1994, the pool was once again opened to the public, but was forced to close for frequent repairs due to structural defects. Between 2008 and 2014, the complex underwent comprehensive restoration, jointly funded by the Berlin Senate and EU, which together provided around 13 million Euros from the Senate's then Pool Restoration Programme and EU's Environmental Relief Programme (UEP II). Architect Nils Meyer of Veauthier Meyer Architekten, Berlin, led the concept and design for the project, with project management being undertaken by Tobias Reckert. The historically important elements of the building (fa√ßades, entrance areas, stairways, basic structures and historical surfaces) were preserved. The central swimming hall was returned to its original appearance, and functional areas brought up to date both technically and stylistically. The pool's complicated technical equipment was modernised. While the original dimensions of the pool were maintained in terms of length and width, its variable depth was replaced by a uniform depth of just two metres. With the ten-metre-high () diving platform being rendered obsolete as a result, it was pulled down after extensive disputation, since stripped of its original function, its preservation would have been possible. The indoor swimming pool in Finckensteinallee opened its doors to the public as a sports venue on 1 September 2014. Those regularly using the facilities include both the Steglitz and Zehlendorf Swimming Clubs.  Description  The swimming hall has a ferro-concrete skeleton and is spanned by ferro-concrete trusses, with cladding on both its external and internal walls. The hall has a rectangular layout, with a raised central section flanked to the north and south by lower side wings. To the east is a broad entrance portal linking both main entrances, which are identical in appearance. The entire structure is built symmetrically, consisting of two vestibules, two large changing areas located in the low side wings and two sets of shower facilities in the passages leading to the pool hall, not to mention the two galleries to the north and south. Floor-to-ceiling windows are incorporated into the western side of the hall, the lower third of which originally could be opened to access the greenery outside. The interior of the hall has been restored with sgrafitto plasterwork, the lower areas being clad in restored panels of Trosselfels marble. For both budgetary and environmental reasons, the original transparent ceiling skylight could not be reconstructed. That being said, in terms of its outline and cubing, the restored ceiling was recreated to resemble the spatial impression of the original. The 50-metre-long pool has ten lengthwise lanes, each equipped with starter's podiums at either end. Additionally, there are twenty lanes widthwise. The modern pool has a volume of 2500 m3 (compared with 4000 m3 of the original) and is clad in white tiles. The pool is edged by small, coloured, anti-slip tiles resembling the original marble mosaic tiles. The preserved signs on the walls declaring \\"No running/Nicht rennen\\" and \\"No smoking/Rauchen verboten\\" serve as reminders of the pool's long use by the American military. Functional rooms such as showers and changing areas have been given a contrasting contemporary appearance. The vivid colour scheme, extending from the colourful shower cubicles all the way to the swimming hall itself, also serve as a means of orientation. The new additions to the fabric of the building have been designed so as to be both recognisable and reversible. The same holds true for the shower cubicles, the changing areas and front counters as well as the disabled ramp outside. Additional features such as a non-swimmer's pool, sauna or whirlpool have not been incorporated into the new complex.

It is best known through the writings of the Anglican archbishop Desmond Tutu, who, drawing from his Christian faith, theologizes Ubuntu by a model of forgiveness in which human dignity and identity are drawn from the image of the triune God. Human beings are called to be persons because they are created in the image of God.  Background  The idea of Ubuntu has always existed in the oral cultures of Southern Africa, but there appears to be three significant developments in its application to the peoples of Southern Africa that have endeared it to the larger world. The first development may be traced to the emergence of the concept in print at about 1846, when the concept was adopted as a post- colonial term used in reference to the return of African dignity after the dehumanization by colonization. It became, then, a concept to affirm and assert the sense of peoplehood of Southern Africans in distinction from their colonial definitions and dehumanizations. Although the term Ubuntu had long existed in the Zimbabwean context, a second phase of its development may be discerned in the 1990s when the term gained prominence in the midst of South Africa's transition from the apartheid regime to a more robust democracy that included all races. Siphamandla Zondi says the dictum \\"I am because you are\\" became the doctrine of Ubuntu that changed the political landscape of South Africa from colonial humanism of separate races unto a decolonized one based on the restoration of true humanism. A third phase was a specifically theological one: it was the movement of Ubuntu from an African philosophy based on African values of community and kinship to Christian values and identity with the creator God. This move was significantly promoted by Desmond Tutu and other South African theologians in the context of South African recovery from the pains and brokenness of apartheid. These theologians anchored Ubuntu in the Christian ideals of forgiveness and reconciliation as gifts from God critical for peaceful communal co-existence. Tutu, as chairperson of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa between 1996 and 1998, and operating from the premise of faith, theologizes the Ubuntu concept by anchoring it beyond community into God through the biblical category of the imago Dei. Tutu sees all realms of life in relation to God and all humanity as created in the image of God. It reasons that an understanding of the createdness of all humans in God's image would lead to affirming the dignity of one another.  Description  African village community Desmond Tutu uses descriptive words to speak about Ubuntu intimately binding it within Christian principles of goodness. He describes the person true to Ubuntu as one who is \\"generous, hospitable, friendly, caring and compassionate.\\" He says it as a state in which one's \\"humanity is caught up and inextricably bound up\\" in others. Tutu says of Ubuntu \\"I am human because I belong, I participate, I share.\\" In this form, Tutu's use of Ubuntu is an \\"I am because we are\\" concept that encourages the person to the responsibilities of communal good and makes one find one's good only in the communal good. The theology of Ubuntu is deeply embedded in African spirituality ‚Äì a spirituality that is central to life and transforms all human relations. As Suzanne Membe-Metale affirms, Ubuntu is a spirituality that enables mutual sharing and satisfaction and is illustrated in the biblical account of the disciples sharing all they had with one another so that no one lacked anything (Acts 4:32‚Äì35). Ubuntu theology affirms the interaction and relationship among persons in which everyone's humanness is recognized and affirmed. It is the philosophy of reconciliation and forgiveness that expresses \\"respect for a person's dignity irrespective of what that person has done.\\" In this theology and ideology, Tutu seeks restorative justice over against retributive justice to give opportunity for the healing of both the oppressed and the oppressor as children of God.  Theological basis  Ubuntu theology is based on inherent value for individuals and their relationships within communities, thus mixing African culture and biblical teaching. Faustin Ntamushobora holds that this sense of community is supported by Paul's explanation in 1 Corinthians 12:12‚Äì31, in which the apostle discusses unity in diversity. Ubuntu promotes the idea that people are truly human only in communities in the full expression of the koinonia and finds the best manifestation of this in the church, which is the space in which life in relation to God and to one's neighbour is nourished by worship and fellowship. Ubuntu recognizes the humanity of all as created in the image of God, thus making the imago Dei the essence of humanity's identity. The imago Dei foundation of Ubuntu determines humanity and denies any one or any institution the right to decide the superiority or inferiority of the other.  Criticism  Michael Battle has argued that Ubuntu theology is too heavily based on the advocacy of the person of Desmond Tutu and the South African society. This is because Tutu's influence as a spiritual leader and chairperson of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa gave him power to introduce and pursue an ideology that spoke to the good of both the black and white races. Molly Manyonganise holds that, as originally developed, Ubuntu theology is not gender inclusive. As an ideology that is gaining wide African acceptability, theologians have expressed concern at the lack of gender inclusivity in the discourse of Ubuntu especially with the patriarchal societies of Africa where the identity of a person is determined by the male. John W. de Gruchy has stated that Ubuntu theology is chiefly ecclesio-centric in that the church is seen as the only place for nurture and flourishing of communal relations. In this position, Ubuntu is seen not to sufficiently integrate the totality and diversity of creation. Moreover, Ubuntu theology speaks specifically to the multi-racial reconciliation of the South African challenge. In this way, it is a purely contextual theology. For while restorative justice may work within the South African context, there are concerns as to whether justice is fundamentally achieved if issues are not adequately discussed.

Biography Mar√≠a Laffitte y P√©rez del Pulgar was born in Seville, where she spent her childhood. At age 20 she married and moved to Madrid. Though born to a family of privileged economic status, she nevertheless did not have academic training, something which marked her throughout her life. By age 24 she had three children. \\"During the best years of my life,\\" she would later write, \\"I walked disoriented without knowing where to find my path.\\" \\"I began to write almost without realizing it, like the dictation of an internal and authoritarian voice,\\" she explained about her process, and a short time later she had in her hands her first work, La biograf√≠a cr√≠tica de Mar√≠a Blanchard (The Critical Biography of Mar√≠a Blanchard). Unable to obtain a publisher, after offering it to several, she decided to edit the book on her own, and published it in 1944. Years later she also wrote a biography of Concepci√≥n Arenal. Little by little her name became known in the press and certain intellectual circles. Mar√≠a Laffitte y P√©rez del Pulgar signed her books as Mar√≠a Campo Alange, or Countess of Campo Alange, a title she held from her marriage to Jos√© de Salamanca, Count of Campo Alange. She was an active member of the , vice president of the Ateneo de Madrid, and a member of the Real Academia Sevillana de Buenas Letras. She founded, directed, and sponsored the Seminar on Women's Sociological Studies (Seminario de Estudios Sociol√≥gicos de la Mujer; SESM) which, from 1960 until her death in 1986, gathered a group of professionals, university professors, and researchers, such as Mar√≠a Salas Larraz√°bal, Lil√≠ √Ålvarez, and Elena Catena, dedicated to investigating the situation of women in Spain. She collaborated closely with the most important intellectuals of the Spanish post-war period, such as Eugeni d'Ors, Jos√© Ortega y Gasset, and Gregorio Mara√±√≥n, though she also had to confront their patriarchal tendencies. Women's rights Mar√≠a Laffitte studied and theorized about the situation of women and their subordination, and sought answers in history, anthropology, art, and science. In 1948, a year before Simone de Beauvoir wrote The Second Sex, Laffitte published La secreta guerra de los sexos (The Secret War of the Sexes) in Spain. Her criticism of the role of science in the essentials of women preceded de Beauvoir's. Her essays and research on women and the social construction of femininity are historic and continue to pose challenging questions. In her honor, the Maria Laffitte Women's Federation was founded in 2008, based in her hometown of Seville.

As the developer of his estate in North London, he became the founder of Pentonville. Early life Penton was born on 11 December 1736, the son of Henry Penton of Eastgate House Winchester and his wife Miss Simondi, daughter of the Swedish consul at Lisbon. He was educated at Winchester College in 1748 and was admitted at Clare College, Cambridge on 13 November 1753. He subsequently undertook a Grand Tour Political career In the 1761 general election Penton was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Winchester, which his father had represented since 1747. He was appointed King's letter carrier in 1761, a position he held until his death. His father died in 1762 and left him Eastgate House and his estate which included a large area in the north of London. Also on 27 November 1762, he entered Lincolns Inn. He married Anne Knowler, daughter of John Knowler of Canterbury, Kent on 3 January 1765. Penton was returned for Winchester again in 1768 and 1774 when his career was at its zenith. In December 1774 he was appointed Lord of the Admiralty. In 1778 he entertained George III and Queen Charlotte for two nights at Eastgate House on their visit to Winchester.'Winchester: Introduction', in A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume 5, ed. William Page (London, 1912), pp. 1‚Äì9. British History Online http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/hants/vol5/pp1-9 (accessed 27 September 2017) He was also Recorder of Winchester in 1778. He was returned as MP for Winchester again in 1780. He spoke occasionally in Parliament and made 21 speeches between 1770 and 1782, most of them after 1774 on Admiralty business. However he was replaced at the Admiralty in April 1782 and his domestic circumstances were troubled at this time as his wife left him when she discovered his relationship with her maid. In December 1783 it was reported \\"Mr. Penton feels himself neglected and hurt ‚Ä¶.. but he had formerly a wish to quit Parliament. The seat, therefore, might perhaps be got\\". His behaviour was becoming less reliable in parliament and he lived for many years in a comparatively secluded state. However he was returned for Winchester again in 1784 and was Recorder again in 1785. The political fixers were anxious to take hold of the seat in which he had an interest. He was returned again at Winchester in 1790. In January 1796 he had expressed a wish to retire and Portland recommended Viscount Palmerston to him as meeting every requirement except ‚Äòconsanguinity‚Äô. Penton agreed and gave his health as his reason for retirement at the 1796 general election. He subsequently sold Eastgate House and estate to Sir Henry Paulet St. John Mildmay. Pentonville Penton owned an area of open countryside adjacent to the New Road in North London and developed a number of streets there in the 1770s. In addition to Penton Street he marked his Admiralty connection by naming a new street after Admiral Rodney. The area acquired the name of Pentonville and remained in the family for many years.'Pentonville: Introduction', in Survey of London: Volume 47, Northern Clerkenwell and Pentonville, ed.

British History Online http://www.british- history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol47/pp322-338 (accessed 27 September 2017) Personal life Penton acquired social stigma from his liaison with his wife's maid Catherine Judd of Stratford-on-Avon. His wife left him in the 1780s, having discovered the affair. He began living with Catherine, setting her up in a new house in Piccadilly. He took her to Italy, and had her taught music and languages. It was said that she had a fine voice and she sang excellently. Penton claimed an offer was made to her at Rome of ¬£1,500 a year if she would appear upon the Italian stage. Property in Penton Street was used to secure an independent annuity for her. Five days after the death of his wife, he married Catherine, on 8 April 1808. She was already the mother of his heir Henry Penton and two daughters. Penton died at Wimpole Street on 15 January 1812. After his death Catherine married Richard Earle Welby, the son of Sir William Earle Welby, 1st Baronet.

Rice holds mushroom dyed yarns showing the full spectrum of color. Miriam C. Rice (January 13, 1918 ‚Äì August 30, 2010) was an American artist known for developing a palette of natural dyes extracted from mushrooms and other fungi. Education and teaching Rice studied sculpture at the Art Students League in New York and elsewhere. She went on to teach sculpture at the University of Rochester. Rice migrated to the west coast, settling in Mendocino County, California, with her husband, painter Ray Rice. She helped to develop the art program at the Mendocino Art Center and taught there for years. Rice's sculpture of Mendocino Art Center founder Bill Zacha stands in the center's courtyard. Artistic activity Early on, Rice discovered her deep interest in the arts, in particular sculpture for which she received critical recognition. By age 18 she was living in New York City and studying at the Art Students League. As a young woman she was honored to receive an artist-in-residency at the famed artists‚Äô community, Yaddo, in upstate New York. Miriam maintained her art practice throughout her life, thoroughly exploring sculpture, then batik and the textile arts, and finally the world of fungi through the lens of the fine arts. Several generations of women artists were supported in their personal journeys by her interest and encouragement. Dye research In the late 1960s, Rice began working with natural dyes for her block prints and this led her to experiment with mushrooms. The first mushroom she worked with was Hypholoma fasciculare, which produced a bright yellow dye. Her further experiments led her to mushrooms like the puffball Pisolithus arhizus (yellow, brown, and black hues) and the polypore Phaeolus schweinitzii (green, yellow, and brown hues). Although Rice herself preferred to use scientific names when referring to mushrooms to avoid confusion, both of these mushrooms have acquired new common names thanks to her work. P. tinctorius is now known as dyer's puffball, while P. schweinitzii is dyer's polypore. Over time, she uncovered a wide palette of mushroom dyes that were both colorfast and lightfast, and she is now acknowledged as a pioneer of modern research into the use of mushrooms for natural dyes. Her palette of discoveries ranged from yellow through ochre, orange, rose, and russet shades to burnt sienna and chocolate brown. Historical sources show that mushroom- derived dyes were used in the Americas and Europe at least as far back as the 15th century, though such uses appear to have been uncommon. World War II prompted some further experiments, but when Rice began her research, the contemporary literature had very little information on the subject and no practical guidance. Rice wrote the first modern book on the subject, Let's Try Mushrooms for Color, which came out in 1974 and was an international success. Rice's second book, Mushrooms for Color (1980), included a much-expanded range of pigments developed in the intervening years, a whole color wheel, including greens, reds, blues, and violets. Other researchers, principally from America and the Nordic countries, have built on her initial research to further develop this range of color. Rice later experimented with using mushroom- derived pigments in watercolor paint and with turning the mushroom pulp that remained after dye extraction into paper. She discovered that the best results for papermaking are obtained from tree fungi. She also developed \\"Myco-Stix\\", crayons whose mushroom-extracted pigments are held together by one of several binders derived from mushrooms like Pseudohydnum gelatinosum. In 1976, as a result of her work, the Mendocino County Museum held the first-ever exhibition devoted to fiber art dyed with mushrooms. In 1980, Rice led the founding of the International Mushroom Dye Institute to encourage the use and further development of mushroom dyes. Around the same time, she also helped inspire formation of the International Fibre & Fungi Symposia, biannual meetings that convene artists and scientists from around the world to share their research.

Pillai. It covers the journey of Sethu Lakshmi Bayi, during her reign in the house of Travancore. The book came into the hands of Shobu Yarlagadda, producer of the Baahubali franchise, and optioned the rights under Arka Media Works (pvt ltd), a noted Indian motion-picture production company. Synopsis The book begins by discussing the cultural implications of the arrival of Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama and the expansion of maritime trade in the Indian subcontinent. It specifically focuses on the series of events that lead to the rise of Martanda Varma and his impact on the kingdom of Travancore. During that era, the kingdom followed a form of matrilineal succession known as Marumakkathayam. And it was through this system that the adoption of Sethu Lakshmi Bayi and her cousin Sethu Parvathi Bayi into the Travancore Royal Family (depicted on the cover of the book) made them the Senior Maharani and Junior Maharani, respectively. The book covers most key events in Travancore's history from the perspective of the Senior Maharani, often involving the Junior Maharani to various degrees. It chronicles the bond they shared during their upbringing, which would later turn into a power struggle when Senior Maharani begins her regency during the minority of the Junior Maharani's son (and heir to the eponymous Ivory Throne), Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma. While the Maharani's regency would be marked largely with positive reforms for both the people and the kingdom of Travancore, the termination of her regency would be the beginning of a bitter struggle between her and the Junior Maharani. The continued struggles between the two Maharanis also overlapped with the Indian Independence movement, the rise of Communism in Kerala and the dismantling of the monarchy during the formation of the Dominion of India. The book also shows how the Maharani's children (and later the Maharani herself) adapted to becoming civilians, and the later years of her life spent in Bangalore. Reception While the book itself won awards including the Sahitya Akademi Yuva Puraskar award, it's rising popularity has garnered interest in a screen adaptation.

He paints in watercolor and oil. His work as a painter and a teacher has contributed greatly to the establishing and development of figurative expression in art, design and animation in Israel.  Biography  Marek Yanai was born in Germany in 1946 and immigrated to Israel from Poland in 1957. He graduated from the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design, Jerusalem in 1970, student of Yosef Hirsch (he). In 1969 he founded the ‚ÄúTeddy‚Äù Puppet Theater, and was its director until 1971. In 1973 and 1974 he studied techniques of the Old Masters in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna and the San Fernando Royal Academy of Fine Art, Madrid. From 1996 until today he is a senior lecturer at the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, Jerusalem and also teaches in his own studio. Yanai lives and works in Jerusalem.  Body of Work  Yanai's works are figurative and strive to interpret reality. His subjects are the Jerusalem landscape and people. His portraits in watercolor depict friends, students, lecturers and other people in his life. This series is renowned for his work with patches of color and his ability to reveal the character of the subjects with the use of these marks and strong tones.David Ivgy, ‚ÄúMarek Yanai - Present‚Äú The series of landscapes deal with, on the face of it, rather banal and mundane subjects such as solar panels on roofs, gas tanks and washing hanging out to dry. Through their banality, these scenes reflect the complexity of the city's soul. Yanai's creativity offers a picture of the spirit of the times in his vicinity. He is known for his use of light to produce shape and life. The art researcher Gideon Efrat (he) wrote of Yanai :\\"(His works contain) metaphorical lights. Pressing them into an interior and surrounding them with shadows to symbolize the inner soul; while the victory of the bright and color-bleaching white in the outdoor landscapes represents the \\"I-world\\" relationship. The essence of the soul is darkness. The all-consuming whiteness is the essence of emergence into the world. Loss lies in wait in both extremes: sinking in the darkness of the self, or annihilating the body in the searing light outside. Marek Yanai endures in his paintings. Again and again he sallies out in the world to create it anew out of light\\".  Watercolor  Yanai has created a virtuosic body of work in watercolor. It is characterized by instinctive production of wet marks that permit random in the dispersal of the water. The making of the marks create a figurative image. The artist Sasha Okun: \\"Painting with watercolors creates an infinite number of surprises and unexpected situations. Yanai is gifted with the exceptional ability to control the unexpected, which is considered the ultimate ability by the Japanese, the greatest of watercolor artists.Sasha Okun, One of a kind, Marek Yanai, Watercolor, page 6, 2016\\"  Oil Painting  Yanai's oil painting differs greatly from his work in watercolor in technique, style and temperament. His oil painting is realistic and built up over time, layer upon layer, as was the technique of 17th and 18th century European painters. Predominant themes in his work are entrances to, and interiors of, Jerusalem houses, and Jerusalem figures and landscapes.  Teaching  From 1996 until the present, he is a senior lecturer at the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design Jerusalem, and also teaches in his studio. He has had a great influence on generations of artists in the painting, design and animation fields. The principle of the studio's activities is painting from observation. The studio is characterized by a great respect for the craftsmanship in painting: drawing as a basis for painting, line and mark, composition, color theory, and faithfulness to the unwritten laws passed down through the centuries that are the foundations of art. Craftsmanship is repeatedly exercised as a value leading to personal interpretation and creative self-expression in a variety of media: drawing, oil and watercolor. Work takes place both in the studio space and, ‚Äòen plein air‚Äô in the Jerusalem landscape.

Called a \\"Po√®te maudit\\" by some, his work features the life and struggles of underground characters, touching themes such as violence, prostitution and homosexuality, and was censored by the military government.  Early life  Marcos was born in 1935, in Santos, into a poor family. He finished only the primary school before dropping out. Marcos worked as coppersmith, served the Brazilian Air Force and played football for Portuguesa Santista, but he found his way into acting working as a circus clown when he was 17 years old. He also acted in the radio and television, in Santos. In 1958, influenced by the writer and journalist Pagu, he got into a Santos amateur theater company. That same year, impressed by the true story of a young man gang-raped in prison, he wrote his first play, Barrela. Because of its crude language, the play was prohibited from being staged for 21 years. In 1960, at the age of 25, he went to S√£o Paulo, where he initially worked as a street vendor. Later, he worked in theater, as an actor (appeared in the TV Tupi series O Falc√£o Negro ), administrator and handyman, in theater companies like Arena, Cacilda Becker and Nydia Lycia. From 1963, he produced texts for the TV Tupi show TV de Vanguarda, where he also worked as a technician. In 1964, year of the military coup, he made the script for the show Nossa gente, Nossa M√∫sica. In 1965, he managed to stage Reportagem de um tempo mau, a collage of texts by several authors, and that was only one day in the theaters. In 1968, he participated as an actor in the telenovela Beto Rockfeller, as the driver Vit√≥rio. He reprised that role in the movies and also in the 1973 telenovela, A volta de Beto Rockfeller, with less success. Still in the cinema, during the movement of the cinema marginal, the director Braz Chediak adapted two of its plays, Navalha na Carne (1969) and Dois Perdidos Numa Noite Suja (1970), both with the actor Emiliano Queiroz. In the 1970s, Plinio Marcos returned to the stage, getting himself to sell tickets at the theaters entrance. At the end of the play, he would take the stage and chat personally with the audience. Marcos also wrote for newspapers such as Folha de S. Paulo, √öltima Hora and O Pasquim.  Death  Marcos died on 29 November 1999, after suffering two strokes and having the left side of his body paralyzed. His body was cremated and the ashes were scattered to the ocean in Santos.  Personal life  Marcos was married to the actress Walderez de Barros, with whom he had three children, and with the journalist Vera Artaxo.

However, the High Court bid to stop the amalgamation of the two Enniskillen grammar schools failed. Subsequently, Portora Royal School and the Enniskillen Collegiate Grammar School closed at the end of the 2015/2016 school year. Enniskillen Royal Grammar School then opened on 1 September 2016. Initially, the school is operating on two sites. However, there are plans to build a single new school at the current Lough Shore site.

A circular letter of credit was a letter of credit issued by a bank or related financial institution to a private person, usually an individual of means, which enabled that person to draw funds from correspondent banks while traveling. This was considered safer than carrying large sums of cash. Early examples of the use of personal letters of credit can be found as far back as the Renaissance and they became more standardized by the latter half of the 18th century. Circular letters of credit were widely used until the 1970s. However, with the advent of modern electronic banking and ATMs they have largely fallen into disuse. Such letters were often issued on special paper with formal lettering and designs to discourage counterfeiting. The circular letter of credit generally consisted of two or three separate items. The first being the actual letter addressed to correspondent banks stating the amount of funds that can be drawn. The reverse of the letter usually contained space to record the drawing of funds against the letter and the current balance. The second item was a list of correspondent banks in the area where the letter holder expected to be traveling. And the third was a signature card which was expected to be presented for comparison when drawing funds. Also referred to as a \\"letter of indication,\\" it may have contained additional information such as a description of the letter bearer intended to add a level of security. Travelers were advised to keep the letter and signature card separate from one another as a precaution against theft. Banks typically charged around 1% of the value of the letter for its issuance. Circular letters of credit were in many ways similar to circular notes which were in turn a precursor to later traveler's cheques. Because of the expense involved, most financial institutions had minimum values for which they would issue such letters. In the 19th century in the United States this was typically $500.

During the war he held a senior position in the Vichy government's Ministry of Industrial Production from 1940 to 1942. He was assassinated in March 1963, apparently by an OAS member due to his refusal to support the movement to oppose Algerian independence. Early years (1894‚Äì1939) Henri Lafond was born on 20 August 1894 in Thaumiers, Cher. His parents were Joseph Lafond, a tobacconist, and Juliette Alexandrine Gu√©nard. His father was the son of a laborer. Henri Lafond studied at the Thaumiers commune school, then at the Bourges lyc√©e. He entered the √âcole Polytechnique in 1914. He was described as having brown hair, vertical brow, straight nose, chestnut eyes, oval face, height . Lafond was awarded the Croix de guerre for his service in World War I. He entered the √âcole des Mines de Paris in 1919, and graduated in 1920 second out of 145 students. He became a member of the Corps des mines. Lafond married a Mlle. Thivet. Their children were H√©l√®ne and Jacqueline, who both married doctors. Lafond left the Corps des Mines in 1929 to join the Banque Mirabaud. The Mirabaud Bank specialised in mining and associated industries. Lafond was made head of its subsidiary, the Association mini√®re, in 1930. He became a director of many mining companies. He became a director of the Compagnie des Mines du Huaron, and a managing director of the Litcho Gold Mines in 1935. In 1939 he was director of the Compagnie marocaine representing the Banque Mirabaud. World War II (1939‚Äì45) During World War II Lafond was close to men considered to be members of the Synarchy. Ren√© Belin was made Minister of Industrial Production in July 1940 in Marshal Philippe P√©tain's government. He appointed Jean Bichelonne and Henri Lafond to the two senior positions in the ministry. On 12 August 1940 Petain called for the various social committees to merge into \\"families\\" in an effort to reduce overhead. Lafond proposed to merged the 11 iron and steel committees into a metallurgy family headed by Jules Aubrun. Aubrun accepted this in principle in November 1941, but wanted fewer committees in the family. In the end, no progress was made. In the government of Pierre Laval formed on 18 April 1942 the Ministry of Industry was headed by Jean Bichelonne with Henri Lafond as general secretary for energy and Ren√© Norguet (1888‚Äì1968) as general secretary for industrial production. Lafond's Energy secretariat included sections for mines, steel, gas/electricity and fuel. Lafond was finally dismissed in November 1942. This seems to have been engineered by Laval due to his personal dislike. After leaving the government Lafond was appointed president and CEO of the Association mini√®re and joined the Mirabaud Group, long-time partner of the Banque de l'Union Parisienne (BUP). From 1943 he was president of the Mines du Huaron and on the board of Tr√©fileries et Laminoirs du Havre. He joined the executive committee of the BUP in January 1944. Post World War II (1945‚Äì63) In the post-war period Lafond maintained contact with the people with whom he had worked during the war, and the \\"Lafond Group\\" met for monthly lunches for the rest of his life. The members of the group, almost all engineers, represented oil, power, mining, steel and industrial chemistry. Lafond worked with Pierre Ricard and Henri Davezac to form the Conseil national du patronat fran√ßais (CNPF), representing French employers, with Georges Villiers as the first president. Because he had left the Vichy regime soon enough, he was able to play a leading role in the CNPF, although he remained a believer in most of the Vichy regime's Comit√©s d'Organization principles. He was a \\"modernist\\", and thought employees were entitled to certain rights, which should be regulated by law. From 1947 to 1954 he was a member of the CNPF Economic and Social Council, representing a group of private industrial companies. Lafond had many contacts among the senior administrators of France and the leaders of major companies. His voice was heard by General Charles de Gaulle. Lafond sat on the Comit√© Franc-Dollar and the √âcole polytechnique development council. In April 1951 Lafond was tentatively appointed to the new Commissariat √† l'√©nergie atomique (Atomic Energy Committee). This appointment was strongly opposed by Francis Perrin, expected to be the High Commissioner, based on Lafond's background in the Vichy regime and his many private interests. Perrin blocked the appointment by threatening to resign. Lafond was chairman and chief executive officer of the Soci√©t√© du Djebel-Dj√©rissa from 1945 to 1962. He was a director of the Banque de l'Union Parisienne, the Soci√©t√© des Phosphates de Gafsa, the Soci√©t√© de l'Ouenza, the Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise des p√©troles, the Soci√©t√© commerciale d'affr√®tements et de combustibles, Chantiers et Ateliers de Saint-Nazaire from 1947, Pechiney from 1948 and √âlectricit√© de France from 1949. Lafond became vice-president of the BUP in 1948, and became CEO of the BUP in 1951. In 1953, in great secrecy, he arranged the merger of the BUP with the Mirabaud Bank. Mirabaud's portfolio included large investments in the mining and oil sectors. The bank controlled the Soci√©t√© Mokta El Hadid. Lafond headed the Mokta company until his death in 1963. Lafond was also head of the Soci√©t√© Anonyme Ch√©rifienne d'Etudes Mini√®res (SACEM). In 1962 he joined the board of Tr√©fim√©taux, formed by a merger of the Tr√©fileries et Laminoirs du Havre and the Compagnie fran√ßaise des m√©taux. Henri Lafond became a knight of the Legion of Honour on 28 January 1939. He was appointed an Officer of the Legion of Honour of 5 September 1949, and Commander of the Legion of Honour on 18 June 1959. While leaving his house in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Hauts-de-Seine, on 6 March 1963 he was killed by several revolver bullets. The killer fled and was never found. The killer apparently was an OAS member, and killed him since he refused to support the OAS with the companies in his group. At the time of his death, Henri Lafond owned 0.26% of the capital of the BUP.

He succeeded to the estates of his uncle Sir Francis Page and took name of Page in 1741. He matriculated at New College, Oxford on 29 April 1743, aged 16 and was created MA on 1 August 1747 and DCL on 14 April 1749. He was High Sheriff of Oxfordshire for 1752‚Äì1753. He embellished and consolidated the estate he inherited at Middle Aston. Page had no great political or intellectual attainments, but was devoted to the Church and University. He was elected as Member of Parliament for Oxford University in 1768 after a contest, and held his seat unopposed for 33 years. By 1790 he was secure in his seat for as long as he wished to hold it but he was politically negligible apart from his attachment to Tory principles in church and state. Early in 1793 he was so ill that there was a canvass for his seat, and on 10 December 1795 he took leave of absence for two weeks to recover his health. In April 1796 he decided to offer himself for re-election in the 1796 general election. Having come into the 1st United Kingdom Parliament in 1801, he resigned his seat within the first quarter of 1801. Page died on 24 August 1803 in his 78th year.

Known for being the most capable Safavid ruler after his great-grandfather Abbas I (r. 1588-1629), Abbas II effectively tackled many issues that had risen as a result of Safi's reign, including in the military administration. Following complaints by soldiers, Aliqoli Khan's conduct was examined by Abbas II; as a result he was fired on the spot.

In 1960 she co-founded the Seminar on Women's Sociological Studies. Career Elena Catena L√≥pez was born in Salamanca and moved to Madrid after the Spanish Civil War. In the academic vacuum caused by the Civil War, and the dependent social position that women were placed in by the dictatorship that followed, Elena Catena was one of the first women to obtain a doctorate in Philosophy and Literature at the Complutense University of Madrid, and the first to reach the position of vice dean of the same. She was a professor of Spanish literature and a professor emeritus after her retirement. Her work as a teacher was accompanied by work as an editor, having been responsible for the Castalia Publishing House's Cl√°sicos Castalia collection after the death of , as well as the Biblioteca de Escritoras (Library of Writers) for the same editorial collection, dedicated to rescuing the best works of Spanish authors.

Brodsky, often known as Joseph Brodsky and Joe Brodsky, was an early 20th-century American civil rights lawyer, political activist, general counsel of the International Labor Defense (ILD), co-founder of the International Juridical Association (IJA), and member of ILD defense team for members of the Scottsboro Boys Case of the 1930s. Career According to Max Lowenthal, Brodsky was a partner in the law firm of a \\"Captain Hale.\\" Other sources state that Brodsky was a partner with Carol Weiss King at Brodsky, King & Shorr in New York City. (Another source calls the firm \\"Shorr, Brodsky, and King\\" and states King headed it in 1925. ) Others in their \\"loose partnership\\" of radical attorneys included Walter Nelles and Walter Pollak (onetime partner of Benjamin Cardozo, known through King's brother-in-law Carl Stern). International Labor Defense (ILD) Symbol of International Red Aid, used during 10th Anniversary (1932) Brodsky was general counsel of the International Labor Defense (ILD), an affiliate (or \\"arm\\") of the Communist Party of the United States. The ILD was a legal advocacy organization established in 1925 as the American section of the Comintern's International Red Aid network. The ILD defended Sacco and Vanzetti, was active in the anti- lynching, movements for civil rights, and prominently participated in the defense and legal appeals in the cause c√©l√®bre of the Scottsboro Boys in the early 1930s. Its work contributed to the appeal of the Communist Party among African Americans in the South. In addition to fundraising for defense and assisting in defense strategies, from January 1926 it published Labor Defender, a monthly illustrated magazine that achieved wide circulation. In 1946 the ILD was merged with the National Federation for Constitutional Liberties to form the Civil Rights Congress, which served as the new legal defense organization of the Communist Party USA. Carol Weiss King helped Brodsky found the ILD and served on its legal advisory committee. Scottsboro Boys Case In 1931, nine Southern African-American youths‚Äìthe \\"Scottsboro Boys\\"‚Äìwere falsely accused of rape and sentenced to death in Alabama. Between April 6 and 9, all boys except Roy Wright were tried singly or in groups and convicted. Some of the boys retained George W. Chamlee, Sr., as new defense. In mid-April 1931, the International Labor Defense (ILD) and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) stepped in to help. Brodsky sought first to hire Clarence Darrow, but he declined. Brodsky then worked hard to \\"wrest the case from the NAACP.\\" (Carol Weiss King, Walter Pollak, and Carl Stern all worked on the Scottsboro Boys cases; Pollak argued part of it before the U.S. Supreme Court.) On June 22, 1931, the courts denied Brodsky's motion for a new trial. When he arrived to make his application, a \\"howling mob of lynchers\\" greeted him. In August 1931, Brodsky and Chamlee had to remain in the court building until a large crowd dispersed. At year's end, Brodsky led arguments, but on December 31, 1931, the Daily Worker newspaper published a statement for Scottsboro defendants that announced retainer of Chamlee and Brodsky as their attorneys. Upon Brodsky's arrival: Former ILD chairman J. Louis Engdahl toured 26 European countries to raise support for the Scottsboro Boys. (Engdahl died in Moscow of pneumonia during the trip.) In Chemnitz, Germany, two demonstrators were killed during protests. In the United States, \\"the Communist Party and the Young Communist League were the great stimulating forces which brought Scottsboro before the broad masses of organized labor. In cooperation with the ILD, the question of Negroes serving on juries was raised for the first time.\\" On January 21, 1932, Chamlee, Brodsky, and Irving Schwab (retained by ILD) appealed to the Alabama Supreme Court on all convictions. On March 24, 1932, the court affirms conviction of seven boys but reverses that of Eugene Williams as a minor. On May 31, 1932, the U.S. Supreme Court grants permission for leave to appeal to it. On October 10, 1932, Walter H. Pollak (retained by the ILD), argues before the U.S. Supreme Court; on November 7, 1932, the court reverses the convictions due to inadequate representation and sets new trials for 1933 in Powell v. Alabama. In 1933, the ILD brought in Samuel Leibowitz to join him and Chamlee. The fact that Leibowitz was not a communist or even radical but rather a mainstream Democrat underscored how serious Communists were to win the case. That said, Leibowitz did have to accept as co-counsel ILD chief attorney Joseph Brodsky. On March 27, 1933, Leibowitz opened his defense of Haywood Patterson, the first defendant retried, by challenging Alabama's exclusion of blacks from the jury rolls and tough cross-examination of whites. On April 9, 1933, at the jury's guilty verdict of Patterson, Liebowitz compared the verdict to \\"the act of spitting on the tomb of Abraham Lincoln\\" and vowed to defend the defendants \\"until hell freezes over.\\" On April 12, 1933, Leibowitz and Brodsky joined John Haynes Holmes, Arthur Garfield Hays, and Roger Baldwin at a \\"Labor Defense Meeting\\" in Union Square, New York City. On April 16, 1933, Brodsky filed a motion for new trial for Patterson, which the judge grants on June 22. In May 1933, Brodsky joined the ACLU's Arthur Garfield Hays and NAACP's Alexander Miller to meet faculty and students at Brooklyn College to discuss the case. In November 1933, third trials start for Patterson and Clarence Norris, represented by Liebowitz, Brodsky, and Chamlee; both boys receive third convictions by mid-December.Kill the Jew From New York. Decatur, 1933. On November 19, 1933, the lawyers called on U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt for intervention to protect the defendants. \\"Conflict between Liebowitz and the Communist-dominated International Labor Defense (ILD) attorney Joseph Brodsky\\" undermined the effectiveness of defense, particularly after two ILD attorneys were charged with attempting to bribe witness Victoria Price. By 1934, Brodsky had dropped out of the case, apparently replaced by fellow IJA member Osmond Fraenkel. Individual cases involved in the Scottsboro Boys case include: * POWELL ET AL. v. STATE, 141 So. 201(Ala. 1932): Defense of Ozie Powell, William Roberson, Andy Wright, Olen Montgomery, and Eugene Williams by Chamlee, Sr., Chamlee, Jr., and Brodsky, supported by Irving Schwab, Allan Taub, Elias M.

Biography Cook was born in Winchcombe in Gloucestershire and studied art at the Royal Academy Schools, where he was taught by both Walter Thomas Monnington and Walter Westley Russell. At the RA, Cook won a gold medal and a travelling scholarship. He went on to study at the Central School of Art and Crafts where he specialised in wood engraving, under the direction of Noel Rooke. In 1939, for the book publisher Harrap, he illustrated The Teamsmen by Crichton Porteous. During World War II, Cook served as a wireless operator in the Merchant Navy. Cook was shipwrecked in October 1941 and spent several days in an open boat in the Mediterranean when his ship, the Empire Guillemot, en route from Malta, was attacked and sunk. Cook was then held captive in prisoner-of-war camps in Algeria for a year until the Allied landings in North Africa liberated the camps. Both while at sea and in the camps, Cook continued to sketch and, when possible, paint. In due course, the War Artists' Advisory Committee acquired some nine examples of these works and they are now held in the Imperial War Museum in London. After a period of recuperation, Cook rejoined the Merchant Navy and served on refuelling tankers in the Mediterranean until the war ended. When his war service ended in 1945, Cook settled in Edinburgh and taught graphic design and engraving at the Edinburgh College of Art, where he also lectured on the history of art. In 1958 he created the mosaic wall at the Lady Altar in the newly built St Teresa's Church in Dumfries. Working in situ and with three assistants, it was completed in three weeks. In 1960 he was appointed Head of Design at the College, a post he held until his retirement in 1971. In Edinburgh, Cook had a number of solo exhibitions at both the Demarco Gallery and at Open Eye Gallery but also showed in London including at the Gallery Upstairs at the Royal Academy. Cook toured a show of images called Microcosm and also produced a volume of poems and wood engravings entitled Aftermath, based on drawings made in Bristol and London after war-time air raids on those cities. Cook added a postscript, entitled The Greening to the volume in 1984. Later in life, Cook turned to a more abstract style of painting and also created large works on ecological themes. A memorial show to Cook was held in 1995 at the Edinburgh College of Art and a retrospective exhibition was held at the Open Eye Gallery in 1999. Cook's wartime sketches were included in the War Artists At Sea exhibition mounted at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich in 2014. A number of retrospective drawings Cook made, in the 1960s, of his wartime experiences are also held at Greenwich.

Previously, Goldberg founded Bleacher Report, a sports news website that sold to Turner Broadcasting System in 2012 for $200 million. Bryan Goldberg is widely considered to be a polarizing figure in New York media. He has been described as the ‚Äúbuyer of last resort‚Äù for his hard-nosed deal making tactics and a ‚Äúmedia mogul‚Äù by The New Yorker.  Early life  Goldberg grew up in Los Altos, California. His father was a technology executive who worked at Atari and Quantum and his mother was a homemaker. He earned his undergraduate degree from Middlebury College, where he studied economics and Japanese. He briefly worked as an investment banker at Credit Suisse, and later worked as an analyst at Deloitte Consulting.  Career  Goldberg founded Bleacher Report in 2007 with David Finocchio, Alexander Freund, and David Nemetz, who were friends from middle school. Though not an engineer by training, Goldberg took on most of the technical tasks related to the sports news website. Bleacher Report quickly became a competitor to traditional sports news media such as ESPN and Sports Illustrated and was known for drawing huge audiences with its high volume of content and slideshows. The company also launched the Team Stream app and ultimately surpassed ESPN as the largest sports network for mobile and social media. The site was acquired for $200 million by Turner Broadcasting System in 2012. After the sale, Goldberg and his cofounders took all 160 employees on a trip to Las Vegas. Goldberg left Bleacher Report in 2013 to found Bustle, a women‚Äôs interest website. In preparation, he interviewed hundreds of women about what they thought was missing from traditional publications like Glamour and Cosmopolitan. While the launch was met with critical response, Bustle has grown to 31.2 million readers, nearly half being women under 34. In April 2017, Goldberg and his company acquired Elite Daily, a millennial-focused site, from the Daily Mail and rebranded as Bustle Digital Group. In March 2018, Goldberg purchased The Zoe Report from celebrity style icon Rachel Zoe, who subsequently became a partner in his Bustle Digital Group venture. In July 2018, Goldberg purchased the rights to Gawker at a bankruptcy auction. The popular site had previously been forced into closure after being sued by professional wrestler Hulk Hogan. Gawker‚Äôs auction was the subject of great media attention, and Goldberg‚Äôs initial refusal to state his plans for the site made him the subject of intense speculation. He subsequently announced plans to relaunch Gawker in early 2019, but later paused the project. In November 2018, Goldberg purchased Mic.com for a reported price of under $10 million ‚Äî a sharp discount from the nearly $100 million that the company had been worth only a year prior. Goldberg cited his desire to expand Bustle Digital Group further into News and Politics, a move that was criticized by the Mic Union after widespread corporate layoffs. In July 2019, Goldberg acquired Nylon Magazine, an alternative fashion and music publication with a focus in experiential marketing. Though the magazine had previously exited print, Goldberg promised to resume publishing the magazine. Thursday, September 3, 2020 In August 2020, Goldberg pushed further into fashion by partnering with celebrities Karlie Kloss, Kaia Gerber, Lewis Hamilton to acquire W Magazine. The luxury fashion magazine had previously been part of Conde Nast. Thursday, September 3, 2020 To date, the company has raised $80 million in venture capital funding and has been valued at just over $200 million.

In the late 1800s, Spanish missionaries named the native people of Big Bear, Serrano, meaning ‚Äúmountaineer‚Äù or ‚Äúhighlander.‚Äù Since earliest times, however, they called themselves the Yuhaviatam, ‚ÄúPeople of the Pines.‚Äù Their creation stories involves a God, Kruktat, who created the People. After falling ill, Kruktat journeyed to the mountains where he lay dying in a bear cave. Tended by the First People, he was taken to Maktsuk, today called Pan Hot Springs, where be was bathed by human caretakers. Knowing he was dying, Kruktat instructed the People to cremate him and protect his body from Coyote, who eats dead things. Kruktat died near present day Baldwin Lake. According to legend, during the cremation the eye of Kruktut flew out and became the a giant snow quartz megalith known as Aapahunane‚Äôt, or God‚Äôs Eye. Legend says that the unusually large white outcropping is God watching to make sure the People treat each other well. While the people were dancing in a circle around Kruktat‚Äôs cremation pyre, Coyote snuck through the bowed legs of bear and snatched Kruktat‚Äôs heart in his mouth. The people hit Coyote, and as he ran into the mountains above Baldwin Lake, the dripping blood turned the rocky soil red. When the creator died the people mourned and their tears turned into pine trees, the area called Yuhaviat. The nuts from the trees became food for the Yuhaviatam, or People of the Pines. The quartz outcropping was originally a full dome, but was dynamited in the search for gold. The Eye of God Trail is a 1.8-mile roundtrip hike to Eye of God, which has its trailhead on Burns Canyon Road.

Biography David Stuart Horner was born on 29 July 1900, the son of John Stuart Horner (b. 1855) and Emily Green, the daughter of Col. James Francis Birch, of the 3rd West India Regiment. He was part of the Horners of Mells Manor. According to the same Horner, \\"I am directly descended from Little Jack Horner (Henry VIII) who was lampooned in the nursery rhyme--the \\"Plum\\" being the property of Mells bought by my ancestor when the monks were kicked out of Glastonbury Abbey--his enemies said that he had stolen the title deeds: Mells, which now belongs to my first cousin Katharine [Horner] Asquith, is once again in the hands of a Catholic.\\" According to Osbert Sitwell, Horner's future companion, \\"The Horners are probably one of the few Saxon families still extant. [...] I am rather bored with the Normans and consider them nouveaux riches.\\" Horner attended Eton College and then Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and obtained a BA degree in History and Modern Languages. According to Sarah Bradford, Sacheverell Sitwell's biographer, \\"At Cambridge, a male admirer addressed Horner as \\"Beauteous Adonis\\": he was pale, willowy and elegant, with a finely drawn profile and blond.\\" Horner was the longtime companion of Sir Osbert Sitwell (1892-1969). They met at a London party in 1923, when Horner was an undergraduate at Cambridge. During their relationship, both of them had other affairs, Sitwell with art critic Adrian Stokes and Horner with Vicomte Bernard d'Hendecourt, with whom Horner lived for several years in Paris and from whom he received an inheritance. According to John Pearson, the Sitwells' biographer, \\"David dressed superbly, had an amusing line of gossip about all the best people, which he recounted in an engagingly basso profundo voice, and after leaving Cambridge was soon floating, as unattached, good-looking, upper-class young Englishmen could float in those more gentle, far-off days, through a rarely failing world of dinner-parties, long weekends and holidays abroad. He was the perfect guest, the ideal ornament for any party, charming to women and agreeable to men, better connected and far better read than the usual run of gilded social butterflies, and equally at home in the best society in Paris or in London.\\" Before World War II, Horner published two books based on his life in France: Through French Windows (1938) and Was It Yesterday? (1939). During World War II he served as a Squadron-Leader in the Royal Air Force. In 1959 David Stuart Horner published a crime novel, The Devil's Quill, inspired by the killing of Horner's elder brother, Maurice Stuart Horner (1893-1943), a murder which remains unsolved today. Maurice Horner is buried at St Andrew Churchyard, Mells.Horner, David, The Devil's Quill, Heinemann (1959) Horner and Sitwell lived together at Renishaw Hall, but they also had a flat in London, and wintered at Castello di Montegufoni, which was Horner's favorite residence. Edith Sitwell, who was living with them, disliked Horner. Somewhere around the 1950s the relationship deteroriated and by the 1960s they were estranged. Adrian Wright, the biographer of L. P. Hartley (Hartley was a good friend of Horner; they met through Sitwell in 1933), said that, despite the downplay of many Sitwells' biographies, Horner was \\"man of taste and literary ability.\\" David Stuart Horner died in 1983; his obituary appeared in The Times on 7 January 1984. His manuscript collection was donated at the Eton College Library. The largest single collection of Sitwell papers is in the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin. It includes 951 letters from Osbert Sitwell to David Horner and it has been said that Horner sold them to the University of Texas as a spite gesture for having being denied the inheritance of Montegufoni, the Italian Castle he loved, over Sitwell's death; Osbert Sitwell wrote off Horner from a previous will, leaving his London flat to his male nurse, Frank Magro, and Montegufoni to his nephew.

Life  Fritz Scheler was born on 5 August 1925 in Mengersgereuth as the only child of a train conductor und a seamstress in southern Thuringia. Werner Scheler was his first cousin. Fritz Scheler went to school in Sonneberg, together in the same class with Tankred Dorst. He was drafted into the army in 1942 before finishing school (Notabitur). Only three students of their class survived the war. He became an American war prisoner in 1944, and could finish his education after the war in England in 1948. Scheler studied medicine at the universities of G√∂ttingen and Freiburg. In 1954 he received his doctorate in G√∂ttingen. Scheler's Habilitation on extracorporal hemodialysis followed in 1964. From 1967 until 1993 he was director of the department for nephrology and rheumatology of the Uniklinik G√∂ttingen. He was married to Elisabeth Correns, granddaughter of Carl Erich Correns, he had three children, and one grandchild. Scheler died on 4 June 2002 in G√∂ttingen.  Hemofiltration research  Scheler invented the term of hemofiltration, und was co-inventor and pioneer in the development of hemofiltration. Dabei wird Blutwasser √ºber eine Membran abgepresst und anschlie√üend Elektrolytl√∂sung zur√ºckgef√ºhrt. This method was developed and applied for the first time by his assistant Peter Kramer in G√∂ttingen, as a technique (spontaneous filtration) which uses the intrinsic pressure of the patient's circulation for dissociating blood plasma, in order to acutely support cardiac function during cardiac failure. Later the different techniques of hemofiltration (CAVH, CVVH etc.) were further developed. Hemofiltration was regarded by Willem Kolff in a letter to Scheler as the next step since Kolff's invention of dialysis.  Drug safety research  Scheler had a lifelong interest in pharmacology since his early work at the Max- Planck-Institut f√ºr experimentelle Medizin. After the invention of hemofiltration, and the early, tragic death of Peter Kramer, he increasingly focussed on his work at the committee for drug safety in Germany Arzneimittelkommission. He belonged to this committee since 1975, from 1981 until 1993 he became its president. During this time a number of political decisions were strongly contested, such as the introduction of a 'positive list' of drugs which could only be reimbursed by public health care insurance, and which Scheler successfully opposed. He was also involved in the foundation of an institute for drug law at the university of G√∂ttingen, which has by now been further developed to a leading institution of medicine law. Scheler received an honorary doctorate of the law department of the university of G√∂ttingen in recognition of his contributions to this institute in 1995.  Further work  Scheler published approximately 300 papers on a number of topics concerning hypertension, renal and cardiac failure, diabetic nephropathy and other topics together with his clinical research group.

The tour began on January 5, 2018, at the Target Center in Minneapolis, and visited cities across North America, South America, Oceania and Europe.  Background  Del Rey's fifth studio album, Lust for Life was officially released worldwide on July 21, 2017. During the months leading up to the album's release, fans and press speculated whether or not Del Rey would embark on a headlining concert tour in support of the album, as she did not for her previous release, Honeymoon. In an interview for Beats 1 on July 12, 2017, Zane Lowe asked Del Rey if she planned to go on a world tour and she seemed unsure, but during the following months Del Rey began to announce various one-off promotional concerts across the United Kingdom and United States. The promotional tour took place from July to October 2017, and consisted of concerts at intimate venues in London, cities in California and New York City, as well as shows at the Echo Arena Liverpool and the SSE Hydro in the United Kingdom. On August 19, 2017, Del Rey confirmed in a video via Instagram that she would be embarking on an official world tour in support of Lust for Life, as her first official headlining concert tour since The Endless Summer Tour in 2015, which was in support of Ultraviolence. Del Rey teased many details of the tour during the following weeks, she informed fans of what continents she would be visiting and how to purchase tickets through presale. The first dates for the LA to the Moon Tour were eventually announced on September 27, 2017, with a leg of North American dates, and on the same day Del Rey announced that she would be appearing at various South American festivals. Tickets for the North American shows became available for presale on September 29, followed by general sale on October 2. The North American leg is supported by American singer Jhen√© Aiko and Colombian-American singer Kali Uchis. Australian and European dates for the tour were announced on October 16, 2017.European dates:  On January 16, 2018, it was announced that American singer B√∏rns, whom Del Rey had recently collaborated with on two tracks for his second studio album Blue Madonna, would be joining Del Rey as the opening act for the Australian leg of the tour. Development and stage In an interview with MTV during October 2017, Del Rey stated that she was working to create a stage design for the tour that incorporates \\"lots of senses\\", and beach themed projections with \\"beautiful structures that move in and out of the stage to give it a classic feeling\\". The stage design, designed by Jason Ardizzone-West, was revealed once the tour began on January 5, 2018. The stage features an array of beach-themed props and is backed by a large screen displaying visuals designed by Storme Whitby- Grubb. Terence Cawley of The Boston Globe described the set-up as a \\"microcosm of [Del Rey's] beloved California\\" with a display of rock formations, palm trees, and beach chairs. Reed Fischer of GoMN similarly described the stage as \\"pure Los Angeles\\", suiting the title of the tour, \\"LA to the Moon\\", with \\"projections of crashing waves, a fast-moving highway, and a sun-drenched swimming pool danced on the stage floor throughout the night\\".

They were the successor models to the CFX-9970G, the first Casio calculator with computer algebra system, or CAS, a program for symbolic manipulation of mathematical expressions. The calculators were discontinued and succeeded by the Casio ClassPad 300 in 2003.  History  In 1999, Casio released a graphing calculator Algebra FX 2.0. The modified model Algebra FX 2.0 Plus was released in 2001 with additional functionalities in the financial calculation, statistics, and differential equations. The calculators were designed for usages in the classroom, where target markets were students and educators. They were aimed at helping students learn to solve algebra problems, where step-by-step solutions could be auto-generated. The Algebra FX series was the successor of the CFX-9970G, the first Casio calculator with computer algebra system (CAS) released in 1998. The computer algebra system in the Algebra FX series had been largely improved from the previous model so that more mathematical functions were added. The Casio's CAS was mainly developed by its R&D; team and Professor John Kenelly of Clemson University. The calculators were sold to different parts of the world. Casio had used different product names in France, following their French predecessors. The Graph 100 and the Graph 100+ were respectively the Algebra FX 2.0 and the Algebra FX 2.0 Plus. The Algebra FX 2.0 Plus was discontinued in 2003 and succeeded by the Casio ClassPad series, where the calculators have stylus-based touch screens. However, the Graph 100+ was continued to be sold in France until 2015, a time when Casio removed the product from its website.  Specifications   Power and Dimension  The calculators are powered by four AAA batteries used for primary power. It also uses one lithium battery CR2032 for a memory backup when the primary power is down. All program memories will be deleted if both primary power and memory backup power are removed or down. The calculators consume power at the rate of 0.2 W. Based on the manufacturer's data sheet, zinc-carbon R03 AAA batteries and alkaline LR03 batteries can supply power for 140 hours and 230 hours for continuous display of main menu. The back-up battery can operate for about two years. The calculators weigh about 213 grams including batteries. Their dimensions are 19.5 mm (H) √ó 82 mm (W) √ó 178 mm (D).  Display and Keyboard  Casio Graph 100+ The Algebra FX 2.0 series incorporates a black-and-white LCD Dot-Matrix display with a graphic resolution of 128 by 64 pixels. The calculators can display up to 21 characters on each of their 8 display lines. The main menu consists of icons referring to different operating modes and applications. Inside each mode, the bottom line is reserved for up to 6 function key menu tips, which can be selected from buttons F1 to F6 on the calculator's keyboard. The display's contrast can be adjusted from a system manager menu. The calculator's keyboard can be separated into the lower, middle, and top parts. The lower part of the keyboard consists of numeric and operational keys, where the EXE button is used to execute calculations and select commands. The middle part contains more sophisticated mathematical function keys, SHIFT and ALPHA keys, and directional pads. The SHIFT and ALPHA keys are used to access functions and alphabets appearing on top of buttons. The top part consists of buttons F1 to F6, used to select function menu tips. In terms of keypads, there are two differences between the Algebra FX 2.0 and its French version Graph 100+. In the Graph 100+, the buttons EXP and ab/c are replaced by √ó10x and a+b/c, respectively.  Memory and Processor  The calculators come with a main program memory (RAM) of 146 kilobytes and a storage flash memory of 768 kilobytes. It was the first time that Casio adopted a flash storage into its calculator production. The program memory is used to store program files, calculator settings, and variables for matrices, statistics, graphs, tables, equations, etc. The storage memory is used to stored add-in applications, which can be loaded through a computer. Memory usage with listed categories can be viewed from a system manager menu. In a hardware side, the calculators contain three different memory chips: a mask ROM, a flash ROM, and a RAM. The mask ROM is where the calculators store their operating system. It has a size of 4 megabytes from a chip R27T3202L manufactured by OKI Electric Industry. Since the mask ROM is non- reprogrammable, the calculator operating system cannot be upgraded, unlike the newer Casio calculators. The flash ROM is a chip LP62S2048AX from AMIC Technology. It has an actual size of 1 megabyte and is reprogrammable. The RAM is a chip 29LV800CBTI from Macronix International. It has an actual size of 256 kilobytes. They are all placed on the same motherboard. The Algebra FX series runs on a 16-bit microprocessor, the NEC V30MX. The microprocessor is tuned at a clock frequency of 8 megahertz and supports the Intel 8088 instruction set.  Features   Graphing  The Algebra FX series is capable of generating different types of two-dimensional plots. Compatible graphs include rectangular one-variable functions, polar equations, parametric equations, and inequalities, where users can store and plot simultaneously up to 20 graphs. The composite functions made of up to 5 other functions can also be drawn. The calculators provide options to control what appears on a graph screen including graph range and zoom functions. Curves on the graph can be traced by a cursor, where local maximum, local minimum, and intersections of the curves can be solved by a graph solver tool. Conics having their axes parallel to x-axis or y-axis can be plotted through a separate application. This means that the calculators cannot plot other conic/quadratic equations Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+Dx+Ey+F=0 where B is not equal to 0. The Algebra FX series cannot plot any implicit function of two variables, while the Texas Instrument's TI-89 series can. In addition to the simple graphing tool, the calculators also provide a dynamic graph mode, where real-time changes of the graphs, affected by changes in variables and coefficients, are visualized.  Equation Solver  In the equation solver mode, the Algebra FX series is able to solve simultaneous linear equations, polynomials, and arbitrary equations. The calculators can solve simultaneous linear equations up to 30 unknown variables and polynomials of degrees up to 30. This was a huge improvement from its predecessor CFX-9970G, where only six variables are accepted for simultaneous linear equations and three is the maximum degree the polynomials can take. Casio also introduced a new solve module of arbitrary input equations for the first time. Given an initial starting value and range, the module will calculate one nearby root and return to the users.  Computer Algebra System  The Casio's computer algebra system (CAS) was first developed for the CFX-9970G in 1998. The following are the functionalities of the CAS in the CFX-9970G: * Expansion, factorization, collection, and combination of algebraic expressions * Sum and product of sequences * Integration, differentiation, and tangent expression of functions. In the Algebra FX series, the computer algebra system was largely improved from its predecessor. The new features include calculating limits, Taylor's series, arc lengths, etc. There are some reported bugs of the calculator's computer algebra system. For instance, the calculators incorrectly calculate a third order Taylor's polynomial for cos sqrt x with respect to x = 0 by returning 1 instead of 1-x/2+x^2/24-x^3/720.  Communication  The Algebra FX series has an ability to communicate with both other calculators in the same series and personal computers. The device can link to another device via a SB-62 cable, a cable where both ends are 2.5 mm stereo jacks. The communication is managed by the data communication program inside the calculators, where users can choose between transmitting and receiving modes. The users are able to transfer various types of data such as programs, equations, and graphs from one calculator to another. The calculators can send and receive with a speed up to 38.4 kbps (kilobits per second) for general data and 9.6 kbps for screenshots. The communication is in a form of the half-duplex asynchronous serial communication without a parity bit. The device can communicate with a CASIO label printer via the SB-62 cable, where screenshots can be printed. The calculators can also communicate with the PCs via a SB-87 or SB-88 cable. Both cables have a 2.5 mm stereo jack at one end and a DB-9 connector for the SB-87 and a USB port for the SB-88 at the another end. The communication is in the same form and speed as in the calculator to calculator communication. The PC programs that deal with the communication are the FA-123 and FA-124 (newer version) PC-Link, where transfers of data and screenshots are managed. In a technical side, the cable SB-87 is based on a US patent 5504864, where the technology was previously used in the Casio's diary models. The cable was designed to shift the voltage from 6 volts at the calculator's end to 12 volts at the PC's RS-232 end. The chip MAX232 or MAX233 by Maxim Integrated was a core component used to level-shift the voltages between the RS-232 and TTL standards. The SB-88 cable was later developed to embed a USB port into the cable. The Plus model can communicate with the Casio data analyzer EA-100 via the SB-62 cable. The data loggers are capable of sampling and collecting data such as voltage, temperature, light intensity, motion, and sound from the environment via available probes. The same features are also seen in other calculator manufacturers such as the Texas Instrument's Calculator-Based Laboratory and the Hewlett Packard's StreamSmart.  Additional features for the Plus version  The modified model Algebra FX 2.0 Plus was released in 2001 with additional functionalities. The features added are advanced statistics calculations, financial calculations, differential equations, EA-100 data logging, and tutorial modes. They can be accessed from the main calculator menu. In the Advanced Statistics Calculation application, the calculators are able to perform different types of regression analysis, where corresponding tests, confidence intervals, and distributions can be determined. Different types of tests, including Z-test, T-test, œá2-test, and F-test, can be calculated based on inputted data, along with ANOVA analysis. Moreover, the calculators also support calculations of probability density and cumulative probability in the given basic probability distributions. Though not as competent as the dedicated financial calculators in the market, the Algebra FX 2.0 Plus includes capabilities in calculating simple interest, compound interest, cash flow analysis, amortization, and interest rate conversion. Apart from basic financial calculations, depreciation and bond analysis are also supported. All additional functionalities appeared in the Algebra FX 2.0 Plus, except the tutorial mode, are carried to its successor line, the Casio Classpad series.  Programming  The Algebra FX series is capable of compiling programs inside a Program menu. The calculators employ a BASIC-based programming language, unofficially named as Casio-BASIC. As the language has a linear structure, commands and calculations are executed line- by-line sequentially. Casio-BASIC also supports program flow control syntaxes, including a conditional jump \`IF\`, a loop control \`FOR\`, a conditional loop control \`WHILE\`, a program control \`CTRL\`, and a logical operation \`LOGIC\`. Programs can be entered manually on the calculators by the users, where they can select control functions from function key menu tips at the bottom of the screen. In addition to functions appeared in BASIC programming, the calculators support usages of many mathematical functions in many areas, such as exponentials, trigonometry, linear algebra, and calculus. Correspondingly, the calculators can store different types of data, including lists, tables, graphs, and matrices, in the main memories so that users can recall them later. Apart from displaying texts as outputs on the screen, the calculators are able to illustrate graphics. For instance, lines and circles can be drawn directly into the screen either by controlling each pixel individually or by calling readymade functions. Under the calculator's built-in file management, all programs can be password-protected from editing and execution.  Use in schools   United Kingdom  The Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ), a council providing GCSE and GCE (O- and A- Level) and Highers, are prohibiting calculators with symbolic algebra manipulation and symbolic differentiation/integration from the examinations. Therefore, the Algebra FX 2.0 series is not allowed due to its computer algebra system (CAS).  United States  In the United States, the Algebra FX 2.0 and the Algebra FX 2.0 Plus are allowed by the College Board on the SAT, the SAT Subject Tests in Mathematics, and AP examinations in Biology, Calculus, Chemistry, Physics, and Statistics. However, the calculators are banned from the ACT examination due to their capability in the computer algebra system (CAS).

Brodsky, and Carol Weiss King. Background New York University School of Law's Vanderbilt Hall, where Shorr studied Isaac Shorr was born about 1882 in Russia (at that time, the Russian Empire). In 1904, his family emigrated to the United States. In 1913, he graduated from New York University School of Law after studying at night and working by day as a cigarmaker. In 1915, he was admitted to the New York bar. Career Paterson silk strike leaders Patrick Quinlan, Carlo Tresca, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Adolph Lessig, and Bill Haywood‚ÄìTresca was well known to Shorr and his law partners During World War I, Shorr was a partner of Hale, Nelles, and Shorr, which \\"defended radicals.\\" In 1920, Hale wrote to Tom Mooney, \\"We are in a hot bed of repression here, with only a very few lawyers who are willing and able to handle the situation, and who are hopelessly overworked.\\" His partners were Swinburne Hale and Walter Nelles. Carlo Tresca, a prominent Italian anarchist, was well acquainted with them. Shorr and Nelles served as counsel to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The firm support legal investigations published in the 67-page Report upon the Illegal Practices of the United States Department of Justice by the National Popular Government League (NGPL); Swinburne Hale did a majority of the work on the report. In 1920, Shorr testified before Congress that he was representing more than 60 people involved in deportation during the Palmer Raids. In fact, during the Palmer Raids, the U.S. Government noted: > Mr. Shorr is well known to the department because of his activities as > attorney for these people. He many times has appeared as attorney for > alients who have never seen him until the hearing and disclaimed any > knowledge of his retainer. Mr. Shorr is one of the most active leaders of > these people in the United States, and at the present time his office is the > address at which persons in this country receive incendiary correspondence > from persons deported on the Buford. Joseph R. Brodsky and Carol Weiss King worked with this firm, as did Vito Marcantonio (whose mentor was Brodsky). In 1924, Shorr and Nelles appealed United States ex rel. Tisi v.

Clarence Darrow circa 1925, whom Shorr helped defend two Italian anti-fascists in 1927 In 1927, Shorr associated with Clarence Darrow and Arthur Garfield Hays to help defend the anti‚ÄêFascists Calogero Greco and Donato Carillo for the alleged murder of the Fascist Joseph Carisi (Giuseppe Carisi) in the Bronx. On December 9, 1927, the trial began, and the full defense team included Darrow, Hays, Shorr, and King. They won an acquittal. In 1934, the American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born (ACPFB) retained Shorr and King defended Domenico Sallitti (also known as Domenic Sallitti, an \\"alien anarchist\\") in the Ferrero-Sallitti Case in San Francisco. Sallitti's friend Valerio Isca organized their defense, created a Ferrero-Sallittii Defense Conference, and enlisted Rose Pesotta of the ILGWU to help raise bail.

Brewer, Woodbridge, 2000, p. 88. though it may have been as little as half that,Cf. Martha Carlin, Historical Gazetteer of London before the Great Fire. St. Botolph Aldgate: Minories, East Side; the Abbey of St Clare; Holy Trinity Minories, Institute of Historical Research Library, London, 1987), ii(2).12. at the spot in the parish of St. Botolph, outside the medieval walls of the City of London at Aldgate that later, by a corruption of the term minoresses, became known as The Minories, a placename found also in other English towns including Birmingham, Colchester, Newcastle upon Tyne and Stratford-upon-Avon. Franciscan women As some varieties of the monastery's formal name make clear, the women of this abbey were members of the Order of St Clare, otherwise known as Clarisses, or more usually in English as Poor Clares. This was and is the female branch of the Order of St Francis or Order of Friars Minor known as Franciscans. In the structures typical of the mendicant orders, they were professed nuns of the Franciscan Second Order. As an expression of humility, the male Franciscans had adopted for themselves the Latin term fratres minores (\\"lesser brothers\\"), rendered in English as \\"friars minor\\" or just \\"minors\\". In a similar way, the Poor Clares were known in Latin as sorores minores (\\"lesser sisters\\") and in medieval England as \\"minoresses\\". Foundation The Aldgate house was founded at least by 1291, when it is mentioned in the Taxatio Ecclesiastica, compiled in 1291-1292 at the behest of Pope Nicholas IV preparatory to papal taxation to finance a crusade to the Holy Land. Some think that there was perhaps a community operating on the site as early as 1281.Bert Roest, Order and Disorder: The Poor Clares between Foundation and Reform, Brill, Leiden, 2013, p. 125. The title of \\"founder\\" was later consistently attributed to Edmund Crouchback, Earl of Leicester and Earl of Lancaster, a son of Henry III of England and brother of King Edward I. The new monastery was to house a group of enclosed Poor Clares.Friaries: The minoresses without Aldgate, in William Page (ed.), A History of the County of London, vol. 1, London, 1909, pp. 516-519. British History Online http://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/london/vol1/pp516-519 [accessed 26 September 2017]. The members of the convent were brought to England by Edmund‚Äôs second wife, Blanche of Artois, who was the widow of Henry le Gros, King of Navarre, and regent of the Kingdom of Navarre during the minority of their daughter, Joan I. The high rank of the founder (and foundress) meant that the foundation was effected with a rapidity that contrasted with other minoresses houses in England.Cf. Jennifer Ward, English Noblewomen in the Later Middle Ages, Routledge, Abingdon, 2014, p. 155. A mild rule Though established only relatively recently (1212), the Poor Clares already had a mitigated form of their Rule, approved by Pope Urban IV, which allowed the Order to own property, as opposed to the restrictions originally laid down by the foundress, Clare of Assisi. The precise calibrated formulation of these matters is referred to as the Isabella Rule, after the sister of Louis IX of France (St Louis), St Isabella, who though never a nun had in 1256 founded the Poor Clares' Abbey of Longchamp in part of the Forest of Rouvray (now the Bois de Boulogne), west of Paris.David Aers (ed.), Medieval Literature and Historical Inquiry: Essays in Honor of Derek Pearsall, D.S. Brewer, Woodbridge, 2000, p. 88; A.F.C. Bourdillon, The Order of Minoresses in England, Manchester University Press, Manchester, 1922, pp. 13-15. Some indication of the degree of mitigation of St Clare‚Äôs early severity can perhaps be seen from an example taken from a century after the Abbey‚Äôs foundation. Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester, youngest child of King Edward III, and his wife Eleanor de Bohun placed their youngest surviving daughter Isabel (1386-1402) in the Abbey. It speaks volumes for the degree of austerity in the house that by the widowed Eleanor‚Äôs 1399 will, the daughter received a bed of cloth of gold, precious books and 40 pounds.Nicolas Nicholas Harris, Testamenta vetusta, vol. 1, Nichols, London, 1826, p. 147; David Aers (ed.), Medieval Literature and Historical Inquiry: Essays in Honor of Derek Pearsall, D.S. Brewer, Woodbridge, 2000, pp. 88-89. Eleanor was to die in the house and her daughter Isabel was to become the abbess. It so happened that Queen Blanche, wife to the Abbey‚Äôs founder Edmund Crouchback, was a niece of King Louis and his sister Isabella, the latter being the foundress of the Poor Clares' Abbey of Longchamp, heavily involved in the drawing up of the mitigated Rule named after her. Both Louis and Isabella would later be regarded as saints. The nuns arrive Though some secondary literature speak of the nuns brought to launch the new English Abbey being of Spanish origin, in all probability they came from France, and more exactly from Longchamp, founded by Blanche‚Äôs aunt, Isabella.Cf. Bert Roest, Order and Disorder: The Poor Clares Between Foundation and Reform, Brill, Leiden, 2013, p. 124; Edward Murray Tomlinson, A History of the Minories, London, Smith, London, 1907, pp. 12-16. We know that around 1293-1294 another house of Minoresses founded in England at Waterbeach in Cambridgeshire was populated by a group from Longchamp under the command of a former Abbess of Longchamp, Jeanne of Nevers.Bert Roest, Order and Disorder: The Poor Clares between Foundation and Reform, Brill, Leiden, 2013, p. 125. Moreover, the Rule prescribed for the Aldgate nuns by Pope Boniface VIII was that of Longchamp. That the Isabella Rule was in fact implemented at Aldate can be seen from a 15th-century English-language manuscript once belonging to the Abbey, and whose text represents the Isabella Rule.W.W. Seton (ed.), The Rewle of Sustris Menouresses enclosid, Oxford University Press, London, 1914 (= Early English Texts Society OS 148). As to the choice of women Franciscans for both Longchamp and Aldgate, an indication of the impetus of the Franciscan movement can be gained from the fact that in France alone, between 1220 and 1534 some 328 male Franciscan houses were founded.Richard W. Emery, The Friars in Medieval France, New York, 1962 Endowment and benefactions The founder, Earl Edmund, provided an initial endowment consisting of lands and tenements in the London suburbs and later in Derbyshire. Another early benefactor was Sir Henry le Galeys, Mayor of London in 1273 and 1281-1283. He died in 1302, having who endowed a chantry in the chapel of St Mary built by him in the nuns' church, and where he was buried. Notwithstanding this income and also important privileges and exemptions that were bestowed from an early date on the house by King Edward II and Pope Boniface VIII, the nuns' income seems to have been modest to poor. In 1290 we find a reference to the poor state of the buildings,Eileen Power, English Medieval Nunneries, c. 1275-1525, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1922, p. 171. and in the 14th century the nuns were repeatedly let off both ecclesiastical and civil taxes on the grounds of their poverty. Nevertheless, in that same century there came a series of substantial benefactions from influential figures, such as Queen Isabella, widow of Edward II, Margaret, Countess of Norfolk and John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster. Connections The heavy royal connections of the abbey‚Äôs beginnings appear to have imparted from the outset a certain cachet to the houseCf. Nancy Bradley Warren, Spiritual Economies: Female Monasticism in Later Medieval England, University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia, 2012, p. 58. and in particular in the early days women aspiring to become professed nuns had to be of noble birth,W.E. Hampton, The Ladies of the Minories, in The Ricardian 4 (1978) 15-22. though by the 14th century the daughters of wealthy merchants were also entering.Cf. Caroline Barron & Anne F. Sutton (edd.), Medieval London Widows, 1300-1500, Hambledon Press, London, 1994, p. 82. The presence of the noble and the rich within the abbey‚Äôs walls was not confined to nuns. After the death of her husband, Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick, in 1401, Margaret Beauchamp n√©e Ferrers, was given an indult from the pope to reside in the Abbey with three matrons as long as she wished, though presumably not as a nun. More surprisingly still, Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester, whom we have already seen placing his young daughter Isabel in the Abbey, had a house right next to the conventual church and was allowed to have a private entrance made through. Disasters Like the general population, the Abbey must have suffered more than once from the plague and other epidemics. In 1514 the Bubonic Plague reappeared in London and was severe enough to drive Henry VIII and Erasmus well away from the city, and a resurgence came the following year by April.J.F.D. Shrewsbury, A History of Bubonic Plague in the British Isles, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1970, p. 161. It is said that some twenty-seven of the abbey‚Äôs nuns died of it in 1515.Cf. John Gough Nichols (ed.), Chronicle of the Grey Friars of London, Camden Society, London 1852 (= Camden Society Old Series 53), p. 29; Claud Golding, London: The City, Hale, London, 1951, p. 275. It must have been shortly after the outbreak of plague that the convent buildings were destroyed by fire. In addition to the benefactions of private individuals, the mayor, aldermen, and citizens of London made a contributions of 200 marks, but at the special request of Cardinal Wolsey to the Court of Common Council, it was decided in 1520 to give 100 marks more to complete the building. It is ironic that Henry VIII also gave ¬£200 at this time, which did not impede his closing and despoiling the house less than two decades later. Abbesses The following list is incomplete. Furthermore, to judge by the more abundant data available from the mother house, the Abbey of Longchamp, it is possible that a nun could serve more than one term of office as abbess, even at a distance of several years. * Margaret (1294) * Juliana (1301) * Alice de Sherstede (1313) * Katharine de Ingham (1355)Nicolas Nicholas Harris, Testamenta vetusta, vol. 1, Nichols, London, 1826, pp. 56-58. * Isabella de Lisle (1397)Henry Fly, Some account of an abbey of nuns formerly situated in the street now called the Minories in the County of Middlesex, and Liberty of the Tower of London, in Archaeologia 15 (1806) 105-106. * Eleanor Scrope, (died 1398)Henry Fly, Some account of an abbey of nuns formerly situated in the street now called the Minories in the County of Middlesex, and Liberty of the Tower of London, in Archaeologia 15 (1806) 104. * Margaret Helmystede (1400) * Isabella of Gloucester (1421-1422)Henry Fly, Some account of an abbey of nuns formerly situated in the street now called the Minories in the County of Middlesex, and Liberty of the Tower of London, in Archaeologia 15 (1806) 105. * Margaret (1441) * Joan Barton (1479-1480) * Alice FitzLewes (1501) * Dorothy Cumberford (1524, 1526, and 1529) * Elizabeth Salvage, who in 1539 had to surrender the house. Seal The seal of the Abbey in 1371 depicted the Virgin Mary standing holding the Christ Child, which is not a particularly common motif in medieval English nunneries. At other periods the favoured image on the Abbey's seals seems to have been the Coronation of the Virgin.Roberta Gilchrist, Gender and Material Culture: The Archaeology of Religious Women, Routledge, London, 1994, p. 145. Dissolution According to the Valor Ecclesiasticus of 1535, the abbey‚Äôs income amounted to ¬£342, 5 shillings 10¬Ω pence gross, and ¬£318, 8 shillings 5 pence net, while its possessions included several rents in and around London, manors and lands on the Isle of Wight, Berkshire and Hertfordshire. The abbey was surrendered in March 1539, and the terms granted to the nuns were similar to those given in other nunneries. The abbess, Dame Elizabeth Salvage, received a life pension of ¬£40 a year, four nuns received life pensions of ¬£3, 3 shillings 8 pence each, ten nuns received ¬£2 13 shillings 4 pence, nine nuns ¬£2, and a novice ¬£1, 6 shillings 8 pence. No provision appears to have been made for the six lay sisters. Fate of the buildings Following the Dissolution, the abbey is said to have served for a time as the residence of John Clerk, Bishop of Bath and Wells, a veteran diplomat of Henry VIII; the King seizing the Bishop‚Äôs own London residence in compensation.Cf. Anthony Paul House, The City of London and the Problem of the Liberties, c. 1540 ‚Äì c. 1640, DPhil thesis, Faculty of Modern History, Oxford University 2006, p. 73: http://ptomng.com/thesis/ accessed 27 September 2017. It also came to house officers of the Tower of London. In 1552, under Edward VI, it was given to Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, the father of Lady Jane Grey.Walter Thornbury, Aldgate, the Minories and Crutched Friars, in Old and New London: Volume 2, London, 1878, pp. 245-250. British History Online http://www.british-ory.ac.uk/old-new-london/vol2/pp245-250 [accessed 27 September 2017]. In 1554 it reverted to government use, housing the Ordnance Office and its stores, transferred there from the Tower of London. Some of the abbey buildings survived until their destruction by fire in 1797. In 1964 the coffin of Anne de Mowbray, 8th Countess of Norfolk, who died aged eight, was unearthed by chance at the abbey site, and later reburied in Westminster Abbey.

Cummings, 412 U.S. 735 (1973), is a Supreme Court decision upholding statewide legislative apportionment plans for Connecticut. The Court admitted that these plans entailed \\"substantial inequalities in the population of the representative districts.\\" It observed that \\"the States have made virtually no attempt to justify their failure 'to construct districts ... as nearly of equal population as is practicable.\\" It was a Fourteenth Amendment case. At issue was whether the election districts had been gerrymandered in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Facts and prior history The various states were eligible, and in some cases required, to redraw certain House districts and state assembly districts as a result of the 1970 Census. Connecticut's assembly has 30 senators and 151 house members. A perfect apportionment would have had 84,228 citizens per senate seat and 20,081 per assembly seat. In Connecticut, the township is the primary unit of government, not the county. The districting commission developed a plan that almost perfectly divided the state into thirty senate districts (mean deviation 0.45%, or +/- 400). The plan for the assembly, respecting the township boundaries as required by the state constitution, had a mean deviation of 1.9%, with the maximum difference between districts 7.83%. The Court did not discuss the choice of townships that composed each district, only the imbalance in size. A voter in a small district would have more influence than a voter in a large district. In other cases, the court had found deviations of 5.97% and 13.1% unacceptable. Democrats alleged the plan amounted to a political gerrymander and was biased in favor of the Republican Party. The District Court had found against the plan‚Äîand by extension, the Republicans. J. Brian Gaffney was chairman of the state Republican Party and is the named petitioner in this case. Theodore R. Cummings was a long-time Connecticut Democrat, before he died in 2015. Court decision The Supreme Court's decision was announced on March 18, 1973, and delivered by Justice White. The Connecticut districting system, with mean deviation of 1.9%, was approved. > Minor deviations from mathematical equality among state legislative > districts are insufficient to make out a prima facie case of invidious > discrimination under the Fourteenth Amendment so as to require justification > by the State. Implications For the past fifty years, the two principal guidelines for determining whether a state redistricting plan is fair are: > One man's vote in a congressional election is to be worth as much as > another's > A State must make an honest and good faith effort to construct its districts > as nearly of equal population as is practicable, but that absolute equality > was a practical impossibility. Mathematical exactness or precision is hardly > a workable constitutional requirement. Subsequent analysis of the facts of the case provided analysts arguments against First-past-the-post voting systems. In 2019, the Court will address partisan redistricting in Rucho v. Common Cause and Lamone v. Benisek.

She is also a Professor in the Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, University of Melbourne, and Program Leader of Stem Cells Australia. She is internationally recognized both for her work on the systems biology of kidney development and also for her pioneering studies into potential regenerative therapies in the kidney. In 2015, Professor Melissa Little and her team at Murdoch Children‚Äôs Research Institute produced the world‚Äôs first kidney in a dish. Known today as kidney organoids, this research has become a foundation of ongoing work to find a regenerative solution for kidney disease.  Early life and education  Melissa Little was born in Brisbane, Australia on 5 December 1963, the middle daughter of three girls. Her father, Ian Little, was a soils chemist with the CSIRO Cunningham laboratories. She graduated from Kenmore State High School in 1980. She completed her BSc at the University of Queensland with 1st Class Honours in Physiology in 1984. Her PhD studies were performed in the laboratory of Professor Peter Smith at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research enrolled through Biochemistry at the University of Queensland (conferred 1990). An alumnus of The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia, Melissa worked for more than 20 years at the Institute for Molecular Bioscience, where her research focused on the molecular basis of kidney development, renal disease and repair. In 2004 she graduated from the Australian Institute of Company Directors.  Research on kidney development, disease and regeneration  Little started her research career studying Wilm's Tumour, a childhood kidney cancer. She was awarded a Royal Society Endeavour Fellowship to move to the Medical Research Council Human Genetics Unit in Edinburgh to undertake postdoctoral training with Nicholas Hastie. Here she worked on the gene WT1, the gene that is mutated in a subset of Wilm's tumour patients. She returned to Australia to continue to work on WT1, but concentrating on its essential role in the normal development of the urogenital system. Her work focuses on the molecular aspects of kidney development, with applications to stem cell biology and regenerative medicine. Little and her team have developed an approach to recapitulate nephrogenesis, the formation of nephrons, in a dish. By knowing where the different kidney cells come from and how they develop she has developed a system to regenerate them from pluripotent stem cells. Using embryonic stem cells, or induced pluripotent stem cells from a patient, her group has described a cocktail of growth factors that can drive development into kidney cells. The group were able to develop self organising organoids 7mm long over 18 days. These small balls of cells have differentiated most of the cells that form the kidneys, including collecting ducts, podocytes, vasculature cells, nephrons and loops of Henle, and are closely related transcriptionallly to first and second trimester developing kidneys. Further research into the organoids by Prof Little's Laboratory has demonstrated robust trancriptional reproducibility of the model and utilised induced pluripotent stem cells generated from patients to study their kidney disease.  Contributions to Australian Science policy  In the late 1990s, Little was a member of the Strategic Review of Health and Medical Research, chaired by Peter Wills. This review proposed a Virtuous Cycle between research, government and the commercial sector . As a result of these recommendations, the budget of the National Health and Medical Research Council was doubled over the next 10 years. She went on to serve on the Implementation Committee of that review and served under Robin Batterham, Chief Scientist, to identify strategic priorities across Australian science. A member of the NHMRC Research Committee for 6 years, she was also a member of the most recent review of health and medical research, chaired by Simon McKeon, which led to the establishment of the Medical Research Future Fund and the Biomedical Translation Fund.  Professional Associations  Little is the current Program Leader of Stem Cells Australia, an organisation that aims to \\"Bring together Australia's premier life scientists to tackle the big questions in stem cell science\\". She is also a guest editor with the scientific journal Development. She is the serving theme director of Cell Biology at the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute and directs the MCRI Stem Cell Medicine Strategic Priority area. She is also the President of the Australasian Society for Stem Cell Research and a Board Member of the International Society for Stem Cell Research.

Initially appearing in musical comedies and as an accompanist to the Arruyo Chorus, she began teaching singing and founded the National Children's Theater Company in 1931. In 1946, she inaugurated her group of youth actors' appearance on radio and in 1958 took them to television. She received Guatemala's highest honor, the Order of the Quetzal in 1962 and in 1992 a presidential honor was named in her memory to recognize exceptional contributions to the arts. Early life Mar√≠a Marta Bola√±os Schaeffer was born on 15 January 1897 in Guatemala City, Guatemala to Josefina Schaeffer and Salvador Bola√±os. She studied acting with Adriana Saravia de Palarea and performed in Guatemala's vaudeville and zarzuela theaters. Her debut was in the theater operated by Jes√∫s de Qui√±√≥nez and later, she performed at the Teatro Renacimiento. Her greatest success was during 1918 and 1919, when she performed in pieces like The Count of Luxembourg, The Duchess of Bal Tabarin and The Merry Widow, under the direction of Alberto de la Riva. She also studied piano under Felipe Tronchi and Enrique Tuit and served as the accompanist of the Arruyo Chorus for a decade. Career Bola√±os began giving singing and theatrical classes, working with several different public schools. She also composed music, with lyrics written by Gustavo Schwartz. Some of her most noted pieces are Alma mixque√±a, Chancaca, El zopilote, Negros frijolitos and Pepita. In 1931, she founded the National Children's Theater Company. The young actors performed morning shows for children in the Teatro Capital and Teatro Palace. In 1946, , who was the director of the National Radio TGW (es), proposed to Bola√±os that her Children's Theater begin performing on the radio. Adapting their material of children's stories dramatized by students, the program, which featured a cast of youth between five and seventeen years old, first went on air 15 August 1946. In 1958, Radioteatro Infantil (Children's Radio Theater) was inaugurated on television, appearing on the country's first television station, Televisi√≥n Nacional Channel 8. In 1962, she received the Order of the Quetzal, Guatemala's highest honor. Death and legacy Bola√±os died on 4 June 1963 and in 1992 was posthumously recognized for her contributions to the arts when a presidential honor, the Order of Martha Bola√±os de Prado, was created to be conferred on exceptional artists in the fields of dance, singing and theater. The first recipient of new order was her daughter, Marina Prado Bola√±os, who had taken over the direction of the Radioteatro Infantil after her mother's death. The radio show she founded is still being produced and is now directed by her granddaughter, Anabella Palma Andrade.

Location The Hill is located on the corner of 30th and Laidley streets, near the outskirts of Noe Valley, where wooden stairs and a steep dirt path lead to lookout point of about 500 feet, which offers excellent views of the Bay Bridge and downtown San Francisco. Characteristics The top of the rocky hill has two large old eucalyptus trees where a wooden rope swing once stood, but after recent renovations by the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department, the swing has been taken down. The $150,000 renovation project included the opening of Beacon Trail, a path connecting Billy Goat Hill to Walter Haas Playground, in July 2016. Billy Goat Hill is a destination for tourists and locals to take-in views of the city. There is an array of wildflowers and greenery, including California saxifrage, which can only be found in two other areas of San Francisco. History The Hill is what remains of a quarry that was mined by the Gray Brothers in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Once the Quarry closed, the Hill became a neighborhood common space, but also a dumping ground for locals. It was not until 1975 when it officially became a city park; only a mere 3.5 acres, the park also includes a small network of trails, which has now expanded to The Walter Hass Playground.

He was suffect consul for the nundinium September-October 80 as the colleague of Sextus Neranius Capito.Fasti Septempeda () He is known entirely from inscriptions. Acilius Strabo belongs to one of the major branches of the gens Acilii, but one which is not as familiar as the Acilii Glabriones and the Acilii Aviones. Further details about the Acili Strabones are uncertain.  Assignment to Cyrenaica  Acilius Strabo's first appearance in history is in Tacitus, as praetor. He had been sent by the emperor Claudius to Cyrenaica to resolve property disputes over personal estates that king Ptolemy Apion had bequeathed to the Roman people along with his kingdom. Consequently, some of the landowners objected to his judgments, and in the reign of Nero they petitioned the Roman senate for redress. The Senate responded that they had no knowledge of the instructions Claudius had given Strabo, and passed the petition to the emperor, who resolved the matter.Tacitus, Annales, XIV.18 A number of inscriptions bearing Strabo's name and dated to the reign of Claudius have been found in North Africa.Those in Latin include , , , , Some bear dates ranging from AD 53 to 56;A. F. Elmayer and H. Maehler, \\"A Boundary Inscription from Roman Cyrenaica\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 164 (2008), pp. 136-138 if Strabo was praetor in the year 53, then it took him 27 years to reach the office of consul, whereas the Lex Villia Annalis specifies a period of ten years between the office of praetor and consul for senators who were not in the patrician class. While lengthy periods between the two offices are documented for other senators, it is unusual.  Date of his consulate  Until the recovery of the Fasti Septempeda, the date of Acilius Strabo's consulate has been based on an inscription found in Napoli, which is dated both by both suffect consuls and a local official to AD 71.This is the date given by Paul Gallivan, \\"The Fasti for A. D. 70-96\\", Classical Quarterly, 31 (1981), pp. 187f, 213 However, with the discovery of the Fasti Septempeda a number of authorities have endorsed a date in the year 80, while some, such as Werner Eck, have proposed there were two men with the same name: one consul in 71, who handled the property disputes of Cyrenaica; the other, his son, was the consul of 80.Eck, \\"Acilius II,11\\", Der Neue Pauly, volume 1 (Stuttgart: Metzler, 1996), col. 88 Eck's suggestion would explain the lengthy period between the praetorship and consulship; it arises from confusion of two homonymous senators.  Governor of Germania Superior  Another inscription, found in the ancient quarries of the Brohlbach, has led to another instance of disputed identity. This is on a stone altar, which is dated to the period when \\"L. Acilius Strabo\\" was \\"legati Augusti\\". It is unclear whether by legatus this Acilius Strabo was governor of Germania Superior, or possibly the commander of a legion stationed in the province; the word is commonly used to indicate both. The date of his activity in Germania Superior depends on the interpretation of this inscription. If Acilius Strabo was a legionary commander, then the altar dates to the time before his consulate, likely the late 70s. If he was governor, it would date to the time after; in the latest compilation of governors of this province, there is a gap between the years 83 and 87,Werner Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron, 12 (1982), pp. 281-362 and Strabo's term of office could have fallen then. There is also the possibility that this Acilius Strabo may not be the suffect consul discussed above, but a polyonymous senator, Lucius Stertinus Quintillianus Acilius Strabo Gaius Curiatius Maternus Clodius Nummus, consul in 114. The name of this later Acilius Strabo points to a testamentary adoption by a Lucius Acilius Strabo, who may be identical to the consul of 80. This is the case when a man dies without heirs, and wishes to preserve his lineage; and if it is what happened, the consul of 80 was the last of his line.

The camp rapidly became notorious for the great loss of life suffered by soldiers due to the exposed conditions, shortage of supplies and inadequate medical facilities. Following victories including the relief of Derry and the capture of Carrickfergus, Schomberg marched his forces south from Ulster. Arriving on 7 September 1689, Schomberg established his camp close to the town of Dundalk in County Louth. He did not originally intend to stay long there, but instead use it as a staging post on the way to the capital at Dublin. However a shortage of supplies led to delays.Childs p.158 Between September and November, 5,674 troops died of illness.Bartlett & Jeffrey p.195 After a stand off with the Jacobite Irish Army under James II ended without a major battle being fought, Schomberg abandoned any plans of a further advance. His troops went into winter quarters, dispersed across Ulster. William of Orange was angered by Schomberg's lack of activity and decided to personally take command in Ireland the following year. For the 1690 campaign thousands of reinforcements had to be shipped in to replace those lost at Dundalk. This Army then went on to victory at the Battle of the Boyne in July and the capture of Dublin. References Bibliography * Childs, John. The Williamite Wars in Ireland.

Dr. Truban was then Senate minority leader of what was then a small party as the Byrd Organization disintegrated. Early life William Truban was born in the unincorporated town of Gormania in Garrett County, Maryland on October 6, 1924 to Joseph Truban and his wife May Parks. He was single and classified as a gardener or groundskeeper when he registered for the draft upon turning 18.

His son Thomas S. Truban later took over the veterinary practice. Political career Truban won a special election in 1970 after J. Kenneth Robinson, who had represented the then-rural 27th District in the Virginia Senate as a Republican, won election to the U.S. House of Representatives. Dr. Truban won 61% of the votes cast in that election and handily defeated Democrat Robert Smalley. Four years later, he defeated Democrat Thelma T.

Dr. Truban served as the sole Republican on the Senate Finance Committee and as Senate minority leader until November 1991.

A fiscal conservative as had been both his long-serving predecessor Democrats Harry F. Byrd Sr. and Harry F. Byrd Jr., Truban sat on the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) which in 1990 proposed establishing a state cash reserve to protect Virginia‚Äôs bond rating and keep the state on firm financial footing during economic downturns. Although the proposal initially failed, voters ratified the Virginia Revenue Stabilization Fund, better known as the rainy-day fund, in 1992, and it became law in 1993. Later years Truban continued his veterinary practice, but when health issues accumulated, he entered an assisted living facility in Woodstock, Virginia. There he died on February 3, 2007, survived by his widow and six children, as well as grandchildren. One of his sons, William A.

This unit includes an entire battalion, acting as support and reserve for Airborne units which contains for example, military war dogs and Airborne Pathfinders and an instruction battalion responsible for the forming of new paratroopers. The RP√°ra is part of the Rapid Reaction Brigade that includes other elite units like the Army Comandos and Army Special Operations. Like other Portuguese Airborne units, the troops of the School are nicknamed \\"Boinas Verdes\\" (Green Berets) while recruits are nicknamed \\"Catatuas\\". History Origins =The Airborne Battalion= After the successful use of airborne forces in the Second World War by Germany and the Allies, other armed forces began to examine the possibility of forming parachute Troops for special missions. In 1955, Portuguese Defense Ministry cabinet approved a request for funds for airborne paratroop training. Two Army captains went to France to take the French parachute course at the √âcole de Troupes Aeroport√®es. After the Portuguese Air Force was created as an independent branch of the military, was decided that the paratroopers would be part of the Air Force, much like the German organizational structure during World War II. The BCP - Batalh√£o de Ca√ßadores P√°raquedistas (Paratrooper Hunters Battalion) was formed in 1956. The paratroopers were issued unique berets and camo uniforms. Airborne forces initially jumped using the venerable German tri-motored Junkers Ju 52 aircraft. The unit was first deployed to Tancos, which still serves as headquarters for today's Portuguese airborne forces. =Colonial Wars and the Regiment= In 1961, conflict erupted in the African colonies, which soon evolved into a series of guerrilla campaigns against Portuguese rule. Troops were required to fight in Africa, and the BCP became the RCP, or Regimento de Ca√ßadores P√°ra-quedistas (Paratrooper Hunter, or Ranger Regiment). By this time, the men were armed with the modern 7,62mm ArmaLite AR-10 infantry rifle, a weapon previously not seen in Western military forces.Afonso, Aniceto and Gomes, Carlos de Matos, Guerra Colonial (2000), pp. 183-184 The paratroopers liked the accuracy and mobility of the AR-10, but supplies were embargoed after initial deliveries were completed in 1960, and paratroopers were later issued the collapsible-stock variant of the m/961 (G3) rifle. As time went on, more airborne units were created in Angola, Mozambique, and other areas outside Portugal to fight the various separatist guerrilla movements. Due to Portuguese Air Force control over airborne units, the paratroops' battalion numbers reflected their subordination to local Air Force command, 1st Air Region (Air Force command over north atlantic territories) command 11th (Portugal) and 12th (Guin√©-Bissau) Paratrooper Hunter Battalion, 2nd Air Region (Air Force command over South Atlantic territories) command the 21st Paratrooper Hunter Battalion (Angola) and the 3rd Air Region (Air Force command over the Indian ocean territories) command the 31st and 32nd Paratrooper Hunter Battalion (Mozambique). =Paratrooper casualties= * 12th Paratrooper Hunter Battalion: 56 dead (3 officers, 6 sergeants and 47 soldiers). * 21st Paratrooper Hunter Battalion: 47 dead (5 officers, 9 sergeants and 33 soldiers) * 31st Paratrooper Hunter Battalion: 39 dead (2 officers, 6 sergeants and 31 soldiers) * 32nd Paratrooper Hunter Battalion: 18 dead (2 sergeants and 16 soldiers) A total of 160 Portuguese paratroopers were KIA. On April 25, 1974, a military coup led by left-wing members of the Portuguese Army ended the authoritarian government regime in Portugal, and the country moved towards fully democratic elections. Shortly afterwards, peace negotiations with the various African colonies resulted in an end to the African wars, followed by the independence of Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea- Bissau. Military reforms were instituted in Portugal in 1975, resulting in a reorganization of airborne forces. In November 2007, a Paratrooper was killed in a vehicle accident in Afghanistan Modern airborne forces structure  Parachute Troops Base School  On July 5, 1975, the BETP (Base Escola de Tropas P√°ra-Quedistas or Parachute Troops Base School) was formed at the RCP, which was disbanded and integrated into the CTP or Corpo de Tropas Paraquedistas Parachute Troops Corps) of the Portuguese Air Force. The CTP is responsible for changing the paratroopers from a counter-guerrilla force to a conventional airborne force capable of fighting in a possible NATO vs Warsaw Pact war, so a Light Paratrooper Brigade (BRIPARAS) was formed with three Paratrooper Battalions and a few support units. The Corps also raised several barracks across Portugal to garrison the new brigade, BOTP1 ‚Äì Base Operacional de Tropas P√°ra-quedistas n¬∫1 (1st Paratrooper Operational Base) at Monsanto and BOTP2 at S√£o Jacinto; some troops were also garrisoned in the BETP at Tancos. The BRIPARA structure included: * BOTP1: Paratrooper Battalion n¬∫11, Anti-Tank Company, Signals Company * BOTP2: Paratrooper Battalion n¬∫21, Services and Support Operational Group, Heavy Mortar Company * BETP: Paratrooper Battalion n¬∫31, Aeroterrestrial Operational Group Army integration In 1993, further changes in the organization of airborne forces took place when the Defense Minister decided that the entire corps should leave the Portuguese Air Force and become part of the Portuguese Army. This meant also that the Commandos Regiment would be disbanded and the commandos that had taken the parachute course would be part of the new unit which was named BAI - Brigada Aerotransportada Independente (Independent Airborne Brigade). The BETP then changed its name again to ETAT - Escola de Tropas Aerotransportadas (Airborne Troops School), the Paratrooper Corp changed to the Comando de Tropas Aerotransportas (Airborne Troops Command) and all three Paratrooper Battalions changed to Airborne Infantry Battalions (BIAT). This new Army Airborne Brigade was bigger and more powerful due to the previous Air Force Light Paratrooper Brigade; they had replaced heavy mortars with 105 mm artillery guns and were equipped with light armor vehicles. In territorial terms the BOTP1 was closed and BOTP2 changed its name to the S√£o Jacinto Military Area. The units of the brigade that were not at Tancos (Airborne Support Battalion) or S√£o Jacinto (2nd BIAT) were now garrisoned at Army barracks (Regiments) like the 15th Infantry Regiment at Tomar (1st BIAT), 3rd Infantry Regiment at Beja (3rd BIAT), 4th Artillery Regiment at Leiria (Grupo de Artilharia Aerotransportada ‚Äì Airborne Artillery Group), 3rd Cavalry Regiment at Estremoz (Esquadr√£o de Reconhecimento Aerotransportado ‚Äì Airborne Recon Squadron) and others. The BAI structure was: * 15th Infantry Regiment: 1st BIAT, Services and Support Battalion * S√£o Jacinto Military Area: 2nd BIAT, Anti-Tank Company * 3rd Infantry Regiment: 3rd BIAT * 4th Artillery Regiment: Field Artillery Group * ETAT: Aeroterrestrial Support Battalion * Tancos Airfield: Signals Company * Engineering Practical School: Engineering Company * 3rd Cavalry Regiment: Recon Squadron * 1st Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment: Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battery Elite Forces Brigade The next reorganization of the Army though, changed the ETAT designation again to ETP ‚Äì Escola de Tropas P√°raquedistas (School of Parachute Troops) with the BAI being renamed and reorganized as BRR ‚Äì Brigada de Reac√ß√£o R√°pida . The Airborne Troops Command was disbanded. Currently, airborne forces are under direct control of regular army commands, such as Land Forces Operational Command (operational units) or the Instruction Command (ETP ‚Äì Paratrooper School). After the last reorganization of the Army, ETP changed its name to Regimento de Paraquedistas (Paratroopers' Regiment). The Elite Forces brigade is no longer a full deployable brigade, but rather an organizational structure that controls all the special trained army units. The 3rd Airborne Infantry Battalion and Anti-Tank Company were disbanded and the other two BIAT were renamed Paratrooper Infantry Battalions (BIParas), the S√£o Jacinto Military Area was renamed 10th Infantry Regiment, the Airborne Artillery Group and the Services and Support Battalion were transferred to the Intervention Brigade and their no longer Airborne capable and the Engineering Company and the Anti- Aircraft Artillery Battery were reduced to platoon size. This new Rapid Reaction Brigade joined all remaining Paratrooper units together with Army Special Operations and the reborn battalion-size Army Comandos unit. Finally a newly formed unit has joined BRR: UALE (Army Light Aviation Unit), which is waiting to be equipped with NH-90 TTH and a still-to-be-chosen light utility helicopter, possibly the Eurocopter EC-135 or the AgustaWestland AW109.

Carpentier says that this was the highlight of his career. In the months following the Apollo 11 mission, Carpentier became known as a world famous physician. He later went into nuclear medicine research. Carpentier is a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, with which he was decorated for his role in the Apollo 13 mission. Early life and education William Carpentier was born in Edmonton, Alberta and raised in Lake Cowichan, British Columbia. His mother was Canadian and his father was a Rhode Islander who had to forfeit his United States citizenship during World War II due to his enlistment in the Canadian Army. Carpentier attended Lake Cowichan Secondary School and went on to study at Victoria College. In 1961 he graduated from the University of British Columbia School of Medicine. According to Carpentier, the achievements of Alan Shepard and Yuri Gagarin piqued his interest in space exploration and, after medical school, he moved to Ohio to pursue additional studies in aviation medicine at Ohio State University. Career Carpentier was selected as a flight surgeon trainee by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in January 1965 and made a staff flight surgeon the following July. According to Carpentier, he attempted to apply for appointment to the Astronaut Corps, however, found that as a Canadian he was ineligible to do so. Though he considered renouncing his citizenship, he chose not to after learning the process for naturalization as an American would take several years. William Carpentier (pictured inside helicopter) follows Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin as they arrive on the flight deck of USS Hornet following recovery from the Apollo 11 command module Columbia. He ultimately served as a medical staff member assigned to several Gemini missions and Apollo missions, including as flight surgeon for Apollo 11 and Apollo 13. During the recovery of Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Buzz Aldrin from the Pacific Ocean, Carpentier was assigned to Helicopter 66, the primary rescue helicopter which ferried the men to the waiting . Both Carpentier and NASA engineer John Hirasaki ‚Äì who had come into contact with Moon dust ‚Äì were confined with the astronauts for their 21-day quarantine. In the period following their release from isolation, the publicity demands on Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin became so great that Carpentier was sometimes pressed into service to make public appearances in their place after a United States Department of State publicist concluded that the physician \\"was famous enough\\". During travel on Air Force One he would be registered by crew into the flight manifest under the initials \\"WFP\\" for \\"world famous physician\\", a moniker that would stay with him for life. In 1973, after completing a fellowship in nuclear medicine at Baylor University, Carpentier entered the private sector as a researcher at Texas' Scott & White Healthcare, spending thirty years there before retiring in 2003. Following retirement, Carpentier returned to NASA as a consultant studying the cardiovascular systems of astronauts. In 2012, Carpentier returned to the former U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS Hornet ‚Äì where he had been quarantined with Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin 43 years before ‚Äì to participate in a memorial service for the recently deceased Armstrong. Personal life Carpentier is married. As of 2013 he was living in Belton, Texas. Legacy Carpentier was decorated with the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his work on Apollo 13 and, in 2013, received the University of British Columbia Alumni Award of Distinction.

He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1932, and after serving two terms was elected to the Senate in 1937. In total, he served for 46 years in the two chambers of the Texas Legislature, making him the longest-tenured legislator in the history of Texas at the time of his retirement in January 1979. Aikin earned a reputation as a staunch supporter of education, and was given the honorific \\"the father of modern Texas education\\". He served on the Senate Finance Committee from 1937 to 1979; he was also the chair of the committee from 1967 until 1979. In 1943, Aikin also served as president pro tempore of the Senate and, in the absence of Governor Coke R. Stevenson and the Lieutenant Governor, as acting governor for 14 days. The A. M. and Welma Aikin Regional Archives and the A. M. Aikin Symposium at Paris Junior College (PJC), as well as two chairs at the University of Texas at Austin, have been named in his honor.  Early life  Alexander Mack Aikin Jr. was born on October 9, 1905, in Aikin Grove, Red River County, Texas. His family moved to Lamar County in 1907, and Aikin attended grade school in Milton and high school in Deport. He then attended Paris Junior College (PJC) in Paris and Cumberland University in Lebanon, Tennessee, the latter of which he graduated from with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1932.  Political career  A member of the Democratic Party, Aikin's political career began in 1932 with his election to the Texas House of Representatives. In 1937, after serving two terms in the House of Representatives, he was elected to the Texas Senate. From 1948 onwards, he did not face an opponent in any election that he contested. In total, he served for 46 years in the two chambers of the Texas Legislature, making him the longest-tenured legislator in the history of Texas at the time of his retirement in January 1979. During his entire political career, he missed only two and a half days that the legislature was in session. Aikin earned a reputation as a staunch supporter of education, and according to Daisy Harvill \\"he supported every major educational bill passed by the legislature\\" and was given the honorific \\"the father of modern Texas education\\". Among his most significant legislative achievements were his sponsorship of the 1933 bill that established the Teacher Retirement System, which became a constitutional amendment in 1937; his cosponsoring of the 1949 Gilmer-Aikin Laws (with Representative Claud Gilmer of Rocksprings), which established a centralized, statewide education system along with the Minimum Foundation school program that guaranteed funding levels for public schools and minimum teachers' salaries procured by the state; and his sponsorship of a 1956 amendment to set $100 a month as the minimum retirement compensation for teachers in an effort to attract better talent to the profession. Aikin was also an advocate for all-weather farm roads, largely because of the increased accessibility that they provided to schools, as well as the M. D. Anderson Hospital, the principal cancer treatment center in Texas. Aikin served on the Senate Finance Committee, which is charged with handling state budget and tax bills, from his election to the Texas Senate in 1937 to his retirement in 1979; he was also the chair of the committee from 1967 until 1979. In 1943, he served as president pro tempore of the Senate and, in the absence of Governor Coke R. Stevenson and the Lieutenant Governor, as acting governor for 14 days. During his brief tenure as acting governor, Aikin briefly declared martial law in Beaumont due to a race riot; he did so at the request of local officials and with the approval of Governor Stevenson. Aikin became dean of the Senate in 1963, and dean emeritus upon his retirement in 1979.  Personal life  Outside of his political career, Aikin worked as the senior partner in both the law firm Aikin & Townsend and Aikin's Men's Wear haberdashery, both in Paris. In 1929, he married Welma Morphew, a landscape beautification advocate and future PJC regent with whom he had one son. Aikin died on October 24, 1981, at St. Joseph's Hospital in Paris, at the age of 76; he had been hospitalized since September 6. His funeral was held at First United Methodist Church in Paris on October 26, where he was eulogized by United States Senator Jack English Hightower of Vernon and former State Senator A. R. \\"Babe\\" Schwartz of Galveston. He was also memorialized on October 29 with a brief service in the Texas Senate in which he was eulogized by Lieutenant Governor William P. Hobby Jr. and once again by State Senator Schwartz.  Legacy  Aikin was honored with the proclamation of \\"A. M. Aikin Day\\" in 1973, during which his portrait was hung in the Texas Senate chamber, \\"a rare honor for a lawmaker who was still serving\\". Aikin was further honored with the establishment of the A. M. and Welma Aikin Regional Archives at PJC's Mike Rheudasil Learning Center in 1978. It serves as a repository for his personal papers in addition to showcasing a gallery exhibit and a replica of his Texas Senate office, as well as a reading room for researchers. The Aikin Regional Archives additionally contains local and regional history collections, including manuscripts, maps, newspapers, photographs, and other documents, as well as local government records from Delta, Fannin, Lamar, and Red River counties due to its status as a regional depository for the Texas State Library and Archives Commission. In 1979, the A. M. Aikin Symposium was established at PJC as a two-day seminar for high school students addressing \\"fiscal responsibility in government\\". Furthermore, the A. M. Aikin Regents Chair in Junior and Community College Education and the A. M. Aikin Regents Chair in Education Leadership were established in 1985 at the University of Texas at Austin. The total endowment of the two chairs was $1 million; former PJC president Louis B. Williams led the fundraising effort for the endowment, while the total gift of $500,000 was matched with funds from the Permanent University Fund to establish the memorial chairs.

History  On 18 July 1912 Enescu completed an Allegro movement for a piano sonata in F-sharp minor, which he played to Herbert Peyser later that summer in connection with an interview. In a heavily reworked form, this would become the first movement of the Sonata, Op. 24, No. 1. However, Enescu set aside this project for twelve years, resuming work again only in 1924. The early version of this movement was only rediscovered in 1993, by the musicologist Clemansa Liliana Firca . Enescu took up the sonata again in July 1924 in Te»õcani, completely rewriting the first movement and adding the other two, completing the work in Sinaia on 27 August 1924 . The score was written for and is dedicated to the Swiss pianist Emil Frey , who had been court pianist in Bucharest from 1907 until the outbreak of World War I. In an interview given shortly after completing the score, Enescu admitted, The first performance was given in November 1925 by the composer himself, in a concert that was part of a festival dedicated to his chamber-music works, organized by the Society of Romanian Composers at the Mic Theater in Bucharest. He also performed the work in Paris for the first time in April 1926, as part of a concert given by the Soci√©t√© Nationale de Musique .  Analysis  The Sonata is in three movements, whose moderate‚Äìfast‚Äìslow pattern resembles that of Enescu's Third Symphony . * Allegro molto moderato e grave * Presto vivace * Andante molto espressivo The first movement is in an extremely free sonata form (though the composer himself declined to characterize it this way). There are two major deviations from the usual sonata design. First, the development begins in the home key of F-sharp minor, while the recapitulation begins in the most distant possible key of C minor, a tritone away from the overall tonic. Second, the sense of arrival of the recapitulation is divided in two by this fact, in that the return of the main theme is separated from the reappearance of its home tonality. The coda of the movement takes on the character of a passacaglia, a feature first noted by the composer Anatol Vieru . The second movement opens with a gradual accumulation of voices, at first suggesting a fugal exposition with a first answer at the interval of a tritone, but lacking a countersubject. Its burlesque-scherzando character, contrasting with the dark quality of the first movement, resembles those toccatas revived in the music of Debussy and Ravel, or the neoclassical, motoric style adopted in the early twentieth century by composers like Prokofiev. Some other passages resemble the diatonicism of Stravinsky‚Äôs Piano Sonata, which was composed slightly later, in the summer and autumn of 1924 . The movement does not adhere to any conventional formal scheme and is built economically from a very small number of elements. Although the second theme returns several times, suggesting a rondo form, the recurrences are subject to variations. The most striking of these variants is in a limping 5/4 meter, reminiscent of folk dances such as the »ôoc√¢cili from Banat, the ghimpele, and »ôobolanul from Oltenia and Muntenia, and the hodoroaga from the Ardeal and Moldova regions . Myriam Marbe finds that this movement‚Äôs spontaneity and exuberant character suggests, through its pulsating motion, a surging crowd at a public celebration, in a stylized manner similar to the one Stravinsky creates in Petrushka In an interview with Bernard Gavoty broadcast by the French Radio on 25 January 1952, Enescu played part of the finale of this First Piano Sonata as an example of a musical transposition of the atmosphere of the Romanian Plain at night (, cited in , , and in ). The movement begins evocatively with a single repeated note in an irregular rhythm, whose gentle accents eventually produce the distant signal of a rising minor third, from which the first motif gradually emerges. Hesitant motivic statements separated by long pauses produce a characteristic \\"spatial poetry\\" for this movement, which is one of the most striking features of the Enescian style . As with the second movement, the form of the finale is difficult to assign to a conventional model. It may be interpreted as a ternary form , or else as a modified sonata-allegro .

The icon measures about 57x57cm (22 7/16 x 22 7/16 in) and is 2 cm thick. The icon has been damaged over the years with some of the pigment missing and it has two vertical cracks running through the image, but it can still be readily made out.  Description  Dated to the 8th century, the icon depicts Christ with his cruciform halo behind him and standing next to Abbot Saint Menas (from the fixt century, not to be confused with Saint Menas the martyr of the early fourth centuryAD) who is also depicted with a halo indicating his sainthood. We know that the icon is of Jesus Christ and the abbot because there is writing above each of their heads stating \\"Œ®ŒüŒ§ŒïŒ° (Savior)\\" and \\"ŒëŒ†Œë ŒúŒóŒùŒë Œ†Œ°ŒüŒïŒôCŒ§ŒüC (Father Mena, guardian)\\" when translated.

The two are side-by-side with the abbot being slightly smaller when compared, clutching a scroll in one hand with the other hand gesturing in a blessing motion. Christ, with his arm around the abbot is giving a sort of \\"introduction to the people\\" as he takes his place with the angels. Both are shown wearing a tunic and pallium, though of different colors. (Christ in purple with blue highlight and Mena in brown.) Christ has a small round beard, mustache and long wavy hair and Mena is grey-haired and bearded. The noticeably large eyes are intended to be over-exaggerated in the composition. The color gradients where the background has green and brown hills that blend into an apricot-hued sky are clearly 6th century design, indicative of the coptic, the largest Christian group in the region.Meinardus, Otto F.

Our father Abraham, the Bishop, Bode Museum, Berlin  Monastery of Bawit  When the monastery of Bawit was excavated, along with this icon of Christ many other works were discovered. Whole rooms covered in icons of saints were found and one icon Our father Abraham, the Bishop was also removed from the monastery. Because the idea of sainthood was in transition, many works were created to resemble those that would indicate the image is of a saint; this was to insure if the person was later to be acknowledged as a saint, then there would be no need to retouch the portrait. The monastery, which is located on the west bank of the River Nile, was excavated in the twentieth century by a team from the Institute Francais d'Archeologie Orientale, which was led by Jean Cledet and Jean Maspero.Gabra, Gawdat, and Hany N.

He is known for preserved copies of his Articles (pirate code) and black flag. History Born in 1704, Dulaien received a respectable education in France and was a licensed ship's pilot. By 1727 he was aboard a privateer ship in the Caribbean, cruising against the English with a mixed Spanish and French crew. The French crewmen mutinied, massacring the Spaniards and electing Dulaien as captain. They renamed the ship Sans Pitie (Merciless). The crew agreed to a shared set of Articles for governing behavior aboard ship. Like other pirate codes, there were provisions for punishing sailors who deserted, hid loot, argued, or were derelict in their duties. They also allowed for compensation for injured sailors, and appointed a lieutenant to monitor cargo aboard captured ships. Dulaien's Articles forbade killing prisoners, except notably, the Spanish. Unlike most pirate articles, Dulaien's specified when they would give quarter: if a ship resisted after seeing their black flag, they would raise a red flag, and if the victim fired at least three cannon shots afterwards, the pirates would spare no one. Dulaien hid his 60-ton, 14-gun ship among the tall trees on the shores of West Caicos. They quickly captured over a dozen ships ‚Äì some of them French ‚Äì and kept the best for their flotilla, keeping others for careening the Sans Pitie. Dulaien appointed an associate named Garnier to command his consort ship, renamed Sans Quartier (No Quarter). Within a year they decided to divide their plunder and return to France to seek a pardon. Dropping off most of his crew on Tortuga, he prepared to leave for Nantes. Reportedly Dulaien said to the surprised crew of the Sans Quartier as he sailed away with most of their treasure, ‚ÄúGoodbye! Farewell, scoundrels! I go to France and I am no longer a pirate.‚Äù Before accepting the pardon, Dulaien and his crew sold their looted goods and hid their treasure, leaving some with friends and relatives. French officials had offered a pardon on the condition that Dulaien turn over any stolen goods. They suspected there was far more than the little plunder they found on the Sans Pitie, and convinced local priests to threaten excommunication for citizens who aided the pirates. The threat worked, and after they discovered the hidden treasure, they arrested Dulaien and the crew. The Sans Pitie was in poor condition and was sold off to help pay merchants whose cargo Dulaien had looted. After appeals to the King the crew were released. Dulaien was left in jail for some time longer, though his ultimate fate is not known. Jolly Roger pirate flag of Jean Thomas Dulaien (alternate design), per Ed Fox. Jolly Roger Dulaien's pirate flag was described by the mayor of Nantes as ‚Äúblack cloth, with white designs of human figures, cutlasses, bones, and hourglasses.‚Äù A woodblock purportedly made from a drawing of the flag has survived, as have other independent drawings of Dulaien's flag. The original flag itself was preserved for some years, possibly later destroyed on orders from King Louis XV. His flag is often confused with that of Walter Kennedy, which was described in similar terms. Because the original flag is missing and the extant drawings do not entirely agree, the actual flag's design is not known with certainty.

The film and its title character were produced to rival the success of Toho's Godzilla films during the mid-60s. Overview Name and copyright The name \\"Yonggary\\" is a combination of two Korean words: \\"Yong\\" (meaning dragon) and \\"gari\\" (derived from Bulgasari). The rights to the character are currently owned by Younggu Art, founded by Korean filmmaker Shim Hyung-rae, director of Yonggary (1999). Development =1967 Yonggary= The 1967 Yonggary was originally conceived as a single- celled organism from space that mutated into a giant monster after exposure from radiation during a nuclear bomb test. The 1967 Yonggary was brought to life using a man in a rubber suit. Masao Yagi, who built the Gamera suit for Daiei, supervised the construction of the Yonggary suit. The character was designed in Korea, while the suit was built in Japan based on the Korean design. Director Kim Ki-duk found that the suit lacked terror and was disappointed with the final results but proceeded to film with the suit since there was no time or money to produce a new suit. The suit ended up costing ‚Ç©1.2 million ($5,000 in USD) to produce. Cho Kyoung-min portrayed Yonggary, who was paid ‚Ç©100,000 ($400 in USD). The film and its title character were produced to rival the success of Toho's Godzilla and the film was released in Germany as Godzilla's Todespranke (Godzilla's Hand of Death). The 1967 Yonggary has a bipedal reptilian design with a long horn on his snout, tusks at the side of his mouth, a single row of dorsal fins, and spikes on the side of his tail. The 1967 Yonggary is capable of breathing fire and his primary food source is oil and gasoline.Yongary, Monster from the Deep (1967). Directed by Kim Ki-duk. Keukdong Entertainment =1999 Yonggary= In the opening credits of the 2001 upgrade edition of Yonggary, Shim Hyung-rae (the film's director) is credited as the creator of the 1999 incarnation of Yonggary.Yonggary: 2001 Upgrade Edition (2001). Directed by Shim Hyung-rae. Zero Nine Entertainment Miniatures and suits for Yonggary and Cyker were produced, but the suits were later replaced with Computer-generated imagery during post-production, thus the 1999 Yonggary is made nearly entirely out of CG effects. For the film's CG effects, the animators used a technique called the \\"pipeline method\\", Park Chang-yong (Younggu Art's Chief of 3D Animation) described it as \\"A continuous process. It strives for large synergy effects by enhancing efficiency at all stages from 3D computer graphic modeling to rendering.\\" The film ended up utilizing 45 minutes of computer graphics. The 1999 Yonggary has a drastically different design from the original 1967 incarnation. The 1999 incarnation sports three horns on his head and the horn on his snout has been decreased to a smaller size. The 1999 Yonggary is capable of breathing fire (referred to as \\"fireballs\\" in the film) and has a diamond-shaped receptor on his forehead that allow the aliens to control him. Under the aliens' control, Yonggary is shown to be aggressive and violent, but when the military breaks the aliens' control over Yonggary, he is shown to be gentle, even protective. While the 1967 Yonggary died, the 1999 incarnation is shown to live and is transported by the military to a deserted island to live in peace. Merchandise In 2008, graphic designer Hong Gi-hun (founder of South Korea's \\"Big Monster Club\\") created \\"semi-official\\" toys based on Korean monsters, such as the 1967 Yonggary, Pulgasari, and Wangmagwi. Though semi- official, Shim Hyung-rae still gave his blessing for the Yonggary toy and two sets of the toys were presented by film director Kim Ki-duk, director of the original Yongary, Monster from the Deep (1967).

The book also discusses problems using large snow gauges made from bamboo situated in mountain passes and uplands which are speculated to be first referenced to snow measurement. Tianchi basins were installed at provincial and district capitals and bamboo snow gauges were situated in mountain passes. The rain gauges were bowl-shaped with one being installed at each provincial and district capital in China. In the treatise, Qin Jiushao also discusses how point measurements were converted to real averages. These averages were important as they postulated indicators of natural disasters such as flooding, since river flooding has always been a problem in China.

On September 27, 2017, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced the arrest of 10 individuals, including assistant coaches Anthony Bland, Chuck Person, Emanuel Richardson, and Lamont Evans and Adidas executive James Gatto, on various corruption and fraud charges including bribery, money laundering, and wire fraud. The schools implicated in the initial announcement were Arizona, Auburn, Louisville, Miami, Oklahoma State, South Carolina, and Southern California (USC). Emanueal Richardson had a six figure salary. However, he was going broke due to him allegedly paying players out of pocket. The investigation has since spread beyond the individuals and teams initially implicated. Shortly afterwards, multiple media reports indicated that the Elite Youth Basketball League, the grassroots basketball division of Nike, was served with a subpoena by federal investigators. While Nike was not named in the initial documents, one of the 10 individuals arrested on September 26 was a former Nike executive who was working for Adidas when he was arrested. On February 23, 2018, Yahoo! Sports published a report, based on \\"hundreds of pages of documents\\" obtained by the FBI from two agents and an agency implicated in the investigation, that named more than a dozen additional schools and over 25 current and former players as having been potentially implicated in the scandal. Still later, on April 10, Southern District prosecutors added extra criminal counts to the indictment of Gatto, with the added counts specifically naming Kansas and North Carolina State as well as Louisville and Miami.  Background  The discovery of corruption in basketball stemmed from an investigation of Pittsburgh-based financial planner Marty Blazer by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In 2016, the SEC charged Blazer with wire fraud and accused him of embezzling over $2 million from several professional athletes to invest in movie projects and finance Ponzi schemes. As part of a plea agreement with the Southern District U.S. Attorney's office, he agreed to become an FBI informant, and would later plead guilty to reduced charges. He has since stated that there were also payments made to players in efforts to attend the Penn State football program.  Programs affected   First wave  = Arizona = Emanuel \\"Book\\" Richardson, an Arizona assistant since 2009, was among the individuals arrested and indicted in 2017. He was alleged to have met with agent Christian Dawkins and others in June 2017, agreeing to accept a $5,000 bribe to steer Arizona players to Dawkins' sports management company, and was also charged with accepting an additional $15,000 in bribes and paying at least one recruit to commit to the university. Richardson was suspended on September 26, the day after his arrest, and formally fired on January 23, 2018. Arizona lost one of its three-member 2018 recruiting class in the wake of the initial allegations. Five-star point guard Jahvon Quinerly reopened his recruitment in October, and eventually signed with Villanova. Nassir Little, also a five-star recruit, cited the investigation as his reason for deciding against attending Arizona. On a wiretap that was played during the trial Merl Code claims that Arizona offered $150,000 for Little. = Auburn = Chuck Person, a former Auburn basketball star who went on to a long National Basketball Association career before going into coaching, was alleged by the FBI to have received over $90,000 in bribes from Rashan Michel, a former NBA and Southeastern Conference referee who ran a custom tailoring shop in Atlanta that had many professional athletes as clients. Person was accused of paying nearly $20,000 to the families of two active Auburn players. Auburn suspended Person without pay shortly after his arrest. Person was indicted by a federal grand jury and subsequently fired by Auburn on November 7, 2017. In the wake of the indictments, the university retained an outside law firm to launch an internal investigation into the program. Before Auburn's exhibition game on November 2, 2017, the school announced that it would hold players Austin Wiley and Danjel Purifoy out of games indefinitely due to eligibility concerns raised over the FBI investigation. They would both be held out of action throughout the rest of the season, though they returned to play after the conclusion of that season. On November 8, ESPN reported that head coach Bruce Pearl refused to cooperate with the school's internal investigation, and that university officials notified him that the refusal could lead to his firing. The university had been unable to determine whether Pearl had been involved in any violations of law or NCAA rules because the FBI had seized his computers and cell phones as part of its investigation. On the same day that the initial arrests were announced, E. J. Montgomery, a highly touted forward in the 2018 recruiting class who had verbally committed to Auburn in September 2016, announced he would reopen his recruitment. Montgomery ultimately committed to Kentucky in April 2018. = Louisville = Louisville was not named directly in the court documents, but the documents mentioned a \\"University-6\\" that was \\"a public research university located in Kentucky\\" with \\"approximately 22,640 students and over 7,000 faculty and staff members\\", and fielding \\"approximately 21 varsity sports teams in NCAA Division I competition.\\" The state has only two public research universities‚Äîthe University of Kentucky and the University of Louisville‚Äîand the details cited in the documents match only Louisville. Gregory Postel, Louisville's interim president, confirmed hours after the FBI announcements that the school was indeed \\"University-6\\". At the time of the announcement, the Louisville men's basketball program was facing major NCAA sanctions stemming from an earlier sex scandal, which included vacating the 2013 national championship. The NCAA upheld those sanctions on February 20, 2018. The documents also alluded to two Louisville coaches, identified only as \\"Coach-1\\" and \\"Coach-2\\", and a recruit who signed with Louisville identified as \\"Player-10\\". The documents allege that the coaches were involved in a scheme by which a \\"Company-1\\", later identified as Adidas, would funnel $100,000 to the family of \\"Player-10\\" in exchange for him coming to Louisville. About a month before the scandal broke, Louisville, which has been Adidas' flagship college athletic program since 2016, signed a 10-year, $160 million extension to its then-current apparel contract with the company. The documents indicate that Brad Augustine, a youth basketball coach in Florida who was among the individuals arrested, said the following about \\"Coach-2\\": > No one swings a bigger dick than Coach-2 at Company-1. . . . All [Coach-2] > has to do is pick up the phone and call somebody [and say], 'These are my > guys.' [And then] they're taking care of us. The day after the complaints were unsealed, CBS News, followed by many other media outlets, reported that \\"Coach-2\\" was Louisville head coach Rick Pitino. Shortly thereafter, media outlets identified \\"Player-10\\" as Brian Bowen, a top recruit who had unexpectedly signed with Louisville on June 3, 2017. Bowen is currently playing for the Indiana Pacers on a two-way contract. As a result of the scandal, on September 27, 2017, Louisville placed Pitino on unpaid administrative leave and athletic director Tom Jurich on paid administrative leave. Bowen was suspended from the team and withheld from all team activities. In addition, two five-star high school recruits who had verbally committed to join the Louisville program in 2018‚Äì19, Anfernee Simons and Courtney Ramey, rescinded their commitments and reopened their recruitment. Simons would try his luck with entering the 2018 NBA Draft as a high school postgraduate. The Cardinals lost a third recruit on October 4 when David Johnson, a guard from the local Trinity High School who was rated as a top-50 prospect in the recruiting class of 2019 and had verbally committed to Louisville, rescinded his commitment (Johnson would re-commit to Louisville a year later). Two other five-star prospects for 2018 who had placed Louisville within their final choices, Moses Brown and Romeo Langford removed the Cardinals from their lists in the wake of the scandal. On October 6 the University of Louisville placed associate head coach Kenny Johnson and assistant coach Jordan Fair on paid administrative leave, and Fair would be fired by Louisville on October 11. The Louisville athletics board officially voted to fire Pitino on October 16. Two days later, the university's board of trustees voted 10‚Äì3 to fire Jurich with cause. On November 8, the Southern District unsealed a new set of indictments against eight of the 10 individuals initially charged. On the same day, NBC News reported that these new documents directly linked Pitino to the alleged scheme to pay Bowen's family. The documents allege that Pitino met in July 2017 with Christian Dawkins, an agent who was formally indicted in both September and November. During that meeting, Dawkins was said to have asked Pitino to call Gatto and request the $100,000 payment to Bowen's family, and Pitino reportedly agreed to make the call to Gatto. The FBI revealed that phone records indicated that Pitino called Gatto three times before Bowen committed to Louisville. The April 2018 indictments specifically charge Dawkins and Adidas consultant Merl Code with conspiring with Gatto to commit wire fraud and pay the aforementioned $100,000 to Bowen's family. On May 18, 2018 the board of trustees agreed to a $4.5 million settlement with Jurich that cleared him of any wrong doing and phrased his termination as \\"retirement\\". = Miami = Like Louisville, the University of Miami was not directly identified in the court documents, but UM president Julio Frenk confirmed on September 27 that the school was the institution described in said documents as \\"University-7\\". The confirmation came the day after the attorney for UM head coach Jim Larra√±aga said that the coach was unaware of any impropriety in the program. The documents allege that a UM coach identified only as \\"Coach-3\\" requested that Gatto arrange a $150,000 payment from Adidas to the family of a top high school player identified as \\"Player-12\\" in an attempt to keep him from signing with a \\"University-4\\" that was sponsored by a rival apparel company. This alleged $150,000 payment was also included in the April 2018 indictments. = Oklahoma State and South Carolina = Lamont Evans, at the time an assistant at Oklahoma State, was one of the four coaches arrested on September 26. He was accused of taking at least $22,000 in bribes from two financial advisors, one of whom was acting as an FBI informant. The alleged bribes were offered over a five-year period that included Evans' former tenure as an assistant at South Carolina. Oklahoma State fired Evans on September 28. Oklahoma State lost one potential recruit due to the scandal. On the same day Evans was fired, Antwann Jones, a guard ranked by ESPN as one of the top 50 players in the recruiting class of 2018, rescinded a verbal commitment he had made to the program less than two weeks earlier. Evans was sentenced to three months in prison in June 2019 for his participation in the scheme, which he also conducted at the University of South Carolina. In June 2020, a press release by the NCAA announced that the men‚Äôs basketball team will be prohibited from participating in 2020-21 postseason competition and the university will self-impose a fine of $10,000 plus 1 percent of the men‚Äôs basketball program‚Äôs budget. = Alabama = In the aftermath of the announcement of the FBI investigation, Alabama director of basketball operations Kobie Baker resigned following an internal investigation into the program. This resignation came after the school uncovered that Baker had accepted bribes to steer one of Alabama's incoming freshman players toward financial advisor Rashan Michel. Baker allegedly accepted a $5,000 payment for arranging a meeting between Michel and the father of the player, and an additional $10,000 for helping to steer the player toward Michel. Before Alabama's exhibition game on November 6, 2017, the school announced that freshman point guard Collin Sexton would not play that game nor the first regular season game against Memphis due to eligibility concerns. Sexton would later be cleared to play for Alabama starting with their November 14 game against Lipscomb. = USC = On September 26, federal prosecutors in New York announced charges of fraud and corruption against USC assistant coach Tony Bland. The charges allege that Bland and others allegedly received benefits from financial advisers and others to influence student-athletes to retain their services. Following the announcement, USC placed Bland on administrative leave and announced that it would conduct an internal investigation of the matter. After playing in only a few games in the 2017‚Äì18 season, on January 15, 2018, sophomore point guard De'Anthony Melton was indefinitely suspended as a result of the investigation. Melton would later remove himself from the university on February 21, 2018, in order to enter the 2018 NBA Draft and begin training for it early, where he was selected 46th by the Houston Rockets and was later traded to the Phoenix Suns on August 31 before the upcoming NBA season began. On Friday, December 13, 2019, USC received a notice of allegations from the NCAA in regards to the violations stemming from this investigation into the USC basketball department.  Second wave  = Arizona = On February 23, 2018, FBI wiretaps reportedly showed that head coach Sean Miller had discussed with Dawkins about paying Deandre Ayton $100,000 to facilitate Ayton's commitment to the University of Arizona, with the monetary situation being dealt with directly to him. Based on 247Sports which follows high school players and their recruitment, they had predicted 99% that Ayton would be attending University of Kansas the night of his commitment. If he were implicated in this case, it would have potentially hurt Ayton's chances of finishing out the rest of his season with Arizona, as well as result in him entering the 2018 NBA draft earlier than anticipated, similar to that of De'Anthony Melton. The following day, Miller notified the team that he would not coach in that night's game against Oregon, with associate coach Lorenzo Romar coaching the team instead and Ayton being allowed to play for Arizona that game. However, Ayton and his family have maintained they did not earn any monetary benefits to attend Arizona, with further information suggesting that Miller's calls to Dawkins were related to the recruitment of another player instead. This ultimately led to Ayton being cleared to finish out the season with Arizona. On March 1, Miller made his first public comments since the reporting on the wiretaps, in which he unequivocally denied any involvement in payments to players. ESPN reported that Miller would coach the team that night against Stanford, with Miller confirmed to remain the coach for Arizona throughout the rest of this season, as well as a bit further beyond that. Arizona, which had already lost one of its three-member 2018 recruiting class after the initial allegations, initially lost its remaining two 2018 recruits after the new revelations. Power forward Shareef O'Neal, son of Hall of Fame player Shaquille O'Neal and rated as a top-30 prospect, announced on February 24 that he was rescinding a commitment he had made in April 2017 to play at Arizona. Because the younger O'Neal signed a nonbinding financial aid agreement instead of a formal letter of intent, he did not need a release from Arizona to choose a new destination, and he would commit to UCLA three days later. Arizona's only remaining recruit at the time in the 2018 class, point guard Brandon Williams, also did not sign a letter of intent, giving him the option to reopen his recruitment, and he chose to do so on March 2. However, unlike Shareef O'Neal, Williams decided to recommit to Arizona on May 5, 2018. = NC State = According to the documents viewed by Yahoo! Sports, former NC State and current NBA player Dennis Smith Jr. had received $43,500 from ASM Sports, an agency run by reported cooperating government witness Andy Miller, before enrolling at the school. Another document said that Smith had received over $70,000 in loans, with the document also including notes about \\"how to recoup the money\\" after Smith chose not to sign with ASM Sports. The April 2018 indictments specifically charge that Gatto was involved in a scheme to funnel $40,000 to Smith's family in October 2015 in exchange for signing with NC State. Adidas had a well-established relationship with both Smith and NC State, as Smith was playing for an Adidas-sponsored AAU team at the time, and NC State was then (as now) an Adidas-backed program. The indictment also claimed that an NC State coach identified only as \\"Coach-4\\" was the conduit for this payment. Smith would sign a financial aid agreement with the school in December of that year. = Seton Hall = The ASM documents also claim that current NBA player Isaiah Whitehead received at least $26,000 from ASM while at Seton Hall. He signed with ASM after leaving for the 2016 NBA draft, but later moved to Roc Nation. = LSU = Former LSU player Tim Quarterman allegedly received at least $16,000 from ASM while at the school. = Maryland = Diamond Stone, who played at Maryland in the 2015‚Äì16 season, allegedly received over $14,000 from ASM. The school launched an internal investigation into possible ties with the scandal, with head coach Mark Turgeon denying that he or any of his staff members had any involvement with the agency. The April 2018 indictments peripherally linked Maryland and its current apparel provider, Under Armour, to the scandal in a completely separate context, although neither was explicitly named in those documents. The FBI alleged that Gatto and a co-conspirator identified in the documents as \\"CC-3\\" agreed to make payments to the guardian of a 2017 recruit who was identified by media as Silvio De Sousa. According to the documents, the guardian told \\"CC-3\\" that he had received illicit payments from individuals connected with Under Armour in exchange for De Sousa's commitment to Maryland. The guardian also indicated that De Sousa preferred to go to Kansas, but that he would need to repay the illicit payments to facilitate the player's wishes. Gatto and \\"CC-3\\" then allegedly paid the guardian $20,000. De Sousa, who had been considered by most recruiting experts as a virtual lock to attend Maryland, committed to Kansas on August 30, 2017. It should also be noted that shortly after the 2018 indictments were unsealed, De Sousa's guardian denied accepting any illicit payments. = Kentucky = A spreadsheet in the documents viewed by Yahoo! Sports listed a $12,000 payment to a prospect identified as \\"BAM\\". A later note in the document identifies this individual as Bam Adebayo, who played only one season at Kentucky in 2016‚Äì17. Other documents claim that Adebayo received $36,500 in loans. Additionally, then- current Wildcats player Kevin Knox was listed among several players who had met or dined with Dawkins, or whose families had done so. = Washington = Markelle Fultz, who played a season at Washington before leaving to become the top pick in the 2017 NBA draft, allegedly received $10,000 from ASM. = USC = Melton would ultimately not be the only USC player implicated. The ASM documents claim that two other current USC players, or individuals closely associated with them, had received payments from the company. = Utah = Kyle Kuzma, a 2017 first-round NBA draft pick, was listed in the ASM documents as having received $9,500 from the agency while at Utah. = Xavier = Former Xavier star Edmond Sumner and his father reportedly received at least $7,000 in advances from ASM during the younger Sumner's college career. = South Carolina = After being withheld from play by Louisville amid questions regarding his eligibility stemming from the original revelations, Brian Bowen withdrew from the school and eventually enrolled at South Carolina, though he would not be eligible to play for the Gamecocks' basketball program until January 2019. However, the ASM documents raise more questions about his NCAA eligibility, allegedly listing at least $7,000 in benefits to him and his family during his high school career. That would result in him later rescinding his collegiate entry altogether, instead opting to begin a professional basketball career early, starting with the Sydney Kings in Australia. In addition, P. J. Dozier, a star on South Carolina's 2017 Final Four team, was alleged to have received over $6,000 while at the school. = Kansas = The mother of former Kansas (KU) star Josh Jackson, Apples Jones, reportedly received $2,700 from ASM during Jackson's college career. The April 2018 indictments raised more serious issues surrounding the Kansas program, which is also sponsored by Adidas. Gatto and the coach of an Adidas- sponsored AAU team were alleged to have given at least $90,000 to the mother of a KU recruit between October 2016 and November 2017 in exchange for the player's commitment to the school. Sources close to the investigation told Yahoo! Sports that this player was Billy Preston, who committed to KU in November 2016 and enrolled at the school in 2017. He played in two exhibition games, but the school did not allow him to play during the beginning 2017‚Äì18 season and then left school after questions were raised about his ownership of a car which he was driving at the time of an auto accident. Another member of KU's 2017 recruiting class, Silvio De Sousa, was linked to illicit payments in the 2018 indictments. The University attempted a plea deal acknowledging the payment to De Sousa was used to cover an online class. In April 2019, the University submitted their formal appeal to have De Sousa be re-instated for the 2019‚Äì2020 season. = Texas = Then-current Texas player Eric Davis Jr. allegedly received $1,500 from ASM. Texas held him out of the team's February 24 game against Oklahoma State. In addition, former Longhorns player Prince Ibeh was found in Dawkins' list of players and/or families who had met with or dined with Dawkins while in high school or college. = San Diego State = Then-current San Diego State player Malik Pope allegedly received $1,400 from ASM. Pope was withheld from the team's February 24 game against San Jose State while the school launched an internal investigation into the allegations. San Diego State cleared Pope to play prior to the Aztecs' February 27 game against Boise State, determining that there was no credible evidence that Pope had received any impermissible benefits. = Clemson = Former Clemson star Jaron Blossomgame reportedly received a payment of $1,100 while at the school. = Wichita State = The ASM documents allege that former Wichita State star Fred VanVleet received at least $1,000 while playing for the school. = Michigan State = The mother of then-current Michigan State star Miles Bridges reportedly received several hundred dollars in advances from ASM. An internal Michigan State investigation found that allegations that Bridges' mother had received about $400 in cash from Dawkins were false, but confirmed that Dawkins had paid slightly over $70 for a dinner with Bridges family members (though without the player present). Bridges was temporarily ruled ineligible because of the dinner, but his eligibility was restored on February 24, just in time to play for the Spartans' regular season finale at Wisconsin. Bridges made a $40 contribution (the approximate value of his family members' meals at the Dawkins meeting) to a charity of his choice as part of the reinstatement process. = Other players potentially implicated = The ASM documents also indicated that several players, or their family members, had either met or dined with Dawkins while the players were in high school or college. According to a lawyer involved with NCAA compliance issues who was interviewed in the Yahoo! Sports report, merely meeting with an agent is not an NCAA violation, but if the agent pays for a player's or family member's meal, the meal can be considered an \\"extra benefit\\" under NCAA rules. In addition to the aforementioned Knox and Ibeh, the following then-current and former NCAA players were listed in the ASM documents in this context: * Current players (at the time of the revelations): ** Wendell Carter Jr., Duke ** Collin Sexton, Alabama * Former players: ** Wade Baldwin, Vanderbilt ** Tony Bradley, North Carolina ** Malcolm Brogdon, Virginia ** Demetrius Jackson, Notre Dame ** Monte Morris, Iowa State ** Justin Patton, Creighton  See also  * Amateurism in the NCAA * CCNY Point Shaving Scandal * Southern Methodist University football scandal * 1961 NCAA University Division men's basketball gambling scandal * 1978-79 Boston College basketball point shaving scandal * 2015 University of Louisville basketball sex scandal * Penn State child sex abuse scandal  References  Adidas Basketball controversies Sports controversies Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball Arizona Wildcats men's basketball Auburn Tigers men's basketball College basketball controversies in the United States Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball Louisville Cardinals men's basketball Michigan State Spartans men's basketball Miami Hurricanes men's basketball NC State Wolfpack men's basketball NCAA sanctions Oklahoma State Cowboys basketball South Carolina Gamecocks men's basketball USC Trojans men's basketball Corruption in the United States Fraud in the United States Bribery scandals ","title":"2017‚Äì18 NCAA Division I men's basketball corruption scandal"},{"id":"55371158","text":"The 1980 Oklahoma State Cowboys football team represented Oklahoma State University in the Big Eight Conference during the 1980 NCAA Division I-A football season.

The episode was written by Scott M. Gimple and directed by Greg Nicotero, and serves as the 100th episode overall of the series. This episode focuses on the combined attack, involving the communities of the Alexandria Safe-Zone, the Hilltop Colony and the Kingdom, against the Sanctuary, thus starting the \\"All Out War\\" story arc. It also introduces the character Siddiq, portrayed by Avi Nash, who plays a significant role in the upcoming story arcs in the comics. Plot The Militia, a coalition of people from the Alexandria Safe-Zone, the Hilltop Colony and the Kingdom, prepare for war in an alliance to fight the Saviors. Rick (Andrew Lincoln), Maggie (Lauren Cohan) and King Ezekiel (Khary Payton) lead the respective communities in an assault on the Sanctuary. Meanwhile, Carol (Melissa McBride), Morgan (Lennie James), Tara (Alanna Masterson) and Daryl (Norman Reedus) lead a large horde of walkers towards the Sanctuary via controlled distractions. Shortly after, Rick's convoy arrives at the Sanctuary and simultaneously fire warning shots. Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) steps out with his lieutenants‚ÄîDwight (Austin Amelio), Simon (Steven Ogg), Gavin (Jayson Warner Smith), Regina (Traci Dinwiddie), and Eugene (Josh McDermitt). After being taunted by Negan, Rick tells the lieutenants that he will let them live if they surrender, but reminds Negan that he will kill him. After none of the lieutenants accept Rick's offer, Negan tells Rick that he lacks the numbers to win a fight against the Saviors and instructs Gregory (Xander Berkeley), the leader of the Hilltop, to come out. Subsequently, Gregory steps out and asserts that the Hilltop stands with Negan, and the punishment to any Hilltop resident for fighting against the Sanctuary is banishment for the offenders and their families. Jesus (Tom Payne), speaking for all the Hilltop soldiers there, shouts that the Hilltop \\"stands with Maggie\\", refuting Gregory's power. Infuriated, Simon, after deciding he's no longer useful, aggressively pushes Gregory down a set of stairs. On the road, a Savior caravan unintentionally activates a tripwire and sets off an explosion, which is heard at the Sanctuary. Rick tells Negan's lieutenants to make up their minds, but they don't respond. Rick starts a countdown, but ends it early, firing at the walls and windows of the Sanctuary, creating noise to draw the incoming walkers. Negan runs off as his lieutenants run back inside for cover. In the midst of the mayhem, Rick's fighters continue to spray bullets at the Sanctuary, but eventually retreat to their cars for evacuation. With signals sent by Carol's group, Father Gabriel (Seth Gilliam) positions their RV, rigged with explosives, in front of the Sanctuary fence and exits as it continues slowly moving forward. Rick uses a garage door opener to detonate the explosives, successfully breaching the gate. Limping, Negan takes cover behind a sheet of metal as Rick, intent on killing Negan, continues firing at him, but Gabriel urges Rick to evacuate as well, reminding him of the plan. Before he goes, Rick uses an instant camera to snap a picture of Negan at the scene. As the herd closes in on the Sanctuary, Gabriel sees a wounded Gregory and, compelled to help, pulls him to shelter. Gregory panics and takes off, driving away in the car Gabriel was to leave in. With no other way out and surrounded by walkers, Gabriel finds shelter in a box trailer, but Negan is revealed to be there too. Interspersed throughout, the episode cuts to four different scenes, but are not established when they occur relative to present events. In one, Rick and Carl (Chandler Riggs) are scavenging for gas when they encounter Siddiq (Avi Nash), a man of Middle Eastern descent, rambling to himself and begging for food. Carl tries to approach him carefully, but Rick fires a warning shot, scaring him off. Carl scolds Rick, but Rick insists the man could have been a spy for Negan. Carl later returns alone and leaves food for Siddiq, while Siddiq watches him from the nearby bushes. A second scene has Rick, alone, crying to himself against a tree in a forest in the light refracted through a stained glass piece, muttering \\"My mercy prevails over my wrath\\". A third has him mourning over two gravesites at the Hilltop. In the final scene, an older, grey-haired and bearded Rick wakes up in a bed, and with a cane, walks to a living space, and happily greets Carl, Michonne (Danai Gurira) and an older Judith, who leads him outside to an invigorated Alexandria preparing for a festival. Production Avi Nash made his first appearance as Siddiq in the premiere episode of the eighth season For the 100th episode, Nicotero wanted to bring callbacks from the show's premiere episode, \\"Days Gone Bye\\". The scene of Rick and Carl at the gas station was an attempt to recreate shot-for-shot the first scene of the series, though with Carl in Rick's shoes for this episode. This included the secret casting of Addy Miller, the young girl walker Rick encountered in \\"Days Gone Bye\\" but now a teenager, performing as a walker in a similar outfit. Miller's role in the scene was shot separately from Lincoln's, and she had been kept away from Lincoln during the filming, as the production crew were afraid of Lincoln spoiling this should he recognize her. The \\"flashforward\\" scenes were also filmed to mirror Rick waking up from his coma in \\"Days Gone Bye\\". Nicotero brought back Joe Giles, one of the actors that played a walker that followed Rick off a bus in Atlanta as one of walkers used by a Savior watchtower for this episode. Other easter eggs include Carl using the orange backpack that he, Rick, and Michonne collected from a dead hitchhiker from the season three episode \\"Clear\\", and Negan starting a conversation with Rick using the line \\"Let me ask you somethin', Rick\\", which Shane had frequently used in the first two seasons of the show. The scene where the combined groups have gathered and making final preparations for the attack uses a directorial style which Nicotero called their Goodfellas moment, where the camera pans through several small groups and picks up various conversations throughout as well as providing some visual storytelling elements. Nicotero wanted this scene to make the audience feel part of the group while also conveying a lot of information at the same time. This episode also introduces the colored armbands to better distinguish between the residents of each of the three communities participating in the fight against the Saviors. Those fighting from Alexandria have white armbands, meanwhile those from the Hilltop have green bands and the Kingdom have orange ones. The episode's \\"flashforward\\" to an older Rick uses the song \\"Another One Rides the Bus\\", by \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic (a parody of \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" by Queen). Gimple wanted a song during these scenes that was jarring for the audience and that would be something that Rick's daughter Judith would be into but would be distinctive, partially inspired by a toddler that was in Gimple's life that was obsessed with the song. He didn't want a \\"cool\\" song for these scenes, and felt that with Yankovic's music, \\"that there‚Äôs no worry about cool\\", making the song a perfect fit. A small number of journalists were invited by AMC to watch filming of this episode, which took place in May 2017. The episode was dedicated to John Bernecker, a stuntman that died from an accident during filming in July 2017 for the show. It was also dedicated to filmmaker George A. Romero, known as the father of the zombie genre, who had died in July 2017. Gimple said that the success of The Walking Dead \\"owes a great debt\\" to Romero. A special two-hour Talking Dead live show was held at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles following the broadcast of the episode as part of celebrating both the season premiere and 100th episode milestone. Along with host Chris Hardwick, all twenty of the main cast for the season and the showrunners were present along with former stars Sonequa Martin-Green (Sasha Williams), Emily Kinney (Beth Greene), Scott Wilson (Hershel Greene), IronE Singleton (T-Dog), and Michael Rooker (Merle Dixon), while Steven Yeun (Glenn Rhee) and Sarah Wayne Callies (Lori Grimes) provided video messages. Reception Critical reception \\"Mercy\\" received positive reviews from critics, with several critics describing the episode as a return to form for the series. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 91% with an average rating of 7.34 out of 10, based on 32 reviews. The site's consensus reads: \\"Mercy\\" mixes mysterious time-hopping sequences with explosive action to create a more hopeful premiere than previous seasons of The Walking Dead. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a 7.3/10, saying in its verdict \\"This was a good set-up episode, but because we were only given the initial stages of this conflict, the stakes fell a bit flat.\\" Ratings Initial Nielsen viewership numbers estimated that the premiere was watched by 11.44 million viewers with 6.5 million in the 18-49 age bracket, the lowest numbers that a season premiere episode of The Walking Dead has had in five years. However, it was still the most-watched programming outside of NFL games.

His main ideas include: (1) the belief that, for all of the world's non-human beings, their values depend primarily on the subjectivity of humans; He argued that values are given solely by humans, and without humans' subjective thoughts, all of the world's non-human entities would be meaningless; (2) the belief that doubt is the source of enlightenment; Chan once said that \\"Â≠∏Ë≤¥Áü•ÁñëÔºåÂ∞èÁñëÂâáÂ∞èÈÄ≤ÔºåÂ§ßÁñëÂâáÂ§ßÈÄ≤ÔºåÁñëËÄÖË¶∫ÊÇü‰πãÊ©ü‰πü„ÄÇ\\" (Classical Chinese: \\"The most valuable thing about learning is to know doubt. With small doubt comes small progress. With great doubt comes great progress. Doubt is the opportunity of enlightenment.\\"); (3) the advocate for use of certain Buddhist and Taoist rituals as a way of self- training; For instance, he suggested that Buddhist meditation is a good way to train the mind, though some of Chan's disciples were not very fond of this particular idea. As a whole, this style of thoughts has a strong theme of humanism and individualism. It also appeared to have been influenced by Western style of thoughts in its belief in more rational ways of thinking than older Confucian thoughts. Gum-cyun school The portrait of Zam Yoek-sui.

During that time, Rossi assisted thousands of Italian and other immigrants, including many who were interned at the Ellis Island immigration center during World War II. When she began her career, it was unusual for Italian Americans to enter the field of social work. As the daughter of immigrants from Foggia, Italy, she was the first social worker with a \\"foreign background\\" to be hired by the Society for the Protection of Children in Philadelphia. Biography She was born in Manhattan, New York City, in 1901, one of nine children. When she was four years old, the family moved to Brooklyn, where she grew up in a bustling household that also included two grandmothers. Her father was a Baptist, and the family belonged to the Italian Baptist Church in Williamsburg. She attended P.S. 143 and Eastern District High School. After moving to Philadelphia to take a job with the Society for the Protection of Children, she took courses at Temple University. As a social worker, she specialized in working with Italian immigrants, often acting as an interpreter for them. In 1934, she moved back to New York to work for the Italian Welfare League. At the time, many Italians who had relatives in the United States were confused by the documentation requirements and entered the country illegally. In many cases, the head of a household was deported, leaving behind a wife and children who were legal U.S. residents or citizens. Rossi spent most of her time working with the broken families of deportees. During the 1930s and 40s it was especially difficult for the wives to find employment, and Rossi assisted them with applying for government relief. She also assisted those who were incarcerated on Ellis Island, providing them with necessities such as toothpaste and shaving supplies that the government did not provide. In many cases, according to Rossi, innocent people were needlessly detained for months at a time due to bureaucratic mixups. She also helped war brides, some of whom had come to the U.S. on the promise of marriage only to be abandoned by their fianc√©s. After the fascist regime in Italy passed antisemitic legislation, Rossi assisted Jewish refugees from Italy, and was criticized for it by some of her fellow Italian Americans. In 1956 she assisted survivors of the crash of the SS Andrea Doria. As Rossi gained experience, she became responsible for overseeing most of the League's activities. Some of her papers are on file with the Center for Migration Studies of New York.

He discovered the first known upwelling system in southern Australia and was professionally involved in fisheries and aquaculture management for 38 years. He was head of South Australian Research and Development Institute (SARDI) from 1992 to 2010.  Career  Lewis joined South Australia's Department of Fisheries as a research officer in 1973, where he worked in support of the rock lobster fishery. By 1987 he was working in a research management capacity, balancing fisheries, aquaculture and marine conservation interests. He joined SARDI in 1992, and was appointed Executive Director in 1993.

Corte di Giarola is presently a multi- purpose facility. It includes the headquarters of the Ente di Gestione per i Parchi (meaning the Park Management Authority) and Biodiversit√† Emilia Occidentale. It also hosts the Museum of Tomato (in Italian Museo del pomodoro), the . (in Italian Museo della pasta) being part of Museum of Food (Musei del cibo), the Museo Sotto il segno dell'Acqua which is an exhibition trail dedicated to the Taro River Regional Park, in addition to small 99-seat theatre called Teatro alla Corte, plus an auditorium hall, two conference rooms and a restaurant. The complex originally contained the church Chiesa di San Nicomede, located in the southwest corner of the court. Now the complex retains just a few portions of the exterior wall of the original Romanesque structure, decorated with a motif with Lombard bands; the interior, covered by a ceiling in wooden beams rebuilt after the bombings of World War II, displays some valuable works dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries. History The court was originally built between the 8th and 9th centuries by the order of Ingo, a nobleman; the building served as location for a fortified garrison on a nearby ford of a branch of River Taro. Because of its proximity to the watercourse, it was known by the name of Glarola, probably of Latin origin, in reference to the large amount of gravel deposited on the banks of the river. The region's feudal lordship gave the building in 1034 AD to the monastery of San Paulo in Parma. The monastery turned it into an independent agricultural court, protected by walls and equipped with houses, stables, dairy and mill powered by the waters of the Naviglio canal; the wooded and swampy surrounding lands were reclaimed and cultivated. In 1187, Pope Gregory VIII issued Papal bull confirming the rights to the court and to the Romanesque church dedicated to St Nicomede (Chiesa di San Nicomede) and the adjoining chapel as part of the administration of San Prospero di Collecchio church. To defend the building and the ford, the bishop of Parma also erected a defensive tower, as an extension of his defensive effort of the nearby castles of Collecchio, Segalara, Madregolo and Carona. The structure was acquired by the Rossi but was largely destroyed by the Parmesans in 1308. From 1440 the fortified structures were almost completely demolished or converted into dwellings. According to the Catasto farnesiano of 1562, the court house, now dependent on the Parma magistrate inhabited 110 people, ran an area of 1140 Parmesan biolines (corresponding to approximately 342 hectares of land), largely belonging to the monastery of San Paulo; the cultivations extended particularly in the western plain, as the river Taro flowed far more westward at that time. In 1760, the Romanesque church was modified with a neoclassical style. After the Napoleonic conquest of the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza, the court remained subject to the Commune of Parma for some years, but in 1806 it was incorporated with that of Collecchio. Following the suppression of the religious orders that affected the Benedictines of the San Paulo monastery, in 1811 the estate was confiscated by the French government and rented out to agricultural entrepreneurs, notably Camillo and Alessandro Zileri. The inhabitants of the resort had reportedly reached 312 in 1855, to decrease slightly in the following decades. The lands were subdivided and privatized, while the court itself was purchased at the end of the 19th century by the Montagna family, who dedicated part of the surrounding land to tomato cultivation and built adjacent a preserved factory and a modern dairy with attached breeding of pigs, leased to external conductors. Gradually the old structures deteriorated, while the canning industry was expanded by the renters after the 1930s. During World War II, on April 17, 1945, the court was hit by the bombings of Allied aircraft, which caused the death of nine people and the partial collapse of the church (Chiesa di San Nicomede), of which only a few portions of the external walls survived; the place of worship was rebuilt in 1950 in the original Romanesque forms. The food factory taken over in 1957 by the entrepreneur Ercole Azzali; a few years later, however, it was closed, followed by the dairy factory. After the cessation of production activity, the complex's degradation increased, until in 1998 the court and the annexed structures were purchased by Ente Parco Fluviale Regionale del Taro, then the Ente di Gestione per i Parchi (Park Management Authority) and the Biodiversit√† Emilia Occidentale. The new owners started the renovation works, using part of the building as their headquarters; the east wing was provided with exhibition and auditorium halls. In 2005, the farmhouse was restored, becoming an exhibit of a historic laboratory. In 2006, with additional financing of the region of Emilia-Romagna, the Collecchio Municipality and the Cariparma Foundation, the south wing, originally used as a woodcutting and storage facility, was transformed into a theatrical theater; Teatro alla Corte (The Court Theater) was inaugurated in September 2007. In the same year, the west wing renovations were was started, originally the ancient stables. The Museum of Tomato was inaugurated on the wing in 2010.Mariagrazia Villa, Il Museo del Pomodoro, in Parma economica, n¬∫ 1, Parma, Camera di Commercio di Parma, 2010 Further renovations in the west wing yard serving earlier as a pasta factory and a mill followed and mill; and in 2014, the renovated areas became the home of the Museum of Pasta with both tomato and pasta museums as part of the Musei del cibo (the food museum). In 2014, the roof of the church of San Nicomede was also rebuilt. It serves as a parish house serving the hamlet of Pontescodogna.

Kunz spent his early childhood in Singapore, which influenced his fusion style of cooking later in his life. He had a career that spanned three continents and was one of Manhattan‚Äôs most acclaimed chefs of the 1990s, when he worked for nine years at Lespinasse. Biography Born in Singapore on February 24, 1955, Kunz was raised there as well as in Switzerland. He received his culinary education in Bern, Switzerland. He worked at the Beau Rivage Palace in Lausanne and Baur au Lac in Zurich. Then, Kunz apprenticed under Swiss chef Fr√©dy Girardet for five years in Crissier. After that, he moved to the Regent Hotel in Hong Kong, where he learned French and Chinese cooking methods. In 1988, he moved to Adrienne at the Peninsula Hotel in New York. In 1991, he became the Executive Chef of Lespinasse, becoming the highest-paid chef in the city at the St. Regis Hotel, where he was allowed freedom of creativity and budget to attract members of the \\"Concorde crowd\\". While there, he created a special spoon used by the chefs in his kitchen, which was later cited as the favorite kitchen tool for many chefs. He eventually left the restaurant during period of success to venture out and founded his own restaurants, including Salt and Char in Saratoga, New York, Cafe Gray in the Time Warner Center in Manhattan, and Grayz in West 54th Street, also in Manhattan. Kunz mentored many future celebrity chefs, such as Andrew Carmellini, Floyd Cardoz, Rocco DiSpirito, and Corey Lee. He died of a stroke in March 2020 in Poughkeepsie, New York. Cuisine Kunz's dishes reflect his travel and educational experience. They marry classic French technique with Pan-Asian flavors and ingredients that he became familiar with in Singapore as a child and later in Hong Kong, where he worked as a chef for five years. He layered techniques from Europe, India, China, and Southeast Asia in his work. In 1994, Ruth Reichl, a food writer, chef, editor, and producer, awarded Kunz a four-star review in the New York Times, the first she had ever given. Aside from the Four Stars from the New York Times, his work earned him multiple James Beard nominations for \\"Outstanding Chef\\".

Example of Australasian Recycling Label. End-of-use destinations: yellow bin (left), store drop off (center), and red bin (right). Recycling in Australia is a widespread but not comprehensive part of waste management in Australia. Various paper recycling and appliance recycling services are available. Household recycling is encouraged through the use of recycling bins. A sampling of the contents of the recycling bin in Victoria shows around 10% of the material should not have been disposed of by bin. These bins are comingled, meaning that often paper, glass and hard plastic all go into the same bin. Electronic waste collection services were mandated under The National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme. The scheme was established in 2011. Australia does not have a national scheme for battery recycling. Container deposit legislation has been established in several states while others are rolling out schemes. Despite some recycling and re-use of lightweight plastic bags they are being phased out. Clean Up Australia is a national organisation dedicated to addressing environmental issues such as recycling. In 2014-2015, 58% of all waste produced in Australia was recycled or recovered. In 2016-2017, 46% of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) was recycled. A parliamentary inquiry into the waste and recycling industry in Australia filed a report on 13 June 2018. On 1 January 2018, China restricted imports on 24 categories of Australian recycling materials, resulting in stockpiling of recyclable materials in Australia. Waste Management Association of Australia president Garth Lamb has advocated for infrastructure projects to use recovered recycled materials rather than raw materials, such as crushed glass replacing sand in roadworks. The restrictions impose a maximum contamination threshold for accepted materials of 0.5% which is unlikely to be met by the industry in Australia.  Vehicle recycling  Automotive recycling is considered as one of the main solution to the environmental concern about growing number of vehicles reaching End_Of_Life (EOL) cycle. According to Australian Bureau of Statistics data, during 2001 to 2015 the number of new motor vehicles sales increased by 48% in Australia. Similarly with average life cycle of vehicle in Australia of 10.1 years, the number of vehicle reaching its EOL cycle is growing fast too. Only during 2014 to 2015 in Australia 765,828 number of vehicles reached their End-Of-Life cycle . To face this environmental concern automotive recycling has very important role to play. In regard to vehicle recycling What makes this issue an opportunity for business is the high rate recovery 85-95% of the material used in vehiclesDepartment of the Environment, Australia. 2009. National Waste Policy: Less Waste, More Resources (accessed September 17, 2020). In Australia, vehicle reached their EOL are passed from owners to the auto recyclers or so called auto wreckers directly or through insurance company, car repair mechanics and used car dealers.McNamara N. Vehicle Recycling and Sustainability. Melbourne, Australia: International Specialised Skills Institute Inc; 2009 In first stage the car batteries and fluids will be removed under depollution process. In second stage the valuable and high demand vehicle parts are recovered EOL vehicles and sale in the market for reuse and to get financial gain. In last stage of the recycling the remaining part of EOL vehicle are passed to metal recycling facilities to recover the valuable metals. In different parts of the world, auto recycling or EOL vehicles waste is restricted with number of national legislations. In Europe it is European union body, similarly Japanese and Koreans have their own specific measurements and regulatory legislations. In contrast some developed countries like US, Australia and Canada have no specific regulations in the form of mandatory legislations to follow for EOL vehicles management. In Australia the EOL vehicle managements are driven mostly by economic mechanisms. under recent circumstances of no national legislation in regard to EOL vehicles managements, most recyclers are motivated due to the value of metal scarp and valuable parts they acquire from vehicles.

The PMR controls the main part of this region, and also the city of Bender and its surrounding localities on the west bank, in the historical region of Bessarabia. After the dissolution of the USSR, tensions between Moldova and the breakaway Transnistrian territory escalated into a military conflict that started in March 1992 and was concluded by a ceasefire in July of the same year. As part of that agreement, a three-party (Russia, Moldova, Transnistria) Joint Control Commission supervises the security arrangements in the demilitarised zone, comprising twenty localities on both sides of the river. Although the ceasefire has held, the territory's political status remains unresolved: Transnistria is an unrecognised but de facto independent semi-presidential republic with its own government, parliament, military, police, postal system, currency and vehicle registration. Its authorities have adopted a constitution, flag, national anthem, and coat of arms. It is the only country still using the hammer and sickle on its flag. After a 2005 agreement between Moldova and Ukraine, all Transnistrian companies that seek to export goods through the Ukrainian border must be registered with the Moldovan authorities. This agreement was implemented after the European Union Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine (EUBAM) took force in 2005. Most Transnistrians also have Moldovan citizenship, but many Transnistrians also have Russian and Ukrainian citizenship. The largest ethnic group is Moldovans (32.1%), who historically had a higher share of the population, up to 49.4% in 1926. Transnistria, Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Artsakh are post-Soviet \\"frozen conflict\\" zones. These four partially recognised states maintain friendly relations with each other and form the Community for Democracy and Rights of Nations. Names The region is also known in English as \\"Trans-Dniestr\\" or \\"Transdniestria\\". Etymologically, these names are adaptations of the Romanian colloquial name of the region, \\"Transnistria\\" meaning \\"beyond the River Dniester\\". The documents of the government of Moldova refer to the region as St√Ænga Nistrului (in full, UnitƒÉ»õile Administrativ-Teritoriale din St√Ænga Nistrului) meaning \\"Left Bank of the Dniester\\" (in full, \\"Administrative-territorial unit(s) of the Left Bank of the Dniester\\"). The name of the region according to the Transnistrian authorities is Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR) (, Pridnestrovskaya Moldavskaya Respublika; Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet: –†–µ–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∞ –ú–æ–ª–¥–æ–≤–µ–Ω—è—Å–∫—ç –ù–∏—Å—Ç—Ä—è–Ω—ç, –†–ú–ù, ; , Prydnistrovs'ka Moldavs'ka Respublika). The short form of this name is Pridnestrovie (, Pridnestrovye; Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet: –ù–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–∏—è, Nistrenia; , Prydnistrovya). \\"Pridnestrovie\\" is a transliteration of the Russian \\"–ü—Ä–∏–¥–Ω–µ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤—å–µ\\" meaning \\"[a land] by the [River] Dniester\\". History Antiquity and Middle Ages Indo-European tribes had for millennia inhabited the area where Transnistria now is when it was a borderland between Dacia and Scythia. The Tyragetae (a Getae Thracian tribe) inhabited the area around the River Dniester (called \\"Tyras\\" in ancient documents) as well as the Scythians. Early Germanic and Turkic tribes were present in the area during their attacks and invasions of the Roman Empire. From 56 AD, the coastal area around the city of Tyras was occupied by the Romans for nearly four centuries, forming part of the province of Lower Moesia. Tyras enjoyed great development during Roman times: there is a series of its coins with heads of emperors from Domitian to Alexander Severus. But in the second half of the fourth century the area was continuously attacked by barbarians and the Roman legionaries left Tyras. In the early Middle Ages, Slavic tribes of Tivertsi and UlichsThe Laurentian Codex of the Primary Chronicle () contains the following lines (translated): Ulichi, Tivertsy lived along the Dniester; a lot of them settled on the Danube; settled along the Dniester down to the sea, their cities can be found unto this day. populated larger areas, including Transnistria, followed by Turkic nomads such as the PetchenegsPorphyrogenitus, Constantine.

Possibly an early part of Kievan Rus', after the Mongol invasion of Europe in 1241, the territory was briefly under Mongol control (yet probably without any permanent settlements) and later under the Crimean Khanate. Early modern period From the 15th century, northern Transnistria (current districts of Camenca and R√Æbni≈£a) were part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania,George Reichersdorf: Moldavi√¶ qu√¶ olim Daci√¶ pers, chorographia, Georgio a Reichersdorf Transilvano auctore, Vienn√¶ 1541.Bronovius and Georg Werner: Transylvania, Moldavia and Chersonesus Tauric√¶. Published by Arnold Mylius, Cologne, 1595.Antonio Bonfini (1434‚Äì1503): Rerum Ungaricarum decades quatuor cum dimidiaGiovanni Botero (1540‚Äì1617): Relazioni universali, Venice, 1591Giovanni Antonio Magini (1555‚Äì1617): Geographie universae, Venice, 1596. and later to the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth (1569‚Äì1793) which encouraged the migration of peasants into the territory from the neighbouring populated areas (from north and from west). Prince of Moldavia George Ducas (1665‚Äì66, 1668‚Äì72, 1678‚Äì84) built a court at »öicanova on the east bank of the Dniester, and one at Nimirov on the Southern Bug, last mentioned in Moldavian hands in 1765.Viorel Dolha, \\"Totul despre Transnistria\\", Aiarad.ro The localities DubƒÉsari, Ra»ôcov, VasilcƒÉu, as well as four other currently in Ukraine are mentioned in 17th‚Äì18th centuries as fairs for the Dniester-Bug region. In 1769, a document dated at Bender mentions the then title of the Mitropolitan of Moldavia as Mitropolitan of Proilavia, of Tamarova, of Hotin, and of all the borders of the Danube, of the Dniester, and the Han's Ukraine, the latter being a common reference to the then sparsely populated Dniester‚ÄìSouthern Bug‚ÄìDniepr area. Before becoming part of the Russian Empire in 1792 (southern part) and 1793 (northern part) the largest groups living between the Dniester and the Bug rivers were Moldavian, Ruthenian (Ukrainian) and Tatar peasants.Andrew Wilson: \\"The Ukrainians: Engaging the Eastern Diaspora\\" (Westview Press, 1998) The Russian census of 1793 of the Ochakov region (southern part of the Dniester- Bug area) mentions a totality of 67 villages, of which 49 are mentioned as Moldavian and 18 as Tatar. The first candidate for the governor of the new Russian region was the Moldavian boyar of Greek ancestry Alexandru I. Mavrocordat. The northern part of Transnistria had Ruthenian (Ukrainian) and Moldavian villages. Russian Empire Grigoriopol was founded by Russian Empress Catherine II in 1792. In 1792, the region became part of the Russian Empire as a result of the sixth Russo-Turkish War. In that year, the general Alexander Suvorov founded modern Tiraspol as a Russian border fortress. Until the Russian Revolution of 1917, the current Transnistria was divided among the imperial guberniyas of Podolia, Kherson, and Bessarabia. Most of the territory which now is Transnistria was part of the larger New Russia region, hence it saw a strong colonisation process, with a multitude of ethnicities being settled: lands were given to enserfed peasantry from Russia and Ukraine in Nova Serbia, while Jews and Germans were brought in to facilitate economic development. Soviet and Romanian administration Moldavian ASSR (orange) and Romania, 1924‚Äì1940 Nowadays Transnistria in relation to the rest of Moldova, landlocked along the border with Ukraine Transnistria became an autonomous political entity in 1924 with the proclamation of the Moldavian ASSR, which included today's Transnistria (4,000 km2) and an adjacent area (9,000 km2) around the city of Balta in modern-day Ukraine, but nothing from Bessarabia, which at the time formed part of Romania. One of the reasons for the creation of the Moldavian ASSR was the desire of the Soviet Union at the time to eventually incorporate Bessarabia. The Moldavian SSR, organised by a decision of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on 2 August 1940, was formed out of a part of Bessarabia (taken from Romania on 28 June, after the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact) and out of a part of the Moldavian ASSR roughly equivalent to present-day Transnistria. In 1941, after Axis forces invaded the Soviet Union during the Second World War, they defeated the Soviet troops in the region and occupied it. Romania controlled the entire region between Dniester and Southern Bug rivers, including the city of Odessa as local capital. The Romanian-administered territory ‚Äì called the Transnistria Governorate ‚Äì with an area of 44,000 km2 and a population of 2.3 million inhabitants, was divided into 13 counties: Ananiev, Balta, Berzovca, Dubasari, Golta, Jugastru, Movilau, Oceacov, Odessa, Ovidiopol, R√Æbni»õa, Tiraspol and Tulcin. This enlarged Transnistria was home to nearly 200,000 Romanian/Moldovan-speaking residents. The Romanian administration of Transnistria attempted to stabilise the situation in the area under Romanian control, implementing a process of Romanianization. During the Romanian occupation of 1941‚Äì44, between 150,000 and 250,000 Ukrainian and Romanian Jews had been deported to Transnistria and the majority were executed or died from other causes in ghettos and concentration camps of the Governorate. After the Red Army reconquered the area in 1944, Soviet authorities executed, exiled or imprisoned hundreds of the Moldavian SSR inhabitants in the following months on charges of collaboration with the \\"German-fascist occupiers\\". A later campaign was directed against the rich peasant families, who were deported to Kazakhstan and Siberia. Over the course of two days, 6‚Äì7 July 1949, a plan named \\"Operation South\\" saw the deportation of over 11,342 families by the order of the Moldovian Minister of State Security, I. L. Mordovets. Secession Igor Smirnov, first president of Transnistria from 1991‚Äì2011 Soviet symbols are still used in Transnistria. In the 1980s, Mikhail Gorbachev's policies of perestroika and glasnost in the Soviet Union allowed political liberalisation at a regional level. This led to the creation of various informal movements all over the country, and to a rise of nationalism within most Soviet republics. In the Moldavian SSR in particular, there was a significant resurgence of pro-Romanian nationalism among ethnic Moldovans.Timeline: Moldova BBC Country Profile: Moldova The most prominent of these movements was the Popular Front of Moldova. In the spring of 1988, PFM demanded that the Soviet authorities declare Moldovan the only state language, return to the use of the Latin alphabet, and recognise the shared ethnic identity of Moldovans and Romanians. The more radical factions of the Popular Front espoused extreme anti-minority, ethnocentric and chauvinist positions,Chechnya: Tombstone of Russian Power, Anatol Lieven, Yale University Press, 1999, , pp 246Can Liberal Pluralism Be Exported?, Will Kymlicka, Magdalena Opalski, Oxford University Press, 2001, , pp 208 calling for minority populations, particularly the Slavs (mainly Russians and Ukrainians) and Gagauz, to leave or be expelled from Moldova. On 31 August 1989, the Supreme Council of the Moldavian SSR adopted Moldovan as the only official language with Russian retained only for secondary purposes, returned Moldovan to the Latin alphabet, and declared a shared Moldovan-Romanian linguistic identity. As plans for major cultural changes in Moldova were made public, tensions rose further. Ethnic minorities felt threatened by the prospects of removing Russian as the official language, which served as the medium of interethnic communication, and by the possible future reunification of Moldova and Romania, as well as the ethnocentric rhetoric of the Popular Front. The Yedinstvo (Unity) Movement, established by the Slavic population of Moldova, pressed for equal status to be given to both Russian and Moldovan. Transnistria's ethnic and linguistic composition differed significantly from most of the rest of Moldova. The share of ethnic Russians and Ukrainians was especially high and an overall majority of the population, some of them ethnic Moldovans, spoke Russian as a mother tongue. Ethnic Moldovans accounted for less than 40% of Transnistria's population in 1989. The nationalist Popular Front won the first free parliamentary elections in the Moldavian SSR in the spring of 1990, and its agenda started slowly to be implemented. On 2 September 1990, the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic was proclaimed as a Soviet republic by an ad hoc assembly, the Second Congress of the Peoples' Representatives of Transnistria. Violence escalated when in October 1990 the Popular Front called for volunteers to form armed militias to stop an autonomy referendum in Gagauzia, which had an even higher share of ethnic minorities. In response, volunteer militias were formed in Transnistria. In April 1990, nationalist mobs attacked ethnic Russian members of parliament, while the Moldovan police refused to intervene or restore order.Modern Hatreds: The Symbolic Politics of Ethnic War, Stuart J. Kaufman, Cornell University Press, 2001, , pp. 143 In the interest of preserving a unified Moldavian SSR within the USSR and preventing the situation escalating further, then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, while citing the restriction of civil rights of ethnic minorities by Moldova as the cause of the dispute, declared the Transnistria proclamation to be lacking legal basis and annulled it by presidential decree on 22 December 1990. Nevertheless, no significant action was taken against Transnistria and the new authorities were slowly able to establish control of the region. War of Transnistria The War of Transnistria followed armed clashes on a limited scale which broke out between Transnistrian separatists and Moldova as early as November 1990 at DubƒÉsari. Volunteers, including Cossacks, came from Russia to help the separatist side. –ù–µ—Å–∫–æ–ª—å–∫–æ —Ö—Ä–æ–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –æ –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–µ –∏ —ç–≤–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏–∏ –≤–æ–π–Ω—ã In mid-April 1992, under the agreements on the split of the military equipment of the former Soviet Union negotiated between the former 15 republics in the previous months, Moldova created its own Defence Ministry.

Starting from 2 March 1992, there was concerted military action between Moldova and Transnistria. Throughout early 1992 the fighting intensified. The former Soviet 14th Guards Army entered the conflict in its final stage, opening fire against Moldovan forces; Approximately 700 people were killed. Since then, Moldova has exercised no effective control or influence on Transnistrian authorities. A ceasefire agreement was signed on 21 July 1992 and has held to the present day. Geography Dniester River in Bender Transnistria is landlocked and borders Bessarabia (i.e., the rest of Moldova, for 411 km) to the West, and Ukraine (for 405 km) to the East. It is a narrow valley stretching in the North-South direction along the bank of the Dniester river, which forms a natural boundary along most of the border with (the rest of) Moldova. The territory controlled by the PMR is mostly, but not completely, coincident with the left (eastern) bank of Dniester. It includes ten cities and towns, and 69 communes, with a total of 147 localities (counting the unincorporated ones as well). Six communes on the left bank (Cocieri, Molovata NouƒÉ, Corjova, P√Ær√Æta, Co»ôni»õa, and Doro»õcaia) remained under the control of the Moldovan government after the War of Transnistria in 1992, as part of the DubƒÉsari District. They are situated north and south of the city of DubƒÉsari, which itself is under PMR control. The village of Roghi of Molovata NouƒÉ Commune is also controlled by the PMR (Moldova controls the other nine of the ten villages of the six communes). On the west bank, in Bessarabia, the city of Bender and four communes (containing six villages) to its east, south-east, and south, on the opposite bank of the river Dniester from the city of Tiraspol (Proteagailovca, G√Æsca, Chi»õcani, and Cremenciug) are controlled by the PMR. The localities controlled by Moldova on the eastern bank, the village of Roghi, and the city of DubƒÉsari (situated on the eastern bank and controlled by the PMR) form a security zone along with the six villages and one city controlled by the PMR on the western bank, as well as two (Varni»õa and Copanca) on the same west bank under Moldovan control. The security situation inside it is subject to the Joint Control Commission rulings. The main transportation route in Transnistria is the road Tiraspol-DubƒÉsari- R√Æbni»õa. North and south of DubƒÉsari it passes through the lands of the villages controlled by Moldova (Doro»õcaia, Cocieri, Roghi, while Vasilievca is entirely situated east of the road). Conflict erupted on several occasions when the PMR prevented the villagers from reaching their farmland east of the road.Trygve Kalland and Claus Neukirch, Moldovan Mission seeks solution to Dorotcaia's bitter harvest, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, 10 August 2005New checkpoint to appear in Moldova conflict zone after clash, RIA Novosti, 13 January 2007 Locuitorii satului Vasilievca de pe malul st√¢ng al Nistrului trƒÉiesc clipe de co»ômar, Deutsche Welle, 17 March 2005. Transnistrians are able to travel (normally without difficulty) in and out of the territory under PMR control to neighbouring Moldovan-controlled territory, to Ukraine, and on to Russia, by road or (when service is not interrupted by political tensions) on two international trains, the year-round Moscow- Chi»ôinƒÉu, and the seasonal Saratov-Varna. International air travellers rely on the airport in Chi»ôinƒÉu, the Moldovan capital, or the airport in Odessa, in Ukraine.

She helped the Sui Empire contain the mutiny of various Baiyue tribes and start the sinicization of the region, indirectly helping Lingnan evolve into her current form. There are many temples dedicated to her in the Lingnan region, resulting in her becoming a deity-like figure. Yun Sung-wun Yun Sung-wun (Jyutping: Jyun4 sung4 wun6; Traditional Chinese: Ë¢ÅÂ¥áÁÖ•) is another prominent Cantonese historic figure. Born in late 16th century, he was a general to the Ming Empire, known for participating in campaigns against the then invading Manchu people and several military engineering programs. He was later falsely accused of treason under the Chongzhen Emperor and executed. However, he still remained a heroic figure to many Cantonese. Nowadays, Cantonese have built many monuments for Yun across Lingnan, and his catchphrase \\"ÊéâÂì™Â™ΩÔºåÈ†ÇÁ°¨‰∏äÔºÅ\\" (Jyutping: Diu6 naa5 maa1 ding2 ngaang6 soeng5; literally \\"fuck his mom, hit it hard!\\"; Note: this is Cantonese profanity), which he said whenever he was facing an enemy force, is common knowledge among Cantonese people. The Chinese government's removal of this phrase from one of his monuments even sparked a massive protest by Cantonese.

Biography  He was born around 1634, in the diocese of Chartres. He acceded to priesthood around 1663-1664. He was received at the of Le Mans on October 1654, aged about 30.Archives de l‚Äô√©v√™ch√© du Mans, 13 October 1654, mentioned after Granger 1996 p. 1022, and before it Anjubault 1862, p. 11-12. He became master of music at the Saint-Gatien Tours Cathedral from 1657 to 1661. He competed and was rewarded at the puy de musique du Mans in 1657.Chambois 1894 p. 12. According to Chartier and Yvon, Boutry would have spent some time in Rouen as \\"master of music\\" and in Noyon as \\"master of the church\\".See Chartier 1897 and Yvon 1964; these elements are to be taken with all reservations in the absence of archival sources. He was hired as head of the chapel of the cath√©drale Notre-Dame de Paris from 4 August 1662 to 20 October 1663.Yvon 1964 p 384-387. From this period, it is known he was granted a leave of absence for fifteen days without knowing the reason.Paris AN : LL 205, 9 September 1662 (p. 730), mentioned after Gautier 1993 p. 14. According to Granger (1996), he briefly returned to Chartres and was named a priest, before returning to Le Mans.Cf. Beauhaire. An extract from the poster of the Puy d'√âvreux in 1667 (AD Eure : D 5) He returned to Le Mans around Christmas 1664, where he succeeded Jean Colin as chapel master of the Saint-Julien cathedral.AD Sarthe: G 936, 19 December 1664, 9 March, 15 April, 15 May and 1 June 1665, mentioned after Granger 1996 p. 1022. Shortly thereafter, he asked the Chapter to purchase a spinet.Idem, 15 May 1665, mentioned p. 877. He remained there for five years and, in addition to his emoluments as a chapel master, he received 10 sols per day as vicar.Le Mans, Archives de l‚Äô√©v√™ch√© : B 16, 21 September 1668, mentioned after Granger 1996 . He was also endowed in December 1665 with the chapel of Sainte-Marie- Madeleine, served in the church of Le Mans. In 1666, Boutry competed at the and received the silver harp and the second prize for the motet.This appears on the poster of the 1667 puy de musique (AD Eure: D 5), miraculously preserved. About this poster, see Guillo 2011. In the same year, he was a judge at the puy de musique du Mans, having the two motets received sang and whose best was none other than Louis Bouteiller's one, then a child in the psallete he directed, \\"de facto\\" excluded from the competition.AD Sarthe : G 936, 22 November 1666, mentioned by Granger 1996 p. 874. In January 1670 he was admonished by the Chapter for not having led or brought the children back to church and for having missed the choir service, under threat of dismissal,Le Mans, Archives de La l‚Äô√©v√™ch√© : B 16, 15 January 1670, mentioned after Granger 1996 p. 848 et 1022. which may be a sign of disagreement with the chapter. He then moved closer to the chapter of the collegiate church of Saint-Pierre-la-Cour, without respecting the hierarchical ways, and agreed with it to move on to its service as a chapel master (he had already worked there between 1654 and 1657). He was immediately dismissed by the St-Julien Cathedral chapter.Le Mans, Archives de l‚Äô√©v√™ch√© : B 16, 25 January 1670, mentioned after Granger 1996 p. 1023. This hasty departure did not prevent him from soliciting the chapter to borrow three children of choir for an exit from his mastership at the Cordeliers: idem, 22 October 1670, mentioned by idem p. 1109. It was musician Louis Bouteiller who succeeded him at Saint-Julien. His commitment to Saint-Pierre is formalised on 26 January.AD Sarthe : G 494, 26 January 1670, mentioned after Granger 1996 p. 1023. There, he evicted Fran√ßois Fleury, hired two months earlier, who was probably not doing the job. The act of his commitment specifies that he had previously worked in Tours, at the Noyon Cathedral, at Notre-Dame de Paris, in addition to the cathedral Saint- Julien du Mans.The engagement is the subject of a contract in front of the notary Jean Delabbaye signed on 15 February 1670, mentioned by Granger 1996 p. 833. His service in Saint-Pierre-la-Cour gives some examples of the daily life of a chapel master. One month after his engagement, he got a chapter credit to buy a dozen music masses from Robert III Ballard.Idem, 1 March 1670, mentioned . In July 1671, he was asked by the Chapter to provide for the replacement of a failing choirboy within a few weeks.Idem, 31 July 1671, mentioned p. 806. In the summer of 1672, he was granted a two-week leave of absence to go to Paris to go to his business - we don't know which - in the company of his colleague Pierre Ribi√®re.Idem, 10 July 1672, mentioned . He remained in St. Peter's until October 1676, not without being noticed several times for his strong character.Idem, 1 July, 6 and 12 November, 17 and 18 December 1672, mentioned p. 1086 and 1091. Jean Mourot succeeded him. At the end of October 1676, he was named canon of Pruill√© l'Eguill√©, a small village in the south-east of Le Mans.After Granger 1996. On the other hand, Gautier (1993) quotes Beauhaire and sends him to Prunay-le-Gillon, south-east of Chartres... He is still cited as a canon of the collegiate church of Saint-Calais in 1688. He died there c. 1690-1695.

The Myanmar authorities blamed ARSA for the deaths. ARSA has denied responsibility, and on 25 September 2017, a spokesperson for the group claimed that the reported attack on the Hindu village by Rohingya insurgents \\"was a lie to undermine ARSA\\". It also rejected Amnesty's report.Myanmar says bodies of 28 Hindu villagers found in Rakhine Statehttps://www.dhakatribune.com/world/south-asia/2018/05/25/arsa-amnesty- allegations-unjustifiable  Background  Bengali Hindus constitute a minority group in Maungdaw District. With a population of around 5,000 they constitute about 1% of the population.  Killings  According to eyewitness accounts, on 25 August, unidentified men in black masks attacked the Hindu villages in Kha Maung Seik also known as Fwaira Bazar or Fakira Bazar. The men spoke several languages they could not identify, but they also spoke the dialect spoken by the Rohingyas and the Hindus. They objected to the official identity cards that were provided by the Myanmar authorities to the Hindus, stating that the Hindus should not have them. The masked men took around 100 people hostage and forced them to march through the fields. They were led into a forest on a hill, where the insurgents separated eight women from the group of hostages, allegedly to set them aside for marriage to the insurgents later. The insurgents then blindfolded the remaining captives, tied their hands behind their back and tied their legs. The hostages then had their throats slit with knives by the insurgents. Three pits were dug by the insurgents, and the corpses were dumped inside. Nine Hindu villages were burnt, resulting in more than 500 Hindu refugees fleeing across the border to Bangladesh. The Hindu villages of Kyeinchaung and Ngakhuya survived the arson attacks, and the villagers have returned.  Forced conversion  Ni Maul, a Hindu leader who helped Myanmar's authorities with the search of the bodies, told the media that the mass-graves were found from testimony of eight Hindu women whose lives were spared and brought to Bangladesh after they agreed to convert to Islam. Four Hindu women in Bangladesh told Agence-France Presse that they were among the eight who escaped. They stated that they were forced to marry the attackers in order to save their lives and they were later taken to camps of Rohingya Muslims in Bangladesh. The Hindu women stated that the militants found them beautiful and decided to convert them. They added that later the eight women along with children were taken to a house in Bawtalar village where they were forced to eat rice with meat, which is prohibited in their religion. They were then brought to Kutuparlaung refugee camp on 28 August where they were housed with Muslims and forced to wear burqas. Exodus Thousands of Hindus fled villages where they lived alongside Muslims and alleged they had been targeted by ARSA. Since the outbreak of the violence in Rakhine in August, 3,000 Hindus from Maungdaw and Buthidaung townships were internally displaced while 500 fled to Bangladesh. Rana Dasgupta, secretary of Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council, stated that Hindu refugees had described murder of 86 Hindus. Hindus who fled the area told Agence-France Presse that masked men stormed their community and later buried the victims after hacking them to death. A Hindu woman stated that masked men dressed in black attacked her village near Kha Maung Seik and she fled to Bangladesh.  Relief and rehabilitation   Bangladesh  When the local Bengali Hindus of Ukhia Upazila in Cox's Bazar District, came to know about Hindu refugees camping in the forest, they brought the Hindu refugees and provided shelter to them near a Hindu temple. A poultry farm was converted to a makeshift refugee camp, where around 300 Hindus were sheltered. The remaining 200 Hindus were provided shelter by the local Hindu families. The local Bengali Hindus provided donations for the daily meals to the Hindu refugees.  Myanmar  Following the massacre hundreds of Hindu families along with the Rakhines fled the rural areas to take shelter in Sittwe. More than 500 Hindus took shelter in four Hindu temples in Sittwe and were partially supported by the Myanmar government relief team. Many Hindus also took refugee in Buddhist monasteries in Ponnagyun and Kyauktaw townships.  Rehabilitation  The Hindu refugees were scared of going back to their native places in the Rakhine State of Myanmar and at the same time fearful of staying in refugee camp in Muslim- majority Bangladesh. Instead, they hoped for rehabilitation in Hindu-majority India. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad leadership expressed that India was the natural homeland for the Hindu refugees from Myanmar. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad along with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh intended to submit a report to the Indian Home Ministry demanding a new policy that would allow Hindus of Bangladesh and Myanmar to seek asylum in India. On the occasion of Durga Puja, 27 Hindu refugees from the Kutupalong refugee camp left the camp to observe Vijayadashami, and reportedly returned to Myanmar.  Investigation  One of the eight abducted Hindu women taken into Bangladesh called up a Hindu community leader in Myanmar and told him about the massacre and the location of the mass graves. Accordingly, the local Hindu leadership prepared a list, where 102 Hindus were identified as missing from the two villages of Ye Baw Kya and Taung Ywar in the Kha Maung Seik area of Maungdaw District. Based on the information, the Myanmar army discovered two mud pits with 28 Hindu corpses outside the village of Ye Baw Kya on 24 September. The victims included 20 women and eight men and children. On 25 September, the search party consisting of the Myanmar army, the police and local Hindu leader discovered 17 Hindu corpses in another two mud pits 400 metres to the north east of the previously discovered mass graves. According to the Hindu leader, the corpses were of men aged between 30 and 50. The local Hindu leadership continued their search for the remaining corpses of the missing Hindus, who are feared dead. The location of the 46 missing villagers of Ye Bauk Kyar is still unknown (as of June 2018). The Hindu villagers believed that they were killed because the Rohingya insurgents suspected them of being government spies. On 27 September, the Myanmar army lifted the restriction on travelling to the conflict zone and allowed foreign journalists to fly there. Six Rohingya insurgents suspected to have been involved in the killings were found among the Rohingya Muslim refugees in Bangladesh. The Bangladesh authorities denied having arrested them on charges of massacre. The Myanmar authorities resolved to bring back the eight Hindu women who were forced to convert to Islam and were taken to Bangladesh by the Rohingya refugees, to stand as witness in the trial. On 22 May 2018, Amnesty International released a report apportioning the blame for the massacre in the village of Ah Nauk Maung Seik on the ARSA and said they were responsible for the deaths in nearby village Kha Maung Seik. The report was based on 'dozens of interviews conducted [in Rakhine State] and across the border in Bangladesh, as well as photographic evidence analysed by forensic pathologists'. ARSA rejected Amnesty's report on 25 May 2018 calling it ‚Äúunjustifiable and careless serious criminal accusations‚Äù. It called for a credible international investigation.  Reactions  The Myanmar authorities accused the Rohingya militants of perpetrating the Hindu massacre in the Kha Maung Seik area. ARSA denied the involvement of the group in the Hindu massacre instead they accused the Buddhist nationalists of creating a divide between the Hindus and Muslims. In a Twitter post they denied any role in the massacre. An alleged Rohingya insurgent, along with his supporters at the Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh, accused the Rakhine Buddhists of the Hindu massacre and putting the blame on Rohingya Muslims. Tirana Hassan, Crisis Response Director at Amnesty International, said, ‚Ä≥It‚Äôs hard to ignore the sheer brutality of ARSA‚Äôs actions, which have left an indelible impression on the survivors we‚Äôve spoken to. Accountability for these atrocities is every bit as crucial as it is for the crimes against humanity carried out by Myanmar‚Äôs security forces in northern Rakhine State ... In this brutal and senseless act, members of ARSA captured scores of Hindu women, men, and children and terrorised them before slaughtering them outside their own villages. The perpetrators of this heinous crime must be held to account‚Ä≥.

Mockeridge was a lecturer at King's College, London, 1917-1922, and lecturer (and later professor) at University College Swansea (now Swansea University) 1922-1954. She was also a Linnean Society Fellow. Her research output included significant work on growth promoting substances.  Research and early career  Mockeridge studied at Woolwich Polytechnic and King‚Äôs College, London where she graduated with first-class honours in both the Pass and Honours degrees (1909 and 1910 respectively). She was awarded the Carter Gold Medal of King‚Äôs College. In 1917 Mockeridge earned a doctor of science degree (D.Sc. London) for her research on nitrogen fixation by Azotobacter and on the auximones of natural manures. This research, conducted with Prof W. B. Bottomley, involved Mockeridge organising numerous trials using peat as a medium. During 1917-22 Mockeridge remained on the staff of King‚Äôs College as university lecturer and demonstrator in Botany. In a reference, Prof W. B Bottomley described Mockeridge as 'an admirable lecturer and her classes at King‚Äôs College are always very popular and well attended' and 'Not only is she a good teacher, but she is also a splendid disciplinarian, and has never had the slightest trouble with any of her classes of mixed men and women of all ages'.Letter by Prof W.

UNI/SU/AS/2/1/29a Richard Burton Archives, Swansea University Research she undertook during this period demonstrated the presence in natural manures of nucleic acid degradation products, including the purine bases, and examined their growth-promoting activities.  University College of Swansea  In 1922 Mockeridge took up a post as independent lecturer in Botany in charge of the Department of Biology at the newly established University College of Swansea (now Swansea University). At Swansea, over a period of thirty-two years, she built up the reputation of the honours degree in Botany and supervised work carried out by a succession of research students. This was achieved in circumstances that were far from ideal ‚Äì with a small staff, inadequate facilities and temporary accommodation. In 1936 she was elected first professor of Botany in the College. Shortly before she retired in 1954 her ambition to establish separate departments of Botany and Zoology with honours degrees in each was realised. She also planned facilities for the new Natural Sciences Building, aware that its use would be for her successors. Originally the Natural Sciences Building, now the Wallace Building. The Grade II listed building was constructed in two phases between 1953 and 1961 Her work at Swansea extended beyond the life sciences departments. She was Dean of the Faculty of Science during 1933-35 and again during 1941-43. During the years 1949-51 she was Vice-Principal of the University College. She was also, for many years, Treasurer of the Students‚Äô Representative Council. In 1935, she argued the case for a pay increase for L. Thomas, Laboratory Attendant: 'He is every bit as indispensable to my Department as are the chief laboratory attendants in other science departments of the College, while his wages compare unfavourably with those of most other attendants and also with those of some other College servants, who could be replaced more readily than he could.'Letter by Florence Mockeridge, 20th Feb 1935. UNI/SU/AS Richard Burton Archives, Swansea University Beyond the university, Mockeridge was a sought after lecturer throughout South Wales.

Appointed in 1993, Elisabeth has developed the archives from a one-person, limited service, to the first university archive in the UK, and the first in Wales, to attain Archives Service Accreditation. Elisabeth has been consulted by archivists and academics both nationally and internationally. She was a member and former chair (2005-2007) of Archives and Records Council Wales (ARCW) and has worked with Museums, Archives and Libraries Division, Welsh Government (MALD) on a number of collaborative projects. Elisabeth retired from Swansea University in 2017.  Education and early career  Elisabeth attended University College London and obtained a Diploma in Archive Studies in 1980. After qualifying, Elisabeth worked as Assistant Archivist in the West Devon Record Office, Plymouth and as Archivist in Charge of West Glamorgan Area Record Office, then a branch of Glamorgan Record Office in Swansea. The latter moved into purpose built accommodation in 1983 and Elisabeth was involved in setting up the service.  Development of Swansea University Archives  In 1993, Elisabeth joined the staff as part-time Library Archivist at Swansea University (then University College of Swansea) and later became University Archivist. Elisabeth succeeded first University Archivist David Bevan, who had been employed between 1965 and 1993. David had set a firm foundation for the Archives, particularly in organising and cataloguing the collections, which Elisabeth would go on to develop throughout her career. Elisabeth worked to establish a service that was run on professional lines and to establish standards that were widespread in other professionally run archive services. Along with colleagues in the University Library, Elisabeth established a supervised reading room, and introduced an Archives Collection Policy which provided a strategic and integrated approach to archive collections management. Elisabeth subscribed to the Historical Manuscripts Commission (HMC) ‚ÄòStandard for Record Repositories‚Äô, and worked with HMC and later the National Archives to develop the archive collections at Swansea University. In the 1990s Elisabeth began to work with academic departments to run teaching sessions and encouraged students and researchers to access the archive collections for their research. From the outset Elisabeth's priorities were to improve the physical conditions of storage of the archive collections and to gain accommodation that met BS5454:2000 standards (superseded by BS4971:2017). Elisabeth led the relocation of the University Archives to new accommodation in 2009. The new accommodation consisted of purpose built archival strong rooms, an isolation room, staff offices, reading room and reception area. For the first time in the University's history, the Archives had its own identifiable space which resulted in increased visibility and access to the service for students, staff and the general public. The project amounted to ¬£1.3 million from Higher Education for Wales (HEFCW) funds that had been received by Swansea University. Entrance to Richard Burton Archives, Swansea University The new accommodation gave the Archives the opportunity to develop its work with teaching and learning. In 2013 Professor Louise Miskell, Department of History introduced a module on the history of the Students' Union at Swansea University. The module was run from the Archives, and enabled students to access the archive collections of the University to research the history of the Students' Union. In recent years the University's archive collections have been widely used as part of modules, both within the College of Arts and Humanities and across academic departments, In 1998, Elisabeth was asked to undertake a project to organise the inventories of Swansea University's art collection. As well as operating a lending system for works of art, Elisabeth aimed to improve the preservation of the works within the collection. This has notably included the conservation of watercolour panels by Sarah Vivian, along with Sir Kyffin Williams' ‚ÄòSnowdon Snow, Penrhyn Ddu‚Äô and Percy Gleaves 'The Foundation Stone Ceremony, 19 July 1920‚Äô. In 2005 the archive collections of the actor Richard Burton were deposited to the University Archives by his widow, Sally Burton. In 2010 the service was renamed the Richard Burton Archives, Swansea University. In 2014 the Richard Burton Archives became the first university archive in the UK, and the first in Wales, to attain Archives Service Accreditation. This was a major achievement which demonstrated that the management of the archive collections, services to users and accommodation met externally validated professional standards. Elisabeth was invited to speak at the Houses of Parliament. In 2015 the Richard Burton Archives entered Swansea University's Research as Art competition with an image designed to change perceptions about archives. 'The Archives Treasure Hoard' was created in collaboration with Ian Vine and received a Highly Commended prize. The image has gone on to be used in promotional material within Swansea University and beyond, including the ARCW publication 'Into the Archives', and the National Archives 'Archives Unlocked' brochure. Throughout her time at Swansea University, Elisabeth has developed the preservation and access of the archive collections. This has included securing funding for the following:- * ‚ÄòReaping the Dividends‚Äô. A project to catalogue the records of the Co-operative Societies in South Wales, funding awarded by CyMAL (2007) * Conservation of the Registers of St David‚Äôs Priory Church, funding received from the National Manuscripts Conservation Trust (2008) * The conservation and digitisation of records created by the mining trade union, the South Wales Miners‚Äô Federation (2015)  Projects   Richard Burton Collection  In 2005 the archive collections of the actor Richard Burton were deposited to the University Archives by his widow, Sally Burton. The collection consists of press cuttings, photographs, and correspondence, and sheds further light on Burton's personal and professional life. Elisabeth arranged for conservation work to be carried out on the 1940 diary and film posters, and funding was secured by Chris West (Director of Library and Information Services, Swansea University, 1999-2010) for a project archivist to catalogue the collection in 2006/7. In 2012 Elisabeth enabled a member of the Archives team to transcribe the Burton diaries, and to provide advice on copyright in the Burton collection, for the publication of the Richard Burton Diaries, edited by Professor Chris Williams. The publication was a great success and brought worldwide publicity for Swansea University and the Archives. In 2015/16 Elisabeth worked with Eirwen Hopkins (College of Science Choice Project, Swansea University) on the application stage of the Richard Burton @14 project. Funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund Young Roots Programme, this project enabled students of Neath Port Talbot College to use the Burton diaries and other resources to uncover the social history of the town of Neath Port Talbot, and to see how different ‚Äì or not ‚Äì the issues facing a young Burton were from those experienced by today's local young people. This project grew out of Sally Burton's expressed desire at the time of deposit of the Richard Burton Collection to see it used to inspire young people by Richard Burton's example.  The South Wales Coalfield Collection  The South Wales Coalfield Collection provides a unique picture of life in the coalfield valleys during the late nineteenth and the twentieth centuries, concentrating on the workers and the organisations they created. It contains records of trade unions, miners' institutes, co-operative societies, and individuals connected with the mining community. Archival material (such as minute books, financial records, correspondence etc.) and photographs are held in the Richard Burton Archives, and published material, is held at the South Wales Miners' Library. Elisabeth was involved in the planning, bid writing and implementation of the following projects:- * In 1995/96 the University received ¬£70,000 from HEFCW to improve access to the South Wales Coalfield Collection by the provision of a comprehensive online catalogue. The project received a further ¬£5000 from the British Library Grant for Cataloguing and Preservation to catalogue the audio visual collections. * In 2002/03 the Coalfield Web Materials project was funded by the New Opportunities Fund (now Big Lottery) to digitise the photographic and audio visual material contained within the South Wales Coalfield Collection, and produce an educational resource. * In 2011 Swansea University received funding from the Wellcome Trust for the project 'Disability and Industrial Society, 1780-1948‚Äô, which explored how understandings and experiences of disability were affected by industrial development from the late eighteenth century until the end of the Second World War. Elisabeth sat on the Public Engagement Panel and provided expertise on how archives offer insights into the understanding of disability. Between 2008 and 2011, along with colleagues at Swansea University, Elisabeth visited Japan to discuss the preservation and cataloguing work of the South Wales Coalfield Collection, and to tour coalfield and heritage sites on the island of Hokkaido and in the Joban coalfield. The visits were funded by the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science and the Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation. Reciprocal visits were made by Japanese researchers for symposia in Swansea and Gregynog.  Metallurgical Industry Collections  Elisabeth has worked on a number of projects, and utilised the expertise of her team, to raise the profile and increase access to the metallurgical collections held at the Richard Burton Archives, particularly copper, tinplate and steel. These projects have included:- * Working with Copper. In 2010 the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) awarded Swansea University and its partners ¬£95,000 to raise awareness of the rich heritage of a once internationally famed Welsh copper industry * Between 2009 and 2012, Elisabeth made successful bids on behalf of ARCW for funding to the National Cataloguing Grants Scheme (NCGS) and MALD relating to cataloguing and promoting business archives across Wales. * From 2012 Elisabeth worked in collaboration with ARCW to increase knowledge and accessibility of steel archives and the history of the steel industry in Wales. This began with a scoping study of records at Tata Steel Record Centre in Shotton and archive services across Wales. This provided the evidence for a further successful application to NCGS for a project to catalogue steel records, Wales Showing Our Metal, and a complementary conservation project Forging Ahead, which was funded by National Manuscripts Conservation Trust (NMCT). * Sandfields: A Community Built on Steel led by West Glamorgan Archive Service and working with pupils of Sandfields Comprehensive School (2015) * Visions of Steel (2016)  References   External links  *The National Archives Archives Service Accreditation *Archives and Records Council Wales *Museums, Archives and Libraries Division, Welsh Government *West Devon Record Office *Historical Manuscripts Commission *Higher Education for Wales *Art UK - Percy Gleaves *Richard Burton Archives, Swansea University *Swansea University - Research as Art *Heritage Lottery Fund Young Roots Programme *South Wales Coalfield Collection *South Wales Miners' Library *Coalfield Web Materials *West Glamorgan Archive Service Living people Alumni of University College London British archivists Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Elisabeth Bennett"},{"id":"55372480","text":"Mary Williams (1883-1977) was a distinguished Welsh academic of modern languages. Known by her peers as a pioneer in the field of comparative medieval literature, more especially the origin and rise of the Arthurian Romances, she was awarded the Officier d‚ÄôAcademie and Chevalier de la Legion d‚ÄôHonneur by the French government in 1934.  Early life and education  Mary Williams was the elder daughter of Revd. John Williams and Mrs Jane Williams of Aberystwyth, Cardiganshire. She was the sister of Jennie Williams (Mrs R. Ruggles Gates) and was brought up in a Welsh Presbyterian household. Her great aunt joe died of cancer at the age of ten when she was only 3. Williams attended Aberystwyth Elementary School and then in 1895, at the age of twelve, was enrolled at Camden School for Girls and then the North London Collegiate School for Girls (Frances Mary Buss Foundation), having obtained the Platt Endowment Scholarship to study. She obtained a first-class certificate in the London Matriculation Examination in 1901.  Academic career and research  Williams attended University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, where she graduated with First Class Honours in French (1904) and German (1905). Following this, Williams spent two years (1905 to 1907) as a secondary school teacher in Portsmouth and Llandeilo. During this period, Williams studied towards and obtained an M.A.(Wales) by thesis on Wolfram von Eschenbach‚Äôs German epic poem \\"Parzival\\".Unpublished Registrar‚Äôs Correspondence (1921). UNI/SU/AS/2/1/28 Document B114. Richard Burton Archives, Swansea University. During 1907 - 1910 Mary Williams held a Research Fellowship in the University of Wales. This enabled her to undertake a period of study at the National University of Ireland at Dublin which contributed to the success of her research into the origin of the Arthurian Romances. At the same time, she enrolled at the Sorbonne where in 1910 she obtained a doctorate from the University of Paris, D.es l (D.Lit), producing a thesis dealing with the relation of the Welsh story of Peredur to the French and German versions. The work focused on the influence of Welsh literature and tradition on French Arthurian Romances. With an extensive knowledge of French, Welsh, Medieval Welsh, German language and Literature, this scholarship became her passion and shaped her lifelong career. * 1912-13 University of Manchester, Assistant Lecturer in French. * 1913-18 University of London, King‚Äôs College. Lecturer in French Language and Literature. * 1919-20 University of London, King‚Äôs College. Reader in French Language and Literature, Reader in Romance Philology, (Head of Department 1920). During the First World War, Mary Williams also held numerous responsibilities in addition to her full-time academic post at King's College. She taught French and German at London schools, delivered lectures for students reading for the new degree in Commerce in the University of London, and read with students preparing for the Honours B.Sc. degree in Economics and for the Diploma in Engineering. In 1915, the Academic Council of King's College recommended that she be appointed a Reader of the University, but, owing to delay caused by the war, the Readership was not conferred by the Senate until January 1919.Mary Williams (1883-1977), Dictionary of Welsh Biography. Retrieved 17 March 2018. In 1921 Williams was appointed to the newly created post of Professor of French Language and Literature in the Department of Modern Languages at University College Swansea, an early example of a woman achieving a professorial title. This was despite some opposition from established members of the College Council, in the face of gender inequality. In fact, one of her prominent contemporary supporters Victor Spiers said, \\"She possesses in an astonishing degree in the power of grasping detail, without losing the due sense of proportion - as women are apt to do - in fact hers is a man‚Äôs mind in the best sense of the word\\".Unpublished Registrar‚Äôs Correspondence Letter by Victor Spiers, (1921). UNI/SU/AS/2/1/28 Document B114. Richard Burton Archives, Swansea University. With Williams at the helm, modern language studies were able to thrive and grow into a separate German department in 1932. Williams continued to occupy the Chair of French until 1948. In 1948 Williams was appointed Professor of French and Acting Head of Department at the University of Durham, a post she held until her retirement in 1952. She subsequently moved to London for a short period, before returning to Aberystwyth. Until 1975 Williams continued her association with University College Swansea as a member of the Court of Governors. The expanding university named a Hall of Residence in her honour in 1967. Williams was a keen supporter of the National Library of Wales, depositing her research notes and papers in their archive. She died on 17 October 1977 in her ninety-fifth year.  Notable achievements  Her personal achievements included the award of Officier d‚ÄôAcademie and Chevalier de la Legion d‚ÄôHonneur. The investiture was held at the Hotel Metropole, Swansea in 1934 for promoting French language and literature to the Welsh nation. It was reported that Williams felt these were \\"not so much as being personal distinctions but rather as France‚Äôs tributes to Wales and to the Welsh contribution to our European cultural heritage\\". Mary Williams had initiated a novel student exchange programme with French Universities whilst at UCL. The intended purpose here was to enable students to pursue their studies in France for one or two terms before final examinations. Furthermore, as part of her engagement with the political and civic society of Swansea, along with her husband Dr. George Arbour Stephens, Williams organised the performance of annual French plays for the benefit of the people of Swansea. Her enthusiasm for her native country of Wales and its advancement and material prosperity contributed to the high esteem in which she was held by her colleagues and the wider community. Described by those who knew her as a great favourite, Williams \\"was a notable organiser who in a quiet and business-like way demonstrated sterling qualities and a zest for research\\". Her vitality, wit and sense of fun have been remarked upon by those who have written about her life, although she was known for being an exacting taskmaster to her students. * First President of University of London Welsh Society * President of the London Society of Old Aberystwythians * President of the Folklore Society 1961-1963 * Vice President of the Swansea Liberal Association * President and Founder of the South Wales Branch of the Modern Language Association  Legacy  There is an active Mary Williams Group at Swansea University whose members share good practice, support the University‚Äôs equality agenda and act as role models to individuals at the institution. The network hold regular seminars around the theme of gender equality in academia, inviting notable speakers from the UK and beyond. The group also host an annual Mary Williams Award. This is given to an individual associated with Swansea University who has made an outstanding contribution to the culture and community of the institution.

Life Elisa von Ahlefeldt was the only surviving child of Count Friedrich von Ahlefeldt- Laurvigen. She enjoyed an excellent education but had no happy childhood and youth. Domestic districts, mostly caused by the extravagance and excesses of the father, separated the parents' marriage. In 1806 she was morganatically married to the Danish Crown Prince Christian (later Christian VIII) and bore a daughter in 1807. This short, happy marriage, which had been concluded against the will of the father, was concealed, and the child kept away from Denmark. During a bathing trip to Bad Nenndorf with her mother, she met the Prussian officer Adolf von Lutzow, who was cured there of wounding from Freischar Ferdinand von Schills against Napoleon. On March 20, 1810, she married him without the hard-to-resist her father's resistance. The marriage was at first happy, as long as the love of fatherhood both combined into a common activity. When Lutzow built his freikorps in 1813, Elisa had a decisive part in it. She was enthusiastic about the advertising and equipment of the volunteers, accepted the reports in Breslau, and later devoted herself to the wounded. Theodor K√∂rner, Friedrich Friesen and Petersdorff belonged to their most loyal friends. She was a close friend of Friedrich Friesen, and in 1843 she played a decisive role in commemorating the fact that he had been solemnly buried at the Berlin Old Garrison Cemetery 29 years after his death. In the fighting, she remained close to the corps, helping, nurturing (especially her often wounded husband), sharing all the troubles. Love relationship with Immermann After the peace she lived in Berlin, Koenigsberg and M√ºnster (since 1817), where Lutzow stood in garrison. In 1822, she met the young Carl Leberecht Immermann (1796-1840). By means of common literary and artistic inclinations, a close love affair developed between them, which determined their life from the spring of 1822 onwards for more than 17 years. In 1824, Immermann was moved to Magdeburg to gain some distance. Elisa, however, separated from her husband, who had become a general, and moved to Dresden. 1825 her marriage with L√ºtzow was divorced; she refused to marry Immermann, but followed him first to Magdeburg, then to Duesseldorf, and led him to a common household in a country house, the Collenbach estate on the Ratinger Chaussee in the nearby Derendorf (today Pempelfort ), [ 1] where she visited her ex-husband General von Lutzow in May 1829 to sue her suffering for his new but unfortunate marriage with Auguste Uebel. [2] From 1831 onwards - with the permission of the Danish King - she returned her birth name. From 1827 to 1839, she supported Immermann's literary work after the beginnings of a joint translation of Walter Scott's \\" Ivanhoe \\" in M√ºnster. It had a great influence on Immermann's poetical activity and gained great influence on his poetical work. After Immermann's engagement with Marianne Niemeyer (1838), she left D√ºsseldorf and finally parted with him in August 1839. At the beginning of 1840 she went to Berlin, where she lived first with her friend Johanna Dieffenbach, devoted herself to her new and old circle of friends and stayed with his wife and daughter even after Immermann's early death. A long suffering ended her life.  Salon  Her salon in Berlin existed from 1840 to 1855, and was also known as \\"Sundays\\". This was from 1840 to 1846 first in the Potsdamer Chaussee 38, from 1846 then in the Schulgartenstra√üe 1a (today's Ebertstra√üe) and in the 1850s in the Dessauer street 7. This salon was visited by former members of L√ºtzow's Freikorps and other family members of the divorced husband's family, to which she was still connected after her divorce. It was also common to communicate with other salons. Elisa Gr√§fin von Ahlefeld got in contact with those of Ludmilla Assing, Clara Mundt-M√ºhlbach, and Fanny Lewald and they visited each other.

An undullating hilly landscape in Varberg Municipality, Halland. The Sub-Mesozoic hilly peneplains or Sub-Mesozoic hilly relief is a landscape in Scandinavia made up of undulating hills and joint valleys and occasional kaolinized bedrock in valley bottoms. The landscape formed in the Mesozoic Era and was eventually drowned by the sea during the Campanian transgression and covered by a thick cover of Cretaceous sedimentary rocks. Later erosion of the cover rocks partly re-exposed this landscape. During the Quaternary epoch the re- exposed Mesozoic hilly relief escaped major glacier erosion being only surficially scoured in parts. The Sub-Mesozoic hilly relief formed starting from a peneplain formed in the Permian and Triassic. Remnants of this peneplain can be traced as a tilted summit accordance in the Swedish West Coast. This would indicated that Paleozoic strata that covered much of Fennoscandia elsewhere had been locally uplifted and eroded prior to the formation of the Sub-Mesozoic hilly relief. The Sub-Mesozoic hilly peneplains covers a contiguous zone along western and southern rims of the South Swedish Dome. This zone includes most of Bohusl√§n, Halland and Blekinge as well as parts of V√§sterg√∂tland and Scania. In parts this surface and unconformity makes up an undullating hilly relief, while in other locations like Blekinge and northern Halland it is an joint valley landscape.

It was still in Reggio Emilia in the 1580s, in the collection of Rodolfo Signoretti, where it was studied by Lelio Orsi (who copied from it in Christ among the crosses), Titian, Lomazzo, El Greco and Annibale Carracci. A 1582 source reported that \\"news [of the work had circulated] in Spain and in Rome\\" and that Philip II of Spain and Alfonso II d'Este had both tried in vain to buy it. The Milanese nobleman Pirro Visconti succeeded in buying it around 1587 and brought it to his villa at Lainate in Milan, where it found favour as part of the deeply religious era of St Charles Borromeo, who kept a copy of it in the room where he died. It was also copied by Giulio Campi in a painting now in the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana. From the house of Visconti it passed to the Marquis of Caracena before being taken to Spain by the end of the 17th century - there it was admired by Anton Raphael Mengs before being acquired by the Duke of Wellington during the Peninsular War.

She was known for her peace activism in Swansea, where she lost her job over her pacifism. Her account is told in the Swansea Conchie Controversy (1988). Later, she moved to Bristol, where she continued her activism. She also continued to teach until she was nearly 70 and worked in the church. She continued to campaign for human rights until her death.  Biography  The daughter of Sidney Bevan DCM (1878‚Äì1935) and Emily Sarah Bevan (n√©e Hemming, 1878‚Äì1974), Rosalind grew up in Swansea and was educated at Swansea High School for Girls. Her family were Baptists. As a teenager, Rosalind, who defined herself as a socialist and Christian-pacifist before even leaving the school, was influenced by the Reverend Howard Ingli James, pacifist minister at Pantygwydr Baptist Church (1923‚Äì31). Thanks to a state scholarship, she studied at Cambridge University, where she achieved a first class in classics in 1938. She then went on taking a DipEd with distinction at Oxford University. Rusbrige returned to Swansea in September 1939 to start as classics mistress at Glanmor Girls' School, where she became more and more involved in the peace movement. Before World War II, she formed a pacifist group, did public speaking about pacifism and also sold Peace News from a rented stall at the Swansea market. She also was one of the first women to become a member of the Peace Pledge Union (PPU). After the Allies started having trouble with the war, a strong anti-pacifist sentiment rose up in Swansea and other areas of the country. Her stall at the Swansea market was threatened with \\"a nasty incident,\\" and later, the council closed and locked her stall so she could not access it. In June 1940 Swansea Council resolved to suspend employees who were pacifists or who opposed the war. Employees were asked to sign a Declaration of Allegiance in support of war. Rusbridge refused to sign, and she was left without a job. Later, the council rescinded the suspension, but Rusbridge was already teaching at Chester Boys' Grammar School, and refused to come back to Swansea. She met her husband, Ewart Rusbridge, in Chester and they married in 1942. In 1948 they moved to Bristol. She continued to teach, most often at Clifton High School for Girls, and worked until she was nearly 70. She continued to be active in human rights and peace activism. She was a representative for the southwest at the national body of the Christian Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CCND), protested at United States bases at Aldermaston and Greenham Common, was active in the Baptist church and once ran in a Parliamentary election. She died of cancer in 2004 and was remembered at Horfield Baptist Church in Bristol before her body was cremated. Her memories of the Swansea anti-pacifist campaign were recorded in the Swansea Conchie Controversy (1988) and in Parachutes and Petticoats (1992).

The law concerned the distribution of land to poor Romans and to Marius' veterans. According to Appian, this was to be provided from land that had been seized by the Cimbri in northern Italy and according to other ancient writers it was to be achieved by founding new Roman colonies outside Italy (see below). Saturninus was an ally of Gaius Marius. According Pseudo-Aurelius Victor \\"to win the favour with the soldiers of Marius, [he] carried a law assigning veterans a 100 iugera [125 acres, 311.5 hectares] of land in Africa\\" during his first tribunate in 103 BC. He helped Marius to be elected to his fourth consulship in 102 BC.  The provisions of the lex Appuleia Agraria According to Appian, the law provided for the distribution of land which had been seized by the invading Cimbri in Cisalpine Gaul and who had been defeated by Gaius Marius at the Battle of Vercellae in 101 BC. This was to be allocated to poor citizens, especially Marius' veterans. According to Pseudo-Aurelius Victor, Saturninus sent colonists to the Roman provinces Sicily, Achaea and Macedonia.Pseudo-Aurelius Victor, De viris illustribus urbis Romae, 73.5 Velleius Paterculus stated that the colony of Epodeia was founded in north- western Italy by Marius during his sixth consulship (100 BC). Lucius Annaeus Seneca and Pliny the Elder wrote that Marius founded a colony in Corsica. Pliny added that its name was Mariana.The two writers did not specify when this occurred, but it is likely that this was also a result of the law.L. Annaeus Seneca, The Dialogues 17.5 Appian wrote that the law assigned the larger share to the Italian allies.Appian, The Civil Wars, 1.29 Presumably these were to be mainly allied veterans who had served under Marius. The law provided that Marius should have authority to make three Roman citizens in every colony. Another provision required that the senators should take an oath to obey the law within five days and anyone who refused to do so should be expelled from the Senate and pay a fine of twenty talents for the benefit of the people.Appian, The civil Wars, 1.4.29 Political conflict The provision that the Italian allies were to be assigned the larger share of the land angered Rome's urban poor, who caused a disturbance at the meeting of the assembly which was to vote on the bill in an attempt to prevent the passage of the law. Saturninus had called in people from the rural districts, many of whom were Marius' veterans, to support him. They dispersed the urban people with clubs. The latter claimed that a thunder was heard during the assembly. According to Roman tradition, this was a bad omen which would require the business of the day to be brought to a close. Saturninus ignored this.Appian, The civil Wars, 1.31 Marius wanted to use the provision regarding the oath against Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus, his enemy. He declared that he would not take the oath. Metellus agreed and the other senators approved. On the fifth day Marius hastily convoked the senate late in the day. He claimed that he was afraid of the reaction of the people if they did not take the oath and proposed a stratagem. He said if they took the oath to obey the law insofar at it was a law, the country people would disperse. Afterwards they could show that this law was not really a law because it had been enacted by violence and after thunder had been reported. While the senators were confused and silent, Marius took quick action before they had time to think. He gave his oath publicly. The other senators followed suit, fearing for their safety. However, Metellus refused. The next day Apuleius' officers tried to drag him out of the senate-house, but the other tribunes defended him. The country people were brought back into town. They were told that the law would not be executed unless Metellus was banished and that they would not get their land. A banishment decree was proposed. On ratification day the urban people carried knives and escorted Metellus to protect him. Metellus decided to leave the city rather than risk a conflict because of him. Apuleius had the decree ratified.Appian, The civil Wars, 1.31-32 Later in the same year, Saturninus got into political trouble and was lynched by an angry crowd. The senate and the people called for the recall of Metellus. Publius Furius, another plebeian tribune, opposed this. However, he, too, was lynched and Metellus was allowed to return.Appian, The civil Wars, 1.31-33 See also *Agrarian law *Gaius Marius *List of Roman laws *Plebeian tribune *Roman Law Notes References : Primary sources * Appian, The Civil Wars, Penguin Classics; New Ed edition, 1996; * Aurelius Victor.

History Joseph Mellor, his wife Mary n√©e Fox, and son Thomas Fox Mellor arrived in South Australia aboard Fairlie (often spelled Fairleigh) in July 1840. :Also on board were his parents Thomas Mellor, his wife Margaret n√©e Thornton, their unmarried daughters Mary and Delia and married daughters Elizabeth Walker and Nancy Turner with their husbands and young families. The Mellors were to have three more sons, two of whom would figure prominently in the company's development. Joseph Mellor set himself up in business in Morphett Street as a carpenter and wheelwright, and was soon employing around five men and advertising manufacture of drays, wheelbarrows, harrows and other simple farming implements. By 1857 he was employing over fifty and had a second factory on Town Acre 246, Franklin Street adjacent to the original one on Town Acre 245 on the north-west corner of Morphett and Franklin streets. By 1859 he had 100 men and had agents in Melbourne, Wahgunyah and Beechworth in Victoria, and Goolwa in South Australia. At the 1862 International Exhibition his reaping and harvesting machine won a medal, and was later sold to Russia. At the Grand General Show, held in conjunction with the Royal Visit of 1867, Mellor won a good number of prizes. Mellor was a member of the Agricultural and Horticultural Society. 1855‚Äì1862 In 1863 he purchased an block of land south of the railway line at Kapunda and opened a factory at the corner of Carrington and Cambria streets, with around 15 men under the supervision of his son James F. Mellor, Survey of Kapunda farm implement workshops. which in 1864 produced 110 reaping machines. Mellor Bros. In 1869 Joseph Mellor relinquished control of the Franklin Street Machine and Wheel Works in favour of his two elder sons, Thomas Fox Mellor and James Fox Mellor, who were joined at some later stage by Benjamin Fox Mellor. Thomas, who was little interested in engineering, served as manager for a time, then left to pursue a business career. In June 1873 Mellor Brothers was the first in South Australia to adopt the eight-hour day principle for their workers. James F. Mellor resided at Kapunda, and supervised that factory. In 1876 they erected a facility in Jamestown with some workshop facilities, managed by one J. W. Stephens. Agricultural machines fabricated in Kapunda were carried by road to Jamestown as it was cheaper than by rail, but at the cost of at least one life. They set up another facility opposite the railway station in Quorn in 1880. The partnership between T. F., J. F., and B. F. Mellor was dissolved 5 January 1878, but the business continued to operate under James' and Benjamin's joint ownership. The company appointed agencies in Victoria, and in 1885 B. F. Mellor and his family moved to Ballarat, Victoria Interesting details on stump-jump patents. to oversee interstate distribution. In 1888 arrangements were made for McCalman, Garde, & Co. of North Melbourne to manufacture Mellor patent ploughs and scarifiers under licence. J. F. and B. F. Mellor founded a factory at Braybrook Junction, close to Melbourne, cheap coal, bluestone quarries and railway facilities, and near the site of a successful demonstration of their stump-jump plough. The Braybrook Implement Works would later be taken over by H. V. McKay to become the giant Sunshine Harvester Works. J. F. and B. F. Mellor also founded the Meadowbank Implement Works at Meadowbank, New South Wales. In 1892 Benjamin F. Mellor sold up his personal property and settled in Moonee Ponds, Victoria. Mellor Brothers Cooperative Limited (from 1892 Mellors Cooperative Company Ltd.) was founded 1890 to take over the assets of Mellor Brothers, and shares were sold, principally to farmers and employees. James F. Mellor was appointed chairman of directors. The Kapunda, Jamestown and Quorn assets were transferred to the new company in July 1891, and new depots established at Terowie and Hawker later that same year. Orroroo followed, then Nairne in 1893. In 1893 a severe recession hit South Australia, coinciding with several bank failures. The company responded by putting employees on half time. In 1894, in the face of continuing losses and mounting bad debts, the company compulsorily acquired shares held by James and Benjamin Mellor, wrote down the asset value of goodwill and patent rights and filed for voluntary liquidation. The disposal of assets was handled by the firm of Bagot, Shakes and Lewis. Swan song of Mellor Brothers Advertisement for Mellor plough 1914. Note unusual (for Australia) spelling. James Fox Mellor returned to the factory at 178 Franklin Street and continued to manufacture replacement parts for the old company's products, The enigmatic title refers to strippers that are sufficiently light to be drawn by a pony or bicycle. and to develop improved designs. :Details are hard to find, but it is likely that he purchased much of the old machinery and perhaps one of the old factories at the sort of prices that prevail in hard economic times. His motivations for reopening the old factory are also open to speculation. Driven by pride perhaps; boredom and no other employment maybe; or perhaps providing meaningful employment for the coming generation, something he believed in. Mellor patented a \\"clockspring\\" stump-jumping plough which was well received by the once-again prosperous farming sector, no doubt to the benefit of Mellor and his staff, which now included his two sons. With the advent of petrol- driven tractors, much larger \\"clockspring\\" ploughs became practical. Interesting photograph. J. F. Mellor died in 1914, and the factory appears to have closed without public explanation or notice. His son A. N. Mellor advertised sale of spare parts from his North Adelaide home The brothers The sons of Joseph Mellor may have been educated at J. L. Young's Adelaide Educational Institution, but if so none was mentioned in any of the school's prizegiving ceremonies. Thomas Fox Mellor (1836 ‚Äì 24 December 1898) was born in Rastrick, Yorkshire and came to South Australia with his parents as a four- year-old child. Unlike his brothers he had no inclination to things mechanical, and after assisting his father with management duties, severed his connection with the business and settled down to work as a land and estate agent, becoming a member of the Adelaide Stock Exchange. He was an avid draughts player, member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and prominent member of the Semaphore Baptist Church. He died at his residence, Paxton Street, Semaphore. The funeral took place on Christmas Day, and his remains were interred in the West Terrace Cemetery. James Fox Mellor (1841 ‚Äì 6 April 1914) was born in Adelaide in 1841, and joined his father's business on leaving school. In 1864 he proceeded to Kapunda to manage the factory there, and he lived there 23 years. He was a prominent citizen of the town, and was mayor for three years, and was particularly well known amongst the farming community. He and his brother Benjamin F. Mellor founded the Meadowbank Implement Works in Sydney, and the Braybrook Implement Works at Sunshine, Victoria. He married a daughter of Thomas Neill, accountant for the South Australian Company. He was a prominent member of the Tynte Street Baptist Church, North Adelaide. He died at his residence. Molesworth Street, North Adelaide. After the Mellor Bros. expansion, conversion to a co-operative and collapse, he re-established a similar business under the old name, which ran successfully until a few years before his death. Benjamin Fox Mellor (1843 ‚Äì 5 March 1916) was born in Adelaide, and from a young age showed an interest in farming, and applied that knowledge to design and construction of reaping and winnowing machines and other agricultural implements. He took a great interest in religion, and was a member of the Bentham Street Baptist Church in the early days, and later of the Flinders Street Church. He and his family moved to Victoria to manage an implement factory at Braybrook, and retired to live at Moonee Ponds. He married the only daughter of Robert Dawson, of Dublin, South Australia. He died at Newlyn, Victoria while visiting a daughter. John Fox Mellor (22 February 1845 ‚Äì 4 May 1913) was born in Adelaide and learned the trade of an ironmoulder, but left the business for farming. He secured a property at The Reedbeds, where he lived for 41 years. He was vitally interested in education and for 31 years was a member of the Thebarton School Board of Advice (i.e. School Council). The extensive grounds of the Thebarton School were named \\"The Mellor Playgrounds\\" in his honour. He was a driving force behind the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, a longtime member of the Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society and the Field Naturalists Society. He did much good work for the Home for Incurables at Fullarton. He was prominently connected the Adelaide Philharmonic Society and was honorary organist to several churches, including the Flinders Street Baptist Church. He was closely associated with the 1893 South Australian tour of the eminent English organist W. H. Jude, and in 1895 was helped found the Jude Benevolent Search Party, a charitable organisation named in his honour. For many years he attended various churches in the Henley Beach area: Methodist, Baptist, Congregational, and Church of Christ. He was a longtime member of the Y.M.C.A. and the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and the Voluntary Militia. He was a member of the Henley Beach branch of the Liberal Union. He died at his home, \\"Holmfirth\\" in Fulham. Note on Mellor Park There have been two quite separate Adelaide suburbs named \\"Mellor Park\\": one, now part of Semaphore Park, subdivided by Thomas F. Mellor in 1879, and the other now part of Lockleys subdivided by John White Mellor (son of John F. Mellor) in 1920.

Founded in 1887, it is one of a small number of camp meetings surviving from the 19th century in the state, and the only surviving one run by Adventists. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. Description and history The Advent Camp Meeting Ground is located in the village of Wilder, on of land between Mount Olivet Cemetery, and the tracks formerly of the Boston and Maine Railroad (B&M;) that parallel the Connecticut River. Prior to its acquisition by the Advent Camp Meeting in 1887, it was part of the large landholdings of Orren Taft. It was not the first Adventist camp to be established in Vermont; one in Bethel was founded in 1868. That same year, the Adventist Christian Conference was organized, and also held a camp meeting in White River Junction. In 1886 members of the Bethel camp meeting split from that group, seeking to establish a permanent meeting ground near White River Junction. They acquired the land from Orren Taft in August 1887, and had a tabernacle tent and residence cabins built. The site's proximity to the B&M; railroad line brought significant numbers of attendees over the next several decades, aided by the construction of a siding platform. A major fire in 1895 destroyed most of the early structures on the grounds, and resulted in the present-day wider spacing of buildings on the wooded grounds. The camp meeting's attendance declined beginning in the 1920s, but it has remained in continuous operation, with events every summer. The buildings of the camp are organized around a central tabernacle, a single- story frame building with a shallow-pitch gabled roof. Its sides consist of removable wall sections covered with asphalt shingling, which are removed when the camp is in session to provide an open-air experience. Institutional buildings on the grounds include a kitchen/dining room, classroom buildings, and physical plant support. Residential buildings include two dormitories for group housing, and a large number of cabins. Some of the cabins are privately owned; all are of relatively modest proportions and styling.

Early life Fanny Chambers Gooch was born in 1842 in Hillsboro, Mississippi, although she spent most of her life in Texas. She was the eighth of thirteen children. Career Through her book Face to Face with the Mexicans (New York, 1888), she became famous. The story of the inception, growth, publication and success of this book gave an insight into the character of its author, and is at the same time an interesting illustration of the changed conditions of the modern American woman's life. Gooch moved with her family to the city of Saltillo, Mexico. She went to Mexico almost entirely ignorant of the domestic manners of that country, and set up her home among them, expecting to order her household affairs after the same comfortable fashion which made her home in Austin, Texas. The story of the disillusionment told in the opening chapters of her book is exquisitely ludicrous. After a determined effort to force the immovable Mexican customs, she found herself compelled to yield to the inevitable. She might be compelled to do without a cooking-stove and to forego the delights of attending to her own marketing and shopping, but her genial soul demanded that, if foiled in her domestic plans, she would at least refuse to be shut out from social intercourse with the people among whom she found herself. Returning after some years to her former home in Austin, her descriptions of her Mexican experiences so entertained her friends that she was asked to prepare a series of articles on the subject for a Texas newspaper. She decided to publish her work in book form. She returned to Mexico, where she spent some time in its principal cities, mingling with its people in every station. She went to New York and superintended the publication of the work. The book at once attracted the notice of the leading reviewers and became very successful. She is also the author of The Boy Captive of the Texas Mier Expedition, The Tradition of Guadalupe and Christmas in Old Mexico and Christmas in Old Mexico. The Quarterly of the Texas State Historical Association wrote that Christmas in Old Mexico was an \\"interesting and instructive booklet.\\" In 1911, Volume 80, Part 2 of The Publishers Weekly wrote of The Boy Captive of the Texas Mier Expedition, \\"The author [Gooch] is an enthusiastic and competent student of the history of Texas and Mexico. She has passed laborious years in the independent investigation of some of the most romantic and significant events in Texas history, and has gathered in her MS. dealings with the Mier expedition, much interesting and original material and has presented this material in her book. The story deals with the life of a real boy. John C. C. Hill, who at the age of thirteen lived through these experiences.\\" She also contributed one chapter of Mexican recipes (such as tamal de cazuela) to the book Austin's First Cookbook (1891). A total of 89 women contributed the 300 recipes, and Gooch was one of the only ones known to have worked outside her home. Her work is also excerpted in the 2005 book Mexico Otherwise: Modern Mexico in the Eyes of Foreign Observer. Personal life The year following the publication of Face to Face with the Mexicans, Gooch married Dr. D. T. Iglehart, of Austin. She died in 1913.

His father was Count of Blois and of Chartres as Theobald IV from 1102; and Count of Champagne and of Brie as Theobald II from 1125. He was a skilled administrator of his territories, who had at least ten surviving children by his wife, Matilda of Carinthia, daughter of Engelbert, Duke of Carinthia. In addition he had Hugh, of an unknown woman. His birth in any case made Hugh a half-brother of Count Henry I of Champagne who was married to Marie, elder daughter of King Louis VII of France. Hugh's half-sister was Adela, Queen of France, the consort of Louis VII, mother of King Philip II of France and of the later Empress of Byzantium, Agnes. Hugh was also half- brother to Cardinal William, Archbishop of Sens and then of Rheims and the first cousin of Henry de Sully, Abbot of F√©camp. More importantly, he was also a nephew of King Stephen of England and of the King‚Äôs brother Henry of Blois of Blois, Bishop of Winchester.Cf. genealogical scheme in Ruth Harwood Cline, Abbot Hugh: An Overlooked Brother of Henry I, Count of Champagne, in Catholic Historical Review 93:3 (2007) 505.

She was appointed as the first Chair of Medical Humanities at Swansea University in 2003, a position she held until her death in 2014. Her academic work explored the history of medical institutions and, later, the role of disabled people in the coal industry in south Wales. Borsay was described by a colleague as 'a pioneer of disability history, contributing a huge wealth of ideas and studies to what is now a flourishing field of history. Her work looked at changes in social, cultural and political attitudes towards disability, bringing out the importance of recording the often-ignored place of disabled people within history.'.  Education  Borsay studied at the University of Wales, Swansea and graduated in 1976 with a first class honours degree in Social Administration and Politics. She later gained a Master of Letters after studying at Oxford University, and subsequently (in 1999) a PhD at the University of Wales.  Career  Between 1978 and 2002 Borsay worked as a Lecturer, then Senior Lecturer and Reader at the University of Wales Lampeter. She then returned to Swansea University, where she had studied for her undergraduate degree, to take up a chair in Healthcare and Medical Humanities. She held this post until her death in 2014. Borsay was one of the founders of Swansea‚Äôs Research Group for Health, History and Culture, which brought together scholars in Arts and Humanities, Medicine and Health Sciences to advance research in Medical Humanities. Borsay sat on the editorial board of the journal Disability and Society and was a member of the Wellcome Trust's Medical History and Humanities Funding Committee.  Publications  Her thesis 'Patrons and governors: aspects of the social history of the Bath infirmary, c. 1739-1830' formed the basis of her book Medicine and Charity in Georgian Bath (1999), described as an 'exhaustive' study of Bath General Infirmary which 'shone light onto the social structures of voluntary hospitals'. Borsay wrote Disability and Social Policy in Britain since 1750: a History of Exclusion, an expansive exploration of the lives of disabled people in Britain. The book was largely well received although its lack of primary sources was noted as a weakness. She also wrote numerous single and co- authored articles and chapters on the history of hospitals and nursing, including editing the collection Nursing and Midwifery in Britain since 1700 (2012) with Billie Hunter.  Personal life  Anne Borsay, n√©e Howard, was born in Norwich, UK, on 20 October 1954 and died on 25 August 2014. She was married to Peter in 1980, with whom she had two daughters, Clare and Sarah.

See also CƒÉlinescu, p. 9; Gane, p. 238; Theodorescu, p. 44 (1596 or 1598 ‚Äì ca. 1658), was a Wallachian scholar, poet, and statesman, the brother-in-law of Prince Matei Basarab through his sister Elena NƒÉsturel. Together, the three staged a cultural revival centered on Bucharest and T√¢rgovi»ôte. NƒÉsturel had risen through the ranks of Wallachian bureaucracy and had served Radu Mihnea's government in Moldavia, being kept as Logothete by Matei Basarab. In office, he had an international correspondence and went on diplomatic travels through Central Europe, while also overseeing the printing presses. He was the titular boyar of HerƒÉ»ôti, known in his day as Fiere»ôti and FierƒÉ»ôti, where he built a palace that stands as a late example of Renaissance architecture, and earned him a regional fame. NƒÉsturel was primarily an advocate of Old Church Slavonic, the courtly language. He was one of its last exponents in Romanian literature, and taught it to students at the school in T√¢rgovi»ôte. His favorite forms of expression were the essay and the rhyming preface, but he also perfected a Slavonic answer to the blason, which remained influential for two centuries and was, by some accounts, the first known poem by a Romanian. NƒÉsturel, who made mention of the people's Latin origin, also used the Romanian vernacular, in which he notably produced a translation of Barlaam and Josaphat. In his original works, his themes and his linguistic obscurities show a Baroque streak, while his core ideology has been linked to Renaissance humanism. An Eastern Orthodox theologian and a ktitor within the Wallachian Metropolis, he was nevertheless attracted to Counter-Reformation ideas, and published Catholic-inspired propaganda against Calvinism. NƒÉsturel was versed in both Renaissance Latin and classical scholarship, putting out a Slavonic rendition of The Imitation of Christ. Udri»ôte's first-born, Mateia»ô, was adopted by the princely couple and groomed as heir to the throne, but died in 1652, before reaching maturity. This event inspired the Logothete to write his last poem, a conventional epitaph. His sister died in 1653, and his brother- in-law a year later. NƒÉsturel survived the rise of Constantin »òerban, being for a while reappointed as Spatharios, although he was cousins with the rebel leader Hrizea. A new Prince, Mihnea III, identified NƒÉsturel as one of the boyars standing in the way of his political projects, and included him in his murderous purge. The Spatharios was strangled at Curtea Veche, and his body was desecrated in the streets of Bucharest. He was survived by another son, Radu Toma, who held major political offices under George Ducas. His direct line of descent was maintained until the 1874 death of Constantin NƒÉsturel- Herescu. Biography Origins Despite its claim to have originated in Roman DaciaGane, p. 235; Papazoglu & Speteanu, pp. XIV, 43, 225, 252 and its alleged links to the Fogoras nobility,Sorin Iftimi, Vechile blazoane vorbesc. Obiecte armoriate din colec»õii ie»ôene, pp. 191‚Äì192. Ia»ôi: Palatul Culturii, 2014. the NƒÉsturel clan was first attested as belonging to boyardom in the late 15th century. A period document by \\"Vlad VodƒÉ\\", brother of Radu the Great, confirms that, by 1501, the NƒÉsturels were long established as the owners of HerƒÉ»ôti (traditionally in Ilfov County,Gane, p. 235 now in Giurgiu) and other Wallachian villages. The same document suggests that VrƒÉjoghie, the family patriarch, was \\"of My Highness' own house\\", namely the House of Basarab. A 19th-century author, Dimitrie Papazoglu, also argued that the family had a deep connection to the village, and later capital city, of Bucharest, suggesting that they were builders on an ancient church in Dobroteasa mahala. He also proposed that HerƒÉ»ôti took its name from a family patriarch, \\"Count\\" Herea NƒÉsturel.Papazoglu & Speteanu, pp. 11‚Äì13, 43, 226, 229‚Äì230, 252 The genealogical link with the ruling princes was in any case enhanced ca. 1600, when Udri»ôte's father, the Postelnic and Logothete Radu NƒÉsturel, married Despina, a cousin or niece of Michael the Brave. According to researcher Constantin Gane, Despina, known as Cala in some sources,TƒÉnƒÉsescu, p. 183 may have been the daughter of boyar Radu Calomfirescu.Gane, p. 235. See also Nicolescu, p. 35 Udri»ôte was probably born in 1596, although other sources also propose 1598.Nicolescu, p. 35 It is also believed that he was a native of HerƒÉ»ôti, which he once described as \\"my parental village\\".Theodorescu, p. 43, p. 45 Radu and Despina had two other sons, »òerban and Cazan, both of whom were probably older than Udri»ôte.Gane, p. 236; Nicolescu, p. 35; Stoicescu, p. 214 His first name, Udri»ôte, is an archaic, now obscure, derivative from \\"Adrian\\". NƒÉsturel, like other scholars, mistakenly believed that it was from \\"Uriel\\" and akin to \\"Orestes\\", sometimes signing himself as Uri(i)l, Orest, or Ioriste.Constantinescu, pp. 4, 123, 165 His family name originates with nasture (\\"button\\"); he sometimes used the variant NƒÉsturelovici, with a Slavic suffix, as the fashion among intellectual boyars.Constantinescu, pp. XXI, LIII »òerban, Cazan, and Udri»ôte also had two sisters. One was the future Stanca Popescu.Panaitescu, p. 242 The other, known to have been Udri»ôte's junior, was Elena (Eliana) NƒÉsturel. According to Gane, she and Udri»ôte were the most educated of Radu's children, being taught to read and write in Church Slavonic and Koine Greek, and being introduced to art and history.Gane, p. 236 Their father also displayed an interest in Renaissance literature; he had confiscated or bought a copy of Thomas √† Kempis' The Imitation of Christ, in the Latin, while fighting a war in Moldavia.Nicolescu, p. 35; Theodorescu, p. 45 Helped by a private tutor, Udri»ôte used that same book to learn Latin, which he could speak to perfection.Nicolescu, pp. 35‚Äì36; TƒÉnƒÉsescu, p. 183 In addition to Latin, Slavonic and Greek, Udri»ôte was fluent in Russian.Nicolescu, p. 36 Some authors have suggested that NƒÉsturel also attended school in Kiev Voivodeship, but this is not attested by any contemporary source.Nicolescu, pp. 35‚Äì36 Debut By 1618, Udri»ôte had joined the Wallachian bureaucracy, being attested, alongside his brother »òerban, as a scribe (diac) to the court of Prince Radu Mihnea.Stoicescu, pp. 214, 215 When the latter took over as Prince of Moldavia, NƒÉsturel followed, and, in 1625, was attested as a scribe for the court in H√¢rlƒÉu.Stoicescu, p. 215 Returning to Bucharest, he maintained this function under successive reigns, including that of Alexandru IV Ilia»ô.Nicolescu, p. 36; Stoicescu, p. 215; TƒÉnƒÉsescu, p. 183 In 1629, Leon Tom»ôa promoted him to Logothete of his privy council. Also that year, NƒÉsturel published the first of his many Slavonic prefaces, for a Nomocanon edition printed at Kiev.Nicolescu, p. 37 According to historian George Potra, he was the official translator for Prince Radu Ilia»ô when, in early 1632, Bucharest was visited by Paul Strassburg, diplomat of the Swedish Empire.Potra, p. 101 From 1625, NƒÉsturel had been married to Maria Corbeanu, of the Corbi boyars.Gane, p. 239; Nicolescu, p. 35; Stoicescu, p. 215 He was also brother- in-law of another Logothete, Radu Staico Popescu.Stoicescu, pp. 229‚Äì230 At age 35, his other sister, Elena, became Wallachia's Princess-consort. As a teenager (most likely in 1613),Andreescu, pp. 27‚Äì28 she had married Aga Matei, later styled \\"Matei Basarab\\", who controlled an army of Seimeni mercenaries in Bucharest. In late 1632, at age 53, Matei defeated Radu Ilia»ô and took the throne for himself.Andreescu, pp. 27‚Äì32; Gane, pp. 232‚Äì237. See also Filipescu, pp. 116‚Äì118; Papazoglu & Speteanu, pp. 43‚Äì48; Stoicescu, pp. 208‚Äì209; Theodorescu, p. 12 Elena played a direct part in Wallachia's administration shortly after this‚Äînamely, during the interval when Matei negotiated his confirmation by Wallachia's suzerain power, the Ottoman Empire.Gane, pp. 235‚Äì237. See also Nicolescu, p. 35 Udri»ôte's father, Radu, served as the country's treasurer (Vistier) during the same hiatus.Stoicescu, p. 214 Matei Basarab and Elena NƒÉsturel in a period manuscript After Matei secured his throne in 1633, Elena turned to cultural endeavors, one of the principal sponsors and promoters of early Romanian literature.Gane, pp. 236‚Äì239 Udri»ôte, a Logethete of the court in 1632,Nicolescu, p. 36; TƒÉnƒÉsescu, p. 183 partook directly in her experiment. He is for instance credited with having helped the princely couple set up three printing presses, at C√¢mpulung, Dealu Monastery, and BƒÉile Govora. As Logothete, he directed the Chancellery, which issued some 1,300 documents during his tenure, all of them surviving. His correspondence attests links with intellectuals of various faiths: the Orthodox Gavrilo Rajiƒá, Macarios Zaim, Peter Mogila, and Meletios Sirigos; and the Catholic Rafael Levakoviƒá, with whom he discussed the Nicene Creed. He also had oratorical duels with Constantin Cantacuzino, with bishops Varlaam Mo»õoc and »òtefan I, as well as with his sister the Princess. In 1635, NƒÉsturel published a Slavonic ode to the Basarab family, included in the standardized prayer book, or Molitvenic. These lyrics endure as the first Wallachian example of the genre called blason (la stemƒÉ) poetry.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 9, 46; Papazoglu & Speteanu, p. 323; TƒÉnƒÉsescu, p. 183 This became an incidental record for heraldists studying the coat of arms of Wallachia, describing the bird as a raven rather than as a standard golden eagle.Cernovodeanu, pp. 48‚Äì49 The detail may also indicate his familiarity with legends about Radu Negru as the founder of Wallachia.Pavel Chihaia, \\"A fost Radu Negru un personaj real sau legendar?\\", in Magazin Istoric, May 1969, p. 51 According to George CƒÉlinescu, the blason has the first known rhymes in Romanian literature,CƒÉlinescu, p. 46 although the part-Wallachian Nicolaus Olahus is known to have been writing Latin poetry before 1510.Corneliu Albu, \\"Cuv√Ænt √Ænainte\\", in Nicolaus Olahus, Coresponden»õƒÉ cu umani»ôti batavi »ôi flamanzi, p. X. Bucharest: Editura Minerva, 1974.

Bucharest: Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company, 2006. Main work period An \\"editor by excellence of prefaces to books\\", but one who \\"never signed his works\\", NƒÉsturel is identified as the author of the foreword to Matei Basarab's standard legal code, Pravila de la Govora. Here, he explains the effort to collect and translate relevant literature, deploring the \\"scarcity and shortage of such books\\". Scholars also regard him as the author of the preface to another legal code, the 1652 √éndreptarea Legii. The latter text abounds in references to classical lawmakers, from Lycurgus of Sparta and Hippocrates to Justinian I and Leo the Wise.Theodorescu, p. 46 With his activity in the field, he aimed especially at countering the influence of Calvinism, publishing in 1642, and again in 1644, a propaganda booklet called The Learning Gospel. Varlaam Mo»õoc reports that he collected Calvinist propaganda to document the spread of its \\"poison, which kills the soul\\".CƒÉlinescu, p. 11; Theodorescu, p. 33 Although he was an Orthodox, scholars such as Virgil C√¢ndea link NƒÉsturel mainly with the Counter- Reformation and a religious subset of Renaissance humanism.Nicolescu, p. 38 C√¢ndea argued against other authors who described NƒÉsturel as an actual humanist, noting that he was a mere precursor to the belated surfacing of a Wallachian humanism later that century.Negrici, p. 186 This critique was also embraced by literary historian Eugen Negrici, who argues that the Logothete was only a humanist in the sense that he had an intellectual life, which, though \\"extremely rare in that era\\", never implied complex scholarship. As rated by Negrici, NƒÉsturel never was a \\"paradigmatic figure of European humanism.\\"Negrici, pp. 185‚Äì186 Cultural historian RƒÉzvan Theodorescu also discusses NƒÉsturel as one of the Catholic-leaning boyars at Matei Basarab's court, placing him in relation with Paisios Ligarides, who wanted to bridge the Great Schism.Theodorescu, pp. 33‚Äì37 As argued by Theodorescu, NƒÉsturel's interest in Thomas √† Kempis unwittingly linked him with the ideology of the Catholic Baroque, which was also based on the Imitation.Theodorescu, pp. 36‚Äì37 According to historian Petre P. Panaitescu, NƒÉsturel should be regarded as illustrative for the last \\"thriving stage\\" of Slavonic writing in Wallachia, or what Theodorescu describes as the \\"consolidation of cultural Slavonism\\".Theodorescu, p. 34 Over time, he specialized in the authorship of rhyming prefaces in Slavonic, which endure as \\"classical landmarks of that cultural moment.\\"Theodorescu, p. 45 The first one of these was published in 1643, at C√¢mpulung, for a yearbook of sermons.TƒÉnƒÉsescu, pp. 183‚Äì184; Theodorescu, pp. 15, 45 It was a contribution to Matei's genealogical legend, insisting on his kinship with Neagoe Basarab and describing his as a \\"good reign\\" of \\"great charity\\".Theodorescu, p. 15 He followed up with a version of The Imitation of Christ, printed in 1647 and also containing a lyrical preface.TƒÉnƒÉsescu, pp. 183‚Äì184 Gane argues that Princess Elena co-wrote some of the text,Gane, p. 239 which is modeled on the Russian recension of Church Slavonic.Stanciu Istrate, p. 86 The final edition, put out at Dealu, was decorated with the NƒÉsturels' coat of arms.Cernovodeanu, pp. 394‚Äì395; Nicolescu, pp. 35, 37, 38; Theodorescu, p. 45 Its crest included a red tower, possibly borrowed from the Transylvanian arms. The latter preface is noted for its musings on the origin of the Romanian vernacular, with NƒÉsturel recognizing it as a \\"relative of Latin\\".TƒÉnƒÉsescu, p. 184 However, as Negrici notes, his very retention of Slavonic showed that he was \\"hostile to the Romanian language\\".Negrici, p. 185 Historian and culture critic Nicolae Iorga also argued that, given a context in which very few could read Slavonic, translating The Imitation of Christ into that language was \\"pointless\\", an exercise in \\"pretentious erudition\\".Theodorescu, p. 58 All of NƒÉsturel's Slavonic poetry, including \\"epigrams on Greek names\\" or those he dedicated to Elena, has lexical obscurities and intricate wordplay, leading various specialists to conclude that his was a local manifestation of Baroque literature. Ethnologist Costion Nicolescu describes it as \\"rhetorical, pompous and artificial\\", \\"addressing an elite of intellectuals and the Chancellery\\". According to Theodorescu, NƒÉsturel was a \\"man of wide-ranging culture\\", but did not read all of the authors he cited. His verse is \\"pedantic\\", its use of Slavonic \\"already anachronistic\\"; the main function is to \\"direct\\" and feed a \\"courtly culture\\", which is on par with other European manifestations.Theodorescu, pp. 45‚Äì46, 58 Iorga contends that, overall, NƒÉsturel lacked literary skill and originality, being inferior to his Moldavian counterpart, Grigore Ureche.Theodorescu, p. 62 In addition to his Slavonic writing, the Logothete also used Romanian in translation work, known to include an acclaimed version of the novel Barlaam and Josaphat.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 45‚Äì46; Gane, p. 239; Nicolescu, pp. 37, 38; Stanciu Istrate, passim; TƒÉnƒÉsescu, p. 184 However, it survives only through reprints from the 1670s and later.Nicolescu, p. 38; Stanciu Istrate, p. 88 Scholar Maria Stanciu Istrate, who studied these versions, argues that they suggest an adaptation of Latin rhetoric to the developing literary language, taking many liberties from the strictures of the Russo-Slavonic copies he was using. The result, she finds, was artificial and \\"mannerist\\", without a viable representation in the spoken language, but nonetheless a landmark text.Stanciu Istrate, passim Critic Marius Chivu finds the translation to be both loose and \\"flawless\\", rewritten with an \\"amazing clarity\\" despite the weight of its subject matter. Marius Chivu, \\"LegendƒÉ »ôi adevƒÉr\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 10/2002 NƒÉsturel manor in HerƒÉ»ôti, 2011 photograph Panaitescu sees NƒÉsturel as potentially responsible for the effort to collect fragmentary historiographic texts and arrange them into an ideologically coherent whole. This effort, Panaitescu argues, eventually produced part of the compilation known as Letopise»õul Cantacuzinesc.Panaitescu, p. 216 NƒÉsturel's blason poem was also republished in the Romanian in 1643, then republished in 1644. He may have written various other poems in the vernacular, but they appear lost. One scholarly theory proposes that the Logothete also contributed the first Romanian version of Neagoe Basarab's political manual, or Teachings, and a hagiography of Niphon Kausokalybites.Nicolescu, p. 38; TƒÉnƒÉsescu, p. 184 Philologist Sextil Pu»ôcariu attributes him a second hagiographic translation, which tells the story of Great Martyr Catherine. Peak influence His father and his brother »òerban were no probably no longer alive by the time of his ascendancy; Cazan, who was still active, never joined the Boyar Council, and only held the rank of Bucharest ispravnic. NƒÉsturel and Maria's first son, Mateia»ô, was born in 1635; some two weeks later, Maria died, leaving the child to be adopted by his godparents, Prince Matei and Princess Elena.Gane, pp. 239‚Äì240; Nicolescu, p. 35; Theodorescu, pp. 38‚Äì41, 44 He was groomed by the couple as Wallachia's heir-presumptive.Gane, p. 240; Stoicescu, p. 215; Theodorescu, pp. 38‚Äì41, 44 Udri»ôte later remarried, to a Despa, with whom he had another son, Radu Toma, and a daughter, MƒÉricu»õa. He educated his second son at home, arranging him to be tutored in Latin by a scholar Teodor of Kiev. Radu Toma was also an early scribe for his manuscript of Barlaam and Josaphat. Throughout most of his career, NƒÉsturel probably resided in the old capital, T√¢rgovi»ôte, leaving on diplomatic missions to the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and the Habsburg Monarchy (1638), then more regularly to the Principality of Transylvania (1648/9, 1652, 1655). T√¢rgovi»ôte hosted his own lyceum, the Schola Graeca et Latina, staffed by Kievan expatriates; in parallel, NƒÉsturel himself taught at the Slavonic School, which existed in the same city. This educational effort combined his focus on upholding the Latin origin of the Romanians, but also their commitment to Orthodoxy.Nicolescu, pp. 37, 38 By 1645, the Logothetes summer home in HerƒÉ»ôti had been rebuilt as a three-story palatial residence. According to Gane, the process was already complete during Radu NƒÉsturel, but other sources suggest that the construction was by Udri»ôte and Cazan. According to Theodorescu, it shows Udri»ôte as an innovator in the field of architecture, going beyond the stylistic guidelines endorsed by Matei Basarab, and contrasting the conservative tastes of Moldavian boyars.Theodorescu, p. 32 He rates it as the \\"most interesting monument of its day\\", a late sample of Renaissance architecture with Oriental elements.Theodorescu, pp. 42‚Äì43 HerƒÉ»ôti was held by scholar Pavel Chihaia as evidence that Matei Basarab's Wallachia, as part of its \\"second Renaissance\\", had something resembling Baroque architecture. Barbu Cioculescu, \\"O carte √Æn dezbatere: ArtƒÉ medievalƒÉ\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 26/1999 It had a \\"fairly large library\\", which reportedly contained the works of Plato and Aristotle, as well as Aristophanes, Homer, Diogenes La√´rtius, Epicurus, Strabo, Suetonius, and Lucian. The HerƒÉ»ôti building impressed a foreign traveler, Paul of Aleppo, who claimed that no other such home existed in the Danubian Principalities, and nowhere in Europe except the Kingdom of France.Gane, p. 236; Nicolescu, p. 37; Theodorescu, p. 61 Paul was also perplexed that the monument was built so close to the Danube, in an exposed location on the Wallachian Plain, which could allow it to be ransacked by Ottoman invaders.Theodorescu, pp. 61‚Äì62 It is however known that NƒÉsturel kept a second such home, in Transylvania, alongside his lesser residences in T√¢rgovi»ôte and Bucharest. He and Elena co- funded the church in HerƒÉ»ôti, with Udri»ôte alone being the ktitor of T√¢rgului Church in T√¢rgovi»ôte.Nicolescu, p. 37; Stoicescu, p. 215 The former building was partly designed by a Mamant Barbulov, possibly a naturalized Bulgarian, who may have added the Oriental brickwork to the nearby palace.Theodorescu, pp. 43, 52‚Äì53 NƒÉsturel is also listed as a ktitor of Sf√¢nta Vineri Herasca in Bucharest, which was located close to his townhouse.Nicolescu, p. 37; Papazoglu & Speteanu, pp. 36, 43, 229, 230, 252, 260 In fact, he and Elena supported financially rather than built the latter.Papazoglu & Speteanu, p. 295 Maria Apostol, \\"25 de ani la demolarea Bisericii Sf√¢nta Vineri\\", in Historia, June 2012 Downfall and assassination The remains of Curtea Veche, site of NƒÉsturel's killing His last known published work was another preface for a sermon anthology, which came out in 1649. It is addressed to the monks of Mount Athos, containing NƒÉsturel's ideas \\"on generosity\\". The text is rated by Nicolescu as a \\"small treatise\\", while Negrici argues that it is not at all worthy of that title, being \\"in fact a few pages long\\". NƒÉsturel lost his first-born in 1652. Mateia»ô died in the princely home, after having freed the peasants and slaves living on all his personal properties. A letter by Prince Matei records the princely couple's \\"great distress\\". However, when he began searching for a new heir, he omitted Radu Toma and focused on Mihai, orphaned son of the former Prince Nicolae PƒÉtra»ôcu, then on Istratie Leurdeanu, and finally on Diicul Buicescul.Gane, pp. 212, 239‚Äì241 This period coincided with mounting political troubles, introduced after a war with Moldavia: victorious but wounded, Prince Matei faced a Seimeni rebellion stoked by the pretender Constantin »òerban. Princess Elena died in August 1653, shortly after having helped avert a more serious crisis.Gane, pp. 241‚Äì244. See also Filipescu, pp. 124‚Äì129, 132 She left her personal estate to her surviving godson.Gane, p. 243 NƒÉsturel authored Mateia»ô's rhyming epitaph. His last work in Romanian, it is seen by Theodorescu as \\"conventional and so very bland\\", largely an adaptation of Baroque dedications.Theodorescu, pp. 39‚Äì41 Also according to Theodorescu, NƒÉsturel brought into the country the sculptor Elias Nicolai, who carved the sarcophagus hosting Mateia»ô's remains and the epitaph.Theodorescu, pp. 38‚Äì41 The Logothete led a more obscure existence during the final stage of Matei Basarab's reign and beyond. The Prince died in early 1654, allowing Constantin »òerban to take the throne.Filipescu, pp. 129‚Äì132; Gane, pp. 243, 269 There followed new uprisings against the perceived usurper. Among his opponents was NƒÉsturel's cousin, Hrizea (or HrizicƒÉ) of BogdƒÉnei, who proclaimed himself Prince and, after a series of battles, was captured and executed in September 1657.Stoicescu, pp. 196‚Äì197, 215. See also Filipescu, pp. 133‚Äì138 Dates proposed for NƒÉsturel's own death range from 1657 to 1659.Rezachevici, p. 103; Stoicescu, p. 215; TƒÉnƒÉsescu, p. 184; Theodorescu, pp. 29, 44‚Äì45 In his last years, he had been replaced as Logothete and was an acting Spatharios of the Wallachian military forces.Filipescu, p. 145; Nicolescu, p. 36; Rezachevici, p. 103 Various chronicles note that NƒÉsturel was murdered upon the advent of Mihnea III (1658‚Äì1659), after originally serving him.Cazacu, pp. 71‚Äì72; Filipescu, p. 145; Rezachevici, pp. 102, 103; Stoicescu, p. 215; Theodorescu, pp. 29, 44‚Äì45 According to an 18th-century overview by Constantin Filipescu, Mihnea plotted an anti-Ottoman uprising, and for this purpose staged a \\"godless\\" purge of the unruly boyradom. Udri»ôte and various of his Council peers were kidnapped at Curtea Veche, strangled, and thrown out the window into the street below; their bodies were trampled upon by the princely infantry.Filipescu, p. 145 The Saxon notary Georg Krauss provides additional details \\"from reliable sources\\", namely that the murdered boyars had not approved of Mihnea's plans to align Wallachia with Transylvania in the anti-Ottoman alliance. Krauss claims that the male victims were only half-strangled, then left to wander the halls with no food, until they killed and ate each other; their boyaresses, meanwhile, were stripped down and tied together in sacks with feral cats, who mauled and ate them.Cazacu, p. 72 A text included in Letopise»õul Cantacuzinesc argues that the boyars were indeed strangled, but individually, as they left the staged feast to go out for walks (la primblare).Cazacu, p. 71 Constantin Rezachevici, who argues, against other historians, that the event took place in July 1659, notes that the victims of this massacre also included Buicescul;Rezachevici, pp. 102, 103 the latter is also argued by historian Alexandru CiorƒÉnescu.Cazacu, p. 71 Legacy Constantin NƒÉsturel-Herescu, Udri»ôte's last direct heir. 1870 portrait by Nicolae Grigorescu Later generations held NƒÉsturel in more esteem. According to Papazoglu, the street and area around his Bucharest home, near present-day's Calea Victoriei, became known as Udricani, in his memory.Papazoglu & Speteanu, pp. 13, 229, 230, 231, 232 The family's cultural mission was carried on by Radu Toma, who, in 1669, founded the first Wallachian school to offer courses in both Romanian and Slavonic, and offered tuition to disadvantaged children.Nicolescu, p. 35; »òtefan Tr√¢mbaciu, \\"C√¢mpulung Muscel\\", in Magazin Istoric, November 2007, p. 77 He also pursued a career in politics, obtaining the title of Ban on two separate occasions: 1674/5‚Äì1677, under George Ducas, and 1679/80‚Äì1687/88, under Constantin Br√¢ncoveanu.Nicolescu, p. 35; Stoicescu, pp. 215‚Äì216 He was attested as a protector of the Catholic community, contributing to the reestablishment of the Bucharest BƒÉrƒÉ»õia. His daughter Marica married Logothete Constantin III Cantacuzino, and then Prince Br√¢ncoveanu's Sluger, Grigora»ôcu BƒÉleanu.Stoicescu, pp. 117, 143, 216 Through his sister and the Popescu family, Udri»ôte was an ancestor of Radu Popescu, who sided with the BƒÉleanu family in their conflict with Br√¢ncoveanu, and is credited as author of the BƒÉleanu Chronicle.Panaitescu, p. 242; Stoicescu, p. 231 Theodorescu argues that NƒÉsturel's contribution as a palace commissioner is enduring, being a direct precursor of experiments in the 18th-century Br√¢ncovenesc style.Theodorescu, pp. 42, 46‚Äì47 His literary adaptation, the blason, remained a standard and forme fixe in Romanian poetry into the 19th century, even after Slavonic had been dropped. As noted by Negrici, this pattern was exceedingly conservative, characterized by \\"stereotypes and repetition\\". The NƒÉsturel family, which continued to be associated with Udricani and Dobroteasa down to the 1840s,Papazoglu & Speteanu, pp. 13, 230 also used Udri»ôte's coat of arms, although it was tolerated, rather than validated, by the succession of Wallachian Princes.Cernovodeanu, p. 174 In 1831, it transferred HerƒÉ»ôti to Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá, whose Serbian princely family later sold the domain to a Romanian politician, Anastase Stolojan. Carmen Anghel, \\"Conacul Udri»ôte NƒÉsturel, pierdut pentru totdeauna\\", in Evenimentul Zilei, April 28, 2015 The NƒÉsturels developed another property, NƒÉsturelu in Teleorman County, which housed a model farm and lands providing for the upkeep of Sf√¢nta Vineri Herasca.Chefani-PƒÉtra»ôcu, pp. 40‚Äì41, 219‚Äì220, 232‚Äì233 Udri»ôte's descendants in the United Principalities included General Constantin NƒÉsturel-Herescu (1796‚Äì1874), noted for his sponsorship of a Romanian Academy award, which included a land donation in NƒÉsturelu.Chefani-PƒÉtra»ôcu, pp. 40‚Äì41, 44, 108, 136‚Äì137, 207‚Äì208, 219‚Äì220, 233 According to Gane and Potra, he was the last of his family.Gane, p. 235; Potra, p. 320 In fact, this extinction refers to the family's male branch.Nicolescu, p. 39 In the Kingdom of Romania, other figures continued to claim descent from the scholar, including another general, Petre Vasiliu-NƒÉsturel, who republished Udri»ôte's Barlaam and Josaphat in Ioan Bianu's collection of early Romanian literature (1904).Nicolescu, pp. 38, 39; TƒÉnƒÉsescu, p. 184 Vasiliu-NƒÉsturel published works looking into the family's own genealogy and heraldry, which had also interested Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, a pioneer in the field, in the 1860s.Cernovodeanu, pp. 25‚Äì28, 32 Also active in that period, N. I. Herescu was often assumed to be a relative of the NƒÉsturels, but in fact had no known genealogical connection to them. Mihai Sorin RƒÉdulescu, \\"Genealogii: Despre N. I. Herescu\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 46/2008 During the late 1940s, a communist regime in Romania confiscated, then collectivized, the family's land in NƒÉsturelu, as well as the Academy's plot there.Chefani-PƒÉtra»ôcu, pp. 207‚Äì208, 220, 230, 232‚Äì233 The palace at HerƒÉ»ôti, devastated by a fire in 1931, was also confiscated from the Stolojans. Eventually restored to its original state in the 1960s, it was later assigned to the Romanian Village Museum. In parallel, Udri»ôte NƒÉsturel's work was being reviewed by a new generation of scholars, including Dan Horia Mazilu, with his first-ever monograph, published in 1974. Dan Croitoru, \\"Repede ochire asupra 'celorlal»õi'\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 16/1999; Negrici, p. 185 Of the landmarks associated with Udri»ôte NƒÉsturel, Sf√¢nta Vineri Herasca did not survive the communist period: heavily damaged in the March 1977 earthquake, it was restored, but then swiftly demolished as part of the Ceau»ôima campaign. Following the Romanian Revolution of 1989, there was a revival of interest in Udri»ôte NƒÉsturel's work. A 2000 edition of his Barlaam and Josaphat, overseen by C√¢ndea, contributed to this trend. According to Chivu, it revised a period when the book had fallen into obscurity, following the discovery of its \\"striking similarities\\" with the hagiography of the Gautama Buddha. HerƒÉ»ôti became property of the Romanian Peasant Museum in 1990, but in 2013 was returned to Stolojan family. Later descendants of the Logothete include Petre »ò. NƒÉsturel (1923‚Äì2012), also a heraldist and art historian who lived in exile following the communist takeover.Marina Sabados, \\"In memoriam. Le professeur Petre »ò.

The olive tree was a basic symbol of Athenian democracy as a prize for the winners of the Ancient Olympic Games. By extension, its oil was a valuable commodity and the only Athenian product that was allowed to be exported and this gave impetus to the development of Elaionas. During the Byzantine years, a large number of churches were built in the area, while the occupation of most of the inhabitants remained agricultural. Modern era Today, Elaionas is an area of 9,500 acres consisting of generally unregulated buildings, with many abandoned craft industry buildings, some actively polluting companies, vacant or unused land and few inhabitants. Elaionas's factories employ up to 30,000 workers. The upgrading and regeneration of the area has been a matter of concern to the Greek government many times, with the main proposals concerning opening new roads that will facilitate the establishment of enterprises and general de- industrialization. Elaionas is the site of a large refugee camp for those fleeing Africa and the Middle East. An important plan is also the provision for the creation of a Panathinaikos stadium in Votanikos and the creation of a metropolitan park. At the same time, the creation of a new intercity bus agency in the area and its connection to the Athens metro is being examined, which would replace the existing Kifissos Bus Terminal and Liosion Bus Terminal. The area is served by the metro station of the same name on Line 3 of the Athens metro.

Early life  Stephen Vincent Ben√©t was born in St. Augustine, Florida, on 22 January 1827, the son of a prominent political figure of Spanish descent. His grandfather, a native of Minorca, had settled in St. Augustine toward the end of the 18th century, and a great uncle had been a captain in the Spanish Navy. Three of General Ben√©t's grandchildren, William Rose Ben√©t, Stephen Vincent Ben√©t, and Laura Ben√©t, were to become distinguished twentieth century writers. At the age of 12, young Ben√©t entered a private school in Alexandria, Virginia, where he compiled an outstanding record over a period of several years. On the strength of this background, he was admitted to the University of Georgia as a junior, but left before completing his course to enter West Point in June 1845. He was the first cadet ever admitted from his home state, which had been admitted to the Union just three months previously. Originally determined to pursue a career in law, Ben√©t had considered remaining in the Army for a comparatively short period of time. He nonetheless consistently remained one of the top students in his class. He ultimately stood third in his class of 1849.  Military career  During the 1850s, Ben√©t served in a variety of posts at Watervliet, Frankford, and St. Louis Arsenals, and also taught geography, history, ethics and law at the Military Academy. Promoted to Captain in August 1861, Ben√©t was again detailed to West Point, this time as an instructor in ordnance and gunnery. By 1864, he had been made commandant of Frankford Arsenal, a post he held for five years. In May 1865, Ben√©t was awarded brevets of major and lieutenant colonel for faithful and meritorious service as an ordnance officer during the Civil War. When the Dyer Court of Inquiry was convened in 1868, Ben√©t, by then a major, was assigned the task of serving as an expert witness in defense of his chief. He subsequently served on the Ordnance Board for a short time, inspected ordnance and projectiles, and experimented with Parrott guns at Cold Spring, New York. On the death of General Dyer in June 1874, Ben√©t was appointed Brigadier General and the 8th Chief of Ordnance for the U.S Army Ordnance Corps. General Ben√©t's tenure of nearly seventeen years was marked by the development of new facilities at the various Ordnance installations around the country. Sandy Hook Proving Ground was established in August 1874. The Ordnance Board studied and recommended significant improvements for field artillery, including breech loaders, high angle fire weapons, elevating mechanisms to allow curved fire with reduced powder charges, uniform construction of interchangeable wheels, and folding trail handspikes. Considerable experimentation was carried on with seacoast guns, armor plate, and high explosives. The early modern machine guns were given some attention after they were first introduced in 1884, and work was also done on a pneumatic dynamite gun. General Ben√©t was also credited with having successfully pressed for retention of the Arsenal system despite determined efforts by private industry to take over all weapons production. The General retired on his 64th birthday, 22 January 1891. During his four years in retirement, Ben√©t was increasingly troubled by ill health, and he died in Washington, D.C. on his 68th birthday, 22 January 1895. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

Scored for four-part choir and organ, it was written in 1950 for St Paul's Cathedral in London.  History and text  (Song of Mary) and (Song of Simeon) are biblical canticles. Mary sings the Magnificat (\\"My soul doth magnify the Lord\\") on the occasion of her visit to Elizabeth, as narrated in the Gospel of Luke (). Simeon sings the Nunc dimittis (\\"Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace\\") when Jesus is presented in the temple (). The canticles are part of the daily service of Evening Prayer in the Anglican church and have been set to music frequently. Howells set the combination of Magnificat and Nunc dimittis 20 times, taking the words from the Book of Common Prayer. The St Paul's Service is scored for a four-part choir and organ. He finished it at his home in Barnes, London, on 26 December 1950. He later wrote that this was \\"the most extended in scale\\" of the canticle settings he wrote, and that the \\"great spaces\\" of St Paul's influenced the music, since the cathedral's long echo meant that changes of harmony and tonality had to take place in \\"more spacious ways\\" than if it was a less reverberant building. While this meant that \\"climaxes are built more slowly\\", he said that it led to a \\"heightened volume of sound, and a tonal opulence commensurate with a vast church.\\" The composer's biographer, Christopher Palmer, described the St Paul's Service as being one of the three Howells canticle settings that \\"tower above the rest\\" ‚Äì the others being his settings for King's College Cambridge (Collegium Regale) and for Gloucester Cathedral ‚Äì where the music \\"burns through the words' patina of familiarity into a dramatic and purposeful entity\\", while reflecting their \\"constantly varying nuances and inflections\\".  Recordings  The piece has been recorded several times, including a 1988 collection The Music of St. Paul's Cathedral, performed by the cathedral choir conducted by John Scott with organist Christopher Dearnley, and a 1997 overview of ten settings of Magnificat and Nunc dimittis by English composers, performed by the Choir of York Minster conducted by Philip Moore and with organist John Scott Whiteley.

This utopia was his central work: a planned \\"Onecity\\" in the middle of the United States with 160,000 square miles of converted area for the entire population. He created plans, elevations, wall fragments and models which are systematically structured.https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/28/arts/art-will- insley-s-visions-of-a-labyrinthine-city.html From 1966 on, he was a guest lecturer at several universities and colleges.

He died in detention the following day, having been severely beaten by some members of the South African Police in Odendaalsrus. He was the first COSAS member to die in police custody. Early life Sipho Philip Mutsi was born on 22 December 1967, at King Edward Hospital in Durban. He then went to live in Odendaalsrus in the Free State; and not long after that, his mother ‚Äì Pulane Irene Mutsi - moved him to live in Mokhalinyana village in Lesotho. Mutsi was a teenager at a time that South Africa had an exceedingly large participation from young people (particularly students) during apartheid, on matters pertaining to politics and unrests thereof. Political life Mutsi became one of the leaders of the Congress of South African Students (COSAS) in his township of Kutlwanong. He became even more involved after the Maseru Massacre of December 1982, when South African Defence Force commandos attacked a cluster of houses in Maseru which they believed was where African National Congress exiles were hiding. The Lesotho parliamentary forces were no match for the SADF and by the morning 42 people had died, 30 of them were believed to be African National Congress members; the rest were Lesotho residents including five women and two children. He was particularly affected by this because his parents were born in Lesotho and Sipho spent some early years of his childhood in the country. His political insight was also nurtured by the interaction that he had with South Africans who were exiled in Lesotho during the apartheid era. On 14 December 1984, Mutsi was one of the delegates who attended the COSAS congress which was held at the University of Natal in the Wentworth Campus. Upon return, Mutsi and his comrade Sello Dithebe started influencing learners from school such as Rearabetswe and Phello Secondary School to be more politically active and thus established a COSAS branch. Detention and death Mutsi was last seen when he was arrested at a bus stop on 4 May 1985 in Kutlwanong. He was taken into custody at the Odendaalsrus police station, in terms of the Criminal Procedure Act of 1977, for questioning in connection with charges of rioting in the Kutlwanong area. He was pronounced dead on arrival at Pelonomi Hospital in Bloemfontein the next day. His mother maintained that he was already dead when he was taken to hospital. A police spokesperson said that Mutsi had experienced convulsion while his personal particulars were being recorded and had subsequently fallen during that time, tumbling over a chair he was seated on. The police maintained that during cross examination of Mutsi on 4 May 1985, he had an epileptic fit. The police stated that Mutsi lost consciousness and was admitted to hospital. Later he was transferred to Pelonomi Hospital in Bloemfontein. However on admission he was found to be dead. The family of Mutsi maintained that he did not die of an epileptic fit; although his mother confirmed that he did have some episodes of epileptic fits sometimes. Thus an Inquest was held. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa report states that: A post mortem on 9 May 1985, attended by an independent physician representing the Mutsi family, found the cause of death to be severe brain haemorrhage. Grave of Sipho Muts Kutlwanong. During an inquest held in December 1985 at the Welkom Magistrate's Court, Warrant Officer Maxwell Sithole and Detective Constable Magwesa Moya, who had interrogated Sipho Mutsi at the Odendaalsrus police station stated that Mutsi had sat handcuffed on a chair in front of an iron table while he was being interrogated. They further confirmed the previous version by a police spokesperson that he had suffered an epileptic attack and had fallen backwards ‚Äì striking his head on the cemented floor in the process. The couple admitted that Sipho had been in good health and shape when he was admitted into police custody and that whatever injuries he had at the time of his death, must have been sustained during the interrogation. The police could not confirm how Mutsi had incurred injuries to his arms, legs and body which were alleged to be consistent with sjambok marks. In April 1988, a further hearing took place at the Welkom Magistrate's Court. Counsel for the family maintained that the deceased could not have died of an epileptic attack as the police had alleged. They put it forward that his death was caused by the brutal assault by Warrant Officer Sithole and Constables Samuel Mashabe, and Moya (including two others who have been unnamed). During the inquest, a former detainee, Mr Sello Dithebe (who was also close friends with Mutsi), said that he witnessed a police officer kick Mutsi in the face and that Warrant Officer Sithole had placed a wet canvas bag over his head. At the TRC victim hearings held in Welkom, Dithebe again explained how Mutsi was kicked by police and that when he tried to intervene, he was also assaulted. Dithebe said police influenced some of Mutsi's teachers at his school to testify at the inquest that he was epileptic and thus that being the course of his death. The circumstances relating to his death were not fully explained, nor understood. According to Dr Jonathan Gluckman ‚Äì a pathologist who was also appointed by the family of Steve Biko to look into the death of Biko ‚Äì said \\"state pathologist at the inquest in April 1989, confirmed the cause of death as head injuries with subdural haematoma, and raised intracranial pressure and midbrain haemorrhage\\".

From the Fifth Ottoman- Venetian War to the fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797, Venice maintained a good number of sailing warships, that formed the so-called Armada Grossa, opposed to the galley-based Armada Sottile. The vast majority of those ships were built in the Venetian Arsenal as some of its roofed shipbuilding docks were enlarged to allow construction of sailing vessels. Ships of the Line Navi di Primo Rango According to the classification used in the Venetian Navy, those primo rango (translation: \\"first rank\\") vessels comprised every two-decked ship armed with more than 62 guns. Usually, the ordnance varied from 68 to 74 guns, but the greatest part of those ships were 70-gun vessels . Since the second half of the XVIII century and the appearance of the heavy frigates the class comprised only ships with more than 68 guns, and those ships of the line were simply called \\"line vessels\\". * Giove Fulminante-class, 4 ships, 1667-1709 * San Lorenzo Zustinian-class, 29 ships, 1691-1746 * Corona-class, 1 ship, 1712-1728 * Leon Trionfante-class, 14 ships, 1716-1797 * San Carlo Borromeo-class, 2 ships, 1750-1797 Navi di Secondo Rango The secondo rango (translation: \\"second rank\\") Venetian ships of the line were two-decker with an armament that varied from 48 to 66 guns. They served as support to the main battle line of primo rango vessels and as scouting ships. After the Peace of Passarowitz in 1718 and the decline of Venetian Navy strength, their number was greatly reduced, and from the second half of the XVIII century their roles were taken by newly built frigates. * Drago Volante- class, 5 ships, 1673-1720 * Venere Armata-class, 4 ships, 1676-1717 * San Marco grande-class, 1 ship, 1684-1690 * Sant'Andrea-class, 3 ships, 1685-1752 * Fede Guerriera-class, 4 ships, 1693-1748 * San Spiridion-class, 6 ships, 1717-1738 Navi di Terzo Rango The distinction between secondo and terzo rango (translation: \\"third rank\\") Venetian ships of the line was based more on roles that on main armament.

In 2015 more cities joined including Exeter, Manchester, Newcastle, Belfast and Glasgow. In 2016, Cambridge, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Milton Keynes, Oxford, Galway, Reading and Brisbane ran events.  Impact  Soapbox Science was established to complement other initiatives such as Athena SWAN that tackle the low numbers of women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) in the UK.  Awards and honours  Serian Sumner and Nathalie Pettorelli were awarded a Point of Light Award in 2015 from the UK Prime Minister, a Silver Medal from the Zoological Society of London in 2016, presented by Sir John Beddington, and an Equality & Diversity Champion Award from the British Ecological Society in 2017, in recognition of their work on the Soapbox Science initiative.
