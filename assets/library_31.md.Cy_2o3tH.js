This acquainted him with the ice short track rink along with the short trackers, who used to join them during the latter summer trainings. The simple fun created by ice hockey games organized by the short trackers during Wednesday night, built good feeling with the new found team and influenced him to join the ice trainings. The new found adrenaline rush in speed skating immediately pushed aside the roller skating thrills. In 2006 the epiphany of his Olympic dream set out after watching in TV the Turin Winter Olympics.

Morton served as the associate editor of The Atlantic Monthly for 26 years (1941‚Äì67). He also wrote several books about publishing, relationships, and other subjects. During his career, Morton achieved notoriety as one of the most noted humorists in the U.S. Early life and education Morton was born in Omaha, Nebraska on February 10, 1899. He graduated from Morristown School in Morristown, New Jersey (now Morristown-Beard School) in 1916. During his time at the school, Morton served as an editor of The Morristonian, the school newspaper. \\"I had been the editor of the school paper, The Morristonian, and I had written a couple of burlesques that the Williams Magazine, The Purple Cow, published in the fall of 1916, but I had made no attempt to write for the next ten years after that.\\" After high school, Morton attended Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts for two years. He then worked in his father's hardware company. Morton also worked as a rancher at the Pitchfork Ranch near the Greybull River in Northwestern Wyoming. Journalism and government service Morton worked as a journalist in New York City and Boston, Massachusetts between 1929 and 1936. He wrote newspaper articles for The Boston Herald and The Boston Evening Transcript. He also penned magazine articles for The New Yorker. In 1936, the Boston office of the U.S. Social Security Board (now the Social Security Administration) name Morton as their information director. He served in that role until 1941. After joining The Atlantic, Morton founded the Accent on Living Department in 1943. The department published his monthly essays and articles on observations of American living. Morton later published collections of these essays in his books. In 1948, The Atlantic elected Morton to their Board of Directors. Robert Manning, editor-in-chief of the magazine, noted of Morton: Morton lived on Ash Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. During his career, Morton stayed well-connected to nearby Harvard University. He also grew a national network of connections with leaders at major newspapers. His local connections with Nieman Fellows at Harvard helped him to establish this network. During the 1940s, Morton worked with Francis Dahl, the Boston Herald's cartoonist, to produce two books. Dahl made the cartoons, and Morton wrote the book text. Elongated yellow-fruit writing Time Magazine ran a 1953 story titled \\"The Press: Elongated Fruit,\\" which examined Morton's use of the term \\"the elongated yellow-fruit school of writing\\". Morton coined the term to characterize writing styles that use inelegant variants for second reference of a word. The phrase \\"elongated, yellow fruit\\" relates to a second reference for bananas. In his book A Slight Sense of Outrage, Morton states that this type of faulty usage \\"lies somewhere between the clich√© and the 'fine writing' so dreaded by teachers of English composition.... It does bespeak an author who wishes to sound witty, knowledgeable, and versatile.... It can also bespeak an author who is merely pompous.\\" Garner's Modern American Usage describes several examples of Morton's labeling of writing as \\"the elongated yellow-fruit school of writing\\": * Elongated yellow fruit (banana) * The numbered spheroids (Billiard balls) * The azure-whiskered wifeslayer (a violen nobleman named Bluebeard) * Hen-fruit safari (Easter egg hunt) * Lacteal fluid (milk) * Succulent bivalves (oysters) * The succulent goober (peanut) * Rubber-tired mastodon of the highway (truck) Family Morton married Mildred Wadleigh Penick.

The book deals with fluid mechanics and is organized around the idea of conservation of energy, as received from Christiaan Huygens's formulation of this principle. The book describes the theory of water flowing through a tube and of water flowing from a hole in a container. In doing so, Bernoulli explained the nature of hydrodynamic pressure and discovered the role of loss of vis viva in fluid flow, which would later be known as the Bernoulli principle. The book also discusses hydraulic machines and introduces the notion of work and efficiency of a machine. In the tenth chapter, Bernoulli discussed the first model of the kinetic theory of gases. Assuming that heat increases the velocity of the gas particles, he demonstrated that the pressure of air is proportional to kinetic energy of gas particles, thus making the temperature of gas proportional to this kinetic energy as well.

Bernhard learned riding from Pantchoulidzew, and together they took part in international competitions. After the death of her husband Pantchoulidzew became a long-term partner of Princess Armgard and settled with her in the Netherlands, where he was naturalised in 1953.

The Netherlands boycotted the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia, because of the Soviet Union's invasion of Hungary. However, the strict Australian quarantine regulations resulted in the Olympic equestrian events being held in Stockholm, Sweden, five months earlier, and, with the help of Bernhard, Pantchoulidzew was allowed to participate at his own expense.

The terminology was mainly used to describe the league associated within Malaysian football league system.  History   Origin  The concept of an annual competition between the states in Malaysia goes back more than 95 years. In 1967 the Malaya Cup was replaced by the Piala Malaysia but the essentially amateur ethos continued until the Malaysian football league was introduced by the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) in 1979 as a 'halfway house' towards full professional status.  Era of Malaysian League (1979‚Äì1989)  Malaysian football league competition involving the representative sides of the state football associations was first held in Malaysia in 1979. When it began, it was intended primarily as a qualifying tournament for the final knock-out stages of the Piala Malaysia where teams compete in a one-round league before advanced to the knock-out stage. The top four teams at the end of the league will face off in two semi-finals before the winners made it to the finals. In 1981, the quarter-finals stage were introduced where eight teams were qualified from the preliminary stage. However, it was not until 1982 that a league trophy was introduced to recognise the winners of the preliminary stage as the league champions which then officially started the era of nationwide level amateur football league in Malaysia. Since then, the Piala Malaysia has been held after the conclusion of the league each year, with only the best-performing teams in the league qualifying for the Piala Malaysia. Over the years, the league competition has gained important stature in its own right.  Era of Liga Semi-Pro (1989‚Äì1993)  In early days, Malaysian football league system consist of amateur league before the changes in 1989 when it was known fully as the Liga Semi-Pro from 1989 to 1993. The league was divided into two divisions, Liga Semi-Pro Divisyen 1 and Liga Semi-Pro Divisyen 2. The inaugural season of Liga Semi-Pro consisted of nine teams in Divisyen 1 and eight teams in Divisyen 2. The Malaysian Police joined Divisyen 2 in 1990. Games were played on a home and away basis for about four months roughly between the end of April or early May and the end of August or early September.  Early era of Liga Perdana (1994‚Äì1997)  Liga Perdana was formed and established in 1994 to succeed the Liga Semi-Pro and became the Malaysian fully professional football league and was the top-tier football league in the country at that time. At this time the league was interchangeably referred as Malaysian League.  Era of Liga Perdana 1 and Liga Perdana 2 (1998‚Äì2003)  In 1998, Liga Perdana was divided into two divisions consist of Liga Perdana 1 and Liga Perdana 2. During this time both of the division was still just referred as Malaysian League as a whole. During 1998, Liga Perdana 1 consisted of 12 teams while Liga Perdana 2 had 8 teams. 10 teams that previously qualified for Piala Malaysia which played in 1997 Liga Perdana were automatically qualified to Liga Perdana 1. The other two spots were filled by a playoff round of the 5 lowest teams in 1997 Liga Perdana and the Malaysian Olympic football team. The lowest four teams from the playoff round were then put into Liga Perdana 2 alongside Police, Malaysia Military, Negeri Sembilan Chempaka F.C and PKN Johor. At this time the league still consisted of semi-pro team where each team was allowed to register 25 players where 12 players must be a professional for Liga Perdana 1 and a minimum of six professional players in Liga Perdana 2. Both leagues continued until 2003 when Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) decided to privatise the league for 2004 season onwards where Liga Super was formed. Teams in Liga Perdana 1 and Liga Perdana 2 was then was put through a qualification and playoff to be promoted into Liga Super. Teams that failed the qualification was put into now a new second-tier league Liga Premier.  Era of Liga Super (2004 onwards)  After 2004 Malaysian League term was mainly used to describe Malaysian football league system as a whole rather than just top-tier division in the league.  Logo history  There has been multiple different iteration for Malaysian league logo. The first logo been used during the era of Dunhill sponsorship. The new logo which replace it was during when TM start to sponsor the league in 2005. The last logo used was in 2011 when Astro Media first started to sponsor the Malaysian league. Starting 2012, there was no more logo created for it and league logo was only created for Liga Super and Liga Premier directly.

He is considered the founder of Armenian historical painting. His paintings feature scenes from Armenian fairy-tales and various historical events. Although Sureniants had one exhibition dedicated to his works in his lifetime, he was admired by many of his contemporaries which include many well-known figures in Armenian and Russian society including Martiros Saryan, Ilya Repin, and Vladimir Stasov. Life Vardges Sureniants in his youth Vardges Sureniants was born in Akhaltsikhe, Russian Empire in modern-day Georgia on 27 February 1860. His father, Hakop Sureniants, was a priest and taught religious history. The Sureniants family then moved to Simferopol in 1868. Sureniants' father was then appointed a presbyter to the Armenian diocese in Moscow. When in Moscow, Sureniants had an opportunity to study at the prestigious Armenian Lazarian School located in the city. In 1876, he furthered his education at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture where he graduated in 1879. That same year Sureniants went to Munich, Germany where he studied architecture at the Academy of Fine Arts, receiving more education in painting and ultimately graduating from the academy in 1885. He traveled to Italy in 1881 and visited the island of San Lazzaro degli Armeni where the Armenian Catholic congregation of the Mechitarists is located. In their library he studied Armenian fine art and Armenian manuscripts. He created portraits of Mikayel Chamchian and others. In 1883, he wrote his first article which was published in the Armenian newspaper Meghu Hayastani entitled \\"A Few Words about Armenian Architecture\\". In 1885‚Äì87, he traveled to the Persian cities of Tabriz, Tehran, Isfahan and Shiraz with Russian orientalist Valentin Zhukovski's expedition. After his travels, Sureniants translated William Shakespeare's Richard III and sent it to Constantinople so that actor Bedros Adamian could have it produced. In 1890‚Äì91 he taught art history at the Gevorkian Seminary in Armenia. In 1892 Sureniants visited Ani, Lake Sevan and became familiar with the everyday customs of rural Armenian life. In the same year, he went to Moscow where he became involved in many artistic circles. In 1901 an exhibition of his works was held in Baku. This was to be Sureniants' only exhibition in his lifetime. In 1901‚Äì02 he sculpted a bust of the Russian Armenian painter Ivan Aivazovsky. During the Armenian Genocide, Sureniants painted many paintings of survivors who found refuge in Russian Armenia. In 1916 he went to Tiflis, where he and other artists such as Mardiros Saryan and Panos Terlemezian founded the Armenian Artistic Society. In 1917 Sureniants moved to Yalta where he was commissioned to draw the decorations for the newly built Armenian cathedral. Sureniants decorated the altar, walls, and dome of the church. While decorating the church Surentiants suffered a grave illness. He died on 6 April 1921, and is buried in the premises of the Armenian church of Yalta. Work and style Much of the interior decorations of the Armenian church in Yalta was done by Sureniants In his early career as an artist, Sureniants became interested in caricatures and sketches during his study at the Lazarian School. While in Munich, Sureniants got into painting and line drawing. Some of his caricatures were published in the Fliegende Bl√§tter magazine. He was also known for his illustrations of famous literary works, including Ferdowsi's Shahname, Alexander Pushkin's The Fountain of Bakhchisaray, the fairy tales of Oscar Wilde and works by the Belgian poet Georges Rodenbach, the Armenian writer Smbat Shahaziz and Alexander Tsaturyan. Sureniants is often categorized as a realist painter. He once said that \\"painters must paint life the way it appears in front of our eyes.\\" His style reflected this notion through his depiction of landscapes and historical events. He played an instrumental role in reviving Armenian historical events through the medium of art. Pointilism was one of his chief techniques. Legacy Despite his success as a painter, Sureniants had only one exhibition in his lifetime. However, there have been many posthumous exhibitions in his honor, including exhibitions at Venice (1924), Yerevan (1931, 1941, 1960, 2010) and elsewhere. The most recent exhibition was held in 2010 in honor of Sureniants' 150th anniversary. During the exhibition, the Prime Minister of Armenia, Tigran Sargsyan, said that: Sureniants in his later years Sureniants was well known in the art community and enjoyed personal friendships with a number of famous Russian artists including Igor Grabar, Vasily Polenov, Aleksandr Golovin and the sculptors Alexander Matveyev and Nikolay Andreyev. One admirer of his was the Russian painter Ilya Repin, who said: Another admirer was the Russian art critic Vladimir Stasov, who said: The Armenian painter, Martiros Saryan, once said of Sureniants that, \\"with a broad understanding of culture, his best works contained the beating heart of the Armenian nation\\" and added, \\"It is therefore certain that Sureniants will last as long as the Armenian people shall last.\\"From the original Armenian: \\"‘≤’°÷Ä’±÷Ä ’Ø’∏÷Ç’¨’ø’∏÷Ç÷Ä’°’µ’∏’æ ’Ø’°’ø’°÷Ä’æ’°’Æ ’∂÷Ä’° ’¨’°’æ’°’£’∏’µ’∂ ’£’∏÷Ä’Æ’•÷Ä’∏÷Ç’¥ ’∏÷Ç’™’•’≤ ’ø÷Ä’∏÷É’∏÷Ç’¥ ’ß ’Ä’°’µ’°’Ω’ø’°’∂’´ ’Ω’´÷Ä’ø’®, ’§÷Ä’° ’∞’°’¥’°÷Ä ’é’°÷Ä’§’£’•’Ω ’ç’∏÷Ç÷Ä’•’∂’µ’°’∂÷Å’® ’Ø’°’∫÷Ä’´ ’°’µ’∂÷Ñ’°’∂, ’∏÷Ä÷Ñ’°’∂ ’Ø’°’∫÷Ä’´ ’∞’°’µ ’™’∏’≤’∏’æ’∏÷Ç÷Ä’§’®...\\" Gallery File:Shamiram ara.jpegShamiram and Ara the Beautiful File:Sureniants - Mutter.jpgVirgin and Child File:–í. –°—É—Ä–µ–Ω—è–Ω—Ü. –í–æ–∑–≤—Ä–∞—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Ü–∞—Ä–∏—Ü—ã –ó–∞–ø–µ–ª –Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–æ–ª, 1909.jpgReturn of Queen Zabel of Armenia File:–°—É—Ä–µ–Ω—è–Ω—Ü._–ñ–µ–Ω—â–∏–Ω–∞-—Ä—ã—Ü–∞—Ä—å.jpegKnight-Woman File:Sureniants_- _After_the_Massacre.jpgAfter the Massacre File:Vardges Surenyants Salome.jpgSalome File:–§–∏—Ä–¥—É—Å–∏ —á–∏—Ç–∞–µ—Ç –ø–æ—ç–º—É ¬´–®–∞—Ö-–ù–∞–º–µ¬ª —à–∞—Ö—É –ú–∞—Ö–º—É–¥—É –ì–∞–∑–Ω–µ–≤–∏ (1913).jpgFerdowsi reading Shahname to Shah Mahmud Ghaznavi File:Women Leaving the Church at Ani.pngWomen Leaving a Church at Ani File:–°—É—Ä–µ–Ω—è–Ω—Ü, ¬´–ü–æ–ø—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω–∞—è —Å–≤—è—Ç—ã–Ω—è¬ª, 1895.jpgDesecrated Shrine File:–ú–∫—Ä—Ç–∏—á_–•—Ä–∏–º—è–Ω.jpgMkrtich Khrimian File:Unknownman.jpgUnknown man File:–í. –°—É—Ä–µ–Ω—è–Ω—Ü. –í—ã—Ö–æ–¥ –ö—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ö–æ–¥–∞ –∏–∑ –≠—á–º–∏–∞–¥–∑–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Å–æ–±–æ—Ä–∞, 1895.jpgThe Departure of the Procession from St. Etchmiadzin Cathedral File:–°—É—Ä–µ–Ω—è–Ω—Ü. –ü–æ—Ä—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç –ò–¥–µ–ª—å—Å–æ–Ω.jpgPortrait of Idleson File:Surenyants BM.jpgThe Virgin File:Vardkes.jpgThe monastery of St. Hripsime Notes References  External links * 1860 births 1921 deaths People from Akhaltsikhe Armenian portrait painters Armenian translators Armenian male writers 19th- century Armenian painters 20th-century Armenian painters 20th-century male writers 20th-century translators Russian Armenians ","title":"Vardges Sureniants"},{"id":"41266034","text":"Stephen Bambury (born 1951) is Christchurch-born, Auckland-based abstract painter.

Geography Nishat Bagh in the lap of the Zabarwans The Zabarwan Range borders the central part of the Kashmir Valley in the east. Literally it is the mountain range between Sind Valley and Lidder Valley on the north and south, and between the Zanskar Range and Jehlum Valley on the east and west, respectively. Specifically the range is known to be what overlooks the Dal Lake and holds the Mughal gardens of Srinagar. The north end of the range lies in Ganderbal, while the south end lies in Pampore. The Shankaracharya Temple is built on the edge of the central part of the Zabarwan Range. The highest peak of this range is Mahadev Peak at , which forms the distant background of the eastern mountain wall. On the northern slopes of the central part of the range there are three Mughal gardens built by Emperor Shah Jahan. These include Chashma Shahi, Nishat Bagh and Shalimar Garden alongside the Pari Mahal (the fairy palace). The recently built Indira Gandhi Memorial Tulip Garden in the lap of the Zabarwans is considered the largest tulip garden of Asia spread over 12 hectares of land. Wildlife The Zabarwan mountain range possesses great Himalayan features with rich wildlife. The Dachigam National Park, spread over 141 km2, is the main feature of the range. The Dachigam National Park holds the last viable population of Kashmir stag (Hangul) and the largest population of black bear in Asia. The range is also home to musk deer, leopard, Himalayan brown bear, leopard cat, jungle cat, red fox, jackal, Himalayan wolf, serow, Himalayan yellow-throated marten, long-tailed marmot, Indian porcupine, Himalayan mouse- hare, langur and Himalayan weasel. Climate The climate of the Zabarwans can be summed up from the climate of Dachigam. It is a sub-Mediterranean type, with two spells of dryness from April to June and September to November. The range has irregular weather conditions with a considerable variation in the amount of precipitation. Snow is the main source of precipitation, and in some parts melts till June. The annual minimum and maximum rainfall of the Zabarwans ranges between 32 mm to 546 mm. Geology The crystalline axis of the Himalayan system contains the oldest rocks, and in the northern flank of this crystalline axis are found fossiliferous sediments of marine origin. The Zabarwan Range has crystalline rocks such as granite, schists and phyllites with embedded limestone, which form the core of its parent range. The western region from Khanmoh to the east of Mahadev consists of shale, calacarious slates and blue limestone. The sediments composing this range have been laid from Cambrian to Tertiary. The soil depth in Dachigam on the slope from lower to middle reaches is less than 25 cm, and hence falls under the category of very shallow soils.

It stars Kanchi Singh and Mishkat Varma. The show is a coming of age story about two young people who have different notions about love. Plot The story is about a Rajastani business family named Khandelwal. Avni, the daughter of the Kandewals, falls in love with Raj, who is an assistant of Avni's father Suket. Avni's eldest brother Akshat (a successful businessman like his father) entered his lover's picture into the group of photos selected by his mother Bhavana for making Akshat's wedding, convincing the family that his marriage was arranged. But before their wedding, Avni found the truth that Akshat and Arpita were lovers, but she chose not to expose him. Raj also helped them with the marriage, because Raj was Arpita's Rakhi brother. After her brother's marriage, Avni and Raj become closer, but she does not accept this because her family would disapprove. After many problems, the family agreed to let them marry. Later Avni and Raj found that Avni's mother (whose real name was Sangeeta) and Raj's father were lovers. Sangeeta's family never accepted this and they killed the whole family of Purohit (Raj's father). In reality, the death of Purohit' family was a game of Virat (Raj's maternal uncle) to avenge Sangeeta for slapping him. To keep his secret, Virat killed Avni's brother Abhas. Avni and Raj expose Virat's crime in front of the family, and they send Virat to jail. Afterwards, the two families live happily.

Early life  Cottin was born to a working-class family in Creil, France on March 14, 1896, and raised in Compi√®gne. Note that the death date provided by this source is in conflict with all others. He found vocation as a cabinet-maker. He had two children, a boy and a girl. As a young man he became interested in anarchism, and in 1915 he met French anarchists Emile Armand, Pierre Chardon, Sebastien Faure, Louis Lecoin and the Spanish anarchist Buenaventura Durruti, with whom he would remain close friends throughout his life. In May 1918, he witnessed municipal guards open fire on striking workers at an aviation factory, which he saw as an affront to his anarchist principles. At anarchist gatherings Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau was frequently blamed for breaking the strike, and Cottin decided to kill him.  Assassination attempt  On 19 February 1919, Cottin fired on then Prime Minister of France Georges Clemenceau several times as he was leaving his house on rue Franklin in Paris to attend a meeting with Edward M. House and Arthur Balfour at the H√¥tel de Crillon. He hit Clemenceau once, but the bullet missed his vital organs, and the Prime Minister survived. The bullet proved too close to his heart to admit surgery, however, and it remained in Clemenceau's body until he died from unrelated causes in 1929. Cottin was seized by the crowd following Clemenceau's procession and nearly lynched. Clemenceau often joked about Cottin's bad marksmanship ‚Äì ‚ÄúWe have just won the most terrible war in history, yet here is a Frenchman who misses his target 6 out of 7 times at point-blank range. Of course this fellow must be punished for the careless use of a dangerous weapon and for poor marksmanship. I suggest that he be locked up for eight years, with intensive training in a shooting gallery.\\" Initially condemned to death, Cottin's sentence was commuted to ten years imprisonment after a campaign by French anarchist newspaper Le Libertaire, who noted that the successful assassin of Socialist leader Jean Jaur√®s had not received the death sentence, while Cottin, who had failed, had. At his trial he declared himself a Bolshevik, and later published a declaration entitled Why I Shot Clemenceau. He explained that his motivation for killing Clemenceau had been the latter's unwillingness to allow Russian soldiers to return to their homeland after the revolution, instead sending them to Africa or even forcing them to fight against the Russian communists. In the United States, authorities interpreted the assassination attempt as a part of a broader international conspiracy on the part of anarchists to assassinate world leaders, and raided the homes of several Spanish anarchists, arresting fourteen on charges of conspiracy to assassinate President Woodrow Wilson.  Later life and death  Following his release from prison, Cottin remained under house arrest for some time at both his parents' home and his children's. In 1936 he joined the Durruti Column, the largest anarchist column formed during the Spanish Civil War, and fell in battle at Farlete, near Pina de Ebro in the Province of Zaragoza, in Aragon, Spain.

Along with Bosch, the premiere episode was one of two drama pilots Amazon released online in February 2014. Viewers were allowed to offer their opinions about the pilot before the studio decided whether or not to place a series order. The pilot was ordered in August 2013 and made available for free online viewing beginning on February 6, 2014. On March 12, Amazon ordered The After to series. The first season would have consisted of eight episodes, released in four two-hour installments. On January 5, 2015, Amazon canceled the show without shooting another episode beyond the pilot.  Premise  Although story elements were kept mostly under wraps, Amazon described the series as a post-apocalyptic drama centered on eight strangers who must work together in order to survive in a violent, unpredictable new world.  Cast  * Aldis Hodge as Dee * Andrew Howard as McCormack * Arielle Kebbel as Tammy * Jamie Kennedy as Dave * Sharon Lawrence as Francis *Sam Littlefield as Dark Shadow * Louise Monot as Gigi *Jaina Lee Ortiz as Marly Mu√±oz * Adrian Pasdar as Wade  Production  The After was first announced in August 2013, breaking creator Chris Carter's 11-year absence from television after the conclusion of The X-Files. The pilot was originally made available on Amazon on February 6, 2014 and viewers were able to assess the final product and offer feedback before the studio made a final decision about a series pick-up. The After subsequently received an eight episode order for the first season, which would have premiered in February 2015. Carter stated that he hoped the series would run for a total of 99 episodes, and that he used Dante Alighieri's epic poem The Divine Comedy (which features exactly 99 cantos) as his model for the show. In January 2015, Amazon Studios cancelled the order of the series. Following the show's abrupt cancellation, Carter said: \\"It might have taken us 11 years to make 99 episodes, in my mind. But I wanted to do The Inferno or, as I should say, all of Dante. That was my approach: to try to mimic the 99 cantos. It was a tough sell. It was eight characters in hell, basically. I think that‚Äôs the reason we parted ways.\\" He also cited creative differences with Amazon's executives saying: \\"With \\"The After\\" I wanted to do Dante, I wanted to do the \\"Inferno\\" and it's not a genre piece and so what's scary to people is if it's something they don't recognize. If it's something new or something original. And of course when something original works, then everyone wants to copy it. But if you're trying to do something that no one's ever seen before it's frightening. And I can understand that.\\" During The X-Files revival promotion, Carter said: \\"I think there was just a difference of opinion about the direction of the show. It was a hard sell from the beginning. It was eight characters in hell, and I really didn‚Äôt do a bible for the show because I wanted to discover what that was about. It was a hard sell, and it would have been an investment for them, if they were going to do eight episodes, of $40 million. I can understand their reluctance, and I still think I had eight great episodes.‚Äù Roy Price, Amazon's chief also said a similar statement about the show: \\"Not everything works out. It wasn't the money. It was a tough concept, and hard to crack. Who knows, maybe it will come together one day?\\"  References   External links  * Prime Video original programming Internet television After, The 2014 American television series endings Post-apocalyptic television series Television series created by Chris Carter Los Angeles in fiction Television pilots not picked up as a series ","title":"The After"},{"id":"41266564","text":"Joseph Jardine (1822‚Äì1861) was a taipan of the Jardine Matheson & Co. and member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong.

However, the banking sector has been rated as one of the most corrupt in the world due to strong secrecy laws and a large offshore banking industry which allow money laundering and hiding corruptly obtained money.  Extent  Government Switzerland has a legal framework to combat corruption and several authorities are in charge of curbing the levels of it, particularly when it comes to corruption within Swiss financial institutions. Several sources suggest that the country's fight against corruption has been effective. However, efforts to combat corruption, especially with respect to political party financing have been described as unsatisfactory. Council of Europe's Group of State Against Corruption (GRECO) in its evaluation report noted that specificities of Switzerland's institutions which enjoy considerable public confidence. It underlines, however, that the very organisation of the system allows subtle pressure to be exerted on politicians and the judiciary. Transparency International's 2018 Corruption Perception Index ranks the Switzerland as the 3rd least corrupt state out of 180 countries. The Transparency International Global Barometer 2013 shows that 58% of the surveyed households believe that corruption has not changed over the past two years, and 28% believe that it has actually increased. The same survey also shows that political parties are considered the most corrupt institution in Switzerland. The police and courts are generally open and fair with little bribery or corruption. Cases of excessive force, lengthy detention and abuse against migrants or asylum seekers have been reported. In some cases police officers have been given suspended sentences or suspended fines for using excessive force while arresting individuals. Business Regarding business and corruption, companies do not consider corruption a problem for doing business in Switzerland, and Swiss companies are active in Corporate Social Responsibility that are generally in line with OECD Guidelines for multinational enterprises. But the Swiss system has also enabled some types of organisation to operate with little or no transparency or oversight such as those linked to commodities trade.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-glencore-probe/glencore-probed-by-u- s-cftc-for-corrupt-practices- idUSKCN1S12CRhttps://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/commodities-cleanup_trafigura-ends- use-of-middlemen-after-corruption-probes/45096874 For example, International sporting organisations (ISO's) can have the legal status of an international Non Governmental Organisation.

Abraham Booth Life Booth was born at Blackwell, near Alfreton, Derbyshire, on 20 May 1734; while he was young, the family moved to Annesley Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire, where his father had taken a small farm as a tenant of the Duke of Portland. The eldest of a large family, Booth worked on the farm to age 15, with sporadic schooling. Then, working on a stocking-frame, he was able to support himself and get some further elementary education. He opened a school at Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire. Baptist preachers interested Booth in religion, and in 1755 he was baptised by immersion, and began to preach in the Midland counties. In 1760, when the Baptists first gathered into churches, Booth became superintendent of the Kirkby Woodhouse congregation, but not their pastor. He changed views, from General Baptist to Particular Baptist, and seceded. Soon after, he began to preach on Sundays at Sutton-in- Ashfield, Chesterfield, and elsewhere in the Midland towns and villages, still keeping his school. The Particular Baptist church of Little Prescot Street, Goodman's Fields, in east London, invited Booth to be their pastor. He accepted the call, and was ordained on 16 February 1769. He entered a controversy with Andrew Fuller, over the 1785 book The Gospel Worthy of All Acceptation. In the 1790s Booth preached in the abolitionist cause, and joined the Pennsylvania Abolition Society. The Baptist Education Society was founded around 1804 by Booth and others. It led, in 1810 after his death, to the setting up of Stepney Academy in East London. Booth died on 27 January 1806, aged 71, having been a minister 50 years. A marble tablet was erected to his memory in the Prescot Street chapel, where he had been pastor 35 years. William Jones's Essay on Abraham Booth was published at Liverpool, 1808. Works Booth published The Reign of Grace in 1768. Henry Venn, reading it in manuscript, journeyed to Nottinghamshire to see him, and a lifelong friendship resulted. The preface to the first edition and also to the second edition, 1771, was by Venn; there were nine English, one Edinburgh, and three American editions. In 1770 Booth published The Death of Legal Hope, the Life of Evangelical Obedience, London, as a supplement to The Reign of Grace, against Arminianism and Antinomianism. Other editions followed in 1778 and 1794. These two works were also translated and printed abroad. In 1777 Booth published a new edition of Jacob Abbadie's work on The Deity of Jesus Christ. In 1778 he published An Apology for the Baptists, a work written to oppose the principle of mixed communion. In 1784 he published P√¶dobaptism Examined, an answer to the publication by Thomas Robins of an abridgement of a Treatise on Baptism left by Matthew Henry. This book grew to two volumes, 2nd edition, 1787; and was followed by A Defence of P√¶dobaptism Examined, 1792. In 1796 he published Glad Tidings to Perishing Sinners, which went to four more editions, and in 1805 Pastoral Cautions. Other works were: * Essay on the Kingdom of Christ, 1788 (two later English editions and one Boston (US); it was also translated into Welsh, and published at Aberystwyth, 1810). * Commerce in the Human Species, published by the Abolition Society, 1792. * The Amen to Social Prayer, 1801, 2nd edition, 1813. * Divine Justice essential to the Divine Character, 1803. * Elegy on James Hervey; and funeral sermons and addresses. Booth also edited several editions of Samuel Wilson's Manual on Baptism. He wrote articles published in the Baptist Magazine for 1809 and 1810. In his last days, when unable to preach, he wrote essays, and two days before his death one on The Origin of Moral Evil; these were published in Posthumous Essays, 1808. Booth's works were collected and published in three volumes, London, 1813, as The Works of Abraham Booth, excluding his writings on p√¶dobaptism. In 1829 his P√¶dobaptism Examined was republished in four volumes, by the committee of the Particular Baptist Fund. Family On turning 23, Booth married Elizabeth Bowmar, a farmer's daughter. She died four years before him, and he left several children. Further reading * Brackney, William H.

The lands are part of a conservation area and the homestead operates as a wilderness lodge for tourists. It is situated about east of Derby and north west of Halls Creek, in the heart of the Wunaamin Miliwundi Ranges in the Kimberley region. The property is accessed via the Gibb River Road and the homestead is situated on the banks of the Barker River. Mount Hart shares a boundary with Charnley River Station. The property once occupied an area of . Frank Hann was the first European to cross the Wunaamin Miliwundi Ranges, then named as King Leopold Ranges, in 1898 via an pass. The station was established prior to 1906 when Robert Brown was the manager. Brown was in partnership with Felix Edgar and William Chalmers, who together owned the station. In 1906 the homestead was broken into twice, and the contents stolen. Brown made a report to the local police, who tracked the Aborigines responsible to their camp along the Charnley River and killed a man who tried to spear them. Another nine men were arrested and two females were detained, and all the equipment, including a double-barrelled shotgun, was recovered. Relationships between the settlers and the traditional owners further deteriorated in 1910 when Brown sent an urgent message to Edgar that a group of 100 had taken possession of the station and the cattle had gone. Chalmers was found fatally shot at Mount Hart in 1933. He had been ill for some time. The station was abandoned in 1934, and the lease was next take up by \\"Stumpy\\" Fraser in 1935. The property was soon struck by drought, forcing Fraser to move the homestead closer to permanent water. In 1946, following another drought, Fraser moved the homestead again, to its present location. He abandoned the property in 1957. The property continued to operate as a cattle station until it was declassified as a viable pastoral lease in 1987. It eventually became part of the Wunaamin Miliwundi Ranges Conservation Park when it was gazetted in 2000. The Most recent Mount Hart Homestead was built in 1960 and stand on the banks of the Barker River Taffy Abotts managed the property from 1991 to 2011 during which time he renovated the homestead and built various other buildings. He estimated the value of the improvements as being 1.9 million. The Department of Environment and Conservation asked Abotts to leave the property, offering 200,000 for him to do so. Abotts was later paid an undisclosed amount and left voluntarily. The APT company Kimberley Wilderness Adventures was selected by the state government to operate the wilderness lodge in late 2011.

Prosecutors have described it as the largest fraud of all time in terms of the number of people affected - more than 1 million, with victims in various countries. The brand became best known for its operations in Brazil held by Ympactus Comercial Ltda after it was involved in an ongoing investigation and trial for operating a Ponzi scheme, and later for having its operations suspended in the US by SEC under the charges of operating a multibillion-dollar Ponzi and pyramid scheme. Telexfree Inc. owns the rights to the Telexfree brand worldwide. The company was created by Carlos Roberto Costa, Carlos Nataniel Wanzeler and James Matthew Merrill after the change of its former corporate name Common Cents Communications Inc., which was incorporated in Massachusetts. According to the Company Registration Office of Massachusetts, Telexfree Inc. started to use this corporate name on February 15, 2012. Telexfree Inc. is a sister company of many other companies that operates TelexFree Marketing Plan, which belongs to the same founders and also share the same website. It includes a Brazilian company named \\"Ympactus Comercial Ltda\\", which was suspended in that country on June 13, 2013, by order of the court of Acre State. Telexfree's Brazilian operations were regarded as one of the largest financial frauds in Brazil's history, according to Brazil's Ministry of Justice and the Federal Public Ministry. The number of investors (labelled as \\"promoters\\" by Telexfree) has not yet been determined; by the end of August 2013, just after companies' suspension, Company Director Carlos Roberto Costa said that the company had 1,049,619 active promoters in Brazil. The company is currently under investigation by Brazilian authorities, which led the Court to freeze the company's and its owners' assets in Brazil and maintain, despite numerous appeals, the suspension of its operations in Brazil. Telexfree Brazil (Ympactus Comercial Ltda) denies the accusations, saying that it operates under the multi-level marketing structure, commercializing VoIP services. The final trial and judgement will likely be held in 2014, and the company assets will probably remain frozen before that, according to the Public Ministry (public prosecutor) of Acre State. Telexfree and BBOM, both companies suspected of operating Ponzi schemes and suspended by the Brazilian government, were featured among the top 10 most searched terms on Google during the year of 2013 in Brazil. On April 13, 2014 Telexfree LLC filed a petition for relief under the U.S. bankruptcy code. In April 2014, an investigation in the United States confirmed that Telexfree worked under a Ponzi scheme and handled more than $1 billion worldwide. The conclusion was made by SEC-MA, the agency that regulates the financial transactions in the company's home state of Massachusetts. SEC, in its Federal jurisdiction, also published a complaint against Telexfree INC, Telexfree LLC, the owners James Merrill and Carlos Wanzeler, marketing director Steve Labriola, as well as telexfree promoters Joseph Craft, Sanderley Rodrigues de Vasconcelos, Santiago de la Rosa, Randy N. Crosby and Faith R. Sloan. Telexfree case in Brazil The Secretary for Economic Monitoring of the Brazilian Treasury Ministry (SEAE/MF) released the Memorandum 118/GABIN/SEAE/MF, on March 5, 2013, about Ponzi scheme activities carried on by Telexfree Brazilian subsidiary, \\"Ympactus Comercial Ltda\\". The memorandum triggered several investigations into the company's operations, leading Telexfree to hire Multi-level Marketing lawyer Gerald P. Nehra to review its marketing plan. Nehra is a lawyer who is known in the U.S. for defending closed down Ponzi and pyramid schemes, such as Zeek Rewards, Ad Surf Daily, Universo Foneclub and others. On June 13, 2013, Telexfree's operations in Brazil were suspended. The company released a note on its website explaining the court's decision. The note says as follows (translated from the original Portuguese): In response to the seizure of the company's operations, Telexfree promoters protested throughout the country. On July 23, 2013, a group of protesting promoters in Brasilia blocked operations at Juscelino Kubitscheck International Airport. Marcus Fran√ßa, one of Telexfree's top promoters, stated, \\"we won't go back to the hoe, like the system wants us to\\", referring to the labor of weeding grass commonly performed by lower class Brazilian countrymen. Immediately after blocking operations, Telexfree tried to divert to other parent companies in Brazil, one of them named Worldxchange Intermedia√ß√£o de Neg√≥cios Ltda, belongs to Telexfree founder and director Carlos Nataniel Wanzeler. In the last week of July, 2013, Telexfree decided to appeal again (regimental appeal) in Acre state, but Telexfree did not pay a U$20 fee in order to get the appeal accepted to be judged. The appeal was rejected by the judges of Tribunal de Justi√ßa of Acre citing lack of payment and causing severe damage to the image of company lawyers before its promoters. Also in July 2013, a lawyer from Rondonopolis, Mato Grosso, won in court the right to have his invested money returned; according to the decision of the court 3a Vara C√≠vel, which ordered a Telexfree Brazilian company representative to reimburse him the amount of R$101,500 (about . Later that month, the ninth appeal to reverse the ban on operations was dismissed, and weeks later the tenth appeal was also denied. In an attempt to unfreeze its assets and continue operations, Telexfree offered the court its own brand as a guarantee of payment that according to the company was worth 660 million Brazilian reals or approximately . The offer was refused and Telexfree remained suspended. Four months later, news reported rumours of logo plagiarism by the company (see section below). In August 2013, Telexfree was fined by ANATEL, the Brazilian telecommunications regulatory agency, for lacking a license to provide VoIP services in the country. ANATEL released a public statement saying, \\"Offering Services of Internet Connections (SCI), which is a value-added service defined in Article 61 of the General Law of Telecommunications (LGT), regardless of which medium or technology used, such as dial-up connection, radio frequency, cable, among others, it must be associated with a telecommunications service properly regulated by ANATEL\\". After 13 attempts to overturn the injunction that shut down its operations in Brazil, Ympactus Comercial Ltda declared bankruptcy on September 20, 2013, when judicial recovery was requested in the court Vara de Recupera√ß√£o Empresarial e Fal√™ncia of Vit√≥ria. This request focused on releasing the company's assets and paying its debtors, according to a bankruptcy plan presented to the Ministry of Justice. According to Carlos Roberto Costa, company director, in a video, the company will only pay to its investors the money that they have in their back-office and not the total money invested. The court immediately blocked this maneuver to protect company assets and guarantee the maximum \\"pro-rata\\" amount would be returned to its investors when the time came. In November 2013, as a last attempt to avoid auditing in its operations, Telexfree in Brazil tried to arrange a mediation with Brazilian legal authorities and return to business. The meeting was held in Rio Branco, Acre state capital, but the company and the Ministry of Justice did not reach an agreement. Following this, the company began undergoing an audit, done by BDO, and the findings will be sent to Acre's public prosecutors to analyze. After the mediation meeting ended, the Telexfree promoter Fl√°vio Arraz was arrested, being accused of insulting the public prosecutor of the case, Alessandra Marques, calling her \\"Blond Devil\\". Two cases of suicide linked to the stoppage of the company have been reported in the Brazilian newspapers. In September 2015, the company was convicted by the Justice of Acre State for operating a Pyramid Scheme. Issues with insurance companies In early June 2013, the insurance company Liberty Seguros released a note on its website, in response to statements made by Telexfree representatives that both companies had started a partnership: On July 21, 2013, right after the Acre State Court cautionary injunction, director Carlos Costa released a video presenting an alleged contract between TelexFree and insurance company Mapfre Seguros, supposedly guaranteeing TelexFree affiliate's investments and the company's suitability. \\"Your business will be ensured. You, who was 100% Telexfree, will also be 100% safe\\", Costa says in video. \\"Would you think that Mapfre would do a insurance of something that was not 100% legal? Of course not. So here's it for you to see. People, [this] is the legality of our company.\\" In response, Mapfre released a note on its website, stating the contract was false: Public prosecutor and judge death threats The Public Prosecutor of the Telexfree case, Alessandra Marques, and the Judge of 2nd Civil Court, Thais Queiroz B. de Oliveira Abou Khalil, have reported death and kidnapping threats after the court's decision to freeze Telexfree assets and operations in Brazil. According with the Public Ministry, those threats arrived through e-mails, phone calls and online posting done by Telexfree promoters. GAECO (Special Action Group to Combat Organized Crime) and the police started to investigate the threats and some suspects have been identified. Since these threats began, the police have been assigned to provide protection to the Judge and Public Ministry Prosecutor. In December 2013, the Public Ministry issued an official statement denying the false information that Alessandra Marques, Telexfree case prosecutor, had been supposedly killed and that her body had been found by the police. The Public Ministry asked for a criminal investigation against the authors of the rumours, understanding that this practice is a \\"virtual terrorism\\" and \\"an attempt to coerce and intimidate the public prosecutors in its relevant challenge to defend the interests of society\\" The note concludes by stating that \\"given the gravity of the fact presented here, the Public Ministry calls on all its members to remain united around the ideals that guide the institution and not to be intimidated by any threat, recalling that only two species of people fear the actions of the Public Ministry: the ignorant, who do not know it; and the criminals, who know it too well\\". In a December 2013 interview regarding her tenor as General Prosecutor for the Brazilian Public Ministry, Patr√≠cia R√™go said: Telexfree case in the US Telexfree has its worldwide operations, excluding Brazil, operated by Telexfree LLC Brazilian operations are held by Ympactus Comercial Ltda. The owners of Telexfree Inc.Carlos Roberto Costa, Carlos Nataniel Wanzeler and James Matthew Merrillalso have companies in the UK, named TelexFree Ltd and in Canada, named TelexFree Canada Inc. In April 2014, Telexfree's US business unraveled amid accusations by the US government and regulators in Massachusetts that the company was a massive pyramid scheme. Telexfree's US assets were frozen on April 16, and it declared bankruptcy two days later. Co-owner James Merrill was arrested, and Carlos Wanzeler fled to his native Brazil on a donkey. Carlos Wanzeler's wife Katia Wanzeler was arrested in the airport in New York while trying to board a plane heading to Brazil. Authorities said the company claimed to provide Internet telephone services, but actually made money only from the fees paid by investors, who were told they would be paid for approving ads that would allegedly appear on the Internet. Telexfree operations in other countries In Dominican Republic two local TV Channels, TV Color Vision and TV Teleuniverso, reported that Telexfree launched in August 2013 its marketing plan in the country in an event where Carlos Wanzeler, Sanderley Rodrigues (Sann Rodrigues) and Steve Labriola where present. The company was promoting its business model saying that people would get a high rate of return on their investment without sales requirements. Furthermore, the Color Vision investigation showed that Telexfree does not have a local office or authorization to sell VoIP services in the country and their office in Massachusetts is only a virtual one. In November 2013, a Colombian magazine released an article about Telexfree operations in Colombia comparing its method of operation and the high rate of return with other local broken Ponzi schemes, D.M.G. Grupo Holding S.A. and Proyecciones D.R.F.E., that had previously affected the country's economy. According with news by Peruvian Press in December 2013, World Capital Market 777 (WCM777), a recently shut-down Ponzi scheme based in Hong Kong, and Telexfree LLC, had their operations prohibited by Superintendencia de Banca, Seguros y AFP (SBS) in Peru. Peruvian authorities asked the population to report any local operations from both companies to the National Police and the Public Ministry in order to close the schemes. Connections with other operations Regardless of its operations worldwide, Telexfree was developed on the same basis as the Ponzi scheme named Universo Foneclub, designed and owned by now Telexfree promoter Sanderley Rodrigues de Vasconcelos (aka Sann Rodrigues). Universo Foneclub was registered in the US and targeted the Brazilian community. It was shut down by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in May 2006. Logo plagiarism controversy Telexfree and Yonex BWF World Championships Paris 2010 logos New Telexfree logo In November 2013, Telexfree, which started its operations in 2011, was accused of having plagiarized its brand identity from 2010 BWF World Championships because of the striking resemblance between the logos.

Life Born at Gresford, the son of William and Mary Jones, he was brought up at Poulton, Cheshire. He started work as an apprentice in Chester in 1780, and encountered a Baptist congregation there. In 1782‚Äì3 he moved to London, where he was in the congregation of Abraham Booth, returning to Chester after about a year.Welsh Biography Online, Jones, William (1762 - 1846). Jones fell under the influence of Archibald McLean, who preached in Chester for some weeks in autumn 1786, and was baptised by him. The congregation joined the Scotch Baptists. He moved to Liverpool as a bookseller in Castle Street, in 1793, buying the business from his brother-in-law, and publishing McLean's work A Defence of Believer- Baptism. At this period he held religious meetings in his home, also perhaps attending those of Samuel Medley. In the late 1790s McLean set up a Liverpool congregation in Lord Street, with John Richard Jones of Ramoth. William Jones was an elder of this church. In 1812 Jones moved to London, working as a bookseller. He was minister, or elder (sources differ) of the church in Windmill Street, Finsbury, for the rest of his life. By the late 1820s, suffering financial troubles, Jones was taking on work writing books for Thomas Tegg. It was the American art student Peyton C. Wyeth who formed Jones's contact with Alexander Campbell in the mid-1830s. Works Jones's major works were: * Life of Abraham Booth, 1808. * History of the Waldenses, 1812, reissued as History of the Christian Church, 1817 (4th edition, 1819); sometimes assigned in error to William Jones of Nayland. * Biblical Cyclop√¶dia, 1816. * Dictionary of Religious Opinions, 1817. * Christian Biography, 1829. * Autobiography, edited by his son, 1846. Jones also edited a series of periodicals: Theological Repository (1800) and Christian Advocate (1809) were from his time in Liverpool. In London there were the New Evangelical Magazine and New Baptist Magazine (the change of title came in 1825, and the magazine was given up in 1826, after the panic of 1825); and The Baptist Miscellany and Particular Baptist Magazine (started in 1827, and running for six years). In 1829 Jones published lectures on the Apocalypse. The Millennial Harbinger introduced the theories of Alexander Campbell, around 1835. Later Jones broke with Campbell. In general terms Jones published material supporting the Scotch Baptists, and restorationism, and opposed established religion. The publications he edited had a wide circulation in Scotland. Jones edited the works of Archibald McLean and Samuel Stennett. He wrote biographies of Adam Clarke, Rowland Hill, and Edward Irving. Family Jones married Maria or Elizabeth Crane, daughter of Thomas Crane of his congregation in Chester, in 1786.

It was built in 1768 for Colonel John Banister (1734‚Äì1788), the first mayor of Petersburg, a colonel of cavalry in the Revolutionary War, member of the Virginia House of Burgesses delegate to the Continental Congress, and signer of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, Virginia State Constitution, and the Articles of Confederation. It is a symmetrical five-part Palladian house consisting of a two-story central block topped by a pyramidal roof, one-story wings that act as hyphens, and 1 1/2-story end pavilions. Although modeled in the Palladian style, its unique character is adapted to a colonial American lifestyle. Battersea is similar in design to the Palladian mansion at Lower Brandon Plantation in nearby Prince George, also completed in the 1760s and perhaps designed by Thomas Jefferson. Although the designer of Battersea remains a mystery, he would have been conversant in European tastes of the day. Also on the property are the contributing greenhouse and a kitchen, which may have additionally served as a laundry and servants‚Äô quarter. The brick greenhouse, or orangerie, is significant for its rarity and design. Built between 1825-1835, it is almost 190 years old and remains one of the few of its kind still in existence. The ruins of Bannister's Mill, a gristmill built in 1732, are located nearby on land that was part of Battersea plantation in the 18th century. Battersea has been privately owned since 2006, and was purchased by the Battersea Foundation in 2011. Battersea Foundation is a nonprofit whose mission is to preserve Historic Battersea and offer educational, artistic and cultural experiences that inform, enrich and inspire the public. They host several events at Battersea throughout the year. Battersea was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969.

Alongside other Arab chieftains of the area, he resisted the attempts at re-imposition of Abbasid control over the Jazira in the 880s, and joined the Kharijite Rebellion. He was finally defeated and captured by Caliph al-Mu'tadid in 895, but was later released as a reward for the distinguished services of his son Husayn to the Caliph.  Life  Family tree of the Hamdanid dynasty His family belonged to the Banu Taghlib tribe, established in the Jazira since before the Muslim conquests. The tribe was particularly strong in the region of Mosul, and came to dominate the area during the decade-long Anarchy at Samarra (861‚Äì870), when the Taghlibi leaders took advantage of the collapse of the authority of the central Abbasid government to assert their autonomy. Hamdan himself appears for the first time in 868, fighting alongside other Taghlibis against the Kharijite Rebellion in the Jazira. In 879, however, the Abbasid government, in an effort to restore its control, replaced the succession of Tahglibi chieftains as governors of Mosul by a Turkish commander, Ishaq ibn Kundajiq. This prompted the defection of the Taghlib chiefs, including Hamdan ibn Hamdun, to the Kharijite rebels. Hamdan became a prominent leader in the rebellion; thus he is mentioned‚Äîwith the Kharijite sobriquet of \\"al- Shari\\"‚Äîamong the Kharijite and Arab tribal leaders in the great victory won by Ibn Kundajiq in April/May 881, when the rebel army was routed and pursued to Nisibis and Amid. Map of the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia) In 892, a new Caliph, al-Mu'tadid, took the throne, determined to restore Abbasid control over the Jazira. In a series of campaigns, he achieved the submission of most local potentates, but Hamdan offered tenacious opposition. Holding the fortresses of Maridin and Ardamusht (near modern Cizre), and allied with the Kurdish tribes of the mountains north of the Jaziran plain, he held out until 895. In that year, the Caliph took first Mardin and then Ardamusht, which was yielded by Hamdan's son Husayn. Hamdan fled before the caliphal army, but after an \\"epic chase\\" (H. Kennedy), finally gave up and surrendered himself at Mosul and was thrown in prison. As H. Kennedy comments, \\"this surrender might have seemed the end of the family fortunes as it was for other local leaders in the area\\", but Hamdan's son Husayn managed to preserve the family's fortunes. Husayn entered the Caliph's service and was instrumental in ending the Kharijite Rebellion and capturing its leader, Harun al-Shari. He was rewarded by the grateful Mu'tadid with a pardon for his father and the right to raise and command his own corps of Taghlibi horse, which he led on several expeditions over the next few years, becoming one of the Caliphate's most prominent commanders. His influence enabled him to become, in Kennedy's description, the \\"intermediary between government and the Arabs and Kurds of the Jazira\\", thereby cementing the family's dominance in the area and laying the foundation for the rise of the Hamdanid dynasty to power under his two grandsons, Nasir al-Dawla and Sayf al-Dawla.

Folly Pier Waterworks was a 19th-century waterworks on the Isle of Portland, Dorset, England. The building was located at East Weares, the east side of Portland, below HM Prison Portland, which it supplied water for. Today, only the foundations and walls of its reservoirs survive. The waterworks was named after Folly Pier, a pier once used for the transporting of Portland stone by sea. History Folly Pier Waterworks seen from the cliff tops. Construction of the breakwaters of Portland Harbour commenced in 1849, along with the various fortifications including the Verne Citadel. HM Prison Portland was established in 1848 to provide convict labour for these works. As the island's traditional water supply, using springs an wells, was not sufficient for the government works, the Admiralty tasked Chief Engineer John Coode to build Folly Pier Waterworks and its large reservoir, along with a pumping station on the clifftop at Cheyne.http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=1421514&resourceID;=7 The waterworks supplied the prison above and acted as an intermediary by receiving and managing water from the pumping station. Separate reservoir tanks allowed both rainwater and seawater to be held. The waterworks was later closed due to an outbreak of typhoid which killed several prisoners. After the prison was converted into a Borstal in 1921, the remaining reservoir tanks of the then-demolished waterworks was used as swimming pools from the late 1920s. However, in 1933, one of the Borstal Boys drowned during a swimming event and this caused all swimming to be banned at the reservoirs. A swimming pool was later built within the prison complex. The surviving reservoirs have largely been reclaimed by nature. One of the remaining reservoirs acts now as a pond.

Work LTI Korea summarizes Lee's work: :Lee Garim‚Äôs poetry is characterized by exquisite use of language and careful attention to the creation of poetic imageries. His interest in French philosopher Gaston Bachelard stems from his search for the materiality of imagination. While he maintains a nostalgic attitude towards harmonious life in his poetry, he also maximizes linguistic creativity through the use of powerfully contrasting images.Source- attribution\\"Lee Garim\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# Lee Garim's collections include Ice Age (Binghagi, 1973), With the Forehead Against the Window (Yurichangae imareul daego, 1981), and Sad Peninsula (Seulpeun bando, 1989).

It charts the synonymic language of trance in the American Christian traditions: power or presence or indwelling of God, or Christ, or the Spirit, or spirits. Typical expressions include \\"the indwelling of the Spirit\\" (Jonathan Edwards), \\"the witness of the Spirit\\" (John Wesley), \\"the power of God\\" (early American Methodists), being \\"filled with the Spirit of the Lord\\" (early Adventists; see charismatic Adventism), \\"communing with spirits\\" (Spiritualists), \\"the Christ within\\" (New Thought), \\"streams of holy fire and power\\" (Methodist holiness), \\"a religion of the Spirit and Power\\" (the Emmanuel Movement), and \\"the baptism of the Holy Spirit\\" (early Pentecostals). It focuses on a class of seemingly involuntary acts alternately explained in religious and secular terminology. These involuntary experiences include uncontrolled bodily movements (fits, bodily exercises, falling as dead, catalepsy, convulsions); spontaneous vocalizations (crying out, shouting, speaking in tongues); unusual sensory experiences (trances, visions, voices, clairvoyance, out-of-body experiences); and alterations of consciousness and/or memory (dreams, somnium, somnambulism, mesmeric trance, mediumistic trance, hypnotism, possession, alternating personality).

Unlike litigation funding, which is limited to contentious legal cases and claims a stake in the proceeds of a case outcome, legal cost finance is a funding alternative that offers consumers payment plans (on the basis of credit facilities) to cover legal costs of both contentious and non- contentious matters.The Times, Thursday, 24 October 2013. Issue Number 71024: page 63 Effectively, legal cost finance is a specialised financing solution that spreads the cost of legal services over an extended period and enables consumers to repay their legal bills via instalments. For lawyers, legal cost finance provides the assurance of on-time bill payment and minimisation of disputes over legal costs. A third-party arranger (specialised broker) installs the payment plan facility and settles legal costs on the client's behalf using the credit funds (usually held in escrow accounts). If a dispute over a legal bill arises, the broker can 'quarantine' the dispute to prevent stalling of the legal matter. That is, the disputed bill is placed in abeyance until a later date (usually after completion of the legal case) whilst the lawyer continues to be paid from the credit facility. The disputed bill is later revisited in the context of the case outcome ‚Äì normally the client will forfeit the dispute in the event of a successful case result, and vice versa (i.e. the lawyer will forfeit the dispute in the event of an unsuccessful case outcome). Legal cost finance can function as a cost-neutral credit facility. That is, the charges associated with legal cost finance (arrangement fees and interest) can be absorbed by the lawyer (directly or by discounts on legal fees), enabling the client to effectively pay legal bills without incurring additional costs. Lawyers are usually forthcoming about covering client's charges associated with legal cost finance on the client's behalf in exchange for the payment assurances they receive from the broker over their bills. For consumers of legal services, legal cost finance is an alternative to the payment of significant up-front costs to lawyers on the basis of a retainer agreement. Effectively, therefore, LCF makes legal services more affordable. Consumers can apply for LCF solely on the basis of their credit history because the specialised loans are provided on an unsecured basis. However, in certain large legal matters security over loans will be required. LCF primarily relies on a report from the acting lawyer stating the merits of the case, which is assessed by the broker. This is designed to protect consumers from potentially irresponsible advice and to prevent the court system from cluttering by unmeritorious cases. LCF was first launched in the United Kingdom by an independent law broker, Dr Yuri Rapoporthttp://www.legalcostfinance.co.uk in October 2013.

Lee graduated from Sorabol Arts College with a degree in creative writing. Lee edited various magazines and publishing companies, including Shilchon Munhak-sa and was a founding member and officer of the Freedom Activist Writers' Association as well as being an officer of the League of Korean Writers and serving as the chairman of the Liaison Committee of the Korean Writer's Association and director of the Korean International PEN Club. Work While he was a student in the Creative Writing Department at Sorabol College of Arts, his talent was recognized by the influential fiction writer Kim Dongri, and Lee Mungu published his first stories, ‚ÄúDagalla Monument‚Äù (Dagalla bulmangbi, 1965) and ‚ÄúWhite Waves‚Äù (Baekgyeol, 1966), in Contemporary Literature (Hyundae Munhak) at his recommendation. After graduating from college, Lee Mungu worked for several literary journals, including Literature Monthly (Wolgan munhak), Korean Literature (Hanguk munhak), and Literature of Praxis (Silcheon munhak), and joined the Association of Writers for Literature of Freedom and Practice (Jayu silcheon munin hyeobuihoe).Source-attribution\\"LEE MUN KU\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# The subject of Lee's literary explorations is agrarian Korean society in transition. From very early on in his career, Lee revealed his interest in the harsh reality of Korean farming and fishing villages and the lives of rural people alienated by industrialization. Stories like ‚ÄúThis World of Woe‚Äù (Yi pungjin sesangeul) and ‚ÄúThe Cow‚Äù (Amso) offer, for example, realistic slices of contemporary rural life and an insider's look at the humble dreams and daily frustrations of farmers in these villages. The Dream of Everlasting Sorrow (Janghanmong, 1972), on the other hand, focuses on the urban poor. Countryfolk dislocated in the process of industrialization and forced to work as day laborers, the characters are now far away from the land of their ancestral home. An undercurrent of longing flows through the text. Nostalgia for a place and way of life that no longer exist also lies at the heart of The Ballad of Kalmori (Gwanchon supil, 1977). The volume contains retrospective accounts of scenes and persons from the author's childhood in Gwanchon Village. Lee provides sketches of a vanishing ethos connected with the Korean countryside a way of life based on hospitality, reciprocity, and fundamental reverence for the living. For these virtues, critics agree that The Ballad of Kalmori is a text worthy of being called the highest literary tribute to the lost world of traditional Korea. Lee's concern with the impact of industrialization on Korean countryside continues in Our Neighborhood. Whereas The Ballad of Kalmori is somewhat an idealized attempt to recollect a past way of life in rural communities, Our Neighborhood discusses contemporary realities faced by Korean farmers. The village of Our Neighborhood is a place invaded by three-fold pollution: contamination of the natural environment; destruction of the balance in local economy by the infiltration of industrial capital; and a growing trend toward mutual distrust among the villagers themselves. In the process, Lee articulates a sharp critique of the network of forces contributing to the material and spiritual destitution of rural communities.

In 2018 annual sales were ¬£20.8m and the company took 16,500 passengers. It is one of the world‚Äôs largest green travel companies and an ABTA member. It is also a travel publisher and has published over 650 destination guides as of March 2019. The company sells holidays designed to maximise the benefit and minimise the harm involved in tourism and was the first of its kind in the world. Holidays are screened for their compliance with environmental, social and economic criteria with an emphasis on grassroot initiatives and local providers. The company asks travellers to leave reviews, rating their holidays and the social and environmental credentials from 5 to 1. Responsible Travel was founded in 2001 by Justin Francis (British entrepreneur) and Professor Harold Goodwin, Director at The International Centre for Responsible Tourism. Dame Anita Roddick of The Body Shop was one of the first investors, believing that: ‚ÄúResponsible travellers want experiences rather than packages, authenticity rather than superficial exoticism and holidays that put a little bit back into local communities and conservation. This is the future of tourism.‚Äù The company introduces travellers directly to responsible travel and tourism options including accommodation owners and holiday providers. According to Simon Calder, Travel Editor at The Independent, ‚Äúthe ResponsibleTravel business model overturned conventional travel thinking. Instead of intervening between the travel enterprise and the tourist, as most agents do, Francis urges them to talk directly.‚Äù In 2010 www.responsiblevacation.com was launched in the US. The company is based in Brighton, East Sussex UK. As of November 2018 there were 31 employees. Responsible travel and tourism Responsible Travel was the \\"first online guide to responsible international travel\\". Responsible travel and tourism is about making better places for people to live in and to visit. One of the founding principles of Responsible Travel was to help create this new sector of the travel and tourism industry and to firmly root it in ethical values. Activities  World Responsible Tourism Awards  In 2004, Justin Francis founded The Responsible Tourism Awards, which were organised by Responsible Travel and hosted by World Travel Market as part of World Responsible Tourism Day. Professor Harold Goodwin of the International Centre for Responsible Tourism is Chair of the Judges. The Awards aim to inspire change in the tourism industry by celebrating those organisations, destinations and individuals working innovatively with local cultures, communities and biodiversity - at the forefront of responsible tourism.  Trip For A Trip  In November 2016 Responsible Travel began funding day trips for children around the world to visit a local tourist attraction that they may never had had the privilege of visiting before. The company asks its customers to ‚Äòopt in‚Äô to the scheme to offer a child the opportunity to appreciate more deeply the value of their own wildlife, landscapes, history and culture. Actor and traveller Michael Palin said: ‚ÄúTrip For A Trip sounds an excellent idea. My appetite for travel began with day trips, so I know how much they can mean to a child. Good luck and thanks to all who can make this happen.‚Äù  Zoos  In April 2017 Responsible Travel stopped promoting holidays that included a visit to a zoo, describing them as ‚Äúrelics of the past‚Äù. The move was supported by The Born Free Foundation and was praised by actress Joanna Lumley: \\"It only takes one to create a movement for change and it is fabulous to see a travel company being brave, sticking their heads above the parapet and saying that in 2017 keeping animals in captivity purely for our entertainment is just not acceptable. There are so many superb ways to learn about and appreciate animals in the wild; we should be encouraging people to get out into nature, not watching wildlife behind bars. I hope that more companies will follow this excellent example\\".  Elephants and tourism  After consulting with local suppliers, NGOs and animal welfare experts, in 2014 Responsible Travel published a detailed guide on elephants in tourism, including the rights and wrongs of elephant trekking. The company also changed its own policy and removed elephant trekking and elephant performance trips from its collection.  Whales and dolphins in captivity  In April 2014 the company launched a public petition to urge travel companies to stop selling tickets to establishments keeping whales and dolphins (collectively known as cetaceans) for public entertainment purposes. They also released a poll, along with The Born Free Foundation, demonstrating that 86% of the public no longer wished to see cetaceans in captivity. On 29 July 2018, UK tour operator, Thomas Cook finally announced that they would stop selling trips to SeaWorld.  Orphanage volunteering  In July 2013, Responsible Travel temporarily suspended 10 trips that involved volunteering at orphanages around the world for ethical reasons. The company was concerned that well- intentioned volunteers were fuelling a demand for ‚Äòfake orphans‚Äô ‚Äì and children were being separated from their families and communities as a result, causing long term psychological and emotional developmental problems. After formulating a working group which included ECPAT, Save the Children, Friends International, People & Places, Professor Harold Goodwin and Daniela Papi, an international advocate for responsible volunteering, the company published new guidelines for partner organisations wishing to promote any trip that involved volunteering with vulnerable children. As a result, 43 trips were removed from the website in total.  Carbon offsetting  In 2002 Responsible Travel became one of the first companies to offer carbon offsets. In October 2009, Responsible Travel stopped offering carbon offsetting claiming that people were using the offset as an excuse to pollute more. Responsible Travel founder, Justin Francis told The New York Times that offsets had become a ‚Äúmagic pill, a kind of get-out-of-jail-free card,‚Äù distracting people from making more significant behavioral changes, like flying less.  Had Enough  In 2004 the company launched a campaign urging three of the UK‚Äôs largest travel companies ‚Äì Thomas Cook, Thomson and MyTravel, to implement responsible tourism policies. The ‚ÄòHad Enough‚Äô petition was launched after research showed widespread dissatisfaction with mass tourism among ordinary travellers. A year later, all three had published their first Responsible Business policies.  \\"Overtourism\\" concerns  In 2017 and 2018, several major news outlets published articles citing the problems caused by an excessive number of tourists in cities such as Venice, Barcelona, Cornwall in England, and Amsterdam. Reports in The Guardian have often quoted Justin Francis, one of the founders of Responsible Travel, who stated that steps must be taken to limit the number of visitors that are producing an \\"overtourism crisis\\", in addition to \\"managing tourism more responsibly\\". \\"Ultimately, residents must be prioritised over tourists for housing, infrastructure and access to services because they have a long-term stake in the city‚Äôs success\\", he said. Limits on the number of visitors during peak periods have already been set by cities such as London, New York, Reykjavik, Amsterdam and Paris. Francis understands the rationale. \\"Some destinations may just have too many tourists\\" and that issue calls for strategies such as taxation, demarketing and limiting accommodation for tourists. In July 2018, Responsible Travel released its first documentary film: Crowded Out: The Story of Overtourism. Presented by Justin Francis and directed by Beth Walker, the film documents the issue of overtourism from the perspective of local people in hotspots such as Venice and Barcelona, as well as further afield in places such as the Gili Islands.  Turtle hatcheries  In 2018 Responsible Travel was the first travel company to implement a policy on sea turtle hatcheries, following concerns about the conditions in some hatcheries. It published guidelines for volunteers and tourists wishing to visit one.  Plastic-free travel  In May 2018 the company launched a ‚Äòno single use plastic‚Äô holiday section and a plastic-free holiday guide.  Fake snow  In winter 2017, Responsible Travel stopped promoting holidays that take place in artificial snow environments due to concerns including: the amount of water needed to manufacture artificial snow, the noise from snow machines and the use of chemicals in snow production and their effects on wildlife.

Honey Rose, Keerthy Suresh, Mohan Jose, Kalabhavan Shajon, Suraj Venjaramoodu, and Guinness Pakru play the other characters. The film was released on 12 April 2014 to positive response. The film was a commercial success at the box office. Plot The movie starts with Prince (Dileep),who is working as dog trainer in a dog clinic owned by his friend Dr Muthu (Kalabhavan Shajon), and Peter (Aju Varghese) is filming a documentary of the clinic. His life changes when an affluent rich lady Elizabeth and her female dog Lisa enters his life. Elizabeth appoints Prince as a caretaker for her dogs on the condition that Lisa, one of her pet should never get pregnant. However, Prince fails at the dire moment, when the guide dog of visually challenged Karthika (Keerthy Suresh) mates with Lisa. Things get worse, when Lisa delivers four puppies, but unfortunately she dies in labor, along with three of her kids. Prince names the lone puppy 'Diana', whom he raises with utmost care. Despite a rough start, Prince and Karthika gets along and become close friends. Diana becomes famous after she acts in a movie which marks Peter's directional debut, which eventually becomes a superhit. Later on she does a movie with the actress Diana who had betrayed Prince earlier. A heartbroken Prince once remembers all about his sweet past with the then student Diana(Honey Rose), whose real name was Sarasamma. It was upon her father's request that Prince came up with the new name for his prospective sweetheart. As Diana grew to be talented and a beautiful woman, Prince strived to the fullest to bring her to the silver screen. As fame, followed by a sense of ungratefulness begins to rack in, Diana publicly disowned Prince, which made him an object of heavy ridicule in front of his people. It was that humiliation which pitted Prince to go all out against his former love interest. Prince, with a huge support of his friends, including Karthika, survives every plot the actress Diana sets against the canine Diana and her master. In the meantime, Elizabeth learns that her dog Lisa was canine Diana's mother, and sues Prince for title of his dog's ownership. At last, Prince wins the case for keeping the canine Diana, on the grounds of his boundless love towards his dog, while the actress Diana learns the lesson that fame is not everything, and even a dog can outfame a human, when the time is right. In the aftermath that follows, Peter gets married, Dr.Muthu opens a hospital in his own name, and most significantly, Karthika undergoes a successful eye surgery and starts a new life with her guardian angel Prince..

It saw active service as field artillery with 52nd (Lowland) Division in Egypt during the First World War before being broken up at the end of 1916. Post- war, it was reconstituted as a Royal Field Artillery battery. History Formation The Territorial Force (TF) was formed on 1 April 1908 following the enactment of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw.7, c.9) which combined and re-organised the old Volunteer Force, the Honourable Artillery Company and the Yeomanry. On formation, the TF contained 14 infantry divisions and 14 mounted yeomanry brigades. Each yeomanry brigade included a horse artillery battery and an ammunition column. On 18 March 1908, West Riding Royal Horse Artillery (Territorial Force) was proposed as a new unit to be raised from amongst the 4th West Yorkshire Artillery Volunteers, RGA. It was recognized by the Army Council on 21 July 1908. The unit consisted of :Battery HQ at Wentworth Woodhouse, Rotherham :West Riding Battery at Rotherham :Yorkshire Mounted Brigade Ammunition Column also at Rotherham The unit was equipped with four Ehrhardt 15-pounder guns and allocated as artillery support to the Yorkshire Mounted Brigade.  First World War The battery was embodied with the Yorkshire Mounted Brigade on 4 August 1914 and apparently remained in Yorkshire. The yeomanry regiments left the brigade for other formations in 1915 and it ceased to exist. British artillerymen loading an 18 pounder gun at Romani in 1916 The battery, along with the Essex and Hampshire RHA, joined V Lowland Brigade, Royal Field Artillery (T.F.) when it was formed on 13 January 1916 at Leicester. Before departing for the Middle East, the battery were re-equipped with four 18 pounders. The brigade embarked between 15 and 18 February 1916 at Devonport and arrived at Port Said on 2 March. It joined 52nd (Lowland) Division at El Qantara on 17 March in the Suez Canal Defences. The brigade was renumbered as CCLXIII Brigade, RFA (T.F.) on 28 May and the battery as C/CCLXIII Battery on the same date. On 15 September, the brigade was renumbered as CCLXIV Brigade, RFA (T.F.) (the battery became C/CCLXIV Battery) and on 30 December back to CCLXIII Brigade, RFA (T.F.). On that date, the battery was broken up: one section went to A Battery (formerly Hampshire RHA) and the other section to B Battery (former Essex RHA). The brigade now consisted of two batteries of six 18 pounders each. While with 52nd (Lowland) Division, the battery took part in the Battle of Romani on 4 and 5 August 1916. 2nd Line In accordance with the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw.7, c.9) which brought the Territorial Force into being, the TF was intended to be a home defence force for service during wartime and members could not be compelled to serve outside the country. However, on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, many members volunteered for Imperial Service. Therefore, TF units were split into 1st Line (liable for overseas service) and 2nd Line (home service for those unable or unwilling to serve overseas) units. 2nd Line units performed the home defence role, although in fact most of these were also posted abroad in due course. Unlike almost all of the other Territorial Force RHA Batteries, the West Riding RHA did not form a 2nd line in the First World War. Post war West Riding RHA was not reconstituted until 7 February 1920 when it formed 12th West Riding Battery in 3rd West Riding Brigade, RFA (later 71st (West Riding) Regiment, RA) and ceased to be a Royal Horse Artillery battery. 3rd West Riding Brigade, RFA had also originated in the 4th West Yorkshire Artillery Volunteers in 1908.

One goal of supramolecular catalysis is to mimic active site of enzymes. Supramolecular catalysis is not a well-defined field but it generally refers to an application of supramolecular chemistry, especially molecular recognition and guest binding, toward catalysis. This field was originally inspired by enzymatic system which, unlike classical organic chemistry reactions, utilizes non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, cation-pi interaction, and hydrophobic forces to dramatically accelerate rate of reaction and/or allow highly selective reactions to occur. Because enzymes are structurally complex and difficult to modify, supramolecular catalysts offer a simpler model for studying factors involved in catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. Another goal that motivates this field is the development of efficient and practical catalysts that may or may not have an enzyme equivalent in nature. A closely related field of study is asymmetric catalysis which requires molecular recognition to differentiate two chiral starting material or chiral transition states and thus it could be categorized as an area of supramolecular catalysis, but supramolecular catalysis however does not necessarily have to involve asymmetric reaction. As there is another Wikipedia article already written about small molecule asymmetric catalysts, this article focuses primarily on large catalytic host molecules. Non-discrete and structurally poorly defined system such as micelle and dendrimers are not included.  History  An early example of enzyme mimics. Cram's 1976 crown ether acyl transfer catalyst. Breslow's Regioselective Hydrolysis of Cyclic Phosphate Catalysed by Diimidazole-beta-cyclodextrin The term supramolecular chemistry is defined by Jean-Marie Lehn as \\"the chemistry of intermolecular bond, covering structures and functions of the entities formed by association of two or more chemical species\\" in his Nobel lecture in 1987, but the concept of supramolecular catalysis was started way earlier in 1946 by Linus Pauling when he founded the theory of enzymatic catalysis in which rate acceleration is the result of non-covalent stabilization of the transition state by the enzymes. Nevertheless, it was not until a few decades later that an artificial enzyme was developed. The first simple enzyme mimics were based on crown ether and cryptand. In 1976, less than ten years after the discovery of crown ether, Cram et al. developed a functionalized binapthyl crown ether that catalyze transacylation. The catalyst makes use the crown ether motif's ability to capture cation to bind to the ammonium ion part of the substrate and subsequently employs the nearby thiol motif to cleave the ester. From the early 1970s, cyclodextrins have been extensively studied for its encapsulation properties and used as binding sites in supramolecular catalyst. Cyclodextrins have rigid ring structure, hydrophilic surface, and hydrophobic cavity on the inside; therefore, they are capable of binding organic molecules in aqueous solution. In 1978, with the background knowledge that the hydrolysis of m-tert-butylphenyl acetate is accelerated in the presence of 2-benzimidazoleacetic acid and alpha-cyclodextrin, Brewslow et al. developed a catalyst based on a beta-cyclodextrin carrying two imidazole groups. This cyclodextrin catalytic system mimics ribonuclease A by its use of a neutral imidazole and an imidazolium cation to selective cleave cyclic phosphate substrates. The rate of the reaction is catalyzed 120 times faster, and unlike a hydrolysis by simple base NaOH that gives a 1:1 mixture of the products, this catalysts yield a 99:1 selectivity for one compound. In 1993, Rebek et al. developed the first self-assemble capsule and in 1997 the so-called \\"tennis ball\\" structure was used to catalyze a Diels-Alder reaction. Self- assembled molecules have an advantage over crown ether and cyclodextrin in that they can capture significant larger molecules or even two molecules at the same time. In the following decades, many research groups, such as Makoto Fujita, Ken Raymond, and Jonathan Nitschke, developed cage-like catalysts also from molecular self-assembly principle. In 2002, Sanders and coworkers published the use of dynamic combinatorial library technique to construct a receptor and in 2003 they employed the technique to develop a catalyst for Diels-Alder reaction.  Mechanism of catalysis  Three common modes of catalysis are described here.  Orienting reactive and labile groups  A chiral substituted crown ether catalyst developed by Jean-Marie Lehn for ester cleavage. The crown ether binds the aminium ion so that the labile group (in red) is positioned next to the reactive group (in blue). A supramolecular host could bind to a guest molecule in such a way that the guest's labile group is positioned close to the reactive group of the host. The proximity of the two groups enhances the probability that the reaction could occur and thus the reaction rate is increased. This concept is similar to the principle of preorganization which states that complexation could be improved if the binding motifs are preorganized in a well-defined position so that the host does not require any major conformational change for complexation. In this case, the catalyst is preorganized such that no major conformational changes is required for the reaction to occur. A notable example of catalysts that employ this mechanism is Jean-Marie Lehn's crown ether. In addition, catalysts based on functionalized cyclodextrins often employ this mode of catalysis.  Raising the effective substrate concentration  Bimolecular reactions are highly dependent on the concentration of substrates. Therefore, when a supramolecular container encapsulates both reactants within its small cavity, the effective local concentration of the reactants is increased and, as a result of an entropic effect, the rate of the reaction is accelerated. That is to say an intramolecular reaction is faster than its corresponding intermolecular reaction. Although high raise in effective concentration is observed, molecules that employ this mode of catalysis have tiny rate acceleration compared to that of enzymes. A proposed explanation is that in a container the substrates are not as tightly bound as in enzyme. The reagents have room to wiggle in a cavity and so the entropic effect might not be as important. Even in the case of enzymes, computational studies have shown that the entropic effect might also be overestimated. Examples of molecules that work via this mechanism are Rebek's tennis ball and Fujita's octahedral complex. Hydrogen-bonded glycouril dimer catalyst developed by Julius Rebek Jr. for Diels-Alder reactions. The catalyst encapsulates the diene and dienophile, increasing the effective concentration of reactants.  Stabilizing transition state  Generic potential energy diagram showing the effect of a catalyst. Supramolecular catalysts can accelerate reactions not only by placing the two reactants in close proximity but also by stabilizing the transition state of the reaction and reducing activation energy. While this fundamental principle of catalysis is common in small molecule or heterogeneous catalysts, supramolecular catalysts however has a difficult time utilizing the concept due to their often rigid structures. Unlike enzymes that can change shape to accommodate the substrates, supramolecules do not have that kind of flexibility and so rarely achieve sub-angstrom adjustment required for perfect transition state stabilization. An example of catalysts of this type is Sander's porphyrin trimer. A Diels Alder reaction between two pyridine functionalized substrates normally yield a mixture of endo and exo products. In the presence of the two catalysts, however, complete endo selectivity or exo selectivity could be obtained. The underlying cause of the selectivity is the coordination interaction between pyridine and the zinc ion on porphyrin. Depending on the shape of the catalysts, one product is preferred over the other. Porphyrin trimer catalyst developed by Jeremy Sanders for exo selective Diels-Alder reactions. The catalyst stabilizes the exo transition state by strategic binding of zinc (II) ion to pyridine nitrogen atoms on the diene and dienophile.  Approaches to making supramolecular catalysts   Design approach  The traditional approach to supramolecular catalysts focuses on the design of macromolecular receptor with appropriately placed catalytic functional groups. These catalysts are often inspired by the structure of enzymes with the catalytic group mimicking reactive amino acid residues, but unlike real enzymes, the binding sites of these catalysts are rigid structure made from chemical building blocks. All of the examples in this article are developed via the design approach. Jeremy Sanders pointed out that the design approach has not been successful and has produced very few efficient catalysts because of rigidity of the supramolecules. He argued that rigid molecules with a slight mismatch to the transition state cannot be an efficient catalyst. Rather than investing so much synthesis effort on one rigid molecule that we cannot determine its precise geometry to the sub-angstrom level which is required for good stabilization, Sanders suggested the use of many small flexible building blocks with competing weak interactions so that it is possible for the catalyst to adjust its structure to accommodate the substrate better. There is a direct trade-off between the enthalpic benefit from flexible structure and the entropic benefit from rigid structure. Flexible structure could perhaps bind the transition state better but it allows more room for the substrates to move and vibrate. Most supramolecular chemists in the past prefer to build rigid structures out of fear of entropic cost. This problem could perhaps be mended by Baker and Houk's \\"inside-out approach\\" which allows a systematic de novo enzyme development. This computational method starts simply with a predicted transition state structure and slowly builds outward by optimizing the arrangement of functional groups to stabilize the transition state. Then it fills out the remainder of the active site and, finally, it generates an entire protein scaffold that could contain the designed active site. This method could potentially be applied to supramolecular catalysis, although a plethora of chemical building blocks could easily overwhelm the computational model intended to work with 20 amino acids.  Transition state analogue selection/screening approach  A diagram depicting a use of transition state analog selection approach to select a catalytic antibody. Assuming that catalytic activity largely depends on the catalyst's affinity to the transition state, one could synthesize a transition state analog (TSA), a structure that resembles the transition state of the reaction. Then one could link the TSA to a solid-support or identifiable tag and use that TSA to select an optimal catalyst from a mixture of many different potential catalysts generated chemically or biologically by a diversity oriented synthesis. This method allows quick screening of a library of diverse compounds. It does not require as much synthetic effort and it allows a study of various catalytic factors simultaneously. Hence the method could potentially yield an efficient catalyst that we could not have designed with our current knowledge. Many catalytic antibodies were developed and studied using this approach.  Catalytic activity screening approach  A diagram depicting a use of catalytic activity screening approach to screen a catalyst. A problem with transition state analogue selection approach is that catalytic activity is not a screening criterion. TSAs do not necessarily represent real transition states and so a catalyst obtained from screening could just be the best receptor for a TSA but is not necessarily the best catalyst. To circumvent this problem, catalytic activity needs to be measured directly and also quickly. To develop a high-throughput screen, substrates could be designed to change color or release a fluorescent product upon reaction. For example, Crabtree and coworkers utilized this method in screening for a hydrosylation catalysts for alkene and imine. Unfortunately the prerequisite for such substrates narrow down the range of reactions for study.  Dynamic combinatorial library approach  A diagram depicting a use of dynamic combinatorial library to select an optimal receptor. In contrast to traditional combinatorial synthesis where a library of catalysts were first generated and later screened (as in the two above approaches), dynamic combinatorial library approach utilizes a mixture of multicomponent building blocks that reversibly form library of catalysts. With out a template, the library consists of a roughly equal mixture of different combination of building blocks. In the presence of a template which is either a starting material or a TSA, the combination that provides the best binding to the template is thermodynamically favorable and thus that combination is more prevalent than other library members. The biased ratio of the desired catalyst to other combinatorial products could then be frozen by terminating the reversibility of the equilibrium by means such as change in temperature, pH, or radiation to yield the optimal catalyst. For example, Lehn et al. used this method to create a dynamic combinatorial library of imine inhibitor from a set of amines and a set of aldehydes. After some time, the equilibrium was terminated by an addition of NaBH3CN to afford the desired catalyst.  Prominent examples of supramolecular catalysts   Diederich's pyruvate oxidase mimic  In nature, pyruvate oxidase employs two cofactors thiamine pyrophosphate (ThDP) and Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) to catalyze a conversion of pyruvate to acetyl phosphate. First, ThDP mediates a decarboxylation of pyruvate and generates an active aldehyde as a product. The aldehyde is then oxidized by FAD and is subsequently attacked by phosphate to yield acetyl phosphate. Diederich and coworkers mimicked this system with a supramolecular catalyst based on cyclophane. The catalyst has thiazolium ion, a reactive part of ThDP and flavin, a bare-bones core of FAD, in close proximity and near the substrate binding site. The catalytic cycle is almost the same as that in nature, except the substrate is an aromatic aldehyde rather than pyruvate. First, the catalyst binds the substrate within its cyclophane ring. Then, it uses thiazolium ion to condense with the substrate generating an active aldehyde. This aldehyde is oxidized by flavin and then attacked by methanol to yield a methyl ester. Pyruvate oxidase mimic developed by Fran√ßois Diederich. The cyclophane based catalyst utilizes ThDP mimic and FAD mimic to accelerate the oxidation of aldehyde into ester.  Nolte's successive epoxidation catalyst for alkene polymer  Processive enzymes are proteins that catalyze consecutive reactions without releasing its substrate. An example of processive enzymes is RNA polymerase which binds to a DNA strand and repeatedly catalyzes nucleotide transfers, effectively synthesizing a corresponding RNA strand. Nolte and coworkers developed an artificial processive enzyme in a form of manganese porphyrin rotaxane that treads along a long polymer of alkene and catalyze multiple rounds of alkene epoxidation. Manganese (III) ion in the porphyrin is the molecule's catalytic center, capable of epoxidation in the presence of an oxygen donor and an activating ligand. With a small ligand such pyridine that binds manganese from inside the cavity of the rotaxane, epoxidation happens outside the catalyst. With a large bulky ligand such as tert-butyl pyridine that does not fit inside the cavity however, epoxidation happens on the inside of the catalyst. A manganese porphyrin catalyst developed by Nolte et al. capable of successive epoxidation of alkene polymer.  Raymond's Nazarov cyclization catalyst  Raymond and coworkers developed a supramolecular host M4L6 (4 gallium ions and 6 ligands for each complex) that self-assembles via metal-ligand interaction in aqueous solution. This container molecule is polyanionic and thus its tetrahedron- shaped cavity is capable of encapsulating and stabilizing a cationic molecule. Consequently, encapsulated molecule can be easily protonated as a resulting carbocation from protonation is stabilized by the surrounding anions. Raymond utilized this property to perform acid-catalyzed Nazarov cyclization. The catalyst accelerates the reaction by over one million fold, making it the most efficient supramolecular catalyst to date. It was proposed that such a high catalytic activity does not arise just from the increased basicity of the encapsulated substrate but also from the constrictive binding that stabilize the transition state of the cyclization. Unfortunately, this catalyst has a problem with product inhibition. To by pass that problem, the product of the cyclization reaction could be reacted with a dienophile transforming it into a Diels-Alder adduct that no longer fits inside the catalyst cavity. In this case, the supramolecular host was initially designed to simply capture cationic guests. Almost a decade later, it was exploited as a catalyst for Nazarov cyclization. A self-assemble gallium catalyst developed by Ken Raymond accelerates Nazarov cyclization by stabilizing the cationic transition state. The structure drawn here shows only one ligand for simplicity sake, but there are six ligands on the edges of the tetrahedral complex.  Fujita's chiral self-assembled catalyst for asymmetric [2+2] photoadditions  Fujita and coworkers discovered a self-assemble M6L4 (6 palladium ions and 4 ligands in each complex) supramolecular container that could be enhanced into a chiral supramolecule by an addition of peripheral chiral auxiliary. In this case, the auxiliary diethyldiaminocyclohexane does not directly activate the catalytic site but induces a slight deformation of the triazine plane to create chiral cavity inside the container molecule. This container could then be used to asymmetrically catalyze a [2+2] photoaddition of maleimide and inert aromatic compound fluoranthene, which previously have not been shown to undergo thermal or photochemical pericyclic reaction. The catalyst yields an enantiomeric excess of 40%. An asymmetric [2+2] photoaddition catalyst based on a tetrahedral palladium complex developed by Makoto Fujita. The catalyst has chiral diamine auxiliaries that induces the asymmetric change in the cavity.  List's confined Bronsted acid as a catalyst for asymmetric spiroacetalization  Inspired by enzymes with deep active site pocket, List and coworkers designed and constructed a set of confined Bronsted acids with an extremely sterically demanding chiral pocket based on a C2-symmetric bis(binapthyl) imidodiphosphoric acid. Within the chiral microenvironment, the catalysts has a geometrically fixed bifunctional active site that activates both an electrophilic part and a nucleophilic part of a substrate. This catalyst enables stereoselective spiroacetal formation with high enantiomeric excess for a variety of substrates. A chiral constrained Bronsted acid developed by Benjamin List works as an asymmetric spiroacetalization catalyst.  Supramolecular inhibitors  Supramolecular containers do not only have an application in catalysis but also in the opposite, namely, inhibition. A container molecule could encapsulate a guest molecule and thus subsequently renders the guest unreactive. A mechanism of inhibition could either be that the substrate is completely isolated from the reagent or that the container molecule destabilize the transition state of the reaction. Nitschke and coworkers invented a self-assembly M4L6 supramolecular host with a tetrahedral hydrophobic cavity that can encapsulate white phosphorus. Pyrophoric phosphorus, which could self-combust upon contact with air, is rendered air- stable within the cavity. Even though the hole in the cavity is large enough for an oxygen molecule to enter, the transition state of the combustion is too large to fit within the small cage cavity. A subcomponent self-assembly tetrahedral capsule developed by Jonathan Nitschke renders pyrophoric white phosphorus air-stable. The structure drawn here shows only one ligand for simplicity sake, but there are six ligands on the edges of the tetrahedral complex.  Problems and limitations  After many decades since its inception, supramolecular chemistry's application in practical catalysis remains elusive. Supramolecular catalysis has not yet made significant contribution in the area of industrial chemistry or synthetic methodology. Here are few problems associated with this field.  Product inhibition  In many supramolecular catalytic systems designed to work with bimolecular addition reactions like the Diels-Alder, the product of the reaction binds more strongly to the supramolecular host than the two substrates do, consequently leading to inhibition by the product. As a result, these catalysts has a turnover number of one and are not truly catalytic. A stoichiometric quantity of the catalysts is needed for a full conversion.  Poor transition state stabilization  Most supramolecular catalysts are developed from rigid building blocks because rigid blocks are less complicated than flexible parts in constructing a desired shape and placing functional groups where the designer wants. Due to the rigidity, however, a slight mismatch from the transition state inevitably leads to poor stabilization and thus poor catalysis. In nature, enzymes are flexible and could change their structures to bind a transition state better than their native form.  Difficulty in synthesis and further adjustment  Syntheses of large complex catalysts are time and resource consuming. An unexpected deviation from the design could be disastrous. Once a catalyst is discovered, modification for further adjustment could be so synthetically challenging that it is easier to study the poor catalyst than to improve it.

Founded in 1997, its headquarters are in Lausanne in Switzerland. History The SCS is an organization created in 1997 by Max-Olivier Bourcoud under the name of Swiss Association for the Protection of Marine Mammals (ASMS in French). Then, in 2001, the ASMS became the Swiss Cetacean Society (SCS).SCS Group Its logo is a whale tale with the initials SCS shown above. The group's goal is the conservation of marine mammals. It holds the conviction that \\"better scientific knowledge of the animals and their environment is essential to ensure efficient protection measures\\". With this aim in mind, the SCS distributes general information about marine mammals, encourages access to specialized training, organizes awareness camps and plans the logistics at sea of scientific and environmental programs abroad. Organization The SCS is a non-profit and independent organization with the aim of promoting awareness of marine mammals in order to encourage their protection. It relies on the contributions of its members and donations. In 2013, the society has more than members. It has become one of the leading providers of cetacean data in the north-western Mediterranean Sea. Furthermore, it is a recognized partner of the Monaco environmental institutions (CIESM,CIESM (The Mediterranean Science Commission) ACCOBAMS,ACCOBAMS (Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans of the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and contiguous Atlantic Area) RAMOGERAMOGE (Agreement between France, Italy and Monaco on the protection of coastal waters)) and the Earth Champions Foundation.Earth Champions Foundation Objective The SCS's aim is to promote knowledge of marine mammals in order to encourage their protection. To achieve this goal, it mainly uses five techniques: * Support for scientific research, mainly logistics at sea for scientific study of cetaceans. * Outreach and spreading of scientific information * Access to specialized training * Awareness of the marine ecology * Scientific expeditions at sea. Activities Abroad Pilot whales during a scientific expedition =Scientific expeditions at sea= The Swiss Cetacean Society organizes worldwide campaigns at sea for data collection on cetacean populations. These scientific programs are co-financed by the Swiss public. The collected data is then transmitted to corporate scientists who ensure its manipulation and analysis. This SCS activity mobilizes research platforms and teams of volunteers supervised by trained naturalists. Three scientific expeditions are conducted at sea annually with the cooperation of eco-volunteers. These are the \\"Mediterranean\\", \\"Bahamas\\" and \\"Azores\\" programs. Mediterranean program Inside of a scientific expeditions boat and its equipment This is an inventory and research program on whales and dolphins in the Mediterranean Sea between Corsica and the French Riviera taking place from late June to early September. During this period, the waters culminate in food biomass attracting several whale and dolphin species in search of food, among which includes a thousand whales and tens of thousands of dolphins. Concretely, the purpose of these scientific programs is to study whale and dolphin populations that frequent the Ligurian Sea and the Balearic Islands in summer to improve their protection. Since 1997, SCS has carried out over days of data collection in the Mediterranean Sea,Description of SCS Activities helped to identify and observe tens of thousands of cetaceans belonging to 8 species and provided offshore work for the benefit of the International Commission for the Scientific Exploration of the Mediterranean Sea (CIESM). In 2011, SCS began collaboration with the Ministry of Environment and Rural and Marine Affairs (MARM) to study the species distribution of cetaceans in the Balearics. Data from this project has also been used by the Conservation, Information and Research on Cetaceans (Circe)Circe (Conservation, Information and Research on Cetaceans) in a broad international and interdisciplinary study of the Mediterranean fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus). Bahamas program This program is in association with the Dolphin Communication Project (DCP)DCP (Dolphin Communication Project) and deals with interactions between Atlantic spotted dolphins (Stenella frontalis) and bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncates). Research investigates group dynamics, population parameters and association, communication and signal exchanges between the two species. Azores program This project in association with the Nova Atlantis foundation deals with the ecology, distribution and reproduction of Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus) off the coast of Pico Island in the Azores Archipelago. =Financial support for various projects= Project on sea turtles in the Comoros Islands Green turtle and an eco-guards in the Comoro Islands SCS in association with the Ensemble Foundation support a program for protection of marine turtles, notably the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) that lays its eggs on the beach of Grande Comore in the Comoro Islands after a long migration of more than km. These sea turtles are considered among the most endangered species on the planet according to the IUCN.UICN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) In order to protect the sea turtle coming to nest on the island, three strategies have been proposed: # An awareness campaign on issues of coastal and marine environments (including the endangered green sea turtle) is conducted for villagers, children and people of influence. # An Information Centre for eco-tourists and villagers for which furniture, posters, flyers and appropriate educational documentation was developed. The centre collaborates with local artisans to sell items related to marine wildlife. This long-term work is expected to create an alternative economic income for the local populations and gradually deviate them from poaching. # A coastal patrol was established. Made up of and carried out by eco-guards who have been trained in monitoring procedures of nesting sites in order to fight against poaching and to collect scientific data on the turtles' activities. Project on Mediterranean monk seal The Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus monachus) is critically endangered according to the IUCN Red List. In the past they were found throughout the Mediterranean Basin. Unfortunately, the monk seal suffered from pollution, depletion of its natural habitat and hunting. Today, only few hundred remain in this basin. Since 2012, with the help of sponsorship and a fundraising campaign, SCS supports the MOm Foundation Foundation MOm (Hellenic Society for the Study and Protection of the Monk Seal) that assumes the responsibilities of the identifying, investigating, treating and monitoring the last Mediterranean monk seals. In Switzerland In Switzerland, SCS aims to promote a better understanding of cetaceans and of their environment, as well as to raise public awareness of the fragility of the marine ecosystem. The educational commitment is of great importance in the local activities of the Swiss Cetacean Society. For example, SCS trains naturalist eco-guides as well as organizes lectures in cetology for adults and children and sets up various educational material and activities for kids and teenagers. Today in Switzerland, SCS is one of the main sources of information on cetaceans and is a specialized information centre serving the public, students, travellers and the media. =Conferences and educational activities= Throughout the year, SCS organizes many conferences for school students and wider audiences, participates in radio and television programs and presents its standpoint in various museums and exhibitions. =SCS Forum= Every first Wednesday evening of even numbered months, SCS organizes a forum at the EPFL. Each forum is subject to a previously defined topic. As of present, topics such as the evolutionary process of the sperm whale, the dangers of plastic waste spread across the oceans, seal protection, the fragility of coral reefs, dolphin hunting, etc. have been addressed. =SCS lectures= SCS in association with √©coOc√©an√©coOc√©an Institut organizes a training course in general cetology over 2 days. Topics such as cetacean species and their ecology, impacts of human activities on cetaceans, as well as technical scientific studies of cetaceans at sea are discussed. =Junior Sea Workshop (‚ÄúAtelier Mer‚Äù)= SCS \\"Atelier Mer\\" Every year, the Swiss Cetacean Society organizes at least one \\"Atelier mer\\" or Sea Workshop. It takes place in the area of the French Riviera and the Corsica and is for troubled 12- to 16-year-olds from specialized institutions in western Switzerland. The purpose of this workshop is to sensitize the youth to the marine ecology. It allows them to: * Discover guided snorkeling. * Navigate on sailboat close to the Mediterranean fauna and flora. * Have a better understanding of the marine animals (biology, particularities, needs) * Analyse the pollution impacts and human activities on the cetaceans and their habitat. * Visualize the functioning of a coastal ecosystem in order to foster a respect for the marine environment * Put into practice valid daily environmentally-friendly gestures at home and everywhere else.

The accusation was made after the events of the crisis of the 30 September 2010. Who are they In Ecuador there is a group of 13 democratic activists who are accused of \\"terrorism\\" and ‚Äùorchestrating a coup against Correa‚Äù on September 30, 2010. The group is composed of people from a wide spectrum of society (academics, professionals, students, religious, military), which include attorney Pablo Guerrero Martinez, student leader Maria Alejandra Cevallos and former Colonel Galo Monteverde, among others. What Los Trece did was to protest peacefully for freedom of expression and awareness among citizens and against the adoption of the new Law on Public Communication, also known as the ' (also known as Gag Law and Citizens‚Äô Security Law). This resembles the one approved by Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, and ended years ago with the closure of several major media outlets. The most emblematic case is that of RCTV. The Ecuadorian ', which nevertheless was finally approved in June 2013, has already claimed its first victims among the media. The latest is the magazine Vanguardia, which for more than seven years was engaged in journalistic research topics. This has just been disabled. Cases like this are several. Thus some international organizations have drawn attention to what is happening in Ecuador on freedom of expression, including the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), the Inter American Press Association (IAPA ), Human Rights Watch (HRW ), Freedom House, among others. What is exactly the case with ‚ÄúLos Trece‚Äù? The September 30, 2010, during the uprising of police in Quito Regiment, which ended with a dozen dead and several injured and arrested, Ecuador channels chained to avoid to make public the details of the events (citation required). Parallel, and as every Thursday, that day ‚ÄúLos Trece‚Äù group carried out a peaceful march to protest against the Ley Mordaza. As they were near (citation required) the channel state ( ECTV ), they decided to go to its site to ask to allow all media to freely disseminate the truth of the facts and not just have the government version (citation required). A confusing situation occurred when the activists entered to the channel as authorities have authorized only 5 of them, while some argued that allowed entry to 13 (citation required). The explosion in the channel was chaotic, a fact that was used by the government to divert attention from the facts of the 30S (citation required). From that moment a fierce propaganda campaign was launched against ‚Äù Los Trece‚Äù, which would be classified as terrorists, saboteurs and later accused of ‚Äù boycott‚Äù of wanting to ‚Äù take the channel‚Äù and finally ‚Äúattempted coup ‚Äù. Freedom of expression under threat Rafael Correa has mounted an apparatus to suppress freedom of expression in order to control opponents and followed emerging as the only possible future for their country (biased information, need quote to describe a politically oriented opinion). Correa maintained a defiant attitude towards the media who question and made it clear that his government considers enemies (citation needed, the following citation is not enough to support the statement). ‚ÄúFrom now on we don‚Äôt send official news to mercantilist media because we do not have (‚Ä¶) benefit the business of six families in this country‚Äù Rafael Correa ordered to the National Communications Secretary Fernando Alvarado (details of the quote needed). By ‚Äúmercantilist‚Äù the President was referring to the private media in Ecuador, to which also often referred to as ‚Äúcorrupt‚Äù, ‚Äúsinister‚Äù or ‚Äúmediocre‚Äù. The president also announced recently that public officials are prohibited from giving statements to private media and that these pre-election months of February 2013, no media can nominate presidential candidates or post pictures that may help or hurt them. But these are only the most recent obstacles that Correa has put in the way of the media since coming to power in 2007. In addition to restricting the contents of the private media, ‚Äúthe government has built one of the largest conglomerates in state media in the region, with 15 radio stations, television, print media and news agency that serve to broaden the point of view of the administration, ‚Äúhe said Semana Carlos Lauria, American coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists. As if the communication network is not enough, Correa chains frequently on radio and television to reach unrivaled citizens. According to El Pa√≠s of Madrid, until May 2011 the president had accumulated 1,025 brands and 280 Saturday programs, called City Link. Correa channels have the distinction of appearing in very specific moments . As the Report of the Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression published in 2011 explains, ‚Äù there have been repeated government disruptions of critical journalistic programs through radio and television presidential channels broadcast the official message only at the station where the information is issued or review questioned. ‚Äù (citation needed) For three days, for example , Correa interrupted the TV show The Breakfast 24 Hours, hosted by Maria Josefa Coronel , who had done interviews that questioned certain constitutional reforms that tried to push belt (citation needed). So did over a program that had Ecuavisa view guest former president Lucio Gutierrez. The government‚Äôs message lasted about ten minutes and went on to criticize this administration . Raul Vallejo, Ecuadorian ambassador to Colombia, explains ‚ÄúIf you say this, we put a string and say ‚ÄòLord , you said that such a thing was so, it is not true , here is shown ‚Äò It‚Äôs a debate . ‚Äù While stringing the media is legal, the report of the Special Rapporteur states that ‚Äù the exercise of this power, however, is not absolute. Governments information transmitted citizenship ( ‚Ä¶ ) must be that strictly necessary to meet urgent needs clear information on matters of genuine public interest. ‚Äù (citation details needed). Cesar Ricaurte , director of the Ecuadorian Fundamedios NGOs , the media says ‚Äù Correa devotes its weekly reports of four to five hours to attack journalists and display photos like the most wanted criminals. ‚Äù (citation details needed). Jaime Ugalde, editor of Ediasa group , was attacked in the street by pro-government supporters after the weekly schedule of Correa , which had strongly criticized journalists and media officials . For three years the government has tried to pass a Communications Law that would expand legal chains and spread them any message. The government presented the project as a means to democratize the media , but according to Lauria , actually it ‚Äúhas proposed creating a regulatory board with broad powers to control the press and determine penalties to alleged violations.‚Äù While the Communications Act still stand by, the president has decided to seek other ways to restrict freedom of expression. Correa has been dedicated to regulate news content with legal maneuvers that let you punish expeditiously and discreetly critical of his administration . The case of the magazine Vanguardia is an example : in 2010 the police raided their offices and confiscated 40 computers Quito to run an alleged debt of $14,000 for the lease of the premises, maneuver repeated, increased in July 2012. And Correa sued to demand compensation of ten million dollars a director Juan Carlos Calder√≥n for having written the book Big Brother, in which he denounced corruption in the presidential family. That demand was recalled to join the legal action for libel against the publisher and a columnist for the Guayaquil newspaper El Universo, Correa decided to ‚Äò forgive ‚Äò to international pressure . Although the crime of contempt is not internationally accepted, in Ecuador ruled a similar figure: the slanderous libel, punishable under the Criminal Code with fines and imprisonment . According to Semana said Asdrubal Aguiar, former judge of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, ‚ÄúStates that are part of the OAS are required to adjust the domestic law to the requirements of the Convention . Which state do not want to set in plane rapist international obligations. ‚Äù But Correa has sued more than 25 people and institutions in the past four years for libel and press offenses . ‚Äù Democratically, what legitimacy your business has a media imposes its view, against a government that has been elected by vote ? ‚Äù Vallejo Ambassador asks, repeating the words of President Correa. For the government, the votes that elected him give superiority to citizens and carte blanche to act as they see necessary. As much as management approval, 74 percent of Ecuadorians also rejects Correa ‚Äòs attacks on the media. Given this figure disapproval, Vallejo says that ‚Äù perhaps disagree on the way he says things, maybe people expected to be a little more friendly . That does not mean there is no press freedom in Ecuador ‚Äù. Also with citizens But even spoken at the polls, citizens rarely manifested in mass in favor of freedom of expression. According to Pachano , this also has a historical explanation: ‚Äù Ecuador does not have the experience of living under a dictatorship and not know what is the suppression of freedoms as outsiders see these issues as a problem of journalists or newspapers owners, and not the society itself. ‚Äù Experience also shows that the problem is far from being one of the journalists. On several occasions the president has ordered to arrest citizens for speaking out against him or his government. In 2011 Marcos Sovenis shouted ‚Äù fascist‚Äù when he walked Babahoyo Correa . As reported Sovenis seven bodyguards of President put him in a van, assaulted and threatened . Ponce also insulted Germ√°n Correa was detained for 72 hours and threatened with imprisonment up to 30 days. The case of Irma Parra is even more drastic : she was detained for hours by making the gesture of ‚Äòno‚Äô to the caravan President, days before proposed by Correa referendum, in which those opposed to the query would vote ‚Äòno‚Äô . The President justified the detention of Parra as needed to respect the dignity of the head of government. Despite the evidence, the government claims that the country has no such problems of freedom. Both the Secretary of the Presidency, Gustavo Jalkh, as the National Communications Secretary Fernando Alvarado, abruptly refused to talk to WEEK . On behalf of his government, Ambassador Vallejo says that ‚ÄùIn Ecuador there is considerable freedom of expression. As wide that tell the president whatever comes to mind.‚Äù And is that the fiercest attacks have begun Correa months before the 2013 elections, which seeks reelection . His strategy of control and repression of the media, along with the expansion of an official communication base, made all the more difficult for a new candidate has a chance of being elected in February. While Correa constantly campaigning, the other presidential hopefuls trying to get out of that shadow and propose a hoarder change. Correa does not hide who wants to follow the footsteps of his friend Hugo Chavez to remain in power indefinitely. Worse, seems unwilling to correct their actions, more similar to the procedures of the 19th-century caudillos that democracy policies consistent with the 21st century. Beyond its borders ‚Äù As if the repeated harassment of journalists and advocates in Ecuador were not enough, Correa has tried to export their policies internationally, trying to subtract powers of the Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression, precisely because this important body has criticized publicly and reason, the questionable record of his government, ‚Äúsaid Jos√© Miguel Vivanco Semana, director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch.

Nickname  New Taipei Municipal New Taipei Senior High School (formerly National San Chung Senior High School)National San Chung Senior High School nickname came from a joke brought up by a school's history teacher in 2002. It came from the school's uniform color-orange. Because the school shares the same short name with Taipei County San Chung Senior High School in Chinese (both San Chung Senior High School, Chinese: ‰∏âÈáçÈ´ò‰∏≠), they have been long confused by people. One day in a class when the teacher taught about Glorious Revolution and King William III of England, who was also Prince of Orange, he joked, \\"Why don't we change the school name to Orange Senior High School for distinction since our students all wear orange uniform jackets? Or St. Orange Senior High School would be even better if we want to emphasize it.\\" Because the joke was so popular, people started to call it St. Orange Senior High School. In addition, students of National San Chung Senior High School often call themselves Little Tangerine for the same reason.  History  Established in 1997, its initial name was Taiwan Provincial San Chung Senior High School (). After the administration of Taiwan Province Government was streamlined in 1998, the School became national and adopted the name National San Chung Senior High School (). In 2007, National San Chung Senior High School had 51 classes (17 classes per grade), including music classes and physical education classes, and more than 2000 students. In 2013, Taiwan Provincial San Chung Senior High School changed its name to New Taipei Municipal New Taipei Senior High School. At present, New Taipei Municipal New Taipei Senior High School has a total of 67 classes (17 classes per grade), including music classes and physical education classes, and more than 2047 students. The school's campus measures roughly 75398 sq. meters.

He served as United States Under Secretary of Commerce and United States Deputy Secretary of Defense under President Harry Truman. Later, he served as the first United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency director, under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. Early life and career Born in Westfield, New Jersey in 1897, Foster attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), studying chemical engineering. While a senior at MIT, he enlisted in what was then known as the United States Army Air Service and served as a combat pilot in World War I.He told a story of how he got his pilots license when there were no instructors. He was a sailor, so he knew the wind upon a sail. An airplane was similar, he said, with the sail horizontal. The first requirement was that you had to obtain an airplane. Then as long as you took off and landed without dying, you were awarded a license. VJF reference. In 1918, he entered the workforce as an engineer for various organizations including the Packard Motor Car Company. In 1922, he went into business for himself as the owner of the Pressed & Welded Steel Products Company. Early government career Following a successful business career, Foster worked closely with the U.S. government during World War II, serving on the New York City mayors' post-war planning committee and as a member of the Purchase Policy Advisory Committee of the Army Services Forces. In 1944, he took office as Deputy Director of the Purchases Division, Army Service Forces. In 1946, Averell Harriman, then Secretary of Commerce, picked Foster to be Under Secretary of Commerce, in part to help with rebuilding Europe after the war. When President Harry Truman launched the Marshall Plan for that purpose in 1948, Harriman became the Special Representative of the effort in Europe and Foster became his deputy. Foster was Administrator of the Marshall Plan (formally the Economic Cooperation Administration) for 1950‚Äì1951. In 1951, as the Korean War raged, Truman appointed Foster to be Deputy Secretary of Defense, under Secretary Robert A. Lovett. Foster played a major role in organizing the Defense Department's procurement for the war. 1950s private sector career Although Foster was a lifelong Republican, he left government when the Eisenhower administration came to office. In 1953, upon deciding to leave his role in the government, Foster accepted the position of President of the prestigious Manufacturing Chemists Association (MCA). During his time there, he proposed a national-level air pollution abatement committee, which eventually led to offices within the government prior to the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency. Foster had long-been a free trade advocate, and eventually left the MCA over its support of tariffs. He served as Executive Vice President and Director of Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation until 1958, and as Vice President and Senior Advisor of Olin Mathieson until 1961. Return to public service In 1961, Foster worked with the Kennedy administration to pass a law creating a new Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, and served as its founding director (1961‚Äì1968). Foster not only directed the agency, but also served as one of the key U.S. arms control negotiators. Having established a good working relationship with his Soviet counterparts, he contributed to the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and the hot-line accord in 1963 and was the lead U.S. negotiator for the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, frequently serving as the U.S. representative to the Eighteen Nation Committee on Disarmament (ENCD). The ACDA under Foster's leadership is widely seen as having been the driving force behind a wide range of disarmament and nonproliferation efforts. Foster left the government again at the end of the Johnson administration. Later private sector career On leaving the government, Foster was convinced that the public and the foreign policy elite outside government needed to have a voice in arms control and nonproliferation issues, and worked with others to found the non-government Arms Control Association serving as its founding chairman. He also served on the boards of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and the George C. Marshall Foundation. He died in 1984.

Mitchell's Hospital, Old Aberdeen, in Old Aberdeen, Scotland, was founded by the philanthropist David Mitchell in 1801 as follows: \\" .. from a regard for the inhabitants of the city of Old Aberdeen and its ancient college and a desire in these severe times to provide lodging, maintenance and clothing for a few aged relicks and maiden daughters of decayed gentlemen merchants or trade burgesses of the said city.. \\". See the text of the 1801 MortificationA Mortification is a legal document in Scots Law that sets out the terms for a gift of money. Mortification has a wide use in terms of bequests.

The Hospital is owned and managed by the University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen City CouncilThe City or Burgh of Old Aberdeen ( founded 26 December 1489) and the \\"Royal City of Aberdeen\\" ( Founded about 1319) were merged into the City of Aberdeen in 1891 and the Cathedral Church of St Machar in Old Aberdeen. The origins of the Hospital are due to various attempts by the Incorporated Trades and Merchants in Old Aberdeen to provide a \\"care home\\" for their elderly and infirm members and their \\"relicks\\".See Aberdeen trades hospitals. From 1801 until the beginning of the twentieth century, the hospital served as a refuge for \\"relicks\\"\\"relick\\" is the Scots/ Doric term for a widow. of Old Aberdeen Trade Burgesses. Mitchell's mortification laid down very specific conditions for eligibility. One of which gave preference in selecting residents to those who had the name \\"Mitchell\\". Originally, the residents lived a communal life with a strict system of management and care.See the book by Katherine Trail for a vivid description of the \\"Founders Dinner\\" - Katherine E. Trail, Reminiscences of Old Aberdeen. [with Plates, Including Portraits.] (Aberdeen, 1932). A Board of Management carried out Mitchell's wishes to the letter. The operation of the hospital has been modified twice in the twentieth century to provide self- contained flats for elderly ladies. However, the original mortification by Mitchell determines its overall operation - within twenty-first century financial constraints.The origins of this hospital may be seen within the context of the medieval hospital - sometimes known as a \\"Maison Dieu\\" - \\"God's House\\", or Bedehouse. The Pre-Reformation sub-monastic life of the residents had disappeared by the beginning of the nineteenth century. However the Auld Maids in Mitchell's Hospital lead a frugal life. History David Mitchell David Mitchell came from a large family in Old Aberdeen. He had nine brothers and sisters.George (16 November 1723); Ann (29 December 1726); Walter (14 July 1728); Mary (b. 15 January 1730: d. ?/6/1807); David (27 September 1731); Isobel (7 July 1733); Alexander (23 March 1737); Margaret (22 December 1742); Elisabeth (2 October 1742); Walter (died 21 August 1728).

It is not until he intimates his wishes to found as hospital in Old Aberdeen that any secure record for him occurs. It is likely he spent his life in Holloway Down in Essex and he owned what was then called Holloway Down Farm. The village of Holloway Down is now in the Leytonstone/Waltham Forrest district of London. It is probable that he was a Stock Broker.The only clear evidence comes from the Deed of Mortification for the Hospital. The Deed was witnessed by Thomas Barnes and Thomas T Ellis from the Stock Exchange, London 15 April 1801). A list of Registered Brokers does not include him or the other names from the Mortification.

A sense of his standing comes from a public notice by an administrator selling his farm lists the farm as follows: > 'Lot 1 A very compact and desirable detached leasehold residence pleasantly > situated on Holloway Down five miles from London on the road leading to > Epping Forrest.

While he did not own a large estate, he appears to have had a very comfortable life as a gentleman bachelor.There is no known marriage certificate or record of a wife or family. Before he endowed the hospital, he acquired a family coat of arms.‚Ä¶ blazoned as Sable a Fess between three Mascles Or in chief a dagger erected point upward proper within a Bordure Argent charged with eight Cinquefoils Gules‚Ä¶\\" with hand holding writing pen.

There is no known link between the Mitchell's of Old Aberdeen and the Stirlingshire family. It appears that David Mitchell adopted the Mitchell of Craigend coat of arms late in life ‚Äì perhaps when he was thinking about his estate and legacy.The Mitchell lair in the cemetery of the parish church of St Machar has the Mitchell of Craigend coat of arms cut on the flat tombstone. See Maxwell, A. S. (1986). Monumental inscriptions, Old Machar churchyard, Aberdeen, Scotland. Aberdeen, The Author. The same coat of arms is seen in the tablets erected in Crayford Church in Kent. The memorial in St Machar Cathedral has words by the minister of St Machar, Dr Skene Ogilvy. The inscription is: \\"Conscientia bene actae vitae multorumque benefactorum recordatio jucundissima est\\" - \\"Awareness of life well spent is a delightful reminder of many benefits\\".

Aberdeen, Printed for the New Spalding Club. and granted an honorary LL D degree from Marischal College in 1801. Early Days of the Hospital On or about 19 November 1800 the Principal of King's College Old Aberdeen, Dr. Roderick MacLeod, received a communication that \\".. an unknown gentleman had an intention of founding and endowing an Hospital for the maintenance of 10 old women of this city ..‚Ä¶\\". This brief entry, in the records of Mitchell's Hospital Old Aberdeen, records the creation the \\"Auld Maids Hospital\\".Volume 1, Sederunt Book, Mitchell's Hospital Archives While David Mitchell was \\".. an unknown gentleman..\\" the proposal was warmly received. The College contacted the Merchant Society, the Magistrates and the Trades Council to seek support for \\"‚Ä¶ founding and endowing an Hospital for the maintenance of ten old women of this city ..‚Ä¶\\". The residents were to be \\".. five aged relicks and five maiden daughters of decayed gentlemen or merchants or trade burgesses‚Ä¶ \\" William Jack, the Sub- Principal of Kings College reported that the Magistrates and Town Council of Old Aberdeen had agreed unanimously that land would be acquired and granted gratis to the College for use by a Hospital. James Stronach, Convener of the Trades Council said they prepared to contribute their share to have a hospital built. James Jaffrey, Clerk to the Merchants Society responded that the Society considered the matter to be of the highest importance and would an appoint members to a committee to further the build of a hospital. In a very short time the idea of a hospital for aged relicks and maiden daughters was turned into practice. Part of the Mitchell's Archive - Sederunt Volume 1 Mitchell gave by Deed of Mortification dated 25 May 1801, the sum of ¬£5500 consolidated 3% Government annuities for the purpose.Consols or consolidated annuities are perpetual bonds issued by the Government that bring a defined rate of return in perpetuity. The UK Government first issued the 3% consols in 1757. Of the total sum the interest on ¬£500 was to be allocated to repairs to the building. The hospital was \\" \\".. for all time is to be called Mitchell's Hospital..\\". The Mortification was a very detailed document that determined how the hospital was to run, who were eligible for residence, what they were to wear and what type of food was to be provided. The selection of residents was very precisely drawn. The Mortification specified that the ladies had to be virtuous and of good moral character \\".. of the names of Mitchell or Forbes in equal numbers‚Ä¶\\".Forbes was the maiden name of David Mitchell's mother. This particular condition was to prove difficult for the Managers to the Hospital to maintain over the years. In addition the residents were to wear \\" gowns of a deep blue colour..\\" resulting in residents being called \\" .. auld maids in blue gowns..\\". The issue of eligibility was an early problem for the Governors. Exceptions were made, in particular for a Christian Mitchell. This lady was not related to the Mitchell family but was a \\"name-daughter\\"Someone named after another person but not necessarily related to them after the founder's mother Christian Forbes. The Governors decided to make an exception for her but not to allow this to be a precedent for others. Along with the Mortification Mitchell executed on 19 August 1801 further detailed Regulations containing minute directions as to the management of the hospital, the admission, qualification, behaviour and even diet of the residents together with the appointment of a governess or matron and the duties of a board of Managers or Trustees.The Managers or Governors were specified as: The Principal, the sub-Principal and Professor of Divinity of King's College; the first and second ministers of Old Machar (formerly St Machar's cathedral); two persons of either sex from the Town Council of the city of Old Aberdeen and the Convener of the Incorporated Trades of Old Aberdeen. The trustees were to be drawn from King's College, the Church of Old Machar, the town council of Old Aberdeen and the Trades Council. Nothing was left to chance. On 5 January 1802, the Trustees met and agreed an advert be placed in the Aberdeen Journal and on the principal gate of the hospital with an entry date set for the last Monday in January, 1802 The Governors met on the 23rd and 25th Of January and admitted nine women. Two of the applicants were rejected \\".. though their moral character, age and indigence was fully ascertained..\\" because they could not provide proof of their husband's link to the Incorporated Trades. The state of one of those accepted, a Mary Weir, underscores the real need that was being met. A minute of the Governor's on 2 February 1802 records that she \\".. came over from the new town in a cart, she being unable to walk on account of the poor state of her health..\\". By 20 May of that year, a Governess had been appointed after a detailed exchange of letters with the founder. Mitchell continued to take a keen interest from where he lived in London about the residents, the building, its insurance and its boundaries until he died in 1803. His immediate family became involved in providing for the ladies and the hospital's organization. Mitchell's nephew, Alexander Mitchell provided a large hand bell and a clock to alert residents to the time for meals and the closure of the doors at night time. His sister Mary was very insistent that a long wooden bench seat be provided in Old Machar Church for the ladies to occupy on Sundays. An unnamed brother provided a large marble table for the dining room. This involvement was to continue after Mitchell's death with marble tablets commemorating his generosity erected in the public room of the hospital and also in the Old Machar church. In addition, horn beakers with silver rims were given to the hospital which were used to issue drinks to the residents. These beakers were used by the \\"auld maids\\", the Governors, the Matron and visitors at an annual Founders Day celebration on 31 December each year.\\"Toasts and Sentiments to be given after dinner at Mitchell's Hospital\\", Framed note hung up in the hospital 20th century The facility was restored in 1924 and again in 1965 to provide self-contained flats for elderly ladies.

She Has been described as a bridge between Norwegian and European tapestry, and several of her weaving designs considered among the best made in recent European textile art. Works of Frida Hansen are in possession of a number of museums, including at the National Museum - Museum of Applied Art in Oslo, Drammen Museum, Stavanger Art Museum and the Nordic Museum in Stockholm.http://erlingjensen.net/Historie/fridahansen.htm Libellenes Dans (1901) Salomes Dans (1900) Early life Frederikke Boletta Petersen was born at Hillev√•g in Stavanger, Norway. Her parents were Mathilde F, Helliesen (1824-1915) and Peter Sickerius Petersen (1811-1875). She grew up in a very wealthy home. Her father was a merchant and head of the J. A. K√∂hler & Co. Before she married, Frida was determined to be a painter, and she received drawing and painting lessons from Bernhard Hanssen, Kitty Kielland and Johan Bennetter. In 1873, Frida married merchant Hans Wilhelm Severin Hansen (1842‚Äì1920), the brother of the painter Carl Sundt-Hansen. When the father of Frida died in 1875 the couple moved into K√∂hlerhuset in Hillev√•g. Frida was eagerly engaged in building a garden on the property. In 1888 the city was hit by an economic downturn. Plough & Sundt, the family business that Hans Wilhelm ran went bankrupt. The husband fled abroad for a few years, and Frida was left with sole responsibility for the family. Two of her three children died. In order to obtain an income, she started an embroidery business in her own home. In the embroidery shop old tapestries were repaired and from doing that repair work she became interested in the ancient techniques that were used to create the images. In 1889 she was a participant in the first course in weaving in the country, hosted by Randi Blehr at Laerdal in Sogn. When the introductory course was given Frida Hansen acquired an Oppstad loom, and she quickly began to create her own images. After a short time she started selling tapestries, and she also had exhibitions in several Norwegian cities. In May 1892 Frida moved to Oslo and founded \\"Atelier for national T√¶ppev√¶ving\\", complete with a dyeing workshop. Her knowledge about dyeing yarn was the basis for the yarn Norges Husflidslag had for sale. Study abroad In the spring of 1895 Frida Hansen was able to go studying abroad, first to Cologne to study medieval art and then to Paris to study life drawing. The impetus she brought from abroad was crucial to her development. In Europe, the prevailing art movement was in the process of change from the national and tradition-bound to symbolism and Art Nouveau (Jugendstil). Det norske Billedv√¶veri Melkeveien (1898) During the period 1897-1906, Frida Hansen ran Det norske Billedv√¶veri, a workshop which mainly worked out of her patterns. At the workshop Frida did both drawing, weaving and teaching. At the World Exhibition in Paris in 1900 Frida Hansen was awarded Gold Medal for her carpet Melkeveien. The carpet was already purchased for the Museum f√ºr Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg. Experimental techniques led to a special transparent weave, which Frida patented. This technique was used to create porters or room dividers. After the turn of the century, Art Nouveau gradually went out of fashion, and by 1920 the art of Frida Hansen was no longer as much in demand. In 1915 Frida Hansen received the King's Medal of Merit in gold for her work as a textile artist. From 1926 until her death in 1931 Frida Hansen worked on the St. Olav wall carpet at Stavanger Cathedral. Frida Hansen died in Oslo and was buried at the cemetery of Ullern Church. Work Semper Vadentes (1905) Frida Hansen's work forms a bridge between Norwegian and European tapestry. Nature was an important source of inspiration, and flowers were special to Frida. She was strongly influenced by the theory of English textile designer, William Morris. Nature was the key which Morris showed conscientiously with abstraction and simplification. When Frida was to abstract a flower, she drew it straight from above or from the side, just as William had done before her. Hansen was particularly concerned that the textiles should not be woven paintings, but should have their own expression. What she and Morris had in common was respect and humility towards nature. Frida was very fond of flowers and her love of flowers is also found in her tapestries. Her tapestries were often faulted for not expressing Norwegian art and culture. In the 1890s and early 1900s, Norwegian nationality was important with art (among other things) identifying the typical Norwegian essence. Frida responded to the criticism by making art that was more international, much as the decorative art of Morris. One of Frida's works hangs in the Royal Palace in Oslo. There are two national rugs designed by Gerhard Munthe, but woven by Frida. Munthe believed that she was the best in the country for the task. Carpets hanging in the castle are from the Saga of Sigurd the Crusader. The design was first drawn on carton and later transferred to the loom. Often a workshop consisted of people with different tasks: one person who dyed yarn and arranged cardboard, and the weaver who transferred to the loom. However Frida did everything herself. Frida was technically adept. She usually created full size cartoons, dyed the yarn and took care of the transfer. References Literature *Knut Berg ed. (1981).

It was the first African American church in Berkshire County, and it was a place where noted Great Barrington native W.E.B. Du Bois is known to have attended services. The Shingle style church was completed in 1887, and continues to serve as a center of African American worship in southern Berkshire County. History African Americans have been resident in Berkshire County, Massachusetts since colonial days. Some were slaves, while others were either freemen or escaped slaves. Prior to the establishment of the Clinton AME church, these people attended church services with the county's white population. After the American Civil War there was an influx of southern African Americans into the area, and an informal AME congregation began to take shape as early as the 1860s. In 1881 this congregation, a mixture of newer southern and older northern African American families, purchased the land on Elm Court on which their church was built in 1887. Difficulties in fundraising delayed the start of construction until 1886, and the church was formally dedicated the following year. The Shingle style structure cost $4,275. Attendees of the church are known to include the future civil rights activist W.E.B. Du Bois, whose uncle was active in the congregation. Its membership is responsible for the establishment of other African American church congregations elsewhere in the county. In 1938, after a successful fundraising campaign, the congregation added a parsonage to the property. The church basement was finished in the 1940s and 1950s to provide a location for social functions, and the church has since then had its original doors and windows replaced, albeit in a historically sensitive way. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Description The basic structure of the church as built in the 1880s was a rectangular block measuring 55' by 24', with a truss roof. The gable ends of the building were shingled with decorative shingles. A tower is attached at the northeast corner of the building, which also provides a vestibule space separating the main entrance from the sanctuary. The sanctuary measures 39' by 24', lined with twenty pews; there are four windows on each side, containing some stained glass decoration. The pulpit, made of ash, stands to the right, while a platform for the choir and organ stands to the left at the front of the sanctuary. The sanctuary walls were originally wainscoted; this work has been covered by paneling. Behind the sanctuary is a vestry room, somewhat altered from the original by the addition of the parsonage in the 1930s. When originally built, the church had a trap door in the southeast corner to gain access to the basement. In 1951 this was replaced by stairs to provide access to the finished basement space. The basement space has a low ceiling, and roughly matches the dimensions of the sanctuary above. A space on the west side of the basement houses kitchen facilities and the church's heating system, which extend to some extent under the parsonage. The parsonage has a basic center hall floor plan, with the living room occupying part of the original church vestry. The second floor contains three bedrooms and a bathroom. The parsonage space is little altered since its construction in the 1930s.

Early years Sealts was born on 8 December 1915, in Lima, Ohio, as an only child to Merton Sealts (1876-1946) and Daisy Hathaway Sealts (1879-1974). His father worked as a salesman for the family business of wholesale grocers. Initially the family lived on 540 West Market Street, but when Sealts was nine years old they moved to a house under construction at 1440 West Market Street, in a new addition called Westwood. Sealts's schooling began in 1921 at Franklin elementary in Lima. In 1929 he enrolled at Lima Central High School, where his principal interest during all four years was in journalism. In 1933 he enrolled at the College of Wooster as a member of the Class of 1937, the first member of either side of his family to attend college. At Wooster he took courses in philosophy with Vergilius Ferm, where Plato became one of his favorites. In his senior year, he took courses on Shakespeare with Howard Lowry, and on Milton with Lowell W. Coolidge. Lowry advised him to study English at Yale, where he enrolled in 1937.Sealts 1999, 34 In his third year, he took a seminar with Stanley T. Williams, who was among the first scholars to teach American literature, a field which had not been formed. Sealts wrote one paper on \\"the intellectual affiliations of Emerson's Nature and another, out of which his dissertation grew, on Melville's major philosophical ideas.\\"Nathalia Wright, \\"Melville and STW at Yale: Studies under Stanley T. Williams.\\" Melville Society Extracts, 70 (September 1987), 3. Retrieved 5 December 2013. Sealts described Williams's seminar in American literature as \\"the most valuable course I took at Yale and the most influential as well.\\" Williams supervised more than a dozen dissertations on Melville, among them Sealts's on \\"Herman Melville's Reading in Ancient Philosophy.\\" His classmates included many of the scholars who would lay down many of the fundaments for Melville studies. Army years In early 1942, Sealts was drafted in the United States Army. After his training, he was stationed in Brazil in 1943, and in New Delhi, India the following year. Scholar Sealts's first publication was an essay on \\"Herman Melville's 'I and My Chimney'\\", which appeared in American Literature for May 1941. In 1965 he joined the faculty at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, where he became the Henry A. Pochmann Professor of English, teaching both graduates and undergraduates. Dissertations on Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne, Melville, and James were among the twent-nine he directed. According to Gail Coffler, one of his Ph.D. students, his own prose is free of \\"jargon or trendy language so that his books and essays have never become outdated nor will they be superseded.\\"Coffler (2000), 120-121 And Melville scholars \\"will always consult Melville's Reading and cite the 'Sealts number'. That will stand.\\"Coffler (2000), 121 Judgments of Sealts's scholarship From 1967 to 1971 Sealts wrote the annual chapters in American Literary Scholarship reviewing the year's publications on Melville. In the chapter for 1974, Hershel Parker called Sealts's The Early Lives of Melville the year's best study: \\"This is a highly significant contribution, a long-needed work which is a model of responsible scholarship, both meticulous and far-ranging, a reproach and an inspiration to the dozens who regularly publish on Melville with none of the respect for truth which pervades this study.\\" In 1980, Sealts published \\"Melville and Emerson's Rainbow\\" (included in Pursuing Melville), which Parker described in his ALS chapter surveying 1980 as \\"one of the handful of classic scholarly essays on Melville, a meticulous, immensely judicious evaluation of Melville's knowledge of and ambivalent response to Ralph Waldo Emerson.\\" In 1982, Robert Milder‚Äîwho was then writing the ALS survey chapters‚Äîcalled \\"Melville and the Platonic Tradition\\", the new essay written especially for Pursuing Melville, \\"a major contribution to our understanding of the influences upon Melville's thought and writing.\\" Sealts contributed an essay on Billy Budd to John Bryant (ed.), A Companion to Melville Studies (Greenwood Press, 1986) which book Parker reviewed in Nineteenth-Century Literature (1988), describing the essay as \\"one of the series of classic pieces Sealts has been publishing pell mell since his retirement, the most impressive string of articles any Melvillean has yet produced.\\" In 1987 Sealts was the main editor of Melville's The Piazza Tales and Other Prose Pieces, which contained the texts of Melville's lectures that Sealts reconstructed in 1957. He also decided what attributed pieces were to be included. Calling Sealts \\"the undisputed authority on Melville's short prose works, and a pioneer in the movement to appreciate their artistic worth,\\" Lea Newman praised his \\"impeccably documented and flawlessly written 'Historical Note'\\" and described his research as \\"an exercise in literary sleuthing of consummate skill,\\" his involvement \\"both informs and validates this edition as nothing else could.\\"Lea Bertani Vozar Newman, \\"The N-N Prose Pieces, etc.\\" Melville Society Extracts 70, September 1987, 14-15. Retrieved on 22 August 2014. In 1988 appeared the revised and enlarged edition of Melville's Reading. In his ALS Melville survey for 1988, Brian Higgins described the book: \\"Sealts's original introductory essay is expanded into nine chapters, relating Melville's reading more closely to the composition of individual works and drawing on Melville's sources beyond the volumes he and his family are known to have owned or borrowed.\\" In his review for the Melville Society, John Wenke ranked the work \\"among the most important and useful contributions to Melville scholarship,\\" because it \\"provides an indispensable point of reference and departure for the practice of serious scholarship.\\" Wenke also found the endeavor \\"inspiring and dignified,\\" and that the book \\"testifies to [Sealts's] abiding dedication to establishing a documentary basis for literary studies.\\"John Wenke, \\"Sealts's Reading.\\" Melville Society Extracts 73, May 1988, 11-13.

Its headquarters are in Roquefort, Lot-et-Garonne, in the French department of Lot-et-Garonne. Its core business is renewable and alternative energy.  History  The company was founded in 2008 by Yann Maus. In 2009, the first production line of 25 MWp photovoltaic modules was inaugurated. The same year, Fonroche Investments, an investment subsidiary dedicated to the production of solar energy, supported its first fund-raising projects.\\"Fonroche Overview ‚Äì Milestones\\" on fonroche.fr/en (consulted 15 November 2013) In 2010, the French investment company Eurazeo become partner of Fonroche capital,\\"Eurazeo beams into photovoltaic greenhouse maker Fonroche deal\\", on altassets.net, 29 June 2011 (consulted 15 November 2013) investing ‚Ç¨50 million over two years. A second production line was launched in Roquefort, allowing the company to increase its production capacity to 90 MWp per year. 2011 was a year of transition for Fonroche. In fact, the group extended its activities to an international scale by opening several subsidiaries in Europe (Switzerland, Spain and Ukraine), in Africa (Benin), in Asia (notably India), in the United States and in the Caribbean (Puerto Rico).\\"Fonroche Puerto Rico solar farm: French Company to invest millions in ernergy project\\", on huffingtonpost.com, 17 November 2011 (consulted 15 November 2013) Fonroche has diversified its activities, extending them to new sources of renewable energy: biogas and geothermal heat. The same year, Fonroche launched a new range of solar products dedicated to public lighting (mostly solar street lamps). In 2012, Fonroche launched a program called \\"New energy to power the future\\".

The whole of its major French industrial site is running on positive energy through the use of many innovative products: LED lighting, autonomous solar lights for the parking lots, heat recovery, photovoltaic roof; the entire installation produces 2.1 MWc.\\"Production ‚Äì Fonroche Plant\\" on fonroche.fr/en (consulted 15 November 2013) The solar panel production factory is also ISO-certified (ISO 14001 and ISO 9001) and has a production capacity of 90 Mwp. This ranks Fonroche as one of the French leaders of solar panel manufacturing.  Activities  The 30th largest company in the French region of Aquitaine, Fonroche has several activities in the field of renewable energy: photovoltaics, off-grid lighting, biogas, geothermal heat.  Photovoltaics  Since its foundation in 2009, Fonroche √ânergie has worked in the production of photovoltaic energy. The company ensures the success of every photovoltaic project, in all its phases: the study, the implementation of the system (power plants, panels, etc.), and its maintenance.  Off-grid lighting  In 2012, Fonroche √ânergie, through its subsidiary Fonroche Environnement Urbain, revealed to the market a range of passive solar lighting, called Illum'in. It is an intelligent photovoltaic candelabra, manufactured in France. It minimizes the impact of public lighting on the environment and enables municipalities to save money, because its requires less maintenance than a conventional, electric, installation. Fonroche has also developed within the same range, solar candelabras dedicated to tropical countries as well as street furniture (range Urb'in) with relocatable anchors.  Biogas  Fonroche is not just specialised in photovoltaics. The company has diversified its activities towards other renewable energy sources such as biogas. It began with this activity in early 2012, signing a partnership agreement with a Danish company specialized in waste-to-energy.  Geothermal heat  Fonroche G√©othermie is positioned on the market of high-temperature geothermal heating. The company started this activity in 2012, projecting to invest about ‚Ç¨400 million over the next 10 years. Since this decision, the company has obtained exploration licenses for two high-temperature geothermal sites. The French government has granted the first license in early 2013 for a site near Pau (department of Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantique, region of Aquitaine); in June 2013, Fonroche also received a second geothermal exploration license, called ‚Äúpermis de Strasbourg‚Äù. As a sideproject, Fonroche is exploring possibilities to mine Lithium from the geothermal brines. https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/lithium-exploration-permit-sought-by-fonroche- geothermie-in-bas-rhin-france/  ISOCEL project  Fonroche √ânergie takes part in the ISOCEL research project,Presentation of the \\"ISOCEL Project\\" on plateforme-canoe.com (consulted 15 November 2013) coordinated by the French chemical company Arkema and by the ADEME (French Environment and Energy Management Agency).

He continued to paint and received a commission from the War Artists' Advisory Committee in May 1942 for a picture. He also painted Janet Vaughan in her role as principal of Somerville College, Oxford. After the war Rogers, and other former members of the Euston Road school, taught at the Camberwell School of Art. Two exhibitions resulted, The Euston Road School and others in May 1948 and a group retrospective which the Arts Council toured in 1948 and 1949. Rodgers worked at Camberwell until 1950 and then taught at the Slade until 1963, when he became the Professor of Fine Art at the University of Reading, a post he held until 1972. Rogers had been the President of the London Group between 1952 and 1955. From 1956 onwards Rogers and his wife owned a property at Somerton in Suffolk and they both painted landscapes in the area.

He was a lineal descendant of Oliver Cromwell. After education at University College School, London, he was taught painting by John Rogers Herbert and John Pye the engraver gave him lessons in chiaroscuro. Making art his profession, he painted outdoor figure subjects and landscapes, especially views of Thames scenery, which were often enlivened with well- drawn figures; he also produced a few portraits. At first he worked chiefly in oil, but subsequently executed many drawings in water-colour. His landscapes and coast scenes show skilful technique. Between 1856 and 1901 he exhibited at the Old Water Colour Society (Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours), at the Royal Academy (where he showed forty-two pictures), the British Institution (where he showed nine pictures), the Royal Society of British Artists, Dudley Gallery, and elsewhere. He was elected an associate of the Old Water Colour Society on 22 March 1880, but never attained full membership. He was also one of the earliest members of the Dudley Gallery, whose first exhibition was held in 1865.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 20, 2002. It is located on Waleska Highway 108, approximately 1 1/2 miles west of Georgia 5/515. It was built as an I-house by Peter Cagle, the younger (b. 1844) and wife, Martha Emeline Carpenter with the assistance of Peter's brothers and their father, Martin. It was modified in the 1930s. It was moved about back from the road in the 1980s, restoring setback lost when the road was widened. with  History  Located in south central Pickens County just north of the Cherokee County line, the Cagle House was built in 1871 by Peter Cagle. In 1839, Peter (b. 1775), hereafter referred to as \\"the elder,\\" and Rachel Cagle migrated from Moore County, North Carolina, to Cherokee County, Georgia, with their four adult children. The Cagle migration was originally intended to continue to Mississippi where the family planned to purchase land and farm cotton, but the Cagles remained in Georgia after spending the winter of 1839-1840 in Cherokee County. There they were employed at Keith Plantation completing work on the plantation house and building furniture. Peter and Rachel Cagle's youngest child, twenty-three year old Martin Cagle (b. 1816), brought his wife Mary O'Brien Cagle (b. 1817) and one- year-old son John with him from North Carolina and settled with other family members on Hickory Log Creek in Cherokee County just north of Canton. Martin worked as a blacksmith, cabinet maker and carpenter, and with his wife raised a family of eleven children (John M., b. 1838, William, b.1840, Lutisha, b. 1842, Peter, b. 1844, Levi, b. 1847, Francis M., b. 1849, Loucinda, b. 1852, Lorinda, b. 1854, Nancy, b. 1855, Mary M., b. 1857, and Fanny I., b. 1859), all of whom, with the exception of eldest son John, were born in Cherokee County between 1840 and 1859. Martin Cagle's four oldest sons (John, William, Peter and Levi) initially claimed conscientious objector status during the Civil War, and as an alternative to serving in the Confederate Army were permitted to work in an iron factory at Lost Town in Cherokee County. When this facility was burned by Sherman's troops, the brothers were advised that they would be given no protection from the Pro- Southern McCollum's Raiders, a terrorist band that robbed and often killed Union sympathizers in Cherokee and nearby counties. John, William, Peter and Levi Cagle, and brother-in-law Zach T. Evans, therefore joined the Union Army and sought protection by moving to Cartersville until the end of the war. Within a few years the brothers began acquiring land in Pickens County, which had voted against secession. Peter Cagle, here after referred to as \\"the younger,\\" married Martha Emeline Carpenter on December 29, 1870. In May 1869, brothers John M. and William Cagle acquired 260 acres of land in south central Pickens County from the estate auction of William J. Nelson. Both men moved to Pickens County sometime during 1869, as they are listed in the 1870 census. In February 1871, Peter and Levi Cagle purchased 130 acres of land from Abraham Crow located just to the west of that previously acquired by their brothers. The Cagle House was built c.1871 by Peter Cagle (the younger) with the assistance of his brothers who were all trained as carpenters as was their father, Martin. That the Cagle House is two stories in height was unusual as Peter Cagle's brothers all built themselves one- story dwellings. The account passed down through the Cagle family is that Peter was trying to impress his father-in-law who owned a large two-story house in Cherokee County. Martin Cagle remained in Cherokee County at least until 1870, as he is listed in the census as residing in Cherokee County that year, but he and his fifth son, Frances M. Cagle, (b. 1849), joined the other our sons in Pickens County in the early 1870s and helped settle the area that soon became known as Cagletown. Peter Cagle (the younger) undertook a fairly diverse variety of farming, as did his four brothers. All acquired additional lands during the 1870s and 1880s, and according to the 1880 census Peter owned a total of 105 acres that year. He had 45 improved acres in 1880, on which he produced 200 bushels of corn, 110 bushels of wheat, 50 bushels of apples and four bales of cotton. He also was recorded as owning 20 chickens, 10 swine, six sheep, two head of cattle and one milk cow, and cut 15 cords of wood on his property. This level and type of production is similar to that of the other four Cagle brothers in 1880, and that year the five brothers together owned a total of 629 acres, all in south central Pickens County. They would eventually own more than 1,000 acres in the Cagletown area. It is difficult to isolate the agricultural and business activities conducted at the various Cagle properties, for the brothers worked together and for all practical purposes functioned as a team in their various undertakings. One of the most important components of those endeavors was Cagle's Mill, located on Sharp Mountain Creek on the property initially purchased by John and William Cagle in 1869. The site became a complex that included a gristmill, saw mill, cotton gin and distillery, which was operated for several years through a license with the Federal government. The Cagles ground mash at their gristmill and produced whiskey that was usually sold in Atlanta. This venture was important to the Cagles for bringing in cash that was used primarily for the acquisition of additional land in the area. Peter Cagle is believed to have owned a greater percentage of the distillery than did his brothers. Remains of the mill complex, located approximately a mile southeast of the Cagle House, are still visible on Sharp Mountain Creek. Peter and Martha Cagle had eleven children, although two died at birth. Their first child, Lewis M. Cagle, was born on October 30, 1871, while their last child, Peter S. Cagle, was born on May 12, 1893, only two years before his father's death. It is therefore likely that all of Peter and Martha Cagle's children, with the possible exception of Lewis, were born in the Cagle House. In 1908 Martin Cicero Cagle, the third son of Peter and Martha, re-acquired his father's property. During the early decades of the twentieth century, the agricultural and business activities at the Cagle House property remained diverse. Martin Cicero Cagle planted cotton and also grew corn and peas and had a variety of animals. The Cagle brothers operated a \\"shop\\" on the opposite side of the road from the house, and this facility was used for blacksmithing work, woodworking and automobile repair. The Cagles were some of the earliest auto repairmen in the area and were known for being able to service the first Model Ts. Cagle Mill continued to operate during this time as well. Martin also worked for a time at the Georgia Marble Company in nearby Tate. In the 1940s the Cagles became some of the first farmers in Pickens County to become involved with poultry production, and to this day several members of the Cagle family remain active in the industry. Martin Cicero Cagle married Annie Townsend and the couple had eight children. Annie died in 1924 and Martin Cicero married Alice Barnett two years later. Martin Cicero Cagle died in December 1956 and gave his second wife, Alice, a life tenancy in the property. When Alice Cagle died in 1969 the property was acquired by three of Martin Cagle's grandchildren, Mary Annie Cagle Parker (b. 1928), Robert Thomas Cagle (b. 1929), and Mildred Sue Cagle Mullinax (b. 1936), all of whom were children of Oman Clyde and Laura Belle Pittman Cagle. The three divided the property, with the Cagle House itself going to Mary Annie Cagle Parker. In 1980 James Thomas Eubanks, Jr., son of Mary Louise Cagle and James Thomas Eubanks, Sr., purchased the Cagle House from Mary Annie Cagle Parker. The Cagle House was purchased by the Mora family in 2018.

Contributions His early numerical calculations (with G. Shaviv) of a rotating gas sphere gravitational collapse (1980) were the first to show that a central object (a star) is formed surrounded by a protoplanetary disk-like nebula, provided turbulent viscosity is included. Together with J.R. Buchler he found a simplistic model of a stellar oscillator that exhibited chaotic pulsation. This oscillator was later found to be related to the Moore-Spiegel oscillator. He was among the discoverers of the advection dominated accretion flows (ADAF) which became a very popular idea in modeling accretion disks around black holes. In his later years he concentrated on theory of accretion disks applying mathematical approximation methods that were novel to astrophysics. He investigated instabilities of accretion disks that may give rise to angular momentum transport, excluding the possibility that the magneto-rotational instability may develop beyond linear stage in thin, disks with very low magnetic Prandtl number as such structures usually are.

They speak Herero (Otjiherero), a Bantu language. History and Culture Etymology While earlier theories of the meaning of the word mbanderu stated \\"People of the reed\\" (mbandu: people and oruu: reed), the explanation common today is that mbanderu literally means 'fighters of old'. Origins Results from investigations about similarities in their music point to East Africa as the origin of the all Bantu tribes that today inhabit Namibia. The Ovambo people left this area first and settled in the north of today's Namibia, the Herero people left after that, and the Ovambanderu migrated last. In the 19th century the Ovambanderu had reached Angola and moved from there into Kaokoland and Ovamboland but got into fights with already resident Herero tribes and subsequently settled in the eastern part of South-West Africa. After reaching the area around Okakarara the Ovambanderu spread out to find suitable pasture for their cattle. Around 1904, after a devastating clash with German colonial forces in Namibia, many of the Mbanderu people settled along the Boteti River around Tsienyane. The area was already settled by other peoples; thus they requested to be allocated their own land where they could practice their own culture without any hindrance. Culture Two important cultural notions among all Herero-speaking groups are ejanda and oruzo. These are generally synonymous with matrilineage and patrilineage, respectively. The recognition of lineal ancestry through both mothers and through fathers is generally known as double descent. \\"Ejanda\\" identity is important in determining who one should marry; two people in exactly the same 'ejanda' should not marry each other. In the past, marriage partners may have been determined at the birth of a girl by her parents. In many cases, the groom was much older than the girl.Double Descent and Its Correlates among the Herero of Ngamiland1 GD Gibson American Anthropologist 58 (1), 109-139\\"Oruzo\\" is associated with traditional religious practice and with political leadership. It is symbolized in part by prohibitions about raising and eating particular kinds of animals. Cattle are central in the economic and spiritual life of Ovambanderu. Not only are cattle a central source of meat, sour milk omaere, and fat (ongondivi), they have also played a symbolic role in the relation of people to their ancestors. In the past, the male head of a residential group conducted rituals at the holy fire ('okuruwo'), for instance, tasting the milk, on behalf of those residing there. Choosing a cow to be used during these rituals was at the discretion of the owner of the cattle. The milk from this cow used could not be drunk by uncircumcised Mbanderu or outsiders. Using dogs and traps are the traditional methods of hunting. Since the 19th century, horses and guns have also been used. Mbanderu people are active in annual remembrance ceremonies held in Namibia and Botswana at the graves of important cultural leaders.Gewald, Jan-Bart (1998). \\"Herero Annual Parades: Commemorating to Create\\". pp. 131‚Äì151.

The company undertook basic and applied research, working directly with large companies across Europe, the United States, and Japan developing software as well as providing training, consultancy and information services. Formation Turing Institute Board Meeting 1984. Left to right: Peter Mowforth, Tim Niblett, Lord Balfour, Donald Michie, and Jim Alty. The Institute was formed in June 1983 by Donald Michie, Peter Mowforth and Tim Niblett. The Institute was named after Alan Turing who Donald Michie had worked with at Bletchley Park during the Second World War. The organisation grew out of the Machine Intelligence Research Unit at Edinburgh University with a plan to combine research in Artificial Intelligence with technology transfer to industry. In 1983, Sir Graham Hills was instrumental in the Institute moving to Glasgow where, with support from the Scottish Development Agency it formed a close working relationship with Strathclyde University. Lord Balfour of Burleigh (Chairman) and Shirley Williams joined the board along with a growing team of researchers and AI specialists. Notable amongst these was Stephen Muggleton who was responsible for work developing Inductive Logic Programming. Professor Jim Alty moved his Man Machine Interaction (HCI) group (later the Scottish HCI Centre) to the Turing Institute in 1984. The move included a significant expansion of the Postgraduate school at the Institute. Jim Alty joined the Turing Institute Board and became Chief Executive. The HCI Centre and the Institute collaborated on a wide range of projects. Training and resource centre The Turing Institute Library with Chief Librarian Julia Wilkinson and Colin Lindsay. In 1984, following the UK Government Alvey Report on AI, the Institute became an Alvey Journeyman centre for the UK. Under the guidance of Judith Richards, companies such as IBM (see:John Roycroft), Burroughs, British Airways, Shell, and Unilever seconded researchers to develop new industrial AI applications. The Turing Institute Library was formed in 1983 and grew by selling access by subscription to its Information Services. The library developed a large searchable electronic database of content from most of the main AI research and Development centres around the world. Library affiliates logged into the system by dial-up and received weekly summaries of newly added items that could be ordered or downloaded as abstracts. The publisher Addison-Wesley developed a close working relationship and published the Turing Institute Press series of books. In 1984, Jim Alty wrote a text book which was adopted by many universities and a much-cited paper on expert systems (with Mike Coombs). Throughout its existence, the Institute organised ran a wide range of workshops and International conferences. Notable amongst these were the Turing Memorial Lecture Series whose speakers included Tony Hoare, Herbert Simon, and John McCarthy. Major conferences included The British Association (147th conference in 1985), BMVC'91, IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control (1992) and the Machine Intelligence Series.  Research and development  The Institute won research funding from the Westinghouse Corporation after it developed a machine learned rule-based system to improve the efficiency of a nuclear power plant. The research funding was used to launch the Freddy 3 advanced robotics project aimed at studying robot learning and robot social interaction. Barry Shepherd developed much of the Freddy 3 software infrastructure. Tatjana Zrimec used the system to investigate how playing robots could develop structured knowledge about their world while Claude Sammut used the system to investigate machine learning and control and helped develop Reinforcement Learning. Ivan Bratko made several visits to the Turing Institute undertaking research in machine learning and Advanced Robotics. Professor Donald Michie teaching a group of Industrial students, 1986 Peter Mowforth with the Freddy 3 Advanced Robotics Facility, 1987 Danny Pearce using HyperLook to help develop a satellite simulation for the European Space Agency in 1988 The Institute undertook several projects for the US military (e.g. Personnel Allocation for the US Office of Naval Research), credit card scoring for a South African Bank and seed sorting for Scottish Agricultural Sciences Agency. Other large projects included the ESPRIT Machine Learning Toolbox developing CN2 and Electrophoretic Gel analysis with Unilever. In 1984 the Institute worked under contract from Radian Corp to develop code for the Space Shuttle auto-lander. The code was developed with an inductive rule generator, Rulemaster, using training examples from a NASA simulator. A similar approach was later used by Danny Pearce to develop qualitative models to control and diagnose satellites for ESA as well as optimising gas flow in the North Sea for Enterprise Oil. Similar approaches based on pole-balancing automata were used to control submersible vehicles and develop a control system for helicopters carrying sling loads. Stephen Muggleton and his group developed Inductive Logic Programming and was involved in the practical use of machine learning for the generation of expert knowledge. Applications included the discovery of rules for protein folding (with Ross King) and drug design as well as systems such as CIGOL that were capable of discovering new concepts and hypotheses. In 1986, Jim Alty's HCI group won a major ESPRIT 1 contract to investigate the use of Knowledge Based systems in Process Control Interfaces called GRADIENT (Graphical Intelligent Dialogues, P600). (with Gunnar Johannsen of Kassel University), Peter Elzer (Clausthal University) and Asea Brown Boveri) to create intelligent interfaces for process control operators. This work had a major impact on process control interface design. The initial pilot phase report (Alty, Elzer et al., 1985) was widely used and cited. Many research papers were produced A follow-on large ESPRIT research project was PROMISE (Process Operators Multimedia Intelligent Support Environment) working with DOW Benelux (Netherlands), Tecsiel (Italy) and Scottish Power (Scotland). In 1987, the Turing Institute won a project to build a large, scalable, network-available user-manual for S.W.I.F.T. The worldwide-web-like system was launched in 1988. Its success as a global hypertext resource for its users led to SWIFT sponsoring the Turing Memorial series of Lectures. The close working relationship came to an end, in part, when a key member of the SWIFT team, Arnaud Rubin, was killed by a terrorist bomb on Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie. One of the strongest business relationships the Institute had was with Sun Microsystems. Sun funded a series of projects where the key Institute Personnel were Tim Niblett and Arthur van Hoff. Several projects concerned the development of new user-interface tools and environments (e.g. GoodNews, HyperNews and HyperLook). HyperLook was written in PostScript and PDB, an ANSI C to PostScript compiler developed at the Institute, and it ran on Sun's NeWS Windowing System. Don Hopkins, while studying at the Turing Institute, ported SimCity to Unix with HyperLook as its front-end. Arthur van Hoff left the Institute in 1992 and joined Sun Microsystems where he authored the Java 1.0 compiler, the beta version of the HotJava browser and helped with the design of the Java language. Throughout the 1980s, the Turing Institute Vision Group developed multi-scale tools and applications. A series of 3D industrial applications were developed and deployed using the Multi-Scale Signal Matching (MSSM) technology, specifically: * 3D head modelling * Robot navigation * Real time robot camera stereo vergence * Terrain Modelling * Scene of Crime capture of 3D footprints for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police * Maxillofacial reconstruction and Denture cast digital archiving with Glasgow Dental School. * Brain model labelling with Guys Hospital * Hyper-resolution methods to improve CCTV image quality for Strathclyde Police * High-speed target tracking for the UK Ministry of Defence * Virtual backgrounds and camera photogrammetry for BBC broadcast TV. * 3D car body shape reconstruction from wax models; Ford Motor Company, Dearbourn, USA. * With Sun Microsystems using a stereo pair of miniature cameras to create and re-project a normalised straight-on view for teleconferencing. Various other robot projects were undertaken at the Turing Institute where key researchers included Paul Siebert, Eddie Grant, Paul Grant, David Wilson, Bing Zhang and Colin Urquhart (e.g. ).

When his parents died, he decided to farm for a while. After he married his wife, Juana Huipi, he returned to pottery, beginning a career making pieces noted for their quality and design. His designs are based on the remains of pre Hispanic pottery he found in the fields, but are modified to be more contemporary. He worked with local clays, mostly reds and whites, using both molds and his hands to shape pieces. The pieces were then burnished and painted, generally with pre-Hispanic style designs, white on burnt orange.

It characteristically used forms based on nature, such as vines, flowers and water lilies, and featured curving and undulating lines, sometimes known as the whiplash line, both in the form and the decoration. Other common characteristics were asymmetry and polychromy, achieved by inlaying different colored woods. The style was named for Siegfried Bing's Maison de l'Art Nouveau gallery and shop in Paris, which opened in 1895, It was usually made by hand, with a fine polished finish, rare and expensive woods, and fine craftsmanship.Lucie-Smith, 160‚Äì162 Luxury veneers were used in the furniture of leading cabinetmakers, including Georges de Feure and others.Gontar, Cybele. \\"Art Nouveau\\", In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000‚Äì. (October 2006) In the early years of the style, Art Nouveau architects often designed the furniture to match the style of their houses. These architects included Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Antoni Gaud√≠, Victor Horta, Hector Guimard and Henry Van de Velde, After 1900, particularly in the furniture designed for the Vienna Secession and the German Jugendstil, the forms became simpler, more functional and more geometric, and some could be produced on assembly lines. Influences Art Nouveau furniture was particularly influenced by the British Arts and Crafts Movement, with its emphasis on fine craftsmanship. It also adapted certain features from earlier historical styles, particularly the curling lines of French Rocaille or Rococo. Another significant influence was Japanese furniture design, which featured light and fragile forms, and marquetry. The Japanesee style had become popular in Europe. in the 1890s thanks to the galleries of Samuel Bing in Paris and Liberty and Company in London and Milan. Belgium The first Art Nouveau houses appeared in Brussels in 1893, including the Hotel Tassel designed by Victor Horta. Horta designed not only he house and decor but also the furniture, which featured the same nature-inspired curling whiplash lines which were featured in the architecture, wrought iron balcony and stairway railings, ceramic floors, and door handles. His lines were inspired particularly by the long curling stems of plants. The furniture itself had a minimum of decoration; the decoration and form merged into a seamless unit. Another early Belgian architect and furniture designer was Paul Hankar, who designed one of the first Art Nouveau houses in Brussels, and, like Horta, used the curving whiplash line in his furniture. Another notable Belgian furniture designer of the early Art Nouveau was Gustave Serrurier-Bovy, who adapted the natural curving forms and added more decoration, applying small brass ornamennts in whiplash lines to his mahogany armoires. Another influential Belgian furniture designer with a very different Art Nouveau style was Henry Van de Velde. He had designed furniture for his own house, Bloemenwerf, near Brussels, in a style influenced by the British Arts and Crafts movement. He had decorated the Art Nouveau shop of Samuel Bing in Paris in 1896, and founded his own workshops in Brussels in 1898. His furniture featured the curving line, but was less exuberant. In 1897 he moved to Germany and became founding member of the German Werkbund and an influential force in German furniture design. in 1897.

After a visit to the Hotel Tassel in Brussels, Hector Guimard created the first Art Nouveau apartment house in Paris, the Castel Beranger, a curious mixture of Gothic revival and Art Nouveau elements. He also began designing sets of furniture with the naturalistic curves and decoration that were characteristic of the style. Guimard declared, \\"That which must be avoided art all cost in anything that is continuous is the parallel and symmetry. Nature is the greatest builder, and it makes nothing that is parallel and nothing that is symmetric.\\" Guimard's furniture, made for his own and other residences, highlighted the curving natural forms and perfectly matched the architecture. Eugene Gaillard and Georges de Feure, showed their work at what Samuel Bing called The Pavillon L'Art Nouveau at the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900, They employed the most expensive woods, primarily from fruit trees, combined with finely made details and curling whiplash lines. They had great success first in Paris, then at the Exposition of the Munich Secession in 1897 and at the Turin International Exposition of Decorative Arts in 1902. The furniture of Gaillard was highly ornate, recalling the French Rococo, while the forms of de Feure, who was a painter and graphic artist, were more subtle, which the Art Nouveau expressed in the upholstery and details. Alexandre Charpentier was a sculptor, medalist, craftsman, and cabinet-maker who was another notable figure in Paris furniture design, and who designed very elaborate ensembles of furniture and carved wood panelling in vegetal themes. He worked with a variety of formats and materials, including tin, marble, wood, leather, and terra cotta Many of his custom designs for fixtures (doorknobs, door plates, window handles) were subsequently mass-produced and commercially sold. Other notable French designers included Henri Bellery-Desfontaines, who took his inspiration from the neo-Gothic styles of Viollet-le-Duc; and √âdouard Colonna, who worked with art dealer Siegfried Bing to revitalize the French furniture industry with new themes. Their work was known for \\"abstract naturalism\\", its unity of straight and curved lines, and its rococo influence. The most unusual and picturesque French designer of early Art Nouveau was Fran√ßois-Rupert Carabin, a sculptor by training, whose furniture featured sculpted nude female forms and symbolic animals, particularly cats, who combined Art Nouveau elements with Symbolism. Another influential Paris furniture designers was Charles Plumet, Through his work the old vocabulary and techniques of classic French 18th-century Rococo furniture were re-interpreted in a new style.Gontar, Cybele.

Both designers based on their structure and ornamentation on forms taken from nature, including flowers and insects, particularly the dragonfly, a popular motif in Art Nouveau design. He especially used the water lily, an Egyptian symbol of eternal nature, which often appeared in sculpted and gilded bronze in the hardware nd decoration of furniture. Majorelle made nature the central element, calling it \\"a collaborator worthy of attention\\", but he also insisted that the structure of the furniture should be clearly recognised, and that the beauty of a piece of furniture came not only from its decoration, but from its elegant lines and correctly proportions. Besides furniture, Majorelle collaborated with the glass manufactory Daum on the design of lamps and other glassware. In keeping with the spirit of the Arts and Crafts Movement, he also established a factory making furniture in series for less wealthy clients. He used machines for the first phases of manufacture, but all the pieces were finished by hand. Other notable furniture designers of the Nancy School included Eug√®ne Vallin and √âmile Andr√©; both were architects by training, and both designed furniture that resembled the furniture from Belgian designers such as Horta and Van de Velde, which had less decoration and followed more closely the curving plants and flowers.

France and Belgium furniture designers took up the style with more enthusiasm than those of most countries.Lucie-Smith, 163‚Äì165 Several notable designers were architects who designed furniture for specific buildings they had also designed, a way of working inherited from the Arts and Crafts movement; these include Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Antoni Gaud√≠, Hector Guimard and Victor Horta. Mackintosh's furniture was relatively austere and geometrical, marked by elongated dimensions and right-angles. Continental designs were much more elaborate, often using curved shapes both in the basic shapes of the piece, and in applied decorative motifs. Germany - the Jugendstil and the Deutscher Werkebund In Germany, the furniture of early designers of the Jugendstil, or \\"Young Style\\", such as Otto Eckmann displayed what was called the \\"floral\\" period of the Jugendstil. These pieces had natural curves and motifs popular in French Art Nouveau. However, the furniture of Peter Behrens was in sharp contrast with French Art Nouveau; The influence of nature and natural motifs, such as flower stems and lily pads, the primary element of French Art Nouveau furniture, almost disappeared This ugendstil was rationalist, with geometric straight lines and a bare minimum of decoration. Behren's goal was exactly the opposite of French Art Nouveau; simplicity of structure and simplicity of materials, for furniture that could be inexpensive and easily mass- manufactured. He helped launch the Deutscher Werkbund, a workshop of artists in Munich to produce the new designs. At various times several leading modernists, including Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius) worked for Behrens. He wss a founder of the Darmstadt Artists' Colony, located near Munich, and became a key figure in the transition from Art Nouvau to modernism. The Belgian designer Henry Van de Velde was already known in Germany for his early Art Nouveau designs. In 1899 he settled in Weimar, Germany, where in 1905 he established the Grand-Ducal School of Arts and Crafts, under the patronage of the Grand Duke of Weimar. It was the predecessor of the Bauhaus, the birthplace of modern architecture. Van de Velde became active in furniture design and decorative arts. In 1907 he became a founder of the Deutscher Werkbund, producing a wide variety of furniture in Weimar and other industrial cities. Another notable Munich Jugendstil furniture designer was Bruno Paul, who became known for his rectangular, geometric style, with slight curves and no external decoration. His students also included the young future architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. He won recognition for his work at the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900. The Munich artist Bernhard Pankok, known primarily as an illustrator, also created innovative furniture designs, with stylized lines that simplified the French style. His furniture and book designs also won him recognition at the 1900 Paris Exposition. Richard Riemerschmid, a Dresden artist and designer, was another influential Munich Jugendstil and a founder of the Deutscher Werkbund. He was also known for his clean, perfectly functional pieces of furniture, with no ornament outside of their form, helping open the way to modernism. He also had a notable career as a decorative painter, becoming a prominent figure in the symbolist movement. Other important figures included Jugendstil furniture included August Endell, Theodor Fischer Otto Eckmann, and the Austrian Joseph Maria Olbrich.

By the 1890s Glasgow was a major seaport and prosperous industrial center, and it aspired to have a distinct cultural identity. Two former students of the Glasgow School of Art, the designers Charles Rennie Mackintosh and his wife, Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh, helped establish that identity. The furniture Mackintosh designed was inspired by Arts and Crafts, austere and geometrical, with long straight lines and right angles, to which MacIntosh and his wife added touches of Art Nouveau decoration, using painted wood, marquetry of enamel and stained glass and fabrics such as painted silk. His major project, commissioned in 1897, was a remaking of the school building and its interiors, for which the two Mackintoshes created the architecture, decoration and furniture. The furniture and decor of Willow Tea Room of the school became a popular symbol of the Glsgow style; it influenced artists of other schools, particularly the Vienna Secession, which invited Mackintosh to exhibit his work.

The primary features of the furniture were geometric forms, a minimum of decoration, and a break away from historic models, though it sometimes adapted features from traditional styles, particularly the Biedemeier style. Wagner's furniture was particularly modern; he was among the first to incorporate new materials such as aluminium into his furniture designs. Josef Hoffmann was another major figure in the Secession. In 1903, along with Koloman Moser, he helped launch an even more ambitious project, the Wiener Werkst√§tte, an enterprise of artists and craftsmen working together to create all the elements of a complete work of art, or Gesamtkunstwerk, including furniture with very modern geometric designs. One of his most radical creations was the Sitzmachine adjustable-back chair, created in 1905. Hoffmann's method was to produce a \\"total work of art\\". He introduced similar and harmonized motifs, especially squares and cubes, into the metal, glass, jewellery, leather, textiles, and furniture. His timing was perfectly in sync with the transition from Art Nouveau to Modernism. He introduced the Kubus armchair in 1910, just as the first major works of cubism by Picasso and Georges Braque appeared in Paris.

He denounced the 19th century as \\"the century of ugliness\\", and wrote that \\"When you observe the interiors of homes, you can only shudder at the bric-a-bra the new call an interior.\\" He designed several notable buildings, including the Beurs van Berlage (1896-1903) in his distinctive geometric constructivist style. One of his doctrines of furniture construction was to respect the nature of the material; he refused to shape wood into curving forms, since wood, he said, should not be treated as if it were metal. Decoration was provided in his furniture through metal ornaments, but even these disappeared, and his chairs and other pieces became wholly geometric. The definitive transition of the nature-inspired Art Nouveau furniture to the geometric, purely functional De Stijl came in 1917, in the furniture of Gerrit Thomas Rietveld, particularly the Red and Blue Chair.

An important center of the new style was the city of Turin, which in 1902 hosted a major exposition, Turino 1902, devoted to \\"the International Decorative Arts of the New Century\\". The dominant figure in Italian furniture design and star of the 1902 Turin Exposition was Carlo Bugatti, the father of the celebrated automobile designer Ettore Bugatti. His pieces of furniture were in exactly the opposite of the geometric and functional furniture of the Jugendstil and the Vienna Secession They were essentially works of sculpture and decoration; their function, whether as a chair or cupboard or a dining room table, was entirely secondary, His works included the Snail Chair, wood covered with painted parchment and copper, and an extraordinary sofa of wood and parchment, decorated with paint, fringe, and incrustations of brass. The spaces for seating were almost entirely hidden by the decoration. Eugenio Quarti of Milan was another figure of note in the Italian style. After an apprenticeship in Paris and working a brief time for Carlo Bugatti, he opened his own shop and atelier and produced models which won recognition at the Antwerp Exposition of 1894 and the first Turin Exposition in 1892. He enlarged his firm in 1904 and produced furniture for important Italian clients. His work was much simpler in style than that of Bugatti, but he also sought to create unusual forms and materials, and delicate designs from inlays of brass and abalone shell.

The furniture designer Gaspar Homar I Mezquida designed furniture that was inspired by natural forms, featuring the curving lines of the French and Belgian Art Nouveau, with touches of Catalan historic styles. The furniture of Gaspar Homar I Mezquida features fine marquetry inlays of colored woods.

He also designed some chairs and other pieces of furniture. Some of the chairs were overloaded with decoration and embroidery, but others were finely made and discreetly decorated with geometric inlays in the wood. In the United States, new furniture design at the beginning of the 20th century was largely inspired by the British Arts and Crafts Movement, which in turn inspired The American Craftsman style, the American Arts and Crafts movement, One designer who introduced Art Nouveau themes was Charles Rohlfs in Buffalo, New York, whose designs for American white oak furniture were also influenced by motifs of Celtic Art and Gothic art, with touches of Art Nouveau in the metal trim applied to the pieces. In California the architects Charles and Henry Greene experimented with eclectic styles, then gradually developed their own distinct California version of the American craftsman style with simple geometric forms, little ornament, fine woodwork and a distinct Japanese influence. The most famous example is the Gamble House in Pasadena, California. Frank Lloyd Wright is not considered an Art Nouveau architect, but the early furniture he designed strongly resembled the geometric furniture of the Vienna Secession and other late Art Nouveau movements of the same period.

In addition to smaller businesses, it houses the Mahaiwe Performing Arts Center, the town's only major performance space. It has been in virtually continuous operation since its construction in 1905. The building is located at 6-14 Castle St. and 314-322 Main St, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The building's condition and fate in the 1990s was a major contributing factor in the establishment of local preservation ordinances. The building takes its name from an earlier structure on the site, which its owner called \\"Mahaiwe House\\". History The Performance Center opened in September 1905 as a vaudeville house, it became a movie theater in the mid 1920s. The last company that showed first run films there, the Hoyts Theater chain, sold it to the Berkshire Opera Company and today shows classic films.Cinema Treasures Architecture The Mahaiwe Block is a roughly rectangular three-storey building, presenting long facades to both Main and Castle Streets. Its exterior is finished in pale brick, with marble trim elements and a pressed metal entablature. White marble belt courses separate the floors. The Main Street facade includes two storefronts and an Art Deco building entrance, the product of a 1929 remodeling by a banking tenant. The Castle Street facade has a row of round-arch windows, three commercial storefronts, and the main entrance to the theater. The theater entrance has three sets of double doors, set in a large two-story round-arch opening, which is sheltered by the theater's 1930 marquee. The marquee is supported by chains and has a scrolled top. The street-facing portion of the marquee bears the theater's name in illuminated letters, a detail repeated in compressed form on the sides, above the panels showing the facility's current offerings.

The Government Accountability Office and the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General each found that the TSA's lack of a technology acquisition plan led to waste, excessive costs, and security failures. This bill was written in response to these findings. In addition to requiring the creation of a plan, the bill would also require the TSA to report what it does to Congress, including providing information about failures it makes. It passed the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Transportation Security Acquisition Reform Act would amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to develop, and update biennially, a strategic multiyear technology acquisition plan, which may include a classified addendum to report sensitive transportation security risks, technology vulnerabilities, or other sensitive security information. The bill would direct the Administrator to analyze the TSA's acquisition of any security-related technology to determine if it is justified. It would require the Administrator, 30 days before any TSA award of a contract for acquisitions exceeding $30 million, to report to Congress the results of the analysis and certify that the security benefits justify the contract cost. The bill would direct the Administrator to establish certain performance baseline requirements before any TSA security-related technology acquisition. It would require the Administrator to review and assess each acquisition for meeting the baseline requirements and to report those results to Congress. The bill would require the Administrator, before the procurement of additional quantities of equipment to fulfill a TSA mission need, to utilize, to the extent practicable, any existing units in the TSA's inventory to meet that need. The bill would direct the Administrator to report annually to Congress on TSA's goals for contracting with small and disadvantaged businesses. The bill would direct the Comptroller General to evaluate, and report to Congress on, TSA's progress in implementing the plan. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Homeland Security on October 29, 2013. This is a public domain source. Based on information from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 2719 would have no significant cost. Enacting H.R. 2719 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 2719 would specify procedures for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to follow when planning, making, and evaluating acquisitions of security-related technology. The bill would require the agency to develop a multiyear investment plan to be transmitted to the Congress and updated every two years. The bill also would specify analyses and reports that TSA must complete to justify certain investments, evaluate the performance of technology acquired under the bill, and enhance its capacity to monitor and utilize existing inventories of security-related equipment. In addition, H.R. 2719 would direct the GAO to review and report on issues related to the TSA‚Äôs policies for procuring security-related technology. According to the DHS, the bill‚Äôs requirements are largely consistent with existing DHS procurement policies that already apply to the TSA. The legislation would not affect the TSA‚Äôs underlying mission or responsibilities, and the CBO estimates that meeting new procedural requirements specified by H.R. 2719 would not impose any new significant costs on the agency. We also estimate that any increased costs to GAO to complete reports required under H.R. 2719 would be negligible, assuming the availability of appropriated funds. H.R. 2719 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The Transportation Security Acquisition Reform Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on July 18, 2013, by Rep. Richard Hudson (R, NC-8). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Homeland Security and the United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Transportation Security. It was reported (amended) alongside House Report 113-275. On November 27, 2013, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced the H.R. 1095 would be considered on the House floor on December 3, 2013. The House voted on December 3, 2013 in Roll Call vote #616 to pass the bill 416-0. Debate and discussion According to the House Homeland Security Committee, the bill was needed in part to address criticism that had been made of the TSA by private sector technology companies. These private sector businesses said that the lack of long-term investment plans and poor communication from the TSA made it difficult for them to determine what technologies they needed to invest in in order to meet the TSA's needs. The bill's sponsors also criticized the TSA for having \\"repeatedly purchased and deployed equipment that was not properly tested or failed to meet performance objectives.\\" Improving the acquisitions process, as this bill intends to do, will make better use of the TSA's budget and improve security, according to supporters. An April 2013 report from the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General indicated that the TSA had 17,000 items with an estimated cost of $185.7 million stored in its warehouses on May 31, 2012. The auditors found that \\"TSA stored unusable or obsolete equipment, maintained inappropriate safety stock levels, and did not develop an inventory management process that systematically deploys equipment.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Transportation Security Administration Notes/References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 2719 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 2719 *GovTrack.us H.R. 2719 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 2719 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 2719 *House Republicans Conference's legislative digest on H.R. 2719 *House Report 113-275 on H.R. 2719 *House Homeland Security Committee Hearings *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 2719 Acts of the 113th United States Congress Transportation Security Administration ","title":"Transportation Security Acquisition Reform Act"},{"id":"41268498","text":"Dream Chamber is a point-and-click adventure game, in the third person, for iPhone, iPad, Microsoft Windows, Mac, Android, developed by DarkWave Games and published by Anuman under their Micro√Øds brand. The first episode, developed with Unity, was released worldwide via digital channels on 24 October 2013. The game is set in the America of the Thirties, characterized by Prohibition and Great Depression. The player must assume the role of Charlie Chamber, a rich and bored inheritor spending his time with the social obligations of the smart society, as well as with his hobby of being a private detective. Although he is no professional, Charlie has an advantage: while dreaming he can go back to the places he visited, finding new clues which he had perceived only subliminally while awake. Moreover, while dreaming Charlie is able to face his own subconscious, embodied by Charles. The game goal is to solve the cases investigated by Charlie. Dream Chamber is intended as entertainment with an artistic value: the developer has declared that all the artwork has been hand-drawn and the soundtrack, a mix of swing and jazz pieces, is fully original, recorded in a studio. The story, the setting and the style draw on the noir/hardboiled fiction genre, played in an ironic key, mostly through the features of the main character. Dream Chamber is dubbed in English and subtitled in English, Italian, French, Spanish and German.  Synopsis  While attending the umpteenth opening evening of a museum (which, by the way, he has supported with a substantial donation), Charlie witnesses a theft. The victim is no one else but his girlfriend Teleta, who offers to hire him to retrieve the stolen goods. Despite the opposition of his uncle, the police inspector in charge of the case, Charlie accepts and, unknowingly, embarks (just for ennui) in the greatest adventure of his life. What looked like a trivial theft as a matter of fact will become more complicated, involving Charlie's own life and that of his family since the death of his parents when he was a child.  Gameplay   Goal  Dream Chamber is a point-and-click 2D graphic adventure, in the third person. It follows a well established pattern: the player moves through a number of surrounding environments by tapping on a screen or clicking with a mouse; by tapping or clicking it is also possible to interact with the play scenery. The objects picked up may be used by opening a hidden inventory and carrying them into the play scenery. The main goal of the game is to solve a case of theft, collecting clues and proofs and marking them down on a notebook (which automatically records every substantial progress in the game; the player can consult it at his pleasure). According to a widespread tradition of adventure games, to reach the goal it will be required to talk to the characters, to collect, combine and use objects, to solve puzzles, to complete minor games. Two recurrent gameplay elements mainly characterize Dream Chamber: the running of the dream and the battle-questioning.  The Dream  The running of the dream is such a primary matter as to be recalled in the name of the game. \\"Dream Chamber'\\", in fact, means \\"chamber of the dream\\" as well as \\"dream, Chamber\\" (the second name of the main character). By getting Charlie asleep, the player can go back to the places visited by him, enabling him to find new clues which he had perceived only subliminally during the day. Moreover, while dreaming Charlie will be able to visit Charles, his own subconscious, who can provide him with additional information.  The Battle-questioning  To get information from the game characters Charlie, who easily gets bored and has difficulty in focusing on cases, has overcome those issues by a trick: he envisages the questioning as an assault on a castle; if Charlie manages to conquer the castle he will obtain the information he needs. When the player needs information from a game character, he enters the \\"battle-questioning\\" interface: N cannonballs are available (one for each statement by Charlie) to shoot down the \\"castle\\" of the opponent, by hitting his weak points. Although not well understood by some reviewers,\\"Dream Chamber never makes it clear which statements were effective and which were brushed off, and sometimes you're given the chance to ask the exact same question in three almost indistinguishable ways.\\" dynamics has to be taken into account among the game symbols: in the \\"battle-questioning\\" the point is not \\"what\\" one says, but \\"how\\" he says it; \\"how\\" is represented both by Charlie's tone and by the strength of the blow dealt to the \\"enemy fortress\\"; the \\"fortress\\" symbolizes the willpower of the opponent; the choice of the point of impact, in turn, represents the ability of striking the right points to get others do what we want.In-game instructions  Reception   References   External links  * 2013 video games Video games developed in Italy Micro√Øds games Adventure games Android (operating system) games IOS games MacOS games Windows games ","title":"Dream Chamber"},{"id":"41268517","text":"Medak Gulshanabad Division was administratively part of the Hyderabad State was made up of sixteen districts.

Background In the spring of 2011, while still a student at Edward R. Murrow High School in Brooklyn, New York, Capital Steez had a performance at a local cafe, with friends including Powers Pleasant, Joey Bada$$ and Dirty Sanchez also in attendance to show him support. On their way home from the performance, he and Powers Pleasant came up with the idea of forming a hip hop collective, which they named \\"Progressive Era\\", or \\"Pro Era\\" for short. In April 2012, Capital Steez released a mixtape entitled AmeriKKKan Korruption to critical acclaim, before following it up with a re-release of the mixtape entitled AmeriKKKan Korruption Reloaded in October 2012. On December 21, 2012, Pro Era released a collective mixtape entitled Peep: The Aprocalypse before Capital Steez took his own life two days later, jumping off of a building in the Flatiron District of Manhattan. In May 2015, Joey Bada$$ announced that Pro Era would hold a Steez Day Festival in his memory to be held annually on his birthday, July 7, with all proceeds going to his family. Production In an interview with XXL in April 2013, CJ Fly stated that Capital Steez had been working on the album before his death, adding that he recorded songs on instrumentals made by other producers, saying: \\"What we wanna do is ‚Äì he did it on some unoriginal beats, [so now] we wanna get the beats made over so we can get the album sold. Give the proceeds to the family. The same thing that he would‚Äôve done if he was here; help his family.\\" Release and promotion In April 2013, Joey Bada$$ announced King Capital as a mixtape set to be released that summer, while his own debut studio album B4.Da.$$ (which wasn't released until January 2015) was set for release that fall. The same month, CJ Fly stated in an interview with XXL that the album may be Capital Steez's last release, saying: \\"I think this might be the last [project] because we don't have that much material of his. [He only] recorded that project. Unless we find hidden verses that he recorded somewhere else, which is likely to happen, they might drop the EP but there's no hidden verses that were there.\\" On July 8, 2013, Pro Era released the album's lead single \\"King Steelo\\", but the album itself remained unreleased. In an interview with Rapfix Live on MTV in January 2014, Joey Bada$$ stated that Pro Era was compiling songs that Capital Steez left behind and building an album from them, adding that they were taking their time to get it right: \\"The thing is with that, it's so great, it's so classic, we just feel like we need to do more with it. We can't just like drop it as a mixtape; it deserves way more than that.\\" In another interview with The Stranger in June 2015, he responded to growing pressure from Pro Era fans for King Capital's release, stating: \\"People got to be patient and understand that we're trying to do the best we can for that project. It's easy to just put songs out, but why would we do that when these are the last songs he had?\\" In April 2016, Nyck Caution also responded to the pressure, stating: \\"People don't understand that it's being worked on, but it's not something that's finished and ready to come out. [‚Ä¶] People think we're holding onto it for whatever reason. It's the last recording. We're trying to find as many [tracks] as we can.\\" In an interview with Revolt on June 1, 2017, Joey Bada$$ revealed that King Capital, as well as a new Pro Era album, were \\"coming real soon\\", confirming later on that both projects would be released in 2017. On July 7, 2017, at the third annual Steez Day Festival, Joey Bada$$ revealed that King Capital would be released on December 23, 2017, the fifth anniversary of Capital Steez's death. However, on December 12, 2017, Joey Bada$$ announced on Instagram that the album's release would be delayed until further notice due to \\"business legalities and sample clearances.\\" Confirmed tracks * \\"King Steelo\\" was released as the album's lead single on July 7, 2013, as a free download on SoundCloud.

It is a junction station at the intersection point of the Mumbai-Chennai line and the Latur-Miraj line. History Starting with the first train in India from Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus in Mumbai to Thane on 16 April 1853 on a track laid by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, Pune was linked with Mumbai with the completion of the railway track across the Bhor Ghat incline between Palasdari to Khandala in 1862. GIPR extended its line to Raichur in 1871 and met the line of Madras Railway thereby establishing direct Mumbai-Chennai link. The Pune-Raichur sector of the Mumbai-Chennai line was opened in stages: the portion from Diksal in Pune to Barshi Road was opened in 1859, from Barshi Road to Mohol in 1860 and from Mohol to Sholapur also in 1860. Work on the line from Sholapur southwards was begun in 1865. Barsi Light Railway was a long, wide railway from Kurduvadi to Latur. It was opened in 1897 on a long railway track from Barsi Road to Barsi, and extended in stages. The narrow gauge line from Barsi Road to Pandharpur was extended to Miraj in 1927. Gauge conversion from to of the Miraj-Latur track and extension of the new line to Latur Road was taken up in 1992 and completed in stages. The last phase of the long project was completed in 2008. Amenities Kurduvadi railway station has a public call office booth with facilities for subscriber trunk dialling, refreshment stalls serving vegetarian and non-vegetarian food, retiring room, waiting room, and book stall. Workshop Kurduvadi Workshop was set up for repair of narrow gauge steam locomotives, coaches and wagons by Barsi Light Railway in 1930. With the reduction in narrow gauge rolling stock, the Workshop has taken up new activities as per requirements. Kurduvadi Workshop now undertakes rehabilitation of 20 broad gauge wagons per month. Kurduvadi had a narrow gauge diesel loco shed for Barsi Light Railway. The shed was closed down after conversion of the narrow gauge railway. Electrification The Pune-Solapur- Wadi line is being electrified with a loan of Rs. 1,500 crore from Asian Development Bank. Work was initiated in 2012. Track doubling The railway track in the Daund-Wadi sector is being doubled at a cost of Rs. 700 crore. The railway track in the Kurduwadi-Latur Road sector will be doubled at a cost of Rs. 700 crore.

R. Martin, published in the 2013 Tor Books anthology Dangerous Women. Set in the Westeros of Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, 200 years before the events of A Game of Thrones (1996), it chronicles the \\"continent-burning warfare\\" (called the \\"Dance of Dragons\\") that explodes between Targaryen Princess Rhaenyra and her stepmother, Queen Alicent. The work is presented as the writing of the fictional Archmaester Gyldayn, also the \\"author\\" of Martin's 2014 novella The Rogue Prince, a direct prequel to The Princess and the Queen. Plot When King Viserys I Targaryen dies, his widow Queen Alicent has their eldest son Prince Aegon crowned King Aegon II before Viserys' daughter Rhaenyra, the only surviving child of his first marriage, can claim the Iron Throne herself. Though Rhaenyra is the king's oldest child and had been named his successor years before, Alicent and her supporters declare Rhaenyra unfit to rule and argue that, as a woman, Rhaenyra should be placed after Alicent's own male children in the line of succession. After Rhaenyra declares herself Queen at the Targaryen ancestral seat of Dragonstone, her middle son Lucerys Velaryon and King Aegon's younger brother Aemond take their dragons to seek the support of Lord Borros Baratheon of Storm's End. However, Lucerys and his dragon are killed there. Rhaenyra's husband Prince Daemon has Aegon II's son and heir Jaehaerys murdered in revenge. Soon both branches of the Targaryen royal line are at war, with dragons on both sides. The people of King's Landing, tired of the constant conflict and fear of dragons destroying their city, storm the Dragonkeep, destroying it and a large portion of the dragon population in Westeros. Eventually, all of Rhaenyra's children, except for Aegon and Viserys, are killed and she herself is captured by Aegon II and fed to his dragon, Sunfyre, though the war continues. Development The story was to be included in the companion book The World of Ice & Fire but was removed because the book was becoming too long for the original concept of a fully illustrated book. It and several other stories appeared in abridged versions in other anthologies. Reception Entertainment Weekly called the 35,000-word novella \\"a great demonstration of Martin's ability to dramatize the slippery complexities of power: how evil begets heroism, how heroes become villains\\".

He was of German descent. The Canadian Archaeological Association referred to him as the grandfather of archaeology in British Columbia and especially regarding prehistory and early history and rendered outstanding services to British Columbia. The Borden System was used on all archaeological sites. Borden deemed the Milliken site in the Fraser Canyon, with finds dating back about 9500 years old, making it the oldest known settlement at the time, therefore the most important of the excavations at sites. In 1951 Borden received funding from Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan), and the British Columbia Ministry of Education to undertake salvage archaeology at the Carrier Indian site. The construction of the Kemano power reservoir resulted in imminent flooding of a large part of Carrier hunting territory in Tweedsmuir Park. In 1951 Borden began survey and excavation of the site and returned to work there every summer until he retired in 1970. His final article published in Science in 1979 was based on excavations of early microblade assemblages at Namu in 1977. From 1948 to 1957, Borden excavated material and undertook salvage archaeology projects in the 1950s and 1960s at the Marpole Midden, also known as Great Marpole Midden. Borden \\"was the first to draw links between contemporary Musqueam peoples and excavated remains.\\" At the time of his death, however in 1978, in spite of his best intentions, all of the Marpole material was in storage and still required \\"full description, quantification and publication of the original data\\" on which they were based. Early life Borden left the United States with his mother, when she was widowed taking her infant son to join her family in Germany. In 1927 American authorities helped him to return to the United States. He majored in German at the University of California at Los Angeles and received his A.B. in 1932. He then studied at University of California at Berkeley earning his M.A. in 1933 and his Ph.D. in 1937. His first teaching position was at Reed College in Portland.

He was best known in London for his original mezzotint engravings of landscape, and exhibited at the Royal Academy and the Royal Society of Painters, Etchers, and Engravers. When he moved to Towyn in northern Wales he painted numerous landscape paintings of places in the Capel Curig area, such as Snowdon. He was headmaster of the Liverpool Mechanics Institute and School of Art from 1855 until 1896. Several paintings related to him are on display in the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool and the Portsmouth Museum. Biography He was the son of John Finnie, brassfounder, by his wife Christian Mclndoe. He was born at Aberdeen, where he was baptised in the parish church on 4 May 1829. After serving apprenticeships to a house-painter at Edinburgh and a japanner at Wolverhampton he obtained employment with William Wailes, a glass-painter at Newcastle, where he remained five years, attending the school of design under William Bell Scott. In 1853 he went to London, where he studied and taught in the Central School of Design at Marlborough House till, in 1855, he became master of the School of Art, then called the Mechanics' Institution, at Liverpool. In this position he continued forty-one years and six months, retiring at Christmas 1896. He is described as the dominating personality in the art life of Liverpool during that period. He began to send to the Liverpool Academy-exhibitions in 1856, became an associate in 1861, a full member and trustee in 1865, and was president of the academy in 1887-8. He was also president of the Artists' Club and of the Liver Sketching Club. His earliest etching, the 'Head of Windermere,' dates from 1864. After some early experiments in etching and engraving Finnie adopted mezzotint as his favourite process in 1886. Though he exhibited pictures at the Royal Academy from 1861 onwards, and also at the British Institution and in Suffolk Street, he was best known in London by his original mezzotint engravings of landscape, exhibited at the Royal Academy and the Royal Society of Painters, Etchers, and Engravers, of which he became an associate on 24 October 1887, and a fellow on 6 April 1895. He sent forty-seven contributions in all to the society's gallery. His etchings and mezzotints, which are represented by specimens in the print-room of the British Museum, aim too much at a full pictorial effect, instead of observing the restrictions of graphic art. As a painter he is represented in the Walker Art Gallery at Liverpool. He also exhibited at the Society of British Artists which he was elected to in 1884, the Dudley Gallery, the New Gallery, the Royal Institute of Oil Painters and Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours, the Royal Society of Artists in Birmingham, Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts, the Royal Scottish Academy, and Manchester City Art Gallery. Finnie also exhibited at the Salon Artistes Fran√ßais and received a commendation in 1896. He joined the Royal Cambrian Academy in 1894 and became its treasurer in 1897. On retiring from the School of Art, in 1896, Finnic broke up his home in Huskisson Street and settled at Towyn, near Llandudno, where he spent his life in painting, engraving, and music. He retained full vigour until an attack of influenza injured his heart in 1905. He returned to Liverpool, where he died on 27 February 1907. He was buried at Smithdown Road cemetery beside his wife, Agnes James Ellison, who died on 8 July 1889. One son. Dr. Ellison Finnie, survived him. A memorial exhibition of his art, comprising 438 numbers, was held at the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, in 1907. The gallery contains many of his works today as does the Portsmouth Museum. Other works are in the Norwich Castle museum and Wolverhampton Art Gallery. Among his prot√©g√©s were Constance Copeman, who painted a portrait of him in 1903, now on display in the Walker Art Gallery, Elizabeth Dean, and William Henry Crome.

The current structure, the third county courthouse, took three years to build and is considered a fine example of Beaux-Arts architecture. History The area now known as Courthouse Square in Kankakee, Illinois was originally used by the Potawatomi as a council ground. European settlement began in 1832 with the Treaty of Camp Tippecanoe. In 1851, the Illinois Central Railroad decided to build a station in what is now Kankakee. The Associates Land Company, formed by supporters of the Illinois Central, purchased and platted the land around the station, calling it Kankakee Depot. When Kankakee County was formed in 1853, Kankakee Depot competed with Momence to be named county seat. The influence of the Associates Land Company, who offered to donate a large block of land and $5000 for a courthouse, swayed voters to select Kankakee Depot as seat. The first Kankakee County Courthouse was built shortly thereafter. The three-story building became a social center and trading place in addition to its capacities in county government. Stephen A. Douglas gave a speech in front of the courthouse during his 1858 Senate Campaign. On May 17, 1861, it was home to Kankakee County's only case of capital punishment when an African-American man was hanged from the second floor for the murder of a white girl. On October 5, 1872, the courthouse was destroyed in a fire. The limestone walls were cleaned and re-used in the second courthouse. The new courthouse was built to similar specification as the first. The main difference was the cupola, which was railed higher than the first. The courthouse opened in October 1873. By the 1900s, it was evident that the county courthouse was too small for the county's use. The county population had recently grown to 37,000, an increase of 8,000 over the previous decade. In November 1908, voters approved the construction of a new courthouse, the current structure. Zachary Taylor Davis was awarded the commission for the building. It was built by Lafayette, Indiana contractor W. F. Stilwell for $187,000. Construction began on October 2, 1909 and finished in July 1912. In the 1930s, a protest with 200 farmers gathered at the courthouse to demand changes in property tax laws so that they would be paid after the harvest. By 1950, the population of the county exceeded 73,500 thanks to an industrial boom in the late 1940s. The courthouse has remained in use since its 1912 opening. On March 7, 2007, the building was recognized by the National Park Service with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places.

He was born in Chapala, Jalisco to Felipe R√≠os and Mar√≠a Guadalupe Alcal√°, but moved to the city of Colima in 1957. His grandfather, Jes√∫s Becerra, was a potter, making pieces for personal use only. As a child, R√≠os Alcal√° played with balls of clay but had no real inclination towards pottery, but his father made him learn. His father was a farmer, who found pre Hispanic pieces while working in the fields. The artisan experimented with the broken ones, developing ways to restore them. This became a vocation by accident. He was working as a bricklayer, and was asked to restore a pre Hispanic piece. This led to work with the University of Colima on restoration projects when he was only eighteen. Since then, he has established a permanent workshop at the Museo Universitario de Artes Populares Mar√≠a Teresa Pomar at the university, restoring pieces, making reproductions and giving workshops on pre Hispanic ceramics. His restoration specialty are figures from the shaft tombs found in western Mexico. Most of his reproduction work is that of Colima area pre Hispanic pottery. He makes figures of birds, priests and men and women in various activities, as well as monkey figures found only in Colima, but his most popular works are those of xoloitzcuintles or Mexican hairless dogs. The most famous Mesoamerican era image of these dogs is falsely called ‚Äúthe dancing dogs‚Äù but in reality is a depiction of an older dog passing on generational information to the younger. R√≠os Alcal√° created a monumental version of this piece which stands at a traffic circle in the city of Colima, on the highway to Comala. R√≠os Alcal√° has studied the pre Hispanic pottery of western Mexico for years, visiting pieces in museums and photographing archeological sites. He has continued working with the University of Colima, creating his reproductions with clay from Comala, using red earth pigments and creating pieces using molds. Several of his pieces are part of the museum‚Äôs permanent collection. His production is in demand by private collectors both in Mexico and abroad and he sometimes received special commissions. His work has brought him to countries such as the United States, Canada and Cuba to give talks and exhibitions. In 2006, an exhibition of his work was held at the Galer√≠a Marianao in Havana, sponsored by the Casa de las Am√©ricas and the Jornada de la Cultura Mexicana in Cuba. He is married with seven children, but none are potters. R√≠os Alcal√° has received recognition for his work since 1966 in the way of prizes and diplomas. He was named a ‚ÄúGreat Master of Popular Art‚Äù by the Fomento Cultural Banamex in 2001. The Museo Universitario de Arte Popular Teresa Pomar held a retrospective of his work in 2010.

The station opened on April 7, 2014, marking the end of construction of the Monta√±o Transit Center. The station platform and shelters were built in pueblo-revival style, and features green technology, such as LED lighting and solar panels. The platform itself can accommodate a maximum of five rail cars, correcting a problem that arose with other stations along the route concerning inadequate space for passenger cars. The parking lot offers some sheltered parking structures, as well as bicycle lockers. Bus bays have been created to accommodate current transit service to the station and allow for expansion of bus service to the Monta√±o Transit Center at an undisclosed future date. The transit center is designed to link residents in the north valley neighborhoods to both ABQ RIDE and the Rail Runner, and to relieve overcrowded parking lots at the Los Ranchos/Journal Center station. Starting January 11, passengers can transfer to ABQ RIDE route 157, which serves both Cottonwood and Coronado malls, and Kirtland Air Force Base.http://data.cabq.gov/transit/Schedule%20Changes/2014Jan_Rt_157_Wkd_Sched.pdf The station is also served by the NMDOT Park and Ride Purple route.

It works under operating systems of the Windows family. Autumn of 2009 was the first time Festi came into the view of the companies engaged in the development and sale of antivirus software. At this time it was estimated that the botnet itself consisted of roughly 25.000 infected machines, while having a spam volume capacity of roughly 2.5 billion spam emails a day. Festi showed the greatest activity in 2011-2012. More recent estimates - dated August 2012 - display that the botnet is sending spam from 250,000 unique IP addresses, a quarter of the total amount of one million detected IP's sending spam mails. The main functionality of botnet Festi is spam sending and implementation of cyberattacks like \\"distributed denial of service\\".  Distribution Methods  Distribution is carried with scheme PPI (Pay-Per-Install) use. For preventing of detection by antiviruses the loader extends ciphered that complicates signature based detection.  Architecture  All represented data about the architecture of botnet we have gathered from research ESET antivirus company. The loader downloads and sets up a bot which represents a kernel-mode driver which adds itself in the list of the drivers which are launching together with an operating system. On a hard disk drive only the part of a bot is stored which is responsible for communication with command center and loading of modules. After starting the bot periodically asks the command center for receiving a configuration, loading of the modules and the jobs necessary for execution.  Modules  From the researches which have been carried out by specialists of the antivirus company ESET, it is known that Festi has at least two modules. One of them intends for spam sending (BotSpam.dll), another for implementation of cyberattacks like \\"distributed denial of service\\" (BotDoS.dll). The module for implementation of cyberattacks like \\"distributed denial of service\\" supports the following types of cyberattacks, namely: TCP- flood, UDP-flood, DNS-flood, HTTP(s)-flood, and also flood packets with a random number in the issue of the used protocol. The expert from the \\"Kaspersky Lab\\" researching botnet drew an output that there are more modules, but not all from them are used. Their list includes the module for socks- server implementation (BotSocks.dll) with the TCP and UDP protocols, the module for remote viewing and control of the computer of the user (BotRemote.dll), the module implementing search on a disk of the remote computer and in a local area network (BotSearch.dll) to which the remote computer is connected, grabber-modules for all browsers known at present time (BotGrabber.dll). Modules are never saved on a hard disk drive that does almost impossible their detection.  Network Interaction  The bot uses client-server model and for functioning implements own protocol of network interaction with command center which is used for receiving a configuration of a botnet, loading of modules, and also for obtaining jobs from command center and notification of command center about their execution. Data are encoded that interferes the determination of contents of network traffic.  Protection against Detection and Debugging  In case of installation the bot switches off a system firewall, hides the kernel-mode driver and the keys of the system registry necessary for loading and operation, protects itself and registry keys from deleting. Operation with a network occurs at a low level that allows to bypass network filters of the antivirus software easily. The use of network filters is observed to prevent their installation. The bot checks, whether it is launched under the virtual machine, in case of positive result of the check, it stops the activities. Festi periodically checks existence of a debugger and is able to remove breakpoints.  The Object- Oriented Approach to Development  Festi is created with use of object- oriented technology of software development that strongly complicates researches by a method of the reverse engineering and does a bot easily ported for other operating systems.  Control  All control of botnet Festi is implemented by means of web interface and is carried out via browser.  Who Stands behind Festi  According to specialists of the antivirus company ESET, to American journalist and blogger Brian Krebs, the expert in information security field, according to American journalist of The New York Times newspaper Andrew Kramer, and also from the sources close to Russian intelligence services, the architect and the developer of botnet Festi ‚Äî Russian hacker Igor Artimovich.  Conclusion  In conclusion, it is possible to tell that botnet Festi was one of the most powerful botnets for sending spam and carrying out attacks like \\"distributed denial of service\\". The principles by which Festi botnet is constructed increase bot lifetime in the system as much as possible, hinder with bot detection by the antivirus software and network filters. The mechanism of modules allows to expand functionality of botnet in any side by means of creation and loading of necessary modules for achievement of different purposes, and the object- oriented approach to development complicates botnet researching with use of methods of the reverse engineering and gives the chance of bot porting on other operating systems through an accurate demarcation of specific to a concrete operating system functionality and remaining logic of bot. Powerful systems of counteraction to detection and debugging make Festi bot almost invisible and stealthy. The system of bindings and use of reserve command centers gives the chance of restoration of control over a botnet after change of command center. Festi is an atypical example of malicious software as the authors approached the process of its development extremely seriously.

Following the Battle of Caporetto (24 October to 19 November 1917), the Italian Front collapsed. In order to ensure this did not lead to Italy withdrawing from the war the allies organised forces to reinforce the Italians. As the battle unfolded, General Luigi Cadorna invoked the agreement reached at the Chantilly Conference of December 1915. There the allies had agreed that should any of the allies come under threat, the other allies would support them. The first French troops arrived on 27 October 1917. The first British troops followed them after a few days. Fearing that his troops would be overrun and lost in case the Italian lines on the Piave river would be broken by the Austro-Hungarian and German forces, however, General Foch refused to commit them to the frontline until the Italian troops had halted the Central Powers' troops by themselves and firmly established a defensive line on the Piave river. The British was thus kept in reserve during the First Battle of the Piave (November 1917) and only saw action from December 1917 onwards. The French expeditionary force consisted primarily of the French Tenth Army with the addition of the 12th Corps. They took up station around Verona. Four of the six French divisions (46e, 47e, 64e, 65e) were to return to the Western Front in spring 1918. The British Expeditionary Force (Italy) came under the command of General Herbert Plumer. The principal units in the BEF(I) were the 23rd, 41st, 7th, 48th and 5th divisions.

There are around 500 inhabitants in the community as the majority of the indigenes live in various cities across the country. The community has produced personalities like Late Adams Kennedy Patrick Unaji Jr of Occupy Nigeria (a campaign during the Nigerian subsidy removal protest), a Nollywood actress Ene Oloja, Mr. Patrick Unaji,Dr.Martins Ejembi, Chief Peter Idoko who is currently the community head. The Okpale-Otta community also has the mother of the international Nigerian Afro-Hip-Hop artist Tuface Idibia as its native.Other natives are mr michael ogaje a senior Accountant with the Transcorp Hilton Abuja, Dr Anthony Ogaje a re-known orthopaedic surgeon and a consultant with the federal capital hospital in Abuja. History The current community of Okpale-Otta has its origin from one of the last three brothers known as Okpale. His name was Adah son Anaga, one of the wives of King Ogbe, the then king who ruled over the small dynasty of Ogege. Adah‚Äôs father was the son of Abba, the son of Edumoga. He fathered three main children whom together were known as Okpale. The children were: Odo, Ede and Adah who was the last and from another mother called Anaga. Odo and Ede were of the same mother unlike Adah who was an only son of Anaga. For this reason, he was not very much liked by his two brothers; Odo and Ede. One day, they were out fishing and Adah caught a very fish that he alone could not bring out so, he called on his two half-brothers for assistance. Meanwhile, the two brothers had not caught anything all day thus, out of spite they decided to kill him. So, instead of assisting Adah with his big catch, they were pushing him into the deep side of the river so that he could drown. However, a maternal relative of Adah called Ogwuche who was hunting very close by overheard the shouting of dying Adah so, he ran to his rescue. Few weeks later after settling of the quarrel in the household of Ogbe their father, Ogwuche offered to adopt Adah. And with him, he stayed until he became a full grow man. Having come of age, Adah took up wives while he settled in an area known as Ogamgam around a river called Ogbadibo. With his wives, he had eight children in this order: Kpkochi, Ugblu, Okpotu, Adikwu, Akor, Idoko, Enoke and Abukar respectively. In pursuit of greener pastures, Adah migrated his family a place known as Otta (a river that dries) hence, the name Okpale-Otta, there, he resettled with his family. The eight children formed the clans that make up the present Okpale-Otta. Religion The community's original religion was paganism which they practiced until the arrival of the Roman Catholic missionaries in the early fifties. Despite the introduction of Christianity, the practice of paganism only faded away in the late nineties thereby leaving Christianity, specifically the Catholic Church in the community. But of recent, other churches like New Creation Assembly and The Living Faith Church are now in existence in the community. Festival The Okpale-Otta people have an annual festival called Echi‚Äôene, meaning on the fourth. It is so called, because the community having been able to produce someone in person of Chief Peter Idoko as the district head of Edumoga in the Local Government Area of the Benue State. Economic Activities In the community, subsistent farming is the main source of income of the inhabitants. Although, a few people have small businesses that they manage to supplement their income. Government The community practices a system of democracy where various elders and adult comes from each of the eight clans to deliberate upon issues affecting the community. However, this system is now segmented as a result of the dispersed of major indigenes outside the community and it is now been practiced in the various cities of Nigeria under the general name of Okpale-Otta National Meeting with its center in the community. A body known as the Okpale-Otta Descendants Association (ODA) is subset of the body which may be referred to as the governing council of the Okpale-Otta National Meeting. This body meets annually to discuss affairs of the community as to how to improve the community in general. Law and Order Before the advent of Christianity in the Okpale-Otta community, the agent of maintaining and enforcing law and order was the traditional Night Masquerade known as Onyonkpo. The Onyonkpo‚Äôs primary responsibilities were settling of arguments between villagers, sanctioning criminals and arbitrating among embittered relationships. However, the practice of the Onyonkpo system of maintaining law and order in the community was ended in 2011 due to selfish administration of justice, lack of checks and balances on the Onyonkpo, loss of confidence of the people on the Onyonkpo and shift of allegiance from paganism to Christianity. However, another agent of maintaining law and order in the community known as the ‚ÄúOkpale-Otta Youth Development Association‚Äù has been instituted in replacement of the Onyonkpo. In addition to maintaining law and order in the community, they also carry out a sanitization exercise during the rainy season. Education The community holds the records of having the first primary school in the entire district of Edumoga of Okpokwu Local Government Area. The school is famous for producing major elites in the whole of the Okpkokwu in terms of basic education. Also present in the community is secondary a school known as Our Lady of Perpetual help College which is to a high degree overseen by the arch dioceses of Otukpo of the Roman Catholic church.

The Pikkujoulu party is non-formal, highly festive, and themed after Christmas. Pikkujoulu parties are held by various communities, organisations, companies, or just among friends. Not to be compared with Lilla jul, the latter of which is annually celebrated the Saturday before 1st advent. Lilla jul is celebrated by the Swedish-speaking population of Finland. Description Pikkujoulu differs from Christmas as more free-form and less religious. Traditionally, Pikkujoulu is a day when Christmas dishes are served for the first time. These include rice pudding with fruit.Life in Finland Pikkujoulu ‚Äì celebrating the start of the Christmas season in Finland (accessed 15 May 2014) The most traditional Pikkujoulu drink is called ‚Äúgl√∂gi‚Äù (the Finnish equivalent of the German Gl√ºhwein or mulled wine), which can be served with or without alcohol. Gl√∂gi is made of hot juice or red wine and spiced with cinnamon, ginger, clove, raisins, and almonds.ESN FINT Holidays and festivities in Finland, (accessed 15 May 2014) For entertainment, there are festive speeches often followed by jokes or humorous sketches, after which, mock awards are given out. Song books are then passed out and happy Christmas hits are sung in Finnish, English, or Swedish. Christmas karaoke has become quite popular, and any performer will garner applause, no matter how unpleasant they may sound. There could also be a band, stand-up comedian, magician, or funny play. Every Pikkujoulu celebration has a Santa Claus giving out little gag gifts. Embassy of Finland in Athens News, Show me the way to the next pikkujoulu, (accessed 15 May 2014) In 2011, the Pikkujoulu Christmas parties around Helsinki, Finland caused 400 police calls on the same night. Helsinki police attributed the high number of calls to alcohol consumption.yle UUTISET Pikku Joulu high jinks keep police busy (accessed 15 May 2014) The Finnish Pikkujoulu is similar to other Nordic pre Christmas traditions, such as the Norwegian julebord and Swedish julbord. In recent years some Norwegians have started to adapt their julebord to the Pikkujoulu, washing out the differences between these Nordic pre Christmas traditions. History Pikkujoulu is based on the Advent: the Advent signified the waiting for Jesus Christ and the fasting, which ended on Christmas. In the 19th century, the Advent was sometimes called \\"the little Christmas\\", i.e. Pikkujoulu. The tradition originates from Germany and Sweden in the 1800s, before being taken up by Finnish students.South Africans in Finland Christmas in Finland: Pikkujoulu,(accessed 15 May 2014). The proper Pikkujoulu tradition started in Helsinki after World War I. The basis for the party was \\"Christmas tree parties\\" held in schools. The supper parties held at the end of autumn by student nations gradually formed into the modern Pikkujoulu. Pikkujoulu parties started by student nations grew out to other communities in the 1930s. Before World War II, the parties were sometimes called \\"porridge parties\\". The private family Pikkujoulu is probably based on a tradition stating that the nameday of Tuomas, 21 December, is the first day when tasting home-made beer is allowed. In Sweden, the Tuomas nameday evening is called Lilla jul (\\"little Christmas\\"). In time, the tradition evolved to the Saint Lucy's Day celebration, which still resembles the Finnish Pikkujoulu.

They are assigned to the Stramenopiles (heterokonts), a group which also contains kelp and various microalgae. Lifecycle Several stages occur in its lifecycle. The feeding form has a stiff, rounded body with cellular extensions used in feeding. Cells can transform into mobile flagellated cells with stiff tripartite hairs typical of the Stramenopiles. Cells can also grow and divide to form a cluster of cells which may become a sorus that produces biflagellated zoospores.  Relation to humans  Certain species produce large amounts of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and are grown commercially for production of this oil for animal feeds, biomass, biofuels and direct human consumption in supplements and additives. In 2016, juvenile Nile tilapia were given a feed containing dried Schizochytrium in place of fish oil. When compared to a control group raised on regular feed, they exhibited higher weight gain and better feed conversion, and their flesh was higher in omega-3 fatty acids.  DHA synthesis in Schizochytrium  DHA synthesis in Schizochytrium does not involve membrane-bound desaturases or fatty acid elongation enzymes such as those described for other eukaryotes. Instead it is thought that DHA synthesis in Schizochytrium occurs via a Polyketide synthase (PKS)-based pathway, although the primary structures of the Polyketide do not conform to any known class of PKS proteins. Homology between Shewanella and Schizochytrium PKS genes suggests that the genes involved in this pathway underwent lateral gene transfer.

All ceramic products were made from native clays.Kenton Hills Porcelains, Inc., VI. Products include vases, bookends, figurines, lamp bases, and flowerpots. Founding Harold Bopp, a ceramic engineer, began working for Rookwood Pottery in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1929 as the head of the chemistry and color department. Shortly after being hired, Bopp became superintendent of all Rookwood facilities. In 1939, Bopp approached the company's president John D. Wareham with ideas for helping the failing company. The Great Depression was largely to blame for Rookwood's financial problems, but Bopp believed that selling more to wholesalers, thus reducing inventory, would increase cash flow and allow the company to make upgrades to the company's manufacturing processes.Kenton Hills Porcelains, Inc., 5-6. Wareham was an artist and not business-minded. He rejected Bopp's suggestions and Bopp resigned from Rookwood. He and several other former employees discussed creating a new pottery that would incorporate Bopp's ideas for the foundering Rookwood company.Kenton Hills Porcelains, Inc., 6. Bopp established the Harold F. Bopp Manufacturing Company and selected a location on U.S. Route 25 (Dixie Highway) in Erlanger, Kentucky.

Dawson and Reichardt went to work for the war defense industry. Hentschel returned to the Cincinnati Art Academy full-time. The Kenton Hills Porcelains production facility, including the kilns, was leased to the U.S. Army for storage of defense materials. Following the war, the facility was found to be in great disrepair and the kilns were contaminated.

The founder of Liz Lange Maternity, which introduced form-fitting designer pregnancy wear in 1998, Lange has been described as a pioneer in the apparel industry.  Early life and education  Lange grew up in New York City. She attended college at Brown University, where she earned a bachelor's degree in Comparative Literature in 1988.  Career  From 1989 through 1993, Lange worked as a staff writer at Vogue, where she developed an interest in fashion. After leaving the magazine, she briefly interned for Stephen Di Geronimo's Geronimo label, and ultimately became a partner. While there, she began developing her idea for maternity clothes. In a 2005 interview with Business Week, Lange said: \\"I had all these pregnant friends come visit me and try to squeeze themselves into nonmaternity designer clothes. They all complained they couldn't find anything regular and stylish to wear ‚Äì and that everywhere the outfits were either oversized or too frilly, which didn't look appropriate at work. I also noticed that, as they squeezed into these clothes, they looked better even though the outfits weren't quite big enough, just because the clothes were better designed. That was my aha! moment.\\" In 1997, Lange borrowed $50,000 from family and founded Liz Lange Maternity in a 12x12 office equipped with only a phone. In 1998, after contacting friends she believed would be interested in the clothing, Lange opened an 800 square foot store in Manhattan's midtown. The company quickly outgrew the space and moved to Madison Avenue in 2000. She later opened flagship stores in Beverly Hills, and in Greenville, on Long Island in New York. Creating high-end clothing that hugged rather than tented pregnant women, Lange's clothing attracted early attention from the fashion press, who described Liz Lange Maternity as the first \\"designer\\" maternity wear. After early coverage in the New York Times and Vogue, which praised the silhouette of the line, Lange began dressing pregnant celebrities, including Cate Blanchett, Cindy Crawford, Mariska Hargitay, Gwyneth Paltrow, Julia Roberts, Kelly Ripa, Brooke Shields, Kate Winslet, and Reese Witherspoon. In August 2001, Lange signed an exclusive deal with Nike to introduce a line of athletic wear for pregnant women. In September of the same year, Lange was invited to unveil the line at New York Fashion Week. The first ever runway show by a maternity designer during Fashion Week, the event was scheduled to take place at 9:00 AM on September 11. It was immediately halted after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In 2002, Lange began a collaboration with Target and created a secondary line, Liz Lange for Target. Sold in-store and online, Liz Lange for Target is the retailer's sole offering in maternity apparel. In 2007, Lange sold a majority stake in Liz Lange Maternity to private-equity fund Bluestar Alliance. Two years later, she joined Stefani Greenfield on Home Shopping Network (HSN) with limited-edition Liz Lange Designs for Curations. The collection sold out quickly, and inspired Lange to create an exclusive women's wear line for the network, Completely Me by Liz Lange, which was introduced in 2010. Lange founded the website shopafrolic.com in 2009 with her sister, Jane Wagman. She wrote Liz Lange's Maternity Style: How to Look Fabulous During the Most Fashion-Challenged Time, published in 2003. In 2012, Liz Lange Maternity and the Completely Me brands were bought by Cherokee Inc. for $14 million. Lange remains involved as the creative director and \\"the face\\" of the brand. In 2013, Lange was honored with the Spirit of Achievement Award from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University. In 2015, Cherokee Inc. an announced a licensing agreement with Sears Canada. The collection, which includes jeans, T-shirts, dresses and swimsuits will be available in-store and online in an expanded size range that covers \\"maternity and beyond.\\"  Personal life  Lange, an advocate for cancer prevention and treatment, was diagnosed with cervical cancer at age 35. She underwent a hysterectomy, radiation treatment, and chemotherapy and spoke publicly about her illness with publications including People and USA Today. Lange has two children, Gus and Alice, and lives in Manhattan. Since 2017, she has owned the fabled Grey Gardens estate in East Hampton, New York, which was the setting of the 1975 documentary Grey Gardens.

With its death toll of 80 to 88, it marks possibly the worst fire disaster in Germany since World War II, 88 at least in the city of Berlin. The death toll is today considered to be 81: 80 guests and the owner of the restaurant, Julius Loebel, who died while attempting to save a cashbox. The fire The Karlslust was the largest restaurant and dance hall in Spandau during the first half of the 20th century, a two storied building with ballroom and bowling alley famous for its \\"legendary\\" parties. On the evening of Saturday, 8 February 1947, during carnival time in Germany, the first post-war fancy-dress ball was scheduled. The landlord, Julius Loebel, had been granted the concession of a lifted curfew that night, as Berlin was occupied at that time. An estimated 750 to 800 (or even up to 1,000) mostly young people attended the event, among them a number of British Army staff. Because of extremely low outside temperatures of or , three potbelly stoves had been set up inside the Karlslust to provide heating. At around 22:45, when the party was in full swing, the wooden overhead beams of the structure caught on fire, likely, as was later determined, as a result of the intense heat of the stove pipes. The Karlslust had been used as a prison in the last months of the war in Germany, and windows were barred and doors had been walled up; additionally, a side door was frozen shut. In the ensuing rush to the only exit, several people were trampled to death. After three minutes, the entire roof of the building was on fire. Realizing the extent of the fire, several of those who had already escaped returned to retrieve their winter clothing from the cloakroom. This behaviour was later met with incredulity by the British authorities, but can be attributed to the tight supply situation in post-war Germany, where people were living on ration stamps. Eventually, the roof of the Karlslust collapsed, burying those still inside. Fire response The first firefighters of the British Army arrived at the scene 15 minutes after the fire had broken out. In an attempt to rescue those trapped inside the collapsed building, three\\"Fire in Berlin Dance Hall.\\" Times [London, England] 10 February 1947: 4. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 6 Dec 2013. or six British soldiers died. A few guests of the Karlslust survived the roof collapse and could be pulled out of the debris; they had found shelter in the cellar. Summoning firefighters was difficult at that time, as there was no standardized emergency telephone number, and each fire station had to be notified separately. The freezing temperatures and the snow-covered area hampered the firefighting efforts. German firefighters arrived at the Karlslust considerably later than their British counterparts, the bulk of them 40 minutes after having been called, for a variety of reasons: the low quality of their vehicles, whose engines needed some time to warm up; the speed limit of for civilians in Berlin, which had been imposed to ensure priority rights for vehicles of the World War II Allies); due to bridges over the Havel river having been destroyed during the war, detours were required to get to Hakenfelde from places in Spandau as well as the rest of Berlin. Fatalities A memorial stone in den Kisseln cemetery. The German inscription reads: \\"In memory of those who perished in the fire disaster at the Karlslust inn on 8 February 1947\\". In the immediate aftermath of the fire, Der Spiegel reported that 88 bodies had been found, many of them burned beyond recognition, and that another 108 people were missing. 150 people were injured, 40 of which needed hospital treatment. Later sources put the death toll to 80, 81, or 82. On 25 February 1947, 77 victims were buried at In den Kisseln cemetery, at a dedicated spot called \\"Loebel field\\", named after the landlord of the ill-fated dance hall. Until that day, all festivities and dance events in Berlin were cancelled. Aftermath The Magistrate of Berlin, from 1945 to 1948 the civilian government for the whole city, ordered the delivery of cloth for 800 winter cloaks; lost ration stamps were replaced. Political parties that collected donations for the victims included the Christian Democratic Union, the Social Democratic Party and the Socialist Unity Party alike. In order to address issues identified as having slowed down the emergency response to the fire, the speed limit for civilian vehicles was lifted on 13 March 1947, and also the general traffic priority of the allies was given up this day. A standardized, general emergency telephone number for Berlin was re-instated on 20 October of that year, using the number \\"02\\".

Charles was known as a successful New York entrepreneur who was devoted to and invested in socially aware public topics. After the deaths of both Charles and Stella Guttman all of their substantial possessions were donated to their Foundation. In 2013 the Foundation came up with a tactical evaluation on the Foundation‚Äôs assets and decided to donate about $25 million that could result in effective changes over a five-year period commencing in 2012. Their proposal on the Stella and Charles Guttman Community project was accepted to make significant improvements in college success for New York City public school students. They also gave $15 million to the New Community College, now called the Stella and Charles Guttman Community College. This contribution was stated by the Council for Aid to Education to be one of the biggest contributions ever for a public two-year college. The foundation also gave an additional $10 million to the City University of New York (CUNY) with the purpose to raise the graduation rates in all seven community colleges of the CUNY system. The Union Settlement Association was another organization that received a donation of about $50,000 for a regeneration grant to support the college transition program in the Union Settlement. The donation was put in place to help direct low‚Äìearning, minority high school alumnae from East Harlem and surrounding neighborhoods to college. Executive Elizabeth Olofson stated, \\"This grant is part of the Foundation‚Äôs recent decision to make a substantial investment to support college success for New York City public school students\\". Charles and Stella Guttman also supplied the Henry Street Settlement's original building with a donation of $1 million, as Charles had grown up in the area. Charles Guttman was raised on the Lower East Side of New York, where his proper education ended at the age of 13. In 1962, during the Henry Settlement dedication, Charles recollected that as a child he was shipped out of the city to the country along with Irish and Italian children with the Henry Street Settlement. Charles Guttman went on to establish the Paddington Corporation in 1937, which imported J&B; Scotch and other liquors. He served as the company's president, which he founded with importers Justerini & Brooks. He owned 17.08% and 43.39% and as an executive official, had 51.17% and 98.31%. Guttman sold 83,000 Class A shares and their foundation sold the remaining with a total of 17,000 shares which resulted in the Guttmans owning 17% of the corporation‚Äôs voting securities and the foundation owning none. The 2012 the Foundations tax forms displayed grants given over time that varied in institutions/organizations and resulted in a total of $2,058,500 donated. Some of the organizations given grants were to the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Brooklyn Children's Museum, New York Needs You and others. The foundation has also provided grants to several colleges such as Princeton University, the NYU School of Medicine and Yale University.

Bagneris's brother is actor, playwright, and musician Vernel Bagneris. His father was a postal clerk and a veteran of World War II. He was described as a playful and cheerful man. Larry's mother was a strongly dedicated mother and manager of the Bagneris house. Vernel described his mother as a \\"woman who quietly outclassed most people.\\" Wendi Berman: Interview with Vernel Bagneris, 2 March 2007 for The African American National Biography (Oxford 2008). Bagneris and his family initially resided in the Creole Seventh Ward neighborhood of New Orleans. Due to a U.S. Federal program of \\"Urban Renewal\\" of the 1960s, the Bagneris family relocated to the Gentilly neighborhood of New Orleans. The move came after the family experienced the detrimental impacts of unchecked legislative initiatives that adversely impacted neighborhoods of color. The program was referred to as \\"The Negro Removal,\\" which saw the creation of a highway overpass through the community that invited crime and drove down the spirits of property of the once vibrant Seventh Ward. Bagneris and his brother attended St. Augustine High School in New Orleans. St. Augustine H.S. is an iconic New Orleans parochial school for boys that was founded with the intention of providing the segregated black- male students of New Orleans with a better education than that which was then poorly provided by the New Orleans Public Schools. http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20051225&slug;=jdl25 It was at St. Augustine that Larry began to realize that he could have a voice in transforming the segregated culture.

The buildings reflect the agricultural practices of Illinois farmers in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The heavy timber framed buildings are representative of northern Illinois construction trends between the 1830s and 1850s. History Fur trader Jacque Jonveau was awarded a land grant from the General Land Office following the Treaty of Camp Tippecanoe in October 1832. Jonveau was of mixed Pottawatomi and French descent and was thus eligible for one of the ten grants set aside for persons of Pottawatomi blood. It does not appear that Jonveau ever built a structure on the grant.http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/223419.pdf Thomas Durham was born in Richmond, Virginia in 1784 and moved with his family to Tennessee by 1804. In the late 1810s, Sometime shortly after 1826, Durham moved to Vermilion County, Illinois to work as a bricklayer. Durham may have met Gordon S. Hubbard, the regional director for the American Fur Company, at his trading post in Iroquois County in 1827. Durham worked for Hubbard in 1832, supervising the construction of the Vermilion County Courthouse, and again in 1834 building a warehouse in Chicago. Between these two jobs, Durham traveled the Hubbard Trace, a road between Chicago and Danville, which passed through Bourbonnais Township. Durham camped in the township and enjoyed the surroundings so much that he purchased a tract from Hubbard in 1835; it is not known how Hubbard came to have possession of Jonveau's holdings. Local Pottawatomi helped the Durham family build a teepee, while a log cabin was under construction. Soon, a large farmhouse replaced the cabin. Durham may have used his farmhouse as a tavern, as traffic along the Hubbard Trace was heavy in the late 1830s. By 1850, Durham extended the family holdings to , half of which was developed. Durham's daughter Martha married David Perry, who owned a house on a lot across the road from Durham's. Perry, a carpenter, came to Kankakee County from Vermont. Perry owned a sawmill in nearby Momence. When Durham died in March 1854, the land passed to Durham's sons. However, after some failed business ventures in Kankakee, they had little money. Perry offered to purchase the farm, thus keeping the house in the family while also supporting the Durhams' operations. Perry remodeled the house shortly after he and Martha moved in. He lived there and farmed the land until his death in 1887, when the land passed to his son Alvah. Alvah Perry only used the property for vacations, as he was usually busy as a cattle broker in the Union Stock Yards in Chicago. In 1891, he sold the property east of the road to developer J. Herman Hardebeck. In 1924, Perry rented the western property to Armand DuVoisin, a Swiss immigrant, who tended the remaining acreage. DuVoisin worked the farm until his 1950 retirement. Lomira Perry, the last living child of Alvah Perry, died in 1961. In her will, she deeded the property to the Illinois Department of Conservation with the hopes that a park would be developed. Perry stipulated that DuVoisin descendants could continue to operate the farm, which they continue to do as of 2006. On May 31, 2006, the National Park Service recognized the property with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Perry Farm Park Ownership of the property was transferred to the Bourbonnais Township Park District in 1989, which developed the property as Perry Farm Park. The park features open recreation areas, 4 miles of walking trails, and the Exploration Station children's museum.

The farmhouse has elements dating to the 1730s, including evidence of building methods used by Dutch settlers of the Hudson River valley, and has been successively modified in each of the following centuries, with the last significant work occurring in the 1920s. All of the surviving farm buildings in the complex are at least 90 years old, and some date to the 19th century. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011, and is now the museum and headquarters of the Great Barrington Historical Society. Description and history The Wheeler farm complex sits on a parcel of land between United States Route 7 and the Housatonic River that is a remnant of what was once a much large farm, extending from the river to the east and beyond the road to the west. The farmstead, located on the east side of the road, includes the main house, several barns and stables, a carriage house, and a silo. The farmhouse is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and wooden shingled exterior. It has a symmetrical five-bay front facade, with simply framed windows and center entrance. Despite the symmetry, the building is an amalgam of additive elements, revealing construction methods across over 150 years of time. The oldest portion of the house, its northwest chamber, was built about 1733, using construction methods of Dutch origin. The building achieved its basic present form after a series of additions later in the 19th century, mostly by members of the Wheeler family who purchased it in 1747. The property also exhibits evidence of Native American habitation prior to the arrival of European colonists. The property was purchased by Truman Wheeler in 1764, a native of Connecticut, who operated a store in the house until his death in 1815. He was also active in civic affairs, and served in the local militia in leading roles during the American Revolutionary War. The farm was occupied by members of the Wheeler family until 1988, and was conveyed by the heirs of the last residents to the Great Barrington Historical Society in 2008.

The dependent's labor generates material wealth, which is in turn used to attach further dependents. Such systems can therefore exist independent of or alongside other capitalist or monetary modes of value and accumulation. The concept is most commonly applied to ethnographies and histories of Africa, particularly the tropical equatorial regions.  Origins of term  Anthropologists have long emphasized the importance of ties and affiliations for gaining status. One of the earliest uses of the concept was by Max Gluckman in his 1941 work Economy of the Central Barotse Plain, with other similar uses by anthropologists such as Kenneth Little in 1951, Lloyd A. Fallers in 1964, and David Murray Schneider in 1968. However, the specific term \\"wealth-in-people\\" did not gain widespread use until the early 1980s. The first of this wave of anthropological studies was Caroline H. Bledsoe's 1980 work on Women and Marriage in Kpelle Society, which used the concept to examine how urbanization affects the strategies of Kpelle women and men to gain power an influence by binding themselves to their superiors through ties of marriage, clientship, and filial obligation. In Bledsoe's framework, people can be understood as resources, and the way society is ordered therefore is the result of rational choice. In the 1990s, the concept of wealth-in-people became a widespread conceptual tool not only in anthropology but also history. In the beginning of urbanization in Africa, they created mobile cities. If the land was no longer suitable for crops, then the people would have to change their location. The importance of Wealth in People in Africa could be related to the people in Africa having a primacy of exit. With there being so much land around, if the people did not like the way a ruler was leading, they could leave and start a new settlement. When the European settlers came, they also acknowledged the importance of Wealth in People. This is seen with European men like the la√ßandos who married prominent African women in order to gain more connections for trading. Additionally Wealth in People is also connected to Wealth in Knowledge. Wealth in Knowledge and Wealth in People are closely related; they both focus on the number of people or things that a person knows as a marker of his or her power in African society. This emphasis of knowledge could also be related to the heavy presence of oral history in African society. The griots were African oral historians and were highly ranked in society. The ability to learn the history like the Sundiata epic became a sacred tradition passed between father and son.  Examples  The concept of wealth-in-people has been used to understand a range of societies, most of which are in central Africa.  Cameroon  Nicholas Argenti applies the concept to southern Cameroon to show the flip side of wealth in people, noting the marginalized status that would accompany men who were not able to acquire a sufficient number of dependents (including wives, children, and clients). Jane Guyer and Samuel Eno Belinga also discuss the concept of wealth in people as it relates to Central Africa and, in particular, Cameroon. In ‚ÄúWealth in People as Wealth in Knowledge: Accumulation and Composition in Equatorial Africa,‚Äù Guyer and Eno Beligna use Moneblum (The Blue Man), a Cameroonian epic by Daniel Osomo, as evidence of the role wealth-in-people plays in political mobilization. The epic tells the story of a son, Mekui-Mengomo, who challenges his father in a quest to marry. Rather than win through his own powers, Mekui-Mengomo must call on the community to help him in this quest. Each power he needs is owned by a different person, and each must come forth individually to supply it. Mekui-Mengomo drives this process, but he cannot do it alone, or through oppressive force. Instead he must attract people to his cause. The dynamic found in Mekui-Mengomo‚Äôs story reflects the broader culture in which ‚Äúthe ability to range over vast differentiated social and geographic space for exactly the right components to produce a particular desired goal was intrinsic to social power.‚Äù Guyer, Jane I.; Samuel M. Eno Belinga (1995). \\"Wealth in People as Wealth in Knowledge: Accumulation and Composition in Equatorial Africa\\". The Journal of African History 36 (1): 91‚Äì120. doi:10.1017/S0021853700026992 Colonial Era Jeffrey Herbst draws on the wealth-in-people concept when writing about power in pre-colonial Africa more generally, and about the challenges Europeans faced in trying to impose control within this environment. Herbst argues that the Europeans were unprepared for the dynamic they found in a ‚Äúworld where the extension and consolidation of power meant something very different from the broadcasting of authority in Europe or in postcolonial regions of the developing world.‚Äù Herbst, Jeffrey. \\"\\"Power and Space in Precolonial Africa\\" and \\"The Europeans and the African Problem\\"\\" States and Power in Africa: Comparative Lessons in Authority and Control. Princeton: Princeton UP, 2000. 35. Power in Africa was ‚Äúnonterritorial,‚Äù a sharp contrast to the dynamics that had developed in Europe by the colonial era (though, Herbst argues, not necessarily earlier).Herbst, Jeffrey. \\"\\"Power and Space in Precolonial Africa\\" and \\"The Europeans and the African Problem\\"\\" States and Power in Africa: Comparative Lessons in Authority and Control. Princeton: Princeton UP, 2000. 35-37. Property was focused instead on people, who were comparatively scarce and very mobile. In order to gain power, a state or leader had to draw people in‚Äîand those people could leave, using the ample land resources available, if they were mistreated. Herbst argues that this challenge so frustrated Europeans that colonial states went to ‚Äúelaborate lengths‚Äù to give the appearance of control, and responded with violence when these attempts failed or came under threat. Herbst thus shows that wealth-in-people had an impact not only on African societies before the colonial era, but also may have played a significant role in shaping and challenging colonialism as it developed.Herbst, Jeffrey. \\"\\"Power and Space in Precolonial Africa\\" and \\"The Europeans and the African Problem\\"\\" States and Power in Africa: Comparative Lessons in Authority and Control.

He wrote Six Seconds in Dallas: A Micro-Study of the Kennedy Assassination (). He also wrote a biography of the early 19th-Century Danish philosopher S√∏ren Kierkegaard () () in 1974, and a well-received book about his own, post-academic life as a private detective, Gumshoe: Reflections in a Private Eye () in 1988. Early life Thompson was born and raised in East Liverpool, Ohio. As of November 2013, he lived in Bolinas, California. Thompson graduated from Yale University in 1957. He entered the Navy, serving in Underwater Demolition Team 21. Then he returned to Yale for his M.A. in 1962 and Ph.D. in 1964. After receiving his doctorate, he taught at Yale as Instructor of Philosophy and then moved on to teach at Haverford College, where he remained until 1976, resigning to begin a career as a private detective. In 1967 he published The Lonely Labyrinth (ASIN B0006BQ5G6), a study of Kierkegaard's thought, and in 1972, Kierkegaard: A Collection of Critical Essays (). In 1973 he published, Kierkegaard (), a biography of the Danish thinker. Six Seconds in Dallas In Six Seconds in Dallas: A Micro-Study of the Kennedy Assassination, Thompson argued that the available physical evidence, corroborating eye-witness accounts, showed that multiple shots were fired at President Kennedy in Dallas on November 22, 1963, strongly implying the existence of an assassination conspiracy. Based on an examination of the Zapruder film, Thompson's book contends that three individuals fired four shots at Kennedy in Dealey Plaza: the first shot was fired from the Texas School Book Depository and struck Kennedy in the back; the second shot was fired from the Dallas County Records building and struck Governor John Connally; the third and fourth shots were fired from the Texas School Book Depository and the \\"grassy knoll\\" respectively, and almost simultaneously struck Kennedy in the head. In November 1967, prior to the publication of the book, Fred Winship of the AP wrote that \\"some of Thompson's conclusions are based on original research in the National Archives, documents and photos not seen by the Warren Commission and interviews with eyewitnesses.\\" Time, Inc. sued Thompson and his publisher for infringement of copyright because of Zapruder frames sketched in the book. A federal court gave summary judgment to Thompson and his publisher ten months later in a landmark decision stressing fair use rights (Time Inc. v. Bernard Geis Assoc., et al., 293 F. Supp. 130, S.D.N.Y. 1968). In 1991, Bob Hoover of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that Six Seconds in Dallas \\"remains one of the most plausible explanations for the line of fire in Dealey Plaza.\\" After many years of additional research and investigation of all available evidence, bringing to bear the latest developments in forensic science in such areas as acoustics, ballistics, crime scene reconstruction, and examination of cameras and photographs, Thompson completely revised his seminal work and to some extent its conclusions. Combined with memoirs and accounts of twists and turns in his investigative activities, the 544-page result, Last Second in Dallas, is scheduled for publication by the University Press of Kansas on 13 November 2020. The book does not speculate on who was behind the Kennedy assassination, but it does conclude that the President was killed by two bullets which struck him almost simultaneously in the head, one from the front (fired from behind the stockade fence on the grassy knoll) and the other from above and to the rear. Those two shots were fired almost five seconds after the initial burst of gunfire -- apparently three shots in a 2.6 second span and thus not all fired by the same person -- all coming from above and behind the car. One or more of those struck Kennedy in the back, and also wounded Governor Connolly. Neither of the final two bullets, Thompson had earlier concluded, was fired from the Texas School Book Depository, and thus not by Lee Harvey Oswald. The new work revises that theory, suggesting that the final shot to the head (from behind) did apparently come from the School Book Depository window. The theory detailed in his new book, Thompson contends, accounts for the first time in a coherent way for all the forensic evidence, eyewitness testimony, and photographic evidence. The Umbrella Man In 2011, The New York Times posted a short documentary film by Errol Morris featuring Thompson's commentary about the \\"Umbrella Man\\", a man holding a black umbrella during the assassination of Kennedy.

It is now the sound studio available to independent producers, musicians and artists in residence at Harvestworks. Originally, Studio PASS was located in the Flatiron District in Manhattan at 16 west 22 St. It moved to its current home along with the rest of Harvestworks at 596 Broadway in 1987. The studio included advanced instruments like the Fairlight CMI, and proved effective for artists such as Bob Ostertag, They Might Be Giants, David Van Tieghem, Brenda Hutchinson, Marina Rosenfeld and George Lewis and Fred Frith. The board of directors has included people such as Bob Moog and Suzanne Ciani.Keyboard Magazine May 1986 Everyone who works there volunteers. Paul Geluso is the current director of Studio PASS. Since its inception, Studio PASS has always offered classes and tutorials.  Classes  Since 1983, Harvestworks has offered classes relating to technology and art. In 1983, composers needed to learn about MIDI, the Musical Instrument Digital Interface to be able to control their musical synthesizers. in the 90‚Äôs, the community wanted to know about object-oriented programming languages such as Max/MSP and algorithmic music programs such as Dr. T and M. In 1996, Harvestworks offered classes in Photoshop, Macromedia Director, creating CD roms, Adobe Premiere, HTML, post-production and Javascript and taught acoustic engineering, digital art, programming, computational design and sound engineering in 2015. The classes are taught by professionals in their field and have included Matthew Ostrowski, Luke DuBois, Dafna Naphtali and Eugene Kogan.  Major projects and events  Harvestworks has sponsored a number of events and projects over the years. In 1983, the Tellus Audio Cassette Magazine was created. The 5th and 6th issues of the magazine in 1984 were compiled into a double issue curated by Claudia Gould, Joseph Nechvatal and Carol Parkinson. The magazine featured Louise Lawler, Richard Prince, Perry Hoberman, David Wojnarowicz, Barbara Barg, Barbara Ess and Rhys Chatham amongst others. In 1987, Harvestworks had its first major show, the Soundwave Exhibition,http://collections.si.edu/search/record/siris_sil_643214 curated by Gerald Lindahl and Bill and Mary Buchen and exhibited in the former City Gallery at 2 Columbus Circle. In 1992, the first usergroup for the programming language MAX was established at Harvestworks, and an exhibition called ‚ÄúThe Interactive Show: New Audio/Video Installation Works‚Äù was presented at the Threadwaxing Space,http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/thread-waxing-space- records-13700 another arts venue in Lower Manhattan.

In 2004, Harvestworks had a weekend-long symposium called ‚ÄúMixing It Up! The Interactive Technology Project.‚Äù In 2006, Harvestworks ran the ‚ÄúNew Interfaces for Artistic Expression‚Äù Symposium. From 2007 onwards, Harvestworks runs the biennial New York Electronic Arts Festival (NYEAF.)  New York Electronic Arts Festival  NYEAF (New York Electronic Arts Festival) is a biennial new media electronic arts festival produced by Harvestworks centered on Governor‚Äôs Island. It started in 2007 and has operated in multiple locations across New York City, often at the same time.http://www.clydefitchreport.com/2009/09/harvestworks-turning-over-new- nyeaf-a-month-long-celebration-of-electronic-art/ Notable artists have included George Lewis, Trimpin, Stephen Vitiello, Andrea Parkins, Morton Subotnick, They Might Be Giants, J.G. Thirlwell, R. Luke DuBois, Ikue Mori, Bora Yoon and many others. NYEAF collaborates with The River to River Festival as well.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nycarts/new-music-and-ways-to- lis_b_3537241.html The art varies from artist to artist, with some being spiritual in nature, some experimental and some natural, but all talking about the use of technology in society. The purpose of NYEAF is to provide high- quality electronic and digital art through workshops, concerts and exhibitions. Attendees get an overview of how technology is being used in various artistic disciplines, and have the opportunity to take part in a discussion about how these technologies will continue to shape contemporary art practice.  Funding  Harvestworks programs are made possible with funds from New York State Council on the Arts, the National Endowment for the Arts, the NYC Dept. of Cultural Affairs, The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Foundation for Contemporary Arts, Lily Auchincloss Foundation, Materials for the Arts, Jerome Foundation, the Edwards Foundation Arts Fund, Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Friends of Harvestworks.

History The city of Kokomo rolled out the buses in late 2010 which was the first bus system Kokomo had seen since the late 1960s. It started with just two smaller sized buses, and just two routes, the Red Line, and the Blue Line. The two routes criss crossed town north and south (Red Line), and east and west (Blue Line), and were both free. From 2010‚Äì2013 that is how it remained with only 118 bus stops. In mid 2013 the city rolled out two more buses and three more routes, with the Green Line, Orange Line, and Yellow Line being added to the two lines before. The previous Red Line was also altered in its route in 2013. The two new buses were much larger than the previous buses, and has an electronic reader on the front stating the line the bus runs. Ridership continued to be free for the riders, the buses were also all equipped with free wifi during this upgrade as well, and continued to run from 6:30 am to 6 pm. After the 2013 expansion the ridership increased in 2014 to around 2,000 riders daily. Routes There are now five routes running through Kokomo. The Red Line goes south from the Downtown transit point and goes down Apperson Way making its way to Indian Heights where it circles the neighborhood on Council Ring Boulevard. The red line goes by Garden Square apartments, Terrace Towers, Maple Creast plaza on Washington Street, Marsh, Howard County BMV, and Indian Heights neighborhood. Then there is the Blue Line which goes from the Walmart area in the east to the K-Mart area in the west stopping at the transit center among other things in between. Its main attractions are Walmart, Planet Fitness, Meijers, Sam's Club, Hobby Lobby, the Markland Mall, Kroger, and K-Mart among other things along the way. Then there is the Green Line, and the Yellow Line which is run by the same bus and has a very similar path, the difference is the Yellow Line travels more central north picking up trailer courts, and apartment buildings, and then the Green Line travels more north and then east picking up for Ivy Tech College, Save-A-Lot, and Dollar General area up on Morgan Street. Then, finally, there is the Orange Line. Like the Red Line it also runs south, except south via Webster street, and ends up going west on some parts. Picks up for Kokomo High School, and doctor offices along Dixon Road. Some routes have transfer points with each other as well as the Downtown transfer point. The Orange, and Red lines transfer in front of Krogers at the Maple Creast plaza, and then the Blue and Red lines transfer on the corner of Apperson Way, and Markland Avenue at the national guard armory for the red line, then just a couple blocks down the Blue Line stops at Jay Street and Markland Avenue by the Marathon there. Route List *Red Line *Orange Line *Green Line *Yellow Line *Blue Line Buses Both bus types are in two different forms of a trolley. The original two buses are wooden decked out on the inside, and has wooden benches all facing classroom style. The newer buses have some seats up against the wall, new standing places along the seats, and an easier cord to pull to tell the driver when to stop. Both buses have bike racks, and wheelchair ramps equipped on them. The newer buses are said to be in San Francisco trolley style.

History  Telefe had a trusted and respected news service during the first half of the 1990s, but after 1995, was often criticised for the sensational style adopted by its then news director Horacio Larrosa (former Channel 9 news director and inventor of Nuevediario). In 1999, hundreds of workers were sacked, closing Red de Noticias (Telefe's cable news channel) and the 7:00 pm edition was canceled, limiting the news to the midday report. From 2002, the newscast underwent important modifications, such as graphics, new presenters (newsreaders Cristina P√©rez and Rodolfo Barili), reinstatement of the evening edition and a new editorial line, which made the newscast recover credibility. In November 2006, Telefe began broadcasting its editions from a newly built newsroom, and slowly returned to the tabloid style of the 1990s. In 2008, the 7:00 pm hour- long edition was moved to 8:00 pm, trying to compete with Channel 13's main edition.

It existed from November 1918 until its union with the Free State of Bavaria on 1 July 1920. History With the abdication Harald Sandner, Coburg im 20. Jahrhundert [Coburg in the 20th Century], p. 67 of the reigning duke, Charles Edward, on 14 November 1918, the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha ended in the wake of the November Revolution. It split into two Free States ‚Äì , from the Duchy of Saxe- Gotha in the north, and Coburg, from the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg in the south. Both states kept their own diets and ministers, which they had inherited from the former monarchy. Ulrich Hess, Geschichte Th√ºringens 1866‚Äì1914 [History of Thuringen 1866‚Äì1914] (Weimar: Verlag Hermann Bohlaus, 1991), , p. 226 On 9 February 1919, elections were held for the eleven seats in the State Assembly of Coburg. The List I of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) received 58.6 percent, while the List II for the National Liberal Party, German Democratic Party (DDP) and the Coburger Farmers Party earned 41.4 percent. That meant the SPD would have seven seats, leaving the remaining four to the others. The President of the State Assembly would be a Social Democratic, Erhard Kirchner. The State Assembly passed on 10 March 1919 the \\"Temporary Law of the Legislation and Administration of the Free State of Coburg\\" [Vorl√§ufiges Gesetz √ºber die Gesetzgebung und Verwaltung im Freistaate Coburg], the Provisional Constitution of Coburg. The government would be run by the three-member State Council, consisting of Hermann Quarck (National Liberal, previously the leader of the Ministerial Cabinet of Coburg) as the Chairman and two SPD deputies, Franz Klingler and Reinhold Artmann. The separation of the two parts of the former Duchy was finally complete on 12 April 1919, when a state treaty covering the management of the common administration of the Free States of Coburg and Gotha was signed. Map of the Free State of Coburg On 7 June 1919 Duke Charles Edward finalized the settlement with the Free State of Coburg over his properties and compensation. He received 1.5 million Marks as his compensation for his following properties ‚Äì approximately 4,500 hectares (11,120 acres) of forests, numerous buildings and individual properties as well as the art treasures of the Veste Coburg, the Veste's courtyard garden museum, his personal library, the Ducal Theater, Schloss Rosenau and its estate, the Veste Coburg, the Schloss Ehrenburg, and the State Archives of Coburg. The art treasures of the Veste, the collections of the courtyard museums and the furnishing of Schloss Ehrenburg would be the property of the Coburger Landesstiftung (Coburg State Foundation), while the rest would go to the Free State. Schloss Callenberg, with its estate and gardens, Schloss Eichhof, and the Schweizerei Rosenau all remained the property of the duke with the total area of 533 hectares (1,317 acres). The National Liberal Quarck, according to the Constitution of 10 March 1919, held the most senior position in the government and administration. He was both the Chairman of the State Government and the Head of the Department of State. Rainer Hambrecht, ‚ÄúFreistaat Coburg, 1918-1920‚Äù [‚ÄúFree State of Coburg, 1918‚Äì1920‚Äù] After the SPD fraction, which had the majority in the State Assembly, named Reinhold Artmann to represent Coburg in the State Council of Thuringia (Board of Directors for the Law Enforcement), J√ºrgen Erdmann, Coburg, Bayern und das Reich 1918‚Äì1923 [Coburg, Bavaria and the Empire 1918‚Äì1923], p. 40 he rejoined Quarck in their offices on 2 July 1919. This was followed on 11 July 1919 by a constitutional amendment that abolished the personal union of the State Council and Assembly. Franz Klingler was then named as the new Chairman of the State Government and Hans Schack (DDP) became the newest member of the State Council of Coburg. The leadership of the Ministry was given to Ernst Fritsch, an administrative lawyer, with the official title of Secretary. Since the political leaders did not consider the new Free State as economically viable, they sought a union with another state. It was therefore assumed in March and May 1919 that the conferences with other Thuringian states would create the state of Thuringia but, ultimately, they did not result in an agreement that would please all the sides. Along with these conferences, official negotiations for a possible merger began with Bavaria in the middle of June and with Prussia one month later. However, Prussia had already declined the proposed union as early as August. But Bavaria was receptive to the merger. Unlike the State of Thuringia, it was able to make many concessions, especially on the matter of the preservation of the cultural institutions of Coburg. On 30 November 1919, the first democratic referendum in Germany Harald Sandner, Coburg im 20. Jahrhundert [Coburg in the 20th Century], p. 70 was finally held to determine the future of the Coburger Land. With a turnout of about 70%, 88% of the population voted on the question, ‚ÄúSoll Coburg dem Gemeinschaftsvertrag der th√ºringischen Staaten beitreten? [Should Coburg join the Communal Treaty of the Thuringian States]?‚Äù with a No on the ballot and therefore for the merger with Bavaria. Rainer Hambrecht, ‚ÄúVereinigung Coburgs mit Bayern, 1. Juli 1920 [Union of Coburg with Bavaria, 1 July 1920]‚Äù Harald Bachmann, ‚ÄúCoburgs Anschlu√ü an Bayern vor 75 Jahren [‚ÄúCoburg‚Äôs Merger with Bavaria of 75 Years‚Äù]‚Äù, in: Coburger Geschichtsbl√§tter [Coburger Historical Papers], Heft [Issue] 3, 1995, p. 113 Coburger Zeitung [Coburger Newspaper] 27 November 1919, front page The reasons for this clear-cut result were manifold. On the one hand, the people had always seen themselves more strongly associated with Franconia than with Thuringia. On the other hand, they were influenced by the fact that, during the First World War, food had to be sent to Thuringia, as well as by their significantly stronger accommodation with the views of Bavaria. Map of the Enclave of K√∂nigsberg With a new state treaty signed on 14 February 1920, the union of Coburg with Bavaria was set. In it, Coburg was given financial guarantees for its State Foundation, its agricultural and forestry trade associations, its Chamber of Commerce, from which the Chamber of Trades section became the new Chamber of Trades, the State Hospital and the Landestheater Coburg. In addition, Coburg received as its compensation for the loss of the State Ministry the commitment for a new regional court of law. The Free State of Bavaria was, therefore, committing itself to undertake the maximum of 40% of the deficit of the Landestheater Coburg and 75% of the State Hospital. Therefore, with the union of the Free States of Coburg and Bavaria on 1 July 1920, almost 600 years of political autonomy of the Coburger Land came to an end. According to the State Treaty, the Free State of Coburg would be assigned to the (Kreis, now Regierungsbezirk [administrative district] of Upper Franconia (Oberfranken). The district of K√∂nigsberg with the town of K√∂nigsberg, as well as the communities of Altershausen, D√∂rflis, Erlsdorf, Hellingen, Kottenbrunn and Nassach, were sent to the district (Bezirk, now Landkreis) of Hofheim in Lower Franconia (Unterfranken). The Referendum of 1919 and the subsequent union with Bavaria had unexpected consequences in 1945 at the end of the Second World War. The territory of the former Free State of Coburg now became a part of the American Occupation Zone of Germany, while the Thuringian side stayed in the Soviet Occupation Zone and later East Germany until 1990.

The effect is strongest when the mean free path of the gas molecules is comparable to the dimensions of the gas container.

Fitzpatrick, 2009, \\"Instrumentation and analytical techniques suitable for broadband acoustic resonance dissolution spectroscopy\\", US Patent, US8813566B2, which is used in analytical chemistry. It involves the analysis of the changes in sound frequency generated when a solute dissolves in a solvent, by harnessing the hot chocolate effect first described by Frank S. Crawford. The technique is partly based on the solubility difference of gas in pure solvents and in solutions. The dissolution of a compound in a pure solvent results in the generation of gas bubbles in the solvent, due to the lowering of gas solubility in the resulting solution, as well as the introduction of gases with the solute. The presence of these gas bubbles increases the compressibility of the solution, thereby lowering the velocity of sound in the solution. This effect can be monitored by means of the frequency change of acoustic resonances that are mechanically produced in the solvent. Principles of the BARDS response Water is approximately 800 times more dense than air. However, air is approximately 15,000 times more compressible than water. The velocity of sound, œÖ, in a homogeneous liquid or gas is given by the following equation: : \\\\upsilon = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{K\\\\rho}} where œÅ is the mass density and K the compressibility of the gas or liquid. K is given as: : K = \\\\frac{\\\\left ({dV \\\\over dp} \\\\right )}{V} where V is the volume of the medium, and dV is the volume decrease due to the pressure increase dp of the sound wave. When water is filled with air bubbles, the fluid density is essentially the density of water, and the air will contribute significantly to the compressibility. Crawford derived the relationship between fractional bubble volume and sound velocity in water, and hence the sound frequency in water, given as.Frank S. Crawford, May 1982, \\"The hot chocolate effect\\", American Journal of Physics, Volume 50, Issue 5, pp. 398‚Äì404, doi:10.1119/1.13080 (Abstract only) : {\\\\upsilon_w \\\\over \\\\upsilon} = {f_w \\\\over f} = {(1+\\\\alpha V_a)}^{1 \\\\over 2} where œÖw and œÖ are the velocities of sound in pure and bubble-filled water, respectively, fw and f are the frequencies of sound in pure and bubble-filled water, respectively, Va is defined as the fractional volume occupied by gas bubbles, and Œ± is a constant. When the solvent is water and the gas is air, the value of Œ± is 1.49 √ó 104. The effect of changes in solution density and solution compressibility are additive and reinforce the phenomenon, causing a significant decrease in the velocity of sound and, therefore, a significant decrease in the frequency of sound passing through an aerated solution.

Despite similarities in synonyms, Bariadorgia/Carcajolo blanc is not a color mutation of the red Spanish wine grape Parraleta which is also known as Carcajolo near on Sardinia.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 89-90 Allen Lane 2012 History and relationship to other grapes The islands of Sardinia (south) and Corsica where Bariadorgia is found. While Bariadorgia was first mentioned in 1822 growing in the commune of Sart√®ne on Corsica under the synonym Carcajola, ampelographers such as Gustave Fo√´x of the Viticultural College at the University of Montpellier and colleague of Pierre Viala have speculated since at least the early 20th century that grape was likely introduced from neighboring Sardinia. The commune of Alghero on the northwest coast of the island has been mentioned as the possible home of Bariadorgia. While the origins of the name Bariadorgia is unclear, the synonym Carcajolo is believed to be derived from the Italian word caricagiola which means \\"heavily laden\\" and could be a reference to the large clusters that the Bariadorgia vine produce which can be heavy and weigh down the cane as the grapes near harvest. In the early 21st century, DNA analysis showed that Bariadorgia was identical to plantings of Gregu bianco planted around the Campidano region of Sardinia. DNA profiling has further shown that the grape is not related to the Corsican grape Biancu Gentile nor is a color mutation of the Spanish wine grape Parraleta which is known as Carcajolo near on Sardinia. Viticulture Bariadorgia is a mid-ripening grape variety that needs to be planted on sunny, well-situated sites in warm climate regions in order to achieve full physiological ripeness. The vine tends to produce big clusters of large size berries but usually has a relatively low sugar levels. Bariadorgia is highly sensitive to the viticultural hazards of botrytis bunch rot and powdery mildew. Wine regions Bariadorgia/Carcajola blanc is found in only isolated plantings around the communes of Figari (orange) and Sart√®ne (grey). In its viticultural homeland of Sardinia, Bariadorgia is near extinct with only isolated plantings of Gregu bianco in the Campidano region only being recently identified in 2007 as being, in fact, Bariadorgia. Slightly more significant plantings, but still very isolated, of the grape are found on the neighboring French island of Corsica around the southern communes of Figari and Sart√®ne. In French wine, Bariadorgia (known here as Carcajola blanc) is only authorized in a few wines in the Vin de Corse Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC) and the Vin de Pays de l'√éle de Beaut√©.

It was published by Belgrade based publisher \\"Omnibus\\" in 2011, being the first critical comics lexicon in Eastern Europe.  Summary  For the first time in the research of popular culture, there has been critically drawn together, in one place, the most important works and authors‚Äô opuses from one of the centres of European comics‚ÄîFormer Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia in the 20th century was a region which was not only massively developing comics‚Äô culture, but was also producing many important works in the history of comics, and even some masterpieces. This tradition has continued even today in the countries which were a part of the former Yugoslavia: Serbia, Croatia, North Macedonia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. The book provides basic information, panel examples and critiques or citations from critiques for about 400 comics from about 400 authors (about 200 artists, 150 script writers, 50 writers whose works were used in comics). With the help of about 100 comics critics from the whole of the Western Balkans, the book has been written and compiled by three co-authors ‚Äì ≈Ωivojin Tamburiƒá (who is also initiator and editor of the book), Zdravko Zupan and Zoran Stefanoviƒá ‚Äì who have been devoted to comics all their lives as readers, artists, researchers, promoters and collectors. The criteria that were used for the selection of comics are aesthetic and professional achievements, popularity, originality, sociological relevance and curiosities. The book is distinguished by many special research materials and a rediscovery of many forgotten authors‚Äô opuses after many decades of obscurity. The book is published in Serbian, but the most important parts are translated into English.  Reception  \\"In this book, these intrepid, discriminating compilers have realised an exceptional achievement by combing diligently through thousands of pages of comics and comics reviews to distill a captivating alphabet of artists and writers who have shaped and enhanced not only the comics of their homeland but in several cases the comics of the world.\\" ‚Äî Paul Gravett, writer, curator, international comics historian, director of Comica Festival, London \\"Jury's decision was based on the excellence and grandeur of this project, which thoroughly analyzes, systematizes, and popularizes 20th century comic books in former Yugoslavia.

The story revolves around the life of gamer Haruo Yaguchi, the coin-op gaming setting (most notably Fighting games), the changes that develop within both over time, and his relationship with quiet female gamer Akira Ono. Known as a ‚Äô90s arcade romantic comedy, the series is notable for its unique art style, and thoroughly accurate depictions of the multitude of gaming software, hardware, and even culture that are featured. An anime television series adaptation by J.C.Staff and SMDE aired from July to September 2018. A second season aired from October to December 2019. Characters ; : (Japanese); Johnny Yong Bosch (English) :A young man who is dismal in various facets of life: He's not academic, not athletic, and not very attractive. The only thing he's got going for him is an insane amount of mad gamer skills. He rules the arcade scene as \\"Beastly Fingers Haruo\\", until he meets his match during a fateful encounter with Akira Ono while playing Street Fighter II. Undeterred, he seeks to challenge and one day out play her, considering her his rival. While he starts off as a snarky brat with an ego bigger than any winning streak he could rack up in Street Fighter, he eventually grows out of it. However, he never abandons his dedication and love for gaming, which almost borders on unhealthy obsession. On the bright side, this pure passion for gaming is what leads him to finding some of his closest friends. ; : (Japanese); Christine Marie Cabanos (English) :The daughter of the Ono zaibatsu, Akira is rich, popular, and multi-talented ‚Äì the polar opposite of Haruo. However, in attempt to escape the strict educational regimen she faces at home, she sneaks away every so often to play in game centers where she showcases her exceptional gaming skills. She initially encounters Haruo during a match of Street Fighter II, and from then on bonds with him over their mutual love for gaming. She never talks, and communicates solely through gestures and facial expressions. She also appears as a guest support character in Million Arthur: Arcana Blood.https://www.dualshockers.com/million-arthur-aracana-blood-western- release-steam/ ; : (Japanese); Erika Harlacher (English) :A girl in Haruo's class throughout junior high.

She has a natural instinct for fighting games, which transforms her into a powerful force to be reckoned with as both a gamer, and a rival for Haruo's affections. After a fateful showdown at her and Haruo's usual stomping grounds, she developed a bit of a sadistic side whenever Haruo's around. This frightening skill garnered the attention of the \\"Mizonokuchi Force\\" leader, Nikotama, who helped Koharu truly awaken her love for fighting games. ; : (Japanese); Lucien Dodge (English) :One of Haruo's classmates during junior high and high school who is his best guy friend.

This valley was carved by the outlet of Glacial Lake Duluth, which occupied what is now the western portion of Lake Superior, during the retreat of the Superior lobe of Wisconsin glaciation. This outlet flowed southwestward through the valley, to what is now the St. Croix River. As the glacier melted, and the level of Lake Superior dropped, the direction of flow shifted to its present northeastward course, towards Lake Superior. A high point in a vast bog near Solon Springs marks the Saint Lawrence River Divide between the watersheds of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. This divide was used for thousands of years, by Native Americans, European explorers, fur traders, and settlers as a portage between the two watersheds. The upper Bois Brule valley possesses many unique ecological attributes and remains in nearly pre-settlement condition. The river here passes through extensive areas of coniferous swamps and bogs, alder thickets, and sedge meadows. These are fed by numerous groundwater seeps and springs, which contain clean, cold water, and keep the slopes of the valley perpetually moist, which discouraged post-settlement logging activities. This has led to an exceptionally rich flora, including numerous rare species, such as fairy slipper, northern black currant, small yellow lady slipper, marsh willowherb, and the state-endangered Lapland buttercup. Bird life is also diverse, and includes the following species: boreal chickadee, black-backed woodpecker, Canada jay, northern saw-whet owl, Cape May warbler, and northern goshawk. Rare insects found here include the Jutta Arctic, ski-tailed emerald (Somatochlora elongata), and zebra clubtail (Stylurus scudderi).  Location and access  Brule Glacial Spillway is located in east-central Douglas County, within the Brule River State Forest, approximately northeast of Solon Springs. The natural area consists of three separate parcels along an 8-mile (13 km) stretch of the upper Bois Brule River. The site can be accessed via canoe, with a canoe landing located at Stone's Bridge, on County Highway S. The North Country National Scenic Trail also passes through a portion of the site, a section of which is boardwalk through a vast cedar swamp. A third point of access is at the end of Stone Chimney Road, east of County Highway P.

Originally companies would take the information from their job applications forms to see what would be useful in predicting the job performance of employees.Schmitt, N., & Chan, D. (1998). Personnel selection: A theoretical approach. Thousand Oaks: CA: Sage. Over time the amount and type of biographical information collected expanded and was put into the BIB assessments we find today.Schmitt, N., & Chan, D. (1998). Personnel selection: A theoretical approach. Thousand Oaks: CA: Sage. The modern BIB is a self- report instrument that includes questions about past personal and work experiences, as well as interests, opinions, values and attitudes. Its items are all presented in the multiple choice format. The emphasis is on past behaviors because they are best predictors of future behaviors.Cascio, W. F., & Aguinis, H. (2010). Applied Psychology in Human Resource Management, Prentice Hall. Typically, BIBs are designed to predict success in a particular job because they contribute to a predictor sample, which is used to make personnel selection decisions. There are two types of BIBs: the empirical and the rational.Stokes, G. S., & Searcy, C. A. (1999). Specification of scales in biodata form development: Rational vs. empirical and global vs. specific. International Journal of Selection and Assessment, 7(2), 72-85. With the empirical BIB, each item is correlated with a measure of job performance or other criterion of job success. Those items that can predict job success are retained for the BIB. The rationale approach is to start with a job analysis to determine the knowledge, skill, ability, and other job characteristics (KSAOs) needed for the job. Items are chosen that reflect the required KSAOs. A great deal of research has shown that BIBs are able to predict job success.Breaugh, J. A. (2009). The use of biodata for employee selection: Past research and future directions. Human Resource Management Review, 19(3), 219-231.

As of August 1, 2015, the website has become a portal of Twoo; Humor Rainbow Inc does not disclose whether the original contents still exist.  History  Formspring was launched in Indianapolis in November 2009 by the founder of online form builder Formstack, Ade Olonoh. He noticed that most of their users were using the service to create \\"ask me anything\\" forms and decided to launch a separate site to make this easier. At launch, Formspring was referred to by its full URL, formspring.me, to distinguish it from Formstack, which was at that time also called Formspring.com. Formspring.me gained 1 million registered users in its first 45 days, so the original Formspring website was renamed to avoid confusion between the two sites. Formspring was soon spun off into a separate company and moved to San Francisco, California. Due to its sudden popularity, a number of websites quickly implemented similar features, such as ASKfm, Tumblr, and MyYearbook's \\"Ask Me\\" services. On June 3, 2010, Formspring launched a major redesign, overhauling every aspect of the website. In response to its growth, Formspring received a $2.5 million series seed round of funding from a large group of angel investors, including SV Angel, Lowercase Capital, Kevin Rose, and Dave Morin. In January 2011, it received an additional $11.5 million series A round of funding from Redpoint Ventures and Baseline Ventures. To further guide the site's growth and explore revenue streams for the company, Formspring named Rogelio (Ro) Choy as COO in April 2011. On June 28, 2011, Formspring announced that its 25 millionth user had signed up. In June 2011, Formspring launched features for celebrities to better communicate with their fans, including verified accounts. Celebrity Formspring users could be found on the site's \\"Formspring Favorites\\" section, which categorized verified users by music, comedy and various entertainment verticals. In November 2011, Formspring launched a media partnership program, partnering for the first time with media outlets including MTV, Hearst, Funny or Die and The Huffington Post. As of early 2012, Formspring had reached over 4 billion responses. In February 2012, Formspring was named a top ten most innovative social media site by Fast Company.  Features  Users of the site could follow others privately. While logged in as a registered user, people could also ask questions of their followers from the homepage. Spring.me also asked one question per day named \\"Formspring Question of the Day\\" which was flashed in users' inbox. In January 2011, Spring.me added a smile button which acted similar to the Like button on Facebook. In September 2011, Formspring released an iPhone Application and several months later, in January 2012, further added to its mobile presence with the launch of its Android Application. Also in January 2012, Formspring launched two additional features to the service. One new tool allowed users to sort responses to questions by the number of \\"Smiles\\" received to bring the most liked content to the top of response streams. The added functionality aimed to give users the power to curate the best content on the site. In addition to letting users see their top smiled responses, the new feature allowed Formspringers to view top responses from other users and also see the most smiled responses to a question that was asked to multiple people at once. The second new functionality launched gave Formspringers the option to choose whether they wanted to publicly or privately follow the accounts of other users. As part of this feature, Formspring users were then able to see how many others on the site were following their account.  Controversies  Since its inception, Formspring garnered controversies, especially among teenagers, as it opened doors for harassment and cyberbullying due to the anonymity of the entries. A fight between several students at a high school in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, started after an argument over Formspring and it received some media attention in February 2010. On 12 March 2010, a news article, which later turned out to be a hoax, reported Formspring creators planning to release personal information about its users via Twitter and other social networking sites. Formspring has stated on its company blog that it will never publicly reveal anonymous information of its users. On 22 March 2010, Alexis Pilkington, a 17-year-old New York high school graduate, committed suicide, reportedly after several insulting comments targeting her had been posted on Formspring in the days leading up to her death. Soon after, a local grassroots boycott of the Formspring site began. In February 2011, an incident allegedly prompted by bullying on Formspring led to the death of 15-year-old Natasha MacBryde from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, United Kingdom. The Coroner's inquiry heard that she received anonymous personal abuse via the website on 13 February; this appears to have compounded bullying and teenage anxiety to a level, where MacBryde took her own life on 14 February after researching suicide methods. According to the Daily Telegraph, Det Sgt Shanie Erwin told the inquest that Natasha was known to have received a short anonymous message containing personal abuse via the Formspring networking site on February 13. The message, which was read to the jury by Det Sgt Erwin, derided MacBryde for \\"hiding\\" behind make-up. It ended: ‚ÄúStart acting nicer to people or you will lose everyone. Mark my words.‚Äù In September 2011, another bullying incident, involving anonymous harassment on Formspring, led to the death of a 14-year- old. Jamey Rodemeyer, a student from Williamsville North High School in New York state, United States, committed suicide on 18 September after repeated incidents of bullying in real life and on Formspring. Rodemeyer's video, \\"It Gets Better\\", specifically called out Formspring as a factor in contributing to the anti-gay bullying impacting his life. In March 2011, Formspring participated in a White House Conference on Bullying Prevention along with MTV, Facebook, Survey Monkey and others. At the conference, Formspring announced that it was working with The MIT Media Lab to develop new approaches in detecting cyberbullying, and to design interfaces that would help prevent or mitigate when it occurs. In January 2012, Formspring also announced that it was a sponsor of the Great American NO BULL Challenge, a nationwide video contest that encourages teenagers to stand up to bullying. The concept of Formspring was copied by the creators of Ask.fm, who used the same format of allowing anonymous questioning by people who knew each other offline, which some experts believe is a toxic mix that will inevitably lead to trouble for some users. Both sites have been linked to several teenage suicides.Binns, Amy (2014) \\"Twitter City and Facebook Village: teenage girls' personas and experiences influenced by choice architecture in social networking sites\\", Journal of Media Practice Vol. 15, Iss. 2, 2014 http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14682753.2014.960763 free version available at https://www.academia.edu/9345514/Twitter_City_Facebook_Village_Teenage_girls_personas_and_experiences_influenced_by_choice_architecture_in_social_networking_sitesBinns, Amy (2013) Facebook‚Äôs Ugly Sisters: Anonymity and Abuse on Formspring and Ask.fm.

He built the Red Lion playhouse, and financed, with his brother-in- law, James Burbage, the building of the Theatre in Shoreditch, in which he was to have had a half interest. He also leased the George Inn in Whitechapel with a friend, Robert Miles. The latter two ventures, particularly the financing of the Theatre, bankrupted him, and he fell out with both James Burbage and Robert Miles. It was suspected that his death in 1586 was caused by blows received during an altercation with Miles. His widow, Margaret, backed financially by Miles, was involved in litigation with Burbage over Brayne's half interest in the Theatre until her own death in 1593. Family John Brayne, born in about 1541, was the eldest child of Thomas Brayne (d.1562), a London tailor. He had a sister, Ellen Brayne (c. 1542‚Äì1613), who on 23 April 1559 married James Burbage (c. 1531‚Äì1597). Early career On 13 March 1554 he was apprenticed to the London grocer John Bull. After completing his apprenticeship he carried on business in Bucklersbury in London, where he also had a house. On 14 January 1565 he married Margaret Stowers, by whom he had four children who were baptized at St Stephen Walbrook and died young: Robert (b.1565), Roger (b.1566), Rebecca (b.1568) and John (b.1573), and possibly a posthumous daughter, Katherine (d.1593). In 1567 Brayne hired two carpenters to build a playhouse in the yard of the Red Lion, a farmhouse east of Aldgate near Mile End. According to Berry this was the first professional playhouse in the British Isles specifically built for that purpose 'since Roman times'. It consisted of a stage, with scaffolds for seating the audience, and Brayne is thought to have spent no more than ¬£15 on its construction. The first play scheduled to be performed there was The Story of Sampson, on 8 July 1567, but nothing further is known about the performance or the theatre itself. The Theatre in Shoreditch Modern drawing of ground plan of the Theatre in Shoreditch Brayne's earliest financial involvement with his brother-in-law, James Burbage, was in 1568, when they lent money to a third party. Eight years later, on 13 April 1576, Burbage leased part of the grounds of the dissolved Holywell Priory in Shoreditch from Giles Allen for the purpose of building a playhouse. To help finance the scheme he took in Brayne as a partner, and it was later claimed that Brayne had supplied most of the ¬£700 spent in the construction of the Theatre, and had bankrupted himself in so doing. Brayne sold his business and house in Bucklersbury, and by 1577‚Äì8 was no longer active as a grocer. There was no written agreement governing the terms of the partnership, and Brayne and Burbage soon fell out. Brayne, who was now childless, failed to revise his will to leave his interest in the Theatre to James Burbage's children, as he had promised to do, and Burbage failed to grant Brayne a half interest in the 21-year ground lease which he had signed with Giles Allen on 13 April 1576, and kept it solely in his own name. On 9 August 1577 an assignment of lease was drawn up, and on 22 May 1578 Burbage signed a bond in the amount of ¬£400 requiring him to assign a half interest in the ground lease to Brayne, but this was never done. Brayne accused Burbage of double-dealing, and in the following month the partners submitted their dispute to arbitration by two friends, in the course of which Burbage struck Brayne and they fell to fisticuffs. On 12 July 1578 the arbitrators submitted the articles containing their decision, and both Burbage and Brayne signed bonds in the amount of ¬£200 as a guarantee of performance. On 26 September 1579 Burbage borrowed ¬£125 8s 11d from the London grocer John Hyde, in return for which he mortgaged the ground lease of the Theatre for a one-year term. Hyde was not repaid, and the ground lease was forfeited to Hyde on 27 September 1580. Hyde allowed Burbage to continue operating the Theatre and extended the lease, but it was again forfeited to Hyde for non-payment. Hyde had Burbage arrested for debt in June 1582, and tried to put Brayne out as part owner of the Theatre. George Inn Meanwhile in January 1580 Brayne had taken a 24-year lease on the George Inn in Whitechapel, and had moved into the premises. The George was not at the time functioning as an inn, and Brayne, again without a written agreement, formed a partnership with a longtime friend, the London goldsmith Robert Miles (d.1614), to \\"restore the inn trade\\" and share both the expenses and profits. They were soon quarrelling bitterly. In order to evade his creditors for debts incurred in connection with both the Theatre and the George Inn, Brayne signed various deeds of gift of his property. He died in June 1586,According to Wallace, Brayne died in August 1586; . allegedly as a result of blows at the hands of Robert Miles, and was buried 15 June 1586 in the churchyard at St Mary Matfelon, in Whitechapel. In his will dated 1 July 1578 he left his property to his wife, Margaret, and to his brother-in-law, Edward Stowers of Alphamstone, Essex. Lawsuits Brayne's widow, Margaret, initially sued Miles for her share in the George Inn, and \\"pursued him at law for murder (he is said to have been 'tried for murder\\" at a coroner's inquest). She then gave birth to a daughter, Katherine, and \\"she and Miles became close friends\\". Despite this, Miles did not grant her a share in the George Inn. At the time of Brayne's death, the only legal documents that established that he had had any financial interest in the Theatre were the two bonds which he had managed to get Burbage to sign. Burbage allowed Margaret Brayne a share of the profits for a short time, but then cut her off. At about the same time Hyde, as legal owner of the forfeited ground lease, falsely represented that he had sold his interest to his father- in-law, George Clough, and tried to remove James Burbage from the Theatre and replace him with Clough. In early 1587 Margaret Brayne, with financial backing from Robert Miles, sued James Burbage at common law in an attempt to either recover on the bonds or obtain a half interest in the ground lease and the profits of the Theatre. In the same year the executors of Robert Gardner, to whom Brayne had made one of his deeds of gift, also sued Burbage. In the autumn of 1588 Burbage brought an action of his own against Margaret Brayne in Chancery, and Margaret Brayne then counter-sued in Chancery. The legal battles continued for a decade, with Burbage always emerging the victor. While these lawsuits were ongoing, both James Burbage and Margaret Brayne sought to obtain an assignment of the ground lease from Hyde. In June 1589 both James and Cuthbert Burbage sought help from Cuthbert's employer, Sir Walter Cope, who accordingly wrote to Hyde suggesting that he, Cope, might be of service to Hyde with the Lord Treasurer, Lord Burghley, on some future occasion if Hyde would assign the ground lease of the Theatre to Cuthbert Burbage. With some reluctance Hyde complied, and on 7 June 1589 assigned his interest in the ground lease of the Theatre to Cuthbert Burbage. According to Wallace, James Burbage continued to manage the Theatre, and business went on much as before, \\"but the Theatre itself was Cuthbert's\\". Hyde said later that he would not have made the assignment had it not been for Cope's letter. Cuthbert Burbage was equally dissatisfied with the arrangement. He later deposed that he agreed only to save his father from debt, and was of the view that he could have used his influence with Cope to better personal advantage. He was forced to borrow money to pay Hyde, and although the amount is not known with certainty, a statement by Hyde himself indicates that it was almost the entire original debt of ¬£125 8s 11d plus interest. Through his ownership of the ground lease, Cuthbert Burbage was drawn further into the ongoing battles between his father and Margaret Brayne. On 4 November 1590 she obtained a court order sequestering the Theatre property until the hearing of the case; however on 13 November Cuthbert succeeded in having that order stayed, and obtained an order for performance of the 1578 arbitration. On 16 November Margaret Brayne, Robert Miles and his son Ralph, and a friend, Nicholas Bishop, took a copy of the order to the Theatre to enforce its terms by taking half the profits from the gallery that day. They arrived just as playgoers were flocking in for a performance. James Burbage, after initial argument through a window of the Theatre, came down into the yard and called Robert Miles a knave and a rascal, and the widow Brayne a \\"murdering whore\\". According to Berry, they believed that \\"Miles was Katherine Brayne's father and that he and Margaret Brayne had conspired to kill her husband\\". James Burbage's wife and her son Richard Burbage, then only about nineteen, came into the yard and beat Robert Miles with a broomstaff. Richard Burbage, after \\"scornfully and disdainfully playing with Nicholas Bishop's nose\\", threatened to beat him also. At that point Cuthbert Burbage arrived, and threatened the intruders with \\"great and horrible oaths\\". They were then violently thrust out of the yard. Some of the actors were attracted by the tumult, among them John Alleyn, brother of Edward Alleyn, who also put in a word for the widow Brayne, to no avail. The Admiral's Men, of which the Alleyn brothers were members, subsequently withdrew from the Theatre and went across the river to play at Henslowe's theatre. On 28 November Margaret Brayne had James Burbage arrested for being in contempt of the court order, and for the next two or three years there was a lengthy investigation into the contempt issue which was still ongoing when Margaret Brayne died of plague in late April 1593. In her will dated 8 April she made Robert Miles her sole executor and left him the care of her daughter Katherine (insisting, however, that Katherine was John Brayne's daughter),Katherine Brayne died of plague three months after her mother, and was buried 23 July 1593 at St Mary Matfelon. and all her property, including her half interest in the Theatre, and Miles thereby inherited the litigation in which he had already been active as her financial backer. Miles filed a bill of reviver near the end of the year and continued the suit in Chancery until 28 May 1595, when the court finally adjudged that he should attempt to collect on the bonds in the common law courts, which he appears not to have attempted. James Burbage died in February 1597, and two months later the ground lease on the Theatre expired, Giles Allen having refused to renew it. At this point Miles brought an action against Cuthbert Burbage in the Court of Requests, the outcome of which is not known as the relevant documents are no longer extant. In December 1598 Cuthbert and Richard Burbage had the Theatre pulled down, and took the timbers across the Thames to Southwark, where they were used in the building of the Globe.

Biography He was born in November 1832 in Birmingham, where his earlier years were spent. Due to the poorness of his family, without the help of one or two friends he would have been unable to study art, for which his talent was soon exhibited. After passing some years at the art academy in Birmingham, he became at the age of eighteen a student at the Royal Academy in London, where he had already exhibited a picture. There he worked assiduously, drawing from the antique and from life. Nearly ten years later an accidental circumstance revealed to a friend his capabilities in mountain landscape, and in 1860, immediately after his marriage, he went to Switzerland. Thence he proceeded to Egypt, where unhappily his wife died of dysentery near the second cataract. He remained in the east, spending some time in Syria and at Constantinople, till the spring of 1862, when he returned for a short time to London. But for the next five years he was much abroad, working either in the Alps or in Egypt. In 1867 he married his second wife, Fanny Phipson of Birmingham. His sketching tours then became rarer and shorter, though he visited Greece, Norway, and the Alps. At first he resided at Staines, then removed to the neighbourhood of Bromsgrove, living most of the time at the Forelands, near that town. In 1872 his wife died, and the loss permanently affected his health. He died on 25 August 1880 at his residence on Bromsgrove Lickey in Worcestershire, leaving three sons. Walton's life was bound up in his art. He worked both in oils and in watercolours, but was more successful with the latter. Most thorough and conscientious in the study both of form and of colour, he delighted especially in mountain scenery and in atmospheric effects, such as an Alpine peak breaking through the mists, or a sunset on the Nile. Few men have equalled him in the truthful rendering of rock structure and mountain form.

The coalition consists of more than fifty non-governmental organizations. In 1991, the Canadian Children's Rights Council adopted the same acronym as the coalition. The CCRC released a report in 1999 called \\"How Does Canada Measure Up?\\" which criticized the way children were treated in the country, specifically focusing on children with disabilities. In 2003, the Government of Canada consulted the CCRC on the country's adherence to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). The CCRC published a shortened version of the CRC and disseminated it among Canadian youth in order to promote this international human rights instrument. The CCRC hosted a forum called \\"Children: Silenced Citizens?\\" in 2007 to discuss the CRC. The CCRC submitted a plea on behalf of Omar Khadr in the 2009 legal case Prime Minister of Canada et al. v. Omar Ahmed Khadr. Also on 2009, the organization established a Child Rights Award. In 2010, the CCRC collaborated with YOUCAN and UNICEF Canada to produce a brochure to inform Canadian youth about the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict. In 2011, the CCRC submitted a report called \\"Right in Principle, Right in Practice\\" to the Committee on the Rights of the Child, making recommendations about how to improve Canadian public policy regarding children's rights. The report also stated that the Canadian government's implementation of the CRC over previous two decades has been sporadic at best. In 2018, the group advocated for a pollution tax on behalf of Canadian children and joined Gen Squeeze coalition that aimed to get intervenor status in two court cases that the provinces of Ontario and Saskatchewan have filed challenging the federal government's legal authority to impose a carbon tax.

History   1960s and 1970s  Brothers Roy and Gene Clair grew up in Lititz, Pennsylvania, where their parents owned a grocery store. Their father bought them a small public address system in 1955 which they started to rent out to bands, schools, and churches. It consisted of a horn loudspeaker, a Stromberg-Carlson integrated preamplifier, a 35-watt power amp, and a microphone. Money they earned went to buying more equipment. Through high school, college and after they continued to rent it out and add to it. Their first business was a loudspeaker reconing business, Clair Reconing, which fixed loudspeakers. This is where they first started learning about loudspeaker design and how important it is to efficiency. In the early 1960s Gene began working as a technician for Franklin & Marshall College in nearby Lancaster, Pennsylvania, which gave them opportunities to rent out their sound system. Their sound system consisted of two columns with six eight-inch speakers each, a Bogen amplifier and four Shure 55s microphones and rented for $95 a night. Their big break came in 1966. They provided sound to Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons at a local show at Franklin & Marshall College. Their road crew was impressed by the Clair Brothers sound system. Roy asked to be invited into their dressing room, where he talked about why the system sounded so good. The next day the band had a show in Allentown, Pennsylvania, which sounded terrible. They contacted the Clair brothers through a local DJ and asked them to come down with their system. Just before these two concerts they had done a show with Herb Alpert, who had not allowed them to use his superior sound system, and they were stuck with the poor house sound system. This made them realize the benefit of traveling with their own sound system. Once again impressed with the Clair brothers sound system, the tour manager asked them to join them on the road for the rest of the tour, bringing their sound system, for $90 per show. It is believed they were the first professional sound company to tour with a band. 1967 Clair Brothers used Altec Lansing A7-500 Voice of the Theater speakers on the Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons tour. Clair Brochure: Over 40 Years Of Audio Excellence 1968 The Clair Brothers main front of house system consisted of stacks of custom designed dual 15 inch bass horns loaded with Altec drivers. These were paired with passive crossovers and Altec 288-C high frequency drivers attached to Altec multi-cell horns. These were powered by the new Crown DC300 direct coupled amplifiers. The new dual 15 inch bass horn design was based on the Altec A7 horn design. They were built in-house. 1970 The Clair Brothers officially incorporate as Clair Bros. Audio Enterprises, Inc. and switches to JBL speaker components in their speaker designs. 1974 Clair S4 All-In-One full range speaker In 1974 Clair Brothers introduced their S4 all-in-one PA speaker. A radical departure from the different sized modular boxes generally used in large concert PA systems of the time. The S4 was a single box full range 4-way speaker weighing 425 lbs with integrated rigging hardware for suspending from the roof or superstructure of an auditorium or arena. CLAIR S4 Series II PA Cabinet The S4 measured 45 inches by 45 inches which allowed two cabinets to sit side by side in a semi-trailer truck. The S4 design was a system that included the S4 speakers, amplifier racks, flying hardware and cabling as an integrated package. The original S4 design was a 4-way system with two JBL K150 18 inch bass speakers, four JBL K110 10 inch midrange speakers, two JBL 2440 2 inch troat high frequency drivers coupled to JBL 2385 12 inch elliptical exponential horns (with out the slant-plate acoustic lenses) and two JBL 2405 ultra-high frequency \\"slot\\" drivers.Clair Brothers S4 The drivers were vertically alligned so they would acoustically couple with the cabinets above and below them. The driver selection evolved over time generally keeping with the all JBL design. The 4-way design used a 3-way active cross over with 200Hz and 1,200Hz crossover points initially powered by Phase Linear 700 amplifiers. A passive 7kHz high frequency crossover between the JBL 2440 and JBL 2405 drivers was installed in the cabinet. Clair Bros S-4 Speaker cabinets were connected to the amplifier racks using custom large gauge multi pair cables with Cannon multi-pin connectors. The S-4 was used in large two dimension arrays. Typically six to ten or more columns of six or nine speakers closely arrayed.US Festival Figure 3  1980s through present  In 1980, Clair Global established its first location outside the United States, with Clair Japan in Yokohama. At the end of the decade, Clair Global officially launched a spin-off to install permanent sound, video, and lighting systems in concert venues, churches, stadiums, theaters, cruise ships, and schools. This new business eventually grew large enough that in 2009 it moved out of the Lititz location to a new location in nearby Manheim. That business is now separate and known as Clair Companies. In 1990, Clair acquired MD Systems of Nashville and created a partnership with JANDS in Australia. Also that year, Clair opened a location in Cambridge, England. Four years later it moved the operation to Switzerland to combine with Audio Rent in Basel, operating there as AudioRent Clair. In 1995, Gene Clair sold his end of the business to his son Troy Clair, who is now president and CEO. In October 2000, Clair bought Showco, its direct competitor, and named the combined company ClairShowCo. With this move, the company became one the world's largest sound reinforcement equipment providers, and it continued to grow over the course of the decade, particularly with acquisitions of DB Sound of Chicago and ConcertSound of the UK in 2008. In 2008, renamed as Clair Global. Clair Global added a broadcast services division in August 2010, in part through the acquisition of Wireless First, Inc. and GTO Live, Inc. With that acquisition came Kevin Sanford, the founder of both companies. In December 2013, co-founder Gene Clair died of an illness at age 73.  Innovations  Clair designed and built the first stage monitor, in 1970, and the first hanging sound system for indoor arenas, in 1972. Both are now standard parts of live events. Clair, along with JANDS co- founder Bruce Jackson, developed and introduced its own 32-channel folding audio console with parametric EQ, in 1977, followed by CTS‚Ñ¢ processing and the Clair/TC remote controlled EQ system in 1980. In 2014, along with partner Tait Towers, Clair opened the 52,000 square-foot Rock Lititz, the largest dedicated rehearsal space in the world.

Biography Born in 1806, he first appeared as a contributor to the Royal Academy exhibition in 1835. He continued to exhibit at intervals till 1857, his contributions being chiefly portraits, though he was afterwards better known as a landscape painter. He was elected a member of the New Water Colour Society (now the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours) in 1838, when he was living at 26 Percy Street, Rathbone Place, but he resigned in 1856, aggrieved in consequence of some alleged slight in connection with the placing of his pictures. At his own request, however, he was reinstated in 1859. He was watercolour-painter in ordinary to William IV and Queen Adelaide, he painted a miniature of Queen Victoria from a sitting (1840 NPG) and taught Victoria's son Prince Arthur to paint; he was also professor of drawing at Addiscombe College from 1851 to its dissolution, after which he held a similar post at Woolwich Academy till his death. In 1864 a mysterious advertisement, offering a reward for any information about Penley, ‚Äòliving or dead,‚Äô appeared in several of the London newspapers. He died at Lewisham on 15 January 1870. Works His art was of the showy, artificial kind, which was encouraged by the early popularity of chromolithography, and may be said to have become quite obsolete before his death. An enthusiastic follower of his art, Penley published various elaborate treatises on its principles and practice, some of which are illustrated by chromolithography. Among them are his Elements of Perspective (1851), English School of Painting in Water Colours (1861), Sketching from Nature in Water Colours (1869), and A System of Water Colour Painting.

In the United States, it was first implemented by the United States federal government in 1981 with little publicity, and was subsequently outlawed by the Civil Rights Act of 1991. Prior to being banned by the federal government, race-norming was practiced by 38 U.S. states' employment services. The aim of this practice is to counteract alleged racial bias in aptitude tests administered to job applicants, as well as in neuropsychological tests. The argument was that it guarantees racial balance and this was confirmed by a National Research Council panel evaluating its validity when predicting job performance. The practice converted and compared the raw score of the test according to racial groups. The score of a black candidate is only compared to the scores of those who had the same ethnicity. If his score, which is reported within a percentile range, fell within a certain percentile when compared to white or all candidates, it would be much higher among other black candidates. University of Delaware professor Linda Gottfredson has been very critical of this practice, as have conservative columnist George Will and law professor Robert J. Delahunty. Criticism was based on the perception that race-norming was biased in favor of blacks. In the 1980s, the Reagan administration ordered a study into the unadjusted General Aptitude Test Battery (without race-norming); the results, released in 1989, showed that unadjusted test scores were not strongly related to job performance.

The \\"-bait\\" part of the term makes an analogy with fishing, where a hook is disguised by an enticement (bait), presenting the impression to the fish that it is a desirable thing to swallow. Long before the Internet, an unscrupulous marketing practice known as bait-and-switch used similar dishonest methods to hook customers. Like bait-and-switch, clickbait is a form of fraud. (Click fraud, however, is a separate form of online misrepresentation which uses a more extreme disconnect between what is being presented in the frontside of the link versus what is on the click-through side of the link, also encompassing malicious code.) The term clickbait does not encompass all cases where the user arrives at a destination that is not anticipated from the link that is clicked. When the manipulation is done for the purpose of humor, as with rickrolling, and there is no element of exploitation, then that deception does not qualify as clickbait. The term can also be misused when viewers complain about an enticing thumbnail or title, as with a sexually provocative image. But if the image or title accurately reflects the content delivered upon click-through, then this is an example of simple enticement. Without the element of deception, it does not qualify as clickbait. The borderline cases happen when a content creator inserts a very short segment in order to serve as justification for a provocative thumbnail, when the vast majority of the content has nothing to do with this short segment or thumbnail. Here, a strong case for clickbait can be made by any user, as the overriding characteristic is deception for the purpose of exploiting the user.  Definition  A defining characteristic of clickbait is misrepresentation in the enticement presented to the user to manipulate them to click onto a link. While there is no universally agreed-upon definition of clickbait, Merriam-Webster defines clickbait as \\"something designed to make readers want to click on a hyperlink, especially when the link leads to content of dubious value or interest.\\" Dictionary.com is states that clickbait is \\"a sensationalized headline or piece of text on the Internet designed to entice people to follow a link to an article on another web page.\\" BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith states that his publication doesn't do clickbait, using a strict definition of clickbait as a headline that is dishonest about the content of the article. Smith notes that Buzzfeed headlines such as \\"A 5-Year-Old Girl Raised Enough Money To Take Her Father Who Has Terminal Cancer To Disney World\\" deliver exactly what the headline promises. The fact that the headline is written to be eye-catching is irrelevant in Smith's view since the headline accurately describes the article. Facebook, while trying to reduce the amount of clickbait shown to users, defined the term as a headline that encourages users to click, but doesn't tell them what they will see. However, this definition excludes a lot of content that is generally regarded as clickbait. A more commonly used definition is a headline that intentionally over-promises and under-delivers. The articles associated with such headlines often are unoriginal, and either merely restate the headline, or copies content from a more genuine news source. The term clickbait is sometimes used for any article that is unflattering to a person. In such cases, the article is not actually clickbait by any legitimate definition of the term. Background From a historical perspective, the techniques employed by clickbait authors can be considered derivative of yellow journalism, which presented little or no legitimate well-researched news and instead used eye- catching headlines that included exaggerations of news events, scandal- mongering, or sensationalism. One cause of such sensational stories is the controversial practice called checkbook journalism, where news reporters pay sources for their information without verifying its truth. In the U.S. it is generally considered an unethical practice, as it often turns celebrities and politicians into lucrative targets of unproven allegations.Kurtz, Howard. \\"Fees for Sleaze\\", Washington Post, Jan. 27, 1994 According to Washington Post writer Howard Kurtz, \\"this thriving tabloid culture has erased the old definitions of news by including tawdry and sensational stories about celebrities for the sake of profit.\\"  Use  Clickbait is primarily used to drive page views on websites, whether for their own purposes or to increase online advertising revenue. It can also be used for phishing attacks for the purpose of spreading malicious files or stealing user information. The attack occurs once the user opens the link provided to learn more. Clickbait has also been used for political ends and has been blamed for the rise of post-truth politics. Katherine Viner, editor-in-chief at The Guardian wrote that \\"chasing down cheap clicks at the expense of accuracy and veracity\\" undermined the value of journalism and truth. Emotional subjects with stark headlines are widely shared and clicked, which resulted in what Slate described as an \\"aggregation of outrage\\" and a proliferation of websites across the political spectrum ‚Äì including Breitbart News, Huffington Post, Salon, Townhall and the Gawker Media blogs ‚Äì which profited by producing shareable short-form pieces offering simple moral judgements on political and cultural issues. There are various clickbait strategies, including the composition of headlines of news and online articles that build suspense and sensation, luring and teasing users to click. Some of the popular approaches in achieving these include the presentation of link and images that are interesting to the user, exploiting curiosity related to greed or prurient interest. It is not uncommon, for instance, for these contents to include lewd image or a \\"make money quick\\" scheme. Backlash Artistic representation of 'clickbait', Bondi Junction, New South Wales. By 2014, the ubiquity of clickbait on the web had begun to lead to a backlash against its use. Satirical newspaper The Onion launched a new website, ClickHole, that parodied clickbait websites such as Upworthy and BuzzFeed, and in August 2014, Facebook announced that it was taking technical measures to reduce the impact of clickbait on its social network, using, among other cues, the time spent by the user on visiting the linked page as a way of distinguishing clickbait from other types of content. Ad blockers and a general fall in advertising clicks also affected the clickbait model, as websites moved toward sponsored advertising and native advertising where the content of the article was more important than the click-rate. As problem attracted interest, tools have been developed to address the clickbait problem. Clickbait detection, for instance, has been integrated in browser applications while digital platforms where contents are shared such as Twitter have updated their respective algorithms to filter clickbait contents. Social media groups, such as Stop Clickbait, combat clickbait by giving a short summary of the clickbait article, closing the \\"curiosity gap\\". Clickbait reporting browser plug-ins have been also developed by the research community in order to report clickbait links for further advances in the field based on supervised learning algorithms. Security software providers offer advice on how to avoid harmful clickbait.

She was born on April 20, 1864 in Yellow Springs, Ohio to Anna Maria Wright and General David Sloan Stanley, US Army. She died in 1907. Her works are found in numerous institutional collections including The Smithsonian American Art Museum. An exhibition that included her work, Dutch Utopia: American Artists in Holland, 1880‚Äì1914 was featured at the Telfair Museum of Art, the Taft Museum of Art, Grand Rapids Art Museum, and the Singer Museum.  Biography   Early life  Anna Stanley was born in a small village in Greene County, Ohio. She arrived during the fourth year of the American Civil War; that same year Abraham Lincoln was completing his first term as president, General William Tecumseh Sherman launched his campaign, March to the Sea, and Anna's father, U.S. Army Brigadier-general David Sloan Stanley was wounded at the Battle of Franklin. Anna was cared for by her mother, Anna Maria, among six other siblings. Her father's military career moved the Stanley family several times in the years following the Civil War, taking them to South Dakota, Michigan, New York, Texas and Washington, DC. In spite of this transient life, the commitment of David and Anna Maria Stanley to foster an environment that valued God, education, distinctive accomplishment and culture, the family remained intimate and resilient. It was this environment that nurtured Anna's ability to interpret the world around her through her art. Anna Stanley spent her high school years in New York where she attended the Buffalo Female Academy and was lauded for her skills in drawing and painting. Anna received instruction under Ammi Merchant Farnham (American, 1845-1922), who studied at the Royal Academy of Bavaria and the Munich Academy under Frank Duveneck. An accomplished artist and curator of the Buffalo Academy of Fine Arts (renamed in 1962, the Albright-Knox Art Gallery), Farnham's oeuvre includes atmospheric landscapes, often painted in late afternoon, depicting luminous twilight scenes, which lend much influence to many of Anna's later paintings. Her achievements were recognized when one of her pen and ink drawings was selected for the cover illustration on The Magnet, which was published by the ladies of the Academy. In the fall of 1882 Anna moved to Philadelphia to continue her education at The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and improve her mastery of the human figure. She attended anatomy lectures and studied life drawing and sculpture under Thomas Eakins (American, 1844-1916) and Thomas Anshutz (American, 1851-1912) until the spring 1885. During this time, she also met Chicago artist Pauline Dohn Rudolph (\\"Lena\\"), a former students of the School of Art Institute of Chicago, who would later accompany Anna to Europe.  European years  Pauline \\"Lena\\" Dohn, Anna's lifelong friend and travel companion during her time in Europe A privileged young woman, in 1887 Anna accompanied by her mother and friend, Lena, traveled to Venice and then on to Paris, where she enrolled in the Acad√©mie Julian. Renting a space on the top floor of the Hotel Oxford and Cambridge, Anna's accommodation was connected to an adjoining room occupied by Lena. They were situated in the 1st arrondissement of Paris in close proximity to the Tuileries Garden and the Mus√©e du Louvre. Surviving family correspondence, including illustrations, describes the experiences they had while they were there. These letters include descriptions of artists‚Äô materials, subject matter in included in works of art, and comments about critiques received from their instructors. Page from a letter postmarked July 2, 1888, to Anna's parents, includes a sketch for later oil painting \\"Dutch Milk Maid\\" Under the training of Gustave Clarence Rodolphe Boulanger and Jules-Joseph Lefebvre, Anna produced figurative charcoal drawings rather than paintings; both were revered artists. Lefebvre was known for his meticulously executed portraits and nudes, and during his long career, he earned three Salon medals, was appointed to the French Academy of Fine Arts, attained the rank of Commander in the Legion of Honor, and won the coveted Prix de Rome in 1861. Gustave Boulanger, also a figure painter, was best known for his classical and Orientalist subjects. Some of his other students included Childe Hassam, George Hitchcock, Frederick William MacMonnies, Gari Melchers, Willard Leroy Metcalf, Elizabeth Nourse, Robert Reid, and Edmund Charles Tarbell - Anna's work was in good company. Likely her awareness of the reputations of her mentors resulted in welcomed reception of their instruction. In one letter, she wrote that she received \\"stern criticisms\\" and yet recounted that they were ‚Äúfair and instructive.‚Äù Several other artist and friends from the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts also studied at the Acad√©mie Julian. One such student was Ida C. Haskell, whose mother came to Paris to look after the young women. While there, Mrs. Hanna Haskell wrote to John H. Vanderpoel, an art teacher at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, to inquire about where she and the students might summer in 1888. (It was not uncommon for artist students to paint en plein aire during summers, to take advantage of the out-of-doors after a cold damp Paris winter.) Vanderpoel responded by suggesting they consider spending their summer in Rijsoord in the Netherlands, where his parents lived before they immigrated to America. He advised that the cost of living in Rijsoord would be affordable, the scenery excellent, and his cousins‚Äîa family named Noorlander, would be good companions. Having previously taught at the Acad√©mie Julian, Vanderpoel also decided to accompany the students to Rijsoord where he could paint and teach. Julian friends, Page Scott and Alice Kellogg from Chicago, and Page's sister Gertrude, joined the expedition. Anna's experience in Holland would forever influence her work as an artist. Rijsoord was so isolated from the outside world that strangers were cause for great attention. In a letter to her parents, Anna wrote of a large crowd of more than 100 local children that followed Anna and Mrs. Haskell, almost causing a riot because they had never seen artists before. Her affection for these citizens ensued in picturesque portrayals of Dutch farmers and laborers, predominantly women and children, and gorgeous views of river scenes, dikes, and wide-open landscapes. In the fall of 1888, Anna returned to Paris along with her friends. Rather than returning to the Acad√©mie Julian, they registered at the Acad√©mie Colarossi where the fees were more reasonable, and the classes were less structured and more progressive. There they received instruction from artists Jean-Andr√© Rixens (1846-1925) and Gustave-Claude- Etienne Courtois (1852-1923). Anna moved to an apartment house with Page Scott, Ida C. Haskell, her mother Hannah, Alice Kellogg, Amy Atkinson from York, England, the Jordain sisters [first names unknown] and Adele. Anna, along with her friends, also rented artists‚Äô studios. Anna shared hers with another Colarossi student, Beulah Strong. In a letter from Alice Kellogg, she wrote, ‚ÄúNan has it one half day, Beulah the other [half] so practically they have the studio alone.‚Äù(It was also noted by Alice that during this fall and winter period evening painting classes were taken with nude subjects.) The Noorlander family established a pension fund for the artists and travelers. ‚ÄúAccording to the plaque on the facade [of their house], the first corner stone was laid by a certain A. H. Stanley, presumably one of the American artists.‚Äù In May 1889, Anna's painting, Au commencement et √† al fin, was selected for exhibit at the Paris Salon, and in June she, along with many of the student artists, returned to Rijsoord. (Both summers [1888 and 1889] in Risjoord lasted from May or June to November, and Anna produced substantial works as reflected in later American exhibitions.  Later American years and travel to Asia  In November 1889, Anna sailed from Rotterdam for New York, accompanied by Page Scott. A month later, she was in San Antonio, TX and, by 1890, she had executed a formal portrait of her father in uniform.[10] Nearly twenty-six years old, her career was well established; in April she exhibited two paintings at the National Academy of Design in New York. Now recognized as a professional artist, her works were exhibited in numerous nationally prominent exhibits over the next few years, which were accompanied by price increases. By June 1891 Anna had three paintings included in the First Annual Exhibition of American Art at the Detroit Museum of Fine Arts in Michigan (along with her former teacher John H. Vanderpoel). Her work was exhibited annually in the Northern and Eastern parts of the U.S., with exception of 1893, when the only thing known of her activities comes from a photograph taken in the summer at an artist colony of Napanoch, New York. [She can be seen carrying the incomplete painting of Girl Reading.] It was this same year that she painted her brother David's full-length portrait, Cadet, while he was on a short vacation from West Point. Anna continued to produce works over the next several years and exhibited at the National Academy of Design, The Boston Art Club, and with the Society of Washington Artists. Her work was also included in an important exhibition in Washington, D.C., for the Grand Army of the Republic, a veterans‚Äô group that formed after the Civil War. In 1895, Anna's mother died in April and her brother, David, graduated from West Point Military Academy in June. It was here that she met Lieutenant Willard Ames Holbrook, the former Aide-de-Camp to General Stanley at Fort Sam Houston (1891 to 1892), and they began corresponding. Within days of her brother's graduation, Anna and Ida C. Haskell, boarded a ship in New York and sailed for Rotterdam. Anna remained in Rijsoord for five months, and there she produced The Sand Sifter, Harvest [10], The Windmill and Girl Carrying Sheaves. This would be her last trip to the Netherlands. When Anna returned to New York that November, Willard, (as noted in his memoir) missed meeting her ship. In April 1896, Anna's work was exhibited three times, and Veerhoff Galleries in Washington, D.C., presented five of her paintings in a solo show. In October 1896 Anna and Willard Holbrook were married in Washington with a large reception at Quarters Number 1, General Stanley's residence at the Old Soldiers‚Äô Home. In December, Anna moved with Willard to his post at Fort Grant, Arizona. In 1897, Anna exhibited The Spinning Wheel at the Society of Washington Artists, Cosmos Club, Washington, D.C.; this is the last known exhibition of Anna's work during her lifetime, although she continued to paint. May 1899, Willard Ames Holbrook, Jr. was born and two weeks later, Willard Sr. was sent to Georgia and then assigned to the war in Cuba. April 1900, David Stanley Holbrook (known as Stanley) was born at Angel Island, San Francisco. That same year Willard was sent to the Philippines and they were separated for over a year. During these two separations Anna lived in Washington with her father and sisters. During this time, her painting slowed but did not cease entirely and Spring House was painted during this period at Blackwell Farm in Warrenton, Virginia. In 1901, Willard became a civil governor of Panay, an island in the Philippines, and Anna and the boys joined him. This position provided for a fully staffed house, and with the help of an American nanny, Anna was able to return to her painting. During this time, she completed many paintings, which are now included in family collections; other works are only known from black and white photographs from the governor's house. During their stay in the Philippines, Willard took Anna to Korea and Japan and she created the watercolors Pagoda and Buddha Nikko, Japan. The family returned to America and lived at Fort Huachuca in Arizona, and then at Fort Prescott from 1903 to 1905, when Willard received orders to teach at the Pennsylvania Military College, Chester, Pennsylvania. Anna died of pneumonia, Monday, February 25, 1907, at home in Chester and was buried at the United States Soldiers' and Airmen's Home National Cemetery in Washington, D.C. She was 42 years of age and left behind her husband and two young sons.

History  In 1993, Keith Frome Ed.D, J.B. Schramm and Derek Canty started a teen education center in the basement of a community center in low-income in Washington, D.C., working with students who had the intelligence, resiliency, and grit to succeed in college and careers, but did not know how to pursue postsecondary education. Through this program, they saw firsthand how the influence of one student could push friends on the path to a higher education.

In 2015, College Summit launched PeerForward, an initiative built on decades of experience as well as third-party research about what really works in schools.

Polish forces under Major Walery Remiszewski clashed with troops of the Imperial Russian Army. The battle resulted in Russian victory. In January 1863, a number of teenagers from Warsaw fled to the Kampinos Forest, in order to escape draft to the Russian Army. On January 17, Zygmunt Padlewski from Warsaw came to Kampinos, and in the following days, he organized a 1000-strong unit of teenagers, young men and local peasants, some of whom were armed only with sticks. On January 19, most rebels left the forest, heading towards Plock. Still, a number stayed in Kampinos, also more men came to the forest from Warsaw. They were commanded by Aleksander Rogalinski. In the night of April 11/12, two prisoners of Warsaw Citadel decided to escape, hoping that their guards would be drunk, celebrating Orthodox Easter. Before their escape, Jaroslaw Dabrowski and Bronislaw Szwarce had asked for armed support from the Kampinos Forest, so on April 12, 1863, in the woods near the village of Zaborow, some 250 men were concentrated under the command of Major Walery Remiszewski. The insurgents marched towards the Citadel, but the Russians were aware of their presence. On April 13, Russian troops blocked roads towards Warsaw, and on the next day, the Russians attacked the insurgents. Enjoying numerical superiority and being better armed, the 670-strong Russian unit destroyed the Polish party, killing 30 men (including Remiszewski). Furthermore, the Cossacks murdered injured insurgents, and the total number of Polish losses was at least 72 killed and 9 injured.

Considered by his colleagues to have been worthy of winning the Nobel Prize in Physiology for discovering the reticular activating system along with Horace Winchell (Tid) Magoun and Giuseppe Moruzzi, Lindsley was instrumental in demonstrating the use of electroencephalography (EEG) in the study of brain function.Chalupa, L.M. (2005). Obituaries: Donald B. Lindsley. American Psychologist, (60)2, 193-194 Early life and education In December 23, 1907 Lindsley was born in Brownhelm, Ohio, a small farming community near Cleveland. He was the youngest of four sons, one of which did not live past infancy. His father, Benjamin worked for the Cleveland Stone Company as a parts manager. Through his high school years Lindsley excelled as an athlete, winning medals and titles in track, baseball, and basketball.Johnson, R., Wilson, C.L., & Edgerton, V.R.

He played the trumpet which served to pay his passage on a cruise ship to Europe. He did not have aspirations of going to college since no one in his family had done so before nor could his family afford it.bri.ucla.edu. Retrieved October 20, 2013, from However through the encouragement of one of his teachers, he pursued a higher education deciding he would work his way through college. His commitment to the field of psychology began at Wittenberg College in 1925.Weinberger, N.M. (2009). A Biographical Memoir: Donald Benjamin Lindsley 1907-2003. \\"National Academy of Sciences Washington, D.C.\\" Lindsley attended Wittenberg College (now University) in 1925-1929 and received his PhD in psychology from the University of Iowa under a scholarship. It was at the University of Iowa that he met his wife, Ellen Ford. She was a theater arts major and the daughter of Arthur Ford - a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Iowa. They later married in 1933 and were married for sixty-two years. It was at the University of Iowa that Lindsley mastered the use of lab equipment and physiology, publishing six papers on human and rat muscle activity.Chalupa, L.M., & Anchel, H. Visual input to the pulvinar via lateral geniculate, superior colliculus and visual cortex in the cat. Exp. Neurol. 36:449-262. Activation theory and Ascending reticular system In 1945, Lindsley undertook basic neurophysiological research with Horace Winchell Mangoun at the Northwestern Medical School in downtown Chicago. The 19th century prevailing theory of sleep and waking stated that brain organization and behavior was based on a sensory-motor schema. The waking state was thought to be supported by sensory input while sleep was conceived as the product of sensory withdrawal. This theory was reasonable and unchallenged at the time as there was no knowledge of another major type of system in the brain beyond sensory and motor systems.Johnson, R., Wilson, C.L., & Edgerton, V.R. Senate.universityofcalifornia.edu. Retrieved October 31, 2013, from http://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/inmemoriam/DonaldB.Lindsley.htm In 1949, Mangoun and visiting scientist, Giuseppe Moruzzi from the University of Pisa, challenged this theory when they accidentally discovered a new type of brain system while experimenting with spinal reflexes on an anesthetized cat. This brain system's existence had not yet been suspected. This research was argued by proponents until Lindsley led a team to perform the experiments that established the validity to this new system, the ascending reticular activating system and came up with Activation theory. It postulated that there is an arousal continuum on which significantly lower emotion at one extreme and intense emotion at the other can be located through EEG from the reticular substance and thus concluded an organism is in a continuous state of emotional flux related to the state and environment they habituate.Weinberger, N.M.

The organization was formed in January 2016 when the former not-for-profit organization Ovarian Cancer Research Fund, which focused primarily on ovarian cancer research, combined with Ovarian Cancer National Alliance, which focused primarily on ovarian cancer advocacy and support programs, to form one organization.  History  The former Ovarian Cancer Research Fund (OCRF) was founded in December, 1994, as the Ann Schreiber Ovarian Cancer Research Fund by Sol Schreiber in memory of his wife, Ann, who died of ovarian cancer. The organization later became the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund. In 1997, Liz Tilberis, editor-in-chief of Harpers Bazaar and also battling ovarian cancer, became the organization‚Äôs first president. Liz, with help from Donna Karan, started the organization's signature fundraiser, Super Saturday, hosting the first one in 1998 in the Hamptons in New York. Prior to becoming Ovarian Cancer Research Fund Alliance, Ovarian Cancer Research Fund was the oldest and largest charity in the United States funding ovarian cancer research. The former Ovarian Cancer National Alliance (OCNA) was founded in 1997 by the leaders of several ovarian cancer organizations. Prior to becoming the eventual merge of the two organizations, OCNA was a leading ovarian cancer organization in the United States focusing on federal advocacy, awareness and patient support programs.  Research  As of December 2018, since inception of the original organization, OCRA has awarded 297 research grants to scientists at 73 medical institutions, totaling over $80 million. The majority of ovarian cancer research funding in the United States comes from two government sources‚Äîthe National Cancer Institute and United States Department of Defense. OCRA is the largest non-governmental funding source of ovarian cancer research. OCRA research grants are approved by a committee of gynecologic oncologists and scientists treating or studying ovarian cancer.  Grant-Making Programs  Through grant-making programs, OCRA funds scientific research at cancer centers and academic research centers in the U.S. The first grants were awarded in 1998. OCRFA offers three research grants: * Collaborative Research Development Grant: OCRFA‚Äôs largest grant ($900,000 over three years) is for senior investigators with established research careers, and provides funding for large ovarian cancer research projects that involve several investigators within one institution or collaborations between groups in multiple institutions. ($300,000 per year for three years) * Liz Tilberis Early Career Award: This award is for junior faculty, and supports a time commitment to research and academic endeavors in ovarian cancer. ($150,000 per year for three years). * Ann and Sol Schreiber Mentored Investigator Award: This award was created in 2003, and funds clinical fellows or post-doctoral fellows working under the supervision of a mentor who is considered a leader in the field of ovarian cancer research. ($75,000 over one or two years) OCRA selects research projects through a peer- review process, conducted once each year by a panel of advisors called the Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC), which is chaired by Jeff Boyd, Ph.D., of Florida International University and Miami Cancer Institute. Less than 10% of applicants are awarded grants. Institutions that have received the most grants include University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Duke University, and Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital. OCRA presents an educational webinar series featuring speakers on topics in ovarian cancer research and addresses clinical trial enrollment with an ovarian cancer clinical trial finder on its website.  Advocacy  OCRA works with federal policy makers, including the President, Congress, and federal agencies like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). OCRA commits its resources to be a voice for ovarian cancer survivors and to significantly reduce the number of deaths from this deadly disease by advocating at the federal level for: * Adequate and sustained funding for ovarian cancer research and awareness programs. * Legislation that improves quality of life and access to care for cancer patients.  Advocacy Day[edit]  Advocacy Day takes place on Capitol Hill. Ovarian cancer survivors meet one-on-one with elected officials to share their personal stories as well as ask for support on a number of federal efforts aimed at sustaining or increasing funding for federal ovarian cancer research, awareness and support.  Support  OCRA's support programs focus on helping women and their families before, during and beyond diagnosis.  Survivors Teaching Students: Saving Women‚Äôs Lives¬Æ[edit]  Survivors Teaching Students: Saving Women‚Äôs Lives¬Æ aims to educate future healthcare professionals ‚Äî physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses and physician assistants ‚Äî to increase their understanding of ovarian cancer symptoms and risk factors so that they will be able to diagnose the disease when it is in its earlier, most treatable stages.  Ovarian Cancer National Conference[edit]  The OCRFA Ovarian Cancer National Conference provides expert sessions on topics such as clinical trials, early detection, and treatment through various forums and lectures from renowned clinicians and researchers. Survivors and their families also can attend workshops and events on issues about living with ovarian cancer.  Woman to Woman Program[edit]  In 2011 the former OCRF began a national expansion of Woman to Woman, a local program originating at Mount Sinai Hospital. This program pairs volunteer gynecologic cancer survivors with women recently diagnosed and actively going through treatment, and offers information and support for caregivers. Woman to Woman program sites are selected through an application process. OCRFA gives each selected institution a one-year, $50,000 grant to cover the cost of a part-time program coordinator, with remaining funds allotted to a patient fund. Newly established Woman to Woman programs are expected to become self-funding after the first year.  Community Partner Program[edit]  OCRFA works with not-for-profit organizations across the United States to share information and put forth a unified national voice for the ovarian cancer movement. This program was established by the former Ovarian Cancer National Alliance and was formerly called the Partner Member Program.  Events  The first OCRF ovarian cancer awareness broadcast and print public service announcements were created in partnership with L'Or√©al and featured Andie MacDowell.iSpot.tv, Ovarian Cancer Research Fund TV Spot Featuring Andie MacDowell Since then, OCRA has been included in print\\"The Big O,\\" Prevention, September 2011, Catherine Winters, p.96-105 and online publications, including books, national and international magazines and local newspapers, as a resource for ovarian cancer information.

The earliest established, called Super Saturday, is an annual fundraiser held in Water Mill, New York. Super Saturday was founded in 1998 by fashion designer Donna Karan, and late OCRF President and Editor-In-Chief of Harper's Bazaar, Liz Tilberis. It is dubbed the \\"Rolls-Royce of garage sales\\"\\"On The Meadow: Rolls-Royce of Garage Sales,\\" The New York Times, Style, August 4, 2002 by The New York Times, and has been hosted by Kelly Ripa and sponsored by Donna Karan, QVC and InStyle.

The bill passed in the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background During the 112th United States Congress, similar legislation passed in the House by voice vote, but did not become law. Provisions of the bill The Aviation Security Stakeholder Participation Act of 2013 would direct the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security (Transportation Security Administration [TSA]) to establish in the TSA an Aviation Security Advisory Committee. The Committee would include air cargo, general aviation, airport perimeter security, and risk-based subcommittees. The TSA must consult with the Committee on ‚Äúaviation security matters, including on the development and implementation of policies, programs, rulemaking, and security directives pertaining to aviation security, while adhering to sensitive security guidelines.‚Äù Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Homeland Security on October 29, 2013. This is a public domain source. H.R. 1204 would establish, within the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), an advisory committee to make recommendations on issues related to aviation security. The bill would specify details related to the organizational structure and reporting requirements of the proposed advisory committee. Under current law, TSA already operates an advisory committee related to aviation security. According to the TSA, the agency currently spends less than $100,000 annually to operate the existing committee, which has a mission and organizational structure that is similar to that of the committee envisioned under H.R. 1204. As a result, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 1204 would have no significant additional cost. H.R. 1204 would not affect direct spending or receipts; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 1204 contains no intergovernmental or private- sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The Aviation Security Stakeholder Participation Act of 2013 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on March 14, 2013 by Rep. Bennie G. Thompson (D, MS-2). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Homeland Security and the United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Transportation Security. It was reported (amended) alongside House Report 113-278. On November 27, 2013, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced the H.R. 1095 would be considered on the House floor on December 3, 2013. The House voted on December 3, 2013 in Roll Call Vote 617 to pass the bill 411-3. Debate and discussion The Aeronautical Repair Station Association (ARSA) successfully lobbied Rep. Richard Hudson (chairman of the Transportation Security Subcommittee) to have the bill amended at the committee level to add \\"aeronautical repair stations\\" to the list of requirement members on the Aviation Security Advisory Committee. According to the organization, the aviation maintenance industry is frequently overlooked \\"despite employing 306,000 workers and having a $47 billion per year impact on the U.S. economy.\\" The ARSA's interest in this bill is due to an ongoing TSA rulemaking on repair station security. Adam Dick, writing for the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity, criticized the bill as a bill that \\"appears to advance the kind of bureaucracy-building exercise you typically see in growing government agencies.\\" He criticizes the proposed Committee for being charged only to develop improvements in aviation security at the TSA's direction and with members entirely appointed by the TSA, rather than there being an independent Committee pursuing issues such as \\"respect for individual rights\\" or \\"reducing the activities of the TSA.\\" The House Republican Conference argue that codifying the Aviation Security Advisory Committee into law would \\"ensure that stakeholders continue to have a voice in TSA policy decisions, without the TSA allowing the Committee‚Äôs charter to expire,\\" something that has happened previously.

Originally discovered in Brazil in 1912, the disease has followed cultivation of cassava across the world.http://www.apsnet.org/publications/PlantDisease/BackIssues/Documents/1986Articles/PlantDisease70n12_1089.PDF Among diseases which afflict cassava worldwide, bacterial blight causes the largest losses in terms of yield.  Hosts and symptoms  Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis is capable of infecting most members of the plant genus Manihot. Consisting of about 100 species, the most economically significant species is easily the widely cultivated woody shrub, Manihot esculenta, known colloquially as the cassava plant.http://www.ars- grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/genus.pl?7234 In cassava, symptoms vary in a manner that is unique to this pathogen. Symptoms include blight, wilting, dieback, and vascular necrosis. A more diagnostic symptom visible in cassava with X. axonopodis infection are angular necrotic spotting of the leaves‚Äîoften with a chlorotic ring encircling the spots. These spots begin as distinguishable moist, brown lesions normally restricted to the bottom of the plant until they enlarge and coalesce‚Äîoften killing the entire leaf. A further diagnostic symptom often embodies itself as pools of gum exudate along wounds and leaf cross veins. It begins as a sappy golden liquid and hardens to form an amber colored deposit.  Disease cycle  Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis is a vascular and foliar pathogenic species of bacteria. It normally enters its host plants through stomatal openings or hydathodes. Wounds to stems have also been noted as a means of entry. Once inside its host, X. axonopodis enzymatically dissolves barriers to the plant's vascular system and so begins a systemic infection. Because of its enzymes inability to break down highly lignified cell walls, this pathogen prefers to feed on younger tissues and often follows xylem vessels into developing buds and seeds. Seeds which have been invaded by a high number of bacteria are sometimes deformed and necrotic, but assays have shown a high percentage of infected seeds are asymptomatic carriers. In moist conditions, Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis has been shown to survive asymptomatically for up to thirty months without new host tissue, but is a poor survivor in soil. It persists from one growing season to the next in infected seeds and infected clippings planted as clones in fields. Once one cassava plant is infected, the whole crop is put at risk to infection by rainsplash, contaminated cultivation tools, and foot traffic.http://www.adap.hawaii.edu/adap/Publications/ADAP_pubs/2000-1.pdf These are effective methods of transmission because they cause wounds to healthy cassava plants, and X. axonopodis uses these wounds as an entry point.  Environment  Hailing from Brazil, Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis excels in a humid subtropical to tropical climate. Plantations of Manihot esculenta often take place in soils characterized for being arid, lacking in nutrients, and prone to erosion especially when the cultivation occurs in sloped fields. This crop is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia and Latin America, and X. axonopodis has followed it. It has been confirmed up and down Latin America into North America, Sub- Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia/India, and even Polynesia. These regions are prone to high precipitation rates, a climate variable that propagates Xam epidemics. Constant rain events and windsplashes are the main form transmission of the secondary inoculum of the disease. Nevertheless, the high humidity and high air temperatures (77‚Äì90 ¬∞F) of tropical and subtropical regions make Cbb a conducive epidemic. The favorable conditions described allow colonial growth and eventual swarm behavior to enter hydathodes, stomata, or wounds.  Pathogenesis  Similar to other phytobacteria, Xam requires the assembly of a type 3 secretion system (T3SS) to initiate infection. After cell recognition by the T3SS, Xam releases type III effector proteins to modulate the cell's innate immunity. These effectors are denominated as transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors. While varying among strains, TAL effectors maintain several domains conserved. These include an N-terminal type III secretion signal, a central domain, a transcription acidic activation domain (AAD), and a C-terminal nuclear localization signal (NLS). N-terminal type III secretion signal allows the entry of the effector through the T3SS into the cell, and the NLS mobilizes the effector into the cell nucleus. The latter acts by emitting signals and recruiting host proteins for translocation. After gaining nuclear entry, sequence-specific protein-DNA interactions are carried by the central region, which recognizes a specific DNA sequence to which it attaches. The specificity is acquired by a two- residues combination (12 and 13 mer) in every tandem repeat that composes the central region; a change in a residue will result in a change of specificity towards a promoter. Finally, AAD is known as the cause of final transcription modulation, essential for virulence or avirulence. It has been recorded that Xam works with the activation of SWEET sugar transporters, promoting the efflux of glucose and sucrose to the apoplasm for bacterial benefit.  Management  Cultural approaches Several disease management techniques have been developed to control Cbb incidence and dissemination. Cultural practices have been used to decrease the incidence of the pathogen or delay the effect of the disease in the field. Pruning or total extirpation of infected plant tissue, weed removal, use of certified seeds, bacterial analysis of stem cuttings and crop rotation are used the most to limit the disease presence in the field. Transplantation of clones is the most common mode of propagation of this crop so the most important control of bacterial wilt of cassava is planting uninfected clones. In areas where bacterial wilt has not yet been established, it is important to raise a new crop from a meristem culture certifiably free of disease. In areas where the disease is already prevalent, great care should be taken to ensure clippings are taken from healthy plants and even then from the highly lignified portion at the base of cassava plants which appear healthy. Seeds are known to be able harbor the pathogen, but successful sanitation measures have been described. Infected seed immersed in water at 60 ¬∞C showed no sign of bacterial survival while the seed showed no reduction in germination potential. Furthermore, the sanitation of tools and big machinery are crucial to avoid the infection of healthy plants through mechanical inoculation. Intercropping and crop rotation have both been implemented in cassava cultivation and have been successful.http://d-nb.info/969263562/34 In the instance of crop rotation following an infected cassava crop, deep soil turnover is recommended and a period of six months should be observed before cassava is planted again; X. axonopodis is a poor soil survivor and does not sporulate so this time frame should clear crop fields of inoculum. It is also important to clear the field of weeds as X. axonopodis is known to survive much longer epiphytically on weeds than it does in soil. Biological control Colombian clones of cassava normally susceptible to bacterial blight showed a yield increase by a factor of 2.7 when applications of Pseudomonas fluorescens and P. putida were applied four times a month during the growing season. This approach shows promise but requires further investigation. Host resistance The last commonly used method is the mixed cultures using resistant cultivars, keeping in mind that yield can be affected with certain cultivars. There is considerable variance in cassava resistance to bacterial wilt, and this is a promising means of control. The resistance which has been identified in South American strains of cassava works by preventing colonization of the xylem. The genes which control this resistance are currently being mapped and implementation efficiency should see uptick in coming years.  Importance  Cassava is a staple of the human diets in developing countries in the tropics. 2007 global production was 228 million tons, with 52% coming from Africa. It is estimated that cassava accounts for 37% of total calories consumed by humans in Africa.http://www.iita.org/cassava It has been further estimated that it provides the sixth most calories of any crop worldwide. These numbers would probably be even more impressive if bacterial blight were eradicated. Estimates for how much cassava crop Xanathomas axonopodis pv. manihotis destroys every year vary widely but studies have shown that one infected transplant can end in 30% loss of yield in one growing cycle, and up to 80% by the third cycle if no control measures are taken. There have been a number of historical outbreaks of bacterial blight. Zaire lost 75% of its tuber yield and almost all of its protein-rich leaf yield every year of the early 1970s, while parts of Brazil lost 50% of tuber yield in 1974.

The approach of these narratives is generally mystical. Initially, they were recited at Sufi circles in Kufa and Baghdad. The first person to have reported this collection is Abu Abd al-Rahman Sulami as part of his Hadaiq al-Tafsir. While Sulami provides parts of the hadiths, Khargushi provides some other in his Arais al-Bayan fi Haqaiq al-Quran Ruzbihan Baqli. The Nafidh Pasha collection in Sulaymaniyya library contains another Quranic exegesis attributed to Ja'far al-Sadiq. The hadiths in this work are gathered by Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Harb. His transmission chain going back to Ja'far al-Sadiq includes Abu Tahir ibn Mumin, Abu Muhammad Hassan ibn Muhammad ibn Hamza, Muhammad ibn Hamza, Abu Muhammad Hassan ibn Abd Allah, Ali ibn Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Musa al-Riza, Imam Musa ibn Jafar. This is while that of Sulami is Abu Bakr Ahmad ibn Nasr Baghdadi, Abd Allah Ahmad ibn Amir, and Ali al-Ridha. Historical authenticity In al-Dharia, there is reference to a treatise titled Tafsir Imam Jafar ibn Muhammad al-Sadiq, a manuscript of which is available with Ali pasha Library in Istanbul. Aqa Bozorg Tehrani asserts that Shia biographers and scholars of transmission authorities (rijal) do not refer to this treatises. He further surmises though that some companions of Ja'far al-Sadiq may have in fact narrated such hadiths from him. The exegesis indicated by Aqa Buzurg seems to be the same as the one compiled by Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Harb. Tafsir Numani is also sometimes known as Tafsir Imam Jafar al-Sadiq. This book is collected by Abu Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Numani. Paul Noya believes this exegetic work is a Shia counterpart to Ibn Ata's exegesis on Quran except that in Sunni versions, the hadiths referring to the Ahl al-Bayt are all removed but one.Paul Noya, Collected Works of Abd al- Rahman Sulami, 2nd edition, Iran University Press, vol. 1, p. 48 Massignon believes a number of people could have compiled this exegetic work. Among them he names Jabir ibn Hayyan al-Kufi (aka Geber). He argues that Geber produced a number of books using Ja'far al-Sadiq's name, as the author. He adds that Dhul-Nun al-Misri whom according to Massignon believes was the first to edit Ja'far al-Sadiq's exegesis, was Geber's student in alchemy. Massignon also points out that Geber wrote a number of books on asceticism in which he uses the pseudonym Sufi. This view is in line with Ibn Nadim's statement of a book titled al-Tafsir among Geber's work. However, Aqa Buzurg challenges Ibn Nadim's attribution on the basis of Ibn Nadim's other claim that there is no mention of Geber in Shii books on transmission authorities. In Shia orthodoxy, the hadiths are not categorized as \\"narrated from the Prophet Muhammad and Imams\\" because rarely to the Ahadith come with transmission chains. Structure The exegesis opens with a hadith from Ja'far al-Sadiq, in which he classifies the verses of the Qur'an into four types: expressions (ibarat), allusions (isharat), substitutes (lataif), and truths (haqaiqa). Expressions are for common folk. The exegesis on each verse begins by citing a passage from the Qur'an. Then with the introduction of an expression like Jafar said, the exegesis comments. It contains approximately 35 hadiths covering 310 verses from various parts of the Qur'an.Gholamali Haddad Adel, Mohammad Jafar Elmi, and Hassan Taromi-Rad, Qur‚Äôanic Exegeses Selected Entries from Encyclopaedia of the World of Islam, pp. 2-6 See also *Qur'an *Qur'anic exegesis (Tafsir) *List of tafsir works References Shia tafsir ","title":"Tafsir Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq"},{"id":"41271262","text":"Jimmy London may refer to: * Jimmy London (reggae singer) (born 1949), Jamaican reggae singer * Jimmy London (rock singer) (born 1975), Brazilian punk/rock singer ","title":"Jimmy London"},{"id":"41271264","text":"Borja Navarro Garc√≠a (born 14 May 1990) is a Spanish footballer who plays for Caudal Deportivo as a forward.

In 1940 the brigade was responsible for the defences on the south side of the Thames Estuary including the Royal Naval Dockyard at Chatham and the Port of Dover. The brigade was heavily engaged throughout the Battle of Britain, in the summer of 1940, and The Blitz, from autumn 1940 to spring 1941, operating a total of 70 heavy anti- aircraft (HAA) guns controlled from a gun operations room (GOR) at Chatham. During 1942 many of the brigade's experienced units were transferred to active theatres overseas. Increasingly the brigade included women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS). From mid-1944 the German Luftwaffe began launching V-1 flying bombs against southeast England, whose speed and maneuverability made them hard for AA guns to destroy. As a result, the brigade was repositioned along the South Coast as part of a concentration of AA guns under Operation Diver to target V-1s coming in over the English Channel. As the launching sites in France were overrun by 21st Army Group by late 1944, the Luftwaffe switched to air-launching V-1s over the North Sea, forcing another redeployment to the east of London. The brigade was formally disbanded in 1946, following the end of the war. It was reformed in 1947 as 54 (Thames and Medway) AA Brigade, but permanently disbanded in 1948. Interwar period German air raids by Zeppelin airships and Gotha bombers on London and other British cities during World War I had shown the need for strong anti-aircraft (AA) defences in any future war. When the Territorial Army (TA) was reformed in the 1920s it included a number of dedicated AA units of the Royal Artillery (RA) and Royal Engineers (RE). At first these were concentrated in London under 26th and 27th Air Defence Brigades. In 1925 55th (Kent) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, RA was formed to defend the Medway Towns of north Kent. 28th Air Defence Brigade (AD Bde) was then formed at Tunbridge Wells to command the AA defences in the area, even though it only had 55th AA Bde under its command, and that in turn consisted only of 163rd (Kent) AA Battery at Tunbridge Wells. There were also 313 and 314 independent AA searchlight companies of the RE (TA) in Kent, but these were not formally subordinated to 28 AD Bde at this time.Litchfield, pp. 112‚Äì3.Monthly Army List 1925‚Äì35. At first, 28th AD Bde was subordinate to the Home Counties Area of Eastern Command, but as Britain's AA defences expanded during the 1930s, higher formations became necessary. 1st AA Division was formed to cover London and the Home Counties on 15 December 1935.Routledge, p. 59. The 28th ADB was reorganised as 28th (Thames & Medway) Anti-Aircraft Group, based at Kitchener Barracks, Chatham, and commanding all the gun and searchlight units in the area.Frederick, pp. 1048‚Äì50.Monthly Army List January 1936.

One wrecked aircraft was found on the marshes and credited to 206 Battery of 58th HAA Regiment, based at Allhallows, Kent.Routledge, pp. 374‚Äì5. During the summer of 1940 the brigade was joined by 53rd (City of London) HAA Regiment, which had been evacuated from Marseille after abandoning its guns in the wake of the Fall of France.53 HAA Regt War Diary 1940‚Äì41, The National Archives, Kew (TNA) file WO 166/2343. 28 AAB was responsible for the defences on the south side of the Thames Estuary (Thames South) including the Royal Naval Dockyard at Chatham, as well as the Port of Dover.6 AA Division at RA 39‚Äì45 By 11 July 1940, the Thames South AA layout operated by 28 AA Bde had a total of 70 HAA guns (3.7-inch and 4.5-inch).Farndale, p. 106. Battle of Britain 3.7-inch guns of 75th HAA Regiment at Dover, 1940. The Luftwaffe began its 1940 bombing offensive against the British mainland with small-scale raids on coastal targets. In July 1940 it began heavy daylight raids against south coast ports and shipping; the guns at Dover were in action virtually every day. Lieutenant- Colonel N.V. Sadler of 75th HAA Regiment developed an effective system of HAA barrages over individual points in Dover Harbour and the shipping channels, underpinned by light anti-aircraft (LAA) fire. In one day the regiment claimed to have shot down 10 aircraft: seven Junkers Ju 87 'Stukas', together with two Messerschmitt Bf 109s and a Dornier Do 215.Routledge, pp. 381‚Äì6. During this period 6 AA Division was placed under the operational control of No. 11 Group RAF, which remained the case for the rest of the war.Farndale, Annex D, p. 333. Decisions as to whether or not the guns could fire were made at the lower level sector operations rooms, an army officer sat beside each fighter controller and directed the gun crews when to open and cease fire.Price, p. 26 This was to ensure that anti-aircraft guns would not be firing when British fighter aircraft were liable to be hit.Deighton, p. 125 The brigade was heavily engaged throughout the Battle of Britain. On 18 August, for example, German air raids appeared over RAF airfields at West Malling, Manston, Kenley, Biggin Hill, Gravesend and the town of Sevenoaks, all within four and a half hours in the afternoon. The guns of 28 AA Bde and its neighbours were in action and claimed 23 German aircraft shot down. Four days later a mass raid flew up the Thames Estuary to attack RAF Hornchurch on the Essex shore: the raid was broken up by 28 and 37 AA Bde, and then the fighters of No. 11 Group RAF attacked. Follow-up raids were marked for the fighters by 'pointer' rounds of HAA fire. On 1 September over 200 German aircraft attacked Maidstone, Biggin Hill, Kenley and Chatham; operating in coordination with the fighters, the guns broke up the formations and claimed four aircraft shot down, but the airfields at Biggin Hill and Kenley were badly hit. Next day a mass raid arrived over the Medway and flew up the Thames towards Hornchurch. They came under heavy fire from the 3.7s and 4.5s of 28 and 37 AA Bdes and 15 were claimed as shot down before the fighters took over. On 7 September heavy raids up the estuary attacked oil wharves at Thameshaven, Tilbury Docks and Woolwich Arsenal: a total of 25 German aircraft were claimed by AA guns and fighters.Routledge, pp. 385‚Äì6.Farndale, p. 109. In addition to aircraft shot down claimed by the gunners, they caused many losses to German aircraft which went unseen from the British side. For example, on 28 July two Junkers 88 from the same German formation were damaged over the Thames Estury by anti-aircraft fire but managed to return to occupied Europe; however, both crashed on landing and were written off. Almost all the crew of both aircraft were killed or wounded.Deighton, p. 182 One of the lessons the Germans learnt during the Battle of Britain was that day bombers needed to fly in tight formation for mutual protection against fighters. However, the tighter formations made easier targets for ground based guns and were more vulnerable to AA fire. On 8 September a formation of 15 Dornier Do 17s flew along the Thames at 15,000 feet. The opening salvo from a troop of four 3.7-inch guns of 28 AA Bde brought down the three leading aircraft and scattered the others in disorder; they jettisoned their bombs as they escaped.Farndale, p. 107. On 15 September, remembered as the zenith of the battle, the guns of 28 AA Bde were in prolonged combat, engaging German aircraft over Chatham in the morning, and again in the afternoon.Farndale, p. 110. Overall, British anti-aircraft defences have been considered to have performed poorly during the Battle of Britain. They have been compared unfavourably with similar German efforts of the same period. General Frederick Pile, General Officer Commanding Anti- Aircraft Command, felt that his most effective weapon was the LAA Bofors gun, which was in short supply; as was the Kerrison Predictor, the only fully automated anti-aircraft fire-control system available for low and intermediate level anti-aircraft fire. For HAA guns, gun laying radar was not yet operational. The larger guns also suffered from a lack of operational mobility, being mostly sited in fixed concrete emplacements.Deighton, p. 302‚Äì03 The Blitz 4.5 inch anti-aircraft gun and crew of 207 Battery, 58th HAA Regiment, near Sittingbourne, Kent, January 1941 After 15 September the intensity of Luftwaffe day raids declined rapidly, and it began a prolonged night bombing campaign over London and industrial towns known as The Blitz. This meant that 28 Bde was in action night after night from 7 October 1940 to the end of May 1941 as the bomber streams approached the London Inner Artillery Zone (IAZ). British night air defences were in a poor state.Shores 1985, p. 56. Few guns had fire-control systems, and the underpowered searchlights were usually ineffective against aircraft at altitudes above .Hooton 1997, p. 33.Richards 1954, p. 201. In July 1940, only 1,200 heavy and 549 light guns were deployed in the whole of Britain. Of the \\"heavies\\", some 200 were of the obsolescent type; the remainder were the effective and guns, with a theoretical \\"ceiling\\"' of over but a practical limit of because the predictor in use could not accept greater heights. The light guns, about half of which were of the excellent Bofors 40 mm, dealt with aircraft only up to .Richards 1954, p. 202. Although the use of the guns improved civilian morale, with the knowledge the German bomber crews were facing the barrage, it is now believed that the anti-aircraft guns achieved little and in fact the falling shell fragments caused more British casualties on the ground.Gaskin 2006, pp. 186‚Äì187. At this time Thames South had a planned layout of 25 HAA sites (of which only 16 were occupied), controlled from a Gun Operations Room (GOR) at Chatham. It ran from Dartford to Chatham, where there was a strongly defended area containing the naval dockyards at Chatham and Sheerness and the aircraft factory at Rochester. 28 AA Bde was so stretched that 6 AA Division gave responsibility for LAA cover for Vulnerable Points (VPs) at Crayford, Northfleet, Rochester and the Isle of Grain to 56 LAA Bde. The searchlight layout in Thames South had the dual role of assisting both AA guns and night fighters.Routledge, pp. 387‚Äì9. As the Blitz continued, the number of HAA guns increased and they became more effective: an average of 20,000 shells were fired each German bomber shot down in September 1940; this reduced to 4,087 in January 1941; and to 2,963 shells per kill in February 1941. This was aided by the deployment of more radar and searchlights and more effective use of them.Ray 1996, p. 193. Operational research One of the operational sites in Thames South, TS21, was taken over by AA Command's Operational Research Group to combat-test and develop new technologies coming forward such as gun- laying (GL) radar and searchlight control (SLC) Radar. Improved GL Mark I E/F sets began to appear in November 1940, replacing sound-location for HAA sites, and the number of rounds that were fired on average for each \\"kill\\" began to fall. The GL radar was also effective in providing target heights for fighters, and the SL batteries were able to pass these to the night fighter controllers at RAF Kenley.Routledge, pp. 392‚Äì4.

V-1 falling over London, 1944. Operation Diver The Luftwaffe began a new bombing campaign against London in early 1944 (the Baby Blitz). By now the night fighter defences, the London Inner Artillery Zone and Thames Estuary defences were well organised and the attackers suffered heavy losses for relatively small results. More significant were the V-1 flying bombs, codenamed \\"Divers\\", which began to be launched against London from northern France soon after D-Day. These presented AA Command's biggest challenge since the Blitz. Defences had been planned against this new form of attack (Operation Diver), but it presented a severe problem for AA guns. Anti- aircraft gunners found that such small fast-moving targets were very difficult to hit. The cruising altitude of the V-1, between , was just above the effective range of light anti-aircraft guns, and just below the optimum engagement height of heavier guns. The altitude and speed were more than the rate of traverse of the standard British QF 3.7-inch mobile gun could cope with. The static version of the QF 3.7-inch, designed for use on a permanent, concrete platform, had a faster traverse. The cost and delay of installing new permanent platforms for the guns was avoided by the use of temporary platforms devised by the REME and made from railway sleepers and rails. This was found to be adequate for the static guns, making them considerably easier to re- deploy as the V-1 threat changed. They were known as 'Pile Platforms' after General Pile. After two weeks' experience of the V1 threat AA Command carried out a major reorganisation, stripping guns from the London IAZ and other parts of the UK and repositioning them along the south coast. In total 600 guns, 23,000 crew and support personnel and over 30,000 tons of ammunition were moved to the south coast in three days. Here they targeted V-1s coming in over the English Channel, where a downed V-1 would cause no damage.Routledge pp. 408‚Äì21. Static 3.7-inch gun of 127th HAA Rgt on a 'Pile Platform' at Southwold, Essex, 9 October 1944. As the launching sites were overrun by 21st Army Group, the Luftwaffe switched to air-launching V-1s over the North Sea, resulting in another redeployment for 1 AA Group, this time to the east of London. New HAA sites had to be quickly established, with new Pile Platforms' being built and thousands of huts moved and re-erected to shelter the crews as winter approached. During this phase of Operation Diver there were over 2,600 light and heavy AA guns along the coast of East Anglia between Newhaven and Deal, the \\"Diver Belt\\", and 850 to the east of London in the \\"Diver Box\\". 28 AA Bde was part of the latter group.Ellis, p. 231 The Germans responded by launching V1s from further to the north, in order to bypass the Diver defences. AA Command hurriedly set up the \\"Diver Strip\\" between Clacton and Great Yarmouth, and formed a new 9 AA Group to take over the Diver defences in East Anglia. 28 AA Bde moved to this new formation in December 1944, giving up its previous units and taking over fresh ones. The establishment of the Diver Strip included the establishment of permanent sites for 64 heavy guns, using Pile Platforms, constructing 60 miles of new roads to take heavy traffic and set up 3,500 Nissen huts. These necessitated the use of 150,000 tons of hard core, 500,000 concrete blocks and 20,000 panes of glass, among much other material. The setting up of the Diver Strip did not run as smoothly as earlier redeployments. General Pile reported move as \\"chaotic\\" and \\"deplorable and the attitude of staff as having \\"a general lassitude\\" and being \\"panicky\\".Pile, p. Nevertheless, the East Anglian defences as a whole were successful, less than 6% of air-launched V1s hit London.Atkinson p. 110‚Äì11 During the entire V1 campaign 10,492 V1s were targeted at London; 4,000 were destroyed by the various Diver defences, anti-aircraft guns, fighters and balloons, and 2,400 landed within greater London.

They particularly targeted Serb populated areas of eastern Bosnia. The role of the Schutzkorps is a point of debate. Persecution of Serbs conducted by the Austro-Hungarian authorities was the \\"first incidence of active 'ethnic cleansing' in Bosnia and Herzegovina\\". Some Muslim leaders emphasized that it would be wrong to blame the whole Muslim population of Bosnia and Herzegovina for the misdeeds of the Schutzkorps, because some Muslims provided help to their Serb neighbors, while some Serbs hid from persecution by applying to the Schutzkorps. History The Annexation crisis of 1908‚Äì09 erupted on 6 October 1908, when Austria-Hungary announced the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Many people of Bosnia and Herzegovina were dissatisfied with the events, particularly Serbs who remained in feudal obligations to their Muslim landlords. To prevent their uprising, Austria-Hungary undertook repressive measures against Serb population, conducted by Schutzkorps. Schutzkorps were organized in eleven battalions of volunteers. In Herzegovina, the Schutzkorps avoided taking overly harsh measures against Serb populations near the border of Montenegro to avoid provoking its reaction. Since Gacko and Nevesinje are not near the border, its Serb population was subjected to terror from the Schutzkorps. At the end of October 1908, Serbs of Gacko reported to the government in Sarajevo about the Schutzkorps' terror, but no action was taken to investigate their reports. After the outbreak of the First Balkan War in 1912, anti-Serb sentiment increased in the Austro-Hungarian administration in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Oskar Potiorek, governor of Bosnia and Herzegovina, closed many Serb societies and significantly contributed to the anti-Serb mood before the outbreak of World War I. The Government's plans to mobilize Croats and Muslims into Schutzkorps units in case of the war against Serbia were revealed in December 1912 in Banja Luka and caused protests among its Serb population. The idea to revive volunteer units was not implemented. The Schutzkorps was re-established on Potiorek's orders following the assassination. The leaders of the Pure Party of Rights in Zagreb played an important role in its establishment. The Austro-Hungarians granted the Schutzkorps \\"full powers to deal with the Serbian population.\\" Its members were primarily Bosnian Muslims. Bosnia and Herzegovina's Muslim inhabitants, with the exception of those who identified as Serbs, were generally pro- Habsburg. The Austro-Hungarians rarely questioned their loyalty. Croats also served within the ranks of the Schutzkorps, as did some Serbs. The militia's Serb members were motivated to join it because it precluded them from being sent to the frontlines. The decision to recruit primarily amongst Bosnian Muslims and Croats was part of deliberate divide-and-rule strategy employed by the Austro-Hungarians, the historian Aviel Roshwald writes. Initially, the militia consisted of around 11,000 men and 1,600 veterans. It increased in size over the course of the war, eventually numbering 20,000 members. The Austro-Hungarian authorities believed that the Serbs of Herzegovina were the most likely to launch an anti-Habsburg rebellion. Thus, about 5,000 members of the Schutzkorps, or about 45 percent of its initial manpower, were stationed in the region. Three-thousand of these were stationed in eastern Herzegovina. Following Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia on 28 July 1914, the Schutzkorps began conducting mass executions of Serb civilians in Herzegovina, notably hanging 79 of Trebinje's most prominent Serb citizens, among them intellectuals, landowners, and members of the clergy. Killings continued throughout Herzegovina, accompanied by the taking of hostages, looting, and the destruction of property. Executions were often arbitrary and the majority of victims were denied the right to legal recourse. Along the Drina River, near the border with Serbia, the Schutzkorps were tasked with \\"anti-bandit operations\\", culminating in a massacre of Serb civilians near Foƒça. Imprisonment of around 5,500 (700 to 2,200 of them died in prison) and execution of 460 citizens of Serb ethnicity in Bosnia and Herzegovina at the beginning of the World War I heavily relied on Schutzkorps. Around 5,200 Serb families were forcibly expelled from Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Schutzkorps shouted anti-Serb slogans and songs, such as \\"There is no three-fingered cross\\", while committing their crimes. Members of the Schutzkorps were not issued Austro-Hungarian military uniforms. Instead, they wore black-yellow armbands to distinguish themselves from Serbian irregulars, who also did not wear uniforms. The Schutzkorps members' dressing in civilian garb and use of Serbo-Croatian to shout orders resulted in several friendly-fire incidents between them and the Austro-Hungarian Army. It was subsequently ordered that basic commands had to be shouted in German. Legacy Ademaga Me≈°iƒá This was the first persecution of substantial number of citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina because of their ethnicity. Suljaga Salihagiƒá, a Bosnian Muslim, emphasized that not all Muslims were responsible for the activities of Schutzkorps because many provided help to their Serb fellow citizens. Some Muslim leaders denied that Schutzkorps were strictly Muslim and Croat units because many Serbs hid in these units, some even commanded by men of Serb ethnicity. One of the commanders of the Schutzkorps in the Te≈°anj region was Ademaga Me≈°iƒá, who went on to fight alongside the Usta≈°e during World War II. In 1929, a priest from Trebinje published a book, documenting the acts of persecution, murders, and destruction of houses committed by the Schutzkorps in Trebinje and several other villages of the region. The formation of a local Schutzkorps unit in Visegrad, by Muslims, is described in Ivo Andriƒá's 1945 novel The Bridge on the Drina.

It opened on July 4, 1976. The grounds consist of five areas: a traditional farm community of the 1870s, an 1890s progressive farmstead, an industrial sites complex, rural town, national peanut complex, and the Museum of Agriculture Center. Over 35 structures have been relocated to the site and faithfully restored or preserved including the Vulcan Steam Train running on narrow gaugeSteamlocomotive.info track. Costumed interpreters explain and demonstrate the lifestyle and activities of this time in Georgia's history.http://www.abac.edu/museum It is located at 1392 Whiddon Mill Road off I-75 at Exit 63B. The museum is a facility of Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College.  Notable facilities  Like many living museums, this one includes residences, a grist mill, saw mill and stores. More notable demonstrations include a turpentine still and a cotton gin. The cotton gin is a reconstruction designed to demonstrate ginning technologies of the period 1890‚Äì1900. During this period, mid-nineteenth century gins were being replaced by the system gin invented by Robert S. Munger. This gin demonstrates all the system ginning technologies, but does not operate as efficiently as a system gin because it only contains one gin stand. Its equipment was made by Lummus of Columbus, Georgia. In 1999, Lummus moved to Savannah, Georgia, where it continues to make cotton gins. The museum operates the gin for the public annually.

Description and history West Stockbridge Town Hall is located in the village center of the town, on the east side of Main Street near its junction with Center Street. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame building, with a gabled roof parallel to the street and a clapboarded exterior. The ground floor of the street-facing facade is organized into three storefronts, with an upstairs entrance at the far left end. Each storefront consists of a center entrance flanked by sash windows. All four doorways are sheltered by gabled hoods supported by large angle brackets. Pilasters rise at the building corners to a cornice separating the first and second floors. The second story has five large and evenly spaced sash windows. One of the few prominent 20th century exterior alterations is the addition of a cupola in 1978 to house the bell of an 1878 schoolhouse. Although it was built with the idea that other businesses would also occupy parts of the building, the town has taken over the entire space, which now also includes the public library. The downstairs houses some town offices and the library, and the upstairs, which was originally a large open hall with a stage at one end, has been partitioned for further office space, although these changes are reversible.

It measures high by wide. The triptych is made from three rectangular panels of elephant ivory and folds closed along two sets of three silver hinges. The central panel is divided into two scenes, with the Coronation of the Virgin above and the Crucifixion below. The left and right leaves are similarly split into two scenes, with Saint Peter and his church and Saint Stephen with his stones on the left leaf, and Saint Paul and his sword and Thomas Becket with mitre and crozier on the right leaf. The outer wings are also engraved with John Grandisson's coat of arms. Grandisson regarded Beckett as a hero and had written a biography of him. Original ownership John Grandisson, bishop of Exeter from 1327‚Äì1369,Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 246 was a man of education, culture, and capital. This example of medieval English ivory carving is unusual because it is carved with the bishop's emblems. Grandisson changed his family's coat of arms by substituting a mitre for the normal central eaglet, making the arms unique to him. His arms appear within an image of Exeter Cathedral, in the psalter of which he was the second owner, now in the British Library as Additional MS 21926.Records Of The Death Of Bishop John Grandisson, In 'The Grandisson Psalter', British Library The coat of arms almost certainly means that this work of art was commissioned by Bishop Grandisson during his tenure.

Messolonghi Football Club () is a Greek football club based in Messolonghi, Aetolia-Acarnania, Greece. The club was founded in 1931. They will play in Football League 2 for the season 2013-14. History At the dawn of 1930, various sports clubs were founded in Messolonghi, including Panetolikos and Olympiacos, which created football teams. Panetolikos will be superior, it will give friendly meetings with Panetolikos Agrinio and the weaknesses that will appear will lead to the need to create a strong team in our city, through the unification of clubs. Finally, after meetings of agents and the persuasion of the then Prefect of Etoloakarnania, the establishment of a joint acceptance group, called Athlitiki Enosis Messolonghi, was achieved at the beginning of 1931 (perhaps within March). Its first vital potential consists of players mainly from Panetolikos and Olympiacos, while other sources also mention the participation in the merger of other smaller teams (Niki, Keravnos, Asteras, Dafni, Atromitos, etc.). Its first board of directors consists of Messrs. Kaloulis, Katassos, Mores, Papoutsopoulos, Kantzouros etc., while its main players during the pre-war period were Dres (GK), Fakkas, Giannopoulos, Linardatos, Katsaitis, Zavitsanakis, Makedonopoulos, Galanis, Valakros, Valsakas, Vsaromakis, Stavropoulos Lampiris etc. The captain of the club and its first scorer during this period was Panagiotis Stavropoulos, later a member of the ERE. After a mediocre start, AE Messolonghi is slowly being organized, creating a strong team that is gaining experience and in 1934 is recording its top pre-war success, winning the championship of Etoloakarnania, defeating Panaitolikos Agrinio. Unfortunately, in 1936, the club became inactive and almost disbanded, due to the degradation of football in the Greek countryside, but also the actions of the dictatorship of Metaxas (establishment of EON, etc.). After the liberation, two new football clubs were founded in Messolonghi in 1946, Niki and Ethnikos, which are characterized by their political differences (left and right). In December 1946, they fought each other in two friendlies and Niki won overwhelmingly. A few days later, administrations and players of the two unions, leaving aside their political passions and in the midst of the civil war, are the first to set the example of reconciliation and re-establish the historic AE Messolonghi. Undertakes an steering committee from Messrs. Katasou, Lykoudis, Papatheodorou, Kyrili, Satrazemi, Galanopoulou, Fakka, Rapesi etc. and at the beginning of 1947 the old ace of Iraklis Thessaloniki, Dimitris Kollias, was hired as a player-coach. With his knowledge and experience, he will create a famous team, which in the next two years will at least achieve great and wonderful victories, impressing the fans. The executives of this wonderful group were Theofilatos, Synodinos, Nezeritis, Katsantonis, brothers Rigas and brothers Livieratou, Hasiotis, Raftopoulos, Papanastasiou, Karyofyllis, Kapnisis, Karavias, Apostolopoulos etc. Honours Domestic ** Delta Ethniki Champions: 2 *** 1993‚Äì94, 2012‚Äì13 ** Aitolia-Acarnania Champions: 12 *** 1968-69, 1969-70, 1970-71, 1971-72, 1973-74, 1976-77, 1984-85, 1987-88, 1999-2000, 2000-01, 2008-09, 2018-19 ** Aitolia-Acarnania Cup Winners: 5 *** 1978-79, 1987-88, 1996-97, 2007-08, 2011-12 Football clubs in Western Greece Association football clubs established in 1931 1931 establishments in Greece ","title":"A.E.

From the late 1960s to the early 1990s a wave of arrivals consisted of refugees, including those who were members of Solidarity, and non-immigrants who had temporary visas. In 1981 the Central Industrial Park (CIP) project destroyed much of Detroit's Poletown. By the 21st Century, the Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb counties formed the center of Michigan's Polish populations. Many Poles had moved from Hamtramck, and Troy became the center of the Polish-American community.

Those two counties have the highest numbers of Polish immigration in Metro Detroit. Politics In the 20th century, Poles were politically divided between Catholic traditionalists, Polish nationalists, and Socialists. The nationalists advocated for independence of Poland while the Catholic church favored working with the existing German, Russian, and Austrian governments. The Polish National Church had four parishes in Detroit. The church, founded by American Poles, used Polish liturgies and was against social conservatism. The Polish Catholic Union, the socialist Polish Mutual Aid Association, and the pro-independent Polish National Alliance were Polish social programs in the area.Babson, p. 28.

This was partly due to a curriculum introduced in the decade of 1900 that lacked Polish culture and strongly emphasized English language and literature, and partly due to a 1910 IQ testing-based tracking system that had the potential of denying immigrants access to academic programs.Vinyard, p. 181.

The TNS was originally built to house the legislative assembly of the regional parliament of Alsace-Lorraine, after the area came under German control with the Treaty of Frankfurt (1871). It was built between 1888 and 1889 in Neorenaissance style by the architect partners August Hartel and Skjold Neckelmann.  History  In 1919, when Alsace-Lorraine returned to France, the French Government offered the building to the city of Strasbourg, which in turn offered it to the Strasbourg music conservatory, at the behest of its new director Guy Ropartz, who was refusing to occupy the Palais du Rhin opposite. On 25 September 1944, the east wing of the building that contained the Chamber of the Assembly was destroyed by American bombing. It was reconstructed between 1950 and 1957, this time with a theatre auditorium replacing the assembly chamber. Michel Saint-Denis, the director of the National Theatre of Strasbourg at the time, entrusted this work to the architect Pierre Sonrel, who had recently worked with him in London restoring The Old Vic, which itself had been badly damaged by wartime bombing. In 1995, the fa√ßade, roofing, and the entrance on Place de la R√©publique were classified as a Monument historique.Ancien palais de la Di√®te d'Alsace- Lorraine, actuellement √âcole sup√©rieure d'Art dramatique (...) et Th√©√¢tre national de Strasbourg on the M√©rim√©e database of the French Ministry of Culture  Conservatory  In 1922, the Conservatory of Strasbourg (founded in 1855, the same year as the Orchestre philharmonique) was moved into the upper part of the building and several teaching rooms were built in as well as a concert hall. In 1995, the building wasn't deemed suitable enough for teaching music any more and the conservatory had to move out; it was subsequently relocated in the Cit√© de la musique et de la danse, a state-of- the-art building inaugurated in 2006. The concert hall has remained unused since. In 2016, the monumental pipe organ, a 1963 work by organ builder Curt Schwenkedel, was restored and moved into Saint Stephen‚Äôs Church, where it started a new life as a church organ instead of a concert organ.  Seating capacities  The Hartel and Neckelmann building houses two rooms: the salle Bernard-Marie Kolt√®s (470 or 600 seats) and the salle Hubert Gignoux (a 200-seat modular room). Two other theater rooms (120 and 250 seats, respectively) used by the TNS are located in Espace Klaus Michael Gr√ºber in rue Jacques Kabl√©.

Background Born in Fort Smith, Holland attended the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. Holland is United Methodist. He is a member of the National Rifle Association, the National Wild Turkey Federation, the Sebastian County Historical Society, and the Sebastian County Farm Bureau. He is single and resides in Greenwood in Sebastian County. Political life Holland was elected to the Senate from District 6 in 2010 for a two-year term when he defeated the Democrat John Paul Wells, a former state representative from Paris in Logan County, 14,838 to 9,602. Shifted to the District 9 seat vacated by the term-limited Republican Kim Hendren in 2012, Holland defeated Rick Green in the Republican primary, 2,438 to 2,201. He then prevailed over the Democrat Tracy Pennartz, 13,414 to 10,472, in the general election. His current two-year term expires at the end of 2014. Holland is the Senate assistant president pro tempore for the Third District, a post also held by Kim Hendren prior to 2013. He is the chair of the Senate Agriculture, Forestry and Economic Development Committee, and a member of the Budget, Education, Energy, and the Academic Facilities Oversight committees. Holland opposes abortion, having voted to ban the practice after twenty weeks of gestation or whenever fetal heartbeat is determined. He voted to allow university staff to carry concealed weapons. In 2013, Holland joined the Senate majority to reduce the amount of weekly unemployment compensation benefits and to test the recipients for illegal use of narcotics. He voted successfully to override Governor Mike Beebe's veto of a bill to require photo identification when a voter casts a ballot in Arkansas. He voted against successful legislation to make the office of prosecuting attorney in Arkansas nonpartisan. Holland voted to allow handguns to be carried on church properties and sponsored a bill to forbid the release of information on the holders of concealed carry permits. In the Republican primary election held on May 20, 2014, Holland was unseated for his party's nomination by the outgoing District 21 State Representative Terry Rice of Waldron. Rice prevailed with 3,457 votes (56 percent) to Holland's 2,710 (44 percent). The two differ over the private option version of Medicaid expansion. Since July 2016, Holland has served as Executive Director Arkansas Natural Resources Commission. That commission functioned within the Arkansas Department of Commerce until that department was abolished in 1983. It establishes policy and makes funding and regulatory decisions relative to soil conservation, nutrient management, water rights, dam safety, and water resources planning and development.

The new engine should read these data files and, in theory, load and understand them in a way that is indistinguishable from the original. The result of a proper engine clone is often the ability to play a game on modern systems that the old game could no longer run on. It also opens the possibility of community collaboration, as many engine remake projects tend to be open source. Game engine recreation can be beneficial to game publishers because the legal use of a re-creation still requires the original data files. Meaning, a player must still purchase the original game in order to legally play the re-created game (as detailed in this list of game engine recreations). Motivation Game engine recreations are made to allow the usage of classical games with newer operating system versions, recent hardware or even completely different operating systems than originally intended. Another motivation is the ability to fix engine bugs which is often hard or impossible with the original engines (with notable exceptions, see community patch) once a software has become unsupported abandonware, with the source code not available. Methods Top down When game engine recreations are made in a top down development methodology, in the first step the general game's functionality is programmed and the structure is defined. Then, in later steps, the resulting engine is adapted to the specific detail behaviour of the original game, often by reverse engineering, debugging and profiling the original. An example is OpenRA based on specifications contributed by the community by clean-room re- implementations without dis-assembling the original executable, which result in game engines whose behavior differs from the original.Development-Goals openra on github.com Another example is the Total Annihilation engine remake Spring Engine, which resulted in being used for many more games. Typically, this approach results in an approximation of the original behaviour only and not a \\"clock cycle wise\\" identical behaviour. On the positive side, running code exists faster, and the finally resulting source code is less specifically tied to a specific, single game and can be reused as a general game engine for other games. Bottom up Unlike Top down game engine recreations, bottom up dis-assembled/decompiled versions for a specific game are often able to replicate the behaviour of the original exactly. In these cases, the game core is recreated bottom up with reverse engineering of the original dis-assembled binary executable, CPU instruction for instruction. In the development phase this has the disadvantage that for a long time no running prototype exists. Also on the negative side, the resulting code is very specifically tied to this single game, often ugly (\\"pseudo-assembly code\\"Release: Starcraft on pyra-handheld.com \\"As you can see it doesn't look much different from x86 disassembly, the only difference is that you can compile it for other 32bit archs (there is no way it would work on 64bit..\\"Chaos Strikes Back for Windows (and Linux, MacOS X, Pocket PC) on Dungeon Master Encyclopedia \\"About 120,000 lines of pseudo-assembly language. Crazy thing to do. But it works.\\"), and can hardly be reused as general game engine. Examples are CSBWin or OpenTTD. Most often, the result is also not called \\"game engine\\" but \\"game recreation\\" or \\"game clone\\". MAME is an example of a video game engine emulation project which also follows this philosophy for accurate representation of the games. Source code ports Occasionally, as was the case with some of the engines/game cores in ScummVM, the original developers have helped the projects by supplying the original source code (those can be then called source ports). This is the best case, optimal for accuracy and minimizing the effort. An example is Beneath a Steel Sky.Source code \\"Source code for Beneath a Steel Sky in Assembly language (415,225 bytes) xxxx\\" (2005) Alternatives Emulation of classical systems or operating systems is an alternative to an engine recreation; for instance DOSBox is a notable emulator of the PC/MS-DOS environment. Static recompilation is another approach based on the original binary executable, potentially leading to better performance than emulation; an example is the 2014 ARM architecture version of StarCraft for the Pandora. Another alternative are source ports for the seldom cases that the source code is available; examples are Jagged Alliance 2 or Homeworld (more examples in the List of commercial video games with available source code).

The race is held in the last week of November along Hudson Bay shore in extremely cold weather. The organizer of the Polar Bear Marathon is Albert Martens, a native of Steinbach, Manitoba, which is situated some 1000 km south of Churchill. Martens is a seasoned marathon runner who himself has participated in around 60 marathon and ultramarathon races, including Badwater Ultramarathon in Death Valley, California. Martens came to the idea of marathon race in particularly challenging cold weather after running a marathon race at -32 ¬∞C in 2011. The challenge of the selected race route is related not only to tough weather (during 2013 race the temperatures dropped to -20 ¬∞C, or -41¬∞ with wind chill, while the runners in 2012 were \\"disappointed\\" by milder temperatures between -10¬∞ and -20¬∞), but also to the abundance of polar bears in its vicinity. Churchill is considered \\"the Polar Bear capital of the world\\", and during late fall they board fresh sea ice to hunt for seals. Not long before the date of the first race, November 20, 2012, news have spread about bear attacks in Churchill. Although race organizers consider a bear attack on runners unlikely, the participants run in pairs, to which they are assigned according to their pace running times, and each pair is escorted by a truck carrying food, extra clothing and emergency equipment including rifles. While the winners of the Polar Bear Marathon are awarded only symbolic prizes such as medals, stuffed polar bears and soapstone figurines by a local sculptor, the participation in the race costs them significant money. For the flights from Winnipeg to Churchill and back, three nights' hotel stay and sightseeing trip in the day following the race, the participants are expected to pay around $2,500. The number of competitors in the Polar Bear Marathon was initially restricted by the organizers to 20,Invitation by Athletes in Action Canada but for first three events even this proved to be a high estimate. In the 2012 race 14 runners from 3 countries (Canada, U.S. and Germany) took part while only 13 athletes ran the 2013 race (only in 2015 the number of participants exceeded 20, reaching 24). The first marathon was won by an international pair Eric Alexander (U.S.)-Gary Koop (Canada) who finished it in just over four hours, while a German runner Sven Henkes won the second race with a time of 4:12. During the 6th edition of the competition a half marathon and 50 km ultra marathon distances were added, with Mexican runners Santiago and Juana Ramirez winning both.
