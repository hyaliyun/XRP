Philanthropic Efforts and Relationships   Tournament of Tails  In 2014, Petplan started Tournament of Tails to help raise money and awareness for animal shelters across the United States. Based on the concept of NCAA March Madness brackets, Tournament of Tails helps bring awareness to shelter animals by creating a mock competition in which site visitors vote for 32 shelter pets based on their pictures and stories. Winners move on to the next round, and the last remaining contestant takes home $5,000 for their shelter. Petplan makes additional donations for every participating shelter, with each earning more as their contestants move up the bracket. In 2017, the Tournament garnered 261,496 votes with many of the contestants finding homes.  Hurricane Harvey  In August 2017, Petplan pledged $30,000 to support animal rescue operations in Texas in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. The $30,000 donation was equally distributed among Best Friends Animal Society¬Æ, The Humane Society of the United States and North Shore Animal League America, with each receiving $10,000 to further their rescue efforts.

His style has been said to combine aspects of Surrealism, Photorealism, and the art of James Rosenquist. He is of the same generation of painters who came to prominence in the 1990s such as Elizabeth Peyton, John Currin, Peter Doig, and Karen Kilimnik. He died at age thirty seven of a cerebral hemorrhage having completed sixty-three paintings over the course of his short career. He was represented by the Matthew Marks Gallery in New York during his lifetime. Work Peter Cain, Mobil, 1996, oil on linen, 37 x 57 inches Cain studied at New York's Parsons School of Design from 1977‚Äì1980 and the School of Visual Arts from 1980-1982. His early paintings derived their subjects from advertisements for rare and vintage automobiles, 1960s \\"muscle cars,\\" high end sports coupes, and luxury sedans. He often began by collaging the source material to produce a distorted, abbreviated version of the car's original form. He then used these collages as studies for his paintings. In Pathfinder, included in the 1993 Whitney Biennial (1992‚Äì93, oil on linen), Cain merged the front fender and headlights of a black SUV with the rear third of the vehicle. The car‚Äôs hood, front doors and cab have completely disappeared, and the newly transmogrified Pathfinder has then been tipped up on its trunk against a solid white ground. Writing on a similar painting, critic Jerry Saltz said that the car paintings ‚Äúcleverly question the nature of intelligence by presenting the image of a ‚Äòthing‚Äô that is knowable and unclassifiable in a painting that is like a filmstrip of a painting all collapsed and run together in to a single dense frame.‚Äù‚ÄúWild Thing: Peter Cain‚Äôs Untitled‚Äù Arts Magazine, March 1990, 14 In 1996, Cain turned his attention from cars to Los Angeles gas stations and convenience stores a year before his death. These landscapes are void of any human presence; Cain even erased logos and type from the numerous signs which inhabit such places. The face that greets Los Angeles car culture is eerily blank, and what can be understood as foliage is rendered in micro-faceted and hallucinogenic masses of green paint. The gas stations are spare in painterly incident, but redolent of narrative possibilities. When the Los Angeles paintings had their posthumous premier at the Matthew Marks Gallery in 1997, critics praised them for challenging the conventional wisdom that painting‚Äôs capacity to express genuine emotion was long gone. Peter Schjeldahl lamented, ‚ÄúI had trouble with Cain‚Äôs car pictures while being enchanted by the promise of his painterly gifts and ambition. Now we see the beginning of the promise‚Äôs fulfillment in the same instant as its end: an exceptional talent nipped in mid-blossoming, just short of full bloom. ‚ÄùHail and Farewell, Village Voice, February 25, 1997.

It has the distinction of being the work Johnson considered his greatest failure. Since his death, the critical consensus has been that he was right to think so. Irene was Johnson's only play, and was first performed on 6 February 1749 in a production by his friend and former pupil, David Garrick. The play was a commercial success and earned Johnson more money than anything else he had written up to that point. It was never revived during his lifetime, and there is no subsequent evidence of any other full-scale productions of Irene anywhere until 1999, making it one of the most unsuccessful plays ever written by a major author. Background Johnson began writing Irene around 1726 when he first began to work in his father's bookshop. While in the bookshop he befriended Gilbert Walmesley, the Registrar of the Ecclesiastical Court of Lichfield. Johnson would discuss Irene with Walmesley, and read him some of the early drafts. At one point, Walmesley told Johnson that \\"he was making Irene suffer so much in the first part of the play that there would be nothing left for her to suffer in the later part\\". Johnson joked that there was \\"enough in reserve... I intend to put my heroine into the ecclesiastical court of Lichfield which will fill up the utmost measure of human calamity\\". Johnson wrote a considerable part of Irene in 1737 while teaching at Edial Hall School, the academy he had founded in 1735. Johnson spent his evenings working on his play while ignoring his wife Elizabeth (known as Tetty). This provoked David Garrick, his student, to perform a skit mocking the incidents, although the incidents he portrayed were more than likely his own fabrications. However, the play was written mostly for Mrs. Johnson; she was fond of it and hoped it would be a success. Her belief in the play inspired Johnson to finish it and push to have it performed. When Edial Hall failed, Johnson travelled to London and brought the unfinished manuscript with him. In 1737, Johnson tried to submit Irene to Charles Fleetwood, the owner-manager of the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, but Fleetwood rejected it on the grounds that there was no patron and his theatre was catering to other types of performances. Johnson tried in 1741 to have the unperformed play printed, but this too failed. He seems to have continued to revise it over the next several years, since a manuscript notebook contains draft material made not earlier than June 1746. It was not until Garrick took over as manager of Drury Lane Theatre that the play was guaranteed a production. By this point Johnson was hard at work on his Dictionary, but he found time for further work on Irene. Play Prologue of Irene, first edition 1749 Johnson's main source for the story of Irene was Richard Knolles's Generall Historie of the Turkes (1603), although he also made some use of George Sandys's Relation of a Journey...containing a Description of the Turkish Empire (1615), Herbelot's Biblioth√®que Orientale (1697) and Humphrey Prideaux's Life of Mahomet (1697). In Knolles's work, the Sultan Mahomet conquers Constantinople in 1453 and captures a Greek Christian named Irene. He decides to take her as his mistress, and while pursuing her romantically he ignores his duties as a monarch. Soon, the kingdom is falling apart from neglect and the subjects begin to riot, so Mahomet kills Irene to prove his dedication to his people. Johnson alters the story to emphasise the theme of Irene's temptation. His Mahomet offers Irene a deal: if she becomes a Muslim, he will preserve her life and give her power at his court. > IRENE: > Forbear ‚Äî O do not urge me to my ruin! > MAHOMET: > To state and pow'r I court thee, not to ruin: > Smile on my wishes, and command the globe. > Security shall spread her shield before thee, > And Love infold thee with his downy wings. > (Irene II. vii ll. 79‚Äì83) Epilogue of Irene, first edition 1749 Johnson goes on to emphasise how the pursuit of worldly power tends to corrupt. After Irene has accepted the Sultan's offer and abandoned her religious faith, she falls out with her virtuous friend Aspasia: > ASPASIA: > Ah! let me rather seek the convent's cell; > There where my thoughts, at intervals of pray'r, > Descend to range these mansions of misfortune, > Oft' shall I dwell on our disastrous friendship, > And shed the pitying tear for lost Irene. > IRENE: > Go, languish on in dull obscurity; > Thy dazzled soul with all its boasted greatness, > Shrinks at th' o'erpow'ring gleams of regal state, > Stoops from the blaze like a degenerate eagle, > And flies for shelter to the shades of life. > (Irene III. viii. ll. 93‚Äì102) As a result of her decision to become Mahomet's queen, Irene becomes ensnared in a complex power struggle between his various advisors: the First Visier Cali Bassa, the Aga Mustapha, and the officer Abdalla, who is suffering from unrequited love for Aspasia. Mahomet becomes convinced that Bassa, with Irene's complicity, is plotting against him. Two of Abdalla's captains kill Irene, but with her dying words she reveals that Bassa's true accomplice was the Greek soldier Demetrius, Aspasia's lover, who has safely escaped with his loved one. On learning that Irene had not been conspiring against him, Mahomet is distraught: > MAHOMET: > Robb'd of the maid, with whom I wish'd to triumph, > No more I burn for fame or for dominion; > Success and conquest now are empty sounds, > Remorse and anguish seize on all my breast; > Those groves, whose shades embower'd the dear Irene, > Heard her last cries, and fann'd her dying beauties, > Shall hide me from the tasteless world for ever. > (Irene V. xii. ll. 42‚Äì48) The play is written in blank verse but, as Walter Jackson Bate claims, \\"reads like heroic couplets from which the rhyme has been removed, and couplets in which the poet has so much anxiety to keep a strict regularity of meter that other considerations ‚Äì even of style and rhythm alone ‚Äì become sacrificed.\\" It is evident from the scansion of the above lines that Johnson pronounced \\"Irene\\" in its Classical form with three syllables, , and not in the contemporary form . Stage history David Garrick's acceptance of Irene for production prompted Johnson to finish rewriting the play. Garrick changed the play's title to Mahomet and Irene, and requested changes that would make the play more acceptable to his sense of theatrical style. Johnson was initially opposed to the changes and complained that Garrick \\"wants me to make Mahomet run mad, that he may have an opportunity of tossing his hands and kicking his heels\\". Johnson's friend John Taylor resolved the dispute and Johnson ultimately carried out Garrick's suggestions, which included revising Irene's death scene so that she would be strangled onstage, instead of offstage as originally written. Mahomet and Irene opened on 6 February 1749. Elizabeth Johnson was unable to attend the performance because of illness. Johnson arrived at the theatre in the kind of clothing he considered as the \\"distinction of dress\\" required of a playwright; he wore \\"a scarlet waistcoat with gold lace and a gold-laced hat\\". The Prologue \\"soothed the audience, and the play went off tolerably, till it came to the conclusion\\". The conclusion in question was Irene's onstage strangulation, which upset the audience and provoked shouts of \\"Murder!\\". The actress quickly left the stage; for all successive performances Garrick restored Johnson's original ending. The play was performed for nine nights, by the standards of 18th century London a very respectable run. Johnson received ¬£195 17s. for the performances. Robert Dodsley published the playscript on 16 February 1749 and Johnson received an additional ¬£100. This made Irene the most financially lucrative work Johnson had yet written: during this period of his career, only the Dictionary earned him more money. Cast Hannah Pritchard played the role of Irene and Garrick cast himself in the role of Demetrius. Other notable actors in the play's original cast were Susannah Maria Arne (using her professional name \\"Mrs. Cibber\\") as Aspasia and Spranger Barry as Mahomet. The complete cast list, according to the first edition, is as follows: * Mahomet, Emperor of the Turks ‚Äî Mr. Barry * Cali Bassa, First Visier ‚Äî Mr. Berry * Mustapha, A Turkish Aga ‚Äî Mr. Sowden * Abdalla, An Officer ‚Äî Mr. Harvard * Hasan, Turkish Captain ‚Äî Mr. Usher * Caraza, Turkish Captain ‚Äî Mr. Burton * Demetrius, Greek Nobleman ‚Äî Mr. Garrick * Leontius, Greek Nobleman ‚Äî Mr. Blakes * Murza, A Eunuch ‚Äî unlisted * Aspasia, Greek Lady ‚Äî Mrs. Cibber * Irene, Greek Lady ‚Äî Mrs. Pritchard * Attendants on Irene ‚Äî unlisted Critical response Irene has never been the most admired of Johnson's works. Even James Boswell found it wanting: > Analysed into parts, it will furnish a rich store of noble sentiments, fine > imagery, and beautiful language; but it is deficient in pathos, in that > delicate power of touching the human feelings, which is the principle end of > the drama. Indeed Garrick has complained to me, that Johnson not only had > not the faculty of producing the impressions of tragedy, but that he had not > the sensibility to perceive them. Johnson's friend Bennet Langton recorded the author's own later disenchantment with the piece: > At another time, when one was reading his tragedy Irene to a company at a > house in the country, he [Johnson] left the room; and somebody having asked > him the reason of this, he replied, \\"Sir, I thought it had been better.\\"' The early 20th century consensus of opinion was summed up by George Sampson in 1941: \\"Of his early tragedy Irene [...] it is enough to say that its moral dialogues, its correctness of plan and its smoothness of verse do not suffice to give it any rank as drama.\\" T. S. Eliot suggested an explanation for the play's unpopularity and neglect: > His verse has none of the dramatic qualities; it is correct, but correctness > in such isolation becomes itself a fault. The play would be more readable > to-day, if he had written it in rhyme; the whole would be more easily > declaimed, and the good things more easily remembered; it would lose none of > its excellence of structure, thought, vocabulary and figures of speech. What > would be mellifluous in rhyme, is merely monotonous without it. F.R. Leavis argued that Boswell's criticisms of the play ‚Äì \\"that [Johnson] has no sense of the theatre, and worse, cannot present or conceive his themes dramatically\\" ‚Äì were \\"obvious\\", and that Irene was a failure because Johnson's best poetry (such as The Vanity of Human Wishes) was \\"a poetry of statement, exposition and reflection: nothing could be remoter from the Shakespearean use of language [...] than the Johnsonian.\\" Like Eliot, Leavis suggested that the play might have been better if Johnson had not been determined to write it in blank verse: > He is clearly determined that his verse shall not be changed into the > 'periods of a declaimer', and that it shall not be said that the audience > cannot easily perceive 'where the lines end or begin' (see his remarks on > blank-verse in the Life of Milton). In couplets, of course, he couldn't have > written so dismally. With the absence of rhyme and of the movement goes the > absence of wit. And without the wit he is without the Johnsonian weight. Johnson biographer Walter Jackson Bate has attempted to defend Irene, arguing that the reason why it is considered so bad is that the reader cannot help being aware that \\"it is by one of the masters of English prose style (who also had a powerful command of one kind of poetic style), and it is also by one of the supreme critics of literature in whatever language\\". Bate claims that if contemporary readers were able to encounter the play without knowing who had written it, \\"it would not seem too bad\\"; but since we cannot forget Johnson's achievements in other fields of literature, reading Irene is an especially depressing experience: \\"the heart begins after a while to sink except in the most resolute Johnsonian, and sometimes even then.\\" Notes References * .  . . * External links * Irene at Project Gutenberg 1749 plays 1749 poems Poetry by Samuel Johnson ","title":"Irene (play)"},{"id":"18826405","text":"Philippe Cattiau (July 28, 1892 - February 18, 1962) was a French fencer who won a total of eight Olympic medals between 1920 and 1936.

Although the work began as Thrale's diary focused on her experience with her family, it slowly changed focus to emphasise various anecdotes and stories about the life of Samuel Johnson. The work was used as a basis for Thrale's Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson, but the Thraliana remained unpublished until 1942. The anecdotes contained within the work were popular with Thrale's contemporaries but seen as vulgar. Among 20th century readers, the work was popular, and many literary critics believe that the work is a valuable contribution to the genre and for providing information about Johnson's and her own life. Background Hester Thrale, when still Hester Lynch Salusbury, spent her youth writing letters and keeping journals. Her talents at writing won her the respect of her uncles, Sir Robert Cotton and Sir Thomas Salusbury, who later appointed her their heir.Bloom 1998 p. 74 When Thrale was older, she became close to Johnson. It was natural to her to keep a detailed collection of anecdotes and stories of their time together, as of everything she experienced.Balderston 1951 p. ix The two initially bonded after Thrale gave birth to her first child, Queeney, in 1766. Samuel Johnson However, there were problems between Thrale and Johnson, along with \\"his defenders\\" during his life and in criticism since then, over their \\"gradual estrangement\\" from each other after the death of her husband. These problems were then heightened by her marriage to Gabriel Piozzi. After Johnson's death, Thrale felt isolated because she believed that Johnson's previous friends along with the public as a whole did not accept her, and some went so far as to claim she abandoned Johnson in his final moments.Brownley 1985 p. 631 In particular, James Boswell, who resented Thrale and felt himself as her literary competitor, began to exploit the falling out between Thrale and Johnson's friends in order to promote his Life of Samuel Johnson. After the birth of Queeney, Thrale began to document the various moments in her daughter's life in a \\"baby book\\" called The Children's Book. The work eventually expanded to include documentation of the whole family and was retitled the Family Book. To encourage his wife's writing her husband Henry Thrale gave her six blank diary books, with the title Thraliana on the cover, in 1776. The work was intended as an Ana,Balderston 1951 p. x which she admits her fascination with in the Thraliana: \\"I am grown quite mad after these French Anas; Anecdote is in itself so seducing\\".Thrale 1951 p. 463 After searching for English models for writing her Ana, she settled on used John Selden's Table Talk, William Camden's Remains, and Joseph Spence's Anecdotes as her guides. In May 1778, she was given by Johnson a manuscript of Spence's Anecdotes, but her first years of the Ana were written without an exact model.Balderston 1951 p. xi Before the Thraliana, Thrale kept two sets of anecdotes: the first was devoted to Samuel Johnson and the other for miscellaneous events. She relied on these, along with her memory, to write the early portions of her work.Balderston 1951 p. xii Boswell, when trying to find information for his own work, wrote: \\"Mr. Thrale told me, I am not sure what day, that there is a Book of Johnsoniana kept int heir Family, in which all Mr. Johnson's sayings and all that they can collect about him is put down ... I must try to get this Thralian Miscellany, to assist me in writing Mr. Johnson's Life, if Mrs. Thrale does not intend to do it herself.\\"Boswell 1941 p. 200 After Johnson's death, Thrale used the Thraliana to create the Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson (1786).Bloom 1998 p. 75 The manuscript passed through many hands and was owned by A. Edward Newton until his death in autumn 1940. The Thraliana was eventually published in 1942, and it was produced by the Clarendon Press in England while its editor, Katharine Balderston, was prohibited from travelling across the ocean from Wellesley College because of World War II.Balderston 1951 p. vi Ana Thrale explains that her book is not for \\"diary-keeping in the strict sense\\" when she writes on the first page: \\"It is many Years since Doctor Samuel Johnson advised me to get a little Book, and write in it all the little Anecdotes which might come to my Knowledge, all the Observations I might make or hear; all the Verses never likely to be published, and in fine ev'ry thing which struck me at the Time. Mr Thrale has now treated me with a Repository, - and provided it with the pompous Title of Thraliana; I must endeavour to fill it with Nonsense new and old.\\"Thrale 1951 p. 1 These encouraging remarks from Johnson set the theme of the work as it became a new \\"Johnsoniana\\" collection. In particular, she transferred her previous notes and documentations about Johnson's life into the collection. In a 6 September 1777 letter, Johnson told Thrale to be \\"punctual in annexing the dates. Chronology you know is the eye of history\\".Johnson No, 542 However, the system of Ana allowed Thrale to group items by theme instead of by topics, like \\"Odd medical Stories\\", to organize anecdotes, quotations, and stories. When Henry Thrale died while Thrale was writing Volume Three, the work became a diary for Thrale to discuss her thoughts and feelings after her loss. This volume soon began to describe Thrale's feelings for Gabriel Piozzi. Throughout the Thraliana, Thrale examines how others view her, which reveals her anxieties that she had about how she was perceived. This is especially true when she writes: \\"Life has been to me nothing but a perpetual Canvass carried on in all parts of the World - not to make Friends neither - for I have certainly found very few - but to keep off Enemies\\". Thrale initially did not want to write in the sixth volume of the Thraliana, but did so because \\"Johnson said that Pleasure might one day be made from such Nonsense, so I'll e'en finish this last Volume of Anecdote & store up no more Stuff\\".Thrale Vol II p. 840 However she did not stop journal writing after she finished but continued to write for the remainder of her life.Brownley 1985 p. 635 Critical response Thrale's anecdotes were popular when they were first published in various works, but many readers initially thought that her \\"relaxed and natural style\\" was vulgar.Brownley 1985 p. 630 However, Martine Brownley points out that this style helped win over 20th century readers even though the work suffered from \\"unevenness\\". Katherine Balderston regards the work as \\"what was almost, if not quite, the first English ana\\". James Clifford declared that \\"there is much valuable evidence about the great man,\\" Samuel Johnson, within the Thraliana.Clifford 1978 p. 10 He also stated that the work, along with her Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson, \\"established her reputation as a bluestocking writer of the late eighteenth century. Edward Bloom et al. claim that the Thraliana, as with her letters, lays \\"bare a woman's psychology\\".Bloom 1978 p. 310 Notes References * Balderston, Katharine C. \\"Introduction\\" in Thraliana: The Diary of Mrs Hester Lynch Thrale (Later Mrs. Piozzi) 1776-1809.

Like all Catholic devotions, these prayer forms are not part of the official public liturgy of the Church but are based on the popular spiritual practices of Roman Catholics. Many are officially approved by the Holy See as suitable for spiritual growth but not necessary for salvation. Some devotions arise from private revelations, or personal religious experiences of saints. The Church has a tradition of thorough investigation of such private revelations and the lives of candidates for sainthood to assure that no natural or scientific explanation can, at the time of investigation, account for any miracles involved.

The reverence and affection with which Christians have regarded the Holy Name of Jesus goes back to the earliest days of Christianity.Outlines of dogmatic theology, Volume 2 by Sylvester Hunter 2010 page 443 The devotions and venerations also extend to the IHS christogram (a monogram of the Holy Name), derived from the first three letters of the Greek word for Jesus ŒôŒóŒ£ŒüŒ•Œ£ (sometimes erroneously interpreted as Iesus Hominum Salvator, Jesus saviour of mankind), representing the Holy Name.Christian sacrament and devotion by Servus Gieben 1997 page 18The Continuum encyclopedia of symbols by Udo Becker 2000 page 54 The feast day is celebrated either as the Feast of the Holy Name of Jesus or as that of Circumcision of Jesus, in various Christian churches. The month of January is dedicated to the Holy Name of Jesus.Holweck, Frederick. \\"Special Devotions for Months.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 27 April 2020 Infant Jesus of Prague Infant Jesus of Prague The Infant Jesus of Prague is a famous statue of infant Jesus in the Church of Our Lady Victorious in Mal√° Strana, Prague. The exact origin of the Infant Jesus statue was not truly known, but historical sources point to a small 28 cm high sculpture of the Holy Child with a bird in his right hand carved in around the year 1340. Many other Infant Jesus sculptures were also carved by famous masters throughout Europe in the Middle Ages. The ornate statue depicts the Infant Jesus with his left hand holding a golden orb symbolizing kingship and the right hand raised with the palm in a gesture of blessing. The devotion began in Prague in 1639; the tradition of the Infant Jesus procession and coronation continues to this day. The devotion is also widespread in Ireland. The Feast of the Holy Name of Jesus is the principal feast of the miraculous Infant.Davies, O.Carm., Peter. \\"The Miraculous Infant Jesus of Prague\\" Similarly, the Santo Bambino of Aracoeli is venerated in Rome.  Eucharistic adoration  St Peter Julian Eymard, Apostle of the Eucharist In the Roman Catholic tradition, at the moment of Consecration the elements (or \\"gifts\\" as they are termed for liturgical purposes) are transformed (transubstantiation) into the actual Body and Blood of Christ. Catholic doctrine holds that the elements are not only spiritually transformed, but rather are actually (substantially) transformed into the Body and Blood of Christ. The Scholastic philosophical explanation is that although the elements retain the appearance or \\"accidents\\" of bread and wine, they are indeed the actual Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity of Christ. This is one form of the doctrine of Real Presence--the actual, substantive presence of Jesus in the Eucharist. One of the first possible references to reserving the Blessed Sacrament for adoration is found in a life of St. Basil (who died in 379). The Franciscan archives credit Saint Francis of Assisi (who died in 1226) with starting Eucharistic Adoration in Italy. The lay practice of adoration formally began in Avignon, France on 11 September 1226. The Venerable Leo Dupont initiated the nightly adoration of the Blessed Sacrament in Tours in 1849, from where it spread within France.Dorthy Scalan. The Holy Man of Tours. (1990) Leo Dupont interacted with Saint Peter Julian Eymard, who formed the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament in 1858.Joan Carroll Cruz, OCDS, Saintly Men of Modern Times. (2003) The same year, Eymard (also known as the Apostle of the Eucharist) and sister Marguerite Guillot formed the Servants of the Blessed Sacrament which now maintains houses on several continents where continuous Eucharistic adoration takes place.Letellier, Arthur. \\"Congregation of the Servants of the Most Blessed Sacrament.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 8 April 2017 Holy Hour The Holy Hour devotion consists of an uninterrupted hour spent in Eucharistic adoration or in prayer in the presence of the Blessed Sacrament. The inspiration for the Holy Hour is .Peter Stravinskas, 1998, Our Sunday Visitor's Catholic Encyclopedia, OSV Press page 498 In the Gospel of Matthew, during the agony in the Garden of Gethsemane the night before his crucifixion, Jesus spoke to his disciples, saying \\"My soul is sorrowful even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me\\" (Matthew 26:38). Returning to the disciples after prayer, he found them asleep and in Matthew 26:40 he asked Peter,\\"So, could you men not keep watch with me for an hour?\\" The official Enchiridion Indulgentiarum provides an indulgence for this practice.  Stations of the Cross  The Stations of the Cross refers to the depiction of the final hours (or Passion) of Jesus. The tradition as a chapel devotion began with St. Francis of Assisi and extended throughout the Roman Catholic Church in the medieval period. It became popular in the eleventh century, at a time when much Christian attention was focused on the Holy Land but few were able to actually visit. Great numbers of Europeans found an equivalent to walking the Via Dolorosa in following Christ's footsteps in spirit. This devotion is traditionally observed on Fridays during Lent, as well as, on Good Friday, but may be prayed at any time. Many will use meditations composed by St. Alphonsus Ligouri, or the scriptural references or other texts, or simply contemplate the depicted event in the life of Jesus.  Holy Face of Jesus  Secondo Pia's negative of the image on the Shroud of Turin, used in the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus Belief in the existence of authentic images of Christ is connected with the old legend of Abgar of Edessa and the apocryphal writing known as the \\"Mors Pilati\\". The oldest and best known of these images, it was called vera icon (true image), which ordinary language soon made Veronica.D√©gert, Antoine. \\"St. Veronica.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 9 April 2017 In 1843 Sister Marie of St. Peter, a Carmelite nun in Tours, France, reported visions of Jesus and Mary in which she was urged to spread the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus, in reparation for the many insults Jesus suffered in His Passion. The devotion was further spread by the efforts of the Venerable Leo Dupont (known as the Apostle of the Holy Face). The devotion was initiated shortly before Dupont's death and later influenced Saint Therese of Lisieux.Dorthy Scallan. The Holy Man of Tours. (1990) Pope Leo XIII approved of the devotion in 1885. In 1936, Sister Maria Pierina de Micheli, a nun from Milan in Italy, reported a vision in which Jesus told her: \\"I will that My Face, which reflects the intimate pains of My Spirit, the suffering and the love of My Heart, be more honored. He who meditates upon Me, consoles Me\\". Further visions reportedly urged her to make a medal with the Holy Face based on the image from Secondo Pia's photograph of the Shroud of Turin. In 1958, Pope Pius XII approved of the devotion and the Holy Face medal and allowed for the remembrance of the Holy Face of Jesus on Shrove Tuesday (the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday) for all Roman Catholics.Joan Carroll Cruz, OCDS. Saintly Men of Modern Times. (2003) Holy Face Devotion http://www.holyfacedevotion.com/timeline.htm  Sacred Heart  Devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus is based on the heart as a symbol of his love for humanity. In Roman Catholicism, the Sacred Heart has been closely associated with Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ. In his encyclical Miserentissimus Redemptor Pope Pius XI stated: \\"the spirit of expiation or reparation has always had the first and foremost place in the worship given to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus\\".Miserentissimus Redemptor Encyclical of Pope Pius XI Formal references to this devotion first appeared in the eleventh and twelfth centuries.Bainvel, Jean. \\"Devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 8 April 2017 However, the most significant source for the devotion to the Sacred Heart in its present form was Visitandine Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque (1647‚Äì1690), who claimed to have received a series of private revelations from 1673 to 1675. From this developed the First Friday Devotion. The devotion consists of several practices that are performed on the first Fridays of nine consecutive months. On these days, a person is to attend Mass and receive Communion.Roman Catholic worship: Trent to today by James F. White 2003 page 35 If the need arises, in order to receive Communion in a state of grace, a person should also make use of the Sacrament of Penance before attending Mass. In many Catholic communities the practice of the Holy Hour of meditation during the Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament during the First Fridays is encouraged.Meditations on the Sacred Heart by Joseph McDonnell 2008 page 118 The Feast of the Sacred Heart is now a holy day in the Roman Catholic liturgical calendar, and is celebrated 19 days after Pentecost. The month of June is dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.  Precious Blood  The devotion to the Precious Blood was a special phenomenon of Flemish piety in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, that gave rise to the iconic image of Grace as the \\"Fountain of Life,\\" filled with blood, pouring from the wounded \\"Lamb of God\\" or the \\"Holy Wounds\\" of Christ. The image, which was the subject of numerous Flemish paintings, was in part spurred by the renowned relic of the Precious Blood, which had been noted in Bruges since the twelfth centuryEvelyn Underhill, \\"The Fountain of Life: An Iconographical Study\\", The Burlington Magazine 17.86 (May 1910, pp. 99‚Äì101) p.100. and which gave rise, from the late thirteenth century, to the observances, particular to Bruges, of the procession of the \\"Saint Sang\\" from its chapel.The first historian of the \\"Saint Sang\\" was the Abb√© Carton, \\"Essai sur l'histoire du Saint Sang\\", Bruges, 1857. (noted Underhill 1910:100 note). It was also particularly propagated by Gaspar del Bufalo, founder of the Missionaries of the Precious Blood. The Feast of the Most Precious Blood, formerly celebrated on the first Sunday in July, was removed from the General Roman Calendar in 1969, \\"because the Most Precious Blood of Christ the Redeemer is already venerated in the solemnities of the Passion, of Corpus Christi, of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and in the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross. But the Mass of the Most Precious Blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ is placed among the votive Masses\\".Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1969), p. 128 The moth of July is traditionally dedicated to the Most Precious Blood of Jesus.  Holy Wounds  The Crusades brought a renewed enthusiasm for religious devotion, especially for the Passion of Christ. The five Holy Wounds of Christ were the five piercing wounds inflicted upon Jesus during his crucifixion. Among specific devotions to the Holy Wounds are the Redemptorist's, Chaplet of the Five Wounds of Jesus, the Passionist Chaplet of the Five Wounds, and the Rosary of the Holy Wounds (also called the Chaplet of Holy Wounds), first introduced at the beginning of the 20th century by the Venerable Sister Marie Martha Chambon, a lay Roman Catholic Sister of the Monastery of the Visitation Order in Chamb√©ry, France.Ann Ball, 2003 Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices There is a separate devotion regarding the shoulder wound of Jesus. The relevant prayer calls to mind the wound he is said to have received during the carrying of his cross. It is variously attributed to Bernard of Clairvaux,Catholic Online - Prayers St. Gertrude, or St. Mechtilde.Preces Gertrudianae sive vera et sincera medulla precum potissimum ex revelationibus BB. Gertrudis et Mechtildis excerptarum. Editio nova, accurate recognita et emendata a monacho ordinis S. Benedicti Congregationis Beuronensis, 1903 The shoulder wound did not inspire as significant a devotional following as the wound in the side \\"...with its direct access to Christ's heart.\\"Sargent, Emily Jo. \\"The Sacred Heart: Christian Symbolism\\", The Heart, (James Peto, ed.), Yale University Press, 2007,  Divine Mercy  The Divine Mercy is a devotion associated with reputed apparitions of Jesus revealed to Saint Faustina Kowalska. The Roman Catholic devotion and venerated image under this Christological title refers to the unlimited merciful love of God towards all people.Ann Ball, 2003 Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices page 175 There are a number of elements of this devotion, among which are: the devotional Divine Mercy image, the Chaplet of the Divine Mercy, and the observance of Divine Mercy Sunday. Pope John Paul II was instrumental in the formal establishment of the Divine Mercy devotion and acknowledged the efforts of the Marian Fathers in its promotion. Acts of reparation Reparation is a theological concept closely connected with those of atonement and satisfaction. In ascetical theology, reparation is the making of amends for insults given to God through sin, either one's own or another's. Some devotions have the form of acts of reparation for the sufferings and insults that Jesus endured during His Passion or for the sin of blasphemy. Pope John Paul II referred to Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ as the \\"unceasing effort to stand beside the endless crosses on which the Son of God continues to be crucified\\".Vatican archives https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/2000/documents/hf_jp- ii_let_20001021_riparatrici_en.html Pope Pius XI called these Acts of Reparation \\"some sort of compensation to be rendered for the injury\\" with respect to the sufferings of Jesus.

Halberstam & Richert write: Diamond & Halberstam attribute the terminology Fundamental Lemma to Jonas Kubilius. Common notation We use these notations: * A is a set of X positive integers, and Ad is its subset of integers divisible by d * w(d) and Rd are functions of A and of d that estimate the number of elements of A that are divisible by d, according to the formula : \\\\left\\\\vert A_d \\\\right\\\\vert = \\\\frac{w(d)}{d} X + R_d . :Thus w(d) / d represents an approximate density of members divisible by d, and Rd represents an error or remainder term. * P is a set of primes, and P(z) is the product of those primes ‚â§ z * S(A, P, z) is the number of elements of A not divisible by any prime in P that is ‚â§ z * Œ∫ is a constant, called the sifting density, that appears in the assumptions below. It is a weighted average of the number of residue classes sieved out by each prime. Fundamental lemma of the combinatorial sieve This formulation is from Tenenbaum. Other formulations are in Halberstam & Richert, in Greaves, and in Friedlander & Iwaniec. We make the assumptions: * w(d) is a multiplicative function. * The sifting density Œ∫ satisfies, for some constant C and any real numbers Œ∑ and Œæ with 2 ‚â§ Œ∑ ‚â§ Œæ: :\\\\prod_{\\\\eta \\\\le p \\\\le \\\\xi} \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{w(p)}{p} \\\\right) ^{-1} < \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\ln \\\\xi}{\\\\ln \\\\eta} \\\\right) ^\\\\kappa \\\\left( 1 + \\\\frac{C}{\\\\ln \\\\eta} \\\\right). There is a parameter u ‚â• 1 that is at our disposal. We have uniformly in A, X, z, and u that :S(a,P,z) = X \\\\prod_{p \\\\le z, p \\\\in P} \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{w(p)}{p} \\\\right) \\\\\\\\{1 + O(u^{-u/2})\\\\\\\\} + O\\\\left(\\\\sum_{d \\\\le z^u, dP(z)} R_d \\\\right). In applications we pick u to get the best error term. In the sieve it represents the number of levels of the inclusion‚Äìexclusion principle. Fundamental lemma of the Selberg sieve This formulation is from Halberstam & Richert. Another formulation is in Diamond & Halberstam. We make the assumptions: * w(d) is a multiplicative function. * The sifting density Œ∫ satisfies, for some constant C and any real numbers Œ∑ and Œæ with 2 ‚â§ Œ∑ ‚â§ Œæ: : \\\\sum_{\\\\eta \\\\le p \\\\le \\\\xi} \\\\frac{w(p) \\\\ln p}{p} < \\\\kappa \\\\ln \\\\frac{\\\\xi}{\\\\eta} + C. * w(p) / p < 1 - c for some small fixed c and all p *  Rd  ‚â§ œâ(d) where œâ(d) is the number of distinct prime divisors of d. The fundamental lemma has almost the same form as for the combinatorial sieve. Write u = ln X / ln z. The conclusion is: :S(a,P,z) = X \\\\prod_{p \\\\le z,\\\\ p \\\\in P} \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{w(p)}{p} \\\\right) \\\\\\\\{1 + O(e^{-u/2})\\\\\\\\}. Note that u is no longer an independent parameter at our disposal, but is controlled by the choice of z. Note that the error term here is weaker than for the fundamental lemma of the combinatorial sieve.

He spent his undergraduate junior year at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He holds an interdisciplinary Ph.D. in American Studies and Writing (Creative Non-fiction) from the Union Institute and University. Career In the Army, Uhl received training at the Infantry Officers School, Fort Benning, Georgia and the elite Counter Intelligence School, Fort Holabird, Maryland. He served in Vietnam during 1968-69 as a first lieutenant, where he led a combat intelligence team with the 11th Infantry Brigade. After Vietnam, Uhl entered a doctoral program in linguistics at New York University, and became immediately involved in the antiwar movement, joining the New York City based Citizens Commission of Inquiry on U.S. War Crimes in Vietnam (CCI) as a full-time organizer. He helped organize the National Veterans Inquiry and the Winter Soldier Investigation. In 1970, Uhl joined Ed Murphy in exposing the Phoenix Program, testified at the International Enquiry on US War Crimes in Stockholm, Sweden, and in 1971, he was called to testify before a US Congressional subcommittee investigating the CIA's Phoenix assassination program in Vietnam. Also in 1971 he toured Australia and New Zealand as a representative of the US anti-Vietnam War movement. That same year he co-founded The Safe Return Amnesty Committee advocating for a universal amnesty on behalf of Vietnam era military deserters. Safe Return was a predecessor of Citizen Soldier, which he also co- founded, and, until 1981, served as co-director, working on a wide range of campaigns advocating for GI and veteran rights. He co-authored the first book length treatment on the health effects of chemical herbicides (Agent Orange) on U.S. veterans of the Vietnam War. He is a Charter Member of Veterans for Peace founded in Maine (1985), where he moved with his family in the mid-1980s. He is currently serving on the Board of Directors of Veterans For Peace, and is editor of the organization's national newsletter. Uhl has worked primarily as a writer, and has taught often in universities and colleges in New York City and throughout Maine as Adjunct Professor of Writing. Publications Michael Uhl's essay, \\"The Chosen: Some Notes on Being a Veteran in American,\\" appears in Peace Not Terror. He is the author of Vietnam Awakening: My Journey from Combat to the Citizens Commission of Inquiry on US War Crimes, and co-author of G.I. Guinea Pigs: How the Pentagon Exposed Our Troops to Dangers Greater Than War. He is co-editor of The Dellums Committee Hearings on War Crimes in Vietnam. Uhl's poetry appears in the volumes Winning Hearts and Minds and Demilitarized Zones. As a travel writer he authored Exploring Maine on Country Roads and Byways and four Frommer's Guides, including Frommer's Brazil and Frommer's Chicago.

Originally defined by C. Miller Fisher as 'segmental arteriolar wall disorganisation', it is characterized by vessel wall thickening and a resultant reduction in luminal diameter. Fisher considered this small vessel disease to be the result of hypertension, induced in the acute stage by fibrinoid necrosis that would lead to occlusion and hence lacunar stroke. However, recent evidence suggests that endothelial dysfunction as a result of inflammation is a more likely cause for it. This may occur subsequent to blood‚Äìbrain barrier failure, and lead to extravasation of serum components into the brain that are potentially toxic. Lacunar infarction could thus occur in this way, and the narrowing ‚Äì the hallmark feature of lipohyalinosis ‚Äì may merely be a feature of the swelling occurring around it that squeezes on the structure. Misuse of the term C. Miller Fisher had decided to make lipohyalinosis a substitute term for fibrinoid necrosis. Fisher had done this because \\"of what he perceived to be the general agreement that the affected arteriolar segments also contained lipid\\".Rosenblum, William I. ‚ÄúFibrinoid Necrosis of Small Brain Arteries and Arterioles and Miliary Aneurysms as Causes of Hypertensive Hemorrhage: A Critical Reappraisal.‚Äù Acta Neuropathologica 116, no. 4 (October 2008): 361‚Äì69. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00401-008-0416-9. This has caused some issues with the usage of the term lipohyalinosis. \\"Because of its use by some earlier authors, Fisher included ‚Äúhyalinosis‚Äù in the list of synonyms that also included the term ‚Äúfibrinoid‚Äù\\". This means that people often associate hyalinosis and hyaline with lipohyalinosis and consider them the same thing. The misuse of the term lipohyalinosis also has meant that many cerebral vessel pathology have been incorrectly described as lipohyalinosis.Lammie, G Alistair. ‚ÄúPathology of Small Vessel Stroke.‚Äù British Medical Bulletin 56, no. 2 (2000): 296‚Äì306. This misuse of lipohyalinosis may cause issues for accurate diagnosis and therefore treatment of specific conditions if used incorrectly on a patient. Hypertension Hypertension is a strong risk factor. So-called deep-perforating arteries ‚Äì relatively small arteries branching off of relatively large arteries (most commonly the lenticulostriate arteries from the middle cerebral artery) ‚Äì are especially prone.Brenner D, Labreuche J, Pico F, et al. \\"The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in cerebral small vessel disease\\". J Neurol. May 2, 2000 Uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes are both risk factors for this condition. When Fisher observed the relationship between lacunar infarcts and lipohyalinosis, he also noted the relation to hypertension. It has been found that \\"The strong association between lipohyalinosis and hypertension documented by Fisher has been confirmed in several studies\\".Coca, Antonio, ed. Hypertension and Brain Damage. Updates in Hypertension and Cardiovascular Protection Ser. Cham: Springer, 2016. These studies have shown hypertension can cause lipohyalinosis because of the way hypertension changes blood vessels‚Äô structure. \\"Vascular remodelling of small and large vessels provoked by arterial hypertension is the initial step in the development of atherosclerosis and lipohyalinosis.\\"Droste, D. W., M. A. Ritter, R. Dittrich, S. Heidenreich, T. Wichter, M. Freund, and E. B. Ringelstein. ‚ÄúArterial Hypertension and Ischaemic Stroke.‚Äù Acta Neurologica Scandinavica 107, no. 4 (April 2003): 241‚Äì51. https://doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0404.2003.00098.x. More specifically, \\"Hypertension alters the structure of blood vessels by producing vascular hypertrophy and remodeling and by promoting atherosclerosis in large cerebral arteries and lipohyalinosis in penetrating arterioles\\".Aiyagari, Venkatesh, and Philip B. Gorelick, eds. Hypertension and Stroke: Pathophysiology and Management. 2nd ed. Clinical Hypertension and Vascular Diseases. Humana Press, 2016. Chronic hypertension even produces arteriolar changes like lipohyalinosis that makes the blood vessel very susceptible to rupture. The relationship between lipohyalinosis and hypertension is well documented and confirmed by various studies. It should also be noted that ‚ÄúIn the microscopic level of small arteries or arterioles, hypertension also generates specific vasculopathies such as lipohyalinosis and thus causing lacunar infarctions‚Äù. Hypertensions and lacunar infarcts and lacunar stroke are related. This means hypertension is a start to a chain reaction. From lipohyalinosis to lacunar infarctions that may eventually lead to stroke, hypertension, uncontrolled, can cause a lot of damage to the brain. Lacunar infarcts Lacunar infarcts are a result of atherosclerosis (microthrombi) and lipohyalinosis. These affect the deep structures of the brain and may leave small (~5mm) cavity lesions. Small lacunar infarcts are \\"caused by various arterial disorders, the most frequent of which include microatheroma, lipohyalinosis, fibrinoid necrosis, and Charcot-Bouchard aneurysm\\".Lastilla, Marcello. ‚ÄúLacunar Infarct.‚Äù Clinical & Experimental Hypertension 28, no. 3/4 (April 2006): 205‚Äì15. https://doi.org/10.1080/10641960600549082. Lipohyalinosis was considered the most common cause for lacunar infarcts. Fisher observed through autopsy studies that lacunar infarcts are caused by processes he described as segmental arterial disorganization, fibrinoid degeneration, and lipohyalinosis.Caplan, Louis R. ‚ÄúLacunar Infarction and Small Vessel Disease: Pathology and Pathophysiology.‚Äù Journal of Stroke 17, no. 1 (January 2015): 2‚Äì6. https://doi.org/10.5853/jos.2015.17.1.2. Fisher's work in this area has been invaluable, but in more recent research into this area with new technology has brought up questions if lipohyalinosis is really the main cause of lacunar infarcts or lacunar stroke. Some new research now suggests that microatheroma may now be considered the main cause in that it is \\"now thought to be the most common mechanism of small vessel occlusion...\\" These new findings have to be looked into more closely to determine if microatheroma is the main cause of lacunar infarcts or lacunar stroke or if Fisher's work still stands as it has for many years that lipohyalinosis is one of the main causes. Cognitive decline In a study done in 2003, researchers had found that their ‚Äúdata indicate that widespread small vessel lesions due to both [cerebral amyloid angiopathy] and [arteriosclerosis/lipohyalinosis] may play a critical role in the development of [Alzheimer disease]‚Äù.Thal, Dietmar Rudolf, Estifanos Ghebremedhin, Mario Orantes, and Otmar D. Wiestler. ‚ÄúVascular Pathology in Alzheimer Disease: Correlation of Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy and Arteriosclerosis/Lipohyalinosis with Cognitive Decline.‚Äù Journal of Neuropathology & Experimental Neurology 62, no. 12 (December 1, 2003): 1287‚Äì1301. https://doi.org/10.1093/jnen/62.12.1287. This means lipohyalinosis may be a huge factor in Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline in general. There have also been other studies that link cerebral small vessel diseases to cognitive decline and lipohyalinosis being a cerebral small vessel disease, is included in those as well. Cerebral small vessel disease is a major cause of cognitive decline in the older populations.Baker, John G., Amy J. Williams, Catalina C. Ionita, Peterkin Lee-Kwen, Marilou Ching, and Robert S. Miletich. ‚ÄúCerebral Small Vessel Disease: Cognition, Mood, Daily Functioning, and Imaging Findings from a Small Pilot Sample.‚Äù Dementia and Geriatric Cognitive Disorders EXTRA 2, no. 1 (April 18, 2012): 169‚Äì79. https://doi.org/10.1159/000333482.√òstergaard, Leif, Thorbj√∏rn S Engedal, Fiona Moreton, Mikkel B Hansen, Joanna M Wardlaw, Turgay Dalkara, Hugh S Markus, and Keith W Muir. ‚ÄúCerebral Small Vessel Disease: Capillary Pathways to Stroke and Cognitive Decline.‚Äù Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism 36, no. 2 (February 2016): 302‚Äì25. https://doi.org/10.1177/0271678X15606723. The results from a small pilot study had found that \\"Participants showed some decreases in executive functioning, attention, processing speed, and memory retrieval, consistent with previous literature\\" and that \\"Performance on a computer- administered cognitive measure showed a slight overall decline over a period of 8‚Äì28 months\\". Cerebral small vessel disease has caused, even if it is slight, a decline in cognition and has in this study and other studies like it. Other There are many other conditions and diseases that are related to lipohyalinosis. Below are the names of a few that are related to it and what they are.

Along with NST, European Study Tours and StudyLink it is a part of the HB Education group, owned by Midlothian Capital Partners Although children often refer to us as 'Parents Get Lost', the company actually is named after its founder, Peter Gordon Lawrence.  Overview  PGL Travel Ltd. was established in 1957 as ‚ÄòPGL Voyages‚Äô and is a provider of school activity courses and adventure holidays for children. In the 1960s and early 1970s the ‚ÄòPGL Experience' was aimed at young adults and based on three main activities - canoeing, sailing and pony trekking, with accommodation in tents. PGL moved into the school and group travel market and during the 1980s expanded, purchasing more properties, ranging from a mansion house in Perthshire to a converted farm in Oxfordshire. PGL opened a headquarters in the South of France and became one of the first UK organisers of canoeing holidays in the Ard√®che Gorge. In the early 90s the acquisition by the company of the former Quest Outdoor Adventure programme as well as the purchase of a number of centres operated by competitors, resulted in a considerable expansion in the schools‚Äô adventure market in the UK and France. In 1993 the company also entered the school ski market with the acquisition of Ski Europe and Ski Wessex. In 2000, PGL purchased Ch√¢teau de Grande Romaine, a 300-bed former hotel and grounds on the eastern outskirts of Paris. This was followed by the acquisition in 2005 of its competitor 3D Education and Adventure with its three centres on the South Coast of England as well as a contract with Pontins to provide children's activities on their sites. Pontins went into administration in 2010 and was subsequently purchased by the Britannia Hotels Group in 2011 and the contract between Pontins and PGL ceased to be. The company was sold in 2007 to Holidaybreak Plc and formed the first part of the Holidaybreak 'Education Division'. Significant property acquisitions in the UK in recent years have included Caythorpe Court, near Grantham in 2004 and in 2009, Liddington in Wiltshire. In July 2011, Holidaybreak was purchased by Cox & Kings Limited, based in India and then in 2014 PGL opened an office in Melbourne Australia and acquired two centres in Victoria and one in Queensland, Campaspe Downs, Camp Rumbug and Kindilan. In 2017, PGL sought to acquire two new centres - Newby Wiske Hall - formerly North Yorkshire Police Headquarters and Bawdsey Manor on the Suffolk Heritage Coast The purchase of Newby Wiske Hall is still 'subject to contract' due to PGL's applications for planning consent for change of use and listed building consent for the site being referred for Judicial Review in January 2018. PGL's largest area of business continues to be school trips and educational travel. These range from activity and adventure trips to subject focussed trips (Science, ICT, Maths, Field Studies and French Language courses). During the UK school terms PGL mainly offers school and youth group holidays, as well as birthday parties and day trips. Outside of the UK school terms, PGL also offers family and child-only adventure holidays (summer camps).  Centres  PGL operates a number of centres in the UK, including: Devon * Barton Hall, Torquay * Beam House, Great Torrington Dorset * Osmington Bay, Weymouth East Sussex * Windmill Hill, Hailsham Herefordshire * Hillcrest, Foy/Ross-on-Wye Isle of Wight * Little Canada, Ryde Lancashire * Winmarleigh Hall, Warrington Lincolnshire * Caythorpe Court, Grantham Northallerton * Newby Wiske Hall Purchase of these premises has not been completed nor has a contract to purchase been exchanged.

Brown and First National Realty, opening on October 17, 1963. It was originally composed of a massive S. Klein department store separated by a large parking lot from an A&P; Supermarket located in a strip shopping center along with a barbershop, single screen movie theater, and Drug Fair store. By 1972-73, a small indoor mall was created, situated between the strip shopping center and the S. Klein store, that included a 6-screen theater, steakhouse (Emerson's Steakhouse), a branch of George's appliance store chain, an ice cream shop, and in-house catalog store. Within a few years of the S. Klein closing in 1975, the mall underwent major renovations. In the course of renovations, the space occupied by S. Klein was split up to create new spaces for different stores. Small fountains were added. The renovations included an additional 8 screen cinema and a Giant supermarket that was added to one wing of the former shopping strip.\\"New Paint, More Space for Area Malls,\\" by Alison O'Neill, The Washington Post, Oct 18, 1982, p. W1. The renovation also enclosed the area from the original mall to the supermarket. The mall has 115 stores and restaurants and anchors include a Giant supermarket, Burlington Coat Factory, Marshalls, JoAnn Fabrics, Target, Shoppers World, and TJ Maxx (opened May 2014). (Shoppers World and the former Big Lots replaced a space formerly occupied by Value City until 2010.) The Target cannot be reached from the mall without going outdoors, though it shares a common roof. History On July 15, 1962, The Washington Post and Times Herald published a sketch of the department store of the S. Klein chain, to be constructed in the Beltway Plaza Regional Shopping Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. At the time the two- story and basement structure would be the largest Washington suburban department store and was expected to open the following Easter. Maryland Governor J. Millard Tawes witnessed the signing of the 30-year lease (the store would last only 13) between the plaza developer and S. Klein. The store opened on Oct 17, 1963.\\"S. Klein Opens First Store in D.C. Area,\\" Washington Post and Times Herald, Oct 18, 1963, p. D6. The Beltway Plaza property is home to some perilous slopes that have periodically given way. During construction of the store, in December 1962, five men died and 11 were injured in a basement earth slide and the mall was forced to close for a short period in 1966.\\"County Moves to Close Store Periled by Slope,\\" The Washington Post and Times Herald, Apr 1, 1966, p.

He is known for his strange and enigmatic sculptures that draw the viewer's perceptual judgments into question in jarring and unexpected ways. Christopher Knight in the Los Angeles Times wrote that Ray's \\"career as an artist‚Ä¶is easily among the most important of the last twenty years.\\"Christopher Knight, \\"Charles Ray's Hinoki: A Wooden Record of Life,\\" Los Angeles Times, May 11, 2007. Early life and education Charles Ray was born in Chicago as the son of Helen and Wade Ray. His parents owned and ran a commercial-art school which his grandmother had founded in 1916. He was the second oldest in his family and has four brothers and a sister. The family moved to Winnetka in 1960. Charles and his older brother, Peter, attended high school at the Catholic Marmion Military Academy in Aurora, Illinois, where there father had gone. On Saturdays he went to the Art Institute's studio program for high-school students. He earned his BFA at the University of Iowa and his MFA from Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University. Charles Ray, Ink Box, 1986, steel, ink, automobile paint, 36 x 36 x 36 inches He studied sculpture at the University of Iowa School of Art and Art History with Roland Brener, who exposed Ray to many of developments of Modernist sculpture, in particular the constructivist aesthetic of artists like Anthony Caro and David Smith. He later studied with Stephen Zaima, where Ray executed many of his performance pieces in the undergraduate studio like the Plank Piece. \\"Caro's work was like a template; I saw it as almost platonic. The formal rules as taught by Brener were a kind of nourishment for me. The actual working in the studio was, in a sense, the expression. I was taught that the finished sculpture was maybe the end of the paragraph. Once a sculpture was completed it was critiqued and put back on to the scrap pile. This way of working taught me to think sculpturally rather than to think about sculpture. At this time in my life the historical context of high Modernism was really beyond my grasp. I saw Caro as super- contemporary. His work was, and is, so alive. It bridges the gap between the inside and outside of my mind.\\"Charles Ray and Michael Fried, \\"Early one Morning‚Ä¶,\\" Tate Etc., Spring 2005, 5 Ray moved to California in 1981 where he headed the sculpture department at UCLA since.Charles Ray / MATRIX 140, November 1, 1990 - December 20, 1990 Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley. Work Ray's work is difficult to classify. Style, materials, subject, presence, and scale are all variable. Critic Anne Wagner finds the consistent quality to be this: \\"In all his seamlessly executed objects, Ray fixates on how and why things happen, to say nothing of wondering what really does happen in the field of vision, and how such events might be remade as art.\\"Anne Wagner, \\"Charles Ray: Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles,\\" Artforum, May 1999, 171. This and the level of art historical awareness behind his works has led many critics to call Ray a sculptor's sculptor. Nevertheless, his art has managed to find a large audience, thanks in part to its often striking or beguiling nature. Ray recapitulated many of the developments in twentieth-century sculpture in his first show in 1971 with an installation entitled One-Stop Gallery. The show consisted of a collection of small sculptures, resting directly on floor. Some of the works, in their attention to materials, were clearly inspired by minimalist artists like Robert Morris, while two small constructed steel sculptures invoke the traditions taught by his teacher, Brener; they were even painted the same red as Caro's Early One Morning (1962, Tate Modern). One-Stop Gallery would anticipate the tone for much of Ray's work to come in its plumbing and reinterpreting of the canon of twentieth-century sculpture without having his own work appeal to any particular period or style. Initially influenced by Caro, by including his own body in his works he made them more like documented performances. In the two-part photographic work Plank Piece I‚ÄìII (1973), for example, he pinned his body to the wall with a large piece of wood.Charles Ray Tate Collection, London. In the late 1980s, Ray conceived minimalist works using ink and wire. In Ink Box (1986), a large cube is filled to the brim with ink, giving the illusion of a solid cube. Ink Line (1987) is a continuous stream of black ink traveling from a dime-size opening in the ceiling into a similar hole in the floor. In Spinning Spot (1987), a section of the floor measuring 24 inches in diameter is set spinning at 33 RPM. Consisting of a single 8.5 foot length of wire, both ends of Moving Wire (1988) protrude from the wall and are set 14 inches apart; as one end of the wire extends out from the wall at random intervals, the other retracts.Charles Ray: Ink Line, Moving Wire, Spinning Spot, May 8 - July 10, 2009 Matthew Marks Gallery, New York. Charles Ray, Family Romance, 1993, painted fiberglass and synthetic hair, 53 x 85 x 11 inches For Unpainted Sculpture (1997), over the course of two years, Ray reconstructed a life-sized crashed Pontiac Grand Am (circa 1991) out of fiberglass, casting and assembling each piece to match the bent and twisted forms of the original CHARLES RAY: \\"UNPAINTED SCULPTURE,\\" 1997, October 18 - November 29, 1997 Regen Projects, Los Angeles. Despite the work's title, it is painted a soft dove grey that is reminiscent of the plastic parts of model car kits.Michael Darling, Charles Ray Frieze, Issue 39, March‚ÄìApril 1998. His most labor-intensive work to date is the ten-year re-creation in Japanese cypress (Hinoki) of a fallen and rotting tree he had found in a meadow. With Hinoki (2007, Art Institute of Chicago), Ray had a mold made of a large rotting tree he found in California. He then hired a team of Japanese woodcarvers in Osaka to essentially re-carve the tree in Hinoki, a different wood than that of the original tree. In an interview with Michael Fried, Ray made it clear that the purpose of the piece was not to photorealistically carve an exact replica of the tree. \\"The tree had that beautiful interior that fallen logs have,\\" he says. \\"It happens when bugs eat out the hard wood, so you have this hollow thing. All I knew was that I wanted to carve that, I wanted them to have a sense of that interior [of the log] because it's in there, even if normally it couldn't be seen. So that was really important. And then I became involved with the outside as well‚Ä¶It mattered to me that somebody had looked at it, and I wanted to make it matter to you.\\"Michael Fried, and Charles Ray, \\"Conversation\\" in Charles Ray by the Matthew Marks Gallery Ray's critically acclaimed Firetruck (1993), a full-size aluminum, fiberglass and Plexiglas installation, has been exhibited on Madison Avenue in New York, in front of the Whitney Museum of American Art.

The sculpture called to mind the Apollo Sauroktonos, an ancient Roman sculpture at the Mus√©e du Louvre in Paris of a nude adolescent reaching out his arm to catch a lizard climbing a tree; and, the Boy with Thorn (Lo Spinario), a bronze statue at the Palazzo dei Conservatori, Musei Capitolini, of a seated Roman boy plucking a thorn from the sole of his foot.J.

He was also one of the earliest (and latest surviving) wartime members of the BBC Radio Drama Repertory Company, formed to meet the circumstances of World War II.  Biography  Robert Marsden was born in West Hampstead, London. His theatre training was at LAMDA, the London Mask Theatre School, RADA, and the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art. He made his professional debut in Warrington, Lancashire (now Cheshire) in 1939. In Stratford-on-Avon, aged nineteen, he played a round of Shakespearean roles, including Tybalt in Romeo & Juliet, Hotspur in Richard II and Tranio in The Taming of the Shrew. He first broadcast in 1942, and played a variety of parts, including Robert in The Letter, Chorus to Laurence Olivier's Henry V and the disciple Philip in Dorothy L. Sayers' play cycle on Jesus The Man Born to Be King. In London, he was in John Drinkwater's Abraham Lincoln both at the Westminster in 1940 and at the Playhouse in 1943. At the Arts he played leading parts in The Rivals, The Constant Couple etc. In 1944 he appeared at the Chanticleer Theatre in such plays as The Lady From the Sea and as the title character in John Gabriel Borkman. The following year he was approached by John Gielgud about Rodney Ackland's adaptation of Crime and Punishment, and he played the leading character's friend with Gielgud, Edith Evans and Peter Ustinov at the New Theatre, and elsewhere. Gielgud also cast him in Medea at the Globe Theatre. Marsden's next broadcast was as Young Marlow in She Stoops To Conquer, playing opposite Angela Baddeley. He continued to freelance in radio, his roles including the title part in Macbeth, Orsino in Twelfth Night, Tybalt (as at Stratford) and the King in Love's Labour's Lost. He was a fine pianist, and accompanied his own singing, on the air and later in recitations. He composed revue material and comic songs, such as a witty setting of Carroll's Jabberwocky. On radio in the mid-fifties he played the title role in the series Mike Dudley, Charter Pilot. He was also a regular in the Bunkle series with Billie Whitelaw, and he acted in In Parenthesis with Dylan Thomas. He also appeared on television, parts ranging from Antonio in The Tempest, to the sinister Black Dog in Treasure Island with Bernard Miles. In Fry's The Boy with a Cart, he played one of the brothers in the West End with Richard Burton, and a different one on TV. In 1956 at the Phoenix he was in Peter Brook's production of The Power & the Glory with Paul Scofield (with whom he had trained). His career as a director began at Whitby, and included Guildford (where he directed Philip Bond in Richard II) and Coventry. At Preston he played Othello and co-directed it. He also worked with Joan Littlewood at Stratford East. In 1959 he 'did the hat-trick' with Abraham Lincoln, playing the name character at the Belgrade, Coventry. At the Belgrade he also played Shylock in The Merchant of Venice and Brutus in Julius Caesar. Brutus's boy servant Lucius was played by Michael Crawford. On television, he played Lincoln in the first episode of the Doctor Who serial The Chase, reciting about half of the Gettysburg Address. The episode was directed by Richard Martin who had been in the cast of the Drinkwater play with him at the Belgrade. At Birmingham Rep in 1961 Marsden was Enobarbus in Antony & Cleopatra. He also performed at Hampstead Theatre in its early days, playing in He Who Gets Slapped. He started to vary his acting with work as a drama teacher, at RADA, Central School and the City Lit, as well as privately. He also gave solo recitations, which were both dramatic and musical. In 1965, Robert Marsden rejoined the Stratford-based Shakespeare company, now called the Royal Shakespeare Company. He had played the major role of the Chorus in Henry V on radio to Laurence Olivier as Henry, and now he succeeded Eric Porter in the part at the Aldwych Theatre in London, with Ian Holm as the King. A review recorded \\"Chorus stands four-square in the Elizabethan age, an imposing amalgam of Drake and Raleigh as presented by Robert Marsden.\\" \\"The Stage\\" June 3 1965 While with the RSC, he was in the earliest of their Theatre-Go-Round outreach programmes for school pupils, and he played Boretzki in Peter Weiss's disturbing compilation from the concentration camp hearings,The Investigation. Performed at the Aldwych, it was audio recorded by the BBC and broadcast more than once. After this, though he appeared both live and on television again, he did not work much as an actor. Having lost the sight of one eye in an accident in his youth, he developed glaucoma, and lost much of his sight in his forties. One of his latest personal appearances was at a verse recital performing alongside Dame Peggy Ashcroft and Jeremy Brett. For many years he continued as a private drama teacher, specialising in coaching intense voice work. He lived with and was then married to Sally, n√©e Brice (1951‚Äì2012). They divorced, but remained friends. Marsden died on at Elstree, Hertfordshire.

New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 24 March 2020 Dean said his first Mass 9 January and left for England 25 January 1582. He was probably being tracked the whole time and was arrested 21 February and sent to Newgate prison and subjected to torture. In April 1584 he was moved to The Clink. He was banished with a number of other priests in early 1585, put ashore on the coast of Normandy, and threatened with death if he dared to go back to England. Nevertheless, in November he returned to his mission work there and was again arrested and confined to Gatehouse Prison. He was tried, and condemned for his priesthood on 22 August 1588. The failure of the Spanish Armada brought about a fierce anti-Catholic persecution and some twenty-seven Catholics were executed that year. Six new gibbets were erected in London, it is said at the Earl of Leicester's instigation, and Dean, who had been condemned with five other priests and four laymen, was the first to suffer on the gallows erected at Mile End. With him died a layman, Henry Webley, for relieving and assisting him. At his execution Dean tried to speak to the people, but he was struck on the head and gagged. Henry Webley Henry Webley was born in Gloucester around 1558. From there he went to London, where he assisted William Dean during the priest's brief mission in the city. By 1586, the ports were being closely watched by both government officials and government spies. In April of that year, Webley was seized onboard a ship at Chichester bound for France and sent to the Marshalsea, where he remained for two years. His crimes included being reconciled to the Catholic religion, making his confession to Fr. Dean, and aiding and assisting the priest. His trial was held in the latter part of August 1588 at the Old Bailey, but appears to have been merely a formality since those sent for trial were those selected for execution. Webley was hanged, along with Dean, at Mile End Green on 28 August 1588.

Background and composition Bandleader Jeff Mangum wrote the song almost instantaneously while staying in Athens, Georgia with fellow Elephant 6 musicians. The song was written soon after Mangum became romantically involved with Laura Carter. While sitting in the yard of their Athens home, Mangum suddenly announced, \\"I got a song in my head!\\" and ran inside the house to play the song for the first time. The song makes a brief reference to Anne Frank, who is alluded to throughout the album. It is about a young man who realizes that one day he is going to die, and accepts the idea. \\"In the Aeroplane Over the Sea\\" is one of the more uplifting songs on the album despite having death as the subject material. Stewart Mason of AllMusic writes, \\"'In the Aeroplane Over the Sea' is almost giddy at the thought of eternal rest: 'When we meet on a cloud, I'll be laughing out loud' probably isn't the average train of thought of kid barely in his mid-20s, but it certainly beats one of Kurt Cobain's howls of existential despair.\\" The song opens with double-tracked acoustic guitars, whose \\"chords are full and serene in contrast to the percussive, bare triads\\" of King of Carrot Flowers, according to Medium's Joel Settlemoir. Mangum's vocals are accompanied by acoustic guitars, a singing saw played by Julian Koster, Scott Spillane's saxophone, and minimal percussion. The song is in the key of G major, and for the most part follows a simple I-vi-IV-V chord progression. It is in the 6/8 time signature and has a A A B1 A B2 A form.

He is best known for his discovery of the mineral ytterbite (later called gadolinite) in 1787. The discovery of ytterbite was the first step in identifying an entire group of previously unknown elements, the rare earths. Eight stable rare earth elements were eventually extracted from ytterbite: terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, and yttrium. Early life Arrhenius was born in Stockholm on 29 March 1757 to Jakob Larsson Arrhenius and Brita Sofia Georgii. In 1796 he married Gustafva von Bilang. Career Arrhenius became a lieutenant of the Svea Artillery Regiment of the Swedish army, the regiment being stationed in Vaxholm. As an artillery officer, Arrhenius was assigned to study the characteristics of gunpowder at the Swedish Royal Mint's (Kungliga Myntet) laboratory. Being taught to test gunpowder by Bengt Reinhold Geijer and Peter Jacob Hjelm at the Royal Mint sparked his interest in chemistry and mineralogy, and this experience served as the beginning of his chemical studies. During this time, in 1787, he discovered the mineral ytterbite (later renamed gadolinite). In 1787 Arrhenius accompanied Carl Bernhard Wadstr√∂m and Anders Sparrman on a visit for scientific investigations in Senegal. Returning from Senegal in 1787‚Äì1788, Arrhenius met French chemist Antoine Lavoisier during a layover in Paris, France. He became an ardent proponent in Sweden of Lavoisier's new theories of oxygenation and combustion. Lavoisier extensively researched combustion, including that of gunpowder, leading to significant improvements of the quality of this explosive. This advance was of natural interest to Arrhenius. Arrhenius then took part in the campaign against Russia in 1788, in which he distinguished himself militarily. He was promoted to major in 1801, and later to Feldzeugmeister. He was put in command of the manufacture and inspection of gunpowder for the Swedish army in 1816. Arrhenius became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences in 1799, and of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1817. He regretted that he had to spend most of his time in \\"the occupations of practical life\\" and could not devote himself to studying chemistry. In 1816-1817, then more than sixty years of age, Arrhenius attended the classes of chemist J√∂ns Jacob Berzelius, continuing his studies of chemistry. Carl Axel Arrhenius died on 20 November 1824. Ytterbite A sample of ytterbite (later named gadolinite) from Vaxholm During his time as a lieutenant in Vaxholm, Arrhenius visited the feldspar mine in the village of Ytterby on the island of Resar√∂n. During this visit, in 1787, he found an unusually heavy dark mineral. The mineral's first description was published by Bengt Reinhold Geijer in Crell's Annalen in 1788, where he credited Arrhenius with the discovery of a \\"Schwerstein\\" or \\"heavy rock\\". The mineral was eventually sent to the chemist Johan Gadolin at the University of √Öbo for suitable analysis. In 1794, after careful chemical analysis, Gadolin reported that approximately 38% of the sample was a previously unknown \\"earth\\". (The idea of chemical element was not yet established.) The compound that Gadolin isolated, the first rare-earth metal compound, is now known as Yttrium(III) oxide. It is composed of the first known rare-earth element, yttrium. Examining a different sample, Anders Gustaf Ekeberg confirmed the existence of a new \\"earth\\", calling it \\"yttria\\" and the source mineral \\"ytterbite\\". The mineral that Arrhenius discovered and Gadolin and Ekeberg analyzed was eventually renamed gadolinite in 1800. The rare-earths are chemically very similar to each other, almost always occur together in minerals on earth and are rarely found in isolation from other rare-earth elements. Their similarity and co-existence made their initial identification difficult. The discovery of ytterbite was the first step in a long process of investigations by many scientists in different countries. The identification of new \\"earths\\" extended over 100 years, and eventually led to the understanding of elements and their relationships in the periodic system. Ytterbite was eventually found to contain eight stable rare earth elements (terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, and yttrium). Most of the remaining rare earths were found in the mineral cerite, which contains seven rare earth elements (cerium, lanthanum, praseodymium, neodymium, samarium, europium, and gadolinium).

The game is currently out of print. Gameplay Game play combined management of a medieval dynasty (with rules for character creation, and centred on the creation of treaties through arranged marriages) with territorial expansion and financial reward. The winner was the player who ultimately made the most money; the other games mechanisms provided means and obstacles to this end. As with the Games Workshop edition of Warrior Knights, the components were of a high quality and the mechanisms were innovative for their day; the designer was a well known name; the dynastic rules in particular provided a high degree of involvement for players. Criticisms of the game have centred on the length of time it may take to play. Publication history However the game was published near the end of the time when Games Workshop was interested in publishing board games outside what would become its core milieu of Warhammer and Warhammer 40,000, and it was quickly withdrawn. In 2005 Fantasy Flight Games acquired its rights with others old GW titles like Warrior Knights, Talisman, Fury of Dracula, etc. but after more than two years the planning for a new edition of Blood Royale was suspended for unknown problems which are probably related to the difficulty in shortening the game‚Äôs extremely long playtime.

Troxipide is a systemic non-antisecretory gastric cytoprotective agent with anti-ulcer, anti-inflammatory and mucus secreting properties irrespective of pH of stomach or duodenum. Troxipide is currently marketed in Japan (Aplace),Aplace tablets, Kyorin Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Japan China (Shuqi),Shuqi tablets, Zhongzhu Holding Co., Ltd., China South Korea (Defensa),Defensa tablets, Il Hwa, Korea and India (Troxip).Troxip tablets, Zuventus Healthcare Ltd., India It is used for the management of gastric ulcers, and amelioration of gastric mucosal lesions in acute gastritis and acute exacerbation of chronic gastritis.  Mechanism of action  The gastric pH and content independent properties of troxipide include the following:  Gastric mucosal protection  Gastric mucosa typically is composed of salts and other dialyzable components, free proteins, carbohydrate rich glycoprotein and water. Troxipide fortifies this gastric mucosal barrier by increasing the content of glucosamine, mucopolysaccharides and collagen.Prescribing information of APLACE (Troxipide). 2008. Kyorin Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Japan Glucosamine is an amino-sugar that is known to stimulate glycoprotein synthesis and protective mechanisms of the gastric mucosa, thereby aiding in ulcer healing. Mucopolysaccharides impart structural integrity to the gastric mucosa and collagen imparts properties like ionic capability to attract blood components essential to tissue regeneration, mechanical protection, high tensile strength and slow digestibility to the gastric mucosa.  Stimulation of cytoprotective prostaglandins  Almost all of the gastric mucosal defense mechanisms are stimulated and/or facilitated by prostaglandins (PGs), especially PGE2. These cytoprotective PGs stimulate mucus, bicarbonate, and phospholipid secretion; increase mucosal blood flow; and accelerate epithelial restitution and mucosal healing. They also inhibit mast cell activation, and leukocyte and platelet adherence to the vascular endothelium. Thus, continuous generation of PGE2 by gastric mucosa is crucial for the maintenance of mucosal integrity and protection against ulcerogenic and necrotizing agents. Troxipide is known to stimulate the release of PGE2 and PGD2 in experimental as well as clinical studies. Troxipide has been observed to enhance PG-stimulated increase in gastric mucosal output, accelerated epithelial restitution and mucosal healing.  Suppression of gastric inflammation  Gastric inflammation is a highly complex biochemical protective response to cellular injury. In the multitude of mechanisms involved in the development of gastric mucosal inflammation, derangement of the microcirculatory system is a common initial pathway. Troxipide inhibits various proinflammatory mediators present at different stages of the microcirculatory system, thereby restoring the normal gastric mucosa. Troxipide caused the inhibition of recombinant interleukin-8 (IL-8) induced migration of the inflammatory cells. Two other pro-inflammatory mediators causing oxidative stress that are inhibited by Troxipide include the formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) and the Platelet Activating Factor (PAF). In addition to inhibition of pro- inflammatory mediators, troxipide directly acts on the enzymes such as xanthine oxidase and myeloperoxidase that generate free oxygen radicals in gastric mucosa. Experimental studies have demonstrated that troxipide restrains NSAID-induced generation of porphyrins, tissue peroxidation and gastric lesion formation.  Enhancement of mucosal metabolism  Gastric parietal cells are rich in mitochondria which provide energy in the form of ATP for cells by oxidative phosphorylation, critical to maintain the proper morphology and function of gastric mucosa. The mitochondrion is the major target of intracellular oxidative stress associated with aggressive factors like H. pylori, alcohol and NSAIDs, which disturb the energy metabolism of mitochondria. Troxipide accelerates oxygen intake of marginal gastric mucosa and glycogen consumptive stimulation of the gastric mucosa of the corpus, thereby elevating the tissue respiration and energy metabolism.  Stimulation of mucosal microcirculation  Troxipide enhances mucosal blood flow, which is the secondary defense barrier of gastric mucosa that supplies nutrients and oxygen to the epithelium, and removes, dilutes and neutralizes toxic substances that have diffused into the mucosa from the lumen. The increment in mucosal blood flow with troxipide is more pronounced in the gastric antrum than in the gastric corpus.  Anti-Helicobacter pylori action  Troxipide inhibits H. pylori-derived urease, a multimeric nickel- containing enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of urea to yield ammonia and carbonic acid, which damage host tissues and trigger inflammatory response, including recruitment of leukocytes and triggering of the oxidative burst in neutrophils.  Pharmacokinetics  Troxipide is well absorbed throughout the gastrointestinal tract with a relative bioavailability of 99.6%. At any time, a mean concentration of 5.3- 8.9 Œºg of troxipide is present per gram of tissue, which is capable of inhibiting the chemotactic migration and superoxide generation in the gastric mucosa. Thus, even 3 hrs after attaining peak serum levels, troxipide is found in therapeutically active concentrations in the small intestine, liver and stomach. The elimination half-life of troxipide is 7.5 hours, and is mainly excreted in urine (96% as metabolites).  Clinical experience  Troxipide has been well established in the treatment of gastric ulcers showing an overall amelioration rate of 79.4%. An overall endoscopic healing rate of 66.7% after 8 weeks and 80% after 12 weeks of drug administration was achieved with troxipide (100 mg t.i.d. (three times a day)). In patients with duodenal ulcers, troxipide showed endoscopic healing rate of 53.3% and 73% at 8 weeks and 12 weeks respectively. At the end of the treatment, an overall improvement of 86.6% and 93.3% was achieved in patients with gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer respectively. In patients with acute gastritis and acute gastric mucosal lesions, an overall amelioration rate of 82.9% has been observed with troxipide. In a comparative study evaluating the efficacy of troxipide (100 mg t.i.d.) with Ranitidine (150 mg b.i.d. (two times a day)), administered over 28 days in patients with gastritis, troxipide was statistically superior to Ranitidine, both with respect to resolution of gastritis clinical signs (abdominal pain, bloating, belching and heartburn) as well as the endoscopic evidences (erosion, oozing, redness and edema). A study comparing the efficacy of troxipide (100 mg t.i.d for 28 days) with Rabeprazole (20 mg o.d. for 28 days) in patients suffering from gastritis showed that improvement in abdominal pain and nausea was significantly superior with troxipide at the end of 14 days. Troxipide administration caused a marked reduction in clinical (abdominal pain, bloating, belching, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and heartburn) and endoscopic signs of gastritis by the end of the treatment, though it did not significantly differ from that of Rabeprazole.A Parallel, Randomized, Comparative, Double-Blind, Double-Dummy Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Troxipide versus Rabeprazole in the Treatment of Gastritis.

Data on file (appears on zuventus healthcare website www.zuventus.co.in).  Safety and tolerability  A post-marketing study, conducted by the innovator, in over 12,000 patients showed that only 0.75% of them developed adverse events attributable to the drug. The adverse reactions were mild to moderate, which resolved when the drug was discontinued. Commonly observed adverse events included constipation (0.19%) and increase in levels of liver enzymes, AST (0.17%) and ALT (0.25%). In a post-marketing study conducted in 1500 Indian patients, only 9 adverse events were reported in 9 patients (0.63%) that were of mild to moderate intensity. Adverse events observed included constipation, acidity, nausea, fatigue and headache, and were of mild to moderate intensity. In all clinical studies, troxipide was well tolerated. In a comparative study with ranitidine, troxipide was assessed as a more tolerable medication than ranitidine. A favorable tolerability profile for troxipide was reported by 95.45% of the investigators as compared to 65.45% for ranitidine while favorable tolerability profile was reported by 93.67% of the patients for troxipide and 64.55% for ranitidine.

History ANC was founded in 1997 by Jerry Cifarelli, current CEO, and Alan N. Cohen, former co-owner of the Boston Celtics. ANC acquired exclusive North American rights to Space & Time rotational signage technology in 1997 and in its first year of operations, entered into an agreement with the WNBA to provide each team with all of its rotational signage. The following year, the Company added 19 new clients who would utilize courtside and back-lit fascia rotational signage. Today, ANC partners with more than 200 teams and venues in professional and collegiate sports. ANC formed a technology division, ANC Technologies, in 1999. ANC Technologies developed FasciaSOFT, an operating engine for LED systems, permitting the company to debut the first 360¬∞ LED fascia signage in the National Hockey League. That same year, ANC Marketing was created to provide consulting services and assist clients with marketing strategies. ANC Marketing also helped grow sponsorship revenue streams by executing programs based on each individual client's business. ANC Design was added in 2001 to create custom LED graphics and animations as well as meet its clients‚Äô graphic needs created by their new LED fascia systems. ANC directed LED installations and was selected to provide ongoing operational services for digital fascia and scoreboard signage at venues such as Cleveland's Quicken Loans Arena, Minnesota's Target Center, Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center and Toronto's Air Canada Centre from 2002 through 2006. During this time, ANC Marketing expanded into a national advertising sales division, including creating the basket stanchion arm advertising position.New York Times During the same period, ANC debuted a new LED operating software called VisionSOFT. VisionSOFT is the first 3D interface capable of controlling multiple displays through one console, and also capable of distributing uncompressed video to its displays, eliminating distortion. The VisionSOFT application also operates DLP Digital Courtside press tables, which during the 2005-06 season became the first courtside digital signage to be approved for an NBA event. Shortly after introducing digital courtside press tables, ANC expanded ANC Marketing into a national advertising sales division and formed a manufacturing relationship with Mitsubishi Electric. Following its new relationship with Mitsubishi, the company has completed large LED signage projects such as the Washington Nationals‚Äô new ballpark, Washington D.C.‚Äôs Verizon Center and Portland's Rose Garden.

Chaired by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Chairman of the Abu Dhabi Executive Council, the Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council is responsible for defining the shape of the Emirate, along with the associated land uses, to ensure the development of a professionally designed, sustainable and well-managed urban environment, which incorporate world-class transport and infrastructure systems and support the implementation of Economic Vision 2030 and Environment Vision 2030. Abu Dhabi Quality and Conformity Council (ADQCC) and Abu Dhabi Agriculture & Food Safety Authority were established later under UPC to establish the regulations that help UAE in achieving its vision. The Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council's primary purpose is to deliver the vision of His Highness Sh weeikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE, and ruler of Abu Dhabi for the continued fulfillment of the grand design envisaged by the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan and the ongoing evolution of Abu Dhabi as a global capital city. The mandate of the UPC is five-fold and Emirate-wide: # Develop comprehensive plans for blocks, neighbourhoods, districts and regions, both for the creation of new communities and the revitalisation of existing communities. # # Assist in the implementation of all plans created by guiding, monitoring and working with those responsible for implementation. # # Develop regulations, guidelines and policies that will help guide planning and development. # # Review and assess major strategic developments to ensure alignment with Plans Capital 2030, Al Ain 2030, Al Gharbia 2030 and Maritime 2030, and in compliance with internal and external plans, and policies, regulations and guidelines. # # Ensure Estidama principles of sustainability are embedded ‚Äì based on Estidama's four pillars (Environmental, Economic, Social and Cultural) ‚Äì and are incorporated into the built and natural environment through the mandatory Estidama Pearl Rating System.  Vision 2030: Towards a Sustainable Future  The UPC has created a clear hierarchy for guiding the activities of the UPC forward. Vision 2030 is the ultimate goal and is articulated through a set of overarching principles. These are based on the four pillars of Estidama, which sits at the core of Vision 2030, to ensure a holistic approach to sustainable development. The overarching principles were developed to guide the preparation of all of the UPC's plans, policies, standards and guidelines, which form the remaining layers of the hierarchy. They primarily focus on: *Creating a sustainable Emirate that protects resources for current and future generations; *Supporting and enabling economic diversification and growth; *Raising the standard of living across the Emirate; *Protecting, enhancing and promoting Arab and Emirate culture and traditions; and *Embracing contemporary living and respecting the diverse cultures of those residing in Abu Dhabi.  Emirate-wide Framework Plans  Flowing from the overarching principles is a set of key directions that underpin the realisation of Vision 2030 and form the basis for all plans. The first framework plan ‚Äì ‚ÄòPlan Capital 2030‚Äô ‚Äì was launched in 2007 and was ground-breaking in both scale and approach. Since then, the UPC has gone on to prepare other regional framework plans ‚Äì Plan Al Ain 2030 and Plan Al Gharbia 2030 to ensure the continued development of the Emirate as a whole, and Plan Maritime 2030 for Abu Dhabi's coastal areas and waterways. Each plan is updated periodically to ensure it remains relevant and effective in delivering Vision 2030. To support the implementation of the plans and fulfil its mandate, the UPC created the Complete Sustainable Communities (CSC) initiative. It is a comprehensive suite of policies, regulations and manuals, which enables planners to design communities that are flexible enough to meet the diverse needs of both current and future residents, visitors and businesses, and enhance quality of life by incorporating a range of housing options, community facilities and public spaces that are well-connected, safe and sustainable.  Implementation: Explained  While the UPC's mandate does not incorporate the implementation of the plans it prepares, nor the development of any Projects or Master Plans it approves through its ‚ÄòDevelopment Review Streamline‚Äô process, it works collaboratively with each developer to ensure their plans meet the UPC's requirements, and then the developer is responsible for their implementation. In simple terms, the UPC will approve plans, and the developer will build based on those approved plans.  Development Review Streamline: Plans Defined  There are two review streams as part of the UPC Development Review Streamline (DRS) process. A Master Plan is defined as separated multiple buildings, with a road network and community facilities, which must meet certain requirements and standards based on the size of the development. A Project is defined as a single building with no road network, but can include multiple buildings connected by a podium, and requires no community facilities. The UPC is responsible for reviewing and approving Master Plans and Projects within the Emirate. Early proactive coordination between the applicant and the UPC assists to establish whether a development must proceed through the UPC Development Review Stream or whether the development can proceed directly to Estidama and the local approving municipality ‚Äì in whose boundaries the development is located.

During much of Nab√ª-apla-iddina's reign Babylon faced a significant rival in Assyria under the rule of A≈°≈°ur-nƒÅ·π£ir-apli II. Nab√ª-apla-iddina was able to avoid both outright war and significant loss of territory. There was some low level conflict, including a case where he sent a party of troops led by his brother to aid rebels in Suhu (Suhi, Sukhu, Suru). Later in his reign Nabu- apla-iddina agreed to a treaty with A≈°≈°ur-nƒÅ·π£ir-apli II‚Äôs successor ≈†ulmƒÅnu- a≈°arƒìdu III. Internally Nabu-apla-iddina worked on the reconstruction of temples and something of a literary revival took place during his reign with many older works being recopied. Biography The 9th century BC was marked by a recovery of sorts after terrible instability of the preceding hundred and fifty years when Aramaean tribes had wantonly raided into Mesopotamia. He was the 2nd of four successive generations of a single family to rule. His father, Nab√ª-≈°uma-ukin I, had preceded him and he was to be succeeded by his son, Marduk-zakir-≈°umi I. The Synchronistic KinglistSynchronistic Kinglist (KAV 216), Ass. 14616c, iii 18. gives his Assyrian contemporary as A≈°≈°ur-nƒÅ·π£ir-apli II although his reign extended on into that of ≈†ulmƒÅnu-a≈°arƒìdu III. He provided troops to the state of Su·∏´u (Suhi) in the middle Euphrates valley as part of its 878 BC revolt against A≈°≈°ur-nƒÅ·π£ir-apli II. Kudurru, the governor of the fortress of Suru had defiantly refused to pay the Assyrians tribute, provoking their wrath. Nab√ª-apla-iddina's own brother Zabdanu and the diviner Bel-apli-iddina led the army of 3000 and following their defeat were taken prisoner. Although A≈°≈°ur-nƒÅ·π£ir-apli claimed to have conquered the border fortresses Hirimmu and Harutu in his own inscriptions, this may be a restatement of his father, Tukulti-Ninurta II‚Äôs campaigns. His reign marks the last time a governor of Isin was to appear as a prominent official in a legal document, and the roles of Kassites were to be central to the monarchy, occupying high positions at court. The province of Chaldea in southern Babylonia was first mentioned and the ≈°akin temi begins to serve as regional governor. There was a shift in fashion, where, for example, the feathered crown is replaced by a peaked dome as a headdress of the king.

The ravages of the Suteans during the 11th century reign of Adad-apla-iddina (1067-1046 BC) had resulted in the cities of Uruk and Nippur being sacked and the temples of Sippar being so thoroughly destroyed that the cultic iconography of ≈†ama≈° was irretrievably lost. The intervening reign of Simbar-≈†ipak (c. 1025-1008 BC) had resulted in a votive disc being suspended as a substitute and a priest, Ekur-≈°um-u≈°ab≈°i, being appointed. Under the reign of Ka≈°≈°u-nƒÅdin-a·∏´i (c. 1006-1004 BC)) a prebend had been provided to the priest. Not until Nab√ª-apla-iddina‚Äôs reign, however, was a replacement icon crafted for installation in the Ebabbar temple in Sippar, celebrated in the Sun God Tablet (pictured), also known as the tablet of Shamash.

The tablet was rediscovered some 250 years later by Nab√ª-apal-usur (625 BC-605 BC), when it was already broken, and he had it placed in a clay box with his own inscription for safe keeping where it was discovered in the 19th century. no.

Scotch-Irish Settlers Middle Spring Presbyterian Church is located in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania in the small community of Middle Spring, Pennsylvania on present day Pennsylvania State Route 4001 (old Pennsylvania 696), two and six-tenths miles north of Shippensburg, Pennsylvania. A group of Scotch Irish immigrants settled in this area in about 1730. The Scotch Irish were the earliest settlers on the Pennsylvania frontier of the early 18th century. As one author puts it: Rebuilt Middle Spring Church Middle Spring Church today Founding of the Church Plaque to First Log Church In those days, the Middle Spring area was very much a part of this rugged frontier, where Indian attacks were common. Many of these early settlers fell victim to these attacks. These immigrants brought their Scotch Presbyterian origins with them. Presbyterian preaching began on this site in the open air as early as 1736. These settlers erected a Presbyterian Church building at this Middle Spring site in 1738, close to the bank of the small Middle Spring creek that ran through the area. The pioneer Scotch-Irish settlers in the Cumberland Valley almost always built their churches near streams and springs to have available an abundant source of water. The first building was a log church, which became not only a house of worship but a gathering place for the early settlers in the area.History of Middle Spring Presbyterian Church, Middle Spring, Pennsylvania 1738‚Äì1900, Belle McKinney Hays Swope, Newville, Pennsylvania, Times Steam Print House, 1900, Preface, pp. 32,107. There are two other springs in the area ‚Äì Big Spring and Rocky Spring. They called the church site \\"Middle Spring\\", because it was located midway between the Big Spring and the Rocky Spring.Early History of Shippensburg The church was thirty-five feet square. It had slab benches, a dirt floor and was unheated. The pulpit was high and was set against the wall. The precentor's desk was positioned right below and in front of it. Attending the Frontier Church Lower Cemetery Prolific local historian, Belle Swope writes the following about her family members, Robert Quigley and his wife, Mary Jacob Quigley, who were among the early members of the Middle Spring Presbyterian Church at a time when it still held services in the very wild frontier of backwoods Pennsylvania. Original Church Replaced The parishioners replaced the first log church with another in the 1760s. In turn, they replaced this church with the \\"Old Stone Church\\" in 1781. However, it suffered from a \\"structural defect\\". So, the congregation had to tear it down and replace it in 1847. At that time, they moved the church from where the old cemetery is still located (about one-tenth mile to the northwest) to its present location. A Christian Education Building was added to the 1847 sanctuary in 1964. There are four cemeteries associated with Middle Spring Church: the Lower Cemetery, the Upper Cemetery, and the Modern Cemetery;Hannah's Cemetery is locateds outside of Newburg.http://www.middlespringpc.org/about Famous Members Gen. Hugh Brady John Brady Monument, Muncy, Pa. Many of the original settlers of Cumberland County are buried in the Middle Spring Presbyterian Church Cemeteries.Middle Spring Presbyterian Cemetery Among those buried there are Hugh Brady and Hannah Brady, parents of Major John Brady (whose many exploits on the Pennsylvania frontier are commemorated in a monument in Muncy, Pennsylvania). They are also the grandparents of John's sons, Captain Samuel Brady, of Brady's Leap fame and of Samuel's brother, United States Army Major General Hugh Brady, both of whom attended this church.General Hugh Brady was born in Standing Stone, Pennsylvania, which is now Huntingdon, Pennsylvania on 27 July 1768. However, he did attend that church at points in his life. Both his parents had been brought up in the Middle Spring Presbyterian Church and his mother, particularly, was very religious. So, any time Hugh lived in the vicinity of this church, he would have attended it. With that in mind, his sister, Agnes Brady was born on 14 February 1773 in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, which indicates his parents were living there at the time of her birth. The Indians killed his father on 11 April 1779 when they were living near present day Muncy, Pennsylvania. After the death of her husband, his mother Mary Quigley Brady took her still at home children, which included Hugh, to live with her brother Robert Quigley, who attended the Middle Spring Church all his life and is buried in its Upper Cemetery. She stayed with Robert Quigley until October of that year, when she returned to her home near Muncy. Four of Hugh Brady's children were born in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, Mary Luthy Brady on 11 November 1811, Elizabeth Hall Brady on 31 October 1814, Jane Brady on 10 March 1817 and Cassandra Brady on 18 August 1819, which indicates that he lived there during that time period.

His revelations that the program was ten times larger than previously suspected were confirmed in 1992 with the defection to the United States of Colonel Kanatjan Alibekov, the No. 2 scientist for the program. Biography A native of Leningrad, many members of Pasechnik's family, including his parents, perished in the Nazi siege of that city during World War II. Pasechnik studied at the Leningrad Polytechnical Institute, where he was one of the institute's brightest stars, graduating at the top of his class. Pasechnik initially specialised in the study of polymers for biological uses at the Institute of High Molecular Compounds in Leningrad. The intent was to develop new antibiotics and other treatments. In 1974, at the age of 37, Pasechnik was invited by a general from the Soviet Ministry of Defence to start his own biotechnology institute in Leningrad and he was given \\"an unlimited budget\\" to buy equipment in the West and recruit the best staff available. The laboratory he created was in reality part of the countrywide Biopreparat program. Known as the Institute of Ultra Pure Biochemical Preparations, it was to work on a strain of plague. The laboratory actually began operating in 1981, and over the next two years Pasechnik realised that, far from running a civilian research operation dedicated to vaccine development, as he had been promised, he had become part of a vast network of laboratories and factories involved in a massive BW program. According to Pasechnik, the Institute, which had a staff of about 400, did research on modifying cruise missiles to spread the plague. The weapons system was to operate by flying low to avoid early-warning systems and use robot craft to spray clouds of aerosolised pathogens over unsuspecting enemies. The team succeeded in producing an aerosolised version of the plague microbe that could survive outside a lab. This version of the organism was genetically-engineered to be resistant to antibiotics. In the mid-1980s, Pasechnik became increasingly dissatisfied. (\\"I couldn't sleep at night, thinking about what we were doing,\\" he would tell his British handlers.) He began to plan a defection in 1988, but had never been permitted to travel abroad. His chance came in the summer of 1989, when in recognition of past performance he was allowed to travel to Toulouse to sign the contracts of a pending deal with a French maker of chemical laboratory equipment. Rather than signing, he reported to the British Embassy in Paris. Once revealed, the Soviet government insisted that Pasechnik's research had been intended to defend against acts of biological warfare by an enemy and that the program had been stopped. In early 1993, the British government permitted Pasechnik to speak publicly. The next year, writer James Adams told Pasechnik's story in a book, The New Spies. Pasechnik lived in Wiltshire and worked at the UK Department of Health's Centre for Applied Microbiology & Research (CAMR) at Porton Down, near Salisbury, before forming Regma Biotechnologies, which is involved in research into tuberculosis and other drug resistant infections. Pasechnik died of a stroke in 2001 in Salisbury. He was survived by his wife, Natasha, a daughter and two sons. According to one of his sons, Nikita, he was always expecting the KGB (or the later FSB) to deal with him. See also * List of Eastern Bloc defectors References *Saxon, Wolfgang, \\"V.

National Parks of New York Harbor was formed in 2003 and administers properties ranging from the Statue of Liberty National Monument in New York Harbor to Gateway National Recreation Area in several locations and Saint Paul's Church National Historic Site in Mount Vernon, New York. Despite its name, technically the office does not oversee any national parks, but rather national monuments, national memorials, national historic sites, and a large national recreation area. Properties overseen by the office make up and attract more than 12 million visitors each year. They are served by a visitor's center at Federal Hall National Memorial. History The National Parks of New York Harbor umbrella was created in September 2003 as a means of drawing more visitors to the National Park Service properties in the New York City region. The organizers' primary concern was the under-visitation of the parks that comprise the Gateway National Recreation Area, one of the first urban parks when it was created, rather than the acquisition of parkland. Maria Burks, the first Commissioner, was charged with increasing awareness of park units other than the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, and saw the solution to this problem as increasing the number of ferries that connect and serve the properties. As a result, when the ferry contract for the Statue of Liberty was up for bid, a discussion occurred about asking interested parties to include increased harbor service as part of their packages, but this request did not receive much focus in the end. Part of Federal Hall National Memorial was repurposed as a new visitors' center in late 2006 to meet the needs of the organization's diverse properties and the visitors thereto and the center has been used as a forum for visitor input into National Park Service programming.

Life He was the eldest son of Sir John Eustace of Castlemartin, County Kildare; they were an old Anglo-Irish family, a branch of the FitzEustace dynasty. Following the Desmond Rebellions, the family's loyalty to the Crown was suspect, as Viscount Baltinglass, the head of the family, was one of the principal rebels. Maurice was sent to be educated at the Jesuit college at Bruges in Flanders. There, after the completion of his secular studies, he desired to enter the Society of Jesus. His father, however, wrote to the superiors of the college to send him home. Maurice returned to Ireland. After a brief stay, during which he tried to dissuade his father from opposing his vocation, he went back to Flanders. His old masters, at the college of Bruges, advised him to return to Ireland and devote himself in the world to the service of religion. Shortly after his arrival in Ireland he got an appointment as captain of horse. He never abandoned the idea of becoming a priest, and secretly took Holy Orders. His servant, who was aware of the fact, told his father, who had his son immediately arrested and imprisoned in Dublin. A younger brother, desiring to inherit the family estates, also reported Maurice to be a priest, a Jesuit, and a friend of the Queen's enemies. As a consequence he was put on trial for high treason. During his imprisonment Adam Loftus, Archbishop of Dublin, offered him his daughter in marriage, and a large dowry if he would accept the reformed religion.

Like Aeschylus in The Persians, Racine took his subject from contemporary history, taking care to choose a far off location, the Ottoman Empire. In 1635, the sultan Murad IV (Amurat, in the work of Racine) had his brothers and potential rivals Bajazet (Bayezid) and Orcan (Orhan) executed. Racine was inspired by this deed, and centered his play on Bajazet. Racine also develops several romantic subplots in the seraglio. The action is particularly complex, and can only be resolved by a series of deaths and suicides. The initial success of the play was not prolonged. Today, it is one Racine's least played pieces. In 1717 it was staged in London's Drury Lane Theatre under the title The Sultaness after being rewritten by Charles Johnson. The character of Bajazet in the opera of the same name by Antonio Vivaldi is not the same as the protagonist of Racine. The play was translated into English by Alan Hollinghurst. This translation was published by Chatto & Windus in 1991. In 2011 Pennsylvania State University Press published an English translation of the play by Geoffrey Alan Argent in iambic pentameter couplets. A translation in Alexandrines was made, as for all the other Racine plays, by Samuel Solomon and published by Random House (1967). Summary of the play Act 1 (4 scenes) Osmin brings news of the sultan Amurat to Byzantium : they appear to be at the point of abandoning the siege of Babylon. Acomat, grand vizir, wishes to take advantage of this failure by encouraging the Janissaries to revolt. He has already refused to execute Bajazet as the sultan commanded. Finally, Acomat believes Bajazet and Roxane, the sultan's favorite, are in love, and he wishes to rely on them while marrying Atalide. In reality, Bajazet is in love with Atalide; he only returns the love of Roxane in order to become king. Act 2 (5 scenes) Roxane wants to dethrone Amurat by wedding Bajazet. He is reticent, which infuriates Roxane. Acomat, and then Atalide pushes Bajazet to accept, and he considers it. Act 3 (8 scenes) Bajazet and Roxane make up, while Atalide wishes to die, having saved the man she loves. Bajazet comes to tell her that he has only made vague promises to Roxane. Roxane overhears this conversation, and begins to realize Bajazet and Atalide's relationship. Act 4 (7 scenes) Orcan, the sultan's servant, has come home to announce that, against all odds, Amurat has taken Babylon. Roxane receives evidence of the love between Bajazet and Atalide, and it is these two elements which force Roxane into action: she will kill Bajazet in order to please the sultan. Acomat, who up until now has conspired with Bajazet and Roxane, has decided to act from now on without them. Act 5 (12 scenes) After one final interview with Bajazet, Roxane has him hanged. After this, she is assassinated by Orcan, who is acting under a secret order of the Sultan. The conspiracy of Acomat is run aground, and Atalide kills herself on stage.

Holm played for the St. Louis Cardinals for seven seasons between and , missing the and seasons. Holm was a member of the Cardinals first World Series in 1926. He batted and threw right-handed. Holm suffered from mental illness later in life; nearly two decades after leaving professional baseball, he killed his wife shortly before killing himself. Early life Holm was born in Peterson, Iowa, and as a child he moved with his family to Alton, Iowa. Holm received his nickname, \\"Wattie\\", when he was young. Holm's father encouraged him to pursue dental school. attended the University of Iowa for a year before leaving to pursue a baseball career. Holm married the former Ella Powell in Spencer, Iowa, in 1923. She was a schoolteacher. They had a son named Robert and a daughter named Margaret. Career Holm made his major league debut with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1924, after playing minor league baseball at Syracuse the season before. He spent much of his career back and forth between the major leagues and the minor leagues, but he stayed in the major leagues between 1926 and 1929. His best season came in 1927, when Holm had a .286 batting average and drove in 66 runs while playing 110 games for St. Louis. In the fall of 1929, the Cardinals advised Holm to have surgery on his tonsils and nose. He refused at the time, but underwent the procedure in the spring of 1930, causing a delay in his preparation for the 1930 season. He played for the Houston Buffaloes in 1930 and the Rochester Red Wings in 1931. Holm split 1932, his last year in professional baseball, between the Cardinals, the Red Wings and the Columbus Red Birds.

In 1942, he trained as a machinist to support the defense effort in World War II. Later, he lived in Lake View, Iowa, and ran a factory that manufactured baseball bats. Holm was turned down for a managing job with a local baseball team in early 1950 because of concerns about his mental health. He had been depressed since suffering a series of business failures. Holm also had a family history of mental illness, as his brother Marcel had committed suicide. In mid-May 1950, Holm quit his job at a sporting goods store in Spencer, Iowa. On May 19, at his home in Everly, Iowa, Holm fatally shot Ella, seriously wounded Margaret, and killed himself with a gunshot to the head. Robert was working in another city when the shooting occurred. Fred Sindt, who owned the home where the family lived, said that he had a calm conversation with Holm minutes before the shooting. He said that the family was getting ready to move to Linn Grove, Iowa, the next week. After Margaret recovered from her injuries, she lived with the family of Holm's former teammate Billy Southworth.

She has had a prolific career, performing in bands such as Plumtree and collaborating with artists like Joel Plaskett, Al Tuck, the late Dutchy Mason, the Mighty Popo and members of Sloan and Blue Rodeo. History Sturton got her start at an early age when her parents put her into classical violin lessons for eight years. In her teens, while shopping for some fiddle music, she saw a harmonica and bought it. This led to a passion for the Blues, and she quickly acquired proficiency with the instrument. Her adolescence was spent under the tutelage of local Ottawa harp legend Larry \\"The Bird\\" Mootham and performing in and around Ottawa at various blues bars such as The Whipping Post, The Rainbow and Tucson's. As a young adult Sturton left Ottawa to study History at Dalhousie University, in Halifax, Nova Scotia. While there she learned to play the bass guitar and joined the indie all-female band Plumtree. With the band she released and recorded two albums, won a YTV Yaa! Achievement Award and toured extensively around Canada with others, like Thrush Hermit and the Weakerthans. Plumtree also inspired the comic series entitled \\"Scott Pilgrim,\\" named after their hit song. She claims that she used the experience to cut her teeth on the rigours of songwriting, traveling, marketing and other aspects of being a touring musician. In 2000 Sturton moved to Japan to teach English. While there she met Sonnet Bingham from Arizona. Together with two locals they started The Secret, a bilingual J-Pop influenced Garage band, and toured Japan and Canada. The experience gave Sturton the confidence to write and sing her own songs. During her time in Japan she was greatly influenced by the shamisen.  Current musical projects  The first instrument Sturton studied seriously was the harmonica. During her teen years, she wanted to be a professional blues harp player and since then, has studied with Larry \\"The Bird\\" Mootham and Cuban- Canadian harmonica virtuoso Carlos del Junco. In 2013 Sturton quit her job with a non-profit literary foundation that required her to travel across Canada to focus on her solo music career and follow her passion for playing harmonica. To date she has performed on stage with Neko Case, Dutch Mason and Paul Oscher, and performs regularly with Ottawa blues singer and guitarist John Carroll. In addition to performing, Sturton frequently gives harmonica workshops and has also created instructional videos aimed at audiences curious about playing harmonica.

It was originally featured on the group's third album Dressed to Kill. Background Written by Paul Stanley in under an hour, the track also appears in a live version on Alive!. Stanley was inspired by the Moody Blues song \\"Question\\" when composing the tune. The lyrics are a playful narrative portraying a Don Juan who takes the unique tack of offering himself up to his romantic prey: \\"Baby, baby don't you hesitate/'Cause I just can't wait/Lady, won't you take me down to my knees/You can do what you please/C'mon and Love Me.\\" \\"C'mon and Love Me\\" became a favorite in concert and a regular part of Kiss' 1970s performances.

It was released in 1975 on the band's third studio album, Dressed to Kill. The song was written by Gene Simmons and Stephen Coronel while Simmons was in a band called Bullfrog Bheer. Although it was first released in 1975, Kiss had performed \\"She\\" on previous tours. It was removed from the setlist during the 1980s and the 1990s. Background Coronel was the originator of the song, with Simmons contributing the words and lyrics during an evening rehearsal with Wicked Lester. The song was originally called \\"She Walks by Moonlight\\", after a line in the film Hondo where, as Simmons said: > 'I want your daughter.' [The chief said:] 'You may not have my daughter.' > [The cowboy said:] 'Why not?' [The chief said:] 'She walks by moonlight.' > And that's the first line of the song. I didn't even know what it meant, I > just loved the sound of it. The Wicked Lester version of the song is 3:07 in length, while the later Dressed to Kill version is 4:08 long and the original line \\"she's no good\\" was changed to \\"she's so good\\". Also, the Kiss version lacked the original's congas (played by session musician Jimmy Maelen) and flute. Ace Frehley's solo in the song was based on Robby Krieger's solo in The Doors' song \\"Five to One\\", starting in the same key and tempo. It was also self-admittedly \\"copied\\" by Mike McCready of Pearl Jam on that band's song \\"Alive\\".Gilbert, Jeff. \\"Prime Cuts: Mike McCready - The Best of Pearl Jam!\\". Guitar School. May 1995. \\"She\\" is one of only three Kiss songs taken from the Wicked Lester era, with the others being the Hotter Than Hell \\"Goin' Blind\\" and Dressed to Kill \\"Love Her All I Can\\". \\"She\\" and \\"Love Her All I Can\\" were intended for inclusion on the Hotter Than Hell album, but the band already had enough material for the album. Live performances Although not released officially until 1975, Kiss played \\"She\\" on previous tours. Wicked Lester also performed the song. Following the 1975 Alive! Tour, \\"She\\" was dropped and was not performed during the 1980s and the 1990s. The band did play the song occasionally during the 1994-95 Kiss My Ass Tour and on Halloween night in 1998 at Dodger Stadium. The band returned the song to the setlist for the Rock the Nation Tour in 2004. It was performed again during the 2008-09 Alive 35 World Tour. The song was included only on the Australian setlist of the Kiss 40th Anniversary World Tour in 2015.

Approximately long, it begins on the south flank of the Pemberton Icefield. Its course is generally eastward from there to the Green River valley, although upon reaching that valley it runs north for about roughly parallel to the Green before joining it. For much of its course, known as the Soo Valley, it forms a serpentine marshland until reaching a short canyon before entering the valley of the Green River. Heavily logged over the years, the valley is accessible by rough dirt road. It is a popular cross-country skiing area in winter, partly because its middle reaches are accessible via trails from the Emerald Estates neighbourhood of Whistler. The uppermost part of the Soo Valley features various volcanic formations.

System HD 150136 is listed in the Washington Double Star Catalog as having seven visual components within 30 arc seconds. Component A is a close triple system containing three massive class O main sequence stars. The brightest companion is catalogued individually as HD 150135 as well as component C of the multiple system, separated by only 10 arc-seconds. It is another O class spectroscopic binary and also a member of NGC 5193. The other stars are all 10th to 12th magnitude, similar to many other stars known to be members of NGC 6193. The primary star consists of a double-lined spectroscopic binary with a more distant tertiary companion. The third star is orbiting the other two with a period of 8.2 years, an eccentricity of 0.73, and an inclination of 108¬∞. The close binary stars are separated by hardly more than their own diameters and orbit in less than 3 days, but the third is separated enough to have been resolved visually by VLTI. The measured separation in 2012 was 9 milli arc seconds, corresponding to 11-12 AU.

Bohlin first earned a degree in theology in 1960. He also studied musicology under Carl-Allan Moberg and Ingmar Bengtsson at Uppsala University, graduating with his doctorate in 1970. His doctoral dissertation utilized his former background as he wrote on liturgical song in Swedish churches in the 18th and 19th centuries. After his graduate studies, Bohlin became a reader at Lund University in 1970 and was appointed a lecturer there the following year. In 1972 he began leading the Lunds Students√•ngf√∂rening (Lund Student Choral Society) for the next thirteen years. In 1982 Bohlin became an elected member of the Swedish Royal Academy of Music in 1982, later serving as a board member from 1983‚Äì1990.

Intersecting circles. Congruent circles. In inversive geometry, the circle of antisimilitude (also known as mid-circle) of two circles, Œ± and Œ≤, is a reference circle for which Œ± and Œ≤ are inverses of each other. If Œ± and Œ≤ are non-intersecting or tangent, a single circle of antisimilitude exists; if Œ± and Œ≤ intersect at two points, there are two circles of antisimilitude. When Œ± and Œ≤ are congruent, the circle of antisimilitude degenerates to a line of symmetry through which Œ± and Œ≤ are reflections of each other... Properties If the two circles Œ± and Œ≤ cross each other, another two circles Œ≥ and Œ¥ are each tangent to both Œ± and Œ≤, and in addition Œ≥ and Œ¥ are tangent to each other, then the point of tangency between Œ≥ and Œ¥ necessarily lies on one of the two circles of antisimilitude. If Œ± and Œ≤ are disjoint and non-concentric, then the locus of points of tangency of Œ≥ and Œ¥ again forms two circles, but only one of these is the (unique) circle of antisimilitude. If Œ± and Œ≤ are tangent or concentric, then the locus of points of tangency degenerates to a single circle, which again is the circle of antisimilitude.Tangencies: Circular Angle Bisectors, The Geometry Junkyard, David Eppstein, 1999. If the two circles Œ± and Œ≤ cross each other, then their two circles of antisimilitude each pass through both crossing points, and bisect the angles formed by the arcs of Œ± and Œ≤ as they cross. If a circle Œ≥ crosses circles Œ± and Œ≤ at equal angles, then Œ≥ is crossed orthogonally by one of the circles of antisimilitude of Œ± and Œ≤; if Œ≥ crosses Œ± and Œ≤ in supplementary angles, it is crossed orthogonally by the other circle of antisimilitude, and if Œ≥ is orthogonal to both Œ± and Œ≤ then it is also orthogonal to both circles of antisimilitude. For three circles Suppose that, for three circles Œ±, Œ≤, and Œ≥, there is a circle of antisimilitude for the pair (Œ±,Œ≤) that crosses a second circle of antisimilitude for the pair (Œ≤,Œ≥). Then there is a third circle of antisimiltude for the third pair (Œ±,Œ≥) such that the three circles of antisimilitude cross each other in two triple intersection points. Altogether, at most eight triple crossing points may be generated in this way, for there are two ways of choosing each of the first two circles and two points where the two chosen circles cross. These eight or fewer triple crossing points are the centers of inversions that take all three circles Œ±, Œ≤, and Œ≥ to become equal circles. For three circles that are mutually externally tangent, the (unique) circles of antisimilitude for each pair again cross each other at 120¬∞ angles in two triple intersection points that are the isodynamic points of the triangle formed by the three points of tangency.

It flows northeast into the Lillooet River approximately northwest of the village of Pemberton and is adjacent to the Upper Lillooet Provincial Park. It is noted for a large set of surface hot springs, known as the Meager Creek Hot Springs. These are related to volcanism of the Mount Meager massif on its north side. Keyhole Hot Springs, also known as Pebble Creek Hot Springs, fed from the same geothermal vents is much more accessible, via the ploughed Upper Lillooet FSR (Forest Service Road), and is a trail as opposed to to Meager Creek Hot Springs.check the Forest Service Road Reports before travel https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/dsq/engineering/roadinformation.htm Public access reopened in the summer of 2008, several years after vandalism of the site and flooding damage to the access road and bridge had seen the site closed. On September 19, 2009, the Capricorn Creek Bridge was once again destroyed by a debris slide.Meager Hotsprings- No Easy Access! The springs were closed to public access, except in winter, when they could be accessed over the top of the Pemberton Icefield / Meager GlacierMeager Glacier by means of either snowmobile or cross country skis. Until 2010, the site was serviced by Creekside Resources on a fee basis to use the pools. Though the pools are still officially closed, public access to the area has resumed. Because of limited access, there have been no fecal coliform tests done. Prior to the slide, they were done on a monthly basis, except winter and the sand traps were cleared every 2 to 3 days. The pools must be shoveled out and flushed before use 45 minutes is the common practice. A new public trail, named VOC Harrison Hut Trail, opened in the summer of 2014. It was built and completed, in August 2014, by volunteers from the University of British Columbia Varsity Outdoor Club (VOC).Harrison Hut routeHarrison Hut Trail Work: Making a Change in the World In December 2015, the area was offered up for tenure by the BC Ministry of Forests; they were looking for a proposal to formally develop the existing ad hoc trail from the mark along the VOC Harrison Hut Trail, where it passes through a clear cut and connects to the old Meager Creek Hot Springs Trail, built on an existing decommissioned logging road.General Location and Extensive Use Area Maps As the pools are officially closed, there is currently no fee. A fee structure will be reinstated if tenure is granted. First right of refusal goes to the historical operator: the Lil'wat First Nation's Creekside Resources. If they defer, the tenure applicant has proposed to maintain the pools. The historical fee prior to the 2010 slide was $5. Though people camp for free in unofficial sites in the Upper Meager Valley, it is not allowed around the hot spring pools as the Meager Creek Hot Springs Recreational Area is a Minimum Impact Site. Also, camping in the Valley bottom is prohibited because of significant seismic danger. Wildlife such as wolves, wolverine, moose, raptors, hybrid black-tailed deer/mule deer, hybrid lynx/bob cat, mountain goats, mountain sheep, and waterfowl inhabit the area as well as grizzly and black bears. The area is about a two-hour drive from Pemberton on paved roads, gravel roads, and dirt tracks. Although normally reached by four- wheel drive vehicles and larger pickup trucks, the last can be covered by snowmobile in winter.

Physical Details Approximately in area, the icefield's shape is roughly triangular, with an apex on its northern side, where a short gap separates the ice-mass from that of the smaller Overseer Icefield. Some reckonings include the icemasses of the Overseer massif, in which case the Pemberton Icefield's area may be considered to be ~ larger in area. Overseer Mountain is the highest summit in the region lying in the triangle between the basins of the Lillooet, Squamish-Elaho and Cheakamus- Green valleys, although the highest named summit in the Pemberton Icefield proper is Longspur Peak, on the main icefield's northwest flank above the Ryan River, although a higher, unnamed summit lies in between them, at the northernmost edge of the icefield. Just east of Longspur are Kwtamts Peak and Sisqa Peak (names from St'at'imcets language of Lil'wat people, whose traditional territory includes the eastern reaches and related valleys of the icefield). The southernmost summit of the icefield is Exodus Peak, which lies in the angle between the uppermost reaches of the Squamish River and the valley of the Elaho River, a tributary of the Squamish. Streams Streams having their origin in the icecap include the Squamish River and Soo River on its southern edge, Rutherford Creek of its eastern point, the Ryan River off its northeast side, and tributary streams to the Elaho River, a tributary of the Squamish, on the west, and the south fork of Meager Creek, on its north side, another tributary of the Lillooet. Other smaller icefields nearby are the Ipsoot Glacier (also known as the Ipsoot Icefield) to the east, on the north side of Rutherford Creek, and the Powder Mountain Icefield to the south, beyond the divide separating the headwaters of the Squamish and Soo Rivers. Popular Use Nearby the Resort Municipality of Whistler, the icefield is popular with back-country skiers heli-skiing operations, summer heli-hiking, and onscreen entertainment.

Harvey (of Lonesome Spurs and The Rockats). Lemmy died in 2015 and as of 2017, former Morbid Angel member David Vincent took Lemmy's place as vocalist and bassist. History The Head Cat was formed after recording the Elvis Presley tribute album by Swing Cats A Special Tribute to Elvis in July 1999 to which the future bandmates all contributed. After recordings were finished they stayed at the studio and Lemmy picked up an acoustic guitar and started playing some of his old favorite songs by Johnny Cash, Buddy Holly, and Eddie Cochran. The rest of the guys knew them all and joined in. The name of the band was created by combining the names Mot√∂rhead, The Stray Cats, and 13 Cats, which resulted in The Head Cat, similar to what Lemmy did in 1980 with Headgirl, a collaboration between Mot√∂rhead and Girlschool.Kilmister, Ian Fraser and Garza, Janiss, White Line Fever, Simon & Schuster, 2002 In 2006, the band released their first studio album on June 27, Fool's Paradise, which was a re-release of an earlier album titled Lemmy, Slim Jim & Danny B recorded in September 1999, even though Fool's Paradise does not include three songs from the first release and the track list is in a different order. It included cover songs from artists such as Buddy Holly, Carl Perkins, Jimmy Reed, T-Bone Walker, Lloyd Price, Elvis Presley, and Johnny Cash. On the recordings, Lemmy played acoustic guitar in live performances too including Rockin' The Cat Club, the only live album the band had. In later years, Lemmy began to use his signature Rickenbacker bass in live performances, saying \\"I'm just not that good on guitar\\". Before that re- release, a DVD of a live performance was released on 25 April 2006. The album was recorded on January 13, 2004 and was released in 2006 on limited vinyl 322 copies too. It was filmed at the Phantom's Cat Club on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles and included 13 live songs and interviews with the band. The band's second studio album (or third altogether), Walk the Walk...Talk the Talk, was recorded by the Niji Entertainment Group in June 2010, released in 2011. This was the first new material by the band in eleven years, following up from the Lemmy, Slim Jim & Danny B album in 1999. It has two original songs \\"American Beat\\" and \\"Eagles Fly On Friday\\". While the first album was all acoustic and the second album was half-acoustic, the third album (second studio) was all electric with Lemmy playing bass like in Mot√∂rhead.

It was captured by Armenian forces during the Battle of Kalbajar, near the end of the Nagorno-Karabakh War. It has since been slowly partly repopulated by Armenians from the eastern Shahumyan and Gyulistan area which fled during the Nagorno Karabakh war, and is the capital of the Republic of Artsakh's Shahumyan Region, which has different altered borders from the Soviet region of the same name.  History  Kalbajar was once an Armenian city, reflected by the presence of numerous khachkars and the nearby Dadivank monastery, but the last significant Armenian population disappeared around 1780. As territory of the Russian Empire and Soviet Union, it had a mostly Azerbaijani and Kurdish population.  Nagorno- Karabakh War  Armenian and Karabakh forces invaded and occupied Kalbajar during the Nagorno-Karabakh War, due to its strategic location between the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast and Armenia.The Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict: A Legal Analysis.

Repopulation  In the early 2000s, Kalbajar began to be repopulated. Infrastructure has been rebuilt and the town now has electricity and a nearby highway connecting it to Armenia. As of 2018, the town's school has 177 schoolchildren. Lakes, rivers, mountains and zones There are 13 lakes in local plains and mountains. Kalbajar's longest river is the Tartar. Its tributaries are the Tutkhun, Lev, Zaylik, Alolar, Garaarkhaj (Sarkar) rivers. There are also 20 well-known water springs. 70-80 per cent of the district is made up of mountains and each of them has a name.

The building includes several restaurants, lounges, and student organization offices, as well as a bowling alley and a hotel. History In the early 1900s, Purdue was in need of a place for students, staff, and visitors to gather in the Purdue community. The Class of 1912 began collecting funds to build a union for Purdue. Funds were collected until the start of World War I. Many men and women from Purdue had participated in the war, and some have died in it. It was decided that the union should be a memorial dedicated to those men and women. From then on, funds were collected to begin building the PMU.‚ÄúHistory of the Union‚Äù, Purdue Memorial Union, 2011 http://www.union.purdue.edu/Home/ Building The PMU was opened in 1924 before it was completely finished in 1929.

The line between Green Ayre and Morecambe was used for pioneering experimental electrification via overhead wires. The station closed to passengers in 1966 and there are no remains. History Lancaster's first two stations were the Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway's at Greaves in 1840,Vinter, p.127 and the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway's Lancaster Castle which superseded it in 1846.Bairstow, p.96 The third station was opened by the Morecambe Harbour and Railway Company (MH&R;) on 12 June 1848.Vinter, p.129 The station building was designed by Edmund Sharpe.Price, p.90Hartwell and Pevsner, p.386 Originally called Lancaster,Dewick, p.24 it was soon renamed Lancaster Green Ayre, although timetables incorrectly listed its name as Lancaster Green Area until 1870. The line originally ran from Lancaster to . The MH&R; soon amalgamated with the \\"little\\" North Western Railway, which continued the line eastward from 17 November 1849, reaching in 1850. A connecting curve between Green Ayre and Castle opened on 18 December 1849. The station was on the southern bank of the River Lune, adjacent to Skerton Bridge and immediately to the north of the city centre. Immediately west of the station was the junction between the connecting curve to Castle and Green Ayre's engine shed and the main line, which then crossed the river via Greyhound Bridge and continued along the north bank of the river, passing under the Lancaster and Carlisle's Carlisle Bridge over the river. East of Green Ayre the line followed the south bank of the river. Take-over by the Midland Railway Railways around Lancaster and Morecambe in 1913 The \\"little\\" North Western Railway was taken over in 1874 by the Midland Railway, which had previously operated, then leased the line,Awdry, pp.97-98 and became a significant route for that company, giving access from its Yorkshire lines to the Lancashire coast in an area dominated by its major rival, the London and North Western Railway. The Lancaster- Morecambe line was electrified in 1908. This was the first high-voltage overhead electrification in the United Kingdom and was at 6,600 volts AC 25 Hz; it was the pioneer for such systems. It was intended to be a test bed for further mainline electrification by the Midland Railway. In 1952 the original rolling stock was life expired and was withdrawn. Steam traction took over for a short while and then the power supply was upgraded to 50 Hz and some new stock provided; this was to act as a test-bed for further main-line electrification in the UK.Vinter, p.131 This section of line became particularly busy. Run down The line between and Morecambe via Green Ayre fell victim to the Beeching Axe. It closed to passengers on 2 January 1966,Suggitt, p.16 although the line through the station continued to be used for freight until 16 March 1976. The station was demolished that year.Vinter, p.132 The Greyhound Bridge was converted for use by the A589 road from 1972.Suggitt, p.23 The site of Green Ayre station is now a public park. Nothing remains of the station,Vinter, p.138 but a goods crane from goods shed has been erected in the park near the site.Suggitt, p.19 The site of the adjacent locomotive shed is now occupied by a supermarket.

It is a tributary of the Suhre. The Wyna is 32 km long (main outflow in Reinach (AG): 0.9 m3/s). Larger towns in Wynetal are Berom√ºnster, Menziken, Reinach (AG) and Gr√§nichen.  River  The Wyna in Suhr The Wyna is started by several headwaters south-west of Neudorf (LU) in the Lindewald (forest), 17 km north-east from Lucerne. Near Underdorf, the Lochbach, or Hole Creek, which starts in the Chegelwald, west of Neudorf, joins the Wyna. Then, it runs north through Berom√ºnster (still canton of Lucerne), through Menziken and Reinach (now in canton of Aargau), west of Zetzwil, through Oberkulm and Unterkulm, through Teufenthal (AG), and through Gr√§nichen before joining the Suhre at 385m in Suhr, which joins the Aare further north, just three kilometres later. Tributaries that feed the Wyna include the Lochbach (left, in Underdorf), Moosbach (left, north of Berom√ºnster), Schwarzenbach (right, south of Menziken), Rickenbach (left, south of Menziken), Vorderdorfbach Zetzwil/Totenb√§chli (right, in Zetzwil), and Dorfbach Gontenschwil/Sagenbach (left, after Zetzwil]), Dorfbach Teufenthal (right, in Teufenthal (AG)), Pfendelbach (left, west of the hamlet Bleien), Refentalbach (right, just after Bleien), Lochbach (left, in Gr√§nichen).  Valley  The valley, the Wynetal (or Germanized also known as Wynental), is fairly narrow, with an average width of about 500 meters, and drops very smoothly from 670m a.s.l. in Neudorf to 406m a.s.l. in Gr√§nichen. Quite steep hills rise on both sides, carved by tributary valleys. In the east, a mountain range (about 810m to 600m a.s.l.) separate the Wynetal from the Seetal with the Hallwilersee and the Baldeggersee. The mountain range in the west (about 870m to 570m a.s.l.) separate the Wyne Valley from the Suhretal with the Sempachersee, from which the Suhre rises. Municipalities found in the Wynental from beginning to end of the Wyna are: Neudorf, Berom√ºnster, Burg (AG) and Menziken, Pfeffikon and Reinach (AG), Leimbach (AG), Gontenschwil, Zetzwil, Oberkulm and then Unterkulm, Teufenthal (AG), Gr√§nichen, and finally Suhr. The general region is also known as the Stumpenland due to the cigar industry that once centered in Menziken.  Glacial genesis  The upper portions of the valley was carved by the Reuss Glacier. Large moraine deposits remain at Zetzwil and Gontenschwil. The surrounding hills are largely molasse.  Transportation  Connecting road 23 runs along the Wyna for the majority of the valley's length from Berom√ºnster to Suhr. This road is referred to variously as Aargauerstrasse, Hauptstrasse, Aarauerstrasse, Wynentalstrasse, and numerous names north of Teufenthal and is a popular cycling route. The WSB (Wynental- und Suhrentalbahn), a narrow gauge railroad, serves the Wynental. The Wynental branch of the WSB runs from Aarau to Menziken.

Multimedios Televisi√≥n operates a regional network concentrated in northeastern Mexico, and a handful of independent stations operate primarily in regions along the border. Noncommercial stations are divided into public and social concessions. Public concessions are predominantly owned by federal and state governments and public institutions of higher education. The two largest public networks are Canal Once, owned by the Instituto Polit√©cnico Nacional, and the multiplexed transmitter network of the Sistema P√∫blico de Radiodifusi√≥n del Estado Mexicano (SPR), which offers multiple public television services. 27 of the 32 states also operate their own state networks, some of which have dozens of low-power transmitters. Social concessions are held by private universities, civil associations, and some individuals. In addition, due to Mexico's rugged terrain, many stations operate low-powered, mostly co-channel translators (legally known as equipos complementarios de zona de sombra) to serve areas shielded by terrain, to improve signal reception in fringe areas, or (in some cases) to serve completely different television markets. Translators may be in different states from their parent stations; a handful even operate as local stations in their own right with their own local programs. The list demonstrates the legacy of large television station concessions awarded in the 1980s and early 1990s. The two most notable of these were awarded to Televisa; the 1982 concession of 95 television stations in small communities is responsible for the bulk of the Canal de las Estrellas network, while the concession of 62 stations to Radiotelevisora de M√©xico Norte, a subsidiary of Televisa, was awarded in the early 1990s and expanded the Canal 5 and Gala TV networks. Since the conversion to digital, Televisa and Azteca have multiplexed transmitters in rural areas, bringing full national network service to smaller communities for the first time. In March 2015, Grupo Imagen (under the name Cadena Tres I, S.A. de C.V.) and Grupo Radio Centro won concessions for 123 new television stations each, forming two new national television networks. The new networks must meet a minimum coverage standard set by the IFT for 2018 and reach full national coverage by 2020. However, Grupo Radio Centro refused to pay its winning bid of 3.058 billion pesos and thus had its concession revoked. Imagen's network, Imagen Televisi√≥n, launched on October 17, 2016 with a presence in nearly every state. Analog stations were shut off beginning on July 18, 2013, with a pilot transition in Tijuana. In 2015, stations went digital-only throughout the country on 10 dates. Some 129 analog television stations owned by noncommercial entities, such as state governments, and another 368 repeaters of primarily Televisa stations, received exemptions to delay their transition until December 31, 2016. Virtual channels were assigned by the IFT in 2016, unifying most transmitters of national networks under one number and ending decades of old analog channel numbers. In some cases, local stations were required to find new virtual channels.

On December 23, 1972, Swearingen was the referee for an AFC Divisional Playoff game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Oakland Raiders at Three Rivers Stadium.http://www.profootballhof.com/hall/story.jsp?story_id=436 The game is famous for a play known as the Immaculate Reception. With 22 seconds remaining and Oakland leading 7‚Äì6, Pittsburgh was on its own 40-yard line on 4th and 10. Terry Bradshaw threw to John \\"Frenchy\\" Fuqua, but safety Jack Tatum collided with Fuqua sending the ball wobbling backward. Rookie running back Franco Harris then scooped up the ball, running untouched into the end zone. Under the rules of that time, there could not be a legal catch if the ball touched two offensive players in succession. If the ball either bounced off both Tatum and Fuqua, or hit only Tatum, the catch would be legal. Swearingen consulted with umpire Pat Harder and field judge Adrian Burk, but then went to a sideline phone to consult with NFL supervisor of officials Art McNally, who was in the press box. Swearingen emerged and made his ruling that the play was a touchdown. The Steelers went on to win 13‚Äì7. Swearingen once again found the spotlight in Super Bowl XIII when he called a controversial pass interference penalty on Dallas CB Benny Barnes, who was covering Pittsburgh WR Lynn Swann in the fourth quarter of a game the Steelers led 21-17.

Unlike many solo musicians, Adams does not use a rotation of session musicians, preferring to use the same musicians for all his studio and live work. History Although Adams' solo career started in 1979, a constant backing band did not materialise immediately. It was not until work began on Adams' second album, You Want It You Got It that the band began to crystallize. Working alongside Adams on many of the tracks for this album were Hall & Oates drummer Mickey Curry and keyboardist Tommy Mandel, both of whom would go on to become regular members of the group. Adams' 1983 album, Cuts Like A Knife saw the addition of bassist Dave Taylor and guitarist Keith Scott, who had worked with Adams in the past. With Taylor and Scott added to the line-up, the band had now assumed the form that it would keep for the next 15 years. Drummer Pat Steward also performed drumming duties with the band, most notably on Adams' hit \\"Summer of '69\\" and at Live Aid in 1985. He also was the drummer on the world tour. Steward left the band and was replaced by Micky Curry of Hall and Oates. In 1998, Mandel and Taylor left the band and Adams, Scott and Curry toured as a three piece band with Adams playing bass and Scott performing both the rhythm and lead guitar parts.

She used to compete in the 10m synchronized event with Roseline Filion before the latter retired in January 2017. Benfeito and Filion won bronze medals in the 10 m platform synchro event at the 2012 and 2016 Summer Olympics, and in the latter event Benfeito also won a bronze medal in the 10 m platform individual event. Early life Benfeito was born on March 2, 1989 in Montreal, Quebec to Portuguese parents, Arthur Benfeito and Margarida Correia. She has younger twin sisters, Alicia and Chelsea. Career She began diving for Canada in 2005 and credits Emilie Heymans and Alexandre Despatie for inspiring her to take up the sport. She won a bronze medal at the 2005 World Aquatics Championships in her hometown of Montreal, but she and Filion have been unable to return to the medal podium at the Worlds since. In 2006, they won a bronze at the Commonwealth Games. Benfeito won a bronze medal at the 2007 Pan American Games in the 3m Synchronized event with Kelly MacDonald. Benfeito and Filion qualified for the Beijing Olympics after they beat teammates Heymans and Marie-Eve Marleau which was considered a dramatic upset, particularly at defeating Canadian diving legend Heymans. At the 2008 Summer Olympics, the diving partners finished in 7th place. She did not compete in the 2010 Commonwealth Games due to a lingering shoulder injury that had not healed in time. Both the ladies failed to medal at any events leading into the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. At the 2012 edition the two Canadians managed to hold third place through nearly the whole competition in the 10 m platform synchro event. After the medal clinching dive she said that \\"We gave it all we had and we came away with a bronze medal. We're pretty happy with that.\\" A Quebec politician from a provincially sovereigntist party, the Parti Qu√©b√©cois, commented on the medals won by Benfeito and others as the first four medals won were from Quebec athletes. Pauline Marois said that \\"\\"This means, among other things, that it‚Äôs another example of how Quebec could shine among the brightest ... as an independent country. We could continue to win our medals, I‚Äôm sure of that.\\" Benfeito responded to a similar question from Canadian media when asked if she was as proud of the day as all the day's medalists were from Quebec athletes by saying that \\"No, we are one big happy gang. We are equally as proud of our home in Quebec as we are of our home in Canada.\\" At the 2014 Commonwealth Games, she won a gold medal in the 10 m platform synchronised with Fillion, and gold in the 10 m platform individual. At the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Benfeito and Filion repeated their bronze medal performance in the 10 m platform synchro event, while Benfeito won an additional individual medal in the individual platform diving event. Fillion placed sixth in the latter event. Benfeito was named as Canada's flag bearer for the 2018 Commonwealth Games in the Gold Coast, Australia. Personal life Benfeito and Filion have been together as diving partners for a long time and reportedly consider each other as lifelong friends. Filion said of their relationship that, \\"We've known one another for our entire lives, so we have a really good relationship. It's more of a sisterhood relationship now.

It was originally a tram and then a bus depot and had latterly became a venue hosting events such as the Ideal Home Exhibition and the 1981, 1982, 1988 and 1989 Great British Beer Festival, flea markets, travelling fairs and concerts. History Multi-story car park on the former site of Queens Hall The building was originally constructed at the turn of the 20th century and was known as Swinegate Tram Depot. The hall was refurbished as a music venue in 1961 and was a popular venue amongst students and the townspeople of Leeds with a capacity for 5,000 people. The very first event to be held there was the Yorkshire Ideal Home & Food Exhibition (5‚Äì20 May 1961), sponsored by The Yorkshire Post. Over the years the Queens Hall had been as a venue for popular music. Mot√∂rhead complained about the acoustics, and it was uncomfortably cold in winter, with ice forming on the retained tramlines. As far back as the 1980s there was talk of an arena for Leeds and by that time the Queens Hall was in need of extensive modernisation to bring it up to an acceptable standard. The Queens Hall was demolished in 1989 and the site is now mostly used as a surface level car park with redevelopment taking place on part of the site for a multi-storey car park with ground floor restaurant and an office building for BT. Construction work to add two additional storeys to the Criterion Place multi-storey car park began in July 2008. The Leeds Arena, opened in 2013, became a new concert venue in Leeds. Redevelopment Proposals for the redevelopment of the rest of the former Queens Hall site have been ongoing since the 1990s with failed proposals including those from 1995 for an office building designed by Norman Foster for Royal London Insurance and a latter proposal in 2004 for two skyscrapers to be named Criterion Place designed by SimpsonHaugh and Partners to be developed by Simons Estates. Neither of these proposals went to fruition but plans to complete the redevelopment of the former Queens Hall site were realised in 2015 when new business premises called Sovereign Square were built on the site.

D. was written by John Hawkins in 1787. It was the first full biography of Samuel Johnson‚Äîwith Thomas Tyers's A Biographical Sketch of Dr Samuel Johnson being the first short postmortem biography. Hawkins was a friend of Johnson, but many in Johnson's circle did not like him. After Johnson's death, Hawkins was approached to produce a biography on Johnson and an edition of his works. His biography described Johnson's life, including previously unknown details about his writing career, but it was plagued by digressions into unrelated topics. Hawkins's Life of Samuel Johnson came under swift attack from critics, from friends of Johnson, and from his literary rival, James Boswell immediately after its publication. Many of the critics attacked Hawkins for his lack of strict focus on Johnson's life or for his unfavourable depiction of Johnson in various circumstances. Background Sir John Hawkins According to Bertram Davis, \\"For every person who remembers Sir John Hawkins as the author of the first full-length biography of Samuel Johnson, many remember him as the man Johnson once described as 'unclubable'.\\"Davis 1961 p. vii Although \\"unclubable\\" reflects Hawkins's relationship with others of Johnson's circle, Johnson and Hawkins had a close friendship as Miss Reynolds describes: \\"As we were returning from the meadows that day, I remember we met Sir John Hawkins, whom Dr. Johnson seemed much rejoiced to see; and no wonder, for I have often heard him speak of Sir John in terms expressive of great esteem and much cordiality of friendship\\"Reynolds 1897 p. 297-298 Their relationship began around 1739 and they were both involved with The Gentleman's Magazine. In 1749, Hawkins was a member of Johnson's first club: the Ivy Lane club.Davis 1961 p. ix After joining the Ivy Lane club, he married Sidney Storer, heir to a 20,000 pound fortune with Hawkins receiving an addition 10,000 pound dowry, in 1753 and his career started to quickly pick up: he bought a home on the Thames at Twickenham near Horace Walpole; he published Izaak Walton's The Compleat Angler in 1760; he was appointed as a magistrate in 1761; in 1765 became Chairman of the Quarter Sessions for the County of Middlesex; and wrote a A General History of the Science and Practice of Music in 1776. He was knighted in 1772, and served as Chairman of the Quarter Session.Davis 1961 pp. x‚Äìxi Samuel Johnson Even with all the success, or because of it, he was resented among some of Johnson's circle. Hawkins, member of Johnson's second club, the Literary Club established 1764, resigned over a dispute with others of Johnson's circle. The relationship between Hawkins and the rest of Johnson's friends became so tense that many criticised Johnson for choosing Hawkins in 1784 as one of his executors for his will. However, within hours of Johnson's death, Thomas Cadell and William Strahan asked Hawkins to write a biography and an edition of Johnson's literary works.Davis 1961 pp. x‚Äìxii On 16 December 1784, St. James's Chronicle stated Hawkins and Boswell were both writing biographies.Davis 1961 p. xii However, Thomas Tyers published before them when his A Biographical Sketch of Dr Samuel Johnson, the first postmortem biographical work on Johnson but not a full-length biography, ran in the December 1784 issue of The Gentleman's Magazine.Hill 1897 p. 366 This did not deter Hawkins and by 21 December 1784, he began advertising his \\"authentick\\" life of Johnson. This provoked an anonymous articles in St. James's Chronicle started attacking Hawkins: \\"It is evident from the Conduct of the late Dr. Johnson, that he designed Mr. Boswell for the sole Writer of his Life. Why else did he furnish him with such Materials for it as were withheld from every other Friend ... Little indeed did he suppose that a Person whom he had made one of his Executors would have instantly claimed the Office of his Biographer. Still less could he have imagined that this Self-Appointment would have been precipitately confirmed by the Booksellers.\\" The source of the attack was George Steevens, who worked with Johnson on an edition of Shakespeare's plays and was a constant critic of Hawkins. He, along with others, began to spread rumours about Hawkins: some claimed that he stole Johnson's belongings after his death, and others claimed that Hawkins wanted to slander Johnson in his biography.Davis 1961 p. xiii Hawkins house burned down on 23 February 1785, and he was barely able to preserve his notes and Johnson's diaries, which were the foundations for his Life. The work was published in March 1787.Davis 1961 p. xiv St. James's Chronicle and London Chronicle published excerpts for \\"several weeks\\" with the Universal Magazine and the Political Magazine following later. A second edition was published mid-April 1787. Biography The biography is a standard biography describing incidents of Johnson's life. One of the unique features that made Hawkins's Life special was its ability to provide information on Johnson's contributions to The Gentleman's Magazine. The biography revealed details about the events surrounding the early years of the magazine and events that happened between employees, which provided insights into the literary magazine not published before. Boswell was unable to publish his Life until 1791, but when he did he introduced his work with a summary of what he felt Hawkins's biography contained: > Since my work was announced, several Lives and Memoirs of Dr. Johnson have > been published, the most voluminous of which is one compiled for the > booksellers of London, by Sir John Hawkins, Knight, a man, whom, during my > long intimacy with Dr. Johnson, I never saw in his company, I think but > once, and I am sure not above twice. Johnson might have esteemed him for his > decent, religious demeanour, and his knowledge of books and literary > history; but from the rigid formalities of his manners, it is evident that > they never could have lived together with companionable ease and > familiarity; nor had Sir John Hawkins that nice perception which was > necessary to mark the finer and less obvious parts of Johnson's character. > His being appointed one of his executors, gave him an opportunity of taking > possession of such fragments of a diary and other papers as were left; of > which, before delivering them up to the residuary legatee, whose property > they were, he endeavoured to extract the substance. In this he has not been > very successful, as I have found upon a perusal of those papers, which have > been since transferred to me. Sir John Hawkins's ponderous labours, I must > acknowledge, exhibit a farrago, of which a considerable portion is not > devoid of entertainment to the lovers of literary gossipping; but besides > its being swelled out with long unnecessary extracts from various works, > (even one of several leaves from Osborne's Harleian Catalogue, and those not > compiled by Johnson, but by Oldys,) a very small part of it relates to the > person who is the subject of the book; and, in that, there is such an > inaccuracy in the statement of facts, as in so solemn an authour is hardly > excusable, and certainly makes his narrative very unsatisfactory. But what > is still worse, there is throughout the whole of it a dark uncharitable > cast, by which the most unfavourable construction is put upon almost every > circumstance in the character and conduct of my illustrious friend; who, I > trust, will, be a true and fair delineation, be vindicated both from the > injurious misrepresentation of this authour, and from the slighter > aspersions of a lady who once lived in great intimacy with him.\\"Boswell I > pp. 26‚Äì28 Hawkins and Hester Thrale, in Boswell's mind, were rivals to \\"what he considered his domain\\".Davis 1961 p. xviii That is not to say that he was wrong about Hawkins's Life because it does contain many digressions, such as a discussion of sixteenth century breakfast habits written in Latin and a discussion on the history of taverns among others. Hawkins also included long extracts from Johnson's works. Critical response Arthur Murphy, fellow Johnson biographer and reviewer of Hawkins's Life The Monthly Review, the Critical Review, the English Review, and the European Magazine contained reviews that, in the words of Bertram Davis, characterised the biography as \\"a malevolent and spiteful account of Johnson's life, grossly inaccurate, and rendered utterly ridiculous by its pompous legalisms and its digressions on every conceivable subject. The book, if they were to be believed, was less a biography than a polemic, less a work of art than a collection of senile gossip.\\" In particular, the Critical Review said, \\"we often lose Dr. Johnson... The knight sinks under the weight of his subject, and is glad to escape to scenes more congenial to his disposition, and more suitable to his talents, the garrulity of a literary old man.\\"Critical Review June 1787 p. 417 Arthur Murphy anonymously wrote in the Monthly Review: \\"Sir John most probably acquired his notions of language at his master's desk: he admired the phraseology of deeds and parchments, whereof, to speak in his own manner, he read so much, that in consequence thereof, he has been chiefly conversant therein and by the help of the parchments aforesaid, missed the elegance above mentioned, and uses works, that in them we sometimes meet with, and being bred and attorney, he caught the language of the said trade, whereof he retains so much, that he is now rendered an incompetent critic thereby, and in consequence thereof.\\"Monthly Review July 1787 p. 68 Steevens, under the name \\"Philo Johnson\\" claimed in the European Magazine: \\"the great solid principle that secures its condemnation, is the spirit of malevolence to the dead, which breathes all through it. Sir John Hawkins, with all the humanity and very little of the dexterity of a Clare-Market butcher, has raised his blunt axe to deface the image of his friend.\\"European Magazine May 1787 p. 313 A later review in the St Jame's Chronicle joked: \\"it was false 'that Mrs. Hobart had an intention of reading Sir John Hawkins' book. The late hours at which people of rank go to bed, renders it wholly unnecessary to force a sleep in public places.\\"Davis 1961 p. vi This followed with a joke in a later journal: a \\"gentleman, lately arrived in town, has been for several days past afflicted with a lethargy, owing to the perusal of three chapters in Hawkins's Life of Johnson.\\" A third stated: the branches of willow trees planted in Lichfield \\"should be lopped off, and tied in bundles, ... and properly applied to the naked backs of his various biographers, taking care, that the largest bundle be appropriated unto the use and behoof of Sir John Hawkins, Knight.\\" Notes References * Boswell, James.

Career Kulky began boxing in his teenage years. After six bouts, he stopped boxing when he was offered a position training wrestlers at St. Matthew's Lyceum in his native Hastings-on-Hudson. Stanislaus Zbyszko convinced Kulky to compete professionally in 1939. Moving to Argentina, Kulky competed throughout South America under the ring name Bomber Kulkavich. The number of matches in which he competed is uncertain; one claim states that he won 172 of 175 matches. Kulky, however, claims that he won nearly all of 7,000 matches. While in South America, he is also said to have won the continent's judo crown. Like most wrestlers who turned to acting in the 1950s he owed his big break to Mike Mazurki. The two appeared in several parts in the 1940s and 1950s, with Mazurki's agent getting him a part in Call Northside 777. Because of his rather tough guy image, Kulky became typecast as military men, thugs, gangsters, bartenders, wrestlers and other \\"strong guys\\" who were at times quite friendly and lovable characters contrasting strongly with the tough guy image. From 1953 to 1958, he played Otto Schmidlap in the television series, The Life of Riley.Kulky Bio In the series, Kulky portrayed a co-worker of series character Chester Riley, a wing riveter at an aircraft plant. In 1952 he appeared in an episode (#11) of Adventures of Superman, as a wrestler working for a crooked promoter. In 1954 he appeared in an episode (#141) of The Lone Ranger. From 1959 to 1962, Kulky was cast in the recurring role as Chief Max Bronsky in forty-six episodes of Jackie Cooper's CBS military sitcom/drama television series, Hennesey. The role was close to Kulky's heart because during World War II, he was a boatswain's mate in the United States Navy. Kulky's last role was as Chief Curley Jones in the television series Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. Death Kulky died on February 12, 1965 in Oceanside, California, of a heart attack suffered while he was studying a script.

Career  PC-568 was laid down by Brown Shipbuilding Company in Houston, Texas on 15 September 1941, launched on 25 April 1942, and commissioned on 13 July 1942 with Lt. David A. Smith in command. Following a brief period of shakedown training, the submarine chaser reported to Commander, Caribbean Sea Frontier, for duty. The vessel carried out convoy and antisubmarine patrols from Key West and Miami, Florida to various ports in the Caribbean. Among her ports of call were Guantanamo Bay and Havana, Cuba, San Juan, Puerto Rico, Bridgetown, Barbados, Trinidad, Aruba, and Cura√ßao. In April 1943, PC-568 reported to Commander, Eastern Sea Frontier, and began a series of convoy and antisubmarine patrols from New York City to Guantanamo Bay. On 25 March 1944, the submarine chaser departed New York City and proceeded to the United Kingdom. Upon her arrival the ship reported to Commander, United States Naval Forces Europe, and became a member of the 12th Fleet. PC-568 then became involved in preparations for the Allied invasion of France. When the assault troops first went ashore on the beaches of Normandy, on 6 June, the submarine chaser assumed convoy duty in the English Channel and also carried out patrol duty along the French coast. PC-568 operated in the English Channel through June 1945. In that month, she began providing services to American occupation forces in Germany. The ship remained in this role through 4 October, when she set sail from Bremerhaven, Germany, bound for the United States. She visited Plymouth, England, Ponta del Gada, Azores, and Bermuda before arriving at Norfolk, Virginia, on 22 October. Preparations for deactivation of the vessel were then begun at Norfolk. She got underway again on 8 January 1946 to sail to Mayport, Florida. PC-568 was decommissioned on 30 April 1946 and was laid up in the St. Johns River, Green Cove Springs, Florida. In February 1956, the ship was named Altus. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 15 March 1963, and the ship was transferred permanently to the custody of the United States Air Force.

It originally aired in North America on December 2, 2005. It is loosely based on the 2002 short story \\"Death & Suffrage\\" by Dale Bailey.\\"The West Wing and the Living Dead: An Interview with Dale Bailey\\" Plot President George W. Bush is running for reelection during a divisive war, and one of his speechwriters, David Murch (Jon Tenney), goes on TV to speak with talk show host Marty Clark (Terry David Mulligan) and strident right-wing sexpot (and Ann Coulter-like) Jane Cleaver (Thea Gill). Another guest is Janet Hofstader (Beverly Breuer), the Cindy Sheehan-like mother of a dead soldier, who demands to know what her son died for. Murch gets a bit teary-eyed and explains that he lost his older brother Philip (Ryan McDonnell) in Vietnam. \\"Believe me,\\" he tells the grieving mom, \\"if I had one wish, I would wish for your son to come back, because I know he would tell us how important this struggle is.\\" Cleaver is so impressed with Murch's handling of the situation that she takes him out for a drink later, picks his brain, and eventually seduces him. The Karl Rove-like Kurt Rand (Dante regular Robert Picardo) interrupts their tryst, calling to let Murch know that the president plans to make his line part of his stump speech. Soon, the soldiers killed in Iraq do start returning from the dead, and it doesn't go the way Murch predicted. They are not back to feast on the living, but unhappily for the president and his supporters, they just want a chance to vote in the upcoming election. \\"We'll vote for anyone who ends this war,\\" one explains. The spin machine goes into overdrive, but the dead are determined to make their voice heard, even going as far as one soldier killing Kurt Rand by acting out the Lucio Fulci zombie stereotype (gouging his eye and slamming his head into the table) when Rand tried to force him to sign an unwanted document by threatening the soldier's mother. While voting results are being counted during the election, people within the current administration decide to skew the results so the current administration remains in power. After the election results are broadcast, more soldiers begin to return from the dead...but not just ones from Iraq. Soldiers begin to return from previous wars including; World War I and II, the Vietnam War, and the Civil War. Eventually all of the people who died during wartime to protect the United States of America have returned from the dead. The progress of the movie also reveals a shadowy mistake from Murch's past. He believed that his brother Philip was murdered in the Vietnam War, only to discover that it was he who unintentionally killed him long ago with a gun in a game of \\"friend or foe\\". After Cleaver attacks the soldiers with her shotgun, Murch kills her, but fails to kill himself. Murch is countered by a soldier that asks him to join them, saying, \\"We're looking for a few good men.\\" Philip is among those returning from the grave, saying he forgives Murch for killing him--and then snaps Murch's neck. Now one of the zombies, Murch announces that he will show anyone who sends their brothers and sisters to die for a lie the true face of hell.

He was a member of the legitimised House of Bourbon-Maine. Biography Born at the Palace of Versailles on 4 March 1700, Louis-Auguste was the fourth child of Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, duc du Maine and of his wife, Anne Louise B√©n√©dicte de Bourbon. Given the title of prince de Dombes at his birth, he was the second child of his parents to hold the title.An older brother Louis Constantin de Bourbon (1695-1698) had held the title previously. Unlike his father, the prince de Dombes was of high military skill. Louis-Auguste served under the renowned military commander Prince Eugene of Savoy in the Austro-Turkish War (1716‚Äì1718). He also fought in the War of the Polish Succession (1733‚Äì1738) and in the War of the Austrian Succession (1740‚Äì1748). Upon the death of his father (to whom he was very close), on 14 May 1736 at the Ch√¢teau de Sceaux, he inherited the bulk of his wealth and his titles. He became Colonel General of the Cent-Suisses et Grisons (1710), Governor of Languedoc (1737), Grand veneur de France and Count of Eu (1736). In 1750, he gained the titles of prince d'Anet and comte de Dreux, when his mother gave him both estates three years before she died. Little seen at the court of his cousin Louis XV of France, he preferred living at the Ch√¢teau d'Anet, which he continued to embellish. In order to supply water for his gardens, he created a hydraulic system which he installed in the park of the domain near the Eure River. He also enjoyed hunting on his large estate of Eu. Louis-Auguste remained unmarried and died childless. A possible wife had been his cousin, Charlotte Agla√© d'Orl√©ans, daughter of Philippe II, Duke of Orl√©ans and Fran√ßoise-Marie de Bourbon, and another cousin, Louise Anne de Bourbon, daughter of Louise-Fran√ßoise de Bourbon, the duc du Maine's younger sister. Louis-Auguste died on 1 October 1755, at the age of fifty- five, in a duel at Fontainebleau. His younger brother, Louis Charles, was his only heir.

Life His parents, James Elder and Ann Richards, natives of Maryland, moved shortly after their marriage to Hardin's Creek, in the present Marion County, Kentucky, where George, the second of their seven children was born. The Elders were Catholics, and George's early education devolved mainly upon his father. George Elder in his sixteenth year entered Mount St. Mary's College in Emmitsburg, Maryland, to pursue classical studies. Here, he became the friend of William Byrne, afterwards founder of St. Mary's College, Kentucky, in George Elder's hometown. Both studied theology in St. Mary's Seminary, Baltimore, and were ordained priests at Bardstown by Bishop John David on September 18, 1819. In addition to the duties of an assistant at the cathedral there, Father Elder was entrusted by Bishop Flaget with the founding of a high-grade school or college for lay students. This was, at first, a day school and was taught in the basement of the theological seminary (erected in 1818). A separate building was erected in 1820-1823. The college was then one of the largest and best-appointed educational structures in the entire West. (The community of Hardin's Creek would later be renamed \\"St. Mary\\" in its honor.) The arrival, in 1825, of fifty Southern students was the beginning of the extensive patronage the college received from the Southern states, notably Louisiana and Mississippi, and which continued down to the American Civil War. In 1827, the Rev. Ignatius A. Reynolds (later Bishop of Charleston) was appointed president and Father Elder was given charge of the congregation of St. Pius, in Scott County, Kentucky. Dr. Reynolds was transferred in 1830 to pastoral work, and Father Elder again became president, a position which he held until his death. He frequently did duty in the cathedral and was one of the editors of the Louisville Catholic Advocate newspaper (founded 1836), to which he contributed articles on the education of children. \\"Letters to Brother Jonathan\\", half satirical, half controversial, were also the product of his pen. He prosecuted a Presbyterian preacher, Nathan L. Rice, for libeling a Kentucky priest who was then absent in Europe. His last illness followed the burning (25 January 1838) of the main college building.

History  Field dress uniform for members of the 103rd Regiment, 1912. The 103rd Regiment was raised in Calgary as a militia unit. The first commanding officer was Lieutenant-Colonel W.C.G. Armstrong. The regiment was approved to train six companies of 50 men each, and later expanded to eight companies. The unit initially paraded at the former Calgary General Hospital building (today known as the Rundle Ruins) before being ordered to vacate in September 1910. The unit then moved into the former drill hall of the Canadian Mounted Rifles on Centre Street and 12th Avenue SE. In 1911 a new armoury was found, in a former German-Canadian club a block south of their former home at the General Hospital. After Mewata Armouries was completed during the First World War, the regiment moved its offices to that location. War Service At the outbreak of World War I the regiment was not mobilized but served as a recruiting depot to raise battalions for the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF), the first being the 10th Battalion, CEF. The regiment also provided soldiers to man the internment camp at Castle Mountain.Calgary Guardian Article These soldiers were also employed full time as part of the Active Militia.\\"103rd Regiment Internment Guards\\", Banff Crag and Canyon, 2 May 1916 A number of reinforcement battalions were commanded by former 103rd Regiment officers, including Lieutenant-Colonel William Armstrong (56th Battalion (Calgary), CEF) and Lieutenant-Colonel George Morfitt (137th (Calgary) Battalion, CEF). Reorganization The 103rd Regiment was reorganized into two regiments in 1920 (the Calgary Regiment and the Alberta Regiment), each of which was reorganized into two regiments a few years later. None of the new units adopted the rifle regiment traditions of the 103rd. Perpetuations One of the resulting four regiments (the North Alberta Regiment) was disbanded in the 1936 reorganization of the Militia, but three present-day regiments claim descent from the 103rd: the South Alberta Light Horse, the King's Own Calgary Regiment (RCAC) and the Calgary Highlanders. These regiments perpetuate the 10th, 31st, 50th, 56th, 82nd, 89th and 137th Battalions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force all of whom were either raised in, or contained soldiers from, Calgary.

Garden-based learning is an instructional strategy that utilizes the garden as a teaching tool. Hierbas aromaticas The practice of garden-based learning is a growing global phenomenon largely seen in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. As of 2010, the National Gardening Association reported over 3,000 school gardens in the United States alone.Fisher-Maltese C, Zimmerman T. 2015. \\"A Garden-Based Approach to Teaching Life Science Produces Shifts in Students' Attitudes toward the Environment,\\" International Journal of Environmental and Science Education. 10(1): 51‚Äì66. In some settings garden-based learning strategies are used entirely as the educational curriculum for multiple subjects and in others it supports or enriches the curriculum. Garden-based learning can contribute to all aspects of basic education on varying levels depending on the student and consistency of the garden-based learning program. Aspects of basic education benefits include but are not limited to academic skills, personal development, social development, moral development, vocational and/or subsistence skills, and life skills.  Benefits of garden-based learning among children and youth  Landscape designers, teachers, and others consider school and community gardens to be one of the most notable positive trends in the nation today. These environments can foster science literacy and social skills, while enhancing an awareness of the link between plants in the landscape and our, food, clothing, shelter, and well-being.\\"Cornell Garden Based Learning: Resources for Gardeners & Educators\\". 2015 Oct. Ithaca (NY): Cornell University Cooperative Extension: http://gardening.cce.cornell.edu Gardening projects provide children and youth with the carefree exploration of the natural world that occurs rarely in today's era of indoor living; it can also give young people the chance to develop a wide range of academic and social skills. Noted benefits of garden-based learning programs among youth include increased nutrition awareness, environmental awareness, higher learning achievements, and increased life skills. Increased nutrition awareness Research indicates that youth who participate in garden-based learning programs increase their consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, and gain new enthusiasm for fresh, nutritious vegetables they grow. It is the physical act of having the students' plant their own fruits and vegetables that gives them ownership and gets them more involved in their learning. Students can then learn about the nutritional values of food and multiple ways to prepare their own products in healthy ways to further progress their awareness of health issues. These two examples of physical acts of learning are what motivate healthier eating choices in and outside of the school setting.Berezowitz C, Bontrager Yoder A, Schoeller D. July 2015. \\"School Gardens Enhance Academic Performance and Dietary Outcomes in Children,\\" Journal of School Health. 85(8): 508‚Äì518.Gibbs L, Straiger P, Johnson B. 2013.\\"Expanding Children's Food Experiences: The Impact of a School-Based Kitchen Garden Program,\\" Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior. 45(2): 137‚Äì146. = Student Health = Garden view of the Meyer Rothschild Hospital, established at 37 Street of the Prophets, Jerusalem, in 1888. Teachers also regarded the garden to be very effective at enhancing academic performance, physical activity, language arts, and healthy eating habits. Garden-based learning attempts to combat obesity by introducing students to healthy foods and providing opportunities to for outside experiential learning. Gardening intervention in schools may also aid in the improved health of children for the simple reason that students get 20% or more of their daily food intake from school depending on their socioeconomic backgrounds; families with lower income depending on school lunch even more than others.Bontrager Yoder A, Liebhart J, McCarty D. 2014. \\"Farm to Elementary School Programming Increases Access to Fruits and Vegetables and Increases Their Consumption Among Those With Low Intake,\\" Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior. 46(5): 341‚Äì349. Students and teachers have also reported that using GBL programs reduce stress. Reducing stress can result in increased mental health and boosted immune system. A boosted immune system means that the human body is stronger and heals more efficiently. This could help patients recovering from all diseases, wounds, illnesses and more. Hospitals and Primary care facilities would be an ideal spot to incorporate garden based learning. Increased environmental awareness Research highlights that high school students gain more positive attitudes about environmental issues after participating in a school garden program. Gardening has also been shown to increase scores on environmental attitude surveys of elementary school children. Environmental attitude surveys generally include statements like the ones shown below and give the opportunity to rank those statements with a score of 1‚Äì5 (Strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree) The statements differ in complexity based on the grade level. * I am worried about animals that are going extinct. * Trying to protect the environment is my responsibility. * I would come to school on Saturday to plant flowers. Environmental awareness and attitudes toward the environment is also seen to improve especially in urban schools where the garden-based learning programs in the schools may be some of the only times these students can connect with the outdoors away from city streets. Higher Learning Achievements Studies indicate students that participated in school gardening activities scored significantly higher on science achievement tests compared to students that did not experience any garden-based learning activities. Other research has indicated that weekly use of gardening activities and related classroom activities help improve science achievement test scores. The reasoning behind these improvements is connected to the holistic, integrated, hands-on, project based, cooperative and experiential learning activities that are all aspects of garden based education. In other words, student engagement in class is increased because they are being intrinsically motivated by \\"real world\\" experiences in a more informal setting than the classroom.Skinner E, Chi U. 2012.\\"Intrinsic Motivation and Engagement as 'Active Ingredients' in Garden-Based Education: Examining Models and Measures Derived From Self-Determination Theory,\\" The Journal of Environmental Education. 43(1): 16‚Äì36. However, it is important to note the extent to which students improve varies because every student learns differently and has preferred learning styles, which work best for them. Parkdale Community garden volunteer day Increased Life Skills Research has highlighted the many improvements in life skills that can be attributed to children's garden programs. These skills include: enhancement of moral education, increasing appreciation for nature, increasing responsibility, developing patience, increases in relationship skills, and increases in self-esteem, help students develop a sense of ownership and responsibility, and helps foster relationships with family members, peers, and their community.Desmond, D., J. Grieshop, and A. Subramanium. (2002). Revisiting garden based learning in basic education: Philosophical roots, historical foundations, best practices and products, impacts, outcomes, and future directions.  Increased Education for the Disabled  Research has shown that Garden-based learning can help improve important aspects of learning for people with special needs. GBL is used with special ed students to improve memory and motor skills. Some disabled students are not able to learn outside, but GBL inside has just the same impact as it would outdoors. Hands on projects such as Garden-based learning have been used to access a higher learning level for some disabled or special ed students. Keys to successful garden-based learning programs  Studies have been shown that children benefit from garden based learning programs. These benefits could include leadership growth, community involvement, and voluntary education which can lead to increased child development. Researched programs are more effective when one is to work through the entire process to understand how everything works in order. The orders involved in this education from beginning to end include planning, design, application, and review. Some features of garden-based learning programs that develop positive qualities in youth * Positive focus * Children allowed to 'lead the way' in some aspects throughout the process. * Proactive behavior * Responsibility * Availability to program * Gives different view on education/academics or life itself. * Participation * Communication Core uses for garden-based learning Here, this girl may be examining plant life to further her overall scientific knowledge and skills. Basic education uses Academic Skills * To support core academic training, particularly in science and math ‚Äì real world hands on experiences * Enrichment of core curriculum in language arts through introduction of new learning landscapes * To support standards based education in countries with national or regional education standards *Teaching the biology of plant life and how it works. Personal Development (Mental & Physical) * To add a sense of excitement, adventure, emotional impact and aesthetic appreciation to learning * To improve nutrition, diet and overall health * To teach the art and science of cooking with fresh products from the garden or local farms * To re-establish the nature of a shared meal Social & Moral Development * To teach sustainable development * To teach ecological literacy and/or environmental education * To teach the joy and dignity of work * To teach respect for public and private property Vocational and/or Subsistence Skills * To teach basic skills and vocational competencies * To produce food and other commodities for subsistence consumption and trade *To produce crops for food and shelter Life Skills * To teach about food and fiber production in the garden * To engage children in community service and environmental care * To involve students in lessons of leadership and decision making *To involve students in voluntary beneficial situations *To improve problem solving *To improve critical thinking Beyond basic education uses  Besides basic education uses, the gardens can be used for other purposes as well. Community Development * Gardens often serve as a focal point for community dialogue, capacity building, and partnerships through a shared community garden space. * Gardens often organize individuals for action ‚Äì for water delivery, cooperatives, and transportation Food Security * Gardens can address hunger at the individual, family, and community levels through planning, growing, and sharing * Gardens can be the beginning point for teaching and developing food policy Sustainable Development * Gardens are an appropriate arena to introduce children to the interconnections that link nature to economic systems and society Vocational Education * Gardens represent a historic and contemporary model for developing vocational skills in agriculture, natural resource management, and science School Grounds Greening * Gardens provides practical productive strategies to transform sterile school grounds into attractive and productive learning centers through the process of greening * Hands-on activities in outdoor classrooms make learning more interesting while demonstrating other benefits such as decreased absenteeism and discipline problems *Can increase cognitive brain development  Relationship between humans and nature  It has been proven that children are spending less and less time outdoors as new technology is invented. This trend has been seen to impact educational and social aspects of the youth. Spending more time outside has been seen to improve test scores and overall concentration. Having green areas is important to increase a students interest in nature and further help them understand compared to learning in a classroom. It has been studied and proven that students learn more when studying 'hands on'. At the same time, teachers and parents begin to realize the ability of education through nature. Parents and teachers are suggested to give kids an hour of play outdoors for every hour indoors. Nature Provides a wide range of materials for creativity among the human race. It is the humans choice to utilize those materials or not, however using those materials will result in a benefit of education.

Graduated in 1938, he almost immediately made his debut in theater and in film. Soon Tieri became one of the most popular and appreciated young actors, with a predisposition to the comic genre. In cinema Tieri specialized in roles on jealous, irascible, nervous boyfriends, and this characterization limited his career and caused his retirement from films in the late 1960s. His versatility was revealed especially on stage and on television, that at the end of the 1950s gave him notoriety with a successful adaptation of the Dickens' novel Nicholas Nickleby and then as host of Canzonissima in 1960. Companion for many years on the scene of the actress Giuliana Lojodice, later his wife, Tieri formed a stage company with her in 1965 and the couple was very active in multiple projects at theater, radio and TV.

This sept had their royal seat at Maistiu (Mullaghmast) in South Kildare in what is now Ireland. He was the son of D√∫nlaing mac Muiredaig (died 869), a previous king.Byrne, Table 9; √ì Corr√°in, pg.187 He ruled from 869-871. There is much confusion in the king lists during this period for Leinster. Ailill is the first person awarded the title King of Leinster in the Annals of Ulster at his death notice since 838. Francis John Byrne suggests that the root of this apparent confusion lay in the fact that the U√≠ D√∫nlainge kings exercised little real authority due to the aggressions of their western neighbour Cerball mac D√∫nlainge (died 888), King of Osraige. Cerball, while unable to install himself as king of Leinster, was able to prevent any rival king exercising real power there.Byrne, pg.163 In 870 the high king √Åed Findliath (died 879) invaded Leinster and overran it from √Åth Cliath (Dublin) to Gabr√°n.Annals of Ulster, AU 870.2 Meanwhile, his ally Cerball mac D√∫nlainge (died 888) of Osraige invaded Leinster from the west.

Saudi Arabia is reportedly looking to boost its involvement in industries beyond petroleum exporting. The economic cities that have been planned will include housing and living quarters, industry jobs, and entertainment for their residents and will be built to accommodate as many as 2,000,000 people.  The Vision  The idea of this city project goes back to 2006, when the then-King of Saudi Arabia Abdullah bin Abdulaziz visited the province of Ha‚Äôil and ordered the construction and development of a major economic city in it to be named after Ha‚Äôil's first Saudi prince, the late Prince Abdulaziz bin Mousaed. The city's purpose is to develop and refurbish the status of Ha‚Äôil as a major economic center and entertainment hub. The project also aims at providing around 30,000 new job opportunities for the Saudi young youth.  Location and Area  Situated in Ha‚Äôil in the northern part of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia between Aljouf, Tabok, Madina and Al Qassim regions, the SAR30bn Prince Abdulaziz bin Mousaed economic city was originally planned to span 156 million square meters. In 2014, however, the Saudi Arabian Economic Cities Authority (ECA) has announced the cancellation of the contract that has been made with the Kuwait-based Al Mal Capital company to develop the city and that the whole city plan has been revised. As a result of that, some major changes have taken place in the city's plan; the most notable change happened in the project's planned area which has been reduced by 85% to be 18 million square meters. According to the comments of the director of ECA, such changes took places to make the project more realistic.  The Offered Services  Prince Abdulaziz Bin Mousaed Economic City will consist of five major sections that aim at meeting the needs of the investors from the different economic sectors and industries through providing high-end educational, agricultural, industrial, transportation and administrational services as well as luxurious entertainment facilities and amenities. These services will be provided through the following five main sections of the city:  1) Agricultural Zone  This section aims at making good use of Ha‚Äôil's agricultural nature. Ha‚Äôil is known for its abundance of agricultural crops and it contributes a large percentage of the kingdom's production of key crops like potatoes, wheat, corn and dates. In addition to that, the zone is rich with mineral resources which will help even more in shaping it as a major investment attraction. The zone will include also include an advanced center for agricultural researches and studies to help develop and improve the zone's productivity in terms of both quality and quantity.  2) Residential district  With estimated investments that exceed $2.5bn, the residential section of the Prince Abdulaziz bin Mousaed economic city will be a major point of interest for both the investors and the residents of the province as it was planned to comprise 30,000 residential units with the aim of housing 140,000 people.  3) Resorts‚Äô Zone  Due to the area's abundance of historical and cultural sites and the environment that is perfect for hosting hunting seasons, a part of the city will be dedicated for providing entertainment services and facilities to hundreds of thousands of tourists and visitors each year.  4) Educational Services Zone  This zone is planned to provide educational services to around 40,000 students through schools, universities, research centers and training centers. The area's initial planned area was 10 square kilometers.  5) Transportation and Logistics  As Ha‚Äôil represents a meeting point for multiple trade routes, the city will include an international airport, a dry port, a high-end logistics center and a fully serviced station for the road travelers whose number is estimated to be 2.3 million travelers per year with roads‚Äô network that will span 3300 kilometers.  Infrastructure Works  The budget of the infrastructure works of Prince Abdulaziz bin Mousaed economic city exceeds $1.6bn. The services will not only aim at meeting the needs of the residents and visitors of the city, but also it will help reduce the load on the services networks of Hail See also *King Abdullah Economic City *Neom External links *https://www.weetas.com/article/abdulaziz-bin-mousaed- economic-city/ *CNN Money Planned cities Populated places in Saudi Arabia Economy of Saudi Arabia Proposed special economic zones Planned cities in Saudi Arabia ","title":"Prince Abdulaziz Bin Mousaed Economic City"},{"id":"18829336","text":"Bill Warren (born c. 1942), is a former corporate human resource executive with Rockwell International and former President of Monster.com.

With a length of 1690 metres, Rue de la Pompe is one of the longest streets in the 16th arrondissement. It runs from Avenue Paul Doumer (in the district of Muette) to Avenue Foch (in the district of Porte Dauphine). Originally, it was a small way and first mentioned in 1730. For a long time, Rue de la Pompe, which runs from South to North, was together with Rue de Longchamp (which runs from East to West) the main axis of Passy whose terrain was mainly used for agricultural reasons until it became a part of Paris on 1 January 1860.

In direct neighborhood grew up at nearly the same time the writer and caricaturist George du Maurier who was born on 6 March 1834 in Paris. In his first novel Peter Ibbetson (published in 1891), which has some autobiographical tendencies, the author is telling about happy days of childhood in the Rue de la Pompe: \\"Our house, an old yellow house with green shutters and Mansard- roofs of slate, stood between the garden and the street - a long winding street ... on either side of the street (which was called \\"the Street of the Pump\\"), as far as the eye could reach looking west, were dwelling-houses just like our own, only agreeably different; and garden walls overtopped with the foliage of horse-chestnut, sycamore, acacia, and lime; and here and there huge portals and iron gates defended by posts of stone gave ingress to mysterious abodes of brick and plaster and granite, many-shuttered, and embosomed in sun- shot greenery.\\"George du Maurier: Peter Ibbetson (The Heritage Press, New York 1963), p. 17f Not only his granddaughter, the writer Daphne du Maurier, was of the opinion that his depictions brought to life again old Passy and the Rue de la Pompe: \\"Kicky ‚Ä¶ was a happy little boy ‚Äì or so he believed, when fifty years later he wrote about his childhood in Peter Ibbetson ‚Äì and the scents and sounds of pre-imperial Paris, the rumble of wheels on cubbled stones, the crack of a whip, the white dust at the corner of the Rue de la Pompe, the chestnut trees in flower ‚Äì even the small burnt bread, black coffee, and tobacco on the warm spring air ‚Äì rise from the pages of his novel ‚Ä¶\\"George du Maurier: Peter Ibbetson (The Heritage Press, New York 1963), p. VI f Wistfully, George du Maurier has also dealt with the rapid alterations, Passy had been involved - especially as a result of the annexation to Paris on 1 January 1860. 12 years after he had been taken away from his beloved Passy to London by his uncle, his protagonist Peter Ibbetson returns to Passy for the first time: the old house was no more, but in its place a much larger and smarter edifice of sculptured stone. Also from the trusted apple-tree remained the stump only. But the old gate at least had not disappeared. \\"I feasted my sorrowful eyes on these poor remains, that looked snubbed and shabby and out of place in the midst of all this new splendor.\\"George du Maurier: Peter Ibbetson (The Heritage Press, New York 1963), p. 155 The old park hedge, which they often had crossed through a gap inside it, to get faster to and from the Bois de Boulogne, had also disappeared and \\"the very park itself was gone, cut up, demolished, all parcelled out into small gardens with trim white villas, except where a railway ran through a deep cutting in the chalk.

In 1877-1880 it was inhabited by Carlos de Borb√≥n, the Carlist claimant to the throne of Spain, his wife Margarita de Bourbon-Parme, their 5 children and the quasi- court of royal servants, assistants, advisers and secretaries. At that time Rue de la Pompe was home to international politics, intrigues and police surveillance. As the presence of the Carlist claimant was increasingly inconvenient for the French authorities, he was made to leave the country in 1880. Some time afterwards the hotel building was demolished upon construction of Rue de Siam.Francisco Melgar, Veinte a√±os con Don Carlos. Memorias de su secretario, Madrid 1940, p. 44 Some decades letter grew up another writer in the same street - and his childhood memories sound very similarly atrabilious like the narration by Du Maurier: \\"When I stroll around Passy I feel like wandering inside myself and always I am faced with my own childhood.\\"Julien Green: Paris (n.m.), p. 19 With the same melancholy, Du Maurier felt a century before, Julien Green is also writing about the many changes his home has suffered in time: \\"It is amazing how a quarter century could deprive all the former charm from this part of town. I know that it is useless and ridiculous to moan about vanished stones, but my impression is without leniency when I have a look at these tenements which are now occupy the heights in which I remember to have seen many old-fashioned elegant villas, and gardens who kept their silence and the singing of the birds like treasures.\\"Julien Green: Paris (n.m.), p. 22 \\"And when I stroll down from the heights of Passy to the banks of the Seine, I sometimes ask myself where I am and if I have not dreamed.\\"Julien Green: Paris (n.m.), p. 23 Green lived on the left side of Rue de la Pompe (there where the odd numbers are) and visited Lyc√©e Janson de Sailly with number 106, just across the street. Because he heard nothing but English at home (his parents were Americans) and nothing but French in school, Green described the Rue de la Pompe as \\"my Atlantic Ocean\\". Also in opposite to the mentioned high school lived the French general Joseph Jacques C√©saire Joffre (1852-1931) for 10 years, as a commemorative plaque on house number 115 reveals. Virginia Oldoini, Countess di Castiglione, an early photographic artist, secret agent, courtesan and mistress to royalty, was bought a small house on the street by Napoleon III in 1857.

Unlike an ordinary scheme, a formal scheme includes infinitesimal data that, in effect, points in a direction off of the scheme. For this reason, formal schemes frequently appear in topics such as deformation theory. But the concept is also used to prove a theorem such as the theorem on formal functions, which is used to deduce theorems of interest for usual schemes. A locally Noetherian scheme is a locally Noetherian formal scheme in the canonical way: the formal completion along itself. In other words, the category of locally Noetherian formal schemes contains all locally Noetherian schemes. Formal schemes were motivated by and generalize Zariski's theory of formal holomorphic functions. Algebraic geometry based on formal schemes is called formal algebraic geometry.  Definition  Formal schemes are usually defined only in the Noetherian case. While there have been several definitions of non-Noetherian formal schemes, these encounter technical problems. Consequently we will only define locally noetherian formal schemes. All rings will be assumed to be commutative and with unit. Let A be a (Noetherian) topological ring, that is, a ring A which is a topological space such that the operations of addition and multiplication are continuous. A is linearly topologized if zero has a base consisting of ideals. An ideal of definition \\\\mathcal{J} for a linearly topologized ring is an open ideal such that for every open neighborhood V of 0, there exists a positive integer n such that \\\\mathcal{J}^n \\\\subseteq V. A linearly topologized ring is preadmissible if it admits an ideal of definition, and it is admissible if it is also complete. (In the terminology of Bourbaki, this is \\"complete and separated\\".) Assume that A is admissible, and let \\\\mathcal{J} be an ideal of definition. A prime ideal is open if and only if it contains \\\\mathcal{J}. The set of open prime ideals of A, or equivalently the set of prime ideals of A/\\\\mathcal{J}, is the underlying topological space of the formal spectrum of A, denoted Spf A. Spf A has a structure sheaf which is defined using the structure sheaf of the spectrum of a ring. Let \\\\mathcal{J}_\\\\lambda be a neighborhood basis for zero consisting of ideals of definition. All the spectra of A/\\\\mathcal{J}_\\\\lambda have the same underlying topological space but a different structure sheaf. The structure sheaf of Spf A is the projective limit \\\\varprojlim_\\\\lambda \\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\text{Spec} A/\\\\mathcal{J}_\\\\lambda}. It can be shown that if f ‚àà A and Df is the set of all open prime ideals of A not containing f, then \\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\text{Spf} A}(D_f) = \\\\widehat{A_f}, where \\\\widehat{A_f} is the completion of the localization Af. Finally, a locally noetherian formal scheme is a topologically ringed space (\\\\mathfrak{X}, \\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\mathfrak{X}}) (that is, a ringed space whose sheaf of rings is a sheaf of topological rings) such that each point of \\\\mathfrak{X} admits an open neighborhood isomorphic (as topologically ringed spaces) to the formal spectrum of a noetherian ring.  Morphisms between formal schemes  A morphism f: \\\\mathfrak{X} \\\\to \\\\mathfrak{Y} of locally noetherian formal schemes is a morphism of them as locally ringed spaces such that the induced map f^{\\\\\\\\#}: \\\\Gamma(U, \\\\mathcal{O}_\\\\mathfrak{Y}) \\\\to \\\\Gamma(f^{-1}(U), \\\\mathcal{O}_\\\\mathfrak{X}) is a continuous homomorphism of topological rings for any affine open subset U. f is said to be adic or \\\\mathfrak{X} is a \\\\mathfrak{Y}-adic formal scheme if there exists an ideal of definition \\\\mathcal{I} such that f^*(\\\\mathcal{I}) \\\\mathcal{O}_\\\\mathfrak{X} is an ideal of definition for \\\\mathfrak{X}. If f is adic, then this property holds for any ideal of definition.  Examples  For any ideal I and ring A we can define the I-adic topology on A, defined by its basis consisting of sets of the form a+In. This is preadmissible, and admissible if A is I-adically complete. In this case Spf A is the topological space Spec A/I with sheaf of rings \\\\text{lim}_n \\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\text{Spec} A/I^n}=\\\\lim_n \\\\widetilde{A/I^n} instead of \\\\widetilde{A/I}. # A=kt and I=(t). Then A/I=k so the space Spf A a single point (t) on which its structure sheaf takes value kt. Compare this to Spec A/I, whose structure sheaf takes value k at this point: this is an example of the idea that Spf A is a 'formal thickening' of A about I. # The formal completion of a closed subscheme. Consider the closed subscheme X of the affine plane over k, defined by the ideal I=(y2-x3). Note that A0=k[x,y] is not I-adically complete; write A for its I-adic completion. In this case, Spf A=X as spaces and its structure sheaf is \\\\lim_n \\\\widetilde{k[x,y]/I^n}. Its global sections are A, as opposed to X whose global sections are A/I.

Plot Casshern Sins tells the story of a world where robots subjugated humanity after becoming self-aware. Their leader, Braiking Boss, ruled over the world with an iron fist. One day, a mysterious girl named Luna was summoned by the people in order to bring the salvation of mankind. Fearing her as a potential threat, Braiking Boss sent three of his most powerful cyborg warriors ‚Äì Casshern, Dio, and Leda ‚Äì to dispose of Luna. Casshern, the strongest warrior, managed to track down and kill Luna. However, this triggered a cataclysmic event which set into motion the end of the world. Hundreds of years later, the world's atmosphere is filled with poison, and, due to the inability of most remaining humans to reproduce, as well as the constant threat posed by the robots, humanity is on the brink of extinction. Robots fare slightly better, fearing death as much as humans do: the poisonous environment quickly causes their mechanical bodies to rust and corrode, forcing them to regularly replace their damaged parts, if spare parts in good condition can even be found. In this wretched time and place, Casshern, who had disappeared following the assassination of Luna, returns with no memory of who he is or what he had done. Characters Casshern, without his combat helmet and facemask, meets with Ringo, a young girl. Main characters ; : :: The protagonist of the series. He was originally a subordinate of Braiking Boss and the strongest warrior in his robot army. With an advanced cybernetic body and quick reflexes, he can destroy any opponent he comes across. Casshern was ordered by Braiking Boss to assassinate Luna. However, this act triggered a cataclysmic event and Casshern disappeared. Returning hundreds of years later with no memory of who he was, he somehow holds the ability to painfully regenerate from any injury and goes violently berserk when incited. While he travels to discover what has happened, and to redeem himself, he encounters people who have been affected by the cataclysm. He is also confronted by many others who attempt to kill him in the belief that devouring him will save them from ruination. Saddened by the deaths of Lyuze and Ohji, he returns to Luna once more and reminds her that she is salvation to those wishing to find her, and he is death. Before he leaves to wander the world, he warns her that if she and her followers ever forget death, he will return. ; : :: A female robot, she pursues Casshern out of revenge for her sister. Before the cataclysm, her sister Liza was injured by Casshern while trying to protect Luna, and eventually died a slow death from corrosion. However, she hesitates when Casshern willingly allows her the chance to kill him, and is unwilling to do so. Instead, she begins to follow and accompany Casshern on his journey, eventually developing feelings for him. She finally finds Luna with the help of Casshern and the others, but loses respect and interest for Luna as soon as she discovers the true meaning of Luna's \\"salvation\\". She decides to live with Casshern, Ringo, Ohji, and Friender, to spend her last days with them, dying from the ruination. As she dies, she tells Casshern that she is happy that she was able to find peace with him. ; : :: A young girl who befriends Casshern, she manages to maintain her innocence despite growing up in a destroyed world. Despite witnessing Casshern mercilessly destroying a robot in order to save her and hurting her feelings, she continues to have faith in him. Being cared for by Ohji, the two come across Casshern regularly, and witness his endeavors. Devastated, Ringo grows up into a young woman, knowing and accepting death, waiting for Casshern's return. It is hinted, in her last encounter with Leda, that she may have been the baby in Leda's womb. ; : :: A robot technician who spends his time maintaining robots, he is Ringo's guardian. Originally a scientist working under Braiking Boss, he created Casshern, Dio and Leda as an experiment in recreating robotic life in a manner similar to humanity's reproductive method, however Braiking Boss utilized the trio as an advanced strike team and ultimately assigned them the duty of assassinating Luna. Stricken by guilt over what he has caused, he attempts to kill himself, but finds Ringo as a baby and decides to raise her. After finding Casshern, he follows and watches over him. Near the end of the anime, he also loses interest in Luna's \\"salvation\\" and decides to live with the others, trying to make Ringo happy with anything he can do, until his ruin comes, devastating Ringo. ; :: A robot dog who originally stayed with a robot community that peacefully accepted the idea of death. Friender himself does not display any signs of deterioration. After a berserk Casshern destroys the entire community, Friender cautiously follows him, eventually trusting him. He primarily intervenes to stop Casshern whenever he goes berserk. Recurring characters ; : :: A mysterious girl summoned by the human race for salvation, Luna was known as \\"the sun that was named moon,\\" and has been dubbed the \\"Source of Life\\" ‚Äî a living embodiment for the world. Deeming her a threat, Braiking Boss sent Casshern, Dio, and Leda to assassinate her. Casshern successfully does so, triggering the destruction of the world. Amid hints that she continues to exist in some form, Casshern searches for her to find the cause of the state of the world, and the reason behind his apparent immortality. However, when he finds her, she has changed and her dislike of death leads her to kill anyone who reeks of death. :: It is discovered that humans had learned the secret of eternal life when their medical technology advanced. Braiking Boss was repulsed by this and began the extermination of humans. Mankind barely managed to survive through Luna. She granted humans normal lifespans because she believed that without death, humans could not live. Braiking Boss sensed that a number of robots began to worship her as well, so he ordered her assassination which unknowingly set into motion the Ruin. After Casshern killed her, she mysteriously became disgusted and terrified of death and dying. She instead granted immortality to both humans and robots that she deemed to not be \\"reeking of death\\" or to those not too far into the suffering of the Ruin, as discovered when she refused to heal Dune. Luna sought to create a world free of death until all those dying of the Ruin would perish, leaving those who are immortal. ; : :: Braiking Boss was the leader and commander of the robot army. Having dominated humanity for ages, Luna was summoned to stop him. As the one who ordered Luna's assassination, he was the true cause of the world's destruction. Dismissing the rumors of the effects of devouring Casshern, he spends his time following him from afar, watching his actions. At the end of the anime, he and his army find salvation from Luna. As Casshern returns, destroying his army, Braiking Boss fights hopelessly against Casshern. His last words are an order to kill Luna to atone for his sin of causing the ruination of the world. As he dies, he feels content that he is finally receiving justice for causing the destruction of the world. Braiking Boss believed his death at the hands of his former subordinate was a form of divine retribution. ; : :: A robot built identical to Casshern. He, along with Casshern and Leda, were sent to kill Luna, but Dio failed to reach her before Casshern. Influenced by Leda, he plots to halt the ruination by exposing Casshern's secret and to rule the world, taking the place of Braiking Boss. As such, he attempts to organize a robot army. He holds animosity towards Casshern, as they were both created with identical specifications, but Casshern was slightly ahead of him in reaching Luna. Dio refuses to receive Luna's \\"salvation\\" as he discovers his real desire is to defeat Casshern. Unable to deny him, Casshern fights Dio until the latter \\"wins\\" (striking him with a blow that would kill him if he could not regenerate). Satisfied by reaching his goal and knowing his time is almost up, Dio wanders off to wait for death by the ruin, but not before asking Casshern to save Leda for him. Later, his body is found by Leda who dies next to him. ; : :: A female robot created alongside Casshern and Dio, she assists Dio in restoring the robot army, and states that she is affectionate toward him. She intervenes and helps Dio retreat, whenever he begins to step over the boundaries of his well being. Aggressively seeking Luna, she reveals that she, not Dio, is the one with ambition. When she finds Luna, however, the blood she takes deforms her. She tries to take revenge on Luna, but when Casshern appears and reveals Dio's last request to save her, she goes to look for him. Finally she finds Dio's body in the wasteland, where she succumbs to the ruin herself deciding to die next to him with a smile on her face. ; : :: A heavily deteriorated robot in tattered cloth. He is a powerful robot formerly assigned as Luna's bodyguard labelled the \\"God of Death\\". Unable to stop Casshern from killing Luna, he wanders the wasteland solely to find her and seek revenge on Casshern, despite his severe debilitation. After Luna returns, Dune once again resumes his duty as her bodyguard. He is mortally wounded defending against a large force of robots who seek Luna's death; he dies with Casshern, Lyuze, and Ringo by his side. Media Manga A manga adaptation was announced in the September 26, 2008, issue of Jive's Comic Rush Magazine. It began serialization in the December issue, which was published on October 25, 2008. Anime Casshern Sins was first announced at the Tokyo International Anime Fair 2008, where it was confirmed that Madhouse would be in charge of the animation. Soon after, an official trailer was posted online on its official Japanese website. It was announced at Otakon 2009 that Funimation Entertainment would produce and distribute the series for release in 2010, following a subtitled-only release on their video service in late 2009. The show had previously aired on Japan's Chiba TV, TV Aichi, MBS, TV Kanagawa & TV Saitama stations. Casshern Sins had also aired on Singapore's Arts Central channel. According to The Straits Times, the show aired simultaneously with Japan in order to cut down on illegal downloading in Singapore. TV5 airs Casshern Sins in the Philippines. Casshern Sins is distributed in Oceania by Siren Entertainment with an Australian distribution by Gryphon Entertainment, and New Zealand distribution is by Vendetta Films.

Cartoon Network's Adult Swim aired the series as part of the newly revived Toonami block from May 26, 2012 until November 3, 2012. Reception The anime series received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Theron Martin of The Anime News Network gave the series an overall ranking of \\"B+\\", commending the show's style and excellent sound design, while detracting that the show's \\"overstretched plot\\" and grim tone. Another contributor to Anime News Network, Mark Sombillo gave the series a much more mixed review, writing that \\"The pacing of the story is a bit like a learner driver having great difficulty with the clutch, prone to stalling on insignificant parts and just as likely to accelerate uncontrollably past things that could be interesting. The fight sequences are also cumbersome to watch where you're more likely to just see swipes of light to represent that an action has occurred before it skips to the scene where the bad guy is falling apart. And just back to the background music, or rather the bits where it doesn't play, there were just too many elongated silent moments often accompanied by cheap zoom-in shots of the characters with nothing happening.\\" Norman Rafferty of The Escapist published a negative review of the series, stating that the series pleases no one.

United States, 267 U.S. 132 (1925), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court that upheld the warrantless searches of an automobile, which is known as the automobile exception. The case has also been cited as widening the scope of warrantless search. Background During prohibition, officers arranged an undercover purchase of liquor from George Carroll, an illicit dealer under investigation, but the transaction was not completed. They later saw Carroll and John Kiro driving on the highway from Detroit to Grand Rapids, Michigan, which they regularly patrolled. They pursued them, pulled them over, and searched the car, finding illegal liquor behind the rear seat. The National Prohibition Act provided that officers could make warrantless searches of vehicles, boats, or airplanes when they had reason to believe illegal liquor was being transported and that law enforced the Eighteenth Amendment.. The National Prohibition Act required a search warrant for a search of a building. However, this law was revoked in 1933 when Prohibition ended. Decision The Court noted that Congress early observed the need for a search warrant in non-border search situations,267 U.S. at 150-53 and Congress always recognized \\"a necessary difference\\" between searches of buildings and vehicles \\"for contraband goods, where it is not practical to secure a warrant, because the vehicle can be quickly moved out of the locality or jurisdiction in which the warrant must be sought.\\"267 U.S. at 153. The warrantless search was thus valid. The Court held, however, ::It would be intolerable and unreasonable if a prohibition agent were authorized to stop every automobile on the chance of finding liquor, and thus subject all persons lawfully using the highways to the inconvenience and indignity of such a search.... [T]hose lawfully within the country, entitled to use the public highways, have a right to free passage without interruption or search unless there is known to a competent official, authorized to search, probable cause for believing that their vehicles are carrying contraband or illegal merchandise.267 U.S. at 153-54. The Court added that where the securing of a warrant is reasonably practicable, it must be used.267 U.S. at 156. Observation: This comment is no longer valid. See (\\"If a car is readily mobile and probable cause exists to believe it contains contraband, the Fourth Amendment thus permits police to search the vehicle without more,\\" citing ; . That became known as the Carroll doctrine: a vehicle could be searched without a search warrant if there was probable cause to believe that evidence is present in the vehicle, coupled with exigent circumstances to believe that the vehicle could be removed from the area before a warrant could be obtained.In , a vehicle search was sustained under Carroll where the officers had probable cause to believe a vehicle contained liquor, but they waited until the driver showed up to arrest him and search the car. The Court thus rejected Husty's contention that the search was invalid since the police could have obtained a warrant under the circumstances. Husty, 282 U.S. at 701. Underneath their opinion, the majority included a note that Justice Joseph McKenna concurred with them before his retirement earlier in the year.267 U.S. at 163. Justices James Clark McReynolds and George Sutherland filed a dissenting opinion. In brief, they believed that the fact that the case involved bootleggers was prejudicial yet not a justification for creating a broad exception to unreasonable search doctrine.267 U.S. at 163-175. Subsequent events In 1927, the Florida Legislature enacted the Carroll decision into statute law in Florida, and the statute remains in effect.Fla. Stat. s. 933.19 In United States v. Di Re,. the Court declined to extend Carroll to permit searches of passengers in a vehicle that had apparently been lawfully stopped. In Di Re there was no probable cause to believe that the passenger was holding any evidence. The Court relied on Carroll in Cooper v. California. to observe that a search of a vehicle may be reasonable where the same search of a dwelling may not be reasonable. See also *Boyd v. United States, *Chambers v.

It was originated and drawn by J. F. Horrabin, James Francis Horrabin (1884‚Äì1962) who was a British journalist, cartoonist and cartographer, and he was elected Labour Member of Parliament for Peterborough from 1929-1931. He wrote Political books as well as the 'Dot and Carrie' strip for The Star that ran from 1922 to 1964. The Noah Family names are based on religious names, but the cartoon strips have no religious theme. Characters The main Noah Family characters initially were Japhet, a boy, his brothers Shem & Ham, their parents Mr & Mrs Noah. Selina and Matilda were their cousins who lived with them together with Fido the dog. They all lived in a house on Ararat Avenue in South West London, as mentioned on the 1924 book. The human Noah Family characters were styled like wooden puppets with human faces but without elbow or knee joints or fingers. The styling changed in the early years from very skinny and stick-like bodies to the more familiar rounded figures as seen by 1924. An early-introduced character was an elderly gentleman, Mr Cheery, who helped Japhet when he was lost in an early story. His adopted son, Tim Tosset featured in the earlier strips but had left by the time Happy was introduced in c1926-27. Happy was a small fat bear that never spoke, unlike other cartoon animals. Later additions included Oswald the tortoise who had a liking for hiding. Jerry was their odd-job handyman who was an ex-sailor & dressed similarly. Adelaide was an ostrich, Archibald (Archie) was a donkey and Gerald was a goat. Their garden later had a Golobosh Tree brought from a trip visiting the Panjandrum. By the time of a 1950s annual, Cracky the dog & Pukky, a parrot-type bird, were added. Despite the Noah characters names, there was no actual religious theme to the series. The cartoon strips included a whimsical take on everyday life and misunderstandings through the eyes of Japhet including scenes at school and appearing in a Circus. In later annuals from the mid-1930s visits were made to an imaginary African country 'Andamalumbo' where they met His Highness the Grand Panjandrum of Andamalumbo, Lord of the Golden Umbrella, Eater of the Purple Goloboshes, and wearer of the Top Hat (as quoted from the 1933 Annual). The Panjandrum could speak no English, but an invented phrase he used as \\"Welcome\\" was Wamblety Oola. In later stories The Panjandrum and his friend Bom would visit the Noah's in England. Also see Panjandrum for a later use of this Samuel Foote invented word, probably influenced by its popularised pre- War usage in the 'Japhet and Happy' strips. The Arkubs As with other annuals, such as Teddy Tail with the Teddy Tail League, Pip, Squeak and Wilfred with the WLOG and Bobby Bear with the Bobby Bear Club, Japhet and Happy also had a club in the mid-1930s, The Arkubs. The club had a badge, with Happy and AK on it. There were secret codes, hand signs and rules for The Grand United Order of Arkubs. To join the Arkubs, if you were under 15, you had to collect 12 'Happy' Badges from the News Chronicle and send off three pence. You could also get a 'Japhet and Happy' breakfast set of a cup, saucer, plate and egg cup by enrolling 6 new members. Annuals The first book published containing their stories was the 1920 Cassell & Co small format hardback Some Adventures of the Noah Family including Japhet. A large format paperback book The Japhet Book from 1924 (date found from an advert at the back) features 120 cartoon strip reprints. Later Hardback annuals followed with non-annual type titles in 1926 About Japhet & The Rest Of The Noah Family; 1927 Japhet & Co. Including Happy; 1928 Japhet & The Arkubs; 1929 Japhet & The Arkubs At Sea; 1930 Japhet & Co. On Arkub Island. 1931 had the Japhet & Happy Book. The yearly dated Japhet and Happy Annual appeared from 1932 to 1939 (though dated for the following year as typical with Annuals). They featured newspaper reprints and added stories. During the war they changed in format. The 1940 annual was undated, but portrait style, like those that preceded it. In 1941 the annual switched to landscape. From 1942 they slimmed considerably, perhaps due to paper shortages. In style they became reprinted cartoon strips with songsheets at the end, having dropped the longer stories. After the war from 1946 to circa 1951 they continued as undated annuals, mostly in the smaller landscape style, but with two in a larger format in similar size to the 1924 one. For book collectors, the hardback annuals 1926 to 1934 were of a smaller size than the later hardback ones. The slim landscape format hardback books are from 1941 onwards. Also issued were at least 3 'Holiday Annuals', 'The Noahs on Holiday with Japhet', 'The Japhet Holiday Book' and 'The Japhet and Happy Holiday Book'.

He lost his life along with 10 other mountaineers following an avalanche on the descent, in the deadliest accident in the history of K2 mountaineering.The most deadly climbing season on K2 was in 1986, when thirteen climbers died in seven separate accidents. See Biography McDonnell was born in Kilcornan, County Limerick. A decade before his K2 success, he had moved to Anchorage, Alaska. He hoped not only to work there but also to develop his skills as a mountaineer. McDonnell was well known in Anchorage's Irish community. Among his interests was playing the bodhr√°n in a band. He was described as a \\"philosopher\\" and a \\"great storyteller\\". McDonnell summited Mount Everest with Mick Murphy in 2003. He was unsuccessful during an earlier attempt on K2 in 2006 when he was hit by a rock and airlifted to hospital. Irish President, Mary McAleese was among the dignitaries to pay tribute to him following his successful Everest climb in 2003 and in 2008 following his death. McDonnell's group had been on a mammoth expedition for eight weeks, surviving in sub-zero temperatures. In an online despatch, he said that after the team set 31 July as their date for the summit bid, spirits were high. \\"Let luck and good fortune prevail, fingers crossed,\\" he wrote. However, following the avalanche, a serac fell, cutting all the fixed lines on his and his fellow members of the Dutch-led Norit K2 Expedition's path. It was said by the surviving members of McDonnell's team that he refused to descend because he was helping the others that were injured. Expedition leader Wilco van Rooijen, a 40-year-old Dutch climber who was airlifted to a military hospital in Pakistan after surviving the accident, said that poor preparations had contributed to the disaster. He suggested that advance climbers laid ropes in the wrong places on the mountain, hampering the climb of several teams of mountaineers and ultimately contributing to deaths of three of the climbers on his team. \\"Everything was going well to camp four, and on summit attempt, everything went wrong,\\" said van Rooijen from his hospital bed in the Northern Pakistani town of Skardu. \\"The biggest mistake we made was that we tried to make agreements. Everybody had his own responsibility and then some people did not do what they promised. With such stupid things, lives are endangered.\\" He singled out another team for only bringing half the length of rope they were supposed to. Ger McDonnell's satellite phone was given to Pemba on the summit and he brought it along with McDonnell's camera back to base camp. Mr McDonnell's partner, brother JJ and sister Denise flew to Islamabad in search of answers. Whilst McDonnell's body was not recovered, a memorial service was held in Kilcornan on 17 August 2008. McDonnell's mother, brother, partner, van Rooijen and Pat Falvey later appeared on The Late Late Show on 3 October 2008. In 2009, a memorial fund was set up in his honour to provide first-aid training and safe climbing technique for high-altitude porters. In 2012, Damien O'Brien (married to McDonnell's sister Denise), wrote a book about McDonnell, \\"The Time Has Come: Ger McDonnell ‚Äì His Life & Death on K2\\", published by The Collins Press. The book was launched in McDonnell's hometown of Kilcornan, County Limerick, on Friday 30 March with most of the town in attendance. Mike Barry, the first Irish person to walk to the South Pole, officially launched the book while others in attendance included Clare O'Leary, Wilco van Rooijen, Cas van de Gevel and Maarten van Eck.

First used in autumn 2004, the test allows schools to compare the academic abilities of students, including how a student performs under pressure. Some schools use it to help determine which students receive a scholarship. Format The exam tests many of the same academic skills as the COOP and HSPT exams. The test is also very similar to the TerraNova tests which are given every year to NY school students in early October. The major areas that are covered on the TACHS are reading, language, mathematics, and general reasoning ability skills. Administration Every year the TACHS test normally takes place in early November, with the results coming back in January and February. The test is administered to grade 8 students for admission into the next year's freshman class. Application Students are limited to applying to three high schools. Part of registration includes entering the TACHS school code for the schools the student wishes to send scores to. Scores can be forwarded to Archdiocese of New York (New York City & Westchester), Diocese of Brooklyn (Brooklyn & Queens), and Diocese of Rockville Centre (Long Island) high schools, as well as certain independent schools.

He was the son of John Seymour (1792-1876) and Sarah (Montgomery) Seymour (1793-1824). He was born and educated in Stillwater following which his family moved to Fredonia. In the spring of 1835 he began work as an axman on one of the engineering parties engaged in making the first surveys for the New York and Erie Railroad, soon after was promoted to rodman, and by the end of the year had become an assistant engineer. He spent one year at the Fredonia Academy when in 1837, construction stopped on the NY & Erie RR due to lack of funds. In 1838, he was made Division Engineer, and later became Chief Engineer of the Dunkirk and State Line Railroad. On December 23, 1840, he married Delia S. French (1821-1884) and they had six children: Florence (Mrs. Theodore W. Bayaud), George French, Hanson Risley (died as an infant), James Montgomery (\\"Mont\\"), Jeanie (Mrs. Jean G. P. Blanchet), and Silas Jr. About 1851 he became Chief Engineer and was for some time General Superintendent of the Buffalo and New York City Railroad, extending from Hornellsville to Buffalo, New York, and he designed and constructed the bridge across the Genesee River at Portage, New York. He was New York State Engineer and Surveyor from 1856 to 1857, elected on the American Party ticket. In March 1856, he repudiated the nomination of former President Millard Fillmore as the American Party's candidate for the presidency. In 1858 he established himself as Consulting Engineer in New York City. He was appointed Chief Engineer of the Washington and Alexandria Railroad, and constructed a bridge across the Potomac. In 1860, he supported Stephen A. Douglas for President, and expressed in a letter to Col. John W. Forney his opinion, that slavery should continue in the South, and that the South and the North should compromise or have separate governments. In 1863, he became Consulting Engineer, and later Chief Engineer, of the Washington Aqueduct. In the winter of 1863-1864, he was Consulting Engineer of the Union Pacific Railroad. He designed the high bridge over Dale Creek Ca√±on, near the summit of the Black Hills of the Rocky Mountains. From 1868 to 1871, he was Consulting Engineer of the Adirondack Railroad in New York and was reappointed in 1882. From 1871 to 1878 he was Consulting and Acting Chief Engineer of the North Shore Railway in Canada. The North Shore railway was the part of the Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa and Occidental RR that ran through Quebec. On his return to the U.S. in 1878, he was successively President of the Massachusetts Central Railroad and Consulting Engineer of the West Shore Railroad. He was New York State Engineer and Surveyor again from 1882 to 1883, elected in 1881 on the Republican ticket, but defeated for re-election in 1883 by Democrat Elnathan Sweet. He retired to Danville, NY and died at the residence of his son, Silas Seymour Jr. (b. 1860), at 458 West 22nd Street in New York City. At the time of his death, he was Consulting Engineer of the Cape Cod Ship Canal and interested in railroads in Florida. He is buried at Mount Hermon Cemetery in Sillery, Quebec, Canada.

The alternative spellings are derived from the German and French were entrenched works -- an earthen rampart dotted with small outworks -- along the river Lauter. They were built in 1706 and lasted into the 19th century. History Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine, commander of the Army of the Rhine holds a council of war at the Wissembourg lines. The Lines were in length and stretched from Wissembourg on the west to Lauterbourg on the east, where they were anchored on the Rhine River. The French built this chain of fortifications during the War of the Spanish Succession under the orders of the Duke of Villars in 1706. During the War of the Austrian Succession the loss of the Lines by the French played a pivotal role in the campaign of 1744. French King Louis XV, in command of an army of 90,000, captured Menen and Ypres and prepared to invade the Austrian Netherlands. He was forced to abandon his invasion plans when Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine, assisted by the veteran Otto Traun, skillfully manoeuvred his army over the Rhine near Philippsburg on July 1, and captured the Lines of Wissembourg. This move cut off an army under Louis, Prince de Conti from Alsace. Although Conti managed to fight his way through the enemy at Wissembourg and posted himself near Strasbourg, Louis XV abandoned the invasion of the Southern Netherlands, and his army moved down to take a decisive part in the war in Alsace and Lorraine. The Lines were still militarily and strategically significant during the French Revolutionary Wars. The Lines were stormed on 13 October 1793 by an allied army under Austrian General Dagobert von Wurmser in the First Battle of Wissembourg. The allies were in their turn dispossessed by Lazare Hoche and Charles Pichegru in a second Battle of Wissembourg on 26 December and forced to retreat behind the Rhine. notes that Charles Pichegru was in command of the assaulting French sources. In 1815, after the Battle of Waterloo, the Austrian Army of the Upper Rhine advanced into France. On 25 June the Crown Prince of W√ºrttemberg, commander of the Austrian III Corps, advanced towards the Lines in two columns. The first column assembled at Bergzabern, and the second moved forward by Niederotterbach. Count Wallmoden was directed to advance upon Lauterbourg. The Crown Prince advanced his Corps still further along the Hagenau road. His advanced guard pushed on to Inglesheim, and the main body of the III Corps reached the Lines. The French under General Jean Rapp abandoned the Lines in the night and fell back upon the Forest of Hagenau, occupying the large village of Surbourg. By 1870 the Lines no longer existed, but the two central forts in the towns of Wissembourg and Altenstadt, still possessed fortifications that proved useful defensive positions during the Battle of Wissembourg. On 4 August 1870 the Germans under the Crown Prince of Prussia, afterwards the emperor Frederick III, gained the first victory of the war over a French corps (part of the army commanded by Patrice de MacMahon) under General Abel Douay, who was killed early in the engagement.

Statement of the valuative criteria  Recall that a valuation ring A is a domain, so if K is the field of fractions of A, then Spec K is the generic point of Spec A. Let X and Y be schemes, and let f : X -> Y be a morphism of schemes. Then the following are equivalent:EGA II, proposition 7.2.3 and th√©or√®me 7.3.8.Stacks Project, tags 01KA, 01KY, and 0BX4. #f is separated (resp. universally closed, resp. proper) #f is quasi- separated (resp. quasi-compact, resp. of finite type and quasi-separated) and for every valuation ring A, if Y' = Spec A and X' denotes the generic point of Y' , then for every morphism Y' -> Y and every morphism X' -> X which lifts the generic point, then there exists at most one (resp. at least one, resp. exactly one) lift Y' -> X.

It is part of the saat bas bhaichara grouping of 7 villages. The village has 4 panna/patti (subdivisions), named as Nangalia Panna (dominated by Garhwal gotra ), upparla Panna (dominated by Duhan gotra), parla Panna (dominated by Sheoran gotra), etc. with a total revenue land area of 43903 kanal or 5487 acre as per HALRIS records. It is situated from the state capital Chandigarh, from the national capital Delhi, from the district headquarter Hisar, from Bhiwani and from the Tosham Hill range beginning at Khanak. History Archaeological Survey of India's explorations, as reported in the \\"Indian Archaeological Review 1978-79\\" (page 8), found early historical and late medieval artifacts at Kanwari. Late medieval artifacts included 9th and 10th century temple [of Kaumari in Nagara architecture from the times of Tomara dynasty rule who were vassals of Pratiharas until 10th century].1980, , Indian Archaeology 1978-79 a review, Archaeological Survey of India, page 8. The earliest extant historical reference to the Tomaras rule in Haryana occurs in the Pehowa inscription issued during the reign of the Pratihara king Mahendrapala I (r. c. 885-910 CE). Inscription states that Jaula of the Tomara family became prosperous by serving an unnamed king; and his descendants were Vajrata, Jajjuka and Gogga; Gogga was a vassal of Mahendrapala I; Gogga and his step-brothers Purna-raja and Deva-raja constructed three Vishnu temples at Prithudaka (Pehowa) on the banks of the Sarasvati River (Ghaggar River). F. Kielhorn suggested that this Tomara family actually resided in Delhi: they may have visited Pehowa on pilgrimage, and built a temple there. The medieval temple of dhok of village ancestor deity at Kanwari explored by ASI in 1978-79 is called the Bua Kanwari Dham , where newlyweds go for blessings before entering the village. Dhok is also called Bhaiyan and Jathera. Dhok (Haryanvi: ‡§ß‡•ã‡§ï worship) comes from the word ‡§¶‡§π‡§ï, which means the sacred fire. Bhaiyan (Haryanvi: ‡§≠‡§à‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Å) from ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§Æ‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ means from the earth. Jathera (Punjabi: ‡§ú‡§†‡•á‡§∞‡§æ from ‡§ú‡•á‡§∑‡•ç‡§†) means the elder or ancestor. A modern temple has been built on top of the earlier temple and medieval sculptures have been preserved in the temple complex. The village was established by the Garhwal Kingdom ( ‡§ó‡§¢‡§º‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤ ‡§ó‡•ã‡§§‡•ç‡§∞ )ancestors with likely connections with tomar kingdom of Garhwal Kingdom. The foundation temple put by Garhwal kingdom was name Dada kheda is of Garhwal Gotra. Kanwari also has an old Baba Shri Giri Shiva temple with a monastic akhara for the sadhus (Hindu mystics). After Independence of India in 1947, Kanwari became part of Punjab. Once Haryana was formed as a separate state in 1966, Kanwari became part of the Hisar district. Demographics As per a July 2010 official report, Kanwari has 1,147 households with a total population of 5,733 with 1,196 Scheduled Caste inhabitants. As per 2001 census, Kanwari had 896 households and a population of 5,119. There were 2,712 males and 2,407 females. 835 people were below the age of 6. The number literate were 2,655, of which 1,739 were male and 916 were female. The working population was 2,581.

Revenue, Agriculture, Health and Other Services There is a Patwari (Government Land Records Officer), an Agriculture Development Officer (ADO), a Rural Health Officer (RHO), and an Anganwadi (Community Childcare) worker based at Kanwari. There is Kanwari Yuva Mandal (Kanwari Youth club) established in 1990 by the youths of the village to spread the social awareness among the villagers about the importance of education, their rights and creation of attitude for a positive change. Currently, Baljeet Jangra is the Pardhan (Chairman) and Sudarshan Sheoran is the Cashier for the same. It received an award for the Best Yuva Mandal in the Hissar district. Jan Sahayak e-Governance Services Government of Haryana services are accessible via their Official website. Government of India e-governance services can be availed online at their website for various govt departments including land & revenue (land rights and ownership records), transport (driving license and vehicle registration), health (birth and death certificates), public health (water and sewage connection), food (ration cards), Power (electricity connection) and HUDA or Municipal Committee/council (house tax and building plans), etc. Education Kanwari has a two government schools, a private government approved teachers training college and few more private schools. * Government Girl's High school (former co-ed Govt school) * Government Senior Secondary Government school for Boys * There are 2 private schools in the village, e.g. J.D. Senior Secondary School) * RDS College of Education that imparts Bachelor of Education (B.Ed) degrees * There is a Government Degree college at Nalwa (6 km or 4mile from Kanwari) * There are many more schools institutes and 3 universities at Hisar (city) (24 km or 17 miles from Kanwari). Climate Kanwari is a semi-arid region and agriculture is supported mainly by canals and ground water irrigation. Kanwari lies away from the northeast edge (bagar tract) of the Thar Desert.http://cgwb.gov.in/District_Profile/Haryana/Hissar.pdf Hot winds, locally known as 'Loo', are strong and frequent from May to July. Intermittent dust storms are common. In the winter some rain is received due to western disturbances. The Sunder Branch of Western Yamuna Canal (originating from Yamuna river) passes through the agricultural fields of Kanwari on the eastern side between Kanwari and Muzadpur villages, and goes towards Balawas village. Kanwari has a continental climate, with very hot summers and relatively cool winters. Summer starts in April and lasts till the middle of October. May is the hottest month, with the maximum day temperatures in the range. Hisar experiences a weak monsoon, from late June to September, with about of rain. Winter starts in November and is mild and sunny, although temperatures may reach freezing on some nights. Main ecological issues are desertification, deforestation, encroachment and land grabbing of common Panchayat forest and grazing land called \\"bani\\". Fauna Animals and bird of various species are found including sparrow, large Indian parakeet, parrot, crow, rat, rabbit, nilgai (state animal of Haryana), pied crested cuckoo, koel, pheasant, kingfisher, bulbul and Indian magpie robin. The national bird of India, the common peafowl (mor) is quite common and is seen in the fields and common village land. Reptiles Snakes: The poisonous snakes like common krait, Russel‚Äôs viper, phoorsa and other snakes like blind snake, John‚Äôs sand boa, wolf snake, rat snake and sand snake are found around the village. Lizards The common lizards can be seen in the houses. Kirla or girgit is found in the hedges and attracts the attention by changing its colours. Sanda is found in sandy areas. Amphibians Two species of tortoises found are black pond turtle and three-striped pond turtle in around village and the common frogs found in the village are Indian bull frog, Indian cricket frog, Indian burrowing frog and common toad. In May 2007, Kanwari villagers stopped a transport truck full of cattle, rescued the cattle (which were on their way to the slaughterhouse), and set the truck on fire. The slaughter of cows is not permitted in the Hindu religion, as the cow is sacred and worshiped by the Hindus as mother (giver of life-nurturing milk). Bua Kanwari temple The Bua Rani Kanwari Dham is a temple complex of the village deity called 'Bua Kanwari' (Virgin Deity) where newlyweds go for blessings before entering the village. During renovations of the Bua Kanwari temple carried out in 2001 to 2003, ancient stone statues of Hindu deities were found. These stone statues are yet to be scientifically dated or examined by trained archaeologists. The statues are stored in the basement under the temple.

The reserve study consists of two parts: the physical analysis and the financial analysis. This document is often prepared by an outside independent consultant for the benefit of administrators (Board of Directors or Strata Council Members) of a property with multiple owners, such as a condominium association or homeowners' association (HOA), strata, containing an assessment of the state of the commonly owned property components as determined by the particular association's CC&Rs; and bylaws. Reserve studies however are not limited only to condominiums and can be created for other properties such as resort (shared vacation ownership) properties, apartment buildings, worship facilities, private schools, private (golf/social) clubs, and office parks. Reserve studies are in essence planning tools designed to help the board anticipate, and prepare for, the property's major repair and replacement projects. For example, such projects would include: replacement of the roof on the building(s), replacement of the boiler, retrofit of the fire alarm devices, and resurfacing of the roadways. In some jurisdictions across Canada, a reserve study is also sometimes referred to as a \\"reserve fund study\\", \\"contingency reserve fund study\\", or \\"replacement reserve study\\" and, in British Columbia, the legislation refers to this type of study as a \\"Depreciation Report\\".  Purpose  The purpose of a reserve study is to give those overseeing the maintenance of the property a better idea of what major expenses to expect and an educated estimate of when these expenses will occur. With this knowledge, the homeowners' association board or manager can create a budget so association members will make their fair share of reserve contributions, designed to offset the slow but steady ongoing reserve component deterioration of the association assets, and avoid being surprised by components that deteriorated often in plain sight and over a number of years. In addition, the reserve study provides important annual disclosures to association members (and prospective buyers) about the condition of common area components, and the level of preparedness (strength) of the reserve fund (typically measured in terms of Percent funded). A reserve study is a roadmap that allows decisions to be made which will be efficient and effective for the long term. The International Capital Budgeting Institute has established standards for calculating percent funded. There are three methods of making this calculation, and differences between reserve practitioners can, unfortunately, result in significant differences in the percent funded amount.  Results  There are three results from a reserve study: # A listing of the major components of the association to be funded through reserves, their expected useful life, remaining useful life, and current replacement cost (yielding the \\"scope and schedule\\" of the reserve projects). # An evaluation of the current strength of the reserve fund (commonly expressed as \\"percent funded\\"). # A recommended multi-year reserve funding plan.  Relevance  Reserve studies are required by the board or manager for due diligence, disclosure, and budget and planning purposes. An increasing number of U.S. states and Canadian provinces today require some form of reserve planning or disclosures. In addition to requiring a minimum 10% of the total budget be dedicated to reserve contributions, Fannie Mae and the Federal Housing Administration may ask for a current reserve studies (to demonstrate that the association has dedicated sufficient funds to caring for the ongoing needs of the property) to be approved for FHA insured loans and Fannie Mae lending products and services. State reserve studies In addition to being helpful planning tools, reserve studies for Community Associations are legally mandated in 30 states (such as California, Florida, Hawaii, Nevada, Virginia, Washington, etc.), either for budget preparation or homeowner (and prospective homeowner) disclosure purposes. In California, the relevant law is California Civil Code 5300. In California, the law requires an annual reserve study Update, with that update prepared on the basis of a \\"diligent visual site inspection\\" at least every third year. With the passing of SB 278 in 2010, the state of Utah also requires condominium and community associations to conduct and review reserve studies on a periodic basis.http://reservestudygroup.com/law reserve contributions are often one of an association's largest budget line items (often 15-40% of the total budget), and the reserve fund is typically the association's largest financial asset. This means annual review of reserve contributions and annual disclosure of the status of the reserve fund are prudent. The State of Nevada has adopted specific statutes related to reserve studies, which are set forth in NRS 116. These statutes also require that reserve preparers in Nevada be registered and background checked by the State Department of Real Estate.http://www.reservestudy.org/category/reserve-study/reserve-study-laws- in-united-states/reserve-study-laws-in-nevada/ International Capital Budgeting Institute Since Reserve Studies help associations make fiscally responsible decisions, navigating to a successful future, a consistent high quality of Reserve Studies is desired. While foundational Reserve Study industry standards have existed since 1998 (see and ), a small group has proposed a new set of standards. While intended as progress, as-of this writing, these 2015 standards have yet to be embraced or adopted by the industry as a whole. For more see The International Capital Budgeting Institute (ICBI). According to their web site, a Reserve Study \\"funding plan should be prepared on the cash flow basis\\"; however, the purpose of the financial portion of Reserve Studies is to calculate \\"the current status of the reserve fund and a stable and equitable funding plan to offset ongoing deterioration, resulting in sufficient funds when those anticipated major common area expenditures actually occur\\" (see above). Because cash flow analysis concerns itself only with actual transactions, it mathematically cannot be used for future planning of any costs that change with time, regardless of whether those changes result from actual changes in costs or inflation, unless it is revised often with updated future costs. In addition, because future cost estimates based on cash flow analysis are linear, while inflation is not; mathematically, using cash flow calculations to determine reserve deposits cannot calculate required deposits that equitably distribute costs among owners in proportion to their ownership, cannot assure that sufficient funds will always be available when they are needed, and cannot accurately determine current status. US FHA On June 30, 2011, the Department of Housing and Urban Development published Mortgagee Letter 2011-22, which made reserve studies mandatory for all new condominium conversions applying for FHA insured loans approval, including gut and non-gut rehabilitation conversions. This new guideline went into effect September 1, 2011. Condominiums must demonstrate that at least 10% of the yearly assessment income be dedicated towards reserve contributions. The FHA enforces the 10% budget line item requirement nationally by prohibiting lending in developments that are non-compliant with this requirement. Additionally, Mortgagee Letter 2011-22 stipulates all other condominiums requesting FHA project approval may be required to submit a current (completed within the last 24 months) reserve study at their discretion or whenever financial documents do not appear to meet sufficient funding requirements of the condominium association. Fannie Mae On December 1, 2010, Fannie Mae published Announcement SEL 2010-16. The new guidelines outlined in the announcement went into effect March 1, 2011. The guidelines made reserve studies mandatory for all newly converted, non-gut rehabilitation condominium developments to be eligible Fannie Mae project approval.PDF file All other types of condominiums have the option to submit a compliant reserve study or must add a budget line item for reserves equal to 10% of the yearly assessment income. Canada In Canada the legislation governing condominium and strata corporations is provincial. There are no national standards conducting reserve professionals with respect to conduct, reporting, methodology, calculation formula other than those of specific professional organizations. The absence of a national organization of reserve planner professionals has resulted in reserve study reports containing vital financial information being prepared using simplistic spread sheet applications and forecasts which are not compliant with financial reporting requirements of Financial Reporting & Assurance Standards Canada. A Reserve fund study is a financial document which is likely to be reviewed by an auditor and must meet these standards. The reserve fund study also requires technical expertise with respect to building structure and systems. It is for this reason that these reports are primarily prepared by engineers, architects, appraisers, building inspectors etc. The Capital Budgeting process with respect to reserve management planning has clarified in the International Capital Budgeting Institutes (ICBI) Generally Accepted Reserve Study Standards published April 2015. The ICBI reserve study standards are very specific with respect to the information to be contained in the report and the calculation methods used in providing financial forecasts. The standards are also specific as to the software used to create the financial forecasts. A reserve professional providing reserve study/depreciation reports which comply with these standards must use the formulas provided by ICBI. Associated Reserve Planners of Canada Inc. (ARPC) is a national group of reserve study providers of various vocations and professional designations. ARPC members have adopted the ICBI standards and incorporated them into the reserve management planning process. All members use Reserve Fund Analysis software RFA Pro as it has been independently audited by a national accounting firm and meets all the requirements of the ICBI Generally Accepted Reserve Study Standards. Report templates and all financial reports as required by the standards are included in the RFA Pro analysis system.  Funding methods and objectives  There are several reserve study funding methods and goals. These methods may be used to develop a funding strategy that corresponds with the risk tolerance of the community. In National Reserve Study Standards terminology,http://www.caionline.org/about/designations_rs.cfm there are two basic ways to calculate contributions: \\"Cash Flow\\" or \\"Component\\" (also known as \\"Straight Line\\"). In the same National reserve study Standard terminology, there are four funding objectives: Full funding, Threshold funding, Baseline funding, and Statutory funding. Due to its greater computational flexibility and its ability to allow the user to focus on and achieve any of the four funding Objectives, the \\"Cash Flow\\" Method has seen significant growth in popularity. The four Funding Objectives (excerpted from National Reserve Study Standards)are as follows: * \\"Straight Line funding\\", also called \\"Component Funding\\", is a method of calculating the required contributions to reserves by an annuity for each component. If a component is fully funded, the contribution will offset the depreciation of the component. If all the components are fully funded, the depreciated property value, plus the reserve fund, will total the full present value of the property. * \\"Baseline funding\\" describes the objective to have sufficient reserves on hand to never completely run out of money. This is sometimes described as a \\"cash-positive\\" plan. With less cash in reserves on-deposit, associations with a baseline funding objective have higher instances of special assessments and/or deferred maintenance.http://www.arpc.ca/Resource_Library.html * \\"Threshold funding\\" describes an objective chosen by the board other than the 100% (Full funding) level or just staying cash-positive (Baseline funding). This may be a specific Percent Funded target or a cash balance target. Threshold funding is often a value chosen in between Full funding and Baseline funding. * \\"Statutory funding\\" describes the pursuit of an objective as described or required by local laws or codes. All funding objectives are designed to meet exactly the same expenses outlined in the reserve component list. Thus the expenditures are identical, only the size of the reserve fund through the years is different. This means the size of reserve contributions between different reserve funding objectives is often relatively small (typically only 10‚Äì15%). Qualifications & Levels of Service Reserve studies can be created by volunteer board members, their professional managers, obtained through a variety of professionals specializing in the preparation of reserve studies, or large architectural or engineering firms who complete reserve studies as a small aspect of their larger business. Recently, certification criteria have been created to allow for a more ordered system of identifying those individuals who have been specifically trained in the creation of reserve studies. One such certification, that of Reserve Specialist (RS), is available through the Community Associations Institute (CAI). To obtain this certification, candidates must have prepared at least 30 reserve studies within the past 3 calendar years, hold a bachelor's degree in construction management, architecture, or engineering (or something equivalent based on experience and education), and complied with various other rules and codes of conducts. Another credential is the Professional Reserve Analyst (PRA), created and promoted by the reserve study industry's own trade organization, the Association of Professional Reserve Analysts (APRA). The PRA was the first accrediting body for Reserve Professionals. The PRA credential is similar in that it takes years, demonstrated experience, and compliance with standardized terminology to obtain although the experience levels are a bit higher than that required for the RS and their efforts include studies both inside and outside of the homeowner association industry. APRA also requires its PRAs to maintain proficiency with continuing education. In Canada there are several designations and training programs. The Real Estate Institute of Canada (REIC) offers the Certified Reserve Planner (CRP) program, which is the only nationally accepted specialty designation listed in provincial (some provinces) legislation as qualified. Members of the Appraisal Institute of Canada (AIC) must use the methodology and standards of the REIC program if they wish to complete the report. This includes preparing a Benchmark Analysis and rating the reserve fund as a percent funded. The Canadian National Association of Real Estate Appraisers(CNAREA)offers the Designated Reserve Planner (DRP) program to designated appraiser members since 2012. The DRP designation requires demonstrated experience and compliance with standardized terminology and methodology to obtain. All DRP designated planners are required to use the RFA Pro Reserve Fund Analysis software or provide a quality assurance report of their chosen calculation methods. Applied Science Technologists & Technicians of British Columbia (ASTTBC) offers the Registered Reserve Fund Analysts (RRFA) training program to Home inspectors, as home inspectors are restricted from completing Depreciation Reports / Reserve Studies in their bylaws. As of 2013, Sauder School of Business Real Estate Division is offering the first of 2 courses towards a certification called the Reserve Fund Planning Program (RFPP), but yet no trade group has recognized this designation. There are three types of reserve studies based on standards set by the Association of Professional Reserve Analysts and Community Associations Institute, differing in how exhaustively the Physical Analysis is conducted. These three types of reserve studies allow the association to select the \\"Level of Service\\" appropriate to their current budget preparation and disclosure needs. Listed beginning with the most exhaustive, they are: # \\"Full\\" reserve study (creation of the reserve study, involving creation of the component list, measuring/quantifying all reserve components, and development of the Useful Life, Remaining Useful Life, and Current Replacement Cost based on a diligent, visual on-site inspection). Note that for most associations, a \\"Full\\" reserve study only needs to be done once. After a \\"Full\\" reserve study has been done, in subsequent years the association can choose between the two reserve study update options shown below: # \\"Update With-Site-Visit\\" reserve study (an update of an existing reserve study involving a diligent visual on- site inspection, but presuming that all components have been properly identified and quantified). This type of update is often performed every two to five years. # \\"Update No-Site-Visit\\" reserve study (an update of an existing reserve study without a site inspection, done by client interviews and interviews with knowledgeable vendors and service providers). This type of update is typically performed in the years in-between With-Site-Visit updates. Note that the International Capital Budgeting Institute's (ICBI) Generally Accepted reserve Study Standards issue in April 2015 provide differing views than those presented above. ICBI agrees with the three TYPES of reserve studies identified above (Full reserve study, Update with On Site Analysis reserve study, and Update without Site Analysis reserve study), but differs in stating that these represent \\"types of engagements,\\" not levels of service. ICBI has identified three levels of service which are (1) Independent reserve study, (2) Reserve management plan, and (3) Consulting. Typically Excluded Common Area Components Some common area components may have been left out of your reserve study or been included in the component list as an ‚Äúexcluded item‚Äù and not been funded for. These components will typically fall into one or more of the categories listed below. Below Threshold Costs - Component repair and/or replacement costs that are deemed too small to be considered capital expenses and are typically included in the operational or maintenance budget of the association have not been funded for in this study. Minimal threshold costs are determined by the Association or by you Reserve Analysts based on the typical minimal threshold costs for similar sized associations. Operational Expenses - These occur at least annually and can be effectively budgeted for each year. They are characterized as being reasonably predictable both in terms of frequency and cost. Operational expenses include all minor expenses which would not otherwise adversely affect an operational budget from one year to the next. Very Long or Unpredictable Useful Life Expectancy - Components which, when properly maintained, have a very long useful life and which cannot be accurately predicted, have been excluded from this reserve report. These components may require maintenance and upkeep which is typically funded from the operational budget of the association. Unit Improvements - Improvements made to the property that fall within the Governing Documents‚Äô unit description summary (owners responsibility), are not typically considered to be community owned or the responsibility of the association. Other Non- Association Owned - Improvements installed on the property but which are owned by other parties such as governmental agencies, utility companies, the US Postal Service, etc., are not included in this reserve study. The replacement and maintenance of these improvements are not typically the responsibility of the association. Additionally, budgeting is normally excluded for repairs or replacements of assets which are deemed to have an estimated useful life equal to or exceeding the estimated useful life of the facility, community as a whole, or exceeding the legal life of the community as defined in an association's governing documents. Examples include the complete replacement of the foundation, elevators, wiring and oftentimes plumbing. Also excluded are insignificant expenses which may be covered either by an operating or reserve contingency, or otherwise in a general maintenance fund. Costs which are caused by acts of God, accidents or other occurrences which are more properly insured for, rather than reserved for, are also excluded.Reserve Data Analysis: Excluded Components  Reserve Study Guideline.

His highest rank was sekiwake. After his retirement in 1981 he became a television personality and ran unsuccessfully for political office. Career His parents were farmers. He began sumo at Kochi junior high school. He was an amateur sumo champion at Nihon University, coming third in the All Japan Sumo Tournament in his third year. He made his professional debut in 1972, beginning as a makushita tsukedashi entrant, and reached the top makuuchi division the following year. He was a member of Hanakago stable and a stablemate of yokozuna Wajima, a fellow Nihon University graduate. He once wore a cream-coloured mawashi, or belt, in a tournament, the only wrestler so far to do so. He fought under his family name of Arase, although he changed the second part of it from Hideo to Nagahide in 1975. He was involved in an unusual incident when in a match against Tamanofuji the referee was knocked out of the dohyo having failed to get out of the wrestlers‚Äô way, and had to be told who was the winner. He fought in the top division for 48 tournaments, with a win/loss record of 351-367-2. He won four sansho or special prizes and two kinboshi or gold stars. He defeated yokozuna Kitanoumi in January 1980 having previously lost to him 27 times in a row (the second worst record ever for a wrestler against the same opponent, after Kaneshiro who lost 29 consecutive bouts to Kitanoumi). In a match against Wakamisugi on the 8th day of the July 1976 tournament there were eight matta or false starts, and both wrestlers were criticized by the chief judge. Arase had a reputation for regularly engaging in false starts, and there was a suggestion from the sansho committee when he was up for the Fighting Spirit Award in March 1975 that this should disqualify him from receiving the prize, although he was given it in the end. He held the third highest rank of sekiwake for nine tournaments in total, including four straight from September 1977 to March 1978. However he only once had a double-digit winning record at the rank and so never seriously challenged for ozeki promotion. Hampered by a right knee injury, he announced his retirement in September 1981. Retirement from sumo After his retirement he was briefly an elder of the Japan Sumo Association under the name of Magaki but left in February 1983, turning the name over to Wakanohana II, and became a television personality. He stood for election to the House of Councillors as a Liberal League candidate in 2001, but was unsuccessful. He suffered a stroke in 2006. He died of heart failure in 2008 at the age of 59.

Stamps were first introduced by the French colonial administration. Stamps specifically for Vietnam were first issued in 1945. During the decades of conflict and partitioning, stamps were issued by mutually hostile governments. The reunification of Vietnam in 1976 brought about a unified postal service. Advent of Vietnamese stamps Stamps in Vietnam were first introduced by the French colonial administration in 1862. The stamps of these decades were initially of the general French colonial series.Yvert & Tellier (1973), p. 198. In the 1880s, some of these were overprinted locally for Cochinchina (1886‚Äì88), Annam and Tonkin (1888) and French Indochina (1889).Yvert & Tellier (1973), pps. 198, 160 and 289. Subsequently, definitive stamps of French Indochina were issued. The colony of French Indochina consisted of present-day Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. Stamps specifically for Vietnam were first issued in 1945. During the Japanese occupation of French Indochina (1940-1945), the colonial administration did not receive fresh supplies of stamps from France. For this reason they resorted to printing their own stamps at a print shop in Hanoi. These stamps were of lower quality than the pre-war stamps, and in addition, the machinery used for this purpose gradually deteriorated, with limited possibilities of repairing it. French Indochina stamp printed in Hanoi during the Japanese occupation (left), similar stamp overprinted \\"VIET-NAM DAN-CHU CONG-HOA\\" (Democratic Republic of Vietnam) (center) and a 1946 definitive stamp of the republic (right). Some of the overprints were explicitly political in nature, e.g. \\"Quoc Phong\\" (national defence). The advent of stamps specifically for Vietnam came with the defeat of Japan in 1945. In Vietnam, the Japanese surrender paved the way for the anti-Japanese Viet Minh movement, which presided over a guerilla army, to seize key cities and political power in Vietnam. During 1945-1946, the Viet Minh government issued a large number of provisional postage stamps. These stamps were manufactured by adding an overprint to remaining stocks of the war-era stamps of French Indochina. Eventually, a set of definitive stamps depicting Ho Chi Minh were issued in 1946. 1951 30 piastres stamp issued by the B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i government. The ensuing conflict between the returning French troops and the Viet Minh government brought an end to the initial series of Viet Minh stamps. During the conflict, stamps were issued in various Viet Minh held regions, while new issues of French Indochina stamps were used in areas controlled by the French. Around 1950, national governments for Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos were established, each issuing stamps and coins in their own names. The first stamps of the B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i government in Vietnam were issued in 1951. These stamps supplanted the French Indochina stamps in the French controlled areas of Vietnam. With the peace agreement in 1954, Vietnam was partitioned into a northern and a southern state. Each issued their own stamps. North Vietnam (1954‚Äì1976) 1966 North Vietnam stamp. Many stamps of North Vietnam were printed in Hanoi,Stanley Gibbons (1995), p. 381. while others were printed abroad, e.g., in Prague, Czechoslovakia, (1958‚Äì59)Stanley Gibbons (1995), pps. 384-385. and subsequently in Budapest, Hungary.Stanley Gibbons (1995), p. 389ff. South Vietnam (1954‚Äì1976) 1971 South Vietnam stamp. The stamps of South Vietnam were mostly printed in Paris, Tokyo, England (by De La Rue) and Rome during 1954-67,Stanley Gibbons (1995), p. 360-369 (see especially p. 363). Others were printed by the American Bank Note Co. (1956) and in Munich (1957). in Japan during 1967-73Stanley Gibbons (1995), p. 369-374. Others were printed in Paris (1967 (and 1970?)) and Rome (1969). and in England (by De La Rue) during 1973-75.Stanley Gibbons (1995), p. 374-377. Others were printed in Saigon (1975). Stamps used by military personnel were printed locallyStanley Gibbons (1995), pps. 363 and 370. and are of inferior quality. 1965 NLF stamp. Between 1963 and 1976, the insurgent National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (the NLF or \\"Viet Cong\\") issued their own stamps. These were printed in Hanoi.Stanley Gibbons (1995), p. 377. When the Republic of Vietnam was toppled in May 1975, the NFL government became the sole stamp issuing authority, until the reunification of Vietnam one year later. Reunified Vietnam (1976‚Äì) 2007 miniature sheet commemorating the Central Highlands gong culture festival. The reunification of Vietnam in July 1976 brought about a unified postal service. This effectively consisted of the postal administration in Hanoi operating throughout Vietnam. Indeed, the stamps issued in July and August 1976 still had the name of the North Vietnamese state printed on them,Stanley Gibbons (1995), pps. 413-414. while later issues have simply \\"Vi·ªát Nam\\" and \\"b∆∞u ch√≠nh\\" (mail). As in North Vietnam, post- reunification stamps were partly printed in Vietnam and partly abroad. Domestically printed stamps were printed in Hanoi 1976-1987 and subsequently in Saigon.Stanley Gibbons (1995), pps. 413 and 440. During 1983-1990 most stamp issues were printed in Havana, Cuba,Stanley Gibbons (1995), pps. 425-449. these were of a superior printing quality. Eventually, the postal service acquired improved technology from Germany. Since 1990 all stamps of Vietnam have been produced domestically. Relations with the collector market Many stamp sets of North Vietnam and post-reunification Vietnam are available imperforate, as opposed to the regular perforated versions. This goes for stamps printed domesticallySee e.g. SG# N149 (Stanley Gibbons (1995), p. 387) of 1960 and subsequent issues. and abroad.Regarding Havana printed stamps, see Stanley Gibbons (1995), p. 425. At present, Vietnamese stamps are officially offered in both regular, imperforate and specimen versions.See e.g. the 'year of the buffalo' set, issued in 2008. They are issued in regular, imperforate and specimen versions at prices ranging from US$ 1 to 2 per set. (Retrieved December 7, 2008). The imperforate and specimen versions serve no postal purpose and are thus entirely aimed at the collector community. During the war of independence (1946-1954) and immediate aftermath, some stamps were issued imperforate due to technical shortcomings. These may, of course, have inspired later collector oriented imperforates. Apart from the regular issues (for postal use), a large proportion of the stamps of Vietnam have been made available to collectors as cancelled-to-order (CTO) versions. The Havana printed stamps of the 1980s usually have the CTO cancellation printed directly onto the stamp along with the rest of the design and are solely aimed at the collector community. While the majority of the stamps of this category found in the collector market are CTO versions, this should not overshadow the fact that similar stamps (non-CTO editions) are found postally used. While a large proportion of the stamps of the 1980s appear to deliberately appeal to thematic collectors (cars, dogs, cats, etc.), 21st century stamps are broader in scope, and the issue rate has declined. This seems to reflect a shift in issuing policy away from the orientation towards thematic collectors, thus making the field of Vietnamese stamps more appealing in its own right.

It was based on attempts by classical composers to incorporate American Indian musical ideas with some of the basic principles of Western music, with the goal of creating a new, truly American national music. Chief practitioners of the form included Charles Sanford Skilton, Arthur Nevin, Arthur Farwell, and Charles Wakefield Cadman. Many other composers also incorporated Native American music in their works at various points in their careers. In his book Imagining Native America in Music Michael Pisani argues that there was no such thing as an \\"Indianist\\" movement in American music, but that American composers' borrowing melodies of native America (beginning around 1890) was simply one part of a larger interest in the use of folk musics of all ethnicities on American soil. (A similar interest was expressed in the work of several classical composers of Central and South America, as well as in Europe at this time.) Origins The Indianist movement could trace its roots to certain trends in nineteenth- century American Romanticism, which was engaging with folk music of many forms. Examples of music on \\"Indian\\" themes can be found dating back to the early years of the seventeenth century. Stories relating to the conquest of the Americas were popular with composers through the late eighteenth century as well. The composers' work can be seen as part of the interest in Native Americans at a time when it was felt they were disappearing. Writers such as James Fenimore Cooper and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote about the \\"noble savage\\". Edwin Forrest, too, influenced the movement with his star performance in the play Metamora. At least one composer, Anthony Philip Heinrich, a contemporary of these artists, is recorded as having spent some time among the Indians on the American frontiers; he was the first to set Longfellow's Hiawatha to music. He did not, however, use Indian musical themes in his work. Beginnings of the movement With the rise in studies both in ethnology and in folklore in the late nineteenth century, much information was gleaned and collected about various American Indian cultures. In 1880 Theodore Baker transcribed songs from a number of tribes, publishing them two years later in a German-language dissertation for his doctorate from the University of Leipzig. Edward MacDowell borrowed themes from Baker's work when composing his Second (Indian) Suite for orchestra in 1894. In 1892, Czech composer Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k arrived to teach in New York City. He exhorted American composers to stop imitating European models, and to turn instead, as he had, to indigenous sources. Composer Frederick Burton took the idea to heart, and transcribed some Ojibway melodies. He later adapted these as art songs. Later work by ethnographers and musicologists helped to build a body of notated music by Indians, and this aided some composers in searching for musical sources. Carlos Troyer notated their source material themselves in an attempt to be as authentic as possible. Others, such as Harvey Worthington Loomis, borrowed from already-published sources. Charles Sanford Skilton was probably the composer who did most to establish the stereotypes of the genre, with pieces such as his Suite Primeval for orchestra. Opera composers also attempted to incorporate Indian themes in their work; among Indianist operas were Poia, by Arthur Nevin; Victor Herbert's Natoma; Charles Skilton's Kalopin and The Sun Bride; Alberto Bimboni's Winona; and Francesco Bartolomeo de Leone's Alglala. Charles Wakefield Cadman's Shanewis (or The Robin Woman, 1918) was produced in two succeeding seasons by the Metropolitan Opera of New York and was very popular. It also toured, being produced after World War I in Denver in 1924 and Los Angeles in 1926. DeLeone, Bimboni and Skilton were awarded the Bispham Memorial Medal Award for their operas. Arthur Farwell Arthur Farwell was perhaps the most important composer involved in the Indianist movement at the height of its influence. He professed interest in all forms of American music, \\"notably, ragtime, Negro songs, Indian songs, Cowboy songs, and, of the utmost importance, new and daring expressions of our own composers, sound-speech previously unheard.\\" He seemed to show particular interest in American Indian music. Farwell founded the Wa-Wan Press, which published songs and other compositions of Indianist music in America. As a composer, Farwell did not regard American Indian music as a novelty, but as a profound source of inspiration for his work. Decline The Wa-Wan Press began losing subscribers around 1908, and folded in 1912 after being acquired by G. Schirmer.The Library of Congress (February 1, 2007). \\"Biography: Arthur Farwell, 1872-1952: The Library of Congress Presents: Music, Theater and Dance\\". Retrieved on August 12, 2008. The growing influence of jazz and popular music, and a lack of American interest in Romanticism, combined to end the formal Indianist movement in music. But Native American subjects have continued to interest composers, both in the United States and abroad. Since the late 20th century, new works on Native American themes are being created by Native American composers. Indianist composers Among the major Indianist composers were: Composers who wrote works based on Indian themes, and who are sometimes grouped under the \\"Indianist\\" label, include: Notes and references Romantic music American music history Native American music 1900s in American music 1910s in American music 1920s in American television ","title":"Indianist movement"},{"id":"18829956","text":"Forsyth Country Day School (FCDS) is a coeducational private day school located in Lewisville, North Carolina.

His interdisciplinary practice has spanned a variety of disciplines and themes, including explorations of performer presence and absence, the role of the artist as biographer, the possibility for journalistic approaches to arts practice, and the mapping and ethics of performance re-enactment. He graduated from Cardiff School of Art in 1996, and went on to present his performances and videos at conferences and festivals in the UK and internationally in Europe, USA and Asia. His work has been commissioned and programmed by venues such as The ICA, London (1996), The Young Vic, London (2000), CCCB, Barcelona (2006), Tanzquartier Wien, Vienna (2007) and the Centre d'art Scenique Contemporain Lausanne, Switzerland (2009), Tate Britain, London (2014) and the Barbican Centre, London (2015). He has also been artist in residence at Sophiensaele in Berlin (2005), Camden Arts Centre London (2006) and Robert Wilson's Watermill Center, New York (2009). He has received a variety of awards and fellowships from organizations such as the Delfina Foundation, British Arts Council, Live Art Development Agency and Franklin Furnace Inc. Between 2003 and 2012, he was an Associate Artist of contemporary artists producing organization Artsadmin. Lectures and Performances Deacon‚Äôs early 1990s output focused on the visual and the physical, with a series of performances exploring object manipulation and personification. Later work began questioning the spatial limitations and social conventions imposed on performance with a series of interventions in public and televisual spaces, including an impromptu interrogation of former UK Home Secretary Michael Howard on the Channel 5 show, The Wright Stuff. The late 1990s saw a series of performances that explored issues of racial politics, and notions and definitions of obscenity produced in collaboration with performance artist and film actor Laurence R. Harvey. From the early 2000s, he began producing a series of works that used spoken word and lecture based presentation, such as Harry and Me (2004). This performance lecture described Deacon‚Äôs search for television footage of himself as a member of his school choir on an edition of Harry Secombe‚Äôs religious program Highway. The performance interrogates media representations of multiculturalism, pursuing the narrative that he was planted in the choir to provide a more racially integrated image. Deacon also become known for his works in political biography, with a series of performances on the lives of former US Secretary of State Colin Powell (2004‚Äì08) and German Chancellor Angela Merkel (2005). Both these performances were characterized by a humorous and often satirical approach to the subject matter. These works also had a strong multimedia element and were often rewritten in response to prevailing news events regarding their subjects. Deacon's later performance piece Prototypes (2006‚Äì09) stylistically referenced the output of documentary films produced by the British Transport Commission. Between 2011 and 2013, two new lecture based performances (The Argument Against the Body and White Balance: A History of Video) were presented in their early form. Following a development award from Franklin Furnace Inc. and a three day in progress presentation of the work at the Emily Harvey Gallery, NYC, a final version of White Balance was presented as part of the Conversations at the Edge series at the Gene Siskel Theater in Chicago (2015), and at the Spill Festival at the Barbican Centre, London (2015). Film and Video Although the use of video and film has often been incorporated as an element of Deacon‚Äôs live work, several of his projects explored these mediums in their own right. His early video pieces were short, single channel video works such as What is a Performance Artist? (2005), a compilation of uses of the word ‚Äòperformance art‚Äô or ‚Äòperformance artist‚Äô in popular cultural contexts such as cinema and television. In 2005, he received a Live Art Development Agency commission for the film They Used to Call it a White Elephant which was screened as part of the Variety season at the De La Warr Pavilion, Bexhill, UK. In 2009, he began initial work on what would become his first feature-length documentary film on the life of the late US American performance artist and filmmaker Stuart Sherman. The completed film, Spectacle: A Portrait of Stuart Sherman saw its first screening in 2013 in a curatorial collaboration between Performa and the 'Rituals of Rented Island' Exhibition at the Whitney Museum, New York. There were subsequent screenings at the BBC Art Screen Festival at the Glasgow Film Theatre (2014), Tate Britain in London (2014), and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (2015). Parallel to this film Robin Deacon performed and directed a series of live solo and group re-enactments of Sherman's performances, including Sherman's ensemble version of Hamlet (A portrait), which was shown as part of the Sacred: US Radical season at London's Chelsea Theatre in 2009. Writing and Education Robin Deacon has published several chapters based on his research and practice, including contributions to monographs on the Norwegian Performance group Baktruppen (published by Kontur) and on artist filmmaker Stuart Sherman (published by NYU Press). He has been invited to present at the Performance Studies International Conference at the University of Mainz, Germany (2001), University of Zagreb, Croatia (2009) and Stanford University, USA (2013). From 2004, he was Course Director of the Drama and Performance Studies program at London South Bank University before relocating to the USA in 2011.

Through his paternal grandfather, he was a descendant of the Dudley-Winthrop family and through his paternal grandmother, he was the great-grandson of James Alexander Hamilton (1788‚Äì1878) and the great-great-grandson of Alexander Hamilton, the Founding Father and first Treasury Secretary of the United States, and Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton, of the prominent Schuyler family. Through his mother, he was a descendant of Moses H. Grinnell, formerly the Collector of the Port of New York. Temple Bowdoin graduated from Columbia University in 1885. Career After college, Bowdoin spent several years traveling and then entered the banking business, clerking as a lawyer for four years at Winslow, Lanier & Co. He joined J. P. Morgan & Co. in January 1891 and, two years later, was made a partner and put in charge of monitoring the firm's books, which he did until his death in 1914. He was in charge of the accounting business of J.P. Morgan & Company. Bowdoin was connected to Morgan for 25 years and a partner for 15 years. He was a director of the Niagara Development Company, Niagara Falls Power Company, and the Niagara Junction Railway Company. In his will, he left all the employees of Morgan & Co. in New York and of Drexel & Co. in Philadelphia one month's salary, and those who had been in his personal service for a year or more, one year's salary. Social activities He belonged to The Metropolitan Club, University Club of New York, New York Yacht Club, Union Club of the City of New York, St. Anthony Club, Tennis Ardsley Club, Baltusrol Golf Club, and the Automobile Club of America. In 1892, Bowdoin was included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Personal life On April 4, 1894, he was married to Helen Parish Kingsford (1863‚Äì1912). She was the daughter of Mary P. and John J. Kingsford of London, England, and the sister of Bowdoin's brother-in-law. Together, they were the parents of: * Fanny Kingsford Bowdoin (1895‚Äì1899), who died young. * George Temple Bowdoin (1898‚Äì1967), who served as the first mayor of Oyster Bay Cove, New York in 1932 and was elected to the Board of NYU in 1940. * John Temple Bowdoin (1900‚Äì1902), who also died young. His wife died on August 9, 1912. Bowdoin died at his home at 104 East 37th St. on December 2, 1914, following an operation for an intestinal disorder. J.P. Morgan & Company closed for a time on the day of his death, out of respect. He was survived by a son, George Temple Bowdoin, then a student at Groton School. His estate was valued at $6,187,708, the bulk of which was left to his son. His son was also heir to his grandmother's estate upon her death in 1915.

Further things that can be done to help the reintroduction of this subspecies include inserting man-made water sources, reducing the amount of grazing in reintroduction areas, and minimizing fence use. Conservation After reintroduction of the Mexican pronghorn, the next step is to start the conservation process. Historically, poaching was one of the factors that led them to becoming endangered, but hunting can be one of the best and most practical conservation methods. Once healthy herds are established, management plans can be implemented by the state the animals fall within. This will allow herds to remain genetically viable and contributes money back to the state.

The wild population is estimated at 200. Population The Baja California pronghorn was the last subspecies of pronghorn to be described, and is found on the Baja peninsula. Aerial surveys in the mid-1990s counted 117 and 151 individuals; the ground surveys results were 83, 39, and 48 individuals. Male to female ratios were 66:100 in the aerial survey and 140:100 in the ground survey. After this study, researchers proposed to capture 30 individuals, 12 males and 18 females, to radio-collar and study further. Recovery The recovery for the Baja California pronghorn is affected by many different factors. Like most pronghorn species, adequate nutrition is crucial for survival, but not uniquely to the Baja California pronghorn, human population increase and land development have drastically reduced their habitat. This creates barriers that do not allow genetic diversity and reduce the total area these animals can use to forage for food and find water. Conservation efforts must be conducted to save the habitat of the species; these can include stopping development in the current ranges of the Baja California pronghorn and reducing the number of males in the population, which will allow more genetic diversity and open up more habitat for females that are the key to recovery of the population.

It is situated at an altitude of 250‚Äì400 meters above sea level and covers an area of 273 km2. In the 19th century, the lovely landscape attracted the Prussian high nobility, which built magnificent palaces, manors and parks. The enormous number of stately homes turned the valley into one of the most important garden landscapes in Middle Europe. The palaces and landscape parks of the Jelenia G√≥ra valley represent one of Poland's official national Historic Monuments (Pomnik historii), as designated September 20, 2011. Its listing is maintained by the National Heritage Board of Poland. Geography Jelenia G√≥ra Valley - view from Karkonosze (Great) Mountains to Kaczawskie Mountains. Jelenia G√≥ra valley within the geomorphological division of Poland Jelenia G√≥ra valley is surrounded by parts of the Sudetes mountains. It lies at the foot of the Karkonosze, which are also its southern limit. In the east it borders the Rudawy Janowickie, in the west the Jizera Mountains and in the north to the Kaczawskie Mountains. River B√≥br runs through the valley along its northern side, its tributaries ≈Åomnica and Kamienna flow, from the southeast and south- west, along the eastern and western side of the valley and open out near since Jelenia G√≥ra into the B√≥br. The name of the valley derives from Jelenia G√≥ra, which is also the most important town of the Silesian Karkonosze. The valley is characterised by ridges which are separated by smaller basins. Wzg√≥rza Karpnickie near Karpniki is the easternmost ridge, followed by Obni≈ºenie Mys≈Çakowickie basin near Mys≈Çakowice to the west, Wzg√≥rza ≈Åomnickie ridge to the southeast of Cieplice ≈ölƒÖskie-Zdr√≥j (a spa district of Jelenia G√≥ra), the wide basin Obni≈ºenie Sobieszowa near Sobiesz√≥w, Wysoczyzna Rybnicy ridge north west of Piechowice and Starej Kamienicy basin near Stara Kamienica.  History  Kynast (Polish: Chojnik), built ca. 1292, Schaffgotsch family seat after 1360 Already in the 12th century the Polish kingdom built several strongholds against Bohemia near Jelenia Gora valley, such as Nowo Grodziec or Swiny. After Boleslaw I initiated the Ostsiedlung in Silesia, the valley was cleared of forests by German colonists beginning in the late 13th century, and several villages and towns were established, among them Hirschberg (Jelenia G√≥ra). During that time the family Schaffgotsch appeared for the first time in the region, and later owned large parts of the valley as well as of the Giant Mountains until their expulsion in 1945. After the forests lost its significance as a natural border against Bohemia the Silesian Piasts of the independent duchy of Jawor-≈öwidnica built several castles in the valley to secure the border and to protect the new villages. Many fortifications were constructed, especially during the reign of Bolko II, who was in a constant feud with Bohemia. In the middle of the 15th century Matthias Corvinus, who ruled over Silesia, destroyed almost all Silesian castles. During the Renaissance and Baroque era many manors were expanded, sometimes to splendid palaces. Fischbach Castle (Polish: Karpniki), summer residence of Prince Wilhelm of Prussia Since the Treaty of Berlin (1742) Silesia had become part of the Kingdom of Prussia. At the end of the 18th century artists and travellers attracted by the landscape discovered the valley. At first Bad Warmbrunn (Cieplice ≈ölƒÖskie Zdr√≥j, now a district of Jelenia G√≥ra) with its hot springs became a popular bath and tourist centre. In 1822 Wilhelm, a brother of Prussian king Frederick William III, was the first prince of the Hohenzollern dynasty who took his summer residence in the Hirschberg valley, at Fischbach (today Karpniki) castle. In 1831 the king himself bought Erdmannsdorf estate, which he had learned to appreciate when visiting his brother in Fischbach and the previous owner of Erdmannsdorf, field marshal August von Gneisenau. The valley became a princely hideaway, and in 1839 the king purchased nearby Schildau Castle (today Wojan√≥w) for his daughter Princess Louise. Frederick William IV enlarged Erdmannsdorf Palace. Many new parks were created and manors and palaces rebuilt according to the newest architectural styles. Artificial ruins, small pavilions, cottages, romantic temples and viewpoints created a cultural landscape of international recognition. At the end of the 19th century Hirschberg valley became one of the most favoured travel destinations in Germany. Tourism by car became popular after new streets, like the Sudetenstra√üe (Sudete road), were built in the first half of the 20th century. Many new hotels were constructed in Hirschberg, Krummh√ºbel (Polish: Karpacz) and Schreiberhau (Polish: Szklarska Porƒôba), which also housed an artists' colony, and Bad Warmbrunn was one of the most popular spas in Eastern Germany. Palaces and parks became a tourist attraction and many art collections were opened for the public. Barcinek palace (German: Berthelsdorf), neglected and ruinous since 1971 At the end of World War II Silesia was conquered by the Soviet Union and the valley became part of Poland. The new owners rarely maintained the cultural heritage. Important churches and the castles, testimonies of the early Polish culture before the German colonization in the 13th and 14th century, were preserved, palaces and manors however were neglected, vandalized and sometimes destroyed. Directly after the war the reactivation of tourism was tried, however as most holiday homes in the valley were occupied by new settlers and the touristic infrastructure was in a sorry state these attempts failed. The parks, the excellent hiking trail network and erstwhile viewpoints run to seed, while most of the art collections were either destroyed or dissolved and spread all over Poland. After the collapse of communism in Poland a rediscovery of the cultural landscape began, which is increasingly accepted and appreciated by the descendants of the Polish settlers. Today many private and governmental initiatives, as well as German expellee organisations and family members of former owners, work together to revitalize the touristic infrastructure and cultural heritage, and academics work on the acceptance of the valley as a World Heritage Site.  Parks  Park in Buchwald (Bukowiec),19th century, artificial ruin of abbey, decayed after 1945 Enthusiastic contemporaries described the Hirschberg valley of the 19th century as one \\"big English garden\\". Already at the end of the 18th century Hirschbergs director of town planning, Sch√∂nau, created several gardens on the surrounding hills of the city. Around 1800 the first parks emerged in Ruhberg (Polish: Ciszyca) and Stonsdorf (Polish: Stanisz√≥w). These early parks were affected by Sentimentalism, as the art of garden design was especially suitable to stimulate deep feelings like melancholy, teariness, amazement or joy. In the course of the 19th century horticulture became more and more influenced by romantic ideas and a new historical awareness. Instead of different scenes and architectural styles more reduced designs, only consisting of mere scenic elements like trees, groves, creeks, meadows and hills, became popular. Extensive path networks and long view shafts were a central element of these parks. A prominent example was the park of Fischbach. The landscape architecture in Hirschberg valley culminated during the 1840s with the work of Peter Joseph Lenn√©. New parks were created in Erdmannsdorf (Polish: Mys≈Çakowice), Schildau (Polish: Wojan√≥w) and Lomnitz (Polish: ≈Åomnica). These parks followed the so-called zoned landscape garden, a principle which was adopted by Lenn√© and P√ºckler-Muskau from England. It was marked by richly decorated gardens around the house which were divided into small sections, followed by a pleasure ground as a transition zone and a landscape garden which faded into the proximity. The surrounding countryside was landscaped by Lenn√© with alleys, paths, lookout points and places to rest. The large number of parks from different eras, the artistic reference of all these parks to the beautified surrounding countryside and the picturesque backdrop of the Giant Mountains created a unique landscape, which was regarded as a Silesian Elysium. Since a few years, the Polish conservation organization tries to preserve and recreate the cultural landscape, which slowly recovers its lost beauty. Sights Jelenia G√≥ra valley is the natural foreland of the Karkonosze Mountains. Many places in the valley offer unparalleled views of the mountains. An outstanding feature of the valley is the large number of country seats and locks, for example Mys≈Çakowice, Stanisz√≥w and now to Jelenia G√≥ra or Cieplice ≈ölƒÖskie-Zdr√≥j with park and spa. Chojnik, a castle ruin on a foothill of the Karkonosze (Giant) Mountains, overlooks the entire Jelenia G√≥ra valley. A lake district in the south of the Wzg√≥rza ≈Åomnickie at the foot of the mountains, created in the 1980s and 1990s, represents another distinctive feature. It consists of a series of dams, of which Zbiornik Sosn√≥wka or Jezioro Sosn√≥wka below Sosn√≥wka and Podg√≥rzyn, with a dam of 1.5 kilometres in length, 20 metres in height and an area of 170 hectares, is the largest. Important castles, palaces and manors For a complete list see List of castles and palaces in Jelenia G√≥ra valley  Wojan√≥w palace  Wojan√≥w palace (), was one of three former royal Prussian summer residences in the valley. It was first mentioned in 1281. Since 1299 it was owned by family von Zedlitz. Between 1603 and 1607 Nikolaus Freiherr von Zedlitz und Nimmersatt erected a new building, which was destroyed during the Thirty Years' War and rebuilt in 1667 by Christoph von Zedlitz. Between 1832 and 1833 the interior of the palace was altered by a builder close to Karl Friedrich Schinkel. In 1839 Frederick William III of Prussia bought the building as a gift for his daughter Louise. In the following years, the park was newly designed by Peter Joseph Lenn√©. After World War II the palace was looted and the furniture removed. The new Polish owners used it as an administrative building and holiday home. Later it was abandoned and fell into ruin. In 1995 a Polish-Italian company restored the building and its surroundings, which now house a luxurious hotel, spa and a business centre. The park has been restored to its formal glory (Wojan√≥w Palace home page).  Mys≈Çakowice palace  Mys≈Çakowice Palace in the 19th century Mys≈Çakowice palace () was the summer residence of the Prussian king and the most important palace in the valley. It was mentioned for the first time in 1305. Until the 16th century it was owned by the families of Zedlitz, Stange and Reibnitz. The core of today's building emanated from the 18th century, when Maximilian Leopold von Reibnitz expanded it to a Baroque palace. Later it was, among others, owned by the family von Richthofen and August Neidhardt von Gneisenau. Gneisenau expanded it in neo- classical style. After his death Frederick William III of Prussia bought the palace and appointed Schinkel and Lenn√© to remodel palace and the park, which became one of the most beautiful landscape gardens in Silesia. In 1837 Frederick William III left large parts of his estate to religious refugees from Tyrol, who built picturesque Alpine-style houses. After Frederick Williams death his successor, Frederick William IV of Prussia, reconvert the palace to plans by Friedrich August St√ºler in neo-Gothic style. Until 1909 the stately home continued to be the summer residence of the Prussians kings and German emperors, afterwards it was sold for 1,7 million Mark. After World War II the Communist Red Army occupied the palace. Since 1951 the Polish state used it as a school and largely destroyed the interior. Today parts of the exterior are renovated and most of the park is preserved, even though some important view shafts are overgrown.  Karpniki palace  Karpniki palace today Karpniki palace (), the summer palace of Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, is one of the best-known palaces in the valley. It was first mentioned in 1364 as a moated castle, which was expanded in the 15th century. Initially owned by the families Predel and Reichenbach, it was bought by Hans I. Schoff in 1476, who enlarged the castle with a two-storied mansion. After a fire in 1593, the building was again expanded with two new wings in Renaissance style. In 1822 prince Wilhelm acquired Fischbach, which became the first summer palace of the Hohenzollern dynasty in the valley. Beginning from 1844 it was reconstructed in neo-Gothic style according to plans in part by the prince himself. Wilhelm and his successors also equipped the palace with a remarkable art collection of medieval glass paintings and far eastern objects of art. At the end of World War II, it was used as a depository for important art treasures from Silesia and the national library in Berlin. After the war, Russian and Polish soldiers plundered Karpniki, which became part of Poland. In the following years, the palace was used as a school and a mental hospital. Over time it fell into disrepair and had to be evacuated. In the following years, it was several times depredated and also willfully destroyed. After the fall of the Iron Curtain several initiatives tried to hold up the decline, until now however without success. The large estate park was created after 1822 to instructions of princess Marianne. The arrangement referred to the family of the owners. A bench of marble showed medallions of the prince, the princess and its children, a neo-Gothic monument commemorated to a brother of princess Marianne and the Waldemarsturm housed a weapons collection of Prince Waldemar.

Built about 1865, it is a conservative but detailed example of early Italianate architecture. It was built for a locally prominent civic leader. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The Albert Ayer House stands in a residential area of southeastern Winchester, at the northeast corner of Brooks and Sanborn Streets. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gable roof and clapboarded exterior. It has wide corner boards, and its porch, which spans the main facade, has chamfered square posts. The roof has side gables, with a center gable over the front, in which is a round-arch window. The front facade is five bays wide, with elongated first-floor windows in the Greek Revival style. Windows on the front and side are topped by shallow projecting peaked lintels. The house was built about 1865, a period in which Winchester was early in a transition from more agricultural to suburban residential use. It was first owned by Albert Ayer, a prominent local politician who served for many years in a variety of civic roles. For more than 30 years Ayer was the town assessor, and also served four terms on the board of selectmen, and eight years as town clerk. He lived here until 1888. His brother Thomas lived next door on Grove Street.

Of the three crew and ten passengers on board, one crew member and four passengers perished. One of the fatalities was noted international adventurer and filmmaker Martin Johnson, of Martin and Osa Johnson fame.PlaneCrashInfo The off-course Boeing 247D, en route from Salt Lake City, was on approach to the Union Air Terminal at Burbank, California in severely lowered visibility due to heavy rain and fog. On suddenly spotting a ridge looming directly ahead, pilot William L. Lewis cut the engine and \\"pancaked\\" onto the hillside to reduce the force of the impact. The airliner first struck the ground with the left wing tip. It then skidded along the side of the mountain in a curved path for approximately 125 feet, finally coming to rest headed in the opposite direction from which it struck. The point of collision was at an elevation of 3550 feet near the summit of Los Pinetos, the highest mountain in the immediate vicinity.

It is also notable for its association with the locally prominent Locke family, who settled the area in 1699. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The Asa Locke House is set on the south side of High Street, at the southeast corner with Overlook Way, in what is now a predominantly residential suburban area. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, three bays wide, with a front- facing gable roof and clapboard siding. A single-story porch extends across the north-facing front and around to the east side, supported by chamfered square posts with segmented-arch bracketing. The front door is set to one side, with full-length windows in the side base. The door is flanked by sidelight windows, and is topped by a transom window. A gabled two-story bay projects from the east side, with a lunette window in the gable, and a two- story ell and garage extend to the rear. The Locke family history on this land dates to 1699, when James Converse bought a large tract of land in this area (then part of Woburn). Locke's descendants include Samuel Locke, who served as President of Harvard College in the 18th century. Asa Locke, a prosperous local farmer, purchased the land this house stands on in 1826. Based on stylistic analysis, this house was built c. 1855, probably for his son Elbridge, who inherited the property in 1857. The house was sold out of the Locke family in 1902, to a partner in Boston's Ivers & Pond Piano Company.

Since then it has taken a large role in preserving the history and promoting the heritage of Grey County. The current facility is located just south of Owen Sound on Grey Road 18. It was opened in 2004, constructed from materials that characterize the development of the County. The building houses the County museum, archives, and tourism offices. There is also Moreston Heritage Village adjacent to the main building, with volunteers and buildings portraying the development of Grey County from the 1850s to the 1920s.  History  The Museum Committee began to borrow artefacts for temporary exhibits in 1955, but a permanent museum was founded in 1959 with the help of the Grey County Historical Art Society as an art gallery and museum. A more spacious arrangement was made in 1967 with the help of the city of Owen Sound, and the new Grey County-Owen Sound Centennial Museum was opened. The museum would grow at this site, developing its own heritage village, until 2004. The Grey County Archives was established in 2000 in the former Glenelg municipal building in the Municipality of West Grey. As the Grey County Museum and the Grey County Archives both faced a shortage of space to expand, new property was acquired off Grey Rd 18, and both museum and archives were moved to this site. Six of the buildings from the Heritage Village were moved to the new site, with plans for a total of twenty buildings upon completion. The Grey Roots logo  Logo  The logo is a multi-coloured sheaf, each colour representing a different element of Grey County. The green symbol takes the outline of a tree, representing forestry. The grey symbol represents the rock wall of the escarpment. The red symbol represents fireworks, or celebration of people. The yellow represents grain, because of Grey County's agricultural heritage, and the blue represents water, such as Grey County's many waterfalls.Waterfalls of Grey County  Facility and Village The Grey Roots building is based on a natural theme, as is the logo and main gallery. Construction materials include concrete, stone, maples and cedar wood, all significant materials in the economic development of Grey County. The building incorporates all elements of the logo, including a limestone exterior, a timber framed entrance reminiscent of a Grey County barn, and even a small waterfall in the foyer. The Moreston Heritage Village, located just beside the main building, spans a time period from the 1850s to the 1920s. There is an 1850s Log Cabin and Blacksmith Shop, as well as an 1880s Log House and a 1920s Farmhouse, Bluewater Garage, George Rice Blacksmith Shop, Timberframe Barn, Good Cheer Bandstand and Schoolhouse, with future plans for twenty buildings. The village is named Moreston after the generous donation of the property by Barry More and the More family, and is open in the summer months and for certain school programs and special events throughout the year.  Collections  The Museum has been collecting artefacts relevant to the historical and cultural development of the County since 1955, with artefacts ranging from pre-settlement to present time. Each artefact in the collection is accessioned, digitized (digitally photographed), cleaned, catalogued and housed according to current Canadian Museum Standards. As per most Canadian museums, only a fraction of the collection is exhibited at one time, and artefacts rotate onto exhibition depending on the exhibition schedule and often compliment larger, rented exhibits. The majority of the exhibited items can befound in the Moreston Heritage Village buildings which are open seasonally. The collection and active accessioning of artefacts centres on telling the stories of Grey County through identified interpretive themes, which are: First Nations History, Pre- and Post-European contact, Pioneers and Early Settlers (1830s to 1855), Farm Life and Agriculture, Industrial Development, Commercial Development, Military History, Transportation and Noteworthy Names - Who Are We? Grey Roots Museum and Archives also has a separate education/hands-on collection which consists of items that can be used for teaching school groups and speciality groups. This collection is made up of items that are surplus to the collection, have little or unknown provenance, are not specifically related to Grey County or are purpose-bought. The vast majority of the museum's collection are donated by current or past residents or descendants of Grey County residents, but the museum also, from time to time, purchases items for its collection which meet its collecting mandate. The Archives collection contains over 500 collections, including land abstracts, municipal records, and private collections. All artefacts and collections are stored in areas with temperature, light, and humidity controls.  Exhibits  Exhibits include the Grey County Gallery, changing travelling exhibits and Grey Roots original exhibits of varying scope from exhibit pods to large scale productions. Another showcases the local heroes of Grey County- including Billy Bishop, Tom Thomson, and Agnes Macphail. There are a number of virtual exhibits, ranging from a focus on Women's Institutes to Black History. These are available on the Grey Roots website.  Interpretation  Grey Roots offers school and children's programs, group tours for both adults and children and many special event days throughout the year; some examples include: Pratie Oaten, Moreston by Candlelight, The Maple Sugar Moon Festival, and the Emancipation Festival Speaker's Forum.Emancipation Festival  External links  *Official site *County of Grey Online Affiliations The Museum is affiliated with: CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada.

Description and history The Carr-Jeeves House stands in a small residential area northwest of downtown Winchester, on the north side of Lake Street between Middlesex and Linden Streets. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a mansard roof providing a full second story, and a clapboarded exterior. It has an L-shaped layout, with a gable end section facing the street, below which is a squared projecting bay. The windows on this facade are arched in polygonal fashion. The gables and eaves (including those on the roof of the projecting bay) have dentil moulding and brackets. There is a three-story turret in the crook of the L, also topped by a mansard roof. The house was built in 1869 by Moses Mann and James Mann, local builders, as a speculative venture. Its design is apparently based on one published in a pattern book. It was sold to Mary Carr the following year, who sold it in 1878 to Thomas Jeeves. He added a carriage barn to the property (now subdivided and converted to a residence).

History In 1794, Alexandria Library opened as a private lending library, calling itself the Alexandria Library Company. In 1937, Dr. Robert South Barrett donated funds to build a public library in memory of his mother, physician Dr. Kate Waller Barrett (1857-1925). The Society of Friends granted a 99-year lease for use of its former Quaker Burial Ground (then used as a playground).Martha Claire Catlin, Historical Overview of the Woodlawn Quaker Meeting (October 2016), available at http://woodlawnfriends.org/home/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Historical- Overview-of-the-Woodlawn-Quaker-Meeting.pdf An informal agreement provided that the interments would not be disturbed, although the few gravestones were transferred to the Woodlawn Quaker Meetinghouse and a granite marker acknowledges the former use. Thus, the new library building was built without a basement, but rather on a concrete slab foundation (as were subsequent additions).Francine M. Bromberg et al., \\"To Find Rest from All Trouble: The Archeology of the Quaker Burying Ground Alexandria Virginia\\" (Office of Historic Alexandria, 2000) pp. 90-91, 109-111, 180-182 The Library Company cooperated in this effort, contracting with the Alexandria City Council to turn over its collections to City of Alexandria as the City agreed to include the public library's operating expenses in its budget. Due to practices common in Virginia and other Southern states at the time, the public library originally only permitted white residents to use the facility. On August 21, 1939, several young African American men, in a strategy devised by attorney Samuel Wilbert Tucker (who grew up about two blocks from the new library), staged a peaceable sit-in at the library to enable African Americans to use that public facility in the first known non-violent sit-in of the Civil rights movement in America. Although they were arrested, charges were ultimately dropped by city attorney Armistead Boothe, and a branch library was built in 1940 for African Americans and named after Robert H. Robinson, which closed circa 1960 and now houses the Alexandria Black History Museum. Current operations Today the library consists of a new central building (built in 2000 and named for mayor Charles E. Beatley Jr.) and four branch libraries, and includes two special divisions: Local History /Special Collections (in what became the Kate Waller Barret Branch Library) and a Talking Books division for the blind and visually handicapped. The other library buildings are: the Ellen Coolidge Burke Branch Library, the James M. Duncan Branch Library and the law library branch located in the historic Alexandria City Hall near the Barrett branch. Patrons check out more than 1.5 million titles annually, including books, CDs, DVDs, magazines, eAudioBooks, and other items. The system owned 503,191 items and had 700,921 library visitors (more than 1.3 million including its web site) in FY2017. The library's current Director is Rose T. Dawson. Among its more than 150 employees are more than 40 staff with Master‚Äôs degrees in library science. The library offers a wide variety of programs and services, both in the branches and via the Web site. Each branch has computers for access to the Internet, the catalog, downloadable material and databases. Library sponsored programs include: summer reading, One Book/One City, literary discussion groups, author book signings, children story times and other events for the City's diverse population. The Alexandria Library also started offering passport services at the Barrett Branch and Beatley Central Library in October 2016.

The founder and owner of the James McKay Company of Pittsburgh, a manufacturer of metal chains, he was also active in oil and gas development with one of the earliest producing properties in Pennsylvania. He also was part owner of one of the largest silver mines in the state of Colorado. Early career James McKay was born in Ireland in 1830, and was the first of his family to come to the shores of the United States. He arrived here in 1848, and for a short time made his home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but the year after his arrival moved to Pittsburgh. He found employment with Robert Watson, the owner of a wholesale grocery house. Later he succeeded Mr. Watson in this business and organized the firm of McKay & Philips, after a time purchasing the interests of Mr. Philips and formed the firm of McKay & Brothers, who carried on this business very successfully. Oil Interests Mr. McKay became identified with the oil industry in 1876, and took a small interest in a company which was formed in Pittsburgh, and which had a lease on some oil fields in Butler county, known as the \\"Jenkins\\" oil farm. Before oil was struck Mr. McKay bought out the interests of all the others concerned in this company, and shortly afterwards was successful in making a decided oil strike. This produced about three thousand dollars per day, but owing to the inadequate facilities of the time and the incompetency in handling the outflow, the greater part of this was lost. Mr. McKay, continued in this field for a number of years, and finally disposed of his interests in 1895. Mining Interests He then, in conjunction with W. J. Hammond, purchased in Colorado what was known as the Yankee Girl Silver Mine, which was one of the largest mines ever worked in that region of Colorado. It contained rich deposits, and Mr. McKay continued in gold and silver mining until his death. James McKay & Co \\"Fairholm\\", summer residence of James McKay The firm of McKay and Hammond was located at the corner of Twenty-ninth and Liberty streets, where they were engaged in the manufacture of chains. Mr. McKay purchased all the interests of his partners in 1887 and organized the firm of James McKay & Company, taking into partnership his two sons, Robert J. and J. Albert. The firm was changed to a stock company in 1905, and Mr. McKay retired, turning over all his interests to his three sons, the two mentioned above and Thomas J. The plant was located at McKee's Rocks, Pennsylvania, and was eventually sold in the 1960s to Teledyne Corporation. Other Business Interests He was the vice-president of the Duquesne National Bank of Pittsburgh for many years, and held this office at the time of his death. He was an extensive property owner in Pittsburgh, as well as in West Virginia, Kentucky, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Arizona and California. Marriage Mr. McKay married Anna Eliza Watson, daughter of Robert and Eliza (Stewart) Watson, and granddaughter of Rev. Robert Stewart, a Methodist minister of Ireland. Robert Watson and his wife were both natives of Ireland, where they were married, and emigrated to this country in 1829 or 1830. They made their first home in Kentucky, going there on a barge on the Ohio river. In Kentucky Mr. Watson was a builder of flatboats, and upon coming to Pittsburgh became a contractor and builder of boats, but later engaged in the grocery trade. Both he and his wife spent the remainder of their lives in Pittsburgh. Beaumaris In the 1880s the McKays purchased an island in the then-newly settled resort area of Beaumaris on Lake Muskoka, Ontario. The island, named \\"Fairholm\\" was conceived as a family enclave for the summer, much like similar developments during this era in the Adirondack Mountains. McKay eventually built four cottages on the island which were shared by his children and passed down to their offspring. To this day, two of the cottages are still owned by McKay's descendants and are enjoyed by the seventh consecutive generation. Children McKay died on April 30, 1906 and his wife died July 15, 1929.

From 2009-2011, he served as Secretary of the Brazilian Society for Neuroscience and Behavior. Sidarta Ribeiro is currently the Chair of the Regional Committee in Brazil of the Pew Latin American Fellows Program in the Biomedical Sciences. He is also member of the Steering Committee of the Latin American School for Educational, Cognitive and Neural Sciences .  Gathering Neuroscientists in Natal  In the 1990s, Sidarta Ribeiro and fellow neuroscientists Claudio Mello, Sergio Neuenschwander, Antonio Pereira, Cec√≠lia Hedin-Pereira, Claudia Vargas and M√°rio Fiorani, began the repatriation project that gave origin to the International Institute for Neuroscience of Natal (ELS-IINN), founded by Sidarta Ribeiro, Miguel Nicolelis and Claudio Mello in 2003. This initiative was promoted by the public sector, with decisive support from the Ministries of Education and Science. As a consequence, the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN) undertook the creation of a world-class neuroscience research center in Natal as part of its strategic plan for future development. In order to implement the project in a solid manner, the university engaged since 2008 in a major recruitment effort, publicized internationally in venues such as Nature and Science magazine, to recruit a group of faculty with international training in some of the most prestigious research centers in the world. The group currently includes 18 faculty duly selected by public contests: Adriano Tort, Antonio Pereira, Maria Bernardete de Sousa, Claudio Queiroz, Diego Laplagne, Draulio de Araujo, Lia Bevilaqua, Katarina Le√£o, Kerstin Schmidt, Marcos Costa, Martin Cammarota, Richardson Le√£o, Rodrigo Pereira, Sandro de Souza, Sergio Neuenschwander, Sidarta Ribeiro, and Tarciso Velho.

The entrance is centered and flanked by sidelight windows, with a sheltering shallow hip-roof portico. Rev. Zechariah Symmes, pastor of the Charlestown church, was granted land in this area that was settled by his sons about 1650. One son Deacon John Symmes, a blacksmith, built this house about 1807, making it the oldest surviving house of the Symmes family.

A typical rambling New England farmstead, this c. 1850 house was one of the few mid-19th century farmhouses to survive into the late 20th century. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. It was demolished in 1996. Description and history The Dike-Orne House stood on the east side of Forest Street, a short way south of the town line between Winchester and Stoneham. It was a rambling 2-1/2 tory wood frame structure, with an attached shed and carriage barn. It was unusual for its Gothic Revival styling, which is relatively rare in Winchester. Vergeboard decoration typical of the style decorated its gables and roof line. The house was probably built about 1850 by Lyman Dike, and predates the final settlement of the Stoneham- Winchester line, which was settled in 1864 in part through the efforts of Dike.

It was built in 1858 in an Italianate style. It was one of the first and grandest country houses built in Winchester at a time when Boston businessmen were seeking to build such houses. Edmund Dwight, the wealthy businessman who was its first owner, was married to a great-granddaughter of Thomas Jefferson. The house's design is believed to be based loosely on that of Jefferson's Monticello. The house is sited for an expansive view of the Upper Mystic Lake. The house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, originally finished in clapboard siding. It is basically rectangular, with a rounded central bay on the eastern facade, facing the lake. A single-story porch wraps around three sides of the building. Significant alterations were made to the house in the 1890s, including the stuccoing of the exterior, and the addition of a two- story ell to the northeast corner. These changes were made under the auspices of local architect Robert Coit. A second, single-story, addition was made to the northwest corner in 1985. The original property purchased by the Dwights was subdivided 1940, leaving the house on just . The house's stable was then converted to a residence, and stands on an adjacent lot in Arlington. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.

For some, this extends to refraining from engaging in promiscuous sex, to following a vegetarian or vegan diet, and to not using caffeine or prescription drugs. The term straight edge was adopted from the 1981 song \\"Straight Edge\\" by the hardcore punk band Minor Threat. Straight edge emerged amid the early-1980s hardcore punk scene. Since then, a wide variety of beliefs and ideas have been associated with the movement, including vegetarianism and animal rights. While the commonly expressed aspects of the straight edge subculture have been abstinence from alcohol, nicotine, and illegal drugs, there have been considerable variations. Disagreements often arise as to the primary reasons for living straight edge. Although straight edge politics vary, from explicitly revolutionary to conservative, the latter has mostly dominated. Left-leaning activists have often approached straight edge with skepticism, ridicule or even outright hostility in part due to what they perceived as the straight edge movement's self-righteous militancy. In 1999, William Tsitsos wrote that straight edge had gone through three eras since its founding in the early 1980s. Bent edge began as a counter-movement to straight edge by members of the Washington, D.C., hardcore scene who were frustrated by the rigidity and intolerance in the scene. During the youth crew era, which started in the mid-1980s, the influence of music on the straight edge scene was at an all-time high. By the early 1990s, militant straight edge was a well-known part of the wider punk scene. In the early to mid-1990s, straight edge spread from the United States to Northern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and South America. By the beginning of the 2000s, militant straight edge punks had largely left the broader straight edge culture and movement. History 1970s and early 1980s Minor Threat, pictured in 1981, coined the term straight edge In the 1970s, the punk subculture was associated with the use of intoxicative inhalants, substances such as model airplane glue that were inhaled for the intoxicating effect.Ghodse, Hamid. Ghodse's Drugs and Addictive Behaviour: A Guide to Treatment. Cambridge University Press, 2010. p. 98 In 1999, William Tsitsos wrote that straight edge had gone through three eras since its founding in the early 1980s. Later analysts have identified another era that has taken place since Tsitsos's writing. Straight edge grew out of hardcore punk in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and was partly characterized by shouted rather than sung vocals. Straight edge individuals of this early era often associated with the original punk ideals such as individualism, disdain for work and school, and live-for-the-moment attitudes. The movement was influenced by the political and social climate of its origin, around the time of the \\"Just Say No\\" campaign and a rise in conservative viewpoints. The discipline of the subculture came from a mix of leftist radicalism and conservative influences. Straight edge sentiments can be found in songs by the early 1980s band Minor Threat. This anti-inebriation movement had been developing in punk prior to Minor Threat, but their song \\"Straight Edge\\" was influential in giving the scene a name, and something of a (somewhat unwilling) figurehead. Minor Threat frontman Ian MacKaye is often credited with birthing the straight edge name and movement and in later years has often spoken out about how he never intended it to be a movement. Straight edge sentiments can also be found in the song \\"Keep it Clean\\" by English punk band The Vibrators, and the 1970s Modern Lovers song \\"I'm Straight\\" (which rejected drug use). As one of the few prominent 1970s hard rock icons to explicitly eschew alcohol and other drug use, Ted Nugent was also a key influence on the straight edge ideology.Henry Rollins reports that he and friend Ian MacKaye (vocalist for Minor Threat) \\"would read about the Nuge and the thing that really rubbed off on us was the fact that he didn't drink or smoke or do drugs ... [Nugent's performance] was the craziest thing we'd ever seen onstage and here's this guy saying, 'I don't get high.' We thought that was so impressive.\\" Straight edge started on the East Coast of the United States in Washington D.C., and quickly spread throughout the United States and Canada. By the 1980s, bands on the West Coast, such as America's Hardcore, Stalag 13, Justice League, and Uniform Choice, were gaining popularity. In the early stages of this subculture's history, concerts often consisted of both punk bands and straight edge bands. Circumstances soon changed and the early 1980s would eventually be viewed as the time \\"before the two scenes separated\\". Early straight edge bands included Minor Threat, State of Alert, Government Issue, Teen Idles, The Faith, 7 Seconds, SSD, DYS, and Negative FX. =Bent edge= Bent edge originated as a counter-movement to straight edge among members of the Washington, D.C. hardcore scene who were frustrated by the rigidity and intolerance of the scene. This idea spread, and on Minor Threat's first tour in 1982, people would come up to the band to identify themselves as bent, crooked, or curved edge. The counter-movement was short lived and it faded away by the end of the 1990s.Mullaney, Jamie L. \\"All In Time: Age And The Temporality Of Authenticity In The Straight-Edge Music Scene.\\" Journal of Contemporary Ethnography 41.6 (2012): 611-635. Academic Search Premier. Web. 9 Feb. 2013. Youth crew (mid-1980s) Youth of Today, Youth Crew pioneers During the youth crew era, which started in the mid-1980s, the influence of music on the straight edge scene seemed to be at an all-time high. The new branches of straight edge that came about during this era seemed to originate from ideas presented in songs, and many youth crew bands had a strong heavy metal influence. Notable youth crew bands included: Youth of Today, Gorilla Biscuits, Judge, Bold, Chain of Strength, Turning Point, Uniform Choice, and Slapshot. In the mid-1980s, the band Youth of Today became associated with the straight edge movement, and their song \\"Youth Crew\\" expressed a desire to unite the scene into a movement. Vegetarianism became an important theme in straight edge during this era, starting with Youth of Today's 1988 song \\"No More\\", which contained lyrics condemning the consumption of meat. as cited in This catalyzed a trend towards animal rights and veganism within the straight edge movement that would reach its peak in the 1990s. 1990s By the early 1990s, straight edge became a well-known part of the wider punk and DIY scene and underwent musical and political shifts. In the early part of the decade, a number of straight edge punks and their bands picked up on the vegetarian and other social justice politics of the mid-1980s and began more comprehensively advocating for social justice, animal liberation, veganism, and straight edge, itself. During this period, the straight edge scene birthed two major offshoots: the more conservative hardline and the religiously influenced Krishna Consciousness. While the majority of straight edge punks and Hare Krishna converts were pacifists, those influenced by hardline showed a willingness to resort to violence in order to promote their subculture. Musically, the straight edge scene was increasingly drawing from heavy metal and was a founding influence on metalcore. =Outside the United States= Point of No Return in 2006. In the late 1980s a vegetarian straight edge scene emerged in Durham, England. Heavily inspired by the sound of U.S. youth crew and straight edge bands, groups in the scene included Steadfast, False Face, No Way Out, Long Cold Stare, Know Your Enemy, The MacDonalds and Northern Wolfpack. Members of multiple of these bands would eventually form Voorhees. In the early to mid-1990s, straight edge spread from the United States to Northern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and South America. It grew around the world due to the relentless touring of youth crew bands and the ease of ordering records from American record labels via mail. Fluff Fest, which has been held in the Czech Republic since 2000 and draws audiences from across Europe, is linked to straight edge through its organizers and showcases prominent straight edge bands. 2000s By the beginning of the 2000s, only small groups of militant straight edge individuals remained. Contrary to news reports that portrayed straight edge as a gang, several studies have shown that straight edge individuals as a whole are mostly peaceful people. In the 2000s, there was a growing amount of tolerance of people who do not follow the straight edge lifestyle by straight edge individuals. In this incarnation of straight edge, the musical styles of the bands involved are more varied, ranging from a youth crew revival style to metalcore to posicore. Straight edge bands from the 2000s include Champion, Down to Nothing, Embrace Today, Have Heart, and Throwdown.  Ideology  In the early stages of straight edge, its philosophy was to rebel through self-control. With the ability to control one's actions, a straight edge participant would be better suited to stand up against the mainstream. The first wave of straight edge did not impose rules on others, rather participants chose to follow the ways of self- control. With the second wave of straight edge these rules were used to control others. In addition the second wave experienced a change in music style. Where the first wave was influenced by hardcore punk, the second wave brought in aspects of heavy metal music which further pushed for power and control over others. The slowing down of the music reflected the focus of individuals in their journey to self control.  X symbol  Italian straight edge band To Kill performing at a club The letter X is the most known symbol of straight edge, and is sometimes worn as a marking on the back of both hands, though it can be displayed on other body parts as well. Some followers of straight edge have also incorporated the symbol into clothing and pins. According to a series of interviews by journalist Michael Azerrad, the straight edge X can be traced to the Teen Idles' brief West Coast tour in 1980. The band's members were scheduled to play at San Francisco's Mabuhay Gardens, but when they arrived, club management discovered that they were all under the legal drinking age and would be denied entry to the club. As a compromise, management marked each of the members' hands with a large black X as a warning to the club's staff not to serve alcohol to the band. Upon returning to Washington, D.C., the band suggested this same system to local clubs as a means to allow teenagers in to see musical performances without being served alcohol. The Teen Idles released a record in 1980 called Minor Disturbance with the cover shot being two hands with black Xs on the back. The mark soon became associated with the straight edge lifestyle. It can also be used by drinking establishments to note a patron as under the drinking age, regardless of their views towards drugs such as alcohol. Later bands used the X symbol on album covers and other paraphernalia in a variety of ways. The cover of No Apologies by Judge shows two crossed gavels in the X formation. Other objects that have been used include shovels, baseball bats, and hockey sticks. A variation involving a trio of Xs is often used in flyers and tattoos. It can also be ironic, based on the fact that three Xs was popularized in cartoons and television shows to signify alcohol or poison. Moonshiners used an X to note how many times a particular batch of moonshine ran through the still, adding irony. The term is sometimes abbreviated by including an X with the abbreviation of the term \\"straight edge\\" to give \\"sXe\\". By analogy, hardcore punk is sometimes abbreviated to \\"hXc\\".  Approaches  Boston straight edge band Have Heart's 2019 reunion show outside the Worcester Palladium had the highest attendance of any hardcore show in history While some straight edge groups are treated as a \\"gang\\" by law enforcement officials, a 2006 study found the vast majority of people who identify as straight edge are nonviolent. While the early Washington, D.C. hardcore punk scene is often praised for its commitment to positive social change, both the youth crew movement of the 1980s and the vegan movement of the 1990s have drawn criticism. Straight edge has often been approached with skepticism and hostility, despite the ideologically less dogmatic and more multifaceted character of contemporary straight edge.  Veganism  By the late 1990s, many straight edge participants gave veganism the same degree of importance as abstinence from intoxicants, and some groups styled themselves \\"vegan straight edge\\", sometimes abbreviated \\"xVx\\". Bands such as Earth Crisis and Vegan Reich emphasized animal rights and environmentalism as social justice issues. Perhaps owing to the \\"DIY\\" ethic of the punk subculture, some advocated direct action, and became associated with the radical groups Animal Liberation Front and the Earth Liberation Front. The California band Vegan Reich is most associated with the \\"Hardline\\" subculture, which espouses the sanctity of life, and draws connections between animal rights and anti- abortion activism. Members of the Hardline movement have been described as espousing Old Testament-style spirituality, militancy, and violence. Violent activism has been described as an \\"extreme minority\\" within the vegan straight edge movement. Haenfler writes that straight edge participants see veganism as an extension of the movement's emphasis on positivity, much like its preference to reserve sex for emotionally meaningful relationships. They tend to focus more on personal responsibility and focus less on confronting systemic issues in society. However, veganism is not seen as a matter of personal purity, rather, it is rooted in a strong belief in animal rights, and it is also a means of personally rejecting the exploitation of animals. Some hold that veganism is \\"true straight edge\\", and their promotion of veganism and animal liberation has been described as evangelistic.

It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof and clapboarded exterior. The main block is five bays wide and only one room deep, with a large central chimney. A leanto section extends to the rear, giving the house a saltbox profile. The front entry is framed by half-length sidelight windows and pilasters supporting an entablature. The interior has retained much of its original woodwork and finish. The land this house stands on was originally granted to Increase Nowell, who never lived on his grant. By 1651 Richard Gardner was living on this land, which he purchased in 1659. Edward Gardner, one of his fifth-generation descendants built this house about 1764, the year he inherited the land. His descendants included Henry Gardner, the Massachusetts treasurer during the American Revolutionary War, and Henry Gardner, the Known Nothing Governor of Massachusetts in the 1850s. This house was sold out of the family after Edward's death in 1825. The house was purchased in 1931 by F. Patterson Smith, a Harvard-educated architect who later became dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Design, who undertook its restoration. His work included the removal of a 19th-century shoe-shop wing (now 2 Gardner Place), and converted the barn (which also stands on a now- separate lot) to a Shingle-style residence. This house is one of two in the town that predate the Revolution.

SPAWN's stated mission is to \\"protect endangered salmon in the Lagunitas Creek Watershed and the environment on which we all depend.\\"Salmon Protection & Watershed Network, About SPAWN ( [August 1, 2008]) SPAWN uses a multi-faceted approach to accomplish their mission including grassroots action, habitat restoration, policy development, research and monitoring, citizen training, environmental education, strategic litigation, and collaboration with other organizations and agencies.  Lagunitas Creek Watershed  The Lagunitas Creek Watershed in Marin County, California has been identified as the most important spawning and rearing habitat for wild coho salmon left in California. Coho in the Central California Evolutionarily Significant Unit (CCCESU) are a Federal and State listed Endangered Species considered to be \\"in imminent danger of extinction.\\"Salmon Protection & Watershed Network, Land Acquisition (http://spawnusa.org/pages/page-8 [August 4, 2008]) Despite having the best run of wild coho left in the State, estimated at up to 30 percent of the State‚Äôs total in 2007, only on average 500 adult salmon currently return each year to spawn here. The Lagunitas Creek Watershed is also important habitat for federally listed steelhead and California freshwater shrimp.Salmon Protection & Watershed Network, Land Acquisition (http://spawnusa.org/pages/page-8 [August 4, 2008]) SPAWN performs its work with the assistance of volunteer and pro bono contributions. Many dedicated individuals in the San Geronimo Valley, Marin County, and the greater San Francisco Bay Area have made a lasting impact on the accomplishments and history of SPAWN.  History  The seeds of SPAWN, the Salmon Protection And Watershed Network, were planted when biologist Todd Steiner, the founder, discovered migrating coho salmon stuck at Roy‚Äôs Dam in 1997 on the San Geronimo Valley Golf Course, unable to migrate upstream to spawn and complete their amazing life history. Steiner contacted the media to expose the plight of these recently listed endangered species and contacting National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) asking for an emergency permit to move the fish above the crumbling dam obstruction.Salmon Protection & Watershed Network, ‚ÄúSPAWN History,‚Äù SPAWN Brochure (2008]: 1 That night on the news, the plight of the salmon was beamed into Bay Area homes on five TV stations. Steiner set up his young son‚Äôs painting easel at Roy‚Äôs Dam with a hastily written petition asking for government action, as hundreds of people came forward to witness the spectacle first hand, sign the petition, and offer help. Residents, the general public, NGOs and government agencies came together to fix the immediate problem and Roy‚Äôs Dam was transformed into Roy‚Äôs Pools. SPAWN has grown from an all-volunteer organization to one with a full- time staff who coordinate the work of hundreds of volunteers and interns. In 1999 SPAWN was incorporated as a program under the umbrella of the non-profit 501(c)(3) environmental organization Turtle Island Restoration Network (TIRN).  Programs  SPAWN drives seven active programs and campaigns that focus on protecting endangered salmon and the Lagunitas Creek Watershed. These include habitat restoration, fish rescue, citizen training, creek monitoring, creek walks, land acquisition and water conservation.Salmon Protection & Watershed Network, Programs (August 2, 2008) Habitat restoration Each year SPAWN volunteers contribute many hundreds of hours towards restoring streamside habitat in the Lagunitas Creek Watershed. Volunteers work to plant native trees and understory plants, and remove invasive species. In 2005 SPAWN launched a community-based native plant nursery program that serves to grow thousands of native plants to support local restoration programs and provide plants to landowners living along stream corridors in the San Geronimo Valley.Salmon Protection & Watershed Network, Habitat Restoration (August 2, 2008) Fish rescue SPAWN‚Äôs fish rescue program focuses on fish relocation efforts within the San Geronimo Valley in the Lagunitas Creek Watershed. Streams are surveyed and as it becomes apparent that pools will dry completely, and based on previous years observations at known sites, relocation efforts begin. Relocation usually begins in June but can start as early as April depending on creek flows and rainfall. Over 15,000 juvenile coho and steelhead have been saved from imminent mortality since this effort began in 1999.Salmon Protection & Watershed Network, Fish Rescue (August 2, 2008) Rescue and relocation efforts take place under State and Federal permits. Citizen training SPAWN organizes and facilitates a number of citizen training programs that includes a Creek Naturalist Training, native plant collection and propagation, salmon seminar series, spawning salmon surveying and water quality monitoring.Salmon Protection & Watershed Network, Citizen Training (August 2, 2008) Creek monitoring SPAWN oversees a number of creek monitoring programs including water quality monitoring, out- migrant salmon smolt monitoring, and spawning salmon monitoring. Each year SPAWN also responds to many calls from concerned citizens about problems or emergencies on their property or at large. Staff and volunteers respond to these calls and help refer problems to the appropriate agencies if necessary or find ways to prevent or repair the problem.Salmon Protection & Watershed Network, Creek Monitoring (August 2, 2008) Creek walks During the winter season (Nov-Jan) SPAWN organizes weekly creek walks in the Lagunitas Creek Watershed for the public to view spawning salmon and provide education on watershed management issues. The walks are led by volunteer Naturalists that are trained through SPAWN‚Äôs annual Creek Naturalist Training Program each October.Salmon Protection & Watershed Network, Creek Walks (August 2, 2008) Land acquisition SPAWN‚Äôs land acquisition program is focused on efforts to protect riparian habitat along the Lagunitas Creek Watershed from increased development. SPAWN is promoting the creation of a land conservancy to protect the riparian habitat through land acquisition and conservation easements on private parcels along the watershed. Water conservation SPAWN‚Äôs water conservation program is focused on reducing the impacts of stormwater runoff on local streams and ensuring adequate in stream flow and spawning and rearing habitat for coho salmon and steelhead in the Lagunitas Creek. In partnership with the Marin Community Foundation, SPAWN recently launched a community-based program, the Marin County Stormwater Catchment & Water Conservation Initiative, to provide technical support, cost-share support and incentives to landowners who reduce runoff from their properties using roof-water harvesting techniques.Salmon Protection & Watershed Network, Water Conservation (http://spawnusa.org/pages/page-205 [August 4, 2008])  Accomplishments  Since SPAWN‚Äôs beginnings in 1996 the program has achieved a number of accomplishments: * In 2008 SPAWN received the coveted Peter Behr Award from the Environmental Action Committee of West Marin and the prestigious Ted Wellman Award from the Marin Conservation League for their efforts towards preserving the coho salmon and their habitat. * Identifying and documenting the importance of the San Geronimo Valley that makes up only 10% of the Lagunitas Creek Watershed but upwards of 40% of the spawning habitat and 30% of the young fish that rear in the Lagunitas Creek Watershed do so in this valley. * Documenting the continued degradation of this critical habitat in the San Geronimo Valley from the impacts of human development from hydrological disruption, and inputs of septic sewage, pesticides and sediment through water quality monitoring and on-the-ground habitat assessments. * Developing an environmental education program that has trained and organized hundreds of volunteers to learn and participate in habitat restoration techniques. * Re-creating and repairing riparian habitat on private and public lands and educating local landowners in sound fish-friendly living practices. * Growing a native plant nursery to provide local genetic stock plant material for restoration activities. * Installing and developing rain catchment systems and rain gardens at individual homes and at local schools through its Rain Harvesting Program. * Convincing Marin County, California to conduct a cumulative impact analysis of development on the salmon in the San Geronimo Valley and to place a two-year moratorium on construction in the 100-foot riparian (creek) corridors. * Helping defeat the Marin Municipal Water District's efforts to expand the Russian River Pipeline and import more water to Marin County, which would have impacted salmon populations in the Russian River and Eel River watersheds.

He served as his country's Minister of Foreign Relations from 2010 to 2015, during the presidency of Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner. Life and times Early life and career H√©ctor Timerman was born in Buenos Aires, to Risha (n√©e Mindlin) and Jacobo Timerman. He was of Lithuanian Jewish descent. He was named editor- in-chief of La Tarde, one of a number of periodicals owned by his father, in 1976, and steered the daily in support of the newly installed dictatorship. His father's kidnapping on 15 April 1977 prompted Timerman to become active in the defense of human rights, however, and in 1978 he was exiled to New York City, where, in 1981, he co-founded Americas Watch, the Western Hemisphere counterpart to Helsinki Watch that proceeded the creation of the unified Human Rights Watch. He later served in the board of directors of the Fund for Free Expression, a press freedom advocacy group based in London. During his exile in the U.S, he gained American citizenship. Journalist and activist Timerman earned a master's degree in international relations at Columbia University in 1981, and wrote several op-ed columns for the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Newsweek, and The Nation. After returning to Argentina in 1989, he founded two news magazines, Tres Puntos and Debate, and became a regular contributor to Noticias and √Åmbito Financiero. He also hosted a television news interview program, Di√°logos con Opini√≥n. Timerman was an early adherent to Congresswoman Elisa Carri√≥'s center-left ARI. Following elections in 2003, however, he became a close supporter of President N√©stor Kirchner. Timerman remained active in human rights advocacy. He served as a director of the Buenos Aires office of the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights from 2002 to 2004, and was President of the International Coalition of Historic Site Museums of Conscience. Timerman was the first witness to give testimony in the trial of Christian von Wernich, a former Buenos Aires Province Police chaplain convicted of complicity in numerous dictatorship-era murders and tortures (including that of his father). He published his observations on this issue in a 2005 book, Torture. Foreign Minister Foreign Minister Timerman and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Feb. 2012 President N√©stor Kirchner appointed Timerman Consul General in New York City in July 2004, and in December 2007, he was named Argentine Ambassador to the United States. Differences between President Cristina Kirchner and Foreign Minister Jorge Taiana, and an incident in which she called Taiana's loyalty into question, reportedly led to Taiana's resignation on 18 June 2010; Taiana's replacement by Timerman was announced the same day. Timerman's tenure was marked by intensified diplomatic foreign controversies. Bringing perpetrators of the 1994 AMIA bombing to justice was prioritized, pursuant to which he persuaded the neighboring government of Bolivia to cut short a state visit to that country in 2011 by Iranian Defense Minister Ahmad Vahidi (whose arrest Argentine authorities had sought since 2007 in connection with the attack), while also working to establish a Truth Commission jointly with Iran in 2013 to investigate the 1994 bombing. He likewise advanced ongoing efforts against vulture funds seeking payment at face value on bonds bought from resellers for pennies on the dollar, and whose attempts to block payments to all other bondholders continued to threaten Argentina's successful earlier debt restructuring. The longstanding Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute figured prominently during Timerman's tenure as well. Timerman said, \\"We have been trying to find a peaceful solution for 180 years. I think the fanatics are not in Buenos Aires.\\" His policy regarding the dispute remained assertive, refusing to accept a letter from a member of the Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands who ambushed Timerman following talks in February 2013 with U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague, obtaining declarations in support of Argentine sovereignty from African and Latin American nations, and later declaring that the Falklands \\"will be under our control within 20 years.\\" He nevertheless described the dispute in January 2014 as a \\"peaceful struggle\\". Arrest and death Timerman was arrested in late 2017 under charges of covering up Iranian involvement in the 1994 AMIA bombing which left 85 people dead. He died of cancer while he was under arrest on 30 December 2018.

This sept had their royal seat at Naas in the eastern part of the Liffey plain, Airthir Liphi. He was the son of Muirec√°n mac Diarmata (died 863), a previous king.Byrne, Table 9; √ì Corr√°in, pg.186 There is much confusion in the king lists during this period for Leinster. Francis John Byrne suggests that the root of this apparent confusion lay in the fact that the U√≠ D√∫nlainge kings exercised little real authority due to the aggressions of their western neighbour Cerball mac D√∫nlainge (died 888), King of Osraige. Cerball, while unable to install himself as king of Leinster, was able to prevent any rival king exercising real power there.Byrne, pg.163 Domnall would have succeeded his father as head of the U√≠ F√°el√°in sept in 863. His predecessor as King of Leinster, Ailill mac D√∫nlainge of the U√≠ Muiredaig sept had died in 871, however Muiredach mac Brain (died 885) of the U√≠ D√∫nchada sept is associated with the Leinster forces in association with events in 870 and 875.Annals of Ulster, AU 870.2, AU 875.2 According to the Chronicum Scotorum and other Irish annals, Domnall assumed the kingship of Leinster in 880.Chronicum Scotorum, CS 880 This would place his effective reign in 880-884.he king list in the Book of Leinster gives him a reign of three years In 874 the high king √Åed Findliath (died 879) had invaded Leinster in an attempt to impose his authority and he plundered the country and burned churches including Cell Ausili.AU 874.4 In 880 the new High King Flann Sinna (died 916) attacked Leinster and took hostages imposing his authority.CS 880 In 884 Domnall was killed by his own associates.AU 884.3 His brother Cerball mac Muirec√°in (died 909) became King of Leinster in 885.

History 'Dabinett' probably dates from the early 1900s, when it was found by William Dabinett growing as a wilding (a natural seedling) in a hedge at Middle Lambrook, South Petherton, Somerset.Morgan, Richards and Dowle, The New Book of Apples, Ebury, 2002, p.282 The exact genetic makeup of Dabinett is unknown, though one 'parent' was probably the Chisel Jersey apple, a similar late \\"bittersweet\\" variety. The variety became very popular and was widely planted across the south-west of England. A seedling of this variety, known as 'Black Dabinett', also locally known as 'Tommy Rodford', arose at Kingsbury Episcopi near Martock.Morgan, Richards and Dowle, p.281 It is similar to 'Dabinett' proper but is purplish in colour and generally more vigorous. Characteristics Classed as a \\"bittersweet\\" cider apple, 'Dabinett' has small, yellow-green fruit flecked with red, usually harvested in November in the United Kingdom. The flesh is greenish and aromatic. The tree has a relatively small and spreading habit; it has a high resistance to apple scab and canker. Acid content 0.18% The fruit is of sufficient quality to make a single varietal cider, and a number of commercial cider manufacturers produce ciders made solely or primarily with 'Dabinett' apples, including Marshwood Vale Cider, The Tricky Cider Co, Thatchers and Sheppy's.

Winnona Park is located south of downtown Decatur; west of the Village of Avondale Estates, Georgia and the Forest Hills subdivision; and east of Decatur's Oakhurst community. It primarily consists of residences, but is also known as the home of Columbia Theological Seminary. Its rough boundaries are Mimosa Drive and the Decatur city limits on the south; East College Avenue and the railroad tracks on the north; South Candler Street on the west; and South Columbia Avenue on the east. In addition, the commercial buildings on the east side of South Columbia Ave. at East College Ave. have historically been part of this community. This commercial cluster historically housed the neighborhood pharmacy, gas station and barbershop. The early families of Winnona Park also have historic links to Agnes Scott College, which adjoins Winnona Park on the northeast. However, the South Candler Street‚ÄîAgnes Scott College Historic District is listed separately on the National Register of Historic Places. The City of Decatur has also designated South Candler Street - Agnes Scott College as a local historic district. Bounded by East College Ave., South McDonough St, South Candler St., East Hill St. and East Davis St., it is no longer considered part of Winnona Park. In addition, the Forrest Hills community east of South Columbia Avenue is located in unincorporated DeKalb County, and is not considered part of Winnona Park. However, the City of Decatur announced in 2008 that they were considering the annexation of Forrest Hills. History Main entrance to Columbia Theological Seminary, Winnona Park neighborhood, Decatur, GA Winnona Park contained farms and estates in the 19th century. \\"Winnona\\" is named for the Winn family, who came to DeKalb County, Georgia in the first half of the 19th Century. James J. Winn was a clergyman and a surgeon in the C.S.A. His son-in-law, George Bucher Scott, began the development of Winnona Park. The 1868 farmhouse of another early settler, James C. Avary, still remains on South Columbia Drive. The \\"Avary-Fulton House\\",\\"\\" Winnona Park Neighborhood Association: History\\" Retrieved: 18 August 2008. named after the Avary and Fulton families (that constructed and later purchased the home, respectively), was part of a farm that listed 19 slaves in the 1860 census. During the U.S. Civil War, Union troops first occupied Decatur in July 1864. An 1864 map of Decatur shows Union trenches along East College Avenue, from South Columbia to Adams Street, just south of the railroad tracks. This gave the Union troops strategic control of the rail line. The Union troops, under General Schofield, were driven north through Decatur to the cemetery by Confederate troops under General Wheeler. However, the city fell to the Union again shortly before the Battle of Atlanta. The North Georgia Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, purchased a small farm on the east side of South Columbia Drive in 1873 and relocated from Norcross, Georgia. By the start of the 20th century, 125 boys and girls lived at the \\"Decatur Orphans' Home\\" (as it was then known). The campus is presently known as the \\"United Methodist Children's Home\\". The development of Winnona Park as a residential area began in the early 20th century. George B. Scott, a member of the Scott family that founded Agnes Scott College and Scottdale Mills, purchased the property from Dr. James Avary and began developing it. The earliest business district began at East College and South Candler.\\", In 1913, Joseph Hughey operated a drug store, which was across the railroad tracks from Decatur's train depot. (This location now houses Farmstead 303.) In 1923, the Winnona Park Elementary School was constructed; the original school building is still used by the City of Decatur Schools and is the centerpiece of the community.

Many of those doing it have voiced online that they start by doing five minutes a day and build up the intervals over time, with some extending it to 30 minutes or more. Proponents believe that blanket training helps very young children to learn self-control. Critics of the technique cite the use of corporal punishment in conjunction with blanket training, although this is not necessarily involved. The system is focused on rewards such as the toys given to the child, and regular positive reinforcement rather than punishment. Proponents of blanket training cite the technique as a means to keep very young children occupied and in a safe place while a parent is busy with tasks nearby, or in public places such as a crowded park. Blanket training, also known as 'blanket time,' is a method adapted from the methods encouraged in To Train Up a Child, a controversial parenting book which includes and advocates techniques that have been linked to multiple child deaths. Dr. Robert Bucknam, M.D., and co-author Gary Ezzo are also proponents of blanket training, as referenced in their On Becoming Babywise system of parent-centered child-rearing.

Bertram also served the Carnegie Corporation of New York from its inception in 1911 as secretary and trustee until his death in 1934. He thus continued to have an important role in Carnegie's philanthropic projects after Carnegie's death in 1919. Early life Bertram was born in Corstorphine, near Edinburgh, the Scottish capital where was educated at Daniel Stewart's College. His first position was with the Great Northern and Northeastern Railway company in Edinburgh. He emigrated to South Africa, where he continued to work in the railway industry. He returned to Scotland for health reasons in 1897, and was recruited by Andrew Carnegie, who had recently acquired a Scottish home, Skibo Castle. Activities in the United States In the US Bertram by 1908 supervised Carnegie's library program. He took a close interest in the new Carnegie libraries, commenting on the architectural plans submitted by applicants. Bertram's interventions discouraged extravagant architectural features and encouraged adherence to published guidelines. The Carnegie Libraries in Iowa Project notes that Bertram was empowered by Andrew Carnegie to carry on negotiations, answer questions, and oversee contractual arrangements. The Carnegie Libraries in Iowa Project further asserts that Bertram, and not Carnegie, was the one who established the eligibility requirements for a community to receive funding. While he did not exhibit much of a fluid or articulate communication style -- leaving his letters, notes, responses, etc. more confused and misinformed than enlightened by his instructions, Bertram considered the power Carnegie entrusted to him as a kind of sacred trust demanding his protection. Therefore, Bertram established the primary requirements that the community population should be sufficiently large to support the library. He also determined, as time went on, that beautiful architectural enhancements that adorned the library buildings ‚Äì domes, marble staircases, statues -- had to be eliminated in order to cut down on costs and to improve the libraries functionality and working space for library services. He began a campaign of informing inquiring groups with pamphlets on the need for practicality of design so that the grant amount would cover the construction costs to make it ready for immediate occupancy and fulfillment of its purpose. Bertram's rigorous guardianship of the Carnegie trust had the immediate effect he desired; however, it also caused substantial difficulties for some Iowa communities seeking to build libraries with Carnegie funding. It was these stipulations that Alice S. Tyler quietly but strongly objected to during her time as Secretary, seeking to have them removed and encouraging Iowa communities to pursue local financial support and reject the Carnegie funds. Bertram authored Notes on Library Buildings, a work which included complete plans, in 1910. with Bertram also involved himself with grants for pipe organs, and other projects. Booker T. Washington's published correspondence gives details of how Bertram acted as an intermediary between Carnegie and the recipients of his largesse.Booker T.

The district is roughly triangular in shape, bounded in the north by Bacon Street, on the west by Church Street, Sheffield West, and Sheffield Road, and on the south and heast by the Upper Mystic Lake and Mystic Valley Parkway. It is characterized by winding roads, with relatively large houses on well-proportioned lots. Most of the houses were built between 1890 and 1916, and all exhibit some architectural sophistication. A significant number of properties were designed by either F. Patterson Smith or Dexter Blaikie, two local architects. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. This residential area was not formally laid out as a subdivision. It was in this area that Massachusetts politician and orator Edward Everett had an estate in the 1850s; it is for him that Everett Avenue is named. The earliest house is at 8 Everett Avenue, built in 1880, in the Colonial Revival style, which predominated in construction until the advent of the 20th century. One of the finest examples of this style is the Smith-designed Chadwick House at 24 Everett Avenue, combining stucco walls with brick trim on the corners and window trim. Houses built in the 20th century tended by be either Neo-Rationalist, Tudor Revival, or Craftsman in their styling. Many houses in this time were designed either by Dexter Blaikie, Phineas Nickerson, or both in partnership. A house Blaikie designed for himself, at 45 Everett Avenue, is a relatively simple example of Tudor Revival styling. A more elaborate example of that style, designed by Blaikie and Nickerson is the Martin House at 23 Sheffield Road. The district includes a total of 129 properties, of which only 20 do not contribute to its significance. These are mostly excluded because they do not meet the normal 50-year cutoff period for historical significance, although a few buildings have been compromised by unsympathetic alterations.

The Leonard & Larry strip first appeared in a 1984 issue of Gay Comix, then were later featured in The Advocate and Frontiers magazines. The comic series is collected in four volumes published by Palliard Press. Career Barela began working as a cartoonist in 1976, producing an untitled comic strip for Cycle News. This led to strips such as \\"Just Puttin\\" for Biker magazine (1977-1978), \\"Short Strokes\\" for Cycle World (1977-1979), \\"Hard Tale\\" for Choppers (1978-1979), \\"The Adventures of Rickie Racer,\\" \\"The Adventures of Eric Enchilada,\\" and \\"The Puttin Gourmet...America's Favorite Low-Life Epicurean\\" for Biker Lifestyle, and FTW News (1979). In 1980 he developed for possible syndication a comic strip titled \\"Ozone,\\" which included a gay character named Leonard who had a \\"roommate\\" named Larry. The strip was unsuccessful, and he pitched another strip featuring those two characters to LGBT news magazine The Advocate which also turned it down. Editor Robert Triptow encouraged Barela to develop the Leonard & Larry strip into longer multi-page stories, which was first featured in Gay Comix #5. Following its debut, Leonard & Larry would go on to be featured in Gay Comix #7 in 1986, Gay Comix #10 in 1987, Gay Comics #14 in 1991, as well as its own special issue of Gay Comix dedicated to Leonard & Larry in 1992. The strip was also featured in Strip AIDS USA. A later editor at The Advocate ran the series from 1988 to 1990, after which it was published in rival LGBT news magazine Frontiers for many years. The strip was also part of Out of the Inkwell, a play presented in 1994 by San Francisco's Theatre Rhinoceros. The Leonard & Larry collection Kurt Cobain & Mozart Are Both Dead was a nominee for the Lambda Literary Award in the Humor category. Personal life Barela became a fundamentalist Christian in high school, but began attending a Metropolitan Community Church congregation in 1980. He is a former avid motorcyclist. Barela has a passion for Western wear which he describes as his \\"cowboy fetish.\\" In all of the strips Barela has published, at least one character has appeared in Western garb. Additionally, he considers himself to be part of the Bear community as well as a fan of it.  Leonard and Larry  The Leonard and Larry comic strip was first published in Gay Comix #5 in 1984, and would go on to be featured in Gay Comix #7 in 1986, Gay Comix #10 in 1987, and Gay Comics #14 in 1991, as well as its own special issue of Gay Comix in 1992. Leonard and Larry has been praised for being comic strip which represents characters of different gender identities, sexual orientations, ages, and sexual preferences as a community. The characters in the comic strip also age over time, as illustrated through graying hair, expanding bald patches, and growing children, which defies the tradition of comic characters appearing to be ageless. The strip has also received praise for its representations of queer family structures. Incorporating themes of domesticity and unique family structures in the strip sets Leonard & Larry apart from many other gay comic strips from its time. Leonard & Larry has been noted for Barela's attention to detail, particularly in his renderings of hair and beards. According to Alison Bechdel, \\"No one renders facial hair like Tim Barela, I always say. He does the most fabulous beards - he seems to draw each individual strand of hair.\\" Books Leonard & Larry has been released in four different collections published by Palliard Press which include: * Domesticity Isn't Pretty (1993), * Kurt Cobain & Mozart Are Both Dead (1996), * Excerpts from the Ring Cycle in Royal Albert Hall (2000), * How Real Men Do It (2003), References External links * Profile: Tim Barela from Prism Comics Living people American comics writers American comic strip cartoonists Gay writers Gay artists Bear (gay culture) LGBT comics creators LGBT writers from the United States LGBT artists from the United States People from Temecula, California 1954 births LGBT people from California ","title":"Tim Barela"},{"id":"18831042","text":"The Firth‚ÄìGlengarry Historic District encompasses a residential area of Winchester, Massachusetts consisting of well-preserved high quality houses built mainly between 1880 and 1900. The district lies between Wildwood Street and Wedge Pond, and includes properties on Pine Street, Glengarry Road, Grassmere Avenue, Dix Street, and Wildwood Street; houses on Curtis Street and Curtis Circle, are excluded from the district. Much of the area was laid out by developer William Firth, and many of its houses were designed by Boston architect Robert Coit. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Prior to William Firth's consolidation of land ownership southwest of Wedge Pond in the late 19th century, this area of Winchester was sparsely inhabited. The oldest house in the area is an 1843 Greek Revival structure at 3 Wildwood Street. Two houses were built near Wedge Pond in the 1850s and 1860s, of which the Charles Curtis House (1965, 9-11 Grassmere Avenue) is a particularly fine example of Carpenter Gothic; the Bellows House, built in 1854, is also Gothic Revival in character. In the 1880s and early 1890s three Queen Anne/Stick style houses were built, of which the Langley House (1887) at 10 Pine Street is the most elaborate. After Firth had acquired most of the land in the area, he subdivided into ample house lots, and laid out Glengarry Road and Grassmere Avenue. He hired Robert Coit to design houses which are predominantly Colonial Revival and Medieval Revival (Tudor) in character. Coit's designs used shingling to a significant degree, and mixed in features from other popular revival styles. Firth's own house at 37 Dix Street, built in 1937, is, however, a relatively straightforward Colonial Revival design, with a gambrel roof and modillioned cornice, and with gable dormers and a full-width front porch supported by Doric columns.

Built about 1865, it is a well-preserved example of Second Empire architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The George Brine House stands northeast of downtown Winchester, on the east side of Washington Street, a busy north-south through street, between Eaton and Webster Streets. It is a two-story wood frame house, with a third floor under its Second Empire mansard roof. It has a full-width porch with turned balusters and paired pillars, with a projecting central section with decorative brackets. Above the central doorway are a pair of narrow round-arch windows, and the cornice has dentil moulding and paired brackets. There is scroll-cut woodwork surrounding the dormer windows, and all of the main windows have bracketed sills. Two two- story ells extend the building to the rear, and there is a period carriage barn with cupola at the back of the property. The house was built sometime between 1854 and 1870 (estimated 1865 based on style) by Joseph Shattuck, a local builder. He apparently used it as a rental property until selling it to George Brine in 1893. The house typifies development made in the mid-19th century to attract new residents to what was then seen as a fashionable residential area.

He is generally depicted as an unjust tyrant who mistreats the local people of Nottinghamshire, subjecting them to unaffordable taxes. Robin Hood fights against him, stealing from the rich, and the Sheriff, in order to give to the poor; a characteristic for which Robin Hood is best known. It is not conclusively known exactly who this character is based on, but it would have been one of (or a composite of multiple of) the people who have occupied the post of the High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and the Royal Forests. If, as in many versions of the Robin Hood legend, the action of the story is placed during the absence of King Richard I of England during the Third Crusade, the character could be identified with the little-known William de Wendenal; however, the Sheriff more usually remains either anonymous or pseudonymous. Character The holder of the office of Nottingham's Sheriff, it is his task to capture outlaws such as Robin Hood, either to ensure the safety of trade routes through Sherwood Forest or to keep them from poaching the King's deer. In some stories, the Sheriff of Nottingham is portrayed as having a lecherous desire for Robin Hood's lady Maid Marian. He is widely considered to be the principal villain of the Robin Hood stories, appearing frequently alongside such enemies of Robin Hood as Sir Guy of Gisbourne or Prince John (though rarely both). The legends are generally set far from Nottingham; this fits the historical position of High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and the Royal Forests (from 1068 until 1568). In the film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, the Sheriff's influence outside the region of Nottingham has grown so great, he attempts to take control of the throne. In some versions, the Sheriff is a cowardly schemer while his assistant, Sir Guy of Gisbourne, is a more competent and determined physical threat to Robin. In other versions, the Sheriff answers to Prince John. Portrayals On stage *He was portrayed on Broadway in 1891 in The Sheriff of Nottingham by H. C. Barnabee.Pictorial History of the American Theatre:1860-1985 p.40 c.1985(this version updated to 1985) by Daniel Blum;Crown Publishers In film and television * In the 1938 film The Adventures of Robin Hood, starring Errol Flynn in the title role, the Sheriff is portrayed by Melville Cooper. He is nominally characterised as a coward and a secondary to Sir Guy of Gisbourne but is actually quite intelligent. For instance, he is the one who prudently advises Sir Guy to increase their caravan's security to ward off a possible ambush by Robin Hood, which Sir Guy disregards to his sorrow, and he is the mastermind of the archery tournament trap that successfully captures Robin Hood. When King Richard reclaims the throne, the Sheriff of Nottingham is among the followers of Prince John that are exiled from England. * In the 1950s ITV series The Adventures of Robin Hood, he is portrayed by Alan Wheatley who portrays him as a competent and ruthless enemy who is not quite Robin's equal in combat. Wheatley was replaced late in the series with John Arnatt as the deputy Sheriff, a more treacherous, duplicitous villain who was more on par with Robin's fighting skills. * In The Goon Show episode, Ye Bandit of Sherwood Forest first broadcast on 28 December 1954, the Sheriff of Nottingham is portrayed by Peter Sellers as Hercules Grytpype-Thynne. When the script was rewritten as Robin Hood and his Mirry Mon, recorded on 2 December 1956, the part was played by Valentine Dyall. * In the Disney version of Robin Hood, the Sheriff is a large anthropomorphic wolf voiced by Alabama-born comedian Pat Buttram. He serves as Prince John's chief enforcer, collecting unlimited taxes from the people of Nottingham and hunting Robin Hood and Little John. This version is depicted as being far less smart than he realizes, claiming he can see through Robin Hood's disguises when he fails to see through two of them. In addition, he has vulture soldiers named Nutsy and Trigger that work for him. In the film's climax, he briefly battles Robin inside Prince John's burning tower and is left trapped behind some curtains, but the film's final scene makes it clear that he survived. The Sheriff of Nottingham is last seen breaking rocks down in the Royal Rock Pile, having been sentenced to do so along with Prince John and Sir Hiss by King Richard while being overseen by Nutsy and Trigger. During story development, the animators considered experimenting with a different animal concept for the villain by making him a goat. However, they were over-ruled by the director who wanted to keep to traditional animal stereotypes and ordered the Sheriff be a wolf. * In the 1975 BBC TV series The Legend of Robin Hood, the Sheriff is played by Paul Darrow. He is portrayed as a ruthless schemer, willing to murder the Archbishop of Grantham in order to guarantee silence. He is close friends with Prince John, usually sharing his plans with him, and is frequently seen playing chess with himself. * In Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, in which he is the main antagonist, he is portrayed by Alan Rickman. His given name is said to be George. As the Prince John character is completely absent from this adaptation, this Sheriff is more ambitious than most depictions. The Sheriff's agenda is apparently to supplant Richard the Lionheart by marrying into royalty, eventually becoming king, or at least ensuring his future descendants would assume the throne. * He was portrayed by Keith Allen in the BBC series Robin Hood, from 2006. Allen plays the Sheriff, named Vaisey, as a psychopath with a manipulative, sarcastic nature. In the show's third series, Vaisey is deposed by Prince John as a result of his failure to assassinate King Richard, whereupon he fakes his own death. He is temporarily replaced by his seeming killer, Guy of Gisborne, for one episode before Gisborne is outlawed; Gisborne's sister Isabella becomes Sheriff for several episodes before Vaisey returns, planning to regain Nottingham by force, in the series finale. * In the anime series Robin Hood no Daib≈çken, the main antagonist Baron Alwyn (voiced by Masashi Ebara) is based on the Sheriff of Nottingham in both character design and personality as well as actions. He taxes the people and his workers while keeping them working for him. Near the end of the series, due to Robin's constant thwarting and a near death experience by him, he seemingly starts to make a change for the better until coming across a plot that would allow him to take over the kingdom; thus changing him back to his greedy, inconsiderate self. Once again, however, his plan of action is stopped by Robin and his allies as well as King Richard. * The Richard Kluger novel The Sheriff of Nottingham gives a positive portrayal of the real-life 13th-century sheriff Philip Mark as a good man doing a thankless task. (The same sheriff appeared as a ruthless despot in an episode of the Robin of Sherwood TV series.) * In the animated series Young Robin Hood, The Sheriff of Nottingham (voiced by A.J. Henderson) is a harsh man and good swordsman. He serves as one of the show's main antagonists and works for Prince John. * The Sheriff of Nottingham is spoofed as Mervyn, \\"The Sheriff of Rottingham\\" (portrayed by Roger Rees), in Mel Brooks' 1993 movie Robin Hood: Men in Tights. This depiction of the Sheriff appears to suffer from a form of aphasia, often mixing up his words. When the Sheriff of Rottingham is badly wounded by Robin Hood, the witch Latrine saves him by giving him a magical Life Saver in exchange for marriage. * The Sheriff was parodied in the children's television series Maid Marian and her Merry Men as a foolish schemer, portrayed by Tony Robinson. * The Sheriff is more sympathetically portrayed by Robert Shaw in the 1976 film Robin and Marian. He is also shown in this film to not only equal Robin physically, but also be superior to him, as he dominates Robin in a one-on-one sword fight towards the end of the movie, almost killing Robin. * In Robin of Sherwood, the Sheriff is portrayed as a cynical opportunist given to violent outbursts, portrayed by Nickolas Grace. His name, Robert de Rainault, comes from Evelyn Charles Vivian's retelling of the legend. He also bears the dubious honour of being the first sheriff to successfully kill Robin. Grace's portrayal of a moody and obsessive individual, with a sardonic sense of black humour, was a notable influence on future interpretations of the role. * A cowardly, inept and lecherous Sheriff of Nottingham is portrayed by actor Matthew Macfadyen in the 2010 Ridley Scott film Robin Hood. The original spec script from which the film developed, \\"Nottingham\\", the Sheriff, based on Robert of Thornham, is the protagonist in the story, working to solve a string of murders for which an antihero Robin Hood has been falsely accused. * In the Star Trek The Next Generation episode \\"Qpid\\", Q takes on the role of the Sheriff of Nottingham. * In the 2001 video game Stronghold Crusader, the Sheriff of Nottingham appears in it as an AI character. He is portrayed as a cruel lord who will use every dirty trick in the book to increase his power. * The Sheriff of Nottingham is the main villain in Beyond Sherwood Forest where he is named Malcolm and portrayed by Julian Sands. This version is more antagonistic than Prince John. In this film as part of his plan to find Robin Hood, Malcolm uses a cursed girl named Alina (portrayed by Katharine Isabelle) who can turn into a dragon-like creature. By the end of the film, Alina's creature form sacrifices her life so that Robin Hood can slay Malcolm. * In 2013, Wil Traval portrayed the Sheriff and his counterpart Keith in Lacey, an episode of the second season of Once Upon a Time. * Ben Miller played the Sheriff in \\"Robot of Sherwood\\", the third episode of the eighth series of Doctor Who. In this portrayal, he is killed when Robin Hood knocks him into a vat of liquid gold. * Ben Mendelsohn portrayed the Sheriff in the 2018 film Robin Hood. After the Sheriff is hanged by Robin during the film's climax, he is succeeded by Will \\"Scarlet\\" Tillman. In literature * The Sheriff of Nottingham appears as an antagonist in a series of Young adult fantasy books ‚ÄúSisters Grimm‚Äù, where he is depicted as a law enforcer in Ferryport Landing, still harboring a deep hatred for Robin Hood, his sworn enemy.

History An Air Force Research Laboratory program was started in 2004 at the AFRL Air Vehicles Directorate. The initial program was the evaluation of technologies that could be used for AAR. The key new concept is the use of precision GPS. The AAR program has since held several flight tests. The important factors were the software and communication systems that kept the aircraft at the proper altitude and speed. In 2007, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), with the help of NASA, demonstrated automatic refuelling from a conventional tanker by a high-performance aircraft. A pilot was on board to supervise, so the demonstration was not entirely automated. It served as the basis for DARPA's Autonomous High-Altitude Refueling program which, in 2012, demonstrated the potential for fully autonomous aerial refueling of unmanned air vehicles. The final test involved modified RQ-4 drones flying in close formation less than 100 ft from a tanker, close enough for refueling to take place. Automated flight control Appropriate flight control systems (FCS) include sensors to detect the position of the tanker and its refueling drogue along with rules to control the client aircraft. Several different techniques have been proposed for controlling the refueling process. One proposal involves the use of LED beacons on the drogue and an optical sensor on the tanker to determine the drogue's position and attitude. A second involves treating the drogue's position as fixed, ignoring turbulence with the help of a low-pass filter in the control system.

Biography Carr was born into an acting family on July 4, 1907 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His father was the actor William Carr and his mother was the actress Mary Carr. Thomas Carr followed the family profession, and in 1915 began acting in silent films. From 1915 through 1953, Carr played small supporting roles in a number of low budget Hollywood films. However, Carr's star as an actor did not rise. In 1945, he turned to directing, and from 1945 through 1951 Carr directed numerous B movies for Hollywood's poverty row. Most of Carr's films were Westerns; however, in 1948 he was co-director (along with Spencer Gordon Bennet) of the live-action Superman serial. From 1951 to 1968, Carr's directing was focused mainly on television. He directed episodes of numerous television shows in the 1950s and 1960s, including episodes of Lassie, Adventures of Superman, Daniel Boone, Wanted: Dead or Alive, and Gunsmoke.

He invented the masticator, a machine that shredded rubber scraps and which allowed rubber to be recycled after being formed into blocks or sheets. A blue plaque commemoration is placed on No. 4 High Street in Marlborough, Wiltshire in his honour (also one for his brother). Early life Hancock was born in 1786 in Marlborough, Wiltshire, and little is known about his early life. His father was a cabinet maker and it is possible that Thomas Hancock was trained in the same trade: in 1815 he is recorded as being in partnership with his brother, Walter, in London, as a coach builder. Career Hancock's interest in rubber seems to have sprung from a desire to make waterproof fabrics to protect the passengers on his coaches. By 1819 he had begun to experiment with making rubber solutions. In 1820 he patented fastenings for gloves, suspenders, shoes and stockings; in the process of creating these early elastic fabrics, Hancock found himself wasting large amounts of rubber. He invented a machine to shred the waste rubber, his \\"Pickling machine\\" (or \\"masticator\\" as it is now known). He called it by the deceptive name of \\"Pickling\\" because he initially chose not to patent it, instead preferring to rely on secrecy. In 1820, Hancock rented a factory in Goswell Road, London, where he worked raw rubber with the machines he had invented. His machines produced a warm mass of homogeneous rubber that could then be shaped and mixed with other materials, and was more easily dissolved than raw rubber. The prototype of his masticator was operated by one man and could only hold ; it was a wooden machine with a hollow cylinder studded with metal \\"teeth\\", with an inner studded core that was hand-cranked. By 1821 he had produced a two-man machine that held , and by 1841, he had created a machine that could process up to of rubber at a time. Hancock experimented with rubber solutions and in 1825 patented a process of making artificial leather using rubber solution and a variety of fibres. His choice of solvents, coal oil and turpentine, was probably influenced by Charles Macintosh's 1823 patent. In the same year he began working with Macintosh to manufacture his \\"double textured\\" fabric. By 1830 it was obvious to everyone concerned that Hancock's leather solution, prepared with his masticated rubber, was better than Macintosh's. The two inventors merged their companies and began more fully co-operating, constructing, for example, an automatic spreading machine to replace the paint brushes previously used by Macintosh. In 1834, Hancock's London factory burned down and Macintosh had already closed his Glasgow factory. The work was moved to Manchester where, in 1838, another fire destroyed that factory. A new factory was soon built and business continued as before, even though Macintosh's 1823 patent had expired in 1837. It was only in 1837 that Hancock finally patented both his masticator and spreader (UK patent 7,344). Although the Mackintosh style of coat has become generic (abbreviated as mac or mack), the company that Hancock and Mackintosh established lives on as two separate entities, Mackintosh and Hancock Vulcanised Articles. Both continue to make rubberised coats using the same techniques and procedures pioneered by the two inventors, with Hancock Vulcanised Articles alone continuing to use the original Victorian Mill for all fabric production. Vulcanisation On 21 November 1843, Hancock took out a patent for the vulcanisation of rubber using sulphur, 8 weeks before Charles Goodyear in the US (30 January 1844). He mentioned in his \\"Personal Narrative\\" that his friend William Brockedon invented the word vulcanisation from the god Vulcan of Roman mythology. Hancock did not credit himself with discovering the reaction of sulphur with rubber; he instead said that in 1842 Brockendon had showed him some American rubber samples which had been treated with sulphur. Brockendon later said in an affidavit that he never heard or knew of Hancock analysing the Goodyear samples, a claim Hancock verifies in his \\"Personal Narrative\\", where he claimed he had been experimenting with sulphur for many years himself. A number of chemists also swore that even if he had analysed Goodyear's material, this would not have given him enough information to duplicate the process. Alexander Parkes, inventor of the \\"cold cure\\" process (vulcanisation of fabrics using sulphur chloride in a carbon disulphide solution), claimed that both Hancock and Brockendon admitted to him that their experiments on the Goodyear samples had enabled them to understand what he had done. The firm had large display stands at the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London and at the 1855 Exposition Universelle in Paris. In 1857 Hancock published the story of his life's work as \\"The Origin and Progress of the Caoutchouc or India-Rubber Industry in England\\". Death He died 26 March 1865, at Stoke Newington. Inspiration Eiichiro Oda drew inspiration from Thomas Hancock to create the character, Boa Hancock, who's in love with a man made of rubber in the Japanese manga and anime series, One Piece.

It is described as a noir thriller starring Scottish actor John Hannah, Frederick Schmidt, Golden Globe nominated actress Cathy Tyson and Romanian actress Ana Uluru. The Wee Review stated it was \\"A well-crafted noir thriller that satisfies the sadistic cinema goer with its darkly uncompromising take on the genre\\". Another critic commented ‚ÄúA shocking, dark, vicious, violent, forceful, engrossing, touching, beautiful film! The film of the Edinburgh Film Festival.‚Äù In February 2018 it premiered on Netflix.  Birmingham  Edgar has said that the UK city of Birmingham \\"has become my film set and I love it\\". He regularly uses the city as a location. He contributed to the book Remaking Birmingham - The Visual Culture of Urban Regeneration in which he outlines the importance of architecture in the city's cinematic representations. He discusses the heritage of Birmingham as a base for broadly comic cinema in his essay \\"Take me Higher - Birmingham and Cinema\\". He cites his own short film Round which used the architecture of Birmingham's iconic Rotunda building as a location prior to its renovation in 2003. His company 104 Films is named after a bus route in the city.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0249210/  Film and disability  Edgar runs 104 Films, a company established in 2004 which provides training and opportunities for disabled people in the film industry. Edgar himself is hard of hearing and has said that it is a personal passion of his to put \\"disability in the conscience behind the camera as much as in front of it\\". The company have completed many projects for London Olympics, the British Film Institute and Creative Skillset. In 2013 Edgar was invited to meet Her Royal Highness the Queen in respect of his work in disability and film. 104 Films have produced or co-produced feature films related to disability including Special People, Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll, and I am Breathing. Notes on Blindness, premiered at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival and was released in UK cinemas in June 2016. It went on to be nominated for three BAFTAs including Best British Film and won the BIFA for Best Documentary. 104 films also invested in the documentary Unrest about a woman with ME which was shortlisted for the 2018 Best Documentary Oscar and Being Frank: The Chris Sievey Story which was also critically acclaimed and nominated for a BIFA following a premiere at SXSW. Edgar has written about representations of disability and film in the UK's The Guardian arguing for more disabled talent behind the camera. He has also appeared on BBC Radio 4 proposing a disability version of the Bechdel Test for film called the 104 test which states that 1) The film must have a disabled actor playing a disabled character or a disabled writer or director; 2) The disabled character does not have to overcome diversity 3) The disabled character is not able-bodied either at the beginning or end of the film On Channel 4 News in 2019 he was interviewed and spoke of how depictions of disability are damaging because they \\"are about loss\\". He has also contributed to the diversity debate in events such as Screen Internationals round table on diversity in the film industry and BAFTA's Diversify conference. The credits of We Are the Freaks end with the phrase \\"Powered by disability\\". In 2020 Edgar created his first visual arts exhibition about the disabled armed resistance movement, Reasonable Adjustment, funded by the Arts Council of England. This collection of artefacts, documentaries, photographs and press cuttings included a television camera which had been shot by activists during a raid on BBC Pebble Mill television studios. The exhibition opened at The Art House contemporary art gallery in Wakefield in January 2020 and was due to tour to The Attenborough Arts Centre in Leicester and the Southbank Centre in London, but was postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Some of the photographs of Reasonable Adjustment graffiti were taken by Edgar as an art student in the 1990s.  #Make Film Equal  In 2018, Edgar ran the successful crowdfunding campaign #MakeFilmEqual The campaign part funded a documentary entitled The Social Model to highlight the plight of underrepresented disabled film talent and the work of 104 films. Directed collaboratively by the 104 films collective, the film received a positive review from Disability Arts Online and has screened widely at film festivals. Following a premiere at the Belfast Film Festival it played at the Together and Fragments Film Festivals in London and the Picture This Film Festival in Calgary where it won the Thomas Poulsen Award.

The communications lines were to serve both military and civilian needs in the territory of Alaska. By 1904, ACS comprised some of undersea cable, over of land lines, and a wireless segment across at least . Answers.com US Military Dictionary \\"Washington-Alaska Military Cable and Telegraph System\\" WAMCATS On May 15, 1936 WAMCATS was renamed the U.S. Army Alaska Communications System. 59th Signal Battalion \\"Voice of the Arctic\\" The Alaska Communications System remained under the control of the Army Signal Corps until 1962 when it was taken over by the U.S. Air Force. The ACS handled the radioteletype, radio telephone, 500 kHz ship-to-shore frequencies, collected communications intelligence, and other services for more than half a century in Alaska. Records of the office of the Chief Signal Officer The Army Signal Corps (which develops, tests, provides, and manages communications and information systems support for the command and control of all the U.S. armed forces) connected military posts with each other and with the rest of the continental United States. This system of thousands of miles of suspended landlines and submarine cable included the first successful long-distance radio operation in the world. The telegraph was also the first major contribution to Alaskan infrastructure provided by the U.S. federal government, marking the beginning of the government's central role in the development of Alaska. At the start of the 20th century, when the United States was committing American troops to military engagements around the world, the Signal Corps in Alaska worked to make sure military communications could flow. An important message, such as General MacArthur's World War II demand for the surrender of the Japanese, was received, automatically recorded as printed text and parallel punched holes on paper tape, and could then be relayed on to other stations. \\"General MacArthur's Surrender Order To The Japanese\\", text by Janice Reynolds Cook, based on information provided by Charlie Burrow The ACS also provided a vital lifeline ‚Äì sometimes quite literally ‚Äì to the many remote and almost inaccessible communities across Alaska: it enabled the icebound city of Nome to alert the outside world about a diphtheria outbreak which led to the successful 1925 serum run to Nome. History At the beginning of the 20th century, Alaska was a cold and inhospitable place where travel, let alone news, took a month or more to happen. In 1870, Alaska had just recently been sold to America by the Russian Empire. In the U.S. that year, the U.S. Army Signal Corps began to establish isolated forts (meteorological stations) throughout the Western territories. These stations were usually not much more than cold, lonely huts manned by a single telegraph operator or soldier. US Army lineage of Signal Service in Alaska In 1900 the Congress appropriated nearly a half a million dollars for the purpose of establishing a land and underwater communications system connecting the various military posts in Alaska with the rest of the United States. The communications system was operated by signal soldiers assigned to the depot companies at the various forts around Alaska. WAMCATS soldiers reported directly to the Chief Signal Officer of the United States Army. Wired telephone poles eventually were put in place in Alaska, however, they were not reliable. One of the problems was that the heavy snow and ice typical in Alaska would cause the telephone poles to fall over, breaking the connections. During the winter there might be six feet of frozen snow that could topple poles. \\"The Alaska Communications System\\" by B. McCalley Laying cable underwater would solve part of that problem, and would also help the military with ship to shore communications. The first submarine telegraph cable laid by the United States Signal Corps was in the Philippines in 1899. Soon thereafter, underwater cable was first laid in Alaska in 1900, when the vessel CS Orizaba connected Unalakik to St. Michael and St. Michael to Safety Island, Cape Nome.\\"History of the Atlantic Cable & Undersea Communications: U.S. Armed Forces Cables\\" by Bill Glover Between 1900 and 1905, Army soldiers of the 59th Signal Battalion (also known as the \\"Voice of the Arctic\\") constructed a telegraph line linking the U.S. Army posts across Alaska with each other, including a wireless system crossing Norton Sound on the west coast of Alaska. In 1903 an underwater cable between Sitka, Alaska and Seattle, Washington was also laid, allowing rapid communication between Alaska and the lower continental U.S. By 1918, the 1st Signal Service Company was activated at Valdez, Alaska and 2nd Signal Service Company at Fort Gibbon to operate WAMCATS in Alaska. The 2nd Signal Service Company was not formally inactivated until 1927. The vessel CS Dellwood undertook the laying of a new submarine cable in 1924 between Seattle and Alaska with a post at Ketchikan. From 1931 the Army Signal Corps did not own a cable ship and so the system deteriorated until the beginning of World War II in 1941. The first submarine telephone cables were laid in 1956 with the Army cable ships Albert J. Myer and Basil O. Lenoir undertaking the work. The cable came ashore at around intervals. The ACS was transferred to the Air Force in July 1962. RCA purchased ACS for $31.5 million in 1970.

Golden takins have unique adaptations that help them stay warm and dry during the bitter cold of winter in the rugged Himalayan Mountains. Their large, moose- like snout has large sinus cavities that heats inhaled air, preventing the loss of body heat during respiration. A thick, secondary coat is grown to keep out the cold of the winters and provide protection from the elements. Another protection is their oily skin. Although golden takins do not have skin glands, their skin secretes an oily, bitter-tasting substance that acts as a natural raincoat in storms and fog. Its skin is also said to be the source of the legend of the Golden Fleece. Description The golden takin (pronounced tah- kin) is a large, muscular, hoofed mammal sometimes referred to as a goat- antelope, as it possesses similar traits to goats and antelope, and is most closely related to sheep, aoudad, or Barbary sheep of North Africa. Split hooves help takins move around easily in their rocky habitat. They also have an odor that smells like a strange combination of horse and musk. Both males and females have shiny black, crescent-shaped horns that grow from the center of their massive head and can reach up to 35 inches (90 centimeters) in length. Each spring, golden takins gather in large herds and migrate up the mountains to the tree line, an altitude above 14,000 feet (4,300 meters). As cooler weather approaches and food becomes scarce, they move down to forested valleys. Golden takins use the same routes during movement throughout the mountains despite where they are going. This creates a series of well-worn paths through the dense growths of bamboo and rhododendrons that lead to their natural salt licks and grazing areas. Because of their large, powerful bodies and impressive horns, golden takins have few natural enemies other than bears, wolves, leopards, and dholes. They are generally slow moving but can react quickly if angered or frightened. When needed, they can leap nimbly from rock to rock. If they sense danger, golden takins warn others with a loud \\"cough\\" that sends the herd running for cover in the dense underbrush, where they lie down to avoid being seen. Takins can also make an intimidating roar or bellow. Golden takins eat many kinds of alpine and deciduous plants and evergreens, and almost any vegetation within reach. This includes the tough leaves of evergreen rhododendrons and oaks, willow and pine bark, bamboo leaves, and a variety of new-growth leaves and herbs. They can easily stand on their hind legs, front legs propped against a tree, to reach for higher vegetation if they need to, and use their powerful bodies to push over small trees to bring leaves closer. Like cows and sheep, golden takins are ruminants and pass food into the first stomach, the rumen, when they first swallow it. Microbes in the rumen help digest very small particles of food. Larger particles pass into a second chamber that regurgitates these particles, called cud, back into the mouth to be chewed into pieces small enough to be digested properly. Golden takins typically eat in the early morning and again in the late afternoon. They spend the day under the cover of dense vegetation, venturing into the open only on cloudy or foggy days. Takin Asleep Takin eating Golden takins communicate using a variety of body postures. For example, a male shows dominance with an erect posture and a raised neck and chin. He might position his body sideways to another takin to emphasize his size. One signals aggression with a head-down posture, holding its neck horizontal and rigid, with the head and horns hooked to one side. A lowered head, an arched back, snorting, and head crashing often follow prolonged eye contact between individuals. The scent of another takin's skin or urine offers information, too. In particular, pheromones in a takin's urine may advertise sexual status and identity. To enhance this type of communication, a males spray their own forelegs, chest, and face with urine, and females soak their tail when urinating. Herds The size of herds changes with the seasons: during spring and early summer, herds can number up to 300 animals; during cooler months, when food is less plentiful, the large herds break up into smaller groups of 10 to 35 golden takins as they head up the mountain. Herds are made up of adult females (called cows), kids (young takin), subadults, and young males. Older males, called bulls, are generally solitary except during the rut, or mating season, in late summer. Normally solitary, bull takins meet up with herds for a short time during the rut. They bellow loudly to attract cows and notify other bulls of their presence. They may find takin cows by tracking their scent. Once they meet, a bull sniffs and licks the female to determine if she is receptive. Takin cows seek out areas of dense vegetation to give birth to a single kid in early spring (twins are rare). Within three days of its birth, a takin kid is able to follow its mother through most types of terrain. This is very important if bears or wolves are nearby or if the herd needs to travel a long distance for food. If young Taken are separated from their mother, it lets out a noise to alarm the mother, and the mother answers with a low, guttural call that allows for them to reunite. A takin kid eats solid food and stops nursing at around two months old, although it may continue to stay near its mother until after her next calf is born. Horns begin to grow when the takin kid is about six months old. At birth, takin kids are much darker than adults to give them camouflage from predators; they even have a dark stripe along the back that disappears as the youngsters gets older. Their coat gets lighter in color, longer, and shaggier as they get older. Anatomy Life span: 16 to 18 years in the wild, up to 20 years in zoos Gestation: 6 to 7 months Number of young at birth: 1 (twins are uncommon) Age of maturity: 2 years Size: Length - 5 to 7.3 feet (1.5 to 2.2 meters) Size: Shoulder height - 3.3 to 4.5 feet (1 to 1.4 meters) Weight: Females up to 616 pounds (280 kilograms); males up to 770 pounds (350 kilograms) Weight at birth: 11 to 15 pounds (5 to 7 kilograms)  References  * http://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/takin#sthash.PE3GvYAb.dpuf * Creamy- white golden takins in Qinling golden takin Mammals of China ","title":"Golden takin"},{"id":"18831698","text":"Howard Edward Brandt (January 2, 1939 in Emerado, North Dakota ‚Äì April 13, 2014) was a physicist with the United States Army Research Laboratory in Maryland, and was notable for his work in general relativity and quantum field theory and quantum information.

It was a subsidiary of Perfect World. In 2009, the company released Torchlight, a single-player action role-playing game. They released a sequel, Torchlight II, in 2012. It was at this time the developers revealed they were no longer pursuing plans to create an MMO in the Torchlight universe. History Runic Games was founded on August 11, 2008, by Travis Baldree, Max Schaefer, Erich Schaefer, and Peter Hu. Originally, the company was incorporated with the placeholder name \\"Surprise Truck\\", as suggested by Max Schaefer. The naming resulted in the company receiving a multitude of calls asking whether they were available to do truck delivery jobs. Runic Games was formed specifically for the purpose of keeping the team behind the game Mythos together to develop a new action RPG video game as a \\"spiritual successor\\" to their previous project. Following the dissolution of Flagship Studios in 2008, all 14 members of the Seattle team that developed Mythos signed onto Runic Games. Full production on the game started around November 2008, meaning that the game's total development period was approximately 11 months. At the 2009 Game Developers Conference some members of the Runic Games team were present with an early version of their single- player game, at which point it was revealed that the title would be Torchlight. One notable addition to the staff was Matt Uelmen, composer for Blizzard Entertainment's Diablo series. As of mid-2009, the company employed no fewer than 26 people. Gamasutra named Runic Games one of its \\"Top 5 Developers\\" of 2009 for the studio's ability to create the \\"highly-polished\\" Torchlight in only 11 months. The company was also praised for its responsiveness to its player community, citing one particular incident: Following the 2009 release of Torchlight, the studio shifted to the production of a sequel Torchlight II. In 2010, Perfect World Entertainment, Inc. bought an $8.4 million majority stake in Runic Games.http://www.massively.com/2010/05/18/perfect-world-entertainment-invests- in-torchlight-mmo/ In March 2014, co-founder Erich Schaefer and Travis Baldree decided to leave Runic and form a new indie studio, Double Damage Games.\\"Announcement: Next Things,\\" Runic Games official forums Max Schaefer left the studio in early 2016; he then founded Echtra Games, which included a number of former Blizzard and Runic developers. In August 2018, Echtra announced Torchlight Frontiers, a shared world game build on the Torchlight IP. On November 3, 2017, Perfect World announced the closure of Runic Games, along with large layoffs at Motiga. Perfect World said the closure was to reflect their company's focus on games as a service. One set of developers from Runic, including Marsh Lefler, Patrick Blank, Allen Fong, and John Dunbar, along with former Gearbox Software members, established Monster Squad Games and are currently developing a player-versus-environment cooperative game. Games Torchlight (2009) Runic Games' first product is Torchlight, a single-player action role-playing game published by Perfect World Entertainment, Inc. and Encore, Inc, and released for Windows on October 27, 2009. The fantasy-themed game is set in the fictional town of Torchlight and the expansive caverns and dungeons nearby, which adventurers explore to collect valuable loot and battle hordes of monsters. Following the initial digital distribution release, Encore, Inc published a Windows retail box version in January 2010, a port for Mac OS X was developed by World Domination Industries and released through SteamSteam For Mac Launch Details Revealed, SteamPowered.com in May 2010, and it was released for the Xbox 360 via XBLA on March 9, 2011. The game was met with a generally positive critical reception, holding a Metacritic score of 83 based on 57 reviews. Torchlight II (2012) Runic Games announced Torchlight II, a sequel that features multiplayer co-op. The company decided to develop the sequel to \\"give [the players] what they're asking for\\" in terms of a multiplayer experience, while serving as an intermediate step toward their planned MMORPG. Torchlight II was released on September 20, 2012.\\"Torchlight 2 Release Date,\\" Torchlight II official site Though not listed anywhere in their marketing materials,http://www.torchlight2game.com/about Torchlight II requires a Runic Games account to play in Internet Multiplayer games.

Life Henry of Brunswick- L√ºneburg, the son of Otto V of L√ºneburg and Anna of Nassau, was born in 1468. In 1486, Henry took control of L√ºneburg from his mother, who had been regent since the death of Henry‚Äôs grandfather, Frederick II, Duke of Brunswick- L√ºneburg. Henry‚Äôs reign was marked by the complications relating to the Hildesheim Prince-Bishopric Feud. Henry was on the side of the bishop, and was against the nobility of Hildesheim and the Welfs of Brunswick. In 1519, Henry was victorious in the Battle of Soltau, though the intervention of the newly elected Emperor Charles V transformed the victory achieved on the battlefield into a defeat. Henry was on the side of the French during the election, and so earned the enmity of Charles V. Henry‚Äôs two eldest sons became regents of the country, and Henry went into exile at the French king‚Äôs court. Henry returned in 1527 during the beginning of the Reformation in L√ºneburg, and tried to regain control of the land with help from those opposed to the Reformation. His attempt failed, and Henry returned to France, only to return in 1530. He spent his last days in the princely house in L√ºneburg, which had been given to him by his eldest son. After the death of his first wife, Margaret of Saxony, Henry married, unequally, Anna von Campe. He was buried in the abbey of Wienhausen where his gravestone can still be seen today.

It is a member of the University of Lille.  Background history  Academic researches in chemistry in Lille started in the early days of the 19th century, with Charles Fr√©d√©ric Kuhlmann's innovations on sulfuric acid production and researches on using platinum catalysis for industrial production of nitric acid from ammonia (from 1823 to 1833). The faculty of sciences of Lille was however formally established in 1854 only, with a chemist as its first dean (Louis Pasteur). Hence, academic and applied researches in chemistry, catalysis, and later molecular physics, were boosted from the 19th century onwards and further developed in the 20th and 21st centuries, both in fundamental research and applied research thanks to industry applications.

Budorcas from Greek bous (\\"ox\\" or \\"cow\\") and dorkas (\\"gazelle\\"); taxicolor from Latin taxus (\\"badger\\") and color (\\"hue\\") referring to badger-like coloration Listed as a vulnerable species, the Sichuan takin is native to Tibet and the provinces of Sichuan, Gansu and Xinjiang in the People's Republic of China.  Taxonomy  It can be differentiated from its close cousin, the golden takin, largely by its coat color among other morphological differences, in addition to a different range of habitat. The takin was previously considered closely related to the Arctic muskox. Physical similarities have now been found to be due to convergent evolution and not through a common ancestor. DNA sequencing recently revealed various sheep are close relatives (goats, tahrs, sheep, bharal, Barbary sheep).Groves, P. and G. Shields1997. Cytochrome B sequences suggest convergent evolution of the Asian Takin and Arctic Muskox. Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 8(3):363-374  Habitat  Takin inhabit the same dense bamboo forests as the better known giant panda. Sichuan takins live in these dense thickets and bamboo groves, in family groups of up to 30 individuals. Despite being large, stocky and relatively slow moving, the Sichuan takin is quite agile in maneuvering its rocky habitat with often steep and challenging slopes. The inaccessibility of the takin's mountainous habitat has meant that there is little information on this species‚Äô behavior and ecology; specifically on their distribution and population size. Adult Sichuan takin at the Cincinnati Zoo  Species threats  Although considered a national treasure of China with the highest legal protection, the Sichuan takin is threatened by ongoing poaching and habitat destruction. The highest need for this species is further scientific knowledge to allow production of a valid long-term conservation and management plan. The principal threats to its survival include poaching by hunters for food and fur. This has led to their decline in the wild. A reliable count of the species has not been fully undertaken, but it may have indirectly benefited from the protections accorded to the giant panda and other species.  Behavior and ecology  Takins have adaptations that help them stay warm and dry during the bitter cold of winter in the Himalayan Mountains. A thick, secondary coat is grown to keep out the chill. The large, moose-like snout has large sinus cavities to warm up the air a takin inhales before it gets to the lungs. Without this adaptation, takins would lose a large amount of body heat just by breathing. Yet another protection is their oily skin. Although they have no skin glands, their skin secretes an oily, bitter-tasting substance that acts as a natural raincoat in storms and fog. Streaks of this oily stuff can be seen where takins rub. They also have an odor that smells like a combination of horse and musk. Takins eat in the early morning and again in the late afternoon, and they rest when they are not feeding. Since they live at altitudes above 14,000 feet (4,300 meters), they feed on many kinds of alpine and deciduous plants and evergreens. When it comes to food, takins eat almost any vegetation within reach. This includes the tough leaves of evergreen rhododendrons and oaks, willow and pine bark, bamboo leaves, and a variety of new-growth leaves and herbs. They can easily stand on their hind legs, front legs propped against a tree, to reach for higher vegetation if they need to.  Herding and migration  Each spring, takins gather in large herds and migrate up the mountains to the tree line. As cooler weather approaches and food becomes scarce, the takins move down to forested valleys. As they move up, down, or across the mountains, takins use the same routes over and over. This creates a series of well-worn paths through the dense growths of bamboo and rhododendrons that lead to their natural salt licks and grazing areas. The size of a takin herd changes with the seasons: during spring and early summer, herds can number up to 300 animals; during cooler months, when food is less plentiful, the large herds break up into smaller groups of 10 to 35 takins as they head down the mountain. Herds are made up of adult females (called cows), kids (which is what takin young are called), subadults, and young males. Older males, called bulls, are generally solitary except during the \\"rut,\\" or mating season, in late summer.  Reproduction  The cows give birth to a single kid in early spring. Within three days of its birth, a takin kid is able to follow its mother through most types of terrain. This is very important if predators are nearby or if the herd needs to travel a long distance for food.  Natural enemies  Because of their large, powerful bodies and impressive horns, takins have few natural enemies other than bears or wolves. They are generally slow moving but can react quickly if angered or frightened. When needed, a takin can leap nimbly from rock to rock. If a takin senses danger, it warns the others with a loud \\"cough\\" that sends the herd running for cover. Takins can also make an intimidating roar or bellow.

The main threats to the Bhutan Takin are hunting and habitat loss. Range, behaviour, and habitat In Bhutan, Takin are found in bamboo forests at altitudes of , where they eat grass, buds and leaves. Takins are diurnal, active in the day, resting in the heat on particularly sunny days. Takin gather in small herds in winter and herds of up to a hundred individuals in the summer; in winter, they move to lower elevations and split into smaller herds of 10-50 individuals, mostly in the Gasa District. As is often seen in bison, old males are often solitary. A study of the Bhutan Takin's seasonal movement and habitat use has been conducted by Jigme Dorji National Park staff which is thought to be the stronghold of the species in Bhutan. An earlier study of its diet on its summer range showed that the takin is a generalist browser foraging on numerous shrubs and forbs. In China, the species is known to inhabit from south of the Yarlung Tsangpo River on the southern-facing side of the eastern Himalayas, to the westerly bend of the river.

Ambler served as the third Commandant of the Royal Observer Corps, the first serving RAF officer to hold the appointment as his predecessors were retired air commodores. Early days Ambler was born on 23 June 1904 and educated at Shrewsbury and Clare College, University of Cambridge. He rowed in the University Boat Race for Cambridge in 1924, 1925 and 1926. He was President of the Cambridge University Boat Club from 1925 to 1926. He then worked in the family firm of Fred Ambler Limited in Bradford, Yorkshire and during his time with the company he invented a method which increased the speed at which worsted yarn might be produced. In 1931 Ambler joined the Auxiliary Air Force and served as a pilot in No. 608 Squadron (North Riding) Squadron in his spare time and in the ranks of pilot officer (7 February 1931), flying officer (7 August 1932) and flight lieutenant (25 November 1933). On 30 December 1934 he was promoted further to squadron leader and appointed Officer Commanding of No. 608 (North Riding) Squadron. In 1938, still a squadron leader, Ambler transferred to No. 609 (West Riding) Squadron as officer commanding. This auxiliary appointment was short-lived and, following the outbreak of the Second World War, Ambler was promoted to acting wing commander and took up duties as the Operations Controller at RAF Wick in December 1939. His confirmation in the rank came on 1 January 1940 and he was promoted to group captain a year later in December 1941. Royal Observer Corps In June 1942, Ambler was promoted to acting air commodore and appointed as the third Commandant of the Royal Observer Corps, replacing Air Commodore Alfred Warrington-Morris. During his time in command he oversaw the reorganization of the corps' headquarters and the subordinate area headquarters. Ambler also aligned each ROC area's territory to that of its associated Fighter Command group for more cohesive interception of enemy aircraft. Ambler handed over command to Air Commodore Finlay Crerar in June 1943. Return to RAF duties With his rank as an air commodore confirmed Ambler moved across the road at RAF Bentley Priory to an appointment as the Deputy Senior Air Staff Officer (DSASO) of RAF Fighter Command and then the Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) on 1 February 1945 in the rank of acting air vice marshal. Between August 1943 and October 1944 Ambler was an Aide de Camp to King George VI. Retirement from the RAF Ambler retired from the RAF following the end of the Second World War and returned to work at Fred Ambler Limited. He eventually became chairman of the company. In October 1947 Ambler was appointed as an Honorary Air Commodore of No. 609 (West Riding) Squadron, an appointment he held until March 1957. He was awarded a similar honour with No. 2609 (West Riding) Field Squadron RAuxAF Regiment between November 1949 and March 1957. In November 1949 he was appointed Honorary Air Commodore with No. 3609 (West Riding) Fighter Control Unit, a position he held until January 1961.

More generally known as \\"Town Square\\", the park is notable for its elk-antler arches at each corner of the park, collected from the nearby National Elk Refuge by Boy Scouts and periodically rebuilt. The square originally existed as an open space in the center of town that was made into a park in 1934. The park center also contains a stone memorial to John Colter. The Town Square originated as an open space in the middle of Jackson where no buildings had yet been built, surrounded by more developed blocks in the sparsely settled street grid of the town. The area was used as a commons area by people and occasionally as a thoroughfare for migrating elk. In 1917 the town graded the surrounding street and obtained title to most of the land, using excess material from the grading to even out depressions in the square's surface. In 1924 the town undertook further improvements to the area, now called \\"the little park in the center of the town.\\" The initiative yielded further grading. A few trees were planted, and were then indifferently maintained. With the two hundredth anniversary of the birth of George Washington approaching in 1932, the state of Wyoming cooperated with Congress to prepare memorials throughout the state. The Wyoming plan was to establish a George Washington Memorial Park in as many communities as possible. The Town Square was designated the George Washington Memorial Park for Jackson in 1932. The organizing committee, which included Olaus Murie, raised the requisite $150 in public donations to landscape the park. Plantings were not ready until 1933. However, labor shortages remained a problem, and little work was accomplished. Jackson applied for and received $3092 from the New Deal Civil Works Administration, which allowed the town to organize a land transfer allowing the sole building on the square property, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows Hall, to move to another site. Altogether, more than $6000 in CWA funds were expended, just before the CWA was closed down in 1934. In short order the Square became the center of Jackson's civic life. A memorial to John Colter was placed in the center of the park in 1939. In 1953 the local Rotary Club built an arch of elk antlers at the southwest corner of the park. Arches were erected at the remaining corners in 1966, 1967 and 1969. In 1959 a house originally built by Charles Wort was moved onto the square, becoming known as the \\"Stage Stop.\\" The move was unpopular and possibly illegal, but the building remained until 1995 when it was given to Wyoming Senator Alan Simpson, whose grandfather had used the building as a law office. A modern replacement was built in its stead. It was not until 1976 that a plaque was placed in the park for the United States Bicentennial naming the park \\"George Washington Memorial Park.\\" Stone facings were added to the antler arches the same year.

Males have a dark brown summer coat, while the females have a more reddish-gold, and both sexes shift to a gray-colored coat in the winter. Both sexes also have a \\"goatee\\", a tuft of hair extending from the chin. The ibexes have a black stripe from the spine that extends over the shoulder, limbs, and neck. This stripe darkens when the ibexes are in the mating season.  Hunting  The bezoar ibex is a popular trophy hunt target. Numerous organizations have hunts targeted specifically for this ibex species. Hunting season is typically from the beginning of August to the end of March. The bezoar ibex, due to its high-altitude habitats and a tendency to thrive in rocky, inaccessible areas, is hunted with a spot- and-stalk method, usually over a period of several days. The bezoar ibex lives in steep hills, typically covered with forests and short bushes, starting from sea level at the Aegean Sea and extending up to an altitude of 3000 meters or about 9850 ft in eastern Turkey.  Hybrid bezoar ibex  The hybrid ibex is a cross between a wild bezoar ibex and a domestic goat. It has recently been recognized as a subspecies by both Grand Slam Club/Ovis and Safari Club International, but counts only in hunts through Capra Super 20. The hybrid can be found in several localities in one district of Turkey and crosses over habitats with the bezoar in some of these areas, though they sometimes live in completely isolated populations. Hybrids tend to be very similar to a standard bezoar, but have much longer, floppier ears, as well as a longer coat. The most prominent difference may be the horns, which flare out significantly in comparison to those of a true ibex.

Design and development Designed as a twin-engine bomber and photo- reconnaissance aircraft, the Avro 533 was a development of the earlier 523 and 529A. Originally designated the Avro 529B, the new 320 hp (240 kW) ABC Dragonfly I nine-cylinder engine was specified, but with a redesign in July 1918, the type number was subsequently changed to Avro 533. When the original engines were not available, the 300 hp (220 kW) Siddeley Puma engine was substituted on the second prototype in November 1918, this acquiring a new designation, the Avro 533A Manchester Mk II, and first flying in December that year. An American 400 hp (300 kW) Liberty engine was also proposed as an alternate engine.Harlan and Jenks 1973, p. 61. Operational history The Avro 533A Manchester Mk II flew for the first time in December 1918 with flight testing continuing with No. 186 Development Squadron. By March 1919, Avro sent the first prototype to Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at Martlesham Heath for official trials before its eventual return to the Avro factory at Hamble. The aircraft was a large, and mainly conventional design of wood-and-fabric construction typical of the time. Open cockpits were retained, although later modifications were planned for passenger compartments in the interior.Jackson 1965, p. 162. In December 1919, the second prototype received its Dragonfly I engines, becoming the Avro 533A Manchester Mk I. Other than the different engines, there were few differences between the two types, other than the Mk I having a slightly reduced lower wing surface, and enlarged tailfin and rudder to correct control problems indicated in testing. Flight testing also indicated a lower performance than anticipated which resulted in Avro reconsidering the type's further trials, and eventually led to the abandoning of the third prototype, which was never fitted with engines. In March 1919, Avro proposed a passenger airliner, the Avro 537, that would be adapted from the earlier bomber version. The plans were ultimately abandoned and all the Type 533 prototypes were scrapped.Harlan and Jenks 1973, p. 62.

Description Sindh ibex are rather stocky animals with thick-set bodies and strong limbs terminating in broad hooves. Female and young males, till their second winter, are yellowish-brown varying to reddish-grey with a darker brown mid-dorsal line extending from between the shoulders to the base of the tail. Mature males are spectacularly beautiful, with long sweeping scimitar shaped horns over 102 cm (40 in) in length and almost silver white bodies offset by a sooty grey chest, throat and face. The extent of white hairs in the hind neck and body region of males increases with age. The hair in summer coat is short and coarse and even in adult males is more reddish-buff in colour. Males have short beards, but females lack any beard. The belly and outside of the lower limbs, beard and forepart of the face vary from black to deep chestnut-brown in mature males. There is also a conspicuous black stripe in adult males, running from the withers down the front of the shoulders and merging with the black chest. Older males have a dark face pattern. The horns are strongly keeled in front, sweeping upwards and outwards with the tips generally diverging. The population estimate of Sindh ibex in Kirthar national park is around 13,000.Sindh Wildlife Department ‚Äì Khirthar national park . Sindhwildlife.com.pk. Retrieved on 2012-12-30. Natural history This wild goat is gregarious, and if undisturbed will congregate in fairly large herds. The older male associate with such herds but generally keep together, often on the periphery of the main band. When disturbed, they are much more wary and ascend into inaccessible crags very early in the morning, emerging again just before dusk. During the hottest part of the year, they lie up more extensively during the day and may graze a considerable part of the night. Wild goats have a wonderful sense of balance and can make a standing leap 1.75 m (5‚Äì6 ft) upwards on a seemingly vertical rock surface. They appear almost slow and deliberate when traversing rock faces but can slide without injury down almost perpendicular rock faces with drops as much as 4‚Äì6 m. When challenging another male these wild goats frequently stand up on their hind legs and at the same time bend their head to one side before charging forward and clashing their horns.

Legal procedure for warrant sales was governed by the Debtors (Scotland) Act 1987. The practice was controversial, those who opposed it were concerned that it affected the poorest section of society who genuinely were unable to pay a debt, others claimed the legislation was needed to ensure people paid their debts. It became a contentious political issue in the late 1980s, when Scottish councils used the legislation against an ever-increasing number of Community Charge defaulters. This involved councils applying for a warrant from the local court to collect the money owed by non-payers. Sheriff officers (private companies, even though their title suggests they are court employees) were the choice of the local authorities to collect the outstanding debts. Under the 1987 act, the debt collectors were permitted to enter a debtor's home and poind (put a value on) items, which would be subject to a later, public sale under warrant (warrant sale). The practice was abolished when Tommy Sheridan, MSP, of the Scottish Socialist Party, introduced a private member's bill in 2001, and the Scottish Parliament voted to remove the legislation from Scots law under the Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Act 2001.

The manuscript is mostly in Latin, but with elements in Old English and the earliest written examples of the Cornish language, which is thus of particular interest to language scholars and early Cornish historians. The manuscript was discovered by Thomas Rodd (b. 1796, d. 1849), a London bookseller and it was sold to the British Museum by Rodd in May 1833. It is thought to have been made in Brittany - now part of France - and dates from the last quarter of the 9th century to 1st quarter of the 11th century. Cornish Glosses Recorded in the Old Cornish language, in the margins of a Gospel book, are the names and details of slaves freed in Bodmin (the then principal town of Cornwall, an important religious centre) during the 9th or 10th centuries. There is also an Old Cornish Vocabulary, an English ‚Äì Latin vocabulary from around AD 1000 to which was added about a century later a Cornish translation. Some 961 Cornish words are recorded, ranging from celestial bodies, through church and craft occupations, to plants and animals.Price, Glanville (2000) Languages in Britain and Ireland This, it is believed, is the only original record relating to Cornwall, or its Bishopric, which predates the Norman Conquest. The volume is in quarto, of rather an oblong form, and is very neatly written, though evidently by a scribe not well informed, or of great learning, even for those times. The entries seem to be contemporaneous with the manumissions which they record.

Females are reddish-gray with a dark brown dorsal stripe and white legs with a dark brown marking below the knees. Horns are similar to Bezoar ibex, they flat in cross and sharply curved at front and form a long, open spiral that is normally a complete turn or a little more, their horns reaches the length of 29 inches (73.7 cm), however, the longest of record measured 40 inches (101.6 cm) (Rowland Ward, 1969). Behavior Chiltan ibexes are social and diurnal. There rut starts in mid-October and is over by third week of November. Youngs are born from late-March to early- April, with twins occurring frequently. Distributions & Status There four to five populations in early 1970s in Chiltan, Mordar, Koh-i-Maran and Koh-i- Gishk (ranges at south of Quetta). By 1975, the uncontrolled hunting by locals reduced population to 170 in Sulaiman Mountains area, (now Hazarganji-Chiltan National Park). By 1990, the population was increased by 480.

Stadsarchief Delft, inv.nr. 68862. Clara Jansdochter van Sparwoude (sometimes written Spaerwoude) (ca. 1530 ‚Äì 4 August 1615) was a Dutch noblewoman of Delft who is chiefly remembered for her great wealth and various charitable funds from her estate. The most famous of these granted a sum of money to each of her relatives and their descendants upon their marriage, and was in continuous operation until 1922, when the monies were liquidated by the Dutch government. Coat of arms of Clara van Sparwoude as they appear in a portrait from 1565  Life and legacy  Clara was the daughter of Jan Heyndrixzn. (1477‚Äì1552) a goldsmith of Delft, and his second wife Willemtgen Willemsdr (1495‚Äì1564). In 1556 she married Arent Vranckenzn. van der Meer (died 1596), a high-ranking city official and burgemeester in Delft. Following her death on 4 August 1615, she was interred on 8 August in the Oude Kerk in Delft, where her prominent tomb is visible still.  Clara van Sparwoude Fund  As Clara and her husband had no children together, upon her death she donated her considerable riches to various charitable projects, including a fund for \\"poor relations\\", typically interpreted as meaning all descendants of her elder half-brother Adriaan and younger half-sister Maritgen. A payment was made to each relation upon their wedding. Originally a considerable sum of money, the amount paid dwindled over the centuries as a result of inflation and the increasing number of relations. In the early 20th century the Dutch government retained an official whose responsibilities included maintaining the pedigree of Clara van Sparwoude's family and disbursing the funds to qualifying relatives. By the 1920s the fund still held half a million guilders, but the payment per relation had dwindled to the equivalent of ‚Ç¨11.35. In 1922 the Dutch government passed a law liquidating the balance of the fund and dispensing it among the poorest 10% of adult van Sparwoude relations.  Clara van Sparwoudestraat  Originally, a Clara van Sparwoudestraat had already been established on 26 October 1938 in the Delft expansion plan of 1931, but that plan was canceled. In 1970 a street in Delft was named after her by decision of the council.Krogt, P. van der (2000) Straatnamen van Delft, Delft, Gemeentearchief Delft, p. 58.

It stars Ugla Egilsd√≥ttir as Agga, an orphaned preteen distrusting of her cousin Freyja, played by Margr√©t Vilhj√°lmsd√≥ttir, who turns heads on her return from America, no longer the chubby teen that the Icelandic townspeople remember. Set around 1950, the story portrays a pivotal moment in Iceland‚Äôs recent history: newly independent, with the legacy of the Second World War still prominent, Iceland is modernising and internationalising. The film is set in Hafnarfj√∂r√∞ur, now effectively a suburb of Reykjav√≠k, then a fishing town outside it. It is a close adaptation of the novel M√°vahl√°tur by Krist√≠n Marja Baldursd√≥ttir, published in 1995 by M√°l og menning. It was Iceland's submission to the 74th Academy Awards for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but was not accepted as a nominee. Plot The story is set around the 1950s, not very long after Iceland's independence from Denmark. The arrival of modernity in Iceland, including democracy, feminism, and new technologies and fashions, is an implicit theme throughout the text. The narrative is presented from the perspective of Agga (played by Ugla Egilsd√≥ttir), who during the three or so years covered by the story goes from being a pre-teen girl to being a young woman. The main agent in the story, however, is Agga's older step-cousin Freyja (played by Margr√©t Vilhj√°lmsd√≥ttir). Freyja returns to Iceland from America after her American army officer husband died of heart attack two months before. Freyja, who is dressed in American clothing, brought back 7 luggages of clothes with her from America, and amazes her Icelandic family - Agga's grandmother and her aunts Ninna and D√≥d√≥ - with her clothes, perfumes, and her having a fridge in America. Agga becomes suspicious, suspecting that Freyja is an evil woman or indeed a witch, and should be sent back to America. However, no one believes her. Regardless of her suspicion, Agga told D√≠sa (played by B√°ra Lyngdal Magn√∫sd√≥ttir) about Freyja's return. D√≠sa was excited about the news, so she ran to where Freyja is staying to meet her. The family of girls then tried on Freyja's clothes from America, and held a mini fashion show inside their house. Agga then decided to report her suspicion to the local policeman Magn√∫s (played by Hilmir Sn√¶r Gu√∞nason), telling him that Freyja is heartless and evil, and that she is a liar. Magn√∫s did not take Agga seriously, laughed her accusations off, and sent her out of the police station. With no one on her side, Agga began to follow Freyja, hoping to find out more about her. Freyja was found frequently visiting the rocks near the sea, disappearing behind the rocks and only reappearing many hours later. As Agga found the rocks intimidating, she dared not follow Freyja behind the rocks, and therefore no one knows what Freyja does behind the rocks. Agga realizes that Magn√∫s doesn't take her seriously because she is dressed as a child, after some difficulties with the other women in the house she obtains a trench coat; dressed like an adult she returns to the station where Magn√∫s finally hears her out.

They are Schur functions when t is 0 and monomial symmetric functions when t is 1 and are special cases of Macdonald polynomials. They were first defined indirectly by Philip Hall using the Hall algebra, and later defined directly by Dudley E. Littlewood (1961). Definition The Hall‚ÄìLittlewood polynomial P is defined by :P_\\\\lambda(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n;t) = \\\\left( \\\\prod_{i\\\\geq 0} \\\\prod_{j=1}^{m(i)} \\\\frac{1-t}{1-t^{j}} \\\\right) {\\\\sum_{w\\\\in S_n}w\\\\left(x_1^{\\\\lambda_1}\\\\cdots x_n^{\\\\lambda_n}\\\\prod_{i where Œª is a partition of at most n with elements Œªi, and m(i) elements equal to i, and Sn is the symmetric group of order n!. As an example, : P_{42}(x_1,x_2;t) = x_1^4 x_2^2 + x_1^2 x_2^4 + (1-t) x_1^3 x_2^3 Specializations We have that P_\\\\lambda(x;1) = m_\\\\lambda(x), P_\\\\lambda(x;0) = s_\\\\lambda(x) and P_\\\\lambda(x;-1) = P_\\\\lambda(x) where the latter is the Schur P polynomials.

Hu√°scar himself split his army along the border in three divisions, one main division commanded by Uampa Yupanqui with troops from Kuntisuyu and from the south, planning to cross the Cotabambas river. Another army was led by Guanca Auqui, Agua Panti, Paca Yupanqui and a third led by Hu√°scar himself (taking command personally for the first time) and his brothers Tito Atauchi and Topa Atao.

Only the first movement provides room for a cadenza; the G√°bor Darvas edition published by Editio Musica gives an 8-measure cadenza which requires no ledger lines but consistently involves small note values. In fact, in regards to range, the concerto is \\"cautious.\\"E. H. Tarr, preface to Michael Haydn's Trumpet Concerto in C major, which by contrast is \\"dangerous\\" in its use of high notes. Discography Nikolaus Harnoncourt with Vienna Concentus Musicus chooses this Trumpet Concerto to cap off a disc of music by the composer's son, which includes the Bassoon Concerto K. 191. It can also be found on several CDs with trumpet concertos by other composers, such as: * George Vosburgh's recording with the Seattle Symphony and Gerard Schwarz, which includes Joseph Haydn's Trumpet Concerto in E-flat major, Johann Nepomuk Hummel's Trumpet Concerto in E major and Georg Philipp Telemann's Trumpet Concerto in D major. * The Naxos Records album The Art of the Baroque Trumpet, Volume 1, with Niklas Eklund, groups Mozart's Concerto with Baroque trumpet concertos such as the aforementioned Telemann, and adds Molter, Purcell, Fasch and Handel. Eklund wrote his own cadenza for the first movement. * Miroslav Kejmar also includes it in his Famous Trumpet Concerti album, which besides Joseph Haydn's is all Baroque. * On Telarc, Rolf Smedvig with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra conducted by Jahja Ling plays Mozart's Concerto as well as Telemann's and Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 2. * Wynton Marsalis plays this concerto along with the famous concerti by Haydn and Hummel.

It is often mentioned together with its neighbouring sister kingdom, as Wewiku-Wehali (Waiwiku-Wehale). Wehali held a position of ritual seniority among the many small Timorese kingdoms.  Geography and society  Wehali is centred at the village of Laran, situated on a fertile plain which is well suited for varied agriculture. It belongs to the South Tetun-speaking area, which is also known as Belu. The southern Tetun have a matrilineal system. At the apex of the political system stood a \\"great lord\\" (Nai Bot) who held the title of Maromak Oan (\\"son of God\\"). His task was ritually passive, in a symbolic sense \\"female\\", and he kept an executive \\"male\\" regent or assistant by his side, the Liurai (\\"surpassing the land\\").  History  According to oral tradition Wehali was the first land that appeared from the waters which once covered the earth, which made it the centre or origin of the world from a Timorese perspective. Other traditions mention a migration from Sina Mutin Malaka (Chinese White Malacca) in ancient times.H.J. Grijzen (1904), 'Mededeelingen omtrent Beloe of Midden-Timor', Verhandelingen van het Bataviaasch Genootschap 54, pp. 18-25. The historical background of this is not clear, but the account of Antonio Pigafetta of the Magellan expedition, who visited Timor in 1522, confirms the importance of the Wewiku-Wehali kingdom. In the 17th century the ruler of Wehali was described as \\"an emperor, whom all the kings on the island adhere to with tribute, as being their sovereign\\".L. de Santa Catharina (1866), Hist√≥ria de S. Domingos, Quatra parte. Lisboa: Panorama, p. 300. He entertained friendly contacts with the Muslim kingdom of Makassar, but his power was checked by devastating invasions by the Portuguese in 1642 and 1665.James J. Fox (1982), 'The great lord rests at the centre: The paradox of powerlessness in European-Timorese relations, Canberra Anthropology 5:2, p. 22. Wehali was now brought inside the Portuguese sphere of power but appears to have had limited contact with its colonial suzerain.  Dutch East India Company  The Portuguese grip over western Timor receded greatly after the 1749 Battle of Penfui, and the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oost- Indische Compagnie or VOC), which had hitherto been confined to Kupang, expanded its sphere of power over large parts of the island. During the 1750s Wehali approached the VOC, and in 1756 the Liurai Jacinto Correia signed a contract with the Dutch diplomat Johannes Andreas Paravicini. According to this contract the Liurai was the overlord over a large number of Timorese kingdoms, including Dirma, Laclo, Luca, Viqueque, Corara and Banibani.F.W. Stapel (1955), Corpus Diplomaticum Neerlando-Indicum, Vol. VI. Den Haag: M. Nijhoff, pp. 88-89. The Dutch hoped that the contract would automatically include most of East Timor in their sphere of power, but the ritual rather than executive authority of Wehali was insufficient for this. In effect, Wehali vacillated between the Dutch and Portuguese sides for the next century.  Partition and later colonial rule  A colonial borderline on Timor was finally agreed on in 1859, which left Wehali on the Dutch side. A Dutch official was posted in Atapupu on the north coast of Belu in 1862, but the south coast was not surveyed by the colonial authorities before 1898. Brief military clashes took place in 1900 and 1906. The Dutch proceeded to restructure the administrative divisions of Belu in 1915-16, trying to use traditional rulers as zelfbestuurders (rajas under colonial surveillance). The Maromak Oan, Baria Nahak, died in 1925, and the Dutch unsuccessfully tried to use his nephew Seran Nahak as Raja of Belu in 1925-30. After the achievement of independence for Indonesia in 1949, the traditional forms of governance were phased out, but the traditional elite groups still retain an amount of local importance.G√©rard Francillon (1980), 'Incursions upon Wehali: A modern history of an ancient empire', in James J. Fox [ed.], The Flow of Life: Essays on Eastern Indonesia. Cambridge Mass. & London: Harvard University Press.  References   Further reading  * H.G.

It was Poland's submission to the 74th Academy Awards for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but was not nominated. Plot The central plot in the movie revolves around the love of a Roman patrician, Marcus Vinicius, towards a Christian girl (coming from the territory of modern-day Poland) set against the backdrop of the persecutions against Christians during the reign of Nero. In the beginning, Lygia, a Christian and hostage of Rome, becomes the object of Vinicius' love but she refuses his advances. Vinicius' friend Petronius tries to manipulate Nero, who has authority over all Roman hostages, to give Lygia to Vinicius, but Lygia is taken into hiding by Christians. Marcus Vinicius decides to find her and force her to be his wife. He goes to a Christian meeting along with Croton, a gladiator, to find her. After following her from the meeting, Marcus tries to take her, but Ursus, a strong man and friend of Lygia, kills Croton. Marcus himself is wounded in the fight, but is taken care of by Lygia and the Christians. Seeing their kindness he begins to convert to Christianity, and Lygia accepts him. Rome catches fire while the emperor, Nero, is away. Nero returns and sings to the crowd, but they become angry. At the suggestion of Nero's wife, the Christians are blamed for the fire, providing a long series of cruel spectacles to appease the crowd. In one of the spectacles, Ursus faces a bull carrying Lygia on its back. Ursus wins and, with the crowd and guards in approval, Nero lets them live. Nero kills himself, and Vinicius and Lygia leave Rome.

By 1789, the city was recognized by President George Washington as having been one of five original ports of entry for the American colonies. In 1797, Brunswick's prominence was further recognized when it became the county seat of Glynn County, a status it retains to this day. During the later stages of the Civil War, with the approach of the Union Army, much of the city was abandoned and burned. Economic prosperity eventually returned, when a large lumber mill was constructed in the area. By the late 19th-century, despite yellow fever epidemics and occasional hurricanes, business in Brunswick was thriving, due to port business for cotton, lumber, naval stores, and oysters. During this period, Brunswick also enjoyed a tourist trade, stimulated by nearby Jekyll Island, which had become a posh, exclusive getaway for some of the era's most influential people. World War I stimulated ship building activity in Brunswick. But it was not until World War II that the economy boomed, when 16,000 workers were employed to produce ninety-nine Liberty ships and \\"Knot\\" ships. During the war, Brunswick's Glynco Naval Air Station was, for a time, the largest blimp base in the world. Since the end of World War II, the city has enjoyed a period of moderate economic activity, centered on its deep natural port, which is the western-most harbor on the eastern seaboard. In recent years, in recognition of a thriving local enterprise, Brunswick has declared itself to be the \\"Shrimp Capital of the World\\". Early colonization As early as 1738, the area's first English settler, Mark Carr, a captain in General James Oglethorpe's Marine Boat Company, established his plantation along the Turtle River (at an area known as Plug Point). In 1771, the Royal Province of Georgia purchased Carr's fields and laid out the town of Brunswick in the grid style following Oglethorpe's Savannah Plan. Brunswick obtained its name from the duchy of Brunswick-L√ºneburg in Germany, the ancestral home of King George II of Great Britain. In 1789, George Washington proclaimed Brunswick one of the five original ports of entry for the colonies. Because of this notion, the city began to prosper, and in 1797, the Georgia General Assembly in Louisville transferred the county seat of Glynn County from Frederica on St. Simons Island to Brunswick. Commerce and expansion Little development occurred in the town during the thirty years after its designation as the county seat. Records show that Glynn Academy, the first public building, was built in 1819; it closed four years later due to lack of attendance. The school soon re- opened, however, and in 1840, a new building was erected on Hillsborough Square, the present location of Glynn Academy. In 1826, the Georgia General Assembly granted title to much of the undeveloped town to Urbanus Dart and William R. Davis. Soon after the title was granted, Brunswick had a courthouse, a jail, and about thirty houses and stores. Along with the founder of the Brunswick and Florida Railroad, Thomas Butler King of St. Simons Island, Dart and Davis formed a company to construct a canal north to the Altamaha River, connecting the natural port with interior plantations. In 1836, the Oglethorpe House hotel was built; two years later, a newspaper was started and a new bank opened. But the panic of 1837 caused cotton and timber prices to plummet and languished the progress of the canal and railroad projects. The Cotton Crash of 1839 only put the city in further jeopardy. Following a period of recession, the Brunswick‚ÄìAltamaha Canal opened in 1854, followed by the railroad in 1856. Brunswick received its second charter that very year and was officially incorporated as a city on February 22, 1856. In 1860, the city had a population of 468, a weekly newspaper, a bank, and a sawmill. A map showing Brunswick and the surrounding area in 1864. Lanier's Oak American Civil War During the Civil War, the Confederate States Army burned the St. Simons Island Lighthouse as they left to keep it from falling into Union hands. In Brunswick, wharves as well as the Oglethorpe House (which would have made an ideal headquarters or hospital for the Union Army) were burned. When the city was ordered to evacuate, most of the citizens fled to nearby Waynesville. The canal and railroad ceased operation, and Brunswick was abandoned. After suffering from post-war depression into the 1870s, in 1874, one of the nation's largest lumber mills began operation on St. Simons Island, leading to the return of economic prosperity. Canals and rivers gave way to rail traffic as the Brunswick & Albany and Macon & Brunswick railroads connected Georgia to the Port of Brunswick. Late 19th century October 2, 1898 hurricane. In 1878, poet and native Georgian Sidney Lanier wrote his world-famous poem \\"The Marshes of Glynn\\" based on the salt marshes that lie in Glynn County as he sought relief from tuberculosis in Brunswick's climate. The Sidney Lanier Bridge, which spans across the marshes, is named in his honor. There is a historical marker overlooking the marshes of Glynn commemorating Lanier and the poem, and a live oak tree near the marker is named Lanier's Oak. The December 1888 issue of Harper's Weekly predicted that \\"Brunswick by the Sea\\" was destined to become the winter Newport. Jekyll Island had become a posh, exclusive getaway for some of the era's most influential people. Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, Pulitzers, and Goodyears escaped to Brunswick and the Golden Isles to hunt, fish, and mingle. People flocked to the breathtaking Oglethorpe Hotel once it opened its doors in 1888. In 1893, a yellow fever epidemic compounded the troubles brought by worldwide depression. Two hurricanes, one in 1893 and one in 1898, and their resulting storm surge flooded the city. However, the city quickly recovered because of the ever- expanding port business for cotton, lumber, naval stores, and oysters. The World Wars Wooden and concrete ships designed to repel mines were built in Brunswick for World War I. A large gunpowder and munitions plant was built to the northwest of town, but it was not completed before the war ended. During World War II, German U-boats threatened the coast of Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina. Blimps became a common site as they patrolled the coastal areas. During the war, blimps from Brunswick's Glynco Naval Air Station, at the time the largest blimp base in the world, safely escorted almost 100,000 ships without a single vessel lost to enemy submarines. A Liberty ship is assembled in Brunswick. Liberty ships In World War II, Brunswick boomed as over 16,000 workers of the J. A. Jones Construction Company produced ninety-nine Liberty ships and \\"Knot\\" ships (Type C1-M ships which were designed for short coastal runs, and most often named for knots) for the U.S. Maritime Commission to transport mat√©riel to the European and Pacific Theatres. The first ship was the SS James M. Wayne (named after James Moore Wayne), whose keel was laid on July 6, 1942 and was launched on March 13, 1943. The last ship was the SS Coastal Ranger, whose keel was laid on June 7, 1945 and launched on August 25, 1945. The first six ships took 305 to 331 days each to complete, but soon production ramped up and most of the remaining ships were built in about two months, bringing the average down to 89 days each. By November 1943, about four ships were launched per month. The SS William F. Jerman was completed in only 34 days in November and December 1944. Six ships could be under construction in slipways at one time. A Liberty ship is launched from Brunswick. In December 1944, the United States Navy requested six ships from each shipyard. The workers guaranteed the delivery of not six, but seven ships. For the first eleven months of 1944, an average of 4.27 ships were launched per month. Up to this point the shipyard had never produced more than five ships in a calendar month, except for August 1944, in which six ships were launched. However, the first ship of August 1944 was launched on August 1 and the last one on August 31, and only three ships had been launched in July and only four ships were launched in September. So a ship that might well have been launched in July was actually launched on August 1. The workers fulfilled their promise of completing seven ships in December 1944 by working overtime, including working on Christmas Day. Apart from the ships launched in December 1944, only one ship was completed in under 43 days. With the extra work, all of the ships launched this month were completed in 34 to 42 days (which included the SS William F. Jerman mentioned above). Furthermore, the workers asked that they not be paid for their extra work. Each worker endorsed their time-and-a-half paycheck over to the government. They never produced more than five ships in a calendar month again, although a full five ships had been launched in the previous month of November and five more were launched the next month, January 1945. By March 1945 production of ships started to decline. The last ship launched was the SS Coastal Ranger, launched on August 25, 1945, shortly after the war ended. Most of the Liberty ships from Brunswick were assigned to U.S. shipping companies and most of them were named after famous Americans (starting with U.S. Supreme Court Justices from the South). However, numbers 19, 29, and 31‚Äì40 went to Great Britain (Ministry of War Transport) under the Supplemental Defense Appropriations Act of 1941 (see Lend-Lease) and were given one-word names starting with \\"Sam\\" (e.g. Samdee). Number 73 went to the Norwegian government. An iron cut-away scale model (approximately 1:20) of a Liberty ship had been built for employee training. Sometime after the end of World War II this was put on display in Brunswick at the end of F. J. Torras Causeway near the shipyards. It was not maintained, however, and after twenty years it rusted badly and was scrapped. In 1987, efforts began to build and display a new model. This scale model was unveiled on August 23, 1991 in Mary Ross Park. It is very similar to the original scale model except that it is not cut away to reveal the inner decks. A new park (called Liberty Ship Park) is currently under construction near the site of the original Sidney Lanier Bridge and the model is to be moved there.  1991 plane crash  An Atlantic Southeast Airlines Embraer EMB 120 plane crashed in Brunswick on April 5, 1991 due to propeller control failure. The crash claimed the lives of all twenty-three people on board, including former U.S. Senator John Tower of Texas and astronaut Sonny Carter. Modern times Ritz Theatre on Newcastle Street Today Brunswick is home to a thriving port, the deepest natural port in the area. As the western-most harbor on the eastern seaboard, as well as the proclaimed \\"Shrimp Capital of the World,\\" Brunswick bustles with activity. The city is also home to Hercules, one of the oldest and most important yellow-pine chemical plants in the world. Rich-SeaPak Corporation and King and Prince Seafood are also based in the area. The Georgia Ports Authority Mayor's Point and Marine Point Terminals, as well as the Colonel's Island Bulk Facility attract business from around the world. Brunswick's Old Town residential and commercial district is the largest small town, urban National Register of Historic Places district in Georgia. Downtown is undergoing a revitalization through the National Main Street Program, preserving and showcasing its distinctive historic structures. Annual events such as the Old Town Tour of Homes, Concerts in the Square, the Brunswick Stewbilee, and HarborFest encourage visitors to discover the charms of Brunswick's parks and gracious homes.

It occurs in about 1 of every 50,000 births. Signs and symptoms Cebocephaly, a form of holoprosencephaly, in two unrelated infants with 18p- 18p- causes a wide range of medical and developmental concerns. There is significant variation in severity. This variation is due to the variability of the deletion size and breakpoints. Congenital anomalies About 10-15% of individuals with 18p- have holoprosencephaly. Approximately 10% of people with 18p- have a congenital heart anomaly. There does not appear to be a specific type of heart defect associated with a deletion of the short arm of chromosome 18. Septal defects, tetralogy of Fallot, dextrocardia, and coarctation of the aorta have all been reported in infants with 18p-. Neurologic Hypotonia is frequently seen in the 18p- population. Seizures, though uncommon, have been reported in people with 18p-. Dystonia has also been diagnosed in a small minority of young adults with 18p-. Also, tethered cord has been reported in a few people with 18p-. Vision Ptosis is quite common among people with 18p-. In many cases, surgical correction is required. Refractive errors, such as myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism, are also prevalent. Strabismus has been reported in infants and children with 18p-. Nystagmus is also present in a minority of individuals. Ear and Sinus Infections Children with 18p- have an increased incidence of ear infections, often requiring the placement of PE tubes. Hearing Conductive hearing loss may occur due to otitis media. Gastrointestinal Chronic constipation is a frequent complaint in the 18p- population. Other abdominal abnormalities that have been reported include inguinal hernias; malrotation of the gut; and abnormalities of the spleen. Genitourinary Genitourinary abnormalities are not common in 18p-. There have been a few cases of small penis and cryptorchidism in males and uterine abnormalities in females. Orthopedics There have been several orthopedic concerns identified in individuals with 18p-. These include pes planus, clubfoot, scoliosis and/or kyphosis, pectus abnormalities, cubitus valgus, congenital hip dysplasia, spina bifida occulta, and genu valgum. Endocrinology Growth hormone deficiency has been reported in several individuals with 18p-, though not at the same frequency as in the distal 18q- population. Panhypopituitarism and hypothyroidism have each been diagnosed in a handful of individuals. Also, ketotic hypoglycemia has been reported in several individuals and usually presents itself around the age of three. Psychiatry There is an increased incidence of psychiatric conditions within the distal 18p- population. In one study, 2 of 3 people with 18p- had an anxiety disorder, 1 of 3 had a communication disorder, and 1 of 3 had a motor skills disorders, and 1 of 3 had a stereotypic movement disorder. Additional research with a larger number of subjects is necessary to confirm these findings. Cognition and adaptive skills Cognitive ability in individuals with 18p- varies widely, with most falling in the mild to moderate range of impairment, though there have been some reports of people with impairment in the severe to profound range. These individuals may have had holoprosencephaly, which is frequently associated with severe impairment. Speech deficits are quite common within this population. Frequently, expressive speech lags behind other developmental parameters. Dysmorphology Common facial features include a flat and broad nasal bridge; epicanthic folds; wide mouth; short philtrum; everted lower lip; small and slightly receding chin during childhood. The ears may be low-set and posteriorly rotated. The posterior hairline may be low. Genetics 18p- describes a deletion of the short arm of chromosome 18. About half of the people with deletions have a breakpoint at the centromere. Those with it are said to have centromeric 18p-, and those without are said to have non- centromeric 18p-. Diagnosis Suspicion of a chromosome abnormality is typically raised due to the presence of developmental delays or birth defects. Diagnosis of 18p- is usually made via a blood sample. A routine chromosome analysis, or karyotype, is usually used to make the initial diagnosis, although it may also be made by microarray analysis. Increasingly, microarray analysis is also being used to clarify breakpoints. Prenatal diagnosis is possible via amniocentesis of chorionic villus sampling. MRI In some children without \\"classic\\" holoprosencephaly, microforms of holoprosencephaly may be noted on MRI, including missing olfactory tracts and bulbs and absent or hypoplastic corpus callosum. Treatment At present, treatment for 18p- is symptomatic, meaning that the focus is on treating the signs and symptoms of the conditions as they arise. To ensure early diagnosis and treatment, it is suggested that people with 18p- undergo routine screenings for hearing and vision problems. Names The preferred terminology for this condition is 18p-. In the past, it has been referred to as partial monosomy 18p and, rarely, as \\"de Grouchy syndrome, type 1\\". Research Currently, research is focusing on identifying the role of the genes on 18p in causing the signs and symptoms associated with deletions of 18p. This will ultimately enable predictive genotyping. TGIF-Mutations and deletions of this gene have been associated with holoprosencephaly. Penetrance is incomplete, meaning that a deletion of one copy of this gene is not in and of itself sufficient to cause holoprosencephaly. Ten to fifteen percent of people with 18p- have holoprosencephaly, suggesting that other genetic and environmental facts play a role in the etiology of holoprosencephaly in these individuals.
