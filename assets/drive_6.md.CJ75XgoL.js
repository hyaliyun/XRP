The failure to hold the city of Toungoo opened up the route for the Japanese to make their lunge to Lashio around the allied flank and into the Chinese rear.  Prelude  On March 8, 1942, advanced elements of the 200th Division arrived at Toungoo on the same day Rangoon fell. The Chinese took over the defense of this key location from a small detachment of British forces. Toungoo controlled the road north toward Mandalay and the bridge over the Sittang River that carried the road east to the Karenni States and north to Loikaw, the Shan States, Lashio and the Chinese province of Yunnan. Capture of the city could threaten the flank of the Allied defensive line in Burma and open the way to a Japanese advance into Central Burma. Major-General Dai Anlan the divisional commander, decided the city of Toungoo itself would be the main defensive position of the Chinese forces, with an outpost line to the south at Oktwin. He sent the Motorized Cavalry Regiment and 1st Company, 598th Infantry Regiment to the banks of the Kan River 35 miles south of Toungoo and 12 miles south of Pyu. The cavalry regiment plus a company of infantry pushed up to Kan River, with a platoon of cyclists taking up position near the bridge at the village of Nyaungchidauk. They were to delay the advance of the Japanese until the defenses at Toungoo were complete. Meanwhile, the 200th Division began digging in within the old city walls and at the advanced line at Oktwin. Toungoo city itself was divided into the new town to the east of the railway and the old town to the west. The old town had a well preserved ditch and fortified wall which provided a good defensive position for the Chinese. The Chinese then enhanced their defenses with carefully concealed positions built using an abundant supply of local timber. To make things more difficult for the attackers the land around Toungoo was flat and featureless, except for the Sittang River to the east. Ten days later on March 18 the first skirmish with the leading elements of the Japanese 55th Division, began on the Kan River at Nyaungchidauk. Falling back over the next three days, the Chinese cavalry delayed the Japanese advance while the Chinese completed their defenses at Oktwin and Toungoo. When the Japanese attacked Oktwin they were held for another two days by determined Chinese resistance.  The Battle of Toungoo  =Opening moves= On 24 March, the Japanese 112th Regiment made frontal attacks on the Oktwin positions. The 143rd Regiment, with the aid of friendly local Burmese, used the cover of the jungle and wooded area to the west of the city to advance six kilometers to the north and attack Toungoo airfield and a nearby rail station. It was defended by only an engineer battalion, whose commander withdrew in a panic. This cut the 200th Division's communications to the north, and left it encircled on three sides. Dai Anlan abandoned the outlying positions to concentrate his defense near the city walls of Toungoo. 598th Regiment held the northern part of the Toungoo defense, 599th Regiment held the south of the city, and 600th Regiment defended the west. Divisional Headquarters moved from the city to the eastern bank of the Sittang to avoid Japanese air and artillery attacks, and also to safeguard the remaining supply route to the east. Part of a Replacement Regiment which had arrived the previous day was posted on the eastern bank of the Sittang River, to extend the positions to cover the supply line as well as the divisional HQ. =Attack on the City= At 0800, on March 25 the Japanese launched an all out attack against all three sides of the city, with the 143rd Regiment on the left, the 112th Regiment on the right, and the Cavalry Regiment plus a company of infantry attacking along the Sittang River. The objective was to press the Chinese forces against the Sittang where they would be annihilated. Despite local penetrations in the north-western part of the defensive perimeter, heavy Chinese resistance prevented the Japanese making major progress until 2200 when Japanese troops infiltrated Chinese positions in the north-western part of the Toungoo citadel, soon followed by a full battalion. The Chinese reinforced the 600th Regiment with the 2nd Battalion, 598th Regiment and counter-attacked. There was heavy house to house fighting and the lines between the forces were so close that Japanese air and artillery support found it difficult to avoid hitting their own men. The counterattack failed to recover the lost positions when Japanese troops made good use of the buildings and the stone walls around a local cemetery. The 600th Regiment was moved back between the other two regiments to defend Toungoo city itself. Elsewhere the bridge over River Sittang became the target for Japanese firepower and was so severely damaged that vehicles could not cross it. Japanese attacks continued on March 26. The 112th Regiment attacked and took the south-western corner of Toungoo but was unable to make any further progress. On the left, a flanking move to attack the north-western part of Toungoo was no more successful. The Cavalry Regiment's attack was also repulsed. The Chinese launched counterattacks against the 112th and Cavalry Regiments with about 300 troops in each sector. These were repulsed, but losses were heavy and offensive strength dropped. By the evening, the Japanese had taken the western part of the city to the west of the railroad while the Chinese troops held on to the main part of the city east of the railroad. Both sides faced each other across the railway at a distance of less than 100 meters, making it difficult for Japanese air and artillery support. Eventually the Japanese withdrew some 200 meters to allow their planes and guns to operate. During the bombardment the Chinese hid in their camouflaged positions then held their fire until the Japanese advanced and were within 40‚Äì50 meters and then opened up on them with machine guns and grenades. This happened repeatedly and by the end of the day the 200th Division had very heavy casualties, but the Japanese also suffered heavily and were finding it hard to continue the frontal attacks. The arrival of the New 22nd Division to the north of Yedashe forced the Japanese to send the 2nd Battalion, 143rd Regiment to Nangyuen as a blocking force to stop them from reaching Toungoo, greatly reducing Japanese attacking strength. The third regiment of the 55th Division, the 144th Regiment, as well as a battalion of artillery and a company of cavalry were not with the division in the Battle of Toungoo, so that the division really did not have sufficient manpower and the attack bogged down as a result. On March 27, there was a pause in the morning, but Japanese planes came back in the afternoon and systematically bombed and strafed Chinese positions. The Japanese continued to press their attacks with this air support, and in the afternoon fired large numbers of tear gas shells. Despite all this, the Chinese held their ground. It was then decided to wait for the 3rd Field Artillery Regiment with its 15 cm howitzers to arrive to attack the Chinese positions again on March 28, which was also to be supported by air attacks. =New Assault= On March 28, the 3rd Heavy Field Artillery Regiment arrived, and with strong support from bombers and more gas attacks inflicted heavy casualties on the Chinese. The right wing of the attack managed to destroy many Chinese strongpoints with artillery support. However, the light bombers did not arrive until 1500 due to heavy fog at the airfields, and it was not possible to overcome stubborn resistance of the Chinese due to their defense in depth, even though the fighting lasted into the evening. Meanwhile, the Reconnaissance Regiment of the Japanese 56th Division, consisting of two motorized infantry companies and a machine gun company, a field artillery company of mountain guns, and a platoon of engineers, was moving rapidly north from Rangoon in a column of 45 trucks, with a company of 6 armored cars and a total of some 404 men. It made rapid progress along the main road to Toungoo and reached divisional HQ of the 55th Division by noon on March 28. It was decided to move this force east of the Sittang River to attack the rear of the Chinese positions. Crossing at 2000 the same day, it forded the Sittang at Wagyi, a few kilometers south of the city where the water was only chest high, leaving its vehicles behind. If the Japanese attack east of the Sittang was successful, the entire 200th Division would be encircled. The divisional commander personally organized the defence, and two companies from the 3rd Battalion of the 598th Regiment were ordered to attack the exposed left flank of the Japanese. A vicious fight continued within the city of Toungoo. Around the divisional HQ on the east bank, fighting inflicted heavy casualties on the 3rd Battalion, 599th Regiment as well as the divisional support company; but the Chinese were able to hold their ground. On March 29, the 55th Division used its last strength to attack, supported by all available guns. By noon, the troops on the left were able to advance into the north western part of the city, and the escape route of the Chinese was threatened. Covered by the fight to the west, the Reconnaissance Regiment of the 56th Division moved north and attacked the Chinese flank guard east of the river and by midday on the 29th had overrun it. Threatening the divisional HQ of the 200th Division and the Sittang River bridge. On the afternoon of March 29 orders came for the entire 200th Division to withdraw that evening towards the east initially, then to the north along the eastern bank of the River Sittang. Fighting in the city continued into the dark with the city on fire. The Chinese continued to resist stubbornly and no progress was made. By 2200 on March 29, 56 Division's motorized Reconnaissance Regiment had closed in on the bridge over the Sittang River and noted signs of wavering in the Chinese forces as night fell. =Chinese Withdrawal= However this was the Chinese withdrawal. Dai Anlan had each Chinese battalion leave a rearguard which launched night attacks to cover the withdrawal of the main force. The retreat was led by the 599th Regiment crossing the battered and threatened bridge, followed by the 600th Regiment and then the 598th Regiment which forded the river. By 0400 the entire 200th Division had moved out of Toungoo in good condition, taking all the wounded along. The Chinese claimed that their rearguards left before dawn. On the morning of March 30 the 55th Division attacked all along the front claiming heavy resistance, despite withdrawal of most (if not all) of the Chinese. After engineers managed to blow up Chinese positions and strongpoints at 0850, the 55th Division troops finally broke through and linked up with the troops of the 56th Division that had seized the vital bridge over the Sittang at 0700 and then attacked Toungoo from the east. This ended the battle leaving the Japanese in possession of the city and bridge over the Sittang. The road to the east was open for the Japanese to use to outflank the allied line in Burma. New 22nd Division sent south to support the 200th Division had meanwhile advanced as far as Nangyun railway station, and partially dislodged the Japanese II Battalion of 143 Regiment from their position there. They also sent patrols further south toward Toungoo threatening the Japanese flank and rear. The retreating 200th Division joined them at Yedashe after withdrawing northward on the east bank from Toungoo, crossing the Sittang River east of Nangyun. Subsequently, the Chinese withdrew to a new defensive positions at Yedashe, to continue to block the Japanese advance up the Sittang River Valley.

Quelch served in the Canadian Expeditionary Force in World War I from 1914 to 1918. During his distinguished military career, he achieved the rank of Captain and was awarded the prestigious Military Cross for bravery. Political career Quelch first ran for public office in the 1935 Canadian federal election as a candidate from the Social Credit Party of Canada in the Acadia district in Alberta. In that election, he defeated incumbent Robert Gardiner and two other candidates in a landslide victory. Quelch stood for re- election for a second term in office in the 1940 Canadian federal election. In one of the closest contests in that election, he retained his seat by a margin of 27 votes, defeating Liberal candidate Arthur Day, whom he had previously faced in 1935. Quelch was re-elected to his third term in the 1945 Canadian federal election by a much more comfortable margin, and was re-elected to a fourth term in the 1949 Canadian federal election. In 1950, Quelch was appointed by Liberal Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent to serve as one of six members from all parties as a Parliamentary adviser to the Canadian staff to the United Nations Assembly. He was re-elected to his fifth term in office in the 1953 Canadian federal election. In that election, he once again faced and defeated Liberal candidate Arthur Day for the third time in another close election. Quelch would run for his final term in office in the 1957 Canadian federal election; he won in a landslide and retired from federal politics a year later when the government dissolved in 1958. Over his 23 years of service in the House of Commons of Canada, he served as critic for finance, agriculture, and fisheries. Quelch died of pneumonia in September 1975 but, due to an oversight, no tribute was paid to him as was custom with deceased former members from the Canadian House of Commons. Twenty-four years later, Member of Parliament David Chatters paid tribute to the memory of Quelch during the Statements by Members period on December 15, 1999. Quelch's great- granddaughter was working for Chatters at the time and she wrote the tribute read by Chatters.

It aired on KBS2 from November 16, 2005 to February 23, 2006 on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:55 for 30 episodes. The story about four siblings living in a village in the 1960s, and a woman fighting to clear her dead father's name after he is wrongly accused of her stepmother's murder. Golden Apple received average viewership ratings of 17.43%, making it the 13th highest-rated Korean drama in 2006. Plot Kim Chun-dong (Choi Il-hwa) is a widowed farmer with one daughter, Kyung-sook (Lee Young-ah), and two sons, Kyung-gu (Kim Myung-jae) and Kyung-min (Park Ji-bin). Kyung-sook is committed to maintaining the household after the passing of their mother, and the villagers praise her sweet, cheerful nature and hardworking attitude. Everyday chores leave her little time for fun, but she does shed her tough exterior for Park Jong-gyu, the farm owner's son. A student at Seoul National University, Jong-gyu visits on occasion to the delight of Kyung-sook. Her father Chun-dong marries again, and the woman (Bang Eun-hee) has a six-year-daughter, Keum-shil (Yoo Yeon-mi). The new siblings live a humble but happy life in the countryside. But the marriage is not a happy one and Keum-shil's mother continues her affair with Park Byung-sam (Lee Deok-hwa) a rich landlord in the village who is running for a seat in the Parliament. After the election, her body is discovered floating in the river and Chun-dong is wrongly accused of being the killer. He confesses after being tortured by the police and later dies in custody before the trial. Park Byung- sam, who is in fact Keum-shil's real father, orders his brother-in-law Jung (Lee Ki-young) to adopt Keum-shil, then gives him a job at the Intelligence Office in Seoul. Years later, Kyung-sook (Park Sol-mi) has also moved to Seoul and is working hard to raise her brothers (Kim Ji-hoon, Ji Hyun-woo). She vows that she will clear her father's name and find the real killer. Park Byung-sam remains her number one suspect even though she was in love with his son, Jong- gyu (Jung Chan).

A few species occur in coniferous forests in tropical and subtropical areas (Mexico, Cuba), while very few genera (e.g., Zamium) are present in Austral Africa and Madagascar (e.g., Masatopus). Morphology =Adult= Spondylidinae are insects characterised by cerambycine aspect, generally with a more or less flattened, dark body, oblique head and scarcely elongated antennae. Their sexual dimorphism is scarcely evident, that i,s males and females are scarcely distinguishable. Unlike Cerambycinae, their stridulitrum is divided. =Larva= The larvae are completely different from those of Cerambycinae and similar to those of Lepturinae in several respects, being characterised by a rounded head and large labrum. They also typically possess two closely spaced small spines on the last abdominal segment. Biology =Adult= Spondylidinae are nearly all nocturnal or crepuscular. Only the genus Tetropium, characterised by finely faceted eyes, has diurnal activity. The adults live on the host plants, taking refuge under barks or trunks during inactive periods. =Larva= Except for some Saphanini (Saphanus, Drymochares) and Anisarthrini, the larvae of most of species attack conifers. Taxonomy =History= Spondylidinae have a complicated systematic history, and details of the relationships are still uncertain. In 1897 XambeuXambeu F., 1897-1902. Moeurs et m√©tamorphoses des insectes, 8e M√©moire, Longicornes .

Nevertheless, this classification was rejected by contemporaneous authors since Spondylis was believed to be related to Prioninae and Parandra.Lameere A., 1913. Cerambycidae: Prioninae. Coleopterorum Catalogus 52, S. Schenkling, Berlin, 108 pp. At that time most spondylidine genera were placed within the subfamily Aseminae.

Spondylidini - whose larvae are indistinguishable from that of all other traditional Aseminae - appear to be simply highly derived Asemini, with adult morphology convergent with lucaniform Prioninae and the Vesperidae of the Amazon rainforest genus Migdolus. =Current systematics= Spondylidinae (this name has priority over Aseminae) includes five tribes.Zicha O.

Properties  * The fundamental group of the presentation complex is the group G itself. * The universal cover of the presentation complex is a Cayley complex for G, whose 1-skeleton is the Cayley graph of G. * Any presentation complex for G is the 2-skeleton of an Eilenberg‚ÄìMacLane space K(G,1).  Examples  Let G= Z^2 be the two- dimensional integer lattice, with presentation : G=langle x,yxyx^{-1}y^{-1}rangle. Then the presentation complex for G is a torus, obtained by gluing the opposite sides of a square, the 2-cell, which are labelled x and y. All four corners of the square are glued into a single vertex, the 0-cell of the presentation complex, while a pair consisting of a longtitudal and meridian circles on the torus, intersecting at the vertex, constitutes its 1-skeleton. The associated Cayley complex is a regular tiling of the plane by unit squares. The 1-skeleton of this complex is a Cayley graph for Z^2.

Sprague de Camp, part of the Harold Shea series he originated in collaboration with Fletcher Pratt and later continued with Christopher Stasheff. It was first published in the 1990 World Fantasy Convention Program Book. It first appeared in book form as a limited edition hardcover chapbook issued by Wildside Press in August, 1991, with a paperback edition following from the same publisher in October of the same year. In addition to the title story, the book includes an afterword by de Camp and illustrations by Stephen Fabian; the paperback edition also has a cover by Fabian. The story was afterwards reprinted, slightly revised, in de Camp and Stasheff's shared world anthology The Enchanter Reborn (1992). The original version was later reprinted together with the remainder of the de Camp/Pratt Harold Shea stories in the collection The Mathematics of Magic: The Enchanter Stories of L. Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt (2007). The Harold Shea stories are parallel world tales in which universes where magic works coexist with our own, and in which those based on the mythologies, legends, and literary fantasies of our world and can be reached by aligning one's mind to them by a system of symbolic logic. In Sir Harold and the Gnome King, Shea visits two such worlds, first (briefly) that of L. Ron Hubbard's setting from The Case of the Friendly Corpse (actually invented by John D. Clark and Mark Baldwin) and second L. Frank Baum's land of Oz. As originally written, Sir Harold and the Gnome King was a direct sequel to de Camp and Pratt's previous Harold Shea story \\"The Green Magician\\", and appears to have been intended to tie up the main loose end remaining from that story, in which Shea's colleague Walter Bayard had been left stranded in the world of Irish mythology. Another issue addressed was a long-standing plot complication introduced by L. Ron Hubbard's \\"borrowing\\" of Shea for use in his novella The Case of the Friendly Corpse (1941), previously ignored by de Camp and Pratt. While the collaborators' original discussions for a sequel to \\"The Green Magician\\" had called for a story set in the world of Persian mythology, de Camp abandoned that plan in the sequel written. When the story was reprinted in The Enchanter Reborn another tale, \\"Professor Harold and the Trustees\\", was interposed between it and \\"The Green Magician\\", necessitating some alteration to take into account the events of the new story. This was clumsily done through the insertion of a phrase into one sentence in a way that disturbed the actual sense of the sentence; further, a longer block of text was allowed to remain which should have been excised, as it directly contradicts the account of the new story. Plot summary Harold Shea's wife Belphebe of Faerie suggests he undertake a transdimensional expedition to retrieve his colleague Walter Bayard, who is stranded in the world of Irish mythology. Walter's long absence has put him in danger of losing his tenure at the Garaden Institute that employs both him and Harold as psychologists. A secondary advantage to Belphebe will be to get Harold out of her hair; she is pregnant with their first child, and he is getting on her nerves. Harold prepares for the trip more carefully than on previous occasions, reluctant to risk his life as cavalierly as before now that he has a family. In particular, he replaces the √©p√©e he formerly favored with a stronger cavalry saber, and dons a mail shirt for greater protection. To ensure he is able to locate Walter amid the uncertainties of transdimensional travel, he makes the goal of his expedition not Eriu but the Land of Oz, whose rulers are possessed of an artifact \\"effective as a teletransporter,\\" the Magic Belt of the Gnome King. (De Camp prefers the standard spelling of \\"gnome\\" to Baum's idiosyncratic \\"nome.\\") As usual, things immediately go wrong. Instead of Oz, Harold ends up in a decidedly more sinister place, the University of the Unholy Names in Dej, a world of vaguely Islamic and Arabic antecedents. There he encounters the student Bilsa at-T√¢lib, who enthusiastically suggests a magical contest between them and conjures up a gigantic snake that immediately snaps Harold up. Fortunately, the latter's mail shirt protects him long enough for him to repeat the spell that transports him between worlds, and this time he really does end up in Oz (thankfully sans snake). The Oz he encounters is greatly changed from the land of which Baum had written, the enchantment that had kept its inhabitants ageless having been broken through a misuse of magic by a dabbler in spells named Dranol Drabbo some years prior. Dorothy Gale and Princess Ozma are now grown up, married, and with children of their own. Moreover, Harold finds Ozma's husband, King Evardo of Ev, a much more canny and realistic ruler than Ozma in her youth; the royal pair is willing to help him, but only for a price! Lengthy negotiations ensue, as a result of which Harold finds himself committed to rescuing their son Prince Oznev, who is being held captive by Kaliko, the current king of the Gnomes. To facilitate his foray into the Gnome Kingdom Harold demands and receives the service of former gnome king Ruggedo, an old enemy of Oz, as guide, along with tarncaps to render them invisible. He also commissions the local blacksmith to forge a pair of bolt cutters under his direction with which to free Oznev. Meanwhile, Ozma uses the Magic Belt to summon Walter from Eriu. Much to her embarrassment Walter arrives in bed and with a bedmate, having recently acquired an Irish wife, Boann ni Colum. On the way to the underground Gnome Kingdom Ruggedo, pondering his past failures, consults Harold in his psychological capacity. His problem, it turns out, is that he is an unscrupulous, treacherous, selfish, greedy, lying, thieving scoundrel, and at the same time an irascible, ornery, cantankerous, ill- mannered, bad-tempered old grouch. Harold informs him that he will never be popular while remaining both; to succeed, he must overcome one trait or the other. Afterward the two penetrate the Gnomish Kingdom and manage to liberate Oznev. Ruggedo, determined to apply Harold's advice, stays to dispute the throne with Kaliko. Meanwhile, Harold and the prince duel with and defeat Drabbo, who has become Kaliko's chancellor. Rescuer and prince return to Oz amid general acclaim. Harold then prepares for his return home, whence Walter and Boann plan to follow in the wake of the banquet celebrating Oznev's deliverance. As for Ruggedo, when last seen he had expelled Kaliko from the Gnome Kingdom, declared monarchy obsolete, and proclaimed himself Lifetime President and Founding Father of the Gnomic Republic. Differences from earlier Harold Shea stories In previous tales Harold indulged his yearning for romantic adventure; this one brings his more practical characteristics to the fore. It also marks a major change in both the fantasy worlds de Camp chooses for his protagonist to visit and the manner in which they are portrayed. Hitherto Harold was sent primarily to venues based on mythology or pre-modern fantastic literature; these were depicted faithfully according to the original sources, and much of the action involved puzzling out and becoming proficient in the magical systems holding sway in them. Now the venues are drawn from modern fantasy and are reimagined in a way that strips them of what de Camp regards as their more absurd aspects. Thus, exploration of the source material is displaced by a revisionist view of it, while the protagonists‚Äô interest in figuring out the local physics gives way to the pursuit of more immediate goals. In the present tale Harold displays no intrinsic interest in the magic of Oz, but only in how it might further his objectives. The \\"absurdities\\" dispensed with include the agelessness of the Ozites and Ozma's youthful innocence and strict sense of justice; the former having been eliminated by Dranol Drabbo's misuse of magic and the latter, recharacterized as childish foolishnesses, by Ozma having outgrown them with age and experience. De Camp's abandonment of an ageless Oz has one literary precursor in a similar visit to Baum's creation related in a work of his colleague Robert A. Heinlein, The Number of the Beast, in which some of the problematic aspects of agelessness are expounded. De Camp's revisionistic tendencies would become even more pronounced in his subsequent Harold Shea tale, \\"Sir Harold of Zodanga\\". In an inconsistency between the present story and previous entries in the series, the era in which it takes place seems to have been silently revised from the 1940s of the original tales to the 1990s in which it was written. For instance, Harold and Belphebe are able to learn the gender of their unborn child through a test unknown in the 1940s; Harold also displays knowledge of the 1986 death of L. Ron Hubbard and Hubbard's authorial connection with the world of The Friendly Corpse ‚Äî even though the Hubbard story was published in the 1940s and takes place after Harold's visit to that world in the present tale!

Members of the Muntafiq tribal confederation are the largest and most influential Iraqi Shia community. The confederation‚Äôs tribes predominantly settled in Baghdad and Iraq's southern provinces. The majority of Shia Iraqis‚Äô come from the Muntafiq tribal confederation, the confederation is not homogeneous in terms of sect/religion. Centuries of intermarriage and intermingling created mixed Sunni- Shia tribes. Therefore, a minority of individual tribes within the confederation is Sunni. Overall, it is almost impossible to delineate who is, and who is not part of the Muntafiq. Nevertheless, the majority of Iraqi Shia are Muntafiq members. The tribe is divided into three main branches: Bani Malik, al-Ajwad, and Bani Sa'id. Most of the tribe traces its genealogy to the tribe of Banu 'Uqayl of the large and ancient Banu 'Amir confederation of Nejd. However, the tribe's traditional leaders are the Al Saadun (\\"the house of Saadun\\"), who are said to be Sharifs originating from Mecca, while the al-Ajwad branch is said to partially originate from the ancient Arab tribe of Tayy (who later became the tribe of Shammar, currently also found in Iraq). The Muntafiq tribe was led by Yusuf Beg of the Saadun clan. They were traditional rivals of the Dhufir and of Ibn Saud, although Yusuf sometimes co-operated with Ibn Saud. Nevertheless, as Ibn Saud gained control over the Arabian Peninsula, members of the Muntafiq and Dhufir moved into Mesopotamia and settled. The Dhufir and the Muntafiq tribes subsequently, integrated and became Iraqi tribes. The tribe begins to appear in the Iraqi deserts in the late Abbasid era, and was once one of the most powerful Bedouin tribes in Iraq. In Ottoman times, the tribe held control over the region of Basrah under Ottoman suzerainty. In 1521, they successfully occupied al-Ahsa and al-Qatif (eastern Saudi Arabia today) on the Ottomans' behalf, before being expelled by Banu Khalid. During the Ottoman era, most of the tribe settled into sedentary life and took up agriculture in southern and western Iraq. During the Ottoman era, from the late eighteenth century onwards, al-Muntafiq converted to Shia Islam.The Shi'is of Iraq By Yitzhak Nakash, pg.27Lorimer, Gazetteer, 2B:1273; Great Britain, naval intelligence division, geographical handbook series, Iraq and the Persian Gulf, September 1944, 379-80; Great Britain, office of the civil commissioner, The Arab of Mesopotamia, Basra, 1917,6. The city of Nasiriya in southern Iraq was named after one of the tribe's sheikhs, and the surrounding province was known as \\"Al-Muntafiq Province\\" until 1976. Those who remained bedouin were herders of small animals such as sheep and goat, rather than camels, and this made them less mobile and less competent as a fighting force compared to the camel- herding tribes of inner Arabia. Although the tribe's nominal leaders, the Al Saadun, are Sunnis, most of the tribe's members follow the Shi'ite sect of Islam. After many decades of sedentarization, the tribal bond has weakened and the leadership of the Al Saadun is largely nominal.

They also established crushing mills on the forestland without permission from government. Forestation program In early 2005, Laskar Muqsudur Rahman, Deputy Conservator of Forests, Sylhet Forest Division, observed that Jaflong that he heard in his boyhood as the 'lungs' of Greater Sylhet was at stake due to on going encroachments and establishment of unauthorized stone crushing mills. He took initiatives to recover the land and establish a recreation-cum-botanical park named as 'Jaflong Green Park'. The first foundation stone for the thematic Green Park at Jaflong was laid by Laskar Muqsudur Rahman, Deputy Conservator of Forests in 2005 with the cooperation of local forest staffs led by Forest Ranger Mohammad Ali. Nonetheless, at the inception it was a challenging task due to local conflicts and procedural constraints. The forestation program in Jaflong Green Park has been started under supervision of the joint forces, Jaflong Foundation and Forest Department. They have jointly taken up the forestation program with about 100 hectares of grabbed land. Under the forestation program, various types of trees, including hybrid Akash-moni, are being planted in the park to maintain ecological balance. thumb Gallery Image:Jaflong Sylhet Bangladesh (19).JPG Image:Jaflong Sylhet Bangladesh (18).JPGBoats Image:Jaflong Sylhet Bangladesh (16).JPG Image:Jaflong Sylhet Bangladesh (15).JPGStone Collecting Image:Jaflong Sylhet Bangladesh (12).JPGBoats Image:Jaflong Sylhet Bangladesh (11).JPG Image:Jaflong Sylhet Bangladesh (7).JPG Image:Jaflong Sylhet Bangladesh (3).JPGBoats Image:Jaflong Sylhet Bangladesh (21).JPGSpring on the way to Jaflong Image:Jaflong Sylhet Bangladesh (8).JPGWay to Jaflong Image:Jaflong Sylhet Bangladesh (5).JPGQuern stones for sale in Jafflong Image:Tea Garden in Jaflong Sylhet Bangladesh 05.JPGTea Garden at Jaflong Image:Boats in Jaflong Sylhet Bangladesh 33.JPGBoats Image:House of Khasia Tribe in Jaflong Sylhet Bangladesh 07.JPGHouses of Khasia Tribe See also *Jaintia Rajbari References External links * Biodiversity of Jaflong * Jubilant at Jaflong.

The station is licensed to the city of Plymouth and broadcasts from a tower southwest of the city. The station also has a translator station with the calls W241AG broadcasting at 96.1 FM from the tower site behind the Midwest studios in Sheboygan, which was launched in June 2006 due to ongoing interference problems with WBFM and WHBZ within the city on the 104.5 frequency, along with summer co-channel interference with Muskegon, Michigan's WSNX-FM across Lake Michigan. The stations are marketed together as 104-5 & 96-1, The Point, with the call letters completely de-emphasized beyond station identification purposes. History Studios The station launched in 1990 with an easy listening format, then slowly over the years went more towards a more adult contemporary format. In 1999, the transition was complete, and the station took on The Point branding, then a popular brand for radio stations using that format. After then-adult contemporary WWJR became an active rock station in 2000 under the calls WHBZ, the station became the market's sole AC station until 2003, when Cleveland-based WKTT switched from country to AC as WLKN. At this time, the station was owned by Mountain Dog Media. The station carried syndicated programming on the weekends, including radio-optimized programming from the VH1 Radio Network, Nina Blackwood's Absolutely 80's, and The Retro Pop Reunion. In 2005, Mountain Dog sold the station to Midwest Communications while keeping ESPN Radio affiliate WCLB, which was restricted by a non-compete agreement until 2010.http://www.northpine.com/broadcast/archive/news0905.html Shortly after, Midwest changed tweaked the format to Hot AC and ended syndicated programming on the station (except for a Sunday airing of American Top 40), and replaced the station's airstaff with new personalities, including voice tracked personalities from other Midwest stations in Green Bay and Wausau, though the morning show remains locally originated, hosted by Ben Olsen with local news updates from WHBL. In September 2008, the station took a CHR (Top 40) format, adding current hip-hop/R&B; songs to their playlist and narrowing it down to music after 2001, with a few pre-2001 tracks sprinkled in through the playlist. On September 2009, WXER returned to a Hot AC format after a one-year run with CHR (Top 40). Some formerly recorded voicetracked programming now also airs live to facilitate listener requests, though it still originates from outside of Sheboygan. =Studio facilities history= WXER originally broadcast from studios with then co-owned WPLY (1420, now WGXI) on Highway 57 east of the city (which remains the home of WGXI, and formerly WSTM-FM until its sale in 2017), but in 1994 after WPLY was sold off, moved them to Falls Plaza, a small shopping center off Fond du Lac Avenue in Sheboygan Falls, which were shared by former sister station WCNZ/WCLB (950 AM). Finally, the station moved to the Washington Avenue facilities of Midwest's other stations in Sheboygan when bought by the group in 2005.

The RACT is ranked tenth in seniority of the corps of the Australian Army, and is the most senior Logistics corps. It was formed on 1 June 1973 as an amalgamation of the Royal Australian Army Service Corps (RAASC) and Royal Australian Engineers Transportation Service. The RACT is responsible for the operation of army surface transport assets, movement control, terminal and postal services, and Army aspects of air logistic support. Role The role of the Royal Australian Corps of Transport is to control and operate Army-owned surface transport, other than unit transport, and to provide movement control, terminal, postal and Army aspects of air logistic support. Members of the corps are employed in a variety of roles: road transport, movements, air dispatch, postal, water transport, and terminal operations. History The RACT was formed on 1 June 1973 from an amalgamation of two existing corps: Royal Australian Army Service Corps (RAASC) and Royal Australian Engineers Transportation Service (RAE-TN). From RAASC, RACT gained the responsibilities of road and amphibian transport, air dispatch and postal functions, while from RAE-TN it gained its water transport, terminal and movements roles. The remaining RAASC functions‚Äîsuch as the provision of foodstuffs and petrol, oils and lubricants‚Äîwere allocated to the Royal Australian Army Ordnance Corps (RAAOC), and RAASC ceased to exist on 31 May 1973.Palazzo 2001, p. 2. The corps also draws its origins from the Australian Army Transportation Corps, which existed between 1945 and 1947. =Early beginnings= Prior to the Federation of Australia in 1901, each Australian state maintained its own military forces. Victoria was the first to raise a logistic unit, which was known as the 'Ordnance, Commissariat and Transport Corps' in 1887; later renamed the Commissariat and Transport Corps. A similar unit known as the Army Service Corps was founded in New South Wales, and upon the formation of the national army in 1901, the predecessor to RACT, the Australian Army Service Corps (AASC) was formed. By 1905, transport- specific units were raised within the AASC for the provision of land transport, including the No. 1 Light Horse Supply Column in New South Wales, and No. 2 Infantry Supply Column in Victoria.Palazzo 2001, p. 4. =Service history during WWI as a part of the AASC= =Australian Army Transportation Corps (AATnC) and RAE(Tn)= Sometime in 1940, the Directorate of Rail Transportation was formed to coordinate movements between Australian rail networks and roads. In early 1942, a joint services decision was made to make the Army responsible for the supply and operation of small water craft and dock services, thus the Directorate of Water Transportation (Small Craft) RAE, was formed. This decision was made due to Navy being less able to command and control personnel that were widely dispersed where land forces were operating, particularly in New Guinea. On 6 August 1945, the Australian Army Transportation Corps (AATnC) was formed by the amalgamation of these directorates, along with Road transport, and all their associated operating units. However, on 7 April 1947, road transport was separated back into the AASC, and the remaining amalgamation become known as the Transportation Service RAE, or RAE(Tn). The RAE(Tn) latter expanded to include the operation of all military terminals. The railway elements were maintained through an Army Reserve Unit until the late 1960s. The RAE(Tn) was combined again with Road transport from the AASC in the formation of the RACT on 1 June 1973. =Service history during WWII= AASC Troops near Wewak, New Guinea during WWII using Australian landing craft to transport forward trucks loaded with stores. =Transport as a part of the AASC 1947‚Äì1973= Road Transport was a part of the Australian Army Service Corps between 1901‚Äì1945 and 1947‚Äì1973. Corps embellishments =Banners= RACT Princess Royal Banner 2013 At Puckapunyal on 4 June 1983 the RACT was presented with its former Princess Alice banner. It was received from the Governor General of Australia, Sir Ninian Stephen, who presented it on behalf of Princess Alice.Palazzo 2001, p. 23. Following the death of Princess Alice in 2004, Anne, The Princess Royal, was announced as the next Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal Australian Corps of Transport on the 17 March 2011 at the 2011 RACT Corps Conference. On 1 June 2013, at Amberley, the RACT was presented with its new Princess Royal Banner. It is red with gold embroidery of the Princess Royal cypher, RACT badge and year 2013. The reverse side has the Commonwealth Coat of Arms. The RACT Banner is currently housed in the Tobruk Barracks Officers' Mess at Puckapunyal. =Lanyard and Corps colours= The RACT Lanyard is a braided blue and red lanyard to represent its RAASC and RAE heritage. Notably, RACT was the first corps in the Australian Army to receive approval to wear a braided lanyard.Palazzo 2001, p. 149. The corps colours of the RACT are blue, white and scarlet. Each of the colours represents various aspects of the history of the corps: * Blue: representing the early uniforms worn by the corps predecessors * White: represents the white facings of the Military Train and also denotes the corps mounted background * Scarlet: represents the amalgamation of the RAE Transportation Service.Palazzo 2001, pg. 149, 161. =Badge= The badge of the RACT consists of the seven-pointed Federation Star incorporating the Royal Cipher, being common to both the badges of the Royal Australian Engineers (RAE) and Royal Australian Army Service Corps (RAASC). Surrounding the Royal Cipher is a circlet containing the name 'Royal Australian Corps of Transport', which is enclosed by a laurel wreath and the Corps motto Par Oneri or 'Equal to the Task'.Palazzo 2001, p. 148. Units and locations The Royal Australian Corps of Transport has a significant presence at both Puckapunyal, Victoria where the main elements of the Army School of Transport (AST) operates alongside two transport squadrons; and at the Army Logistic Training Centre (ALTC), Bandiana and Bonegilla, Victoria which also has elements of the Army School of Transport. RACT soldiers and officers are employed all throughout Australia and overseas. Transport units in the Australian army are incorporated in Combat Service Support Battalions (CSSB) or Force Support Battalions (FSB) units apart from the 17th Sustainment Brigade. RACT personnel however, are broadly employed, particularly as driver specialists, within non-Transport units, such as infantry battalions, engineering regiments, health companies and other logistics units and sub- units as well as within Special Operations Command units. =Air Dispatch= Army Air Dispatch is provided by a combined Regular and Reserve Army 176 Air Dispatch Squadron based at RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales, Australia, the squadron is a sub-unit of the 9th Force Support Battalion (9 FSB). Air Dispatch uses the motto Par Oneri de Caelo, meaning Equal to the Task from the Sky. =Cargo and Terminal= The 30 Terminal Squadron, located in Townsville, Queensland operates as a part of 10th Force Support Battalion (10 FSB) of the 17th Combat Service Support Brigade primarily provides the army capability for the movement of cargo by air, land and sea. Cargo and Terminal operations work closely with the Australian Navy and Ships' Army Departments (previously known as Ships' Army Detachments) in loading and unloading of cargo and equipment. =Movements= RACT personnel are responsible for planning, coordinating, executing, controlling and monitoring the operational and strategic movements of personnel and equipment of the ADF, and contribute to ADF movements in a joint forces environment. Movements are coordinated through 1st Joint Movement Group and Joint Movement Control Offices (JMCOs) located in most capital cities across Australia as well as all locations where there are significant army units. =Postal= During the First World War, Australia had a dedicated Australian Army Postal Corps. However, since formation of the RACT, the responsibility of Postal Services for the ADF falls primarily to a small number of RACT personnel operating at Lavarack Barracks in Queensland and is loosely linked to the Australia Post delivery network. The military staff are responsible to operate Australian Forces Post Offices (AFPO) and are typically dynamic and exist in locations where Australian forces are operating overseas or on major exercises. =Road Transport= Road Transport is the largest capability group of the RACT. The regular army road transport units are:Palazzo 2001, pg. 37, 156‚Äì157. * 1st Transport Squadron (1 CSSB), located in both Darwin, Northern Territory and Adelaide, South Australia. * 2nd Transport Squadron (7 CSSB), disbanded, located in Brisbane, Queensland * 5th Transport Squadron (7 CSSB), located in Brisbane, Queensland * 9th Transport Squadron (3 CSSB), located in Townsville, Queensland * 26th Transport Squadron (9 FSB), located in Amberley, Queensland The army reserve road transport units are regional, and generally operate from multiple depots: * 3rd Transport Squadron (5 CSSB), located in Southern NSW & ACT * 4th Transport Squadron (11 CSSB), located in Victoria * 8th Transport Squadron (9 CSSB), located in South Australia * 10th Transport Squadron (13 CSSB), located in Western Australia * 7th Transport Squadron (4 CSSB), located in Victoria * 15th Transport Squadron (2 FSB), located in Victoria * 16th Transport Squadron (8 CSSB), located in Newcastle NSW * 44th Transport Squadron (2 FSB), located in Tasmania =Water Transport= Army Water Transport involves the operation of amphibious watercraft, such as the LARC-V for transport across sea, inland water and ship to shore operations (also known as Logistics over-the-shore operations). The 35 Water Transport Squadron part of the 10th Force Support Battalion (10 FSB) located in Townsville, Queensland as a part of the 17th Sustainment Brigade primarily provides this capability for the Australian Army. Employment categories The Royal Australian Corps of Transport is responsible for providing a vast range of capabilities, through several different employment categories which are available to both Australian Regular Army and Australian Army Reserve (part-time service): * Air Dispatchers * Cargo Specialists (full- time service only) * Driver Specialists * Marine Specialists (full-time service only) * Operator Movements RACT soldiers may also be posted to Australian Army Postal service. Vehicles and equipment The Australian Defence Force is currently undergoing a significant vehicle modernisation project, known as LAND 121. LAND 121 is a multi-phase project that aims to deliver more advanced capability that includes hardened and networked vehicles through the inclusion of IED-resistant light armouring combined with advanced GPS Enhanced Position Location Reporting Systems and integrated radio communications. The new vehicles are a significant increase in capability, replacing vehicle fleets that have been in-service since the 1980s.

They rob several small shops, only to find that there is a million deutsche marks in cash in the trunk of their car. As they progress closer to their goal, police along with gangsters start the hot pursuit. Eventually, the two friends find themselves trapped in the middle of a countryside road by police units on one side and gangsters on the other, pointing their guns at each other. The stand- off finally erupts into a big shoot-out while the two make a desperate escape through the corn field. After that, Martin buys a pink Cadillac of the same model as the one which Elvis Presley presented to his mother. His wish is to give the same present to his own mother. As he fulfills the wish, they get ambushed by police near Martin's mother's house. Martin pretends to have a seizure and falls on the ground. He is taken to the hospital in an ambulance with Rudi sitting by his side. En route, Martin and Rudi hijack the vehicle to continue their quest. On the way to the ocean they stop by a brothel, where Rudi wants to fulfil his wish to have sex with two women at the same time. By coincidence, the brothel is owned by the boss whose money they had found in the car they have stolen at the beginning of the journey. They are seen by the two gangsters who were after them throughout their journey. The gangsters take Rudi and Martin to their boss who asks them for money they should return. Martin says that the money was spent and sent to various people which drives the criminal boss insane. Enraged, the boss points a gun at them ready to shoot, but Curtiz, the most influential criminal to whom the money was meant to be delivered, comes in. After a short talk he says ‚ÄúThen you better run, before you run out of time‚Äù. The capo goes on talking about that in heaven everybody would be talking about the ocean. Curtiz spares their lives and lets them go. The film ends as Martin and Rudi arrive at the ocean's shore. They walk to the sandy beach and Martin falls dead on the ground. Rudi imperturbably sits down beside his friend, facing the ocean and watching the surf.

She graduated from Moscow State Academy of Fine Chemical Technology in 1995. In 2008, after a 20-year break from the spotlight, she participated in several film and television projects.  Biography  Natalya Yevgenyevna Guseva was born on February 15, 1971 in Zvenigorod.–ë–∏–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—è –ù–∞—Ç–∞–ª—å—è –ì—É—Å–µ–≤–∞ (–ì—É—Å–µ–≤–∞ –ù–∞—Ç–∞–ª—å—è –ï–≤–≥–µ–Ω—å–µ–≤–Ω–∞) Her father was Evgeni Alexandrovich Gusev, a worker, and her mother was Galina Maksevna Guseva, a physician- therapist.–ù–∞—Ç–∞—à–∞ –ì—É—Å–µ–≤–∞ nashekino.ru In 1979 Natalya went to the first class of the Moscow Secondary School No. 692. In 1983, an assistant from the Gorky Film Studio came to her school, who was looking for children with good diction. Natalya was one of the children selected and received an invitation to a tryout. As a result, her first role was as a schoolgirl in the children's short film Dangeous Trifles (1983), which was made in order to teach children traffic regulations. In this role, she caught the eye of an assistant to Pavel Arsenov, who was looking for a girl to play the role of Alisa Selezneva in the television series Guest from the Future. When meeting Arsenov, Natalya was so excited that when she was asked for her year of birth she mistakenly said 1872 instead of 1972. Her role in the series made Natalya extremely popular, and many Soviet schoolboys fell in love with her, leading to large quantities of fan mail (including from outside the Soviet Union). This phenomenon was known as \\"Alicemania\\" (–ê–ª–∏—Å–æ–º–∞–Ω–∏—è). Natalya was not ready for such fame, and for a while developed a problem with her posture: she walked with her head bowed low so that her fans would not recognize her. She starred in three other films during her career: The Race of the Century (1986), Lilac Ball (1987) and Will of the Universe (1988), but these films did not achieve the success of Guest from the Future. In The Race of the Century her role was relatively minor and episodic, and the film was a box-office failure. Lilac Ball was a sequel to Guest from the Future, but took a darker tone: Natalya again played Alisa Selezneva, but she was 14 years old during filming, and the character had moved on from that in Guest. After this, Natalya's film career came to a close. In 1989 she was offered the main role of Valery Nikolayev in the crime drama Crash ‚Äì Cop's Daughter, but declined the offer as the plot contained many scenes of violence and she did not want to tarnish the image she had created of Alisa Selezneva. She later received several further offers of film roles, but refused them all, as the films contained, as she put it, \\"New Russian\\" scenes. Natalya never intended to become a professional actress, having been fond of biology since childhood and often took many pictures of nature as a child. After graduating from school in 1989, she entered the Moscow State University of Fine Chemical Technologies in the biotechnology department, and graduated in 1994. After graduating she worked for a long time as a scientific researcher at a research institute. Natalya became one of the leaders in a company developing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test systems for the diagnosis of a number of infectious diseases. As of May 2017, she was no longer working, fully devoting herself to her younger daughter and family. In 2007 NTV aired an episode on The Main Hero titled \\"Natasha Guseva: Alice as an Adult\\". It reports on the lives of Natalya and other young actors from Guest from the Future, and considers the significance of the series for the generation of the 1980s, and the cultural phenomenon of \\"Alicemania\\" (–ê–ª–∏—Å–æ–º–∞–Ω–∏—è). In 2009 Natalya returned to the film world for a short while, and voiced a role in the animated film Alice's Birthday. = Personal life = In the autumn of 1987, while in Minsk, she met her future husband, Denis Anatolievich Murashkevich (who had fallen in love with her when seeing her in Guest from the Future). In 1993 they married, and on December 14, 1996 they had a daughter Alesya. Denis had proposed naming the child Zabava (after his mother) or Alice; but Natalya rejected both names. They divorced in 2001, but Natalya retained her husband's surname. A few years after the divorce, Natalya met Sergei Lvovich Ambinder, a designer and employee of the charity fund \\"Rusfond\\", which is headed by his father. They moved in together, and in February 2013 Natalya gave birth to a daughter, Sofya. On July 18 of the same year Natalya and Sergei married.

He was born in Lyvennet Mill, Morland, England. Married Edna Mattern. Father of William LeRoy Hayhurst (born May 25, 1925; died February 27, 2011), Dea Crompton and Grace Lanctot (died August 13, 1998). Hayhurst first ran a seat in the House of Commons of Canada in the 1930 Canadian federal election as a Liberal candidate in the Wetaskiwin district. He was defeated by Incumbent William Irvine, finishing last in a field of three candidates. Hayhurst ran again in the 1935 Canadian federal election, this time under the Social Credit banner in the Vegreville district. Hayhurst's nomination as the Social Credit candidate was controversial. At the time, the Vegreville Social Credit organization had a two-stage nomination process: delegates elected three candidates at a nomination meeting, one of whom was later chosen by an advisory board. Paul Lesiuk, a teacher of Ukrainian background, actually received the greatest number of votes, but the board decided to give the nomination to Hayhurst, the second-place candidate. Many Ukrainian members of Social Credit opposed this decision, and refused to support Hayhurst in the general election.Autobiography of Anthony Hlynka (trans.), printed in Oleh W. Gerus and Denis Hlynka, ed., The Honourable Member for Vegreville: The Memoirs and Diary of Anthony Hlynka, MP, Calgary: University of Calgary Press, 2005, pp 17-19. He narrowly defeated Co-operative Commonwealth Federation incumbent Michael Luchkovich in a hotly contested five-way race. Social Credit had little presence outside Alberta in this period, and Hayhurst sat as an opposition MP. Anthony Hlynka, Hayhurst's successor as MP for Vegreville, described him as a \\"polite, intelligent and well-read\\" man who \\"carried out his duties as an MP quite well, but [...] had a difficult time representing a riding in which eighty per cent of the population was of other than British origin\\". He occasionally made parliamentary statements in support of Ukrainian national aspirations, but had difficulty communicating with his constituents. Many Ukrainian members of the Social Credit party asked him to seek re- election in Athabaska rather than run again in Vegreville in the 1940 federal election. He ignored this advice, and let his name stand at the Vegreville Social Credit nomination meeting in September 1939. The result was an unexpected embarrassment: he finished last in a field of five candidates on the first ballot, and was automatically eliminated.Hlynka, Autobiography, p. 20-21. After his nomination defeat, Hayhurst belatedly decided to seek the Social Credit nomination in Athabaska. He won the nomination, but lost to Liberal Joseph Miville Dechene in the general election. Hayhurst officially appeared on the ballot as the candidate of the New Democracy party, an affiliate of Social Credit. He died in Edmonton in 1975.The Globe and Mail, May 20, 1975, pg. 46 References External links * 1887 births Members of the House of Commons of Canada from Alberta Social Credit Party of Canada MPs New Democracy (Canada) candidates in the 1940 Canadian federal election 1975 deaths ","title":"William Hayhurst"},{"id":"12822254","text":"Avrilly is a former commune in the Eure department in Normandy in northern France.

Conflict resources are natural resources extracted in a conflict zone and sold to perpetuate the fighting.p.8, Conflict and Development: Peacebuilding and Post-conflict Resolution; Sixth Report of Session 2005‚Äì06, Great Britain: Parliament: House of Commons: International Development Committee, The Stationery Office, 2006 There is both statistical and anecdotal evidence that belligerent accessibility to precious commodities can prolong conflicts (a \\"resource curse\\").Philippe Le Billon, \\"Fuelling War: Natural Resources and Armed Conflicts\\", Adelphi Paper 373, IISS & Routledge, 2006.Michael Ross,\\"How Do Natural Resources Influence Civil War? Evidence from Thirteen Cases\\", International Organization, 2004.James Fearon and David lotinakin \\"Ethnicity, Insurgency, and Civil War\\" American Political Science Review, 2003. The most prominent contemporary example has been the eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where various armies, rebel groups, and outside actors have profited from mining while contributing to violence and exploitation during wars in the region. The four most commonly mined conflict minerals (known as 3TGs, from their initials) are cassiterite (for tin), wolframite (for tungsten), coltan (for tantalum), and gold ore, which are extracted from the eastern Congo, and passed through a variety of intermediaries before being purchased. These minerals are essential in the manufacture of a variety of devices, including consumer electronics such as smartphones, tablets, and computers. The extraction and sale of blood diamonds, also known as \\"conflict diamonds\\", is a better-known phenomenon which occurs under virtually identical conditions. Even petroleum can be a conflict resource; ISIS used oil revenue to finance its military and terrorist activities. There have been international efforts to reduce trade in conflict resources, which try to reduce incentives to extract and fight over them. For example, in the United States, the 2010 Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection ActSection 1502, known as the \\"Conflict Mineral Law\\", to be enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission required manufacturers to audit their supply chains and report use of conflict minerals. In 2015 a US federal appeals court struck down some aspects of the reporting requirements as a violation of corporations‚Äô freedom of speech, but left others in place.  History  The concept of 'conflict resource', or 'conflict commodity' emerged in the late 1990s, initially in relation to the 'blood diamonds' that were financing rebellions in Angola and Sierra Leone. Then 'conflict timber' financed hostilities in Cambodia and Liberia. = Conventions = The concept was first officially discussed by the UN General Assembly in the context of 'conflict diamonds':UNGA Resolution 55/56 (2001) The UN Security Council has since referred to conflict resources in several resolutions. Global Witness has called for an international standardized definition to facilitate a more systematic application of UN resolutions, the prevention of complicity in abuses during hostilities by commercial entities exploiting or trading in conflict resources, and the prosecution of war profiteers suspected of supporting or abetting war criminals.\\" Since 1996 the Bonn International Center for Conversion has tracked resource governance and conflict intensity by country.Accessible through Aside from fossil fuels, metals, diamonds, and timber it tracks the governance of other primary goods that might fund conflicts, including: poppy seeds and talc (Afghanistan), rubber (C√¥te d'Ivoire), cotton (Zambia), and cocoa (Indonesia).  Conflict minerals  The four most prominent conflict minerals, for example codified in the U.S. Conflict Minerals Law, are: *Columbite-tantalite (or coltan, the colloquial African term) is the metal ore from which the element tantalum is extracted. Tantalum is used primarily for the production of tantalum capacitors, particularly for applications requiring high performance, a small compact format and high reliability, from hearing aids and pacemakers, to airbags, GPS, ignition systems and anti-lock braking systems in automobiles, through to laptop computers, mobile phones, video game consoles, video cameras and digital cameras. In its carbide form, tantalum possesses significant hardness and wear resistance properties. As a result, it is used in jet engine/turbine blades, drill bits, end mills and other tools. *Cassiterite is the chief ore needed to produce tin, essential for the production of tin cans and the solder on the circuit boards of electronic equipment. Tin is also commonly a component of biocides, fungicides and as tetrabutyl tin/tetraoctyl tin, an intermediate in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and high performance paint manufacturing. *Wolframite is an important source of the element tungsten. Tungsten is a very dense metal and is frequently used for this property, such as in fishing weights, dart tips and golf club heads. Like tantalum carbide, tungsten carbide possesses hardness and wear resistance properties and is frequently used in applications like metalworking tools, drill bits and milling. Smaller amounts are used to substitute lead in \\"green ammunition\\". Minimal amounts are used in electronic devices, including the vibration mechanism of cell phones. *Gold is used in jewelry, investments, electronics, and dental products. It is also present in some chemical compounds used in certain semiconductor manufacturing processes. These are sometimes referred to as \\"the 3T's and gold\\", 3TG, or even simply the \\"3T's\\". Under the US Conflict Minerals Law, additional minerals may be added to this list in the future.  Democratic Republic of the Congo  As of 2010, the conflict resource fueling the world's deadliest war is gold in the Congo. Gold bars are less traceable than diamonds, and gold is abundant in the Kivu conflict region. In any case, no jewellery industry standard exists for verifying gold origination, as it does for diamonds (though jewelers‚Äô total outlay on gold is five times that on diamonds). The 2010-04-19 Responsible Jewellery Council discussion paper proposes a Chain-of-custody system to enable jewellery makers and dealers to trace gold back to its original mine as a \\"Means to avoid ‚Äòconflict‚Äô resources\\", but warns \\"The gold market is much larger and more geographically diversified than diamonds. The gold jewellery market is five times larger than diamonds at first cost\\". Other conflict minerals being illicitly exported from the Congo include cobalt, tungsten, cassiterite, and coltan (which provides the tantalum for mobile phones, and is also said to be directly sustaining the conflict). Armed conflict and mineral resource looting by the Congolese National Army and various armed rebel groups, including the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) and the National Congress for the Defense of the People (CNDP), a proxy Rwandan militia group, has occurred throughout the late 20th century and the early 21st century. Additionally, the looting of the Congo's natural resources is not limited to domestic actors. During the Congo Wars (First Congo War (1996‚Äì1997) and Second Congo War (1998‚Äì2003)), Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi particularly profited from the Congo's resources. These governments continued to smuggle resources out of the Congo to this day. The profits from the sale of these minerals have financed fighting in the Second Congo War and ongoing follow-on conflicts. Control of lucrative mines has also itself become a military objective. = Mines = Mines, in eastern Congo, are often located far from populated areas in remote and dangerous regions. A recent study by International Peace Information Service (IPIS) indicates that armed groups are present at more than 50% of mining sites. At many sites, armed groups illegally tax, extort, and coerce civilians to work. Miners, including children, work up to 48-hour shifts amidst mudslides and tunnel collapses that kill many. The groups are often affiliated with rebel groups, or with the Congolese National Army, but both use rape and violence to control the local population.  United States law  In April 2009, Senator Sam Brownback (R-KS) introduced the Congo Conflict Minerals Act of 2009 (S. 891) to require electronics companies to verify and disclose their sources of cassiterite, wolframite, and tantalum. This legislation died in committee. However, Brownback added similar language as Section 1502 of the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which passed Congress and was signed into law by President Barack Obama on July 21, 2010.\\"New Corporate Social Responsibility Mandate Related to Conflict Materials in the New Financial Reform Bill Could Affect Many Companies \\" (July 20, 2010). Steptoe & Johnson LLP. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) draft regulations to implement the Conflict Mineral Law, published in the Federal Register of December 23, 2010.75 Fed. Reg. 80948 ‚Äì 80975 would have required U.S. and certain foreign companies to report and make public their use of so- called \\"conflict minerals\\" from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries in their products. Comments on this proposal were extended until March 2, 2011.https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2011/34-63793.pdf The comments on the proposal were reviewable by the public. One report on the proposal stated the following statistics for the submitted comments: * Slightly more than 700 comment letters were submitted to SEC on the proposal; * Approximately 65% of those were form letters or basic letters from the general public supporting the rule's intent; * The remaining 35% (roughly 270) represent views of businesses, trade/industry associations, the investment/financial community, professional auditing firms, and other relevant governmental entities; and * Of those 270 comments, an estimated 200 contained substantive and/or technical comments. That report also contained what it calls a \\"preview of the final SEC regulations\\" synthesized from their detailed research and analysis of a large body of documents, reports and other information on the law, proposed regulation and the current budget/political setting facing the SEC in the current administration. The final rule went into effect 13 November 2012.https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2012/34-67716.pdf The SEC rule did not go unnoticed by the international community, including entities seeking to undermine traceability efforts. A report published by a metals trading publication illustrated one DRC ore/mineral flow method that has apparently been devised to thwart detection. On July 15, 2011, the US State Department issued a statement on the subject. Section 1502(c) of the Law mandates that the State Department work in conjunction with SEC on certain elements of conflict minerals policy development and support. On October 23, 2012 U.S. State Dept Officials asserted that ultimately, it falls on the U.S. State Dept. to determine when this rule would no longer apply. In April 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit struck down several parts of the SEC Rules as unconstitutional. = Auditing and reporting requirements = US Conflict Minerals Law contains two requirements that are closely connected: *independent third party supply chain traceability audits * reporting of audit information to the public and SEC. Even companies not directly regulated by the SEC will be impacted by the audit requirements because they will be pushed down through entire supply chains, including privately held and foreign-owned companies. SEC estimated that 1,199 \\"issuers\\" (i.e., companies subject to filing other SEC reports) will be required to submit full conflict mineral reports. This estimate was developed by finding the amount of tantalum produced by the DRC in comparison to global production (15% ‚Äì 20%). The Commission selected the higher figure of 20% and multiplied that by 6,000 (the total number of \\"issuers\\" SEC will be required to do initial product/process evaluations).75 Fed. Reg 80966 This estimate does not account for the companies who supply materials to the \\"issuers\\" (but are not themselves SEC-regulated) but who will almost certainly be required to conduct conflict minerals audits to meet the demands of those customers. Other estimates indicate that the total number of US companies likely impacted may exceed 12,000. A study of the potential impact of the regulation in early 2011 by the IPC ‚Äì Association Connecting Electronic Industries trade association. was submitted with the association's comments to the SEC. The study states that the IPC survey respondents had a median of 163 direct suppliers. Applying that number to the SEC's estimated number of impacted issuers results in the possibility of over 195,000 businesses that could be subject to some level of supply chain traceability effort.  Applicability in general  Under the law, companies have to submit an annual conflict minerals report to the SEC if: *(a) they are required to file reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act of 1934 *(b) conflict minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of a product that they manufacture or contract to be manufactured. That statement contains two separate ‚Äì but critical concepts: the purpose of the conflict mineral in the product/process, and the control that the company exerts over the manufacturing process/specifications. A company would be deemed to contract an item to be manufactured if it: *Exerts any influence over the manufacturing process; or, *Offers a generic product under its own brand name or a separate brand name (regardless of whether the company has any influence over the manufacturing process) and the company contracted to have the product manufactured specifically for itself. This language implied that some retailers who are not manufacturers might be subject to the audit and disclosure requirements. \\"Contracting to manufacture\\" a product requires some actual influence over the manufacturing of process that product, a determination based on facts and circumstances. A company is not to be deemed to have influence over the manufacturing process if it merely: * Affixes its brand, marks, logo, or label to a generic product manufactured by a third party. * Services, maintains, or repairs a product manufactured by a third party. * Specifies or negotiates contractual terms with a manufacturer that do not directly relate to the manufacturing of the product. The proposed regulations attempted to clarify that tools used in assembly and manufacturing will not trigger the law.75 Fed. Reg. 80953 The intent was to cover minerals/metals in the final product only. Nothing specifically addresses intermediate chemical processes that use chemicals that contain conflict minerals.For instance, some electronic components use chemical solutions containing gold at some point in the manufacturing processes. Tin is used during the chemical processes for manufacturing PVC and certain high performance paints/coatings. Additionally, neither the law nor the proposed regulation established a de minimis quantity or other form of materiality threshold that would preclude the applicability of the auditing/reporting requirements.75 Fed. Reg. 80963  Supply chain traceability auditing  The law mandates the use of an \\"independent private sector auditor\\" to conduct the audits. SEC has proposed two different standards for the audits: the \\"reasonable inquiry\\" and the \\"due diligence\\".75 Fed. Reg. 80956 Should the final rule include this structure, the reasonable inquiry would be the first step to determine if the company can on its own, using reasonable efforts and trustworthy information, make a reliable determination as to the source/origin of its tin, tantalum, tungsten and/or gold. Where companies are unable to make such a determination for any reason, they would then be required to take the next step of the \\"due diligence\\", which is the independent private sector audit. The statute specified that the audits be \\"conducted in accordance with standards established by the Comptroller General of the United States, in accordance with rules promulgated by the Commission.\\" This means that the same auditing standards that apply to other SEC auditing requirements will apply to conflict minerals audits Section 1502(b). Because of this language, SEC will have little discretion to allow companies to issue self-generated statements or certifications to satisfy the law. Third party audits for conflict minerals supply chain traceability began in summer 2010 under the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC), a US-based electronics manufacturing trade association. Under this program, EICC selected three audit firms to conduct the actual audits, with two of the three participating in the pilot audits in 2010. After concluding the pilot, one of the two firms involved in 2010 withdrew from the program specifically in response to the SEC's proposal and to reduce potential legal risks to the audited entities. Neither the law nor the proposed regulations provide guidance on what will be considered an acceptable audit scope or process, preferring to allow companies the flexibility meeting the requirement in a manner that is responsive to their own individual business and supply chain.75 Fed. Reg. 80957 At the same time, the law contains a provision that preserves the government's rights to deem any report, audit or other due diligence processes as being unreliable, and in such cases, the report shall not satisfy the requirements of the regulations,Section 1502(b) further emphasizing the need for such audits to conform to established SEC auditing standards. Comments on the proposed regulation pointed out that, should SEC not specify an applicable audit standard, it cannot also be silent or ambiguous on the auditor standards as well, or the Commission will violate the plain language of the Law mandating \\"standards established by the Comptroller General of the United States\\".See numerous comments filed at https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-40-10/s74010.shtml It is generally expected that SEC will provide specificity on both the audit standard and the auditor standard. SEC's proposal attempted to clarify its position on auditor requirements.75 Fed. Reg. 80958 The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published its Guidance on conflict minerals supply chain traceability. This guidance is gaining much momentum as \\"the\\" standard within US policy. However, a recent critical analysis of the standard in comparison to existing US auditing standards under SEC highlighted a number of significant inconsistencies and conflict with relevant US standards. Companies subject to the US law who implement the OECD Guidance without regard for the SEC auditing standards may face legal compliance risks.  Reporting and disclosure  Companies subject to the SEC reporting requirement would be required to disclose whether the minerals used in their products originated in the DRC or adjoining countries (as defined above). The law mandates that this reporting be submitted/made available annually. Many comments to the proposed regulation asked SEC to clarify whether the report must be \\"furnished\\"‚Äîmeaning it is made available to SEC but not directly incorporated within the company's formal financial report‚Äîor \\"submitted\\"‚Äîmeaning the report is directly incorporated into the financial report. At first glance, this may appear to be a minor point; however, this difference is very important in determining the audit/auditor standards and related liabilities. If it is determined that none of the minerals originated in the DRC or adjoining countries, the report must include a statement to that effect and provide an explanation of the country of origin analysis that was used to arrive at the ultimate conclusion. On the other hand, if conflict minerals originating in the DRC or adjoining countries were used (or if it is not possible to determine the country of origin of the conflict minerals used), companies would be required to state as such in the annual report. In either case, companies would also be required to make this information public by posting their annual conflict minerals report on their websites, and providing the SEC with the internet addresses where the reports may be found. Further, the proposed regulations would require companies to maintain records relating to the country of origin of conflict minerals used in their products. Media outlets have reported that many companies required to file Specialized Disclosure Reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and any necessary conflict minerals reports for 2013 under the SEC's conflict minerals rule are struggling to meet the June 2, 2014 report filing deadline. Many impacted companies were hoping for clarification regarding filing requirements, from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from a lawsuit filed by the National Association of Manufacturers. The appellate court's ruling left the necessary conflict minerals reporting requirements largely intact and it has been suggested that impacted companies should review the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance's response to the court's ruling which provides guidance regarding the effect of the appellate court's ruling. On August 18, 2015 the divided D.C. Circuit Court again held the SEC's conflict materials rule violates the First Amendment.National Ass'n of Manufacturers v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 45 ELR 20155, No. 13-5252, (D.C. Cir., 08/18/2015). Senior Circuit Judge A. Raymond Randolph, joined by Senior Circuit Judge David B.

The court next found the required label was controversial because it \\"is a metaphor that conveys moral responsibility for the Congo war.\\" As such, the court struck down the conflict materials rule's disclosure requirements as a violation of corporations‚Äô freedom of speech. Circuit Judge Sri Srinivasan dissented, writing that the required disclosures were not controversial because they were truthful. = Criticism of the law = The law has been criticised for not addressing the root causes of the conflict, leaving to the Congolese government the responsibility for providing an environment in which companies can practice due diligence and legitimately purchase the minerals they need, when the reality is that mechanisms for transparency do not exist. The effect has been to halt legitimate mining ventures that provided livelihoods for people, reducing the Congo's legal exports of tantalum by 90%. An investigation by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that most companies were unable to determine the source of their conflict minerals.SEC CONFLICT MINERALS RULE: Initial Disclosures Indicate Most Companies Were Unable to Determine the Source of Their Conflict Minerals, GAO-15-561: Published: Aug 18, 2015.

Conflict resources in supply chains  Increases in business process outsourcing to globally dispersed production facilities means that social problems and human rights violations are no longer only an organization matter, but also often occur in companies‚Äô supply chains, and challenge for supply chain managers.Hannes Hofmann, Martin C. Schleper, Constantin Blome: Conflict Minerals and Supply Chain Due Diligence: An Exploratory Study of Multitier Supply Chains. In: Journal of Business Ethics. DOI 10.1007/s10551-015-2963-z Besides the harm conflict minerals do where they are produced, human rights violations also raise an enormous risk to corporate reputations. Consumers, mass media and employees expect companies to behave responsibly and have become intolerant of those who don't. Consequently, firms that are located downstream in the supply chain and that are more visible to stakeholders are particularly threatened by social supply chain problems. The recent debate concerning conflict minerals illustrates the importance of social and human rights issues in supply chain management practice as well as the emerging need to react to social conflicts. Conflict minerals are processed in many different components throughout various industries and hence have a high overall impact on business. Initiatives like the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk AreasOECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict- Affected and High-Risk Areas demand that supply chain managers verify purchased goods as ‚Äò‚Äòconflict-free‚Äô‚Äô or implement measures to better manage any inability to do so. Minerals mined in Eastern Congo pass through the hands of numerous middlemen as they are shipped out of Congo, through neighboring countries such as Rwanda or Burundi, to East Asian processing plants. Because of this, the US Conflict Minerals Law applies to materials originating (or claimed to originate) from the DRC as well as the nine adjoining countries: Angola, Burundi, Central African Republic, Republic of Congo, Rwanda, South Sudan, Zimbabwe, Uganda, and Zambia. Firms have begun to apply governance mechanisms to avoid adverse effects of conflict mineral sourcing. However, the mere transfer of responsibilities upstream in the supply chain apparently will not stop the trade with conflict minerals, notably due to two reasons: *On the one hand, globalization has created governance gaps in a sense that companies are able to abuse human rights without being sanctioned by independent third parties. This gap results in a non-allocation of responsibility that makes the problem of human rights abuses and social conflicts within dispersed supply chains very likely to endure, particularly without collaborative approaches to remedy these deficiencies. *On the other hand, conflict minerals usually originate from globally diverse deposits and are difficult to track within components and manufactured products. This is the case because they are mixed with minerals of different origin and added to metal alloys. Consequently, although the share of these minerals in single end products may be negligible, they are prevalent in numerous products and commodities. Together, these circumstances leave downstream firms nearly incapable of detecting risks associated with conflict minerals. Hence, the topic of conflict minerals becomes one of supply chain management rather than of individual companies‚Äô legal or compliance divisions alone. What is needed is effective and supply- chain wide-mechanisms of traceability and due diligence that allow firms to take individual and collective responsibility as parts of supply chains. In the context of mineral supply chains, due diligence represents a holistic concept that aims at providing a chain of custody tracking from mine to export at country level, regional tracking of mineral flows through the creation of a database on their purchases, independent audits on all actors in the supply chain, and a monitoring of the whole mineral chain by a mineral chain auditor. In this sense, due diligence transcends conventional risk management approaches that usually focus on the prevention of direct impacts on the core business activities of companies. Moreover, due diligence focuses on a maximum of transparency as an end itself while risk management is always directed towards the end of averting direct damages. However, besides the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the OECD Guidance, there is still a gap in due diligence practices as international norms are just emerging. Studies found that the motivation for supply chain due diligence as well as expected outcomes of these processes vary among firms. Furthermore, different barriers, drivers, and implementation patterns of supply chain due diligence have been identified in scholarly research.  Organizations and activists involved  A number of organizations and celebrities working to find solutions and raise awareness of conflict minerals. These include: * Save the Congo * The Enough Project * Partnership Africa Canada * The Conflict Free Tin Initiative * Solutions for Hope * Raise Hope for Congo * Stand Canada * Conflictminerals.org * Congo Siasa * ReliefWeb * Ashley Judd * Ryan Gosling * Southern Africa Resource Watch Moreover, FairPhone Foundation raises awareness of conflict minerals in the mobile industry and is a company which tries to produce a smart phone with 'fair' conditions along the supply chain. Various industry and trade associations are also monitoring developments in conflict minerals laws and traceability frameworks. Some of these represent electronics, retailers, jewelry, mining, electronics components, and general manufacturing sectors. One organization ‚Äì ITRI (a UK-based international non- profit organization representing the tin industry and sponsored/supported by its members, principally miners and smelters.) had spearheaded efforts for the development and implementation of a \\"bag and tag\\" scheme at the mine as a key element of credible traceability.An overview and timeline of ITRI's activities on conflict minerals can be seen here ‚Äì The program and related efforts were initially not likely to extend beyond the pilot phase due to a variety of implementation and funding problems that occurred. In the end however, the device did enter the market. In late March 2011, the UK government launched an informational section on its Foreign & Commonwealth Office website dedicated to conflict minerals. This information resource is intended to assist British companies in understanding the issues and, specifically, the US requirements. On Jan 6th 2014, the semiconductor giant Intel announced that it would distance itself from conflict minerals. As a result, all Intel microprocessors henceforth will be conflict-free.  Commercial reporting solutions  Manufacturers and supply chain partners needing to comply with the ever- increasing reporting regulations have a few commercial options available. A major research report from November 2012 by the Southern Africa Resource Watch revealed that gold miners in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo were being exploited by corrupt government officials, bureaucrats and security personnel, who all demand illegal tax, fees and levies from the miners without delivering any services in return. Despite the alleged gold rush in regions of the country, none of the population and workforce is benefiting from this highly lucrative industry.

Formed by Jordan Thompson, they are one of the only old school punk bands active from Anaheim, and known for bridging the sound between 70s Punk rock, soul, and classic rock and roll.Caustic Truths, Magazine Issue No. 104 Page 23  History  The Scarred formed in 2003 by Justin \\"Scarred\\" James, Matt \\"Monkey\\" Hatcher, Isha Rose and Jordan Thompson. The three had been in bands before and quickly set to work playing live shows with such Punk Rock notables as Naked Aggression, The Adicts, Menace, Cheap Sex, The Skeptix, and more. After starting a family, Isha stepped down and was replaced by Ben 9000, drummer of other notable bands such as Rezurex and Jeffree Star. =Repression= The band recorded a demo in the back room of a radio station, and sent it out to underground fanzines, where it quickly received good reviews, including California's legendary MRR.MaximumRockNRoll, Magazine Issue No. 253100 Punks Zine, December 2004 Issue. Capitalizing on their good reviews, the band decided to record a full-length album and entered 459 Audio studios in Monrovia, California to record their debut album. In February 2004, the band finally released their first album, Repression, before heading out on their first U.S. Tour. Over the next year they toured the country relentlessly,Skratch, Magazine issue No. 123 quickly selling out the thousand copies of their debut CD and gaining some attention in the Punk mediaPunk Planet Magazine issue No. 62NoFrontTeeth Magazine, UK, October 2004 Issue and Web FeatureSkratch Magazine Issue No. 98 not only for their albums, but for their live show.Skratch Magazine, Issue No. 101 The quick sales of Repression led to the band entering the studio to record a split seven-inch with New Jersey punk band Void Control. It was released in early 2005, quickly earning the band more good reviews.Slug & Lettuce, Issue No. 83MaximumRockNRoll Magazine No. 267 August, 2005 The split-EP was also released on limited Coke bottle Green colored Vinyl, which sold out immediately and has since become difficult to find. =No Solution= In August 2005, the band was offered a record deal with a New York street-punk label. According to the band, they were thrilled to receive the offer, as they were in debt, on the verge of bankruptcy, and would have had no other option but to end the band.Loud, Fast, Rules! Magazine, The Scarred Feature, Issue No. 3Skratch Magazine Issue No. 115 At the urging of the label, The Scarred quickly rushed to a rent-by-the- hour practice studio in downtown Anaheim and had a live set of three songs recorded by filmmaker Lewis Smithingham, who included it in Punk Core records' first DVD, Pure Punk Rock which was released March 7, 2006. Unfortunately, the master copy of the DVD had been scratched over the Scarred's set, causing the audio and video on the last segments to skew. Justin would later comment that they regretted recording for the DVD at all, due to the rushed and comparatively low quality of their segment, but that they were honored to be included and featured alongside The Casualties, The Virus, and Defiance, among others. According to the Spring 2006 Edition of Loud, Fast, Rules! magazine, the band had been recording songs over the last nine months one session at a time as budget allowed. With Punk Core's help, they were able to finish the album in December 2005, at which point it was set for release in April, 2006. After an October tour, which included both the debut of new rhythm guitar player Andy White of KTP, and also his dismissal after the tour was over, the band set out on their second Clampdown U.S. tour with friends and Los Angeles street-punk locals, Destruct. The date of their Washington, DC show was canceled due to a stabbing at the venue the previous night, but on April 4, 2006 The Scarred's second album No Solution was released in stores. The album was received with good reviews from the United States and Europe.Under the Volcano No. 91Read Magazine Editor's Choice April/May 2006Loud, Fast, Rules!

The Scarred took two weeks off before heading out to support what would be Cheap Sex's final tour. On tour the shows did well, but was plagued by conflict within the tour that would signal the eventual breakup of Cheap Sex.Dead Today: V Years of Cheap Sex, DVD (Taang No. 194, 2009) The Scarred's drummer, Isha, was also pregnant the entire tour with her and husband and singer Justin Willits' first child.AMP No. 38 =2007 - 2008= At the end of the tour, The Scarred released cover artwork from their forthcoming record, only to cancel recording sessions after 6 songs due to fatigue and lack of funds from the label. They played only a few shows during the remainder of Isha's pregnancy, including one with Cheap Sex's drummer Gabe at the Allen Theatre. Their baby was born on March 21, 2007, and The Scarred announced via Myspace that they would be returning to work soon, starting with the third annual Clampdown Tour in June and July 2007, which would feature Brad Jamison of Vengeance 77 on the drums while Isha was still recovering. However, despite fans eagerly expecting their arrival, an accident forced The Scarred to drop off the tour the day before their departure, as Vocals/Guitar player Justin Willits broke his leg at the last practice. After several months of healing, The Scarred recruited Ben 9000 on drums, announced a fall 2007 tour, and posted several Studio Updates on YouTube.com. As fate would have it, the tour proved disastrous. Not only did several winter storms force cancellations of many of the tour's shows, but the band quickly ran out of money. After breaking down 4 weeks into a 7-week tour, the band was forced to return home. Isha returned to the drums in 2008 and the original lineup seemed poised to make a comeback and finish their delayed third album, the band learned that PunkCore records had gone inactive, leaving their album unfinished. Complicating things further, bass player Matt \\"Monkey\\" Hatcher relocated to Ferndale, Washington as the band released a limited 4-song digital EP, titled \\"Panic!\\" featuring three songs from what would have been their sophomore punkcore album, and one song with drummer Ben 9000 of Rezurex.

Heading into the studio in March 2009, The Scarred laid down basic tracks in four days, including flying down original bass player Matt \\"Monkey\\" Hatcher for the record. Recording continued in the kitchen of Justin Scarred's Long Beach apartment for all the vocals, and the tracks were quickly mixed, mastered, and sent off to press, released in July 2009 as \\"At Half Mast.\\" At this time, drummer Isha Rose bowed out due to tendonitis as a result of injury, seeing tour drummer Ben 9000 become The Scarred's permanent drummer. The band quietly recruited Byron Sinn, who had played in Prima Donna and Destruct, to fill the void while Monkey worked on his legal issues. After filling the second half of 2009 with small club shows which received great reviews, the band recruited Nathanael Felon from Fresno, California's \\"The Martyrs\\" to fill out the lineup on rhythm guitar. =2010 and on= With a live lineup tested and in place, in January 2010 frontman Justin Scarred surprised fans by announcing he would spend the year concentrating writing a brand new album, while the other band members take 2010 to tour with their respective bands, and Ben 9000 drums for controversial pop-figure Jeffree Star on his world tour. In late March 2010, media sources announced that The Scarred would be playing an unknown limited number of East Coast tour dates sponsored by DNA Energy Drink with Florida punk rock band \\"The New Threat.\\" As of April 15, 2010, according to the band's Myspace calendar, dates are scheduled for July 8‚Äì20, 2010.'Dying Scene' front page, March 29, 2010Philadelphia Examiner, March 30, 2010 edition Permanent hiatus From 2013, The Scarred are on a permanent hiatus.

The telenovela lasted for 126 episodes and was distributed internationally by RCTV International. Astrid Carolina Herrera starred as the main antagonist with Chantal Baudaux and Juan Carlos Garc√≠a as the main protagonists. Plot A dark secret which was securely kept hidden after all these years, connects six friends, heiress Altagracia del Toro, her best friend, Juaca; her other friends Ricarda; Marina; Chichita and Laura. One fateful day, Altagracia will marry a man named Julian Morera for money and to spite her father. On the same day, a man tries to rape her friend, Laura in the basement of the wine distilleries owned by Altagracia's family. Her friends accidentally kill him in the impulse of anger. The girls realize too late what they had done. They are shocked to see their parish priest, Padre Sebastian witness their crime. He asks them to report what happened to the police, but they reject the idea. Padre Sebastian departs. Then the friends agreed to hide the corpse inside a wall, each of them leaving the basement in search for the priest, fearing, that he will tell the police. But when Altagracia found him, he was already dead inside the confession box of the church and with that she was incarcerated for that crime. 20 years later, Altagracia, now given the infamous nickname \\"La Mujer de Judas\\", was released from prison much to public outrage from the townspeople of Carora. An aspiring reporter Gloria Leal along with her friends from the university is trying to find a subject for their documentary which is their final requirement before graduation. Gloria was attracted to uncover the mystery of \\"La Mujer de Judas\\" and wants to uncover if Altagracia was innocent all along. The idea was met by anger by Gloria's mother, Juaca, but Gloria cannot be stopped. She befriended the Officer in Charge of Del Toro winery, Salomon. As days pass, they became more attracted to each other. As Gloria and her friends try to uncover the secrets of the past, a mysterious figure dressed in a wedding dress hiding behind a skull mask starts to terrorize the town. The figure earns the name \\"La Mujer de Judas\\". Altagracia was immediately blamed by the townspeople but the police realize that there is no evidence linking Altagracia to this mysterious figure.

Note: One might think that double- decker coaches are designated as (e.g.) K 440 ED6x2*4NI. But they still use K EB for some reason. Engines When introduced, the K series was available with Euro IV-compliant 8.9-litre (8867 cc) 5-cylinder engines (DC9) with output of 230 hp (1050 Nm), 270 hp (1250 Nm) and 310 hp (1550 Nm) as well as the 11.7-litre (11705 cc) 6-cylinder engines (DC12) with output of 340 hp (1700 Nm), 380 hp (1900 Nm), 420 hp (2100 Nm) or 470 hp (2200 Nm), the latter being a DT12 turbo-compound engine. For the 5- and 6-cylinder engines Scania is using exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems to fulfill the legal Euro emission standards. In 2008 Scania released upgraded Euro V engines in order to meet these regulations. The 5-cylinder DC9 (later DC09) engines featured a larger bore and displace 9.3-litres (9291 cc) instead of 8.9-litres. The new DC13 engines feature both a larger bore and a longer stroke and therefore displace 12.7-litres (12742 cc) instead of 11.7-litres. Some engines also received slight performance improvements, for example the DC9 engine that outputs 310 hp (1550 Nm) was upgraded to 320 hp (1600 Nm). With the introduction of Euro VI engines in 2013, the DC09 outputs 250 hp (1250 Nm), 280 hp (1400 Nm), 320 hp (1600 Nm) and 360 hp (1700 Nm), while the DC13 outputs 410 hp (2150 Nm), 450 hp (2350 Nm) and 490 hp (2550 Nm).Scania at Busworld 2013 in Kortrijk, Belgium Scania 17 October 2013 Euro III, IV and V engines are still available for export markets. For alternative fuels, the 9.3-litre was available as the OC9 CNG engine with power outputs of 270 hp (1100 Nm) and 305 hp (1250 Nm), which from the introduction of Euro VI was replaced by the OC09 with power outputs of 280 hp (1350 Nm) and 340 hp (1600 Nm). The 8.9-litre is available as the ethanol fueled DC9 E02 with a power output of 270 hp (1200 Nm).

A total of 60 units has been purchased. The buses have restyled front and rear as well as a newly developed driver's place. =New Zealand= In New Zealand, several operators have Scania K-series UB urban buses. Because of the additional weight of the 9-litre engine compared to the 7-litre units offered by other manufacturers, many (though not all) Scania urban buses are specified as 6x2 rather than 4x2. This helps reduce the operator's liability for road user charges, which are calculated by vehicle weight. Scania K-series urban buses may have tag axles at lengths where buses of other makes would not, e.g. NZ Bus's 2100 and 2200 series at approximately 12.0 m and only 42 seats. Scania K-series urban buses pioneered steerable tag axles in New Zealand, which became a requirement for buses between 12.6 m and 13.5 m in length. Because Scania K-series buses had a longer rear overhang than competing makes, the allowable overhang with a steerable tag axle was increased from 4.25 m to 4.5 m. The Scania K280 UB 6x2*4 and K320 UB 6x2*4 have been popular chassis for operators building high-capacity single-deck buses. New Zealand's first double-deck bus in regular urban service was a Gemilang-bodied Scania K310 UD 6x2*4. =Singapore= SBS Transit SBS Transit currently operates the largest fleet of Scania K-series buses in Singapore, with a total of 1,101 Scania K230UBs.

His brother, William Henry Cushing, was a mayor of Calgary, while another brother, Alfred Cushing, served as alderman in that city. Biography Cushing was born in Kenilworth, Ontario February 10, 1869. He was educated at Essec High School, and earned a B.A. from the University of Toronto in 1898. He moved to Edmonton in 1900 to manage his brother's lumber business. In 1902 he became manager of the Edmonton branch of Cushing Bros. Ltd., which he would manage until retiring in 1927. The same year, he married Annie Nelson, with whom he would have five children. He first ran for office in the 1902 municipal election, when he finished third of five candidates in the race for alderman and was therefore one of three elected to the Edmonton Town Council for a two year term. At the expiration of his term, at the 1904 election he chose to run for the public school board rather than seeking re-election as alderman. He was elected, and served for one year before running for mayor in the 1905 election. He was defeated by Charles May, and took a hiatus from politics. He returned for the 1909 election, when he was again elected to the public school board, finishing first of seven candidates. He did not run for re-election at the conclusion of his two year term, devoting himself to the construction of a new factory in 1911. He was again elected to the board in the 1917 election, finishing third of seven candidates, but again declined to seek re-election after serving his two year term. In the 1927 election, newly retired from his business, Arthur Cushing returned for a third and final stint as a school trustee. He was re-elected in the 1929 and 1931 elections. He did not seek re- election when his last term ended in 1933. Cushing also served as the president of the Edmonton Board of Trade (now the Edmonton Chamber of Commerce) and the Edmonton Public Hospital. He died in Vancouver on March 26, 1944.

Early life Arto Der Haroutunian was born in 1940 in Aleppo, Syria to Armenian parents. His father, a survivor of the Armenian Genocide, was from the predominantly Armenian-populated region of Cilicia within the Ottoman Empire. In 1952, the Der Haroutunian family settled in the north west of England where his father was head of the Armenian Apostolic Church. Arto qualified as an architect, having studied at Manchester University. He established his career designing restaurants, clubs and hotels. The Der Haroutunian family moved to Beirut, Lebanon for a few years before in 1952 settling in Manchester in North West England when his father was sent as a priest to the Armenian Church there. Their home was the rectory attached to the church. When 18 Arto went to Manchester University to study architecture. There he met his future wife Frances who was studying geography. They married in 1967 and Arto qualified as an architect and set up his own practice in 1970. In 1976 their son Raffi was born. Food played a major role in the family's life although it was a terrific shock when they first arrived in grey and austere Britain from colourful and plentiful Lebanon to find many of the fruits and vegetables they were used to were very difficult if not impossible to find. Arto's mother was a fantastic cook and the rectory was an open house for any Armenian students and visitors in Manchester. Hospitality was always guaranteed and it was nothing for 12 or more people to sit down for Sunday lunch after the church service. Restaurateur Arto and his brother Koko, a civil engineer, felt that the 'traditional' Greek-Cypriot food served to the public in Britain at that time was a poor reflection of the true Middle Eastern cuisine and they decided to open a genuine Armenian restaurant in Manchester. In 1970 he opened an Armenian restaurant in Manchester with his brother Koko. This developed into a successful chain of restaurants and hotels. It opened in 1969. Designed by Arto its simple modern style and rich colours was in stark contrast to that of most of the ethnic eating places of the time. It was a style for which he became well-known and his architectural practise came to specialise in hotel, club and restaurant design including ones in Manchester and Leeds for the Mario and Franco chain. To begin with family and friends were roped in to help run the restaurant. Arto's mother and wife worked in the kitchen while the brothers took charge of front of house. Later his cousins came to help. The restaurant became a tremendous success and led to the opening of a second Armenian restaurant in London. This became a magnet for food writers like Elizabeth David, visiting performers like jazz pianist Oscar Petersen and Soviet poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko and the Middle East writer David Marshall Lang. It was also a meeting place for a large number of Armenians, both local and visiting, all looking for good food, company and conversation for example the singer Charles Aznavour, writer William Saroyan, actor Kevork Malikyan and conductors and composers Loris Tjeknavorian and Aram Khatchaturian the latter acting as godfather to Arto's son Raffi. Over the following years the brothers opened four more restaurants, two hotels and a night club. After thirteen years of producing mainly Middle Eastern food it was a natural progression that he should then begin to write cookery books as they combined his love of food with his great interest in the history and culture of the region. It was his belief that the rich culinary tradition of the Middle East is the main source of many of our western cuisines and his books were intended as an introduction to that tradition. Writing It was a natural progression that he should then begin to write on Middle Eastern food. The cookery books combined his love of food with his great interest in the history and culture of the whole region. He wrote twelve cookery books in total, several of which were translated into foreign languages. He also contributed articles to many magazines and TV and radio shows. His books are mini-histories of peoples and cultures. The recipes are interspersed with historical facts, proverbs, folk wisdoms, poems and anecdotes. Each book is a good read and acts as a taster for the various regions communicating the flavour of life and the philosophy behind the preparing and eating of traditional foods while at the same time encouraging the reader to try the food either at home or in a restaurant. He also contributed articles on food to many magazines. In addition to his own writing he also translated Turkish, Arab, Persian and Armenian authors. Art Arto started painting in 1963 after being goaded into it by an artist friend. He converted the coal cellars of the rectory into a studio and within six months had produced seventy paintings. The first article about his art appeared in 1965 in \\"The Idiom\\" an arts magazine produced at the University. At the time he was having his first one-man exhibition at the Manchester Central Library and it was transferred to the Student's Union afterwards. Without the \\"benefits\\" of a formal art school training his paintings possess an individuality which is entirely his own. Over the years Arto succeeded in fusing his two backgrounds of East and West into a new and personal style. He was a master of line and colour. His architectural training is evident in the linear aspect of his works. His pictures are full of sinuous lines which flow across the canvasses creating shapes, spaces and depths without much recourse to perspective so showing the influence of ancient Armenian manuscripts. Primarily though he was a colourist and he has said \\"I am from a warm country. Colours are brighter in the Middle East because of the sun. I don't have theories about colour, I follow instinct. My colour has modified though ‚Äì it has been toned down by the British weather!\\" Arto exhibited both in the north and south of England as well as abroad. Along the way he struck up friendships with fellow northern artists Colin Jelicoe, Geoffrey Key, John Picking and Emanuel Levy. His works are in several private collections in Britain and abroad as well as in galleries in Armenia, Syria, Lebanon and Nigeria. Each painting can be distinguished by his distinctive signature which combines his first name in English and Armenian. Arto was devoted to Armenia, its people and its heritage and he visited his Armenian homeland for the first time in 1978 when he was invited to attend the 2nd International Symposium on Armenian Art where he was a guest speaker and presented a lecture on the Armenian Castle of Azqit. On his return he wrote a book of poems \\"From the Future to the Past\\" in response to that highly emotional visit. The poems tell of his thoughts and experiences before, during and after his visit. Arto's first love was music, but owing to family and financial pressures he studied architecture instead. However, shortly before he died he had started to attend music composition classes at the Northern College of Music in the little spare time he had. Death Der Haroutunian died of a sudden heart attack in 1987 at the age of 47. He is survived by his wife Frances, their son and grandson.

It was planned and first built by Christian IV to accommodate a need for housing for the personnel of the rapidly growing Royal Danish Navy and their families during that time. While the area is still commonly associated with the name of its founder as one of his numerous building projects around Copenhagen, the Nyboder seen today was in fact, except for a single row of houses in St. Paulsgade, built from 1757. Nyboder is today very much associated with their yellow colour and \\"Nyboder yellow\\" is in Danish often used as a generic term to refer to their exact hue of yellow. However, the original colour of the development was red and white. History =Christian IV's Nyboder= King Christian IV and Hans van Steenwinckel the Younger painted together 1638 with Rosenborg Castle in the background, not far from their Nyboder development Plan of Nyboder (north is right) Under Christian IV the Royal Danish Navy grew rapidly and there was an urgent need for suitable accommodation for its personnel and their families. Bremerholm already offered similar housing for naval officers, these were the old houses referred to by implication in Nyboder's name, so now the new barracks were to house common sailors and other private personnel. The new development was planned on land outside Copenhagen previously acquired by the king with the intention to expand the fortified city northwards. This had still not happened but Saint Anne's Post, later to develop into Kastellet, had already been constructed a little further north. Construction of Nyboder was commenced in 1631. The area was laid out around two main streets radiating from a planned square which was never established. The rows were oriented perpendicularly to these streets. The architects assisting the King were Hans van Steenwinckel the Younger and later Leonhard Blasius. Christian IV's Nyboder was completed around 1641. =Absorption by the city= In 1647, one year before Christian IV's death, Nyboder was definitively absorbed by the fortified city when the Eastern City Gate is moved, yet much of its surroundings still awaited redevelopment. Just north of Nyboder lay a piece of undeveloped land known as Greenland (Danish: Gr√∏nland). On 16 December 1658 a gunpowder magazine just north of Nyboder exploded, damaging or demolishing many houses and causing numerous casualties. In 1668 Copenhagen's gallows were moved from its previous location, at the site where Kongens Nytorv would be laid out a few years later, to Greenland. In 1677, Nyboder saw another bleak neighbour when the Stocks House was built a little to the south. St. Paul's, visible in the background. Today the view of the church is obstructed by buildings =Guard and jailhouse= From its early days, the Nyboder area included a guardhouse which was replaced by a new building in the 1780s. It had an external bell which was used to gather people in the event of a military attack or fire. The building also houses the Nyboder barracks' own guard and contained a jail, where trouble-making residents were deposited. =Expansion of the Nyboder= In 1695 a commission considers to move part of the naval personnel to the island of M√∏n, due to lack of space in the crowded city which is still not allowed to develop beyond its fortifications but it never happens. When the Frederiksholm islet is created by a series of Land reclamation, the intention is to use it for new naval barracks but again the plans are not carried out. In the end it was decided to build new houses at Nyboder and the expansion would continue for the next 40 years. In 1756 24 two-storey houses designed by Philip de Lange were built and while later extensions would be directed by other architects, it continued to be to his initial design. In 1771 some of Christian IV's original rows were extended with an extra storey by Anthon and Harsdorff. From 1781-96 another app. 150 houses were built. A guard house (1787) and five officer's houses were also added to the area during the same period. Between 1853 and 1878 half of Nyboder was sold off and demolished. Nyboder today Nyboder still house enlisted personnel of the Danish Navy, Army and Air Force but the housing is also open to civilian applicants and since 2006 priority is no longer given to military personnel. It has several times been proposed to sell the houses and use the proceeds for various purposes, including investments in improved infrastructure in Copenhagen, but so far it has been rejected. In 2009 the A. P. M√∏ller Foundation made a donation of DKK 50 million for a refurbishment of some of the houses. St. Paul's Church Nyboder's Church From 1872 to 1877 St. Paul's Church was built to the design of Johannes Emil Gnudtzmann in the middle of the Nyboder area and it is often referred to as Nyboder's Church. It is built in red brick and the masonry is decorated with blinds, arches, columns. and pinnacles on all corners. Nyboder's school Nyboder School is located at 15 √òster Voldgade. Monuments =Edouard Suenson Memorial= The Edouard Suenson Memorial At Store Kongensgade, in front of Nyboder, there is a memorial to Vice Admiral Edouard Suenson who commanded the Danish ships in the Battle of Heligoland 9 May 1864. The monument was designed by Theobald Stein and inaugurated on 9 May 1889. The monument consists of a bust of Suenson mounted on a high plinth decorated with a laurel wreath and prows. On its front side, it has the inscription: \\"VICE-ADMIRAL/EDOUARD SUENSON/Vorn 13 APRIL 1805/DIED 16 MAY 1887 The foot of the plinth is guarded by bronze lions which hold a coat of arms with the inscription \\"HELGOLAND/9 MAY/1864\\". =Christian IV statue= On the corner of Kronprinsessegade and √òster Voldgade, there is a bronze statue of Christian IV, the founder of the area, standing on a granite plinth. The statue was designed by Vilhelm Bissen and inaugurated in 1900.

Born in BournemouthThere are conflicting sources that state Belfitt was born in Doncaster and the family lived in South Africa and India before settling in Doncaster where he later played football for amateur side Doncaster United. After a short period at Arsenal he returned to Doncaster United. Later, after signing for another amateur team Retford Town, Belfitt turned professional in July 1963 signing for Leeds United then managed by Don Revie. Leeds United Belfitt made his first team debut at Huddersfield on 23 September 1964 scoring the winning goal. With several Leeds forwards injured Belfitt was given a six- game run in the first team where he scored three times before being dropped by Don Revie. Appearances were limited until the 1966/67 season when he became a regular in February 1967. A European Cup semi-final first-leg game against Kilmarnock saw Belfitt scoring three goals in the opening 30 minutes in a 4‚Äì2 victory. Belfitt appeared in the goalless second leg and the two-legged final 0‚Äì2 defeat by Dynamo Zagreb. Although he saw more football the following season including a substitute appearance in the 1968 Football League Cup Final against Arsenal. The following season (1968/9) Leeds won the league title but Belfitt was restricted to eight appearances (two of which were as substitute) but his three goals secured vital victories against Ipswich Town and Sunderland. Belfitt made even fewer appearances in 1969/70 with only a single league and two cup goals in 11 appearances. During 1970/1 Belfitt played more often with ten starts and 11 appearances as substitute yielding four goals. Injuries to Mick Jones and Allan Clarke saw Belfitt picked regularly but scoring just one goal in 16 appearances. He was dropped when Jones returned but following another injury a week later, Belfitt was not picked and promptly handed in a transfer request being signed by Bobby Robson at Ipswich Town for ¬£55,000. Belfitt's last game was as a substitute away to Manchester United on 30 October 1971 (his 26th birthday). During his 8 years at Leeds Belfitt scored 17 goals from 75 league appearances with a further 16 cup goals from 53 games. Ipswich Town Belfitt was successful from the start, scoring in his first two games for his new club (against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 6 November 1971 and Crystal Palace) and finished the season as equal leading scorer with 7 goals in 26 games equal with Mick Hill. Belfitt made a fine start to the following season with a goal against his old club Leeds featuring amongst them. A ninth goal was scored in a 2‚Äì2 draw at Everton on 28 October impressing manager Harry Catterick to make an offer for the striker. Belfitt moved to Merseyside on 30 October 1972, his 27th birthday, with David Johnson making the move from Everton in the opposite direction. Belfitt was valued at ¬£65,000 in this deal. Belfitt scored a total of 19 goals in 46 league and cup games for Ipswich. Everton Before Belfitt's move to Everton, he was invited to play for the Civil Service first eleven after a disappointing goal return from their attack. Belfitt's first game for Everton was away in a 1‚Äì0 defeat by Crystal Palace followed by a home game where he scored against Manchester City although Everton lost 3‚Äì2. Belfitt is possibly unique in scoring two consecutive goals for different teams in consecutive Everton home games having scored for Ipswich. After 17 games and three goals Belfitt as sold to Sunderland by new manager Billy Bingham for ¬£70,000. Sunderland Belfitt spent a year at Sunderland scoring four goals in 24 appearances. His lack of goals is partly explained by being deployed with some success at centre half. Within a year Belfitt was transfer listed and in November 1974 spent a brief period on loan at Fulham scoring a single goal in six games. Belfitt was transferred in February 1975 to Huddersfield Town managed by former Leeds United teammate Bobby Collins. Huddersfield Town Belfitt had joined a struggling Third Division side and was unable to help them stave off relegation to the Fourth Division (then the bottom tier of the Football League). He scored eight goals in 34 appearances before moving to non-league football in June 1975. After playing amateur football for Worksop Town, Frickley Athletic and Bentley Victoria, Belfitt worked as a draughtsman and a financial adviser.

It is one of 21 major tributaries of Laguna de Bay and is the more southern of two small rivers that hem the town proper of Bay. The other is the Calo River (), another Laguna de Bay tributary, to the north. In geographical terms, these two rivers created the main area of the town of Bay by leaving many centuries' worth of alluvial deposits in the lower section of the plain close to Laguna de Bay. Over time, that plain was selected by the earliest settlers of Bay as the site of their community because the access to the lake meant easy transportation and ready access to a water source. The downside to this choice of location was regular flooding. Residents still recall that when the two rivers overflowed their banks, the poblacion and six other barangays would be flooded. However, this rarely happens today because an irrigation system consisting of canals and ditches which bring water from these rivers into the ricefields have reduced the force of the waters. The Bay River forms Bay's boundary with Calauan, Laguna. A third river on the opposite side of the town, the Maitem River (), forms Bay's boundary with Los Ba√±os, Laguna.

Thompson attended his first Summer Olympics in 1980 in Moscow and was part of the small New Zealand team of just four athletes that attended that year, as most western athletes stayed away due to the boycott that year. Thompson won three medals at the ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships with two silvers (K-1 1000 m and K-2 500 m: both 1982), and a bronze (K-1 1000 m: 1983).

It is located deep in the Assin Gorge between the auls of Khairakh and Puy, Dzheyrakhsky District, near the border with Georgia. The monument is protected by the State as part of the Dzheirakh-Assin historical and architectural museum and nature reserve. History and architecture The building was first described in 1781 by a Russian army officer St√§der known for the accounts of his North Caucasian travels. From the 1880s on, the monument became a subject of study by several Russian, Georgian and Ingush scholars. From 1969 to 1971, a team of Georgian and Ingush specialists led by the architect L. Khimshiashvili and archaeologist G. Ghambashidze carried out a substantial research in the area and reconstructed the church for further conservation. The expedition also offered a novel interpretation of the church‚Äôs name. Instead of the hitherto commonly accepted translation as \\"a church of the Holy Two Thousands\\", the scholars now suggested that the name might have been derived from the name of St. Thomas. According to the evidence the earliest structures of Tkhaba-Yerdy dates back before 8th-9th centuries when it was remodeled . The temple seems to have been completely remodeled during the reign of Queen Tamar of Georgia (r. 1184-1213), and restructured for the last time in the 15th-16th centuries. Originally, the church was a three-nave basilica typical to medieval Georgian architecture , but several elements of the native tradition of mountainous Ingushetia were later introduced by its rebuilders. Although eventual Islamization of the region made the church defunct, it remained a place where the Ingush clansmen gathered to discuss common matters such as raids against enemies, peace-making, and to hold various celebrations. The extant edifice is not oriented strictly to the east, but is considerably deviated to the north. The interior is divided by three tall arcades into four unequal sectors. The church retains the fragments of relief sculpture of the fa√ßades and ornate details of cornices and arches. A piece of the inscription in Georgian has also survived. The Tkhaba-Yerdy Church is one of the four monuments of Ingushetia classified as having a federal importance. The other three are: Alby-Yerdy Church, and the Islamic mausoleums of Borga-Kash and Myatsel. Army controversy The area around the church became a training ground of a unit of the Russian 58th army stationed nearby. In 2001, the president of Ingushetia, Ruslan Aushev, accused the military personnel of profaning the monuments of the Dzheirakh district by \\"setting up a latrine\\" near the Tkhaba- Yerdy Church. He also said a military helicopter had destroyed an adjacent burial site.Russia: Army Accused Of Desecrations. The New York Times. July 14, 2001. –ü–æ–ª–∏–≥–æ–Ω –≤ –º—É–∑–µ–µ-–∑–∞–ø–æ–≤–µ–¥–Ω–∏–∫–µ.

Early life Elizabeth MacLennan was born in Glasgow, Scotland, daughter of Sir Hector MacLennan and Isabel Margaret (n√©e Adam). Her father was a gynaecologist, president of the Royal Society of Medicine; her mother was also a physician and public health professional. Her older brother Robert Maclennan, Baron Maclennan of Rogart, was a politician; her younger brother David MacLennan was a fellow theatre professional. Their grandfather, R. J. MacLennan, was editor of the Glasgow Evening News. She attended Laurel Bank girls' school in Glasgow, and the Benenden School in Kent. She read modern history at St Hilda‚Äôs College, Oxford, where she became active in experimental theatre productions, sharing the bill with fellow students Dudley Moore, Alan Bennett, and Ken Loach. She studied acting at London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.  Career  MacLennan acted through the 1960s, on stage and in television and film. With her husband, playwright John McGrath, and brother, David MacLennan, she helped to found 7:84 Theatre Company (in 1971) and 7:84 Scotland (in 1973).Michael Billington, \\"Elizabeth MacLennan obituary\\", The Guardian, 29 June 2015. She performed in plays with 7:84 throughout the 1970s and 1980s, in such classics of British popular theatre as The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil (1973), Trees in the Wind, and Men Should Weep. She starred in McGrath's last play, HyperLynx (2002), directed by her daughter Kate McGrath. In 1990, she published an account of her time with the 7:84 company, The Moon Belongs to Everyone, in which she acknowledges McGrath her \\"major 'influence' and life partner\\".MacLennan, Elizabeth. 1990.

A claim for that milestone had previously been made for Emergency ‚Äì Ward 10, which post-dates the kiss between Reckord and MacLennan. One earlier example (also involving Lloyd Reckord) has since been found.  Personal life  MacLennan married playwright, screenwriter, and director John McGrath in 1962. They had three children, Finn, Danny, and Kate. She was widowed in 2002, and she died of leukaemia on 23 June 2015, in London, aged 77 years. \\"MacLennon was one of nature's fiery spirits, who wholeheartedly put her beliefs into action\\", commented critic Michael Billington in her obituary in The Guardian.

He moved to London and worked as a publisher's representative at Odhams Press. He campaigned against capital punishment and became very interested in prisons and their occupants, eventually focussing on the experiences of prisoners after release.

The Park Street bridge is one of the four bridges that allow access to Alameda. It is considered the best route for bicycles to cross to Alameda as the small narrow walkway in the Posey Tube is difficult to navigate if there is another pedestrian or bicyclist also using it.  History  The original Park Street bridge was completed in 1893. The Park Street, High Street, and Fruitvale Avenue bridges were built by the U.S. Government in exchange for permission and rights-of-way to dredge the channel between San Antonio Creek and San Leandro Bay. It had a wooden deck, a wrought iron thru truss swing span and wooden trestle approach spans. Riding the bridge as it opened to let water traffic through, as well as fishing off the bridge, were popular activities. It took ten years after the bridge's completion to dredge the channel. The present bridge was designed by the County of Alameda Surveyors Office and constructed under the Federal WPA Program. It was opened in 1935 with a grand opening celebration that included a public wedding of a man from Oakland and woman from Alameda to symbolize the unity of the two cities with the building of the bridge.

Geology The Browns deposit has a quoted JORC resource of 84 million tonnes of ore grading 0.78% copper, 0.11% cobalt and 0.12% nickel. This is a global resource hosted in four separate zones; # Browns (40Mt @ 0.49% Cu, 4.53% Pb, 0.109% Co, 0.09% Ni, 13ppm Ag) # Browns East (30.5Mt @ 1.29% Cu, 1.28% Pb, 0.13% Co, 0.13% Ni, 11ppm Ag) # Area 55 (12.2Mt @ 0.49% Cu, 0.56% Pb, 0.14% Co, 0.14% Ni) # Mount Fitch (1.3Mt @ 0.60% Cu, 0.2% Co, 0.2% Ni) The global resources are subdivided into oxide and sulfide resources. The oxide resources consist of supergene or weathered sulfide ore where the ore mineralogy is dominated by metal oxides, hydroxides, clays and carbonates after the original sulfide mineralogy.  Exploitation  The Browns deposit is currently being developed as a major base metals mine by Compass Resources NL, an Australian public company, in joint venture with Hunan Nonferrous Metals Corporation, a Chinese government company. The mine is due to be complete in August 2008, after suffering cost escalation and construction delays, and will produce 15,000 tonnes of copper, 4,000 tonnes of cobalt and 4,000 tonnes of nickel per annum, with a mine life of 30 years, mining the oxide and supergene ores. The processing plant includes solvent extraction and electrowinning processing equipment.

It is derived from the Greek word prodromos, meaning \\"running before\\". Prodromes may be non-specific symptoms or, in a few instances, may clearly indicate a particular disease, such as the prodromal migraine aura. For example, fever, malaise, headache and lack of appetite frequently occur in the prodrome of many infective disorders. A prodrome can be the early precursor to an episode of a chronic neurological disorder such as a migraine headache or an epileptic seizure, where prodrome symptoms may include euphoria or other changes in mood, insomnia, abdominal sensations, disorientation, aphasia, or photosensitivity. Such a prodrome occurs on a scale of days to an hour before the episode, where an aura occurs more immediate to it. Prodromal labour, mistakenly called \\"false labour,\\" refers to the early signs before labour starts. In mental health The prodrome is a period during which an individual experiences some symptoms and/or a change in functioning, which can signal the impending onset of a mental health disorder. It is otherwise known as the prodromal phase when referring to the subsyndromal stage or the early abnormalities in behavior, mood, and/or cognition before illness onset. Early detection of the prodrome can create an opportunity to administer appropriate early interventions quickly to try to delay or decrease the intensity of subsequent symptoms. =In schizophrenia= Schizophrenia was the first disorder for which a prodromal stage was described. People who go on to develop schizophrenia commonly experience non-specific negative symptoms such as depression, anxiety symptoms, and social isolation. This is often followed by the emergence of attenuated positive symptoms such as problems with communication, perception, and unusual thoughts that don't rise to the level of psychosis. Closer to the onset of psychosis, people often exhibit more serious symptoms like pre- delusional unusual thoughts, pre-hallucinatory perceptual abnormalities or pre-thought disordered speech disturbances. As positive symptoms become more severe, in combination with negative symptoms that may have begun earlier, the individual may meet the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia. Although a majority of individuals who experience some of the symptoms of schizophrenia will never meet full diagnostic criteria, approximately 20‚Äì40% will eventually be diagnosed with schizophrenia. One of the challenges of identifying and treating the prodrome is that it is difficult to predict who, among those with symptoms, are likely to meet full criteria later.  Duration  The prodromal phase in schizophrenia can last anywhere from several weeks to several years, and comorbid disorders, such as major depressive disorder, are common during this period.  Identification/assessments  Screening instruments include the Scale of Prodromal Symptoms and the PROD-screen. Signs and symptoms of the prodrome to schizophrenia can be assessed more fully using structured interviews. For example, the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes, and the Comprehensive Assessment of At Risk Mental States (CAARMS) are both valid and reliable methods for identifying individuals likely experiencing the prodrome to schizophrenia or related psychotic-spectrum disorders. There are ongoing research efforts to develop tools for early detection of at-risk individuals. This includes development of risk calculators and methods for large-scale population screening.  Interventions  Describing the schizophrenia prodrome has been useful in promoting early intervention. Although not all people who are experiencing symptoms consistent with the prodrome will develop schizophrenia, randomized controlled trials suggest that intervening with medication and/or psychotherapy can improve outcomes. Interventions with evidence of efficacy include antipsychotic and antidepressant medications, which can delay conversion to psychosis and improve symptoms, although prolonged exposure to antipsychotics has been associated with adverse effects including Tardive dyskinesia, an irreversible neurological motor disorder. Psychotherapy for individuals and families can also improve functioning and symptomatology; specifically cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps improve coping strategies to decrease positive psychosis symptoms. Additionally, omega-3 fish oil supplements may help reduce prodromal symptoms. Current guidelines suggest that individuals who are at ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù for developing schizophrenia should be monitored for at least one to two years while receiving psychotherapy and medication, as needed, to treat their symptoms. =In bipolar disorder=  Symptomology  There is also growing evidence that there is a prodromal phase before the onset of bipolar disorder (BD). Although a majority of individuals with bipolar disorder report experiencing some symptoms preceding the full onset of their illness, the prodrome to BD has not yet been described systematically. Descriptive reports of bipolar prodrome symptoms vary and often focus on nonspecific symptoms of psychopathology, making identification of the prodromal phase difficult. The most commonly observed symptoms are too much energy, elated or depressed mood, and alterations in sleep patterns. There are no prospective studies of the prodrome to bipolar disorder, but in the Longitudinal Assessment of Manic Symptoms (LAMS) study, which followed youth with elevated symptoms of mania for ten years. Approximately 23% of the sample met BD criteria at the baseline and 13% of which did not meet the criteria for BD at baseline eventually were diagnosed with BD.  Duration  The reported duration of the prodrome to BD varies widely (mean = 27.1 +/- 23 months); for most people, evidence suggests that the prodromal phase is likely to be long enough to allow for intervention.  Identification/assessments  Symptoms consistent with the prodrome to BD can be identified through semi-structured interviews such as The Bipolar Prodrome Symptom Interview and Scale-Prospective (BPSS-P), and the Semi- structured Interview for Mood Swings and symptom checklists like the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D).  Interventions  Early intervention is associated with better outcomes for people with prodromal symptoms of BD. Interventions with some evidence of efficacy include medication (e.g. mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics) and psychotherapy. Specifically, family-focused therapy improves emotion regulation and enhances functioning in both adults and adolescents. Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT) may be beneficial for youth at risk of developing BD by helping to stabilize their sleep and circadian patterns. Psychoeducational Psychotherapy (PEP) may be protective in individuals at risk of developing bipolar disorder and are associated with a four-fold reduction in risk for conversion to BD. This research needs to be explored further, however, it is currently thought to produce improvements in decreased stress due to social support and improved functioning through the skills developed in PEP. PEP can prove especially beneficial for individuals presenting transitional mania symptoms as it can assist caregivers in recognizing prodromal mania symptoms and knowing the next steps towards early intervention. The key goals of this type of therapy are to provide psychoeducation about mood disorders and treatments, social support, and to build skills in symptom management, emotion regulation, and problem-solving and communication. This research is in its infancy, further investigations will be necessary to determine which methods lead to the best outcomes and for whom.

The outgoing elected government used to hand over its power to the nonelected nonpartisan caretaker government (CTG). Top members of the caretaker government did not represent any political party; nor were they allowed to contest the elections. The main objective of the caretaker government was to create a level playing field environment in which an election could be held in a free and fair manner without any political influence by the outgoing government. It was not empowered to take any policy decisions unless it was necessary. The head of the caretaker government was called the Chief Adviser (in place of Prime Minister of Bangladesh) and was selected by the President of Bangladesh. The Chief Adviser selected the other advisers. The top positions of the administration were generally distributed among the advisers. The Chief Adviser and the other advisers were committed for their activities to the President of Bangladesh. History In 1990 three party alliances discussed creating a better environment for elections. They jointly made a demand for it. After the forced resignation of General Hussain Muhammad Ershad, the three alliances nominated Chief Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed as the Chief Adviser. The caretaker government was headed by a Chief Adviser, who enjoyed the same power as the regular prime minister of the country except in defence matters. The advisers functioned as ministers. Since 1996, a Caretaker government has managed the elections and transitions of 1996, 2001 and 2008. Although the first caretaker government (CTG) was intended to help the transition from authoritarianism to democracy, this system was adopted as part of the Constitution in 1996 by the Sixth Parliament. It was dominated by Bangladesh Nationalist Party, which yielded to opposition pressure. In Bangladesh, a Caretaker Government (CTG) ruled for the period of 1990 to 1991 with the understanding of the major political party alliances. Later, CTGs were formed within the constitutional framework in 1996, 2001 and 2006. The 13th amendment to the constitution was passed in the parliament formalising this arrangement. In addition, an extra-constitutional military-backed CTG was installed in 2007; it governed the country without legitimacy, but ultimately handed over power to the elected political party following 29 December 2008 parliamentary election. They were under pressure internationally to yield to a democratically elected government. According to the provision (before abolishment) of CTG in the Bangladesh Constitution, there were six options to appoint a Chief Advisor (CA). The last option of CA is the President. The CTG had to hold an election within 90 days and in 120 days could hand over power to the duly elected political party. The daily operations of government, routine duties, and holding parliamentary election are the mandated responsibilities of the CTG. Caretaker Government was very popular in Bangladesh although it was a contradiction with constitution. Recently Pakistan and Greece have also adopted this model to hold elections and overcome political stalemate. 2008 Election A cartoon from Caretaker government of Bangladesh 2007 that describe the massive arrest of corrupt politicians. Cartoon by Arifur Rahman The national election of Bangladesh was held on 29 December 2008 under the Caretaker government formed with Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed as the Chief Adviser on 13 January 2007. This was the third Caretaker government formed after the tenure of the government of prime minister Khaleda Zia ended in October 2006. The Caretaker government of Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed functioned without legislative authority as it continued to function after its scheduled tenure of 120 days ended on 12 May 2007. All decisions taken after this date must be ratified by the parliament for the sake of legitimacy. The Caretaker government of Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed was a military controlled and has made extensive use of the military to stymie the chaos that preceded 11 January 2007 (popularly known as 1/11, like 9/11). From the very outset however, the government made it clear that they were there not only to arrange a free and fair election, but also to make sure that all aspects that are connected to it are reviewed properly. This meant major reforms in the election system, but also making sure that corrupt candidates could not take part in the election. The task was however an enormous one, since Bangladesh is regarded as one of the most corrupt nations in the world. Therefore, the government had exceeded its mandated term, which according to the constitution allows it to stay only for 90 days. Reforms The caretaker government introduced Voter ID cards (with photograph) for the first time just before 2008 Bangladeshi general election. The Bangladesh Army, including members of other military forces, were deployed throughout the nation prior to the elections, including the remotest areas, to assist with voter registration and issuance of the new IDs. They were equipped with laptops and small digital cameras in an effort that would result in the most orderly voters' registration list in Bangladesh's history. Reactions Initial reactions of the public were welcoming. The arrests of corrupt prominent politicians in 2007 led many to believe that a new political age was imminent. No new major parties came into the scene. In some cases, former political leaders had been released from prison in 2008 and appeared to be returning to former positions and displacing reformers. Opponents of the CTG's long tenure had chiefly been of the two major political parties. Members of the public in general understood the reasons and necessity for the government' actions. The televisions and print media had reported events throughout the term (2007 to 2008). There had been little questioning of the leaders who had been charged with an array of corruption charges, and who were now on the verge of returning to power. Almost all of the television channels are now owned by members from one of the two major parties.

Besides carrying passengers and cargo, it evacuated wounded personnel and flew courier routes in SWPA. Active in the Reserve from June 1947 ‚Äì June 1949, it supervised subordinate unit training. From March 1954, the 322d Air Division was responsible for airlifting personnel, cargo, and mail in Europe. Almost immediately after it commenced operations in Europe, the 322d became involved in a major airlift of French troops (Project Bali Hai) from bases in France to Indochina. Initially concerned only with operations in West Germany and France, it soon began operating throughout the entire USAFE area of responsibility. In addition to its routine duties, the division supported numerous humanitarian missions to Turkey, Iran, Morocco, and Pakistan, among other states. It also provided airlift support in the following crises: the nationalization of the Suez Canal in 1956; the Hungarian Revolution of 1956; the 1958 Lebanon crisis; support for UN forces in the Congo in 1960‚Äì1961; the invasion of India by Communist Chinese forces in 1962‚Äì1963; airlift of peacekeeping forces to Cyprus in 1964; and the Middle East crisis of 1967. Between 1954 and 1968, the division supported numerous USAFE and NATO exercises. From June 1978, the 322d AD managed tactical airlift forces stationed and operating in the European theater and coordinated strategic airlift from the United States and other origins. It also assumed responsibility for all aeromedical operations and administrative airlift in the theater, including highly positioned military and civilian U.S. and foreign government officials. In addition, the division supported military exercises such as Ardent Ground, Dawn Patrol, Flintlock, and Cold Fire/Reforger. In 1985 the 322d acquired peacetime responsibility for airlift management in Africa.

Directed by John Huston and written by Carol Sobieski, the film stars Albert Finney, Carol Burnett, Ann Reinking, Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, Geoffrey Holder, Edward Herrmann and Aileen Quinn as the title character. Set during the Great Depression in 1933, the film tells the story of Annie, an orphan from New York City who is taken in by America's richest billionaire Oliver Warbucks. Principal photography took place for six weeks at Monmouth University in New Jersey. Produced by Ray Stark's Rastar and released by Columbia Pictures on June 18, 1982, Annie received mixed reviews from film critics and grossed $57 million on a $50 million budget. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Production Design and Best Song Score and its Adaptation. A television film sequel, titled Annie: A Royal Adventure! was released in 1995. In their first film collaboration, Disney and Columbia Pictures produced a made-for-television film version in 1999. Columbia released another film adaptation on December 19, 2014. Plot In 1933, during the Great Depression, a young orphan named Annie is living in the Hudson Street Orphanage in New York City which is run by Miss Hannigan, a cruel alcoholic who forces the orphans to clean the building daily (\\"It's the Hard Knock Life for Us\\"). With half of a locket as her only possession, Annie remains optimistic that her parents, who left her on the doorstep as a baby, will return for her (\\"Maybe\\"). Annie sneaks out with help from a laundry man named Mr. Jules Bundles and adopts a stray dog which she names Sandy (\\"Dumb Dog\\"). Unfortunately, Annie is returned to the orphanage shortly after by a police officer (\\"Sandy\\"). Grace Farrell, secretary to billionaire Oliver Warbucks, arrives to invite an orphan to live with Warbucks for a week in order to improve his public image. Annie is chosen and she and Sandy travel to Warbucks's mansion where they meet his many servants and two bodyguards Punjab and the Asp (\\"I Think I'm Gonna Like It Here\\"). Initially dismissive of Annie due to her being female, Warbucks is charmed into letting her stay to which he takes Annie and Grace to the Radio City Music Hall to watch a movie, Camille, while beginning to develop affection for Annie (\\"Let's Go to the Movies\\"). Grace urges him to adopt Annie (\\"We Got Annie\\") and he meets with Miss Hannigan, convincing her to sign the adoption papers while Hannigan drunkenly tries to seduce him (\\"Sign\\"). Warbucks reveals his plans to Annie, even offering her a new locket, but she declines. She explains the purpose of her broken locket and her hope that her parents will return with the other half. Warbucks appears on Bert Healy's radio show and offers $50,000 to find Annie's parents (\\"You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile\\"). This causes mass hysteria with many would-be parents appearing to claim the money. To escape the madness, Warbucks flies Annie to the White House and introduces her to President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his wife Eleanor. Roosevelt informs them of his plan to introduce a social welfare program to help America's impoverished and asks Warbucks to head it; Annie encourages him to help (\\"Tomorrow\\"). Upon returning home, Annie is disheartened when Grace reveals none of the potential parents knew about the locket. Miss Hannigan is visited by her con artist brother Rooster and his girlfriend Lily St. Regis; they plot to pose as Annie's parents to gain the reward. The trio search the orphans' belongings and Miss Hannigan reveals Annie's real parents died in a fire years ago; therefore she (Hannigan) possesses the other half of the locket (\\"Easy Street\\"). Annie's friends overhear the conversation and try to sneak out, but are caught and locked away. Rooster and Lily succeed with the ruse and Annie is kidnapped minutes after leaving the mansion (\\"Maybe (Reprise\\"). However, her friends ultimately reach Warbucks and tell him the truth; To his shock, he informs the FBI and the police, who begin a citywide search. Annie convinces the felons to pull over, only to escape and destroy Warbucks's check. In his fury, Rooster chases Annie up a raised railroad bridge in an effort to kill her; Miss Hannigan, who never wanted Annie hurt, attempts to stop Rooster, but her own brother knocks her out. As Rooster and Annie reach the top of the bridge, Punjab is able to rescue Annie, reuniting her with Warbucks and Grace. Rooster and Lily are arrested while Annie is officially adopted by Warbucks (\\"I Don't Need Anything But You\\"). At a party in which the orphans, a redeemed Miss Hannigan and the Roosevelts attend, Warbucks gives Annie the new locket and she embraces her new father. Warbucks also kisses Grace (reciprocating the feelings she secretly harbors for him) implying that the two will eventually marry. The fireworks as in the ending credits crackle overhead and write Annie's name. Cast * Aileen Quinn as Annie Bennett, a 10-year-old orphan girl * Albert Finney as Oliver \\"Daddy\\" Warbucks, a billionaire businessman who adopts Annie as his daughter. Sean Connery and Cary Grant were also considered for the role before Finney was chosen. * Carol Burnett as Miss Agatha Hannigan, a cruel and slovenly drunkard who manages the orphanage * Tim Curry as Daniel Francis \\"Rooster\\" Hannigan, Agatha's con-artist brother * Bernadette Peters as Lily St. Regis, Rooster's petty-thieving girlfriend * Ann Reinking as Grace Farrell, Warbucks's personal secretary * Edward Herrmann as Franklin D.

Regarding Huston being given the job of directing the first (and what would be the only) musical in his 40-year directing career, screenwriter Carol Sobieski stated: \\"Hiring John [Huston] is an outsider risk, and Ray's [Stark] a major gambler. He loves this kind of high risk situation.\\"Turan, Kenneth. \\"Annie\\", The New York Times, p. SM 40, May 2, 1982. =Writing= Sobieski, who wrote the screenplay, introduced major differences between the stage musical and the film adaptation. In the stage musical, it is Christmas when Miss Hannigan, Rooster and Lily are caught at the Warbucks mansion by the United States Secret Service thus foiling their plan to kidnap Annie, while in the film (due to summertime shooting) Annie is kidnapped and on the eve of the Fourth of July, leading to Warbucks organizing a citywide search and a climactic ending on the B&O; Bridge. Punjab and The Asp, Warbucks's servants/bodyguards, from the original comic strip, appear in the film in supporting roles. Miss Hannigan's redemption at the end is also a new development on the part of the film ‚Äì in the musical, Miss Hannigan briefly balks at Rooster's intention to make Annie \\"disappear\\" with his switchblade, but is soon lured by his promises of a life on Easy Street. In Meehan's 1980 novelization, Miss Hannigan shows no qualms whatsoever about Annie being killed. In both of these media, Miss Hannigan ends up being arrested alongside Rooster and Lily at the Warbucks mansion. The film also featured five new songs, \\"Dumb Dog\\", \\"Sandy\\", \\"Let's Go to the Movies\\", \\"Sign\\" and \\"We Got Annie\\", and cut \\"We'd like to Thank You, Herbert Hoover\\", \\"N.Y.C\\", \\"You Won't Be an Orphan for Long\\", \\"Something Was Missing\\", \\"Annie\\" and \\"New Deal for Christmas\\". In addition, the song \\"Maybe\\" has two reprises whereas \\"Little Girls\\" and \\"Easy Street\\" do not. Martin Charnin, the lyricist of Annie, was not impressed with the cinematic interpretation. In a 1996 interview, he dismissed the adaptation and its production. \\"The movie distorted what this musical was\\", Charnin reported. \\"And we were culpable for the reason that we did not exercise any kind of creative control because we sold the rights for a considerable amount of money.\\" Charnin even said that Huston, who had never directed a musical before, and producer Ray Stark made major changes in the film that destroyed the essence of Annie. Warbucks, played by Finney, \\"was an Englishman who screamed\\". Hannigan, played by Burnett, was \\"a man-crazy drunk\\", and Annie was \\"cute-ed up\\". Worse, the emotional relationship between Annie and Warbucks was distorted. They even downplayed the hit song \\"Tomorrow\\" because \\"Stark thought it was corny\\". =Filming= Wilson Hall, at Monmouth University campus, New Jersey, was used as the exteriors of Oliver Warbucks's mansion. The NX Bridge over the Passaic River in New Jersey where the ending was filmed. Principal photography took place over the course of six weeks at Monmouth College, now Monmouth University, in West Long Branch, New Jersey, which has two mansions that were used in the film, one of which is the Shadow Lawn Mansion. The NX Bridge, an abandoned railroad bridge over the Passaic River in Newark, was used for location shooting of one of the climactic scenes. Many of the street sets were filmed at Warner Bros. Burbank Studios, 4000 Warner Boulevard, Burbank, California. Production designer Dale Hennesy overhauled the old \\"Tenement Street\\" back lot set at Warner Bros. by outfitting many of the New York styled apartment and store front facades with actual New York fire escapes and other treatments specifically brought in for this production. Hennesy died during filming and the back lot set was renamed \\"Hennesy Street\\" in honor of the late production designer. Originally, the song \\"Easy Street\\" was going to be the biggest musical number in the film. For this purpose, a specially-created outdoor street set was built, costing more than $1 million. It took one week to shoot the scene, but on reviewing the dailies, the scene was considered to be \\"overstuffed\\" and \\"sour.\\" Therefore, a re-shoot was undertaken nearly two months after principal filming had been completed. The scene was replaced with a version shot indoors in a style that mimicked the ambience portrayed in the original stage musical. Soundtrack Annie is a soundtrack album for the 1982 film of the same name. Reception =Critical response= Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four and reported that it \\"is not about anything,\\" but \\"I sort of enjoyed the movie. I enjoyed the energy that was visible on the screen, and the sumptuousness of the production numbers, and the good humor of several of the performances -- especially those by Albert Finney, as Daddy Warbucks, and Carol Burnett, as the wicked orphanage supervisor, Miss Hannigan. Aileen Quinn sort of grew on me, too.\\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, \\"'Annie' is far from a great film but, like the Music Hall in the good old days, it is immaculately maintained and almost knocks itself out trying to give the audience its money's worth. They don't build movies like this anymore.\\"Canby, Vincent (May 21, 1982). \\"Film: Huston's 'Annie' Makes Its Lavish Debut\\". The New York Times. C4.

Variety. May 12, 1982. 11. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and called it \\"a bit of a letdown,\\" writing that Quinn \\"often comes across as one of those self-conscious stage kids\\" and that the four new songs \\"are not the least bit memorable,\\" but Finney gives the best performance in the film as \\"he steadily turns into a quite wonderful father figure.\\"Siskel, Gene (June 18, 1982). \\"'Annie' has trouble leapin' to film\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 3, p. 3. Sheila Benson of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film \\"staggers under monstrous production numbers, orphans doing gymnastic flips, dancing maids and butlers and the Radio City Music Hall complete with Rockettes ... But a kid with Annie's moxie deserves more. Or perhaps less. What she deserves is an atmosphere of innocence, warmth and inventiveness, to let the film generate the joy that must have enveloped theater audiences over the past five years.\\"Benson, Sheila (May 21, 1982). \\"An 'Annie' With All the Moves‚ÄîExcept Moving\\".

It was re-issued in 1983, 1984, 1985, 1994, and 1997 (in a \\"Broadway Tribute Edition\\" to coincide with the original play's Broadway 20th anniversary revival that year). There were two widescreen LaserDiscs released, one in 1989 and another in 1994. The film was released in a widescreen DVD edition on December 12, 2000. A \\"Special Anniversary Edition\\" DVD was released on January 13, 2004 (four days before producer Stark's death). Despite the fact that the first DVD was widescreen, the DVD was in pan and scan (but with DTS sound). Reviewing the disc for DVD Talk, Glenn Erickson, while praising the film overall, called the pan and scan transfer an \\"abomination that's grainy and lacking in color.\\" He also noted that the short retrospective featurette with Ms. Quinn contained clips from the film in the correct aspect ratio. Erickson also called the music video of \\"It's the Hard- Knock Life\\" by Play \\"pretty dreary\\" and attacked the other, child-oriented extras by saying \\"Musicals and kids' films aren't just for tots ... and this disc is little more than a headache.\\" However, several countries in Region 2 received widescreen versions of this edition including the United Kingdom. The film was released as a \\"sing-along edition\\" on Blu-ray on October 2, 2012 in celebration of the 30th anniversary of the film and the 35th anniversary of the Broadway version set a revival in November 2012. Adaptations ;Comic book adaptation Marvel Comics published a comic book adaptation of the film by writer Tom DeFalco and artists Win Mortimer and Vince Colletta in Marvel Super Special #23 (Summer 1982).

It also earned two Emmy Awards and a 1999 George Foster Peabody Award. Although truer to the original stage musical than the 1982 version (as well as having a more comedic tone than the 1982 version's slightly dark one), it condensed much of the full story in order to make it more watchable for children.

Rail bridge The rail bridge is immediately northwest of the Miller-Sweeney road bridge. The rail bridge connected Fruitvale Avenue in Oakland with Tilden Way in Alameda. It has been out of service since 2000. =History= This lift bridge was constructed in 1951 to replace an earlier bridge that originally served the SP interurban trains from San Francisco (SP's Interurban Electric Railway discontinued service in 1941). From 1951 until September 11, 1996, the Southern Pacific Railroad operated freight service across the bridge to serve shippers in Alameda and to connect with the Alameda Belt Line railroad. After SP was acquired by Union Pacific on September 11, 1996, UP provided infrequent service to Alameda until service was discontinued in 2000. =Design= The right-of-way still exists through the East Bay, however, the tracks on both sides of the bridge have been severed and the span remains raised at 65 feet above water level, except when operated for maintenance and testing. The bridge is owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and is operated by the County of Alameda. The Miller-Sweeney bridge tender, a county employee, operates the railroad bridge from controls in the Miller-Sweeney control house. The last train across the bridge ran in 2000. Road bridge The road bridge is officially named the Miller-Sweeney Bridge at Fruitvale Avenue. It has no overhead steel structure like the other road bridges between Alameda and Oakland (the High Street Bridge and the Park Street Bridge) so tall vehicles should use the Miller-Sweeney Bridge. Miller-Sweeney opens approximately 1,600 times per year to accommodate marine traffic. =History= A railroad-only swing truss bridge at this location initially opened in 1894. It was regraded to accommodate road traffic, and the train tracks were removed in 1951 with the completion of the dedicated vertical-lift rail bridge. The present Miller-Sweeney Bridge was completed in 1973 by the US Army Corps of Engineers and turned over to Alameda County in 1975. Miller- Sweeney won a prize bridge award for movable spans from the American Institute of Steel Construction in 1974. The Miller-Sweeney Bridge was damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and was damaged again in 1991 when a fully loaded barge hit the span. =Design= The Miller-Sweeney Bridge is normally opened by two motors, which take 66 seconds to fully open the bridge to 79¬∞. The motors typically operate in tandem, drawing electricity from Alameda Municipal Power. Under emergency conditions, a portable generator may be used to power the single backup motor, which takes 20 minutes to fully open the bridge.

In Venezuela, Castillan is the official language and is the mother tongue of the majority of Venezuelans. Although there is an established official language, there are countless languages of indigenous villages spoken throughout Venezuela, and various regions also have languages of their own. There are at least forty languages spoken or used in Venezuela, but Spanish is the language spoken by the majority of Venezuelans. The 1999 Constitution of Venezuela declared Spanish and languages spoken by indigenous people from Venezuela as official languages. Deaf people use Venezuelan Sign Language (lengua de se√±as venezolana, LSV). Chinese (400,000), Portuguese (254,000) and Italian (200,000), are the most spoken languages in Venezuela after the official language of Spanish. Wayuu is the most spoken indigenous language with 170,000 speakers.  Official language  According to the Constitution of Venezuela, Castilian (Spanish) is the official language of Venezuela. The Venezuelan Constitution of 1999 states that: > Article 9. The official language of the country is Castillan. Indigenous > languages also hold an official status within their villages and must be > respected throughout. the Republic, in order to constitute cultural equity > of the country and of humanity. Although Venezuelan Sign Language is not considered an official language, article 81 of The Constitution establishes the right of all deaf people to communicate through VSL, and further establishes in article 101 the right of these people to forms of public and private television in their language.  Indigenous languages  Many of the indigenous languages of Venezuela are threatened and or endangered. The two linguistic families with the highest number of languages are the Arahuacan and the Caribbean. According to data available from the last indigenous census (1992) and the 2001 general census of population and housing, in Venezuela there are at least 70 indigenous languages that are spoken, of which 40 are grouped into eight linguistic families and the other 30 do not present a recognizable relationship with other languages, and by so they are considered language isolates. Dixon and Aikhenvald considered that the number of distinguishable languages varies around 38 and the number of speakers of indigenous language is closer to 100 thousand although the number of indigenous people is greater than that figure, because many are not competent speakers of the ancestral language of their ethnic group. On the other hand, Ethnologue, whose classification does not always distinguish between dialects of the same language and different languages, distinguishes 46 linguistic varieties in Venezuela. The majority of the indigenous Venezuelans speak Castillan as a second language. Following you have the number of speakers given by Ethnologue, which distinguishes a greater number of varieties (in parentheses the approximate number of its users) is given. All languages spoken by the indigenous people of Venezuela are also recognized as official languages and part of the cultural patrimony. = Arawak family = *Paraujano (¬ø?): this language is spoken most prominently in the Sinamaica area. Until recently it was considered extinct, but has gone through a process of revitalization that has been supported by UNICEF. *Kurripako (2.019) *Arawak (140) *Warekena (199) *Wayuu (119.000): this is the indigenous language with the most speakers in Venezuela. It is spoken in the northern state of Zulia and in the Colombian Guajira. There are also Way√∫u communities in other parts of Venezuela. = Caribbean family = Caribe languages, from 2000. The majority of these languages are spoken in the southeastern part of Venezuela. In the past, similar languages to these were spoken in a great part of the East Venezuelan coast and the Cuenta del Orinoco. * Akauayo (644 - from the 1992 census): A spoken language in the state of Monagas and Bolivar in an area bordering on Pem√≥n speakers. *E√±ep√° or Panare (2.551): Spoken in the state of Bol√≠var and the Amazon. *Japrer√≠a (95): Spoken only in a town in the state of Zulia, in the western part of the country. *Kari√±a (4450): Spoken in a few municipalities in eastern Venezuela. *Pem√≥n ( - 30000): The speakers are primarily in the southeastern zone of the state of Bol√≠var in the Gran Sabana and its surroundings. * Wanai or Mapoyo (2?): A language in the midst of disappearing, spoken in the Amazon and very similar to the Yavarana. On November 25, 2014 it was included in the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, in the list with urgent safeguards and it is the first Venezuelan indigenous language declared by UNESCO. * Yavarana (119 - ): It is a language threatened and disappearing in its spoken form, from the northeast of the Amazon. *Ye'kuana (5500): Its speakers are located in the Northeast state of the Amazon and in the Southeast of Bol√≠var. *Yukpa (3.285): This language is spoken in the state of Zulia. Among the Caribbean languages that are now extinct, since the conquest, are the tamanaco, the cumanagoto and the chaima. = Chibcha family = *Bari language: It is spoken by approximately 1,520 people of ethnic Bar√≠ in Venezuela in 2007. = Guajibo family = Guajibo languages * Jivi (8.428) This language is spoken mostly in the state of Apure and the state of Amazon. * Kuiva (310). = Saliva-piaroa family = *S√°liva (17) *Piaroa (12000) = Tupi family = * Yeral (482) = Yanomami family = Yanomami languages of Venezuela. These languages are spoken by groups in the south of Venezuela and the north of Brazil: *Sanem√° (1.669) *Yanomami (6.119) *Yanam (?) = Macro- maku family = The macro-mak√∫ family is made up by the mak√∫ languages, which is widely accepted by Americanists, and by the languages of two relatively isolated hunter-gatherer ethnic groups in Venezuela: *Puinave (568) * Joti (526) The experts differ about the classification of these languages, and there are doubts whether these languages should be considered provisionally isolated or provisionally accepted as forming a valid phylogenetic unit with the mak√∫es languages. = Other small families = Timote-cuica languages at the start of the Conquest The Jirajarana family or Jirajirana is a group of extinct languages spoken in the western regions of Venezuela, Falcon and Lara. It is believed that the languages went extinct at the start of the 20th century. The Jirajara languages are considered to be semi-isolates. Adelaar and Muysken point out certain lexical similarities with Timote-Cuica languages, and typological similarities with Chibcha languages. But the limited data does not allow validity to any similarities between the Jirajarana and Betol languages, particularly for the similarities of the ethnonyms. The arutani-sap√© family hypothetically would have been formed by the Sap√© and the Uruak, which some authors considered it unclassified - isolated languages. Isolated, unclassified, and doubtfully classified languages Isolated languages from Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia and Venezuela. Isolated Languages already extinct from the center and southeast parts of Venezuela. Only yaruro (pum√©) is still spoken. The last speakers of Otomaco and Guamo lived in the early 20th century. Some languages have yet to be classified because they fall under a larger family, these are called ‚Äúunclassified languages‚Äù. For some of these said languages, there exists some oral evidence, but oral history is not convincing enough. For other languages, that are studied and not classified, they fall under the ‚Äúlanguage isolates‚Äù category, meaning that they are considered to be the only member of that family. Here is the list of unclassified languages that fall under larger families: * Maku (mako) (266) *Pum√© (4.061) *Sap√© (25) (arutani-sap√© languages ?) *Uruak (39) (arutani-sap√© languages ?) *Warao (18.696): This language is mainly spoken in the Delta of Orinoco area and some Cercanas regions. It is one of the indigenous languages in Venezuela with the most speakers, after Way√∫u and Pem√≥n. * Guamontey : Extinct language from central Venezuela. *Otomaco : Extinct language from the central and southern regions of Venezuela.

Religious Jesuits, Capuchins and others developed the first forms of grammar and dictionaries of languages such as the Caribbean, Cumanagoto, Chaima and many more. The friar Matias Ruiz Blanco created in the second half of the 17th century a grammar and a dictionary of the Cumanagoto, as well as a catechism in that Caribbean language. The Jesuit Gilli conducted extensive studies of the Orinoco language in the mid- eighteenth century. Gilli studied the relation of the different languages and presented the existence of a series of matrix languages or families of languages, that would become one of the foundations of a classification of the South American languages. The monk Jer√≥nimo Jos√© de Lucena, elaborated at the end of that century a vocabulary and translations of catechism of the Otomaco, Taparita and Yaruro languages. Another religious figure, most likely Miguel Angel de Gerona, elaborated on a compendium of the Pariagota language, spoken in Guayana during that century. Alexander Von Humboldt collected grammar and list of words on his trip to Venezuela in 1799-1800 and with that helped share information about these languages to European Linguists. His brother Wilhelm Von Humboldt used this material in his scientific works about the nature of languages. In the 20th century, father Basilio Mar√≠a of Barral produced a Warao-Spanish dictionary. The capuchin Ces√°reo of Armellada wrote grammar and a dictionary of the Pem√≥n language and compiled tales of the Pemona culture. In the 1960s, the American Henry A. Osborn conducted some studies on the morphosyntax and phonetics of the Warao language. Jorge Carlos Mosonyi was one of the most featured scientists at the end of the 20th century in the study of several original languages such as Karina. Marie-Claude Matt√©i-M√ºller has done extensive work on the Yanomam√∂, Panare, Mapoyo, Hod√Ø and Yawarana languages. These and other linguists have contributed to the production of the first literacy books for the first Venezuelan nations.  Foreign languages  Languages spoken by immigrants and their descendants are found in Venezuela. The most important are Chinese (400,000), Portuguese (254,000), Italian (200,000), Arabic (110,000), German (20,000) and English (20,000). Some people who live next to the border of Brazil speak Portuguese. In the areas located near to Guyana English language is used by some inhabitants, especially on Ankoko Island. Colonia Tovar dialect, a dialect of German language, is spoken in the Colonia Tovar.  Languages taught in schools  = English = English is a foreign language with a great demand in Venezuela. It is spoken by many academics and professionals and by some members of the middle and high social classes. There is an English language newspaper in Caracas: The Daily Journal, founded in 1946. The use of English arose in part due to the presence of oil companies from English speaking countries (especially from the United States) since the beginning of the 20th century. English is taught as a compulsory subject in the secondary education and in the bachillerato for five years. Bachillerato is a segment of secondary education similar to the baccalaureat, secondary school or American high school and is divided into two branches: sciences and humanities. According to the syllabus approved by the Venezuelan Ministry of Education in 1986 English language is considered as a tool to communicate with people from other countries and to obtain information in the areas of humanities, technology and science.Ministerio de Educaci√≥n: Programas de Estudio, Educaci√≥n B√°sica, INGL√âS, 7o, 8o, 9o grados. Caracas: 1986 For that reason it is taught using a Notional Functional Approach. In the bachillerato a Structuralistic Approach is used. Despite the lines provided by the syllabus, few people learn to speak the language with only the knowledge acquired at school. In some universities degree programs to train teachers or translators of English language are offered. In the rest of universities English is studied as a compulsory subject to understand texts written in this language. = Italian = In the second half of the twentieth century, more than 300,000 Italians mostly from Veneto moved to this oil rich country and left -linguistically - many words in the local language. For example, \\"Ciao\\" (English: Bye) is now a usual friendly salute in Caracas, not only between Italo-Venezuelans. There are even expressions in the local young people that mix Italian and Spanish words. According to the Italian Embassy in Caracas the \\"....Italian language teaching is guaranteed by the presence of a consistent number of private Venezuelan schools and institutions, where Italian language courses and Italian literature are active. Other similar courses are organized and sponsored by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Regional Associations. The Didactic Office of the General Consulate of Caracas, together with the Embassy, is negotiating an Agreement with the Venezuelan Authorities for the recognition of the Study Diplomas emitted by the Italian School (in Venezuela there is a Civil Association called ‚ÄúAgostino Codazzi‚Äù which offers the complete didactic cycle from elementary to high school) so that there can be access to the University system in Venezuela with an Italian high school Diploma. = French = French language is taught as a compulsory subject in the branch of humanities of the bachillerato or high school for two years.

It is separated into two sub-villages, Pokak and Tegal Duwur, separated by farmland, Pokak is divided further into West and East Pokak. Geography Mount Merapi as seen from Pokak Pokak is located between Yogyakarta and Solo. It is near the main road, but it is not used by most people thus not many know of the village. It shares its climate with the rest of Java, with summer and rainy seasons. Temperature ranges between 27 and 33* C. Mount Merapi is nearby. The area is fertile and elevated. Pokak is a house for gigantic trees Demographics The population is about 3000 people, with almost equal numbers of females and males. 99% of the population is Muslim and the rest are Christians. Half of the population are working class, and most are in farming. This village and most of the area support PDI-P, one of the major political parties. Garbage disposal The method of garbage disposal commonly used in Indonesia is by utilizing garbage collectors (dump trucks) that periodically collect the refuse. This method is not used in this village. Instead each household deals with its own garbage. Most burn it in a hole in the ground. Non-combustible garbage is buried or disposed at an unmaintained dump site. Religion The village has several masjid, which are not evenly distributed. It has 2 churches, one within the village and one on the outskirts. Health care There are 2 local clinics in the village, one in Pokak and one in Tegal Duwur. Currently they handle minor injuries and diseases. For severe conditions, villagers travel to the city hospital, about 5 km away. Education Two elementary schools are present. Higher level students attend school outside the village. An English and math learning center operates in Tegal Duwur. Economy This area depends on farming. It mainly produces rice and corn and some sugarcane. Most villagers livestock, including breed chickens, ducks, goats, cows and sheep. Livestock are mostly a food reserve. A glimpse of farm in Pokak The youth mostly work as wood crafters. They produce detailed models of living and non-living things. The most notable work is of an elephant, which can be about the same as a baby elephant, or 2 metres tall. In the Tegal Duwur area, most villagers practice woodworking. They are the primary supplier for Yogyakarta and its surrounding region, including the Prambanan Temple Complex. The village itself solely functions as factory, although stores in the outskirt of the village sell the works. =Woodcraft Gallery= Image:Woodcraft 1.jpg Image:Woodcraft 2.jpg Image:Woodcraft in the making.jpg Main attraction Sendang Sinongko, once a popular tourism spot The village had a tourism attraction, Sendang Sinongko, a spring, which was popular as a fishing and bathing spot. It was shut down because of management difficulties. The spring is still used annually as an altar for a major ritual ceremony. It attracts thousands of visitor every year.

He earned a S.B. in physics and interdisciplinary science in 1982, a S.M. in meteorology in 1982, and a Sc.D. in meteorology in 1991, all from MIT. His masters thesis was The Long Range Dispersion of Radioactive Particulates and his doctoral dissertation was Forcing Mechanisms of Thunderstorm Downdrafts. He moved to Boulder, Colorado to work at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and later to Norman, Oklahoma where he was a tenured faculty member at the University of Oklahoma (OU). He founded the Center for Severe Weather Research (CSWR) in 1998, which operates the Doppler On Wheels (DOW) radars. Wurman returned to Boulder in 2001. = Research = Wurman is particularly interested in researching tornadogenesis and amassing sufficient datasets of tornado structure and dynamics observations for tornado climatology study. He is also the discoverer of sub-kilometer hurricane boundary layer rolls, and wrote the pioneering papers on mapping tornado winds, multiple vortices, and other tornado-related phenomena. Joshua Wurman participated in both the VORTEX projects, doing early deployments of the first scraped together DOW radars for VORTEX1 and served on the steering committee and was a principal investigator (PI) for VORTEX2, the field research phase of which occurred from 2009-2010.VORTEX2 Wurman's team observed the top two fastest wind events and two contenders for the largest tornado circulations. He leads the ROTATE (Radar Observations of Tornadoes And Thunderstorms Experiment) tornado observational project every spring and hurricane intercepts in the fall. A current major project of his is studying lake-effect snow in the OWLeS. Dr. Wurman has authored and co-authored many scientific publications relating to hurricane and tornado dynamics and weather radar technology including two articles in Science,Fine-Scale Doppler Radar Observations of TornadoesIntense Sub-Kilometer-Scale Boundary Layer Rolls Observed in Hurricane Fran articles in the Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences, Monthly Weather Review, Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology, Weather and Forecasting, and others. He was lead author of a controversial article in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society analyzing the potential impacts of a major tornado passing through urban areas. A Doppler On Wheels chasing a tornado near Attica, Kansas = Radar innovations = Wurman and his team developed the DOW radars, a new concept of mobile radar, used to observe tornadoes, tropical cyclones, wildfires, winter storms, and other phenomena from close range. He built the first DOW in 1995 from spare parts from NCAR and other facilities and as of March 2014 has built eight DOW units.The DOW Network The success of the DOWs led to a revolution of mobile radars in severe storms and other meteorological field research. Furthermore, they developed meteorological bistatic radar multiple-Doppler networks, and the Rapid-Scan DOW, and holds about several patents related to bistatic and DOW technology.Google Patent Search He founded BINET Inc., manufacturer of Bistatic Networks, in 1995. = National profile = He manages the DOW radar network which is a National Science Foundation (NSF) Lower Atmospheric Observing Facility. His scientific work and DOW projects have been sponsored by NSF, as well as National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the United States Forest Service (USFS), the United States Department of Energy (DOE), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and other agencies of the U.S. government, as well as by The Discovery Channel, and the National Geographic Society, among others. Wurman is a member of the USA Science and Engineering Festival's Nifty Fifty, a collection of the most influential scientists and engineers in the United States that are dedicated to reinvigorating the interest of young people in science and engineering.USA Science & Engineering Festival's Nifty Fifty . In popular culture Wurman has appeared in many television shows and his work, particularly with the DOWs, and is cited in numerous popular and technical books about weather. He is best known to the general public as the \\"scientist\\" in The Discovery Channel's reality series Storm Chasers, where he led a group of storm chasers conducting research during tornado season. CSWR worked with Sean Casey's Tornado Intercept Vehicle (TIV) combining in situ intercept data and photogrammetry work with DOW remote sensing data. His scientific research style is often shown clashing with other chasers who are not government funded. He was also featured on National Geographic Channel's Tornado Intercept and The True Face of Hurricanes, as well as in the IMAX film Forces of Nature. He's also been seen in several other documentaries and shows including those on PBS' Nova and NewsHour,Tornado Science NHK, BBC, History Channel, and The Weather Channel (TWC), and on Dateline NBC, CBS' 48 Hours, Larry King Live, Nightline, and Good Morning America.

Written by Diane Fine and Evan Spiliotopoulos, and produced by Manual Corbi, it was released on July 13, 2004. Plot summary A very famous and expensive painting is stolen from the MNAC art museum in Barcelona, Spain. The museum has many security features that are problematic for the thieves, but because of their skill they are able to circumvent the security and steal the famous El Greco Christ Carrying the Cross on display courtesy of Victor Boyd (Ed Lauter.)http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/art_heist/ After the first heist, Sandra Walker (Ellen Pompeo), is called by her boss Victor Boyd and sent to Spain to ensure his El Greco is returned. Victor Boyd, the owner of the stolen El Greco, is a very rich and powerful businessman who Sandra works for as an art consultant. She is called in to find the stolen El Greco because she persuaded Victor to display it at the MNAC art museum, from which it was ultimately stolen. http://www.reelfilm.com/artheist.htm While getting ready for her trip to Spain to track down the missing El Greco, the audience is given some insight into Sandra‚Äôs life: She is separated from an NYPD detective, Bruce (William Baldwin), and they have a young daughter together, Allison (Madison Goeres) The couple appears to be going through a bit of a rough patch, but still seem to love each other. Sandra is able to convince her husband to watch their daughter while she‚Äôs away. Bruce is skeptical of the whole situation and worried about Sandra‚Äôs well-being. Upon her arrival at the crime scene in Barcelona, Sandra is reunited with an old colleague of hers, Daniel (Abel Folk), who was brought in to consult on the investigation. It quickly becomes apparent these two have a deep history and there are many secret feelings. The two of them make a great team and quickly narrow down the list of suspects to the ruthless Russian mobster Dimitri Maximov (Simon Andreu) Dimitri is portrayed as a questionable individual who seems to be scheming some sort of master plan as the art heists continue. This plays right into Sandra and Daniel‚Äôs suspicion that he is the culprit. Another El Greco is stolen during an auction that both Sandra and Daniel as well as all potential suspect attend. While in the bathroom, Sandra observes one thief escaping. After alerting Daniel, they pursue the suspect through Barcelona but crash into a restaurant. After waking up in the hospital, Bruce and their daughter arrive from New York. Soon after, Sandra‚Äôs life is threatened in a park where she was together with her daughter and husband. The attacker demands that she leave Spain. However, Bruce chases them away and follows them on a motorbike. Although he manages to catch up with one attacker, they eventually flee after knocking him down. However, he managed to see the face of one of them as well as ripping a piece of his clothing which gave him a clue to a night club. When Maximov's yacht gets blown up with all the paintings, the original theory seems confirmed. Several clues point towards Sandra as a main accomplice. However, Sandra‚Äôs partner in the investigation, Daniel, who had been nothing but helpful and affectionate turns out to be the villain in a dramatic ending scene. After Bruce and Sandra discover the paintings in Daniel's studio, Daniel kidnaps their daughter and sets up a meeting at a closed amusement park overlooking the sea where he arrives by helicopter with the last surviving thief (the others having been killed by him to keep his fee to himself). Daniel, in his capacity as an art professor, had been using his students to steal the art under orders from Sandra‚Äôs boss, Victor Boyd. Victor planned to frame Sandra by depositing large amounts of money in her bank accounts to make it appear as though she sold security information to the robbers. As the final scene unfolds and all of this information is revealed to the audience, we ask ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù As it turns out, Daniel was frustrated with his persistent failures as an artist while other artists around him flourished. He participated in this long and carefully thought-out scheme for his own revenge and Victor's promise to help him become famous. At the last moment, Bruce comes to the rescue of his estranged wife and daughter, only to be shot by Victor after subduing Daniel. Although it appeared as though Daniel and Victor were going to make a dramatic helicopter getaway, after Victor explained that he planned to kill Sandra and her daughter, Daniel had a change of heart and tried to protect them from Victor; only to be shot. Right before his death, Daniel passed Bruce his gun and with it Bruce was able to kill Victor. The film ends with Sandra's family reunited.

Art pieces stolen throughout movie Christ Carrying the Crosshttp://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the- collections/150000135 ‚Äì Painted by the famous El Greco (1541 ‚Äì 7 April 1614), this oil painting of Christ during a time of suffering was completed in the year 1595 in Spain. In it, Greco seeks to portray the haunting immediacy and resonant with pathos. Christ‚Äôs willingness to be sacrificed shows his devotion to mankind and can be seen through his gentle grip of the cross as seen here. St. John the Evangelisthttp://www.gojerusalem.com/discover/item_13290/El- Greco-St--John-the-Evangelist--1597%E2%80%931604 ‚Äì Painted by the famous El Greco (1541 ‚Äì 7 April 1614), this oil painting produced in Spain was completed around the year 1604. One of Christ‚Äôs disciples, St. John the EvangelistJohn the Evangelist is depicted here as a handsome young individual at a time of his following to Christ. In his hand is a cup of poison to resemble a liquid acquired from a dragon to symbolize ‚Äòevil emerging‚Äô. His appearance is said to lead viewers to believe that he is a person who has the power to work miracles. This piece of art can be viewed at the (Aaron and B Lima Shickman Old Masters Galleries.)Old Masters Gallery Samson and Delilahhttp://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110000475 ‚Äì Painted by the famous Lucas Cranach (1472 ‚Äì 1553), this oil painting displayed on hard wood is one of many versions of this style of painting. In it, Philistine Delilah is cutting the hair of Samson, which displays the sapping of his strength. You can see Samson is laying his head on Delilah‚Äôs lap motionless due to his weakness. This painting is to warn men of the pitfalls of love and how it could drain one of their powers. It also shows how women are conniving in their ways to draw in men. Old Manhttp://www.wikipaintings.org/en/el-greco/portrait-of-an-old-man-presumed- self-portrait-of-el-greco  Painted by the famous El Greco (1541 ‚Äì 7 April 1614), this oil painting produced in Spain was completed around the year 1604. This Spanish portrait of this old man during the Late Renaissance resembles the stress this time put on many people. Having painted various styles of Christ and other religious figures, Greco this time portrays what seems to be himself as this old man. It is not proven that this is a portrait of Greco, but the characteristics in the face and style of his clothes give good indication that this is a self-portrait of the artist himself. You can find this painting in Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City. Coronation of the Virginhttp://www.wikipaintings.org/en/el-greco/coronation-of-the-virgin-1591-1  Painted by the famous El Greco (1541 ‚Äì 7 April 1614), this oil painting produced in Spain was completed around the year 1591. Scholars have presumed that Greco created the first version of this elaborate painting which displays Christ, Virgin Mary, and God-the-Father. The dove above them symbolizes peace, which through the sacrifice of Christ himself, was what the world would receive in return for his actions. This painting can be found in the Museo del Prado, Madrid. Production The film was produced, filmed, and then released in Spain on July 13, 2004. On 22 March 2005, the film was released to the U.S. and to the rest of the world on DVD.

History Built around 1781, the blockhouse was part of the British colonies defensive network. While protecting both the watermill constructed of stone and the lighthouse built along the Lacolle River, the blockhouse was used as a military outpost by the British Army on assignment in the region of Le Haut-Richelieu Regional County Municipality and on Lake Champlain.Municipality of Saint Paul de L'ile Aux Noix In 1923, the Lacolle Mills Blockhouse was included in the Battle of Lacolle Mills (1814) National Historic Site of Canada.Parks CanadaBattle of Lacolle National Historic Site of Canada In 1960, the blockhouse was designated a cultural heritage building and is entered in the Quebec Cultural Heritage Directory.R√©pertoire du patrimoine culturel du Qu√©bec Structure The Lacolle Mills Blockhouse is a timber framed square two storey structure. The second level floor is cantilevered with a pavilion roof.Canada's Historic Places The blockhouse is built on land that overlooks the Lacolle River. The blockhouse's architecture was typical of a small defensive military structure in the area not requiring significant experience to construct. The blockhouse walls are constructed of squared half timber stacked horizontally. The walls have loopholes, providing the occupant with protection, while firing on the enemy. In the centre of the blockhouse was a stone hearth, which provided heating. The British military constructed over 25 forts of this type in Lower Canada between 1760 and 1840. War of 1812 During the War of 1812, the blockhouse was the location for the Battle of Lacolle Mills (1812) and the Battle of Lacolle Mills (1814). The Battle of Lacolle Mills (1812) was a short engagement in which a small garrison of Canadien Militia, with the assistance of Kahnawake Mohawk warriors, defended the Lacolle Mills Blockhouse from an American invasion force led by Major General Henry Dearborn. In the Battle of Lacolle Mills (1814) a garrison of 80 men of the 13th Regiment of Foot and a Congreve rocket detachment of the Royal Marine Artillery, later reinforced by a company of the Canadian Voltigeurs and the Grenadier company of the Canadian Regiment of Fencible Infantry successfully defended the blockhouse and stone watermill from an attacking American force of 4,000 men led by Major General James Wilkinson.John R.

Examples  =Formation of compound words= In German, the interfix -s- has to be used between certain nouns in compound words, but not all, such as Arbeitszimmer (\\"workroom\\") as opposed to Schlafzimmer (\\"bedroom\\"). This originates from the masculine and neuter genitive singular suffix -s. German has many other interfixes, for example -es, -(e)n-, -er- and -e-. Not all of them originate from the genitive. Likewise, it is often stated that German interfixes originated from plural forms, when in fact German plural forms and linking forms developed parallel to each other and are only partly similar by coincidence.Varsami, Johny. Fugenelemente im Deutschen. Universit√§t Stuttgart, 2008, 15 pp. In Dutch, the interfix -e- (schwa) sometimes can be traced back to the original form of the first part ending in an -e that has been lost in the present day form: zielerust (\\"peace of mind\\") was derived in Middle Dutch from ziele (\\"soul\\") and rust (\\"rest, peace\\"), but in modern Dutch soul is \\"ziel\\". In other compounds the -e- stems from a case suffix: petekind (\\"godchild\\") from peet (\\"godfather\\") and kind (\\"child\\"). The very common interfixes -s- and -en- originally were genitive suffixes. The much less frequent -er- in compounds can be seen as the remnant of an original plural suffix: rundergehakt, \\"ground beef\\" from rund, plural runderen \\"bovine(s)\\". In English, when technical compound words are formed from non-technical roots, an -o- interfix is sometimes used, as o has come to be seen as a connecting vowel (speed-o-meter, mile-o-meter) by analogy to tacho-meter, odo-meter, compounds of which the first part comes from an Ancient Greek noun whose stem includes o. In Swedish, compound nouns are written as one word, and interfixes are very common. -s- is frequently used in this way, as in fabriksarbetare, which consists of fabrik (factory) and arbetare (worker). Examples of other interfixes are -e-, as in when familj and far (family and father) become familjefar, and -a-, when viking and by (viking and village) become vikingaby. However, just like in Norwegian, not all compound words are written with an interfix. For example sten√•lder, which consists of sten (stone) and √•lder (age). Some words ending in a vowel lose the last letter. For example arbetarklass (working class) consists of arbetare (worker) and klass (class). Norwegian is closely related to Swedish and has a similar pattern, but uses interfixing somewhat more moderately. Examples: \\"arbeid\\" + \\"rom\\" = \\"arbeidsrom\\" (workroom), but \\"fabrikk\\" + \\"arbeider\\" = \\"fabrikkarbeider\\" and \\"familie\\" + \\"far\\" = \\"familiefar\\". The most common interfix is -s-, but there are examples with -e-: \\"barn\\" + \\"hage\\" = \\"barnehage\\" (kindergarten), and \\"bj√∏rn\\" + \\"hi\\" = \\"bj√∏rnehi\\" (bear hive / bear's nest). In Serbo-Croatian, interfixes -o- and -e- are obligatory when forming a compound. For example, \\"brod\\" + \\"gradili≈°te\\" = \\"brodogradili≈°te\\" (shipyard), but \\"kuƒáa\\" + \\"pazitelj\\" = \\"kuƒáepazitelj\\" (concierge). Unless an interfix is added, the new-formed word is considered to be a word-joining, such as \\"zimzelen\\" (\\"zima\\" + zelen\\", evergreen). In Russian the most popular interfixes are letters -o- and -e- (Russian letters). for example: the word –ø–∞—Ä–æ–≤–æ–∑ (–ø–∞—Ä-–æ-–≤–æ–∑) ‚Äî \\"parovos\\" (par- o-vos) means locomotive and in English \\"par\\" means steam and \\"vos\\" means cart.

The original building was in the via della Scala, Florence. In 1865 it moved to the Villa del Poggio Imperiale overlooking Florence where it remains in situ today. The school has a Brother establishment in Prato, Collegio Cicognini where such luminaries as Curzio Malaparte and D'Annunzio attended. The school is subdivided into a mixed Elementary, Middle, and Upper School. The Elementary school is an Italian-German school, teaching children in Italian, German and English. The Middle school teaches children predominantly in Italian and English, with the introduction of Latin and the option of Ancient Greek. The Upper School, which is five years, is subdivided into Scientific, Linguistic, and European Classic schools. Students start at 14 years old. The Linguists, focusses on German, Italian and English as well as the core subjects. Whilst the Scientific, promotes the sciences; Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Geology, Philosophy, History. Whereas the European Classic, orientated towards Law, Economics, Italian, German, Ancient Greek and Latin. The boarding is still private but follows the more demanding state curriculum. As rooms are limited within the Medici house boarding is reserved for only for approximately 80 girls. Girls come predominantly from all over Italy but nevertheless, there are few international students. Girls are called \\"Poggioline\\".

In the US state of Michigan, it is a major, , north‚Äìsouth state trunkline highway that runs through the Lower Peninsula. The trunkline is a freeway from the Michigan‚ÄìOhio state line near Lambertville to the city of Standish, and it follows the Lake Huron shoreline from there to its northern terminus. Serving the cities of Ann Arbor and Flint, US 23 acts as a freeway bypass of the Metro Detroit area. Overall, the highway runs through rural areas of the state dominated by farm fields or woodlands; some segments are urban in character in the Ann Arbor, Flint and Tri-Cities areas. The section from Flint north to Standish also carries Interstate 75 (I-75) along a concurrency that includes a segment that carries almost 70,000 vehicles on a daily basis. The first transportation routes along what is now US 23 in the state were sections of two Indian trails. The route of what is now US 23 follows portions of two separate trails. In the early 20th century, four different auto trail names were applied to roads now a part of the highway. These roads were included as part of two state highways in the initial state highway system in 1919. When the United States Numbered Highway System was first designated on November 11, 1926, the new US 23 replaced the other designations along its route. Since creation, the road has been moved and realigned several times. Through the 1930s and 1940s, the lakeshore routing was created to replace a path that ran further inland through the northern portion of the state. Starting in the early 1950s, various sections in the southeastern and central areas of the Lower Peninsula were upgraded to freeways, bypassing several major cities in the area. These improvements were completed by the end of the 1960s. Since then a new crossing of the Saginaw River at Zilwaukee was built to replace a drawbridge that carried the I-75/US 23 freeway over a shipping channel. Various memorial or tourist route designations have been applied to US 23 in the state since the 1980s. The highway has been a part of the Lake Huron Circle Tour since the creation of the Great Lakes Circle Tours in 1986. The non-freeway section was designated the Sunrise Side Coastal Highway by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) in 2004 as a part of what is now the Pure Michigan Byway Program. Since 2009, it has been called the Huron Shores Heritage Route. The highway has also carried two memorial designations related to war veterans and a third related to local civic leaders since a 2001 consolidation of related legislation in the state. MDOT has listed two of the highway's bridges on its historic bridge list, one of which is also on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Future improvements to the route of US 23 include a proposed northerly extension of the freeway from Standish to one of several locations along the Lake Huron shoreline. Another freeway has been proposed in the Flint area that could connect US 23 directly to the south end of I-475. Route description US 23 runs for through the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, serving as a freeway bypass to the west of Metro Detroit and a scenic highway through the northern portion of the state along Lake Huron. Between Flint and Standish, US 23 runs concurrently with I-75; the combined freeway section from Flint to Bay City can contain between six and eight lanes total while the rest of the US 23 freeway is mostly four lanes. Non-freeway segments of US 23 in the state are two lanes. Like other state trunkline highways, it is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). All of US 23 in the state south of the M-32 junction in Alpena has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. From the Standish area north, the highway is also a part of the Lake Huron Circle Tour and the Huron Shores Heritage Route, a Pure Michigan Byway. =Southeastern Michigan= alt=Photograph of the US 23 enters Michigan on a freeway northwest of Toledo, Ohio, concurrent with US 223. This freeway runs north through farm fields in rural western Monroe County near Lambertville. About north of the state line, US 223 leaves the freeway and turns west onto St. Anthony Road; US 23 continues northward on the freeway. South of Dundee, US 23 crosses the River Raisin before coming to an interchange with M-50 next to the Cabela's store west of town. North of town, the freeway passes near an industrial area. Farther north, it crosses a line of the Ann Arbor Railroad near Azalia as the trunkline runs to the east of Milan at the Monroe-Washtenaw county line. North of Milan, the freeway crosses a line of the Norfolk Southern Railway. The landscape takes on a more suburban residential character as the freeway approaches the Ann Arbor area. There are separate interchanges for US 12 (Michigan Avenue) and I-94 on the southeast side of the city. Between I-94 and Washtenaw Avenue, US 23 carries the Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) moniker as well. That secondary designation leaves the freeway and runs west on Washtenaw Avenue into downtown Ann Arbor and the campus of the University of Michigan. At the same interchange, a Business US 23 (Bus. US 23) designation also follows Washtenaw Avenue to the west; east of US 23, M-17 follows Washtenaw Avenue and connects the freeway with Ypsilanti. North of this interchange, US 23 crosses the Huron River near the campus of the local community college and continues north to a junction with the M-14 freeway. The two merge and run westward along the north side of the city before US 23 turns north and M-14 curves south. North of Ann Arbor, the freeway runs through woodlands and near several lakes. In the community of Whitmore Lake, US 23 crosses into Livingston County near the city's namesake body of water. East of Brighton, the freeway intersects I-96 and continues north to an intersection with M-59 south of Hartland. The highway turns northeasterly by Runyon Lake and runs toward the city of Fenton. The trunkline passes through town and bends back toward the northwest, running between lakes Ponemah and Fenton. Continuing north, the environment around US 23 transitions to rural farm fields as the freeway approaches the south side of the Flint area. =Flint and the Tri- Cities area= alt=Photograph showing West of Grand Blanc, US 23 meets I-75, and the two freeways merge near the Bishop International Airport and continue along the west side of the Flint metro area. I-75/US 23 has an interchange with I-69 near the crossing with the Canadian National Railway line. Continuing northwards through suburban residential areas, the highway crosses the Flint River while running along the west side of the city. In Mount Morris Township, the freeway intersects the northern end of I-475 before meeting M-57 near Clio. The highest traffic totals along US 23 in the state of Michigan were recorded by MDOT near the M-57 interchange; in 2009 an average 68,800 vehicles used that section of freeway daily. These traffic counts are expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. Near Birch Run, the highway turns northwesterly next to a large outlet mall. Between here and the Saginaw area, the freeway runs through more wooded lands, crossing the Cass River near Bridgeport. I-75/US 23 enters the Tri-Cities (named for Saginaw, Bay City and Midland) when it bypasses Saginaw to the east. The freeway intersects M-46 in Buena Vista Township south of the junction with I-675. North of downtown Saginaw, the freeway crosses the Saginaw River on the Zilwaukee Bridge, a \\"post-tensioned, segmental, [concrete] box girder bridge\\" that is \\"infamous\\" for a series of \\"construction mishaps, cost overruns, and government foibles.\\" alt=Photograph of Past the bridge, I-75/US 23 meets the northern end of I-675 and continues through fields and woods to the Bay City area. At exit 162, the freeway meets the eastern terminus of US 10 and the western terminus of M-25 west of downtown. The next interchange north is with the Connector M-13 (CONN M-13) freeway, which was the previous northern end of US 23's freeway in Michigan. The connector runs due northward, and I-75/US 23 turns northwesterly to bypass around Kawkawlin. The highway veers north, crosses the Kawkawlin River and the Pinconning Creek before coming to an interchange southwest of Standish. There, US 23 curves east, separating from I-75. US 23 continues for about as a freeway which ends at the intersection with M-13 south of Standish. The lowest AADT along any freeway section of US 23 in Michigan is the section immediately east of I-75; here the traffic levels drop from 20,763 to 4,466 vehicles per day after US 23 separates from I-75. =Northern Michigan= US 23 runs north from the end of its freeway along Huron Road through the community of Standish. The trunkline turns northeasterly through lakeshore woodlands after the intersection with Old M-76. Northeast of this intersection, the highest, non-freeway AADT level on US 23 was recorded by MDOT at 16,757 vehicles daily. Running through Omer, the highway crosses the Rifle River and a line of the Lake State Railway. In between the two crossings, it curves due east on its way out of town. At Hale Road, US 23 meets the southern end of M-65 before it continues east to Au Gres, where it runs along the Saginaw Bay and crosses the Au Gres River. Huron Road meanders northward along the lakeshore, staying inland near Point Lookout. US 23 runs through woods as it follows the Saginaw Bays shoreline northeasterly through Alabaster to Tawas City. The highway intersects the eastern terminus of M-55, runs north and east around Tawas Bay to East Tawas and follows the Lake Huron shoreline to Oscoda. Through this area, US 23 runs parallel to the Lake State Railway and crosses into the Huron National Forest. alt=Photograph of Oscoda is the location of the eastern termini of both the River Road National Scenic Byway and County Road F-41. In between those two junctions, the highway crosses the Au Sable River near its mouth, and the trunkline passes by the former Wurtsmith Air Force Base. Huron Road continues north, running next to Van Etten Lake as it leaves the national forest. Further north, it runs along Cedar Lake when it crosses into Alcona County. The highway meets the eastern termini of F-30 and M-72 in Greenbush and Harrisville respectively. It also passes Harrisville State Park in the latter community. The highway shifts a bit further inland north of Harrisville, continuing to parallel the railroad through the Mackinaw State Forest. Near Ossineke, the trunkline turns back toward the lake, running along the shoreline of Thunder Bay. When US 23 enters Alpena, it follows State Street through town and turns northwesterly on Chisholm Street. The intersection of Chisholm and Washington streets marks the eastern terminus of M-32. Chisholm Street runs along the Thunder Bay River and crosses the river near Lake Besser. The highway leaves town and runs through rural woodlands to the south shore of Long Lake, curving around the eastern side of the lake. Near the northern end of the lake, US 23 crosses into Presque Isle County and runs along the west shore of Grand Lake. At the north end of that lake, the highway turns west along the Lake Huron shoreline near Thompson's Harbor State Park. The trunkline continues to Rogers City where it bypasses town to the south and west, intersecting F-21 and M-68 in the process; Bus. US 23 runs through downtown. On the other side of Rogers City, US 23 runs along the lake past Hoeft State Park and along Hammond Bay before crossing into Cheboygan County. This area had the lowest AADT levels in 2009 at 1,097 vehicles per day. Sign where US 23 crosses the alt=Photograph of th US 23 follows the Lake Huron shoreline through Cheboygan County through woodlands past Cheboygan State Park and Duncan Bay. On the eastern edge of Cheboygan the highway intersects F-05 before following State Street through a commercial district. State Street crosses the Cheboygan River on the Cheboygan Bascule Bridge near the mouth of the river and the dock for the USCGC Mackinaw. On the west side of the river, US 23 meets the northern terminus of M-27 at the intersection with Main Street. State Street continues westerly as C-66 as US 23 turns north on Main Street for a block before resuming west on Mackinaw Avenue. The highway continues along the lake toward Mackinaw City. As it approaches the village, it passes Historic Mill Creek State Park and several motels. At Nicolet Street in town, the highway crosses into Emmet County for the short distance to the highway's national northern terminus at I-75's exit 338. History =Early history= Before Michigan became a state, the first land transportation corridors were the Indian trails. The original Shore Trail ran roughly parallel to the route of the modern US 23 from the Bay City area to Cheboygan. Another section of the current highway followed the Saginaw Trail between Flint and Saginaw. Later, during the auto trail era, the modern US 23 also coincided with the east branch of the Dixie Highway and part of the Lower Peninsula section of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway. The Dixie Highway was created by William S. Gilbreath after he developed the Lincoln Highway. The highway was designed to link the Great Lakes with the Gulf of Mexico, and to commemorate a half century of peace between the North and the South after the American Civil War. At the urging of Governor Woodbridge Ferris, the northern terminus was located at the Straits of Mackinac. The highway had two branches in the Lower Peninsula; the eastern branch followed what later became US 23 north of Standish. The Theodore Roosevelt International Highway was named for former US president Theodore Roosevelt after his death in 1919. Overall, this highway ran from Portland, Oregon, to Portland, Maine, by way of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario. In Michigan, it also followed US 23 north of Standish.. The highway was also part of the East Michigan Pike, designed to be a counterpart of the West Michigan Pike on the other side of the Lower Peninsula. The original route of the East Michigan Pike included a section along the coast of The Thumb between Bay City and Port Huron and used the same route as the Dixie Highway north of Bay City. Backers of this auto trail lost out in terms of name recognition to the Dixie Highway, relegating the East Michigan Pike to the list of failed auto trails.. The southern part of what is now US 23 in the state was also part of the auto trail craze. The Top of Michigan Trail was designated in 1917 from the state line north to the Bay City area, before turning inland along other roadways. The name faded from shortly after the time the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) assigned the first highway numbers in the state.. The first state highways along the US 23 corridor were numbered M-65 from the Ohio line north to the Flint area and M-10 from Flint north to Mackinaw City by July 1, 1919. When originally designated, M-65 was in two sections: the southern segment ran from the Ohio state line north to the Dundee area; the northern section ran between Ann Arbor and Flint by way of Brighton and Fenton. The gap between the two segments was eliminated by the middle of 1926. =United States Numbered Highways= US 23 was commissioned on November 11, 1926, with the debut of the United States Numbered Highway System. The MSHD removed the M-10 and M-65 designations from the highway at the time. As it was originally designated, US 23 crossed into Michigan from Ohio south of Temperance and ran north to Ypsilanti via Ida and Maybee. Once the highway entered Ann Arbor, it followed the roads that preceded the modern freeway up to Flint. From Flint to Saginaw, US 23 ran concurrently with US 10. On the way north to Bay City, the highway ran on the west side of the Saginaw River before turning north to the Standish area. From Standish to Mackinaw City, US 23 initially took a more inland route through the northeastern Lower Peninsula. alt=Map of Starting in 1929, MSHD started updating the route that US 23 followed through the Lower Peninsula. Late that year, the routing was moved to the east side of the Saginaw River, and M-47 was extended along the former course on the west side of the river. During 1930, a set of changes realigned the highway's route through the southeast corner of the state. Near Ida, US 23 was rerouted along M-50 to Dundee and north through Milan to Ann Arbor, bypassing Maybee and Whittaker. US 23 was moved from its inland routing between Omer and Tawas City via Whittemore to follow a shoreline alignment by way of Au Gres along Saginaw Bay around 1932; the former route through Twining and Whittemore became an extension of M-65 and the section from Whittemore east to Tawas City was added to M-55 as a part of these changes. In 1932, US 23 was moved closer to the lakeshore between Spruce and Alpena; the former routing was redesignated M-171. The highway was also moved to a route closer to the lakeshore between Tawas City and Oscoda, with part of the old inland route taking the designation Old US 23. A few years later in 1936, US 23 replaced M-72 between Oscoda and Harrisville and followed a new roadway north to the Spruce area. The M-171 designation was removed from its original routing and applied to the 1932 routing of US 23 by way of Mikado and Lincoln. In the middle of 1937, US 27 was extended concurrently along US 23 between Cheboygan and Mackinaw City. Around the end of the decade, US 23's routing was moved in another location to follow the lakeshore; this time the highway was rerouted between Alpena and Rogers City. M-65 was extended northwards from Lachine through Posen to terminate over the former US 23 routing. US 23 was moved to its current lakeshore routing between Rogers City and Cheboygan in 1940, and M-33 was extended westerly from Onaway to Afton and north to Cheboygan over the former US 23 roadway while M-68 was extended eastward through Onaway to Rogers City. In early 1941, a bridge across the Saginaw River connecting Salzburg and Lafayette avenues in Bay City was added to the route of US 23 in the city; at the same time the former routing was redesignated Bus. US 23. The highway was also realigned between Hartland and Fenton in 1941. By 1945, the northernmost segment of M-65 in downtown Rogers City was redesignated Bus. US 23, and M-65 was truncated to its junction with US 23 southeast of town, removing the concurrency that existed since 1940. North of Dundee, a more direct alignment to Azalia was added to US 23, turning the former routing back to local control in late 1947 or early 1948; at the same time, the last gravel section of the highway was paved near Hammond Bay in northwestern Presque Isle County. =Freeway conversion= alt=Photograph of the building that houses the One of the first pieces of what would later become part of US 23's freeway route was completed in late 1951 or early 1952, when a two-lane bypass was built around the eastern side of Milan. Two years later, a similar bypass was built from Bridgeport to M-81 on the east side of Saginaw, with the old route becoming a Bus. US 23 designation. Both bypasses would later be upgraded to four-lane freeways by 1961, with the Saginaw one later incorporated into the route of I-75. When the Mackinac Bridge opened on November 1, 1957, US 23, US 27 and US 31 were extended along the access roadways to the foot of the bridge. The first future freeway portion of US 23 was built in 1957 from north of Ann Arbor to Whitmore Lake as a divided highway. On June 30, 1958, the first stretch of the \\"Fenton‚ÄìClio Expressway\\" opened, stretching from Fenton to Birch Run. The freeway connection from Dundee south to Ohio was opened on October 1, 1959. In late 1959, the portion from Flint to Birch Run also gained the I-75 designation. In late 1960 or early 1961, a new I-75/US 10/US 23 freeway was built from the north end of the Saginaw bypass to Kawkawlin, utilizing the Zilwaukee drawbridge (later replaced by the Zilwaukee Bridge) over the Saginaw River; when it opened, MSHD extended M-13 along the former route of US 23 from the northside of Saginaw into Bay City to the end of the freeway at Kawkawlin. Another section connected the Whitmore Lake area with Brighton in the same timeframe. General Motors was bidding in 1961 to construct an electronic highway. US 23 between Ann Arbor and Toledo was under consideration to be the location of this project; the testing for such a roadway was ultimately done at Ohio State University instead. By the end of the year, freeway sections opened to bypass Saginaw south and ran south to Birch Run, another connected south from Fenton to Hartland, and a third connected Milan with Dundee. The remaining gaps were eliminated with additional freeway openings in 1962: Brighton to Hartland opened in September, and Milan to Ann Arbor opened in November. The I-75/US 23 freeway north of the Kawkawlin area to Standish opened in 1967, and M-13 was shown on maps following US 23's former route through Linwood and Pinconning after the change. alt=Photograph of the roadsigns at the The MSHD requested additional Interstate Highway mileage in 1968 under the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968 including a freeway along US 23 between Standish and Mackinaw City. This extension was rejected by Congress on December 13, 1968; instead, Michigan was allotted additional mileage for an extension of I-69 to Flint. Once the last piece of I-75 was completed along the M-76 corridor in November 1973, the I-75 designation was extended north of Bay City on US 23. The MSHD first proposed a realignment of US 223 in 1965; this change would reroute that highway to replace M-151 in southern Monroe County, and use the US 23 freeway to connect to Sylvania, Ohio. The rerouting change was made in 1977 when Michigan shifted its segment of US 223 as proposed twelve years prior. Instead of running south through Ottawa Lake, US 223 continued east to the US 23 freeway and south into Ohio. The original bridge across the Saginaw River at Zilwaukee was built in 1960 as a bascule bridge to allow shipping traffic to use the river. Opening the drawbridge would back traffic up on I-75/US 10/US 23 for upwards of four hours on holiday weekends.. Approved in 1974, construction on the replacement bridge started in October 1979. A major construction accident in August 1982 delayed completion of the new Zilwaukee Bridge; a bridge pier partially collapsed when contractors overloaded a section under construction. The affected deck segment tilted to rest higher on one end and lower on the other. The structure was originally supposed to cost $76.8 million with a 1983 completion date; in the end it cost $131.3 million (equivalent to $ in ) when the southbound span finally opened on September 19, 1988. The structure is the largest segmental concrete bridge in the country. While that construction was being done, MDOT truncated US 10 at Bay City in 1986; this removed the concurrency between US 10 and US 23 that existed since 1926. A few years later in 1992, the freeway concept for the northeastern LP was revived again when MDOT initiated plans to study and build a new US 23 freeway from Standish northerly to Tawas City, Oscoda or Alpena. This proposal was brought up due to a high level of tourist traffic along the current routing since the mid-1960s. The FHWA mandated additional environmental studies for the project in 2000, and MDOT withdrew the proposals two years later. In November 2016, construction work on a $92 million project began on the freeway between Ann Arbor and Whitmore Lake. This construction includes replacement of bridges and reconstruction of off ramps. A year later, the flex route system opened, using intelligent traffic management and electronic signs to monitor and redirect traffic. The system can open a temporary travel lane on the inner shoulder during rush hour. The flex route project was nationally recognized by American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) in 2018 for Operations Excellence. A $150 million extension to the interchange with I-96 is scheduled to begin in 2023 and be completed the following year. Future Officials in the Flint area have proposed extending a freeway to directly connect I-475 to US 23. Such an extension, if built, would \\"include a new freeway coming out of I-475, which would snake across Fenton and Cook roads before connecting into US 23 at Baldwin Road\\". Proposals for the freeway connection have been around since the late 1990s, but they were indefinitely postponed in 2011. Memorial highway designations and tourist routes Most of US 23, along with US 2 in the Upper Peninsula, has been designated the United Spanish War Veterans Memorial Highway. The designation was conferred in Public Act 207 of 1945, with companion legislation for US 2 in 1949. Signs marking the highway were not erected until 1968 when Governor George W. Romney had them installed.. North of Standish, US 23 is a part of the Lake Huron Circle Tour (LHCT). This tour was created in May 1986 as part of the overall Great Lakes Circle Tour through a joint effort between MDOT and its counterparts in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Ontario. When the Michigan State Legislature consolidated the statutes defining the various memorial highways in 2001, they included the Veterans of World War I Memorial Highway in the law. Defined along I-75/US 23 between Saginaw and Bay City, the designation was included in Public Act 142.. That act also affected another previously designated moniker between the two cities. The Roberts-Linton Highway was named in 1931 for local leaders who championed the construction of a highway along the Saginaw River. This name was applied to the original highway routing between Saginaw and Bay City (now a part of M-13). After the 2001 change, the name was moved to the US 23 freeway.. In May 2004, the highway north of Standish was named the Sunrise Side Coastal Highway, a scenic highway designation through what is now called the Pure Michigan Byway Program. Since 2009, they local committee that manages the byway designation has started using the Huron Shores Heritage Route name for the corridor. At the end of 2011, the Northeast Michigan Council of Governments (NEMCOG) was working on funding a tourist promotion called \\"Telling Stories of the Sunrise Coast\\" through the US 23 Heritage Route Interpretive Program. Past efforts by NEMCOG included print media, logos, and other marketing efforts. Historic bridges MDOT maintains a listing of the historic bridges in the state; along US 23, the department has listed two structures. The bridge over the Ocqueoc River in Ocqueoc Township in Presque Isle County was built in 1937. The structure is one of the last three deck truss bridges in the state.. The roadway on the bridge is wide and carries two lanes of traffic. The bridge was reconstructed in 1994. alt=Photograph in Cheboygan of The second bridge is the Cheboygan Bascule Bridge in Cheboygan. This bascule bridge was built in 1940 over the Cheboygan River as the last of its kind before World War II. It was built as a \\"two-leaf bridge in a place where a single-leaf bridge probably would have sufficed.\\" The initial construction of the structure was delayed when the contractor died, but it was completed in December 1940. It was the second moveable bridge on the site, replacing an iron swing bridge built in 1877. The structure is long, composed of two spans on either side of the central span; the roadway is wide with four lanes for vehicle traffic. There are also pedestrian sidewalks on either side of the roadway. When the bridge is opened to allow river traffic to pass, boats have a channel for navigation. The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 1, 2000, and reconstructed in 2003.

The station was between Kaitoke and Cross Creek stations on the Wairarapa Line. The station was bypassed when the Rimutaka Tunnel was opened. Summit had no platform or other passenger facilities, did not consign goods or otherwise serve any settlement save for the railway staff based there, and had no road access at any time during its operation.  History  = Construction = Construction of Summit station was covered by the Summit Contract for the Rimutaka Incline. Seven tenders were submitted for the work, with the contract being let to Messrs. Collie, Scott and Wilkinson for the sum of ¬£18,701. It was expected that the contract would be completed between 12 July 1874 and 22 July 1876, and covered the station yard, drainage works and Summit Tunnel. The yard was formed by cutting a terrace into the hillside, with the excavated fill being dumped on the opposite side of the yard. Further ground was levelled in the hillside above the yard on which houses were built. Over time, further ground was filled in on which to extend the yard and tracks. Once the yard had taken shape, work started on the tunnel, which was originally known as Rimutaka Tunnel. It was to be approached through a cutting six chains long and up to 60 feet deep. The line started out at a gradient of 1 in 1,000 on entering the tunnel for 12 chains, 1 in 300 for 11 chains, then got progressively steeper at 1 in 92, 44, 20 and exited the tunnel at 1 in 15. The tunnel had a horseshoe cross-section, with the apex being at 15 feet. Six weeks into the contract and the approaches to the Wellington end of the yard had been excavated to a depth of 10 feet for about six chains, a depth that had to be increased later. At the Wairarapa end of the workings, the approach cutting to the tunnel had been completed and about 40 feet of the tunnel driven. In December 1874, on learning of the slow progress the contractors were making on the tunnel, the Government made the first of many complaints, which seemed to have the desired effect. The Evening Post, a critic of the railway, reported in the following March that work was proceeding rapidly and satisfactorily. The following June, work on the tunnel was proceeding at about a chain a month, little faster than before. It would not be until March 1877 before the two headings met. The Public Works Department later lined the tunnel after the rails reached Summit so work trains could be used to bring in supplies. The Summit Contract was finally completed on 10 December 1877, 17 months late. = Operations = Platelaying was completed from four miles north of Upper Hutt to Summit between October 1877 and March 1878. Summit yard originally had a simple layout, but increasing traffic brought about additions. The final extended layout was reached in 1903, when full signalling and interlocking was introduced. Although Summit had an engine shed until the 1920s, it seems doubtful whether locomotives were ever based there. It had a water service but no coal supply. Being at the top of the Rimutaka Ranges, Summit had an unenviable reputation with regard to its climate. It was often subject to strong winds and high rainfall. Railway staff based there relied on the trains to supply all their needs. As best as can be determined, the layout of the yard on the commencement of operations in 1878 consisted of the main line, two loops, a short siding from the main line on the north side and a siding to a small engine shed opposite. The capacity of the loops was 33 and 17 wagons respectively, and on the sidings, four and eight wagons. In the early 1880s, safety sidings were laid at both ends of the yard, and in 1898 more sidings were provided. Increasing traffic levels prompted a major reorganisation of the yard in 1903, with the north end extended and a new approach curve established, more sidings laid, and mechanical interlocking installed with a new signal box for the lever frame and associated equipment. There was never any station building; the only structures on site being the signal box, five or six houses, and a locomotive shed until the late 1920s. In later years, a larger ashpit, turntable and 15,000 gallon water tank were installed. Summit was one of the first stations on the Wairarapa Line to receive signals, with their being first listed in the working timetable of 1887. Instructions for the crossing of trains laid down that southbound trains were to take the siding or loop, and northbound trains were to take the main line. The safety sidings had ground discs to indicate the position of the points, and both ends of the yard were protected by home signals. The signals in use at the time were of the slotted post semaphore type. In 1903 when the yard was reorganised, the old slotted post signals were replaced with balance- arm semaphore signals. Summit had a fully interlocked 27-lever frame. The final train to pass through Summit was a Carterton Show Day excursion, on the evening of Saturday 29 October 1955. The station, and the line over the Rimutaka Ranges were closed by the following day while work proceeded on preparing the Rimutaka Tunnel and deviation for opening for traffic. Most of the rail between Summit and Cross Creek was removed by March 1956, and the buildings were sold on-site for removal.  Today  Summit station yard is now part of the Rimutaka Rail Trail, a public walking/cycling track that was opened on 1 November 1987. A small shelter shed was erected, and picnic facilities provided. There are the remains of some locomotives on display at the northern end of the yard, where the turntable pit can also be seen. A row of large pine trees has been planted on the downward side of the yard. The original approach curve to the northern end of the yard can still be seen.  Future  The Rimutaka Incline Railway, a project of the Rimutaka Incline Railway Heritage Trust to reinstate and operate a heritage railway on the original Wairarapa Line formation between Maymorn and Featherston, plans to incorporate Summit yard in its operations, including a new station building, turntable and marshalling yards. Though the trust has already participated in tree planting work at the Summit site and Summit operations are included in Stage 1 of the project, any operation at the site is some years away as a great deal of work remains to establish the Maymorn site and obtain permission to use the railway formation before construction commences. However, local authorities are against closing down the existing Rimutaka Rail Trail to public use, though the Trust does have plans to create a new walk way alongside their reinstatement.

See the text of D'Ilario (1984) on p. 186. in Western Lombard) is an Italian river belonging to the Po Basin, long, that runs through the Province of Varese and Metropolitan City of Milan whose course is developed entirely in Lombardy. The river born at 548 m s.l.m. in the Fornaci della Riana locality at the Rasa of Varese, at the Sacro Monte di Varese, within the Campo dei Fiori regional park. After crossing the Valle Olona and crossing the Alto Milanese, the Olona reaches Rho where it pours part of its water into the Canale Scolmatore Nord Ovest. After passing Pero, the river enters in Milan, where, at the exit of its underground route, it flows into the Lambro Meridionale, that flows into the Lambro at Sant'Angelo Lodigiano, in the quartier of San Cristoforo ending its course. Along the way, the water system formed by the Olona and the Lambro Meridionale crosses or laps 45 towns receiving the water of 19 tributaries. The Olona is known for the waterfalls and caves of Valganna and for having been one of the most polluted rivers in Italy. The valley carved by the river, thanks to the system of water wheels that exploited the driving force originated by the water, was one of the cradles of Italian industrialization. The Olona river consortium (it. \\"Consorzio del fiume Olona\\"), that is founded in 1606, is the oldest irrigation consortium in Italy. The river is sometimes also referred to as \\"northern Olona\\" for the homonymy with another Olona, who was born in Bornasco and flows into the Po after having crossed the Province of Pavia. This second Olona, in turn, is designated as \\"inferior\\" or \\"southern\\". The homonymy is not of imitative or etymological origin, but it is due to the fact that originally it was two trunks of the same river, diverted by the ancient Romans in its upper stretch towards Milan to bring water to the moat of the defensive walls of the city.  Physical geography  = The sources = The Olona still stream at the Rasa of Varese The principal source of the Olona is in the Fornaci della Riana locality, at the Rasa of Varese, part of the homonymous provincial capital, at the Sacro Monte di Varese, within the Campo dei Fiori regional park. The Fornaci della Riana owe their name to some ancient limestone furnaces that remained active until 1972. In addition to the main source, the river also flows from five other small springs, two in Val di Rasa and three in Valganna; these springs give rise to two branches joining downstream from Bregazzana (fraction of Varese). Map of Olona, Olona meridionale and Lambro Meridionale The branch that is born to the west, in Val di Rasa, is the most important; the two springs that originate this waterway are located at the Varr√≤ pass (between Monte Legnone and Monte Pizzella) and on Monte Chiusarella. The main source, and the one located at the Varr√≤ pass, join upstream from the inhabited area of the Rasa di Varese, while the spring that flows from Monte Chiusarella flows into the Olona downstream. The branch of the Valganna, which is located to the east, was born instead south of Monte Martica. The branch of the Rasa is fed by seven small tributaries (more precisely, the torrents Legnone, Grassi, Boccaccia, Brasch√©, Pissab√≤, Valle del Forno and Sesnini), while the branch of Valganna is increased by four torrents (the Margorabbia, Valfredda, Valpissavacca and Pedana della Madonna). The Valganna branch also gives rise to the Fonteviva lake, dedicated to sport fishing, and to the Valganna waterfalls, which in winter, due to the harsh climate, are often frozen. They are found in the municipality of Induno Olona and are close to the famous and homonymous caves. On the waterfalls, which were artificially created at the beginning of the 20th century to improve water withdrawal, one can admire the phenomenon of travertine surfacing. = The path = The Olona river in Nerviano After the initial stretch, the river begins to travel the valley of the same name, the Valle Olona. This valley originated from the Olona and the retreat of the glaciers during the last ice age; it looks like a valley deeply engraved with the inhabited centers located on the hills overlooking the river bed, the so-called pianalti. The slopes are mostly covered with woods, while in the valley bottom there are cultivated areas, meadows and heaths. The main tributary on Olona in the province of Varese is the Bevera; other important tributaries of this stretch of the river are the Vellone, the Gaggiolo (also called Rio Lanza, Ranza, Anza or Clivio), the Quadronna, the Selvagna, the Mornaga, the Riale delle Selve and the Tenore. In Gorla Minore the river branches off into the Olonella, which joins the main riverbed after 1200 m. In this stretch, many artificial canals are born in the service of agriculture and of the industries that re-enter the Olona before Castellanza. After passing Castellanza, the waterway leaves the Valle Olona and heads towards the Po Valley. Once there was also another natural branch which was indicated by the name of Olonella and which crossed Legnano passing behind the basilica of San Magno. The natural island that was formed by the two branches of the river was known as \\"Archbishop Braida\\". This legnanese branch was buried in the first part of the 20th century.See the two topographies of Legnano (dated 1925 and 1938) which are present in the text of D'Ilario on p. 352 and on p. 353. The birth of the Lambro Meridionale in Milan: part of the water of the Naviglio Grande, to the left of the photo, join those of the Olona After crossing San Lorenzo (fraction of Parabiago) and Nerviano, the Olona river receives its two main tributaries, the Bozzente and the Lura, at Rho. In Rho there is also the \\"deviator of the Olona\\", completed in the eighties of the twentieth century, which flows into Lambro Meridionale. This work has always been a source of controversy: on the one hand it has not avoided all the floods as it was designed and, on the other hand, it carries polluted water towards the Ticino. In November 2002, in particular climatic conditions, the Olona, the Seveso, the spillway and the Ticino overflowed. From Lucernate (fraction of Rho) onwards the river no longer flows into the natural riverbed, but follows the path deviated by the ancient Romans towards the Bozzente. Entering Pero, after an initial stretch still outdoors, the Olona begins to flow under the road surface and reaches Milan by first crossing the Gallaratese, Lampugnano and QT8 districts, where it collects the water of the Merlata river (also called Fugone), to then skirt the southern slope of Monte Stella. Once in Piazza Stuparich it receives the confluence of the Pudiga (known as Mussa in his Milanese section). Merlata and Pudiga are the water collectors that come from the area north of Milan, the so-called \\"groane\\". The Olona then runs along the Lampugnano and San Siro districts, and then continues under the avenues of the ring road bypass. The path under the ring road, which was designed for the first time on the General Plan of Milan in 1884 (the so-called Piano Beruto), was channeled in the first two decades of the 20th century and covered in a period from 1950 to 1970. At the exit from this covered stretch, after passing under the Naviglio Grande, the Olona ends its course flowing into the Lambro Meridionale. Until the entry into operation of the water purification system of Milan (2005), the Lambro Meridionale was a drain collector which collected the results of the western part of the city sewerage system. Subsequently, these sewage were diverted to the purifiers of San Rocco and Nosedo. From the same unloader, the Lambro Meridionale has its \\"clean source\\". = The basin = The Olona in Malnate The Olona is long and has a drainage basin of . The drainage basin of the Olona extends over part of the province of Varese, the Metropolitan City of Milan and, to a lesser extent, province of Como, also affecting part of Switzerland. A small part of the Gaggiolo basin, its tributary, in fact belongs to the Canton Ticino. With its , the Olona drainage basin occupies 5% of the Lombardy area and hosts approximately 1,000,000 inhabitants (which corresponds to around 10% of the residents in the region). The catchment area of Olona instead measures 370 km¬≤. Any hydrographic engineers describe the Olona and the Lambro Meridionale as a single stream that flows into the Lambro at Sant'Angelo Lodigiano and which has an overall length of . = The original bed and the two Olona = The \\"Southern\\" Olona near Genzone One of the most important studies on hydrography of Milan was carried out by engineer Felice Poggi. In 1911 Poggi affirmed that the two Olona, the one that flows into the Lambro Meridionale and the stream that flows into the Po at San Zenone al Po, constituted until the first years of the Common Era a single river that had a total length of . This hypothesis has also been confirmed by subsequent studies. The place where the river was diverted to Milan by the ancient Romans is Lucernate, a fraction of Rho. From here, to find the ancient bed of the Olona following the minimum undulations and the very small altimetric variations of the terrain, we arrive at Cascina Olona (a locality of Settimo Milanese; the toponym is indicative), in Baggio and in Corsico, with a possible variant that from Settimo Milanese would lead to Muggiano and Trezzano sul Naviglio (or Cesano Boscone). In the neighboring towns of Cesano Boscone, Corsico and Trezzano sul Naviglio, all three of which rise on the Naviglio Grande, it is possible to identify two waterways that could flow - towards the south - into the ancient natural riverbed of the Olona to Binasco: at Trezzano sul Naviglio and Cesano Boscone would be the Belgioioso canal, while in Corsico would be the Vecchia roggia. From Binasco, with the derivation of the Canale Ticinello, we arrive then a little further south, in the territory of Lacchiarella, where the Colombana and Carona irrigation channels bring water to the irrigation network giving rise to the Roggione. The Roggione, when at the Settimo di BornascoRegional Technical Map 1: 10,000 Milan-Pavia. receives the Olonetta canal, changes its name to lower or Olona. The Olonetta, together with the Misana canal, comes from a fountain in Misano Olona, a few kilometers upstream. Taking the old course and its name, the southern Olona flows into the Po at San Zenone al Po. The two Olona do not have an autonomous hydrography: at Rozzano, from the Lambro Meridionale, a branch take off towards the south-west, gaining vigor thanks to the water supply provided by springs and artificial canals. This stream then flows into the southern Olona. The reconnection of the two Olona is being planned with the construction of an artificial riverbed that would resume the ancient course of the river. = The detour to Milan = Schematic map of 1870 depicting the hydrography of Milan with the water courses, both natural and artificial, that crossed the city Until ancient Roman times, at La Maddalena, today's quartier of Milan, the Olona was diverted towards the city with the aim of bringing water to it: in ancient Roman times it flowed into the moat of the republican defensive walls of the city of Mediolanum then, from the 12th century, in the defensive moat around the medieval walls and later (1603) in the Darsena of Porta Ticinese. In particular Olona river, during the Middle Ages, flowed into the moat of medieval defensive walls of the city in correspondence of the modern Piazza della Resistenza Partigiana, while in ancient Roman times it continued the city route reaching the modern Piazza Vetra, where it poured its water into the moat of Roman walls thanks to the homonymous canal, the Canale Vetra. The Cerchia dei Navigli then originated from the medieval moat of walls, while the two branches of the Roman moat became the Grande Sevese and the Piccolo Sevese, two canals still existing today in the Milan underground. The Milanese stretch of the Olona corresponds to the ancient natural beds of two streams, Bozzente and Pudiga. Before the deviation of the Olona towards Milan the Pudiga stream, after having lapped on the western side of the city, continued south following its natural bed, corresponding to what is now called Lambro Meridionale, which ended its course, like the ancient Pudiga, in the Lambro near Sant'Angelo Lodigiano. Originally, at the height of the inhabited center of Milan, the Pudiga made a wide bend towards the east, which led it to touch the city at the height of the modern Piazza Vetra, near the natural and ancient bed of the Nirone stream, and then bend towards the south following the bed of the modern Lambro Meridionale. Originally, on its hydrographic left, the Pudiga, in place of the Olona, received the Bozzente stream. The Bozzente originally had in fact an autonomous natural bed that led him to collect the water of the Lura stream and the Merlata stream and then flow into the Pudiga. As already mentioned, it was the ancient Romans who diverted the Olona to Lucernate, a quartier of Rho, in the bed of Bozzente and then to the Pudiga riverbed. The Milanese stretch of the Olona therefore corresponds to the ancient natural beds of Bozzente and Pudiga. The new artificial riverbed of the Olona was then excavated from scratch only for a short distance: having reached the modern Lucernate at the Bozzente stream, the designers widened their bed to accommodate a greater water flow. thumbThe south-western basin of the Darsena of Milan, which connects the Naviglio Grande with the Pavese one (their entrances into the Darsena can be seen on the right: in the foreground is that of the Naviglio Grande, in the background the entrance to the Naviglio Pavese) . At the bottom, frontally, one recognizes the entrance of the Cavo Ticinello, which has the function of a drainage channel of the Darsena. For centuries the Darsena di Porta Ticinese was the mouth of the Olona As the final destination of the new Olona route, the moat of Milan's Roman walls was chosen, where it poured its water into the Canale Vetra (name given by the ancient Romans to the final stretch of the Nirone natural bed) at the height of the modern and homonymous piazza: to achieve this goal, the ancient Romans extended and enlarged the Vetra canal towards the aforementioned Pudiga natural meander so as to also collect the Olona water. With the deviation of the Olona towards the wall of the city, the water continuity of the ancient bed of the Pudiga disappeared, whose southern section (the future \\"Lambro Meridionale\\") was intercepted remaining devoid of clean water, which came from the north, thus becoming in a sewer collector. Until 1704Daniel Stopendal \\"Thesaurus Antiquitarum Instoriarum Italiae, Leida, 1704 the river had only one terminal arm, while on a map of 1722Giuseppe Filippini, Iconografia del Castello e della citt√† di Milano, 1722 it is reported that the Olona forked into two almost parallel branches that met before entering Darsena of Milan: the Olona Nuova (en. \\"New Olona\\"), that is the northern one that later will be called roggia Molinara, and the Olona Vecchia (en. \\"Old Olona\\"), that it was the southern one. The Molinara canal was then buried at the end of the 19th century before the river was channeled.Map of Milan, Artaria Sacchi, 1904 The so-called \\"Brera island\\", which was located between the present-day Via George Washington and Via Vincenzo Foppa, had a longer life. Originated from another fork in the river, it took its name from the homonymous farmhouse that once stood there. It is still marked in a paper from 1925.IGM, Map of Milan, July 1925 In this context, in 1894, Canottieri Olona was founded, a multi-sports club in Milan, winner of an Italian men's water polo championship, based in the Darsena of Porta Ticinese. In 1919, as part of the complex hydrophobic revision of Milan, the channels of the current Olona route began to be built, which involved the deviation of part of the river's water towards the Lambro Meridionale passing through the outer ring road. However, the branch that led to the Darsena was maintained. The detour to the latter took place in Piazza Tripoli: here there was a lock that diverted the river by Via Roncaglia, starting what was called the \\"Darsena branch\\". In the two dry periods of the Navigli annual, the sluice was maneuvered in such a way as to completely close the Darsena branch causing the entire flow of the Olona water to flow into Lambro Meridionale. The Lambro Meridionale, which at the time was a veritable sewer collector, was also known as \\"Lambro Merdario\\" (en. \\"Shiter Lambro\\"). The new channeled route, which was also envisaged by the Beruto Plan of 1884, the first regulatory plan of Milan, did not come into operation until the early 1930s. The first covering carried out in Milan on the course of the Olona occurred in 1935 on part of the Darsena branch (from Via Valparaiso to Viale Coni Zugna), when instead of the cattle station of the railways that stood there was built the Solari Park. The remaining part of the Darsena branch, and the canalized section along the ring road, were instead covered between 1950 and 1970. With the passing of the years, and with the increasing pollution of the river, the sluice of piazza Tripoli was not maneuvered only to divert the flow of water during the dry of the Navigli: at first it considerably reduced the flow of the Darsena branch and, at the end of the eighties of the 20th century, it was resetted for \\"hydrogeological risk and danger of pollution\\" of the Darsena and the water that came out for irrigation or navigation purposes.  Origins of the name  Olona river in Legnano There are three hypotheses on the origin of the toponym Olona. The first supposes that the name of the river is connected to the Celtic root , which means \\"large\\", \\"valid\\" in reference to the use of its water. The second conjecture hypothesizes that the name derives from the ancient Greek \\"oros\\" (·ΩÑœÅŒøœÇ), which means \\"relief\\", \\"mountain\\". The last hypothesis supposes instead that the toponym of the water course is connected to a Milanese monastery founded in the 8th century that was known as Aurona. The latter name perhaps derives, in turn, from the name of the founder of the convent, as well as sister of the archbishop of Milan Theodorus II, \\"Aurona\\" (or \\"Orona\\"). In the latter case, the opposite has also been hypothesized, namely that the name of the monastery derives from the name of the river. Other toponyms that were used during the history to refer to the Olona are Ollona (appeared in a document dated 737 AD), Oleunda (1033), Orona (mid-16th century) and Olonna (reported in 1688 on the Ravenna Cosmography). Instead, as far as local toponyms are concerned, it was assumed that Lonate Pozzolo and Lonate Ceppino derive from \\"Olona\\" (from \\"Olona\\" to \\"Lonate\\").  History  Since ancient times, the inhabitants of the Valle Olona lived mainly away from the river, on higher ground that certainly would not have been hit by seasonal floods. From the archaeological findings found, it can be deduced that the Valle Olona was - already in antiquity - a significant communication route. The water of the Olona have been used for centuries by the local population to irrigate the fields, for fishing, for the breeding of livestock, to move the wheels of water mills and, with the industrialization of its banks, to operate the hydraulic turbines serving the establishments. = From prehistory to the Middle Ages = Fragment of a bell-shaped vase connected to the culture of Remedello and dating back to the III millennium BC: it is the oldest archaeological find found in Legnanese The oldest prehistoric finds found in the areas around the natural Olona riverbed are bos primigenius bones dating back to the W√ºrm glaciation. Unearthed in Legnano in the locality of Costa San Giorgio, they are kept in the Museo civico Guido Sutermeister. As for the presence of man, the oldest finds discovered around the river have been found in the area of the springs. The Lake Varese was in fact frequented, between 4300 BC and 800 BC, from a palatificula civilization. According to some authors, part of these populations, following a demographic increase, migrated south settling along the Valle Olona. Further downstream, between 1926 and 1928, near the border between Castellanza and Legnano, an artifact dating back to a period between 3400 BC and the 2200 BC came to light It is a small fragment of a bell-shaped vase that was made in the Copper Age and that can be connected to the Remedello culture. It was found during construction work on the Bustese highway 527 in the \\"Paradiso\\" quartier of Castellanza. This furniture is also kept in the Museo civico Guido Sutermeister. The ruins late imperial of the ancient Castelseprio Further down the valley, archaeological finds belonging to Canegrate culture have been discovered. During the excavations, 165 tombs dating from the 13th century BC were identified that are referable to the recent Bronze Age The culture of Canegrate, which has an importance that goes beyond local boundaries, developed up to the Iron Age. The chronologically later furnishings, two bronze spearheads linked to the archaic Golasecca culture and always found in Legnano, date back to between the 9th and 8th centuries BC (early Iron Age). Along the Olona were also discovered other finds that belong to the Golasecca culture; these furnishings, which are more recent than those previously mentioned, date back to the 6th-5th century BC. The archaeological findings found along the Olona then become more and more frequent as they approach the ancient Roman conquest of the Po valley. Among them, numerous finds stand out which are connected to the La T√®ne culture and which were brought to light along the lower Valle Olona. Even after the ancient Roman conquest, it took some time for the Romanization of the Valle Olona to take place; during this phase, a Celts-Roman cultural dualism coexisted. The complete Romanization of the Valle Olona occurred during the 1st century BC; after this phase, along the banks of the river, the findings of archaeological finds became more and more frequent. This abundance of furnishings continued for another two centuries, that is, until the crisis of the 3rd century AD, when a dramatic decline occurred. In Roman times, the shores of the Olona assumed significant importance due to their strategic position with respect to the communication routes between the Po valley and the Alps. In the 1st century AD, along the route drawn by the course of the river, an ancient Roman road was built, the via Severiana Augusta, which connected Mediolanum (modern Milan) with the Verbanus Lacus (Lake Maggiore), and from here to the Simplon Pass (lat. Summo Plano). The stretch of river that followed this road was channeled: there are those who hypothesize that it was this work that promoted the deviation of the Olona towards Milan. The eastern part of the castle of Legnano. On the left, the Olona river The road built by the ancient Romans along the river kept its strategic importance even in the Middle Ages. This transit route always came from the Valle Olona connecting Milan to the northwest of Lombardy. The Olona river maintained its strategic importance for another reason over the centuries: the river was a precious source of provisioning due to the presence, along its course, of numerous water mills. The latter continued to be strategic even in the following centuries thanks to their use for agricultural purposes. In fact, the ground wheat in these mills provided food for tens of thousands of inhabitants. In 1176 the banks of the river were theater of the decisive phases of the battle of Legnano. The Carroccio, escorted by hundreds of knights, was placed along an escarpment flanking the Olona with the aim of having a natural defense on at least one side. The decision to place the Carroccio in Legnano was not fortuitous. At the time the village of Milan represented, for those coming from the north, the gateway to the Milanese countryside: this passage had to be closed and strenuously defended to prevent the attack on Milan. For this reason, in Legnano, the Castle Visconteo was later built on a natural island of Olona river. Already in late antiquity, along the initial stretch of the river, there was a locality, Castelseprio, which was gradually increasing its importance by extending its influence over a vast territory. Castelseprio became at first a Lombard and Frankish stronghold, and then the capital of the homonymous county due to its strategic importance. Castelseprio was in fact at the intersection of the aforementioned road that connected Milan to the Verbano and a communication route that instead headed towards Varese. In these centuries, control of the Seprio was the key to the opening of the entire Valle Olona. The Visconti, defeated the Della Torre in the battle of Desio (1287), conquered Castelseprio and imposed its destruction. The Seprio, and with it the upper part of the Valle Olona, were then definitively annexed to the Duchy of Milan in 1395. Having become part of the Duchy of Milan and already protected for centuries by a chain of fortresses and castles,The castle of Belforte, of Induno, of Castiglione, of Fagnano, the Castellazzo of Ierago, of Castellanza in defense of the Guado di Castegnate, of Legnano and of Nerviano. the shores of the Olona increased their development: the mills multiplied, while the contribution to irrigation remained significant. Such an intensive use of water required the Duchy of Milan to issue specific regulations (the so-called Statutes of the streets and water of the Milan countryside): this was the first time in 1346 and then in 1396. = From the Renaissance to the 17th century = Olona river in Pero The premises for the establishment of a consortium among river water users occurred in 1541, when the so-called Novae Costitutiones (in English, the \\"new constitutions\\") were signed. In this case the new contract, which had a public nature, provided for a Regius Judex Commissarius Fluminis Olona (in English, \\"commissioner of the river Olona\\"), which supervised the control of the users of the Olona water. In general, this function was covered by a representative of the Senate of Milan. In 1548 a \\"shout\\" was issued which obliged water users to prove, by written documentation, the details of the various uses. In these centuries the distribution of water was not fair. The richest and most powerful users prevailed over the poorest and most defenseless ones. In 1606 a real consortium, in Italian called \\"Consorzio del fiume Olona\\" (en. Olona river consortium), was formed in Milan among the users under the surveillance, also in this case, of the commissioner of the Olona river. This official, as in the past, had the task of controlling the use of the Olona water. It was no coincidence that the consortium was born in Milan: in fact the users of the water who had the most conspicuous interests dwelt in the Milanese capital. The reasons that led to the creation of the consortium resided in an attempt to resolve the dispute between users and the Spanish government - which at the time dominated the Duchy of Milan - and in the latter's need to collect taxes from users of the Olona water in the most organized and systematic way possible. Given that the water of the Olona were always used free of charge, the historical users challenged the Government to pay the donations, while the Spaniards asserted that the taxes were due because of the status of the water, which was public. There were two attempts to resolve the issue. The first occurred in 1610, when the government received 6,000 scudi once, while the second was in 1666, thanks to the payment of another 8,400 scudi. With this last offering, the Spaniards definitively renounced the rights on the river. That described was a private management that continued until 1921, when the water of the river were returned to the public domain. This association, which has been based in Castellanza since 1982, is the oldest irrigation consortium in Italy. Two of the four statues that adorn Porta Garibaldi in Milan and allegorically represent the major Lombard rivers: on the left the Olona, on the right instead the Adda. On the other side of the door the Po and the Ticino are depicted After the 17th century, craft activities along the river diversified further. In the area sawmills, tanneries, dyes, bleaches, spinning mills and weaving mills for silk, cotton and wool began to be planted. These craftsmen, to move their machinery, exploited the driving force of the river thanks to the laying of water wheels. In order to install the latter, the artisans had to ask permission from the consortium. = From 18th to 21st century = The aforementioned family-run craft activities then laid the foundations for the creation of the proto-industries. After 1820, the first proto-industrial activities started along the Olona began to exploit the motive power of the river by first purchasing, and then modifying in the most appropriate way, the water mills that for centuries were destined for the grinding of agricultural products. During the industrial development of the 19th century, many mills then became part of the proto-industrial establishments that were rising along the Olona. The industrialization of the shores of the Olona was therefore gradual, with entrepreneurs who preferred to exploit the plumbing of the ancient mills rather than set up new ones. In other words, the industry was born as a metamorphosis of part of the ancient mills. As a consequence, the greatest concentration of proto-industrial activities occurred in correspondence of the stretches of the river where the presence of milling plants was higher. The presence of the mills, the abundance of local labor, the existence of modern and important communication routes along the river, the presence of personalities in the area who had substantial capital to invest and the long craft tradition of the Olona Valley allowed the banks of the river to become one of the cradles of Italian industrialization. In the mid-19th century, the primitive proto-industrial activities then turned into industries in the modern sense of the word. In this context, the shores of the Olona saw the birth of the tela Olona. This factories, which was made for the first time in the textures of Fagnano Olona, had its most common application in the sailing field. To optimize the exploitation of the current, the wheels of the mills were replaced by the most modern and efficient hydraulic turbines, the installation of which caused the abandonment and demolition of the ancient water mills, now obsolete. With the aim of improving the flow of water and consequently increasing the efficiency of the milling plants and the efficiency of the turbines, the Olona riverbed was channeled and rectified in various sections with the elimination of natural meanders. The greatest number of rectification and canalization interventions was carried out between the 19th and 20th centuries along the stretches crossing Fagnano Olona, Legnano and Milan. In the second half of the 19th century, steam machinery appeared, while at the beginning of the following century the exploitation of electricity began. As a result, the driving force to move the machinery no longer came from the river and therefore the hydraulic turbines were gradually abandoned. In the first post- war period the need for electric current grew, and therefore the use of the old mill wheels returned to being economically convenient, even if only for small workshops. Extract of a map of the early 19th century. Blue indicates the Olona river and the clearing areas of the Bozzente stream. In light green, irrigated areas; in dark green, woods; the rest cultivated fields with vines. The ancient mills therefore resumed operating drills, planers, grinding wheels, etc., but even this new awakening soon disappeared with the changing economic conditions. The water mills that were still used in agriculture, and which had not been purchased by the companies, were then gradually made obsolete by the new industrial milling techniques. Between 1826 and 1828, during the reconstruction work on the Spanish Porta Comasina (from 1860 called Porta Garibaldi) in neoclassical style, four colossal statues by Giambattista Perab√≤ were added above this city gate of Milan, which symbolize allegorically the main rivers of Lombardy: Po, Adda, Ticino and Olona. With the passage of time, the number of industries that stood along the banks of the Olona grew steadily up from 129 in 1881 to 712 in 1917. The surface of irrigated land also increased progressively: it passed from 10,801 Milanese perches in 1608, to 16,120 in 1801 and from 18,687 in 1877. In 1907, the water inlets, from the Rasa of Varese to Milan, amounted to 274. 18 of them were \\"free\\", that is, not subject to limitations, while 53 were \\"privileged\\", or subject to special regulation. All the others were subjected to a strict regulation which provided for the withdrawal of water in very precise days and times. From 1875, with the increase of the urbanization of the area, the Olona riverbed underwent, in many stretches, roofing works. These works were carried out mainly in Varese, Legnano, San Vittore Olona, Rho and Milan. When the exploitation of the hydraulic power of the river ceased, an environmental crisis began which led the Olona to be counted among the most polluted rivers in Italy. In fact, the Olona became an easy spill for residues and sewage derived from the various productions, in particular textiles, tanning and paper-making. The first documents referring to polluting spills discharged into the Olona water date back to the mid-nineteenth century. In 1919 there were four deaths among the population, and seven among the breeding cattle, due to an anthrax infection that was caused by the poisonous water of the Olona. The situation precipitated in the period between the two world wars. In the period of maximum pollution, which was recorded between 1950 and 1970, the water of the Olona contained highly acid substances and were soiled by residues derived from petroleum. Furthermore, they appeared colored by dyes and were characterized by the presence of a thick white foam on their surface. In 1963, the factories that discharged polluting wastes in the Olona were 88, while the population that poured its own sewage into the river amounted to about 219,000 inhabitants. Between the 1960s and 1970s a certain sensitivity towards ecological themes was born and consolidated, which led to a position taken by civil society towards polluting spills in the Olona. Even in the 21st century, the watercourse collects civil and industrial sewage despite the fact that remediation work has already been under way since the 1980s with the construction of purifiers. In 1998 the artisan and industrial activities present in the municipalities crossed or lapped by the Olona amounted to about 2,600 units. Almost 20,000 workers were employed in them.  The cartography  Map of the engineer Gaetano Raggi of the Olona River Consortium, showing the territory from Legnano to Parabiago (1772) The oldest map representing the course of the Olona of which we have documented trace is dated 1608. On it are also marked the bridges and, with a good precision, the constructions along the river but not the zone of the sources and not the measures of the various properties. In the center, which descends towards the south from Cerchia dei Navigli and enters the Darsena, Naviglio Vallone on a map of Milan of 1860. On the extreme right, which exits the Cerchia dei Navigli, the Vettabbia, while on the left, entering the Darsena from the northwest, the river Olona. South of the Darsena, from left to right, you can see the Naviglio Grande and the Naviglio Pavese, while to the east of the Darsena the Cavo Ticinello spillway that flows into the Vettabbia For the section of Olona that crosses Milan the current route appears, as already mentioned, in the general town plan of Beruto in 1884. With it, the route of the Darsena of Milan branch is also indicated. The Darsena branch, before crossing Via Vincenzo Foppa, crossed both Via Vepra, whose name recalls both Canale Vetra, and the ancient quartier of the same name, where, after the defeat with Federico Barbarossa and the destruction of the city (1162), they were exiled the Milanese of Porta Vercellina.Vittore e Claudio Buzzi, Le vie di Milano, dizionario di toponomastica milanese, Ulrico Hoepli, Milano, 2005. Here, until the fifties of the 20th century, there was the last section of a non-canalized river with a tortuous course, as well as the last artisan agglomeration that used its water for dyeing plants and laboratories for the treatment of heavy fabrics.The cartographic references are taken from \\"Carte di Lombardia\\" by Giovanni Liva and Mario Signori, Graphic Arts Amilcare Pizzi for Mediocredito Lombardo, Milan, 1985, from \\"Historical Atlas of Milan, City of Lombardy\\" curated by Virgilio Vercelloni, Workshop of graphic art Lucini for Metropolitana Milanese, Milan 1987. For the upstream section of Milan, the first map with a certain precision is a map drawn in 1763. This document illustrated the section from the sources to Gorla Minore. Later, another was drawn up in 1772 by the \\"conservator\\" of the river Giuseppe Verri and by the engineer Gaetano Raggi on behalf of the consorzio del fiume Olona. Besides the infrastructures, it also reports the canals and the locks, and therefore it is the first map endowed with a certain completeness. The richest in detail, among the oldest ones, is instead a map of 1789 which is the work of friar Mauro Fornari and Domenico Cagnoni. Among the papers of the 19th century, are to be mentioned the map drawn by the engineer Vittore Vezzosi in 1861, which also refers to some reliefs carried out on the river, and that of the engineer Eugenio Villoresi (1878), on which the areas irrigated by the Olona are traced in great detail. The latter, in fact, also reports the canals and the irrigation ditches originating from the river.  The water  = Regime of the river = The Olona regime is typically torrential due to the absence of intermediate bodies of water that regulate its flow. It has periods of high flow in March, April, October and November, and lean periods - though not dry - in July, August, December and January. The river regime is therefore characterized by a very variable flow which is a function of the seasons and of the meteorological precipitations. This variability has always caused technical difficulties in the dimensioning phase of infrastructures destined to contain floods. The average flow of the Olona in Ponte Gurone di Malnate is . In Rho, after the Olona receives the contributions of the Bozzente and the Lura, the average flow reaches the value of ( maximum). During the historic flood of 1951, a flow rate of was recorded at Castellanza, while the minimum flow rate in 1941 and 1950 reached a record value of . The average slope of the river course is 6 ‚Ä∞ compared to an overall fall of . The latter is calculated by subtracting the altitude of the confluence in Lambro Meridionale ( MSL) from the altitude of the main source ( MSL). The average width of the riverbed reaches at Malnate, at Nerviano and at Milan. This scarce flow is caused by the poor water supply of springs, tributaries and meteorological precipitation. However, the limited amount of water supply did not prevent the exploitation of river water for the most varied uses. The water have been used over the centuries for the extent of the overall fall of the river, and for the flow of the river. The first, in fact, allowed the exploitation of the motive power of its water especially along the first stretch of the riverbed, which is the one with the greatest slope. = Tributaries and trough = The Lura stream in the area of the former Alfa Romeo Arese Plant The river has a total of 19 tributaries. The most important ones are the Lura, the Bevera, the Gaggiolo (also called \\"Lanza\\"), the Bozzente, the Vellone, the Rile, the Tenore, the Merlata, the Pudiga, the Quadronna, the Selvagna and the Fredda. We should also mention the Refreddo (also called \\"Fontanile Crotto\\"), a stream that flows in the valley floor of Castelseprio, in the area of Crotto Valle Olona, and that flows into the river just downstream. The Olona water also comes from the springs. Many of them are famous because their water have been used for centuries for healing purposes, such as the Fontana degli Ammalati (en. \\"trough of the sick\\") of Induno Olona. Some of the troughs that feed the Olona are mentioned in various historical documents, while their first systematic census dates back to 1606. Thanks to the presence of springs, which supply water in a perennial way, the river does not run aground even in periods of drought. In the Valle Olona there are some wetlands, including the Buzonel pond. This stretch of water, located in the valley floor between Castelseprio and Lonate Ceppino, is fed by the Bozzone stream, which later flows into the Olona. = The floods and the leans = Piazza De Angeli in Milan in 1917 invaded by the Olona water The Olona, before the construction of embankments and canals, was a river that flogged the areas it crossed with frequent flooding. Considering the last four centuries, more than 70 floods can be counted. The first of which is known about the documents occurred in 1584 in Legnano. The last flood that caused significant damage occurred instead on 13 September 1995, while the last in chronological order took place on 29 July 2014. Among the most recent, the three floods that have done the most damage were those of 1911, 1917 and 1951. The most devastating was that of 1951, which occurred in conjunction with the Polesine flood. The greatest number of floods occurred in the final part of the river, in the Metropolitan City of Milan. The most affected city in this section was Rho. More to the north, the most interested area was that of Clivio. The cause of these frequent overflows must be sought in the reduced extension of the river bed with respect to the flow of water that flows there. Along its banks, various works have been carried out to contain the floods. The section most interested in these works was the one that crosses the Metropolitan City of Milan. For the upper section, the banks of the river that cross Fagnano Olona, Vedano Olona and Varese have been subjected to conspicuous interventions. A Gurone was completed in 2009 a dam with rolling tanks that regulates the flow of the river to contain floods. It is capable of forming a temporary basin of with a release of . Equally disastrous were the lean ones. The frequency of periods of very low water flow is comparable to that of floods. As for the historical lean, that of 1630 contributed to spreading the plague in the Alto Milanese, while that of 1734 passed to the annals for the recessive effects it had on the territory. The lean from 1747 instead went to history for its duration. To face the consequences of the lean periods, since 1346, were promulgated norms to reduce the waste and the abuses of the utilities that took water from the Olona. In these centuries, those who were caught red-handed to squander the Olona water could incur tax penalties and prison or corporal penalties. The users who suffered the most from the river's thin were the millers of the final stretch of the river. = The artificial derivations = The \\"Riale di Parabiago\\" canal. It was activated in 1216 As long as it was in operation, the stretch of the Cavo Diotti that took water from Castegnate, frazione of Castellanza, represented the most important artificial derivation of the Olona. Its northern section is still entering in the Olona, through the Bevera tributary, after having taken water from springs in the Canton of Ticino and in the territory of Viggi√π. The southern section of this artificial channel, that is the one that extracted the water previously introduced in Castegnate, was instead buried in 1918 following the strong urbanization of the agricultural area of Pantanedo, frazione of Rho, which was the final user of the Cavo Diotti. Since the demand for water for irrigation purposes in Pantanedo was almost zero, this part of the canal was no longer used. The Cavo Diotti was built in 1787. He was wanted by the lawyer Luigi Diotti, great landowner, to irrigate his properties. Diotti asked and obtained permission from Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria to carry out the work. The project was, however, a harbinger of controversy: 32 users of the river's water opposed it strenuously, claiming that the water withdrawal would be greater than its introduction. Given the government support, the consortium of the Olona river gave way and on 17 March 1786 gave permission for the start of construction work. When the Cable came into operation, the controversy did not abate. For decades there were disputes over the amount of water introduced - which many judged to be insufficient due to the measurement system - and the maintenance status of the Olona source area, where the Cavo Diotti fed water. In 1860 two other artificial derivations were proposed. The first, which was never built due to technical difficulties and cost problems, had to extract water from Lake Lugano, while the second would have had to introduce water into the Olona thanks to a withdrawal from an artificial channel coming from the Ticino river. The two projects were approved by the Olona River Consortium on April 28, 1877. In particular, the artificial canal from Ticino, destined to flow into the Naviglio Martesana, was built from 1887 to 1890 and was called Canale Villoresi. The first entry into the Olona of water from the Canale Villoresi was completed in 1923 thanks to an outlet located in Nerviano. When fully operational, this derivation introduced into the Olona . This work was intended to supply water to the downstream users of Rho, who were the ones who suffered the most from the lean periods of the river. A fourth derivation project was proposed in 1865. This canal was supposed to draw water from Lake Varese, but it was never built for the cost, which would have been too high. = Water quality and purifiers = The Olona in 1964, during the period of maximum pollution, which was recorded, as already mentioned, between 1950 and 1970 The water quality of the river is monitored in five monitoring stations: Varese, Lozza, Fagnano Olona, Legnano and Rho. In the first monitoring station, which is located in Varese, the river water is \\"acceptable\\" or \\"sufficient\\" and is constantly improving. In Legnano the quality of the water worsens, assuming the \\"poor\\" level, but here too an improvement is noted, since until a few years before the state of the water of the Olona was \\"very bad\\". In Rho, although slightly improving, the water of the river maintain the \\"very bad\\" degree. Downstream of the Pero purifier, the Olona water improve. The river consortium had set itself the goal of having all the monitoring stations reach the \\"acceptable\\" level by the end of 2008, and the \\"good\\" grade by the end of 2016. From the official data, if the 2008 target was not reached, that of 2016, with the \\"good\\" grade water quality, was achieved in advance, in 2015. These difficulties have led the Lombard regional administration to resort to extraordinary instruments such as the \\"river contract\\". This initiative provides for greater involvement of local authorities and the population concerned, with the aim of optimizing the coordination of interventions. Along the river there are several purifiers. These wastewater treatment plants, which are managed by the Olona river consortium, were built in Varese, Olgiate Olona, Gornate Olona, Cairate, Saltrio, Cantello, Canegrate, Parabiago and Pero. For the Varese-Milan section, in 2006, there was the need to build others: of these, only that of Gornate Olona (2009) was completed. The nature = Flora = The Gaggiolo in Malnate The first part of the river runs through the Campo dei Fiori Regional Park. Up to 600 m of altitude, in this protected area, chestnuts, ash trees and linden trees prevail. Maples are common in the more humid valleys. On the summit of the Campo dei Fiori massif these plant species are replaced by beech, while birches and Scotch pines are common on the dry slopes of Monte Martica. The open spaces are embellished by now rare plants such as the Gentiana pneumonanthe and by dozens of species of wild orchids, such as, for example, the vesparia and the moscaria. Downstream from the Campo dei Fiori, the Parco Rile Tenore Olona was established. The species that make up the flora of this protected area are mainly oaks, hornbeams, black locust, hazels, plane-trees, ash trees, oaks, poplars, elms, maples and alders. There are also many native species of shrubs, mushrooms and ferns that grow inside the Park. The flora of the flat stretch of the Olona, which includes most of the river's path, is characterized by the massive presence of the black locust, native to North America and introduced in the Italian woods, as well as by the species of high trunk already mentioned at the beginning of the 19th century to consolidate the railway ballast. = Fauna = The Rile between Cassano Magnago, Bolladello and Santo Stefano In the first part of the course, the unpolluted one, the fauna is very varied. In the Campo dei Fiori park you can meet ungulates such as deer or roe deer, and dozens of small mammals and rodents, including the red squirrel, hedgehog, fox, dormouse, shrew, vole, weasel, mole and various species of bats. There are also several birds of prey: some resident like the northern goshawk, the black kite, the honey buzzard, the sparrow hawk and the peregrine falcon, others migratory such as the short-toed snake eagle and the marsh harrier. Other birds present are the owl, the tawny owl and the barn owl. The grey heron and many birds, migratory and not, typical of the woods and fields complete the avifauna. Among the amphibians there are salamanders and various species of tree frogs, toads and frogs, while among the reptiles the lizard, the deaf adder, the viper and the lizard are common. As far as invertebrates are concerned, the presence of the cave beetle, an endemic beetle of the Campo dei Fiori, is worthy of mention, and the dragonfly, the firefly, the stag beetle and the cicada. The fish fauna is present in the initial stretch of the river, the least polluted one. The most common species are the brown trout and the european bullhead. In the Olona waters you can also find the common barbel, the chub, the gudgeon, the vairone, the common minnow, the common rudd and the bleak. In 2010 the fish repopulation of the middle section of the river was attempted thanks to the introduction of fish coming from the Canale Villoresi. The initiative was unsuccessful due to a spill of polluting waste in 2012, which led to the death of the fish species previously introduced. There are several alien species present. Among them, along the shores of the Olona, one can find the nutria, the American semiaquatic rodent, the spinycheek crayfish and the eastern gray squirrel, while in its waters it is possible to catch catfish.  Anthropic geography  = Municipalities crossed = Cascate di Valganna Olona river in Marnate Olona river in Parabiago near to Rancilio mill The municipalities crossed by the Olona are: ;Province of Varese * Varese * Valganna * Induno Olona * Malnate * Lozza * Vedano Olona * Gornate Olona * Castiglione Olona * Castelseprio * Lonate Ceppino * Cairate * Gorla Maggiore * Fagnano Olona * Gorla Minore * Solbiate Olona * Olgiate Olona * Marnate * Castellanza ;Metropolitan City of Milan * Legnano * San Vittore Olona * Canegrate * Parabiago * Nerviano * Pogliano Milanese * Vanzago * Pregnana Milanese * Rho * Pero * Milano = Seaworthiness and fishing = Olona river in Parabiago The river itself has never been a navigable communication route. It is not possible to speak of navigability even in the 21st century, even if in some points of the river canoeing is practiced and occasionally, for environmental promotion purposes, some ecologists carry out the descent by kayak. Fishing was once a thriving activity that was also practiced by professional fishermen. In the Olona trout, crayfish, frogs and other fish species were fished. Individual fishing licenses were issued by the Olona river consortium. During the centuries, given the economic importance deriving from it, numerous regulations were enacted. The oldest document preserved in the archives of the Olona river consortium refers to a provision that prohibited fishing without a license (1602). The fishing with nets and, from 1699, the \\"vivari\\" (or \\"nurseries\\"), that is those circular structures formed by stones that were destined to the breeding of the juvenile fish were also forbidden. The vivari were banned because they slowed the flow of water causing damage to the users who exploited the motive power of the river, like the millers. The vivari were built every year in the months of August and September, to then be emptied of fish and destroyed shortly before the beginning of Lent. In this way they provided the inhabitants' canteens with fish species at a time when meat was forbidden due to religious precepts. Fishing activities along the Olona began to decline in the mid-nineteenth century due to the polluting discharges of the first industries, only to disappear completely between the two world wars due to the sharp deterioration of water quality. = Infrastructures and projects = The Valmorea railway in Solbiate Olona The whole Olona is crossed by 57 bridges, among which there are some of historical interest, such as the Romanesque bridge in Castiglione Olona, and the iron bridge of Malnate, which was built at the end of the 19th century to allow the crossing of a railway. The largest infrastructure that crosses the Olona is instead the Cairate viaduct. Among the communication routes that cross the Olona, there are 2 railway lines (the Saronno‚ÄìLaveno railway and the Como‚ÄìVarese railway) and 7 provincial roads. The course of the river, which is profoundly artificialized, is strongly at risk from a hydraulic point of view, that is, from flooding. After the completion in 2009 of the large Gurone rolling mill, Lura and Bozzente are of particular concern. Since 2006 the hydraulic defense works have been delegated to the aforementioned \\"river contract\\". A railway line has been active along the Olona Valley. The Valmorea railway, this is its name, connected Castellanza to Switzerland following the course of the river. The passenger service was active from 1904 to 1952, while freight traffic was closed in 1977 due to competition from the railway line passing through Chiasso. A recovery project for tourism has been underway since 1990. The construction of the Pedemontana motorway, which completely covered the Olona to the Vedano bridge, and the construction, along the course of the river, of various cycle paths should also be noted. Among them, it should be remembered that between Castellanza and Castiglione Olona, whose route follows the path of the Valmorea railway. The extension to Mendrisio, Switzerland is being planned for this cycle path. Interesting sites = Water mills = Gajo- Lampugnani mills in Parabiago Between the springs and Nerviano the course of the river was once scattered with water mills. Since the Middle Ages, along the Olona, the milling activity has flourished. Such was the number of mills to suggest that in the 15th century this activity constituted a considerable economic source for the whole area. The oldest known document in which a mill is named on the Olona dates back to 1043: it refers to a milling plant located between Castegnate and the \\"Gabinella\\" locality in Legnano which was owned by Pietro Vismara. The Sforza and Visconti seigniories placed fortifications at the most important groupings of mills on the Olona, exploiting already existing fortresses and castles. In 1608 there were 116 mills on the shores of the Olona, including a copper trip hammer, a fuller for clothes and several oil presses, a number which rose to 106 in 1772 and to 55 in 1881 . In the years mentioned, the water wheels serving these milling plants (called, in Valle Olona, \\"rodigini\\") were, respectively, 463, 424 and 170. Meraviglia mill in San Vittore Olona Several of these mills have reached the 21st century. Some have been recovered, while others are in a state of neglect. Starting from the springs, the first historically significant milling plants that meet along the Olona are the Grassi mills in Varese, which were built between the 16th and 19th centuries. They have been restored to be used as a dwelling and have, on the external walls, some examples of sundials of great historical interest and a valuable fresco of 1675. Further south there are the Sonzini mills of Gurone, which are older than 1772. They remained in operation until 1970, after which they were used for housing. In Vedano Olona there is the mill at Fontanelle; already present in 1772, it had a millstone and a press. It underwent a first abandonment in the twenties, then it was restructured in the 1970s and again abandoned in the following decade. The Bosetti mill is located in Castellazzo, a frazione in Fagnano Olona. Already registered as a Visconti mill in 1772, it was listed as a Ponte mill in 1857 before taking on its current name in the following years. In 1982 only the houses were accessible, while the rest was already abandoned. In Castelseprio there is the Zacchetto mill, which was active for agricultural purposes from the 18th to the 19th century. It became the first seat of the Pagani company (twenty years), and then it was transformed into a power plant. Since the 1980s it has been abandoned. In Gornate Superiore, a frazione of Castiglione Olona, there is the Celeste mill. Formerly a Mariani mill in 1772 and a Guidali mill in 1857, it was registered under the current name in 1881. It had a millstone and oil presses. Since 1930 it has been adapted for private homes. The Taglioretti mill is located in Lonate Ceppino. Also in 1722, it was owned by Mariani. It took its current name in the 19th century. It was in service of the Canziani paper mill from 1901 and of the Samec cardboard factory from 1920. In 1982 it was abandoned. Interior of Meraviglia mill in San Vittore Olona In Gornate Olona there are the mills of Torba and San Pancrazio. Both existed before 1772, took the names of the respective fractions of 1857. Molinatory activities ceased around the middle of the 20th century. They are mostly used for housing. In Olgiate Olona there is instead the mill of Sasso. It is well preserved and therefore a project is underway that provides for the complete restoration of the hydraulic system. In Legnano the seven mills of the city center were demolished by the big cotton industries to allow the installation of the most modern and efficient hydraulic wheels. In Legnanese there are only six: these are the Cornaggia of Legnano, Meraviglia (formerly Melzi Salazar), Cozzi, De Toffol, Montoli of San Vittore Olona and Galletto of Canegrate mills. The only mill in this area with still efficient mills is the mill attached to the Meraviglia farm in San Vittore Olona, which is certainly the oldest among the remaining ones: it dates back to the 14th century. This milling plant is still intended to grind livestock forage. An international cross country running, the Cinque Mulini, which takes place every year in the spring in San Vittore Olona takes its name from these milling plants. Downstream of Canegrate there are only a few others, such as the Gajo- Lampugnani mill in Parabiago, the Star Qua of Nerviano mill and the Sant'Elena mill in Pregnana Milanese. Referring instead to the territory of Rho, we can cite among the examples in disuse or converted over the years into housing modules the Prepositural mill, once owned by the Parish of San Vittore and now completely abandoned, followed more downstream by the Cecchetti mill, transformed into a dwelling despite having preserved some elements of the machinery on display in the garden, in addition to the Nuovo mill, located at the confluence with the Bozzente stream and which also became a private residence.Paola Pessina e Giuseppe Terruzzi, Le campagne e il borgo di Rho nei documenti del Catasto di Maria Teresa d'Austria, Biblioteca Popolare di Rho, 1980 = Industrial archeology = On the left, the restored facades of the warehouses of the former Cotonificio Cantoni of Legnano From the sixties and seventies of the 20th century, the industry of the Valle Olona (especially the textile sector) entered an irreversible crisis and therefore, progressively, most of the factories definitively interrupted the productive activities, leaving the areas adjacent to the Olona an important heritage of industrial archeology. Equipped with great architectural value is the Birrificio Angelo Poretti of Induno Olona, which was founded in 1877. In 1901 this industrial complex was expanded with the construction of new Liberty style pavilions. Even the subsequent restorations and extensions were respectful of this architectural choice. The buildings, between naturalism, classicism, Egyptian and floral, present striking decorations: masks, grotesques, medallions, fringes and drops, shells, giant pilasters and large festoons of hops. This establishment, originally, exploited the aforementioned Fontana degli Ammalati, or a resurgence whose water was used for centuries for its healing qualities. The Carlo Cattaneo University of Castellanza Further down the valley there is the former Cotonificio Milani of Castiglione Olona. In addition to production facilities, this industrial complex includes a manor house and some workers' houses. It is located near the Valmorea railway. Also in Castiglione Olona, there are also the former factories of the Pettinificio Mazzucchelli, whose structures date back to 1849. In Lonate Ceppino there are the former Oleificio Lepori and the former Pettinificio Clerici, both prior to 1772. In Fagnano Olona there are the former Cotton Factory Candiani, which dates from the beginning of the 20th century, the Filatura Introizzi, which was founded before 1881, and the former factories of the Vita Mayer paper mill. In the municipality of Solbiate Olona you can find the former establishments of Cotonificio Ponti. This industrial complex was founded in 1908 on a previous spinning started in 1823. In Olgiate Olona, on the other hand, there is the former Sanitaria Ceschina, or a garzificio that was built between 1902 and 1907. Two of the former Cotonificio Cantoni facilities are located in Legnano and Castellanza. The first nucleus of the plant of Legnano was started in 1830; this factory was partly demolished, and the remaining buildings were converted into a shopping center. The former Cantoni Cotton Mill of Castellanza was instead used, in 1991, as the headquarters of the University Carlo Cattaneo. = Parks = View of the Campo dei Fiori Regional Park Since the second half of the 20th century, there have been several protected natural areas established along the shores of the Olona. The Campo dei Fiori Regional Park covers an area of 6,300 hectares and is managed by a consortium formed by the Valli del Verbano mountain community, the Piambello mountain community, the province of Varese and the seventeen municipalities included in the Park territory: Barasso, Bedero Valcuvia, Brinzio, Casciago, Castello Cabiaglio, Cocquio-Trevisago, Comerio, Cunardo, Cuvio, Gavirate, Induno Olona, Luvinate, Masciago Primo, Orino, Rancio Valcuvia, Valganna and Varese. It is based in Brinzio and was established in 1984. Since 2010, the project to restore the Olona main spring area to the Rasa of Varese has been active. The Parco Rile Tenore Olona, which was established in 2006, embraces a territory characterized by extensive terracing of fluvial-glacial origin, the so-called moraine plains, and is rich in sites of historical and cultural significance. The typical geology of the territory allows the birth of many small streams supported by spring and rain waters. The main ones are the Rile and the Tenore. The park covers 16 km¬≤ and includes the municipalities of Cairate, Carnago, Caronno Varesino, Castelseprio, Castiglione Olona, Gazzada Schianno, Gornate Olona, Lonate Ceppino, Lozza, Morazzone and Oggiona con Santo Stefano. A glimpse of the small lake inside the Legnano Castle Park The Parco Valle del Lanza, born in 2002, includes the municipalities of Malnate, Cagno, Bizzarone and Valmorea. Of particular interest is the area crossed by the Lanza stream (another name for Gaggiolo), from which it takes its name. It has an area of 676 hectares. In 2006 the Parco del Medio Olona was also established, which includes the stretch of the Valle Olona between Fagnano Olona and Marnate. The park includes the municipalities of Fagnano Olona, Gorla Maggiore, Solbiate Olona, Gorla Minore, Olgiate Olona and Marnate. In addition to the Valle Olona, the park also includes the Fagnanese stretch of the Tenore and the woods to the east of Gorla Maggiore, where the Fontanile di Tradate flows. The Parco castello of Legnano, born in 1976, stands next to the castle of Legnano, on the border with the municipalities of Canegrate and San Vittore Olona. It is also known as \\"park castle\\" or \\"park of Legnano\\". In the period of its constitution, the reforestations were not founded on the knowledge of the local species, and therefore this protected area includes many non-native plants of the area. In 1981 a wetland was created that is frequented by a large number of aquatic birds and is inhabited by many fish species. The Parco dei Mulini, which was established on 20 March 2008, covers the wooded and agricultural areas of the municipalities of Legnano, Canegrate, San Vittore Olona, Parabiago and Nerviano. The surface, over 264 hectares, is almost entirely used for agricultural activities. In the park there are important historical testimonies such as the castle of Legnano, the former Visconti di Modrone factory and six water mills (it. \\"mulini ad acqua\\"), the last testimony of the ancient milling tradition of the area.

In 1419, Uri and Unterwalden bought the Bellinzona stronghold from the Sacco barons, but were unable to defend it adequately. When, in 1422, they rejected the Milanese proposal to buy back the fortified town, their troops stationed in Bellinzona were put to rout by the Visconti army under the command of Francesco Bussone, Count of Carmagnola. An attempt to reconquer the fortified area with the support of other confederates led to the battle at Arbedo, a village north of Bellinzona. The Count of Carmagnola led the forces of the Duchy of Milan against the Swiss and was victorious. The shooting thaler of the 1867 federal Sch√ºtzenfest depicts Hans Landwing saving the cantonal banner. The Swiss were mainly equipped with halberds and had an initial success against the cavalry charge. Then Carmagnola brought his crossbowmen forward, while dismounting his cavalry. The dismounted men-at-arms used pikes which outreached the halberds. The Swiss were further under pressure by the crossbow fire on the flanks. The Milanese force began to push back the Swiss, who were only saved from total disaster by the appearance of a band of foragers, whom the Milanese were convinced represented a major new force. When the Milanese force pulled back to reform, the Swiss fled the battlefield, having taken heavy casualties. In a historiographical tradition of Zug, the bearer of the cantonal banner, Peter K√§lin, was slain, and the banner was taken up by his son, who was slain in his turn. The banner was saved by one Hans Landwing, and was later lost against the French.Illustrirte Zeitung No. 1360, 24 July 1869, p. 72f. The victory secured Bellinzona and the Leventina to the Duchy. In addition the Duchy gained the Val d'Ossola, thus the Swiss lost all the territorial gains they had made. The defeat discouraged the Swiss expansionist intentions towards Lake Maggiore for a long time. It was the defeat at Arbedo that made the Swiss increase the number of pikemen.

Professional healthcare providers use PALS during the stabilization and transportation phases of a pediatric emergency, in or out of hospital. Skills taught include recognition and treatment of infants and children at risk for cardiopulmonary arrest; the systematic approach to pediatric assessment; effective respiratory management; defibrillation and synchronized cardioversion; intraosseous access and fluid bolus administration; and effective resuscitation team dynamics.

Peterborough was already an important railway centre providing a great deal of work for the populace, but with all this industry there was no local provision for training. In 1903, the County Technical School was set up in a small building in Broadway in the city centre with boys studying mathematics, science, technical drawing and some technological subjects. Girls studied a programme for employment in commerce. This was closed in 1926 to save money. Some technical classes did continue but were held as evening classes at Deacon's Grammar School, other schools and the Broadway building. With the onset of war in 1939, the major engineering firms had to expand to produce munitions and other vital military equipment. The demand for skilled men, and also now for women, escalated but there was nothing in the education or training field to cope with this demand. The industrial expansion continued but it wasn't until 1944, that the Soke of Peterborough Education Committee established Advisory Committees for Engineering and Building and reorganised courses into the Senior Evening Institute of Commercial and Technical Students, Junior Evening Institute and Adult Institute. Classes were held all over the city but, in 1946, temporary premises were erected on land in Garton End Road to provide space for engineering subjects. Pressure from local firms with education and training policies resulted in the Education Committee supporting a plan for Peterborough Technical College, initially at the Garton End Road site.McIntyre, J.A.

He also finished on the rostrum of the British Speedway Championship finals twice, second in 1964 and third in 1965. His nickname Hurri-Ken was given to him by famous speedway promoter Johnnie Hoskins. Career summary McKinlay took up speedway while serving with the British Army in Germany, riding for the Neum√ºnster forces team.Davies, Trevor (2008) Warzone Speedway, Trevor Davies Publishing, , p. 137 He went on to captain the team and finished in joint sixth place in the 1948 Combined Services Speedway Championship. On his return to Britain, he started his career with the Glasgow Tigers in 1949 and had five successful seasons there. However, in 1954 the track closed and Ken transferred to the Leicester Hunters for a club record fee.Jones, Alan (2004) Speedway in Leicester: The Hunters Era, Automedia, p. 157 He spent eight seasons with the Hunters, moving up with them into the First Division in 1957, and averaging close to 11 points in the 1958 and 1959 seasons. A spell with the Coventry Bees followed after Leicester dropped down to the Provincial League. When the British League was formed in 1965 Ken was allocated to the West Ham Hammers, and as captain led them to winning the 1965 treble of League Championship, KO Cup and London KO Cup trophies. He was renowned for his team- riding with younger riders and his contribution throughout his five seasons with the Hammers was immeasurable. 1970 saw him return to the Coventry Bees for one season before he moved to the Oxford Cheetahs for a further two seasons. Ken considered retirement but in 1973 he was approached by the management of the Scunthorpe Saints to become rider/coach of the second division side. He stayed with the Saints for three seasons before retiring in 1975 aged forty-seven. While still a Second Division rider with Leicester he rode for England in the 1955 Test series against Australasia, top scoring for England in the third test with 11 points, and going on to represent England regularly until the early 1970s.Foster, Peter (2005) A History of the Speedway Ashes, Tempus, , p. 152 et seq Ken McKinlay was also a success when he ventured to Australia to race in the late 1950s and through the 1960s, winning the Australian Individual Speedway Championship in 1964 at the 509m Sydney Showground Speedway. He placed third in 1967 at Adelaide's Rowley Park Speedway and tied for second in 1969, again at the Sydney Showground. Mckinlay was also successful in various Australian state championships. He won the South Australian Championship in 1957 at Rowley Park, the Victorian Championship in 1959 and again in 1961 as well as the NSW championship at the Showground in 1960.

Biography  =Early life= Born John Anthony Arcesi (pronounced RCC) in Sayre, Pennsylvania, on February 11, 1917. John's father Antonio Arcesi (1879‚Äì1963) and mother Josephine Marchinne (1881‚Äì1919) were born in Rome, Italy. Antonio traveled alone to America at the turn of the century, leaving his wife and first-born son Ignatius behind in Italy until he could establish himself. Upon reuniting in America, Antonio and Josephine had four more children: Josephine, Loretta, Louis and Johnny. When Johnny was still a child, his father Antonio (Tony) played an Enrico Caruso disc on a Victrola and this inspired him. As a result, he became a child prodigy and local celebrity, singing whenever possible in public or private in the Sayre, Athens and Towanda area of Pennsylvania, as well as Waverly, New York, and as far as Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Elmira, New York. He turned professional at about the age of 10 after winning a talent show/contest that was produced in Sayre at the Sayre Theatre by the great 'Blackstone the Magician', Harry Blackstone, Sr., in c.1927. Blackstone paid Johnny a 5-dollar gold piece for performing and he thereby turned professional that night. Johnny sang for every club or organization in the area that wanted talent to perform for their various causes, including The Elks and The Lions. He would also sing for patients at the local Robert Packer Hospital in Sayre. In 1933, after a fire almost destroyed the family home the previous year, Johnny, at the age of 16, with his father's blessing, decided to travel alone to New York City to become a band vocalist. His childhood idols and inspirations included Russ Columbo, Bing Crosby, Red McKenzie, Enrico Caruso, Rabbi Joseph Rosenblatt and John McCormick and others. =Professional Career and Rise to Fame= Arcesi first made a name for himself as a vocalist for prominent bands in New York City. His first professional recordings on September 13, 1934, were on the Columbia label with Lud Gluskin and Orchestra. These titles were \\"One Night Of Love\\" and \\"Moonlight on the River Danube\\". His next recordings were on the Bluebird label with Louis 'King' Garcia in 1936, recording five vocals for the date: \\"It's Great to Be in Love Again\\",\\"Christopher Columbus\\",\\"Swing Mr. Charlie\\",\\"There Is No Greater Love\\", and \\"Love Is Like a Cigarette\\". One of his first important live performances and radio broadcasts was with the Claude Hopkins Orchestra at the Roseland Ballroom in Manhattan. Hopkins let Johnny sing with the band for several nights after an impromptu audition backstage. Johnny was employed at Mills Music Publishing Company in the Brill Building as a song demonstrator and office assistant during the day, and singing in various clubs in NYC at night. Irving Mills, upon meeting Johnny during a band rehearsal with Joe Venuti in NYC, suggested the name Arcesi sounded too 'Italian'. Thus, Don Darcy was the name John used from 1935 to 1945, and he recorded as Johnny Darcy from 1946 to 1950. He was sometimes listed as Don D'Arcy. In 1935 Major Bowes, impressed by young Don when he refused to perform on his amateur show and asserted and demonstrated his professionalism at audition, gave him three sustaining (non-sponsored) 15-minute spots a week, broadcasting on WHN in NYC. Shortly thereafter Darcy was offered the same spots, thirty-minute shows, on WOR in Newark, New Jersey, where he performed from c.1935‚Äì36. During this time Darcy developed a loyal fan base of regional listeners, received fan mail and other offers, and learned about the subject of 'payola' first hand. Upon leaving WOR, and after turning down an offer to broadcast nationally on CBS radio, Darcy desired to go on the road and learn the band business. For the next several years Darcy was the male vocalist for Joe Venuti's Orchestra c.1936‚Äì40, after having worked with Charlie Barnet, 1935, Lud Gluskin, 1934, Louis 'King' Garcia, 1936, and others. With the Venuti Orchestra, among many engagements playing the largest hotels and ballrooms in the country, Darcy opened the show for several months at Billy Rose's 'Casa Manana' extravaganza in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1936 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Texas' statehood. Both Paul Whiteman and Joe Venuti's bands shared the stage for this event. Darcy performed the same function at Rose's Cleveland Aquacade the following year. Contrary to what has been previously written, the only association Darcy had with Rhode Island was any number of one nighters with the various bands he performed with over the next several years, i.e., Dick Gasparre, 1940, Joe Marsala, 1941‚Äì42, Sonny Dunham, 1943‚Äì44, Boyd Raeburn, 1944‚Äì45, Art Mooney, 1946‚Äì48, and Johnny Bothwell in 1948‚Äì49. Darcy also worked in brief association with the bands of Frank Trumbauer, Hal McIntyre and Sam Donahue. He recorded on various labels with these bands; labels such as Hit, Guild, Grand, Signature and Century Records. Darcy also recorded on American and Langworth Transcriptions. The Century Records dates produced four sides entitled, 'Doink,Doink', 'This Strange Desire', 'A Haunting Melody', and his first recorded version of his original song 'Noahs' Ark', a song he co-wrote with Bud Green c. 1940. The Century dates were recorded in NYC at RCA Custom studios and marked his first collaboration with Lloyd Shaffer. He later recorded 'Noah's Ark' under the title 'Rockin' the Ark'. =Capitol records= In 1952 Darcy reverted to his original birth name of John Arcesi when he signed with Capitol Records, after being heard on late night weekend broadcasts on KNX-LA with just voice and piano. Pianists Harper McCabe and Ed Greenburg accompanied Arcesi on these shows. Alan Livingston was President of the Capitol label at the time, with Lee Gillette as head of A&R.; Gillette offered to have Nelson Riddle orchestrate and arrange the first recordings; however, John promised Lloyd Shaffer after recording the Century sides in NY, if and when he ever got a 'big break' that he would have Shaffer be his conductor, and he kept his promise. John recorded nine singles, with Shaffer conducting the arrangements. Shaffer had previously worked with Perry Como on the \\"Chesterfield Supper Club\\" show. John's first single release with Capitol was entitled \\"Wild Honey b/w \\"Moonlight Brings Memories\\", for which he received positive reviews from reviewers such as George Simon in Metronome magazine. Capitol ran several full pages ads in Billboard magazine promoting Arcesi;they felt they had another star on their hands. Arcesi also received positive reviews in Variety for his live performance work at the Thunderbird Hotel in Las Vegas in October 1952, before the notoriety of the incident written of below. Following his engagement in Las Vegas, he appeared in New York City at the French Casino,then followed with a stint at the Boulevard Cafe in Queens. He received positive reviews at these locales for his live stage work. However, he also received much derision from audiences at these shows because of the Las Vegas incident. Upon returning to Hollywood, California, after the New York engagements, Arcesi performed at the Crescendo nightclub. The opening act at these shows was the infamous Lord Buckley. In March 1953 Arcesi recorded four sides with Nelson Riddle, who arranged and conducted the date just prior to being signed to Capitol himself. The titles for this recording date: \\"Tombstone\\", \\"Cowpo\\", \\"Rockin' the Ark\\", and \\"Ol' Man River\\", the first three songs written by Arcesi. He was also voted third most promising 'new singer' by Billboard Magazine that year, following Al Martino and Steve Lawrence. His last public broadcasts with voice and guitar were on KABC-LA in 1959. These shows, broadcast on Saturday and Sunday nights were also heard over the AFRTS. On the Saturday shows, Arcesi called the broadcast 'For Adults Only', singing the standards of the day. On Sunday nights, he sang 'World of Philosophy' singing original material.JOHN ARCESI ‚Äì Online Catalog of 45rpm Singles His renown eventually spread as far as the West Coast of the United States (among other places), Los Angeles and Las Vegas, Nevada. An article in the December 1, 1952, issue of Time expounds at length on a gimmick cooked up by the Arcesi's press agent, Ed Scofield, whereby the mere sound of his voice could send impressionable young women into a trance upon hearing the song \\"Lost in Your Love\\". The interview from CBS-TV on a show called \\"Everywhere I Go\\", hosted by Dan Seymour in 1952, reveals that Mr. Arcesi had nothing to do with or aforeknowledge of the stunt enacted at the Thunderbird Hotel in Las Vegas, and despite the publicity generated from the incident and Scofield himself admitting twice during the interview that Arcesi knew nothing about the stunt, it had an extremely negative effect on Arcesi's reputation and career. This interview can be viewed on the website listed below.The Gimmick Man ‚Äì TIME =Producer= Sadly, the fleeting nature of fame meant Arcesi's notoriety passed almost as soon as it arrived and very little was subsequently heard from him for several years. During this time however, using the name/aliases of 'Tony Conti' and 'Chick Johnson' as a producer and songwriter he developed and recorded other artists, most notably a group called 'The Bombers', an R&B; vocal quartet. With this group he wrote and produced a 9-song LP called \\"Songs for Strange Lovers\\", released on Arcesi's own Orpheus Records label in 1955. Two single 45 and 78 rpm discs were released at that time, entitled 'I'll Never Tire of You' b/w 'Malena', and 'Two Time Heart' b/w 'Sentence of Love'. Arcesi also wrote and produced a single 45rpm disc of a female vocalist called Schartan. The titles were 'Mystery of Love' b/w 'I Need You, I Need You'. All songs written by Arcesi. After a trip to Europe in 1960, England and France and Germany, on speculation, Arcesi and his wife moved to Palm Springs,California in 1961. In 1971, following the death of his wife the previous year, an album entitled Reachin' Arcesia was recorded in Hollywood on Cherokee Ave. at Artists Recording Studios between May 15 and July 26 of that year and released by Alpha Records in small quantity. 300 copies were pressed and released in November 1972. This LP has been 'bootlegged' by various entities, and has been erroneously released under the title 'Arcesia Reaching' with the second side as side one and the first side as side two, thereby skewing the intent of the singer and producer in presenting the songs as intended. A 45 rpm single from the LP, 'Reaching' b/w 'Pictures in My Window' was released in limited quantity in 1979 in Honolulu on the Orpheus-Alephia label, the current holders of the rights thereto. (The record was subsequently reissued without authorization in 1997 by the German label One Little Indian Records). The stark white cover of the original LP release (containing only the artist's name and album title) belied the decidedly unusual music inside. As one might expect, the leader of Arcesia was in fact the 54-year-old John Arcesi himself, who spent the better part of the 1960s devoting himself to writing, painting, songwriting and occasional rare vocal appearances at benefits in Palm Springs, California. The co-producer and engineer on the record was Alexander Furth. Furth also produced the 1968 single of 'Love Is Like A Mountain'( aka 'Reaching') b/w 'It's All Accordin'. For the most part, the eleven songs on Reachin' Arcesia are highly emotive and passionate, with emphasis on guitar,piano and organ. The background music was unlike anything Arcesi had recorded before with orchestras. Lyrics are stream-of-consciousness musings on subjects such as life's struggle and redemption, i.e. (\\"Desiree\\"), the power of woman,(\\"White Panther\\"), and life's transience (\\"Butterfly Mind\\", \\"Soul Wings\\"). Although overlooked at the time of its original issue and derided in some corners upon its re-release, the album has now gained a degree of cachet. Arcesi himself was satisfied with the outcome of the recording, knowing he had produced an original work that would take time to be understood for what it was, and still is. =Retrospective= So far, music historians have been unable to reconcile these two strikingly different phases of John Arcesi's career or to fill in the rather large gap in the above timeline. It is known that after John recorded \\"Reachin' Arcesia\\" he visited with his family in Waverly, New York, and Maryland in 1972, leaving them with copies of his final LP before returning to Palm Springs and then to Hawaii. Between 1971 and 1974 Arcesi was very successful in the Fine Arts field in Palm Springs, representing the work of Jose Montanes, Ivar, Igor,Valdez, Frank Fuller and other lesser known painters. Arcesi lived in Honolulu,Hawaii from 1974 to 1982 where he continued to write songs and essays, draw, paint and create in his spare time. He then spent the remaining months of his life in Palm Springs, California, where he had lived during the sixties with his wife of 21 years, the late Louise Marie de Lesseps Arcesi. Death John died in Palm Springs, California, on April 12, 1983, at the age of 66.

He plays internationally for the Central African Republic. He plays as a defensively-minded central midfielder. Club career =Royal Antwerp= In 2007, Gbarssin signed a two-year contract with Royal Antwerp, with the option of an extra year. After two successful seasons with the Belgian club, he attracted the attention of several top-flight French and Belgian clubs. Italian club Bologna submitted a bid for Gbarssin, but Antwerp did not allow him to leave. This led to several off-field problems which meant that Gbarssin was left on the bench for the majority of the 2009‚Äì10 season. =Bologna= Marco was released in the summer of 2010 and joined Bologna for the whole of pre-season. The club was subsequently acquired by new owners, who cancelled the contracts of all the players signed in the summer by the previous management.http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/855949?cc=5739 =FC Fredericia= Finding himself without a contract, Marco signed a short-term deal with Danish club FC Fredericia in order to get some first-team football and maintain match fitness. =Carlisle United= On 31 December 2010, Gbarssin signed a one-month contract with Carlisle United. Carlisle manager Greg Abbott told the club website: \\"Marco has done really well during the last three weeks and he's one we've managed to sneak under the radar. He's played to a good standard abroad and was recommended to me by a good friend of mine who told me he was worth a look. He's a really tough, solid but capable player who rarely gives the ball away. This month will show us whether he is capable of kicking on to the next level and if he manages that, he'll reward himself by earning a longer contract.\\" International clearance was received on 6 January 2011 and on 31 January Gbarssin signed a deal to stay at Carlisle until the end of the season. In a surprise move, on 4 March 2011 Gbarssin joined Carlisle's League 1 rivals Walsall on a loan deal until the end of April. Gbrassin was released by Carlisle United in May 2011.

The organization's current president is Mrs. Cassandra Garber, who was a former teacher at the Freetown Secondary School for Girls. In Freetown, Sierra Leone the union is called the 'Krio Descendants Yunion' in the Krio and it is abbreviated as KDY. Settlers' Descendants Union The 'Settlers' Descendants' Union' was among the first organizations which organized and united Krios to become politically active despite not being in itself a political party. The Settlers Descendants Union was established in 1952 by Johann Christianus Lucan, who served as President of the Union, Ephraim Jonathan Robinson, Vice President, and Nicholas Asgill. The Settlers' Descendants Union mounted costly actions in the British Courts against the independence settlement. Formation of the Krio Descendants Union In 1990, the 'Settlers' Descendants Union' was given new berth and was re-established as the Creole Descendants Union. The founding members of the present-day Krio Descendants Union included George T.O. Robinson, the younger brother of Ephraim J.

He played for Celtic, Blackpool, Hull City, Gateshead, Coleraine and East Stirlingshire. Buchan signed professional forms with Celtic in 1933 and spent four years with the Glasgow club, winning the Scottish League Division One championship with them in 1935‚Äì36 and the Scottish Cup in 1937. In 1937, Buchan signed for Joe Smith's Blackpool for ¬£10,000,Buchan, Willie at TheCelticWiki then a record transfer fee involving a Scottish club, making his debut on 20 November 1937 in a 2‚Äì0 defeat at local rivals Preston North End. He scored his first goals for the club two games later, in a 2‚Äì2 draw at Middlesbrough on 4 December. He went on to score ten more goals in the 23 remaining games of the league season and, with his total twelve goals, finished joint-top scorer with Bobby Finan (see Blackpool F.C. season 1937‚Äì38). The following season, 1938‚Äì39, he finished joint-top scorer again, this time with new signing Jock Dodds, the pair scoring ten goals apiece. During the first of six seasons of inter-war football that followed, Buchan returned to Glasgow in an attempt to re-join Celtic, but the club showed little enthusiasm. He instead joined his local team, Stenhousemuir, as a guest player. When the club closed down for the duration of the war, Buchan returned to England to become a PT instructor in the Royal Air Force. Buchan made one appearance for Scotland in a wartime international. At the end of the war, Buchan returned to Blackpool. In Buchan's final season at the seaside, 1947‚Äì48, he made fourteen appearances in a start-stop season, his place in the line-up restricted due to the form of Stan Mortensen, Stanley Matthews and Ernie Taylor. His four goals game in two games: two in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Wolves on 6 September 1947, and two (one a penalty) in a 3‚Äì1 victory over Charlton Athletic at Bloomfield Road on 29 November. His final appearance for the club occurred on 1 May 1948, the final day of the league season, in a 7‚Äì0 demolition of Preston North End at Deepdale. Buchan joined Hull for the start of the 1948‚Äì49 campaign. In his only season with the club, he made forty league appearances, scoring twelve goals. In 1949, he joined Gateshead, with whom he made 88 league appearances and scored 16 goals. After a short spell as player-manager of Northern Irish club Coleraine, Buchan finished his career in his native Scotland with East Stirlingshire. Buchan died on 6 July 2003, aged 88.

Class 22 locomotives were part of the 1950s generation of SNCB electric locomotives that included Types 122 (later 22), 123 (later 23), 125, (later 25 and 25.5) and 140 (later 125.100, 25 and 25.5) built between 1953 and 1961. There were 50 Series 122, 83 Series 123, 16 Series 125 and 6 Series 140 for a total of 155 locomotives. They were seen across Belgium on passenger and freight trains until they were retired. There was no difference in power between the classes as they all used the same electric motors and control equipment. Class 22 was originally designated as Type 122 prior to introduction of the 1971 numbering system. The original numbers were 122.001-122.050. In 1957 the last 10 locos were given dual voltage (1500 and 3000 Volts DC) capability plus a third headlight so they could run in Holland. They were renumbered to 122.201-210. Later 122.039 and 122.040 were also converted and renumbered to 122.211 and 122.212. Loco 120.038 was given a third headlight and renumbered 122.210 and used as a display during the 1958 exposition in Brussels but did not work in service with this number. This subterfuge allowed all of the real 122.200s to remain in service for the extra traffic generated by the exposition. This also happened with one of the AFB-GM diesel locos at the same time. 202.011 was temporarily renumbered to 204.009 for the same reason. 2202 was later fitted with nonstandard ventilation grilles as a test. No others were converted. The class was withdrawn in 2009, 56 years after its introduction with all but a few still in running condition. Their last working duties included peak hour trains and banking at Li√®ge. 2201 is preserved by the PFT-TSP railway preservation group.

There were 50 Series 122, 83 Series 123, 16 Series 125 and 6 Series 140 for a total of 155. They were seen across Belgium on passenger and freight trains until they were retired in 2012. Class 23 was later fitted for multiple working, and were often found in pairs. There was no difference in power between the classes as they all used the same traction motors and control equipment. The 23s differed from the 22s in three ways. The most visible was the ventilation grilles. Those on the Type 122 were mounted on the roof and sometimes had problems with water ingestion. This was corrected by having three grilles mounted low on each side. Six of the 23s (2306-2313-2317-2320-2321-2331) later received an extra vent on one side only, just above the existing central one. The next was additional weight was added to the chassis to increase tractive effort. The third was the 23s had regenerative braking. The reason for these differences was to let them pull heavy freight trains on the line Brussels-Luxembourg. Loco 123.083 became 124.001 in 1968 and 2401 in 1971. It received a streamlined shroud at one end only that fit over the existing bodywork. It had its own windshield, wipers, washers and headlights. It also was given the ACEC Type G transmission system with a different gear ratio to test. Another change was that the traction motors were completely suspended rather than being just nose suspended. This was all a development stage for what was to have been a four voltage electric loco of 7000 HP. As time went on the four voltage requirement was dropped and the actual production locomotive became the Class 20, introduced late in 1975. 124.001/2401 made a number of test runs between Landegem and Aalter at speeds up to 200 km/h (124 mph). It was converted back to standard and renumbered to 2383 during 1974. It ran in regular freight and passenger services and became \\"The Banker of Li√®ge\\" when it became the normal loco for pushing passenger trains up the steep ramp leading from Li√®ge- Guillemins up to Ans. Loco 2302 was given ventilation grilles like those on Classes 11-12-21-27 as a test. These were mounted high on each side. The original openings were blanked in and each fitted with a porthole. No other Class 23s ever had these. 2302 retained this arrangement until the end of its service life. The arrival of the new Class 18 locomotives in early 2012 marked the end of the class, during the Spring of 2012 all were withdrawn except a few for banking duties at Li√®ge-Guillemins but even those were soon withdrawn, replaced by Class 77 diesels. Before 1 January 1971 the locomotives were numbered 123.001-123.083 but from this date the class became 2301-2382.

During the Second World War, it also served beyond the Sudan in the East African Campaign and in the Western Desert Campaign.Badge, Internal Security Force, Sudan Defence Force Imperial War Museum, Retrieved 23 December 2018 Establishment Between 1898 and 1925 Sudanese soldiers served in separate infantry battalions of the Egyptian Army, under British and Egyptian officers. These were designated as either \\"Sudanese Battalions\\" or \\"Arab Battalions\\" according to their region of recruitment within the Sudan. By contrast to the bulk of the Egyptian Army, who were recruited through annual conscription, the Sudanese units enlisted only long-serving volunteers.page 169 \\"Military Report on Egypt\\", War Office 1906 Following a mutiny of Sudanese troops in 1924, and at a time of unrest in Egypt itself, the garrisoning of the Sudan was put on a new basis. Egyptian military units and Egyptian officers of Sudanese battalions were transferred back to Egypt itself. The Sudanese troops remaining were incorporated into the newly created Sudan Defence Force. The junior commissioned officer and NCO positions previously held by Egyptian personnel, were now open to \\"Sudanisation\\". A military academy was opened in Omdurman to train the new Sudanese officer corps, most of whom were Muslims from the north. By 1939 the SDF numbered 5,000 officers and men. Composition O'Ballance describes the SDF on its formation as divided into five regions, with '..four \\"corps\\", all dissimilar: the Eastern Arab Corps, based at Kasala, comprising mostly infantry companies, with a small mounted detachment; the Camel Corps in Kordofan, (another source refers to it as 'the Hajana') with a large element of camel-borne soldiers to patrol the vast desert expanses; the Western Arab Corps in Darfur consisting of a few mounted companies; and the Equatoria Corps (often referred to as the Southern Corps) in the three southern provinces, consisting of infantry companies - as, even leaving the tsetse fly out of account, camels and horses were of little value in the forest and swamp. Additionally, there was a detachment of cavalry at Shendi (other sources refer to the 'Shendi Horse') and of engineers at Omdurman, the total establishment being just under 5,000.'O'Ballance, 38. Ibrahim Abboud commanded the Camel Corps after the Second World War. (OB 50) \\"Before the establishment of the SDF, under the early Condominium, troops in the Sudan had been part of the Egyptian Army, which then basically consisted of eight Egyptian (that is, serving in Egypt) and seven Sudanese (serving in the Sudan) battalions.; the later was officered by both British and Egyptians, the soldiers being Egyptian fellaheen and Sudanese.\\"O'Ballance, 38. In peacetime, the SDF comprised approximately 4,500 regular Sudanese soldiers. During the Second World War, the SDF expanded greatly to counter the threat from the four neighbouring Italian territories: to the north-west, Libya, to the east Eritrea, Italian Somalia; and the recently (1936) occupied Abyssinia (Ethiopia). To accommodate the extra numbers, a new war-service battalion was formed, the Sudanese Frontier Force.See Playfair Vol. I, p.183. In wartime, the SDF grew to as many as 20,000 men. There were also two regiments of irregular special forces: * the Gideon Force (under Orde Wingate) * the Gazelle Force (war-formed; see Playfair, Volume I.). Background The British did not garrison their Empire exclusively with British troops; almost every territory had a local militia or an indigenous regular force. Prior to 1925, the garrison of the Sudan comprised a British battalion near the capital, and battalions of the Egyptian Army, both Egyptian and Sudanese, in the regional capitals. British military involvement in the Sudan goes back to the days of Generals Charles Gordon and Herbert Kitchener who were sent by London to defend British interests in the country. In 1896-98 Kitchener led the advance on Khartoum in command of an Anglo-Egyptian Expeditionary Force composed of British, Egyptian and Sudanese troops. As a young Army officer Winston Churchill saw military service in the Sudan. Since 1819 the Sudan had been a territory loosely administered by Egypt,Winston Churchill, The River War, Longman 1899 vol.1 p.20 but in the 1880s it had fallen to the forces of the Mahdi. From 1885 to 1898 it was ruled, de facto, by the Mahdi and his successor the Khalifa (literally 'Successor'). Following the defeat of the Mahdists at the Battle of Omdurman, the Sudan was reorganised as an Anglo-Egyptian Condominium. The Head of the Egyptian Army was the Governor-General and there was still a large garrison, as the territory was huge and the remoter parts, such as Darfur, were not pacified until 1916. In 1925, the Governor-General Sir Lee Stack was assassinated by a group of Egyptian nationalists, while being driven through Cairo. Sudanese soldiers in Khartoum mutinied,(2012) The Sudan Defence Force The Melik Society, Retrieved 20 April 2013 the Egyptian Army garrison of the Sudan was deemed unreliable and the Egyptian battalions were sent home, while the Sudanese battalions were disbanded. One hundred and forty British officers were transferred from the Egyptian army and a new Sudanese force was formed under the first Kaid Lewa Huddleston who had previously been acting Sirdar (Commander-in-Chief) of the Egyptian Army. The structure of the new force of about 6,000 troops was slightly different: a little looser and more territorial, to give a better esprit de corps and sense of responsibility in each 'Corps' for its own territory. Unlike the old battalions, with anonymous numbers, the names of the four main corps were Camel Corps, Eastern Arab Corps, Western Arab Corps and Equatoria Corps. These were intended to give a distinct, and regional, identity, like English county regiments. Recruitment in each Corps reflected the local ethnicities. These corps were supported by artillery, engineer, armoured car and machine-gun units; plus medical, signals and transport services. However, some continuity was maintained. The Egypt ruler, the Khedive, or Viceroy, had been, nominally, a subject of the Ottoman Sultan and so the SDF continued to use Egyptian ranks, which in turn were derived from former Ottoman titles. The result was that British officers in the Sudan were called Bimbashi not Major, or an Arabic equivalent, and Kaimakam. The use of Turkish military terms extended beyond the rank structure.  Inter-war years  The main duties of the SDF were internal security: assisting the police in the event of unrest, including restraining inter-tribal violence, cattle raiding and slave trading; or natural disaster. In such a vast country, companies could be detached on garrison duties far from the actual Corps headquarters. In the mid to late 1930s, the SDF was used to counter the aggressive actions of Italian military forces under Marshal Italo Balbo based in Italian North Africa (Africa Settentrionale Italiana, or ASI) Libya. In December 1933, the Italians probed various positions in the Jebel Uweinat area along the poorly defined border between the Kingdom of Egypt, the Sudan, and ASI. Responding to the Italian probes in the area, the SDF was ordered to occupy the Merga oasis and then the area around the Karkur Marr spring. The Italian conquest of Ethiopia led to a reorganisation and an increase in scope of the force. By June 1940 the SDF comprised twenty-one companies -- including five (later six) Motor Machine Gun Companies -- totalling 4,500 men. Second World War As part of the Anglo-Egyptian \\"Condominium,\\" the Sudan was at war with the Axis from the time Nazi Germany invaded Poland in 1939 and the United Kingdom declared war on Germany. Initially the war was limited to Europe and so the Sudan Defence Force had little to do other than preparation work should the land war reach Africa. From 10 June 1940, when Fascist Italy declared war on Britain and France, the SDF was involved in the East African Campaign. At first, the SDF went on the defensive against attacks into the Sudan by forces of the Italian Royal Army (Regio Esercito) and the Italian Royal Air Force (Regia Aeronautica) based in Italian East Africa (Africa Orientale Italiana, or AOI). The Italians occupied the railway junction at Kassala, the small fort at Gallabat, and the villages of Ghezzan, Kurmuk, and Dumbode on the Blue Nile. In the first days of August, an Italian force of irregular Eritreans raided as far north as Port Sudan.Cernuschi, Enrico. La resistenza sconosciuta in Africa Orientale The Sudan Defence Force fought during the East African Campaign on the \\"Northern Front\\" under the command of Lieutenant-General William Platt. In October 1940, three motor machine-gun companies from the SDF were part of Gazelle Force, a mobile reconnaissance and fighting force commanded by Colonel Frank Messervy. The Frontier battalion from the SDF was part of Gideon Force commanded by Major Orde Wingate. In January 1941, during the British and Commonwealth offensive into the AOI, the SDF took part in the successful invasion of Eritrea. During this invasion, the SDF contributed machine gun companies, howitzer batteries, and other forces (including some homemade armoured cars). The SDF also played an active role during the Western Desert Campaign along the Sudanese border with ASI in North Africa. The SDF was used to supply the Free French and then the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) garrisons of the former Italian Fort Taj at the Kufra oasis in southeastern Libya. In March 1941, French and LRDG forces had wrested control of the fort from the Italians during the Battle of Kufra. SDF convoys of 3-ton trucks had to make a round trip of about 1,300 miles to keep the garrisons at Kufra supplied with petrol, food, and other vital supplies. The overall scarcity of petrol meant that LRDG patrols could do little more than guard Kufra against attacks from the north. They were unable to raid northwards from Kufra. In February 1941, the situation was somewhat improved when twenty 10-ton trucks were added to the convoys. Ultimately the SDF took over the garrison duties at the oasis from the LRDG. In September 1942 Force Z the battalion of SDF working with the LRDG launched a raid on Jalo OasisMemories of World War II by P J Hurman, IWM 99/85/1. on Operation Nicety in support to Operation Agreement.John W Gordon,\\"The Other Desert War\\"p 127 accessed 9 sept 2020. The SDF provided the garrison for Jalo Oasis. British Military Intelligence in Cairo worked very closely with the SDF and used them in numerous operations during the North African campaign in World War II. In 1942 on instructions from London, British Military Intelligence, Cairo and elements of the Sudan Defence Force were involved with countering Operation Salaam, the infiltration of German Brandenburger commandos into Egypt. Together with British intelligence agents, members of the SDF were ordered to intercept and capture the German intelligence (Abwehr) commandos and their Hungarian guide, desert explorer L√°szl√≥ Alm√°sy. Even after the Tunisian Campaign had ended in Allied victory, SDF patrols were busy thwarting German efforts to land agents behind the lines. The Germans continued attempts to make contact with Arab rebels. On 15 May 1943, a four-engine aircraft with German markings attempted to land at El Mukaram only to be engaged and shot up by a SDF patrol. The aircraft was able to take off and make good its escape, but it did so with casualties and flying on two engines. By the end of the war, the SDF was an experienced military force with about 70 Sudanese officers, almost all of them Muslim northerners. Gradually Sudanese officers were appointed to replace British officers in the years that preceded independence.Abdel-Rahim, Muddathir \\"Imperialism & Nationalism in the Sudan: A Study in Constitutional & Political Development, 1899-1956\\" Ithaca (1987), Independence In March 1954 British Troops in the Sudan consisted of one battalion stationed in Khartoum, reporting ultimately to the Governor-General.British Parliament House of Lords Debate, 10 March 1954 The Governor-General's military commander was the Major-General Commanding British Troops in the Sudan, who was also Commandant of the Sudan Defence Force.

British officers  Most middle- ranking and senior officers of the SDF were British Army officers on secondment for a few years. The attraction was independence of command, sporting (game-hunting) opportunities in leisure hours and local promotion (1 rank).

All her life, she and her disfigured family experienced persecution from all the people around her because she is branded as the town jinx. She and her family tried to run away but ended up as a sideshow in a carnival. She was mistreated by everyone and became an object of jokes as well as of disgust. But the happy- go-lucky guy, Mendez is different. Mendez befriended the disfigured Carissa and saw what others failed to see, her beautiful heart. There came a time that Mendez ultimately fell in love with \\"the monkey-girl\\". Meanwhile, Alicia has a bad feeling that there's something not right in her own house. The famous model has a feeling that her husband, the famous plastic surgeon, Hugo Roldan, is having an affair with her own best friend, Morita. She caught him red- handed and decided to go away. Hugo tried to beg for mercy so she would not go but she still left. Tragically, Alicia's flight crashed in the sea and she was one of the casualties. They never found her body and Hugo is left with nothing but remorse and guilt. If only he could bring back the wife he failed to love with all his heart. That is when he found the half-dead Carissa lying in the streets. Mendez left for work in an island resort to earn money for him and Carissa. While he is away, Shirley, the girl who also likes Mendez, forged his hand writing making Carissa believe that he left her for good. Then an epidemic spread across town and the poor Carissa was stoned by a mob thinking she is the jinx that brought the epidemic. Mendez came back for Carissa but they told him that Carissa died in an accident, then showed to him a fake grave. Now with nothing left in her heart but vengeance, Carissa agrees to be Hugo's test patient for a new revolutionary surgical procedure that could copy another person's face. Carissa studied manners, etiquette, fashion and everything about the high society. Carissa took the identity of Alicia. She is now what Alicia was, Hugo's \\"wife\\" and a goddess in the fashion industry. She agreed to this arrangement because of 2 reasons; to show gratitude to Hugo and to exact revenge on everyone who made her suffer. She was surprised that Alicia owned a resort and her bodyguard is Mendez. She went to the people that caused her pain and showed Mendez how she made them suffer. With the change of her face, her heart also changed. But still, Mendez could not explain why he is falling for a \\"horrible\\" woman like \\"Alicia\\". She was supposed to punish him but ended up falling for him even more. She can't bear her feelings anymore now that she knows what Shirley actually did. She told everything to Mendez and the lovers picked up where they left off. They had an \\"affair\\" but she is afraid what would Hugo do now that she saw Hugo's evil side. She then learns about the dark secrets of the face she now possess. Secrets that could ruin Hugo and bring back to Mendez what was stolen from him. Mendez's father, Dr. Pedroza was a famous plastic surgeon who created the procedure. But young, ambitious doctor Hugo stole the plan then made it as his own, destroying Dr. Pedroza's reputation. He then seduced Mrs. Pedroza which led to the heart attack and death of Dr. Pedroza, leaving the poor kid, Mendez with nothing that's why he grew up in the streets. Hugo then experimented on countless women like Carissa but ended up with dead patients including Carissa's sister. Now, Carissa just wants to leave with Mendez and hatched a plan to take Hugo's wealth that is really for Mendez. But will their plan prevail? Now that Hugo has also a plan as diabolical as their own.

Licensed to Portland, it is owned by Saga Communications. The studios and offices are on Western Avenue in South Portland, Maine.ESPNportland.com/contact-us WZAN operates with 5,000 watts. By day, the station uses a non-directional antenna but at night the signal is directional to protect other radio stations on AM 970. The transmitter is located off Ellwood Avenue in Scarborough, Maine.Radio-Locator.com/WZAN WZAN's programming is also broadcast on FM translator W268CS at 101.5 MHz in Portland. History Logo as \\"Maine's Talk Radio\\" The station was originally WCSH, \\"The Voice from Sunrise Land.\\" It was based at the Congress Square Hotel, from which it got its call sign. It was the first station in Portland, and one of the earliest in Maine, signing on the air on July 13, 1925. WCSH was a charter affiliate of the NBC Red Network.Broadcasting Yearbook 1935 page 32 It carried NBC's schedule of dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts during the \\"Golden Age of Radio.\\" In the 1930s, WCSH broadcast on 940 kilocycles, at 2,500 watts by day and 1,000 watts at night. With the enactment of North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA) in 1941, WCSH shifted to 970 kHz. The power was boosted to 5,000 watts around the clock. In 1953, WCSH gained a sister station when Channel 6 WCSH-TV debuted. Because 970 was an NBC affiliate, Channel 6 also carried NBC TV shows. As network programming shifted from radio to television, WCSH 970 switched to a full service, middle of the road format of popular music, news and sports. From 1975 to 1977, 970 WCSH was a full time affiliate of NBC Radio's News And Information Service. WCSH continued as an all-news radio station on its own for several years after NIS was discontinued. In the 1980s, WCSH began simulcasting co-owned 100.9 WYNZ-FM using the call letters WYNZ. In 1993, WYNZ-AM-FM were bought by Saga Communications for $350,000.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1994 page B-166 AM 970 flipped to a hot talk format. It changed its call sign to WZAN to echo co-owned talk radio station 560 WGAN. The new format included syndicated wake up host Imus in the Morning until Don Imus' controversial statements about the Rutgers University women's basketball team in 2007. Also carried were Don & Mike, The Bob & Tom Show, Lex and Terry, NASCAR racing from Motor Racing Network and NFL football from Westwood One. In March 2009, the station ended its hot talk format. It changed programming to a more political base with Imus in The Morning re-added to the schedule. In addition, syndicated programs from Sean Hannity, Dave Ramsey and Laura Ingraham were put on the schedule. Starting January 1, 2016, WZAN's talk programming was shifted to co-owned 1490 WBAE. WZAN became a sports radio station, using the programming of the ESPN Radio Network. A couple of years later, an FM translator was added at 101.5 MHz so listeners in Portland and its adjacent suburbs could hear WZAN on either AM or FM radio.

There were 50 Series 122, 83 Series 123, 16 Series 125 and 6 Series 140 for a total of 155 locomotives. They were seen across Belgium on passenger and freight trains until they were retired in 2012. Class 23 was later fitted for multiple working, and were often found in pairs. There was no difference in power between the classes as they all used the same traction motors and control equipment. Class 25 was intended as a passenger engine. The main differences to Class 23 were the cables on the roof and the provision of wheelslip detection plus an improved starting system. The Class 25 roof cabling was later applied to all Class 22 and 23 locos as they passed through the works. These locomotives were the final development of the Type 122. They were originally called Type 125 and numbered 125.001 to 125.016. A second run of six locos produced Type 140, numbered 140.001-140.006 because their top speed was re-geared to 140 km/h (87 mph). This did not work out too well as the locos lost tractive effort and did not accelerate as fast as the normal Series 125 version. They were returned to standard with Class 125 by 1968 and numbered 125.101-125.106 1n 1971 all were renumbered into Series 25 with the numbers 2501-2522. In 1973 the last eight of them, 2515-2522, received the dual voltage equipment from 2239-2250, a third headlamp and Dutch safety equipment. This let them work into Holland hauling international passenger trains. This sub-series was renumbered 2551-2558 (Class 25.5) and painted dark blue with yellow bands. They continued in service pulling mostly freight trains all over the system and into Holland until their retirement in 2009. The Class 25.5 was the first class on SNCB to be modified for push-pull operations followed by Class 25. Class 25.5 locomotives were assigned to the Benelux limited stop service between Brussels and Amsterdam hauling I4 coaches. There were two terminal stations on the line, Antwerp Central and Amsterdam Central. Push pull was required to avoid the delays from having the locomotives run around the trains or another locomotive added at the other end. This idea was later applied to the Class 25 fleet so they could easily work peak hour trains on the electrified part of the network. A number of M2BD coaches were transformed into driving trailers for this purpose. Later on more M2BDs were transformed into driving trailers for Class 62/63 diesel locos. The M2BDs that worked with Class 25 had a pointed (seen from the side) cab end while the version for Class 62 was nearly completely flat. The reason for the difference was that each group of M2BD was made to function with only one loco type thus an M2BD for Class 25 would not be functional with a Class 62 and vice versa. 2557 changed identities with 2504 following an accident in 1979. 2504 (ex 125.004) received the dual voltage equipment, third headlight and Dutch safety equipment from 2557 (ex-2521, ex 125.105, ex-140.005) to keep the number of dual voltage locos available for passenger service the same. 2551 has been preserved by the PFT-TSP railway preservation group.

It is designated as a reliever airport and a regional general aviation airport by the FAA. It is privately owned by the New Brandywine Airport Club Inc, with a single fixed-base operator (New Brandywine Aero, Inc.), aircraft repair, as well as flight training in both fixed-wing and rotary aircraft. The American Helicopter Museum and Education Center is located adjacent to the airport, with taxiway access. The airport identifier was previously N99 until it was changed to OQN in 2007. The airport does not currently have an IATA identifier.  History  = Early Days = West Chester's first airport, Sky Haven Airport, opened in 1929 on farmland in East Goshen Township, two miles east of present day Brandywine Airport. Sky Haven operated for three years, when the airport neighbors filed a civil lawsuit. Judge William Windle ruled the airport a public nuisance and ordered it to cease operation. Brandywine Airport, then named West Chester Airport, opened in its current location in 1940. Paul Gingrich opened the airport using a $623,500 grant from the Civil Aeronautics Board. Gingrich was a flight instructor at the former Main Line Airport in Paoli, Pennsylvania, which was rapidly expanding that flight school with funding from the newly-created Civilian Pilot Training Program. West Chester State Teacher's College (now West Chester University) was already offering aeronautics courses and was interested in an airport closer to the campus. In 1947, William B. Wilson purchased the airport, which had two grass runways (the current runway 9/27, a perpendicular runway 18/36), and several maintenance buildings. The airport underwent significant improvements in the 1980s. Runway 9/27, as well as the taxiways and ramps, were all paved, and a new terminal building was constructed. In 1982, the airport was renamed Brandywine Airport. Expansion of the neighboring industrial park also led to the removal of Runway 18/36. = New Owners and Improvements = In 1997, Wilson put the airport up for sale as an industrial park. A group of pilots formed the non-profit New Brandywine Airport Club (NBAC) to purchase and run the airport. Wilson was supportive of this plan, and the sale to NBAC for $2.5 million closed on July 25, 1997. To raise initial financing, NBAC sold ownership shares valued at $10,000. Two shares were required for a Tee hangar, and four shares were required for a corporate hangar. In addition, owners were responsible for construction costs. In total, 50 Tee hangars and 10 corporate hangars were constructed after the purchase. After the purchase by NBAC, several significant projects were undertaken to rehabilitate and improve the facilities. The western end of Runway 9/27 was lengthened by approximately 300 feet in 1997. In 2001, the airport received a grant from Pennsylavania's Department of Transport (PennDOT) to develop an airport layout plan, which helped make the airport eligible for further federal and state funding under the FAA's Airport Improvement Program. Additional corporate hangars were constructed in 2004. In 2006, several projects were completed to improved safety and night operations: Runway 9/27 was resurfaced, new night lighting was added, a precision approach path indicator (PAPI) was added to the runway, and Taxiway A was lengthened to the western end of the runway. In addition, the airport commissioned a new AWOS weather reporting system in 2007. Once the AWOS was operational, the airport's FAA location identifier was changed to OQN from N99, and the airport was assigned the ICAO identifier KOQN. Since then, the airport received PennDOT grants to replace the fuel piping system, install a new airport beacon, and rehabilitate Taxiway A. The FAA classifies Brandywine Airport as a reliever airport for handling overflow general aviation aircraft from Philadelphia International Airport. Brandywine is also categorized as a regional general aviation airport because of its significance within the metropolitan region. PennDOT's Bureau of Aviation classifies Brandywine as an Intermediate general aviation airport. A 2011 study commissioned by PennDOT reported that Brandywine Airport had an impact of $9.4 million to the state economy. = Expansion Plans = The airport has commissioned a feasibility study for the implementation of a localizer performance with vertical guidance (LPV) approach for runway 9/27. The LPV study also involves the removal of trees to facilitate night VFR operations and vertically guided approaches. The airport is expecting another grant from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Bureau of Aviation to widen Runway 9/27 to 60 feet. Additional proposed projects include replacing the AWOS III and a rehabilitation of the runway lighting. = Accidents and Incidents = Since 1962, two fatal accidents have occurred at Brandywine airport. * On August 22, 2005, a Piper PA-32R-301 crashed into the trees after an aborted landing, killing both the pilot and the passenger. Witnesses observed the plane attempt to land and contact the runway with the landing gear retracted. The pilot then aborted the landing, but crashed 1/2 mile from the runway with the landing gear extended. The investigation found indications that the propeller had been damaged by contact with the runway. * On March 29, 2015, two pilots were killed when their Piper PA-28-140 crashed after takeoff on Runway 27. The subsequent investigation indicated that the plane engine exhibited popping sounds and intermittent loss of power during run-up and take off. Shortly after takeoff, the aircraft went into a stall and crashed into a field about 2 miles west of the airport.  Facilities  Brandywine Airport covers at an elevation of . In the year ending September 21, 2016 the airport had 60,065 aircraft operations, average 164 per day: 98% general aviation and 2% air taxi. 124 aircraft were then based at the airport: 85% single-engine, 6% multi-engine, 1% jet and 8% helicopter. The one runway, 9/27, is 3,347 by 50 feet (1,020 x 15 m) asphalt. The runway is equipped with low-intensity runway lights (LIRL) and a 2-light precision approach path indicator (PAPI). The airport has one terminal building served by the single fixed-base operator, New Brandywine Aero, Inc. Maintenance services are provided by Flight Dynamics. Brandywine Flight School provides fixed-wing instruction. The American Helicopter Museum and Education Center is adjacent to the airport on the north, with taxiway access to the runway. The museum hosted the Rotorfest helicopter airshow annually from 1996 through 2014.

It was the first release for Roger Corman's distribution company New World Pictures. After successfully distributing Beast of Blood in 1970, producer Kane W. Lynn (as Hemisphere Pictures) tried to get the distribution rights to Ashley's next horror film, titled Beast of the Yellow Night. Ashley and his production company Four Associates Ltd. put up the money to produce the film themselves in the Philippines, and instead of allowing Lynn to distribute it, he made a deal with Roger Corman's then-fledgling New World Pictures instead. Lynn's ex-business partner in Hemisphere Pictures, Eddie Romero, was hired to direct and co-produce, but Lynn was cut out of the deal. Ashley's Four Associates Ltd. went on to produce several other films in the Philippines, such as The Twilight People, The Woman Hunt and Ebony, Ivory & Jade, before disbanding. Lynn invested in Sam Sherman's 1971 sci-fi film Brain of Blood, which did not fare well, and died soon after of cancer in 1975. Plot The film is set near the end of World War II in the Philippines. Satan (Vic D√≠az) saves murderer Joseph Langdon (Ashley) from death on condition that he become his disciple. Satan has Langdon inhabit the bodies of several people over the years, bringing out the latent evil of those around them and carrying out the devil's evil deeds for the next 25 years. Inhabiting the body of Phillip Rogers and with his face, Langdon tries to exert his own free will, but becomes a hairy, murderous beast ‚Äî a werewolf on the rampage ‚Äî and kills several people. His wife Julia (Mary Wilcox) tries to support and comfort him during the day, as does his brother Earl (Ken Metcalfe), but when he meets blind former bandit Sabasas Nan (Andres Centenera), he starts to find the strength to fight back. Inspector de Santos (Leopoldo Salcedo) recognizes Rogers as being Langdon, and takes him into custody, putting him under house arrest. Rogers attempts to make love to his wife, but changes again and escapes. When he and Nan try to leave the city, they encounter the police and military and Rogers changes again, battling against the combined forces. When a gravely wounded Sabasas Nan asks Rogers to pray for him, he does so, and at that moment, he is shot by Lt. Campos, dies and reverts to his true age, his soul now free.

Release Beast of the Yellow Night was released in 1971 in the US. \\"We really tried for quality\\", Romero said later. \\"I don't think it did very well.

The film was reissued several times after its initial DVD release, usually as part of a multi-disc combo pack. It was last released by VCI Video as a part of a four-disc combo pack. Reception Beast of the Yellow Night received mostly negative reviews upon its release. Linda Gross of the Los Angeles Times called it a \\"confusing, implausible rather poorly made horror film\\", although she admitted it had \\"a nice twist\\" showing \\"two kinds of caring: that of a woman whose love implies expectations and that of a friend who wants nothing and is thereby able to give more.\\" Graeme Clark of The Spinning Image rated the film three out of 10 stars, criticizing the film's overly talky and confusing script. Legacy Ashley later became a producer on The A Team TV series. He made a cameo in an episode as a backer of a horror film called The Beast of the Yellow Night.

First mentioned in Edna's monologues in the 1960s, Madge was subsequently depicted on stage, TV and film, over three decades, by several people. The character was discontinued following the retirement of British actress Emily Perry, who played the role for over 15 years. Origins of character When Barry Humphries first began to perform as Edna Everage during his one-man shows, the character of Madge Allsop, Edna's bridesmaid and companion, was only ever mentioned in passing and never actually depicted on stage. By the early 1970s, Madge was an increasingly strong presence in Edna's on-stage musings, but still remained unseen. In Barry Humphries' 1971 Australian show, A Load of Old Stuffe, her monologue was entitled \\"Edna and Madge Allsop in Stratford\\",Theatre programme for Melbourne production of A Load of Old Stuffe, 1971. while a later one, performed in the 1974 show At least you can say you have seen it, was entitled \\"Polish up your Kiwi (with Madge Allsop)\\".Theatre programme for Melbourne production of At least you can say you've seen it, 1974. In 1976, Humphries decided to finally bring Madge Allsop to life with an appearance in his new BBC TV series, The Barry Humphries Show. She was portrayed by the London-based expatriate Australian actress Madeleine Orr, who appeared as Madge on several subsequent occasions until her death three years later. Over a period of almost thirty years, from 1976 until 2003, the adult Madge Allsop was portrayed by at least six different people: *1976‚Äì79 ‚Äì Madeleine Orr *1982 ‚Äì Unidentified actress/model, in the book Dame Edna's Bedside Companion *1987 ‚Äì Connie Hobbs (in the film Les Patterson saves the world) *1987‚Äì2003 ‚Äì Emily Perry (on stage and TV) *1989 ‚Äì Anne Charleston (as a joke, on one episode of The Dame Edna Experience) *1998 ‚Äì Kerris Peeling (who portrayed Madge as a young woman in the stage show Dame Edna: The Spectacle) Appearances =Film and television= Madge Allsop was first portrayed on television in 1976, when she appeared (played by actress Madeleine Orr) in an episode of the BBC series The Barry Humphries Show. Following Orr's death in 1979, the role of Madge was re-cast. She appeared alongside Dame Edna on the BBC Parkinson show in 1982, with her face covered in bandages. The character was written into Humphries' 1987 film, Les Patterson Saves the World, and was portrayed, as a one-off appearance, by Australian actress Connie Hobbs. Later that same year, Humphries announced his search for \\"definitive Madge\\", who would appear alongside Edna in his new BBC TV series, The Dame Edna Experience. Of the audition, Humphries recalled, \\"all of them tried too hard. Some were whimsical, some camp, but most were far too over the top to resemble an oppressed, inarticulate New Zealand spinster whom life had passed by.\\"Humphries, Barry. My Life as Me, pp 232‚Äì33. However, after they saw Emily Perry's understated performance, they knew that they had found the perfect Madge. As she later recalled, \\"I did nothing at the audition, and I've done nothing ever since.\\"Barker, Dennis. \\"Dame Edna's Doleful Sidekick\\", The Age [Melbourne], February 25, 2008. Emily Perry's appearance on the Dame Edna Experience was well-received; she subsequently became the definitive Madge Allsop, reprising the role in many of Humphries' other TV specials, including One more Audience with Dame Edna Everage (1988), A Night on Mount Edna (1990), Dame Edna's Neighbourhood Watch (1992), Dame Edna's Hollywood (1993) and Dame Edna's Work Experience (1996). Perry's last on-screen appearance as Madge Allsop was a cameo in the TV special Dame Edna lives at the Palace (2003), in which the then 97-year-old actress was 'caught' in bed with Ozzy Osbourne. Emily Perry became so strongly identified with the character of Madge Allsop that, after her retirement in 2004, the character of Madge was also retired, as it was felt that no other actress could ever recreate her. When Humphries embarked upon a new TV talk show in 2007, The Dame Edna Treatment, the role of Dame Edna's silent scapegoat was filled by an actress portraying her errant (and hitherto unseen) daughter, Valmai Gittis. Dame Edna (belatedly) publicly acknowledged the death of Madge in her 2019 TV special Dame Edna Rules The Waves, first broadcast on BBC1, December 31, 2019https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000ctfn. During the show, Dame Edna attempts to dispose of Madge's ashes from the porthole of her luxury yacht, The Ocean Widow, but is prevented from doing so to protect the environment. Madge's last will and testament insisted that Dame Edna took on the care of her sister Mabel, who has now become Dame Edna's silent sidekick, sticking labels on her celebrity guests. Mabel is portrayed by British actress Anne Rason. =In Print= Madge Allsop has been referenced in a number of books written by Barry Humphries since the mid-1970s. Photographs of Madge (as portrayed by Madeleine Orr) appeared in Dame Edna's Coffee Table Book (1976) and The Sound of Edna: Dame Edna's Family Songbook (1979). Because of Orr's death from cancer that same year, Madge was subsequently portrayed in Humphries' next book, Dame Edna's Beside Companion (1982), by an unidentified stand-in, whose entire head was concealed by bandages. For the purposes of the narrative, this was explained away by the claim that \\"Madge\\" had recently undergone cosmetic surgery. The character of Madge Allsop figured prominently in the book My Gorgeous Life (1989), which, although written by Humphries, was purported to be an autobiography of Dame Edna herself. The book provides much background to Madge and Edna's ongoing friendship, and includes a detailed account of the death of Madge's husband, Douglas Allsop, whilst on their honeymoon in Rotorua. In the line drawings that illustrate the book (drawn by John Richardson), the young Madge is depicted as a recognizable caricature of Emily Perry. Since the 1980s, theatre programmes for Barry Humphries' one-man shows have frequently included photographs of Madge Allsop (as portrayed by Emily Perry) alongside those of Dame Edna and Sir Les Patterson. For example, the glossy souvenir programme for Humphries' Australian tour, Dame Edna: Back to my roots and other suckers included depictions of Madge in her pink frilly ‚ÄúEdna Loves Me‚Äù apron, dancing with Dame Edna while wearing a Vivienne Westwood outfit, shopping with Dame Edna in an exclusive boutique, posing mournfully along Errol Flynn's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and being attacked by a giant prop shark in Edna's swimming pool.Theatre program for Melbourne production of Back to my Roots and other Suckers, 2003. =On Stage= Madge Allsop's most notable appearance on stage was as part of the 1998 West End production of Dame Edna: the Spectacle. The First Act of this show was essentially a retelling of Dame Edna's life story in the form of a lavish stage musical, and Madge Allsop was portrayed as a young woman by Kerris Peeling and as a child by either (depending on the performance) Keely Fawcett, Caroline Graham or Gabrielle Hoffman. Emily Perry, by then 90 years old, also appeared briefly as the present-day Madge. Fictional biography =Early life= According to Dame Edna's autobiography, Madge Allsop was born Marjorie Kiri McWhirter in Palmerston North, New Zealand.Everage, Dame Edna. My Gorgeous Life. South Melbourne: Macmillan Company, 1989. Her date of birth has not been confirmed, although the fact that she was reportedly orphaned in 1931 \\"at a young age\\", as a result of the Napier earthquake, implies that she was born in the mid-1920s (and is, therefore, about the same age as Dame Edna herself).Theatre programme for London production of Dame Edna: The Spectacle, 1998. Madge then lived with an aunt until the age of ten, when she moved to Melbourne, Australia. It was while attending Moonee Ponds Girls' Grammar School that she met young Edna Mae Beazley, who took pity on her and became a reluctant friend. It is recorded that the young Madge's cardigan, before it was burnt in the school incinerator, yielded some seeds that took root in the school grounds and produced Australia's first kiwi fruit tree. In 1951, when Edna married Norm Everage, she chose Madge as one of her four bridesmaids‚ÄîMadge caught Edna's bouquet \\"on the back of her neck\\". When Edna was pregnant with her first child, Madge returned to New Zealand to live with her mother's half-sister, Heather McDonald. In her memoirs, Edna described going down to Melbourne's Station Pier to see her off: ‚ÄúI was naturally very sweet and affectionate to her, since I never expected to see her again‚Äù. Some years later, as Edna was planning her first trip to London, she received an invitation to act as Matron of Honour at Madge's wedding to Douglas Hugh Allsop, who ran a tourist bus company in Palmerston North. Edna attended the ceremony in Auckland and, at Madge's request, accompanied the couple on their honeymoon to Rotorua. Douglas Allsop, however, was killed when, while visiting the famous hot mud pools, he leant too far over the railing and fell in. The widowed Madge subsequently returned to Australia with Edna, who \\"took full responsibility for the life and well-being of her sadly sticken school friend, even charitably incorporating her into some of her theatrrical and television events\\". =Personal life= There is considerable evidence that Madge Allsop is a lesbian, or at least bisexual. Dame Edna's son, Kenny, has made this suggestion at least twice; it is noted, for example, in the lyrics to the 1978 song ‚ÄúMy Bridesmaid and I‚Äù, in which Edna sings, ‚ÄúKenny thinks that she's bi...‚Äù.Humphries, Barry and Nic Rowley. The Sound of Edna: Dame Edna's Family Songbook. His claims were re-iterated in Dame Edna's autobiography, My Gorgeous Life, when she recalled Kenny's Coming Out, and, after misunderstanding her response, his assumption that she and Madge were also an item. Kenny's sister, Valmai Gittis, makes a similar claim about their mothers relationship with Madge in an unpublished memoir, Edna Dearest, excerpts of which were reproduced in the 1982 book, Dame Edna's Bedside Companion. A photograph, published in the same source, shows Madge Allsop watching adult videos with titles such as Sapphic Traffic, Loins of Lesbos and Kinky Konvent Kapers. It is also revealed the Edna and Madge have been known to share a bed, although, by Edna's account, this is entirely platonic. =Later years= In 1982, Madge Allsop underwent what was described as ‚Äúsome radical naso-labial corrective therapy‚Äù, which necessitated her entire head being encased with bandages.Humphries, Barry. Dame Edna's Bedside Companion, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1982. Towards the end of that decade, she underwent a radical facelift under Dr Christiaan Barnard, which made her resemble Australian actress Anne Charleston. The operation, however, was subsequently reversed.

It is located on Mill Street (US 9) just south of the intersection with NY 308 at the center of the village. It is a stone Colonial Revival structure built in 1940, during the New Deal. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a native of nearby Hyde Park, took a personal interest in its design, as he did with other post offices in Dutchess County built during his administration. He chose a ruined historic house, whose stones were used in the post office, as its model, and spoke at its dedication. In 1989 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is also a contributing property to the Rhinebeck Village Historic District. Building The post office is a one- and-a-half-story fieldstone building with a low-sloping jerkin roof shingled in asbestos treated to look like wood. It flares out over a porch that runs the length of the eastern (front) elevation. Two large brick chimneys rise from the ends, both next to a small dormer window on the north and south faces. The porch is wooden, supported by square piers, with a bluestone floor. At either end of the facade are the large cornerstones, also of bluestone. One is a standard datestone giving the names of the participants in the ceremony; the other says that the building is a replica of the 1700 Beekman House and that stones from the ruins of that house were used to build the post office. The main entrance, a simulated Dutch door, is within a wooden vestibule. Inside, the lobby stretches across the front of the building. It is floored in random-width pegged oak. Pine wainscoting rises to a ceiling with hand-hewn exposed beams. Two display cases contain other remnants of the Beekman House. Above the wainscot are murals depicting scenes from local history, including the post office's groundbreaking ceremony. Two original oak counters remain. The postmaster's office to the north is paneled. A long wing projects to the west, where the parking lot, accessed from nearby West Market Street, is located. Two original cast iron lamps are located along the sidewalk leading to the entrance from Mill Street. History Rhinebeck Post Office, April 2009 Even before he became governor of New York State in 1928, Roosevelt had taken a keen interest in reviving the use of fieldstone in the Hudson Valley, the material favored by many early Dutch settlers of the region, including his own ancestors. He had made sure, in the mid-1920s, that Hyde Park's library, built in his father's memory, used stone. As president he had ensured that new post offices in Beacon and Poughkeepsie used the material. The latter had also emulated an earlier building, Dutchess County's 1809 courthouse. After Poughkeepsie's post office was completed and opened, Postmaster General James Farley asked Roosevelt if he wanted to start work on a new post office in Hyde Park, a project he had wanted to undertake. Congress had authorized both post offices in 1937. Since Rhinebeck was a larger community with a more pressing need for a new post office, the president told Farley to give it priority first. The town helped matters along by selling the site of their 1872 town hall to the federal government for $16,000 ($ in contemporary dollars). Roosevelt insisted that the new post office be built in the style of Kipsbergen, or the Beekman House, a nearby home (destroyed by fire in the early 20th century) where some of his ancestors had lived, which features a similarly steep-sloped front roof. There was some opposition to this from local historians since they did not think the style typical of Dutch homes in the region, but eventually it was built as Roosevelt wished. Rudolph Stanley- Brown, a former Treasury Department architect then in private practice, handled the details of the design. Many of Kipsbergen's stones remained, and these were used in the post office's construction. Ultimately, 90% of the front wall was built of its stones. Local artist Olin Dows, head of the Treasury Relief Art Project, later painted a mural inside of scenes from Rhinebeck's history. Both Farley and Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. were present at the dedication ceremony on May 1, 1939, along with the crown prince and princess of Denmark and Iceland, who were touring the U.S. at the time. All of them ceremonially laid the first mortar on the cornerstone. The president spoke at length about the building and its design: Three of the six stone post offices in the region whose design Roosevelt oversawIn addition to those already discussed, these include the post offices in Wappingers Falls (now the village hall) and Ellenville, across the river in Ulster County. were based on historic buildings no longer extant at the time of their construction. Of those three, Rhinebeck's most closely replicates its original, and is the only one with an exhibit inside of some other remnants of that model.The later Hyde Park post office is also an exact duplicate of the 1772 John Bard House it was based on, but in stone rather than the original's frame. Its porch and lobby mimic a typical 18th-century colonial home's finishing. The paneling in the postmaster's office imitates a parlor of that era. A few changes have been made to the building over time, such as the installation of modern light fixtures in the lobby and aluminum-muntined storm windows, but it has otherwise remained largely intact. In 1989 the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places, a contributing property to the existing Rhinebeck Village Historic District.

Statue  The statue was restored in 2012 Ernest Gillick's statue of Sir Francis Powell stands in Mesnes Park, Wigan. Erected in his home town in 1910, the statue is made from bronze, which after turning green in colour due to lack of treatment, was restored in 2012. The statue shows Powell sat in his office chair, deep in thought. It also shows his right leg crossing in front of his left, which makes his right shoe protrude out further than the statue's base. It has long been a long-standing superstition that the rubbing of Powell's protruding shoe will bring a person good luck. Local belief in this tale is so strong that the shoe of the statue was never allowed to turn green due to the constant rubbing by locals and tourists.

There were 50 Series 122, 83 Series 123, 16 Series 125 and 6 Series 140 for a total of 155 locomotives. They were seen across Belgium on passenger and freight trains until they were retired in 2012. There was no difference in power between the classes as they all used the same traction motors and control equipment. Class 25 was intended as a passenger engine. The main differences to Class 23 were the cables on the roof and the provision of wheelslip detection plus an improved starting system. The Class 25 roof cabling was later applied to all Class 22 and 23 locos as they passed through the works. They were painted dark blue with a yellow band low on the body. Unlike the other 1950's locomotives, Class 25.5's nose and side numbers plus their SNCB logos were in chrome rather than being painted on. The Class 25.5 was the first class on SNCB to be modified for push-pull operations followed by Class 25. In 1973 the last eight locomotives of Class 25, 2515-2522, received the dual voltage equipment from locomotives 2239-2250 and a third headlamp.

Sliding window protocols are used where reliable in-order delivery of packets is required, such as in the data link layer (OSI layer 2) as well as in the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). They are also used to improve efficiency when the channel may include high latency. Packet-based systems are based on the idea of sending a batch of data, the packet, along with additional data that allows the receiver to ensure it was received correctly, perhaps a checksum. When the receiver verifies the data, it sends an acknowledgment signal, or \\"ACK\\", back to the sender to indicate it can send the next packet. In a simple automatic repeat request protocol (ARQ), the sender stops after every packet and waits for the receiver to ACK. This ensures packets arrive in the correct order, as only one may be sent at a time. The time that it takes for the ACK signal to be received may represent a significant amount of time compared to the time needed to send the packet. In this case, the overall throughput may be much lower than theoretically possible. To address this, sliding window protocols allow a selected number of packets, the window, to be sent without having to wait for an ACK. Each packet receives a sequence number, and the ACKs send back that number. The protocol keeps track of which packets have been ACKed, and when they are received, sends more packets. In this way, the window slides along the stream of packets making up the transfer. Sliding windows are a key part of many protocols. It is a key part of the TCP protocol, which inherently allows packets to arrive out of order, and is also found in many file transfer protocols like UUCP-g and ZMODEM as a way of improving efficiency compared to non-windowed protocols like XMODEM. Basic concept Conceptually, each portion of the transmission (packets in most data link layers, but bytes in TCP) is assigned a unique consecutive sequence number, and the receiver uses the numbers to place received packets in the correct order, discarding duplicate packets and identifying missing ones. The problem with this is that there is no limit on the size of the sequence number that can be required. By placing limits on the number of packets that can be transmitted or received at any given time, a sliding window protocol allows an unlimited number of packets to be communicated using fixed-size sequence numbers. The term \\"window\\" on the transmitter side represents the logical boundary of the total number of packets yet to be acknowledged by the receiver. The receiver informs the transmitter in each acknowledgment packet the current maximum receiver buffer size (window boundary). The TCP header uses a 16 bit field to report the receiver window size to the sender. Therefore, the largest window that can be used is 216 = 64 kilobytes. In slow-start mode, the transmitter starts with low packet count and increases the number of packets in each transmission after receiving acknowledgment packets from receiver. For every ack packet received, the window slides by one packet (logically) to transmit one new packet. When the window threshold is reached, the transmitter sends one packet for one ack packet received. If the window limit is 10 packets then in slow start mode the transmitter may start transmitting one packet followed by two packets (before transmitting two packets, one packet ack has to be received), followed by three packets and so on until 10 packets. But after reaching 10 packets, further transmissions are restricted to one packet transmitted for one ack packet received. In a simulation this appears as if the window is moving by one packet distance for every ack packet received. On the receiver side also the window moves one packet for every packet received. The sliding window method ensures that traffic congestion on the network is avoided. The application layer will still be offering data for transmission to TCP without worrying about the network traffic congestion issues as the TCP on sender and receiver side implement sliding windows of packet buffer. The window size may vary dynamically depending on network traffic. For the highest possible throughput, it is important that the transmitter is not forced to stop sending by the sliding window protocol earlier than one round-trip delay time (RTT). The limit on the amount of data that it can send before stopping to wait for an acknowledgment should be larger than the bandwidth-delay product of the communications link. If it is not, the protocol will limit the effective bandwidth of the link. Motivation  In any communication protocol based on automatic repeat request for error control, the receiver must acknowledge received packets. If the transmitter does not receive an acknowledgment within a reasonable time, it re-sends the data. A transmitter that does not get an acknowledgment cannot know if the receiver actually received the packet; it may be that it was lost or damaged in transmission. If the error detection mechanism reveals corruption, the packet will be ignored by the receiver and a negative or duplicate acknowledgement will be sent by the receiver. The receiver may also be configured to not send any acknowledgement at all. Similarly, the receiver is usually uncertain about whether its acknowledgements are being received. It may be that an acknowledgment was sent, but was lost or corrupted in the transmission medium. In this case, the receiver must acknowledge the retransmission to prevent the data being continually resent, but must otherwise ignore it. Protocol operation The transmitter and receiver each have a current sequence number nt and nr, respectively. They each also have a window size wt and wr. The window sizes may vary, but in simpler implementations they are fixed. The window size must be greater than zero for any progress to be made. As typically implemented, nt is the next packet to be transmitted, i.e. the sequence number of the first packet not yet transmitted. Likewise, nr is the first packet not yet received. Both numbers are monotonically increasing with time; they only ever increase. The receiver may also keep track of the highest sequence number yet received; the variable ns is one more than the sequence number of the highest sequence number received. For simple receivers that only accept packets in order (wr = 1), this is the same as nr, but can be greater if wr > 1. Note the distinction: all packets below nr have been received, no packets above ns have been received, and between nr and ns, some packets have been received. When the receiver receives a packet, it updates its variables appropriately and transmits an acknowledgment with the new nr. The transmitter keeps track of the highest acknowledgment it has received na. The transmitter knows that all packets up to, but not including na have been received, but is uncertain about packets between na and ns; i.e. na ‚â§ nr ‚â§ ns. The sequence numbers always obey the rule that na ‚â§ nr ‚â§ ns ‚â§ nt ‚â§ na + wt. That is: * na ‚â§ nr: The highest acknowledgement received by the transmitter cannot be higher than the highest nr acknowledged by the receiver. * nr ‚â§ ns: The span of fully received packets cannot extend beyond the end of the partially received packets. * ns ‚â§ nt: The highest packet received cannot be higher than the highest packet sent. * nt ‚â§ na + wt: The highest packet sent is limited by the highest acknowledgement received and the transmit window size. =Transmitter operation= Whenever the transmitter has data to send, it may transmit up to wt packets ahead of the latest acknowledgment na. That is, it may transmit packet number nt as long as nt < na+wt. In the absence of a communication error, the transmitter soon receives an acknowledgment for all the packets it has sent, leaving na equal to nt. If this does not happen after a reasonable delay, the transmitter must retransmit the packets between na and nt. Techniques for defining \\"reasonable delay\\" can be extremely elaborate, but they only affect efficiency; the basic reliability of the sliding window protocol does not depend on the details. =Receiver operation= Every time a packet numbered x is received, the receiver checks to see if it falls in the receive window, nr ‚â§ x < nr+wr. (The simplest receivers only have to keep track of one value nr=ns.) If it falls within the window, the receiver accepts it. If it is numbered nr, the receive sequence number is increased by 1, and possibly more if further consecutive packets were previously received and stored. If x > nr, the packet is stored until all preceding packets have been received.Peterson, Larry L. & Davie, Bruce S. \\"Computer Networks: A Systems Approach\\", Morgan Kaufmann, 2000. If x‚â•ns, the latter is updated to ns=x+1. If the packet's number is not within the receive window, the receiver discards it and does not modify nr or ns. Whether the packet was accepted or not, the receiver transmits an acknowledgment containing the current nr. (The acknowledgment may also include information about additional packets received between nr or ns, but that only helps efficiency.) Note that there is no point having the receive window wr larger than the transmit window wt, because there is no need to worry about receiving a packet that will never be transmitted; the useful range is 1 ‚â§ wr ‚â§ wt. =Sequence number range required= Sequence numbers modulo 4, with wr=1. Initially, nt=nr=0 So far, the protocol has been described as if sequence numbers are of unlimited size, ever-increasing. However, rather than transmitting the full sequence number x in messages, it is possible to transmit only x mod N, for some finite N. (N is usually a power of 2.) For example, the transmitter will only receive acknowledgments in the range na to nt, inclusive. Since it guarantees that nt‚àína ‚â§ wt, there are at most wt+1 possible sequence numbers that could arrive at any given time. Thus, the transmitter can unambiguously decode the sequence number as long as N > wt. A stronger constraint is imposed by the receiver. The operation of the protocol depends on the receiver being able to reliably distinguish new packets (which should be accepted and processed) from retransmissions of old packets (which should be discarded, and the last acknowledgment retransmitted). This can be done given knowledge of the transmitter's window size. After receiving a packet numbered x, the receiver knows that x < na+wt, so na > x‚àíwt. Thus, packets numbered x‚àíwt will never again be retransmitted. The lowest sequence number we will ever receive in future is ns‚àíwt The receiver also knows that the transmitter's na cannot be higher than the highest acknowledgment ever sent, which is nr. So the highest sequence number we could possibly see is nr+wt ‚â§ ns+wt. Thus, there are 2wt different sequence numbers that the receiver can receive at any one time. It might therefore seem that we must have N ‚â• 2wt. However, the actual limit is lower. The additional insight is that the receiver does not need to distinguish between sequence numbers that are too low (less than nr) or that are too high (greater than or equal to ns+wr). In either case, the receiver ignores the packet except to retransmit an acknowledgment. Thus, it is only necessary that N ‚â• wt+wr. As it is common to have wrt (e.g. see Go-Back-N below), this can permit larger wt within a fixed N. Examples =The simplest sliding window: stop-and- wait= Although commonly distinguished from the sliding-window protocol, the stop-and-wait ARQ protocol is actually the simplest possible implementation of it. The transmit window is 1 packet, and the receive window is 1 packet. Thus, N = 2 possible sequence numbers (conveniently represented by a single bit) are required. Ambiguity example The transmitter alternately sends packets marked \\"odd\\" and \\"even\\". The acknowledgments likewise say \\"odd\\" and \\"even\\". Suppose that the transmitter, having sent an odd packet, did not wait for an odd acknowledgment, and instead immediately sent the following even packet. It might then receive an acknowledgment saying \\"expecting an odd packet next\\". This would leave the transmitter in a quandary: has the receiver received both of the packets, or neither? =Go-Back-N= Go-Back-N ARQ is the sliding window protocol with wt>1, but a fixed wr=1. The receiver refuses to accept any packet but the next one in sequence. If a packet is lost in transit, following packets are ignored until the missing packet is retransmitted, a minimum loss of one round trip time. For this reason, it is inefficient on links that suffer frequent packet loss. Ambiguity example Suppose that we are using a 3-bit sequence number, such as is typical for HDLC. This gives N=23=8. Since wr=1, we must limit wt‚â§7. This is because, after transmitting 7 packets, there are 8 possible results: Anywhere from 0 to 7 packets could have been received successfully. This is 8 possibilities, and the transmitter needs enough information in the acknowledgment to distinguish them all. If the transmitter sent 8 packets without waiting for acknowledgment, it could find itself in a quandary similar to the stop-and-wait case: does the acknowledgment mean that all 8 packets were received successfully, or none of them? =Selective repeat= The most general case of the sliding window protocol is Selective Repeat ARQ. This requires a much more capable receiver, which can accept packets with sequence numbers higher than the current nr and store them until the gap is filled in. The advantage, however, is that it is not necessary to discard following correct data for one round-trip time before the transmitter can be informed that a retransmission is required. This is therefore preferred for links with low reliability and/or a high bandwidth- delay product. The window size wr need only be larger than the number of consecutive lost packets that can be tolerated. Thus, small values are popular; wr=2 is common. Ambiguity example The extremely popular HDLC protocol uses a 3-bit sequence number, and has optional provision for selective repeat. However, if selective repeat is to be used, the requirement that nt+nr ‚â§ 8 must be maintained; if wr is increased to 3, wt must be decreased to 6. Suppose that wr =2, but an unmodified transmitter is used with wt =7, as is typically used with the go-back-N variant of HDLC. Further suppose that the receiver begins with nr =ns =0. Now suppose that the receiver sees the following series of packets (all modulo 8): : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 (pause) 0 Because wr =2, the receiver will accept and store the final packet 0 (thinking it is packet 8 in the series), while requesting a retransmission of packet 7. However, it is also possible that the transmitter failed to receive any acknowledgments and has retransmitted packet 0. In this latter case, the receiver would accept the wrong packet as packet 8. The solution is for the transmitter to limit wt ‚â§6. With this restriction, the receiver knows that if all acknowledgments were lost, the transmitter would have stopped after packet 5. When it receives packet 6, the receiver can infer that the transmitter received the acknowledgment for packet 0 (the transmitter's na ‚â•1), and thus the following packet numbered 0 must be packet 8. Extensions There are many ways that the protocol can be extended: * The above examples assumed that packets are never reordered in transmission; they may be lost in transit (error detection makes corruption equivalent to loss), but will never appear out of order. The protocol can be extended to support packet reordering, as long as the distance can be bounded; the sequence number modulus N must be expanded by the maximum misordering distance. * It is possible to not acknowledge every packet, as long as an acknowledgment is sent eventually if there is a pause. For example, TCP normally acknowledges every second packet.  It is common to inform the transmitter immediately if a gap in the packet sequence is detected. HDLC has a special REJ (reject) packet for this. * The transmit and receive window sizes may be changed during communication, as long as their sum remains within the limit of N. Normally, they are each assigned maximum values that respect that limit, but the working value at any given time may be less than the maximum. In particular:  It is common to reduce the transmit window size to slow down transmission to match the link's speed, avoiding saturation or congestion.  One common simplification of selective- repeat is so called SREJ-REJ ARQ. This operates with wr=2 and buffers packets following a gap, but only allows a single lost packet; while waiting for that packet, wr=1 and if a second packet is lost, no more packets are buffered. This gives most of the performance benefit of the full selective-repeat protocol, with a simpler implementation.

It was later rebuilt with bricks walls and tile roofed, and today is used as The Community Services Centre\\". The current building was built in 1954 and completed in 1955 and consecrated in 1962, when it was also elevated to the status of cathedral. The building is known for its whitewashed exterior and twin spires at the west front. It also includes stained glass windows from Paris, depicting scenes from the Gospel. The parish has come a long way from its early days, from being a parish of expatriates and Eurasians, and is now a thriving 'Cosmopolitan' parish. Situated in the heart of the Kuala Lumpur, the Cathedral also draws many foreign visitors and diplomats, apart from the regular parishioners, to its Sunday services. St John's Cathedral is located next to St. John's Institution, which is known for its Grecian-Spanish architecture. The school derives its name from St John Baptist De La Salle and was established by the Lasallian Brothers. Due to its location ascending Bukit Nanas, it is also in close proximity to Convent Bukit Nanas, Bukit Nanas Forest Reserve and Kuala Lumpur Tower.

Since the 1976 United States Supreme Court decision in Gregg v. Georgia until Connecticut repealed capital punishment in 2012, Connecticut executed one individual, although the law allowed executions to proceed for those still on death row and convicted under the previous law, but on August 13, 2015, the Connecticut Supreme Court found that applying the death penalty only for past cases was unconstitutional, definitely emptying Connecticut death row. History Between 1639 and 2005, Connecticut performed 126 executions. Twenty-four executions occurred in Connecticut Colony, prior to its statehood. The remaining 102 executions occurred after Connecticut's 1788 admission to the Union as the fifth state. Contrary to popular belief, Adonijah Bailey was not the oldest person executed at age 79 in 1824; instead, he was tried and sentenced to death at age 80 in January 1825 for the murder of Jeremiah W. Pollock, and hanged himself on May 24, over two weeks before he was to be executed. The oldest person executed is Gershon Marx, hanged on May 18, 1905, for murder at age 73. Modern era After Furman v. Georgia, Connecticut reinstated the death penalty on January 10, 1973. Lethal injection became the method mandated to execute condemned prisoners, replacing the electric chair, which had not been used since Taborsky's execution in 1960. Unlike most of the other states, the Governor of Connecticut cannot commute the death sentence imposed under State law or pardon a death row inmate. This is determined by the Board of Clemency, on which the Governor does not sit. The other states where the Board has sole authority are Georgia and Idaho. =Repeal= On May 22, 2009, the Connecticut General Assembly passed a bill that would abolish the death penalty, although it would not retroactively apply to the eleven current Connecticut death row inmates or those convicted of capital crimes committed before the repeal went into effect. The bill was vetoed by Governor Jodi Rell. On April 11, 2012, the Connecticut House of Representatives voted to repeal capital punishment for future cases (leaving past death sentences in place). The Connecticut Senate had already voted for the bill, and on April 25 Governor Dannel Malloy signed the bill into law That made Connecticut the 17th state in the US without a death penalty, and the fifth state to abolish capital punishment in five years. In 2015 the state Supreme Court ruled found that applying the death penalty only for past cases was unconstitutional, definitely emptying Connecticut death row. = Cheshire murder case = One notable death penalty case in Connecticut was the Cheshire home invasion murders. On July 23, 2007, Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her two daughters were raped and murdered, while her husband, Dr. William Petit, was injured during the home invasion.Gardner, David. \\"'Things got out of control': Chilling confession of Connecticut massacre 'killer'.\\" The Daily Mail.

The New York Times. Retrieved August 16, 2015 Capital crimes Murder with special circumstances, also called capital felony, was the only capital crime in Connecticut. These include any of the following: #Murder while the victim was acting within the scope of his duties, a police officer, Division of Criminal Justice inspector, state marshal exercising his statutory authority, judicial marshal performing his duties, constable performing law enforcement duties, special policeman, conservation or special conservation officer appointed by the environmental protection commissioner, Department of Correction (DOC) employee or service provider acting within the scope of his employment in a correctional facility and the perpetrator is an inmate, or firefighter #Murder committed by a defendant who is hired to commit the same for pecuniary gain or murder committed by one who is hired by the defendant to commit the same for pecuniary gain #Murder committed by one who has previously been convicted of intentional murder or of murder committed in the course of commission of a felony #Murder committed by one who was, at the time of commission of the murder, under sentence of life imprisonment #Murder by a kidnapper of a kidnapped person during the course of the kidnapping or before such person is able to return or be returned to safety #Murder committed in the course of the commission of sexual assault in the first degree #Murder of two or more persons at the same time or in the course of a single transaction #Murder of a person under 16 years of age. Executions During the 366 years between 1639 and 2005, Connecticut has performed a total of 126 executions. This averages to be approximately one execution every three years. The only person to be executed since 1960 has been the serial killer and rapist Michael Bruce Ross on May 13, 2005, for the kidnapping, rapes and murders of Robin Stavinsky, April Brunais, Wendy Baribeault, and Leslie Shelley. Until the 2005 Roper v. Simmons decision, juveniles over the age of 16 could be sentenced to death because state law only required that the offender be tried in adult court to face the death penalty. =Notable executions= Several notable executions have occurred in both Connecticut Colony and in the state of Connecticut, as indicated below. * Gerald Chapman ‚Äî Chapman, a Prohibition-era gangster known as \\"The Count of Gramercy Park\\", was the first criminal to be dubbed \\"Public Enemy Number One\\" by the press. Convicted of the October 12, 1924 murder of police officer James Skelly in New Britain, Chapman was hanged by upright jerker on April 6, 1926 at the state prison in Wethersfield. * Serial killer Michael Bruce Ross ‚Äî The execution of Ross in 2005 was the first and last in Connecticut (and in all of New England) since 1960. It was also the only execution administered by lethal injection in Connecticut and New England. Ross was convicted of murdering eight girls and women between 1981 and 1984 and raping seven of them. Death row The male death row was located at the Northern Correctional Institution. In 1995 the male death row moved from Osborn Correctional Institution to Northern. The execution chamber was located at Osborn. The York Correctional Institution housed all female prisoners in the state, but no women were on death row.

It features programming from Fox Sports Radio. WHTK carries New York Yankees broadcasts, shares rights to the Rochester Red Wings with WYSL (with WYSL carrying afternoon games and WHTK carrying night games), among other local and national sports. The station's weekday lineup includes Dan Patrick, The Rich Eisen Show, and Carl Falk. On weekends, the station carries a variety of sports programming including the Canandaigua National Bank High School Sports Show (section V athletics), The Pain Clinic (pro wrestling), Kick This! (soccer), What's Going On (current events and issues) and more. History logo through 2008 In 2008, the station re-branded itself as \\"Sportsradio 1280\\". Prior to the change, WHTK had been known as \\"Hot Talk 1280\\". As of 2014, the station is now known as \\"FOX Sports 1280 Rochester\\". Prior to that, the station was first known as WVET, signing on in 1947, under ownership of a group of returning World War II veterans calling themselves Veterans' Broadcasting Company. It operated successfully for many years with a personality full service adult popular music format. It changed call sign from WVET to WROC when Veterans bought WROC-TV from Transcontinent Television Corporation in 1961. Simultaneously, an FM sister station, WROC-FM, signed on, first playing classical music and later automated jazz and pop standards. Veterans sold the WROC radio stations in 1964 to Rust Craft Broadcasting, who would then sell the stations to Associated Broadcasters (which later became Pyramid Broadcasting) in 1979. The AM station continued with its full service format until late in the 1970s, when it tried an all-news format first as WROC and then as WPXN. It would later change calls letters to WPXY and aired the satellite-fed \\"Music of Your Life\\" adult standards format before dropping that in January 1984 for a simulcast with its FM sister station, by the early 1980s known as WPXY-FM and airing the contemporary hit music format, which WPXY-FM still runs today. In 1990, the AM split from the simulcast and returned to Music of Your Life. In 1991, WPXY (AM) changed to oldies as WKQG,http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- Billboard/90s/1991/BB-1991-03-02.pdf then back to a simulcast with the FM (again as WPXY), and then, on November 1, 1993, after The Lincoln Group began to operate the station from Pyramid (who kept the FM), flipped to mostly syndicated \\"hot talk\\", a lineup of talk and sports programming meant to appeal to young adult men.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1993/RR-1993-10-29.pdf At that time, it adopted the WHTK call sign (the \\"HTK\\" meant to stand for \\"hot talk\\") which it still uses today. Over the next few years, the station would add more sports-oriented programming. In 1996, WHTK would be split from WPXY-FM permanently when the station was sold to Jacor (after several subsequent mergers, Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) would acquire the station in 2000). On September 9, 2009, at midnight, WROO changed their call letters to WHTK-FM and changed their format from country music, as \\"Country 107.3\\" to sports, simulcasting WHTK 1280 AM, as \\"1280 WHTK & FM 107.3\\", and is known as \\"Rochester's Sports Talk.\\"Clear Channel's latest flip to its oft-changing rimshot signal on 107.3 took place at midnight on Sept. 9, Scott Fybush/North East Radio Watch, September 14, 2009. The change was made to address nighttime signal limitations of WHTK (AM), which must protect co-channel signals in New York City and the midwestern US by directionalizing after sunset. The FM station filled in signal nulls which limited WHTK's nighttime and early morning reach in southeastern Monroe County, southern Wayne County and Ontario County. The FM simulcast ended on May 5, 2012. WHTK was the longtime radio home of the Rochester Americans of the American Hockey League. The Americans jumped to WROC in 2016 as a result of a five-year deal between Pegula Sports and Entertainment (the Americans' owners) and Entercom.

He is Chairman of BrandsEye, a leading South African opinion mining company currently in the process of moving to London. His former roles include Executive Chairman of the ATP Tour, president at Walt Disney Television International, chairman of BBC Worldwide, chairman of Virgin Racing F1 team, board member of Kirch/SLEC and ITV, director of Saracens rugby club and CEO of Satbel. Early life and career De Villiers was born and raised in Pretoria, South Africa, the son of South African cardiologist Marquard De Villiers. He has 3 sisters and a brother, record producer Paul, responsible for the triple platinum Mr. Mister album Welcome to the Real World. After graduating with a Civil Engineering degree from the University of Pretoria, DeVilliers received a Rhodes scholarship and read PPE at Oxford University. Following stints in engineering roles, in 1979 he joined management consultancy firm McKinsey & Company, where he was influenced by colleagues Tom Peters and Robert Waterman, authors of In Search of Excellence. In 1984 De Villiers was hired by Sol Kerzner to become CEO of Satbel, the South African entertainment conglomerate and operator of South Africa's largest cinema chain, Ster-Kinekor. Satbel and racial de-segregation in South Africa As CEO of Satbel, De Villiers was instrumental in ending racial segregation in South African cinema theatres. Describing his dealings with former South African president F. W. De Klerk, the then-Minister of Internal Affairs, de Villiers said: \\"We bluffed each other that it would be catastrophic if we didn't do the right thing. De Klerk bluffed the government and I bluffed the entertainment industry and together we managed to pull it off.\\" Indian Premier League In 2009 De Villiers was asked by his former business partner Lalit Modi to assume ultimate responsibility for promoting the 2009 Indian Premier League in its last-minute switch to South Africa. The IPL was moved less than a month before opening ceremonies were due to begin, following terrorist attacks in India. At the time Modi was quoted as saying: \\"It's taken South Africa eight years to get ready for the 2010 soccer World Cup. We've had 29 days\\". Moving host nations is reported to have required the short-notice booking of 59 matches in 8 South African stadia, as well as 10,000 air tickets and 30,000 hotel rooms. De Villiers asked Fran√ßois Pienaar to lend his support. The endorsement of the talismanic South African 1995 Rugby World Cup captain is credited with sparking interest in the IPL among South African fans, many of whom had never heard of the visiting Indian city-teams. The Times of India reported that the South African IPL tour did much to boost racial integration and presented South Africa as the perfect sporting destination. Citing the IPL's positive reviews, the Times called the South African tour \\"a successful experiment in atypical globalization‚Ä¶where the West has to look to the East\\". Tenure at the ATP In September 2005 De Villiers was appointed Chairman of the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), the governing body of the men's professional tennis circuit. De Villiers was given a brief to modernise men's tennis, a sport that many commentators believed to have grown stagnant and balkanized. While some in the sport took against his reforms, De Villiers' tenure is now viewed more favourably. De Villiers is credited by the Financial Times newspaper with making the sport easier to follow and more entertaining for fans, doubling prize money for players and attracting $1bn of new investment. De Villiers was behind the decision to host the ATP World Tour Finals at the O2 Arena. With its more dramatic and theatrical presentation, the O2 event was marketed as a clean break from traditional UK tennis, although both the All England Club and the Lawn Tennis Association helped to publicise it. The inaugural event overcame initial scepticism to register a total attendance of more than 250,000; the venue has hosted all ATP World tour finals to date. De Villiers fulfilled his three-year contract with the ATP in December 2008. =Controversies= De Villiers' reform of the ATP essentially involved players giving up a degree of autonomy in return for higher potential earnings, and persuading promoters and agents to endorse a more TV-friendly tournament format, sometime at the expense of individual interest groups within the sport. Some of De Villiers' decisions were publicly contested by players and promoters, notably Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Inside Tennis magazine reported the position between De Villiers and players thus: :\\"The problem for de Villiers is the ATP is a union of multi-millionaire 19-25-year-old kids and they don‚Äôt want to take orders from a former Disney executive.\\" In March 2008, 20 ATP players signed a letter to the ATP Board of Directors to the effect that De Villiers' contract should not be renewed until other candidates were interviewed for the position. Other players were more approving. In a 2007 Inside Tennis interview, doubles player Mike Bryan said of De Villiers: ‚Äú‚Ä¶[he] might make a couple of bad calls, but in general the guy‚Äôs a genius\\". The ATP experienced external controversies during De Villiers tenure, most notably an antitrust lawsuit brought by the German Tennis Federation. The lawsuit challenged the ATP's right to downgrade Hamburg's status on the Masters Series, a decision that also reduced the earnings of some clay-court players. Hamburg's case was unanimously rejected by the US jury, but legal victory came at a considerable financial expense to the ATP. Separately, in 2007 several players reported being approached by illegal gambling rings offering money to fix matches. The ATP's subsequent investigation found some players had gambled in contravention of the ATP's rules. Although none had bet on their own matches, five players were fined and suspended. The much-publicised Davydenko-Arg√ºello match in Sopot, where Betfair suspended betting after a series of highly unusual bets, prompted a rethink in the sport. De Villiers initiated an independent review to investigate whether corruption was systemic within the game. The report called for the establishment of a tennis-wide anti corruption unit, a recommendation that led to the Tennis Integrity Unit, a joint initiative by the ATP, ITF, WTA and the Grand Slam committee. In a 2007 interview with the New York Times, De Villiers said: ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt possibly stop our athletes being approached [by illegal gambling rings]. We can‚Äôt have all of our 700 or 800 athletes with bodyguards, but what we can do is educate them on their responsibilities when they are approached and the consequences of not behaving appropriately.‚Äù A New York Times profile of De Villiers and ATP described him as \\"...quotable and irreverent\\". BBC Worldwide De Villiers was Chairman of the BBC's commercial holdings board, including BBC Worldwide, from 2005 to 2009. In de Villiers' last year as Chairman the organisation announced revenues exceeding ¬£1 billion for 2008/2009. In 2007/08, BBC Worldwide reported profits of ¬£120m, up three-fold on 2004/05, with much of the increase coming from international expansion and new businesses. Disney In 1986 de Villiers joined the Walt Disney company, where he managed Disney's television activities worldwide. He went on to become head of Disney in Europe, including its theme parks, stores and home entertainment, with the international TV business growing from $15m to $1bn during his tenure, and from six employees to 700. Virgin Racing In October 2009 deVilliers was appointed Chairman of the Virgin Racing F1 team. He resigned upon the team's sale to Marussia in December 2011. Private equity De Villiers cofounded private equity vehicle Englefield Capital, whose main investor was the Dutch Brenninkmeijer family. Englefield raised its debut fund of ‚Ç¨730m in May 2003. De Villiers is a former non-exec director of Pi Capital, an investment network for high-net-worth business leaders. BrandsEye De Villiers is the current Chairman of BrandsEye, an opinion- mining technology firm. He is also an investor in the firm.

Career Rotherham United made several attempts to sign Ronnie Burke during the World War II years, but Manchester United got his signature. He made his debut for United against Sunderland on the 26 October 1946. Despite a great goals per game ratio (34 appearances and 22 goals) he was called upon infrequently due to the consistently good form of Morris, Rowley and Pearson. Frustrated by lack of first team opportunities and following a number of transfer requests he was allowed to leave. He then moved to Huddersfield Town, but suffered a serious knee injury, and lost his place in the Terriers team. =Rotherham= He made his debut for Rotherham in Division 2 (now Championship), scoring two goals in a 4‚Äì3 defeat at Nottingham Forest on Good Friday 1953, and was unlucky not to get a hat-trick in his first Millers appearance. In the next season he scored a hat-trick in the Millers 5‚Äì2 victory over Derby County on 5 December 1953, and repeated his achievement in a 7-0 thrashing of Oldham Athletic in March 1954. He finished the 1953/54 season with 33 goals, and was second highest goalscorer in Division 2. In the 1954/55 season he scored all four Millers goals in a 4‚Äì2 victory against Bury in September 1954, but his knee injury problems flared up again and he was made available for transfer in summer 1955. =Later clubs= He then moved to Exeter City.

He introduced the phrase \\"presumed innocent until proven guilty\\", insisting that defendants' accusers and their evidence be thoroughly tested in court. Born to a priest and his wife in Monken Hadley, then in Middlesex, Garrow was educated at his father's school in the village before being apprenticed to Thomas Southouse, an attorney in Cheapside, which preceded a pupillage with Mr. Crompton, a special pleader. A dedicated student of the law, Garrow frequently observed cases at the Old Bailey; as a result Crompton recommended that he become a solicitor or barrister. Garrow joined Lincoln's Inn in November 1778, and was called to the Bar on 27 November 1783. He quickly established himself as a criminal defence counsel, and in February 1793 was made a King's Counsel by HM Government to prosecute cases involving treason and felonies. He was elected to Parliament in 1805 for Gatton, a rotten borough, and became Solicitor General for England and Wales in 1812 and Attorney General for England and Wales a year later. Although not happy in Parliament, having been returned only for political purposes, Garrow acted as one of the principal Whig spokesmen trying to stop criminal law reform as campaigned for by Samuel Romilly and also attempted to pass legislation to condemn animal cruelty. In 1817, he was made a Baron of the Exchequer and a Serjeant-at-Law, forcing his resignation from Parliament, and he spent the next 15 years as a judge. He was not particularly successful in the commercial cases the Exchequer specialised in, but when on Assize, used his criminal law knowledge from his years at the Bar to great effect. On his resignation in 1832 he was made a Privy Councillor, a sign of the respect HM Government had for him. He died on 24 September 1840. For much of the 19th and 20th centuries his work was forgotten by academics, and interest arose only in 1991, with an article by John Beattie titled \\"Garrow for the Defence\\" in History Today. Garrow is best known for his criminal defence work, which, through the example he set with his aggressive defence of clients, helped establish the modern adversarial system in use in the United Kingdom, the United States, and other former British colonies. Garrow is also known for his impact on the rules of evidence, leading to the best evidence rule. His work was cited as recently as 1982 in the Supreme Court of Canada and 2006 in the Irish Court of Criminal Appeal. In 2009, BBC One broadcast Garrow's Law, a four-part fictionalised drama of Garrow's beginnings at the Old Bailey; a second series aired in late 2010. BBC One began broadcasting the third series in November 2011. Early life and education alt=a pair of very old, red and white brick buildings. The one on the left is larger than that on the right and has a small tower. The buildings feature large stained glass windows on the front. Garrow's family originally came from Moray Scotland, where they were descended from the Garriochs of Kinstair, a Scottish royal line. Garrow's father David was born at a farm called Knockside, Aberlour (Speyside) approximately 50 miles northwest of Aberdeen.Braby (2010), p. 17. David graduated from Aberdeen University with a Master of Arts degree on 1 April 1736, and became a priest of the Church of England, creating a school in Monken Hadley. His younger brother William became a successful doctor, leaving most of his estate (¬£30,000) to Garrow. On 5 June 1748 David married Sarah Lowndes, with whom he had eleven children; William, Edward, Eleanora, Jane, John, Rose, William, Joseph, William, David and Anne. The first two Williams died as infants; the third, born on 13 April 1760, survived.Braby (2010), p. 22. William Garrow was educated at his father's school in Monken Hadley, The Priory,May (2003), p. 40. which emphasised preparing students for commercial careers such as in the East India Company. As such, it taught social graces, as well as English, Greek, Latin, French, geography, mathematics and dancing. Studying there Garrow \\"knew the English language well; had a moderate acquaintance with the Latin and, as an accomplishment, added a considerable proficiency in French\\".Hostettler (2006) p.61. Garrow attended this school until he was 15, at which point he was articled to Thomas Southouse born Faversham, Kent?, an attorney in Cheapside. Garrow showed potential, being noted as \\"attentive and diligent in the performance of the technical and practical duties of the office\\",Richards (1832), p. 253. and Southouse recommended that he become a solicitor or barrister; as a result, when he was 17, he became a pupil of a Mr. Crompton, a special pleader. As a pupil Garrow studied hard, fastidiously reading Sampson Euer's Doctrina Placitandi, a manual on the Law of Pleading written in legal French.Braby (2010), p. 25. At the same time he viewed cases at the Old Bailey, forming a friendship with the clerk of arraignment there, William Shelton.Braby (2010), p. 26. In the 18th century, speakers perfected the art of oratory through debating societies, one of the most noted of which met at Coachmaker's Hall, London. Although initially shy (during his first debate, the attendees had to force him from his seat and hold him up while he spoke), he swiftly developed a reputation as a speaker, and was referred to in the press as \\"Counsellor Garrow, the famous orator of Coachmaker's Hall\\".Braby (2010), p. 27. In November 1778, Garrow became a member of Lincoln's Inn, one of the four Inns of Court, and on 27 November 1783 at the age of 23 he was called to the Bar;Braby (2010), p. 24. he later became a Bencher of Lincoln's Inn in 1793.Braby (2010), p. 215. Career as a barrister =Defence= alt=a painting of a large, pillared white room filled with people in the middle of a court case. The view is from the side; an advocate can be seen in a box on the right, while on the left are a panel of judges sitting in front of a curved desk. Garrow started as a criminal defence barrister at the Old Bailey, in a time where many defendants became increasingly reliant on barristers to prevent their conviction.Braby (2010), p. 47. His first case was actually as a prosecutor; on 14 January 1784, barely two months after he was called to the Bar, he prosecuted John Henry Aikles for obtaining a bill of exchange under false pretences.Braby (2010), p. 48. It was alleged that Aikles had promised to pay Samuel Edwards ¬£100 and a small commission for a ¬£100 bill of exchange, and when he took the bill, failed to hand over the money. Despite Aikles's counsel claiming, according to Edward Foss, that \\"this was no felony\\", and being represented by two of the most prestigious criminal barristers of the day, Garrow convinced both the judge and the jury that Aikles was guilty.Braby (2010), p. 49. Garrow later defended Aikles in September 1785, securing his release due to ill-health.Braby (2010), p. 50. During his early years as a practising barrister, Garrow was particularly noted for his aggressive and confrontational style of cross-examination. When James Wingrove was charged with theft and violence in the course of a highway robbery in 1784, Garrow's cross-examination of William Grove (who acted as a witness and the person charging Wingrove) got him to admit that he was perjuring himself in an attempt to get a reward, and that Wingrove had not robbed the two injured parties.Braby (2010), p. 51. Garrow showed a dislike of most thief-takers, of which Grove was one, although he did not treat the Bow Street Runners and other professionals with contempt. His dislike of such men was highlighted in his defence of three men in 1788 for theft; they were charged with assaulting John Troughton, putting him in fear of his life, and stealing his hat. The issue was whether the assault put him in fear of his life, or whether he was exaggerating to claim a reward, which could not be claimed for simple theft.Braby (2010), p. 54. Garrow established that Troughton was uncertain about how he lost his hat, despite his attempts to claim that the defendants knocked it off him, and after four witnesses gave character evidence the defendants were found not guilty.Braby (2010), p. 55. Garrow made much use of jury nullification to limit the punishment for his convicted clients, in a time when many crimes carried the death penalty (the so-called Bloody Code). In 1784 a pair of women were arrested for stealing fans worth 15 shillings, meaning a conviction would result in the death penalty; Garrow convinced the jury to convict the women of stealing 4 shillings worth of fans, therefore changing the sentence to twelve months of hard labour.Braby (2010), p. 60. =Prosecution= Thomas Erskine, whom Garrow faced in the treason trials of the late 18th century.alt=a portrait of a young man with dark hair and dark eyes. He is wearing a black jacket with some form of medal or badge pinned to the front, along with a raised collar and a small cravat. Garrow soon developed a large practice, working criminal trials at the Old Bailey and outside London as both defence counsel and prosecutor. By 1799, a book recorded that the number of cases he had at the Court of King's Bench \\"is exceeded by none but Mr. [Thomas] Erskine's\\", and that \\"he has long monopolized the chief business on the home circuit... No man is heard with more attention by the court, no man gains more upon a jury, or better pleases a common auditor\\".Braby (2010), p. 79. In February 1793 he was appointed a King's Counsel to help prosecute those accused of treason and sedition, less than ten years after his call to the Bar;Richards (1832), p. 254. and his appointment was met with a mixed response from the media. The Briton described Garrow and the other five appointments as the best talent of the age, while the Morning Chronicle was bitter due to Garrow's previous status as a friend of the Official Opposition, the Whigs, as opposed to the Tory government.Braby (2010), p. 80. As the French Revolution and its perceived threat to the United Kingdom gained momentum, so did Garrow's career; he prosecuted in most of the state trials, and as he increased in experience was left to manage many of them himself, coming up against leading barristers such as Thomas Erskine, James Mingay and James Scarlett. In May 1794 the Government suspended habeas corpus, in 1795 outlawed all public meetings, in 1797 outlawed secret organisations and in 1799 outlawed all societies interested in reforming the way the United Kingdom was run. The Government planned a series of 800 arrests, with 300 execution warrants for high treason made out and signed, making a particular effort to prosecute Thomas Hardy and John Horne Tooke.Braby (2010), p. 81. Hardy was the first to be tried, with the prosecution arguing that he sought a revolution in England similar to that in France. With Garrow prosecuting and Erskine defending, the trial lasted eight days instead of the normal one, and the foreman of the jury was so tense that he delivered the verdict of \\"not guilty\\" in a whisper and then immediately fainted.Braby (2010), p. 82. Tooke was then prosecuted; again, the jury found him not guilty, with the result that the other 800 trials were abandoned.Braby (2010), p. 83. During the period when Garrow worked as a barrister, the sugar planters of the West Indies held large amounts of power in Parliament, allowing them to maintain a monopoly on the marketing of sugar in England that brought great profits. This industry was largely profitable due to the use of slave labour, to which Garrow had long been opposed; when the sugar planters offered him a job managing all of their legal and political business, he replied that \\"if your committee would give me their whole incomes, and all their estates, I would not be seen as the advocate of practices which I abhor, and a system which I detest\\".Braby (2010), p. 85. In 1806 Thomas Picton, the Governor of Trinidad, was charged with a single count of \\"causing torture to be unlawfully inflicted\\" on a young free mulatto girl; he was brought before the Court of King's Bench under Lord Ellenborough. The court records run to 367 pages, and Garrow was deeply involved as prosecuting counsel; indeed, his opening speech on 24 February 1806 is considered by Braby to be one of his best. The case centred on whether or not Spanish law, which allowed torture, was still in effect at the time of the incident. The jury eventually decided that it was not, and Ellenborough found Picton guilty. Picton's counsel requested a retrial, which was granted; the jury in the second trial eventually decided that Picton was innocent.Braby (2010), p. 90. Thanks to Garrow's political connections, he was made first Solicitor General and then Attorney General for the Prince of Wales in 1806 and 1807; he was recommended by Erskine, who said in a letter to the Prince that \\"he knows more of the real justice and policy of everything connected with the criminal law than any man I am acquainted with\\". In 1812 he prosecuted Leigh Hunt for seditious libel against the Prince Regent; thanks to his work, Hunt was found guilty, reversing the judgment of an 1811 trial in which he had been acquitted.Braby (2010), p. 113. Political career alt=an older gentleman with short, greying hair, although his eyebrows remain black. He is wearing a black jacket with a small white cravat, and is sat in front of some dark red paper or cloth. Since 1789, the press had been speculating that Garrow, a Whig, would enter Parliament; however he was first elected in 1805 for Gatton. This was a rotten borough, with Garrow appointed to serve the interests of his patron. After his entry into politics Garrow at first paid little attention, not making his maiden speech until 22 April 1806, when he opposed a charge for the impeachment of Marquess Wellesley. He spoke again on 18 June 1806 on a legal technicality, and after that did not intervene for another six years. Braby and other sources indicate that he did not enjoy his time in Parliament, and was rarely there unless required to conduct some business.Braby (2010), p. 94. In June 1812, he was appointed Solicitor General for England and Wales, receiving the customary knighthood,Richards (1832) p.255. and, in May 1813, he was appointed Attorney General. The Attorney General was the senior Crown prosecutor, during a time when the Prince Regent feared liberal changes to the criminal law and Parliamentary structure. Garrow, as \\"a mere creature of the Regent\\", could be trusted to oppose this; rather than the progressive, defensive work undertaken in his early career, this period was one of conservative aggression against the reformers.Braby (2010), p. 95. Garrow ran particularly foul of Sir Samuel Romilly, who was one of those looking to reform a penal code many claimed was not working. On 5 April 1813, Romilly's Bill on Attainder of Treason and Felony came before Parliament. Its intent was to remove corruption of the blood from cases involving treason and felony; Garrow, then Solicitor General, declared that the Bill would remove one of the safeguards of the British Constitution. The Bill eventually failed, and corruption of the blood was not removed from English law until the Forfeiture Act 1870.Braby (2010), p. 100. He also served as Chief Justice of Chester from 1814 to 1817. Garrow also became involved in the repeal of the Corn Laws, voting for the measure, and sponsored legislation to control surgical practice in the United Kingdom; the bill did not, however, pass into law.Braby (2010), p. 102. In the early 19th century animal cruelty was widespread; Garrow was one of those who found it appalling, and sponsored a bill in 1816 to increase the penalties for riding horses until their severe injury or death. While defeated, his actions were vindicated by a bill of 1820 introduced by Thomas Erskine, which was given the Royal Assent and came into law.Braby (2010), p. 103. Garrow eventually resigned as Attorney General and as a member of parliament in 1817, when he was appointed one of the Barons of the Exchequer.Braby (2010), p. 110. Judicial career Garrow's first judicial appointment came in 1814, when he was made Chief Justice of Chester. This was opposed by Sir Samuel Romilly, who argued that the positions of Chief Justice and Attorney General were incompatible, saying \\"to appoint a gentleman holding a lucrative office at the sole pleasure of the Crown to a high judicial situation, was extremely inconsistent with that independence of the judicial character which it was so important to preserve inviolate\\".Braby (2010), p. 101. On 6 May 1817, Garrow was made a Baron of the Exchequer and Serjeant-at-Law, succeeding Richard Richards,Foss (1865), p. 82. and resigning his seat in Parliament and his position as Attorney General. He was not a particularly distinguished judge in the Exchequer, mainly due to a lack of knowledge of the finer points of law.Braby (2010), p. 125. Practising on the Assize Circuits, however, was a different matter; dealing with his more familiar criminal law rather than the commercial law of the Exchequer, Garrow performed far better. Braby indicates that he regularly amazed both barristers and defendants with his knowledge of the intricacies of crime.Braby (2010), p. 135. Garrow retired on 22 February 1832, replaced by John Gurney,Foss (1865), p. 86. and was made a Privy Councillor on retirement as a measure of the Government's respect for him.Gentleman's Magazine (1840), p. 657. He died at home on 14 September 1840, aged 80.Braby (2010), p. 218. Personal life Sarah Garrow Garrow had an irregular relationship with Sarah Dore, who had previously borne a son, William Arthur Dore Hill, by Arthur Hill, Viscount Fairford in 1778. Garrow Society web-site . Thomas Hague has suggested that Dore was an Irish noblewoman Garrow had seduced, but the only intent of his writings was to disparage Garrow, and there is no evidence to support his claim.Hostettler (2006) p.60. Their first child, David William Garrow, was born on 15 April 1781, and their second, Eliza Sophia Garrow, was born on 18 June 1784. Garrow and Dore finally married on 17 March 1793.Braby (2010), p. 152. Dore was noted as particularly elegant, and was actively involved in local matters in Ramsgate, where the family lived.Braby (2010), p. 153. Dore died on 30 June 1808 after a long illness,Foss (1870), p. 290. and was buried at the Church of St Margaret, Darenth.Braby (2010), p. 154. David William Garrow was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, earning the degree of Doctor of Divinity, and served as one of the Chaplains to the Prince of Wales.Braby (2010), p. 170. His son, Edward Garrow, was a cricketer and clergyman. Eliza Sophia Garrow married Samuel Fothergill Lettsom; one of her children, also named William Garrow, served as the Consul-General of Uruguay.Braby (2010), p. 177. Legacy Garrow's estate was valued at ¬£22,000 after his death near Ramsgate, Kent, including ¬£12,000 in the Bank of England, ¬£5,000 in three insurance policies and ¬£5,000 secured by mortgages ‚Äì a total of ¬£ in terms. Garrow's will was written in 1830 and contained only two demands; to set up a trust and to be buried in his birthplace, Hadley, with his uncle, his father's younger brother William (who had left Garrow the best part of his fortune). The trust contained his entire estate, with the trustees being Leonard Smith, a merchant, Edward Lowth Badeley of Paper Buildings, Inner Temple and William Nanson Lettsom of Gray's Inn.Braby (2010), p. 158. The money was divided between Joseph Garrow, Garrow's nephew, who received ¬£1,000, ¬£200 to each of the children of Garrow's sister, ¬£2,000 to the sister and ¬£300 a year to the widow of Garrow's son. Eliza, Garrow's daughter, received ¬£300 a year from the interest on the trust, with an additional provision of ¬£200 for the joint use of Eliza and her husband. The estate was structured by a legal professional, and as such no death duties were paid.Braby (2010), p. 160. The second instruction was ignored: Garrow was buried in the churchyard of St Laurence, Ramsgate, his parish church.Braby; Hostettler (2010), pp. 23; 207; 218. Edward Foss described him as \\"one of the most successful advocates of his day\\",Foss (1870), p. 289. something linked more to his \\"extraordinary talent\\" at cross- examination than his knowledge of the law;May (2003), p. 41. Garrow once told a witness before a case that \\"you know a particular fact and wish to conceal it ‚Äì I'll get it out of you!\\"Polson (1840) p. 180. Lord Brougham, who regularly opposed him in court, wrote that \\"no description can give the reader an adequate idea of this eminent practitioner's powers in thus dealing with a witness\\".May (2003), p. 42. Lemmings notes Garrow as not only a formidable advocate but also the \\"first lawyer to establish a reputation as a defence barrister\\".Lemmings (2004), p. 723. Garrow was largely forgotten; although Robert Louis Stevenson and his wife discovered his work a generation later when reading transcripts of Old Bailey cases, there was little academic work on him until the late 20th century. In 1991, John Beattie published \\"Garrow for the Defence\\" in History Today, followed by \\"Scales of Justice: Defence Counsel and the English Criminal Law in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries\\" in Law and History Review. Allyson May, who did her doctoral study under Beattie, further extended the analysis of Garrow's work with The Bar and the Old Bailey: 1750‚Äì1850, published in 2003.Braby (2010), p. ix. Garrow's work was cited in court as recently as 1982, when the Supreme Court of Canada quoted a passage from The Trial of William Davidson and Richard Tidd for High Treason, where Garrow instructed the jury as to how to interpret testimony, in Vetrovec v The Queen in 1982. In 2006 he was again quoted, when the Irish Court of Criminal Appeal used the same work in their review of the 1982 conviction of Brian Meehan for the murder of Veronica Guerin.Braby (2010), p. 136. In 2009, BBC One broadcast Garrow's Law, a four-part fictionalised drama of Garrow's beginnings at the Old Bailey, starring Andrew Buchan as Garrow. A second series, again of four parts, was aired in late 2010, and the third and final four-part series was broadcast in November and December 2011. Impact =Adversarial system= It is indisputable that Garrow massively affected the modern, adversarial court system used in several western nations and the rules of evidence, although he was barely aware of it. Prior to Garrow's time, defendants in felony cases were not allowed to have defence counsel; as a result, every defendant for arson, rape, robbery, murder and most forms of theft was forced to defend themselves.Braby (2010), p. 28. The first step away from this was with the Treason Act 1695 (for regulating trials in cases of treason), which allowed treason defendants the right to a counsel. Garrow's practice was a further step forward; with his aggressive and forthright style of cross-examination, he promoted a more committed defence of clients, and indirectly reformed the process of advocacy in the 18th century.Braby (2010), p. 36. His area of advocacy (he was counsel for the defence in 83% of his cases) and style is considered key by Beattie in establishing the \\"new school\\" of advocacy;Beattie (1991), p. 238. his aggressive style in defence set a new style for advocates to follow that assisted in counteracting a legal system biased against the defendant. While he was not the sole cause of this reform, his position at the head of the Bar meant that he served as a highly visible example for new barristers to take after.Beattie (1991), p. 239. In some ways Garrow was far ahead of his time; he coined the phrase \\"innocent until proven guilty\\" in 1791,Moore (1997), p. 37. although the jury refused to accept this principle and it was not confirmed by the courts until much later.Hostettler (2008), p. 227. =Evidence= Garrow also influenced the rules of evidence, which were only just beginning to evolve when he started his career. His insistence that hearsay and copied documents could not be admitted in evidence led to the best evidence rule.Hostettler (2008) pp. 116‚Äì7Braby (2010), p. 32. He was crucial in insisting on the autonomy of lawyers when inducting evidence, in one case openly arguing with the trial judge to insist that the advocates have independence in submitting it.Langbein (1996), p. 1200. During this period, the use of partisan medical experts was particularly problematic. While medical experts were regularly called at the Old Bailey,Landsman (1998), p. 448. the use of partisan experts was resisted, and at the beginning experts were given limited authority.Landsman (1998), p. 449. While this increased towards the end of the 17th century, in line with the judges' increasing desire for certainty and facts,Landsman (1998), p. 447. Garrow is noted as an excellent example of the attitude lawyers took when cross-examining such witnesses. When defending Robert Clark, accused of killing John Delew by kicking him in the stomach, Garrow used a mixture of aggressive cross- examination and medical knowledge to get the prosecution's medical expert to admit that he could not prove how Delew had died.Landsman (1998), p. 478. Garrow and later advocates learned how to effectively \\"interrogate\\" such witnesses, strengthening their own arguments (when it was their expert) or demolishing those of others (when it was an expert attached to the other side).Landsman (1998), p. 499.

Retrieved 5 April 2008. Designed for Mitsubishi by the British aircraft designer Herbert Smith, the 2MR was used by the Imperial Japanese Navy through the 1920s and 1930s. Development and design In 1921, the Imperial Japanese Navy placed an order with the newly established aircraft subsidiary of Mitsubishi for three types of carrier-based aircraft, consisting of a fighter, reconnaissance aircraft and torpedo bomber. Mitsubishi hired a team of British engineers led by Herbert Smith, formerly of Sopwith Aviation Company to design these aircraft. Smith's design for a reconnaissance aircraft, designated by Mitsubishi the 2MR, first flew on 12 January 1922. The 2MR was of similar layout to the contemporary 1MF fighter (i.e. a single-bay wooden biplane), but scaled up to accommodate a two-man crew, and was powered by a similar license-built Hispano-Suiza engine. After successful testing, the 2MR was adopted by the Japanese Navy as the Navy Type 10 Carrier Reconnaissance Aircraft (Type 10 referring to the year of ordering of 1921, the tenth year of the Taish≈ç period), with production continuing until 1930, a total of 159 being built. In 1930, Mitsubishi developed two aircraft to meet an Imperial Japanese Army Air Force requirement for a short-range reconnaissance aircraft, the 2MR7, a biplane developed from the 2MR and the B2M torpedo bomber and the 2MR8 parasol monoplane, with the 2MR8 being successful and ordered into service as the Type 92 Reconnaissance Aircraft. This aircraft was unrelated to the Navy 2MR aircraft. Operational history The biplane series of the 2MR continued in service aboard Japan's aircraft carriers through the 1920s and into the 1930s, with versions being used as intermediate trainers until the late-1930s. Many were converted to civil use, being used both as trainers and for communications purposes for newspaper companies. Some remained in civilian service until 1938.

Riddle sent the horse into training with Gwyn Tompkins, Racing career As a two-year-old American Flag's most important performance was a win in the Manor Stakes at Laurel Park Racecourse in Laurel, Maryland. Undefeated at age three, he had important wins in the Withers and Dwyer Stakes plus he captured what became known as the third leg of the U.S. Triple Crown series, the Belmont Stakes. His 1925 performances earned him Champion Three- Year-Old colt honors. Following the retirement of Gwyn Tompkins, American Flag was sent back to the track at age four under trainer George Conway. In the 1926 Suburban Handicap American Flag ran second to stablemate Crusader, who was another son of Man o' War. Retirement and stud record Retired to his owner's Faraway Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, as a stallion, American Flag met with modest success. His most notable offspring was the colt Gusto who won the American Derby, Arlington Classic Stakes and the Jockey Club Gold Cup, and through his mating to the mare Nellie Morse, the filly Nellie Flag who was the 1934 U.S. Champion Two-Year-Old Filly and who became a significant broodmare for Calumet Farm.

It is the product of the evolution and growth of the first trail designated in Connecticut's Blue-Blazed Hiking Trail system, with its light- blue rectangular vertical painted blazes .Connecticut Walk Book, 19th edition, vol.2 (West), Ann T. Colson, ed., Connecticut Forest and Park Association, (c) 2006, p. 221. The Route From its southeastern trailhead (at ), its easternmost leg runs northward, paralleling the west bank of the Quinnipiac River and the east side of the Wilbur Cross Parkway through the entire length of the (undeveloped) Quinnipiac River State Park in North Haven. Turning mostly westward, away from the river, at the Toelles Rd. bridge at Hartford Turnpike in North Haven, the Quinnipiac Trail traverses virtually the length of the Sleeping Giant State Park (5.1 miles east/west). Just northwest of the \\"chest\\", an eight-mile (13 km) spur of the trail leads NNW, exiting the Park, crossing the Cheshire town line, continues north past Route 42, and after a steep hike overlooking the dramatic chasms of Roaring Brook Falls near the Prospect border, ends near Connecticut Route 68 on Chatfield Road. Views Within Hamden's Sleeping Giant park, the trail‚Äîdesignated as the \\"Blue Trail\\" among the park's system of trails with variously colored rectangular blazes, and variously shaped red ones, passes such dramatic overlooks as Hezekiah's Knob (680 feet, at 41¬∞26'3.00\\"N 72¬∞52'25.89\\"W) and the stone Tower (739 feet at its ground floor). The giant's \\"chin\\" (670 ft) offers steep climbs, sweeping southwesterly views of the Quinnipiac University campus and beyond to Long Island Sound. The trail descends on relatively on an exposed slope along an abandoned quarry to the Mill River, west along Mt. Carmel Ave. in Hamden, intersecting with both Whitney Avenue (Route 10), and the Farmington Canal Greenway. Between Whitney Avenue westward to Shepard Avenue (1.3 miles), the trail ascends Rocky Top, site of the Quinnipiac University hockey/basketball arena, the TD Bank Sports Center, opened in January, 2007 (also accessible by vehicle from Sherman Avenue). Since the clearing of surrounding land in 2007, the pinnacle of this , future-campus site rises well above the stadium structures, affording 360 degree views. To the northeast, the distinctive Metacomet Ridge is visible in Meriden, from this point. To the ENE is a view of the traprock quarry on the west-facing side (or \\"top\\") of the Sleeping Giant's head. To the east lies the original Quinnipiac University campus, with its signature white steeple. Due south is the familiar landmark of East Rock (6.1 miles), once a sacred site of the native Quinnipiac tribe, called \\"Roodenbergh\\", by Dutch explorers in the early 17th century, for its red, rocky cliffs. Atop East Rock stands the Civil War Soldiers and Sailors Monument with its tall, thin column of the Angel of Victory, refurbished in 2006. The New Haven skyline is silhouetted against its shimmering harbor on the Sound. Beyond, (31 miles) across the Sound lie the distant dunes of North Shore Beach in Long Island. To the south-southwest can be seen the undulating forests of West Rock Ridge State Park, site of the Regicides Trail. At its southwest extremity, the QT connects with the Regicides Trail, along the West Rock Ridge, where it passes Judges' Cave. Recognition / Inspiration Programs The Connecticut Forest and Park Association (CFPA) provides commemorative patches as recognition to hikers completing the entire length of one of the three original Blue-Blazed trails in Connecticut (Quinnipiac, Metacomet and Mattabesett). The Quinnipiac Trail patch can be obtained for a small fee ($1) after the hiking the entire trail is completed by contacting the Connecticut Forest and Park Association. The Sleeping Giant Park Association (SGPA) recognizes member hikers who have hiked all of the color- blazed trails in Sleeping Giant State Park including the Quinnipiac Trail section (AKA \\"Blue Trail\\") with a \\"Giant Master\\" certificate and an entry on the \\"Giant Masters\\" list webpage. The Giant Master Log form for recording hikes for submission can be obtained as a PDF file. Current Route The Quinnipiac Trail, between Banton St and Toelles Rd in North Haven, has been officially closed and is no longer being maintained by CFPA. The new southern terminus of the Quinnipiac Trail is at the Hartford Turnpike. This closure is primarily due to the nature of the floodplain in Quinnipiac River State Park (WB Maps QP 1 & QP 2).

Early life Walker was born in North Berwick, Scotland in 1855. He came to New Zealand in 1860. He attended school in Dunedin's Union Street, where Robert Stout was one of his teachers. He left school aged 14 to learn the trade of printing at the Evening Star. He became a prominent union leader. Walker made a name for himself serving as the secretary of the Otago Typographical Union where he acted as a mentor to younger members such as Kenneth McLean Baxter, leaving them with lasting commitments to the labour movement. He was also a Baptist dean and treasurer of Hanover Street Baptist Church. Political career He represented the Dunedin North electorate in Parliament from 1914 to 1919, when he was defeated by an Independent Labour candidate Edward Kellett. Walker was a prot√©g√© of Labour movement organizer Tom Paul, who did not contest a seat himself in the election, as he sat on the Legislative council, but must have felt vindicated after Walker's success. In 1914 he won election, with Alfred Hindmarsh and Bill Veitch as the remnant of the United Labour Party, and in 1916 the remnant and the Social Democratic Party combined to form the Labour Party (NZLP). Walker drew up the 1916 constitution and was the first secretary of the Labour Party caucus. He was the President of the NZLP but resigned in 1917 over the State Control issue, as he was a staunch prohibitionist. Between 1916 and 1919 he served as the Labour Party's whip.

Liquidity on these markets is called dark pool liquidity. The bulk of dark pool trades represent large trades by financial institutions that are offered away from public exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ, so that such trades remain confidential and outside the purview of the general investing public. The fragmentation of electronic trading platforms has allowed dark pools to be created, and they are normally accessed through crossing networks or directly among market participants via private contractual arrangements. Generally dark pools are not available to the public, but in some cases they may be accessed indirectly by retail investors and traders via retail brokers. One of the main advantages for institutional investors in using dark pools is for buying or selling large blocks of securities without showing their hand to others and thus avoiding market impact as neither the size of the trade nor the identity are revealed until some time after the trade is filled. However, it also means that some market participants are disadvantaged as they cannot see the orders before they are executed; prices are agreed upon by participants in the dark pools, so the market is no longer transparent. Three major types of dark pools exist: # independent companies set up to offer a unique differentiated basis for trading # broker-owned dark pools where clients of the broker interact, most commonly with other clients of the broker (possibly including its own proprietary traders) in conditions of anonymity # some public exchanges set up their own dark pools to allow their clients the benefits of anonymity and non- display of orders while offering an exchange \\"infrastructure\\" Dark pools are heavily used in high-frequency trading which has also led to a conflict of interest for those operating dark pools due to payment for order flow and priority access. High frequency traders may obtain information from placing orders in one dark pool that can be used on other exchanges or dark pools. Depending on the precise way in which a \\"dark\\" pool operates and interacts with other venues, it may be considered, and indeed referred to by some vendors, as a \\"grey\\" pool. These systems and strategies typically seek liquidity among open and closed trading venues, such as other alternative trading systems. Dark pools have grown in importance since 2007, with dozens of different pools garnering a substantial portion of U.S. equity trading. Lemke and Lins, Soft Dollars and Other Trading Activities, ¬ß2:28 (Thomson West, 2013-2014 ed.). Dark pools are of various types and can execute trades in multiple ways, such as through negotiation or automatically (e.g., midpoint crosses, staggered crosses, VWAP, etc.), throughout the day or at scheduled times. History The origin of dark pools date back to 1979 when a financial regulation changed in the United States that allowed securities listed on a given exchange to be actively traded off the exchange in which it was listed. Known as reg 19c3 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission passed the regulation which would start on April 26, 1979. The new regulation allowed the emergence of dark pools through the 1980s that allowed investors to trade large block orders while avoiding market impact and giving up privacy. In 1986, Instinet started the first dark pool trading venue known as \\"After Hours Cross\\". However it was not until the next year that ITG created the first intraday dark pool \\"POSIT\\", both allowed large trades to be executed anonymously which was attractive to sellers of large blocks of shares. For the next 20 years trades executed on dark pools represented a small fraction of the market, between 3-5% of all trades. This was sometimes referred to as \\"upstairs trading\\". The next big development in dark pools came in 2007 when the SEC passed Regulation NMS (National Market System), this allowed investors to bypass public exchanges to gain price improvements. The effect of this was to attract a number of new players to the market and a large number of dark pools were created over the next 10 years. This was spurred on with the improvements of technology and increasing speed of execution as high-frequency trading took advantage of these dark pools. Operation Truly dark liquidity can be collected off-market in dark pools using FIX and FAST protocol based APIs. Dark pools are generally very similar to standard markets with similar order types, pricing rules and prioritization rules. However, the liquidity is deliberately not advertised‚Äîthere is no market depth feed. Such markets have no need of an iceberg-order type. In addition, they prefer not to print the trades to any public data feed, or if legally required to do so, will do so with as large a delay as legally possible‚Äîall to reduce the market impact of any trade. Dark pools are often formed from brokers' order books and other off-market liquidity. When comparing pools, careful checks should be made as to how liquidity numbers were calculated‚Äîsome venues count both sides of the trade, or even count liquidity that was posted but not filled. Dark liquidity pools offer institutional investors many of the efficiencies associated with trading on the exchanges' public limit order books but without showing their actions to others. Dark liquidity pools avoid this risk because neither the price nor the identity of the trading company is displayed.http://fixglobal.com/home/control-and-flexibility-how-trading-can- add-value-to-the-investment-process/ FIXGlobal. Control and Flexibility: How Trading Can Add Value to the Investment Process. Retrieved 12 October 2012. Dark pools are recorded to the national consolidated tape. However, they are recorded as over-the-counter transactions. Therefore, detailed information about the volumes and types of transactions is left to the crossing network to report to clients if they desire and are contractually obligated.http://www.quantprinciple.com/invest/index.php/docs/realworld/darkpools/#tape Consolidated tape and DARK Pools Dark pools allow funds to line up and move large blocks of equities without tipping their hands as to what they are up to. Modern electronic trading platforms and the lack of human interaction have reduced the time scale on market movements. This increased responsiveness of the price of an equity to market pressures has made it more difficult to move large blocks of stock without affecting the price.\\"http://www.quantprinciple.com/invest/index.php/docs/realworld/darkpools/ Dark Pools: Some Reasons\\" Thus dark pools may protect traders from market participants who use HFT in a predatory manner.Congressional Research Service, \\"\\"Dark Pools\\" In Equity Trading: Significance and Recent Developments\\", Accessed 8 Sept 2014. Dark pools are run by private brokerages which operate under fewer regulatory and public disclosure requirements than public exchanges. Tabb Group estimates trading on the dark pools accounts for 32% of trades in 2012 vs 26% in 2008. =Iceberg orders= Some markets allow dark liquidity to be posted inside the existing limit order book alongside public liquidity, usually through the use of iceberg orders. Iceberg orders generally specify an additional \\"display quantity\\"‚Äîi.e., smaller than the overall order quantity. The order is queued along with other orders but only the display quantity is printed to the market depth. When the order reaches the front of its price queue, only the display quantity is filled before the order is automatically put at the back of the queue and must wait for its next chance to get a fill. Such orders will, therefore, get filled less quickly than the fully public equivalent, and they often carry an explicit cost penalty in the form of a larger execution cost charged by the market. Iceberg orders are not truly dark either, as the trade is usually visible after the fact in the market's public trade feed. =Price discovery= If an asset that can be only publicly traded, the standard price discovery process is generally assumed to ensure that at any given time the price is approximately \\"correct\\" or \\"fair\\". However, very few assets are in this category since most can be traded off market without printing the trade to a publicly accessible data source. As the proportion of the daily volume of the asset that is traded in such a hidden manner increases, the public price might still be considered fair. However, if public trading continues to decrease as hidden trading increases, it can be seen that the public price does not take into account all information about the asset (in particular, it does not take into account what was traded but hidden) and thus the public price may no longer be \\"fair\\". Yet when trades executed in dark pools are incorporated into a post-trade transparency regime, investors have access to them as a part of a consolidated tape. This can aid price discovery because institutional investors who are reluctant to tip their hands in lit market still have to trade and thus a dark pool with post-trade transparency improves price discovery by increasing the amount of trading taking place.FIXGlobal, \\"The Impact of Dark Pools on Access to Desirable Liquidity\\" Retrieved 12 October 2012. =Market impact= While it is safe to say that trading on a dark venue will reduce market impact, it is very unlikely to reduce it to zero. In particular the liquidity that crosses when there is a transaction has to come from somewhere‚Äîand at least some of it is likely to come from the public market, as automated broker systems intercept market-bound orders and instead cross them with the buyer/seller. This disappearance of the opposite side liquidity as it trades with the buyer/seller and leaves the market will cause impact. In addition, the order will slow down the market movement in the direction favorable to the buyer/seller and speed it up in the unfavourable direction. The market impact of the hidden liquidity is greatest when all of the public liquidity has a chance to cross with the user and least when the user is able to cross with ONLY other hidden liquidity that is also not represented on the market. In other words, the user has a tradeoff: reduce the speed of execution by crossing with only dark liquidity or increase it and increase their market impact. =Adverse selection= One potential problem with crossing networks is the so-called winner's curse. Fulfillment of an order implies that the seller actually had more liquidity behind their order than the buyer. If the seller was making many small orders across a long period of time, this would not be relevant. However, when large volumes are being traded, it can be assumed that the other side‚Äîbeing even larger‚Äîhas the power to cause market impact and thus push the price against the buyer. Paradoxically, the fulfillment of a large order is actually an indicator that the buyer would have benefitted from not placing the order to begin with‚Äîhe or she would have been better off waiting for the seller's market impact, and then purchasing at the new price.http://fixglobal.com/content/dark-pools-what-lies-beneath FIXGlobal. Dark Pools: What Lies Beneath. Retrieved 12 October 2012. Another type of adverse selection is caused on a very short-term basis by the economics of dark pools versus displayed markets. If a buy-side institution adds liquidity in the open market, a prop desk at a bank may want to take that liquidity because they have a short-term need. The prop desk would have to pay an Exchange/ECN access fee to take the liquidity in the displayed market. On the other hand, if the buy-side institution were floating their order in the prop desk's broker dark pool, then the economics make it very favorable to the prop desk: They pay little or no access fee to access their own dark pool, and the parent broker gets tape revenue for printing the trade on an exchange. For this reason, it is recommended that when entities transact in smaller sizes and do not have short-term alpha, do not add liquidity to dark pools; rather, go to the open market where the short-term adverse selection is likely to be less severe. Controversy The use of dark pools for trading has also attracted controversy and regulatory action in part due to their opaque nature and conflicts of interest by the operator of the dark pool and the participants, a subject that was the focus of Flash Boys, a non-fiction book published in 2014 by Michael Lewis about high-frequency trading (HFT) in financial markets. =Pipeline LLC controversy= Pipeline Trading Systems LLC, a company offering its services as a dark pool, contracted an affiliate that transacted the trades.Scott Patterson and Jenny Strasburg, \\"Traders Navigate a Murky New World\\", Wall Street Journal, April 9, 2012. In the Pipeline case, the firm attempted to provide a trading system that would protect investors from the open, public electronic marketplace. In that system, investors' orders would be made public on the consolidated tape as soon as they were announced, which traders characterized as \\"playing poker with your cards face up\\". The service Pipeline offered was to find counterparties for various trades in a private manner. The firm was subsequently investigated and sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for misleading its clients. Following its 2011 settlement of the SEC's claims against it, the firm rebranded itself as Aritas Securities LLC in January 2012. =Regulatory statements= In 2009 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that it was proposing measures to increase the transparency of dark pools, \\"so investors get a clearer view of stock prices and liquidity\\". These requirements would involve that information about investor interest in buying or selling stock be made available to the public, instead of to only the members of a dark pools.U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, \\"SEC Issues Proposals to Shed Greater Light on Dark Pools\\", 21 October 2009, accessed 25 May 2012. FINRA announced in January 2013 that it will expand its monitoring of dark pools. =Barclays lawsuit= In June 2014 the U.S. state of New York filed a lawsuit against Barclays alleging the bank defrauded and deceived investors over its dark pool. A central allegation of the suit is that Barclays misrepresented the level of aggressive HFT activity in its dark pool to other clients. The state, in its complaint, said it was being assisted by former Barclays executives and it was seeking unspecified damages. The bank's shares dropped 5% on news of the lawsuit, prompting an announcement to the London Stock Exchange by the bank saying it was taking the allegations seriously, and was cooperating with the New York attorney general. In July 2014 Barclays filed a motion for the suit to be dismissed, saying there had been no fraud, no victims and no harm to anyone. The New York Attorney General's office said it was confident the motion would not succeed. In January 2016, Barclays agreed to pay a fine of $35 million to SEC and $70 million to NYAG for its dark pool wrongdoings. =UBS fine= In January 2015 the U.S. regulators imposed a fine on UBS Group AG‚Äôs dark pool for failing to follow rules designed to ensure stock trades are executed fairly. In ordering UBS to pay $14.4 million, including a $12 million fine that exceeds all prior penalties against an alternative trading system, the Securities and Exchange Commission flagged a series of violations from 2008 to 2012. It said UBS let customers submit orders at prices denominated in increments smaller than a penny, something SEC rules prohibit because it can be used to get a better place in line when buying or selling stock. The ability to trade in sub-penny increments also wasn‚Äôt widely disclosed to UBS customers, and was instead pitched secretly to market makers including high- frequency traders, according to the SEC. =ITG fine= In August 2015, ITG (and its affiliate AlterNet Securities) settled with SEC for $20.3 million due to operating a secret trading desk and misusing the confidential trading information of dark pool subscribers.

In the United States, however, these trades were stymied by Regulation NMS in 2004. However, under section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Regulation ATS of 1998, off-exchange trading was allowed for up to five percent of the national volume of a stock. The US SEC adopted rules, as amendments to Regulation ATS, to require disclosures about dark pools in 2018. Known as Rule 304 of Regulation ATS, it requires the filing of Form ATS-N which includes a variety of disclosures including conflicts of interest, methods, fees, and so on. A review of these forms revealed a number of differences, including \\"tiering\\", \\"pegging\\", and \\"immediate-or-cancel (IOC)\\" orders, as well as a special features such as a speed bump to prevent high-frequency trading by IEX. FINRA reports data on ATS systems quarterly for free, which it began doing in July 2015. When FINRA released this data, it showed that trades averaged 187 shares, which suggests that the pools were not used for large trades by institutional shareholders.

The FMFN, signed to Treaty 8, is affiliated with the Athabasca Tribal Council and its members are of Cree, Metis and Dene heritage. The FMFN's traditional lands include portions of the Athabasca oil sands.  History  The Cree expanded steadily westward from the Hudson-James Bay country. Although the arrival of the Cree in the Lac la Biche region, is unknown, archaeological evidence in the form of pre-contact pottery indicates that the Cree were in this region in the 1500s. = The Historic Voyageur Highway = The traditional land of the Fort McKay First Nation was on the historical voyageur route that linked the rich Athabaskan region to Hudson Bay. David Thompson and George Simpson used the fur-trade route via the Beaver River from the main Methye Portage route that reached the Athabasca River. The Cree, one of the \\"largest tribes in Canada\\" were referred to by the early explorers and fur traders as Kristineaux, Kinisteneaux, Kiliston, Kree, Cris and various other names such as Nahathaway.This is the full-text diary of David Thompson which includes numerous references to the Nahathaway in general and to the First Nations of the Lac la Biche region in particular. He describes their belief in life after death and consequences on the human soul for crimes and misdeeds. Cree territory extended west from the Hudson-James Bay region to the foot of the Rocky Mountains, and in Alberta, between the north banks of the north Saskatchewan River to Fort Chipewyan. This includes the Beaver, Athabaska and Peace River basins. It is noted in the department of Indian Affairs Annual Reports that Pee-ay-sis of the Lac La Biche band as far north as Great Slave Lake.\\" Alexander Mackenzie who travelled from Montreal to the Arctic Ocean via the Methy Portage (see map) provided a detailed account of the Kinisteneaux (Cree) in 1789. = Tribal Council = The Athabasca Tribal Council, represents the interests of Fort McKay First Nation, Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation, Chipewyan Prairie First Nation, Fort McMurray No. 468 First Nation and Mikisew Cree First Nation. These five First Nations of North Eastern Alberta include more than 5,000 Cree and Dene people. = Treaty 8 = Treaty 8 was an agreement signed on June 21, 1899, between Queen Victoria and various First Nations of the Lesser Slave Lake area. The Treaty was signed just south of present-day Grouard, Alberta. The land covered by Treaty 8, is larger than France and includes northern Alberta, northeastern British Columbia, northwestern Saskatchewan and a southernmost portion of the Northwest Territories. Adhesions to this agreement were signed that same year on July 1 at Peace River Landing, July 6 at Dunvegan, July 8 at Fort Vermilion, July 13 at Fort Chipewyan, July 17 at Smith's Landing, July 25 and 27 at Fond du Lac, August 4 at Fort McMurray, and August 14 at Wabasca Lake. Further Adhesions were in 1900 on May 13 at Fort St. John, June 8 at Lesser Slave Lake, June 23 at Fort Vermilion and July 25 at Fort Resolution.  Traditional land use  \\"Hunting and trapping is an integral part of the traditional livelihoods for many Fort McKay residents. Therefore, natural ecosystems and wildlife populations preservation is an important component to help maintain a healthy community.\\" The FMFN expressed concerns about cumulative effects and requested that regulators implement the recommendations in the Terrestrial Ecosystem Management Framework (TEMF) in order to maintain wildlife populations (Cumulative Environmental Management Association 2008). In a letter to the Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development Regulatory Approvals Center regarding the Teck Resources Limited's (Teck) proposed Frontier Oil Sands Mine Project, on FMFN traditional lands, the FMFN stressed that beaver, moose and wood bison are three of the most important species of great importance to the FMFN. Other key resources indicators (KRI) to consider in assessing the effects on wildlife of oil sands development in their territory, include Black Bear, Fisher, Canada Lynx, Northern Goshawk, Yellow Rail, Short‚Äêeared Owl, Common Nighthawk, Olive‚Äêsided Flycatcher, Canada Warbler, Rusty Blackbird, Waterfowl and Western Toad.  Environment  The \\"Frontier Mine is a major surface mining project, with a total Project footprint of 24,140 ha and with a 50‚Äêyear operational life extending from approximately 2020 to 2070 including final closure and reclamation. Closure activities are proposed to be coordinated with the nearby Shell Pierre River Mine (PRM) project located immediately south.\\" = Groundwater = FMFN expressed concern about the degradation of the McMurray Basal Water Sands Aquifer (BWS), through high-volume use through the mining process. =Moose Lake 'last wilderness'= Moose Lake is a \\"sacred region\\" that serves as the community's \\"key cultural heartland\\". The community originated in the Moose Lake area, which is located 64 km northwest of Fort McKay, and there are gravesites on their traditional lands there, according to a January 20, 2018 article in The Narwhal. Moose Lake is actually two lakes‚ÄîGardiner Lake and Namur Lake. Fort McKay is \\"surrounded on three sides by oilsands development\\" with mines coming as \\"close as four kilometres to the community.\\" Moose Lake is the only remaining place that still has clean air and water that is \\"good enough to drink right from the lake\\". Grand Chief Mel Grandjamb of the Fort McKay First Nation said that, \\"We send hunting camps out there every year. We supply cabins to all our elders who want to go out there.\\" The local M√©tis community also uses Moose Lake for their \\"traditional activities\\". The band began to negotiate with the province of Alberta in the late 1990s to protect the lake and in 2014, then premier Jim Prentice had endorsed plan to protect the lake. The band had almost come to an agreement with the previous Alberta government in 2018 to create a \\"10-kilometre buffer\\". Brion Energy's Dover oil sands SAGD project (Moose Lake) The Dover oil sands SAGD project (Moose Lake) project, operated by Brion Energy, is a joint venture between Calgary-based Athabasca Oil Corporation, with Dover holding 40 per cent, and Chinese oil giant PetroChina, which owns 60 per cent.\\" The FMFN had delayed the Dover project by requiring \\"a 20-kilometre no-development buffer zone on part of Brion's oil sands leases that were near the FMFN Moose Lake traditional lands. On 6 August 2013, Alberta Energy Regulator‚Äôs (AER) denied the FMFN appeal arguing that the Dover oilsands project using steam-assisted gravity drainage technology (SAGD) development would have little impact on FMNN lands. On October 18, 2013 On Friday, Justice Frans Slatter of the Alberta Court of Appeal gave Fort MacKay First Nation leave to appeal the AER's August 6 approval of the Athabasca Oil Corporation's 250,000-barrel-per-day thermal oilsands project, Dover. The Fort MacKay First Nation's lawyer, Karen Buss, predicted that the new panel might \\"order the regulator to start its process over with direction to consider treaty rights issues identified by the band.\\" Prosper Petroleum Rigel oil sands SAGD project (Moose Lake) Prosper Petroleum, which is a junior oil sands company established in 2007 by veterans oilsands operators‚ÄîBlackRock Ventures and Koch Exploration Canada, had obtained leases from Koch Oil Sands Operating. Prosper Petroleum's Rigel Oil Sands Project is a steam-assisted gravity drainage technology (SAGD) development that is located just three kilometres off the shore of Namur Lake. Prosper Petroleum started drilling evaluation wells near Moose Lake in 2013. In June 2018, Alberta's energy regulator approved a $440-million, 10,000-barrel-a-day Oil Sands Project.

Early life and priesthood Eustaquio Ilund√°in y Esteban was born in Pamplona, Spain. He was educated at the Seminary of Pamplona, and the Seminary of Ciudad Real. He was ordained in 1886 in Pamplona. He served as a faculty member of the Seminary of Pamplona from 1886 until 1891. From 1901 until 1904 he was the Rector of the Seminary of Segovia. Episcopate He was appointed as bishop of Ourense by Pope Pius X on 14 November 1904. He served as a Senator of the Spanish Kingdom for the province of Santiago de Compostela. He was promoted to the metropolitan see of Seville on 16 December 1920. While bishop of Ourense he ordered the dismantling of a baldaquino that had been built over the altar of the monastery church of Santa Mar√≠a la Real de Oseira. He described it as \\"un armatoste\\". This ornate baroque wooden canopy, although possibly in a poor state of repair, was much loved by the villagers of Oseira. They were upset and protested but Bishop Ilund√°in refused to listen to them or retract his order. He considered that the baldaquino was an ugly monstrosity that spoiled the beauty of the magnificent church and would not be contradicted. The protests continued. Local carpenters refused to comply with the bishop's orders. Determined to be obeyed, in April 1909, a group of carpenters were sent from Ourense accompanied by an armed contingent of some sixteen or more Civil Guards, together with an officer, Lieutenant Salinas. The end result was the horrific massacre of at least seven villagers from among the crowd who had gathered to voice their objections. These included a fourteen-year-old girl, a pregnant woman and two old men of seventy. An unknown number were injured with bullet wounds, many frightened to identify themselves for fear of possible reprisals. Following the event, Bishop Ilund√°in conveniently disappeared for several weeks, ostensibly on an episcopal visit to some remote corner of the province, and could not be contacted. It is known that he had discussed the matter with the Civil Governor prior to the incident. Whether he requested the presence of the Civil Guards or whether the Civil Governor gave the order independently is not known. The fact is that he was complicit and that as a direct result of his heavy-handed and arrogant intransigence, innocent lives were brutally and unnecessarily taken. Cardinalate He was created and proclaimed Cardinal- Priest of San Lorenzo in Panisperna by Pope Pius XI in the consistory of 30 March 1925. He died while still in office in 1937.

They later started working on passenger trains as the electrification was expanded. A batch of five prototypes were delivered in 1964 as Type 126, numbered 126.001-126.005. 20 more were ordered around 1968, to be numbered 126.101-126.120. The final 15 arrived in 1971 and just missed getting six figure fleet numbers, carrying the numbers 2621-2635 from the factory. Actual original numbering turned out to be 126.001-126.005 (later 2601-2605), 126.101-126.120 (later 2606-2620) and 2621-2635. They had nothing in common with earlier Types 122, 123, 125, and 140. Type 126 was the result of an order from SNCB to BN in 1964 for 5 prototype electric locomotives that would be more powerful than all previous types. Additional weight was designed in at the start to increase tractive effort as with Type 123. Although Type 126 certainly looks Belgian with a strong resemblance to Type 150/Class 15, it is in fact an SNCF Class BB 9400 under the skin. The main internal difference between the two was BB 9400 ran on 1500 volts DC and Type 126 ran on 3000 volts DC. Most electrical components either came directly from France or were license-built in Belgium. These locos also had wheelslip detection. When the production series of locomotives were ordered they incorporated what SNCB had learned from the 5 prototypes. The five prototypes were rebuilt in 1976-1977 to bring them up to standard with the production batch, which had a number of small improvements. Unusually for SNCB, the French heritage of these locomotives got them classified as B‚Ä≤B‚Ä≤ rather than Bo‚Ä≤Bo‚Ä≤, being fitted with licence-built Schneider monomotor bogies. The locos were not very well-liked by their drivers and maintainers. Unlike Types 122, 123, 125 and 140 they were not indestructible. Worse yet, the design of the bogies made it impossible to change the trailing (closest to the middle of the loco) brake shoes on each bogie without lifting the locomotive, which was time-consuming. SNCB decided to stop replacing them to avoid the large amount of extra time and labor involved in a normally simple task. This was not a problem when they were pulling a train but there were several incidents that came close to becoming accidents when running light. One happened near Namur and it was in the local press the following day and in the railfan press in the following editions. Another negative point was this small class had almost no commonality of spares with earlier versions. The only exception seems to have been the cab assembly, shared with Type 150/Class 15. All were delivered in dark green. Some were repainted into yellow and blue to increase visibility. All ended up blue when SNCB decided that yellow locomotives needed to be washed more often than dark ones, a lesson since forgotten given the livery of Classes 13, 18¬≤, 19¬≤, AM96, AR41 and M6 and updated M5 coaching stock. 2627 was the last yellow electric on the SNCB. It was painted blue as were all other yellow and all green locomotives. They were later fitted for multiple working and worked with each other and with Class 23. All class 26s were taken out of the service in December 2011. Near the end of their service lives, Class 26s found themselves being used in a novel way. A top and tail pair of them worked several daily returns from Louvain-la-Neuve-Universit√© to Binche and return on an Inter Regional service via Brussels with a rake of M6 double deck stock in between. The reason was to put more seats on the busy line from Ottignies to Brussels during the peak commuting hours. This worked because a pair of Class 26s had almost the same power (7000 HP) as a single Class 13 or Class 20. Locomotive 2629 has been preserved by the PFT-TSP railway preservation group.

It is located on the Mexico City/Nuevo Laredo Highway at km 170 in the central west part of the state of Hidalgo. The town of Ixmiquilpan is noted for its parish church, Church of San Miguel Arc√°ngel, which contains a large series of murals done in the 16th century by native artists depicting Eagle and Jaguar warriors in battle, along with other pre-Hispanic imagery. History City entrance sign of Ixmiquilpan written in both Spanish and Otomi. The first ethnic group to settle in the Mezquital Valley in Hidalgo state were a group of Otomies, who called themselves H√±ah√±us. They named this area Nts ºuÃ±tk ºani, which means place of verdolagas or pigweed. They were well established here by the time the Toltecs arrived to establish the city of Tollan. These Otomies would be subjugated by the Toltecs then later by the Aztec Empire. Both these peoples spoke Nahuatl and renamed the area Itzmiquilpan (later spelled Ixmiquilpan), which means \\"place where the verdolagas cut like flint knives.\\" Under the Aztecs, these Otomies were not just a tributary people but also provided soldiers as allies in the Aztecs' many wars. This gave them a certain amount of autonomy within the Aztec Empire. This notion of autonomy would continue into the Colonial period when communities such as Orizabita and San Juanico called themselves \\"republics.\\" After the Conquest, the first Spanish arrived here headed by Pedro Rodr√≠guez de Escobar, who were sent by Pedro de Alvarado as scouts. The Augustinian monks who accompanied these soldiers founded the town of Ixmiquilpan, with the founding of the church and monastery of San Miguel Arc√°ngel in 1550. The town grew over time, and by the early 17th century, it was decided to build the first bridge over the Tula River, to connect Ixmiquilpan with the newer settlement of Barrio de la Otra Banda, today Barrio de Progreso. The project was undertaken by Captain Miguel Cuevas y D√°vales and inaugurated in 1655. Another important church, the Chapel of Nuestra Se√±ora del Carmen was built by Patricio Joseph Tovar. It was built in what was called the Tlazintla neighborhood, now called Del Carmen. Construction of the church betan in 1752 and completed in 1772. In 1779, Diego Alarc√≥n de Oca√±a was named mayor of the town, who introduced a potable water system, among a number of other projects of social benefit. For this reason, one of the main roads is named after here, and there was a statue of him on the main plaza. This statue was destroyed by an earthquake. During the Mexican War of Independence, insurgent forces under Ignacio L√≥pez Ray√≥n made camp here and also defeated royalist forces in the nearby village of Tamaleras, now called L√≥pez Ray√≥n. In 1854, a local uprising, especially in the communities of Orizabita and Remedios was caused by excessive taxes which Ixmiquilpan authorities levied. These were led by Sotero Lozano, who was called a bandit. This leader was most active in the towns of Actopan and Cardonal, his hometown. Another bridge over the Tula River was constructed in 1912 in the Barrio Del Maye. President Venustiano Carranza came to Ixmiquilpan in 1918 to inaugurate the rail line between Pachuca and here, along with the Nith train station. The rail line through here was planned by Englishman Richard Honey, who came to Ixmiquilpan with his family to settle. The rail line was supposed to run from Pachuca to Tampico, Tamaulipas but it was built only as far as this town. However, Honey did manage to build the \\"Iron Bridge\\" over the Tula River in the village of Tasquillo which became part of the Camino Real as well. While here, he also signed a convention to construct a canal now called Debodhe to divert water from the Tula River for agricultural purposes. General Alvaro Obregon also came here while campaigning for a second term as president of Mexico. During the presidency of L√°zaro C√°rdenas, who also visited Ixmiquilpan on several occasions, the Tecolote Dam as well as the El Morelos and El Moros Canals were built, to replace the old Debodhe canal. Later the Capula Dam would be built as well as a canal that brought drainage waters from the Valley of Mexico, which was also used for irrigation purposes. At the end of the 1930s the irrigation capacity of the valley was expanded again with the Maye Dam and the Felipe Angels Dam. In the 1940s the Mexico City/Laredo highway was built through Ixmiquilpan which gave the town more connection with the outside world. A short time later the municipal market was inaugurated in 1942 to meet the needs of the growing community. This market was originally on the main plaza but was moved to the Jose Maria Morelos neighborhood in 1969. In 1951, by presidential decree, the Patrimonio Ind√≠gena del Valle de Mezquital (Valley of Mezquital Indigenous Heritage) was created in Ixmiquilpan by President Miguel Alem√°n Valez and state governor D. Quint√≠n Rueda Villagran. The primary function of this organization is to promote the economy and the education of the Otomies of this region. One of its first projects was to build the Justo Sierra Secondary School in the town. Prior to this school's construction, youths had to travel to Pachuca or even to Mexico City for a secondary education. By 1969, many urbanization projects, such as the municipal market, paved streets and streetlights had been accomplished. Another project from this time was the remodeling of the main plaza and the installation of the Diana, the Huntress fountain in the center of the plaza. From the 1940s to the 1960s the town of Ixmiquilpan improved its infrastructure considerably with the installation of the public health clinic, expansion of the main park, a sports center, a municipal library, the remodeling of the Hidalgo Theatre, the establishment of the √ëa√±hu or Otomi Cultural Museum and installation of radio and television broadcast. Not only did this improved the socioeconomic status of those living here, the population quintupled. Climate The town It is considered the heart of the Mezquital Valley of Mexico. Located 158 km. from Mexico City by Mexican Federal Highway 85, it was an important commercial strategic spot even before the Spanish conquest. Its population is mainly Otomi, regionally called √ëha√±hu. According to town chronicler Jos√© Antonio Ram√≠rez Guerrero, Ixmiquilpan has taken steps to participate in the Pueblos M√°gicos programs, which are sponsored by the Mexican government's Tourism Secretary. The town qualifies for its history, surrounding landscapes and the Otom√≠ culture that is strongly present here. However, a number of improvements are still needed in the town's infrastructure, especially in the way of sanitation and services for tourists. =Church of San Miguel Archangel= Mural in the entrance area After the arrival of Augustinian monks shortly after the Spanish Conquest of Mexico, this church and its now former monastery were built by Fray Andr√©s de la Mata de Barrios in 1550. The church is dedicated to the Archangel Michael and was built using Indian labor pressed into service by the monks. This church is typical of the fortress-style churches built by the Augustinians in the 16th century. The facade is Plateresque style with paired columns and with a window in the choir area. The bell tower is annexed and joined with the facade. It has a crown and bell gables. However, what makes the church fairly unusual are its murals with overt pre-Hispanic themes. Imagery that is repeated here is that of holy war, with Eagle and Jaguar warriors as well as images associated with the sun and moon gods. The Jaguar and Eagle warriors were some of the armies that the Spanish fought during the Conquest, who wore resplendent apparel. Few explicit pictorial references to these warriors were permitted afterwards. The murals at Ixmiquilpan are an exception. The murals here appear in series of polychrome frescos, which have structure in a large and coherent way. Traditional monastic murals of that time were monochromatic and devoted to Biblical subjects. Some of these more traditional murals can be seen in the church's sacristy. The significance of the murals have been debated, especially since they are found so prominently in a Christian church of early in the colonial period. Mostly likely these images were at least partially reinterpreted with Christian themes. Many combine indigenous images with themes from the European Renaissance. The father sun figure in Otom√≠ mythology, Zidada Hyadi (Venerable Sun) was identified with Jesus (Zidada Hesu) and the moon goddess (Zin√§n√§) with the Virgin Mary As for the war images, The 1570s here were characterized by near-constant battles with the nomadic Chichimecas, which was finally ended with a decisive battle won by the Otomis. That battle was also views as a triumph of Christianity over paganism. Upon entering the church, one can see underneath the choir, fragments of murals showing Eagle and Jaguar warriors dialoguing, indicated by Aztec speech scrolls. Inside the nave is a large sequence of battle murals in enormous friezes that extend from under the choir long both sides. On the south wall, Eagle, Jaguar and Coyote warriors are dressed in animal skins, robes and feathered helmets, all fighting one another with obsidian swords and other weapons. The scenes depict decapitations and the dragging of prisoners against a landscape rich in foliage. Along the north wall, these warriors battle supernatural creatures such as a centaur which wears a headdress of quetzal feathers and figures of pregnant women emerging from acanthus buds. This church was declared a national monument in 1933. =The Diana fountain= Close up of the Diana, the Huntress statue In the center of the main plaza is a fountain, which contains a sculpture of Diana, the Huntress. This sculpture was the original Diana that was created by Olaguibel in 1942 and placed on Paseo de la Reforma in Mexico City. In 1944, a group known as the \\"League of Decency\\" headed by Soledad Orozco de Avila Camacho, wife of president Manuel √Åvila Camacho, decided that the Diana statue was indecent due to the fact that it was nude. It was removed from Reforma and put in Chapultepec Park before it came to Ixmiquilpan and was placed in the fountain there in 1970. The Diana statue that is currently in Mexico City is a second version cast by Olaguibel and placed in the same place in Mexico City. =Other sites of interest= The Bridge of San Miguel or La Otra Banda was the first built here in the 17th century. It was built of stone with large arches, and on each side of the river there are Moctezuma cypress trees marking the entrances. There used to be stone plaques that recorded the history of the bridges construction, and above one of them a statue of the Archangel Michael subduing the devil with his sword, but these have disappeared recently. It is part of a road that used to be called El Camino Real de Ixmiquilpan and is now known as Progreso Street. It was the Camino Real because it was the principle road connecting the towns of Tasquillo, Zimapan, Alfajayucan and Ixmiquilpan with the Bajio territory to the west. Until the construction of the Mexico City/Laredo highway, this was the major road of the area. Aside from the San Miguel Church, the Chapel of Nuestra Se√±ora del Carmen is one of the most important churches here. It has a pink stone facade, and inside there are tall wood altarpieces and large oil paintings. Its small atrium used to have a large number of cypress trees but these were cut down recently. The Municipal Palace and the Hidalgo Theater next to it were built at the initiative of Mayor Mar√≠n Y√°nez, between 1906 and 1910 in preparation for the Centennial of Mexico's Independence. A local story states that when the Palace was inaugurated, a small pot filled with gold coins was interred in one of the portals. In 1949, during the first remodeling of the building, this pot was found but no one knows what happened to the coins. The Universidad Tecnol√≥gica del Valle de Mezquital is sponsored by the state of Hidalgo and located in a number of communities and based in Ixmiquilpan. Its mission is to provide technical and economically important skills to the people of the state as well as promote university-level studies in many areas. =Festivals= The main altar in the Church of the Archangel Michael While Holy Week had always been an important, solemn commemoration in the Church of the Archangel Michael, in recent years, a re-enactment of Good Friday has been added, which is a procession from the Barrio of San Miguel to the church. Another important festival is that of the Holy Cross of Maye on the third of May. On this day descends the cross kept at the chapel on Deshitzo Mountain. This cross is the one that is brought up to the chapel on Deshitzo on 21 or 22 October in a procession that starts at the Maye Church and goes five km up the mountain to leave the cross and celebrate a Massachusetts The Feast of the Santo Ni√±o de Atocha is celebrated in Barrio Progreso the last Sunday in January. It is one of the most representative celebrations of the municipality and draws pilgrims from other parts of the state and elsewhere. The festival lasts two or three days, depending on the economy and includes amusement rides, traditional dances, sporting and cultural events. The Lord of Jalpan (Se√±or de Jalpan) has two dates associated with him. The first is a festival that is held on 13 June, which draws bands devoted to wind instruments, and has become an important economic contributor in recent years. The other event is a procession that has been held on 7 September since 1946. This is a very traditional procession with candles, flower-adorned arches, dancers, songs and fireworks. The procession begins at about 8pm and wanders the streets of Ixmiquilpan until about 2 in the morning. A secular parade particular to Ixmiquilpan takes place on 21 March. All the schools participate in the event creating floats and then marching around the town, dancing and playing instruments. The municipality The municipality of Ixmiquilpan consists of the town of Ixmiquilpan and 145 other recognized communities, which cover an area of 565.3 km¬≤. The largest communities outside of the seat are Panales, el Teph√©, Maguey Blanco, Orizabita, el Alberto, Dios Padre, Juli√°n Villagr√°n and Tatzadh√≥. The municipality borders with the municipalities of Zimap√°n, Nicol√°s Flores, Cardonal, Santiago de Anaya, San Salvador, Chilcuautla and Tasquillo. The total population of the municipality is 73,903, with 24,341, or almost a third speaking an indigenous language. The climate and topography of the municipal divide into two parts. The land is beautiful and many take hiking trips for fun since the climate is almost perfect. This is increasing tourism in the area. Many buses departing from Mexico City arrive to this destination and visitors spend time in the so famous water parks throughout the community. One well known park is El Parque Acuatico De Dios Padre. This particular park offers transportation, hotels, camping and services for tourists that come from Mexico City. Many immigrants that migrated to the U.S. in the 1980s as the result in shortages of farm labor in California are from this particular area. Now in their late 20s, many have now obtained a higher education in the U.S. and are now returning to their homeland in Ixmiquilpan. This has let to new entrepreneurship in the area. Small businesses of tourism and hotels can now be found across the city. The southern portion is dry with green areas only where there is irrigation. It is relatively flat. The north in squarely in the Mezquital Valley and is considerably higher, wetter and more mountainous. A mountain ridge separates the two sections. The highest elevations are found at the La Palma, Thito, Mu√±eca, Guadril, Temboo, Dexitzo and Daxhie Mountains. These and other mountains have forests which contain pine, oak, walnut and a number of other trees. The dry areas contain vegetation such as mesquite, nopal, palms and other plants adapted to arid areas. Much of the agriculture in the municipality occurs in the relatively flat south which relies on irrigation due to the lack of rainfall. Main crops are corn, beans, animal feed and tomatoes. Livestock raised includes cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, turkeys and bees. There is some fishing in the north, where water is abundant, but it is mostly for auto-consumption. One of the water parks in the municipality Almost a third of the population of the municipality still speaks an indigenous language, and this is almost exclusively Otom√≠. This is especially true in the smaller communities such as San Alberto, located in one of the lower portions of the Mezquital Valley off the highway between Ixmiquilpan and El Progreso, near the Tula River. It is a village of about 700 people, all of whom speak Otomi and a number speak little or no Spanish. They are farmers, living off the harvests of corn, beans and other staples. It is a poor town, with roads in disrepair and no streetlights. While the village has been converting this fresh water and hot springs here into bathing pools to attract tourism, many of their young people go to the United States to work and send back money. The cuisine of this area is dependent on what is grown here. The pigweed which used to be the base of Ixmiquilpan's Otomi name, is eaten with nopales and in other mixtures. Edible insects such as butterfly larvae, honey ants, nopal beetles, escamoles, mequite, nopal and corn worms are all used here in tacos, roasted, in omelets and other ways. The maguey flower, called gualumbo, is saut√©ed with epazote, onion and chile. Catfish and barbacoa are also staples here. The municipality contains a number of water parks which take advantage of the streams and springs that are heated by the volcanic activity of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt which runs through here. Many of these waters have a high mineral content and are claimed to have curative powers. Some of these water parks are Teph√©, Te-Path√©, Dios Padre, Parque Ecoturistico EcoAlberto, Balneario Valle Para√≠so, Pueblo Nuevo, Balneario Maguey Blanco, El Dauthi and Puerta de Oeste. There is also a natural reserve located to the north of the town on State Highway 27, which exuberant vegetation, waterfalls and rock formations, where camping and other outdoor activities are possible. While the majority of the municipality's population (83%) are Catholic, other denominations have a definite presence, especially those called \\"evangelicals.\\" In the village of San Nicol√°s, there have been religious conflicts between traditional Catholics and evangelicals since 1991. In 2001, nine evangelical families were expelled from the town. Tensions rose again in 2006, when Catholics opposed the construction of an evangelical church in the area, and tried to tear down the building under construction. In the community of Cantinela, a number of Catholic religious images were found torched. Local and state authorities have had to intervene on a number of occasions.

He was the first star of Hawaiian music and influenced many later artists. Biography Frank Ferera was born in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1885 of Portuguese ancestry. Ferera first visited mainland United States as part of the Keoki E Awai troupe, which had been booked to entertain at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition. He married Helen Louise Greenus, daughter of Seattle businessman Albert E. Greenus, and toured with her through the USA, appearing in vaudeville. In 1915, they signed a contract with Columbia Records and recorded prolifically. On December 12, 1919, Frank and Helen were on board the steamship SS President, from Los Angeles back to their home in Seattle. Frank reported that Helen had gone on deck for a walk at 4 a.m. and never returned. After a search failed to turn up the missing Mrs. Ferera, she was presumed lost at sea. In 1924, Frank played guitar accompaniment to Vernon Dalhart's ballad \\"Wreck of the Old 97\\" (Victor Record No. 19427), sometimes cited as the first million-selling country music release in the American record industry. In the late 1920s, during a wave of Hawaiian music popularity, Frank Ferera's Hawaiian Trio recorded a number of songs with jazz singer Annette Hanshaw, including: \\"Was It A Dream?\\", \\"For Old Time's Sake\\", \\"Get Out and Get Under the Moon\\", \\"I Love A Ukulele\\", \\"Lonely Nights In Hawaii\\", \\"Chiquita\\", \\"Maui Girl\\", \\"Sonny Boy\\", \\"Sweet Lei Lehua\\", \\"Carolina Moon\\", \\"Maui Chimes\\", \\"Pagan Love Song\\", \\"Singing in the Rain\\", \\"Ua No a Like - Sweet Constancy\\", and \\"Forget Me Not\\", \\"Lazy Louisiana Moon\\", and \\"Pale Blue Waters\\". While Ferera was the first commercially successful Hawaiian recording artist in the teens, by the late 1920s, a new wave of steel guitarists, including Sol Ho ªopi ªi, were upstaging him. Ferera married three times. He died on June 26, 1951, due to complications following a stroke.

In the second half oh the 19th century an orthodox Spassko-Preobrazhenskiy convent was built near the Senty church. The church was much altered at the urging of the nuns, its original form was changed. In the soviet times the convent was turned into an orphan house. At the present time it is being rebuilt. Near the church lie the ruins of a mausoleum which is also dates back to the 10th century. Supposedly it was intended to be used as a burial place for higher church officials. This building is unique for North Caucasus.  Architecture  The church is built from polished sandstone with a use of limestone solution. It has one dome. It is cross-shaped in plan, with an apse from the eastern side.  Interior  In the Senty Church there are lots of traces of frescoes. This is the biggest mural complex in Alania.

Biography Ladd was born in Los Angeles, California, the son of Alan Ladd, an actor, and Sue Carol, an actress and talent agent. His siblings are Alana Ladd Jackson, Carol Lee Ladd, and Alan Ladd Jr. He attended Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles and, following the death of his father in 1964, graduated from the University of Southern California where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree while also fulfilling his military obligations in the Air Force Reserves. Career Ladd's professional career in Hollywood began in 1957 with a supporting role in a film starring his father titled The Big Land. As a result of that film's success, Samuel Goldwyn Jr offered him a role as a mute in the 1958 movie The Proud Rebel, once again playing opposite his father and co-starring Olivia de Havilland. For this role, Ladd won a Golden Globe award as the \\"Best Newcomer of 1958\\" as well as a special award for \\"Best Juvenile Actor\\", and received a Best Supporting Actor nomination. He was also included in Film Daily's Filmdom's Famous Five critic's award. Ladd followed this success with a series of films including The Sad Horse (1959), A Dog of Flanders (1960), Raymie (also 1960) and Misty (1961), as well as appearing in numerous television shows including Bonanza, Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre, and Shirley Temple's Storybook (as Tom Sawyer). Ladd was again included in Film Daily's Filmdom's Famous Five in 1961 for A Dog of Flanders. Ladd's other feature film credits include RPM (1970), The Day of the Locust (1975), The Treasure of Jamaica Reef (1975), Jonathan Livingston Seagull (1977) and The Wild Geese (1978). Ladd's first solo producing credit came in the motion picture The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988), based on Wade Davis' book of the same name. The film was quite successful, and he was subsequently asked to join his half-brother Alan Ladd Jr in forming Pathe Films in 1988. The duo produced several films before acquiring the venerable Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). Ladd became a senior production executive at MGM and was part of the key team responsible for the resurgence of the studio (1989‚Äì1997). He was responsible for a variety of films, including the hit Get Shorty (1995). Ladd left MGM as an executive in 1998, and signed a deal to produce movies for them. His first production was a re-imagining of the hit TV series The Mod Squad, in which he shared an Executive Producer credit with Aaron Spelling, with whom he had first collaborated on The Zane Grey Theatre in 1961. During this period, MGM changed hands twice, but Ladd was able to continue his productions. He found a manuscript written by John Katzenbach and developed it as a screenplay for the 2002 film, Hart's War, directed by Gregory Hoblit and starring Bruce Willis, Colin Farrell and Terrence Howard. Ladd followed this up with the 2003 comedy A Guy Thing. Later years Shortly thereafter, MGM was sold and Ladd left the company as an independent. He is currently developing projects for Fox, Universal and Paramount, as well as projects for the independent film market- place. In 2008, he helped shepherd Kevin Sheridan's Leaving Barstow, which won several awards on the film festival circuit. Ladd spent a portion of 2007 teaching film production at the Savannah College of Art and Design. He is a member of the Producers Guild of America, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and an emeritus member of the Screen Actors Guild.

Alabama, 106 U.S. 583 (1883), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court affirmed that Alabama's anti-miscegenation statute was constitutional.. This ruling was rejected by the Supreme Court in 1964 in McLaughlin v. Florida and in 1967 in Loving v. Virginia. Pace v. Alabama is interracial sex court case in America.  Summary  The plaintiff, Tony Pace, an African-American man, and Mary Cox, a white woman, were residents of the state of Alabama, who had been arrested in 1881 because their sexual relationship violated the state's anti-miscegenation statute. They were charged with living together \\"in a state of adultery or fornication\\" and both sentenced to two years imprisonment in the state penitentiary in 1882.  Miscegenation  Because \\"miscegenation\\", that is marriage, cohabitation and sexual relations between whites and African Americans, was prohibited by Alabama's anti-miscegenation statute (Ala. code 4189), it would have been illegal for the couple to marry in Alabama. However, Tony Pace and Mary Cox were not married, for this reason, and they did not live together. They spent time together near their homes in Clarke County, north of Mobile. They could not marry each other under Alabama law. Interracial marital sex was deemed a felony, whereas extramarital sex (\\"adultery or fornication\\") was only a misdemeanor. Because of the criminalization of interracial relationships, they were penalized more severely for their extramarital relationship than if they had been both whites or both black. The Alabama code stated: ‚ÄúIf any white person and any negro, or the descendant of any negro to the third generation, inclusive, through one ancestor of each generation was a white person, intermarry or live in adultery or fornication with each other, each of them must, on conviction, be imprisoned in the penitentiary or sentenced to hard labor for the county for not less than two nor more than seven years.‚Äù  Appeals  = Procedural error in Cox indictment = Cox argued to the state Supreme Court that her indictment should be quashed on the basis that she had been charged and indicted under the name \\"Mary Ann Cox,\\" but her name was in fact, \\"Mary Jane Cox\\". The Alabama Supreme Court rejected this argument and upheld the indictment, stating, \\"The law knows but one christian name, and the insertion or omission of a defendant's middle name in an indictment is entirely immaterial; and a mistake in the middle name will not support a plea of misnomer.\\" = Fourteenth Amendment = On appeal to the supreme court of the state, the judgment was affirmed. Pace brought the case there insisting that the act which he was indicted and convicted under conflicted with the final clause of the first section of the fourteenth amendment of the constitution, which declares that no state shall deny to any person the equal protection of the laws. = Final Decision = The Alabama Supreme Court upheld the convictions. Each defendant's punishment was the same. The punishment for interracial cohabitation was focused not \\"against the person of any particular color or race, but against the offense, the nature of which is determined by the opposite color of the cohabiting parties.‚Äù The ‚Äúevil tendency‚Äù was greater in that kind of relationship than if both defendants were of the same race, since it could lead to ‚Äúa mongrel population and a degraded civilization.‚Äù The true severity of their offense did not really stem from the interracial relationship, but instead that the fornication could end in an amalgamation, or, simply, a mixed-race child. On further appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, the court ruled that the criminalization of interracial sex did not violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because whites and non-whites were punished in equal measure for the offense of engaging in interracial sex. The court did not need to affirm the constitutionality of the ban on interracial marriage that was also part of Alabama's anti-miscegenation law, since the plaintiff had chosen not to appeal that section of the law.  Later cases  The decision was understood, from that time to the 1960s, as reflecting a validation of state anti-miscegenation laws. However, the Supreme Court had not confronted the question of whether, given that Pace and Cox could not become husband and wife, they would inevitably be liable to prosecution for \\"adultery or fornication\\" if they lived as such. Only by implication had the ban against interracial marriage been addressed. (However, it is worth noting that, in the notorious 1896 case Plessy v. Ferguson (joined by all Supreme Court Justices other than John Marshall Harlan), the Supreme Court (in dicta) stated that bans on interracial marriage are constitutional (in spite of them technically being in violation of the freedom of contract, since marriage is technically a contract) and that they are within the police power of the state to make and enforce.) Moreover, only by indirection did the Court address the question of whether, since it was a first offense, the sentence should have been for no more than six months. In any event, the Court had upheld the Alabama laws, and no southern state, for the next eight decades, displayed any inclination to repeal such laws. Certainly, Alabama did not. The Supreme Court's decision in Pace v. Alabama would prove to have an even more durable career in the American law of interracial sex and, by extension, marriage than Plessy v. Ferguson would have on segregated transportation and, by extension, education. After Pace v. Alabama, the constitutionality of anti-miscegenation laws banning marriage and sex between whites and non-whites remained unchallenged until the 1940s. In 1967, these laws were ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in Loving v. Virginia (1967).

The ship was laid down on 24 April 1944 at Camden, New Jersey, by the Penn-Jersey Shipbuilding Corp.; launched on 13 September 1944; and sponsored by Mrs. Patrick J. Cushing. On that same day, she was reassigned and delivered to the Army, and her name was struck from the Navy list.

Additionally, their physiological function is thought to be similar to a protease inhibitor. It has been concluded, therefore, that WAP regulate the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells by preventing elastase-type serine proteases from carrying out laminin degradation and by suppressing the MAP kinase signal pathway in the cell cycle. Production in mammals Whey Acidic Protein(WAP) is the major milk protein in certain mammals. There are exceptions in some mammalian species, whereby WAP has not been found to be synthesized in the mammary gland. WAP motif and cancer There have been several candidate markers for cancer; most notably genes coding for elafin, antileukoproteinase 1 (previously called secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor, SLPI), WAP four disulphide core domain protein 1 (previously called prostate stromal protein 20 kDa, PS20), and WAP four disulphide core domain protein 2 (previously called major human epididymis-specific protein E4, HE4). These genes can be useful biomarkers for detecting tumours. Biochemistry of WAP motifs Whey Acidic Protein contains two to three four-disulfide core domain, also termed WAP domain or WAP motif. Each disulfide bond of the WAP motif is made up of two cysteine molecule. This motif is also found in other proteins of different functions, which led to the suggestion that WAP is associated with antiprotease or antibacterial properties.

Composed during a sojourn in Germany in 1798, the poem was first published in the second edition of Lyrical Ballads (1800).The Poetical Works of Wordsworth. Introduction by Paul D. Sheats. Cambridge ed. Houghton Mifflin Co., New York, 1982. p. 112. The poem describes the poet's trip to his beloved Lucy's cottage, and his thoughts on the way. Each of its seven stanzas is four lines long and has a rhyming scheme of a-b- a-b. The poem is written in iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter. In the poem, the speaker narrates a night time ride to the cottage of his beloved Lucy, who always looks as \\"fresh as a rose in June\\". The speaker begins by saying that he has experienced \\"strange fits of passion\\" and will recount them only to another lover (\\"in the Lover's ear alone, / What once to me befell.\\"). In the five following stanzas, he recounts how he wended his way on horseback \\"beneath an evening-moon\\". He crossed a lea, passed through an orchard, and began to climb a hill, atop which was Lucy's cottage. As he \\"came near, and nearer still\\" to \\"Lucy's cot\\", the sinking moon appeared to follow suit. As he closely approaches the cottage, the moon vanishes from sight behind the roof. A morbid thought rises unbidden to the speaker's mind: \\"O mercy!\\" he thinks. \\"If Lucy should be dead!\\" \\"Strange fits of passion have I known\\" is simple in form but complex in content. The dramatic first stanza (the speaker \\"will dare to tell\\" of his \\"strange fits of passion,\\" but \\"in the Lover's ear alone\\") quickly captivates the reader. Wordsworth then creates tension by juxtaposing the sinking moon and the approaching rider, the familiar landscape with the speaker's strange, dreamy feelings.Phillips, Brian. \\"Strange fits of passion have I known\\". \\"SparkNote on Wordsworth's Poetry\\". It is uncertain whether the Lucy of the poem was based on a historical person or was a creation of Wordsworth's fertile imagination. If she is real, her surname and identity are unknown, though they have been the subject of much \\"diligent speculation\\" in literary circles. \\"The one certainty is that she is not the girl of Wordsworth's Lucy Gray.\\"M.H. Abrams, ed. (2000), The Norton Anthology of English Literature: Volume 2A, The Romantic Period (7th ed.), New York: W. W. Norton & Company, Inc.

The term was popularized in the mid-20th century by Jiddu Krishnamurti, in whose philosophy it constitutes a central theme. Similar or related concepts had been developed previously in several religious or spiritual traditions. The term (or others like it) has also been used to describe traditional and contemporary meditation practices, both secular and religious. By the as a concept or term had appeared in a variety of fields, including neuroscience, therapy, and sociology, as well as in art. However, Krishnamurti's approach to the subject was unique and differs from both prior and later notions. Jiddu Krishnamurti Choiceless awareness is a major topic in the exposition of Indian philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti (18951986). Beginning in the 1930s, he often commented on the subject, which became a recurring theme in his work. He is considered to have been mainly responsible for the subsequent interest in both the term and the concept. Krishnamurti held that outside of strictly practical, technical matters, the presence and action of choice indicates confusion and subtle bias: an individual who perceives a given situation in an unbiased manner, without distortion, and therefore with complete awareness, will immediately, naturally, act according to this awarenessthe action will be the manifestation and result of this awareness, rather than the result of choice. Such action (and quality of mind) is inherently without conflict. He did not offer any method to achieve such awareness; in his view application of technique cannot possibly evolve into, or result in, true choicelessnessjust as unceasing application of effort leads to illusory effortlessness, in reality the action of habit. Additionally, in his opinion all methods introduce potential or actual conflict, generated by the practitioner's efforts to comply. According to this analysis, all practices towards achieving choiceless awareness have the opposite effect: they inhibit its action in the present by treating it as a future, premeditated result, and moreover one that is conditioned by the practitioner's implied or expressed expectations. Krishnamurti stated that for true choicelessness to be realized, choiceimplicit or explicithas to simply, irrevocably, stop; however, this ceasing of choice is not the result of decision-making, but implies the ceasing of the functioning of the chooser or self as a psychological entity. He proposed that such a state might be approached through inquiry based on total attentiveness: identity is then dissolved in complete, all-encompassing attention. Therefore, he asserted that choiceless awareness is a natural attribute of non-self-centered perception, which he called \\"observation without the observer\\". Accordingly, Krishnamurti advised against following any doctrine, discipline, teacher, guru, or authority, including himself. He also advised against following one's own psychological knowledge and experience, which he considered integral parts of the observer. He denied the usefulness of all meditation techniques and methods, but not of meditation itself, which he called \\"perhaps the greatest\\" art in life; and stated that insight into choiceless awareness could be shared through open dialogue. Krishnamurti's ideas on choiceless awareness were discussed by among others, influential Hindu spiritual teacher Ramana Maharshi (18791950) and, following wide publication of his books, they attracted the attention of psychologists and psychoanalysts in the 1950s; in subsequent decades Krishnamurti held a number of discussions on this and related subjects with practicing psychotherapists and with researchers in the field. His views on the subject have been included in scholarly papers on existential therapy, education theory, and peace research, but they have also been discussed in less formal or structured settings. In late1980, almost half a century after he started discussing it, Krishnamurti included the concept in \\"The Core of Krishnamurti's Teaching\\", a pivotal statement of his philosophy: \\"Freedom is found in the choiceless awareness of our daily existence and activity. Other representations In contrast with Krishnamurti's approach, other articulations commonly include choiceless awareness (or related ideas and terms) as part, or as the hoped-for result, of specific methodologies and meditation techniques. Similar concepts and terms appeared or developed in various traditional and contemporary religious or spiritual doctrines and texts, and also within secular disciplines such as psychotherapy, rehabilitation medicine, and counseling. Choiceless awareness has been examined within the context of philosophy of perception and behavior, while studies have cited its possible role in job performance. Other studies have linked meditation based on the concept (among others), with neural activity consistent with increased attentiveness, considered a factor of well-being and happiness. One term that is often used as a near-synonym is mindfulness, which as a concept has similarities to or may include choiceless awareness. Initially part of Buddhist meditation practice, it has been adapted and utilized for contemporary psychological treatment, and has been applied as a component of integrative medicine programs. Kindred themes can be found in the doctrine and meditation practices (such as VipassanƒÅ) associated with the Theravada school of Buddhism; and also in 20th-century offshoots such as the Thai Forest Tradition and the Vipassana movement. Within these and similar fields, for example the Shikantaza practice in Zen Buddhism, choiceless (or effortless) awareness is considered to frequently be the result of a mature progression of practice. The concept has been included in the discourse of transpersonal philosopher Ken Wilber (b. 1949), and also of independent Indian spiritual teacher Osho (Rajneesh) (19311990). Tibetan Buddhism teacher Ch√∂gyam Trungpa (19391987), who engaged in dialogue with Krishnamurti, used the term to describe the experience of shunyata (≈ö≈´nyatƒÅ)in Sanskrit, \\"emptiness\\", or \\"ego-less perception\\". Among other fields, the term has appeared in dispute resolution theory and practice, and has found application in artistic endeavors. In dramatic theory, theater criticism, and acting, it has been used to denote spontaneous creativity and related practices or attempts; it has additionally appeared in music works. Author J. D. Salinger (19192010), who was interested in spirituality and alternative religions, was reputedly an adherent of Ramana Maharshi's ideas on choiceless awareness. Contrary to press reports published in mid-20th-century, later interest in practices related to, or influenced by, choiceless awareness, has resulted in unambiguously favorable mentions in the popular press. Additionally, mass market general interest titles covering the subject have been published.

The company manufactures custom high-end furniture which is sold mostly to designers through wholesale showrooms. After the acquisition of Karges by another luxury furniture maker, Kindel Furniture, all production of Karges was moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan. All of the company's casegoods are now made in Grand Rapids, Michigan. History In 1886, Albert F. Karges, a first-generation immigrant, invested $600 and began making moderately priced bedroom furniture of solid oak and walnut. At that time, the river port town of Evansville, Indiana was one of the largest hardwood furniture manufacturing centers in the world. Frederick Bockstege was the company president until 1910. The company prospered through the turn of the century and Albert's son, Edwin F. Karges, Sr., joined the family business after World War I. He had an interest in European designs and traveled extensively in an effort to learn more about the old-world styles. Soon, the Karges line took on a more classic look and began separating itself from its competitors as he began to develop his own ideas. After World War II, Edwin's son, Edwin F. Karges, Jr., joined the business. He graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in Wood Technology, and his knowledge and skill in wood finishing provided the groundwork for developing the Karges finishing process. Over the years all four of the Karges children have been involved in the business. Joan Karges Rogier worked alongside her father and represented the fourth generation of leadership.

He travelled abroad in Holland and Germany and entered Middle Temple in 1694. He succeeded his father in 1719. Gybbon entered Parliament in 1707 as Whig Member of Parliament for Rye, and represented the constituency until his death 55 years later, eventually becoming Father of the House of Commons from 1749. Early in his career he was appointed a Commissioner of Revenue in Ireland, and in the 1720s was Chairman of the Committee of Privileges and Elections. From 1726 to 1730, he was Surveyor-General of Land Revenues. For the next few years he was in opposition, supporting Pulteney against Robert Walpole's administration.

Gates Corporation, based in Denver, Colorado, is a manufacturer of power transmission belts and fluid power products, which are used in diverse industrial and automotive applications. The company employs over 14,000 and has sales and manufacturing operations in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Middle East. History On October 1, 1911, Charles Gates Sr. purchased the Colorado Tire and Leather Company located in Denver, Colorado beside the South Platte River. Colorado Tire and Leather Company made a single product, the Durable Tread, a steel-studded band of leather that motorists attached to tires to extend their mileage. In 1917, the company began phasing out leather in favor of rubber and Charles Gates changed its name to the International Rubber Company. That same year, John Gates, Charles's brother, developed a belt made of rubber and woven threading called a V-belt, due to its shape. It replaced the hemp and rope belt used on automobiles and industrial machinery at the time, and was a model for the common serpentine belt. The belt's success propelled the company to become the largest manufacturer of V-belts, a title it still holds. In 1919, the International Rubber Company changed its name to the Gates Rubber Company. Gates continued its expansion across the United States, opening more factories and hiring thousands of people. Then, in 1954, its first international manufacturing facility was built in Brantford, Ontario, Canada. Expansion to other countries followed. In 1958, the company opened Gates Rubber de Mexico. In 1963, Gates built a belt and hose plant in Erembodegem, Belgium, the first of many European facilities. The former Gates Rubber factory, for many years a Denver landmark, was demolished in 2014. In the 1980s, Gates expansion continued when the company acquired the Uniroyal Power Transmission Company and became the world's largest synchronous/timing belt manufacturer, firmly establishing its growth path in the Asia-Pacific region. In 1996, the company was acquired by the British-based engineering firm Tomkins plc, ending 85 years of family ownership. In 2003, Gates changed its name to The Gates Corporation, a move reflecting the company's expanding range of industrial brands, product lines, and customers. The Denver factory closed, and by 2001, some buildings hadn't been used in nearly a decade. Asbestos contaminated the buildings and trichloroethylene in the groundwater was still under remediation in late 2014. While parts of the property had been redeveloped, the original factory remained deserted until November 2013, when demolition of the final factory buildings began. The site was purchased by Denver-based Frontier Renewal in September 2014 with the intention of completing the cleanup preparing it for future development. In July 2014, The Blackstone Group, the world‚Äôs largest buyout firm, agreed to acquire The Gates Corporation from Onex Corp. (OCX) and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board for $5.4 billion. In December 2017, Gates Corporation filed an initial public offering and became a public corporation. The company's headquarters are located at 1144 15th Street in Denver, Colorado.  Products, services  Gates designs and manufactures industrial belt, hose and hydraulic products for various industries: * Energy, Exploration & Extraction: Products and services for the energy, marine, mining, oil and gas, and oil refining industries. * Infrastructure & Agriculture: Heavy-duty applications, including construction, agriculture, logging, and material handling. * Transportation: New build and replacement products for fleet and heavy-duty vehicles, freight, towables, and rail applications. * Automotive: OEM automotive aftermarket products for cars, light trucks, and snowmobile, sport, fleet, and heavy-duty vehicles. * Bicycles: Carbon belt drives as replacements for bicycle chains. * Process & Specialty: Hoses and belts for products used in homes, offices, laboratories, food processing plants.

It is a slender island, approximately a mile, or two kilometres long. Geography Siolaigh/Shillay can be seen in the distance Ceann Iar is the second largest of the Monach Islands. It is connected at low tide to Ceann Ear via Sibhinis. It is said that it was at one time possible to walk all the way to Baleshare, and on to North Uist, five miles away, at low tide. In the 16th century, a large tidal wave was said to have washed this away. Despite Ceann Iar's name, Shillay is in fact the westernmost of the group. Like the other islands of the group, it is a low-lying, sandy island, subject to intense coastal erosion. Not unlike the Isles of Scilly, it is possible that Ceann Iar, Sibhinis and Ceann Ear formed a single body of land within historic times, and that their land area has greatly decreased due to overgrazing, and wind erosion as well. On the east side is Baile Beag (little town), the settlement of the island, on the slopes of Cnoc Bh√†rr (top hill), which at 19 metres in height is a mere metre higher than neighbouring Ceann Ear's hillocks. In the north, there is also Cnoc M√≤r (big hill), which is the other \\"height\\" on the island. The west is formed by Rubha Shulabhaig (a headland), and the north east by Hearnish.

The ship hit a mine in 1917, during World War I, off Northern Ireland, and his body had drifted all the way to here. Strangely, this accords with the old Hebridean tradition that the sea carries the drowned home - the Monachs are Clan MacNeil territory. The island had been settled intermittently for over a thousand years, although the main settlement was on Ceann Ear.

On the way to Leadville, Colorado she meets J.J. \\"Leadville\\" Johnny Brown, who falls in love with her and promises to give her whatever she wants (\\"I'll Never Say No\\"). After they marry, Johnny sells a claim and provides Molly with the money she wants, enough to enter the high social life in Denver (\\"Beautiful People of Denver\\"). Molly and Johnny, now dressed in gaudy finery, are made fun of by the Denver society people she wants to impress, and they travel to Europe, against Johnny's better instincts. The couple, and especially Molly, are welcomed and accepted by European royalty, but the attentions of Prince DeLong towards Molly upset Johnny and he returns to Leadville alone. Molly realizes that Johnny is her true love, and she sails for home on the RMS Titanic (\\"Dolce Far Niente\\"). As the Titanic sinks and the tragedy unfolds, Molly survives in one of the lifeboats. She finally is reunited with Johnny, who has built Molly her own \\"castle,\\" a beautiful home in the Rocky Mountains.

Power system simulation software's are a class of computer simulation programs that focus on the operation of electrical power systems. These types of computer programs are used in a wide range of planning and operational situations for: # Electric power generation - Nuclear, Conventional, Renewable # Commercial facilities # Utility transmission # Utility distribution # Railway power systems # Industrial power systems Applications of power system simulation include: long-term generation and transmission expansion planning, short-term operational simulations, and market analysis (e.g. price forecasting). These programs typically make use of mathematical optimization techniques such linear programming, quadratic programming, and mixed integer programming. Key elements of power systems that are modeled include: #Load flow (power flow study) #Short circuit or fault analysis #Protective device coordination, discrimination or selectivity #Transient or dynamic stability #Harmonic or power quality analysis #Optimal power flow There are many power simulation software packages in commercial and non-commercial forms that range from utility-scale software to study tools. Load flow calculation The load-flow calculation is the most common network analysis tool for examining the undisturbed and disturbed network within the scope of operational and strategic planning. Using network topology, transmission line parameters, transformer parameters, generator location and limits, and load location and compensation, the load-flow calculation can provide voltage magnitudes and angles for all nodes and loading of network components, such as cables and transformers. With this information, compliance to operating limitations such as those stipulated by voltage ranges and maximum loads, can be examined. This is, for example, important for determining the transmission capacity of underground cables, where the influence of cable bundling on the load capability of each cable has to be taken also into account. Due to the ability to determine losses and reactive- power allocation, load-flow calculation also supports the planning engineer in the investigation of the most economical operation mode of the network. When changing over from single and/or multi-phase infeed low-voltage meshed networks to isolated networks, load-flow calculation is essential for operational and economical reasons. Load-flow calculation is also the basis of all further network studies, such as motor start-up or investigation of scheduled or unscheduled outages of equipment within the outage simulation. Especially when investigating motor start-up, the load-flow calculation results give helpful hints, for example, of whether the motor can be started in spite of the voltage drop caused by the start-up current. Short circuit analysis Short circuit analysis analyzes the power flow after a fault occurs in a power network. The faults may be three-phase short circuit, one-phase grounded, two-phase short circuit, two-phase grounded, one-phase break, two- phase break or complex faults. Results of such an analysis may help determine the following: # Magnitude of the fault current # Circuit breaker capacity # Rise in voltage in a single line due to ground fault # Residual voltage and relay settings # Interference due to power line.Soonee, Sushil Kuman. \\"Short Circuit Analysis for Power System.\\" RCC \\"Feedback\\"6.12 (1983): 3-5.

Transient stability simulation The goal of transient stability simulation of power systems is to analyse the stability of a power system from sub-second to several tens of seconds. Stability in this aspect is the ability of the system to quickly return to a stable operating condition after being exposed to a disturbance such as for example a tree falling over an overhead line resulting in the automatic disconnection of that line by its protection systems. In engineering terms, a power system is deemed stable if the substation voltage levels and the rotational speeds of motors and generators return to their normal values in a quick and continuous manner. Figure 1. Specifies the acceptable amount of time it takes grid voltages return to their intended levels, which may vary depending on the magnitude of voltage disturbance. Models typically use the following inputs: * Number, size and type of generators with any available mechanical, electrical, and control (governor, voltage regulation, etc.) parameters, * a mix of residential, commercial and industrial load at each bus, * location and specifications for distributed control devices such as tap-changing transformers, switched shunt compensation, static Var compensators, flexible AC transmission systems, etc., * location and specifications for protection devices such as relays and load shedding, and * location and specifications of any other relevant control and/or protection devices.Smith, Michael. ‚ÄúElectric Power System Modeling & Simulation.‚Äù 15 Feb. 2010. Powerpoint presentation. https://www.cs.nmt.edu/~jholten/ModelingAndSimulation/lectures/9b_EP_System_Modeling.pdf The acceptable amount of time it takes grid voltages return to their intended levels is dependent on the magnitude of voltage disturbance, and the most common standard is specified by the CBEMA curve in Figure. 1. This curve informs both electronic equipment design and grid stability data reporting.\\"CBEMA Curve‚Äì The Power Acceptability Curve for Computer Business Equipment.\\" Power Quality In Electrical Systems. N.p., 3 Apr. 2011. Web. 22 Nov. 2016. <http://www.powerqualityworld.com/2011/04/cbema-curve-power- quality-standard.html>. Unit commitment The problem of unit commitment involves finding the least-cost dispatch of available generation resources to meet the electrical load. Generating resources can include a wide range of types: #Nuclear #Thermal (using coal, gas, other fossil fuels, or biomass) #Renewables (including hydro, wind, wave-power, and solar) The key decision variables that are decided by the computer program are: #Generation level (in megawatts) #Number of generating units on The latter decisions are binary {0,1}, which means that the mathematical problem is not continuous. In addition, generating plants are subject to a number of complex technical constraints, including: #Minimum stable operating level #Maximum rate of ramping up or down #Minimum time period the unit is up and/or down These constraints have many different variants; all this gives rise to a large class of mathematical optimization problems. Optimal power flow Electricity flows through an AC network according to Kirchhoff's Laws. Transmission lines are subject to thermal limits (simple megawatt limits on flow), as well as voltage and electrical stability constraints. The simulator must calculate the flows in the AC network that result from any given combination of unit commitment and generator megawatt dispatch, and ensure that AC line flows are within both the thermal limits and the voltage and stability constraints. This may include contingencies such as the loss of any one transmission or generation element - a so-called security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF), and if the unit commitment is optimized inside this framework we have a security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC). In optimal power flow (OPF) the generalised scalar objective to be minimised is given by: : f(u_0, x_0) where u is a set of the control variables, x is a set of independent variables, and the subscript 0 indicates that the variable refers to the pre- contingency power system. The SCOPF is bound by equality and inequality constraint limits. The equality constraint limits are given by the pre and post contingency power flow equations, where k refers to the kth contingency case: : g^k(u^k, x^k)=0 qquadtext{for }k=1,2,ldots,n , The equipment and operating limits are given by the following inequalities: : U^k_{min} le U^k le U^k_{max} , represent hard constraints on controls : h^k_{min} le X^k le X^k_{max} , represents hard/soft constraints on variables : h^k(u^k, x^k) le 0 text{ for } k=0,1,ldots,n , represents other constraints such as reactive reserve limits The objective function in OPF can take on different forms relating to active or reactive power quantities that we wish to either minimise or maximise. For example we may wish to minimise transmission losses or minimise real power generation costs on a power network. Other power flow solution methods like stochastic optimization incorporate the uncertainty found in modeling power systems by using the probability distributions of certain variables whose exact values are not known. When uncertainties in the constraints are present, such as for dynamic line ratings, chance constrained optimization can be used where the probability of violating a constraint is limited to a certain value. Another technique to model variability is the Monte Carlo method, in which different combinations of inputs and resulting outputs are considered based on the probability of their occurrence in the real world. This method can be applied to simulations for system security and unit commitment risk, and it is increasingly being used to model probabilistic load flow with renewable and/or distributed generation.Banerjee, Binayak, and Syed Islam. \\"Modelling and Simulation of Power Systems.\\" Smart Power Systems and Renewable Energy System Integration.

Web. 22 Nov. 2016. http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-30427-4 Models of competitive behavior The cost of producing a megawatt of electrical energy is a function of: #fuel price #generation efficiency (the rate at which potential energy in the fuel is converted to electrical energy) #operations and maintenance costs In addition to this, generating plant incur fixed costs including: #plant construction costs, and #fixed operations and maintenance costs Assuming perfect competition, the market-based price of electricity would be based purely on the cost of producing the next megawatt of power, the so-called short-run marginal cost (SRMC). This price however might not be sufficient to cover the fixed costs of generation, and thus power market prices rarely show purely SRMC pricing. In most established power markets, generators are free to offer their generation capacity at prices of their choosing. Competition and use of financial contracts keeps these prices close to SRMC, but inevitably offers price above SRMC do occur (for example during the California energy crisis of 2001). In the context of power system simulation, a number of techniques have been applied to simulate imperfect competition in electrical power markets: #Cournot competition #Bertrand competition #Supply function equilibrium #Residual Supply Index analysis Various heuristics have also been applied to this problem. The aim is to provide realistic forecasts of power market prices, given the forecast supply- demand situation.  Long-term optimization  Power system long-term optimization focuses on optimizing the multi-year expansion and retirement plan for generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. The optimization problem will typically consider the long term investment cash flow and a simplified version of OPF / UC (Unit commitment), to make sure the power system operates in a secure and economic way. This area can be categorized as: #Generation expansion optimization #Transmission expansion optimization #Generation-transmission expansion co-optimization #Distribution network optimization  Power System Study Specifications  A well-defined power systems study requirement is critical to the success of any project as it will reduce the challenge of selecting the qualified service provider and the right analysis software. The system study specification describes the project scope, analysis types, and the required deliverable. The study specificationhttps://etap.com/docs/default-source/power-systems-study- specification/power_systems_study_specifications.pdf?sfvrsn=22 must be written to match the specific project and industry requirements and will vary based on the type of analysis.  Power system simulation software  General Electric's MAPS (Multi-Area Production Simulation) is a production simulation model used by various Regional Transmission Organizations and Independent System Operators in the United States to plan for the economic impact of proposed electric transmission and generation facilities in FERC-regulated electric wholesale markets. Portions of the model may also be used for the commitment and dispatch phase (updated on 5 minute intervals) in operation of wholesale electric markets for RTO and ISO regions. ABB's PROMOD is a similar software package. These ISO and RTO regions also utilize a GE software package called MARS (Multi-Area Reliability Simulation) to ensure the power system meets reliability criteria (a loss-of-load-expectation (LOLE) of no greater than 0.1 days per year). Further, a GE software package called PSLF (Positive Sequence Load Flow), a Siemens software package called PSSE (Power System Simulation for Engineering) and Electrical Transient Analyzer Program (ETAP) by Operation Technology Inc.Operation Technology Inc. analyzes load flow on the power system for short-circuits and stability during preliminary planning studies by RTOs and ISOs.

Career Born in Sutton Coldfield, Nicholls started his career as a trainee at Wolverhampton Wanderers but never made the first team. He later played for non-league clubs Cradley Town and Cheltenham Town, before returning to the professional ranks when he was signed by Peter Shilton, who was then manager of Plymouth Argyle, for ¬£15,000 before the start of the 1993/94 season. During his time at Plymouth, Nicholls's form was so impressive that Shilton felt forced to play him - even though Shilton was himself chasing the 1,000 league appearances record (which he finally achieved at Leyton Orient in December 1996). After his first season in professional football, during which Plymouth just missed out on promotion to Division One, Nicholls was called up to the England Under-21 team and played in the Toulon Tournament in the summer of 1994. In his two years at Plymouth, Nicholls played 79 games for the club, gaining a reputation as a brilliant but larger-than-life footballer who was often in trouble off the pitch. After Shilton left Plymouth halfway through the 1994‚Äì95 season, Nicholls struggled with injuries and clashed with new manager Neil Warnock - who was keen to bring his own players into the club. At the beginning of the 1995‚Äì96 season, Nicholls was released by Warnock after a series of off-the-pitch indiscretions. He subsequently moved to Gillingham as cover for the more experienced Jim Stannard, making one appearance in a Football League Trophy match, and was still on trial at Priestfield Stadium when Football Conference side Stalybridge Celtic contacted the club to ask if they could borrow him to cover a suspension. Death On 25 November 1995, Nicholls played for Stalybridge in a 3‚Äì1 win at Dover Athletic. After the game, Nicholls left with his friend Scott Lindsey, and Scott's brother, Matthew, and their father. Nicholls travelled in the car with Scott and his father, while Matthew followed on his motorbike. About an hour into their journey, Nicholls offered to travel on the back of Matthew's motorbike. Soon afterwards, Matthew lost control of the bike on the A1 near Peterborough and careered off the road.

Cooksey was the son of George Cooksey from Birmingham, England and Linda Dows from New York. After High School at the Thacher School in California, Donald Cooksey followed his brother Charlton Cooksey (a physics professor at Yale) and attended Yale and where he too became a physicist specializing in designing and building scientific instruments, especially detectors for measuring sub-atomic particles such as neutrons. When Ernest O. Lawrence was at Yale during the 1920s, Cooksey and Lawrence became friends. In 1932, after Lawrence had moved to Berkeley, California to set up the Radiation Laboratory there, Lawrence asked Cooksey to come to Berkeley to make detectors for use with Lawrence's cyclotrons. Cooksey continued to be a close associate of Lawrence and became associate director of the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory of the University of California at Berkeley. Donald Cooksey and his wife Milicent Sperry had a son Donald Dows Cooksey (born in 1944) and a daughter Helen Sperry Cooksey (born 1947) who became a surgeon.
