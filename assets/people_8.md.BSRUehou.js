Biography Wills was born in Jewett, Texas, and was the younger brother of Bob Wills. He played banjo with Bob as a member of the Texas Playboys starting in 1934, the year the ensemble began playing on KVOO-AM in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In 1939 he founded his own group, the Rhythmairs, but returned to the Playboys in 1940 when Bob split the ensemble into two groups and named Johnnie Lee leader of one of them. Following Bob's move to California in 1940, Johnnie Lee renamed his group Johnnie Lee Wills & All The Boys, remaining in Oklahoma. Johnnie Lee switched from banjo to fiddle in this group. In 1941 he signed with Decca Records, and recorded again with Bullet Records in 1949, where he saw his greatest success with songs such as \\"Rag Mop\\" and \\"Peter Cotton Tail\\". In 1952 he signed with RCA Victor, where he was less successful, though he was still a popular draw in Oklahoma and remained a fixture on KVOO until 1958. He continued to record through the early 1960s, but his ensemble dissolved in 1964, after which he was only intermittently active in music. He opened a clothing store in Tulsa, and recorded for Flying Fish Records and Delta Records in the 1970s after Bear Family Records and Rounder Records reissued some of his old material. Wills died from heart complications on October 25, 1984 in Tulsa. On September 14, 1996, Tulsa honored Wills with a street named after him. Johnnie Lee Wills Lane is directly in front of the Expo Square Pavilion at the Tulsa State Fairgrounds. At the official dedication in 1996, his son John T. Wills said, \\"...although Dad was born a Texan, when you think about it, he lived and died a Tulsan.\\" References *John Bush, [ Johnnie Lee Wills] at Allmusic 1912 births 1984 deaths People from Jewett, Texas American fiddlers American country singer-songwriters Singers from Texas Western swing fiddlers 20th- century violinists 20th-century American singers Songwriters from Texas Country musicians from Texas ","title":"Johnnie Lee Wills"},{"id":"23768063","text":"Salem is an unincorporated community in Blue Creek Township, Adams County, in the U.S. state of Indiana.

This all-inclusive scope‚ÄîCanada, the United States, Spanish America, Brazil, smaller Anglophone and Francophone countries, and Native America‚Äîcovers the principal languages of the extreme Western Hemisphere‚ÄîEnglish, Spanish, Portuguese, French‚Äîas well as, in some cases, indigenous languages. The method can have a broad focus, as in studies of race relations in the Americas or the literary representation of the Native American, or it can focus more narrowly on issues of influence and reception that link specific authors and texts. For example, certain novels by Brazil‚Äôs Machado de Assis influenced John Barth‚Äôs The Floating Opera, and Faulkner influenced a number of writers from Spanish America, including Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez and Mario Vargas Llosa. Inter- American Literature can also deal with the development of certain literary forms, such as the immigrant novel or the New-World epic poem, or with literary periods and movements, such as the colonial period, the nineteenth- century, or Modernism in the Americas. Ideally, every Inter-American Literature project should involve at least two of the New World‚Äôs languages and literatures, as, for instance, in a study of the ‚ÄúNew Novel‚Äù form in Canada, the United States, Peru, and Brazil during the 1960s. As in comparative studies generally, inter-American literary scholarship should work, as often as possible, with texts written in their original languages and should seek to identify those similarities (of theme, form, or period) that tie the literatures of the Americas together while also recognizing and maintaining the very important differences (of history, style, and culture) that distinguish them and that make them separate works of art. At present, Inter-American Literature is mostly dominated by U.S. scholars. The fact that the U.S. has become the prime locus of production of Inter-American studies poses several problems, the most important of which is that the field betrays its own raison-d'etre. The field cannot be truly inter-American when most American countries are relegated to the position of object of study.  Sources  Earl E. Fitz.

She plays guitar and analogue synthesizers. Her music is strongly influenced by classic British psychedelic and progressive rock as well as space rock, but spans a wide range of genres, from folk rock to slow cosmic blues, to heavier guitar rock. It can at times be reminiscent of early 1970s Pink Floyd. Some of her music has been compared sonically to Hawkwind and other space rock groups, because of the use of electronic instruments. Her writing places much emphasis on meaningful, intellectual lyrics, in addition to creating interesting atmosphere and sonic textures, and showcasing musicianship through extended improvised jams. She produces her own music, working with various band line-ups and collaborators, and focuses on presenting each of her albums as a complete art form. She is known for her use of unusual production elements, homemade instruments, vintage synthesizers, including the EMS VCS 3, and analogue tape effects. In 2004, Cary released her first album, consisting mainly of singer-songwriter, acoustic, folk-rock, and Americana material. It was recorded in Nashville with local musicians, and Vince Gill made a guest appearance, playing mandolin on two tracks. She moved to the United Kingdom in 2005, to pursue a different musical direction. Since the move she has released three full-length albums and an EP. For her most recent album, Perpetual Motion, Graham Clark, appeared as a special guest for some extended improvisations. She has appeared on over a dozen releases by Fruits de Mer Records.

NPG claims In 2009, a letter sent by representatives of Britain's National Portrait Gallery stated that Derrick Coetzee had downloaded more than 3,300 high-resolution images from the gallery's database of images and had posted them for re-use on Wikimedia Commons. The NPG letter stated the claim that while the painted portraits may be old (and have thus fallen into the public domain), the high-quality photographic reproductions are recent works, and qualify as copyrighted works due to the amount of work it took to digitize and restore them, that the action of uploading the images infringed on both the NPG's database rights and copyrights, and that the images were obtained through the circumvention of technical measures used to prevent downloading of the prints. The NPG also stated that the public availability of the images would affect revenue acquired from licensing the images to third parties, revenue also used to fund the project of digitizing their collection, an effort that the NPG claims cost the organization over ¬£1,000,000. The NPG had requested a response from Coetzee by 20 July 2009, and requested that the images be removed from the site, but noted that the NPG was not considering any legal action against the Wikimedia Foundation. The NPG announced that Coetzee had responded via his legal representative by the requested deadline. Coetzee's legal representation was provided by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Coetzee publicly posted a copy of the legal letter from the NPG, indicating that he desired to \\"enable public discourse on the issue\\". On 17 July 2009, NPG gallery spokesperson, Eleanor Macnair, stated that \\"contact has now been made\\" with the Wikimedia Foundation and \\"we remain hopeful that a dialogue will be possible.\\" The NPG has stated that it would be willing to permit Wikipedia to use low-resolution images, and that it hoped to avoid taking any further legal action. The NPG had previously attempted to contact the Wikimedia Foundation in April 2009 regarding this issue, but did not receive an immediate response. The British Association of Picture Libraries and Agencies (BAPLA), an image industry trade group, expressed support for the gallery. In early 2010, an NPG spokesperson reported to Heise Open, a division of German publishing house Heinz Heise, \\"We had a constructive discussion in December and are now considering how best to come to an agreement.\\" In November 2010, Tom Morgan, Head of Rights and Reproductions at the National Portrait Gallery addressed a conference attended by both Wikipedians and representatives of cultural institutions. Morgan's presentation was entitled \\"Wikipedia and the National Portrait Gallery ‚Äì A bad first date? A perspective on the developing relationship between Wikipedia and cultural heritage organisations\\".Wikimedia UK blog post, \\"GLAM-WIKI Schedule Announced\\", 14 November 2010. Accessed 28 November 2010 Background The 1999 United States District Court case Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp. (in which Bridgeman Art Library sued the Corel Corporation for copyright infringement for distributing copies of digital reproductions of public domain paintings sourced from Bridgeman on a CD-ROM) established that \\"a photograph which is no more than a copy of a work of another as exact as science and technology permits lacks originality. That is not to say that such a feat is trivial, simply not original.\\" As a result, reproductions of works that have fallen into the public domain cannot attract any new copyright in the United States. As such, local policies of the Wikimedia Commons web site ignore any potential copyright that could subsist in reproductions of public domain works. However, British case law can take into account the amount of skill and labour that took place in the creation of a work for considering whether it can be copyrighted in that country. The letter from the National Portrait Gallery, however, demands that the case should be heard in the UK under UK law and not in the U.S. under U.S. law. The issue of jurisdiction is complicated as the National Portrait Gallery is located in England, but Wikimedia Commons, and the uploader, are both located within the United States. The letter also claims that by making the images freely available on Wikimedia Commons, Coetzee would also be liable under the British Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 for any copyright infringement committed by other users who download and use the images. Reaction=Response by the Wikimedia Foundation= Erik M√∂ller, deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation, made a statement on the issue, clarifying the stance of the Wikimedia Foundation on the incident. M√∂ller stated that although the NPG has agreed that the images are in the public domain, the NPG had contended that they own the exclusive rights to their reproductions of the images, using this to monetize their collection and assert control over public domain content. M√∂ller also stated \\"It is hard to see a plausible argument that excluding public domain content from a free, non-profit encyclopaedia serves any public interest whatsoever.\\" M√∂ller further described the agreement that other cultural institutions have made with Wikipedia to disseminate images: two German photographic archives donated 350,000 copyrighted images, and other institutions in the United States and the UK have made material available for use. The NPG stated that the images released by the German archives were medium resolution images, and that the NPG had offered to share images of the same quality. A reporter for the BBC stated that the NPG made a total of ¬£339,000 from licensing images for use in traditional publications in 2008. =Response by the EFF= Fred von Lohmann, an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) remarked that the situation comes down to asking whether US companies and citizens would be \\"bound by the most restrictive copyright law anywhere on the planet, or by U.S. law?\\" In a legal analysis, Lohmann contended that under US law, the NPG's \\"browse wrap\\" contract was not enforceable, database rights are not implemented at all, and that \\"using on public domain images doesn't get you a DMCA claim.\\" Lohmann also observed: Change in licensing In 2012, the National Portrait Gallery licensed 53,000 low-resolution images under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives license, making them available free of charge for non-commercial use. A further 87,000 high- resolution images are available for academic use under the Gallery's own license that invites donations in return; previously, the Gallery charged for high-resolution images. By 2012, 100,000 images, around a third of the Gallery's collection had been digitized. In November 2015, the United Kingdom's Intellectual Property Office clarified in an informational document that, based on the opinion of the European Court of Justice, \\"copyright can only subsist in subject matter that is original in the sense that it is the author's own 'intellectual creation'. Given this criterion, it seems unlikely that what is merely a retouched, digitised image of an older work can be considered as 'original'.\\" See also *Copyright law of the United Kingdom *Copyright law of the United States *Sweat of the brow *LICRA v.

It is also found in Turkish cuisine and is called eri≈üte in modern standard Turkish. The word itself is a nominalisation of the verb to cut or to slice, referring to the slicing of the dough involved in preparing the noodles. The term may refer to the noodles themselves, or the prepared dish made with them. Kesme is traditionally a homemade dish, and not often found at restaurants or caf√©s. In Turkey, kesme is known as \\"eri≈üte\\", and eaten generally in winter. It is made from flour, egg, water, salt and milk. These ingredients are worked into a dough, which is rolled out, cut, and dried in the sun or an oven after dried for a day.  Kesme preparation  The dough for kesme usually consists of flour, water, salt, and an egg. The dough is rolled out into a large thin circle, and left to dry for a while. It is then lightly floured, folded over several times accordion-style, and sliced into strips, which are then separated. The process has been illustrated, step by step.Turkish Egg Noodle / Eri≈üte The kesme may be boiled immediately in a broth often containing ingredients such as potatoes, meat, carrots, peppers, and tomatoes, or left to harden and stored. Kesme is often made in a kazan.  Reshteh  Reshteh () or reshte are Persian whole wheat noodles, traditionally the noodle would be a homemade item. The reshteh used in the Iranian cuisine can be a thicker, whole wheat noodle used in reshteh polow (rice and noodle pilaf dish) and in ash reshteh (noodle soup). \\"Reshteh\\" was the only word for noodles in Arab cookbooks of the 13th and 14th centuries. A recipe substitution for reshteh noodles, is often linguine or whole-wheat noodles. = Reshteh polow = Special symbolism is given to dishes that contain noodles when a decision of importance or change is to occur; the noodles or \\"reins\\" of one's life are to be taken in hand. A traditional dish in Iran is reshteh polow, which is served during the Persian new year with the noodles representing the threads of life and family intertwined. Noodles are used for special occasion dishes in giving thanks and for journeys especially to Mecca. In reshteh polow the noodles are broken into parts, fried or grilled brown, and then added to rice.

An admissions OSCE: the multiple mini-interview. Medical education, 38:314‚Äì326 (2004). is an interview format that uses many short independent assessments, typically in a timed circuit, to obtain an aggregate score of each candidate's soft skills. In 2001, the McMaster University Medical School began developing the MMI system, to address two widely recognized problems. First, it has been shown that traditional interview formats or simulations of educational situations do not accurately predict performance in medical school. Secondly, when a licensing or regulatory body reviews the performance of a physician subsequent to patient complaints, the most frequent issues of concern are those of the non-cognitive skills, such as interpersonal skills, professionalism and ethical/moral judgment. Since its formal introduction at McMaster University Medical School in 2004, it has been adopted by medical, dental, pharmacy, and veterinary schools around the world. Introduction Interviews have been used widely for different purposes, including assessment and recruitment. Candidate assessment is normally deemed successful when the scores generated by the measuring tool predict for future outcomes of interest, such as job performance or job retention. Meta-analysis of the human resource literature has demonstrated low to moderate ability of interviews to predict for future job performance. How well a candidate scores on one interview is only somewhat correlated with how well that candidate scores on the next interview. Marked shifts in scores are buffered when collecting many scores on the same candidate, with a greater buffering effect provided by multiple interviews than by multiple interviewers acting as a panel for one interview. The score assigned by an interviewer in the first few minutes of an interview is rarely changed significantly over the course of the rest of the interview, an effect known as the halo effect. Therefore, even very short interviews within an MMI format provide similar ability to differentiate reproducibly between candidates. Ability to reproducibly differentiate between candidates, also known as overall test reliability, is markedly higher for the MMI than for other interview formats. This has translated into higher predictive validity, correlating for future performance much more highly than standard interviews.Eva KW, Reiter HI, Trinh K, Wasi P, Rosenfeld J, Norman GR. \\"Predictive validity of the multiple mini-interview for selecting medical trainees. Accepted for publication January 2009 in Medical Education. History Aiming to enhance predictive correlations with future performance in medical school, post-graduate medical training, and future performance in practice, McMaster University began research and development of the MMI in 2001. The initial pilot was conducted on 18 graduate students volunteering as \\"medical school candidates\\". High overall test reliability (0.81) led to a larger study conducted in 2002 on real medical school candidates, many of whom volunteered after their standard interview to stay for the MMI. Overall test reliability remained high, and subsequent follow-up through medical school and on to national licensure examination (Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination Parts I and II) revealed the MMI to be the best predictor for subsequent clinical performance, professionalism, and ability to communicate with patients and successfully obtain national licensure. Since its formal inception at the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine at McMaster University in 2004, the MMI subsequently spread as an admissions test across medical schools, and to other healing arts disciplines. By 2008, the MMI was being used as an admissions test by the majority of medical schools in Canada, Australia, Israel, and Brunei. Also in 2008, a pilot test was conducted with the tool at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, and went live in the fall of that year, as the first implementation of MMI at a medical college in the United States; additional medical schools in the country have since adopted the process. Alt URL These lead to the development of a McMaster spin-off company, APT Inc., to commercialize the MMI system. The MMI was branded as ProFitHR and made available to both the academic and corporate sector. By 2009, the list of other disciplines using the MMI included schools for dentistry, pharmacy, midwifery, physiotherapy and occupational therapy, veterinary medicine, ultrasound technology, nuclear medicine technology, X-ray technology, medical laboratory technology, chiropody, dental hygiene, and postgraduate training programs in dentistry and medicine. MMI procedure # Interview stations ‚Äì the domain(s) being assessed at any one station are variable, and normally reflects the objectives of the selecting institution. Examples of domains include the \\"soft skills\\" ‚Äì ethics, professionalism, interpersonal relationships, ability to manage, communicate, collaborate, as well as perform a task. An MMI interview station takes considerable time and effort to produce; it is composed of several parts, including the stem question, probing questions for the interviewer, and a scoring sheet. # Circuit(s) of stations ‚Äì to reduce costs of the MMI significantly below that of most interviews,Rosenfeld J, Eva KW, Reiter HI, Trinh K. A Cost-Efficiency Comparison between the Multiple Mini-Interview and Panel-based Admissions Interviews. Advanced Health science Education Theory Pract. 2008 Mar;13(1):43‚Äì58 the interview \\"stations\\" are kept short (eight minutes or less) and are conducted simultaneously in a circuit as a bell-ringer examination. The preferred number of stations depends to some extent on the characteristics of the candidate group being interviewed, though nine interviews per candidate represents a reasonable minimum. The circuit of interview stations should be within sufficiently close quarters to allow candidates to move from interview room to interview room. Multiple parallel circuits can be run, each circuit with the same set of interview stations, depending upon physical plant limitations. # Interviewers ‚Äì one interviewer per interview station is sufficient. In a typical MMI, each interviewer stays in the same interview throughout, as candidates rotate through. The interviewer thus scores each candidate based upon the same interview scenario throughout the course of the test. # Candidates ‚Äì each candidate rotates through the circuit of interviews. For example, if each interview station is eight minutes, and there are nine interview stations, it will take the nine candidates being assessed on that circuit 72 minutes to complete the MMI. Each of the candidates begins at a different interview station, rotating to the next interview station at the ringing of the bell. # Administrators ‚Äì each circuit requires at least one administrator to ensure that the MMI is conducted fairly and on time. Utility of the MMI Test security breaches tend not to unduly influence results. While the creators of the test claim that sex of candidate and candidate status as under-represented minority tends not to unduly influence results, independent research has demonstrated that the MMI causes both gender and socioeconomic bias. Although some research have suggested that preparatory courses taken by the candidate tend not to unduly influence results, such research has not been duplicated and further research has to be done to make any scientifically sound argument for or against preparatory courses. Furthermore, such research must be designed to directly examine the efficacy of leading preparatory companies' courses rather than general evaluation. Although, it may be argued that all the validation so far has been done by McMaster and/or its affiliated company which constitute a conflict of interest and any result must be interpreted with caution. However, it is worth noting that MMI performance can be compromised by introversion.

He joined professional sumo in 2001 and was known as Musashiry≈´ Taishi until 2007. He made the top makuuchi division for the first time in 2009 and his highest rank was maegashira 2. He wrestled for Fujishima stable (formerly Musashigawa stable). He acquired Japanese citizenship in 2017 and retired shortly before the January 2018 tournament, to become an elder of the Japan Sumo Association under the name Kasugayama Oyakata. Early life and sumo background It has been reported that in his childhood in Ulan Bator he lived in the same apartment complex as future sumo contemporary M≈çkonami, though they never met in person. As an amateur, Dagdandorj took third place in the open weight division in the Junior World Sumo Championships in 2000. He began his professional career in March 2001, at the same time as Hakuh≈ç. He was given the shikona of Musashiry≈´, the prefix being a common one at Musashigawa stable. Career His rise through the ranks was relatively smooth until he reached the third highest makushita division in January 2003, where an early injury put him out of action and dropped him back to the sandanme division. He continued to struggle with his own sumo and injuries in these two divisions for the next five years, changing his shikona to Sh≈çtenr≈ç in 2007 in a bid to improve his fortunes. When he finally found his stride again, his steady rise to the top division was a stark contrast to his previous struggles; he reached makuuchi after winning two consecutive j≈´ry≈ç division championships, only the third post-war wrestler after Kushimaumi and Miyabiyama to achieve this feat. All in all, it had taken him 48 tournaments from his professional debut to reach the top makuuchi division, the third slowest at the time amongst foreign born wrestlers. In July 2009 he was awarded the Fighting Spirit Prize for his record of eleven wins and four losses. In the September tournament he won his first kinboshi, becoming the first maegashira in a year to defeat Hakuh≈ç, but could win only one other match. A 9-6 score in the following tournament in November seemed to steady him, but he suffered a surprising slump in January 2010 and a poor 3-12 record saw him demoted to j≈´ry≈ç. He returned to the top division for the July 2010 tournament, and after slipping back to j≈´ry≈ç in September won promotion again for November 2010. In 2011 he was one of several wrestlers investigated by the Sumo Association after his name was mentioned in a text message about match-fixing. The text, dating from May 2010, was sent by low ranker Enatsukasa, an alleged go-between, to j≈´ry≈ç wrestler Chiyohakuho and said, \\"the match with Shotenro is for real\\", implying that bouts with other wrestlers were being fixed. Sh≈çtenr≈ç vehemently denied any involvement in bout-rigging, and in April 2011 was found not guilty by the investigative panel. He missed the November 2011 tournament after undergoing surgery for appendicitis, dropping to the j≈´ry≈ç division in January. Despite only making a bare majority of eight wins at j≈´ry≈ç 5, this was enough for an immediate return to makuuchi. He had a superb start to the March tournament, winning nine of his first ten matches, but he faded in the home stretch, losing his last five bouts as he was matched against higher ranking opponents. He remained a middle ranking maegashira for several tournaments before finally being demoted to the second division for the March 2014 tournament. He was unable to return to makuuchi, and in September 2015 he lost his sekitori status and was demoted to the makushita division. A 4-3 record at the rank of Makushita #1 in January 2016 was enough to earn promotion back to j≈´ry≈ç for the March tournament in Osaka, but he pulled out of that tournament with only three wins and was demoted back to makushita. This was to be his last appearance in j≈´ry≈ç. Retirement from sumo He acquired Japanese citizenship on August 18, 2017 and took the naturalized Japanese name of Matsudaira Sh≈ç. Japanese citizenship is a requirement for staying in the Japan Sumo Association as an elder, and with 25 tournaments fought in the top division he was eligible to coach after his retirement from active competition. Sh≈çtenr≈ç sat out the July 2017 tournament, and was relegated to sandanme. It was disclosed on October 31 that he had been diagnosed with cancer during a health check-up prior to that tournament. At the meeting of the 70 sekitori held that day, all agreed to give Sh≈çtenr≈ç a cash donation as a mark of support. On December 28, 2017 Sh≈çtenr≈ç announced his retirement. He had spent 100 tournaments on the banzuke with a final career record of 494 wins against 484 losses, with a top division record of 164‚Äì196. He is staying in sumo as a coach under the elder name of Kasugayama Oyakata owned by Ikioi. In July 2019 he switched to the Kitajin elder name owned by Endo. Fighting style He was an oshi-sumo specialist, preferring pushing and thrusting techniques. He was however also capable of fighting on the mawashi or belt, where he preferred a migi-yotsu (left hand outside, right hand inside) grip. His most common winning move was oshi-dashi (push out), followed by yori-kiri (force out).

He is best remembered for his sea stories for boys, which combined adventure tales with moral instruction. The Story of Jack Halyard, the Sailor Boy (1824) was the most famous of these; others were Jack Halyard and Ishmael Bardus and Jack Lawrence, or the Adventures of a Cabin Boy. Cardell produced abundant fiction for younger readers, with titles like The Moral Monitor and The Orphans: an American Tale Addressed Chiefly to the Young. He was a significant figure in the evolution of American children's literature. In his own generation Cardell had a reputation as a grammarian and an educational reformer. He wrote Elements of English Grammar, Philosophical Grammar of the English Language, and The Analytical Spelling Book, among other titles. He was the founder of the short-lived American Academy of Language and Belles Lettres (1820-22). Cardell advocated a democratic approach to the English language as opposed to British traditionalism; his correspondents included James Madison and John Quincy Adams. Cardell was educated at Williams College. He was the only child of Apphia Hyde and Captain Samuel Cardell, the latter a ship's captain from New London who was lost at sea during action in the American Revolutionary War, on 13 January 1781. Apphia Hyde Cardell later remarried Benjamin Walworth and raised a second family. Reuben H.

It was the first exoplanet to be discovered orbiting a main-sequence star, the Sun-like 51 Pegasi, and marked a breakthrough in astronomical research. It is the prototype for a class of planets called hot Jupiters. In 2017, traces of water were discovered in the planet's atmosphere. In 2019, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded in part for the discovery of 51 Pegasi b. Name 51 Pegasi is the Flamsteed designation of the host star. The planet was originally designated 51 Pegasi b by Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz, who discovered the planet in December 1995. The following year it was unofficially dubbed \\"Bellerophon\\" by astronomer Geoffrey Marcy, who followed the convention of naming planets after Greek and Roman mythological figures (Bellerophon was a figure from Greek mythology who rode the winged horse Pegasus).University of California at Berkeley News Release 1996-17-01 In July 2014, the International Astronomical Union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars.NameExoWorlds: An IAU Worldwide Contest to Name Exoplanets and their Host Stars. IAU.org. 9 July 2014 The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names.NameExoWorlds The Process In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name for this planet was Dimidium.Final Results of NameExoWorlds Public Vote Released, International Astronomical Union, 15 December 2015. The name was submitted by the Astronomische Gesellschaft Luzern (), Switzerland. 'Dimidium' is Latin for 'half', referring to the planet's mass of at least half the mass of Jupiter.NameExoWorlds The Approved Names  Discovery  The location of 51 Pegasi in Pegasus The exoplanet's discovery was announced on October 6, 1995, by Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the University of Geneva in the journal Nature. They used the radial velocity method with the ELODIE spectrograph on the Observatoire de Haute-Provence telescope in France and made world headlines with their announcement. For this discovery, they were awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics. The planet was discovered using a sensitive spectroscope that could detect the slight and regular velocity changes in the star's spectral lines of around 70 metres per second. These changes are caused by the planet's gravitational effects from just 7 million kilometres' distance from the star. Within a week of the announcement, the planet was confirmed by another team using the Lick Observatory in California. This was the first discovery of an exoplanet orbiting a Sun-like star (the first exoplanet discovery was made by Aleksander Wolszczan in 1992, around pulsar PSR 1257). It marked a turning point and forced astronomers to accept that giant planets could exist in short-period orbits. Once astronomers realized that it was worth looking for giant planets with the currently available technology, much more telescope time was devoted to radial velocity planet searches, and hence many more exoplanets in the Sun's neighborhood were discovered. Physical characteristics After its discovery, many teams confirmed the planet's existence and obtained more observations of its properties. It was discovered that the planet orbits the star in around four days. It is much closer to it than Mercury is to the Sun, moves at an orbital speed of 136 km/s, yet has a minimum mass about half that of Jupiter (about 150 times that of the Earth). At the time, the presence of a huge world so close to its star was not compatible with theories of planet formation and was considered an anomaly. However, since then, numerous other 'hot Jupiters' have been discovered (such as 55 Cancri and œÑ Bo√∂tis), and astronomers are revising their theories of planet formation to account for them by studying orbital migration. Assuming the planet is perfectly grey with no greenhouse or tidal effects, and a Bond albedo of 0.1, the temperature would be 1265 K (approximately 1000 ¬∞C / 1800 ¬∞F). This is between the predicted temperatures of HD 189733 b and HD 209458 b (1180‚Äì1392 K), before they were measured. In the report of the discovery, it was initially speculated that 51 Pegasi b was the stripped core of a brown dwarf of a decomposed star and was therefore composed of heavy elements, but it is now believed to be a gas giant. It is sufficiently massive that its thick atmosphere is not blown away by the star's solar wind. 51 Pegasi b probably has a greater radius than that of Jupiter despite its lower mass. This is because its superheated atmosphere must be puffed up into a thick but tenuous layer surrounding it. Beneath this, the gases that make up the planet would be so hot that the planet would glow red. Clouds of silicates may exist in the atmosphere. The planet is tidally locked to its star, always presenting the same face to it. The planet (with Upsilon Andromedae b) was deemed a candidate for aperture polarimetry by Planetpol. It is also a candidate for \\"near- infrared characterisation.... with the VLTI Spectro-Imager\\". Direct detection of visible light The first ever direct detection of the visible light spectrum reflected from an exoplanet has been made by an international team of astronomers on 51 Pegasi b. The astronomers studied light from 51 Pegasi b using the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) instrument at the European Southern Observatory's La Silla Observatory in Chile.physicsworld.com 2015-04-22 First visible light detected directly from an exoplanet This detection allowed the inference of a true mass of 0.46 Jupiter masses.

Paraguayan Maria Casati was the first to join the religion in 1939 when living in Buenos Aires. The first pioneer to settle in Paraguay was Elizabeth Cheney early in 1940 and the first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly of Asunci√≥n was elected in 1944. By 1961 Paraguayan Bah√° º√≠s had elected the first National Spiritual Assembly and by 1963 there were 3 local assemblies plus other communities.The Bah√° º√≠ Faith: 1844-1963: Information Statistical and Comparative, Including the Achievements of the Ten Year International Bah√° º√≠ Teaching & Consolidation Plan 1953-1963, Compiled by Hands of the Cause Residing in the Holy Land, pages 15, 108 Recent estimates of Bah√° º√≠s mention 5500 or 10,600 though the state Census does not mention the Bah√° º√≠s.   ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s Tablets of the Divine Plan   ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. The sixth of the tablets was the first to mention Latin American regions and was written on April 8, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 -- after the end of World War I and the Spanish flu. The first actions on the part of Bah√° º√≠ community towards Latin America were that of a few individuals who made trips to Mexico and South America near or before this unavailing in 1919, including Mr. and Mrs. Frankland, and Roy C. Wilhelm, and Martha Root. Root's travels, perhaps the first Bah√° º√≠ to the region, began in the summer of 1919 - stopping first in Brazil then other countries before setting out to cross the Andes mountains into Chile in winter. The sixth tablet was translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on April 4, 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on December 12, 1919. > \\"His Holiness Christ says: Travel ye to the East and to the West of the > world and summon the people to the Kingdom of God. ‚Ä¶ Attach great importance > to the indigenous population of America ... the republics of the continent > of South America‚ÄîColombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, the Guianas, Bolivia, > Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Venezuela; also the islands to the > north, east and west of South America, such as Falkland Islands, the > Galapag√≤s, Juan Fernandez, Tobago and Trinidad....\\" Following the release of these tablets and then  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s death in 1921, a few Bah√° º√≠s began moving to or at least visiting Latin America. = Seven Year Plan and succeeding decades = Shoghi Effendi, head of the religion after the death of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, wrote a cable on May 1, 1936 to the Bah√° º√≠ Annual Convention of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s vision to begin. In his cable he wrote: > Appeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° > in Tablets of the Divine Plan. Urge earnest deliberation with incoming > National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of > Bah√° º√≠ Era drawing to a close.

Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. > Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in > American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace > the light of the Faith of Bah√° ºu'll√°h and establish structural basis of His > World Order. Following the May 1 cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on May 19 calling for permanent pioneers to be established in all the countries of Latin America. The Bah√° º√≠ National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. During the 1937 Bah√° º√≠ North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Bah√° º√≠s to go to Latin America as well as to include the completion of the outer structure of the Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois. In 1937 the First Seven Year Plan (1937‚Äì44), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Bah√° º√≠s the goal of establishing the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in every country in Latin America. With the spread of American Bah√° º√≠s in Latin American, Bah√° º√≠ communities and Local Spiritual Assemblies began to form in 1938 across the rest of Latin America. = Establishment = Paraguayan Maria Casati met some of these Bah√° º√≠s in Buenos Aires, Argentina and converted to the religion in 1939. The first pioneer to arrive in Paraguay was Elizabeth Cheney in December 1940\\\\. Cheney describes that many of the people she thought to be introduced to were in jail when she arrived. However through word-of-mouth from a few she was able to gather a group of 30 of social prominence and interested in universal peace which mentioned the religion and avoid negative connotations (for example by use of the word universal vs international when describing the kind of peace Bah√° º√≠s were interested in.) The group first met by January 1941 and a youth group was meeting by June despite social upset from the period before World War II and President Mor√≠nigo. Indeed, Cheney had rented her apartment from Sra. Leonar de Mor√≠nigo with whom she had shared Bah√° º√≠ principles to know what kind of meetings would take place - who in turn defended the religion from accusations by September from a local catholic priest. Cheney did not seek out publicity because of the social conflict going on and her experience of events in Argentina. She also emphasized sincerity, patience, and a universal quality of showing love for all people to encourage the same among the group and beware of showing any sense of superiority whether from nationalism or a self- consciousness in the role of bringing the religion to people. Come September 15 adults expressed interest in taking part in a further class on the religion. Cheney also began English language classes modeled after Lidia Zamenhof's advice as well use using stories about the religion as the medium for learning the language in addition to the meetings directly for those wanting to learn more about the religion. One member of the group attended an International Conference of Progressive Education by October in the States and through contact with the Cheney was invited to Louhelen Bah√° º√≠ School. But come November Cheney was taken ill and left Paraguay. On returning to the States she took up work in Race Amity meetings with Louis G. Gregory and Dorothy Beecher Baker and publishing. = Growth = Shoghi Effendi called for further strengthening of the community in 1943 The first to come back to Paraguay was Gertrude Eisenberg in spring 1943. The next pioneer to come was Virginia Orbison in September 1943 after helping to found an Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly in Chile. When Orbison arrived in addition to Eisenberg there was another Bah√° º√≠ of the group who had already acknowledged himself as a Bah√° º√≠ in the interim and two more of the original group converted at the first meeting Orbison attended in September. The first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly of Paraguay was elected in Asunci√≥n in 1944. An All-American Convention was held in 1944, and actor Don Roque Centuri√≥n Miranda, counted as the first Bah√° º√≠ of Paraguay, was a delegate, (and Cheney was able to visit the convention.) Cheney returned to Paraguay in 1945 to find a community of 26 Bah√° º√≠s and so she moved to Nicaragua in October Eisenberg moved in November. A regional committee overseeing pioneers was appointed in 1946 - one for Chili, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay together. The first South American Bah√° º√≠ Congress was celebrated in Buenos Aires in November, 1946 with representatives R. Centurion Miranda and Josephine Pla from Paraguay. = Reforming the Paraguayan community = Retrospectively, a stated purpose for the regional committee was to facilitate a shift in the balance of roles from North American guidance and Latin cooperation to Latin guidance and North American cooperation. The process was well underway by 1950 and was to be enforced about 1953. By 1950 there was still an assembly in Asunci√≥n. However, by November 1950 Sheila Rice-Wray transferred her pioneering effort to Paraguay in 1950 where an emergency election was held for vacancies to assure representation to the first South American Bah√° º√≠ Convention. Rice-Way was able to \\"reactivate\\" members of the Asunci√≥n community. She was also joined by Esteban Canales in November. Both Rice-Way and Canales were delegates to the South American convention to elect the regional assembly. When the regional National Assembly of South America was elected in 1951 the members included Paraguayan Esteban Canales. In 1953 translations of Bah√° º√≠ literature were made into Guarani. In August 1954 Ellen Sims arrived as another pioneer in Paraguay. In November 1955 the Bah√° º√≠s of Paraguay dedicated their permanent Bah√° º√≠ Headquarters with an hour-long program with talks in Guarani, Spanish and English, slides and pictures of Bah√° º√≠ building and Shrines around the world, and book displays.  Continued growth  The regional assembly was reorganized in 1957 to be made up of Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay & Bolivia. Among its members was Miranda of Paraguay 1958 saw the first Bah√° º√≠ summer school. The 1958 convention gathered twenty-four delegates in Asuncion from the five countries, including black, white, and Indian races as delegates as well as European and American pioneers. The elected members of the regional national assembly were Jose Mielnik, Athas Costas, Salvador Torma, Roberto Cazcarra, Roque Centurion Miranda, Else Cazcarra, Fabienne Guillon, Mary Binda, and Ellen Sims. 1958 also saw the purchase of the land to one day host the Bah√° º√≠ Temple of Paraguay. 1960 saw the election of the local assembly of Encarnaci√≥n. 1960 also saw the first visit of a Hand of the Cause, Dr. Hermann Grossmann. In 1961 each country of the regional assembly elected its own National Spiritual Assembly. Paraguay's national convention was witnessed by Hand of the Cause, Dr. Ramatu'llah Muhajir. At the convention Dr. Muhajir and the delegates drew up plans for reaching the Indian populations as well as ways to reinforce the communities that already existed. The members of Paraguay's first National Spiritual Assembly were Asadu'llah Akbari, Keihamosh Azampanah, A. Azampanah, Angelica E. deDoldc√°n, Rosa de Haterza, Luis Van Strate, Rezsi Sunshine, Anibal Torres, Francisco Haterza. By 1963 there were Local Spiritual Assemblies in Asunci√≥n, Concepci√≥n, and Encarnaci√≥n as well as a smaller group in Pedro Juan Caballero and members of the community also included some of the Cayg√ºa (Kadiweu?) people. The first Native American Bah√° º√≠ of Paraguay, Rosendo Segundo, joined the religion in 1964. Segundo was a member of a Guarani tribe, the Chaco . In 1965 actual contact with the Chaco tribe began. In 1966 a Paraguayan pioneer reached a goal location - Ushuaia. By 1968 there were 8 local assemblies and in 1969 members of the Chulupi speaking and Lengua tribes had converted to the religion and first all-Indian institute in northern Gran Chaco area, in Paraguay with members of the Guarani, Guasurango, (a Tapiet√© speaking) and Chulupi attending. In 1970 the first Yanaigua (another Tapiet√© speaking) tribe member joined the religion and that year was first time an indigenous Bah√° º√≠ was elected to the national assembly, (in 1982 there were three indigenous members of the national assembly.) And in 1977 a radio campaign began.  Modern community  As recently as 1980 there have been pioneers to Paraguay.Kim and Richard Cook Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. In 1980 the Paraguayan community established 4 training schools (1 was already functioning) in rural areas. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bah√° º√≠s were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bah√° º√≠ teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bah√° º√≠ socio-economic development projects. In 1986 the Bah√° º√≠s established an agricultural training program with seeds, tools and training. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. Some more recent events Bah√° º√≠s in Paraguay have undertaken include participating in international surveys from 1983 inquiring about activities organized during the United Nations Decade for Women to achieve equality of rights, privileges, and responsibilities for both sexes, as well as to report on obstacles that these communities had faced  responses from Paraguay noted women participated \\"without restriction in consultation and decision-making\\" in the local and national administrative functions of the Bah√° º√≠ community where \\"women both vote and are elected.\\" Then the community hosted the first International Women's Conference of Paraguay in July 1988 with over 100 in attendance. During this period, Bah√° º√≠s also had children's classes underway. In 1999 Jose Luis Gadea became a member of the International Environment Forum. A series of large youth gatherings were undertaken in 2000 throughout the Americas, beginning in Paraguay in January with a focus to galvanize the youth to address protracted social conflicts such as race and class prejudice, corruption, violence, poverty, and social injustice afflicting their countries. In 2002 former member of the Universal House of Justice David Hofman visited the Paraguayan Bah√° º√≠s and noted a possible role for the Bah√° º√≠ Training Institutes. Eighty five Bah√° º√≠s from Paraguay including Marcos Galeano of Asuncion and Romina P.C. Torres were among those attending the regional conference called for by the Universal House of Justice in 2008 held in S√£o Paulo. = Demographics = Though various agencies report the size of the community numbers in the thousands, the state census does not count it. The community was noticed on US. Department of State records. The 2001 Association of Religion Data Archives review showed some 10,600 Bah√° º√≠s. Operation World estimated some 5,500 and also suggest a rate of growth second only to Islam, and having numbers about twice those of Islam.

Buffett Foundation, FAO, ACDI/VOCA, TechnoServe and others. Launched in September 2008 as a five-year pilot, P4P sought to explore programming and procurement modalities with the greatest potential to stimulate agricultural and market development in ways that maximized benefits to smallholder farmers.Sheeran, J., ‚ÄúHow to End Hunger‚Äù, the Washington Quarterly, April 2010. The program, largely developed by the eleventh Executive Director of the WFP, Josette Sheeran, arose as the WFP desired to purchase food in a way that was part of the ‚Äúsolution to hunger.‚Äù\\"Can African Farms Learn to Thrive?\\", Bloomberg Businessweek, August 2011 These efforts are aligned with recommendations issued by the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights that call for an establishment of programs in support of socially vulnerable groups.Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural rights, General Comment No.12: The Right to Adequate Food and to the Zero Hunger Challenge launched by the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. Special UN Reporter 2012-2014, Olivier De Schutter, claimed that public procurement systems favour economically-strong bidders, thus excluding smallholder farmers.p.8, De Schutter, O., \\"The Power of Procurement: Public Purchasing in the Service of Realizing the Right to Food\\", Briefing Note 08, Apr. 2014 His conclusion was that public procurement schemes supportive of smallholders could have \\"powerful impacts on the reduction of rural poverty.\\"p.3, De Schutter, O., \\"The Power of Procurement: Public Purchasing in the Service of Realizing the Right to Food\\", Briefing Note 08, Apr. 2014 P4P is built upon this very principle as it enables low-income farmers to supply food to the WFP's operations. Eventually the transaction can be regulated by a forward contract, with the farmer agreeing in selling in the future (up to three years) a certain amount of output at a fixed price. Essentially, the P4P program aims to create a wide and sophisticate market for commodities in developing countries. According to WFP, the initiative, which has been piloted in 20 countries,http://www.wfp.org/purchase-progress/where-we-work aimed to help hundreds of thousands of poor farmers to \\"gain access to reliable markets to sell their surplus crops at competitive prices\\".World Food Programme Web Site - The WFP Homepage Beyond the farmers gaining access to the market, the program aimed to help them reduce their risk, leverage credit to expand production and to diversify crops.\\"‚ÄúP4P and Gender: Literature Review and Fieldwork Report‚Äù The stated goal of the program was ‚Äúto facilitate increased agricultural production and sustained market engagement and thus increase incomes and livelihoods for participating smallholder/low income farmers, the majority of whom are women‚Äù.\\"‚ÄúP4P and Gender: Literature Review and Fieldwork Report‚Äù Quantifying this goal, the WFP sought to work with at least 500,000 smallholder farmers and increase their income by $50 a year by the end of the program initiative. By December 2014, P4P supported over a million farmers and trained over half a million individuals. WFP's 2014-2017 Strategic Plan states that it will continue increasing the amount of food it buys from smallholder farmers, while working with governments and other buyers to assist smallholder farmers to access lucrative markets.\\"WFP 2014-2017 Strategic Plan\\" Procurement Through P4P, WFP tested different ways of procuring staple foods (primarily cereals and pulses) from smallholder farmers, aiming to identify models that could sustainably promote smallholder agricultural development and access to public and private sector markets. WFP‚Äôs procurement from smallholders and small/medium traders (the demand pillar) was intended to provide the inducement and motivation for action around the P4P development hypothesis. WFP designed the new P4P procurement modalities specifically to deal with the difficulties that smallholder farmers face in selling to WFP. The P4P procurement modalities fell into four general categories: (1) prosmallholder competitive tendering; (2) direct contracting; (3) forward contracting; and (4) processing options. P4P tested not only different contract types but also different mechanisms for aggregation. In addition to farmers organizations, P4P also worked with small and medium scale traders and structured trading platforms such as warehouse receipt systems and commodity exchanges, along with linking farmers to processors. WFP itself also bought processed food such as highenergy biscuits (HEBs) and fortified flour from processors using raw materials sourced from P4P-supported organizations.‚ÄúP4P Primer, published 2011‚Äù The basic challenge facing WFP under P4P was to shape and manage a process that involved creating extra demand for staple food crops produced by smallholder farmers, reaching an appropriate level of supply adapted to that demand, and ensuring that benefits accrued to the smallholder farmers. WFP succeeded in procuring over 367,000 metric tons (mt) of food over the five-year pilot, putting more than US$148 million more directly into the hands of smallholder farmers (US$30 million/year on average). Further, farmer organizations not previously selling collectively sold another US$60 million worth of quality food to buyers beyond WFP. Almost all P4P contracts were below import parity prices, therefore respecting WFP‚Äôs principle of ‚Äúcost- efficient procurement‚Äù and realizing cost savings relative to importation. Compared to import parity, total savings over the course of the five years exceeded US$40 million. These outcomes hinged on several important investments. Novel partnerships and platforms was a necessity, along with a range of new products and services. In many important ways, therefore, WFP and its partners ventured into virgin territory under P4P. A core principal guiding the thoughts of the original designers was that the pilot‚Äôs ‚Äúfailures‚Äù would yield learnings and lessons at least as important as its ‚Äúsuccesses.‚Äù The charge to WFP was to think outside the box, innovate, and evolve, knowing that not everything attempted would work. This report provides a comprehensive view of key aspects of that experimentation and learning process, detailing the extraordinarily wide array of opportunities generated by the P4P approach, along with the correspondingly deep set of challenges addressed.‚ÄúReflections on the Pilot, published 2015‚Äù Partnerships In order to provide a wide set of services and support to the smallholder farmers, P4P relied on expertise and collaboration of numerous partners. P4P strengthened supply-side partnerships to help smallholders produce surplus crops by providing them with access to agricultural inputs, skills and equipment, as well as machinery and storage to prevent post-harvest losses.http://www.wfp.org/sites/default/files/the%20P4P%20Story%20-%20Connecting%20Farmers%20to%20Markets%2C%20Feb%202015.pdf Various NGOs, private sector companies, academic institutions, other UN agencies such as IFAD and FAO all proved to be invaluable backers. In fact, IFAD and FAO were the key partners, with FAO facilitating smallholders' access to agricultural market and training on farming practices and storage, while IFAD supported representatives from farmers' organizations and partners in their negotiations with financial institutions.http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3976e.pdf Other partners such as UNDP, UN Women, UNOPS and ILO allowed P4P to broaden its scope of action and tackle multifarious challenges faced by smallholder farmers.http://www.wfp.org/sites/default/files/the%20P4P%20Story%20-%20Connecting%20Farmers%20to%20Markets%2C%20Feb%202015.pdf Demand-side partners , including WFP, were crucial for the support smallholder farmers needed in order to produce crops that meet international quality standards used by WFP and other large buyers, as well as to aid them to aggregate their crops. WFP, NGos, microfinance institutions, banks, input suppliers and private sector companies also helped farmers gain knowledge on financial services and market in general, so as to access credit and understand the importance and risks of agricultural investment and negotiations,p.11 http://www.wfp.org/sites/default/files/the%20P4P%20Story%20-%20Connecting%20Farmers%20to%20Markets%2C%20Feb%202015.pdf Investment in agricultural inputs was facilitated by P4P efforts to improve smallholders' access to credit, as smallholder farmers used their WFP food supply contracts as a collateral for loans.p.39 http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3976e.pdf Programme's sustainability was further strengthened by government engagement in the 20 pilot countries. P4P experience proved valuable as tools governments need to support smallholder farmers. Government of Rwanda was the first one to adopt a national P4P programme, called Common P4P (CP4P), implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources (MINAGRI). The programme entails buying 40% if the National Strategic Grain Reserve supply from farmers' organizations whose members are smallholders. P4P was helpful in the government's design of the project and the mobilization of partners who trained participating farmers. Other governments followed the lead and representatives of Burkina Faso, Ghana and Kenya engaged with Rwandan government so as to learn how they can adopt similar initiatives.p.38 http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3976e.pdf Following this exchange of information in 2012, SONAGESS, the national food reserve agency of Burkina Faso, committed to purchasing 30% of its needs from smallholder farmers' organizations.p.26 http://www.wfp.org/sites/default/files/the%20P4P%20Story%20-%20Connecting%20Farmers%20to%20Markets%2C%20Feb%202015.pdf In Tanzania, WFP agreed to buy directly from the Government's National Food Reserve Agency (NFRA), which, in turn, promised to buy a portion of its supply from smallholder farmers. Latin American pilot countries have all capitulated upon the work of P4P; the government of El Salvador has implemented P4P lessons into its Family Agriculture Plan,http://www.mag.gob.sv/index.php?option=com_phocadownload&view;=category&id;=4&Itemid;=93 the Government of Guatemala has created the Triangle of Dignity program inspired by P4P, whose concept was also implemented in the National Food and Security Strategy (2010-2022)http://www.gafspfund.org/sites/gafspfund.org/files/Documents/5.%20Honduras_strategy.pdf of Honduras. National Grain Reserve of Nicaragua also started buying food from P4P-supported farmers' organizationsp.27 http://www.wfp.org/sites/default/files/the%20P4P%20Story%20-%20Connecting%20Farmers%20to%20Markets%2C%20Feb%202015.pdf Important initiatives such as the School Feeding Programmehttp://www.wfp.org/school-meals implemented by governments with WFP support also provided opportunities for smallholder farmers, whose crops were used for the school meals. By combining the two initiatives, WFP multiplied the benefits, thus increasing school enrollment, fighting undernutrition, developing government capacity, bolstering local economy and financial opportunities of smallholder farmers. Women farmers are also favoured by this initiative, as Home Grown School Feedinghttps://www.wfp.org/content/home- grown-school-feeding targeted crops usually produced by women.p.29 http://www.wfp.org/sites/default/files/the%20P4P%20Story%20-%20Connecting%20Farmers%20to%20Markets%2C%20Feb%202015.pdf HGSFhttps://www.wfp.org/content/home-grown-school-feeding programme also helped connect P4P-supported farmers and initiatives such as Purchase from Africans for Africa (PAA),http://paa-africa.org/about/paa-brazils-food- purchase-programme/ inspired by Brazil's national Food Purchase Programme. Implemented in Ethiopia, Malawi and Mozambique, P4P-supported farmers sold their fresh and staple crops to HGSF programmehttp://www.wfp.org/sites/default/files/the%20P4P%20Story%20-%20Connecting%20Farmers%20to%20Markets%2C%20Feb%202015.pdf Gender Strategy and Lessons Learned As women play a significant role in worldwide agricultural production, yet meanwhile compromise the majority of those experiencing hunger, WFP has created a specific gender strategy for P4P.‚ÄúP4P and Gender: Literature Review and Fieldwork Report‚Äù After conducting a study addressing the challenges to incorporating more women into the program, P4P has outlined the following objectives for their gender strategy: * ‚ÄúIncreasing the understanding of the importance of gender relations based on equity, within beneficiaries‚Äô households, Farmer Organizations and supply side partners.‚Äù * ‚ÄúIncreasing and creating opportunities for women to participate in groups and decision making.‚Äù * ‚ÄúFacilitating and increasing the ability of rural women to access, control and manage resources and agricultural services.‚Äù * ‚ÄúDiversifying opportunities for women in income-generating agro- activities.‚Äù‚ÄúP4P Global Gender Strategy‚Äù P4P recently released a paper on how the pilot contributed to women‚Äôs empowerment,P4P‚Äôs Women‚Äôs Empowerment Pathways: Roadblocks and Successes http://documents.wfp.org/stellent/groups/public/documents/special_initiatives/wfp265434.pdf detailing the P4P pilot's lessons learned in terms of what works and what doesn't when it comes to gender equity and empowerment of women farmers. The paper found to best work with women farmers, the initiative needed to utilize context-specific action plans, specific strategies to target women farmers, equipment and capacity development, ensure the inclusion of men, carry out risk-awareness and use a household negotiation approach.https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals- network/2014/jun/12/women-farmers-world-food-programme Furthermore, the report concludes that assessment of gender achievements must go beyond counting the number of women vs men involved. Nuanced examinations will inform new methods to more effectively facilitate the empowerment of women farmers. One such lesson learned stated by the World Food Programme was the importance of emphasising the procurement of traditional \\"women's crops\\", such as ni√©b√©, in order to increase women's participation to sales.\\"Purchase fopr Progress (P4P) factsheet on gender lessons learned (pdf)\\" P4P gender-focused efforts were also praised by Ritu Sharma, who found them to be conscious of diverse context in which women farmers liveSharma, Ritu (2014). \\"Teach a Woman How to Fish\\", p.137. St. Martin's Press, London. . She also extolled P4P for dedicating focused resources and strategies to improving women's awareness of their own rights, dynamics of various types of domestic violence, as well as training them on the most successful agricultural methods.Sharma, Ritu (2014). \\"Teach a Woman How to Fish\\", p.137. St. Martin's Press, London. . Criticism Following an independent mid-term evaluation in 2010, a comprehensive final evaluation of the pilot was completed in November 2014, seeking to ascertain the extent to which best practices were identified and shared, and the extent to which these practices led to increased income and sustained market engagement for farmers. The evaluation also considered the extent to which WFP‚Äôs purchasing approach was transformed to support sustainable small scale procurement. And finally, the evaluation assessed how the pilot initiative‚Äôs multi-level organizational framework and the systems put in place to support the implementation contributed to the results achieved, intended and unintended. The evaluation was rigorous and comprehensive, yielding results that will be important to both WFP and the wider external network of stakeholders with direct and indirect interest in smallholder engagement in staple food markets.\\"Purchase for Progress (P4P) strategic evaluation Terms of Reference (pdf)\\" Overall, the independent evaluation \\"Purchase for Progress (P4P) strategic final evaluation - document collection\\" concluded that P4P was highly relevant to WFP and the international agenda on agriculture-led food security and poverty reduction, and to partner countries‚Äô national policy objectives. P4P provided some measurable improvement in the capacity of farmer organisations and had important benefits in how WFP is viewed as a development partner by host governments. It contributed to increased corporate commitment by WFP to support FOs and small-scale production, and has led to significant levels of procurement from FOs taking place through P4P approaches. At FO level increased sales to buyers beyond WFP were observed in almost all countries where data were available. P4P benefited from very strong support from WFP management at the highest level and from the adaptation of internal systems and processes to facilitate implementation. The P4P evaluation also found that there was insufficient attention given at the design phase to the differentiation in farmers' groups (specifically smallholders farming less than 2 ha of land versus those with 2-5 ha or more), and to the full articulation of the theory of change and underlying assumptions. Impact assessments were conducted in 3 countries (El Salvador, Ethiopia and Tanzania).\\"P4P Impact Assessments\\" There was evidence of increased yields in El Salvador directly attributable to P4P, and of improved marketing capacity of farmers organizations in all 3 countries. Because of the lower than anticipated starting capacity of the FOs, the amount of capacity development improvement has been less, and has taken longer to achieve, than was envisaged. Critics of the P4P initiative stress that massive commodity market speculations are responsible for increasing the world food prices.Kaufman, F., \\"Let them Eat Cash: Can Bill Gates Turn Hunger into Profit?\\", Harper Magazine, June 2009 This criticism is based on the idea that WFP purchases from smallholders would drive the global food price up, yet a study conducted by academics from Michigan State University states that WFP had no negative impact on local nor regional markets and that it effectively facilitated smallholders' access to markets.http://fsg.afre.msu.edu/papers/idwp134.pdf Anticipated Transition Olivier De Schutter finds that the way forward for P4P is the \\"up or out\\" strategy where farmers' organizations showing significant progress are eventually capable of producing and marketing their crops to buyers on their own and those who do not are simply dropped.p.9, De Schutter, O., \\"The Power of Procurement: Public Purchasing in the Service of Realizing the Right to Food\\", Briefing Note 08, Apr. 2014 P4P plans on linking pro-smallholder efforts to WFP programmes and operations, mainly the school feeding, nutritio-sensitive agriculture and resilience programming.p.61 http://www.wfp.org/sites/default/files/the%20P4P%20Story%20-%20Connecting%20Farmers%20to%20Markets%2C%20Feb%202015.pdf Also, P4P is committed to work towards the empowerment of women, both in financial and social sense and towards awareness raising on benefits gender equality offers to agricultural communities. Finally, P4P is producing guidance, lessons and insights based on the pilot in order to offer WFP staff, governments, and other organizations, tools to support smallholders and work towards their development.http://www.wfp.org/sites/default/files/the%20P4P%20Story%20-%20Connecting%20Farmers%20to%20Markets%2C%20Feb%202015.pdf External links *Purchase for Progress home page =References= World Food Programme ","title":"Purchase for Progress"},{"id":"23768735","text":"Amano Hachir≈ç, founder of the Sh≈çgitai Duel between a Sh≈çgitai (left) and a Shaguma-wearing Jinshotai (ËøÖË°ùÈöä) (right) in the Battle of Ueno Funeral monument to the Sh≈çgitai in Ueno Park, erected by former Sh≈çgitai warrior Ogawa Okisato in 1874 The Sh≈çgitai (, \\"Manifest Righteousness Regiment\\") was an elite samurai shock infantry formation of the Tokugawa shogunate military formed in 1868 by the hatamoto and Hitotsubashi Gosanky≈ç retainer in Z≈çshigaya, Edo (now Tokyo).

He was \\"the greatest hero and slayer of monsters, alongside Cadmus and Perseus, before the days of Heracles\\",Kerenyi 1959, p. 75. and his greatest feat was killing the Chimera, a monster that Homer depicted with a lion's head, a goat's body, and a serpent's tail: \\"her breath came out in terrible blasts of burning flame.\\"Iliad vi.155‚Äì203.

However, Geoffrey Kirk says that \\"ŒíŒµŒªŒªŒµœÅŒøœÜœåŒΩœÑŒ∑œÇ means 'slayer of Belleros.Kirk 1990, p. 178 Belleros could have been a Lycian, a local daimon or a Corinthian nobleman‚ÄîBellerophon's name \\"clearly invited all sorts of speculation\\".  Family  Bellerophon was born in Corinth and was the son of the mortal Eurynome by either her husband, Glaucus, or Poseidon. He was the brother of Deliades (also called Peiren or Alcimenes). Bellerophon was the father of Isander (Peisander),Strabo, Geographica 12.8.5 & 13.4.16 Hippolochus, and Laodamia by Philonoe, daughter of King Iobates of Lycia. Philonoe was also known under several other names: Alkimedousa,Scholia on Homer, Iliad 6.192 Anticleia,Scholia on Pindar, Olympian Ode 13. 61 Pasandra or Cassandra.Scholia on Homer, Iliad 6.155 In some accounts, Bellerophon also fathered Hydissos by Asteria, daughter of Hydeus.Stephanus of Byzantium, s. v. Hydissos Mythology Veroli Casket panel detail showing Bellerophon with Pegasus, dating from 900‚Äì1000 AD. The Iliad vi.155‚Äì203 contains an embedded narrative told by Bellerophon's grandson Glaucus, named after his great-grandfather, which recounts Bellerophon's myth. Bellerophon's father was Glaucus,By some accounts, Bellerophon's father was really Poseidon. Kerenyi 1959 p. 78 suggests that \\"sea-green\\" Glaucus is a double for Poseidon, god of the sea, who looms behind many of the elements in Bellerophon's myth, not least as the sire of Pegasus and of Chrysaor, but also as the protector of Bellerophon. who was the king of Corinth and the son of Sisyphus. Bellerophon's grandsons Sarpedon and the younger Glaucus fought in the Trojan War. In the Epitome of pseudo-Apollodorus, a genealogy is given for Chrysaor (\\"of the golden sword\\") that would make him a double of Bellerophon; he too is sometimes called the son of Glaucus (son of Sisyphus). Chrysaor has no myth save that of his birth: from the severed neck of Medusa, who was with child by Poseidon, he and Pegasus both sprang at the moment of her death. \\"From this moment we hear no more of Chrysaor, the rest of the tale concerning the stallion only ... [who visits the spring of Pirene] perhaps also for his brother's sake, by whom in the end he let himself be caught, the immortal horse by his mortal brother.\\"Kerenyi 1959 p. 80. = Exile in Argos = Bellerophon riding Pegasus (1914) Bellerophon's brave journey began in the familiar way,See Joseph Campbell, The Hero with a Thousand Faces, chapter 1, \\"Separation\\". with an exile: he had murdered either his brother, whose name is usually given as Deliades, Peiren or even Alcimenes, or killed a shadowy \\"enemy\\", a \\"Belleros\\"The suggestion, made by Kerenyi and others, makes the name \\"Bellerophontes\\" the \\"killer of Belleros\\", just as Hermes Argeiphontes is \\"Hermes the killer of Argus\\". , makes a carefully argued case for Bellerophontes as the \\"bane-slayer\\" of the \\"bane to mankind\\" in Iliad II.329, derived from a rare Greek word Œ≠ŒªŒªŒµœÅŒøŒΩ, explained by the grammarians as Œ∫Œ±Œ∫œåŒΩ, \\"evil\\". This Œ≠ŒªŒªŒµœÅŒøŒΩ is connected by with a Hesychius gloss ŒµŒªœÖŒµœÇ \\"water animal\\", and an Indo-European word for \\"snake\\", or \\"dragon\\", cognate to English eel, also found in Hittite Illuyanka, which would make Bellerophon the dragon slayer of Indo-European myth, represented by Indra slaying Vrtra in Indo-Aryan, and by Thor slaying the Midgard Serpent in Germanic. Robert Graves in The Greek Myths rev. ed. 1960 suggested a translation \\"bearing darts\\". or \\"Belleron\\", a ruler of the Corinthians (though the details are never directly told), and in expiation of his crime arrived as a suppliant to Proetus, king in Tiryns, one of the Mycenaean strongholds of the Argolid. Proetus, by virtue of his kingship, cleansed Bellerophon of his crime. The wife of the king, whether named AnteiaIn Iliad vi. or Stheneboea,Euripides' tragedies Stheneboia and Bellerophontes are lost. took a fancy to him, but when he rejected her, she accused Bellerophon of attempting to ravish her.This mytheme is most familiar in the narrative of Joseph and Potiphar's wife. Robert Graves also notes the parallel in the Egyptian Tale of Two Brothers and in the desire of Athamas' wife for Phrixus (Graves 1960, 70.2, 75.1). Proetus dared not satisfy his anger by killing a guest (who is protected by xenia), so he sent Bellerophon to King Iobates his father-in-law, in the plain of the River Xanthus in Lycia, bearing a sealed message in a folded tablet: \\"Pray remove the bearer from this world: he attempted to violate my wife, your daughter.\\"The tablets \\"on which he had traced a number of devices with a deadly meaning\\" constitute the only apparent reference to writing in the Iliad. Such a letter is termed a \\"bellerophontic\\" letter; one such figures in a subplot of Shakespeare's Hamlet, bringing offstage death to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Such a letter figures in the earlier story of Sargon of Akkad. Before opening the tablets, Iobates feasted with Bellerophon for nine days. On reading the tablet's message Iobates too feared the wrath of the Erinyes if he murdered a guest; so he sent Bellerophon on a mission that he deemed impossible: to kill the Chimera, living in neighboring Caria. The Chimera was a fire-breathing monster consisting of the body of a goat, the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent. This monster had terrorized the nearby countryside. On his way he encountered the famous Corinthian seer Polyeidos, who gave him advice about his oncoming battle. =Capturing Pegasus= Polyeidos told Bellerophon that he would have need of Pegasus. To obtain the services of the untamed winged horse, Polyeidos told Bellerophon to sleep in the temple of Athena. While Bellerophon slept, he dreamed that Athena set a golden bridle beside him, saying \\"Sleepest thou, prince of the house of Aiolos? Come, take this charm for the steed and show it to the Tamer thy father as thou makest sacrifice to him of a white bull.\\"Kerenyi 1959, quoting Apollodorus Mythographus, 2.7.4. It was there when he awoke. Bellerophon had to approach Pegasus while it drank from a well; Polyeidos told him which well ‚Äîthe never- failing Pirene on the citadel of Corinth, the city of Bellerophon's birth. Other accounts say that Athena brought Pegasus already tamed and bridled, or that Poseidon the horse-tamer, secretly the father of Bellerophon, brought Pegasus, as Pausanias understood.Description of Greece 2.4.6. Bellerophon mounted his steed and flew off to where the Chimera was said to dwell. =The slaying of the Chimera= Chimera in Lycia (modern-day Turkey) where the Chimera myth takes place. When he arrived in Lycia, the Chimera was truly ferocious, and he could not harm the monster even while riding on Pegasus. He felt the heat of the breath the Chimera expelled, and was struck with an idea. He got a large block of lead and mounted it on his spear. Then he flew head-on towards the Chimera, holding out the spear as far as he could. Before he broke off his attack, he managed to lodge the block of lead inside the Chimera's throat. The beast's fire-breath melted the lead, and blocked its air passage.Some of the red-figure pottery painters show Bellerophon wielding Poseidon's trident instead (Kerenyi 1959). The Chimera suffocated, and Bellerophon returned victorious to King Iobates.Hesiod, Theogony 319ff; Bibliotheke, ii.3.2; Pindar, Olympian Odes, xiii.63ff; Pausanias, ii.4.1; Hyginus, Fabulae, 157; John Tzetzes, On Lycophron. Iobates, on Bellerophon's return, was unwilling to credit his story. A series of daunting further quests ensued: he was sent against the warlike Solymi and then against the Amazons who fought like men, whom Bellerophon vanquished by dropping boulders from his winged horse; when he was sent against a Carian pirate, Cheirmarrhus, an ambush failed, when Bellerophon killed all sent to assassinate him; the palace guards were sent against him, but Bellerophon called upon Poseidon, who flooded the plain of Xanthus behind Bellerophon as he approached. In defense the palace women sent him and the flood in retreat by rushing from the gates with their robes lifted high, offering themselves, to which the modest hero replied by withdrawing.Robert Graves, 75.d; Plutarch, On the Virtues of Women. Iobates relented, produced the letter, and allowed Bellerophon to marry his daughter Philonoe, the younger sister of Anteia, and shared with him half his kingdom,The inheritance of kingship through the king's daughter, with many heroic instances, was discussed by ; compare Orion and Merope. with fine vineyards and grain fields. The lady Philonoe bore him Isander (Peisander),Isander was struck down by Ares in battle with the Solymi (Iliad xvi). Hippolochus and Laodamia, who lay with Zeus the Counselor and bore Sarpedon but was slain by Artemis.Homer, Iliad, 6. 197‚Äì205Diodorus Siculus refers to her as Deidamia and makes her wife of Evander, son of Sarpedon the elder and by her father of Sarpedon the younger. Library of History, 5. 79. 3 = Flight to Olympus and fall = As Bellerophon's fame grew, so did his arrogance. Bellerophon felt that because of his victory over the Chimera, he deserved to fly to Mount Olympus, the home of the gods. However, this act of hubris angered Zeus and he sent a gadfly to sting the horse, causing Bellerophon to fall off the horse and back to Earth. Pegasus completed the flight to Olympus where Zeus used him as a pack horse for his thunderbolts.Parallels are in the myths of Icarus and Phaeton. On the Plain of Aleion (\\"Wandering\\") in Cilicia, Bellerophon (who had fallen into a thorn bush causing him to become blind) lived out his life in misery, \\"devouring his own soul,\\" until he died.Pindar, Olympian Odes, xiii.87‚Äì90, and Isthmian Odes, vii.44; Bibliotheke ii.3.2; Homer, Iliad vi.155‚Äì203 and xvi.328; Ovid, Metamorphoses ix.646. Euripides' Bellerophon Enough fragments of Euripides' lost tragedy, Bellerophon, remain embedded as some thirty quotations in surviving texts to give scholars a basis for assessing its theme: the tragic outcome of his attempt to storm Olympus on Pegasus. An outspoken passage‚Äîin which Bellerophon seems to doubt the gods' existence from the contrast between the wicked and impious, who live lives of ease, with the privations suffered by the good‚Äîis apparently the basis for Aristophanes' imputation of \\"atheism\\" to the poet. Perseus on Pegasus The replacement of Bellerophon by the more familiar culture hero Perseus was a development of Classical times that was standardized during the Middle Ages and has been adopted by the European poets of the Renaissance and later.

County career Lightfoot joined Northamptonshire in 1953, and was awarded his county cap in 1961. He also made First-Class appearances for the Combined Services (in 1955), TN Pearce's XI (1962), a 'Players' team (1962 also), and AER Gilligan's XI (1963). He played 294 First-class matches and also 31 One-Day matches from 1963 up until his retirement, a format he never quite adapted to with bat or ball. Lightfoot bowled for the last time in 1968, before retiring altogether in 1970. Lightfoot gave valuable service to Northamptonshire for nearly twenty years, before extending his stay at the County Ground as head groundsman between 1973 and 1978. When Lightfoot was signed in 1953, it was principally as a medium-fast bowler, but he soon emerged as a talented left-handed batsmen, with his breakthrough being a maiden century against Surrey at The Oval in 1958, when he helped Raman Subba Row add a record-breaking 376 for the sixth wicket. However, many Northamptonshire fans who witnessed his career will be quicker to mention the one run that he didn't make rather than the 12,000 that he did. Against Richie Benaud's 1961 Australians, Northamptonshire mounted a spirited challenge after being left to score 198 for victory in two and a half hours, and Lightfoot's gallant half-century helped reduce the target to four runs off the final over. With one ball to go, the scores were level. Alan Davidson bowled to Malcolm Scott who missed, but set off for a bye to acting wicketkeeper Bobby Simpson; Lightfoot, inexplicably, stayed put at the non-striker's end, Scott was run out, and Australia escaped with a draw. It is possible that Lightfoot stayed in the team at times when his batting average drooped due to his ability to 'bowl a bit'. Despite such droops, particularly in the mid-1960s, he managed some very productive batting seasons, especially 1962 when he scored 1,795 runs for Northamptonshire including five hundreds. He also managed two career- reviving seasons in 1968 and 1969, reaching 1,000 runs in each. In the years in between colleagues felt that it was a lack of 'drive' which held him back. He took a benefit in 1970, having already told the club that he would not be staying in the game for the following season.

It is usually included as one of his The Lucy poems, although it is the only poem of the series not to mention her name. The poem is a mere eight lines long; two \\"stanzas.\\" Background During the autumn of 1798, Wordsworth travelled to Germany with his sister Dorothy and fellow poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. From October 1798, Wordsworth worked on the first drafts for his \\"Lucy poems\\", which included \\"Strange fits of passion have I known\\", \\"She dwelt among the untrodden ways\\" and \\"A slumber\\".Matlak 1978 pp. 46‚Äì50 In December 1798, Wordsworth sent copies of \\"Strange fits\\" and \\"She dwelt\\" to Coleridge and followed his letter with \\"A slumber\\". Eventually, \\"A slumber\\", was published in the 1800 edition of Lyrical Ballads.Moorman 1968 p. 422 Unique amongst Lucy poems, \\"A slumber\\" does not directly mention Lucy. The decision by critics to include the poem as part of the series is based in part on Wordsworth's placing it in close proximity to \\"Strange fits\\" and directly after \\"She dwelt\\" in the Lyrical Ballads. Poem The Lucy poems fall within a genre of poems that includes Robert Herrick's lamentations on the death of young girls.Hartman 1967 p. 157 Written in spare language, \\"A slumber...\\" consists of two stanzas, each four lines. The first is built upon an even, soporific movement in which figurative language conveys the nebulous image of a girl.Ford 1957 p. 165 The poem begins: :A slumber did my spirit seal; :I had no human fears: :She seemed a thing that could not feel :The touch of earthly years. (lines 1‚Äì4) The second stanza maintains the quiet, even tone of the first, but serves to undermine the former's sense of the eternal by revealing that Lucy has, by the time of composition, died. The narrator's response to her death lacks bitterness or emptiness; and instead takes consolation from the fact that she is now beyond life's trials: :No motion has she now, no force; :She neither hears nor sees; :Rolled round in earth's diurnal course, :With rocks, and stones, and trees. (lines 5‚Äì8) Themes Lucy is an isolated figure in which the narrator responds to her death.Mahoney 1997 p. 106 The beginning of the poem, according to Wordsworth biographer Mary Moorman, depict a \\"creative sleep of the senses when the 'soul' and imagination are most alive.\\"Moorman 1968 p. 426 This idea appears in other poems by Wordsworth, including Tintern Abbey. The space between stanza one and stanza two depicts a transition of Lucy from life into death. The two stanzas also show that Lucy, a being connected intrinsically to nature, dies before she can attain her own distinct consciousness apart from nature. However, as literary critic Geoffrey Hartman explains, \\"Growing further into consciousness means a simultaneous development into death [...] and not growing further also means death (animal tranquillity, absorption by nature).\\"Hartman 1967 p. 21 The lifeless rocks and stones described in the concluding line convey the finality of Lucy's death.Hirsch 1998 p. 40 Boris Ford argues that within the second stanza as \\"the dead girl is now at last secure beyond question, in inanimate community with the earth's natural fixtures.\\" Coleridge, in a letter to Thomas Poole, states, \\"Whether it had any reality I cannot say. Most probably, in some gloomier moment he had fancied the moment when his sister might die.\\"Moorman 1968 qtd. p. 424 Coleridge's reference was to the state of Lucy as dying or dead within the Lucy poems as a whole and to \\"A slumber\\" in particular. Although Lucy cannot be established, it is certain that there is a relationship between the name Lucy and Wordsworth's sister within Wordsworth's poetry since Wordsworth used the name Lucy in reference to his sister in many poems, including \\"The Glow-Worm\\" and \\"Nutting\\". The problem with relating Lucy to Dorothy is in explaining why Dorothy would be presented in a state of death.Moorman 1968 pp. 423‚Äì424 Dorothy was alive during the composition of the poem, and presented as alive in other Wordsworth poems like The Prelude. As such, the poems are most likely not about Dorothy but just a continuation of a theme in general.Moorman 1968 p. 424 Lucy is presented as character connected to nature who exists in a state between the spiritual and human; similar to a mythical nymph. However, she represents a state of consciousness and exists within the poem as part of the narrator's consciousness. The first stanza describes the narrator transcending human fears because his feelings towards an immortality connected to Lucy, a feeling brought up in \\"Strange fits\\". These feelings of immortality continue in the second stanza because, though dead, she is separated from him by death. She is always a being connected to nature, and the narrator slumbers because his understanding of Lucy is not conscious.Hartman 1967 pp. 158‚Äì159 Since Lucy exists on an unconscious level for the narrator, he cannot grasp her until she has died. As such, he experiences the events as one who is woken from a dream without an understanding of what the dream entailed, and is not able to feel shock at learning of her death. This is thematically represented in the poem by placing Lucy's death between the two stanzas.Hartman 1967 p. 159 Alternatively, if the poem is not read as part of the \\"Lucy\\" cycle, the \\"she\\" referred to in the third line could only be the subject of the prior sentence, namely the poet's spirit, conventionally personified as female by the romantic poets. In this case, the poem is about the pure tranquility afforded by sleep. Critical reception Upon receiving Wordsworth's letter containing a copy of \\"A slumber\\", Coleridge described the work as a \\"sublime epitaph\\". Wordsworth's friend Thomas Powell wrote that the poem \\"stands by itself, and is without title prefixed, yet we are to know, from the penetration of Mr. Wordsworth's admirers, that it is a sequel to the other deep poems that precede it, and is about one Lucy, who is dead. From the table of contents, however, we are informed by the author that it is about 'A Slumber;' for this is the actual title which he has condescended to give it, to put us out of pain as to what it is about.\\"Powell 1831 p. 63 In 1967, Hartman claims that within the poem, \\"Wordsworth achieves the most haunting of his elisions of the human as a mode of being separate from nature.\\"Hartman 1967 p. 158 John Mahoney, in 1997, emphasises the poem's \\"brilliant alliteration of the opening lines\\" along with pointing out that \\"the utter simplicity masks the profundity of feeling; the delicate naturalness of language hides the range of implication\\". Antonia Till remarks that the poem consists mainly of monosyllables with the occasional disyllable. Thus the use of the near-scientific word 'diurnal' achieves astonishing power, bringing a cosmic dimension to the girl's death and demonstrating Wordsworth's mastery of both the majestic and the mundane in his poetry.

The show consisted of five matches, the main event being the traditional CMLL Infierno en el Ring multi-man Steel Cage match where all the competitors risked their hair. This year 15 man participated in the steel cage match, which was the highest number ever for a CMLL Lucha de Apuestas (bet match). The match saw Naito pin Toscano to win the match; afterwards Toscano's hair was shaved off in the middle of the ring. The undercard saw three Six-man tag team matches, which is the most common match format in Lucha Libre. The show was broadcase live on Mexican Radio and televised on the Televisa Deportiva Network. Some of the matches aired as part of CMLL's regular weekly wrestling shows. Production=Background= The Mexican wrestling company Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (Spanish for \\"World Wrestling Council\\"; CMLL) has held a number of major shows over the years using the moniker Infierno en el Ring (\\"Inferno in the Ring\\"), all of which were main evented by a multi-man steel cage match, the eponymous Infierno en el Ring match. CMLL has use the Infierno en el Ring match on other shows, but will intermittently hold a show billed specifically as Infierno en el Ring, with the first such show held in 2008. It is not an annually recurring show, but instead held intermittently sometimes several years apart and not always in the same month of the year either. All Infierno en el Ring shows have been held in Arena M√©xico in Mexico City, Mexico which is CMLL's main venue, its \\"home\\". Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, which means the Infierno en el Ring shows replace their regularly scheduled Super Viernes show. The 2009 Infierno en el Ring show was the second show to use the name. =Storylines= The event featured four professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The first indications of who would be involved in the 2009 Infierno en el Ring cage match came when Naito commented that one of his goals while working in Mexico was to win the hair of H√©ctor Garza. On July 10, 2009 Black Warrior made a challenge to H√©ctor Garza on behalf of Naito, since he did not speak Spanish. Shortly after the challenge it was announced by CMLL that nine wrestlers would participate in cage match: Naito, Yujiro, Black Warrior, Shocker, El Texano Jr., Negro Casas, El Terrible and Tarzan Boy but not H√©ctor Garza. On July 17, 2009, after losing a match to Blue Panther, M√°ximo and Toscano, Black Warrior challenged Blue Panther to put his hair on the line as well. Days later CMLL announce the final line-up for the cage match, 15 men in total were announced, the largest number for any CMLL cage match ever. Besides those already announced CMLL added Blue Panther, M√°xmio, Ray Mendoza Jr., Heavy Metal, Shigeo Okumura and Mictl√°n. Three further matches were announced, all of them traditional Lucha Libre Six-man tag team matches, involving some wrestlers who were working storyline feuds against each other. In the opening match CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Champions Flash and Stuka Jr. would team up with Met√°lico to take on Los Infernales (\\"The Infernal Ones\\"; Virus and Euforia) and Skandalo. Flash and Stuka Jr. had been feuding with Los Infernales over the Arena Coliseo Tag Team titles since Flash and Stuka Jr. won them. The next match announced was Los Hijos del Averno (\\"the Sons of Hell\\"), the team of Averno, Mephisto and Ephesto facing El Hijo del Fantasma, La M√°scara and El Sagrado. Hijo del Fantasm and La Mascara, along with H√©ctor Garza, were the CMLL World Trios Champions, a title Los Hijos del Inferno had been vocal about challenging for in the weeks leading up to Infierno en el Ring. With Garza booked for the main event Hijo del Fantama and la Mascara were teamed up with El Sagrado for a three on three match. The last undercard match announced was M√≠stico teaming up with the CMLL World Tag Team Champions La Sombra and Volador Jr. to form a team called Los Terroristas del Aire (\\"The Terrorists of the Air\\") to face Atlantis, √öltimo Guerrero and Mr. Niebla. Both √öltimo Guerrero and Mr. Niebla had made several mask challenges towards M√≠stico, without a match being announced yet; while Guerrero and Atlantis also wanted to face Sombra and Volador Jr. for the tag team titles at some point. Event=Undercard matches= The opening match of the show was a six-man tag team match, best two out of three falls between the t√©cnico team of Flash, Stuka Jr. and Met√°lico against the rudos Virus, Euforia and Skandalo. After just over five minutes of action Flash rolled Virus up with La Magistra Cradle to win the first fall. The R√∫do team evened the score minutes later when Virus, Euforia and Skandalo applied a triple team submission move to make Flash submit, tying the teams at one fall each. The final fall saw Euforia pin Metalico and Skandalo defeat Stuka Jr. to win the match for the R√∫do team two to one. In the second match of the night Los Hijos del Avernoquickly won the first fall against Hijo del Fantasm, La M√°scara and El Sagrado when the trio performed a triple Powerbomb on Hijo del Fantasm for the pinfall. La M√°scara evened the score for his team when he made Averno submit after applying a pendulum submission hold known as a Campana on him. During the third fall Averno pulled the mask off La M√°scara which caused a disqualification, in Lucha Libre the intentional removal of an opponents mask during the match is an automatic disqualification. The disqualification cost lost Hijos del Averno the match two falls to one. In the third and final undercard match saw Los Terroristas del Aire face off against Atlantic, √öltimo Guerrero and Mr. Niebla. M√≠stico, Volador Jr. and La Sombra all wore masks that were composites of all three masks to show their team unity. During the first fall M√≠stico and √öltimo Guerrero found themselves on the floor, outside the ring as Volador Jr. landed a Guillotine legdrop off the top rope on Mr. Niebla while La Sombra performed a back flip off the top rope, called a Moonsault, on Atlantis for the double pinfall. The second fall saw √öltimo Guerrero intentionally pull his own mask off and put it in M√≠stico's hands so it looked like M√≠stico pulled the mask off him. The ploy worked as the referee disqualified M√≠stico's team despite their protests. In the final fall M√≠stico turned the tables on the rudos but throwing his mask to √öltimo Guerrero and draw an unwarranted disqualification for their second fall. =Main event matches= The fourth match of the evening was the Infierno en el Ring cage match where 15 competitors all put their hair on the line. After all the participants had entered the ring it was announced that it was not allowed to escape the cage until five minutes into the match. Mictl√°n was the first wrestler to escape the cage as he was straddling the top of the cage when the five-minute time limit expired, Heavy Metal escaped less than a minute later. Over the next couple of minutes Blue Panther, Shigeo Okumura, El Terrible and M√°ximo all escaped the cage by climbing up the side and over the top to the floor. Shocker, Texano Jr., Ray Mendoza Jr. and Negro Casas were next to escape leaving only five men in the ring: H√©ctor Garza, Black Warrior, Toscano, Yujiro and Naito. At one point Garza had climbed to the top of the cage and could have left the cage but instead he opted to vault backwards off the top of the cage onto the four remaining competitors, performing a Moonsault. After knocking everyone else down, Garza easily climbed the cage and escaped. Black Warrior was the first of the four to get back to his feet and escaped the cage while Yujiro and Naito stopped Toscano from leaving. After beating up Toscano for a moment both Yujiro and Naito started to climb up opposite sides of the cage. Toscano managed to jump up and stop Naito from leaving the ring, but Yujiro was too fast to be stopped, leaving Natio and Toscano as the final two men. Naito and Toscano faced off in a regular one on one match to see who would have their hair shaved off. After just over four minutes and thirty seconds Naito pinned Toscano using a Dragon Suplex into a pinning combination for the victory. After the match Toscano was shaved completely bald.

The lake is in area, and is at the head of the St. Johns River. The name \\"Hell 'n Blazes\\" has been attributed to the words used by early 20th century fishermenmen while trying to navigate through floating islands, and to the formerly remote location of the lake. The variants \\"Hellen Blazes\\" and \\"Helen Blazes\\" have been used as euphemisms. The lake originally was in a marshy floodplain that was wide. As agriculture expanded into the floodplain, canals were dug draining into the lake, and the marshes were reduced to just wide near the lake. Heavy rainfall sends large quantities of polluted water into the lake. The lake had been reputed to be one of the best bass-fishing lakes in Florida, but was in decline by the 1970s. Bass stopped spawning in the lake, and rarely entered it. In 1992 the lake was clogged with hydrilla and water hyacinth. By 1994 drainage had left the lake with only a foot or two of water, grounding the floating islands it was known for. A 1992 report to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission concluded that dredging accumulated sediment from the lake bottom would restore the bass fishery in the lake. no funding had been approved for a dredging project. The nearby Helen Blazes archaeological site is named for the lake.

actuators (EHAs), replace hydraulic systems with self- contained actuators operated solely by electrical power. EHAs eliminate the need for separate hydraulic pumps and tubing, simplifying system architectures and improving safety and reliability. This technology originally was developed for the aerospace industry but has since expanded into many other industries where hydraulic power is commonly used. Conventional designs Aircraft were originally controlled by small aerodynamic surfaces operated by cables, attached to levers that magnified the pilot's input, using mechanical advantage. As aircraft grew in size and performance, the aerodynamic forces on these surfaces grew to the point where it was no longer possible for the pilot to manually control them across a wide range of speeds - controls with enough advantage to control the aircraft at high speed left the aircraft with significant overcontrol at lower speeds when the aerodynamic forces were reduced. Numerous aircraft in the early stages of World War II suffered from these problems, notably the Mitsubishi Zero and P-38 Lightning. Starting in the 1940s, hydraulics were introduced to address these problems. In their early incarnations, hydraulic pumps attached to the engines fed high-pressure oil through tubes to the various control surfaces. Here, small valves were attached to the original control cables, controlling the flow of oil into an associated actuator connected to the control surface. One of the earliest fittings of a hydraulic boost system was to ailerons on late-war models of the P-38L, removing the need for great human strength to achieve a higher rate of roll.\\"Lockheed P-38 Lightning Pilot's Flight Manual\\", pg. 5 The systems evolved, replacing the mechanical linkages to the valves with electrical controls, producing the \\"fly-by-wire\\" design,Frischemeir, pg. 2 and more recently, optical networking systems called \\"fly-by-light\\". All these systems require three separate components, the hydraulic supply system, the valves and associated control network, and the actuators. Since any one of these systems could fail and render the aircraft inoperable, redundancies are needed that greatly increase the complexity of the system. Additionally, keeping the hydraulic oil pressurized is a constant power drain. EHAs The primary development that lead to the possibility of EHAs was the precision feedback controlled conventional motor, or high-power stepper motor.Frischemeir, pg. 3 Stepper motors are designed to move a fixed angle with every application of energy, and do so repeatedly in an extremely precise fashion. Both types of motor drives have been in use for years, powering the controls on motion control rigs and numeric control machine tools for instance. With an EHA, high-power versions of these motors are used to drive a reversible pump, which is tied to a hydraulic cylinder. The pump pressurizes a working fluid, typically hydraulic oil, directly raising the pressure in the cylinder, and causing it to move. The entire system, consisting of the pump, the cylinder and a reservoir of hydraulic fluid, is packaged into a single self-contained unit. Instead of the energy needed to move the controls being supplied by an external hydraulic supply, it is supplied over normal electrical wiring, albeit larger wiring than what would be found in a fly-by-wire system. The speed of the motion is controlled through the use of pulse-code modulation. The result is a \\"power-by-wire\\" system, where both the control and energy are sent through a single set of wires.C. W. Helsley, Jr., \\"Power By Wire for Aircraft - the All-Electric Airplane\\", SAE, #771006, February 1977 Redundancy can thus be provided by using two such units per surface, and two sets of electrical wires. This is far simpler than the corresponding systems using an external hydraulic supply. Additionally, the EHA has the advantage that it only draws power when it is being moved, the pressure is maintained internally when the motor stops. This can reduce power use on the aircraft by eliminating the constant draw of the hydraulic pumps. EHAs also reduce weight, allow better streamlining due to reduced internal routing of piping, and lower overall weight of the control system.Adams References=NotesBibliography= * Robert Navarro, \\"Performance of an Electro-Hydrostatic Actuator on the F-18 Systems Research Aircraft\\", NANASA/TM-97-206224, October 1997 *Stefan Frischemeir, \\"Electrohydrostatic Actuators for Aircraft Primary Flight Control\\", Technical University Hamburg-Harburg * Charlotte Adams, \\"A380: 'More Electric' Aircraft\\", Avionics, 1 October 2001 External links * Electrohydrostatic actuation, Young & Franklin * Electrohydrostatic actuation, Parker Aircraft controls ","title":"Electro-hydraulic actuator"},{"id":"23769404","text":"The Open the Freedom Gate Championship was the major title in the promotion Dragon Gate USA.

Development After the aircraft flew for the first time on 23 October 1916, the test pilot and designer modified the fighter to recover the second seat and carry extra fuel tanks, the idea being to use it to escape Russia in the event of the impending revolution. Their plan was discovered and the modifications were reverted. Testing continued until 11 November 1916. Despite glowing reports of the aircraft's performance, none were ordered and the prototype sat at the factory until October 1917.

He has worked as a director in adult video (AV) as well as in the horror and gore genres. Life and career Iguchi was born on June 28, 1969. In an interview he said he was influenced in his work by the ghost houses and freak shows he went to as a child in Japanese play lands, and that his aim in his films is to both entertain and surprise. =Adult videos= In his extensive career as an AV director, Iguchi has worked for a number of studios including CineMagic, Big Morkal, Try-Heart, h.m.p and Soft On Demand (SOD). Nana Natsume and Risa Coda have been among the AV Idols featured in his videos. His videos have explored several of the typical Japanese AV genres, from incest for SOD to \\"nakadashi\\", bondage, group sex and some enema fetish videos for CineMagic. His video Final Pussy starring Nana Natsume won the Best Rental Video Award at the 2005 SOD Awards. In this January 2005 video, Natsume's character (as the result of a military experiment gone wrong) has guns burst from her breasts when sexually aroused. The special makeup effects were by Yoshihiro Nishimura. =Mainstream film= One of Iguchi's early movies was Kurushime-san („ÇØ„É´„Ç∑„É°„Åï„Çì) which was first released in 1997. Iguchi was screenwriter, editor, cinematographer and director of the black comedy-horror film which won the Encouragement Prize at the 1998 Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival and starred Aki Arai, Miako Tadano and Tomoko Matsunashi. In 2003, Iguchi wrote and directed the horror comedy (with effects by Yoshihiro Nishimura) about a strange relationship involving a boy, a girl, and a parasite. Iguchi also wrote and directed the February 2006 film with AV star Asami. At an interview at the New York Asian Film Festival, Iguchi told of an incident where one of the actresses in the movie, completely unaware of her role, balked at doing action scenes totally naked. According to Iguchi \\"We had to calm her down, capture her, and convince her to do the job ... We made it so she could not leave the set ... [in] America we would have been sued.\\" Later in 2006, Iguchi directed based on the manga by Kazuo Umezu. The movie, with gravure idol Miku Ishida, Asami Kumakiri, Hiromasa Taguchi, Naoto Takenaka and Kanji Tsuda, was released theatrically in Japan in June 2006, and on DVD in October of the same year. Iguchi was also both the screenwriter and director for the 2008 action and gore cult film where he once again teamed up with Yoshihiro Nishimura who did the special effects and makeup effects. Iguchi said he wanted to make an action movie with a woman fighting and it started with just an idea of a girl losing her arm and going out for revenge and was originally called \\"One Armed Big Busty Girl\\" - the machine gun came later. Iguchi was a special guest at the 2009 and 2010 New York Asian Film Festival. In 2010, Iguchi directed his largest-budgeted feature, the action film Karate- Robo Zaborgar, based on the popular 1970s television series Denjin Zaborger. He followed it with the scatological horror/comedy Zombie Ass in 2011.

Its range extends northwards as far as Norway, Finland, and the Saint Petersburg area of Russia. It is an aquatic beetle and moves rapidly around on the surface or swims underwater in still or slow-moving fresh water. Description Gyrinus natator is a small oval beetle, about long and wide. The highest point of the body is near the middle. The dorsal surface is black with a metallic sheen, and the ventral surface is mainly black, although the epipleura (skirt) can be brown or even reddish. The limbs are reddish or yellowish. There are rows of minute punctures in the elytra, the outer rows being slightly more clearly demarcated than the inner ones. It is very similar in appearance to Gyrinus substriatus and Gyrinus suffriani. Distribution and habitat In Europe, this whirligig beetle is found in Austria, Belarus, the Czech Republic, mainland Denmark, Estonia, Finland, mainland France, Germany, Great Britain including the Isle of Man, the Republic of Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, mainland Norway, Poland, central and northern Russia, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Romania and Ukraine. Its eastern range extends to Siberia and China, but it is relatively uncommon in Western Europe. It is often to be seen on the surface of still or slow-moving streams, ponds and marshes, especially sunny spots with a limited quantity of emergent vegetation. Ecology This beetle is gregarious and groups of beetles are often to be seen gyrating rapidly on the surface of the water. It feeds on water fleas and other small invertebrates, and on insects that fall onto the surface of the water. If alarmed it will dive under water and remain submerged for some time. This whirligig beetle can fly, and can often be found in temporary water bodies. The eggs are laid in rows on aquatic plants. The larvae have filament-like breathing tubes projecting on either side of the body and superficially resemble centipedes. When fully developed they climb upwards, pupating on emergent plants, before descending again to the water when they emerge from the pupal case. Breeding takes place in the summer, and the adults hibernate under water during the winter, clinging onto submerged objects.

They are sometimes called \\"sea angels\\" or \\"naked sea butterflies\\" along with the other superfamily in the Gymnosomata. They can be found anywhere from the surface to a depth of 350 meters. They are transparent and small, with the largest of the species being up to 5 cm. Common Clione Some species of sea angel feed only on sea butterflies. The angels have terminal mouths with the radula common to mollusks, and tentacles to grasp their prey, sometimes with suckers similar to cephalopods. Their \\"wings\\" allow sea angels to swim much faster than the larger (usually fused) wings of sea butterflies. Gymnosomes slowly beat their wing-like parapodia in a rowing motion to propel their perfectly-streamlined bodies through the upper 20 meters of the water column. Although usually slow moving, beating their wings once or twice per second, they are capable of bursts of speed when they need to pursue their prey, calling a separate suite of muscles into action to obtain the higher beat frequency. The IPCC reports that increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide is causing acidification of the oceans, which could eliminate pteropods from the Southern Ocean and cause serious repercussions throughout the food chain.Phylo Taxonomy In the new taxonomy of Bouchet & Rocroi (2005), the superfamily Clionoidea consists of the following families: * Clionidae * Cliopsidae * Notobranchaeidae * Pneumodermatidae References Euopisthobranchia ","title":"Clionoidea"},{"id":"23769579","text":"Hydromyloidea is a taxonomic superfamily of sea slugs, specifically sea angels, marine opisthobranch gastropod mollusks in the order Gymnosomata.

Development With prototypes rolled out in September and December 1951, the SZD-8 Jask√≥≈Çka (Swallow) was a high- performance glider for its day, introducing several innovations to glider design such as a sliding moulded Plexiglas canopy, recessed handle in the rear fuselage for ground handling and a semi-retractable mainwheel. The all-wood wings were covered with plywood and fabric incorporating Fowler flaps on the trailing edges, which could be lowered to 12¬∞ or 25¬∞, and Schemp-Hirth style airbrakes aft of the mainspars. Main designer was Tadeusz Kostia. The first prototype was flown on 21 September 1951 (test pilot Adam Zientek), but it revealed faults. After reconstruction, with longer fuselage and enlarged rudder (designated SZD-8-2) it appeared successful and was ordered into production, becoming the most popular competition glider in Poland from 1953 to 1957. Many of the 135 production aircraft were exported, garnering at least fifteen world records from May 1954 to May 1960. Licensed production was also carried out in the DDR (Deutsche Demokratische Republik - German Democratic Republic) and the PRC (People's Republic of China).

In 1893, Bannon started his major league career with the St. Louis Browns. He hit well, and after the season, he signed with the Boston Beaneaters. There, he joined future Hall of Famers Hugh Duffy and Tommy McCarthy in the outfield. In 1894, Bannon batted .336 with 130 runs scored and 114 runs batted in for the powerful Boston offense. He also performed well defensively, leading all National League outfielders with 43 assists. In 1895, he batted a career-high .347. He also helped turn 12 double plays, tied for second-most double plays turned by a right fielder in a single season. Bannon slumped badly in 1896, though, and he was released in August. In four years, he appeared in a total of 367 major league games, achieving a lifetime .320 batting average with 19 home runs and 253 RBI. Bannon then went down to the minors.

Ferdinand II, son of Emperor Ferdinand I, was one of history's most prominent collectors of art. The cultured humanist from the House of Austria accommodated his world-famous collections in a museum built specifically for that purpose (1572-1583, supplement 1589). So, the Lower Castle as building itself became an exhibit, making Ambras Castle in Innsbruck perhaps the oldest museum in the world. As the only Renaissance Kunstkammer of its kind to have been preserved at its original location, the Chamber of Art and Wonders represents an unrivalled cultural monument. Representing an outstanding example of a late Renaissance encyclopedic collection of its genre, it continues to be displayed at Ambras Castle Innsbruck, the same setting since its inception. Ferdinand II, like many other rulers of the Renaissance, was interested in promoting the arts and sciences. The Habsburg Archduke spent considerable time and money on his unique collection: armour, weapons, portraits, natural objects, rarities, 'wonders of nature', most recent scientific instruments, musical instruments, precious items, and so on; which in later times should be classified as artificialia, naturalia, scientifica, exotica, and mirabilia. Beside the \\"Chamber of Art and Wonders\\" Ambras Castle is home to a famous collection of armouries and early modern weapons feature masterpieces of the European armourer's art from the Renaissance; Archduke Ferdinand II was the first in the history of the museum to present his collection according to a systematic concept within a specially constructed museum building. The \\"Glassammlung Strasser\\" (Strasser Collection of Glass) boasts precious glassware from the Renaissance and Baroque periods. The \\"Habsburger Portr√§tgalerie\\" (Habsburg Portrait Gallery) laid out on three floors is open to visitors in summer. The paintings include works by famous painters such as Hans Burgkmair, Lucas Cranach the Younger, Giuseppe Arcimboldo, Peter Paul Rubens, Diego Vel√°zquez, and others. Today, these collections at Ambras are administered by the KHM- Museumsverband, as part of the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna. The Collection A variety of uncommon objects are on display, including a woodcarving of \\"Death\\" by Hans Leinberger, goblets, coral collections and artifacts, glass figures, centerpieces, mechanical toys, clocks and various instruments. Also, Asiatica of the period are included with a suit of samurai armor, a Ryukyu bowl, and a silk painting from China. =Paintings= The Ambras collection contains a number of unique portraits, and some of the subjects were perceived at the time as \\"Wonder of Nature\\". The painters are not known. Giants and dwarfs, people with hirsutism and others, are shown, including: Gregor Baci Portrait of Gregor Baci This portrait represents a Hungarian hussar, by tradition Gregor Baci, who apparently survived a piercing injury with a lance to the right side of his face. The injury may have occurred during a jousting tournament or while fighting the Ottoman Turks. The painting was created by an unknown artist in the 16th century and first listed in 1621. Vlad ≈¢epe≈ü Portrait of Vlad ≈¢epe≈ü, better known as \\"Dracula\\" A Man with Disabilities Vlad III the Impaler's depiction was painted about one century after his reign and represents one of his earliest portraits. It is intended not only to show him as a ruler but also to be a \\"psychogram of evil\\".  A man with disabilities  This is an unusual and unique late 16th-century painting of a man with a physical disability. In typical portrait-style he gazes at the viewer, while the top of his head is covered by a hat. A fashionable neck piece separates his head from his naked body, which lies chest-down on a dark green sheet. His limbs appear withered and useless. Originally the portrait was partially obscured by a sheet of red paper, which the observer would lift to reveal the subject's body. Observers indicated that they were shocked. The man was probably a jester at a court. An extensive analysis of the painting has been published (see external links). Petrus Gonsalvus The collection has a painting of Petrus Gonsalvus and his family, as well as other people who display an extreme form of hirsutism, also called Ambras syndrome in 1933 in reference to its depiction at this collection. The life of Pedro Gonzalez has been well chronicled as he became famous during his lifetime on account of his condition. Born in 1537 in Tenerife, he first came to the court of Henry II, King of France, who sent him to the court of Margaret of Parma, regent of the Netherlands. He got married there and some of his children were also afflicted with hypertrichosis universalis and painted. His family became an object of medical inquiry by Ulisse Aldrovandi among others. Gonzalez eventually settled in Italy. The paintings of Gonsalvus by an anonymous German artist were likely created from drawings, rather than a live sitting. The paintings were titled \\"Der Rauch man Zu M√ºnichen\\" (the \\"Wild/Hairy Man from Munich\\" for an old Middle High German Word r√ªch meaning wild/hairy) because of the origin of the painting, not because Gonsalvus spent any time in Munich.

Morphology  The body length ranges from 8.0 to 11.0 mm. Compound eyes are present, not divided into ventral and dorsal portions, strongly protruding. Labrum is short and transverse. The antennae are filiform, almost glabrous, with 11 segments.  Phylogeny and evolution  The monophyly of the family is not in doubt. Hygrobiidae is thought to be the sister group to a clade comprising Dytiscidae (diving beetles), Amphizoidae (trout stream beetles) and Aspidytidae (cliff beetles), based on DNA sequence data.Balke, M., Ribera, I., & Beutel, R.

Systematic placement of the recently discovered beetle family Meruidae (Coleoptera: Dytiscoidea) based on molecular data. Zoologica Scripta, 37(6), 647-650. Regarding the relationships among the species of Hygrobia, a recent phylogenetic analysis suggested a sister group relationship between H. hermanni and a clade formed by the Australian species, with H. nigra sister to H. australasiae. Hygrobiidae probably diverged from other Hydradephagan clades around the time of the initial breakup of Pangea. The split between today‚Äôs Palearctic and Australian clades occurred later, possibly in the middle Mesozoic, by dispersal events.

Perry died at his home in Cleveland on May 11, 1885 as \\"one of the most prominent and popular men in Cleveland.\\" His funeral was held at his residence, 664 Euclid Avenue, and the service was conducted by Dr. Bolles, the Rector of Trinity Church, and the pallbearers were Amos Townsend, John H. Farley, Gen. James A. Barnett, Jacob Mueller, Charles Otis, L. M. Coe, John Tod, and W. J. McKinnie. He was buried at Lake View Cemetery.

Early history In 1999, Barbara Ferrara, of the University of Illinois at Springfield, wrote a grant request to launch a study into what would be needed to start an Illinois version of C-SPAN. The Joyce Foundation approved the grant and awarded $396,000 to fund the project. The MacArthur Foundation also donated $50,000 toward the project. Terry Martin, a former member of C-SPAN's Congressional coverage team, who had also worked in local news covering Illinois politics, was selected as the study's Project Director. The study was guided by a 50-member Blue Ribbon panel, led by former Illinois Governor, Jim Edgar, and former US Senator Paul Simon. During the first meeting of the Planning Study's Advisory Board, the name Illinois Channel was selected as the new name for this effort to launch a statewide public affairs network. During the study an examination of other states' efforts were examined, the nonprofit corporation was established under IRS rules, and initial production and distribution was begun. The first Illinois Channel program, involved coverage of the Illinois Supreme Court hearing a case on redistricting Illinois' political districts, following the 2000 census. Independent Nonprofit Corporation In December 2002, the Illinois Channel Planning Study concluded. Among the recommendation of the study, was that the nonprofit organization operating the Channel, should be free of any affiliations with other organizations, including the University of Illinois Springfield, which had conducted the study. This was done, so that every institution of high education in Illinois would feel it had an equal opportunity to have their public affairs programming televised. In January 2003, the Illinois Channel began independent operations in the Illinois Municipal League's building at 500 East Capitol Street, in Springfield. Among the initial Board members to serve on the new nonprofit, were former US Senator Adlai Stevenson, whose father had twice run for President [ 1952 & 1956 ], legendary Illinois newsman Mike Lawrence, who was a confidant of both Gov. Jim Edgar and Senator Paul Simon. Terry Martin, who had led the Planning Study, stayed with the project as Executive Director. Funding the Illinois Channel remained a private sector function, and was launched with a $50,000 grant from Boeing, a $3000 grant from the Illinois Bar Association, and some $30,000 in remaining funds from the planning study. Growth & Benchmarks In subsequent years, more and more communities added the Illinois Channel's programming. Though the study had called for the Illinois Channel to be operated 24/7, across the state, a lack of adequate funds continued to limit the Channel to producing two hours of weekly programming. But this programming was well received, and over the next few years, the Illinois Channel's listing of communities where its programming was available on cable, grew to over 128, which connected some 1,400,000 cable homes to the Channel. The Illinois Channel was among the first television broadcasters to videostream its programming, launching its videostreaming service in February, 2003. The Illinois Channel was the first‚Äîand to date only‚Äîbroadcaster which the Illinois Supreme Court allowed to use two cameras to record its proceedings. Under the rules of the Illinois Supreme Court, only one camera is allowed in the Chamber. In November 2003, then Illinois State Senator Barack Obama seeking the Democratic nomination for the US Senate seat, was interviewed on the Illinois Channel. Obama, who was running behind candidate Blair Hull at the time, went on to win the nomination, the seat in the US Senate, and in 2008, was elected the 44th President of the United States. In 2004, the Chicago Medical Society recognized the quality of the Illinois Channel's coverage of the looming Medical Malpractice issues, when it granted the Channel its \\"Grassroots in Medicine\\" award, for non-medical providers who advance the cause of medicine. In 2008, the Champaign County Medical Society recognized the Channel with its award, for its medical coverage. And demonstrating its appeal to both sides as a nonpartisan broadcaster, in November, 2008, Keith Hebeisen who had been the President of the Illinois Trial Lawyers Association in 2004 when the Medical Malpractice issue was at its zenith, joined the Illinois Channel Board, where he joined Dr. Neil Winston, who had served as President of the Chicago Medical Society in 2004. Funding Issues Complicate Full-Time Coverage While C-SPAN is funded privately, but America's cable operators, the majority of state-run public affairs channels are operated with some, or all, of their funding coming from a state appropriation. In July, 2007, then Senator Frank Watson, the Leader of the Senate Republicans, gained $1,000,000 for the Channel in the FY 2008 state budget. But, then Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who was attempting to fund projects he favored after the Illinois legislature ignored his funding requests, vetoed the Illinois Channel's $1,000,000 as part of the effort to get $400 million redirected to fund the projects he'd proposed. In his impeachment trial in the Illinois Senate, one of the counts against Blagojevich, was his using these funds without legislative approval. But as a result of the veto, the Illinois Channel continued to struggle financially, as it operated without commercials, or state funds. In June 2009, the state legislature approved its first Capital plan in ten years. The Illinois Channel was awarded two grants, totaling $190,000 toward establishing the Channel's own building.

Wearable technology has a variety of applications which grows as the field itself expands. It appears prominently in consumer electronics with the popularization of the smartwatch and activity tracker. Apart from commercial uses, wearable technology is being incorporated into navigation systems, advanced textiles, and healthcare. watch History The pre-history of wearable technology starts with the watch, which was worn by people to tell time. In 1500 the German inventor Peter Henlein created small watches that were worn as necklaces. A century later, men began to carry their watches in their pockets as the waistcoat became a fashionable item, which led to the creation of pocket watches. Wristwatches were also created in the late 1600s but were worn mostly by women as bracelets. Over time, the watch becomes smaller and more precise. In 1904, the aviator Alberto Santos-Dumont pioneered the use of the wristwatch as it allowed him to have his hands unoccupied when piloting. This proved that the wrist is a convenient place to wear a watch which led people to start using wristwatches. People started to create wearables to use in every occasion, from tools that help them win in gambling games, to rings used as a computational device by traders, to electronic headbands used as a costume in theaters, and a wearable camera strapped to a bird to take aerial photos, among others. Modern wearable technology is related to both ubiquitous computing and the history and development of wearable computers. Wearables make technology pervasive by incorporating it into daily life. Through the history and development of wearable computing, pioneers have attempted to enhance or extend the functionality of clothing, or to create wearables as accessories able to provide users with sousveillance ‚Äî the recording of activity typically by way of small wearable or portable personal technologies. Tracking information like movement, steps, and heart rate is part of the quantified self movement. The origins of modern wearable technology are influenced by both of these responses to the vision of ubiquitous computing. One early piece of widely adopted pre-modern wearable technology was the calculator watch, which was introduced in the 1980s. An even earlier wearable technology was the hearing aid. In 2008, Ilya Fridman incorporated a hidden Bluetooth microphone into a pair of earrings. Fitbit released its first step counter in late 2010; Fitbit products have primarily focused upon activity tracking. Fitbit is now owned by Alphabet and is no longer an independent wearable electronics company. In the following years, smartwatches began to be released by major electronics companies as well as by new start-ups. One of the first offerings was the Samsung Galaxy Gear in September 2013. Apple followed more than a year later with the Apple Watch in April 2015. In 2012, Oculus launched a Kickstarter campaign to start sales of the first consumer virtual reality headset. In 2016, the company, HTC released a new generation of the VR headsets that allowed users to move freely within a virtual space. Prototypes From 1991‚Äì1997, Rosalind Picard and her students, Steve Mann and Jennifer Healey, at the MIT Media Lab designed, built, and demonstrated data collection and decision making from \\"Smart Clothes\\" that monitored continuous physiological data from the wearer. These \\"smart clothes\\", \\"smart underwear\\", \\"smart shoes\\", and smart jewellery collected data that related to affective state and contained or controlled physiological sensors and environmental sensors like cameras and other devices.

Communications of the ACM, 39(8), 23-24. In 2009, Sony Ericsson teamed up with the London College of Fashion for a contest to design digital clothing. The winner was a cocktail dress with Bluetooth technology making it light up when a call is received. Zach \\"Hoeken\\" Smith of MakerBot fame made keyboard pants during a \\"Fashion Hacking\\" workshop at a New York City creative collective. The Tyndall National Institute in Ireland developed a \\"remote non-intrusive patient monitoring\\" platform which was used to evaluate the quality of the data generated by the patient sensors and how the end users may adopt to the technology.O'Donoghue, John, John Herbert, and Paul Stack. \\"Remote non- intrusive patient monitoring.\\" Smart Homes and Beyond (2006): 180‚Äì87. More recently, London-based fashion company CuteCircuit created costumes for singer Katy Perry featuring LED lighting so that the outfits would change color both during stage shows and appearances on the red carpet such as the dress Katy Perry wore in 2010 at the MET Gala in NYC. In 2012, CuteCircuit created the world's first dress to feature Tweets, as worn by singer Nicole Scherzinger. In 2014, graduate students from the Tisch School of Arts in New York designed a hoodie that sent pre-programmed text messages triggered by gesture movements. Around the same time, prototypes for digital eyewear with heads up display (HUD) began to appear.Anne Eisenberg Inside These Lenses, a Digital Dimension April 25, 2009 New York Times The US military employs headgear with displays for soldiers using a technology called holographic optics. In 2010, Google started developing prototypes of its optical head-mounted display Google Glass, which went into customer beta in March 2013. Usage In the consumer space, sales of smart wristbands (aka activity trackers such as the Jawbone UP and Fitbit Flex) started accelerating in 2013. One in five American adults have a wearable device, according to the 2014 PriceWaterhouseCoopers Wearable Future Report. As of 2009, decreasing cost of processing power and other components was facilitating widespread adoption and availability. In professional sports, wearable technology has applications in monitoring and real-time feedback for athletes.Duncan Smith The Rise of the Virtual Trainer July 13, 2009 Product Design and Development Examples of wearable technology in sport include accelerometers, pedometers, and GPS's which can be used to measure an athlete's energy expenditure and movement pattern. Modern technologies The Fitbit, a modern wearable device On April 16, 2013, Google invited \\"Glass Explorers\\" who had pre-ordered its wearable glasses at the 2012 Google I/O conference to pick up their devices. This day marked the official launch of Google Glass, a device intended to deliver rich text and notifications via a heads-up display worn as eyeglasses. The device also had a 5 MP camera and recorded video at 720p. Its various functions were activated via voice command, such as \\"OK Glass\\". The company also launched the Google Glass companion app, MyGlass. The first third-party Google Glass App came from the New York Times, which was able to read out articles and news summaries. However, in early 2015, Google stopped selling the beta \\"explorer edition\\" of Glass to the public, after criticism of its design and the $1,500 price tag. While optical head-mounted display technology remains a niche, two popular types of wearable devices have taken off: smartwatches and activity trackers. In 2012, ABI Research forecast that sales of smartwatches would hit $1.2 million in 2013, helped by the high penetration of smartphones in many world markets, the wide availability and low cost of MEMS sensors, energy-efficient connectivity technologies such as Bluetooth 4.0, and a flourishing app ecosystem.More Than One Million Smart Watches will be Shipped in 2013, ABI Research Crowdfunding-backed start-up Pebble reinvented the smartwatch in 2013, with a campaign running on Kickstarter that raised more than $10m in funding. At the end of 2014, Pebble announced it had sold a million devices. In early 2015, Pebble went back to its crowdfunding roots to raise a further $20m for its next-generation smartwatch, Pebble Time, which started shipping in May 2015. In March 2014, Motorola unveiled the Moto 360 smartwatch powered by Android Wear, a modified version of the mobile operating system Android designed specifically for smartwatches and other wearables. Finally, following more than a year of speculation, Apple announced its own smartwatch, the Apple Watch, in September 2014. Wearable technology was a popular topic at the trade show Consumer Electronics Show in 2014, with the event dubbed \\"The Wearables, Appliances, Cars and Bendable TVs Show\\" by industry commentators. Among numerous wearable products showcased were smartwatches, activity trackers, smart jewelry, head-mounted optical displays and earbuds. Nevertheless, wearable technologies are still suffering from limited battery capacity. Another field of application of wearable technology is monitoring systems for assisted living and eldercare. Wearable sensors have a huge potential in generating big data, with a great applicability to biomedicine and ambient assisted living. For this reason, researchers are moving their focus from data collection to the development of intelligent algorithms able to glean valuable information from the collected data, using data mining techniques such as statistical classification and neural networks. Wearable technology can also collect biometric data such as heart rate (ECG and HRV), brainwave (EEG), and muscle bio-signals (EMG) from the human body to provide valuable information in the field of health care and wellness. Another increasingly popular wearable technology involves virtual reality. VR headsets have been made by a range of manufacturers for computers, consoles, and mobile devices. Recently Google released their headset, the Google Daydream. In July 2014 a smart technology footwear was introduced in Hyderabad, India. The shoe insoles are connected to a smartphone application that uses Google Maps, and vibrate to tell users when and where to turn to reach their destination. In addition to commercial applications, wearable technology is being researched and developed for a multitude of uses. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is one of the many research institutions developing and testing technologies in this field. For example, research is being done to improve haptic technology for its integration into next generation wearables. Another project focuses on using wearable technology to assist the visually impaired in navigating their surroundings. As wearable technology continues to grow, it has begun to expand into other fields. The integration of wearables into healthcare has been a focus of research and development for various institutions. Wearables continue to evolve, moving beyond devices and exploring new frontiers such as smart fabrics. Applications involve using a fabric to perform a function such as integrating a QR code into the textile, or performance apparel that increases airflow during exercise  Wearable technology and health  Wearable technology is often used to monitor a user's health. Given that such a device is in close contact with the user, it can easily collect data. It started as soon as 1980 where first wireless ECG was invented. In the last decades, it shows rapid growth in research of textile-based, tattoo, patch, and contact lenses. Wearables can be used to collect data on a user's health including: * Heart rate * Calories burned * Steps walked * Blood pressure *Release of certain biochemicals * Time spent exercising * Seizures *physical strain These functions are often bundled together in a single unit, like an activity tracker or a smartwatch like the Apple Watch Series 2 or Samsung Galaxy Gear Sport. Devices like these are used for physical training and monitoring overall physical health, as well as alerting to serious medical conditions such as seizures (e.g. Empatica Embrace). Currently other applications within healthcare are being explored, such as: * Forecasting changes in mood, stress, and health * Measuring blood alcohol content * Measuring athletic performance * Monitoring how sick the user is *Long-term monitoring of patients with heart and circulatory problems that records an electrocardiogram and is self- moistening * Health Risk Assessment applications, including measures of frailty and risks of age-dependent diseases *Automatic documentation of care activities. While wearables can collect data in aggregate form, most of them are limited in their ability to analyze or make conclusions based on this data; thus, most are used primarily for general health information. (An exception is seizure-alerting wearables, which continuously analyze the wearer's data and make a decision about calling for help; the data collected can then provide doctors with objective evidence that they may find useful in diagnoses.) Wearables can account for individual differences, although most just collect data and apply one-size-fits-all algorithms. Today, there is a growing interest to use wearables not only for individual self-tracking, but also within corporate health and wellness programs. Given that wearables create a massive data trail which employers could repurpose for objectives other than health, more and more research has begun to study the dark side of wearables. Asha Peta Thompson founded Intelligent Textiles Limited, Intelligent Textiles, who create woven power banks and circuitry that can be used in e-uniforms for infantry.  Epidermal (skin) Electronics  Epidermal electronics is an emerging field of wearable technology, termed for their properties and behaviors comparable to those of the epidermis, or outermost layer of the skin. These wearables are mounted directly onto the skin to continuously monitor physiological and metabolic processes, both dermal and subdermal. Wireless capability is typically achieved through battery, Bluetooth or NFC, making these devices convenient and portable as a type of wearable technology. Currently, epidermal electronics are being developed in the fields of fitness and medical monitoring. The significance of epidermal electronics involves their mechanical properties, which resemble those of skin. The skin can be modeled as bilayer, composed of an epidermis having Young's Modulus (E) of 2-80 kPa and thickness of 0.3‚Äì3 mm and a dermis having E of 140-600 kPa and thickness of 0.05-1.5 mm. Together this bilayer responds plastically to tensile strains ‚â• 30%, below which the skin's surface stretches and wrinkles without deforming. Properties of epidermal electronics mirror those of skin to allow them to perform in this same way. Like skin, epidermal electronics are ultrathin (h < 100 Œºm), low-modulus (E ~ 70 kPa), and lightweight (<10 mg/cm2), enabling them to conform to the skin without applying strain. Conformal contact and proper adhesion enable the device to bend and stretch without delaminating, deforming or failing, thereby eliminating the challenges with conventional, bulky wearables, including measurement artifacts, hysteresis, and motion-induced irritation to the skin. With this inherent ability to take the shape of skin, epidermal electronics can accurately acquire data without altering the natural motion or behavior of skin. The thin, soft, flexible design of epidermal electronics resembles that of temporary tattoos laminated on the skin. Essentially, these devices are \\"mechanically invisible\\" to the wearer. Epidermal electronics devices may adhere to the skin via van der Waals forces or elastomeric substrates. With only van der Waals forces, an epidermal device has the same thermal mass per unit area (150 mJ cm‚àí2 K‚àí1) as skin, when the skin's thickness is <500 nm. Along with van der Waals forces, the low values of E and thickness are effective in maximizing adhesion because they prevent deformation-induced detachment due to tension or compression. Introducing an elastomeric substrate can improve adhesion but will raise the thermal mass per unit area slightly. Several materials have been studied to produce these skin-like properties, including photolithography patterned serpentine gold nanofilm and patterned doping of silicon nanomembranes.  Entertainment  Wearables have expanded into the entertainment space by creating new ways to experience digital media. Virtual reality headsets and augmented reality glasses have come to exemplify wearables in entertainment. The influence of these virtual reality headsets and augmented reality glasses are seen mostly in the gaming industry during the initial days, but are now used in the fields of medicine and education. Virtual reality headsets such as the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and Google Daydream View aim to create a more immersive media experience by either simulating a first-person experience or displaying the media in the user's full field of vision. Television, films, video games, and educational simulators have been developed for these devices to be used by working professionals and consumers. In a 2014 expo, Ed Tang of Avegant presented his \\"Smart Headphones\\". These headphones use Virtual Retinal Display to enhance the experience of the Oculus Rift. Some augmented reality devices fall under the category of wearables. Augmented reality glasses are currently in development by several corporations. Snap Inc.'s Spectacles are sunglasses that record video from the user's point of view and pair with a phone to post videos on Snapchat. Microsoft has also delved into this business, releasing Augmented Reality glasses, HoloLens, in 2017. The device explores using digital holography, or holograms, to give the user a first hand experience of Augmented Reality. These wearable headsets are used in many different fields including the military. Wearable technology has also expanded from small pieces of technology on the wrist to apparel all over the body. There is a shoe made by the company shiftwear that uses a smartphone application to periodically change the design display on the shoe. The shoe is designed using normal fabric but utilizes a display along the midsection and back that shows a design of your choice. The application was up by 2016 and a prototype for the shoes was created in 2017. Another example of this can be seen with Atari's headphone speakers. Atari and Audiowear are developing a face cap with built in speakers. The cap will feature speakers built into the underside of the brim, and will have Bluetooth capabilities. Jabra has released earbuds, in 2018, that cancel the noise around the user and can toggle a setting called \\"hearthrough.\\" This setting takes the sound around the user through the microphone and sends it to the user. This gives the user an augmented sound while they commute so they will be able to hear their surroundings while listening to their favorite music. Many other devices can be considered entertainment wearables and need only be devices worn by the user to experience media. = Gaming = The gaming industry has always incorporated new technology. The first technology used for electronic gaming was a controller for Pong. The way users game has continuously evolved through each decade. Currently, the two most common forms of gaming is either using a controller for video game consoles or a mouse and keyboard for PC games. In 2012, virtual reality headsets were reintroduced to the public. VR headsets were first conceptualized in the 1950s and officially created in the 1960s. The creation of the first virtual reality headset can be credited to Cinematographer Morton Heilig. He created a device known as the Sensorama in 1962. The Sensorama was a videogame like device that was so heavy that it needed to be held up by a suspension device. There has been numerous different wearable technology within the gaming industry from gloves to foot boards. The gaming space has offbeat inventions. In 2016 Sony debuted its first portable, connectable virtual reality headset codenamed Project Morpheus. The device was rebranded for PlayStation in 2018. Early 2019 Microsoft debut their HoloLens 2 that goes beyond just virtual reality into mixed reality headset. Their main focus is to be use mainly by the working class to help with difficult tasks. These headsets are used by educators, scientists, engineers, military personnel, surgeons, and many more. Headsets such as the HoloLens 2 allows the user to see a projected image at multiple angles and interact with the image. This helps gives a hands on experience to the user, which otherwise, they would not be able to get.  Fashion  Fashionable wearables are ‚Äúdesigned garments and accessories that combines aesthetics and style with functional technology.‚Äù Garments are the interface to the exterior mediated through digital technology. It allows endless possibilities for the dynamic customization of apparel. All clothes have social, psychological and physical functions. However, with the use of technology these functions can be amplified. There are some wearables that are called E-textiles. These are the combination of textiles(fabric) and electronic components to create wearable technology within clothing.E-textiles (this version) They are also known as smart textile and digital textile. Wearables are made from a functionality perspective or from an aesthetic perspective. When made from a functionality perspective, designers and engineers create wearables to provide convenience to the user. Clothing and accessories are used as a tool to provide assistance to the user. Designers and engineers are working together to incorporate technology in the manufacturing of garments in order to provide functionalities that can simplify the lives of the user. For example, through smartwatches people have the ability to communicate on the go and track their health. Moreover, smart fabrics have a direct interaction with the user, as it allows sensing the customers' moves. This helps to address concerns such as privacy, communication and well-being. Years ago, fashionable wearables were functional but not very aesthetic. As of 2018, wearables are quickly growing to meet fashion standards through the production of garments that are stylish and comfortable. Furthermore, when wearables are made from an aesthetic perspective, designers explore with their work by using technology and collaborating with engineers. These designers explore the different techniques and methods available for incorporating electronics in their designs. They are not constrained by one set of materials or colors, as these can change in response to the embedded sensors in the apparel. They can decide how their designs adapt and responds to the user. In 1967 French fashion designer Pierre Cardin, known for his futuristic designs created a collection of garments entitled \\"robe electronique\\" that featured a geometric embroidered pattern with LEDs (light emitting diodes). Pierre Cardin unique designs were featured in an episode of the Jetsons animated show where one of the main characters demonstrates how her luminous \\"Pierre Martian\\" dress works by plugging it into the mains. An exhibition about the work of Pierre Cardin was recently on display at the Brooklyn Museum in New York In 1968, the Museum of Contemporary Craft in New York City held an exhibition named Body Covering which presented the infusion of technological wearables with fashion. Some of the projects presented were clothing that changed temperature, and party dresses that light up and produce noises, among others. The designers from this exhibition creatively embedded electronics into the clothes and accessories to create these projects. As of 2018, fashion designers continue to explore this method in the manufacturing of their designs by pushing the limits of fashion and technology. = CuteCircuit = CuteCircuit pioneered the concept of interactive and app-controlled fashion with the creation in 2008 of the Galaxy Dress (part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, US) and in 2012 of the tshirtOS (now infinitshirt). CuteCircuit fashion designs can interact and change colour providing the wearer a new way of communicating and expressing their personality and style. CuteCircuit's designs have been worn on the red carpet by celebrities such as Katy Perry and Nicole Scherzinger. and are part of the permanent collections of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. = Project Jacquard = Project Jacquard, a Google project led by Ivan Poupyrev, has been combining clothing with technology. Google collaborated with Levi Strauss to create a jacket that has touch-sensitive areas that can control a smartphone. The cuff-links are removable and charge in a USB port. = Intel & Chromat = Intel partnered with the brand Chromat to create a sports bra that responds to changes in the body of the user, as well as a 3D printed carbon fiber dress that changes color based on the user's adrenaline levels. Intel also partnered with Google and TAG Heuer to make a smart watch. = Iris van Herpen = Iris Van Herpen's water dress Smart fabrics and 3D printing have been incorporated in high fashion by the designer Iris van Herpen. Van Herpen was the first designer to incorporate 3D printing technology of rapid prototyping into the fashion industry. The Belgian company Materialise NV collaborates with her in the printing of her designs. = Manufacturing Process of E-textiles = There are several methods which companies manufacture e-textiles from fiber to garment and the insertion of electronics to the process. One of the methods being developed is when stretchable circuits are printed right into a fabric using conductive ink. The conductive ink uses metal fragments in the ink to become electrically conductive. Another method would be using conductive thread or yarn. This development includes the coating of non-conductive fiber (like Polyester PET) with conductive material such as metal like gold or silver to produce coated yarns or in order to produce an e-textile. Common fabrication techniques for e-textiles include the following traditional methods: * Embroidery * Sewing * Weaving * Non-woven * Knitting * Spinning * Breading * Coating * Printing *Laying  Military  Wearable technology within the military ranges from educational purposes, training exercises and sustainability technology. The technology used for educational purposes within the military are mainly wearables that tracks a soldier's vitals. By tracking a soldier's heart rate, blood pressure, emotional status, etc. helps the research and development team best help the soldiers. According to chemist, Matt Coppock, he has started to enhance a soldier's lethality by collecting different biorecognition receptors. By doing so it will eliminate emerging environmental threats to the soldiers. With the emergence of virtual reality it is only natural to start creating simulations using VR. This will better prepare the user for whatever situation they are training for. In the military there are combat simulations that soldiers will train on. The reason the military will use VR to train its soldiers is because it is the most interactive/immersive experience the user will feels without being put in a real situation. Recent simulations include a soldier wearing a shock belt during a combat simulation. Each time they are shot the belt will release a certain amount of electricity directly to the user's skin. This is to simulate a shot wound in the most humane way possible. There are many sustainability technologies that military personnel wear in the field. One of which is a boot insert. This insert gauges how soldiers are carrying the weight of their equipment and how daily terrain factors impact their mission panning optimization. These sensors will not only help the military plan the best timeline but will help keep the soldiers at best physical/mental health.  Issues and Concerns  The FDA drafted a guidance for low risk devices advises that personal health wearables are general wellness products if they only collect data on weight management, physical fitness, relaxation or stress management, mental acuity, self-esteem, sleep management, or sexual function. This was due to the privacy risks that were surrounding the devices. As more and more of the devices were being used as well as improved soon enough these devices would be able to tell if a person is showing certain health issues and give a course of action. With the rise of these devices being consumed so to the FDA drafted this guidance in order to decrease risk of a patient in case the app doesn't function properly. It is argued the ethics of it as well because although they help track health and promote independence there is still an invasion of privacy that ensues to gain information. This is due to the huge amounts of data that has to be transferred which could raise issues for both the user and the companies if a third partied gets access to this data. There was an issue with the google glass that was used by surgeons in order to track vital signs of a patient where it had privacy issues relating to third party use of non-consented information. The issue is consent as well when it comes to wearable technology because it gives the ability to record and that is an issue when permission is not asked when a person is being recorded. Compared to smart phones, wearable devices pose several new reliability challenges to device manufacturers and software developers. Limited display area, limited computing power, limited volatile and non- volatile memory, non-conventional shape of the devices, abundance of sensor data, complex communication patterns of the apps, and limited battery size‚Äîall these factors can contribute to salient software bugs and failure modes. Moreover, since many of the wearable devices are used for health purposes (either monitoring or treatment), their accuracy and robustness issues can give rise to safety concerns. Some tools have been developed to evaluate the reliability and the security properties of these wearable devices. The early results point to a weak spot of wearable software whereby overloading of the devices, such as through high UI activity, can cause failures.

He was signed by the Chicago Bears as an undrafted free agent in 2010. He played college football at Virginia, where he played multiple positions for the Cavaliers. He was the starting quarterback and also served as a kick returner and holder. In 2007 and 2008, he played as a cornerback. Early years Hall was born on September 24, 1986 in Lynchburg, Virginia, US to parents Rochelle Hall and Victor Calloway. Vic Hall attended Gretna High School where he played football, baseball and basketball. He started for his team as a freshman in 2001 and recorded 14 touchdown passes and a combined 1,546 rushing and passing yards. As a sophomore, he recorded 2,184 passing yards, 20 passing touchdowns, 1,045 rushing yards, and 12 rushing touchdowns. During his junior year, he set a Virginia state record by recording 4,434 total offensive yards, which included 2,769 passing and 1,665 rushing yards. He led his team, Gretna, which set a Virginia High School League (VHSL) record in the 1990s for 43 straight losses, to a 14‚Äì0 record and the Group A state championship.GRETNA CAPS ITS REVERSAL, The Roanoke Times, December 14, 2003. Hall also had 31 passing touchdowns and 25 rushing touchdowns for a total of 56 touchdowns, the second- highest in state history at that time. As a senior, he broke the state record he set when he recorded 4,852 offensive yards. That season, Hall recorded 165 completions on 259 attempts, 2,851 passing yards, 38 passing touchdowns, 174 carries, 1,982 rushing yards, and 26 rushing touchdowns. He again led his team to the state championship and a 14-0 record in his senior year. Hall was named a first-team all-state quarterback three times and a SuperPrep All- American.Vic Hall Biography, University of Virginia, retrieved July 27, 2009. College career Hall chose to attend the University of Virginia. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in anthropology, and continued to pursue graduate studies while exhausting his college eligibility. He sat out the 2005 season as a redshirt. In 2006, head coach Al Groh moved Hall to cornerback, a position that lacked depth and for which Hall was suited with his athleticism and size. Nevertheless, it was an unusual decision considering Hall's record- setting interscholastic career as a quarterback.Cavs' Hall Starred at QB; Now He's on the Defensive, The Washington Post, p. E03, August 28, 2007. That year, Hall saw action in all 12 games as a reserve cornerback and on special teams as an outside gunner on punts. He recorded 13 tackles, including seven in punt coverage. In 2007, Hall started in all 13 games as a cornerback and again played on special teams, including as a holder and return specialist. He led the team's cornerbacks in tackles. Hall recorded 58 tackles, three broken- up passes, and one interception. He compiled 230 yards on punt returns and 33 yards on kickoff returns. Against Pittsburgh, he returned punts for 22 and 45 yards, each of which set up Virginia touchdowns on the subsequent possession. He also scored a touchdown on a fake field goal attempt. For his performance in that game, Hall was named the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) Specialist of the Week. Hall was named the team captain for the 2008 season and started in 11 games as a cornerback and one as a quarterback, and also handled punt and kick return and holding duties. Hall was the starting quarterback for the season's final game against Virginia Tech. He recorded 59 tackles and two interceptions on defense. As a quarterback, he accumulated one pass attempt, 109 rushing yards, and two rushing touchdowns. In 2009, head coach Al Groh hired Gregg Brandon as the offensive coordinator for the new spread offensive, which made Vic Hall the starting quarterback for the season. In the first game vs. William and Mary, Vic Hall was benched for Jameel Sewell who was the starting quarterback in 2007. After that, Al Groh moved Vic Hall back to cornerback, and then wide receiver where he was very successful. He was also the starting punt returner but was benched vs. William and Mary also. He recovered his starting return job vs. Boston College when he returned a 58-yard punt back for a touchdown, but it was called back for a penalty, and he kept the job for the rest of the season. Professional career=Chicago Bears= Hall was signed by the Chicago Bears as an undrafted free agent on April 26, 2010, with the intent to convert him to slot receiver. He was waived on July 21, 2010. =New York Jets= Hall would be signed by the New York Jets on August 2, 2010. On August 24, 2010, the Jets would waive Hall. =Chicago Rush= Hall signed with the Chicago Rush of the Arena Football League for the 2011 season. He was named the AFL's Defensive Player of the Week in Week 4 and the Co-Defensive Player of the Week again in Week 12. On June 4, 2011 Hall had three interceptions against the Kansas City Command, returning one for a touchdown. With it, he tied and broke the Arena Football League record for interceptions in a single season. Hall ended the year with 15 interceptions and two touchdowns despite missing the Rush's final four games of the year with an injury. It was the most interceptions in AFL history before Orlando Predators DB Rayshaun Kizer broke the mark in the final game of the 2011 season and finished the year with 16 picks.

Its energy sources consist of nuclear fuel, natural gas, purchased power, solar and wind turbines. The company owns six electrical generating facilities with a net dependable generating capability of approximately 2,010 megawatts. It serves approximately 400,000 residential, commercial, industrial, public authority, and wholesale customers. The company distributes electricity to retail customers principally in El Paso, Texas and Las Cruces, New Mexico; and resells electricity to electric utilities and power marketers. El Paso Electric Company was founded in 1901 and is based in El Paso, Texas. The company is headquartered at the Stanton Tower in Downtown El Paso. The company's Chief Executive Officer is Mr. Adrian J. Rodriguez. History An ad for electric fans by the El Paso Electric Railway Company, in the El Paso Herald, May 15, 1915 El Paso Electric (EPE) first began serving its customers on August 30, 1901. It was then known as the El Paso Electric Railway Company. Initially its primary business consisted of providing transportation via mule-drawn streetcars, which were replaced in 1902 with electric streetcars. The company is reported to have provided electricity to Nikola Tesla's property in Colorado. By 1925, the company's core business had evolved to producing and distributing electricity. That year, the company changed its name to the El Paso Electric Company. It was also granted authorization to transact business in New Mexico. Today, El Paso Electric is a regional electric utility providing generation, transmission, and distribution service to approximately 400,000 retail and wholesale customers in a area of the Rio Grande valley in west Texas and southern New Mexico. Its service territory extends from Hatch, New Mexico to Van Horn, Texas. As of 2013, El Paso Electric had 32 electric car charging stations in its service area. The service stations recharge Nissan Leafs, Chevrolet Volts, and other electric cars. The company is also working to expand adoption of electric vehicles through its Plug-in Electric Vehicle and Charging Infrastructure Plan (PEVCIP) for the Rio Grande Valley region. Transmission system Stanton Tower is the corporate office for El Paso Electric. El Paso Electric transmission system voltages are 115,000 volts and 345,000 volts. There are also two 115 kV interconnections with Mexico to the south. Generating plants El Paso Electric ownership in power plants include a 15.8 percent interest in the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station near Tonopah, Arizona, the Rio Grande Power Station in Sunland Park, New Mexico, the Newman Power Station, the Copper Power Station and the Montana Power Station in El Paso and the Hueco Mountain Wind Ranch in Hudspeth County, Texas. On February 20, 2014 El Paso Electric signed an agreement with Colorado-based Juwi Solar, Inc., to build a 10 megawatt (MW) solar energy facility in Northeast El Paso next to EPE's Newman Generation Station. JSI will be responsible for developing, designing, building, and operating the Newman Solar project. The design phase will begin in early summer of this year, shortly followed by construction and final completion of the project tentatively scheduled for the end of 2014. The construction of the new solar facility will help power over 3,800 homes throughout the year. The facility will be built on approximately 100 acres. EPE will sublease the land in partnership with the El Paso Water Utilities (EPWU) and currently leased to EPE for the Newman Generation Station. EPE currently has 47 MWs of solar power in its generation mix and recently secured an additional 50 MWs of solar power that will be online by the summer of this year. In total, 5 percent of EPE's dedicated generation, which includes long- term purchase power agreements, will come from solar energy. Lawsuits In January, 2003, a complaint was filed against EI Paso Electric alleging that the company issued materially false and misleading information by misrepresenting and/or omitting adverse facts concerning illegal arrangements with Enron Corporation and by artificially inflating revenues. A settlement of $10,000,000 was reached in 2005.

This device gives the illusion of two mountains; a gold one and a blue one. The gold mountain (the chevron) is charged with a scattering (sem√©) of red crosses to represent the bishop's home city of Pasto, in southwestern Colombia, which is known as \\"The Theological City.\\" The lower mountain (part of the blue field) has a golden lion's head to represent the evangelist Saint Mark, who is the titular patron of the parish in Clarkesville, Georgia, on a mountain, where Bishop Zarama served as pastor. Above the chevron are a gold rose for Saint Th√©r√®se of the Child Jesus, also known as \\"The Little Flower,\\" and a silver (white) lily for Saint Joseph, the Foster Father of Jesus, who have served as Bishop Zarama's particular patrons throughout his life as a priest and now as a bishop. Zarama has selected for his motto the Latin phrase Deus Caritas Est (God is love), the title of an encyclical by Pope Benedict XVI, and it sums up in a succinct statement all that the Church and Christianity are to be all about sharing the love of God. The achievement is completed with the external ornaments which are a gold episcopal processional cross, that is placed in back of and which extends above and below the shield, and the pontifical hat, called a \\"galero,\\" with its six tassels, in three rows, on either side of the shield, all in green.

In 2019 36% of all Australians (or a approximately 9.2 million) had used cannabis in their lifetime and 11.6% (or approximately 3 million) had used cannabis in the last 12 months. Australia has one of the highest cannabis prevalence rates in the world.The country has largely focused on punitive policy in relation to drug laws and has avoided successful harm minimisation strategies, a growing body of evidence and inquiries in Australia indicate that this tough on drugs prohibition approach actually creates more harm than it is preventing. This has led, in recent years, to politicians increasing support towards the legalisation of both recreational and medicinal cannabis, although overall support from major parties is still towards the current punitive approach. On 24 February 2016, Australia legalised medicinal cannabis at the federal level. On 12 November 2017 Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) made Low THC Hemp food legal for human consumption in Australia. On 25 September 2019, the Australia Capital Territory passed a bill allowing for possession and growth of small amounts of cannabis for personal use as of 31 January 2020, although the laws conflict with federal laws which prohibit recreational use of cannabis and the supply of cannabis and cannabis seeds are not allowed under the changes. Attitudes towards legalising recreational cannabis in Australia are shifting dramatically more Australians now support legalisation of cannabis than those who remain opposed, 41% of Australians now support the legalisation of cannabis 37% remain opposed and 22% remain undecided. There have also been some associated changes in public perceptions about other cannabis-related policies. For example, the majority of Australians aged 14 years and over do not support the possession of cannabis being a criminal offence (74% in 2016 compared with 66% in 2010). History=Early history= The first record of common hemp seeds brought to Australia was with the First Fleet at the request of Sir Joseph Banks, who marked the cargo \\"for commerce\\" in the hope that hemp would be produced commercially in the new colony. For 150 years early governments in Australia actively supported the growing of hemp with gifts of land and other grants,The Australian Marijuana Grower's Guide. Otter Publications, Redfern NSW (1996) and the consumption of cannabis in Australia in the 19th century was believed to be widespread.Jiggens, J. True Hemp in AustraliaCharlier, P. Hemp in British and Australian Colonial History Marcus Clarke, author of the great Australian novel For the Term of his Natural Life, experimented with cannabis as an aid to writing. A short story he wrote, Cannabis Indica, was written under the influence of cannabis; members of Melbourne's bohemian Yorrick Club (of which Clarke was a member) were notorious cannabis users. Until the late 19th century, \\"Cigares De Joy\\" (cannabis cigarettes) were widely available; these claimed to \\"give immediate relief in cases of asthma, cough, bronchitis, hay-fever, influenza [and] shortness of breath\\". Like many developed nations Australia first responded to the issue of cannabis use in the 1920s, acting as a signatory to the 1925 Geneva Convention on Opium and Other Drugs that saw the use of cannabis restricted for medicinal and scientific purposes only. Cannabis was grouped with morphine, cocaine and heroin, despite cannabis' rare use as a medicine or remedy in Australia at the time.Makkai, T., McAllister, I. (1997) Marijuana in Australia: Patterns and attitudes. Looking Glass Press, Canberra. This prohibition model was applied with little research into cannabis use in Australia. Most drug-related laws enacted by jurisdictions of Australia during this time were related to opiumMcDonald, D., Moore, R., Norberry, J., Wardlaw, G. and Ballenden, N. (1994). Legislative options for cannabis in Australia, Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra but, as a result of pressure from the United Kingdom, Australia began implementing local laws consistent with the Geneva Convention. According to McDonald and others, in 1928 the state of Victoria enacted legislation that prohibited the use of cannabis; other states followed suit slowly over the next three decades. As in other Western countries, cannabis use was perceived as a significant social problem in Australia; new drug control laws were enacted at the state and federal level, and penalties for drug offences were increased.McLaren, J., Mattick, R. P., Cannabis in Australia: Use, supply, harms, and responses (2006). Monograph series No. 57. Report prepared for Drug Strategy Branch, Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales In 1938, cannabis was outlawed in Australia as a result of a Reefer Madness-style shock campaign; the newspaper Smith's Weekly carried a headline reading \\"New Drug that Maddens Victims\\".Jiggens, J (2008) The Origins of Marijuana Prohibition in Australia, StickyPoint Magazine Issue 08 This campaign introduced the word \\"marijuana\\" to Australia, describing it as \\"an evil sex drug that causes its victims to behave like raving sex maniacs\\", \\"the dreaded sex drug marijuana\\" and \\"The Biggest Gateway Drug\\". The campaign was only moderately successful; it failed to instill the generation with false negative effects of the drug and its impact on society, it did not stop an increase in demand and usage. = 1960s = The 1960s saw an increase in the use of cannabis, heroin and LSD as part of political and social opposition to the Vietnam War, and this resulted in most Australian states gradually moving to a prohibitionist and criminal- justice orientation.Campbell, A (2001).

National Library of Australian Cataloguing. Right-wing Australian politicians like Queensland premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen and NSW premier Robert Askin supported Nixon's War on Drugs in America, calling for a crackdown on Australian youth culture. Following the fall of the Whitlam government in 1975, these politicians launched a Nixon-style war on drugs in Australia.Jiggens, J (2005). The Cost of Drug Prohibition in Australia. Paper presented to the Social Change in the 21st Century Conference, Centre for Social Change Research, Queensland University of Technology. In the late 1960s, organised drug trafficking developed in Sydney with the arrival of US servicemen on leave from the Vietnam War, and the local drug markets expanded to meet their requirements. The 1970s were considered the first \\"decade of drugs\\", marked by the public's growing financial capacity to support drug use and an increase in young people affected by unemployment. As a result, the 1970s were also the decade of Royal Commissions and inquiries to deal with the \\"drug problem\\". In 1964, with the discovery of hundreds of acres of wild hemp growing in the Hunter Valley in NSW, authorities responded with a massive eradication campaign. However, the baby-boomers of the 60s responded to the \\"evil threat\\" in a very different manner to the previous generation, with groups of surfers and hippies flocking to the Hunter Region in search of the wild weed which was described in reports as \\"a powerful psychoactive aphrodisiac\\".Brady, P (200). Emerald buds in the land of Oz Marijuana Magazine These groups became known as the Weed Raiders‚Äîlegendary characters, bearing tales of plants up to three metres tall. =1970s to 2000= In 1973, tribes of hippies attended the Aquarius Festival in the Northern NSW town of Nimbin. When police tried to arrest revellers who were openly smoking marijuana, the crowd of 6,000 rioted. Nimbin is home to the Hemp Embassy, founded by activist pioneer Michael Balderstone, and the MardiGrass, an annual festival dedicated to cannabis which began in 1993. According to Jiggens,Jiggens, J (2007) In a Time of Murder ‚Äì The Murder of Don Mackay, StickyPoint Magazine Issue 02 by 1977 there was again talk of decriminalisation of cannabis in New South Wales, following the decriminalisation of cannabis in nine US states. The Joint Committee upon Drugs of the NSW Parliament recommended the removal of jail sentences for personal use of cannabis, and NSW Premier Neville Wran outlined a plan to remove jail sentences for people convicted and for possessing cannabis for personal use. He said that cannabis use was widespread and that \\"tens of thousands of parents whose sons and daughters smoke marijuana\\" would not want their children to carry \\"the stigma of being a jailed, convicted criminal\\". The disappearance of local political and community leader Donald Mackay in Griffith, NSW, in July 1977 placed the issue of the nexus between illicit drug production, organised crime and police corruption before the public; this was due to Mackay's revelations about large-scale marijuana growing in the Riverina area. His inquiries led to the largest cannabis seizure in Australian history at Coleambally, south of Griffith, in November 1975. The plantation spread over and was estimated to be capable of producing 60 tonnes of cannabis. The NSW Royal Commission into Drug Trafficking (the Woodward Inquiry) was sparked by Mackay's disappearance, and the story was brought to life as an acclaimed television miniseries Underbelly: A Tale of Two Cities. In August 1976, NSW Police conducted a predawn raid on the Tuntable Falls Co- operative, located just south of Nimbin; a few weeks later, the Cedar Bay commune, located in far northern Queensland, was raided by Queensland Police. Joh Bjelke-Petersen defended the police action (including the burning of houses on the commune), declaring he was \\"tough on drugs\\". His accomplice in the Cedar Bay raid was the young John Howard (then Minister for Business), who later served as Prime Minister from 1996 to 2007. This would develop into an international news story. In terms of the broader population, cannabis was not widely used in Australia until the 1970s. Legislation reflected increased usage of cannabis; in 1985, the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse was introduced, which was an assessment of illicit drug use among the general population. Prior to 1985, it was concluded that cannabis use amongst Australians rose from the early 1970s throughout the 1980s.Donnelly, N., Hall, W. (1994) Patterns of cannabis use in Australia, Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra In 1994 the Australian National Task Force on Cannabis noted that the social harm of cannabis prohibition was greater than the harm from cannabis itself. Donnelly and Hall report that in a survey conducted in 1973, 22% of Australians aged 20‚Äì29 years reported ever using cannabis. This rose to 56% in 1985, and school surveys show a marked increase in cannabis use during the 1970s and 1980s. The rise in the use of cannabis continued into the 1990s with the 1998 household survey recording the highest prevalence of cannabis use, with 39% of those surveyed using cannabis at least once and 18% reporting cannabis use in the past year.Adhikari, P., Summerill, A. (2000) 1998 National Drug Strategy Household Survey: Detailed findings. AIHW cat. no. PHE 27. Canberra, AIHW By 2001, the lifetime rate had fallen to one-third of the population. The 1978 NSW Joint Parliamentary Committee Upon Drugs supported the decriminalisation of cannabis; under the proposal, personal use of cannabis would no longer be an offence and users would be given bonds and probation. Trafficking in cannabis would carry severe penalties. However, the 1979 Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs recommended against decriminalisation, concluding that such a step would contravene the UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs and lead to calls for the decriminalisation of other drugs. The recommendation was that the consideration of decriminalisation be delayed for another 10 years. In 1985, against a backdrop of growing awareness at community and government levels of illicit drug use at a national level, the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse (NCADA) was established. Since 1985, the national drug policy in Australia has been based on the principle of criminalisation and harm minimisation; the National Campaign against Drug Abuse has since become the National Drug Strategy. The National Cannabis Strategy 2006‚Äì2009 was endorsed in 2006. = 2000 ‚Äì 2012 = According to Donnelly and Hall, although changes in willingness to divulge illicit drug use and changing survey protocol and design are likely to have contributed to the change in observed prevalence, the extent and consistency of the increase suggests that an actual rise in cannabis use has occurred. Various polls conducted suggest that the Australian public support legalizing marijuana. http://www.abc.net.au/news/thedrum/polls/#p=1&pp;=500 The 2001 Report of the International Narcotics Control Board noted that hydroponic cultivation of cannabis in Australia was increasing, as outdoor cultivation was decreasing. Currently, there is increasing interest in hemp in Australia. A recent case in the media details a hemp grower on the Northern Beaches of Sydney who has legally grown 500 plants in his backyard.Elliot, T., (2010) Weed is good ‚Äì hemp comes to the city. Sydney Morning Herald, Sydney. The Sydney Morning Herald describes cultivator Richard Friar as a hemp evangelist‚Äîa firm believer in the world-changing potential of cannabis, which can be used in everything from food to fabrics and building materials. With permission from the NSW Department of Primary Industries, Friar and his wife are part of a pilot project aimed at educating farmers to the benefits of growing hemp for its by- products from food to fabric. The author also notes that, in December 2009, Friar applied to Food Standards Australia New Zealand for permission to sell the seed for human consumption; approval is expected. In 2012, hemp seeds and protein are readily available for purchase in health food stores, but with labels that say the product is not for human consumption. = 2012 ‚Äì 2020 = On 17 October 2015, the Federal Government announced that it would legalise the growing of cannabis for medicinal and scientific purposes. On 24 February 2016, the Australian parliament made amendments to the Narcotic Drugs Act that legalised the growing of cannabis for medicinal and scientific purposes. Subsequently, the usage of medicinal cannabis was legalised at the federal level on 1 November 2016. On the of 12 November 2017 Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) made Low THC Hemp food legal for human consumption in Australia. On the 9th of May 2018, Senator David Leyonhjelm introduced a Bill to allow states to remove Commonwealth barriers to the legalisation, regulation and taxation of cannabis, Senator Leyonhjelm‚Äôs main argument against the prohibition of cannabis use was that ‚Äòadults should be free to make their own choices as long as they do not harm others‚Äô. Senator Leyonhjelm had previously expressed his support for the greens plan to legalise cannabis the previous month before introducing the bill, both major parties at the time and One Nation did not support the bill.The bill lapsed at the end of parliament on the 01 July 2019 after the second debate on 15 October 2018. On the 27 of November 2018 The Australian Greens introduce The Australian Cannabis Agency Bill to regulate the production and distribution of recreational cannabis.Senator Richard Di Natale said \\"it was more harmful to continue banning the use of cannabis, calling on Australia to \\"get real\\". And that \\"As someone who was a drug and alcohol doctor, I've seen how damaging the tough on drugs approach is to people\\". On the 31 of May 2019 the Victorian legislative council instructed the Legal and Social Issues Committee to open a broad-ranging inquiry to examine access to and use of cannabis in Victoria, such as ways to prevent children and young people accessing and using cannabis, prevent criminal activity relating to the illegal cannabis trade in Victoria and protecting public health and public safety in relation to the use of cannabis in Victoria. The committee was also instructed to assess successful models from international jurisdictions and consider how the outcomes may be adapted for Victoria. The committee opened submissions from the public on 18 May 2020 with a closing date for submissions of 31 August 2020.The committee is due to report by 31 March 2021 In the Australian Capital Territory, after a bill was passed on 25 September 2019, new laws came into effect on 31 January 2020 which allowed for possession of up to 50 grams of dry material, 150 grams of wet material, and cultivation of 2 plants per individual up to 4 plants per household, effectively legalising the possession and growing of cannabis in the ACT. However the sale and supply of cannabis and cannabis seeds is still illegal, so the effects of the laws are limited and the laws also contradict federal laws. It is also still illegal to smoke or use cannabis in a public place, expose a child or young person to cannabis smoke, store cannabis where children can reach it, grow cannabis using hydroponics or artificial cultivation, grow plants where they can be accessed by the public, share or give cannabis as a gift to another person, to drive with any cannabis in your system, or for people aged under 18 to grow, possess, or use cannabis. Tue 15 Oct 2019 Cate Faehrmann of the Australian Greens, gave a Notice of Motion to introduce the Cannabis Industry Bill 2019 to legalise cannabis and cannabis products; to regulate the sale, supply and advertising of cannabis and cannabis products; and for other purposes in New South Wales. On the 14 of November 2019, the Senate referred an inquiry titled the current barriers around patient access to the Senate Community Affairs Reference Committee, On 26 March 2020 the inquiry recommend amnesty for \\"possession and/or cultivation of cannabis for genuine self medication purposes\\". In 2019 the Queensland government instructed the Queensland Productivity Commission to conduct an enquiry into imprisonment and recidivism in QLD, the final report was sent to the Queensland Government on 1 August 2019 and publicly released on 31 January 2020. The commission found that \\"all available evidence shows the war on drugs fails to restrict usage or supply\\" and that \\"decriminalisation would improve the lives of drug users without increasing the rate of drug use\\" with the commission ultimately recommending that the Queensland government legalise cannabis. The QPC said the system had also fuelled an illegal market, particularly for methamphetamine. Although the Palaszczuk Queensland Labor Party led state government rejected the recommendations of its own commission and said it had no plans to alter any laws around cannabis,a decision that received heavy scrutiny from supporters of decriminalization, legalisation, progressive and non progressive drug policy advocates alike. Usage According to J. Copeland from the NCPIC and others,Copeland, J., Gerber, S., Dillon, P., and Swift, W., (2006) Cannabis: answers to your questions. National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales. cannabis in Australia is commonly smoked as a cluster (or \\"cone\\", similar to \\"bowls\\" as known in the United States) of the flowering heads (buds) or resin glands (also known as hashish) of the female plant. Typically, cannabis is smoked using a bong, pipe or joint. Cannabis can be baked into foods such as butter to be used in recipes such as cakes and brownies. There is an increasing prevalence of electric vapourisers for inhalation of the drug. Cannabis is also consumed as cannabis oil. Cannabis was not commonly used in Australia until the 1970s. Since then it has gradually increased until the late 1990s when it was at its highest usage. It is the most commonly used illicit drug in Australia. In the early 2000s patterns of use are similar to those throughout the developed world with heaviest use occurring in the early 20s, followed by a steady decline into the 30s. Ninety percent of experimental or social recreational users of cannabis do not go on to use the substance daily or for a prolonged period; most discontinue its use by their late 20s.Solowij N., Grenyer F.S., (2002). Are the adverse consequences of cannabis use age-dependent? Addiction, Volume 97, Issue 9, Page 108, September 2002In recent years evidence shows a larger proportion of older Australians are choosing to use cannabis,showing Australians are more likely to start using cannabis again or for the first time at an older age and more people are choosing to discontinue use at a later age or are not discontinuing use at all. = Consumption = 2010-2020 Cannabis continues to be the world‚Äôs most widely used illicit drug, with an estimated annual prevalence of 3.8% of the adult population aged 15‚Äì64 years, or the equivalent of 188 million people (ranging between 164 to 219 million) having used cannabis at least once in 2017 (UNODC 2019). 50x50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Attribution 3.0 Australia (CC BY 3.0 AU) license. The 2019 NDSHS showed that for people aged 14 and over in Australia 36% (approximately 9.2 million) had used cannabis in their lifetime, up 1% from 2016 and 11.6% (approximately 3 million) had used cannabis recently up 1.2% since 2016. * The average age range of initiation for people who use cannabis was 18.9 (mean) or 17.2 (median) * The median age of people who used cannabis was 26 in 2001 and increased to 31 in 2019 * The age group most likely to use recently was 20-29 * People are also using cannabis more frequently since 2016 with the percentage of people who use cannabis daily increasing from 36% in 2016 to 37% in 2019, the percentage of people who used cannabis once a month increased from 12.1% to 12.8%, the percentage of people who used cannabis every few months increased from 17.3% to 17.8% and the percentage of people who used cannabis once or twice a year fell from 34% to 32%. The 2016 NDSHS showed that cannabis continues to have the highest reported prevalence of lifetime and recent consumption among the general population, compared with other illicit drugs (Tables S2.31 and S2.32). * For people aged 14 and over in Australia in 2016, 35% (or approximately 8.9 million) had used cannabis in their lifetime and 10.4% (or 2.1 million) used cannabis in the prior 12 months (Figure CANNABIS1). * Recent and lifetime use of cannabis has remained relatively stable over the past decade but there were some statistically significant changes among different age groups (AIHW 2017) (Tables S2.38 and S2.39). * 2000 - 2010 According to the 2007 National Drug Strategy Household Survey,2007 National Drug Strategy Household Survey (April 2008); The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Canberra. cannabis was used at least once by one-third of all Australians aged 14 years or older, and 1.6 million people reported using cannabis in the preceding 12 months. Of 12- to 15-year-olds, 2.7% reported using cannabis in the previous 12 months, compared with 15% of 16- and 17-year-olds and 19% of 18- and 19-year-olds. Results indicate that males aged 14 years or older were slightly more likely than their female counterparts to have ever used cannabis (37.1% versus 30.0%), and one in five teenagers aged 14 to 19 reported having used cannabis. This difference is seen across all age groups except the 14- to 19-year-olds, in which there is little difference between males and females in terms of lifetime and past-year use. Of the entire population, those aged 30 to 39 years were the most likely (54.6%) to have used cannabis at some time in their lives. According to McLaren and Mattick, the lower proportion of cannabis use among older age groups compared with younger users is even more striking when recent use is assessed; males aged 14 and older were more likely than corresponding females to have used cannabis in the previous 12 months (1.0 million and 0.6 million, respectively). 12.9% of teenagers aged 14 to 19 had used cannabis in the previous 12 months; those aged 20 to 29 were the most likely age group to have used cannabis in the previous 12 months, with one in five having done so. According to Hall,Hall, W. (2000) Cannabis use and public health: Assessing the burden. Addiction, 95, 485‚Äì490 although rates of cannabis use are considerable, most people who use cannabis do so infrequently. According to the 2004 household survey,2004 National Drug Strategy Household Survey (April 2005); The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Canberra. http://www.aihw.gov.au/publications/index.cfm/title/10122 approximately half of all recent cannabis users used the drug less than once a month. However, the proportion of recent cannabis users who use cannabis every day is not considered trivial; it is cited at 16% by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. Those aged 30 to 39 were most likely to use cannabis every day. The 2004 household survey also shows that of all respondents who used cannabis on a regular basis, the average number of cones or joints smoked on any one day was 3.2. Statistics show that between 1995 and 2007 (after peaking in 1998), the proportion of both males and females aged 14 years or older who had used cannabis in the previous 12 months declined steadily. Between 2004 and 2007, the decline was significant. Recent cannabis use dropped steadily since 1998 and significantly between 2004 and 2007‚Äîfrom 11.3% to 9.1%, the lowest proportion seen since 1993. Cross-sectional analysis of household survey data shows the age of initiation into cannabis is decreasing over time. According to the Mental Health Council of Australia in 2006,Where there's smoke‚Ä¶ Cannabis and Mental Health (2006) Mental Health Council of Australia. the average age of first use for 12‚Äì to 19-year-olds was 14.9 years‚Äîsignificantly lower than in previous years. The percentage of school aged students admitting to past year Cannabis use reduced from 32% in 1996 to 14% in 2005.Roxburgh, A., Hall, W., Degenhardt, L., McLaren, J., Black, E., Copeland, J., & Mattick, R.

Addiction Research and Theory, Taylor & Francis, Volume 12, Number 3 / June 2004. Pages 261 ‚Äì 274. Studies that do provide information on cannabis use within the indigenous population show pattern of problematic cannabis abuse that exceeds that seen in the mainstream non-indigenous population. A survey conducted in the mid-1980s by Watson and othersWatson C., Fleming J., Alexander K. (1988), A Survey of Drug Use Patterns in Northern Territory Aboriginal Communities: 1986‚Äì1987. Northern Territory Department of Health and Community Services, Darwin. failed to detect any cannabis use in Top End indigenous communities. However, by the late 1990s the Aboriginal Research Council provided information suggesting that cannabis was used by 31% of males and 8% of females in eastern Arnhem Land. A further study in 2002 found that cannabis was being used regularly by 67% of males and 22% of females aged 13 to 36. A survey about drug use conducted in 1997 of two NSW populations of Aboriginal Australians found that 38% had used Cannabis.Abel, Sally. 'Cannabis Policy in Australia And New Zealand'. Drug and Alcohol Review 16.4 (1997): 421-428. Web. As part of the 2004 National Drug Strategy, a survey was conducted assessing drug use among indigenous populations living in urban areas. Results showed that 48% had tried cannabis at least once, and 22% had used cannabis in the previous year. Regular cannabis use (at least weekly) was also more common among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island communities than non-indigenous groups (11% and 4%, respectively). The 2018‚Äì19 NDSHS asked Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged 14 and over were whether they had used illicit substances in the last 12 months, 5.5% had used cannabis in the last 12 months‚Äîalmost 1.3 times higher than non-Indigenous Australians (12.0%). The data describing cannabis use in the indigenous population compared with non-indigenous use varies in the ratio of recent cannabis use to those respondents who have ever used cannabis. In the non-indigenous population, rates of cannabis use in the last 12 months are a third of those ever using cannabis; however, researchers found only a few percentage-points' difference between rates of regular and lifetime use within the indigenous population. According to McLaren and Mattick, the reasons for high rates of cannabis use among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities are complex and likely to be related to the social determinants of drug use. Risk factors associated with harmful substance use are often related to poor health and social well-being, stemming from the alienation and dispossession experienced by this population. Spooner and Hetherington confirm that many of the social determinants of harmful substance abuse are disproportionately present in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.Spooner, C. and Hetherington, K. (2005) Social determinants of drug use. NDARC technical report No. 228 Sydney, National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, 23 University of New South Wales. In June 2020, it was revealed that New South Wales Police had pursued criminal charges against more than 82% of Indigenous people caught with small amounts of cannabis, compared with only 52% of non-indigenous people. In other words, Indigenous people were very likely to get criminally charged, while non-Indigenous people were more likely to receive only a warning. The data was obtained by The Guardian using freedom of information laws. = Synthetic cannabinoids = Before June 2011, synthetic cannabinoids were relatively unknown in Australia. However, compulsory employee drug tests at Western Australian mines found that 1 in 10 employees had consumed compounds found in synthetic marijuana. Synthetic marijuana is known as a recreational drug that mimics the effects of cannabis. Its popular usage as opposed to naturally-grown marijuana was attributed to the fact that users could obtain a \\"legal high\\", as the compounds in synthetic marijuana were not yet listed as illegal on the Australian Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons [SUSMP] ‚Äì the governing body of drug listing in Australia. As a result of such, the Western Australian government banned the seven most commonly detected synthetic cannabinoids, followed suit by the federal government in July that year, but the ban lapsed in October 2013. Due to its popularity among recreational drug users, health professionals began researching the drug. As a result of a study by the Drug and Alcohol Review, it was found that 291 of 316 participants reported side effects in an online survey pertaining to the patterns of synthetic marijuana use. These side-effects included panic, vomiting, depression and psychosis and some felt the side effects were serious enough to consider seeking medical assistance. An additional study conducted with the assistance of the UNSW, found that of 1100 self-reported synthetic drug users, 10% of individuals who had admitted to trying synthetic marijuana felt they were going to die, and 75% said they wouldn't try it again. People who use large quantities of synthetic cannabis may become sedated or disoriented and may experience toxic psychosis ‚Äì not knowing who they are, where they are, or what time it is. High doses may also cause fluctuating emotions, fragmentary thoughts, paranoia, panic attacks, hallucinations and feelings of unreality. Legislation and policy In 1913 Australia signed the International Hague Convention on Narcotics, and extended importation controls over drugs other than opium. 1921 saw the first international drug treaty (The Opium Convention), and in 1925 the Geneva Convention on Opium and Other Drugs saw restrictions imposed on the manufacture, importation, sale, distribution, exportation and use of cannabis, opium, cocaine, morphine and heroin for medical and scientific purposes only. In 1926 the Commonwealth Government banned the importation of cannabis; in 1928 Victoria passed the Poisons Act and became the first state to control cannabis, followed by South Australia (1934), NSW (1935), Queensland (1937), Western Australia (1950) and Tasmania (1959). In 1940 the Commonwealth extended import restrictions on Indian hemp, including preparations containing hemp. In 1961 Australia signed the International Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs This convention supports an obligation to make cannabis available as a medicine. On 24 February 2016, the Australian parliament made amendments to the Narcotic Drugs Act that legalised the growing of cannabis for medicinal and scientific purposes.https://www.corneyandlind.com.au/resource- centre/medical-marijuana-_legalised/ On 12 November 2017 Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) made Low THC Hemp food legal for human consumption in Australia. According to the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy, the National Drug Strategy and its substance-specific strategies were written for the general population of Australia. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Complementary Action Plan 2003‚Äì2006 was developed as a supplement to the national action plans so that these plans could be applied to Australia's indigenous communities. At a national level, there is no overriding law that deals with cannabis-related offences; instead, each state and territory enacts its own legislation. According to Copeland and others, while some jurisdictions enforce criminal penalties for possession, use and supply, others enact civil penalties for minor cannabis offences. Conviction for a criminal offence will attract a criminal record and can be punishable by jail time and harsh fines. Civil penalties, however, do not result in a criminal record and are generally handled by lesser fines, mandatory treatment and diversion programmes. = Australian states and territories = In the Australian Capital Territory, after the Drugs of Dependence (Personal Cannabis Use) Amendment Bill 2018 was passed on 25 September 2019, new laws came into effect on 31 January 2020, possession of small amounts of cannabis and one or two plants remains an offence under the Drugs of Dependence Act, however the Act creates exceptions for persons aged over the age of eighteen, allowing for possession of up to 50 grams of dry material, 150 grams of wet material, and cultivation of 2 plants per individual and up to 4 plants per household, legalising the possession and growth of small amounts of cannabis under the Territories law, although the territory laws contradict with federal laws. Those under the age of 18 are not exempt people under the amendments and police officers hold ultimate direction to issue persons under the age of 18 a SCON(Simple Cannabis Offence Notice) or divert them to a drug and alcohol diversion program, If the SCON fine is paid within 60 days with no conviction will be recorded, failure to pay the penalty order may result in proceedings before the court.Under the changes it is also still prohibited to smoke or use cannabis in a public place, expose a child or young person to cannabis smoke, store cannabis where children can reach it, grow cannabis using hydroponics or artificial cultivation, grow plants where they can be accessed by the public, share or give cannabis as a gift to another person, or to drive with any cannabis in your system, for people aged under 18 to grow, possess, or use cannabis. In South Australia Under the Expiation of Offences Act 1996, for persons over the age of 18 years, simple cannabis offences, that is, cultivating one cannabis plant without artificial enhancement, possession of up to 100 grams of cannabis, possession of up to 20 grams of cannabis resin, consuming cannabis (except in a public place) and possession of smoking implements can be expiated by a police officer, given in lieu of prosecution a fine, to be paid within 28 days and may relate to up to three offences arising from the same incident. If an expiation notice is not paid charges typically carry a $500-$1000 maximum fine and the possibility of a criminal conviction being recorded. Supply and low-level cultivation offences carry a maximum $2000 fine and/or 2 years imprisonment. Trafficking, sale, and/or cultivation or a commercial or ‚Äòlarge commercial‚Äô quantity carry a maximum penalty of up to $200,000 and 25 years imprisonment. In Western Australia, as of August 2011: a person found in possession of ten grams or less of cannabis may receive a Cannabis Intervention Requirement notice to attend a mandatory one on one counselling session. Persons over 18 can only receive one CIR, while a young person (aged 14-17 years) can receive two. Subsequent minor cannabis-related offences will be prosecuted through the courts. Quantities larger than ten grams attract a penalty of upto A$2000 or two years in jail, or both. A person found in possession of more than 100g of cannabis would be deemed to have that quantity for supply and could face a penalty of A$20,000 or two years in jail. It is also illegal for cannabis smoking implements to be displayed in shops or sold, with fines up to A$10,000 for sales to adults and jail for up to two years or a fine of up to A$24,000 for selling to minors. Opposing political sides have accused the government of changing the laws to appear tough on drugs in response to an increased public fear of clandestine drug labs following a number of them exploding in suburban areas, such as the Lilac Pass Incident. In Queensland, under the Drugs Misuse Regulation Act 1987, possession of cannabis or any schedule 1 or 2 drug carries a maximum prison sentence of 15 years and is a criminal offence. Possession of smoking paraphernalia is also a criminal offence in Queensland. Under the Police Powers and Responsibilities Act of 2000 a person who admits to carrying under 50 g (and is not committing any other offence) may be offered a drug diversion program if it is their first offence at the officers discretion. In Queensland, it is an criminal offence to give, distribute, sell, administer, transport or supply a dangerous drug. If drugs are located in a person‚Äôs house, car, or other place of which they are the occupier, then they are 'deemed' to be in possession of the drug unless they can prove otherwise. Importation and trafficking of dangerous drugs are each offences that carry maximum penalties of life imprisonment. In New South Wales under section 21 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 possession of cannabis is a criminal offence and carries a maximum penalty of up to 2 years imprisonment, and/or a fine of up to $2,200. If an individual is caught with up to 15 g of cannabis, at police discretion they may be diverted to a drug and alcohol diversion program, up to two diversions can be issued. Under Section 333 of the NSW Criminal Procedure Act (1986) police have the discretion to issue a penalty notice of $400. NSW police also operate a cannabis cautioning scheme, if a person admits to being in possession of 15 grams or less of cannabis for personal use, who has had no previous convictions for violent, drug or sexual assault related offences and who is not also involved in another criminal offence at the time may be let off with a caution, at the officers discretion, an individual may only receive two cautious. Manufacturing or cultivating commercial quantities of cannabis carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and/or a $550,000 fine. Smaller, but indictable quantities carry a maximum penalty of 15-20 years and $220,000-$385,000. Manufacturing or cultivating less than the indictable quantity of cannabis has a maximum penalty of $11000 and/or 2 years imprisonment. In Tasmania under the MISUSE OF DRUGS ACT 2001 possession of cannabis is a criminal offence, a court diversion program operates in the state, up to three cautions can be issued for possession of up to 50 g of cannabis, with a hierarchy of intervention and referrals for treatment with each caution.Under the Poisons Act 1971 It is also an offence to possess any utensil, or other implement that‚Äôs designed to be used for the preparation, smoking, inhalation, or administration of cannabis, including anything constructed or modified for those purposes. The maximum fine for possession of such an implement is 50 penalty units. The maximum penalty for possession is $7950 and/or 2 years imprisonment. Trafficking attracts a maximum term of imprisonment of 21 years. Trafficking of smaller quantities has a maximum term of 4 years imprisonment.An owner or occupier of a premises who knowingly causes, permits, or suffers those premises to be used for or in connection with certain cannabis related offences can also be found guilty of an offence in which case they are liable of a fine of upto 50 penalty units or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years, or both. In Victoria possession and use of cannabis is a criminal offence and a diversion program in the state aims to divert offenders into education, assessment and treatment programs. In Victoria, up to 50 g of cannabis can attract a caution and the opportunity to attend an education program (Victoria Cannabis Cautioning Program); only two cautions can be issued. Adults in the Northern Territory under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1990 persons found in possession of up to 50 g of cannabis, one gram of hash oil, 10 g of hash or cannabis seed/s, or two non-hydroponic plants can be fined A$200 with 28 days to expiate at an officers discretion or face a penalty of a fine of upto 50 penalty units in court, in the NT, one penalty unit equates to A155.00. Possession in a public place faces a penalty of upto two years imprisonment. Cultivation infront of a child can face a penalty of life in prison. The maximum penalty for trafficking of a commercial quantity is upto 25 years imprisonment, for less than a commercial quantity is upto 2 years imprisonment. Medicinal use= Legislation & policy = On 17 October 2015, the Federal Government announced that it would legalise the growing of cannabis for medicinal and scientific purposes. On 24 February 2016, the Australian parliament made amendments to the Narcotic Drugs Act that legalised the growing of cannabis for medicinal and scientific purposes. Subsequently, the usage of medicinal cannabis was legalised at the federal level on 1 November 2016.On 17 February 2017, The Office of Drug Control in the Federal Department of Health issued the first Cannabis Research licence under the medicinal cannabis provisions of the Narcotic Drugs Act 1967. Cannabis medicines must be registered with the Therapeutic Goods Administration , unless they are exempt from being entered into the ARTG, savitex is the only cannabis medicine currently registered on the ARTG. Therapeutic goods not approved may be accessed via the TGA via a special access scheme, such as the SAS, some jurisdictions also require relevant state or territory approvals, although doctors do not have to obtain approval to prescribe schedule four Cannabidiol(CBD) medicines. Doctors may also have to source a pharmacy to supply cannabis medicines to patients in Australia. Patients must also waive their right to drive or operate heavy machinery if the medicinal cannabis contains tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Regulation differs further from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in Australia, In some jurisdictions patients may have to be referred to a specialist with the possibility of the specialist being located in a separate jurisdiction and some require patients to exhaust other treatment options before applying for medicinal cannabis products. In 2021, according to an interim decision some low dose CBD medications will be rescheduled to Schedule 3 drugs. This will allow these medications to be sold over-the-counter in pharmacies. To be eligible, medications must be sold in packets with less than 1,800mg of CBD and must contain less than 2% of other cannabinoids in oral, oral mucosal and sublingual formulation, Vaping, smoking and topical low-dose CBD medications will remain Schedule 4 drugs, a final decision will be made in November of 2020. = Usage = According to the national drug strategy household survey 2019, of people who used cannabis in the previous 12 months, 6.8% said they used it only for medical purposes and 16.3% said they sometimes used it for medical purposes and sometimes for other reasons.NDSHS 2019 This equates to 2.7% in the total Australian population (or about 600,000 people) using cannabis for medical purposes, either always or sometimes. * Older people, particularly those aged 60 and over, were most likely to use cannabis only for medicinal purposes, while people in their 20s were least likely to use it for medicinal purposes. Of people who used cannabis medically only, 43% were aged 50 and over. By comparison, among those who did not use cannabis for medical purposes (non-medically or illicitly), only 16% were aged 50 and over and 49% were aged 14‚Äì29. = Supply Trends = According to the NDSHS 2019 When asked if their medical cannabis was prescribed by a doctor, only 3.9% of those who said they used cannabis for medical purposes obtained it by prescription‚Äî1.8% always had it prescribed and 2.1% had it sometimes prescribed. * People who used cannabis for medical purposes (either always or sometimes), usually obtained it from a friend (51%), but 22% purchased it from a dealer; 7.3% grew it themselves and 2.2% had a prescription for a medicalal condition. Supply Medicinal cannabis products and their supply in Australia are regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia. = Prevalence and price =2010 ‚Äì 2020 According to the Australian Institute of Health & Welfare cannabis is relatively easy to obtain in Australia. Regular injecting drug users and users of ecstasy or other stimulants report that cannabis is \\"easy\\" or \\"very easy\\" to obtain. This has remained stable over time, as has purity and pricing. Perceived availability was the highest for hydroponic cannabis (88% of IDRS users and 90% of EDRS users rated it 'easy'or very easy' to obtain). Bush cannabis (78% of IDRS users and 78% of EDRS users rated it 'easy or very easy' to obtain). The primary source of cannabis reported by recent users aged 14 years or older was friends (66%), followed by dealers (19.9%) in 2016 (AIHW 2017) (Table S2.5). 50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Attribution 3.0 Australia (CC BY 3.0 AU) license. According to the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission illicit drug data report 2017-2018 *Nationally, the price for 1 gram of hydroponic cannabis head remained relatively stable thisis reporting period, ranging between $20 and $50 in 2017‚Äì18, compared with a price range of $10 to $50 in 2016‚Äì17. *Nationally, the price of 1 ounce of hydroponic cannabis head remained unchanged this reporting period, ranging between $200 and $450. *Similar to 2016‚Äì17, the price for a single mature hydroponic cannabis plant in 2017‚Äì18 ranged between $2,000 and $5,000, *The price of one gram of cannabis resin (reported in Queensland and Northern Territory) also remaining stable this reporting period, ranging between $25 and $50. 2000 ‚Äì 2010 The prevalence of cannabis in Australia indicates that the plant is widely available. The University of New South Wales' National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre's Drug Trends Bulletin for October 2009 shows that 58% of cannabis users in NSW believe hydroponically-grown cannabis to be \\"very easily\\" available; 43% believe bush-grown cannabis is \\"very easy\\" to find. 0% considered hydro cannabis \\"very difficult\\" to find and 5% considered bush- grown cannabis to be \\"very difficult\\" to find. The results show that figures for the ACT are lower (42% believe hydroponically-grown cannabis is \\"very easy\\" to find, as do 29% for bush-grown cannabis. 3% and 7%, respectively, believe that cannabis is \\"very difficult\\" to find). Victoria shows similar figures to NSW; 66% and 32%, respectively, believe cannabis is \\"very easy\\" to find and 0% and 3%, respectively, believe it is \\"very difficult\\" to find. Tasmania shows similar statistics. In South Australia fewer people consider cannabis (either hydroponically- or bush-grown) \\"very easy\\" to find (32% and 37% respectively), with the majority considering it \\"easy\\" to find (46% and 21%). Western Australia reports similar statistics as South Australia, as does the Northern Territory. Queensland reports statistics similar to NSW with 64% and 56% of respondents reporting hydroponically grown cannabis and bush cannabis, respectively, \\"very easy\\" to find and 3% and 6%, respectively, considering it \\"very difficult\\" to find. The majority of cannabis is domestically produced, with outdoor and hydroponic cultivation common in all states and territories. Single and others note that Australia‚Äôs climate and the amount of space available is conducive to outdoor cultivation. According to the Australian Crime Commission (ACC) the average price for one gram of cannabis ranged from A$20‚ÄìA$35, although prices in remote areas can be significantly higher. In remote regions of the Northern Territories, for example, the price can reach $50‚Äì$100 for a gram. According to Stafford and Burns, an ounce of hydroponically grown cannabis has risen from A$300‚Äì$320 between 2008 and 2009; an ounce of bush weed has increased from A$200‚Äì$229. NDSHS notes that one in six Australians reported that they were offered or had the opportunity to use cannabis. The ACC reports that hydroponically-grown cannabis is described by 75% of the 2007 NDSHS respondents as being \\"easy\\" or \\"very easy\\" to obtain; \\"bush cannabis\\" (outdoor-grown cannabis), by contrast, is not as readily available and was reported by over half of the respondents as being \\"easy\\" to obtain. Respondents in the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre (NDARC) October 2009 Drug Trends Bulletin were asked to rate the purity and potency of cannabis. Statistics show that, in general, hydroponically-grown cannabis is considered to have high purity and potency (NSW 61%; ACT 54%; Victoria 58%; Tasmania 66%; South Australia 65%; Western Australia 69%; Northern Territory 38% [14% low; 31% medium; 17% fluctuates]; Queensland 58%). Bush-grown cannabis is considered to have medium purity and potency (explained by the greater variables in production), with a number of respondents categorising bush grown cannabis as poor-quality. Respondents reported daily or near-daily use of cannabis. According to the 2007 NDSHS, 68.5% of cannabis users obtained cannabis from a friend or acquaintance. 4.8% acquired it from a relative, and 19.5% obtained it from a dealer. 7.2% claimed to have acquired the drug in another way, including \\"grew/made/picked it myself\\". =Seizures and arrests= 2010 ‚Äì 2020  In Australia in 2017-2018 according to the Australian Institute of Health & Welfare the majority of the number of national illicit drug seizures (52.4%) and arrests (48.8%) were for cannabis. However cannabis only accounted for 28.3% of the weight of illicit drugs seized. There were 72,381 cannabis arrests in 2017‚Äì18, with the number of national cannabis arrests increasing 30% over the last decade. The number and weight of national cannabis seizures has also increased over the decade‚Äîthe number of seizures increased from 46,875 in 2008‚Äì09 to 59,139 in 2017‚Äì18 and the weight of seizures increased from 5,573 kilograms in 2008‚Äì09 to 8,655 kilograms in 2017‚Äì18. Of the 72,381 cannabis related arrests in Australia 92% were consumer arrests and 8% were provider arrests.  2000 ‚Äì 2010  According to the Australian Crime Commission (ACC),Illicit Drug Data Report 2007-08 Australian Crime Commission, Canberra. ISSN 1327-9068 cannabis accounted for the greatest proportion of national illicit drug arrests and seizures in 2007/2008 ‚Äì 5409 kg (5,409,000 grams) were seized nationally over 12 months, accounting for 64% of illicit drugs seized in Australia. This equates to 41,660 cannabis seizures, or 68% of all seizures. 2007/2008 saw 52,465 cannabis arrests, a 7% decrease from figures for 2006/2007. The majority of arrests continue to occur in Queensland. Despite a slight decrease from 2006, cannabis continues to be the most commonly detected drug amongst police detainees. Self-reporting within this group identifies hydroponically-grown heads as both the preferred and actual form of cannabis used by the majority of detainees. Furthermore, even though the total amount of cannabis arrests has declined since the mid 1990s, suppliers of cannabis are still arrested more often than suppliers of any other drug. For example, in 2005‚Äì06 over half of all the people arrested for supplying drugs were supplying cannabis. Advocacy A number of Australian and international groups have promoted reform in regard to 21st-century Australian drug policy. Organisations such as Australian Parliamentary Group on Drug Law Reform, Responsible Choice, the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation, Norml Australia, Law Enforcement Against Prohibition (LEAP) Australia and Drug Law Reform Australia advocate for drug law reform without the benefit of government funding. The membership of some of these organisations is diverse and consists of the general public, social workers, lawyers and doctors, and the Global Commission on Drug Policy has been a formative influence on a number of these organisations. = Single issue cannabis parties in Australia = The HEMP(Help End Marijuana Prohibition) Party The group was founded in 1993 by Nigel Quinlan, who ran as a candidate under the name Nigel Freemarijuana. In 2001, Freemarijuana's name was assessed by the Australian Electoral Commission as to whether it was suitable to be added to the electoral roll ‚Äì the Commission found that it was, meaning Freemarijuana could run as an electoral candidate under the name. They have a number of objectives including to legalise Cannabis in all states and territories in Australia for personal, medical, therapeutic and industrial purposes. The Australian Help End Marijuana Prohibition (HEMP) political party has a number of other cannabis focused objectives, including: * endorsing candidates in federal elections * legalising cannabis in all states and territories in Australia for ** personal use ** medical and therapeutic use ** industrial purposes * collecting and disseminating knowledge relating to any or all of the Party's aims * campaigning (and lobbying) in all sectors of the community * organising fundraising for the Party * conducting and facilitating research relating to any or all of the Party's aims * applying for public funding for electoral purposes, in accordance with the provisions of the Australian Electoral Act (1918) as amended * do all which may be necessary, expedient or desirable to carry out the aims of the Party In 2001 and 2004 the National President of the HEMP party and HEMP Embassy, Michael Balderstone, ran as a Senate candidate. The party did not contest the 2007 Federal elections because it had been de- registered and could not re-register in time. It is campaigning to enroll more members, to be eligible to register again. After being notified by the Australian Electoral Commission in April 2010 that they failed to meet the registration due to having less than 500 members, they successfully appealed the decision when they submitted a list of additional members on the 17th May 2010, however the issue of writs on the 19th July 2010 for the federal election put their registration on hold and they were unable to field any candidates. In September 2010 they were finally granted registration. They have since streamlined the membership application process for registered political parties to allow internet registration which has seen their membership grow further. The HEMP party fieled senate candidates in all states in the 2013 federal election. In the 2016 election the party entered a joint ticket with the Sex Party in several states and received 106,000 votes, they also fielded a candidate for the Division of Solomon in the House of Representatives in 2016. In the 2019 election they chose not to enter to a joint ticket and received 260,000 votes and 1.8% of the national senate vote beating out many other bigger parties. Michael Balderstone ran for HEMP in the 2020 Eden-Monaro by-election receiving 2.27% of the vote, more than almost any other minor party. (LCQ) Legalise Cannabis Queensland Party The Legalise Cannabis Queensland Party was born when a group of like minded people containing members from the H.E.M.P. Party and Medical Cannabis Users Association of Australia (MCUA) and their associated networks formed a Facebook group with the intention of standing as Independents in the October 2020 state election with the view of working loosely together to push for cannabis law reform in Queensland and share resources. They met in person on several occasions to discuss issues and policy. Then one person suggested maybe a Political Party would be a better way. With the blessing of the well established federal HEMP Party whose president Michael Balderstone welcomed the news. On the 1st of July 2020 they submitted registration paperwork to the Australian Electoral Commission to run candidates at the October Queensland state election. On the 1st of September 2020 the ECQ verified the parties membership list and sent it to the commissioner for the final approval, the party was officially approved on the 9th of September 2020. LCQ Party believes that cannabis law reform does not have to be complicated and the ‚ÄúGrape Theory‚Äù forms the basis of how they will go about making the necessary reforms at a State level. The Grape Theory Treat Cannabis like grapes, You can grow as many grapes as you want, no license. You can make as many of those grapes as you want into wine, no license. You can share that wine with your friends and family, no license. However the moment you want to sell some of that wine you require a license and to show quality control and safety for human consumption and you pay the appropriate fees. = Public support = Support for the legalisation of illicit drugs declined slightly between 2004 and 2007 and support for the legalisation for personal use of cannabis fell between 2004 and 2007, from 27.0% to 21.2%. Males were more likely than females to support legalisation (in 2007, 23.8% versus 18.5%). Support has grown in recent years with more Australians now supporting legalisation of cannabis than those who remain opposed, according to the 2019 National Drug Strategy Household Survey 41% of Australians now support the legalisation of cannabis 37% remain opposed and 22% remain undecided. There have also been some associated changes in public perceptions about other cannabis-related policies. For example, the majority of Australians aged 14 years and over do not support the possession of cannabis being a criminal offence (74% in 2016 compared with 66% in 2010). =Who Are We Really Hurting Stunts= * On the 1st of April 2020 (April fool's day) activists delivered Prime Minister Scott Morrison a pound of artificial cannabis and the following letter; Dear Scotty, We know you‚Äôve been working bloody hard at the moment, so we wanted to give you something to help relax a little. Please fix the cannabis crisis and replace organised crime with legitimate employment. We are calling for a federal amnesty on cannabis, following suit with Australia‚Äôs Capital Territory and other western countries like Canada. In this time of crisis, vulnerable people are being forced to travel unnecessarily in order to purchase medications from the black market as medical cannabis is unaffordable to most, especially during the current employment climate and the quarantine of millions of Australians due to COVID-19. We hope and pray this care package finds you well. With love from The Who Are We Hurting Team. * On 20 April 2019 activists moved in a 9 metre tall cannabis sculpture at Sydney's iconic Martin Place to ignite discussion around the legality of cannabis. The sculpture was titled Who are we really hurting and was removed by police later that day. * On 20 April 2018 activists teamed up with the hemp health and innovation expo and placed cannabis plants over Sydney CBD, the stunt made national headlines with the organizers being interviewed on network tens breakfast tv show Studio 10. * On 20 April 2017 activists set up a Hydroponic grow room in a store window in the heart of Sydney police attended the premises to investigate and found that the plants were artificial and the instillation was allowed to stay. * Cannabis culture=Nimbin Hemp Embassy, Mardi Grass & The HEMP Party= Nimbin is a small town within the Northern Rivers Region of NSW, arguably the cannabis counter-culture capital of Australia. In 1973, tribes of hippies attended the Aquarius Festival in the Northern NSW town of Nimbin. The prevalence of a drug culture in Nimbin since 1973 has been accompanied by a prevalence of collective and public creativity: colourful and spiritually motivated art (including large paintings above shop awnings), music, poetry, craft, and fashion can all be seen on the main street. The town is known as a hotspot for alternative social activities, grassroots political discourse, and the espousal of naturalist, humanist, anarchist, feminist, permissive, new- age, mystical, and radical social philosophies (which can all be seen as collective creative endeavours). The Nimbin Hemp Embassy is a non-profit association that was established in 1992. The embassy's objectives are cannabis law reform via an education program for the community about hemp products and cannabis and \\"promoting a more tolerant and compassionate attitude to people in general\\".[84] According to the HEMP Embassy website, \\"the Nearly NORML Nimbin group formed in 1988 as the district's first enduring drug law reform outfit and later became Nimbin HEMP ‚Äì Help End Marijuana Prohibition ‚Äì then later in 1992 the name changed to the Nimbin HEMP Embassy. Generally the group discussed the cannabis laws of NSW and how they might be changed\\". In March 1993, after a decade of raids and arrests, and a particularly intensive recent period of random (and illegal) street searches, arrests, rough treatment, pre-dawn raids, regular intimidation and that crushing sense of a province facing conquest, undercover police officers had been discovered buying cannabis in the area. This enraged a small portion of the townsfolk from Nimbin to such an extent that they chased the police officers back to the police station and tossed eggs and toilet paper. Concerned about bad publicity members from the Nimbin HEMP Embassy decided to come up with a more peaceful form of protest that ordinary people could comfortably join. Thats when Bob Hopkins (a.k.a. The Plantem) came up with the idea of MardiGrass. Saturday May 1st 1993 was designated and so the Mardi Grass was born. Despite a lack of police participation and the stern opposition of the local council who refused the marchers the right to march and use of the local park, over 1,000 people, mainly locals, came out in defiance and took part in a powerful ritual of personal and community empowerment. They paraded from the local Bush Theatre uptown to the village centre, then on to the Police Station where they danced and wished the police well. To a tumultuous percussion beat they returned to the Hall for their rally. The contact high was tangible for days afterwards and they vowed to hold Mardi Grass every year until prohibition‚Äôs end and is still held to this day. The next year, 1994, the May Day ‚ÄúLet It Grow!‚Äù Mardi Grass and Drug Law Reform Rally was held on Sunday May 1st accompanied on the Saturday by a National Conference called ‚ÄúBeyond Prohibition‚Äù. This boasted an impressive array of politicians, academics and sundry experts in their chosen fields. The Parade/Rally, along with the annual Harvest Festival Ball and Pot Art Exhibition, became a two day Fiesta. Following in the footsteps of the Cannabis Cup in the Netherlands, the Cannabis Cup in Australia is a competition run by MardiGrass to judge strains of cannabis. Growers submit samples of their crop for judging and the Hemp Olympics, held at MardiGrass, includes events such as bong throwing, joint rolling and \\"a growers' Ironperson competition, which requires participants to crawl through lantana tunnels dragging large bags of fertilizer\\". Nimbin and the Nimbin HEMP Embassy are also home to the HEMP(Help End Marijuana Prohibition) Party, The group was founded in 1993 by Nigel Quinlan, who ran as a candidate under the name Nigel Freemarijuana. In 2001, Freemarijuana's name was assessed by the Australian Electoral Commission as to whether it was suitable to be added to the electoral roll ‚Äì the Commission found that it was, meaning Freemarijuana could run as an electoral candidate under the name. They have a number of objectives including to legalise Cannabis in all states and territories in Australia for personal use, medical and therapeutic and industrial purposes. =Slang= Some of the street names of Cannabis in Australia are Mary Jane, bud, dope, smoko, green, sesh, chop, spliff, honk, ganja, yarndi, mull, hydro, green action, heads, hooch, weed, joints, cones, laughing lucerne, chronic and 420.Siedler, R. (2014). Street drugs: cannabis. Australian Doctor, p. 45. Other commonly used terms in Australian cannabis culture are: * Bewg/Beug Term to describe a bong/water pipe used to smoke cannabis. * Cone/cones Term used to describe standardised single dose's of cannabis from a bong. Also used to describe Cone Piece (see below) * Cone piece/CP Small brass attachment commonly used to dose Cannabis to be smoked in a bong. *Gator/Gatorbewg Common homemade bong, usually fashioned from a used Gatorade bottle. A stem is made with a small length of garden hose and a small hole (carb/shotty) is added to the back to help control airflow. * Sesh/Esh Short for ‚Äúsession‚Äù. Generally used in the context of sharing in a cannabis smoking experience with friends or acquaintances. * Mission / Misho / Mish A term describing the process and/or journey required to follow in order to obtain Cannabis. * Chop Term for chopped or grinded cannabis * PGR (aka reds, hairy, dirt, bikie buds, brisbane red & canberra gold) PGR stands for Plant Growth Regulator. Plant growth regulators are often used outlaw motorcycle gangs and other organised crime syndicates. Cannabis is grown with Plant growth regulators to increase harvestable weight,at the expense of quality. Cannabis grown with PGR's lack the terpene, flavonoid and cannabinoid profiles usually found in Cannabis. Plants grown with PGRs can lead to adverse health effects. The most commonly used PGR in Australia is thought to be Paclobutrazol,though others are used too. *Tick Term used to describe an arrangement where the customer will purchase cannabis on credit, usually to be repaid on one's lay day, or when cannabis is sold for commercial applications. =Online Trends= Australians have transitioned into utilizing the online space when it comes to accessing and purchasing their favorite cannabis accessories. Online trends differ from city to city, and per capita, in 2016 Brisbane, Adelaide and Launceston were searching online the most; followed by Toowoomba, Melbourne, Sydney and Gold Coast. As far as the cannabis accessories searched for the most online, in 2016 Australians were particularly keen on shopping for bongs as they made up 72% of searches, while vaporizers made up 15%. These higher quality methods of ingesting marijuana smoke or vapors were followed by pipes at 10% and rolling papers at just 3%. Interest has grown in the last decade for cannabis related news, data sourced using AHREF in 2020 showed that cannabis related news and articles per year grew 18,850% since 2010. In 2020 the Therapeutic Goods Administration approved Australia‚Äôs first medical-cannabis app. Patients will be able to use the app to order and pay for pre-approved prescriptions. Patients requesting medical cannabis prescriptions will not be eligible for the platform before being granted access to the Special Access Scheme by the TGA. The app will also allow approved providers to prescribe medical cannabis products to regular patients ‚Äì without the need for multiple in-person visits. =Cannabis Expos= There is a number of cannabis related expos and expos showcasing cannabis related products in Australia, they mainly hope to give their guests information and greater awareness around the crucial benefits the hemp and cannabis plant has already unlocked, and its sustainable solutions for the future. They have a number of experiential and educational interactive activities for all ages alongside local and international exhibitors. Through workshops, displays, speakers and exhibitors showcasing everything from hemp fibres, foods, beverages, clothing and textiles, medicinal products, extraction equipment, building materials, beauty products, gardening, hydroponic equipment and much more. =Annual 420 Rallies= April 20 has become an international counterculture holiday, where people gather to celebrate and consume cannabis. Many such events have a political nature to them, advocating the liberalisation / legalisation of cannabis. Vivian McPeak, a founder of Seattle's Hempfest states that 4/20 is \\"half celebration and half call to action\\". Paul Birch calls it a global movement and suggests that one cannot stop events like these. In Australia the annual 420 in the park rallies held in major cities across the country aim to be a celebration of culture, creativity, compassion and the wonderful diversity of good-people who for various reasons, choose to consume cannabis. The rallies give the cannabis community an opportunity to demonstrate very clearly to the general public and to Australia at large, that there is nothing to be afraid of, and to stand united in calling on the Government to legalise adult cannabis use, and ensure that dismantling cannabis prohibition is on the agenda.

The chief source for his life is his will and testament, which survives in the archives of the Cathedral of San Salvador in Oviedo. His episcopate began after the death of his predecessor, Oveco, sometime between 957 and 962. Diego was a native of the village of Hev√≠a, a third part of which he was lord by inheritance. He consecrated the church of San F√©lix there, which, with another church on his property, was later given to the church of Oviedo, along with all his familial possessions in and around Hev√≠a (30 March 967). The early years of Diego's episcopate are made murky by the presence of bishops named Diego in Ourense and Valpuesta at the same time. The identification of a given \\"Bishop Diego\\" in the contemporary documentation is therefore difficult and often uncertain. This is only compounded by the numerous errors of dating and outright falsifications (especially by Bishop Pelagius in the twelfth century) of charters. Several document from between 948 and 954 are signed by a bishop named Diego without reference to his diocese. None of these, probably, belong to Diego of Oviedo. The earliest sure reference to Diego of Oviedo is from an eighteenth-century copy of a document dated, incorrectly, to 934. That Diego's episcopate began in 958 receives some support from the fact that four charters of that year bear the confirmation of a Diego and one‚Äîa donation of Ordo√±o IV to the monastery of Sobrado on 13 November‚Äîspecifies him as ouetense sedis (\\"of the see of Oviedo\\"). There is no reference to Diego between 958 and his donation of his patrimony in 967 save for a single charter confirmation from February 961. After 967 there is one confirmation from 968, one from 969, three from 971, all royal charters of Ramiro III and Elvira Ram√≠rez of Le√≥n. After that there is no record of Diego and in March 975 his see was occupied by his successor, Bermudo. No bishop of Oviedo attended the council which suppressed the Diocese of Simancas in 974, or if one did he did not sign the acts. This possibly indicates a vacancy in the see of Oviedo at that time.

Since this all-German national assembly had not been initiated by the German Confederation, it was lacking not only major constitutional bodies, such as a head of state and a government, but also legal legitimation. A modification of the Bundesakte, the constitution of the German Confederation, could have brought about such legitimation, but as it would have required the unanimous support of all 38 signatory states this was practically impossible. Partially for this reason, influential European powers such as France and Russia declined to recognize the Parliament. The delegates on the left wanted to solve this situation by creating a revolutionary parliamentary government, but, on 24 June 1848, the majority (450 ‚Äì 100) voted for a compromise, the so-called Provisional Central Power. Archduke Johann of Austria (1848) Formation of the Central Power On 24 June 1848, President of the National Assembly Heinrich von Gagern argued for a regency and provisional central government to carry out parliamentary decisions. On 28 June 1848, the Paulskirche parliament voted, with 450 votes against 100, for the so-called Provisional Central Power (Provisorische Zentralgewalt). The next day, 29 June, the Parliament cast votes for candidates to be the Reichsverweser or Regent of the Empire, a temporary head of state.Karl Marx & Frederick Engels, Collected Works: Vol 8 (International Publishers: New York, 1977) Note 23, page 538 In the final tally, Archduke John of Austria gained 436 votes, Heinrich von Gagern received 52 votes, John Adam von Itzstein got 32 votes, and Archduke Stephen the Viceroy of Hungary only 1 vote. The office of Regent was declared \\"irresponsible\\", meaning the Regent could not govern except through his ministers, who were responsible to the Parliament. The Parliament then dispatched a deputation to the Archduke to present the honor bestowed upon him. However, the Confederate Diet (Bundesversammlung) sent their own letter, which the Archduke received prior to the parliamentary deputation, informing him that the princes of the Confederation had nominated him Regent before the Parliament had done so.Heinrich v. Sybel, \\"The Founding of the German Empire by William I.\\", volume 1, p. 210. The implication was that the Regent should receive his power from the princes rather than the revolutionaries, but the practical effect of this power was yet to seen. The Archduke received the delegation on 5 July 1848 and accepted the position, stating, however, that he could not undertake full responsibility in Frankfurt until he had finished his current work of opening the Austrian Parliament in Vienna. Therefore, Archduke John drove to Frankfurt where he was sworn in as Regent on the morning of 12 July 1848 in the Paulskirche, and then crossed over to the Thurn and Taxis Palace to deliver a speech to the Confederate Diet, which then declared the end of its work and delegated its responsibilities to the Regent. On 15 July 1848, the Regent appointed his first government under prime minister Prince Karl zu Leiningen, the maternal half-brother of Queen Victoria of Great Britain. Ministers of the Interior, Justice, War, and Foreign Affairs were appointed on the same day, while Ministers for Finance and Trade were appointed on 5 August. The Thurn und Taxis Palace, which had been and would again be the home of the Confederate Diet, was given over to the Regent and his ministers. Archduke John returned to Vienna on 17 July to finish his tasks there. At the end of August 1848, there were a total of 26 persons employed in the administration of the provisional government. By 15 February 1849, the number had increased to 105. Some 35 of them worked in the War Department and had been employed by the Confederate Diet in the same capacity. The Ministry of Commerce employed 25 staff, including the section in charge of the German Fleet, which was only separated as an independent Naval ministry in May 1849. The diplomatic section employed mostly freelance personnel who held portfolios for state governments.  Practical tasks of the Provisional Central Power  Frankfurt was the seat of the Provisorische Zentralgewalt of the Frankfurt Parliament and of the Federal Assembly of the German Confederation The practical tasks of the Provisional Central Power were performed by a cabinet, consisting of a college of ministers under the leadership of a prime minister (Ministerpr√§sident). At the same time, the Provisional Central Power undertook to create a government apparatus, made up of specialized ministries and special envoys, employing, for financial reasons, mainly deputies of the assembly. The goal was to have a functional administration in place at the time of the Constitution's passage. Whatever form the final government of united Germany was to take would be defined by the Constitution, and necessary changes to the Provisional Central Power would be made accordingly. Significantly, the terms of the Regent's service explicitly forbade him or his ministers from interfering in the formulation of the Constitution. = The German Army and Navy = On 12 July 1848, the Confederate Diet transferred responsibility for the German Confederate Army and the Federal Fortresses to the Provisional Central Power. The Regent appointed General Eduard von Peucker, Prussia's representative to the Federal Military Commission, as Minister of War. On 16 July, the Minister of War sent a circular to the state Governments with a proclamation to the German troops, in which he decreed the Regent as the highest military authority in Germany. The governments were to call out the troops of every garrison for a parade on 6 August, the 42nd anniversary of the end of the Holy Roman Empire. Their commanding officers were to read Peucker's proclamation before them, after which the troops were shout \\"Hurrah!\\" for the Regent three times. However, King Frederick William forbade parading anywhere in Prussia on that date. Austria's Minister of War Theodore von Latour similarly refused to obey the order. The creation of the German Navy was a consequence of Denmark's blockade of the North German coast in the war in Schleswig-Holstein. The vote passed overwhelmingly on 14 June 1848, and this date is still celebrated as the foundation of the modern German Navy. The Regent then appointed the Bremen senator Arnold Duckwitz as Minister of the Marine (Minister f√ºr Marineangelegenheiten) to develop a war fleet with Prince Adalbert of Prussia as Commander in Chief and Karl Brommy as Chief of Operations. Difficulties arose in the procurement and equipment of suitable warships, as the British and Dutch were wary of a new naval power arising in the North Sea, and Denmark pressed its blockade harder. Furthermore, most German states forbade their trained personnel from serving in another navy, even though it was to be for their own common defense. Nevertheless, by 15 October 1848, three steam corvettes and one sailing frigate were placed into service. By that time, the Armistice of Malm√∂ signed on 26 August had taken the pressure off German commerce. In total, two sailing frigates, two steam regattas, six steam corvettes, 26 rowing gunboats, and one hawk ship were procured from diverse places.

However, there we no funds to disburse for the project. Patriotic enthusiasm led to numerous penny-collections across Germany to help raise funds. Actual monies for the Navy did not become available until the Confederate Diet dissolved itself on 12 July 1848 and the Federal Fortress budget (Bundesmatrikularkasse) came into possession of the Provisional Central Power. By 15 October 1848, three steam corvettes and one sailing frigate were placed into service. In consequence, however, the entire budget inherited from the Confederate Diet was spent. Discussions in the National Assembly for raising funds through taxes were tied into the Constitutional debates, and the Provisional Central Power could not convince the state governments to make any more contributions than what they had agreed upon in the Confederate Diet. Chaotic finances of such states as Austria, struggling with external war and revolutionary outbreaks, meant little or no payment was to be expected in the near future. Effectively, the National Assembly and the Provisional Central Power were bankrupt and unable to undertake such rudimentary projects as paying salaries, purchasing buildings, or even publishing notices. The revolution functioned on the financial charity of individual Germans and the good will of the states, which grew thinner as the months passed. Nevertheless, as late as 18 May 1849, President of the Assembly Theodore Reh reported the following private contributions to the fleet: 50 Florins collected from donors in the Traunkreis, forwarded by Mr. Kamillo Wagner of Steyr; 42 Pounds 17 Shillings 6 Pence forwarded by Mr. Peters, the Hamburg Consul in Manila, Philippines; and 4 Thalers from a student in Leipzig.Franz Wigard, \\"Stenographischer Bericht √ºber die Verhandlungen der Deutschen Constituirenden Nationalversammlung zu Stuttgart\\", Sunday, 19 May 1849, p. 6635.  Relations with the National Assembly  Prince Carl zu Leiningen, first Prime Minister As the National Assembly had initiated the creation of the Provisional Central Power, the Regent and his government were expected to be subservient to their whims. Theoretically, the transfer of the Confederate Diet's authority to the Regent on 12 July gave him legitimate, binding power independent of the National Assembly. The Diet's rules regarding unanimous decision-making and a liberum veto had been a source of weakness when divided among 39 members. But, when concentrated in the hands of one man, it could make him supreme if he chose to be so.Heinrich v. Sybel, \\"The Founding of the German Empire by William I.\\", volume 1, p. 215-216. However, the Regent was a man of advanced age who was convinced, like most of his contemporaries, that his office would be of short duration and his role should be strictly an honor. Therefore, the personalities of the Prime Ministers during the life of the Provisional Central Power clearly defined the government during their tenures. Leiningen was staunchly anti-Prussian and essentially anti-prince. His family had been mediatized along with hundreds of other nobles in the Napoleonic period, and he expected the remaining princes of Germany to set aside their crowns as well.Heinrich v. Sybel, \\"The Founding of the German Empire by William I.\\", volume 1, p. 232. His successor, Anton Schmerling, held contempt for many of the institutions he had dutifully served, such as the Confederate Diet, and considered the National Assembly and his administration to be the future of Germany. Yet, as the National Assembly dragged out its work on the Constitution, the role of the Provisional Central Power changed. Soon, its purpose was to shore up the diminishing legitimacy of the whole project in eyes of the people and the princes. Heinrich Gagern's appointment as Prime Minister in December was to serve that purpose, even though relations between the Regent and the former President of the National Assembly were poor.  Passage of the Constitution  Heinrich von Gagern, third Prime Minister As the near-inevitable result of having chosen the Smaller German Solution and the constitutional monarchy as form of government, the National Assembly elected the Prussian king Frederick William as hereditary head of state on 28 March 1849. Shortly after the vote, Archduke John offered his resignation as Regent, explaining that the vote ended all reason for his office. President of the Assembly Eduard von Simson was surprised by the act, and hastened to the Thurn and Taxis Palace where he requested him to remain as Regent until the coronation should occur. However, the Regent had already dispatched notice to King Frederick William, offering the Provisional Central Power to him ahead of his coronation. This act created something of a crisis, as possession of the office would be an important increase in Prussia's influence over the German Confederation, whether the King accepted the crown of Germany or not. Austria's Prime Minister Prince Schwarzenberg swiftly intervened, and convinced Archduke John to remain in office as Regent. This ensured Austria's role in German affairs did not diminish. As it was, King Frederick William formally rejected the Imperial Constitution and the crown that was to go with it on 21 April 1849. Following Prussia's lead, the Constitution was rejected by the larger states and Gagern demanded that the Regent personally intervene to convince the Princes to yield. Reminding Gagern of his own terms forbidding the Regency from interfering in the work of the Constitution, he refused, and Gagern resigned in consequence on 10 May 1849.Helmut Jacobi, Die letzten Monate der provisorischen Zentralgewalt f√ºr Deutschland (M√§rz-Dezember 1849), 1956, p. 50.  Break with the National Assembly  The Regent appointed the conservative Greater German advocate and National Assembly deputy Dr. Maximilian Gr√§vell as his new Prime Minister on 16 May 1849. This so incensed the National Assembly that they held a vote of no confidence in the government on 17 May, resulting in a vote of 191 against 12 with 44 abstentions. Receiving moral support from Austria, the Regent stood defiant and retained his Prime Minister. Calls for the resignation of the Regent immediately followed.Franz Wigard, \\"Stenographischer Bericht √ºber die Verhandlungen der Deutschen Constituirenden Nationalversammlung zu Stuttgart\\", Friday, 18 May 1849, p. 6629. Dr. Maximilian Gr√§vell, fourth Prime Minister The next day, 18 May, Prime Minister Gr√§vell ascended the speaker's podium in the Paulskirche and explained the Regent's motives for appointing him as Prime Minister, and the Regent's refusal to obey the National Assembly's decisions. Gr√§vell defiantly stated that \\"The Regent can and will only return his office to the National Assembly from which it originated. But he will do so and cannot do otherwise, except as a staunch steward of the power entrusted to him by the [state] governments, and only to return this power back into the hands of the governments.\\" Great unrest answered Gr√§vell's words, as the National Assembly was directly confronted with the statement that the Regent's power originated from the states, not the revolution. With insults and jeers raining down from the gallery, the Prime Minister concluded, \\"These, gentlemen, are the motives for why we came here, and why we cannot resign, in spite of your open distrust.\\" The Prime Minister then departed. Deputy William Zimmermann of Stuttgart shouted from the gallery, \\"This is unheard of in the history of the world!\\"Franz Wigard, \\"Stenographischer Bericht √ºber die Verhandlungen der Deutschen Constituirenden Nationalversammlung zu Stuttgart\\", Sunday, 19 May 1849, p. 6637-6638. After reading the rules of the Provisional Central Power, adopted 28 June and 4 September 1848, especially those articles that address the removal of ministers and the Regent, President Theodore Reh of the National Assembly read the report from the Committee of Thirty that drafted a provisional government (Reichsregentschaft) to replace the Regency. The vote passed with a majority (126 to 116 votes) for the plan with a provisional governor (Reichstatthalter) to replace the Regent. However, spreading rebellion in the Palatinate caused the Regent to call out Confederate troops to occupy Frankfurt. Threatened by the show of force, the National Assembly voted to close and remove to Stuttgart before a governor could be appointed. (See Provisional Rump Parliament and Dissolution.)  In opposition to the Reichsregentschaft  With the closing of the National Assembly in Frankfurt, the Provisional Central Power was henceforth in opposition to the revolution that had created it. With the appointment of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg as Prime Minister, the Regent placed a staunchly conservative pro-Austrian candidate to steer the Provisional Central Power back toward the Confederate Diet. Because the Regent and Provisional Central Power did not acknowledge the decisions of the National Assembly, the first business of the parliament when it reconvened in Stuttgart was to declare both dismissed and proclaim a new provisional regency (Reichsregentschaft) led by five deputies Franz Raveaux, Carl Vogt, Heinrich Simon, Friedrich Sch√ºler and August Becher, and fashioned after the Directory of the French First Republic. However, the Provisional Central Power maintained control over the bureaucracy and, more importantly, the armed forces. On 16 June 1849, the National Assembly declared the formation of a People's Army (Volkswehr) consisting of four classes from age 18 to 60. The Provisional Regency then called all Germans to arms in order to defend the Constitution of 1849.Franz Wigard, \\"Stenographischer Bericht √ºber die Verhandlungen der Deutschen Constituirenden Nationalversammlung zu Stuttgart\\", Monday, 25 June 1849, page 6849. But the proclamation only hastened the dissolution of the parliament by the troops of W√ºrttemberg.  After the National Assembly  After rejecting the Imperial Constitution on 21 April 1849, Prussia attempted to undermine the Provisional Central Power. King Frederick William intended to assume its functions after the Regent announced his resignation at the end of March. However, Prince Schwarzenberg had foiled Prussia's efforts to do so. Therefore, Prussia chose to support the Union Policy (Unionspolitik) designed by the conservative Paulskirche deputy Joseph von Radowitz for a Smaller German Solution under Prussian leadership. A draft dated 28 May 1849 created a league of the three kingdoms of Prussia, Hannover, and Saxony for one year in which to formulate an acceptable constitution for Germany. With the dissolution of the National Assembly, those politicians who supported Gagern's Erbkaiserlich policy of a hereditary monarchy led by King Frederick William supported Prussia's Unionspolitik in the Gotha Post- Parliament and the Erfurt Union Parliament. This policy was based on Prussia's insistence that both the National Assembly and the German Confederation were defunct. However, Austria's policy was that the German Confederation had never ceased to exist; rather, only the Confederate Diet had dissolved itself on 12 July 1848. Therefore, the Austrian Emperor's position as President of the German Confederation was still in force. Archduke John attempted to resign his office once more in August 1849, stating that the Regency should be jointly held by Prussia and Austria through a committee of four until 1 May 1850, by which time all of the German governments should have decided on a new Constitution. The two governments agreed in principle, and a so-called Compact of Interim was signed on 30 September, transferring all responsibilities of the Provisional Central Power to the two states, though not relieving the Regent of his office as yet. By signing this compact, Prussia tacitly accepted Austria's policy that the German Confederation still existed.Heinrich von Sybel,The Founding of the German Empire by William I (1890). Vol. 1, page 397. One week later, disagreements between the three kingdoms saw Prussia's project for a new federal German government fall apart. On 5 October 1849, Hannover argued for an understanding with Austria before a new Parliament could be elected and a new Constitution drawn up, and Saxony seconded the motion. On 20 October, both kingdoms ended active participation in the league's deliberations, isolating Prussia entirely. With Austria's position in Germany more and more secure, Archduke John was finally permitted to resign his office of Regent on 20 December 1849.Wilhelm Mueller, \\"Political History of Recent Times, 1816-1875: With Special Reference to Germany\\" (1882), page 248 See also Frankfurt Assembly Bundestag (Deutscher Bund) Provisorische Zentralgewalt  External links  *Informationen zur Deutschen Konstituierenden Nationalversammlung und die provisorische Zentralgewalt beim Bundesarchiv *Gesetz √ºber die Einf√ºhrung einer provisorischen Zentralgewalt f√ºr Deutschland vom 28.

He would soon go on to make his league debut on April 21, 2007 against Shenzhen Shangqingyin in a 2-1 defeat. As the season went along the club's manager Pei Encai would be dismissed, this would cause some bad relationships between the local players against most of the Shandong players in the team to be exposed, this saw the Shandong players except Deng Xiaofei to be purged out of the club at the end of the season. Guo would transfer to second-tier club Jiangsu Sainty and be re-united with the manager from Wuhan Pei Encai at the beginning of the 2008 league season while also being awarded the No.6 jersey. He would go on to make his debut on April 20, 2008 against Sichuan FC in a 1-0 defeat. In his first season with Jiangsu Sainty Guo would receive two league appearances, however it was enough for him to aid the club to win the division title at the end of the season. Back within the top tier Guo would be a squad player as Jiangsu Sainty became mid- table regulars, however after being unable gain more playing time he was allowed to transfer to third-tier club Chongqing F.C. on July in the 2011 Chinese league season. At Chongqing, Guo would play in seventeen games as the club reached the division play-off final where he would personally miss a penalty that saw Harbin Songbei Yiteng win the title, however despite this his club would still gain promotion to the second tier. In 2015, Guo signed for Shenzhen Renren. On 19 February 2019, Guo transferred to League Two side Zibo Cuju.ÂÆòÊñπÔºöÈÉ≠ÊòéÊúàÁ≠â4ÂêçÁêÉÂëòÂä†ÁõüÊ∑ÑÂçöËπ¥Èû† at qq.com 2019-02-19 Retrieved 2019-02-20 National team=U-17 National Team= As a youngster Guo Mingyue would be called to the Chinese U-17 National Team and would be included in the squad that competed in 2003 FIFA U-17 World Championship.

Historians and clerics Manuel Risco and Carlos Gonz√°lez de Posada both date his episcopate to 976‚Äì92. Since his predecessor, Diego, is not mentioned in any document after May 971 and no bishop of Oviedo signed the act of the synod that suppressed the Diocese of Simancas in 974, it is presumed that the diocese of Oviedo lay vacant in the early 970s. Bermudo first appears as bishop in a document of 15 March 975 confirming the donation by Cromacio Melliniz and his family of the monastery of San Jorge to the Cathedral of San Salvador and its bishop. Bermudo signs immediately after Ramiro III of Le√≥n and his regent, Elvira Ram√≠rez.The bishops signature reads Uuirmundus, ouetensis episcopus (\\"Bermudo, bishop of Oviedo\\"). On 14 March 976 Bermudo confirmed a donation by the count Froila Velaz. On 23 September 978 he received a gift of the monastery of Cartavio from king Ramiro.His signature reads in both cases Virmundus ouetensis eps. (\\"Bermudo, bis[hop] of Oviedo\\"). A document of 14 January 979 is the last certain confirmation of Bermudo of Oviedo for several years. Bermudo may have confirmed a charter of 14 January 981 (it is signed by bishop named Beremundus, see unstated) and perhaps also a donation of Sevariego, Bishop of Le√≥n, and a certain G√≥mez Didaz in the presence of the royal court on 16 November 985 (again Beremundus without a specified diocese). On 1 July 986 a royal donation was confirmed by a bishop Bermudo and a donation by a certain count Almundo on 29 May 987 by a Ueremundus episcopus (bishop Bermudo). On 24 December 988 Bermudo, identified as of Oviedo, confirmed a royal donation to Celanova. On 2 May 989 the bishop made an exchange of villages with count Gundemaro Pinioliz and his wife. In 990 and 991 a bishop Bermudo is again in the documents without reference to a diocese. From 978 on, a certain Gudesteus periodically signs as bishop of Oviedo.Gudesteus signs first on 10 July 978 and on 24 April 984 he calls himself Ouetensis sedis episcopo (\\"bishop of the see of Oviedo\\"). The likely explanation is that Bermudo, being perhaps old and physically weak, retired formally to a monastery and entrusted daily episcopal duties to an auxiliary bishop, Gudesteus, who would succeed him in full later. This practice was not uncommon at the time and Oviedo had known an auxiliary bishop earlier in the tenth century (Hermenegild II, fl. 899‚Äì921). A document of 29 July 991, signed only by Gudesteus, may indicate that by then Bermudo had retired completely, only coming out of retirement for a special purpose. On 2 September 992 both Bermudo and Gudesteus signed the same document as bishops of Oviedo.Their signatures are: Beremudus Ovetensis sedis episcopus and Gudesteus Ovetense sedis episcopus. This may be related to the enmity which Bishop Pelagius reported over a century later between Gudesteus and King Bermudo II, who was opposed more generally by the Asturians and Leonese and was consequently forced to seek his coronation in Galicia. This last act recorded of Bermudo (2 September 992) was the witnessing of the royal will and testament in Le√≥n. In it Bermudo II confirmed all Oviedo's possessions and privileges and all the gifts and concessions which he had made to it. Specific mention is made of property formerly possessed by the bishop Bermudo but which had been despoiled by the petty nobleman Ecta Sarraciniz, who fought against Bermudo II while he was still reigning only in Galicia.

Some trails lead south across the Glastonbury border to a larger area of land owned by the Town of Manchester to maintain the Buckingham Reservoir and provide drinking water to Manchester. The land around the reservoir is open to recreation. While there is a hill named Case Mountain in this area, locals refer to this entire trail system and forest in Manchester and Glastonbury simply as ‚ÄúCase Mountain.‚Äù Case Pond in the Case Mountain Recreational Area in the Town of Manchester, Connecticut. History The Case family were prominent industrialists in Manchester where they operated a paper mill and water bottling facility. In 1861 Alfred Wells Case and his twin brother Albert Willard Case opened the Case Brothers Inc. paper mill in Highland Park where they produced washed cotton supplied to the Union Army during the Civil War.http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company- histories/FiberMark-Inc-Company-History.html At the end of the war, the Case brothers began a specialized papermaking operation and soon became a leader in the manufacturing of pressboard, a strong paper product used as album board, shoe board, and binder board.https://www.google.com/patents?id=o7lHAAAAEBAJ&printsec;=abstract&zoom;=4&source;=gbs_overview_r&cad;=0#v=onepage&q;&f;=false They were true Connecticut Yankees that ran an efficient, innovative, highly skilled operation, and the company continued to flourish as the New England paper industry reached its peak. In 1878 the company won first prize for its pressed paper at the International Paris Exposition, competing with many European paper manufacturers, and achieved further success at the Melbourne Exhibition of 1880. Case Brothers Inc. remained a family business and continued success into the 1960s when it was acquired by Boise Cascade Corporation. The Case family owned a large amount of land in the southeastern section Manchester that is now the Case Mountain Recreational Area.http://www.ctmuseumquest.com/?page_id=1348 CT MuseumQuest They built a stone bridge across the west end of Case Pond, many stone walls, a chestnut log cabin, and a carriage path that loops from Spring Street to the top of Lookout Mountain and down to Case Pond. Trails Case Mountain has a vast trail network for hiking and mountain biking, maintained by Manchester Conservation Commission and the Connecticut Forest and Park Association. The terrain is very rocky and hilly, making for somewhat difficult hiking and challenging mountain biking. Bring a trail map and good footwear. The carriage path, a wide smooth gravel trail with white markings, leads visitors from the Spring Street parking area to the summit of Lookout Mountain (elev. 744 ft) and loops around to Case Pond. Visitors often mistake Lookout Mountain for Case Mountain (elev. 735). The summit of Lookout Mountain has benches and a kiosk and gives visitors a great view of Downtown Manchester, Downtown Hartford, and the hills off to the west. The Shenipsit Trail is a blue-blazed trail running north‚Äìsouth through the area. Starting in East Hampton and going north to Somers, the Shenipsit trail covers over , about 5 of those miles are within the Case Mountain area. In the Glastonbury section of the Shenipsit Trail is a stretch of the trail known by local mountain bikers as ‚ÄúSlick Rock‚Äù. There are two vistas on this section of trail providing views of Hartford, but not nearly as panoramic as the views from the top of Lookout Mountain. =Mountain biking= Mountain biking is a very popular activity at Case Mountain. Case Mountain was voted the Best Ride in Connecticut in Mountain Bike Magazine by readers.http://www.bicycling.com/tourdefrance/article/0,6802,ss1-2-13-12959-1,00.html Bikers tend to stick to single-track trails, such as the locally famous \\"Metavomit\\" trail. The terrain on these trails is rocky with many steep climbs and descents. Rocks, logs, boulders, and man-made ladder-bridges (to make the trails \\"bikeable\\") are often intentionally incorporated into these mountain biking trails. Trail-braiding, when short trails are created that go around an obstacle or technical section or short-cut a sharp corner, the result of beginners riding on advanced trails, is not a large problem on mountain-bike trails at Case Mountain, because the \\"beginner\\" trails are unblazed and offer trial use for riders of varying skill levels. Geology and ecology The forest in which the Case Mountain trail system is located is mostly second- growth deciduous forest. The forest floor is littered with boulders and rock gardens deposited from glaciers during the last ice age. Along the Shenipsit Trail one can find clusters of chestnut oak, a very distinguishable tree that grows in rocky mountainous terrain in the Eastern US, and is prominent on ridgetops. In Glastonbury land owned by the Town of Manchester around the Buckingham Reservoir are large white pine trees. The Roaring Brook flows through the area creating marshy habitat just upstream of the reservoir and is a wide, fast moving stream further upstream and downstream. There are several vernal pools around Lookout and Case Mountains. These pools like small ponds in the winter and spring when they fill up with snowmelt. When wet, they teem with life, with frogs, toads, salamanders, fairy shrimp, and fingernail clams inhabiting them. By the summer they have usually dried up and appear to simply be small clearings in the woods. There have been black bear sightings at Case Mountain along with other wildlife typical of southern New England.

As chief USAF pilot of the Lifting Body Research Program, he helped validate the concept of flying a wingless vehicle back to Earth from space and landing it like an aircraft‚Äîan approach used by the Space Shuttle and to a greater degree by vehicles such as the Lockheed Martin X-33 and NASA X-38. Gentry completed thirty lifting body flights including the first flight of the Martin-Marietta X-24A and the second flight of the Northrop HL-10. Biography=Early years= Gentry was born in Enid, Oklahoma to Louise (n√©e Hoyt) Gentry and Richard \\"Dick\\" Gentry. He attended Kemper Military School in Boonville, Missouri. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland in 1957 and accepted his commission with the U.S. Air Force. =Military career= Gentry received pilot training in 1958 and flew the F-100 Super Sabre. He attended the Aerospace Research Pilot School (now the USAF Test Pilot School) at Edwards Air Force Base in California and graduated with class 63A.(1994) USAF Test Pilot School 50 Years and Beyond, p. 84 He spent the next seven years at the Air Force Flight Test Center flying tests on the F-104 Starfighter, Northrop F-5, General Dynamics F-111, and the F-4 Phantom II. Gentry was the project pilot on a series of F-4E spin susceptibility and prevention tests with Burt Rutan as project engineer. The spin test program culminated in a training film, Unload for Control, that was presented to F-4 aircrews. Lifting body test pilot Capt Gentry by M2-F2 in 1966 Gentry's most notable contributions to flight test occurred when he was assigned to the lifting body research program in 1965. The lifting body program, operated jointly by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Air Force, performed the initial manned tests to evaluate the feasibility of landing a wingless spacecraft on a pre-determined runway. Gentry was the eighth pilot assigned to the lifting body program and made his first air-towed flight in the NASA M2-F1 on July 16, 1965. He transitioned to the heavyweight Northrop M2-F2 lifting body which he first flew on October 12, 1966 in an unpowered mission air-dropped from a B-52 Stratofortress. By May 1967, he had made five unpowered flights in the M2-F2 to define the vehicle's aerodynamic characteristics in preparation for upcoming rocket-powered supersonic flights. M2-F2 testing ended prematurely when the vehicle crashed on May 10, 1967 severely injuring fellow lifting body test pilot, Bruce Peterson. Major Gentry by HL-10 in 1968 Gentry transitioned to another heavyweight lifting body, the Northrop HL-10, and made the second flight of this vehicle on March 15, 1968. The HL-10 had just returned to flying status after nearly sixteen months of modifications to correct handling deficiencies. Gentry confirmed that the modifications were successful and reestablished confidence in the HL-10. On October 23, 1968, Gentry attempted the first powered flight in the HL-10. However, the rocket engine failed shortly after launch resulting in an emergency landing on Rosamond Dry Lake. On April 17, 1969, Gentry flew the first, unpowered, glide-flight of the Martin-Marietta X-24A‚Äîa short teardrop shaped lifting body. After several additional unpowered flights, preparations began for powered flight using an LR-11 rocket engine. Gentry flew the first powered flight of the X-24A on March 19, 1970 reaching a speed of Mach 0.87. In June 1970, the Northrop M2-F3 became available for testing. The M2-F3, the last of the heavyweight lifting bodies used in the program, was built from the wreckage of the M2-F2 and modified with an additional third vertical fin to improve handling characteristics. Gentry made his 30th and final lifting body flight in the M2-F3 on February 9, 1971. He was the only lifting body pilot to fly five different vehicles in the program. While working on the lifting body program, Gentry earned a master's degree in aerospace systems management from the University of Southern California. Vietnam and Cold War Colonel Gentry, commander 388th Tactical Fighter Wing (far right) In January 1971, Gentry was assigned to the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing stationed at Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base in Thailand where he flew more than 200 combat missions in the F-4 Phantom during the Vietnam war. As a Fast Forward Air Controller (FAC), Gentry earned the Silver Star‚Äîthe United States' third highest military decoration for valor. After returning to the United States, Gentry held a leadership role in the Air Force's Lightweight Fighter program that produced the F-16 Fighting Falcon. He also served as an aerial combat commander at the Red Flag tactical training exercises at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. On August 11, 1980, Gentry was named commander of the 388th Tactical Fighter Wing (TFW) at Hill Air Force Base in Utah. Under his command the 388th TFW was the first to transition into the F-16. In 1983, Gentry was assigned to the office of research, development and acquisitions at the headquarters for the United States Air Force. He retired from active duty in 1985. =Later years= After retiring from the Air Force, Gentry founded the aerospace consulting firm of Gentry & Associates located in Alexandria, Virginia. He was a member of many organizations related to aviation including the Air Force Association, the Red River Valley Fighter Pilots Association, the Order of Daedalians, the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, and the International Order of Characters. Gentry died on March 3, 2003 in Alexandria, Virginia after several months of illness. A funeral was held on April 9, 2003 at the Old Post Chapel at Fort Myer followed by a graveside service at Arlington National Cemetery. He is survived by his wife, Anne, two sons, and several grandchildren. Honors Monument to Jerry Gentry Gentry was awarded the following decorations for his military service: Silver Star, Legion of Merit, Distinguished Flying Cross with one oak leaf cluster, Meritorious Service Medal with two oak leaf clusters, Air Medal with two silver and three bronze oak leaf clusters, Vietnam Service Medal with four bronze service stars, Air Force Longevity Service Ribbon with one silver and one bronze oak leaf cluster, and the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal. For his work on the HL-10, Gentry was awarded the 1968 Harmon Aviator's Trophy for outstanding contribution to the science of flying. In 1969, the Society of Experimental Test Pilots presented Gentry with the Iven C. Kincheloe Award for his work on the NASA/Flight Research Center (FRC) Lifting Body Program. In 1970, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics presented Gentry with the Octave Chanute Award presented for an outstanding contribution made by a pilot or test personnel to the advancement of the art, science, and technology of aeronautics. In 1987, Science Museum Oklahoma honored Gentry with membership in the Oklahoma Air and Space Hall of Fame. In 1993, he was inducted into the Aerospace Walk of Honor in Lancaster, California that honors test pilots who have contributed to aviation and space research and development.

Based on a previous teleplay by Matthew Chernov and David Rosiak, it was written by David Abramowitz and Dennis A. Pratt and revolves around a weather creation system developed by the Atmospheric Research Institute that threatens life on Earth when deployed by the military. However, while scientist Dr. Jonathan Kirk (James Van Der Beek), Danni Wilson (Teri Polo), and detectives Devon Williams (Marisol Nichols) and Stilman (Luke Perry) attempt to save the world, the former is hunted by hitmen. The first part of the film was broadcast on the NBC network July 26, 2009. The second part was broadcast on August 2, 2009. Plot Through his Atmospheric Research Institute, Robert Terrell (Treat Williams) has finally fulfilled his lifelong dream of completing \\"weather creation\\" technology, which has been a landmark event. However, during a test run, a team composed of Dr. Jonathan Kirk, Carly Meyers and Dr. Jack Hoffman send a blast of energy into the ionosphere, driving the planet into unexpected natural disasters. The experiment also causes a damage of the weather control laboratory which causes the police led by the detective Devon Williams to begin the investigation. Dr. Jonathan Kirk (James Van Der Beek) is the only one to intervene and demand that the system be destroyed, but Terrell denies his requests, pushing his team forward. As a result, Dr. Kirk contacts news reporter Danni Wilson (Teri Polo) to help him expose the secrecy and lies ‚Äî which turns out to be Terrell working with Army General Braxton (David James Elliott) to use the technology as a key military weapon instead of for philanthropic reasons, as initially claimed ‚Äî of Terrell and the events that are unfolding. General Braxton, however, has ordered hit men to murder Dr. Kirk as he works his way to shut down the technology and save humanity. The hit men murder Danni first and make it look like she was killed by Dr. Kirk so he is immediately considered a prime suspect and arrested. However, Det. Williams begins to doubt that he is the murderer. To show the importance of the discovery to General Braxton, Terrell orders the team to create a huge storm in Afghanistan which disables the Afghan rebels. But another blast of energy to the ionosphere only makes the situation worse and a strong hurricane appears over the Pacific, heading to Peru. The team then manages to redirect the hurricane away from the coast but then several hurricanes start to endanger the U.S. mainland, the largest being headed to Los Angeles. After escaping the hit men again Dr. Kirk is captured by Stillman from the military intelligence who knows many things about the weather experiment. He shows Dr. Kirk the hole in the ionosphere which is the cause of the extreme weather around the world and offers him a help to develop a method to reverse the damage of the ionosphere. After Dr. Kirk succeeds Stillman admits he was a bait set by Terrell to get Dr. Kirk back and tries to shoot him but he defeats Stillman and calls Det. Williams to join him during the visit of the lab. The hit men appear again and begin shooting at them but are killed by Det. Williams in the shootout. As the Pentagon cancels the funding of the research for causing uncontrollable weather changes General Braxton pushes Terrell to stop the violent weather by all means necessary but the research team has no idea how to settle the things without making it worse. Facing the imminent catastrophe, Terrell stops pushing the team, allowing them to do whatever they want. Dr. Kirk arrives in time to apply his method to fix the hole in the ionosphere. The action is successful but Terrell who sees the solution for the problem changes his mind and aims a gun at the team. He is then shot by Det. Williams and General Braxton is arrested for causing a global danger but commits a suicide.

The sting resulted from a complaint from a conservationist. Two managers of the store were charged with felonies in 2012, later reduced to misdemeanors. Great Wall lawyers argued that the wildlife charges did not apply because all of the creatures on sale were commercially farmed: turtles from Oklahoma, eels from Pennsylvania, bullfrogs from the Dominican Republic, and so forth. The defense claimed that \\"law governing sales of live fish and other animals has not been updated to reflect advances in aquaculture, and that it is tilted against immigrants with unfamiliar cuisines and customs.\\" Starting in 2012, residents behind the Rockville store began submitting noise complaints to the Montgomery County Department of Environmental Protection.

The company was headed by Hu Haifeng, son of former General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Hu Jintao, until 2008. Subsequent chairmen include Rong Yonglin and Zhou Liye; the current chairman is Chen Zhiqiang. Nuctech Company's parent company, Tsinghua Tongfang, is controlled by the China National Nuclear Corporation, a state-owned company that manages China's civilian and military nuclear fuel development program. The company's state ownership, military links, and ties to the Chinese Communist Party have raised concerns from other countries about granting it control over strategic security infrastructure. History Nuctech Company was founded in 1997 in Beijing as Nuclear Technology Company Ltd. It subsequently changed its name to Nuctech Company in March 2002. In 2014, the Transportation Security Administration banned Nuctech equipment from U.S. airports due to security concerns. Products and services Nuctech X-Ray scanner truck Nuctech Company manufactures security inspection products. It provides advanced technologies in the security inspection industry to its customers from 160 countries and regions in the world, including Iran, Syria, and Venezuela. The services are provided for civil aviation, customs, railway, highway among others.Company Overview of Nuctech Company Limited Retrieved on 2018-11-02. Products offered are for cargo and vehicle inspection, baggage and parcel inspection, and personnel screening.  Controversies  Nuctech Company has been mentioned in a number of media reports concerning controversies. =Procurement investigation in the Philippines = In 2006, the Philippine government bought 30 units of mobile X-ray equipment through a loan agreement with the Chinese government for a total value of P7.953 billion. In 2016, it was reported that the Commission on Audit of the Philippines (COA) found that the contract had been \\"exorbitantly overpriced\\". A quotation from another supplier showed that an X-ray machine with superior performance only cost P124.6 million each, for a total of P3.738 billion for thirty units, P4.215 billion less than Nuctech's alleged inferior product. COA auditors clarified that the price inquiry was made despite the difficulty in providing an accurate unit price and full specifications of Nuctech's machines. The COA also found that the maintenance cost of the X-ray machines from Nuctech was also more expensive by P3.264 million compared to other suppliers. The COA asked the Bureau of Customs to review the original contract and evaluate the deal. =Anti-dumping dispute= In July 2009, it was reported that Nuctech was accused of \\"illegal dumping\\" by Smiths Group and that an anti-dumping investigation by the European Union (EU) was ongoing. In June 2010, the EU imposed a five-year tariff on Nuctech products for alleged dumping on the European market. The anti-dumping measures expired in the absence of an extension request. =Bribery scandal in Namibia= On July 21, 2009, Nuctech representative Yang Fan (Êù®Â∏Ü) and two Namibians, Teckla Lameck and Jerobeam Mokaxwa, were arrested after the Anti-Corruption Commission of Namibia (ACC) discovered that a US$12.8 million down payment on 13 scanners had been diverted to a firm called Teko Trading owned by the two Namibians. Namibia prosecutors accuse them of joining in a bribery scheme that secured a $55.3 million contract in May 2008 to install Nuctech scanners at customs inspection points across Namibia. Other sources report the contract to be worth $69 million. Netizens in China were blocked from accessing stories about the son of Hu Jintao in the wake of the scandal. Chinese web portals, Sina and NetEase, could not be opened for several hours after they posted reports about the company linked to Hu Haifeng. The report related to Hu Haifeng had been deleted from both web sites when their technology sections came back online. An industry insider who declined to give his name said that both Sina and NetEase were likely to face official sanctions. Neither company confirmed that the sites had been blocked by the authorities or that their blockage was linked to any content. A customer service executive at Sina said the site had experienced technical problems. General Martin Shalli, a veteran fighter for Namibian independence trained in the former Soviet Union, was subsequently suspended by Namibian president Hifikepunye Pohamba for allegedly having received millions of Namibian dollars from Nuctech. = Bribery scandal in Taiwan = In March 2020, the Taipei Times reported Taiwan's former head of the Aviation Police Bureau's aviation security section was found guilty on corruption charges in relation to a procurement project involving Nuctech. = Contracts under review in Canada = In July 2020, Canada's foreign affairs minister stated that he would review contracts awarded by the Canada Border Services Agency in light of Nuctech's connections to the Chinese Communist Party. = Quality and procurement concerns in Malaysia = According to a July 2020 report by Malaysiakini, the National Audit Department and the Royal Malaysian Customs Department have both cited quality and procurement concerns with Nuctech products.

One of the region's major rivers, it flows south from the slopes of Mount Taraponui in the Maungaharuru Range before turning east to reach Hawke Bay north of Napier. State Highway 5 follows the lower course of the river for several kilometres close to the settlement of Eskdale. The river is probably named after the Esk River in southern Scotland and north-west England. The lower of the Esk can be suitable for whitewater canoeing, but the flow needs to be above normal. Brown and rainbow trout are available in the river, but fishing is restricted. The southern stretch of the river forms the northern boundary for urban development in Napier. Hukarere Girls' College is located near the Esk River. Chardonnay and red wine grapes are grown in the Esk River valley.

It is usually sold in a small canister and burned directly within that canister, with or without a wick. The fuel often contains methanol, ethanol, or diethylene glycol, as these may be burned safely indoors, and produce minimal soot or odour. These fuels are also used for emergency heating, outdoor cooking, and fondue. Types of fuel rightThe first two fuels are similar with regards to consistency, both having a gel form (viscosities can vary with brand), operating procedures, and product design. The common gel methanol or ethanol chafing fuel is contained in a steel can with a resealable plug lid in sizes based on burn times. Two-, four-, and six-hour burn times are the most common sizes of methanol and ethanol chafing fuels available. The colour of the fuel being used can also vary among manufacturers. leftBoth ethanol and methanol have low flash points, 11‚Äì17 ¬∞C, making them highly flammable; diethylene glycol, with a flash point of 154 ¬∞C, is considered safer because spilled DEG fuel will not combust; it needs a wick to burn. The fuel is in a liquid form and thus the canister in which it is contained usually differs by having a more leak resistant screw cap rather than a plug. Comparison of energy yield Ethanol has a heat of combustion of 22.28 kJ/mL, similar to the 22.7 kJ/mL energy yield of diethylene glycol. Methanol is slightly less energetic, yielding 17.94 kJ/mL.

California, 372 U.S. 353 (1963), was a case before the United States Supreme Court. Background Two defendants were tried and convicted in a California state court on felony charges including robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, and assault with intent to commit murder. A single public defender had been appointed to represent them on these three charges. The attorney's motion for continuance at the beginning of trial was denied, although he stated that he was not as prepared as he should have been. Thereafter the defendants dismissed the defender and renewed motions for separate counsel and for a continuance. These motions were also denied. The defendants were convicted and subsequently filed appeals. Exercising their only right to appeal as of right, they appealed to an intermediate Court of Appeals (District court of appeal of California, second appellate district), and, being indigent, applied to it for appointment of counsel to assist them on appeal. In accordance with a state rule of criminal procedure, that Court made an ex parte examination of the record, determined that appointment of counsel for petitioners would not be \\"of advantage to the defendant or helpful to the appellate court\\" and denied appointment of counsel. Their appeal was heard without assistance of counsel and their convictions were affirmed. The District Court of Appeal affirmed their convictions after denying their request for appointment of counsel under a California rule of criminal procedure authorizing such denial where after an independent investigation of the record the appellate court determines that appointment of counsel would be helpful to neither the defendant nor the court. (187 Cal App 2d 802, 10 Cal Rptr 188.) The California Supreme Court denied their petitions for a discretionary review/hearing. (187 Cal App 2d 813, 10 Cal Rptr 214.) Opinion of the court The Supreme Court of the United States vacated the judgment of the California District Court of Appeal. In an opinion by Justice Douglas, expressing the view of six members of the Court, it was held that the denial of counsel under the California rule of procedure stated above violated the Fourteenth Amendment. Held: Where the merits of the one and only appeal an indigent has as of right are decided without benefit of counsel, an unconstitutional line is drawn between rich and poor. pp. 353‚Äì358 The Court held that a procedure like the one used by the state appellate court in which an indigent defendant was denied counsel on appeal unless he first made a preliminary showing of merit did not comport with fair procedure. In vacating, the judgment of the state appellate court, the Court stated that where the merits of the one and only appeal an indigent had as of right were decided without benefit of counsel, an unconstitutional line had been drawn between rich and poor. The Court vacated the judgment of the state appellate court and remanded for further proceedings consistent with the Court's opinion. Dissent Clark dissented on the ground that neither the equal protection clause nor the due process clause requires more than what is provided in the California rule. Justice Harlan, joined by Justice Stewart, dissented on the grounds that the equal protection clause was not apposite, and that the due process clause was not violated. His dissenting opinion also held that the defendants were not denied effective assistance of counsel in the trial court.

Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371 (1971), was a case before the United States Supreme Court. Background=Complaint= A class action was formed representing female welfare recipients residing in Connecticut and wishing divorces, but prevented from bringing divorce suits by Connecticut statutes requiring payment of court fees and costs for service of process as a condition precedent to access to the courts. There was no dispute as to their inability to pay the court fees or costs. Plaintiffs sought a judgment declaring the statutes (requirements for payment of court fees and costs for service of process that restricted their access to the courts in an effort to bring an action for divorce) invalid as applied to the class, and an injunction requiring defendants to permit members of the class to sue for divorce without payment of any fees and costs. =United States District Court for the District of Connecticut= A three-judge court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim (286 F Supp 968). It held that a State could limit access to its divorce courts by the requirement of a filing fee or other fees, even when they effectively barred appellants from commencing actions therein. Opinion of the court On appeal, the Supreme Court of the United States reversed. The opinion by Justice Harlan expressed the views of six members of the court. The Supreme Court concluded that, given the basic position of the marriage relationship in this society's hierarchy of values and the concomitant state monopolization of the means for legally dissolving this relationship, due process did prohibit a state from denying, solely because of inability to pay, access to its courts to individuals who sought judicial dissolution of their marriages. Thus, the Court held that a state could not, consistent with the obligations imposed on it by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, pre-empt the right to dissolve this legal relationship without affording all citizens access to the means it had prescribed for doing so. =Concurrences= Justice Douglas concurred in the result on the ground that the equal protection clause rather than the due process clause was the proper basis of decision. Justice Brennan concurred on the ground that while denying indigents access to the courts for nonpayment of a fee is a denial of due process, it is also a denial of equal protection of the laws, and no distinction can be drawn between divorce suits and other actions. =Dissent= Justice Black dissented on the ground that charging practically nominal initial court costs in civil actions does not violate either the due process or equal protection clause. He asserted that nowhere in the Constitution was marriage mentioned, thus (as per the Tenth Amendment) reserving dissolution procedures as the state's prerogative.

It was signed by Robert Horne, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leonid Krasin, Commissar of Foreign Trade.Misha V. Glenny,\\"The Anglo- Soviet Trade Agreement, March 1921.\\" Journal of Contemporary History 5.2 (1970): 63-82. Abstract Lenin's New Economic Policy downplayed socialism and emphasized business dealings with capitalist countries in an effort to restart the sluggish Russian economy. Britain was the first country to accept Lenin's offer of a trade agreement. It ended the British blockade, and Russian ports now were open to British ships. Both sides agreed to refrain from hostile propaganda. It amounted to de facto diplomatic recognition and opened a period of extensive trade.Christine A. White, British and American Commercial Relations with Soviet Russia, 1918-1924 (1992). Background Lloyd George first raised the proposal to drop the blockade on Russia, following the October Revolution at a meeting of the Allied Supreme Council, held on 14 January 1920, four days after the Treaty of Versailles had been ratified. Originally trade was to be restricted to being with the \\"Russian people\\", through Centrosoyuz, the All-Russian Union of Consumer Co-operative Societies. However, by the end of May 1920, Leonid Krasin had arrived in London and the terms of the agreement had shifted. Also, although originally an allied proposal, the French declined Lord Curzon's invitation to participate, and the Italians sent a charg√© d'affaires who only participated in one session. Meanwhile, the Bolsheviks, upon hearing of the Supreme Council's intention of lifting of the blockade and developing trade with the Co-operatives, responded by taking Centrosoyuz over. Lenin wrote the executive decree promulgated by the Council of People's Commissars on 27 January which put this into effect. Krasin and his fellow delegates were nominally co-opted on to the board of Centrosoyuz, maintaining the fiction that negotiations were being carried out with the Co-operatives Union.Glenny, (1970), pp. 63-82. First phase of negotiations: from 31 May to 7 July 1920 Krasin was accompanied by Viktor Nogin to London to engage in the negotiations. The British Cabinet discussed the proposed agreement at 10 Downing Street on 28 May 1920. Lord Curzon had previously briefed the meeting: :'We know from a great variety of sources that the Russian Government is threatened with complete economic disaster, and that it is ready to pay almost any price for the assistance which we - more than anyone else - are in a position to give. We can hardly contemplate coming to its rescue without exacting our price for it, and it seems to me that price can far better be paid in a cessation of Bolshevik hostility in parts of the world important to us, than the ostensible exchange of commodities, the existence of which on any considerable scale in Russia there is grave reason to doubt.'Cabinet Paper: 'Negotiations with M. Krassin - Note by Lord Curzon'. C.P. 1350, 27 May 1920. CAB. 241106. as quoted ibid There were four meetings held on 31 May, 7 June, 16 June, and 29 June. The first two were more formal, but the third meeting consisted only of Lloyd George, Krasin, Sir Robert Horne, Philip Kerr, 11th Marquess of Lothian and Fridtjof Nansen. However, the last meeting was to prove crucial. Both Krasin and Lloyd George agreed that there were two principal issues: * Hostile propaganda and subversion * pre-1917 debts to British creditors Faced with an impending meeting with Britain's allies, Lloyd George drew up a four-point plan: * An armistice and end to hostile propaganda * The exchange of prisoners * Mutual recognition of outstanding debts for goods and services * Exchange of trade missions Krasin was given 7 days in which to reply and provided passage on board HMS Vimiera to Reval. Georgy Chicherin responded on 7 July agreeing to these terms in principle. Second phase of negotiations: from 8 July to 11 September 1920 Lev Kamenev was appointed the head of the new negotiating team at Chicherin's insistence over Lenin's objections. Third phase of negotiations: from 12 September 1920 to 16 March 1921  Negotiations were long and protracted. Lenin remarked at the 8th All Russian Congress of Soviets on 21 December 1920: :The treaty, the trade agreement with Britain is not signed yet. At this very moment Krasin is conducting urgent talks on it in London. The British government has handed us its draft, we have given our counterdraft, but it is still obvious that the British government is dragging its feet over the agreement because the reactionary war party is still hard at work there; it has had the upper hand so far and is hindering the conclusion of a trade agreement. It is in our direct interest, and it is our direct duty to give all our support to whatever can help to fortify those parties and groupings who are striving for the signature of this treaty with us.Lenin, Sochinenia, XLII, 97-8 Ivan Maisky was to underline the importance of the agreement thus: :This diplomatic document, though modest in scope, is of truly historic significance. The Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement was not an ordinary trade treaty with the mere object of regulating commercial operations between two countries; it was an agreement of politico-commercial character: it gave the RSFSR de facto recognition by the most powerful capitalist power in Europe, a power which in those days still successfully contended with the USA for the role of the foremost capitalist country in the world.I.

Context of the Consolations Seneca‚Äôs three Consolatory works, De Consolatione ad Marciam, De Consolatione ad Polybium, and De Consolatione ad Helviam Matrem, were all constructed in the Consolatio Literary Tradition, dating back to the fifth century BC. The Consolations are part of Seneca‚Äôs Treatises, commonly called Dialogues, or Dialogi.Costa, C.D.N. Seneca: Four Dialogues. Aris and Phillips Ltd. England 1994 These works clearly contain essential principles of Seneca‚Äôs Stoic teachings. Although they are personal addresses of Seneca, these works are written more like essays than personal letters of consolation. Furthermore, although each essay is particular in its address of consolation, the tone of these works is notably detached. Seneca seems more preoccupied with presenting facts of the universe and the human condition instead of offering solace. This detachment may be a result of Seneca‚Äôs attempt to gain favor and contrive a return from exile through these Consolatio works, instead of merely offering a friendly hand of comfort.Scourfield, J.

American Journal of Philology 130 (2009): 67. July‚ÄìAug. 2009. De Consolatione ad Helviam Matrem In De Consolatione ad Helviam Matrem, Seneca writes his mother to console her on his recent exile to Corsica. In this work, Seneca employs many of the rhetorical devices common to the Consolatio Tradition, while also incorporating his Stoic Philosophy. Seneca is the consoler and the one inflicting suffering in this work, and notes this paradox in the text. Seneca was charged with adultery with Julia Livilla, sister of Emperor Caligula in 41 AD. He was shortly after exiled to Corsica. Scholars have concluded that the De Consolatione ad Helviam is dated roughly 42/43 AD. In the text, Seneca tells his mother he does not feel grief, therefore she should not mourn his absence. He refers to his exile merely as a ‚Äòchange of place‚Äô and reassures her his exile did not bring him feelings of disgrace. Seneca comments on his mother‚Äôs strong character as a virtue that will allow her to bear his absence. Seneca‚Äôs seemingly positive outlook on his own exile follows his Stoic philosophy teachings that one should not be upset by uncontrollable events. This quote from De Consolatione ad Helviam, shows Seneca‚Äôs presentation of his life as tolerable, and even spiritually enjoyable. > I am joyous and cheerful, as if under the best of circumstances. And indeed, > now they are the best, since my spirit, devoid of all other preoccupations, > has room for its own activities, and either delights in easier studies or > rises up eager for the truth, to the consideration of its own nature as well > as that of the universe‚Ä¶Rudich, Vasily. Dissidence and literature under > Nero. Routledge, 1997. pp. 27‚Äì35 De Consolatione ad Polybium Seneca wrote De Consolatione ad Polybium approximately 43/44 AD, during his years in exile. Scholars often refer to this work as the definitive representation of the part of Seneca‚Äôs life he spent in exile. This Consolatio addresses Polybius, Emperor Claudius‚Äô Literary Secretary, to consol him on the death of his brother. The essay contains Seneca‚Äôs Stoic philosophy, with particular attention to the inescapable reality of death. Although the essay is about a very personal matter, the essay itself doesn‚Äôt seem particularly empathetic to Polybius‚Äô unique case, but rather a broader essay on grief and bereavement. In fact, the reader doesn‚Äôt ever find out the name of Polybius‚Äô deceased brother. One scholar claims that the De Consolatione ad Polybium is an attempt by Seneca to contrive his return from exile. (Rudich) This letter to Polybius clearly tries to gain his favor, and as well as flatter the Emperor Claudius, ironically seeking to draw empathy for himself in the process: > As many tears as are left to me by my own fortune I do not refuse to shed > lamenting yours. For I will manage to find in my eyes, exhausted as they are > by my private crying, some that still may pour out, if this will do you any > good. In the text of De Consolatione ad Polybium, Seneca encourages Polybius to distract himself from grief with his busy work schedule. The tonal switch from consoling Polybius to flattery of Emperor Claudius occurs in chapter 12. (Ball) Seneca credits the emperor as the source of his ‚Äòhigh station‚Äô and as the giver of his, ‚Äòpleasure of being able to perform duties.‚Äô (Ball) Seneca then delves into a series of prayers of devotion and flattery, which invoke long life for the emperor. This switch is sudden, abrupt, and incongruent with Seneca‚Äôs Stoic philosophy. (Rudrich) It appears almost desperate in its presentation. In fact, the tone is so recognizably changed, some scholars claim other authorship besides Seneca. (Ball) However, it is most widely accepted that the tonal switch in De Consolatione ad Polybium was nothing more than Seneca‚Äôs desperate attempt to escape exile and return from Corsica. (Rudich) De Consolatione ad Marciam De Consolatione ad Marciam (\\"On Consolation to Marcia\\") is a work by Seneca written around 40 AD. Like Seneca‚Äôs other Consolatory works, this Consolation is constructed in the Consolatio tradition, and takes the form of an essay versus a personal letter. Seneca was most likely motivated to write this letter of consolation to Marcia in order to gain her favor; Marcia was the daughter of a prominent historian, Aulus Cremutius Cordus, and her family‚Äôs enormous wealth and influence most likely inspired Seneca to write this letter of consolation. Through the essay he sticks to philosophical abstractions concerning Stoic precepts of life and death. For a letter offering solace, he notably lacks empathy toward Marcia's individual grief and loss. Marcia actively mourned the death of her son Metilius for over three years. In De Consolatione ad Marciam, Seneca attempts to convince her that the fate of her son, while tragic, should not have been a surprise. She knew many other mothers who had lost their sons; why should she expect her own son to survive her? The acknowledgement, even expectation, of the worst of all possible outcomes is a tenet of Seneca's Stoic philosophy. While Seneca sympathised with Marcia, he reminded her that \\"we are born into a world of things which are all destined to die,\\" and that if she could accept that no one is guaranteed a just life (that is, one in which sons always outlive their mothers), she could finally end her mourning and live the rest of her life in peace. > the inhabited world... in huge conflagration it will burn and scorch and > burn all mortal things... stars will clash with stars and all the fiery > matter of the world... will blaze up in a common conflagration. Then the > souls of the Blessed, who have partaken of immortality, when it will seem > best for god to create the universe anew‚Ä¶ will be changed again into our > former elements. Happy, Marcia, is your son who knows these mysteries! > (Seneca, Ad Marciam de Consolatione) Seneca contrasted two models of maternal grieving: that of Octavia Minor, sister of Augustus, who, on losing her only son Marcellus in his twenties, \\"set no bounds to her tears and moans\\"; with that of Livia, wife of Augustus, who on losing her son Drusus \\"as soon as she had placed him in the tomb, along with her son she laid away her sorrow, and grieved no more than was respectful to Caesar or fair Tiberius, seeing that they were alive.\\"De Consolatione ad Marciam, commentary Consolatory letters Several of Seneca's Moral Epistles are also consolations. Two of the consolations are addressed to Lucilius: Epistle 63Seneca, Epistles, consoles him on the death of his friend Flaccus; Epistle 93Seneca, Epistles, consoles him on the death of the philosopher Metronax. Epistle 99Seneca, Epistles, consists largely of a copy of a letter Seneca wrote to his friend Marullus,Possibly Junius Marullus, consul designatus in 62 AD, cf.

He created unrest among the people of Maharashtrian against British rule through his popular weekly Kaal (meaning \\"Times\\" in Marathi) from 1898 to 1908. Early life Paranjape was born on 27 June 1864 in Mahad in Raigad district to a local practising advocate. After his primary education at Mahad, at 14 he attended secondary school in Raigad. He was highly impressed by his teacher Vishnushastri Krushnashastri Chiplunkar who had also inspired Lokmanya Tilak and Gopal Ganesh Agarkar to start their social and political career. In 1882 Paranjape moved to Pune to join New English School newly founded by Chiplunkar, Tilak and Agarkar. In 1884 he received the prestigious Jagannath Shankarsheth scholarship. In 1885 he spent his first year at Fergusson College moving to Deccan College to finish his B.A.. In 1895 he received his M.A. from Bombay University. Political career After receiving his master's degree Paranjape joined Maharashtra College as Sanskrit professor. Simultaneously, he started giving lectures on the current political and social situation and became instantly popular due to his particular sarcastic style of presentation. As a follower of Tilak he also participated in many socio-political events like 'Shiva Jayanti' and 'Ganesh Utsav' which ultimately compelled him to resign from his college job. In 1898 he founded a weekly called Kaal (‡§ï‡§æ‡§≥), which eventually would have two meanings in Marathi; the first would be 'Times' and the other 'Terminator'. His fiery editorials and humorous and sarcastic style of writing started making the younger generation furious with anger against the British rule. Kaal continued to be a popular weekly even sometimes surpassing Tilak' Weekly Kesari until Paranjape was arrested in 1908. British authorities convicted him of ‚Äúsedition‚Äù and sentenced him to nineteen months of imprisonment with hard labor. In 1910, when he was set free, British authorities banned the publication of Kaal and also confiscated collections of his past essays and editorials in the weekly. Paranjape decided to take a break and turn to literature. Literary work Paranjape wrote over one thousand political and social essays and critiques; short stories; novels; and plays. He was elected president of the Marathi Sahitya Sammelan (All India Marathi Meet) held at Belgaum in 1929. His works include the following : * ‡§ï‡§æ‡§≥‡§æ‡§§‡•Ä‡§≤ ‡§®‡§ø‡§¨‡§Ç‡§ß (Collections of essays - 11 Volumes) * ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§∞‡§æ‡§µ (Play) * ‡§™‡§π‡§ø‡§≤‡§æ ‡§™‡§æ‡§Ç‡§°‡§µ (Play) * ‡§µ‡§ø‡§Ç‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§ö‡§≤ (Novel) * ‡§ó‡•ã‡§µ‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¶‡§æ‡§ö‡•Ä ‡§ó‡•ã‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü (Novel) Some of his quotes *A Paris (Philosopher's stone) must be the reality considering that the land of England in the past was having nothing but a huge stock of iron-ore.

Had I have enough courage to drink liquor every day, I could have claimed myself to be a Sudharak (Reformer). Later life Paranjape again became active in politics during 1920 after the emergence of M.K. Gandhi on the Indian political orbit. In 1922, British authorities imprisoned Paranjape for six months for participation in a satyagraha at Mulshi under the leadership of Gandhi to oppose the proposed Mulshi Dam. In 1927, he became President of the Maharashtra branch of the Indian Independence League formed by Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhashchandra Bose and Shrinivas Ayyangar. He suffered from diabetes for many years and died on 27 September 1929.

He served as Bishop of Fargo, North Dakota, from 1889 until his death in 1909. He built the Cathedral of St. Mary in Fargo. The brick Romanesque Revival building was dedicated in May 1899. Early life John Shanley was born in Albion, New York, the youngest son of John and Nancy (n√©e McClean) Shanley. At age 5 he and his family moved to Faribault, Minnesota, and soon afterward to St. Paul, where he received his early education, much of it from association with frontier priests who visited St. Paul, during his service as an altar boy at St. Paul Cathedral from 1858 to 1867. He was a student of noticeable ability at St. John's College in Collegeville, where was trained in the classics and graduated in 1869. Bishop Thomas Grace, O.P., then sent him to the College of Propaganda in Rome; Shanley made the journey with Rev. John Ireland (the future Archbishop of St. Paul and Minneapolis). While in Rome, Shanley was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Costantino Patrizi Naro on May 30, 1874. At age 22, he was below the age requirement for ordination but was granted a dispensation on account of his frail health. Upon his return to Minnesota in 1882, he became an assistant pastor at St. Paul Cathedral under Rev. Ireland. Ireland took Shanley under his wing and gave him many responsibilities in the church. Shanley succeeded Ireland as pastor of the Cathedral parish in 1884. He also served as secretary of the Archdiocese and editor of the weekly Northwestern Chronicle. Shanley made it a priority to serve minorities and the destitute,Weber, Gerald Michael. 1951. John Shanley: first bishop of Fargo. St. Paul, MN: St. Paul Seminary. p. 17 and conducted services for African- American Catholics in the basement of the cathedral. Bishop On November 15, 1889, Shanley was appointed the first Bishop of the newly erected Diocese of Jamestown, North Dakota, by Pope Leo XIII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following December 27 from Archbishop Ireland, with Bishops Grace and Martin Marty, O.S.B., serving as co-consecrators. He established St. John's Academy at Jamestown, under the charge of the Sisters of St. Joseph, in 1890. Shanley found running the diocese from Jamestown difficult and moved to Fargo in 1891. While Shanley resided in Jamestown, St. James Church was designated the diocesan cathedral, but when he moved the see to Fargo. As the church building in Fargo proved inadequate, Shanley purchased property for a new cathedral and had plans drawn up. The basement was completed when a fire destroyed most of downtown Fargo in 1893. Shanley donated a large portion of the funds that he had personally raised for the new cathedral to reconstruct the city after the fire. Construction on the cathedral was, therefore, delayed. St. Mary's Cathedral was completed and it was dedicated on May 30, 1899. In 1891 Shanley wrote the Fargo Argus defending those on the Turtle Mountain Reservation. He denounced the actions taken by local agents and highlighted positive aspects of Indian culture.Becklund, Scott. \\"The Making of Bishop Shanley\\", Fargo History Project, North Dakota State University He hosted the convention of Catholic Laymen in 1896. On April 6, 1897, the name of the diocese was changed to the Diocese of Fargo. At the beginning of his tenure, there were 60 churches, 33 priests, 14 schools and one hospital in the diocese; by the time of his death, there 106 priests, 225 churches, six academies, 34 schools and four hospitals. Shanley took great interest in the development of the material interests of Fargo and the state, making large subscriptions to whatever contributed to the advancement of the state or of its people. He went to Washington, D.C. in 1906 to protest against divorce and established Total Abstinence Societies in the diocese. The Bishop died in his sleep on July 16, 1909 at Fargo, aged 57.

One of London's older clubs, it was centred on gambling and maintained a somewhat raffish and raucous reputation. It was founded by William Crockford who employed Benjamin Wyatt and Philip Wyatt to construct the city's most opulent palace of gentlemanly pleasure, which opened in November 1827.See \\"Berkshire Chronicle\\", 8 February 1828, p. 4 , \\"Chronology of the Principal Events during the Year 1827\\" entry for 12 November: \\"About this time Crockford's new Hell opens\\", and he employed two of London's finest chefs of the time, Louis Eustache Ude and then Charles Elm√© Francatelli to feed its members, food and drink being supplied free after midnight.\\"The most fashionable club before the establishment of the Coventry [House Club] was Crockford's, and I was elected to it immediately after being returned for Parliament [in 1842]. It was admirably kept. Francatelli, the cook, was unequalled; there was a first-rate supper, gratis, with the best champagne for those who hungered and thirsted after midnight; and in a little room off the supper-room was the gambling table, at which too many an ardent admirer of hazard had lost all his fortune.\\" Sir William Gregory, K.C.M.G, Edited by Lady Gregory, An Autobiography, London: John Murray 1894, pp. 82‚Äì82. From 1823, the club leased 50 St. James's Street, and then nos. 51‚Äì53, which enabled Crockford to pull down all four houses and build his palatial club on the site. After the club's closure, this continued to be used as a clubhouse, at first briefly by the short-lived Military, Naval and County Service Club, and then between 1874 and 1976 it was home to the Devonshire Club. The current Crockfords, though using much of the \\"Crocky\\" imagery and high-end reputation, has no connection with the original club and operates from an entirely different building at nearby 30 Curzon Street. Founder William Crockford was born on 13 January 1776, the son of William and Mary Ann Crockford, and was baptised at St Clement Danes in London on 12 February 1776. He began life working in his father's fish shop adjoining Temple Bar (at the original site of that landmark gate ‚Äì now to be found aside St Paul's Cathedral). His ability at calculation was to stand him in good stead: he quickly took to gambling, and after a number of long sessions amassed a tidy sum ‚Äì enough to launch himself into Regency clubland. He acquired a site in St James's Street and opened a building that was to become the most famous gaming house in Europe: \\"Crockford's\\". He catered to the aristocracy, took a charge on every bet laid, and in the process amassed a fortune estimated at the time of his 'retirement' in 1840 to have been ¬£1,200,000 in the currency of the time,Crockford never disguised the fact: \\"Many a young man, aye, and many a father, had reason to curse that house. The late Mr Crockford lived by it, and died a millionaire. How he made his wealth was pretty well exemplified by his answer to a nobleman, who went to him and complained that his son was ruined in the house, to which Mr Crockford coolly replied, 'I know it; I ruin one a-day. I live by it.'\\" The Evening Chronicle (London), 4 December 1846, p. 4. certainly enough to establish homes at 11 Carlton House Terrace at which he died (later to become Prime Minister William Gladstone's home) and at Panton House, Newmarket. Although he had technically retired in 1840, leaving the running of the Club to a Management Committee, he still owned the lease, which was sold after his death for ¬£2,900, with twenty-two years still to run at a yearly rent of ¬£1,400.\\"Sales by Auction.

Refounding 50 St. James's Street today In 1928, the club was refounded primarily as a bridge club patronised by British players including world champion Terence Reese and Kenneth Konstam.

Fang was born in Japanese-occupied Korea, but attended university in mainland China. After completing his undergraduate degree, Fang worked for Monumenta Serica, a prominent scholarly journal of Chinese topics. He then moved to the United States, where he took up residency in Cambridge, Massachusetts, studying and teaching courses at Harvard University. Fang was widely learned, and specialized in comparative literature, particularly in the studies of Chinese and German literature. His correspondence with Ezra Pound significantly influenced Pound's understanding of Chinese subjects, and his doctoral dissertation on Pound, an attempt to compile all the classical allusions in The Cantos, remains an important source for Pound scholars.  Life and career= Youth = Achilles Fang was born Fang Chih-t'ung (Fang Zhitong ) into a Chinese family living in Japanese- occupied Korea on August 20, 1910. He eventually left, with the help of a missionary, to attend high school at the American Baptist College in Shanghai.Hightower, \\"Achilles Fang: In memoriam.\\" He subsequently majored in philosophy and classical studies at Tsinghua University, where he was one of the few friends of Qian Zhongshu (who would go on to write one of the best- known and most highly regarded works of modern Chinese literature, Fortress Besieged).Kelly and Mao, \\"Afterword\\" to Fortress Besieged. After graduating in 1932, Fang spent two more years at Tsinghua as a graduate student, and then, within a period of four years spent in Nanjing and Beijing, was married, had a child, and suffered the death of his wife. = Monumenta Serica = From 1940 to 1947, Fang worked for the East Asian studies journal Monumenta Serica in Beijing, first as editorial secretary and then as associate editor (the latter position he maintained for two years after leaving Beijing in 1947). The main content of Fang's work was to proofread translations in submissions to the journal, and he corrected errors with a scholar's meticulous zeal. Fang's own contributions included a regular \\"Review of Reviews\\" feature, wherein he summarized important articles in European and Japanese sinological journals, providing Western Sinologists with news of developments in Japanese Sinology that those without a knowledge of Japanese would otherwise not have had. Fang also taught German during this period, both at Fu-Jen University and the Deutschland-Institut. = Harvard = In 1947, Fang moved to Cambridge with his son to work on the Harvard-Yenching Institute Chinese-English dictionary project.Hightower, James Robert (1997). \\"Achilles Fang: In Memoriam\\". Monumenta Serica. 45: 339‚Äì413. He was dismissed for constant use of quotations from Finnegans Wake in his entries,\\"Contributors' notes,\\" The New Directions Anthology of Classical Chinese Poetry. and subsequently enrolled in Harvard's comparative literature PhD program, from which he graduated in 1958 (in Burton Pike's graduating class\\"PhD Dissertations.\\" Harvard Department of Comparative Literature.

That dissertation, the 865-page \\"Materials for the Study of Pound's Cantos,\\"tracked down all the classical allusions in the Cantos, Hightower, James Robert (1997). \\"Achilles Fang: In Memoriam\\". Monumenta Serica. 45: 339‚Äì413. a work admirably suited to his vast reading in many languages and acute detective instincts. One small example: In Canto 11 is the line, ‚Äûder in Baluba das Gewitter gemacht hat,‚Äú obviously a quotation, but from what source? Achilles found it in one of the seven volumes of Frobenius' Erlebte Erdteile, where the author is referring to the activities of an African shaman.Hightower, James Robert (1997). \\"Achilles Fang: In Memoriam\\". Monumenta Serica. 45: 339‚Äì413. This dissertation has long been a major source for Pound scholars, as evidenced by the many names on the check- out cards in the copies in Harvard's Widener Library. Fang became friendly with Pound while writing his dissertation, and decided not to publish it for fear of embarrassing Pound over Pound's many errors in his use of sources.Hightower, James Robert (1997). \\"Achilles Fang: In Memoriam\\". Monumenta Serica. 45: 339‚Äì413. During Pound's years at St. Elizabeths, Fang was Pound's key correspondent on Chinese topics.Hightower, James Robert (1997). \\"Achilles Fang: In Memoriam\\".

He died of cancer in 1995, and was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery. In 1997, through a gift of \\"the students and friends of Achilles Fang,\\" Harvard established a prize in his honor, \\"awarded occasionally to a doctoral dissertation on the traditional Chinese humanities or related cultural developments throughout East Asia that continues the tradition, which Achilles Fang exemplified, of rigorous textual research.\\"Chen Wen-yi Receives the Harvard University Achilles Fang Prize . Academica Sinica E-News 30 (August 23, 2007). Retrieved on July 27, 2009. In 1947 Fang moved to America to teach at Harvard. In 1953 he was part of a symposium on Chinese Studies that gathered together Derk Bodde, Arnold Isenberg, Schuyler Camman, J.R. Levenson, W. Theodore de Barry, David Nivison, Achilles Fang, I.A. Richards and Arthur F. Wright. The papers of this symposium appeared under the title \\"Studies in Chinese Thought\\".University of Chicago Press 1953 Fang's contribution has the title \\"Some Reflections on the Difficulty of Translation\\" in which he, among other topics, discussed the poet Pan Ku (Ban Ku, AD 32‚Äì92).  Personality  Fang was known to have a forceful personality. In a scene in Frederick Seidel's poem \\"Glory,\\" a 1953 encounter is dramatized thus: > His [Ezra Pound's] pal Achilles Fang led me to the empty attic of the > Yenching Institute, > In the vast gloom arranged two metal folding chairs > Under the one lightbulb hanging from the ceiling, > And hating me, knee to knee, > Unsmilingly asked, What do you know?Seidel, \\"Glory.\\" Indeed, Fang was not the type to hold back criticism nor to offer undeserved praise. Yet he loved teaching, and he was an extremely devoted teacher who won the affection and devotion of students, whom he sometimes invited to his home to drink beer. As far back as his days at Monumenta Serica, he would work with American exchange students who came to him for advice and help, always refusing payment, and his generosity with his time continued until the end of his life: he met with students throughout his retirement and illness, and even spent an hour with one the day before he died. Fang was an avid, even obsessive book collector. His obituarist writes: > Books were his lifelong passion. He found sympathetic souls in two Ch'ing > dynasty bibliophiles and translated their charming essays on the subject of > book collecting under the titles \\"Bookman's Decalogue\\" and \\"Bookman's > Manual.\\" After coming to the United States he began to acquire a library of > Western books and soon was as well known to Boston antiquarian dealers as he > had been in Peking's Liu-li ch'ang. His interests were catholic: Latin and > Greek literature (two complete sets of the Loeb Classics, acquired one title > at a time over the years, all used or damaged remainders), a complete > Patrology in Latin, works on philosophy and literature ancient and modern. > He pursued congenial writers relentlessly: everything by George Saintsbury, > all of Virginia Woolf in first editions, everything in print by or about > Pound and Joyce. he set up rows of stacks in his office, as in most rooms of > his house, which was threatened with collapse when he gave up his office on > retirement and brought the books home, a shopping bagful at a time over the > course of a year. Before his death he willed the collection to Peking > University Library, after sending an initial shipment of some 5,000 volumes > for which he could find no space.  Publications  It was said of Fang that \\"he knew everything, but published little.\\" Indeed, his complete bibliography runs only four pages.Fang, Ilse, \\"Bibliography of Achilles Fang.\\" Aside from his dissertation, his most significant publication may have been his heavily annotated translation of ten chapters from Sima Guang's Zizhi Tongjian, published as The Chronicle of the Three Kingdoms in Harvard-Yenching Institute Studies VI (1952). His translation and annotation of the Wen fu of Lu Ji is also widely cited.  Notes  References  * Fang, Ilse M. \\"Bibliography of Achilles Fang.\\" Monumenta Serica 45 (1997): 399‚Äì403.

Galvin was born at Newcestown, County Cork, Ireland on 23 November 1882. He was ordained a Catholic priest at St Patrick's College, Maynooth, County Kildare, in 1909 for his home diocese of Cork. He spent his first three years as a priest 'on loan' to the diocese of Brooklyn, New York. While there, in January 1912, he met Father Fraser who was en route back to China. China 1912 - 1916 In February 1912, Fr. 'Ned' Galvin left Brooklyn for China. He went first to Toronto to join Fr. Fraser and together they traveled from Vancouver to Shanghai on the Empress of India. He lived and worked with the French Vincentians in Chekiang (1912‚Äì16). In 1916 he returned to Ireland to found a society of missionary priests dedicated to the conversion of China, the Missionary Society of St. Columban. On 4 September 1916 he met a young professor from the Maynooth seminary, Fr. John Blowick, at Fr. Tom Ronayne's lodgings in Monkstown, County Dublin. On 10 October 1916 they received permission from the Irish hierarchy to establish a \\"mission house for the training of Irish missionaries for China.\\" After a brief period promoting the Society in Ireland, Edward Galvin left for the U.S. in 1917 to establish the Society there. China 1920 - 1953 He returned to Ireland to lead the first band of his missionaries to China (1920). From his arrival in China until his expulsion in 1952, Galvin would have experienced some good years, but difficulties and dangers predominated: a corrupt Chinese government, local warlords and banditry, floods, drought, the Japanese invasion. He survived the rigors of World War II, but the end of the war did not mean an end to conflicts. In 1947 he wrote \\"the peop has gone from me; the war was bad, but post-war problems are the devil entirely.\\" Expelled from China he returned to his native Ireland in 1953 and retired to Dalgan Park, Navan, County Meath, broken in spirit. He died of leukemia at St. Columbans College, Dalgan Park on 23 February 1956 and is buried there.

He was the chef de mission of the Australian Winter Olympic delegations from 1976 until 1994, and is credited with ending the neglect of winter sports in Australia.  Olympic participation  Winter sports have traditionally been unattended to by Australian Olympic officials. In 1956, the ice hockey team offered to pay their own way and the only thing that they needed from the AOF was formal permission. However, the AOF never responded to their request, and they were unable to attend, and criticised the AOF for their disinterest. One of the affected athletes was Henke.Gordon (2003), pp. 271-272. Henke became the chef de mission in 1976 and held the position for two decades, until Ian Chesterman took over in 1998.The Compendium, pp. 215-227. Henke rose to become vice- president of the AOF,Gordon (1994), p. 412. and is accredited with ending the AOF's neglect of winter sport.Gordon (1994), p. 421. Up until Henke's appointment, Colin Hickey and Malcolm Milne had been the only athletes to have placed in the top half of any event.Gordon (1994), p. 412. In 1981, Henke took AOF board members into the Australian Alps for a board meeting, allowing him to exploit the environment to promote winter sport. He said that the next Olympics \\"was the first time the AOF ever really got behind the winter team\\".Gordon (1994), p. 422. He would feature in a minor controversy with Speed Skater, Colin Coates at the 1988 Winter Olympics. While Coates, was officially listed as an Athlete for the games, he was in reality, there to coach the Speed Skating team, with his \\"Athlete\\" status, simply to enable Ice time. Coates would defy Henke and the Australian Ice Skating Federation, who had informed him, he could not race, and would end up taking part in the 10,000m race to compete at his sixth Olympic Games at age 41. Henke was so enraged at Coates, going behind his back, he almost pulled him off the Ice mid race, before deciding that, he would let Coates finish, before punishing him with a verbal attack. The 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France was viewed as the potential start of a new era in Australian winter sports, with hopes that a maiden medal would result.McAvaney, p. 132. Australia's short track relay team went into the 1992 Olympics as world champions, but the team crashed in the semi-finals.Andrews, p. 3.Gordon (1994), p. 426. Kirstie Marshall was in the process of winning the World Cup series for the year, and was one of the favourites for the women's aerial skiing, but she crash-landed and finished seventh.McAvaney p. 135. In 1994, Australia's short track relay team won Australia's first Winter Olympic medal, a bronze.Andrew, p. 251. It was a successful campaign for Henke's swansong; the largest team that Australia had sent apart from 1960, with 27 athletes, recorded an unprecedented five top 10 finishes. Marshall came sixth in aerials, while Kerryn Rim placed eighth in the 15 km biathlon and Steven Bradbury and Nizielski of the medal-winning relay team placed eighth and tenth in the 500 m and 1,000 m short track events respectively.Andrews, p. 252. In contrast to the previous games, the Australians placed in the top half of the field in six of their eight individual starts.Gordon (1994), p. 526.  Development work  Malcolm Milne's success prompted the eventual starting of the Australian Ski Federation by Henke, and their program to sponsor talented young skiers and send them to Europe to hone their craft, among them Steven Lee,Gordon (1994), p. 420. and Zali Steggall, and aerial skiers Jacqui Cooper and Kirstie Marshall.Gordon (2003), p. 280. After the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, the Olympic Winter Institute of Australia (initially called the Australian Institute of Winter Sports) was created.Gordon (2003), p. 282. It was given a million-dollar annual budget and for the first time, Australia had a federal government-funded full-time training program to accompany the Australian Institute of Sport. This led to a steady rise in the number of Australians who have won medals at World Cup events in the immediate years after the OWIA‚Äôs creation. Henke was the inaugural chairman.Gordon (2003), pp. 282-283.  Family  He married 1952 Olympic representative in figure skating Gweneth Molony, and their daughter Joanne Henke was a member of the downhill skiing team in 1976. Honours Henke was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 1987 and an Officer of the Order of Australia in 1999. In 1993 he was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame, and in 1998 he received the Olympic Order. He received an Australian Sports Medal in 2000 and a Centenary Medal in 2001. In 2008, he became the first Australian to be made a lifetime member of the International Ski Federation. In December 2009, it was announced that Rink 1 at Melbourne's soon-to-be-opened Medibank Icehouse would be named in Henke's honour.Official naming of the Henke Rink - Medibank Icehouse, 2009-12-14.

July 5, 2009. The concert, conceived by South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela and record producer Stewart Levine, was meant to be a major promotional event for the heavyweight boxing championship match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman, known as The Rumble in the Jungle. When an injury forced Foreman to postpone the fight by six weeks, the festival's intended audience of international tourists was all but eliminated and Levine had to decide whether or not to cancel the event. The decision was made to move forward, and 80,000 people attended. In addition to promoting the Ali-Foreman fight, the Zaire 74 event was intended to present and promote racial and cultural solidarity between African American and African people. Thirty one performing groups, 17 from Zaire and 14 from overseas, performed. Featured performers included top R&B; and soul artists from the United States such as James Brown, Bill Withers, B.B. King, and The Spinners as well as prominent African performers such as Miriam Makeba, TPOK Jazz, and Tabu Ley Rochereau. Other performers included Celia Cruz and the Fania All-Stars. Background and cultural influence The concert was promoted by Don King, as a part of the build-up to the Ali-Foreman fight. At the time of the event, Zaire was run by Mobutu, a dictator who became notorious for corruption, nepotism and human rights violations. Mobutu agreed to host the festival and to help cover its costs. A documentary about the Zaire 74 festival, entitled Soul Power, was released in 2009. The film was directed by Jeffrey Levy-Hinte, who served as the editor on the 1996 documentary When We Were Kings, which also contains selections of concert footage from the festival.

The preponderance of criminal cases with Canadian Catholic dioceses named as defendants that have surfaced since the 1980s strongly indicate that these cases were far more widespread than previously believed. While recent media reports have centred on Newfoundland dioceses, there have been reported cases‚Äîtested in court with criminal convictions‚Äîin almost all Canadian provinces. Sexual assault is the act of an individual touching another individual sexually and/or committing sexual activities forcefully and/or without the other person's consent. The phrase Catholic sexual abuse cases refers to acts of sexual abuse, typically child sexual abuse, by members of authority in the Catholic church, such as priests. Such cases have been occurring sporadically since the 11th century in Catholic churches around the world, including the United States. This article summarizes some of the most notable Catholic sexual abuse cases in Canadian provinces. Sexual abuse cases by province=Alberta=Fr. Robert Joesph Whyte Between 1962 and 1982, Fr.

Whyte, who received a four year prison sentence, is among at least four Basilian Order priests in Canada accused of sex abuse.https://www.theinquiry.ca/wordpress/accused/charged/accused-m- to-z/marshall-father-william-hodgson-marshall/marshall-william- hodgson/basilian-chart/ In 2016, a 52-year-old man who claimed that Whyte molested him when he was between the ages of eight and fifteen filed a lawsuit at the Calgary Courts Centre. The estate of Whyte, who died in 2014, and the Catholic Church in Alberta were each named as defendants in the lawsuit. The plaintiff, who was also serving as an altar boy at the time of the alleged abuse, requested $4 million from the Alberta Catholic church. Rev Patrick O'Neill In 1997,https://www.theinquiry.ca/wordpress/accused/charged/oneill-father- patrick-oneill/update-on-abuse-lawsuit-from-archdiocese-of-edmonton-alberta/ Archdiocese of Edmonton priest Rev.

In January 2012, a 51-year-old former altar boy who claimed he was sexually abused by O'Neill in the early and mid-1970s filed two $3.4 million lawsuits against the Archdiocese of Edmonton. =New Brunswick= As of 2017, court records indicate at least 56 cases of child sexual abuse involving the New Brunswick dioceses are currently before the courts.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/pedophile- priests-56-civil-lawsuits-1.4401729 According to one CBC report: \\"Almost every month for a year, lawsuits have been filed against the Catholic Church in New Brunswick by alleged victims seeking compensation for sexual abuse by priests.\\" =British Columbia=Archdiocese of Vancouver In 2019, the Archdiocese of Vancouver publicly named nine clergymen who were criminally convicted of sexual abuse or who had civil lawsuits related to abuse settled against them.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/catholic- archdiocese-vancouver-clergymen-sex- abuse-1.5369858#:~:text=British%20Columbia-,Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Vancouver%20names%209%20clergymen%20in%20sex%20abuse,dating%20back%20to%20the%201950s. It was also acknowledged that the Archdiocese was aware of 36 sex abuse cases since the 1950s, which involved 26 children. The Archdiocese of Vancouver was the first among Canada's 60 Catholic dioceses to make this information public. In August 2020, a new sex abuse lawsuit was filed against the Archdiocese of Vancouver.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/sexual-abuse- vancouver-archdiocese-class-action-lawsuit-2020-1.5702312 The lead plaintiff, identified only by the initials K.S. in the court documents, said the priest in charge of St. Francis of Assisi School, Father Michael Conaghan, sexually assaulted her while she was a student at the school in the '80s. She was around 11 years old at the time of the alleged abuse. Conaghan, who died four days after the lawsuit was filed, was not among the nine clergy listed by the Archdiocese in 2019. The lawsuit also alleges the Archdiocese of Vancouver followed marching orders from the Vatican for years on how to bury allegations of abuse within its parishes. Hubert Patrick O'Connor Hubert Patrick O'Connor was a Canadian Roman Catholic bishop of Prince George in British Columbia who was forced to resign following sex abuse charges filed against him. Fr. Damian Lawrence Cooper Fr. Damian Lawrence Cooper is a Vancouver priest who was first accused of sexual abuse in 1994. He was sued in the B.C. Supreme Court along with the Archdiocese of Vancouver on September 29, 2014. The plaintiff visited the priest for counseling prior to the abuse, and was sixteen years old when the sexual abuse began. Media coverage of the lawsuit unearthed the fact that, despite initial claims of having removed Fr. Cooper permanently from the priestly ministry when the abuse was first admitted in 1994, the Archdiocese of Vancouver instead sent him to work in an Archdiocese on Long Island, NY. In Long Island, he then committed \\"problems of a similar nature\\". The Archdiocese's official comments to the media referred to the abuse as \\"an affair\\" which raised public expressions of concern, including questions about whether the Archdiocese was being legally aggressive or simply remained ignorant of the nature of pastoral sexual exploitation when it equated sexual exploitation of a minor and a congregant with \\"an affair\\". Fr. Cooper was still a priest of the Archdiocese of Vancouver at this time, technically on leave, but had not been liaised (permanently removed from active ministry as a priest). He lives in Vancouver, Washington. Fr. Erlindo Molon On August 25, 2020, British Columbia justice David Crossin ordered the office of the Bishop of Kamloops and former priest Fr. Erlindo Molon, who was by then 88 years old, to pay $844,140 in damages to Rosemary Anderson, who claimed Molon raped her 75 to 100 times since 1976, when she was 26 years old.https://www.delta-optimist.com/breaking-catholic-priest-sex- abuse-victim-awarded-844-140-1.24192331 Anderson claimed Molon took advantage of her father's death to give her counseling. During the lawsuit, former Kamloops Bishop, and future Vancouver Archbishop, Adam Exner, who was previously Molon's superior, conceded during witness testimony that he knew Molon \\"was molesting people,\\" including Anderson. Exner also stated that Molon was not stripped of his priesthood status until after Anderson told him that Molon raped her and asked her to marry him. =Newfoundland= In 1988, a scandal erupted over allegations of widespread abuse of children at Mount Cashel Orphanage in Newfoundland. In 2003, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the Roman Catholic Church is responsible (\\"vicariously liable\\") for sexual abuse by its priests in the diocese of Saint George's. In February 2009, the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador ruled that the Roman Catholic Church in St. John's was responsible (\\"vicariously liable\\") for the sexual abuse of eight former altar boys by disgraced priest, Reverend James Hickey. In 2007 Reverend Wayne Dohey was charged with sexual assault and one charge of exploitation of a minor. The charges were dismissed due to insufficient evidence. The abuse allegedly occurred between 1996 and 2000 and started when the alleged victim was fourteen years old. Dohey was admitted to counseling in 2001 when the sexual relationship was acknowledged by the church. Controversy over the legality of the sexual relationship occurred because it was unclear whether Dohey was in a position of authority over the 14-year-old Anglican, who was placed at his church for mandatory community service. =Ontario= In Ottawa, Ontario historical cases of child-sexual abuse by Catholic priests within the Ottawa archdiocese date back to the 1950s. Newspaper records of documented cases involved at least 11 abuser priests and 41 victims. Among these cases was those of convicted child sex offenders, Dale Crampton, Ken Keely, Jacques Faucher and Barry McGrory: all of whom served as priests in the Ottawa diocese in the 1970 and '80s under Archbishop Joseph-Aur√®le Plourde, whose own role in these cases is well documented but was never held to account by the courts. As of 2016, the Ottawa archdiocese has paid nearly $600,000 in settlements to abuse victims in seven lawsuits since 2011. Five more lawsuits remain, with claimants seeking a total of $7.4 million. In 2016, Ottawa archbishop Terrence Prendergast acknowledged \\"the enormity of the evil\\" in connection to these cases. Dale Crampton In 1986, Dale Crampton was arrested and pled guilty to seven counts of indecent assault involving minors. Those abuses transpired between January 1973 and December 1982, while Crampton was a priest in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ottawa. The seven male victims were all between the ages of 10 and 13 when they were assaulted by Crampton. In the ensuing years subsequent to that trial, the number of sexual abuse cases grew in which Crampton was named as defendant. The scope of those new cases extended as far back as 1963, when Crampton was first ordained as a priest. As of 2017, the Ottawa Catholic diocese knew of at least 17 people who say they were victimized by Crampton as children. Angus Alexander McRae In 1989, Priest Angus Alexander McRae, Archdiocese of Edmonton, Alberta (ordained June 5, 1954) was charged with the sexual abuse of two boys in Scarborough, Ontario. He spent several years with the Canadian Armed Forces as a military chaplain. In 1980 he attended court and was sentenced to four years for sexual abuse of a young boy. The charges, which included buggery, gross indecency and indecent assault, were laid and prosecuted by military police. He served the first ten months of his four-year sentence in the CFB military prison in Edmonton before being sent to Southdown, a treatment centre for Catholic clergy. After his release from Southdown, he was taken into the Archdiocese of Toronto by Archbishop Emmett Carter, and was recycled into St. Thomas More parish in Scarborough. In 1989, he was charged with abuse in Toronto and pleaded guilty. He was then placed on three years' probation. He later claimed that he only pled guilty to spare the families further embarrassment: \\"As much as I hated it and against my conscience and to save families further embarrassment I took it on the chin.\\" McRae passed away peacefully at the Edmonton General Hospital on Friday, May 20, 2011. Charles Henry Sylvestre In August 2006 Father Charles Henry Sylvestre (born 1922) of Belle River, Ontario pled guilty to 47 counts of sexual abuse on females between the ages of nine and fourteen between 1952 and 1989. Paul Bailey, the Crown Attorney for Chatham Kent, reportedly described the case as being the \\"largest case of non-residential school sex abuse by a Roman Catholic priest\\" in North America. Local newspapers documented the lives of many of the women who refused the publication ban and spoke out about their abuse. Sylvestre was given a three-year sentence in October 2006 and died January 22, 2007, of natural causes after only three months in prison. The case was documented by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation new programme The Fifth Estate. On May 21, 2020, an Ontario appeals court dismissed a bid by the Diocese of London, where Sylvestre was employed, to drop a lawsuit filed by Irene Deschenes, who claimed that Sylvestre sexually abused her when she was a minor between 1970 and 1973. Deschenes began legal action against the Diocese of Ontario in 1996.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/london-catholic- diocese-loses-appeal-in-child-sexual-abuse-case-1.5578775 Bernard Ambrose Prince In 2008, Msgr Bernard Ambrose Prince (born in Wilno, Ontario, ordained in 1964, incarnated in 1992 in Pembroke, Ontario) pleaded guilty to charges of sexual abuse of thirteen young boys from 1964 onward. He was sentenced to four years' incarceration in 2008. He was laicized by the Catholic Church in 2009, and paroled in 2010. His crimes were known in the Canadian Catholic Church and in the Vatican before he was appointed to Rome in 1991. William Hodgson Marshall On April 30, 2020, the Canadian Supreme Court rejected an appeal from the Basilian Fathers of Toronto to not give victim Rod MacLeod a required payment of just over $2.5 million, including $500,000 in punitive damages, stemming from a sexual-assault case in the 1960s. MacLeod was abused by Father William Hodgson (Hod) Marshall, then a Basilian priest, when MacLeod was a student at St. Charles College high school in Sudbury.https://www.tvo.org/article/a-beacon-of-hope-catholic-priests- appeal-in-sex-assault-case-rejected-by-supreme-court A jury had previously ordered the Basilian Fathers of Toronto to make the payment in April 2018 by a jury.https://www.sudbury.com/local-news/victim-of-abuse-by-sudbury-priest- awarded-25m-907564 Marshall, who died in 2014 at the age of 92, pled guilty in 2011 to 16 counts of indecent assault of minors and one count of sexual assault for incidents that occurred between 1952 and 1986 when he taught at Assumption and Holy Names high schools in Windsor, plus other Catholic high schools in Toronto and Sudbury.https://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/glad- he-is-gone-says-victim-as-pedophile-priest-hod-marshall-passes-away-at-92/ He was sentenced to two years in prison, and served 16 months of his sentence before being released on probation in 2012. However, Marshall, who was given the nickname \\"Happy Hands\\" in the 1950s due to his tendency to touch students, later pled guilty to more sex abuse charges stemming from his time in Saskatchewan. Kenneth O'Keefe In September 2012, Basilian order priest Kenneth O'Keefe, who taught at various Catholic schools in the Ottawa area, received a nine-month house arrest sentence after pleading guilty to inappropriately touching a 16-year-old who was a student at Ottawa's St. Pius high school during a sleepover at his apartment in 1974.https://www.theinquiry.ca/wordpress/accused/charged/okeefe-father- kenneth-okeefe/aging-priest-sentenced-to-house-arrest-for-sex-assault-on- student-related-articles/ In January 2013, O'Keefe received an additional sentence of nine months house arrest after pleading another \\"indecently assaulting\\" a then-17-year-old boy who was a student at Ottawa's St. Joseph's Catholic School over the course of four months between September and December, 1969 as well.https://windsorstar.com/news/priest-and-ex-windsor-teacher- pleads-guilty-to-sex-assault-for-second-time-in-a-year =Nova Scotia= On August 7, 2009, bishop Raymond Lahey announced that the Diocese of Antigonish had reached a $15 million settlement in a class action lawsuit filed by victims of sexual abuse by diocese priests dating back to 1950. On September 15, 2009, he was arrested at the Ottawa airport after the border services agency uncovered hundreds of unlawful images (child pornography) on his laptop computer. Lahey was \\"sentenced to 15 months in prison and two years' probation, but received a two-for-one credit for the time he served\\". =Saskatchewan= In 2013, convicted Ontario Basilian priest Hod Marshall received a six-month house arrest sentence after pleading guilty to sexually assaulting two Saskatoon boys in 1959 and 1961. =Quebec= The institution Coll√®ge Notre-Dame du Sacr√©-C≈ìur came into the public eye for a multitude of sex abuse cases and cover-ups spanning mare than the second half of the 20th century. In December 2012, it was reported that a deacon at a congregation in Beaconsfield, Quebec, and \\"a spokesperson for the Catholic Church on issues of child abuse\\", was charged with possession and distribution of child pornography after police seized more than 2,000 photos, as well as computers and hard drives, at locations in Beaconsfield and Pointe-Claire. =Nunavut= On September 12, 2014, de-frocked Catholic priest Eric Dejaeger (born April 24, 1947, ordained in 1978) \\"was convicted of 24 counts of indecent assault, one of unlawful confinement, two of buggery, three of unlawful sexual intercourse, one of sexual assault and one of bestiality\\" that he committed during his time in the priesthood in the Roman Catholic mission in Igloolik, between 1978 and 1982. He had already been convicted for 11 counts of sexual assault and indecent assault against children at his previous post in Baker Lake, Nunavut. Allegation against former nuncio On 22 February a Canadian man, Christian Vachon, claimed that former nuncio to Canada Luigi Ventura had touched him improperly in July 2008 when he was 32. Vachon said Ventura's successor as Nuncio to Canada, Archbishop Luigi Bonazzi, called him the day he registered his complaint to discuss it. On July 23, 2020, it was reported that Ventura, who is facing trial in France for later sex abuse allegations, was still under investigation for the alleged 2008 incident in Ottawa.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/07/23/popes-former-french- ambassador-stand-trial-sexual-assault-paris/https://www.ndtv.com/world- news/pope-francis-ex-envoy-luigi-ventura-to-stand-trial-for-sexual-assault- charges-2267783 Residential schools By 1912, thousands of First Nations children attended residential schools, many of which were run by the Catholic Church. In 1990, Manitoba leader Phil Fontaine revealed that he had been sexually and physically abused in a Catholic residential school. He claimed that sexual abuse was common in residential schools in general. \\"In my grade three class, if there were 20 boys, every single one of them would have experienced what I experienced.

In 1933, Robert Haider moved to Bavaria but returned to Austria the following year after the failed Nazi attempt to overthrow the Austrian government. He was arrested and chose to move back to Germany where he joined the Austrian Legion, a division of the Sturmabteilung. Haider senior completed a two-year military service in Germany and returned to Austria in 1938 after it was annexed by Nazi Germany (the Anschluss). From 1940 on, he fought as a junior officer on the Western and Eastern Fronts in Europe during the Second World War. Having been wounded several times, he was discharged from the Wehrmacht with the rank of lieutenant. In 1945, he married Dorothea Rupp, at that time a leader in the Bund Deutscher M√§del (BDM). Following the end of the war, Haider's parents were investigated as part of the denazification process, conducted to determine what measures should be taken against them because of their NSDAP membership (proceedings against all former Nazis--NSDAP members and collaborators--were undertaken as a matter of law in both Austria and Germany after the war ended). They were labelled as \\"Minderbelastet\\" (meaning \\"compromised to a lesser degree\\", i.e. low-ranking in the NSDAP structure). Robert Haider found a job in a shoe factory. Dorothea Haider, who had been a teacher, was prohibited from teaching for a few years following the end of the war. Robert was forced to dig graves. Haider's mother eventually outlived him, turning ninety on the day he died. =Early life= Haider was born in the Upper Austrian town of Bad Goisern in 1950, a time when his parents' finances were rather moderate, and his elder sister, Ursula, was five years old. He performed well at primary school and attended high school in Bad Ischl despite his parents' financial situation. Haider was reportedly always at the top of his class at high school. During his time in Bad Ischl, he had first contacts with nationalist organisations, such as the Burschenschaft Albia, a right-wing student group. After he graduated with highest distinction in 1968, he was drafted into the Austrian Army, where he voluntarily spent more than the compulsory nine months (called \\"the voluntary one year\\"). After his discharge in 1969, he moved to Vienna and began studying Law and Political Science at the University of Vienna. He graduated in 1973 with the title of Dr iur. During his studies, he was affiliated again with a Burschenschaft: Silvania. In 1974, he started to work at the University of Vienna law faculty in the department of constitutional law. =Marriage and children= Haider was married to Claudia Hoffmann from 1 May 1976 until his death. They had two daughters. =B√§rental estate= Location of the state of Carinthia in the south of Austria. Throughout his career Haider had concentrated his politics on Carinthia. His personal life was heavily connected with this part of Austria: Haider became wealthy in 1983 when he inherited the estate of Wilhelm Webhofer, who had owned a large parcel of land in Carinthia commonly known as \\"B√§rental\\" (bear valley). This estate has a history that came up in the 1990s in the Austrian media. The land had been owned by an Italian Jew until 1941. At that point in time the Nazis still hesitated to take possession of property owned by non-German Jews without any compensation. Inside Italy, Jewish property was not yet open for confiscation and the Mussolini government was not inclined to allow this happen to Jewish nationals abroad either. Thus when the estate was sold in 1941, one Josef Webhofer (a former resident of South Tyrol, Italy, and an Optant) paid 300,000 Reichsmark (equivalent to million euros) to obtain title to the land. After the war, Mathilde Roifer, the widow of the former Jewish owner of B√§rental, demanded compensation. Despite a panel finding that the property was fairly sold, Webhofer paid Roifer an additional 850,000 schillings (about $1 million today). In 1955 Josef Webhofer's son, Wilhelm, not a blood relative of Haider but rather a \\"Wahlonkel\\" or uncle-by-choice, inherited the estate and later bequeathed it to Haider. Today the land is estimated to be worth about $15 million. Political career=Rise to power in the FP√ñ= The Austrian Freedom Party (FP√ñ) was founded in 1955, and initially was a mixture of various political currents opposed both to the political Catholicism of the Austrian People's Party and the socialist views of the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SP√ñ). With its roots in the Pan-German movement, it included both German-nationalist and liberal political views. In 1970 Haider became the leader of the FP√ñ youth movement and headed it until 1974. Haider rose rapidly through the party ranks. In 1972, at the age of 22, he was already a well- established leader and was made party affairs manager of the Carinthian FP√ñ in 1976. In 1979 he was the youngest delegate among the 183 members of parliament, at age 29. Beginning in 1983 his policies became more aggressive, when he rose to party head of the Carinthian FP√ñ and started to criticise the leaders of the FP√ñ, which at that time was still a minor political movement in Austria, usually winning only about 5‚Äì6% of the vote.; on the semi-peripheral status of the Carinthian economy at that times as well as the socio-economic dynamics of the situation of the Slovenian minority in Austria see: Arno Tausch and Otmar H√∂ll, 1980 \\"Austria and the European Periphery\\" in 'European Studies of Development' (J. de BANDT J./MANDI P./SEERS D. (Eds.)) Macmillan, London: pp. 28-37. The decisive point of his career came in 1986 when he defeated Austrian Vice Chancellor Norbert Steger in the vote for party leadership at the party convention in September in Innsbruck; many delegates feared that Steger's liberal political views and his coalition with the Social Democrats threatened the party's existence. =Political struggle in Carinthia= Until 1989, the SP√ñ held an absolute majority in the Austrian province of Carinthia; when it received less than 50% of seats in 1989, √ñVP and FP√ñ formed a coalition and elected Haider as Landeshauptmann (governor) of Carinthia. In 1991, in a debate in the regional parliament, a Socialist leader attacked Haider's plan of reducing unemployment payments for people seen as \\"freeloaders\\", calling it forced work placement reminiscent of Nazi policies. Haider replied, \\"No, they didn't have that in the Third Reich, because in the Third Reich they had a proper employment policy, which not even your government in Vienna can manage to bring about.\\" Haider claimed that the legislators understood his comment as a criticism of the present Austrian government, but in the days that followed the SP√ñ joined with the √ñVP in a vote of no confidence against him. Haider had to resign his post as governor and the FP√ñ‚Äì√ñVP coalition was replaced by an SP√ñ‚Äì√ñVP coalition. Although the remark was costly both for Haider and the FP√ñ, a country-wide poll reported that 42% of Austrians considered the press's treatment exaggerated, and 33% believed Haider's remarks to be based in fact. In 1999, Haider again was elected governor of Carinthia by the Carinthian parliament, where the FP√ñ now held a plurality of more than 42%. Even after the FP√ñ fell to only 10% from 27% in the national elections in 2002, Haider's support in Carinthia did not diminish and he succeeded in the 2004 elections receiving a slightly higher percentage (42.5%) than in 1999. =FP√ñ chairman=Haider as opposition leader Under Haider's leadership, the FP√ñ moved to the right, reflecting Haider's nationalist, anti-immigration, and anti-EU views. Haider relied primarily on populism (see below) to advance his interests. From 1986 when Haider became the FP√ñ's chairman the party's share in elections rose from 5% in the 1983 elections to almost 27% in 1999. With Haider practically leading the FP√ñ single-handedly, he was able to unite the scattered, divided extreme- right in Austria and establish a party that was not so much founded on leading personalities or an ideology but on just one leader ‚Äì Haider himself, who used to change his opinions frequently. His style of governing the party became authoritarian in the following years, however his followers did not challenge his ultimate authority in the party, especially because Haider was able to gain one victory after another in elections. An exception was the split off by the Liberal Forum in the mid-1990s headed by Heide Schmidt, a long-time political supporter of Haider and the FP√ñ's candidate for presidency in 1992. The liberals initially gained the support of about 6% of the voters nationwide, but Schmidt was not able to uphold this support and the Liberal Forum subsequently dropped out of parliament in 1999. The party's mixture of populism, anti-establishment and nationalist themes steadily gained support over the years. In addition to far-right voters, the FP√ñ was able to attract voters from both the Social Democrats and the Conservatives in both the national and regional elections of the 1990s, mostly those who were fed up with decades of government by the 'Great Coalition' (see also: Proporz). Coalition government with Wolfgang Sch√ºssel's People's party In 2000, Haider's Freedom Party unexpectedly became second after the Social Democrats (SP√ñ) in the 1999 parliamentary elections. After efforts by the runner-up, the √ñVP, to renew its coalition with the Social Democrats failed, the √ñVP reached an agreement with the FP√ñ. Normally, Haider should have become chancellor. Deemed too controversial to be part of the government, let alone head it, he stepped aside in favour of √ñVP leader Wolfgang Sch√ºssel. The coalition caused widespread outrage both in Austria and the rest of Europe. The heads of government of the other fourteen EU members decided to cease cooperation with the Austrian government, as it was felt in many countries that the cordon sanitaire against coalitions with parties considered as right-wing extremists, which had mostly held in Western Europe since 1945, had been breached. For several months, other national leaders shunned diplomatic contacts with members of the Sch√ºssel government. Supporters of the government often blamed social democrats and President Thomas Klestil for these sanctions, and questioned their loyalty to the country. At the end of February 2000, Haider stepped down from the leadership of the Freedom Party. This was widely regarded as a cynical move to appease foreign criticism, as he appeared to continue to control the party from behind the scenes, with his successor, Vice-Chancellor Susanne Riess-Passer, being only pro-forma in charge. Haider proclaimed that his move was just the fulfillment of his promise to Carinthian FP√ñ voters that he had given prior to the election that had been held that same year. Following analyses of the diplomatic sanctions, EU leaders came to believe that the measures were counterproductive and returned to normality in September 2000, even though the coalition remained unchanged. =Collapse of the first coalition and decline of the Freedom Party= J√∂rg Haider wearing lederhosen at a meeting of his party BZ√ñ (2006) In September 2002, after a special party convention in Knittelfeld (Styria), the so-called Knittelfeld Putsch, Riess-Passer lost the support of many party members. This meeting is also sometimes considered as a rebellion against the members which are currently involved in the government, which was thought to be started or at least supported by Haider. Thus Riess-Passer resigned as Vice Chancellor and Party Chairwoman. With her, Karl-Heinz Grasser, the finance minister, and Peter Westenthaler, the head of the Freedom Party's Parliament Club, also resigned. This triggered general elections in November, which resulted in a victory with 42.3% of the vote for the conservative Austrian People's Party (√ñVP) led by Federal Chancellor Wolfgang Sch√ºssel. Haider's Freedom Party, which in 1999 was slightly stronger than Sch√ºssel's party, was reduced to 10.16% of the vote. In response, Haider stated that he had demanded that the leader of the FP√ñ must step down to allow him to be leader, and on being refused, stated that he would leave federal politics permanently. In October 2003, in a cabinet reshuffle instigated by Haider, Herbert Haupt stepped down as Vice Chancellor and was replaced by Hubert Gorbach. On 7 March 2004, the FP√ñ won a plurality (42.5%) of the vote in the elections for the Carinthian parliament. On 31 March 2004, Haider was re-elected Governor of Carinthia by the FP√ñ and SP√ñ members of the state parliament. However, outside Carinthia, Haider's charisma seemed to have largely lost its appeal among voters. The FP√ñ incurred devastating losses in several regional elections, the 2004 European elections and in elections for the Austrian Chamber of Commerce. In each of those elections, it lost between one half to two thirds of their previous voters. =Creation of a new party= As a consequence, the FP√ñ, whose chair was Haider's sister, Ursula Haubner, was riven with internal strife. On 4 April 2005, Haider, Haubner, Vice Chancellor Hubert Gorbach and other leading figures of the FP√ñ announced the creation of a new party called Alliance for the Future of Austria (B√ºndnis Zukunft √ñsterreich, BZ√ñ) with Haider as leader. In effect, this split the FP√ñ into two parties. In the following months, the BZ√ñ tried to establish itself within the Austrian political landscape, but met little success. Haider and his new party remained in the coalition with the People's party, leading to fierce fights between the FP√ñ and BZ√ñ following the split-up. Subsequent polls showed that both parties were losing voter approval and in danger of failing to reach the critical 4% of the national vote barrier required for representation in parliament. In the 2006 general elections, the BZ√ñ received 4.1% of votes, thus narrowly securing its representation of 7 seats in parliament. The FP√ñ, now led by Heinz-Christian Strache surpassed initial expectations, receiving 11.0% of the vote, 532 votes behind the Greens. From June 2006 to August 2008, the BZ√ñ was led by Peter Westenthaler. On 30 August 2008, shortly before the legislative election, Haider re-assumed the party chairmanship. Subsequently, the BZ√ñ received 10.7% of votes, and the FP√ñ 17.5% of votes. =Stefan Petzner= Stefan Petzner, Haider's designated successor as party chairman, stated in an ORF radio interview on 19 October 2008, that at the time of Haider's death he and the politician were in a relationship which \\"went far beyond friendship\\" with the full knowledge of the latter's wife. Petzner also said that \\"J√∂rg and I were connected by something truly special. He was the man of my life ().\\" The term Lebensmensch can imply an intimate relationship but can also be interpreted as \\"icon\\" or \\"mentor\\".article by William J. Kole, Associated Press, ‚Äì Fri 24 October, 7:31 am titled: Was Austrian far-right leader Joerg Haider gay? Associated Press reported Petzner's comments as \\"J√∂rg and I were connected by something truly special. He was the man of my life ... I loved him as a best friend.\\" Haider had neither confirmed nor denied the widespread rumours about his sexuality, but he was often criticised for surrounding himself with young men in his political movement, which was nicknamed 'Haider's boys' party'. Political views Since beginning his political career in the 1970s, Haider was critical of mainstream Austrian politics. He used simple slogans to raise his popularity by exploiting issues where he saw the general public perceived injustice or the self-interest of big party politics (specifically the SP√ñ and the Austrian People's Party). In a 27 September 2008 talk show on ORF television, Haider described the boards of directors of numerous world banks as \\"mafia\\". Haider also advocated the creation of heavier punishments for banking managers and proposed the creation of a special Legal Court against financial crimes, in one of his last interviews to the Austrian Kleine Zeitung daily.Sein letztes Interview: Haider fordert eine Regierung der Einheit 10 October 2008. Retrieved 4 December 2008 Het Vrije Volk, 13 October 2008 J√∂rg Haider over de bankenmaffia. (Dutch language) Retrieved: idem. Haider supported fighting against inflation, and paying a minimum salary of ‚Ç¨1000 per month, as well as ‚Ç¨1000 per month for mothers. He also supported reforming the Austrian social insurance system with one insurance company per profession. Until 2005 Haider was for the entry of Turkey into the European Union. Later, he urged that decisions like the treaty for the European Union, or the entrance of Turkey into the European Union should be decided by a referendum.BZ√ñ Election Program 2008 T√ºrkei gegen junge \\"Hornochsen\\" =Immigration= Throughout his career, Haider vigorously opposed immigration and Islam. In the early 1990s, Haider proclaimed: =Language policy= One of Haider's main political struggles was the one against bilingualism in southern Carinthia, where an indigenous Slovene ethnic-linguistic community, known as the Carinthian Slovenes, lives. Already in the 1980s, Haider pursued a policy of segregation in schools, insisting on physically dividing the Slovene and German-speaking pupils in elementary schools in southern Carinthia. In December 2001, the Austrian Constitutional Court ruled that topographic road signs in all settlements in Carinthia which have had more than 10% of Slovene-speaking inhabitants over a longer period of time, should be written both in German and Slovene. Haider refused to carry out this decision, which has been reiterated by the Court several times thereafter, and publicly threatened to sue the president of the Constitutional Court. Instead of erecting hundreds of new bilingual signs, as ruled by the court, Haider ordered the removal of several existing ones, which triggered a wave of protest among the local Slovene minority, including acts of civil disobedience. In May 2006, Haider personally moved the road sign of the town of Bleiburg () in south-eastern Carinthia for several meters as the response to the decision of the Constitutional Court which ruled the sign was unconstitutional because it was written only in German. He compared himself to Jesus Christ who moved the stone over his tomb, provoking indignation by the local Roman Catholic clergy. After the Court condemned his action as illegal, Haider threatened to call a regional referendum on the issue, for which he was publicly admonished by the Federal President Heinz Fischer. The referendum was blocked by the decision of the Federal institutions which found it unconstitutional. In December 2006, Haider tried to bypass the ruling of the Constitutional Court by attaching less prominent plaques with Slovene placenames to German road signs, which was again found unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court. Haider nevertheless disregarded the Court's decision and pursued his action. In his last speech, delivered on the celebration of the 88th anniversary of the Carinthian Plebiscite only a few hours before his death, Haider reiterated his opposition to any kind of visual bilingualism in the region and warned the Slovene politicians \\"not to play with fire\\". Support from Muammar al-Gaddafi and Saddam Hussein Haider was also known to have visited Iraq to meet Saddam Hussein on the eve of the 2003 Iraq War, as well as having had a friendship with Muammar Gaddafi when Libya was an international pariah. Criticism by Arnold Schwarzenegger In 2000, Austrian-American politician Arnold Schwarzenegger criticised anti-immigrant remarks made by Haider: \\"As an immigrant myself, I am offended by anyone who makes anti-immigrant statements, and it is my opinion that someone who makes statements like Haider‚Äôs has no place in government. I have never supported him in the past and do not now. I am hopeful that Austria will find a way through this. As an Austrian-born, I am so saddened that, with all the progress we have made working for an open and tolerant society, one man‚Äôs statements can taint world opinion of an entire country. I know that there are many tolerant people in Austria. It is my hope that their voices can and will be heard.‚Äù Allegations of Nazi sympathies and anti-semitism Haider was frequently criticized for statements in praise of Nazi policies, or considered antisemitic. International reports on Haider often referred to his remark that the Nazi government had produced a \\"proper employment policy\\" as compared to the SP√ñ government. He was forced to resign as governor of the Carinthia province in 1991 because of the incident. Haider years later apologized. On one occasion during a parliamentary debate, Haider described World War II concentration camps as \\"punishment camps\\". On several occasions Haider made remarks about Austrian World War II veterans that were represented as broad endorsement of the war and of the Nazi SS. Speaking to a gathering of veterans from several countries in 1990, he said that the veterans were \\"decent people of good character\\" and \\"remain true to their convictions\\". Haider stated that he did not specifically address Waffen-SS veterans with his remarks. On another occasion, he said, \\"the Waffen-SS was part of the Wehrmacht (German military) and because of that it deserves every honour and recognition\\". (The Waffen-SS was not part of the Wehrmacht.) In 2000, at a gathering of Wehrmacht veterans in Ulrichsberg, including Waffen-SS veterans, he said, \\"Those who come to Ulrichsberg are not the old Nazis. They are not neo-Nazis, they are not criminals.\\" Haider also compared the deportation of Jews by the Nazis to the expulsion of Sudeten Germans from Czechoslovakia after World War II. His detractors pointed to a punning reference to the leader of the Jewish community of Vienna, Ariel Muzicant; Haider indicated that he did not understand how someone named Ariel (also the name of a popular laundry detergent) could have gathered so much filth, implying the real estate agent's business methods were crooked. Haider's critics characterized the remark as antisemitic. He maintained that Muzicant faked antisemitic hate letters to himself. He later withdrew this and other accusations, and apologized for his \\"derogatory remarks\\". Haider was closely watched by Mossad, the Israeli secret service; FP√ñ secretary general Peter Sichrovsky ‚Äì a Jewish-Austrian politician and formerly one of Haider's closest aides ‚Äì had gathered inside information on Haider's controversial contacts with prominent \\"Arab dictators\\".Mossad Spied on far-rightist Austrian, The Times, 2 June 2005; retrieved 4 December 2008 Due to Haider's perceived contacts to Holocaust deniers, the Israeli Foreign Ministry on 29 September 2008 declared it was heavily concerned about the 2008 Austrian elections;Foreign Ministry 'concerned' over Austrian elections YNet (Israel)/Haaretz, 29 September 2008, Retrieved 4 December 2008 a spokesman of the ministry said that Israeli officials were \\"very worried about the rise to power of people who promote hatred, Holocaust denial, and befriend Neo-Nazis. We see it as a disturbing development and are following the matter very closely.\\"Ibid., Ynet.co.il; accessed 16 July 2018. Death and aftermath Haider died of injuries from a car crash at Lambichl in K√∂ttmannsdorf near Klagenfurt, in the state of Carinthia, in the early hours of 11 October 2008. He had been on his way to celebrate his mother's 90th birthday. Police reported that the Volkswagen Phaeton that Haider had been driving came off the road, rolled down an embankment, and overturned, causing him \\"severe head and chest injuries\\". He had also allegedly been meeting with a young man after having previously quarreled with Stefan Petzner that same evening. He was alone in the government car and no other vehicles were involved. At the time of the crash, Haider's car was travelling at 142 km/h (88 mph) or faster, more than twice the legal speed limit of 70 km/h (43 mph) for that part of the Loiblpass road.. The print edition of the Austrian Daily \\"√ñsterreich\\" reported on 16 October that the car's velocity was 170 kilometers per hour, and that the estimates of the speed of 140 kilometers have to be revised upwards, because the traffic sign, with which Dr. Haider's car first collided, reduced the initial high speed An initial investigation uncovered no signs of foul play, and conspiracy theories about the death have been strongly rejected by the Austrian police. Haider's widow denies that her husband was gay and questions the official account of the accident. Haider's blood alcohol level at the time of the crash was 1.8 mg/l, more than three times the legal limit of 0.5 mg/l. This fact was noted by both Haider's spokesman and the state prosecutor. The director general of the Carinthian administration declared that in case the Governor had been intoxicated, the state would have the right to recourse for the damaged car against Haider's descendants. Austrian President Heinz Fischer said of Haider's death that it was a \\"human tragedy\\". Reactions in the press were mixed. Wolfgang Fellner, publisher of √ñsterreich, wrote: \\"I have fought bitterly\\" with J√∂rg Haider, but \\"finally, Haider became a gentle, considerate, almost wise politician ... Alas, he was once again too fast.\\" Haider \\"died as he lived: always full throttle, always over the limit\\", Fellner concluded.Summary of comments from the Austrian press on Haider's death, Vorarlberg Online, 11 October 2008 But Ernst Trost pointed out in the Kronen Zeitung that while Haider had enjoyed a \\"comet-like rise\\" in politics, he also had \\"ever again embarked on self-destructive actions and provoked opposition.\\" The Chief Editor of Kurier, Christoph Kotanko, wrote that \\"however much his brown tones, xenophobia and aggressive populism were to be rejected ... Haider's criticism of the dominant conditions of the 1980s and 90s was partly also justified\\", and he had \\"named, fought and in part also changed\\" those conditions. On 25 January 2009, the Lippitzbachbr√ºcke, a motorway bridge in Carinthia, was renamed to \\"J√∂rg-Haider-Br√ºcke\\". In 2009, the consequences of Haider's financial policies became apparent when the Bavarian-Carinthian Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank International got into serious difficulties, later leading to the bank's nationalization. Swiss paper Tagesanzeiger wrote about \\"Haider's money destruction machine\\". Carinthia now has the highest per-capita debt in Austria. =Posthumous controversies= Haider's widow, Claudia, sued the German newspaper Bild-Zeitung for publishing interviews with a man claiming to have been J√∂rg Haider's lover for many years. In October 2009, an Austrian court ruled it illegal for media to call J√∂rg Haider a homosexual because it would be a \\"breach of personal and privacy rights\\". In its ruling the court threatened a fine of up to ‚Ç¨100,000 for anybody \\"who claims or distributes the claim that J√∂rg Haider was a homosexual and/or bisexual and/or that he has had a male lover\\".Newspapers sentenced for 'gay Haider' reports, AustrianTimes.at, 19 November 2009. The Graz provincial court also issued same preliminary injunctions against Bild-Zeitung, the Austrian paper √ñsterreich and the Austrian magazine News. According to a confiscated black booklet handwritten by Walter Meischberger, a former Freedom Party politician, Austrian authorities said they would examine a diary that allegedly detailed money transfers from Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi. The diary reportedly mentions a US$58.7m transfer from Gaddafi, as well as more than US$13.3m that unidentified individuals brought back from Iraq. It also references an anonymous confidant who supposedly brought a suitcase filled with $6.6m from Switzerland to Munich for investment purposes; the money was supposed to have come from a Swiss account belonging to the deceased Uday Hussein and Qusay Hussein.

An early defender of the ideas of Copernicus, Kepler and Galileo, Ismael Bullialdus has been called \\"the most noted astronomer of his generation\\". One of his books is Astronomia Philolaica (1645).. As cited by .  Life and career  Ismael Bullialdus was the second-born to his Calvinist parents, Susanna Motet and Ismael Bullialdus. His father was a notary by profession and an amateur astronomer who made observations in Loudun, France. His older brother was originally named after their father Ismael, but died shortly after birth. At the age of 21, Bullialdus converted to Roman Catholicism and was ordained at age 26. One year later, in 1632, he moved to Paris. Enjoying the patronage of the de Thou family, Bullialdus worked for 30 years in Paris as a librarian associated with the brothers Jacques and Pierre Dupuy, who were working on the Biblioth√®que du Roi (Bibliothe), France's first royal library. After the death of his employers, the brothers Dupuy, Bullialdus became secretary to the French ambassador of Holland. After a dispute with him in 1666, however, he once again moved, this time to the Coll√®ge de Laon, where he worked again as a librarian. Bullialdus published his first work De Natura Lucis in 1638, which he followed with many more published works, ranging from books to published correspondence during his time involved with the Republic of Letters. He was one of the earliest members to be elected as a foreign associate into the Royal Society of London on April 4, 1667, only seven years after the Society was founded. He spent the last five years of his life as a priest, the same occupation in which he started his career. He retired to the Abbey St. Victor in Paris, where he died at the age of 89.  Involvement in the Republic of Letters  Bullialdus was an active member of the Republic of Letters, the long-distance intellectual correspondence network that had emerged as an international community of self- proclaimed scholars and literary figures. Bullialdus was a prolific correspondent, with around 5,000 letters that have survived to this day. His letters demonstrate the geographic reach of the Republic of Letters; he corresponded with scholars not only in nearby countries like Holland and Italy, but also in Scandinavia, Poland, and the Near East. Around 4,200 of them are in the Collection Boulliau of the Biblioth√®que nationale de France (formerly the \\"Biblioth√®que du Roi\\") with another 800 to or from him that are outside the collection in 45 different archives in nearly a dozen countries. Unfortunately, many of his manuscripts are lost; shortly after his death, his entire library‚Äîbooks, manuscripts and correspondence‚Äîwas dispersed. The most famous of the known letters included in the original Archive Boulliau include correspondence with notable luminaries, including Galileo, Marin Mersenne, Henry Oldenburg, Christiaan Huygens, and Fermat. In addition to his own letters, Bullialdus contributed to \\"The Archives of the Scientific Revolution\\". Among Bullialdus' papers were notes and examinations of rare manuscripts. Also found among his letters were copies of his contemporaries' manuscripts which he had preserved. Arguably most notable were the ten volumes of original autographs addressed to Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc.  Principal works  Opus novum ad arithmeticam infinitorum libris sex comprehensum, 1682 *De natura lucis (1638) *Philolaus (1639) *Expositio rerum mathematicarum ad legendum Platonem utilium, translation of Theon of Smyrna (1644) *Astronomia philolaica (1645) e-rara.ch *De lineis spiralibus (1657) *Opus novum ad arithmeticam infinitorum (1682) *Ad astronomos monita duo (1667) Ismael Bullialdus' most famous work is Astronomia Philolaica. Published in 1645, the book is considered by some modern-day historians of science to be the most important book in astronomy between Kepler and Newton. The book widened the awareness of Kepler's planetary ellipses, however, whereas Kepler used a physical cause to explain planetary motion, and called on math and science to support his theory, Bullialdus offered an entirely new cosmology, the \\"Conical Hypothesis\\". =Assumptions of Philolaic Astronomy= Bullialdus' Philolaic Astronomy consists of 14 main assumptions: # Planets have a simple motion in a simple line. # Planetary revolutions are equal, perpetual, uniform. # They should be regular revolutions or composed of regular revolutions. # They can only be circular. # Or composed of circles. # Motions should have a principle of equality. # Since they admit of a certain inequality, the center of the zodiac must be the reference point of inequality. # This point is in the sun. # Half of the inequality is attributed to eccentricity, the other to another cause which makes the planet slower at aphelion, less slow at perihelion, without disturbing the equality of motion or transposing it to some other place, whether the circle or the surface. # When the planet, moving from aphelion, comes to quadrature on the same surface, with equal motion, it should differ from the apparent motion of the first inequality completely or nearly so; but because the other half [of the inequality] is due to the distance [between] the circles, the center of planetary motion must be between the points of true and apparent motion. # Since the equal motion in the first quadrant is greater than the apparent motion, that part of apparent motion must be greater, hence from the first quadrant to perihelion the arc described going to perihelion must be larger than the first. # All revolution is composed of circular parts; the same is true of each part. # Equal motion is uniform; thus, the motion in coming from aphelion corresponds to the larger parallel circles, which increase from aphelion to perihelion. This equal motion does not correspond to a single circle, but to several unequal circles to which the apparent motion also corresponds; the apparent motion includes all the circles on the same surface. The motion must [also] be eccentric and inclined. # These circles follow one another in a continuous series and are all parallel among themselves; they do not overlap or enclose one another; the apparent motion forms a solid surface containing larger and smaller circles. alt= = Bullialdus' hypothesis, not for economists = * Conical Hypothesis: \\"The Planets, according to that astronomer [Boulliau], always revolve in circles; for that being the most perfect figure, it is impossible they should revolve in any other. No one of them, however, continues to move in any one circle, but is perpetually passing from one to another, through an infinite number of circles, in the course of each revolution; for an ellipse, said he, is an oblique section of a cone, and in a cone, betwixt the vertices of the ellipse there is an infinite number of circles, out of the infinitely small portions of which the elliptical line is compounded. The Planet, therefore, which moves in this line, is, in every point of it, moving in an infinitely small portion of a certain circle. The motion of each Planet, too, according to him, was necessarily, for the same reason, perfectly equable. An equable motion being the most perfect of all motions. It was not, however, in the elliptical line, that it was equable, but in any one of the circles that were parallel to the base of that cone, by whose section this elliptical line had been formed: for, if a ray was extended from the Planet to any one of those circles, and carried along by its periodical motion, it would cut off equal portions of that circle in equal times; another most fantastical equalizing circle, supported by no other foundation besides the frivolous connection betwixt a cone and an ellipse, and recommended by nothing but the natural passion for circular orbits and equable motions,\\" (Adam Smith, History of Astronomy, IV.55-57).

The film stars George Sanders as a ruthless cad who uses women to rise in Parisian society, co-starring Angela Lansbury and Ann Dvorak. It is based on the 1885 Guy de Maupassant novel Bel Ami. The film had a 1946 premiere in Paris, Texas. The score is by Darius Milhaud. Plot In Paris in 1880, Georges Duroy, an ex-soldier working as a poorly paid clerk, encounters his former comrade-in-arms, sickly journalist Charles Forestier. Rachel, already rebuffed once by Georges, sits down at their cafe table. After Georges rudely dismisses her, Charles tells him the quickest way to better himself in Paris is by using his charms on women. Charles then suggests he seek a vacancy at his newspaper, La Vie Fran√ßaise, despite having no writing experience. Georges then takes Charles' advice and goes to Rachel. He meets widow Clotilde de Marelle at a dinner party hosted by Charles and his wife. Charles' publisher is also a guest; he asks Georges for a sample article by the next day. Georges has great difficulty organizing his work, so he asks Charles for assistance the next morning. Charles sends him to see his wife Madeleine, as he has trained her. She helps him land the job. She also suggests he call on her friend Clotilde. He takes Clotilde dancing at a raucous nightspot. The singer there sings \\"Bel Ami\\", which is about a scoundrel. Clotilde calls Georges Bel Ami; he promises to live up (or down) to that name. While they are out one night, Rachel spots them and makes a scene. Afterward, Clotilde writes Georges a letter in which she confesses she loves him so much that there is nothing she cannot forgive him. At work, Charles states he has trained Georges to be his successor; his health is deteriorating. Georges tells Madeleine that he has fallen a little in love with her. She wants only to remain his friend. Georges then tells her of his idea: to write a gossip column, filled with innuendo and rumors. Madeleine thinks this is a magnificent plan. Georges gains another admirer in Suzanne Walter, the 16-year-old daughter of his employer, and an enemy, the politician Laroche-Mathieu. Clotilde informs him that the wealthy, good Jacques Rival has proposed to her, but that she wants to marry him. He tells her that he must either conquer Paris or be conquered. He states his heart tells him that he could be happy with her, but he has not listened to it \\"in a long time.\\" After Charles dies, Georges proposes to Madeleine. She accepts, but insists it be a marriage of equals. The column is a great success. Georges becomes powerful, and Madeleine presides over an influential salon. Georges juggles not only the affections of Madeleine and Clotilde, but also those of Madame Walter, a woman of impeccable, virtuous reputation. Georges soon distances himself from her, as she proves to be madly, indiscreetly smitten. She gives him some news. Her husband and Laroche- Mathieu have fed him false information; the government is about to seize Morocco, contrary to what he has written in his column. The schemers will benefit financially from their manipulation of him. The Walters invite the Duroys to their home to a viewing of a celebrated and costly painting. Suzanne, now a sought-after heiress, is delighted to see him. Seeing Madeleine and Laroche-Mathieu conversing at the gathering gives Georges an idea. Laroche-Mathieu is attracted to Madeleine, so he asks her to lead the foreign minister on to gain information and ensure that he does not deceive Georges again, at least that is what he tells her. He then uses this as grounds for divorce, so he can marry Suzanne. Her father is outraged, and her mother aghast. Upon further consideration, however, and for his daughter's happiness, he gives his consent. This is too much for Clotilde to stand. According to French law, a person can appropriate a noble name if there are no known survivors. Georges does just that. Madame Walter, however, locates Philippe de Cantel, the last descendant, though too late. He challenges Georges to a duel, two weeks before his marriage. Before the duel, Georges professes to Clotilde that there are only two people he loves: her and her young daughter. Clotilde goes to the Walters to try to stop the duel, but the two men fatally shoot each other. Just before he dies, Georges regrets not being happy with Clotilde. Production The film was the swan song of the actor Warren William due to his health continuing to deteriorate. He was unable to work for most of 1947, the year the filming of The Private Affairs of Bel Ami finished. This was the first role of Susan Douglas Rube≈° who had to sign a seven-year contact or else she could not act in any more films. Signing actors and actresses for seven years was a common thing for studios to do at the time. Due to restrictions imposed by the Motion Picture Production Code, certain scenes needed to be censored. The 1945 painting The Temptation of St. Anthony by Max Ernst was shown on-screen, a brief splash of color in an otherwise black-and-white film, having been the winner of a contest between invited artists; Ivan Albright, Eugene Berman, Leonora Carrington, Salvador Dal√≠, Paul Delvaux, Dorothea Tanning, Leonor Fini, Louis Guglielmi, Horace Pippin, Abraham Rattner, Stanley Spencer and Ernst to create a work on the theme. Fini did not produce a painting, but the others were paid $500 for their submissions, with an additional $2,500 prize for the winner. Film critic Bosley Crowther described the painting as \\"downright nauseous\\" and looking \\"like a bad boiled lobster.\\" Cast * George Sanders as Georges Duroy * Angela Lansbury as Clotilde de Marelle * Ann Dvorak as Madeleine Forestier * John Carradine as Charles Forestier * Susan Douglas Rube≈° as Suzanne Walter (as Susan Douglas) * Hugo Haas as Monsieur Walter * Warren William as Laroche- Mathieu * Frances Dee as Marie de Varenne * Albert Bassermann as Jacques Rival * Marie Wilson as Rachel * Katherine Emery as Madame Walter * Richard Fraser as Philippe de Cantel * John Good as Paul de Cazolles * David Bond as Norbert de Varenne * Leonard Mudie as Potin * Judy Cook as Hortense * Karolyn Grimes as Laurine * Jean Del Val as Commissioner * Olaf Hytten as Keeper of the Seals * Lumsden Hare as Mayor of Canteleu * Betty Fairfax as Louise * C.

Moko, short for Mokotahi, a headland on Mahia Peninsula, was three-years-old as of July 2009. He resided at Mahia Beach for two and a half years from 2007 to September 2009, and became a major attraction there. He received worldwide fame when he rescued two pygmy sperm whales in March 2008. A year later, he trapped a woman out at sea. At the beginning of September 2009 Moko moved 80 km up the coast to Waikanae Beach, Gisborne, and in January 2010 he moved to WhakatƒÅne in the Bay of Plenty for five months before following a fishing boat to Tauranga on 3 June. Scientists were worried about Moko's welfare after a study found he had been scarred by boats and a fish hook. He was found dead on a beach at Matakana Island near Tauranga on 7 July 2010. History WhakatƒÅne River. =Rescue of pygmy sperm whales= In March 2008, Moko was seen helping two pygmy sperm whales that were trapped between a sandbar and Mahia beach. A local man who found the whales told his neighbour, Malcolm Smith, who was a Department of Conservation worker. Smith and other rescuers tried for an hour and a half to re-float the whales, with no success. Smith was wondering if it would be better to kill the two whales when Moko appeared.

During the winter (July) of 2009, a New Zealand swimmer, who left late to go swimming at Mahia on her own, started to play with Moko. Difficulties arose when the woman became tired, and the dolphin, who was still playing, did not allow her to return to the shore. As a result of this, the woman began to panic. People back at shore heard the now exhausted woman screaming for help, and rowed out to rescue her. They found her wrapped around a buoy, and took her back to the shore. Later the woman said that going out on her own at that late time had probably been unwise and that Moko had meant no harm. = Soul in the Sea (2013) = New Zealand filmmaker Amy Taylor directed and produced a documentary about Moko, titled Soul in the Sea, which premiered at the 2013 New Zealand International Film Festival.

Welfare Scientists became worried about Moko's safety after finding that he had been scarred by boats and had received a scar on his upper-right jaw from a fish hook. They noted that out of 30 \\"lone\\" dolphins that have been identified around the globe, 14 have been killed or injured as a result of their interactions with humans.

The character, however, is arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D agents for his irresponsible actions. The Raiders reappear, with upgraded suits, during the Armor Wars storyline in the title Iron Man. Tony Stark discovers his armor designs have been stolen and decides to retrieve or neutralize the technology, leading to a brief confrontation with the Raiders, in which their suits are rendered defunct.Iron Man #225 (Jan. 1988) The Raiders were later part of an army of armor-wearing mercenaries hired to attack Stark Enterprises.Avengers West Coast annual #7 (1992) The characters reappear in the second volume of The Invincible Iron Man and confront Iron Man once again.The Invincible Iron Man vol. 2, #3 (Sep. 2008) Powers and abilities Each of the Raider suits provide the wearer with greater durability and flight, and offer varying weapons systems. \\"Raider 1\\" is equipped with wristbands that can generate bullets; acid and lasers; \\"Raider 2\\" is equipped with a net capable of syphoning energy and a protective shield that absorbs energy attacks and \\"Raider 3\\" has two wrist weapons that project and amplify sonic waves in concentrated form.

It only includes those who were specifically accredited as such, as opposed to writers who later wrote of their experiences, including Gustav Regler, George Orwell, and so on. Foreign press coverage of the war was extensive, with around a thousand foreign newspaper correspondents working from Spain.Preston, Paul. We Saw Spain Die: Foreign Correspondents in the Spanish Civil War. Constable. 2008 Some journalists wrote for more than one newspaper and several papers had more than one journalist in Spain at the same time or at different times. In some cases, they were already seasoned war correspondents when they went to Spain. A few of them, such as Jay Allen, were already living in Spain when war broke out, and some of them, again like Allen, who wrote at various times for the Chicago Daily Tribune, News Chronicle, and The New York Times, wrote for more than one paper. While some correspondents supported the rebel cause, most notably William Carney, Edward Knoblaugh]and H. R. Knickerbocker, according to the Hispanist Paul Preston, \\"The bulk of the reporters became so committed to the Republic, partly because of the horrible things they saw such as the bombing of civilians, but even more so because they felt that what was going on in Spain was everybody's fight.\\" A case in point was that of Louis Delapr√©e, a Catholic correspondent sent to cover the rebel zone for Paris- Soir, who was killed as a result of his plane being shot down on his way back to Paris, furious at his newspaper not publishing his articles, as it clearly considered the \\"massacre of a hundred Spanish children is less interesting than a sigh from Mrs Simpson.\\"Preston, Paul.

He was named after the French noun canard, which means \\"duck\\" or \\"drake\\".  History  Sokal created the character Inspector Canardo after graduating from Institut Saint-Luc, at the age of 20. He first drew his comics for the magazine √Ä Suivre but after the comic became popular, they were published as albums by Casterman.  Characters = Canardo = The eponymous character and the protagonist of the series, Canardo is an anthropomorphic strange duck who has a career as a private investigator. While he is seldom seen on paid assignments, he tends to end up in dangerous situations everywhere. He is also often used as a pawn in bigger schemes because of his expendability. He suffers from severe personal problems, including vast consumption of beer to forget the unfortunate events he has gone through. While Canardo is quite skilled both in armed and unarmed combat, he is more of an everyman than a traditional hero. Canardo has died, at least seemingly, several times. Most of these happen in the comics written for √Ä Suivre. In the first incident, Canardo is about to be lynched by an angry crowd when he falls in a pit filled with urine, where he supposedly drowns. In the next comic, he is alive and well. Later, he is shot to death after being tricked by Clara. Canardo jokingly refers to this incident in the next comic, claiming that the \\"blood\\" was actually tomato sauce. In the last short comic, Canardo commits suicide, although this presumably happens chronologically after all other adventures. In the album La Fille qui r√™vait d'horizon (1999), Canardo's Cadillac collides with Rasputin's motorbike, causing an explosion that is implied to have killed both Canardo and Rasputin. = Clara = One of the first recurring characters in the series, Clara is a femme fatale whose lust for power has led her to do extreme things. In her first appearance, she uses Canardo to kill a mobster cat named Fritz, resulting in Canardo being shot. Despite the hostility between the two, they apparently have romantic feelings for each other, although this is less evident in Clara's later appearances. Like Canardo, Clara has survived several evident deaths. = Rasputin = Rasputin is a huge, violent evil mystic who lives in Siberia. He and his band of raiders have terrorized Siberian villages for years. Rasputin is obsessed with immortality, and has his assistant prepare numerous medicines to slow down his natural aging. When he learns that one of his supposedly dead daughters is alive, he decides to abandon his potions and instead find the daughter and make her his successor. After the plan fails, he blames Canardo, sparking hostility between the two.  Albums = 0. Premi√®res enqu√™tes (1979) = English title: First Investigations This album is a compilation of the shorter comics originally published in a comic book magazine, √Ä Suivre. The loose story arc includes Canardo attempting to solve various crimes, him being used as a tool of political scheming, as well as the complex relationship between Canardo and Clara. The story arc ends tragically when Canardo, now married and settled down, kills himself outside the pub by shooting himself in the head. These comics featured humans, who are considerably larger than the animal characters, and don't seem to notice the anthropomorphic traits of the animals. Humans were seen rarely in the other albums. = 1. Le Chien debout (1981) = English title: A Dog's Life Canardo isn't the main protagonist of this album, but rather a background influencer, or √âminence grise. The story features a dog working to stop a mad doctor who performs animal experiments, while investigating the murder of his girlfriend, for which everyone blames him. This is one of two albums that were officially published in English, under two different titles: Shaggy Dog Story and A Shabby Dog Story. = 2. La Marque de Raspoutine (1982) = English title: The Mark of Rasputin Rasputin, an evil mystic whose raiders have plagued Siberian villages for years, sends a messenger to Europe to find his daughter. After the messenger gets injured by Rasputin's enemies, Canardo, inspired by the beauty of Rasputin's daughter, agrees to help escort her to Rasputin. Matters are complicated by Clara, who is Rasputin's mistress, who isn't willing to share Rasputin's love with his daughter, and is willing to do anything to stop the reunion. Rasputin, one of Canardo's enemies, appears for the first time in this album. = 3. La Mort douce (1983) = English title: A Silent Death Canardo, depressed after the trip to Siberia, witnesses a brutal homicide as Bronx, a bear, kills a customer of the pub despite normally being harmless, being too stupid to be angered. The violent outburst is caused by Lili Marleen, a song sung by a pub singer. Canardo sets off to find Bronx and discover the connection between the song and Bronx's behavior. This is one of two albums that were officially published in English, as Blue Angel. = 4. Noces de brume (1985) = English title: The Return of Rasputin Rasputin is found alive, although weak and blind. When he is being transported in a wagon by a father and a daughter in East Europe, Rasputin escapes, causing the local population to equip themselves with firearms and begin hunting for this beast.

Operational history P-2V-7S c.1962 VP-24 P-3C with AGM-12 Bullpup missiles in the 1970s P-3C drops a Snakeye retarded bomb =World War II= *10 April 1943: VB-104 was established at Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. The squadron was formed with a cadre of personnel from VP-71 and equipped with the PB4Y-1 Liberator. The squadron came under the operational control of Fleet Air Wing TWO (FAW-2). Daily patrols were commenced immediately after formation, covering the approaches to Midway, Johnston Island and Canton Island. It was mid-July before the squadron attained its full complement of aircraft and personnel. *15 August 1943: Training at Kaneohe was completed and orders were received to proceed to Carney Field, Guadalcanal, under the operational control of Fleet Air Wing ONE (FAW-1), replacing VB-101. When the squadron arrived the aircrews commenced daily search missions, formation missions against enemy land targets, and photoreconnaissance and Dumbo (air-sea rescue) missions. *26 August 1943: Commander Harry E. Sears, squadron commanding officer, led an eight-aircraft strike on a Japanese destroyer task force attempting to evacuate personnel from Rekata Bay, Santa Isabel Island. The attack, made at sunset 90 miles off Buka Passage, disrupted the evacuation and left one of the destroyers heavily damaged. *2 September 1943: A squadron attack against enemy facilities at Kahili Airfield was led by Commander Sears on this date, joined by elements from several Army bomber squadrons. The airfield and parked enemy aircraft were heavily damaged with the squadron suffering only minor damage from heavy antiaircraft fire. *27 January 1944: Commander Harry E. Sears was awarded the Navy Cross for heroic actions while leading his squadron in combat during the period 26 August to 4 November 1943. In addition to leading several squadron attacks, he and his crew were credited, during separate actions, with the destruction of one enemy twin-engine bomber, damage to two enemy fighters, sinking one Japanese combination oiler and ammunition ship, damaging another oiler and damaging one enemy submarine. *6 Feb 1944: VB-104 was relocated from Guadalcanal to Munda Field, New Georgia. Operational tasking was essentially the same as that assigned while at Carney Field. The squadron was relieved by VB-115 on 29 March 1944, for return to the U.S. for rest and rehabilitation. The squadron record at this time was 30 enemy aircraft destroyed or damaged, 51 ships sunk or damaged, with 1,252 sorties in a seven-month tour. *15 May 1944: The squadron was reformed at NAAS Kearney Field, California, under the operational control of FAW-14. A small cadre was present on this date, while the majority of personnel were at Naval Air Station Hutchinson, Kansas, undergoing operational flight training on the PB4Y-1. The latter completed this phase of training and reported to NAAS Kearney Field on 21 June 1944. *28 July 1944: VB-104 began the trans-Pacific flight to NAS Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. Upon arrival the squadron came under the operational control of FAW-2, and continued its combat patrol training over the waters encircling the Hawaiian Island chain. Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) training was introduced into the curriculum during this phase. *30 October 1944: VPB-104 departed Kaneohe for Morotai. The last squadron aircraft arrived on 3 November 1944, with operational control over the squadron exercised by Fleet Air Wing SEVENTEEN (FAW-17). Upon commencement of operations the squadron was assigned search and offensive reconnaissance patrols, strike missions on enemy shipping, night patrols and special tracking missions. *11 November 1944: Lieutenant Maurice Hill and his crew were attacked by enemy fighters while on patrol between Leyte and Cebu. Hill's crew was flying a PB4Y-1 equipped with a radar set in place of the customary belly turret. This lack of defensive armament was quickly noted by the Japanese fighter pilots, and the bomber was shot down near Pacijan Island. Filipino natives rescued the four survivors of the crash and tended their wounds until they could be rescued by a PT boat one week later. The villagers were later executed by the Japanese for giving assistance to the Americans. *1 December 1944: VPB-104 was relocated to the Army Air Forces' Tacloban Airfield, in the southern Philippines. *12 December 1944: Aviation Machinist Mate Third Class William E. Abbot was serving as first mechanic on a VPB-104 Liberator on patrol over northwest Borneo when the aircraft came under intense ground fire that penetrated the main bomb bay tank. AMM3C Abbot was able to transfer fuel from the leaking tank to the empty wing tanks, saving enough for the return flight to base. During the process, AMM3C Abbot was overcome by the high-octane fumes and fell to his death through the open bomb bay. He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross. *26 December 1944: Lieutenant Paul F. Stevens earned a Navy Cross for his actions on the night of 26 December. While on patrol, Lieutenant Stevens spotted a Japanese task force en route to attack recently established U.S. bases on Mindoro, Philippines. His contact report gave the garrisons time to prepare for the attack and incoming shipping was diverted. After sending the report he attacked the largest ship in the group, believed to be a large cruiser or battleship, scoring two direct hits on the vessel. He remained in the vicinity tracking the progress of the task force, despite the heavy antiaircraft fire from the escorts. *2 March 1945: The squadron was relocated to Clark Field, Luzon, Philippines. When the squadron arrived the crews began operational night missions, daily search and reconnaissance patrols, and strikes on targets of opportunity‚Äîcovering the China Coast to within 30 miles of Shanghai, the coastline of Amami ≈åshima, Okinawa and Kitadait≈çjima. *14 March 1945: Lieutenant Paul Stevens, squadron executive officer, intercepted and damaged Vice Admiral Yamagata's Kawanishi H8K2 flying boat) off the China Coast. The aircraft flew on for several miles and made a forced landing in an inlet on the coast where it immediately came under fire from Chinese partisans ashore. The admiral and his staff committed suicide and the crew set fire to the aircraft. Admiral Yamagata was en route to Tokyo for an interview with Emperor Hirohito prior to assuming the position of Undersecretary of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Intercepts of enemy radio messages had revealed the admiral's intended route, and Lieutenant Stevens was dispatched to intercept him. *18 October 1945: Operational patrols ceased in order to prepare the squadron for transfer back to the west coast of the continental U.S. The squadron's record for its second tour was 49 enemy aircraft destroyed, 254 vessels sunk and 12,500 flight hours completed. The squadron departed by sections on 26 October 1945, for NAS San Diego, California, then on to NAS Floyd Bennett Field, New York. VPB-104 was the only patrol squadron in World War II to receive two Presidential Unit Citations. =1940s - 1960s= *26 December 1945: The last squadron aircraft arrived at NAS Floyd Bennett Field, with the squadron coming under the operational control of Fleet Air Wing FIVE (FAW-5) effective 26 November 1945. *8 April 1946: VPB-104 was relocated to Naval Auxiliary Air Station Edenton, North Carolina, for training in ASW. *22 May 1946: The training syllabus was completed at Naval Auxillery Air Station Edenton and the squadron was transferred to Naval Air Station Atlantic City, New Jersey. Three crews were given SWOD training at Naval Auxiliary Air Station Chincoteague, Virginia, in September 1946 and April 1947. The ASM-N-2A Bat air-to-surface guided missile gave the squadron its nickname, the Batmen. The Bat was developed during World War II as a derivative from an earlier glide-bomb project, the Pelican. The Bat skipped several normal stages of development and went directly into combat. During the war it was carried by three squadrons, VPBs 109, 123 and 124. Only VPB-109 had any success with the missile, sinking three ships and destroying a large oil tank. The project languished briefly after the war until two squadrons were selected to be designated Bat squadrons: VP-24 in the Atlantic Fleet, and VP-25 in the Pacific. *November 1947: VP-HL-4 received additional SWOD training during advanced base operations at Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland. *29 December 1949: The squadron's mission was revised to make aerial mining its primary role and reduced Bat operations to a secondary role along with ASW, reconnaissance and anti-shipping. *22 October 1951: VP-24 deployed to RAF Luqa, Malta, as the first U.S. Navy squadron to ever operate from the base. *1 May 1954: VP-24 flew its last mission at NAS Argentia in the P4Y-2. It was the last squadron in Fleet Air Wing THREE (FAW-3} to fly the Privateer before receiving the P-2V Neptune and the last Atlantic Fleet Bat missile squadron. VP-24 ended its five-month deployment with more than 2,500 flight hours. Several of the squadron's remaining Bat missiles were expended in practice runs on icebergs. *31 March 1956: Two patrol squadrons were designated Petrel guided missile squadrons, operating P2V-6M aircraft. The Petrel was an air-to- surface guided missile designed for use by patrol aircraft against shipping. VP-24 was selected as the East Coast squadron, and VP-17 as the West Coast unit. VP-24 was the first to be fully equipped; VP-17 became operational in early 1957. *November 1959: VP-24 received its first four P2V-7S aircraft. Final delivery of the last of 12 aircraft took place in March 1960. *5 November 1962: VP-24 was deployed to Leeward Point Field, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The squadron flew continuous surveillance missions, reporting all Communist Bloc shipping transiting Cuban waters until relieved on 17 December 1962. VP-24 returned on 17 February 1963, conducting surveillance until relieved on 21 March 1963. During the second tour, the squadron photographed the removal from Cuba of intermediate range missiles and IL-28 Beagle bombers. *29 June 1965: VP-24 deployed to Naval Air Station Sigonella, Sicily, relieving VP-5. A detachment was maintained at NAF Souda Bay, Crete. While deployed to Souda Bay, the detachment was supported by . *5 July 1967: VP-24 was relocated from it home base at NAS Norfolk to Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland. The squadron assumed duties at the new station with its new aircraft, the P-3B Orion. Transition training from the SP-2H Neptune to the P-3B began in April 1967 and was completed on 7 December 1967. *6 March 1968: VP-24 deployed to Naval Air Station Keflavik, Iceland, with a three-aircraft detachment at Lajes Field, Azores. The detachment was called to assist in the search for the missing submarine from 28 May to 25 June 1968. *10 November 1969: After its return from deployment VP-24 commenced transition to the P-3C, becoming the third operational P-3C squadron. Transition training was completed on 9 March 1970. =1970s through the 1990s= *30 October 1972: The squadron changed home stations to Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida, where it fell under the operational control of Commander, Patrol Wing ELEVEN (COMPATWING 11). *1974: The squadron maintained 2-crew/2-aircraft ‚Äúmini‚Äù detachments at Naval Air Station Bermuda from 1 to 12 April, 15 to 24 May, 3 to 14 June, 26 to 31 August and 1 to 5 September 1974; and to NAF Lajes, Azores, 10 to 15 October 1974. This type of deployment was being tested as an alternative to the full squadron and split deployments. *12 September 1977: During the squadron's deployment to NAS Keflavik, Iceland, the squadron successfully tracked and located the hot-air balloon Double Eagle that had gone down at sea several hundred miles west of Iceland while attempting a crossing of the Atlantic. The squadron's efforts led to the rescue of the balloon's crew. *May 1980: VP-24 was tasked with the first of many Cuban refugee surveillance flights, which continued periodically through late September 1980. *30 April 1995: VP-24 was disestablished at NAS Jacksonville as part of post-Cold War force reductions that reduced the number of active duty U.S. Navy patrol squadrons by 50%. The squadron's P-3C Update II.5 aircraft were redistributed to other patrol squadrons. Home port assignments The squadron was assigned to these home ports, effective on the dates shown: *Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii 10 April 1943 *Naval Auxiliary Air Station Camp Kearney, California 15 May 1944 *Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii 28 July 1944 *Naval Air Station Floyd Bennett Field, New York 26 December 1946 *Naval Air Station Atlantic City, New Jersey 22 May 1946 *Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland 21 April 1948 *Naval Auxiliary Air Station Chincoteague, Maryland 1954 *Naval Air Station Norfolk, Virginia 15 February 1959 *Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland 5 July 1967 *Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida 30 October 1972 Aircraft Assignment The squadron first received the following aircraft on the dates shown: *PB4Y-1 Liberator - April 1943 *PB4Y-2/P4Y-2 Privateer ‚Äì February 1946 *P4Y-2B Privateer - November 1947 *P2V-5 Neptune ‚Äì June 1954 *P2V-6M Neptune - March 1956 *P2V-5F Neptune - March 1957 *P2V-7S/SP-2H* Neptune - November 1959 *P-3B Orion ‚Äì April 1967 *P-3C Orion ‚Äì November 1969 *P-3C UIIIR Orion ‚Äì 1991 *P-3C UII.5 Orion ‚Äì 1993  * Former USN/USMC aircraft designation system was changed to a joint DoD designation system in 1962, resulting in the P2V-7S being redesignated as the SP-2H.

During the First Gulf War guided munitions accounted for only 9% of weapons fired, but accounted for 75% of all successful hits. Despite guided weapons generally being used on more difficult targets, they were still 35 times more likely to destroy their targets per weapon dropped.https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/2002/12/15/bursts- of-brilliance/0c06b132-2d70-41e6-882e-5c4ece8f5fcf/ Because the damage effects of explosive weapons decrease with distance due to an inverse cube law, even modest improvements in accuracy (hence reduction in miss distance) enable a target to be attacked with fewer or smaller bombs. Thus, even if some guided bombs miss, fewer air crews are put at risk and the harm to civilians and the amount of collateral damage may be reduced. The advent of precision-guided munitions resulted in the renaming of older bombs \\"unguided bombs\\", \\"dumb bombs\\", or \\"iron bombs\\". Types A laser-guided GBU-24 (BLU-109 warhead variant) strikes its target Recognizing the difficulty of hitting moving ships during the Spanish Civil War,Fitzsimons, Bernard, editor. The Illustrated Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons and Warfare (London: Phoebus, 1978), Volume 10, p.1037, \\"Fritz-X\\". the Germans were first to develop steerable munitions, using radio control or wire guidance. The U.S. tested TV-guided (GB-4),Fitzsimons, op. cit., Volume 10, p.1101, \\"GB-4\\". semi-active radar- guided (Bat), and infrared-guided (Felix) weapons. =Inertial-guided weapons= The CBU-107 Passive Attack Weapon is an air-dropped guided bomb containing metal penetrator rods of various sizes. It was designed to attack targets where an explosive effect may be undesirable, such as fuel storage tanks or chemical weapon stockpilesAir Force Developed Bombs Capable of Destroying Syria‚Äôs Chemical Weapons - Defensetech.org, 30 August 2013 in civilian areas. =Radio-controlled weapons= The Germans were first to introduce PGMs in combat, with KG 100 deploying the MCLOS-guidance Fritz X armored glide bomb, guided by the Kehl-Stra√üburg radio guidance system, to successfully attack the Italian battleship Roma in 1943, and the similarly Kehl-Stra√üburg MCLOS-guided Henschel Hs 293 rocket-boosted glide bomb (also in use since 1943, but only against lightly armored or unarmored ship targets). The closest Allied equivalents, both unpowered designs, were the VB-1 AZON (from \\"AZimuth ONly\\" control), used in both Europe and the CBI theater, and the US Navy's Bat, primarily used in the Pacific Theater of World War II ‚Äî the Navy's Bat was more advanced than either German PGM ordnance design or the USAAF's VB-1 AZON, in that it had its own on board, autonomous radar seeker system to direct it to a target. In addition, the U.S. tested the rocket- propelled Gargoyle, which never entered service.Fitzsimons, op. cit., Volume 10, p. 1090, \\"Gargoyle\\". Japanese PGMs‚Äîwith the exception of the anti-ship air-launched, rocket-powered, human-piloted Yokosuka MXY-7 Ohka, \\"Kamikaze\\" flying bomb did not see combat in World War II. Prior to the war, the British experimented with radio-controlled remotely guided planes laden with explosive, such as Larynx. The United States Army Air Forces used similar techniques with Operation Aphrodite, but had few successes; the German Mistel (Mistletoe) \\"parasite aircraft\\" was no more effective, guided by the human pilot flying the single-engined fighter mounted above the unmanned, explosive- laden twin engined \\"flying bomb\\" below it, released in the Mistel's attack dive from the fighter. The U.S. programs restarted in the Korean War. In the 1960s, the electro-optical bomb (or camera bomb) was reintroduced. They were equipped with television cameras and flare sights, by which the bomb would be steered until the flare superimposed the target. The camera bombs transmitted a \\"bomb's eye view\\" of the target back to a controlling aircraft. An operator in this aircraft then transmitted control signals to steerable fins fitted to the bomb. Such weapons were used increasingly by the USAF in the last few years of the Vietnam War because the political climate was increasingly intolerant of civilian casualties, and because it was possible to strike difficult targets (such as bridges) effectively with a single mission; the Thanh Hoa Bridge, for instance, was attacked repeatedly with iron bombs, to no effect, only to be dropped in one mission with PGMs. Although not as popular as the newer JDAM and JSOW weapons, or even the older laser-guided bomb systems, weapons like the AGM-62 Walleye TV guided bomb are still being used, in conjunction with the AAW-144 Data Link Pod, on US Navy F/A-18 Hornets. =Infrared-guided/electro-optical weapons= In World War II, the U.S. National Defense Research Committee developed the VB-6 Felix, which used infrared to home on ships. While it entered production in 1945, it was never employed operationally.Fitzsimons, op. cit., Volume 9, p. 926, \\"Felix\\". The first successful electro optical guided munition was the AGM-62 Walleye during the Vietnam war. It was a family of large glide bombs which could automatically track targets using contrast differences in the video feed. The original concept was created by engineer Norman Kay while tinkering with televisions as a hobby. It was based on a device which could track objects on a television screen and place a \\"blip\\" on them to indicate where it was aiming. The first test of the weapon on On 29 January 1963 was a success, with the weapon making a direct hit on the target. It served successfully for three decades until the 1990s.John Darrell Sherwood, Nixon's Trident: Naval Power in Southeast Asia, 1968‚Äì1972, (Washington: DC: Naval Historical Center, forthcoming). The Raytheon Maverick is the most common electro optical guided missile. As a heavy anti-tank missile it has among its various marks guidance systems such as electro-optical (AGM-65A), imaging infra-red (AGM-65D), and laser homing (AGM-65E).Raytheon AGM-65 Maverick The first two, by guiding themselves based on the visual or IR scene of the target, are fire-and-forget in that the pilot can release the weapon and it will guide itself to the target without further input, which allows the delivery aircraft to manoeuvre to escape return fire. The Pakistani NESCOM H-2 MUPSOW and H-4 MUPSOW is an electro-optical (IR imaging and television guided) is a drop and forget precision-guided glide bomb. The Israeli Elbit Opher is also an IR imaging \\"drop and forget\\" guided bomb that has been reported to be considerably cheaper than laser-homing bombs and can be used by any aircraft, not requiring specialized wiring for a laser designator or for another aircraft to illuminate the target. During NATO's air campaign in 1999 in Kosovo the new Italian AF AMX employed the Opher.\\"Opher bomb deployed in Kosovo\\" FLIGHT Daily News, 17 June 1999 =Laser-guided weapons= BOLT-117, the world's first laser-guided bomb In 1962, the US Army began research into laser guidance systems and by 1967 the USAF had conducted a competitive evaluation leading to full development of the world's first laser-guided bomb, the BOLT-117, in 1968. All such bombs work in much the same way, relying on the target being illuminated, or \\"painted,\\" by a laser target designator on the ground or on an aircraft. They have the significant disadvantage of not being usable in poor weather where the target illumination cannot be seen, or where a target designator cannot get near the target. The laser designator sends its beam in a coded series of pulses so the bomb cannot be confused by an ordinary laser, and also so multiple designators can operate in reasonable proximity. Originally the project began as a surface to air missile seeker developed by Texas Instruments. When TI executive Glenn E. Penisten attempted to sell the new technology to the AirForce they inquired if it could instead be used as a ground attack system to overcome problems they were having with accuracy of bombing in Vietnam. After 6 attempts the weapon improved accuracy from and greatly exceeded the design requirements. The system was sent to Vietnam and performed well. Without the existence of tracking pods they had to be aimed using a hand held laser from the back seat of an F-4 Phantom, but still performed well. Eventually over 28,000 were dropped during the war.https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/2002/12/15/bursts- of-brilliance/0c06b132-2d70-41e6-882e-5c4ece8f5fcf/ Laser-guided weapons did not become commonplace until the advent of the microchip. They made their practical debut in Vietnam, where on 13 May 1972 they were used in the second successful attack on the Thanh H√≥a Bridge (\\"Dragon's Jaw\\"). This structure had previously been the target of 800 American sortiesThanh Hoa Bridge (using unguided weapons) and was partially destroyed in each of two successful attacks, the other being on 27 April 1972 using Walleyes. They were used, though not on a large scale, by the British forces during the 1982 Falklands War.Britain's Small Wars The first large-scale use of smart weapons came in the early 1990s during Operation Desert Storm when they were used by coalition forces against Iraq. Even so, most of the air-dropped ordnance used in that war was \\"dumb,\\" although the percentages are biased by the large use of various (unguided) cluster bombs. Laser-guided weapons were used in large numbers during the 1999 Kosovo War, but their effectiveness was often reduced by the poor weather conditions prevalent in the southern Balkans. There are two basic families of laser-guided bombs in American (and American-sphere) service: the Paveway II and the Paveway III. The Paveway III guidance system is more aerodynamically efficient and so has a longer range, however it is more expensive. Paveway II LGBs (such as GBU-12) are a cheaper lightweight PGM suitable for use against vehicles and other small targets, while a Paveway III penetrator (such as GBU-24) is a more expensive weapon suitable for use against high-value targets. GBU-12s were used to great effect in the first Gulf War, dropped from F-111F aircraft to destroy Iraqi armored vehicles in a process informally referred to by pilots as \\"tank plinking.\\" AGM-123 Skipper II is a short-range laser-guided missile developed by the United States Navy. The Skipper was intended as an anti-ship weapon, capable of disabling the largest vessels with a impact-fuzed warhead. It is composed of a Mark 83 bomb fitted with a Paveway guidance kit and two Mk 78 solid propellant rockets that fire upon launch. Diagram showing the operation of a laser-guided ammunition round.

It requires a laser target designator, from either an airborne or land based source, to \\"paint\\" a target. Circular error probable (CEP) is about , while maximum ranges of rockets varies from the rockets used . Ugroza allows rockets to be ripple-fired up to 7 at a time. The notable novelty is that the system does not use aerodynamic flight control (e.g. tail fins), but impulse steering with mini-thrusters. It has been dubbed as the Russian concept of impulse corrections (RCIC). The Roketsan Cirit is a Turkish laser guided missile. Cirit is a guided missile system fitted with a semi-active laser homing seeker. The seeker and guidance section is attached to a purpose-built warhead with a Class 5 Insensitive Munition (IM). The multipurpose warhead has a combined armour-piercing ammunition with enhanced behind armor anti- personnel and incendiary effects. The engine is of reduced smoke design, with IM properties. It is connected to the rear section by a roll bearing that enables it to rotate in flight. There are four small stabilising surfaces at the very rear of the missile in front of the exhaust nozzle that ensures stable flight. Roketsan has developed a new launch pod and a new canister in which Cirit is delivered as an all-up round. The Cirit has a maximum effective guided range of with a high probability of hit on a target at this range.CIRIT 2.75‚Äù Laser Guided Missile, Roketsan Roketsan targets guided anti-tank missile development and production, TR Defence, 13 July 2011 =Radar-guided weapons= The Lockheed-Martin Hellfire II light-weight anti-tank weapon in one mark uses the radar on the Boeing AH-64D Apache Longbow to provide fire- and-forget guidance for that weapon. =Satellite-guided weapons= A F-22 releases a JDAM from its center internal bay while flying at supersonic speed HOPE/HOSBO of the Luftwaffe with a combination of GPS/INS and electro-optical guidance Lessons learned during the first Gulf War showed the value of precision munitions, yet they also highlighted the difficulties in employing them‚Äîspecifically when visibility of the ground or target from the air was degraded.JDAM continues to be warfighter's weapon of choice The problem of poor visibility does not affect satellite-guided weapons such as Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and Joint Stand-Off Weapon (JSOW), which make use of the United States' GPS system for guidance. This weapon can be employed in all weather conditions, without any need for ground support. Because it is possible to jam GPS, the guidance package reverts to inertial navigation in the event of GPS signal loss. Inertial navigation is significantly less accurate; the JDAM achieves a published Circular Error Probable (CEP) of under GPS guidance, but typically only under inertial guidance (with free fall times of 100 seconds or less).U.S. Air Force Factsheets: Joint Direct Attack Munition The Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) is a guidance kit that converts unguided bombs, or \\"dumb bombs\\", into all-weather \\"smart\\" munitions. JDAM-equipped bombs are guided by an integrated inertial guidance system coupled to a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, giving them a published range of up to . JDAM-equipped bombs range from . When installed on a bomb, the JDAM kit is given a GBU (Guided Bomb Unit) nomenclature, superseding the Mark 80 or BLU (Bomb, Live Unit) nomenclature of the bomb to which it is attached.

It is an add-on kit which is used to retrofit existing Mark 82, Mark 83, and Mark 84 and other \\"dumb fire\\" gravity bombs, making them into laser- guided smart bombs (with the option of GPS guidance). Initial development completed in 1990. The Griffin conversion kit consists of a front \\"seeker\\" section and a set of steerable tailplanes. The resulting guided munition features \\"trajectory shaping\\", which allows the bomb to fall along a variety of trajectories ‚Äì from a shallow angle to a vertical top attack profile.

The kit provides extended range up to and are guided by an integrated inertial guidance system coupled to three satellites networks, relying on wireless to handle the flow of data between the aircraft and the munition. FT PGB is a family of Chinese satellite and Inertial, guided munitions. LS PGB is a family of Chinese GPS+INS or laser guided munitions. The precision of these weapons is dependent both on the precision of the measurement system used for location determination and the precision in setting the coordinates of the target. The latter critically depends on intelligence information, not all of which is accurate. According to a CIA report, the accidental United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade during Operation Allied Force by NATO aircraft was attributed to faulty target information.DCI Statement on the Belgrade Chinese Embassy However, if the targeting information is accurate, satellite- guided weapons are significantly more likely to achieve a successful strike in any given weather conditions than any other type of precision-guided munition. =Advanced guidance concepts= Responding to after-action reports from pilots who employed laser or satellite guided weapons, Boeing developed a Laser JDAM (LJDAM) to provide both types of guidance in a single kit. Based on the existing Joint Direct Attack Munition configurations, a laser guidance package is added to a GPS/INS-guided weapon to increase its overall accuracy. Raytheon has developed the Enhanced Paveway family, which adds GPS/INS guidance to their Paveway family of laser-guidance packages.Raytheon Enhanced Paveway These \\"hybrid\\" laser and GPS guided weapons permit the carriage of fewer weapons types, while retaining mission flexibility, because these weapons can be employed equally against moving and fixed targets, or targets of opportunity. For instance, a typical weapons load on an F-16 flying in the Iraq War included a single JDAM and two LGBs. With LJDAM, and the new GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), these same aircraft can carry more bombs if necessary, and have the option of satellite or laser guidance for each weapon release. Spice (munition) is an Israeli EO/GPS-guided guidance kit for converting air-droppable unguided bombs into precision guided bombs. Spice can be preprogrammed, with up to 100 different targets it may have to engage during a mission. The one target it will actually engage may then be selected, inflight, by an aircrewman.

Moving Target Artillery Round (MTAR) The U.S. Navy leads development for a new artillery round called Moving Target Artillery Round, capable of destroying moving targets in GPS-denied environments\\". The Office of Naval Research (ONR), the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division (NSWC Dahlgren), and the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) have been coordinating MTAR, with final development scheduled for 2019. Key features of the MTAR shell include extended range against moving targets, precision guidance and navigation without GPS, subsystem modularity, subsystem maturity, weapon system compatibility, restricted altitude, all-weather capability, reduced time of flight, and affordability. The new munition is intended for the Army or Marine Corps M777A1 howitzer, the M109A6 Paladin, and M109A7 Paladin Integrated Management (PIM) self-propelled artillery systems. The shell also would be for the Navy's Advanced Gun System (AGS) aboard the Zumwalt-class destroyer, and other future naval gun systems. Precision Guidance Kit ‚Äì Modernization (PGK-M) The U.S. Army is planning for GPS-denied environments with the new Precision Guidance Kit ‚Äì Modernization (PGK-M). An enhancement of previous technologies, PGK-M will give U.S. forces the ability to continue launching precision strikes when GPS is compromised by the enemy. Picatinny Arsenal engineers are leading the development of a GPS alternative using image navigation for precision guidance of munitions, under the Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC). Other research partners include Draper Labs, U.S. Army Research Laboratory, Air Force Research Laboratory and the Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center. The enhanced munition can navigate to a desired location, through a reference image used by the technology to reach the target. The PGK-M includes a collection of ad hoc software programmable radio networks, various kinds of wave-relay connectivity technologies and navigational technology. PBK-500U Drel is a Russian guided jamming-resistant stealth glide bomb. =Cannon and mortar-launched guided projectiles= A cannon-launched guided projectile (CLGP), is fired from artillery, ship's cannon, or armored vehicles. Several agencies and organizations sponsored the CLGP programs. The United States Navy sponsored the Deadeye program, a laser-guided shell for its guns and a program to mate a Paveway guidance system to an shell for the 8\\"/55 caliber Mark 71 gun in the 1970s (Photo). Other Navy efforts include the BTERM, ERGM, and LRLAP shells. The U.S. Army's MGM-51 Shillelagh missile can be considered a type of CLGP. Intended for use on the M551 Sheridan light tank, the Shillelagh missile was fired out of the Sheridan's cannon to provide robust anti-tank capability. The Army's M712 Copperhead laser guided artillery round was used in Desert Storm. Army CLGPs include the M982 Excalibur artillery shell, the XM395 Precision Guided Mortar Munition, and the XM1156 Precision Guidance Kit to refit existing 155 mm shells with precision guidance, as the Air Force's JDAM program converts dumb bombs into precision munitions. M982 Excalibur, GPS- guided munitions (XM982) for 155 mm artillery was developed in a collaborative effort between U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) and the Armaments Research and Development Center (ARDEC). Research included developing GPS and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) Inertial Sensor Technology. Excalibur was fielded in Operation Iraqi Freedom in the summer of 2007. Technology developed on the Excalibur is also applied in the Army's Precision Guidance Kit (PGK) for use on existing conventional projectiles and the Mortar Guidance Kit (MGK) for use on conventional mortars. XM1111 Mid-Range Munition is cancelled tank gun launched missile. LAHAT is Israeli semi-active laser homing guided low-weight anti-tank guided missile that can be launched from smoothbore tank guns. KSTAM is South Korean guided munition shot from the gun of K2 Black Panther tank. 30F39 Krasnopol is a Russian cannon-launched, fin- stabilized, base bleed-assisted, semi-automatic laser-guided, explosive projectile.

Another system in development uses a laser range finder to trigger an explosive small arms shell in proximity to a target. The U.S. Army plans to use such devices in the future. In 2008 the EXACTO program began under DARPA to develop a \\"fire and forget\\" smart sniper rifle system including a guided smart bullet and improved scope. The exact technologies of this smart bullet have not been released. EXACTO was test fired in 2014 and 2015 and results showing the bullet alter course to correct its path to its target were released.https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2015-04-27 In 2012 Sandia National Laboratories announced a self-guided bullet prototype that could track a target illuminated with a laser designator. The bullet is capable of updating its position 30 times a second and hitting targets over a mile away.Sandia‚Äôs self-guided bullet prototype can hit target a mile away In mid-2016, Russia revealed it was developing a similar \\"smart bullet\\" weapon designed to hit targets at a distance of up to .Russians Launch Smart Bullet Effort in the Wake of U.S. Program - Kitup.Military.com, 20 July 2016Russia launches ‚Äòsmart bullet‚Äô testing in guided flight regime Pikehttps://www.defensetech.org/2015/10/12/raytheon-displays-new-mini-rocket- for-special-forces-infantry/ is a precision-guided mini-missile fired from an underslung grenade launcher.

Since 2016 it has been majority owned by the Taiwan-based Foxconn Group. Sharp employs more than 50,000 people worldwide. The company was founded in September 1912 in Tokyo and takes its name from one of its founder's first inventions, the Ever-Sharp mechanical pencil, which was invented by Tokuji Hayakawa in 1915. History=Early years 1912-1945= Abeno-ku, Osaka In 1912, Tokuji Hayakawa founded a metal workshop in Tokyo. The first of his many inventions was a snap buckle named 'Tokubijo'. Another of his inventions was the Ever-Sharp mechanical pencil in 1915, from which the Sharp Corporation derived its name. After the pencil business was destroyed by the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake, the company relocated to Osaka and began designing the first generation of Japanese radio sets. These went on sale in 1925. The company was established as \\"Hayakawa Metal Works\\" in 1924, in Tanabe-cho, Osaka. In 1942, the name was changed to \\"Hayakawa Electric Industry Company\\". =1945-1999= Sharp portable TV Sharp MD-MS701H In 1953, Hayakawa Electric started producing the first Japan-made TV sets (the \\"Sharp TV3-14T\\"). In 1964, the company developed the world's first transistor calculator (the Sharp CS-10A), which was priced at JP¬•535,000 (US$1,400). It took Sharp several years to develop the product as they had no experience in making computing devices at the time. Two years later, in 1966, Sharp introduced its first IC calculator using 145 Mitsubishi Electric-made bipolar ICs, priced at JP¬•350,000 (about US$1000). Its first LSI calculator was introduced in 1969. This was the first pocketable calculator priced at less than JP¬•100,000 (less than US$300), and turned out to be a popular item. Also in the same era the company introduced the first microwave oven with a turntable between 1964 and 1966. The company was renamed Sharp Corporation in 1970. Sharp produced the first LCD calculator in 1973. Sharp had a working relationship with Nintendo during the 1980s, and was granted licensing rights for the manufacture and development of the C1 NES TV (1983, later released in North America as the Sharp Nintendo Television), the Twin Famicom (1986), the Sharp Famicom Titler (1989), and the SF-1 SNES TV (1990). All of these units are considered collectors items on the secondary market. One of the company's main inventors of LCD calculators was Tadashi Sasaki. Sharp introduced low-cost microwave ovens affordable for residential use in the late 1970s. Sharp ventured into the high end stereo market in 1976 with the introduction of high end receivers, amplifiers, speakers, turntables and cassette players. The Optonica line as it was called, consisted of high quality and technically advanced components, that was expanded in 1979, to cover a broader selection of high end equipment. During this run, Sharp introduced digital technology to some of the Optonica products, along with the traditional analogue products, and offered a complete selection of models ranging from low power high end receivers to very powerful models. The line was again changed, in 1981, and moved mainly into digital high end, complete stereo systems with advanced technological features setting the trend towards the digital age. The line was discontinued after 1981, but the Optonica line was again re-introduced in the late 1980s for a high end line of television receivers and higher quality mass market audio products such as VCR's, surround sound receivers, CD cassette boom boxes, and portable cassette players. =2000-2012= Sharp's Mobile Communications Division created the world's first commercial camera phone, the J-SH04, in Japan in 2000. Since 2000, Sharp heavily invested in LCD panel manufacturing plants: Kameyama in 2004, Sakai in 2009. The Sakai plant is still the only 10th generation LCD manufacturing plant on the globe and its best fit for production of 60-inch or larger panels. However, the 2008 financial crisis and strong Yen (especially against Won) significantly lowered world demand for Japanese LCD panels. Furthermore, the switch to digital TV broadcasting was virtually completed in Japan by the middle of 2011. Via Japanese government issued coupons for digital TV sets, consumers were encouraged to purchase digital TV sets until March 2011. This hit the Japanese LCD TV market, reducing it almost by half from 2010. All of those events strongly hit Sharp's LCD business. As the result, the Sakai LCD plant suffered a reduced operating rate until Q3 2012. In June 2005 Sharp produced the largest LCD television at the time, with a display of 65 inches. It went on sale in August 2005 in Japan. From 2005 to 2010 Sharp was the biggest mobile phone brand in Japan. Since then it has been constantly switching places through financial quarters against rivals Fujitsu, Apple and Sony. Sharp acquired a controlling stake in Pioneer Corporation in 2007. At CES 2007, Sharp introduced a prototype largest LCD TV, with a screen size of 108 inches. In July 2008 Sharp announced that the model will go into production for the Japanese market. In 2008, Sharp collaborated with Emblaze Mobile on the Monolith, ‚Äú‚Ä¶an ambitious project to design the ultimate holistic mobile device\\". The project was never brought to market. Key software developers were later picked up by other companies. On 25 June 2009, Sharp and Pioneer agreed to form a joint venture comprising their optical businesses, called \\"Pioneer Digital Design and Manufacturing Corporation\\". In 2012 Sharp unveiled the largest production TV at the time, with a screen size of 80 inches. It is part of the Aquos range and went on sale in Japan at around JP¬•950,000. =2012 - present = 2012 was the 100th anniversary for Sharp but it announced the worst financial record in its history, with a loss of JP¬•376 billion (US$4.7 billion) in April 2012. In September, Sharp announced job cuts. In 2014, Sharp was able to stem losses and deliver a positive net income for its first quarter results. In March 2012 the Taiwan-based electronics company Hon Hai, trading as Foxconn, agreed to acquire a 10% stake in Sharp Corporation for US$806 million, and to purchase up to 50 percent of the LCD displays produced at Sharp's plant in Sakai, Japan. In June 2012, Hon Hai chairman Terry Gou paid money for Sakai plant and got 50% ownership of the plant. However, since the announcement in March, Sharp's share price continued declining and reached JP¬•192 on 3 August. Sharp deal's price was originally JP¬•550 per share. Both companies agreed to renegotiate the share price, but they never came to an agreement. Sharp led the market share of mobile phones in the Japanese market in April 2012. Sharp reportedly held 3rd place in mobile phone market share in the Japanese market in May 2015. Sharp announced it accepted a US$100 million investment from Samsung in March 2013. In 2013 Sharp developed the most efficient solar cell, converting a record 44.4% of sunlight into electricity. In 2013, Sharp Corporation was the tenth-largest, by market share, television manufacturer in the world. In Japan it has been a long-time leader. After years of huge losses in its overseas TV business, Sharp sold its Mexico TV factory to Chinese electronics manufacturer Hisense for $23.7 million in July 2015. The sale includes rights to use the Sharp brand name and all its channel resources in North and South America, except Brazil. This meant that Sharp has exited the TV market in the Americas (except Brazil). It was a sign showing Sharp's rapid decline in that market, where it once was one of the leading manufacturers for LCD TVs a decade earlier. Sharp's television market share in North America was 4.6% in 2015. However Sharp remains the biggest television brand in the Japanese market. In October 2015 Sharp announced a smartphone that also works as a robot, called RoboHon. It would be sold in 2016 in Japan. Sharp began selling the world's first commercially available TV with a 8K resolution in October 2015. The 85-inch LV-85001 model costs JP¬•16 million (US$133,000). Japanese public broadcaster NHK will have test broadcasts at 8K starting 2016, with regular services expected by the time of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. On 25 February 2016, Foxconn announced its intent to acquire a 66% controlling stake in Sharp for 700 billion yen (US$6.24 billion). However, the deal was briefly delayed due to unforeseen financial liabilities; on 30 March 2016, Foxconn announced that it had agreed to pay US$3.5 billion for the stake instead, Foxconn wished to use the purchase to expand into direct-to-consumer product sales rather than serving as a contract manufacturer. In September 2016 Sharp unveiled the Sharp INTELLOS Automated Unmanned Ground Vehicle (A-UGV) at the ASIS International 62nd Annual Seminar and Exhibits (ASIS 2016) in Orlando, Florida. In March 2017, Demolition of Sharp's former headquarters began. On 28 April 2017, Sharp turned its first operating profit in three years, citing the restructuring efforts by Foxconn. In June 2017, Sharp sued its Chinese licensee Hisense for damaging the reputation of its brand, seeking an exit from its licensing agreement. Sharp accused the company of producing \\"shoddily manufactured\\" televisions under the Sharp name, including products they believed were in violation of U.S. safety standards for electromagnetic radiation, and the subject of deceptive advertising over their quality. Hisense denied that it engaged in these practices, and stated that it planned to defend itself in court and \\"will continue to manufacture and sell quality televisions under the Sharp licensed brands.\\" In February 2018, Sharp dropped the lawsuit against Hisense. In 2019 Sharp re-acquired its own brand for use on TV's in the US market. In March 2020, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, Sharp announced it would use a TV factory with high-end clean rooms to manufacture surgical masks. Sharp acquired the remaining shares of Dynabook from Toshiba in August 2020, making Dynabook a wholly owned subsidiary of Sharp. Sharp had first purchased Dynabook from Toshiba in 2018. Products Sharp J-SH07 mobile phone, 2001 (Japanese market) Core technologies and products include: LCD panels, solar panels, mobile phones, audio-visual entertainment equipment, video projectors, Multi-Function Printing Devices, microwave ovens, air conditioners, cash registers, CMOS and CCD sensors, and flash memory. The first commercial camera phone was also made by Sharp for the Japanese market in November 2000. Recent products include the ViewCam, the Ultra-Lite notebook PC, the Zaurus personal digital assistant, Sidekick 3, and the AQUOS flat screen television. Sharp manufactures consumer electronic products, including LCD televisions, sold under the Aquos brand, mobile phones, microwave ovens, Home cinema and audio systems, air purification systems, fax machines and calculators. For the business market, Sharp also produces projectors and monitors and a variety of photocopiers and Laser Printers, in addition to electronic cash registers and Point of sale technologies. For the private security industry, Sharp produces an Automated Unmanned Ground Vehicle (A-UGV) named INTELLOS, which utilizes a navigation surveillance platform also developed by Sharp. The system combines automation, mobility, and a variety of monitoring and detection capabilities to extend the impact of a traditional security force. Sharp Solar is a supplier of silicon photovoltaic (PV) solar cells,Daniel Glick, \\"Sharp‚Äôs Solar Solutions\\", Newsweek, 3 August 2009, pp. 16‚Äì23 (special advertising section) and offers a solar TV. In Q1 2010 the company made the highest revenues from production of solar PV systems. For the corporate meeting room market, Sharp was the first company to bring the Windows collaboration display to market, which is a 70inch interactive display with built-in unified communication equipment and an IoT sensor hub for measuring environmental room conditions. The Windows collaboration display is conceived to be seamlessly compatible with Microsoft's Office productivity products, as well as make use of the Microsoft Azure cloud services with the IoT sensor hub generated data. Operations=Japan= Kameyama, Mie, Japan Taki, Mie, Japan Net sales for the year 2003 were $16.8 billion. The corporation employs 46,600 staff, of which around half live outside Japan. It operates from 64 bases in 30 countries and its products are distributed in 164 countries worldwide. Many of its regional subsidiaries trade under the name Sharp Electronics. Sharp was among the Top 100 R&D; Spenders in a list published by the IEEE Spectrum magazine in 2002. Sharp's headquarters are at 1 Takumi-ch≈ç, Sakai-ku, Sakai, Japan. Until the relocation to Sakai in 2016, the headquarters were in Abeno-ku, Osaka where Hayakawa restarted the business in the 1920s. =Europe= In 2007 Sharp opened a LCD manufacturing plant in Poland. The plant initially manufactured LCD modules using LCD panels imported from Sharp Japan. In September 2014, Sharp announced that Slovakian electronics company UMC (Universal Media Corporation /Slovakia/ s.r.o.) was acquiring an exclusive brand licence from Sharp and its European television and audio business UMC will also acquire Sharp's Polish factory. As part of the deal, Sharp will support the design and development of televisions sold by UMC under the Sharp brand. The same month, Sharp also announced a tie-up with Vestel in Europe for white goods. Vestel will sell Sharp-branded white goods (except air conditioners), such as refrigerators and microwave ovens manufactured by Sharp in Thailand and China. Sharp will also license its brand name to Vestel for volume home appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines and ovens. Sharp's remaining European business will then focus on the business-to-business sector including multi-function printers and energy solutions. In 2017 Sharp acquired a majority (56.7%) shareholding in Skytec UMC, which included the UMC Poland factory. =Factories= *Poland : Sharp Manufacturing Poland Sp. z o.o., in Toru≈Ñ, Poland (Europe) *Indonesia : Sharp also has a refrigerator manufacturing facility in Karawang, Indonesia, established 2014. *Malaysia : Sharp has an export-only Television factory at the HICOM Industrial Park in Shah Alam, Selangor. This plant manufactures television sets for export only to North America. Sharp also has two domestic appliances plant - the Batu Pahat plant in Johor that manufactures audio- visual Equipment like television sets and Blu-Ray players, and the Sungai Petani plant in Kedah that manufactures radios as well as kitchen appliances like blenders and rice cookers. Formerly there was a plant in Petaling Jaya that manufactured television sets, VCRs, microwave ovens, washing machines and refrigerators, this plant was hit badly by the 1997 Asian financial crisis and shut down as Sharp moved the productions of the appliances to either Batu Pahat (TVs and VCRs) or Sungai Petani (microwave ovens), or out of the country altogether (refrigerators and washing machines) in a bid to reduce operating costs. *(former) Mexico : LCD plant (Sharp Electr√≥nica Mexico S.A. de C.V. SEMEX) - established as a color CRT TV plant in 1997; began LCD production in 2003; a second LCD plant on site was opened in 2007. The facility and rights to use the Sharp brand on TVs in North America was sold to Hisense in 2015. Antitrust law violations=US= On 8 November 2008, the United States Department of Justice announced that Sharp had agreed to pay $120 million (United States Dollar) as a criminal fine. According to the announcement, Sharp participated in conspiracies to fix the price of TFT LCD panel for Dell's computer monitors and laptops (2001‚Äì2005), Motorola's Razr phones (2005‚Äì2006) and Apple's iPod (2005‚Äì2006). =Japan= On 18 December 2008, Japan Fair Trade Commission ordered Sharp to pay JP¬•261 million (US$3 million) as criminal fine. According to the order, Sharp and Hitachi Display participated in the conspiracies to keep the price for TFT LCD panels for Nintendo DS and DS-Lite. Fine for Hitachi Displays was waived by JFTC leniency program. However, Sharp disagreed with the JFTC order and announced to begin appeal procedure against it on 2 February 2009. On 31 July 2013, JFTC dismissed Sharp's appeal. Environmental record Sharp's booth at CES 2012 in Los Angeles, CA In November 2011 Sharp was ranked in 11th place by Greenpeace's re-launched Guide to Greener Electronics that ranks 15 electronics manufacturers according to their policies and practices to reduce their impact on the climate, produce greener products, and make their operations more sustainable. Greenpeace summarizes the corporation's environmental record thus: \\"Sharp supports a new renewable energy law in Japan but scores poor on all sustainable operations criteria\\". Sharp scored 3/10 and received most of its points on the Products criteria where the company was praised for the energy efficiency of its products with all of its TVs meeting the latest Energy Star standard. It also gained some points for having a relative long term target to reduce CO2 emissions by two percent (per production unit) compared to the previous year, yet sets out no clear target for absolute reductions. The company was also praised for its public support for a clean energy policy, after advocating the Japanese Government to increase the use of renewable energy. Sharp scored the fewest points in the guide in the Sustainable Operations category, scoring no points for chemical management due to not communicating commitments made on phasing out hazardous substances in its supply chain. The guide also notes that Sharp had lacked any initiative to address the issue of conflict minerals and the exclusion of paper sourced from suppliers involved in illegal logging or deforestation. Sponsorships Sharp was the principal sponsor of Manchester United Football Club from 1983 until 2000, in one of the lengthiest and most lucrative sponsorship deals in English football. Sharp's logo was on the front of United's shirts over these 17 years, during which the team won seven Premier League titles, five FA Cups, one Football League Cup, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, and one UEFA Champions League title. During 2002/03 and 2003/04 seasons, Sharp was sponsor on Red Star Belgrade shirts during their campaign in UEFA Cup and UEFA Champions League.

It is established in Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark, and also has members in Iceland. It has been banned in Finland since 2019. The NRM has been described as a terrorist organization due to their aim of abolishing democracy along with their paramilitary activities, weapons caches and connections to proscribed terrorist organizations such as the Russian Imperial Movement and National Action. Formation and structure In December 1997, Klas Lund and some other former members of the White Aryan Resistance (Swedish: Vitt Ariskt Motst√•nd, also known as VAM) - a militant neo-Nazi network active from 1991 to 1993 - were released from prison after being convicted of robberies, bombings and killings, among other things. They formed the Swedish Resistance Movement (Svenska Motst√•ndsr√∂relsen or SMR) together with individuals working with the neo-Nazi magazine Folktribunen and members of Nationell Ungdom (\\"National Youth\\"), a neofascist and openly racist organisation known for the murder of the anarchist Bj√∂rn S√∂derberg.https://www.expressen.se/gt/fran-vitt-ariskt- motstand-till-nordiska-motstandsrorelsen/ \\"From White Aryan Resistance to Nordic Resistance Movement\\" In 2016, the Nordic Resistance Movement was formed, with separate affiliates in Sweden, Finland, and Norway; a Danish affiliate was later disbanded. The Nordic Resistance Movement advocates an immediate stop to what they call mass immigration to the Scandinavian countries, and repatriation of people that are not of Northern European or of closely related descent. It also advocates Nordic self-sufficiency and withdrawal from the European Union. On 28 February 2018, The Verge reported that Discord had shut down a number of neo-Nazi and alt-right servers, including that of the Nordic Resistance Movement, from their private chat platform, for abuse of their Terms of Service.Liao, Shannon (February 28, 2018) \\"Discord shuts down more neo-Nazi, alt-right servers\\" The Verge Ideology Nordic Resistance Movement demonstration The aim of Nordic Resistance Movement is to establish a totalitarian neo-Nazi Nordic State \\"consisting of the Nordic countries Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark, Iceland and possibly the Baltic countries\\"http://www.inblick.se/nyheter/2018/01/18/nordiska-motstandsrorelsen- delade-ut-500-000-flygbladby/ by revolution or elections. The organization itself describes its goals differently: ‚ÄúAlthough the Resistance Movement strives to create a state with authoritarian leadership, it is also our goal to develop and secure freedom and democracy. The Nordic National Socialist Republic will be a leader state, but it will also be a people's democracy.Framtidens styre The organization says its fight will require bloodshed.The NMR has praised Adolf Hitler and Corneliu Codreanu in their publications. Their main tactics are distributing leaflets and making public speeches in inner-city areas in support of neo-Nazism, denouncing immigration. They also publish the Nationellt Motst√•nd magazine. Sweden The Swedish Resistance Movement (Svenska motst√•ndsr√∂relsen or \\"SMR\\") was founded by Klas Lund. In 2020 its leader was Simon Lindberg, and its political wing was managed by . It is known for its opposition to non-white immigration to Sweden. The SMR is considered a central actor in Sweden's white power movement. In November 2003 the Swedish Security Service raided homes of leading members, among them Lund, who was later sentenced to prison for illegal possession of firearms. In May 2006, the Swedish Resistance Movement announced that the National Youth organisation and all its activities and members had been merged with the SRM. In December 2013, armed NRM members attacked an anti-racist demonstration in Stockholm which resulted in riots and clashes. Many were arrested afterwards. In the 2014 Swedish election, two members of the NRM were elected to Sweden Democrats seats in the municipal councils in Ludvika and Borl√§nge. In what has been described as a \\"coup\\" their names were added to Sweden Democrats' ballots that were open for additions. Late in 2015, the NRM was registered as a political party in Sweden, headed by the organization's spokesman, P√§r √ñberg.http://www.esisc.org/publications/briefings/radicalization-polarization- and-xenophobia-the-growing-influence-of-the-nordic-resistance-movement-in- sweden-and-finland \\"Indeed, since 2015 the NRM has been a registered political party in Sweden.http://kungalvsposten.se/nyheter/nazistparti-vill-ta-plats-i- kungalv/ \\"The Nazi party, the Nordic Resistance Movement; NRM, will take part in the municipal elections in Kung√§lv next autumn\\"https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/forskare-nordiska-motstandsrorelsen- ar-en-valdsam-sekt \\"For a few years, the Nordic Resistance Movement has been a political party, and holds seats in both Ludvika and Borl√§nge Municipal Councils\\"https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/vRlzw/nazister-kommer-till- almedalen \\"The Nazi and Antisemitic party 'The Nordic Resistance Movement; NRM' will for the first time take part in the Politicians' Week in Almedalen, reports Gotlands Allehanda\\". Three men with ties to Swedish NRM were sentenced to prison for respectively eight and a half years, five years, and one and a half years on 7 July 2017 for three bombings in G√∂teborg which took place in November 2016 and January 2017. One person received life-threatening injuries at the bombing of a refugee centre in V√§stra Fr√∂lunda. They have appealed the verdict. The men were part of a group of Swedish and Finnish neo-Nazis who went to Russia to receive military training in firearms and explosives from the Russian Imperial Movement. Police also arrested a Russian man connected to the RIM and NRM and confiscated two weapon caches. On 30 September 2017, NRM staged a march with roughly 500 members taking part\\"Dozens of neo-Nazis arrested after violent clashes in Sweden\\", RT News, 30 September 2017, accessed 1 October 2017. in Sweden's second largest city G√∂teborg, timed to coincide with the annual G√∂teborg Book Fair.\\"Sweden‚Äôs literati wrestle with the far right\\", Politico Europe, 29 September 2017, accessed 1 October 2017. Fighting broke out between NRM and counterdemonstrators. Twenty-two NRM members including the organisation's leader Simon Lindberg were arrested on suspicion of violent public disorder, and one counter-demonstrator was arrested on suspicion of attacking a police officer.\\"NMR-ledaren Simon Lindberg anh√•llen efter nazimarschen\\", Aftonbladet, 1 October 2017, accessed 1 October 2017. Swedish Jews were outraged at the demonstration, which took place on the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur and was originally planned to pass near a synagogue. The march was re-routed and shortened following a court ruling. On 19 April 2018, fireworks were thrown at the U.S. embassy in Stockholm during a protest against the bombing of Syria. One NRM man was arrested. The same month a member was arrested for plotting to assassinate journalists. Police confiscated a shotgun from the man. On 6 July 2018, members of the NRM assaulted two pro-Israel activists in Gotland.Nazi threat stalks bucolic swedish political fest, Bloomberg.com, 8 July 2018.

The group describes itself as a \\"fighting organization\\" (\\"kamporganisation\\") and maintains very strict physical standards for its members. The members of the group have been convicted of over 100 violent crimes and weapon offenses and use an old church in V√§stmanland as their headquarters. Virtually nothing else is known about the underground sect of the already secretive group. Finland Suomen Vastarintaliike (\\"Finnish Resistance Movement\\") is the Finnish branch of the Nordic Resistance Movement. It was founded by Esa Henrik Holappa, who would later abandon neo-Nazism and leave the group.https://www.hate-speech.org/a-neo-nazi-leader-breaks-off/ Hate Speech International - \\"A neo-Nazi leader no more\\"https://www.nrk.no/norge/_-jeg-omfavnet-hitlers-tanker-1.12957059 NRK - \\"I embraced Hitler's thoughts\\"http://expo.se/2016/han-var-ledare-for-nordiska- motstandsrorelsen-i-finland---nu-talar-han-ut_7096.html Expo - \\"He was the leader of the Nordic Resistance Movement in Finland - Now he speaks up\\" Its current leader is Antti Niemi.https://varisverkosto.com/2017/06/repentant- leader-manslaughter-and-nazi-march-year-2016-for-finlands-nordic-resistance- movement/ Varisverkosto - \\"Repentant leader, manslaughter, and Nazi march - Year 2016 for Finland's Nordic Resistance Movement\\" Some of the group's activities include planting of propaganda posters and organizing demonstrations. The members also participate in hand to hand combat and shooting training arranged by the organization. The organisation is responsible for multiple violent crimes, including attacking anti-racism and gay pride demonstrations and stabbing participants of a left-wing event. According to an investigation by Yleisradio, two thirds of the members have a conviction for a violent crime. The FRM is responsible for killing an antifascist activist in 2016 in Helsinki. The group also awarded the title of \\"activist of the year\\" to a member convicted of torturing a man to death and possessing illegal weapons. The group assaults people they consider political enemies in their homes, a practice they dub \\"home visits\\". In 2020 a campaign chairman was left critically injured after being beaten with a clawhammer in his home in J√§ms√§. A man connected to the group is charged with attempted murder along with another man. The FRM also vandalized the Israeli embassy over 20 times and defaced synagogues, causing the Finnish embassador to be called to the Israeli foreign ministry in Jerusalem twice. The FRM along with other nationalist organizations organizes an annual torch march demonstration in Helsinki on the Finnish independence day, which ends at the Hietaniemi cemetery where members visit the tomb of Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim and the monument to the Finnish SS Battalion. The event has been protested by antifascists, which has led to counterdemonstrators being violently assaulted by the FRM members who act as security. The demonstration attracts close to 3000 participants according to the estimates of the police and hundreds of officers patrol Helsinki to prevent violent clashes. The march has been attended and promoted by the Finns Party, and condemned by left-wing parties, for example Green League MP Iiris Suomela characterized it as \\"obviously neo- nazi\\" and expressed her disappointment in it being attended by such a large number of people. The event also attracts neo-nazis from abroad and has been attended by the FRM's foreign allies like the Junge Nationalisten, who praised the event and compared it to the Battle of Helsinki, when Germans and Finns marched side by side in the city and liberated it from the communists. In addition to violent crimes, the FRM is closely connected to the proscribed terrorist organization National Action. A Finnish corporal who had served in Afghanistan and was a member of both the FRM and National Action was convicted of terror offenses and membership in the proscribed organization while living in Llansilin. The leader of National Action, Benjamin Raymond, also visited the FRM in Finland and held speeches and was pictured posing with an assault rifle. The FRM also cooperates with the neo-nazi military formation Azov Battalion according to Yle. Dozens of the Finns are also part of the Iron March terror network famous for spawning the Atomwaffen Division. The group distributes the magazine Musta Kivi advocating Esoteric Hitlerism and Order of Nine Angles and sells books by Savitri Devi and ONA adept Kerry Bolton of the Black Order. *Kadulle.com - Kerry Bolton & Savitri Devi *Order of Nine Angles - Kansallinen Vastarinta *Kerry Bolton - Kansallinen Vastarinta *Uusi suomalainen kansallismielinen lehti!, Kansallinen Vastarinta **\\"The Finnish magazine Musta Kivi (Black Stone) that deals mainly with esoteric National Socialism.

Even though the FRM rejects parlamentarism unlike the Swedish branch, there have been numerous cases where members of the Finns Party have attracted criticism from the other parties and antifascists for attending events organized by or with the FRM. Several members of the Finns Party took part in an event where the participants shot and threw knives at targets, using photos of members of the Rinne Cabinet and attended an event commemorating Eugen Schauman who assassinated Nikolay Bobrikov. Finns Party Youth members and leaders also attend \\"Etnofutur\\" ethnonationalist conferences in Estonia organized by the Blue Awakening together with the FRM. The founder of Blue Awakening and current MP for EKRE Ruuben Kaalep has been described as a neo-nazi and connected to the local proscribed terror group and Atomwaffen affiliate Feuerkrieg Division. On 30 November 2017, the Pirkanmaa District Court banned the Nordic Resistance Movement in Finland for 'flagrantly violated the principles of good practice'. The ban was appealed and a request by the police for a temporary ban was turned down. In September, 2018 the Court of appeal in Turku upheld the ban. In March, 2019, the Supreme Court placed a temporary ban on the group. On September 22, 2020, the Supreme Court upheld the ban. The Supreme Court noted in its ruling that \\"The use of violence linked to the organization‚Äôs activities has to be considered a part of the organization‚Äôs operations...The operating methods that were considered unlawful represented a substantial part of the organization‚Äôs operations, and [the organization] only engaged in a limited amount of other types of activities\\". The National Bureau of Investigation suspects the Nordic Resistance Movement to be continuing its operations under the names Kohti Vapautta! and Suomalaisapu. Norway Norske Motstandsbevegelsen (\\"Norwegian Resistance Movement\\") is the Norwegian chapter of the Nordic Resistance Movement, founded and chaired by Haakon Forwald, former member of Dissection and Misanthropic Luciferian Order.http://www.whiskey-soda.de/news.php?id=12247 \\"Dissection bassist Haakon Forwald leaves the band\\" They are organized in four subchapters (or nests) in Norway. In 2014 Norwegian police confiscated illegal submachine guns and automatic rifles from a member. In 2019, another member was arrested after hijacking an ambulance, trying to ram a police car and driving into a crowd. Inside the ambulance the police discovered a shotgun and Uzi submachine gun. Iceland There have been a few newspaper articles on ties of the movement to Iceland, and it has a website under Icelandic domain. In September 2019 between 10 and 15 Swedish members of the Nordic Resistance Movement staged an event at L√¶kjartorg in Reykjav√≠k where they spread flyers and promoted the organisation. The event sparked an anti-nazi demonstration a few days later which drew an estimated crowd of 200 participants.  See also  * Kohti Vapautta! * The III.

It is the capital and largest city of the judicial and administrative arrondissement of Kortrijk. The wider municipality comprises the city of Kortrijk proper and the villages of Aalbeke, Bellegem, Bissegem, Heule, Kooigem, Marke, and Rollegem. Kortrijk is also part of the cross-border Lille-Kortrijk-Tournai metropolitan area.List of municipalities : http://fr.eurometropolis.eu/qui-sommes-nous/territoire.html The city is on the river Leie, southwest of Ghent and northeast of Lille. Mouscron in Wallonia is just south of Kortrijk. Populationdata.net , Palmar√®s des plus grandes villes du monde ‚Äì page 3] Beguinage of Kortrijk Kortrijk originated from a Gallo-Roman town, Cortoriacum, at a crossroads near the Leie river and two Roman roads. In the Middle Ages, Kortrijk grew significantly thanks to the flax and wool industry with France and England and became one of the biggest and richest cities in Flanders. The city is often referred to as City of Groeninge or City of the Golden Spurs, referring to the Battle of Courtrai or the Battle of the Golden Spurs which took place on 11 July 1302 on the Fields of Groeninge in Kortrijk. In 1820 the Treaty of Kortrijk was signed, laying out the still-current borders between France and Belgium. Throughout the 19th and 20th century, the flax industry flourished and remains important within the Belgian textile industry today. Kortrijk is the largest city in southern West Flanders, with several hospitals, colleges and a university. Kortrijk was the first city in Belgium with a pedestrian shopping street, the Korte Steenstraat.  History =Name= The Roman name Cortoriacum meant in Latin, the settlement near the curb in the river. There is also mention of 'Cortoracum' in some literature. Its name later evolved to 'Cortrycke', 'Cortryck' and 'Kortrijk' (19th Century). The French call it Courtrai. = Origins Roman times = Findings from an archeological dig in 1950 in which remains of three Roman funeral pyres were foundhttp://www.all- archeo.be/rapporten/217_Kortrijk_Morinnestraat/217%20Rapport%20Kortrijk%20-%20Morinnestraat.pdf suggest that the vicus was used as an encampment by the Romans during their invasion of Britain in 43 CE. Cortoriacum was a larger Gallo-Roman vicus of civitas Menapiorum at an important crossroads near the Lys river of the Roman roads linking Tongeren and Cassel and Tournai and Oudenburg. It was first mentioned in a document from the 4th or 5th century called Notitia Dignitatum where the Cortoriacenses (Cavalry)Troops were mentioned. In the 9th century, Baldwin II, Count of Flanders established fortifications against the Vikings. The town gained its city charter in 1190 from Philip, Count of Flanders. The population growth required new defensive walls, part of which can still be seen today (the Broeltorens, Armory, Kortrijk). Several local places still refer to physical parts of the defensive structures around Kortrijk (Walle, Waterpoort, Menenpoort, Gentsepoort, Brugsepoort, Kasteelkaai); Most of the physical parts have been overbuilt or destroyed. The second castle of Kortrijk In the 13th century, the battles between Fernando of Portugal, Count of Flanders and his first cousin, King Louis VIII of France, led to the destruction of the city. The Counts of Flanders had it rebuilt soon after. To promote industry and weaving in the town, Joan, Countess of Flanders exempted settlers in Kortrijk from property tax.Fegley, 124 From that time, Kortrijk gained great importance as a center of linen production. = Battle of the Golden Spurs = In 1302, the population of Bruges started a successful uprising against the French, who had annexed Flanders a couple of years earlier. On 18 May the French population in that city was massacred, an event that could not go unpunished. The famous ensuing Battle of Courtrai in 1302, also known as the Battle of the Golden Spurs (Dutch: Guldensporenslag), between the Flemish people, mostly commoners and farmers, and Philip the Fair‚Äôs knights took place near Kortrijk on 11 July, resulting in a victory for Flanders;Courtrai (Flem. Kortrijk), a walled town of Belgium, on the Lys, 54 miles SW. of Brussels by rail, and 6 from the French frontier. It has a fine eld bridge flanked with towers, a noble townhall (1526), belfry, and a beautiful Gothic church, founded in 1238 by Baldwin, Count of Flanders. Table damask, linen, and lace are the chief manufactures. Population, about 35,000. Here, in 1302, the citizens of Ghent and Bruges won over the French the 'Battle of the Spurs,' so named from the number of gilt spurs gathered from the dead. Chambers's Concise Gazetteer Of The World, by David Patrick. W. & R. Chambers, Limited, 1906. the date is now commemorated as a national holiday by the whole Flemish community. Following a new uprising by the Flemish in 1323, this time against their own Count Louis I, the French invaded again. These Flemish acquisitions were consolidated by the French at the Battle of Cassel (1328). Louis I‚Äôs son Louis II lost the city to a Flemish uprising led by Philip van Artevelde in 1381, but the Flemish were later decisively defeated at the 1382 Battle of Roosebeke by Louis II with French support, resulting in a new wave of plundering and destruction. = 15th century to modern times = Most of the 15th century was prosperous under the Dukes of Burgundy, until the death of the Burgundian heiress, Mary of Burgundy, in 1482, which ushered in renewed fighting with France. The 16th century was marked by the confrontations engendered by the Reformation and the uprising of the Netherlands against Spain. Louis XIV‚Äôs reign saw Kortrijk occupied by the French five times in sixty years and its former fortifications razed. The Treaty of Utrecht finally assigned the whole area to Austria. After the French Revolution and the Napoleonic era, the textile industry, based on flax, and the general economy of the city could finally prosper again. Kortrijk was heavily bombed in the summer of 1917, but was liberated by the British Army the following year. During World War II the city was an important railway hub for the German army, and for this reason was the target of several allied air- strikes. On 21 July 1944 (the Belgian National Day) around 300 Avro Lancasters dropped over 5,000 bombs on the city center.From De Standaard 17/07/09 Kortrijk is bombardement na 65 jaar nog niet vergeten Many historical buildings on the central square, as well as the old railway station, were destroyed. = Battle of Courtrai= Battles fought there in 1302, 1382, 1580, 1793, 1794, 1814, 1815, and 1918 have each been called Battle of Courtrai  Geography  The medieval city hall. = Municipality = After the 1977 fusion the city is made up of: * I Kortrijk * II Heule * III Bissegem * IV Marke * V Aalbeke * VI Rollegem * VII Bellegem * VIII Kooigem = Neighboring municipalities = The metropolitan area, including the outer commuter zone, also consists of Kuurne, Wevelgem, Zwevegem and Harelbeke.

The river Lys (Leie) is an important way of transporting goods through inland navigation. The Bossuit-Kortrijk Canal enables in the city centre a direct connection with the river Scheldt. Within the City, the river briefly splits in two, to re-join about a mile further. * Oude Leie (Old Lys) original southernmost riverbed where the Broel towers still stand. * Nieuwe Leie (New Lys) New bed that was dug around 1585 by Humans to accommodate water powered equipment p.11 From the 1970s on, the planning and later the execution of the so-called Leiewerken (Leieworks) started. These construction works comprised the deepening and widening of the river. This would enable ships with 4400 tons to navigate from France to the Scheldt. At the same time, this project included a thorough urban renewal of the riversides in the city. Seven new bridges were to give a new architectural impulse to the river quarters as well as the construction of several new parks along the river. The following bridges were built during the period of 1997 and 2012: * Dambrug * Groeningebrug near the AlbertPark * Ronde van Vlaanderenbrug near the new Nelson Mandelapark * Collegebrug referring to the St Amands college * Noordbrug (2010) * Budabrug * Reepbrug (to be constructed) More recently (2018), the banks in front of the Broel Towers were lowered to allow the public to enjoy the historic river banks along both sides of the River Lys (Leie). This area is now known as the Leieboorden (or Banks of the River Lys), a place for pedestrians with bars and restaurants.  Other Smaller Waterways with Historic and Geological value  Several small streams or Beken in and around Courtrai were of significant topological, historical and Geological value.pp. 135-150 *Lange Mere Mentioned in the Town accounts of 1412-13 as Langhe Meere. *Mosscher (High Mossher and Low Mosscher) ending in the Southern Moat (Sanderus Map mentions only the 'Mosscher as a single toponym. It was also mentioned in almost full length on the Deventer Map. *Groeninghe (first mentioned as Groeninc in 1412 ) Its name came from the green color of the flooded meadow where it originated. *Grote Vijver (first mention as Hoghen vivere in the town accounts of 1416-17). *St-Jan's stream - Human Dug connecting stream *Klakkaert stream * Moat around the City (south of the Leie or Lys) *Neveldries *Bloedmeers = Cycling and pedestrian areas = Cars are required to yield to pedestrians and cyclists. In general, cars are led to large underground car parks in the historic centre of Kortrijk or Park&Ride; parking outside the town centre. Large parts of the historic centre are car free.  Economy  The city is historically connected with the flax and the textile industry, and still today the textile industry remains important in the region. Major companies which have headquarters in Kortrijk include Cisco, Barco and Bekaert.  Education  Kortrijk serves as an educational centre in south West Flanders, attracting students from the entire region. There are 55 schools in Kortrijk, on 72 different locations throughout the city, with an estimated 21,000 students. The city also provides higher education. The KULAK, a campus of the Catholic University of Leuven, is located in on the south edge of the city, in the Hoog Kortrijk quarter. Other institutes of higher education include the Katholieke Hogeschool Zuid-West- Vlaanderen (KATHO) and Hogeschool West-Vlaanderen (HOWEST) university colleges. There is also a campus of Ghent University.  European cooperation  Even though Kortrijk is a Dutch-speaking town, it borders Wallonia, and is only away from the border with France. This has created an urban area that extends across linguistic and national borders. The mayors of Lille, Kortrijk and Tournai met in Kortrijk on 28 January 2008 to sign a document creating the first European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation within the EU. The purpose of this organisation is to facilitate the movement of people within this area of nearly 2 million people. * Kortrijk is a member of the Eurotowns network  Culture  Ghent University Library. = Newspaper = * Kortrijk used to have its own newspaper in times of war, called het Kortrijks Oorlogsblad. = Theatres and concert venues = The City Theatre. * Kortrijk has several cultural centres, each comprising different locations: ** Cultural Centre Kortrijk ** City Theatre (De Schouwburg, see picture), a neo-Renaissance architecture theatre known for its glass ceiling, an artwork of the French- Algerian artist Alberola ** Arenatheatre ** Antigone Theatre ** Buda Kunstencentrum (Buda Arts Centre), comprising the cinema Budascoop, the artist residence Tacktower and the artist creation space Budafactory ** The Concertstudio ** Music Centre Track* Concert venue De Kreun * Cinemas ** Kinepolis, a modern cinema multiplex with 10 screens. ** Budascoop, a 5 screen cinema, specialised in European movies. = Festivals and events = The city is host to some sizable cultural events such as: * Day of the Flemish Community (11 July) * Golden River City Jazz Festival (first weekend of September) * Humorologie: cabaret festival * Next: arts festival in the Eurodistrict Kortrijk-Lille-Tournai * Happy New Ears: festival of experimental modern music * Budafest: theatre festival * The Internationaal Festival van Vlaanderen (April‚ÄìMay): several concerts of classical and modern music. * Novarock: rock festival in Kortrijk Xpo * Easter Carnival (Paasfoor): during the weeks after Easter * Sinxenfestival: one of the most vivid festivals downtown with street artists, concerts and flea markets all over town * Kortrijk Cong√© (July) * Alcatraz Hard Rock & Metal Festival (August) * Summer Carnival (weekend in August) * Student Welcome Concert: rock festival to celebrate the start of the new academic year at the Kortrijk University and the Kortrijk Colleges.

The company is listed on Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange of India. It is headquartered at Mumbai and employs about 3000 people. Ispat Industries was ranked 5th among major next to Tata steel and JSW steel companies in India for the year 2008 by Business World. History Nippon Denro Ispat Limited was incorporated in 1984 and was granted the first Industrial License by Government of India for manufacturing Galvanised Plain/Corrugated Sheets. IIL was set up as a cold rolling reversing mill, in collaboration with Hitachi Ltd. of Japan, to manufacture a wide range of cold rolled carbon steel strips. In 1988 it installed a color coating line and was granted Industrial License for Cold Rolled Sheets. In 1994 Business interests within the Group were demarcated. The eldest son, Mr. L N Mittal continued managing the international operations while Mr. Pramod Mittal and Mr. Vinod Mittal, the younger brothers focused on steel and other businesses in India. In 1994, it commissioned the world's largest gas-based single mega module plant for manufacturing direct reduced iron (sponge iron), at its Maharashtra-based Dolvi plant. In 1995 hot strip mill with Continuous Strip Processing (CSP) technology was installed at Dolvi. In 1998, integrated steel plant for the production of hot rolled coils was launched, using technologies such as the Conarc Process for steel making and the Compact Strip Process. Year 2000 saw the erection and commissioning of a 2 MTPA blast furnace at the Dolvi steel complex. Sponge iron capacity was increased from 1.2 MTPA to 1.4 MTPA in the year 2003.

He later became a key contributor to the 1960s race to the moon, with pioneering work on space-based guidance systems for the Apollo moon missions. From 1955 to 1980, he was deputy associate director of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory. In 1956 he published the book Random Processes in Automatic Control (McGraw-Hill Series on Control System Engineering), with Richard Battin as a coauthor. In collaboration with Phil Hankins and Charlie Werner of MIT, he initiated work on MAC (MIT Algebraic Compiler), an algebraic programming language for the IBM 650, which was completed by early spring of 1958.Guidance system Career Laning received his PhD from MIT in 1947 with a dissertation titled \\"Mathematical Theory of Lubrication-Type Flow\\".

Battin, to develop a scheme for doing onboard navigation on the Apollo program's command/service module guidance system. He designed the Executive and Waitlist operating system for the LGC (Lunar Module Guidance Computer) in the mid 1960s; he made it up from whole cloth with no examples to guide him, and the design is still valid today. The allocation of functions among a sensible number of asynchronous processes, under control of a rate and priority-driven preemptive executive, still represents the state of the art in real-time GN&C; computers for spacecraft. His design saved the Apollo 11 landing mission when the rendezvous radar interface program began using more register core sets and \\"Vector Accumulator\\" areas than were physically available in memory, causing the infamous 1201 and 1202 errors.

A 15 dB link margin means that the system could tolerate an additional 15 dB of attenuation between the transmitter and the receiver, and it would still just barely work. It is typical to design a system with at least a few dB of link margin, to allow for attenuation that is not modeled elsewhere. For example, a satellite communications system operating in the tens of gigahertz might require additional link margin (vs. the link budget assuming lossless propagation), in order to ensure that it still works with the extra losses due to rain fade or other external factors. A system with a -negative link margin would mean the system is insufficient to transfer data, usually this means a better receiver is needed, with improved sensitivity.

Attaining dimensions of up to tall by wide, the pear- or egg-shaped puffball is readily recognizable because of the large pyramidal or polygonal warts covering its surface. It is edible when young, before the spores inside the fruit body disintegrate into a brownish powder. The spores are roughly spherical, and have wart-like projections on their surfaces. Originally described from the Sierra Nevada, C. sculpta is found in mountainous areas in western North America, and was found in a Brazilian dune in 2008. It may be easily confused with Calbovista subsculpta, a similar puffball that‚Äîin addition to differences observable only with a microscope‚Äîis larger, and has slightly raised warts with a felt-like texture. Other similar species include Calvatia arctica and immature specimens of Amanita magniverrucata. Taxonomy and naming The species was first described in 1885 by American mycologist Harvey Willson Harkness, under the name Lycoperdon sculptum. Harkness, who called it \\"a curious and strikingly beautiful species\\", found fruit bodies growing at elevations between in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Although he noted that \\"in appearance it differs so much from any species known to us, as to be almost deemed worthy of generic rank\\", he thought that placement in the puffball genus Lycoperdon was the most appropriate classification, despite its unusual cortex. Harkness's type collections were destroyed in the fires following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. In 1904, Curtis Gates Lloyd considered the species better placed in Calvatia, because of the resemblance of its deeply colored capillitial threads (coarse thick-walled cells found in the gleba) to those of Calvatia caelata; he called the species Calvatia sculptum. The mushroom is known by several common names, including the \\"sculpted puffball\\", the \\"sculptured puffball\\", the \\"pyramid puffball\\", and the \\"Sierran puffball\\". In 1992, German mycologist Hanns Kreisel, in his survey of the genus Calvatia, defined the section Sculpta to contain C. sculpta and C. subcretacea. Two years later he merged the section Cretacea into Sculpta when it was shown that C. subcretacea was synonymous with the arctic-alpine species C. arctica. Description The gleba of young fruit bodies are firm and yellowish-white. The white pear- or egg-shaped fruit body of C. sculpta may be tall by wide. The outer layer of tissue, known as the exoperidium, is covered on the outer surface with distinctive long, pointed, pyramid-shaped warts, either erect or bent over and sometimes connected at the tip with other warts. The warts bear parallel horizontal lines towards the base. Mycologist David Arora opined that C. sculpta resembled \\"a cross between a geodesic dome and a giant glob of meringue.\\" In age, the peridium sloughs off and exposes a brownish spore mass. The interior of the puffball, the gleba, is firm and yellowish-white when young, but gradually becomes powdery and deep olive-brown as it matures. The spores are roughly spherical, thick-walled, 3‚Äì6 ¬µm in diameter (although some specimens collected in the US range from 7.2 to 9.5 ¬µm), and are covered with minute spines or warts. The use of scanning electron microscopy has revealed that these ornamentations on the spores are typically 0.95 ¬µm long. Spore ultrastructure is distinctive among Calvatia species, and has been used to help verify taxonomic groupings and confirm the status of species within the genus. The capillitia (coarse, thick-walled hyphae in the gleba) are septate, with branches that are narrowed towards the tips; they are 3‚Äì8 ¬µm in diameter. When grown in pure culture in the laboratory, C. sculpta is, under certain conditions, able to grow structures called mycelial strands. These are linear aggregates of hyphae whereby older \\"leading\\" hyphae become enclosed by coiled layers of newer \\"tendril\\" hyphae. Mycelial strands provide a conduit for transporting water and nutrients across non-nutrient material, allowing the fungus to reach new sources of food. They are also implicated in the formation of fruit bodies and sclerotia. The mycelia of C. sculpta can be induced to form mycelial strands when there is a permeable physical barrier between it and the agar substrate. The wide hyphae in the center of the mycelial strands contain protein-dense structures on their cell walls that are shaped like a torus. Their function is unknown. =Edibility= Calvatia sculpta is edible, and said to be \\"choice\\" by some authors. The taste is described as \\"mild\\" and the flesh has no distinguishable odor. Arora recommends eating the puffball only when it is firm and white inside, as older specimens may have a distasteful iodine-like flavor. The puffball may be preserved by freezing fresh or partially cooked slices, but their flavor and texture will deteriorate unless cooked immediately after thawing. Recommended cooking techniques for puffball slices include saut√©ing and coating in batter before frying. C. sculpta was used as a traditional food of the Plains and Sierra Miwok Indians of North America, who called the fungus potokele or patapsi. Puffballs were prepared by drying them in the sun, grinding them with a mortar, and boiling them before eating with acorn soup. =Similar species= The giant western puffball, Calvatia booniana, is much larger than C. sculpta‚Äîup to in diameter and tall‚Äîand has a smoother surface. Mature specimens of Calvatia arctica (synonymous with Calvatia subcretacea, Gastropila subcretacea, and Handkea subcretacea) can resemble immature specimens of C. sculpta. It is distinguished from C. sculpta by its tough, thicker peridial wall, and its scales are tipped with gray-brown. Calbovista subsculpta is similar in appearance, but has more flattened and less prominent pyramidal warts. Microscopically, its capillitia are thin-walled and frequently and irregularly branched, in contrast to the thick-walled infrequently branched capillitia of C. sculpta. The \\"possibly toxic\\" Amanita magniverrucata, in its embryonic stage, has a superficial resemblance as it also has pyramidal cap warts. However, it grows at different elevations and different seasons than C. sculpta. Further, slicing the fruit body of A. magniverrucata in half will reveal internal structures of cap, gills and stem not present in puffballs. Habitat and distribution The sculptured puffball grows solitarily or in small groups in forest duff. It is typically associated with coniferous forests at high elevations, greater than about , on western mountains like the Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range. The United States distribution includes the states of California, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. An uncommon species, it fruits throughout spring, summer, and fall during wet weather. Most commonly known from western North America, the species was reported growing on sandy soil in Natal Dunes State Park in the northeastern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Norte in 2008. The fruit bodies were associated with the roots of the native tree species Eugenia brasiliensis. Several hypotheses have been proposed to account for this disjunct distribution: the species may have been present before the Americas separated; it may have been introduced to Brazil by human activity, and subsequently adapted to the environment there; or the North and South American populations may represent a cryptic species complex‚Äîappearing morphologically similar but genetically distinct. The Brazilian population has not been compared genetically with North American specimens.

These variations were once used as a basis for dividing the group into subclasses. The majority of marine gastropods breathe through a single gill, supplied with oxygen by a current of water through the mantle cavity. This current is U-shaped, so that it also flushes waste products away from the anus, which is located above the animal's head, and would otherwise cause a problem with fouling. In the pulmonate gastropods, which are found on both land and in freshwater, the gill has been replaced by a simple lung. With gills=With filamentous gills= The sea slug Pleurobranchaea meckelii respires using a gill (or ctenidium), which is visible in this view of the right side of the animal In gastropods in many ancient lineages, the gills are bipectinate, having an overall shape that is similar to a bird's feather, with narrow filaments projecting either side of a central stalk. Gastropods such as abalone and keyhole limpets have two gills, which is believed to be the arrangement in the earliest fossil gastropods. The water current to supply these gills is evacuated through a slit or notch in the upper surface of the shell, below which the anus opens. In most other gastropods, the right gill has been lost. In groups such as the turban shells the gill still retains its primitive bipectinate form, and in these animals, the water current is oblique, entering the mantle cavity on the left side of the head, flowing over the gill, and then being flushed out on the right side. The anus is also on the right side of the body, so that waste matter is efficiently carried away. Bipectinate gills have to be supported by membranes, and these can become fouled with debris and sediment, restricting such gastropods to relatively clean-water environments, such as water flowing over solid rock. In living gastropods, a unipectinate arrangement is more common, allowing species to invade muddy or sandy environments. This type of gill is firmly anchored to the mantle wall along its length, with a single row of filaments projecting down into the water stream. Unipectinate gills are found in a wide range of snails, including marine, freshwater, and even terrestrial forms. Examples include periwinkles, conches, and whelks. The water current is oblique, as it is in the turban shells, but many have developed a siphon formed from the rolled-up margin of the mantle. The siphon sucks in water to the mantle cavity, and may be long enough to extend through the substrate in burrowing species. In one amphibious group, the Ampullariidae, the mantle cavity is divided into two, with a unipectinate gill on one side, and a lung on the other, so that these snails can respire using air or water. Freshwater snail Melanoides tuberculata. Arrows are pointing to the pallial tentacles for breathing. =Other gill arrangements= The dorid nudibranch Chromodoris joshi has a rosette of gills far back on the body. Nudibranch means \\"naked gills\\". Near the front of the animal are the two rhinophores. In many gastropods, the filamentous gill has been replaced by a \\"plicate\\", or folded, structure. Many of these gastropods have also undergone detorsion, such that the mantle cavity and gill have shifted round to the right side of the body. This type of arrangement is found in the bubble shells and also in the sea hares, which also possess an exhalant siphon which sends fouled water away from the body. In some nudibranchs, the mantle cavity and the original gill have disappeared altogether. Instead, the upper surface of the body has numerous club-shaped or branched projections called cerata that function as secondary gills. Secondary gills are also present in the unrelated genus Patella, in which they are found as folds within the mantle cavity. Some smaller gastropods have neither true gills nor cerata. The genus Lepeta uses the whole of the mantle cavity as a respiratory surface, while many sea butterflies respire through their general body surface. Terrestrial gastropods Although not true pulmonates, some operculate land snails, such as the Cyclophoridae have also lost their gills, and developed a vascularised lung from the mantle cavity. These groups lack a pneumostome, having a much larger opening to the cavity. Since this opening is usually closed by the operculum when the animal retreats into its shell, there is often a separate breathing tube or a notch in the shell to allow air in and out. =Terrestrial pulmonates= In this image of an individual of Cepaea nemoralis, a pulmonate land snail, the pallial lung is visible through the translucent shell as the brightest yellow part of the body whorl The pulmonates have lost their gills and adapted the mantle cavity into a pallial lung. The lung has a single opening on the right side, called the pneumostome, which either remains permanently open, or opens and closes as the animal breathes. The roof of the lung is highly vascularised, and it is through this surface that gas exchange occurs. The majority of pulmonates are fully terrestrial. Most have the typical lung arrangement described above, but in the Athoracophoridae, the mantle cavity is replaced by a series of blind tubules, while the Veronicellidae respire through their skin, and have lost the lung altogether.  Freshwater snails  For freshwater snails with gills see above. = Freshwater pulmonates = Despite the presence of a lung, many pulmonates spend much of their lives underwater. Some of these possess secondary gills within the mantle cavity, while others must regularly return to the surface to breathe air, keeping their pneumostome closed while they are submerged. Some freshwater pulmonates keep a bubble of air inside the shell, which helps them to float. Many of the very small freshwater limpets which live in cold water have lost the ability to breathe air, and instead flood their mantle cavity with water. Oxygen diffuses from the water to the snail's body directly.Dillon R. T. (2006). Chapter 21. Freshwater Gastropoda. pages 251-259. In: Sturm C. F., Pearce T. A. & Vald√©s A. (eds.) (2006).

It is situated in the San Martino village. History Casa Cavassa was the residence of Galeazzo Cavassa and his son Francesco, members of a family (ennobled in 1460) native of Carmagnola and both general vicars of the marquisate of Saluzzo. Traces of a building dating back to the Middle Ages can be found in the basements and in the ogival windows of the fa√ßade overlooking Via San Giovanni. Since 1505 it became ownership of Francesco, vicar first during the rule of Ludovico II of Saluzzo (died 1504) and then during the Marguerite of Foix‚Äôs regency. Francesco Cavassa refurbished the building in a Renaissance style based on the new trends of the contemporary Padan area. After the restoration and enlargement, the layout took the semblance of an L, with the bodies joined by spiral stairs. The edifice took advantage of the sloping ground in order to extend over six floors, three underground included kitchens, cellars and servants‚Äô rooms, while the reception halls and the private apartments were on the upper floors. A rapid dilapidation started when Francesco, hostile to the new Marquis Giovanni Ludovico, was confined for political reasons and died a violent death. The edifice remained to the Cavassa heirs until the 18th century; later the house was divided into private apartments and the deterioration of the structures increased. In 1883 the edifice was purchased by Marquis Emanuele Tapparelli d‚ÄôAzeglio (nephew of the writer Massimo), a cosmopolitan diplomat, a lover of art and antiques. The Marquis entrusted Vittorio Avondo (painter, collector and future director of the Museums of Turin) and the engineer Melchiorre Pulciano with the restoration. They tried to recover the Renaissance appearance of the edifice, supported by numerous workshops located in Saluzzo and following the principle known as ‚Äúcompletion according to style‚Äù: eliminated of what was considered irrelevant and addition of what thought to be necessary in a 16th-century maison. For the fitting out of the chambers, which had been deprived of their original furnishings during the pillages following Francesco Cavassa‚Äôs death, many objects of art were acquired, some documenting the Cavassa family, others dating back to the 15th or 16th century and coming from the antique market or bestowed by collectors. Then, in order to complete the decor, the Marquis commissioned creation of pieces of furniture which could reproduce Renaissance and late Gothic works of art. At Tapparelli d'Azeglio's death in 1890, the municipality inherited the edifice and opened it to the public the following year. The present arrangement, as far as possible, replicates one projected by Marquis Tapparelli, which was recreated on the basis of the inventory drawn up by the notary Gullino in 1890 (after the Marquis' death) and according to some photographs taken at the end of the 19th century restoration works. Later some important works of art have been added to the Tapparelli collection. External links ‚ÄòCasa Cavassa di Saluzzo‚Äô, Castelli Aperti.

It is the first English vernacular translation of the first six books of the Old Testament, i.e. the five books of the Torah (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy) and Joshua. It was probably made for use by lay people.Breay & Story, 244-245 The translation is known in seven manuscripts, most of which are fragmentary. The best-known of those is a richly illuminated manuscript in the British Library, Cotton MS Claudius B.iv. Another copy of the text, without lavish illustrations but including a translation of the Book of Judges (hence also called the Old English Heptateuch), is found in Oxford, Bodleian Library, Laud Misc. 509. The whole manuscript is available online at the British Library website.BL Cotton Claudius B.iv, British Library Claudius B.iv. was probably compiled in the second quarter of the 11th century at St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury. It incorporates translations and a preface by √Ülfric of Eynsham, while the remaining parts of the translation were carried out by anonymous authors. Peter Clemoes suggests that Byrhtferth of Ramsey was responsible for the compilation as well as for parts of the translation. With 156 folios, it is largely complete, but does not include all the biblical text of the books. Commentary and other material in Latin and Old English was added in the 12th century,BL often using blank areas in incomplete miniatures. One or, more likely, several artists accompanied the narrative with 394 drawings in inks of various colours, most brightly coloured with washes, containing about 550 scenes. Many of these are unfinished, at varying stages of completion. The settings do not attempt to represent Old Testament life as anything different from that of contemporary Anglo-Saxons, and so give valuable depictions of many aspects of the Anglo-Saxon world. The extensive illustrations suggest that it was designed mainly for lay use.Dodwell (1993), 118-120 It is the earliest illustrated manuscript of a large part of the bible in any vernacular language.Breay & Story, 245 There are twelve full-page miniatures spread through the texts, and the other miniatures range from nearly full-page to about a quarter of a page.BL Many pages have two or even three illustrations, and the majority of pages have a miniature, some of which combine two scenes in bordered compartments. The degree of completion with washes tends to diminish as the book goes on. The colouring has some eccentricities; in particular many figures have blue hair, and the many tents are shown with boldly coloured stripes. Opportunities offered by the text to show groups of animals are usually taken, and the Hand of God frequently appears. The sheet size is , with the text occupying .

Early life Palestine, 1948 Sarraj was born in Hama to a conservative Muslim family, of Kurdish descent.Wilford, p. 255. He joined the Homs Military Academy and was one of the first officers in the army after Syria's independence from France. Sarraj participated in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, as a volunteer in the Arab Liberation Army. He led a detachment of six armored vehicles to surround Safad. Political career He played a role in the 1949 coup that removed Husni al-Zaim from power and took over the personnel department of Adib Shishakli's government in 1952. When Shishakli was ousted, Sarraj was temporarily sent to Paris as an assistant military attache. However, in March 1955, he was appointed head of the Syrian military intelligence. From this position, he was able to play a crucial role in preventing conspiracies against the government. Sarraj did not join any political parties, but cooperated with the ones in power, in particular against the Ba'ath. In September 1957, he helped negotiate the landing of 4,000 Egyptian troops in Latakia as part of defence pact made between the two countries. =Role in the United Arab Republic= Sarraj (right) with UAR President Gamal Abdel Nasser in Latakia, March 1959 When the union between Egypt and Syria was declared, Sarraj, a staunch supporter of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser, was handed a key position in the cabinet as Minister of Interior. His position was elevated when the Syrian gendarmerie, the desert patrol, and the Department of General Security were transferred to his jurisdiction on 13 March 1958. Following the resignation of Ba'ath party ministers from the UAR government, Sarraj was given the additional appointments of Minister of Social Affairs and Minister of Awqaf on 1 January 1960. On 20 September 1960, he was appointed President of the Syrian Executive Council (SEC). Sarraj, at age 35, became the most powerful Syrian official in the UAR. Besides being interior minister and president of the SEC, he also headed the Syrian branch of Nasser's National Union party and was chairman of the Syrian economic foundation established in March 1960. A British official visiting Damascus described him as the \\"Viceroy of Syria\\". However, his use of police methods, which were seen as ruthless, and his considerable power made him unpopular in Syria. Nonetheless, he was known to be an impeccable Arab nationalist who could \\"get things done.\\" Pressure was exerted on Nasser to remove Sarraj from power, but he refused, feeling that there was no one more fit to run Syria on his behalf. Eventually, in August 1961, Nasser decided to appoint him vice president, relocating him to Cairo and thus heralding his downfall as Syria's de facto leader. On 18 September, when Nasser merged the two branches of the National Union, therefore depriving Sarraj of his position as Secretary-General of the Syrian branch and when Egyptian vice president Abdel Hakim Amer dismissed one of his closest associates, Sarraj submitted his resignation. The UAR's state minister, Abdel Qadir Hatem, was sent to mediate between Sarraj and Amer, but failed and the former began mobilizing his forces on 19‚Äì20 September. Realizing an operation against Nasser was unlikely to succeed, he agreed to meet Nasser and Amer in Cairo. Although Nasser condemned Sarraj for his ambition to be sole ruler of Syria, he replaced Amer as Minister of Syrian Affairs with Mahmoud Riad. Resuming his post as Syria's vice president, Sarraj also headed a ministerial committee for UAR administrative reform. However, he suddenly submitted a second resignation on 26 September and Nasser accepted it, sending Amer to replace him. Later life and death Sarraj in 1960 On 28 September 1961, a coup by disaffected officers occurred in Syria, dissolving the UAR. Sarraj was arrested and jailed in the Mezzeh Prison of Damascus.Moubayed, Sami. Soft de-Baathification in Syria . Al-Ahram Weekly. 18 May 2005. He escaped from the prison and left Syria for Beirut, Lebanon. In 1964 the Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party (SSNP) attempted to assassinate Sarraj, prompting his flight to Egypt where he made amends with Nasser. Sarraj lived in Cairo as a private citizen, serving as a director of social security. In 2004 he was reportedly still living in Cairo.Moubayed, p. 326. However, former defence minister Mustafa Tlass had been lobbying the Syrian government for the return of Sarraj to Syria. According to al-Ahram Weekly, he was expected to return in late 2005. Sarraj did not return to Syria and died in Cairo on 23 September 2013. He had requested to be buried in Syria, but due to the unstable security condition of the country amid the civil war, he was buried in Cairo.The Death of Abdul Hamid Sarraj, Vice President of Gamal Abdel Nasser .

It was first broadcast on BBC One in July and August 2009. Region The show focused on a single city, Oxford, which has demographics and crime rates broadly representative of urban Britain, and used a multitude of techniques to measure the real extent of crime and victimisation. In a two-week crime audit, camera teams followed police, fire services and paramedics and an on-line questionnaire, based closely on the national British Crime Survey, invited residents and businesspeople to describe their personal experiences of victimisation. A survey of 14- and 15-year-olds in Oxford schools was one of the biggest of its kind ever undertaken to discover how under-16s are affected by, and involved in, crime. Random children from some of the schools were then chosen to take part in the series being quizzed on crime by Ross on such topics as theft, drugs, alcohol and many other things. Programme 1 The first programme (BBC One 9pm Tuesday 21 July 2009) looked at violent crime and revealed that almost all woundings involved victims who had been drinking or who had been assaulted by someone who was drunk, and took place close to a licensed premise. =Lack of commensuration with official statistics= Most of the seriously injured, as measured by those treated in hospital, did not report what had happened to the police. One senior physician told Nick Ross that police figures on crime are virtually \\"meaningless\\". The physician interviewed was Jonathan Shepherd, a Professor of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the Cardiff University Dental School. Domestic violence was shown to be a major problem, though mostly resulting only in minor injuries, and with women as perpetrators as well as men. Women were interviewed in a Women's shelter. =Crime mapping= Helmet cameras were shown and Spencer Chainey of the Jill Dando Institute at University College London described crime mapping, which uses geographic information systems. =Alcohol-fuelled violence= A licensing officer from Thames Valley Police, a Hook Norton Brewery executive and David Poley, the Chief Executive of the Portman Group, were interviewed. Ross went on to describe several interventions which had cut alcohol-related violence in the UK and elsewhere and urged a more pro-active approach to tackling alcohol-related violence. For most of the incidents, there were few arrests featured. Programme 2 The second in the series (Tuesday 28 July) explored the nature of acquisitive crime and proposed solutions to burglary, car theft and fraud. Ross implied that society needs to accept human nature for what it is and focus less on how to penalise criminals and more on taking sensible precautions with tempting valuables. Temptation and opportunity drives crime far more than \\"badness\\". 90% of burglaries are to fuel a drug habit. A 19-year-old single mother, Kelly, burgled some students, who were meanwhile happily enjoying themselves in a pub, to fund her heroin habit. A policeman said that this type of crime is committed by people who find themselves in social and emotional situations from which they find it difficult to get out of. =Shoplifting= There are around fifty persistent burglars in Oxford. Some of them would commit up to twenty burglaries a week. A shoplifter who was caught by CCTV in a shop, stealing a ¬£10 set of headphones, turned out to be a 19-year-old Polish immigrant who possessed no ID. Nick Ross even confessed to shoplifting occasionally when a teenager, as did school pupils interviewed. During a normal weekday, shoplifting peaks at 3.30pm when school ends. =Distraction burglary and scams= Distraction burglary is different to more common random burglary, and is rarer but often more upsetting because it involves more dedicated and skilful felons. The ruthless individuals perpetrating this crime usually target properties around the edge of Oxford near the ring road, and tend to come from outside the area. Household scams, of a ruthless and targeted similar nature, usually involved elderly people who they would be cajoled into paying astronomical prices for unnecessary repair work done on their property. The rogue traders involved were difficult to trace by county council Trading Standards officers. An elderly couple were conned into paying for minor repairs with their entire life savings. Online scams were more prevalent than perhaps realised, with up to ¬£20bn of online fraud committed a year. It was investigated by the e-commerce unit of SOCA. Richard Cox of The Spamhaus Project was interviewed about internet crime. =Rehabilitation= The police thought that prison was the best place for persistent burglars. It kept the burglars off the streets. Prison was not viewed as a deterrent because the persistent offenders live such types of lives that they would be better looked after in prison than on the streets, with regular meals and companionship. Once they left prison they would quickly reoffend. Rehabilitation centres for repeat offenders and drug addicts were not successful because the offenders were not of a capable mental state to be sufficiently receptive or adaptive to the treatments given =Prevention not cure= Some of the crimes, especially rare ones targeting the elderly, are committed by lifestyle criminals, but most offenders are un- glamorously ordinary and few are \\"ogres\\" even in the eyes of the police. Most solutions lie in better design and sensible precautions. Since crime peaked in the 1990s homeowners have halved burglary rates by locking their doors and windows, retailers and tackled shoplifting by guarding their open shelves with security devices, and vehicle manufacturers have made cars so difficult to steal that auto-crime is now largely confined to old bangers. Programme 3 The third and final show (Tuesday 4 August) exposed widespread anti-social behaviour and the lack of a concerted response. Much of anti-social crime is not added to the official crime statistics. Much of it is fuelled by drugs and gang culture of under-educated and employed young males under the acronym NEET. The Chief Constable of Thames Valley Police, Sara Thornton, was interviewed. It was found that improved styles of architecture for estate housing and lit thoroughfares can reduce anti-social crime significantly. Perspective on crime statistics Ross's general thesis is that recorded crime rates are unreliable, that theft and violence have actually declined sharply but that the downward trend may not be continuing, and that there are hundreds of quite simple solutions to crime, mostly by reducing temptations and opportunities for bad behaviour rather than trying to remould people's predispositions.

It is made of gypsum, it is about 400 m high, and rises from the valley that is formed by the course of the river Caltagirone. Paolo Orsi made a series of excavations here and in 1928 he gained the first important results, discovering archeological finds belonging to the Neolithic and the Copper Age. Along the slope of the valley traces of life have been found; traces of an ancient civilization lived there until the 7th century BC. That is before the arriving of the Greeks, who founded, in that place, a reign including the current territory of Caltagirone with its archeological areas where some pointed ceramic fragments should have been found.  Ancient village and necropolis  thumb thumb An ancient village was discovered on the lowest part of the slope, in the east side of the hill. A necropolis, with about 20 tombs called ‚Äúa forno‚Äù, dug on the slope opposite the village, was also found. The necropolis was opposite the little river that flowed through the terrace where the liuts were built, and it dates back to the 13th century BC.  The village during the ‚ÄúCopper Age‚Äù  The village of luits, dated back to ‚Äúthe Copper Age‚Äù, was discovered on the top of the hill, although some fragments belonged to the culture of Stentinello, proving that the area was also inhabited during the previous age. The so-called ‚Äúfacies‚Äù of S. Ippolito, generally indicates the type of culture of this phase, which is dated back 2000 to 1800 BC, and that is characterized by deep relationships with the Aegean-Anatolic civilizations.  Monte San Mauro = Colli n¬∞ 1 - n¬∞ 2 = thumb S. Mauro is an archeological place, and it is formed by three necropolis, a built-up area, some holy wells which have disappeared today. The most significant archeological find is a set of architectonic earthenware fragments that are well painted. It is possible to compare these fragments to others found in the cities of Gela, Syracuse, Selinunte and Olimpia in Greece. All these finds are dated back the end of the 16th century BC. Other fragments of ‚Äúpalmette‚Äù and of kalypteres egemones have been found recently. Moreover, it is important to mention that Paolo Orsi found a votive place made up of female votive statues. thumb = Colle n¬∞ 3 = During the first explorations, Paolo Orsi could identify a system of defensive walls spaced at intervals by projections of rock along the northwest edge of the hill. Houses have been uncovered. Their quadrangular plan divided in a big rectangular space opened to world the outside and generally turned to the South; on this space there are other two square rooms, smaller than the rectangular one, that often have an added storey. This has been discovered thanks to the observations and research that archeologists have done. The presence of big pithoi (see below) to store large quantities of food, is very interesting. In 1994, Paolo Orsi discovered a building with a rectangular plan, that was divided in two parts by a wall made with blocks of stone of that area which were linked together with heap of stones and soil. These digs were continued by U. Spigo in 1983 and they revealed that next to the west side of the building existed another space, and near it there also was an added storey with a long footpath. This room was characterized by the presence of many ceramic fragments of vases and plates used for food, and by fusaroles and handlooms. thumb  Necropolis  At the foot of the hill n¬∞ 3, in 1903-1904, a necropolis of the 7th and 6th centuries BC was dug. Some 58 graves were discovered and most of them had already been plundered by the local peasants. The type of burial was that of the ‚ÄúCappucina‚Äù* with the coffin covered with slabs. It was called ‚Äúsimple grave‚Äù.  La Cappuccina  The Cappuccina was a simple way of burial without cremation or with a partial cremation and was used during the Roman Age and the Medieval period; the dead was placed in a grave dug in tophus and then he/she was covered with tiles. Sometimes the tiles were simply put to close the grave at ground level with curved tiles placed laterally put between the tiles and the ground; sometimes the tiles were placed in a pitched way in the grave (like a tent); they were placed on the shorter side, with the lateral edges up, put closer together; on the edges the bodies were placed and other tiles were used to cover the upper corner of the tiles; finally all was covered by the soil that filled the grave.  Pithoi  Pithoi were very large earthenware containers used for storage in ancient times. They held liquids such as wine and oil, and also solids in granular form such as salt.

The Dos Leyendas show took place on March 20, 2009 in CMLL's main venue, Arena M√©xico, Mexico City, Mexico. The event was to honor and remember CMLL founder Salvador Lutteroth, who died in March 1987. Starting in 1999 CMLL honored not just their founder during the show, but also a second lucha libre legend, making it their version of a Hall of Fame event. For the 2009 show CMLL commemorated the life and career of wrestler Cavernario Galindo. This was the 11th March show held under the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas name, having previously been known as Homenaje a Salvador Lutteroth from 1996 to 1998. The headliner match of the 2009 Dos Leyendas show was a Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", where both wrestlers put their mask on the line. √öltimo Guerrero defeated Villano V, two falls to one, to win the match. Afterwards Villano V unmasked and revealed his birth name, Raymundo D√≠az Mendoza Jr. In the semi-main event Negro Casas defeated M√≠stico to win the CMLL World Welterweight Championship. The event featured four additional six-man tag team matches, including a Mini-Estrellas match. Production=Background= Since 1996 the Mexican wrestling company Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (Spanish for \\"World Wrestling Council\\"; CMLL) has held a show in March each year to commemorate the passing of CMLL founder Salvador Lutteroth who died in March 1987. For the first three years the show paid homage to Lutteroth himself, from 1999 through 2004 the show paid homage to Lutteroth and El Santo, Mexico's most famous wrestler ever and from 2005 forward the show has paid homage to Lutteroth and a different leyenda (\\"Legend\\") each year, celebrating the career and accomplishments of past CMLL stars. Originally billed as Homenaje a Salvador Lutteroth, it has been held under the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas (\\"Homage to two legends\\") since 1999 and is the only show outside of CMLL's Anniversary shows that CMLL has presented every year since its inception. All Homenaje a Dos Leyendas shows have been held in Arena M√©xico in Mexico City, Mexico which is CMLL's main venue, its \\"home\\". Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, which means the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas shows replace their regularly scheduled Super Viernes show. The 2009 show was the 14th overall Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show. =Storylines= The Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. =Homage to Salvador Lutteroth and Cavernario Galindo= In September 1933 Salvador Lutteroth Gonz√°lez founded Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL), which would later be renamed Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre. Over time Lutteroth would become responsible for building both Arena Coliseo in Mexico City and Arena Mexico, which became known as \\"The Cathedral of Lucha Libre\\". Over time EMLL became the oldest wrestling promotion in the world, with 2018 marking the 85th year of its existence. Lutteroth has often been credited with being the \\"father of Lucha Libre\\", introducing the concept of masked wrestlers to Mexico as well as the Luchas de Apuestas match. Lutteroth died on September 5, 1987. EMLL, late CMLL, remained under the ownership and control of the Lutteroth family as first Salvador's son Chavo Lutteroth and later his grandson Paco Alonso took over ownership of the company. The life and achievements of Salvador Lutteroth is always honored at the annual Homenaje a Dos Leyenda' show and since 1999 CMLL has also honored a second person, a Leyenda of lucha libre, in some ways CMLL's version of their Hall of Fame. For the 2009 show CMLL commemorated the life and career of Rodolfo Galindo Ramirez, known under the ring name Cavernario Galindo (Spanish for \\"Caveman Galindo\\"). Galindo was active from 1938 until the 1990s, when he was in his seventies. Cavernario was known for his wild, brawling wrestling style that often saw him or his opponent, or both, bleeding at the end of a match. His long running storyline feud with Gory Guerrero featured several blood soaked brawls. He won the Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship and was inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in the Class of 1996.

It was opened on 1 November 1876 with the rest of the line and remained open for 83 years, it closed in 1959. The sidings and passing loop remained open until late 1961 to serve the Tinplate Works in the village.B. M. Handley and R. Dingwall, The Wye Valley Railway and the Coleford Branch, 1982, History The station was opened in 1876 as one of the four stopping places on the line, the others were Tidenham Station, Tintern Station and St. Briavels Station. The station complex consisted of a platform, station building, goods shed, signal box, passing loop and sidings; the signal box controlled the loop and sidings. The signal box was only used when needed as the sidings were only occasionally used. Throughout its life, the station won many awards for its flowers and decorations, its climbing roses especially. The staff were often in competition with Tintern Station to be the best kept station on the line. Nine years after the stations opening, a new company re-opened the old Tinplate Works. The Shareholders of the railway were informed that the new tinplate company would provide a reliable source of income. The Tinplate Works managed to produce a steady amount until it finally closed in 1961. The railway was completely demolished soon afterwards to make room for a restaurant. However, Penallt Viaduct, which led up to the station is still standing, it now carries a public footpath over the Wye.

Biography Chen Long-bin was born in 1964 in Taipei, Taiwan. He received a BFA from the Fine Arts Department at Tunghai University, and an MFA from the School of Visual Arts in New York. He is known for using the cultural debris of our modern society, such as old, discarded books, newspapers, phonebooks, and magazines as the medium for his sculptures. Chen is self-taught in carving wood, but started showing interest in our paper culture as a viable material for art ‚Äì phonebooks, magazines, and computer paper when PC‚Äôs began growing popular in 1993. The advent of the personal computer changed the entire nature of information documentation ‚Äì a role books used to play. Thus, by turning paper into the original wood for his sculptures, Chen offers renewed value to the meaning of paper. He uses chainsaws, drills, band saws, sanders, and scissors, along with other carpenter's tools to shape his remarkable busts and figures, which appear stone, or even marble like from a distance.Engel, Bonnie: [Paper, Scissors, Stone] Hong Kong Tatler Chen who has won prizes in Europe, Taipei, and Japan, has exhibited extensively at galleries and museums for many years in Japan, Korea, France, (Germany), Hong Kong, Italy, London, Singapore, Taiwan, and the United States, and can also be found in numerous international public and private collections. He has been awarded artist fellowship grants from Taiwan's National Endowment for the Arts, the Joan Mitchell Foundation in New York and the Freeman Foundation. In 1995, he received the Visitor's Prize of the Sixth Triennial of Small Scale Sculpture in Stuttgart, Germany. And in 1998, he received the Silver Prize at the Osaka Triennial in Japan.\\"Long ‚Äì Bin Chen Reading Sculpture\\" Frederieke Taylor Gallery For Chen, using recycled materials to make art stresses the challenges presented by endless human consumption and waste, as well as the tantamount ecological problems of waste accumulation and disposal, the destruction of forests, and the mindless use of nonrenewable resources. The reams of used computer paper disprove the assurance of the electronic paper-less office, which instead augments the use of paper, as printing is made much easier. Furthermore, his choice of medium also poses as a commentary on the loss of books as aesthetic objects, which have been replaced by mass-produced cheaply made paperbacks. Books are extremely important to Chen. However, it is not the book itself, but its educational heritage, literary importance, historical knowledge, and the sacredness of the written word that he treasures most. The type of materials he acquires in a sense determines the sculpture he creates. While in New York, he scoured the streets of Manhattan collecting discarded refuse, scouted offices for their rejected reams of paper, visited brownstone streets to gather cast off telephone books when new ones were distributed. And now, living in Taipei, Chen obtains his material from university libraries and bookstores, publishing companies, archeological museums, and telephone companies. The special quality of Chen's works is that people can still read the pages. ‚ÄúI try to make sculptures that are appropriate for the content of the books. In my concept, the form and content is united together; the content gives me the idea of the form. Yellow Pages give me one kind of idea; books discarded from libraries inspire different styles‚Ä¶\\" Often, his art reflects the content of the pages within, such as one hanging installation featuring spirals of books with peepholes in which one can view a scene from the story within the original pages.\\"Painting With Paper: The Magic of Long-Bin Chen\\" Solo exhibitions ‚Ä¢ Continental Express, Frederieke Taylor Gallery, New York, 2008 ‚Ä¢ Chen Long-Bin: Reading Sculpture ‚Äì Culture Warrior, Plum Blossoms Gallery, Hong Kong, 2006 ‚Ä¢ Buddha Hurricane, Frederieke Taylor Gallery, 2006 ‚Ä¢ Reading Sculpture-Los Angeles project, The Lowe Gallery, Santa Monica, CA, 2005 ‚Ä¢ Reading Sculpture-Kids project, Kidspace at MassMoca, North Adams, MA, 2004 ‚Ä¢ Reading Sculpture-Atlanta project, The Lowe Gallery, Atlanta, GA, 2004 ‚Ä¢ Reading Sculpture-Roma project, Galleria Ca'a d'Oro, Rome, Italy, 2004 ‚Ä¢ Reading Sculpture-Milan project, Galleria Ca'a d'Oro, Milan, Italy, 2004 ‚Ä¢ Reading Sculpture-Vermont project, Vermont Studio Center, VT, 2004 ‚Ä¢ Reading Sculpture, Frederieke Taylor Gallery, 2003 ‚Ä¢ Alternative Study, Eslite Bookstore, Taiwan, 1999 ‚Ä¢ Taiwan Study, Cultural Affairs Department of Taiwan Provincial Government, Taiwan, 1998 ‚Ä¢ Humanity, Taipei Fine Arts Museum, Taipei, Taiwan, 1997 ‚Ä¢ Reading Sculpture, Eight Floor Gallery, New York, 1995 ‚Ä¢ Culture Empire, American Institute in Taiwan, Taipei, Taiwan, 1994 ‚Ä¢ Tools, Space 2 Gallery, Taipei, Taiwan, 1992 Group exhibitions ‚Ä¢ Rebound, Halsey Gallery, College of Charleston, SC, 2013 ‚Ä¢ Transformation: From ordinary to extraordinary, various Museums across U.S.A and one in Israel, Curate By Barbara J.

Early life and education She was born as Anne Levy on February 10, 1930, in Manhattan, the daughter of Leon R. Levy, a prominent architect who designed the New York Coliseum. Her first involvement in politics was ringing doorbells for Harry S. Truman as a history major at Skidmore College. She married ophthalmologist Richard Wexler two weeks after her 1951 graduation. As a housewife in Westport, Connecticut, she described herself as having \\"all the Jewish princess stuff ‚Äî a lovely home, a full-time maid, lots of vacations\\" before she started becoming involved in politics.Martin, Douglas. \\"Anne Wexler, an Influential Political Operative and Lobbyist, Is Dead at 79\\", The New York Times, August 8, 2009. Accessed August 8, 2009. Political career In the 60s, Wexler began her political career by serving on the Westport Zoning Board of Appeals and by helping John Fitzgerald organize a Congressional campaign against the pro-Vietnam war Democrat incumbent Donald J. Irwin. She organized the Connecticut effort for Eugene McCarthy's 1968 presidential campaign, and served on the rules committee at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where she was the primary author of the committee's minority report, whose recommendations on reforms in choosing delegates were later accepted. She managed the 1970 United States Senate campaign in Connecticut for Democrat Joseph Duffey, a Democrat who came in second to Republican Lowell P. Weicker, Jr., with incumbent Thomas J. Dodd coming in third. Bill and Hillary Clinton, then students at Yale Law School, were recruited among the campaign's volunteer workers. (Mrs. Clinton, while running for President in 2008, credited Wexler with providing her first political job.) After a divorce from her first husband, in September 1974, Wexler married Duffey, who would later head the National Endowment for the Humanities and the United States Information Agency. Working for Common Cause in 1971, Wexler headed a short- lived voting rights effort before directing the 1972 presidential campaign of Democrat Edmund Muskie. When Muskie dropped out of the race, she led a voter registration campaign for Democratic nominee George McGovern, who was defeated by Richard Nixon in the general election. Rolling Stone magazine hired Wexler as an associate publisher in 1973, where her duties managing political reporting included overseeing the notoriously unconventional Gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson, who would sometimes stay at the Duffey-Wexler residence while in Washington, D.C. =Carter Administration= During the 1976 Presidential Election, Wexler worked for the Jimmy Carter campaign and served on his transition team after Carter's victory over Gerald Ford. Being responsible for screening candidates for top-level positions, she recommended the little-known Juanita M. Kreps as the first woman to become United States Secretary of Commerce. Wexler herself then became Undersecretary of the Department of Commerce. Wexler later moved to the White House, succeeding Midge Costanza as Special Assistant to President Carter for Public Outreach within the White House Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs. In that role, she set up meetings with the President with hundreds of business and opinion leaders, working to get their support for Carter's agenda as part of an effort she described as intended to \\"create lobbyists\\" by \\" educating people on the substance of the issues\\". Assisted by her efforts, Carter was able to secure passage of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties that would lead to the end of U.S. control over the Panama Canal, as well as deregulation of the airlines, trucking industry and newly found natural gas. Carter's White House Chief of Staff Hamilton Jordan described her in 1978 as \\"the most competent woman in Democratic politics in this country\\". Lobbying Immediately after the Carter Administration ended with the election of Ronald Reagan to the Presidency in 1980, Wexler established what would become one of the leading lobbying firms in Washington, Wexler & Walker Public Policy Associates, Described by The Washington Post as \\"the first woman to own a lobbying firm\\", she later recalled her entry into a field that \\"was completely male dominated\\".Weil, Martin. \\"Anne Wexler, Political Adviser and Lobbyist, Dies at 79\\", The Washington Post, August 8, 2009.

She ensured that the firm had a bipartisan base, bringing in Ronald Reagan friend Nancy Clark Reynolds and hired former Republican Congressman (and Newt Gingrich ally) Robert Smith Walker of Pennsylvania after he left office in 1997. The firm's clients included General Motors and the Government of Australia, which honored her as an Officer of the Order of Australia for her meritorious service. Her firm was acquired by Hill & Knowlton in 1990, within which it operated independently. Called the \\"Rolodex Queen\\" for the number and scope of her contacts, and lauded by Washingtonian magazine as \\"easily the most influential female lobbyist\\" in the capital, she credited her success to fulfilling the lobbyist's responsibility of guiding legislators through the pros and cons of complex legislation, a process that \\"government officials are not comfortable making... by themselves.\\"Staff. \\"Peddling Influence\\", Time (magazine), March 3, 1986.

Hamsun's eulogy to Hitler served as the collaborationist newspaper's feature article on Hitler's death. The obituary came to be his most infamous written piece.  The obituary The short obituary reads in its entirety: Adolf Hitler I'm not worthy to speak up for Adolf Hitler, and to any sentimental rousing his life and deeds do not invite. Hitler was a warrior, a warrior for humankind and a preacher of the gospel of justice for all nations. He was a reforming character of the highest order, and his historical fate was that he functioned in a time of unequaled brutality, which in the end failed him. Thus may the ordinary Western European look at Adolf Hitler. And we, his close followers, bow our heads at his death. Knut Hamsun Background Knut Hamsun has been described as anti-British and pro-German, and as sympathizing with the Nazi cause. He openly supported, but even though Nasjonal Samling eventually formed a government controlled by the German Reichskommissar after the war broke out, it is clear to historians he was never actually a self-enrolled party member (in a civil lawsuit, he was found to have been a member under dissent from the professional judge, during the legal purge in Norway after World War II). Hamsun never signed up for any membership in the NS, although NS included him. Nonetheless, Hamsun was an opponent of the Reichskommissar Josef Terboven, and in 1943 he unsuccessfully appealed to Adolf Hitler in person to remove Terboven from office. Publication and reception The obituary was published on the evening of 7 May 1945, one week after Hitler's death. Parts of the rather short obituary soon became infamous: Hamsun referred to Hitler as \\"a warrior for humankind and a preacher of the gospel of justice for all nations\\" and \\"a reformer of the highest order\\". The obituary is often cited as a pivotal point in Hamsun's expression of his own political views, severely affecting the reception of his complete body of works. Writings such as these rose somewhat in importance due to the fact that the praised novelist Hamsun had not released a work of fiction since 1936's The Ring is Closed. Biographer Ingar Sletten Kolloen has referred to the obituary as one of \\"four mortal sins\\" committed by Hamsun which came to erode his position in Norwegian post- war society. On the other hand, J√∏rgen Haugan at the University of Copenhagen has stated regret that Hamsun's wrongdoings, among others the obituary of Hitler, had not overshadowed his literary qualities to what Haugan deems to be a sufficient degree. For Hamsun himself, the obituary and other statements and writings led to his arrest soon after the war's end. However, the charges against him were softened as professor Gabriel Langfeldt and chief physician √òrnulv √òdeg√•rd found him to have \\"permanently impaired mental abilities\\". In 1949, in his 90th year, Hamsun issued a biographical account of his life, including a discussion of the occupation in Norway, in the book On Overgrown Paths. He died in 1952. Professor Atle Kittang at the University of Bergen wrote on \\"Hamsun's legacy\\" at the web-site of the Knut Hamsun Centre. He stated there was a \\"complex set of reasons\\" behind Hamsun's \\"act\\" of publishing the obituary. He notes that, after their single meeting in 1943, Hitler did not \\"rank very high in [Hamsun's] evalutation\\". Accordingly, Kittang believes one should consider the obituary as part of Hamsun's \\"need to provoke\\", which is demonstrated by his life and work.

These provided the city's large Czech population with instruction in Czech.  Habsburg Monarchy  The first Czech primary school with attached kindergarten was opened in the Quellenstra√üe in Favoriten in 1883. In 1908, a technical college was also founded; it was felt that the need for this was more pressing than for a grammar school. The Komensk√Ω association, which was responsible for these schools, struggled to obtain public status for these institutions, which would have entitled them to state funding. Although the Dezemberverfassung laws of 21 December 1867 granted every \\"nationality\\" linguistic equality and thus the right to public schooling in its language, Vienna's mayor Karl Lueger feared that the city risked becoming increasing dominated by Slavs (it is estimated that as many as 500,000 Czechs lived in the city, which had a total population of 1.6 million). The Lower Austrian parliament, which was also responsible for Vienna at the time, ruled from 1896 onward that German should be the only language of instruction in all state schools.Michael John, Albert Lichtblau: Schmelztiegel Wien ‚Äì Einst und jetzt, B√∂hlau Verlag Gesellschaft m.b.H und Co.KG, Wien, , page 278 At first, the pupils in the Komensk√Ω association's private schools were even required to travel to B≈ôeclav to take their final exams. It was not until 1908 that education minister Gustav Marchet resolved that Czech teachers could also hold these exams in Vienna. The city council criticised this as a serious attack on the German school system and Vienna's German character.M. John, A. Lichtblau: Schmelztiegel Wien ‚Äì Einst und jetzt, page 278 Lueger's successor, Josef Neumayer, from the Christian Social Party, ordered the closure of a newly established Komensk√Ω school in the Sch√ºtzengasse on 23 September 1911. This act provoked not just a critical response in other parts of the empire, but also led to anti-Czech protests by German nationalists and members of the Christian Social Party. The largest rally attracted some 5000 people to a demonstration against Vienna's Czechs. During World War I, the Komensk√Ω association offered to let the City of Vienna use the school buildings as a lazaret. The buildings had been kept closed by the authorities, allegedly because of their poor construction, but the City accepted the association's offer.Franz Pesendorfer (ed.), Karl und Marta Brousek: Wiener Impressionen ‚Äì Auf den Spuren tschechischer Geschichte in Wien / V√≠de≈àsk√© imprese ‚Äì po ƒçesk√Ωch stop√°ch dƒõj√≠n Vidnƒõ, Verband Wiener Volksbildung ‚Äì Edition Volkshochschule, Wien 2003, , page 83  First Republic  The former Komensk√Ω school in the Erlgasse (in Meidling) The Treaty of Saint-Germain included provisions requiring the protection of minority rights in education. The Br√ºnner Vertrag between Austria and Czechoslovakia, which also concerned the school system, was signed on 7 June 1920. The realisation of the obligation to provide public schools for Vienna's Czech children was problematic. Czechs complained that the city's bilingual schools (which offered separate German and Czech instruction at different times during the day) required their children to attend in the afternoon, and that there were twice as many children in each classroom in the afternoon as during the German instruction in the morning. The government ban on teaching German at public Czech schools led many children to attend the Komensk√Ω schools.M. John, A. Lichtblau: Schmelztiegel Wien ‚Äì Einst und jetzt, page 279 In response to the lack of space made available in public schools, the Komensk√Ω association built the Krofta-Schule, which included a kindergarten, high school and technical college in the Herbststra√üe in Ottakring in 1923/24. This was made possible thanks to financial support from the association's backers in Prague. In 1933, the Komensk√Ω association had 35 schools and kindergartens in Vienna: * 17 Kindergartens * 6 Primary schools * 6 High schools * 1 Technical grammar school * 1 Technical college * 1 Business school * 1 School for women's professions * 2 Slovak language schools The Komensk√Ω association and its educational institutions were not directly touched by the Austrian Civil War, because they were not aligned to the Social Democrats. All school staff were however required to join the Vaterl√§ndische Front (Patriotic Front). In 1935, the technical grammar school relocated to a new site at the Sebastianplatz, while a new kindergarten was opened in Inzersdorf.Karl Maria Brousek: Wien und seine Tschechen ‚Äì Integration und Assimilation einer Minderheit im 20. Jahrhundert, Wien 1980, Verlag f√ºr Geschichte und Politik Wien  1938‚Äì1945  By 1938, the Komensk√Ω association was not only one of Vienna's Czechs‚Äô most important organisations; it was also one of the wealthiest. The association owned, in addition to its financial wealth, numerous school buildings and properties, the largest Czech library in Vienna (which had 70,000‚Äì100,000 books), two school busses as well as educational materials. Following the Anschluss, the new authorities decreed that all non-Aryan state employees should be made redundant. This also affected the Komensk√Ω association's teachers. Following the Munich Agreement, the situation became more dire; the association's schools could only re-open fully in October 1938. As none of the Komensk√Ω association's representatives was an ethnic German and a member of the NSDAP, its employees were not approved by the authorities. In order to maintain public funding for its schools, the association was forced to accept the imposition of German school principals and ethnic German teachers for German lessons in 1939/40. From May 1941, all state funding was cancelled, and the schools lost their public status after the 1940/41 academic year. The Komensk√Ω association's most important source of income during this time was the rent that it earned from its buildings. School authorities and the army were prompt payers, but NSDAP offices refused to pay rent to the association. On 18 February 1942, representatives of the association were called to the Gestapo headquarters at the Morzinplatz in central Vienna and were informed that their association was being dissolved.K. M. Brousek: Wien und seine Tschechen ‚Äì Integration und Assimilation einer Minderheit im 20. Jahrhundert The association's buildings and properties in and around Vienna were confiscated.Eduard Kubu und Gudrun Exner: Tschechen und Tschechinnen, Verm√∂gensentzug und Restitution, Oldenbourg Verlag Wien M√ºnchen, 2004, , page 59  Second Republic  The Komensk√Ω school in the Sch√ºtzengasse, number 31 The last two public Czech primary schools to be maintained by the city of Vienna were closed before the end of the war in 1945 and were not later reopened. The last Czech grammar school pupils completed their schooling shortly after the war. The majority of the Komensk√Ω association's wealth ‚Äì which the Nazis had invested ‚Äì as well as its buildings and properties were returned by the Republic of Austria after the war. As a result of large-scale Czech emigration from Vienna during and after the war, the Komensk√Ω association's activities were greatly reduced. It was operating only three schools in 1949: a high school at the Sebastianplatz, and primary schools in the Vorgartenstra√üe and the Herbststra√üe. The Komensk√Ω association sold the majority of its buildings between 1960 and 1980. They were bought by private individuals, firms, the Republic of Austria, the city of Vienna dn other public organisations.E. Kubu, G. Exner: Tschechen und Tschechinnen, Verm√∂gensentzug und Restitution Only the school at the Sebastianplatz continued to offer lessons. The school was financed at first by the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic; since 1980, the teachers have been paid by the Republic of Austria. The Komensk√Ω association has once again been using a building in the Sch√ºtzengasse for educational purposes; it houses a bilingual Oberstufenrealgymnasium, which began life in the 2000/01 academic year at the Sebastianplatz. The school offers the 9th to 12th forms and has a total of approximately 80 pupils.orgkomensky.at privates Oberstufenrealgymnasium Komensky, accessed 28 July 2009 In 2004, pupils took their high school leaver's exams at a Komensk√Ω school for the first time since 1942.schulverein- komensky.schulweb.at, accessed 28 July 2009  References  See also  * Czechs in Austria * Czechs in Vienna (de) 20th century in Vienna Schools in Vienna Czechs in Vienna de:Tschechen in Wien#Schulen ","title":"Czech schools in Vienna"},{"id":"23773137","text":"Fitzherbert Park is a cricket ground in Palmerston North in New Zealand, a home ground of the Central Districts.

Biography Mario Levi was born in 1957 in Istanbul. He graduated from Saint Michel High School in 1975, from Istanbul University the Faculty of Literature French Language and Literature Department in 1980. His first articles were published in the newspaper \\"≈ûalom\\". These were followed by his other articles in the publication organs like \\"Cumhuriyet\\", \\"Studyo Imge\\", \\"Milliyet Sanat\\", \\"Gosteri\\", \\"Argos\\", \\"Gergedan\\", \\"Varlik\\". His first published book was \\"Jacques Brel: A Lonely Man\\" (1986). This book is a novelized version of his university graduation thesis. His first book of short stories, \\"Not Being Able to Go to a City\\" was published in 1990. These autobiographical stories are an account of the writer with both his loves, his childhood and preteen years. The book won the Haldun Taner Story Prize of the year. His second book of short stories, \\"Madame Floridis May Not Return\\" published in 1991, includes people in Istanbul who are having difficulty in adapting to their own minority group and to society. In 1992, his first novel, \\"Our Best Love Story,\\" was published. Then a long silence took place. His 800-page novel, \\"Istanbul Was a Fairy Tale\\", published in 1999, is the story of a Jewish family who lived in Istanbul between the 1920s and 1980s. The heroes of the other minorities in the city are also seen in this novel. Mario Levi, in addition to being a writer, has also been a French teacher, an importer, a journalist, a radio programmer and a copywriter. He is still giving lectures at Yeditepe University. He also teaches creative writing to the people who have set their hearts on trying to express their thoughts. Levi's latest novel \\"Where Were You When Darkness Fell?\\" was published in January 2009, which has received very good reviews.

The blue population is much more dispersed than the red population. In statistics, dispersion (also called variability, scatter, or spread) is the extent to which a distribution is stretched or squeezed. Common examples of measures of statistical dispersion are the variance, standard deviation, and interquartile range. Dispersion is contrasted with location or central tendency, and together they are the most used properties of distributions. Measures A measure of statistical dispersion is a nonnegative real number that is zero if all the data are the same and increases as the data become more diverse. Most measures of dispersion have the same units as the quantity being measured. In other words, if the measurements are in metres or seconds, so is the measure of dispersion. Examples of dispersion measures include: * Standard deviation * Interquartile range (IQR) * Range * Mean absolute difference (also known as Gini mean absolute difference) * Median absolute deviation (MAD) * Average absolute deviation (or simply called average deviation) * Distance standard deviation These are frequently used (together with scale factors) as estimators of scale parameters, in which capacity they are called estimates of scale. Robust measures of scale are those unaffected by a small number of outliers, and include the IQR and MAD. All the above measures of statistical dispersion have the useful property that they are location-invariant and linear in scale. This means that if a random variable X has a dispersion of SX then a linear transformation Y = aX + b for real a and b should have dispersion SY = aSX, where a is the absolute value of a, that is, ignores a preceding negative sign ‚Äì. Other measures of dispersion are dimensionless. In other words, they have no units even if the variable itself has units. These include: * Coefficient of variation * Quartile coefficient of dispersion * Relative mean difference, equal to twice the Gini coefficient * Entropy: While the entropy of a discrete variable is location-invariant and scale-independent, and therefore not a measure of dispersion in the above sense, the entropy of a continuous variable is location invariant and additive in scale: If Hz is the entropy of continuous variable z and y=ax+b, then Hy=Hx+log(a). There are other measures of dispersion: * Variance (the square of the standard deviation) ‚Äì location-invariant but not linear in scale. * Variance-to-mean ratio ‚Äì mostly used for count data when the term coefficient of dispersion is used and when this ratio is dimensionless, as count data are themselves dimensionless, not otherwise. Some measures of dispersion have specialized purposes, among them the Allan variance and the Hadamard variance. For categorical variables, it is less common to measure dispersion by a single number; see qualitative variation. One measure that does so is the discrete entropy. Sources In the physical sciences, such variability may result from random measurement errors: instrument measurements are often not perfectly precise, i.e., reproducible, and there is additional inter-rater variability in interpreting and reporting the measured results. One may assume that the quantity being measured is stable, and that the variation between measurements is due to observational error. A system of a large number of particles is characterized by the mean values of a relatively few number of macroscopic quantities such as temperature, energy, and density. The standard deviation is an important measure in fluctuation theory, which explains many physical phenomena, including why the sky is blue. In the biological sciences, the quantity being measured is seldom unchanging and stable, and the variation observed might additionally be intrinsic to the phenomenon: It may be due to inter-individual variability, that is, distinct members of a population differing from each other. Also, it may be due to intra-individual variability, that is, one and the same subject differing in tests taken at different times or in other differing conditions. Such types of variability are also seen in the arena of manufactured products; even there, the meticulous scientist finds variation. In economics, finance, and other disciplines, regression analysis attempts to explain the dispersion of a dependent variable, generally measured by its variance, using one or more independent variables each of which itself has positive dispersion. The fraction of variance explained is called the coefficient of determination. A partial ordering of dispersion A mean-preserving spread (MPS) is a change from one probability distribution A to another probability distribution B, where B is formed by spreading out one or more portions of A's probability density function while leaving the mean (the expected value) unchanged. The concept of a mean-preserving spread provides a partial ordering of probability distributions according to their dispersions: of two probability distributions, one may be ranked as having more dispersion than the other, or alternatively neither may be ranked as having more dispersion.

It was released in Australia on August 20, 2009 after being screened at numerous film festivals including Sundance, Zurich, Silverdocs and Sheffield Doc/Fest. The movie was released in American theaters on August 28, 2009. Plot The film revolves around the making of the Vogue September 2007 issue. (The September Vogue is traditionally the biggest, most important issue of the year.) It depicts the effort that goes into making the magazine, and the passion that Grace Coddington, a former model turned creative director and the only person who dares to stand up to Anna Wintour, has for the highly regarded fashion magazine. In the film, Coddington is often portrayed as the leading victim to Wintour's aggressive personality.

Biography Born in 1927 in Turin, Italy di Suvero grew up in China where his father had been stationed in the Italian Diplomatic Service. He came to San Francisco early in 1941 with his family as anti-fascist political refugees. He attended the University of Santa Clara and then, wanting to do something to help in the war effort and being too young for the armed forces, he shipped out as a Merchant Seaman at the age of 16 sailing as an able-bodied seaman in the Pacific. He saw service from Guadalcanal to New Guinea and from Bia to Leyte. At the end of the War he returned to California and attended the University of California, Berkeley where he received his BA in Political Science in 1949. At Berkeley he had been the editor of the Occident, the literary magazine of the University and won the Ina Coolbrith Prize for Poetry in that year. While at the University of California in Berkeley, di Suvero developed a catering service to support himself which later evolved into a series of restaurants which he sold before moving to Sausalito, California where he bought and ran the Contemporary Gallery giving shows to artists such as Wayne Thiebaud and Jean Varda. The development of the gallery led to his establishment of Design and Color Service in 1951 providing art and design advisory services to architects and real estate developers such as Eichler homes, The Draper Companies, and Conway and Culligan in the Bay Area. This exposure soon led him to obtain his own Real Estate License and he then established di Suvero & Company, a Real Estate and Mortgage brokerage firm which he managed developing projects in Hawaii and Arizona as well as in California. The various financing contacts di Suvero had developed for his real estate business gave him the opportunity to extend his management and funding practice into a succession of mining ventures. He became a principal in Standard Coal Co., developing mines in Tennessee and West Virginia. Subsequently he established Sapphire Trading Company which reopened the Yogo Sapphire Mine in Montana and the Noble Metals Mine Operation in Southern California and Nevada. In 1999 he established Liberty Resources, LLC which currently controls two mining operations in Nevada and one in California. During this entire period di Suvero continued with his writings. He edited ¬°Saludos!, the first bilingual collection of the poetry of New Mexico, all published by Pennywhistle Press which he established in 1986. Spring Again was awarded the Independent Publisher‚Äôs Association Bronze Medal in 2007. As a poetry activist he served as a Director of the National Poetry Association for four years establishing National Poetry Week in San Francisco in 1987 which now has become National Poetry Month sponsored by the Academy of American Poets among other sponsors, and is now celebrated across the United States. After moving to New Mexico in 1988, di Suvero became one of the founders of PEN New Mexico and of the New Mexico Book Association. Di Suvero continues living a life in Poetry among his other interests. These include his ongoing work as Project Director for the National Institute for Change, for the American Immigrant Foundation and as the principal and sole Managing Member of Liberty Resources, LLC His latest publication, We Came To Santa Fe, is a charming collection of stories, poems and photographs by many who came to visit Santa Fe, New Mexico and stayed.

It can be abated when lying down. Camptocormia, also known as bent spine syndrome (BSS), is a symptom of a multitude of diseases that is most commonly seen in the elderly. It is identified by an abnormal thoracolumbar spinal flexion, which is a forward bending of the lower joints of the spine, occurring in a standing position. In order to be classified as BSS, the anterior flexion (the lower back bending) must be of 45 degrees anteriorly. This classification differentiates it from a similar syndrome known as kyphosis. Although camptocormia is a symptom of many diseases, there are two common origins: neurological and muscular. Camptocormia is treated by alleviating the underlying condition causing it through therapeutic measures or lifestyle changes.  History and society  227x227px Camptocormia comes from two Greek words, meaning \\"to bend\\" (Œ∫Œ¨ŒºœÄœÑœâ, kampt≈ç) and \\"trunk\\" (Œ∫œåœÅŒºŒøœÇ, kormos), and was coined by Alexandre-Achille Souques and B. Rosanoff-Saloff. These two men also created the definition of the disease that is widely accepted today. When the disorder was first clinically studied around the time of First World War, it was believed to be a psychogenic conversion disorder that resulted from the severe trauma of war. Souques and others treated patients with psychological therapy and early versions of electrotherapy. Samuel A. Sandler used a similar approach to treat soldiers during the Second World War. The view of BSS as a conversion disorder led to a lack of awareness about the conditions and few diagnoses by physicians. As time progressed and advances were made in knowledge of neuroscience and physiology, biological mechanisms behind the irregular bending were identified. The current medically preferred term for the condition is bent spine syndrome, because of the psychological origin associated with camptocormia. = Camptocormia in the elderly = BSS is not limited to the elderly but has an average age of onset of 66 years and is more common amongst men. This late age of onset is largely due to the increased preponderance of the conditions causing the symptom in older individuals ‚Äì such as muscular weakness and neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease. While BSS doesn‚Äôt have any negative stigma in and of itself, those affected by it may be perceived differently due to the condition. For example, an elderly individual afflicted with the condition may be viewed as very physically weak, because of the severe bending of the back caused by the condition.  Characteristics and symptoms  The primary symptom of camptocormia is abnormal forward bending of the torso. This bending becomes worse while walking but does not appear when the affected individual is lying down in a horizontal position. This alleviation of the condition indicates that it is a manifestation of another disease or ailment and is not due to a spine that is actually bent. This is somewhat ironic, since the medically accepted name for the condition is bent spine syndrome. In an afflicted individual, the abnormal bending consists of an anterior flexion greater than 45 degrees. Because of this bending and the physical limitations caused by the conditions associated with the disease, it is usually impossible for an afflicted person to achieve a fully erect position. In addition, patients suffering from camptocormia often experience low back pain as a result of the condition. BSS often appears in individuals afflicted with Parkinson‚Äôs disease, muscular dystrophies, endocrine disorders, inflammatory conditions (myositis), or mitochondrial myopathies. As previously mentioned, the disease is more common in older individuals.  Pathology  When initially identified, camptocormia was classified as a psychogenic disease. Although the condition is sometimes a psychogenic manifestation, camptocormia typically originates from either muscular or neurological diseases. However, due to the wide variety of pathologies resulting in camptocormia, there is no singular cause that is most influential for the condition. = Muscular origin = Myopathic origin BSS can be secondary to various muscular disorders or occur as a primary idiopathy. These etiologies are termed secondary and primary BSS respectively. Idiopathic primary BSS is a late-onset myopathy with progressive muscular weakness that is detected on the spinal extensor muscles in elderly patients and is more predominant in females. The pathogenesis of primary BSS is typically related to fibrosis and fatty infiltration of muscular tissues and to mitochondrial changes due to the aging process. Specifically, weakening occurs in the paravertebral muscles of patients. These paravertebral muscles have a great influence over the walking stance and gait of a patient, so fatty infiltration and degradation of these muscle lead to the characteristics that easily define BSS, such as the anterior flexion of the back combined with an ability to keep upright with any kind of support (e.g., holding onto a table). Secondary BSS can have a multitude of causes, making it hard to pinpoint to a specific muscular disorder. Some examples of diseases that have secondary BSS as a symptom are myopathies caused by muscular dystrophies, neuromuscular disorders, and inflammatory muscle diseases; metabolic or endocrine disorders; and mitochondrial myopathies. A muscle biopsy can clearly demonstrate whether primary BSS or secondary BSS is afflicting a patient, because primary BSS is much more identifiable. = Neurological origin = A multitude of neurological disorders cause BSS, including motor neuron disease, CNS disorders, and early amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Usually, the bent spine is caused by dysfunctioning extensor spinal muscles with a neurological cause. Neurological origin BSS may also result from damage to the basal ganglia nuclei that are a part of the cerebral cortex, which play a major role in bodily positioning. Damage to this part of the brain can inhibit proper flexion and extension in the muscles necessary for maintaining an upright position. Additionally, the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a key role in the operation of basal ganglia. An abnormally low dopamine concentration, such as that associated with Parkinson‚Äôs disease, causes dysfunction in the basal ganglia and the associated muscle groups, leading to BSS. Studies have estimated the prevalence of BSS in people affected by Parkinson's to be between 3% and 18%. = Gene mutations = Several gene mutations have been identified in patients with camptocormia. These include the RYR1 gene in axial myopathy, the DMPK gene in myotonic dystrophy, and genes related to dysferlinopathy and Parkinson‚Äôs disease. These genes could serve as targets for gene therapy to treat the condition in the years to come.  Diagnosis  In order to qualify a patient's condition as BSS, the bending angle must be greater than 45 degrees. While the presence of the condition is very easy to note, the cause of the condition is much more difficult to discern. Conditions not considered to be BSS include vertebral fractures, previously existing conditions, and ankylosing spondylitis. Lower-back CT scans and MRIs can typically be used to visualize the cause of the disease. Further identification of the cause can be done by histochemical or cellular analysis of muscle biopsy. 220x220px Camptocormia is becoming progressively found in patients with Parkinson's disease. The diagnosis of Parkinson's-associated camptocormia includes the use of imaging of the brain and the spinal cord, along with electromyography or muscle biopsies. Muscle biopsies are also a useful tool to diagnose camptocormia. Muscle biopsies found to have variable muscle fiber sizes and even endomysial fibrosis may be markers of bent spine syndrome. In addition, disorganized internal architecture and little necrosis or regeneration is a marker of camptocormia. Patients with camptocormia present with reduced strength and stooped posture when standing due to weakened paraspinous muscles (muscles parallel to the spine). Clinically, limb muscles show fatigue with repetitive movements. Paraspinous muscles undergo fat infiltration. Electromyography may be used as well in diagnosis. On average, the paraspinous muscles of affected individuals were found to be 75% myopathic, while limb muscles were 50% percent myopathic. Creatine kinase activity levels in skeletal muscle are a diagnostic indicator that can be identifiable through blood tests.  Treatment and prognosis = Treatment and management = Thymatron IV used for electroconvulsive therapy Due to the wide range of causes of camptocormia, there is no one treatment that suits all patients. In addition, there is no specific pharmacological treatment for primary BSS. The use of analgesic drugs depends entirely on the intensity of the back pain. Muscular-origin BSS can be alleviated by positive lifestyle changes, including physical activity, walking with a cane, a nutritious diet, and weight loss. Worsening of symptoms is possible but rare in occurrence. Treatment of the underlying cause of the disease can alleviate the condition in some individuals with secondary BSS. Other treatment options include drugs, injections of botulinum toxin, electroconvulsive therapy, deep brain stimulation, and surgical correction. Unfortunately, many of the elderly individuals affected by the BSS are not treated surgically due to age-related physical ailments and the long postoperative recovery period. = Outcome and prognosis = This condition can lead to excess pressure on the spine, causing pain and discomfort. If the spine is bent too far, a patient may have difficulties breathing because of the pressure of the spine pressed against the lungs. Camptocormia may also lead to muscle weakness in the upper back and to arthritis and other bone-degeneration diseases. Because of loss of bone strength, injury to the spine and slipped discs become increasingly significant. Camptocormia can lead to infection, tumors, and diseases of the endocrine system and connective tissues. The success of the treatment method is largely dependent on the patient, but response to therapeutic methods is generally low.  Research directions  203x203px Clinical studies have revealed that camptocormia may be hereditary; however, the inheritance mechanism remains unclear. Current areas of research include molecular and genetic studies aimed at elucidating a possible inheritance model along with molecular pathological mechanisms and proteins responsible for BSS. This research will help will facilitate improvement in the classification, diagnosis, and treatment of the condition. In addition, new technologies and animal models of postural abnormalities are being developed to understand camptocormia and design more effective treatment methods. = Deep brain stimulation = One treatment methodogy that is very promising for the treatment of camptocormia is deep brain stimulation. Previously, deep brain stimulation and bilateral stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus and/or globus pallidus internus have been used to treat patients with Parkinson's disease. Studies have shown that similar treatments could be used on patients with severe camptocormia. By using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale before and after treatment, it was found that patients experienced significant functional improvement in the ability to walk.

The unit was formed between April and September 1942 and was equipped with Dornier Do 217, Junkers Ju 188 and Junkers Ju 88 bombers. The Geschwader bombed Britain, the Eastern Front, North Africa, Italy and Normandy. Formation While officially formed on or about 1 September 1942 at Dinard/Brittany in northern France, the history of the Geschwader dates back to 11 October 1941. On that date, the Luftwaffenf√ºhrungssab in Berlin ordered Luftflotte 3 in Paris to form a Stab unit for a new Kampfgeschwader which was to carry the number 6. The new bomber formation was to comprise K√ºstenfliegergruppe 106, Kampfgruppe 606 and stab./K√ºstenfliegergruppe 406, with its subordinated staffeln.de Zeng et al Vol. 1 2007, p. 61. The first date that KG 6 was mentioned was 30 April 1942, when Luftflotte 3 documents recorded its formation at Dinard under Fliegerf√ºhrer Atlantik, but with no aircraft or aircrews. On 3 June 1942, the new unit's Geschwaderkommodore Oberstleutnant Joachim Hahn, former Kommandeur of Kampfgruppe 606, while flying a Messerschmitt Bf 108 near Dieppe, was shot down and killed by Royal Canadian Air Force fighter pilots of No. 401 Squadron.'High Blue Battle' Mcintosh, 1990, p. 101 In August 1942, Berlin ordered a full Geschwader to be formed, stating that the unit was to be a special bomber force to operate against key British industrial targets, as well as command and communication centres. To this end, it was to have its own pathfinder capability. Operational history=Early raids, 1942‚Äì43= I./KG 6 bombed British targets throughout the year, and suffered only one recorded loss against RAF Mosquito night fighters. The German raids were usually carried out with only a few aircraft. On one rare occasion, the unit took part in a raid of 57 aircraft on Canterbury on 31 October 1942. II./KG 6 had only formed on 1 August, so bombing missions over Britain were few. III./KG 6 targeted Hull and factories in Exeter in January, losing two Ju 88A-4s on 11 January 1943. The unit bombed Newcastle, Sunderland and Edinburgh in the northeast of England. The unit also bombed London, Norwich and Birmingham. In the summer of 1943, I. and III. Gruppen bombed Norwich on 4 and 5 May, with 36 aircraft. An attack on ball bearing plants in Chelmsford took place on 13 and 14 May, I. Gruppe took part with other Geschwadern in sending 76 aircraft to bomb Sunderland's docks. On 17 and 18 May, 74 bombers hit Cardiff. In June 1943, the Gruppen moved to Sardinia. =Eastern Front= III./KG 6 had not participated in the raids on Britain and was sent to the Eastern Front to support Army Group North, where it spent the period of September to December 1942 bombing targets in the northern Soviet Union. Under Luftflotte 1, it bombed the railway station at Volkhov on 15 September and supported ground operations around Lake Ladoga a day later. It attacked Red Army positions at Gaytolovo and Markovo during the 20‚Äì23 September battles. On 25 September, it struck rail targets at Chum, losing one aircraft; and on the 28th targets in and around Leningrad were hit. On 30 September, another Ju 88A-4 was lost in the Kerstov area. The unit was redeployed to Stalingrad on 4 October as a planned assault by Erich von Manstein's Eleventh Army was postponed. Rail targets in Stalingrad were bombed. Soviet artillery in the North Caucasus, and Astrakhan were bombed from 9 to 18 October.de Zeng et al Vol. 1 2007, p. 67. =North Africa and the Mediterranean= I. Gruppe was engaged in anti-shipping missions off the North African coast. Allocated to 2nd Flieger Division based at Creil in southern France, it targeted Allied shipping in Algerian waters. It ended these operations in March 1943, moving to France to undertake raids over Great Britain.de Zeng et al Vol. 1 2007, p. 62. II. Gruppe succeeded in supporting German forces in the Dodecanese Campaign, operating from bases at Larissa, in Greece. It withdrew to Le Culot, Belgium in December 1943.de Zeng et al Vol. 1 2007, p. 66. III. Gruppe also took part in the Dodecanese action. =Italian Campaign= I Gruppe continued to support the Army in Italy. The Gruppe suffered steady losses during night and daylight missions. The air defences were particularly threatening. On 7 August the Gruppe carried out a raid on Bizerte harbour, Tunisia, claiming a direct hit on a 5,000-ton cargo ship. Air reconnaissance later seemed to have confirmed the claim. Various raids were carried out against Allied airfields in Sicily. However, heavy attacks on bases caused numerous losses to the group.de Zeng et al Vol. 1 2007, p. 63. Between July and 1 August 1942, III. Gruppe was created. It was a 'fire brigade' unit, constantly switching from front to front from August to October 1942. The gruppe was then moved to Sicily to support the Afrika Korps. Anti- shipping attacks against the North African coast were made without significant success and the odd loss. In December 1943 the gruppe was moved back to France to carry out raids against British targets.de Zeng et al Vol. 1 2007, p. 65. =Operation Steinbock= The Steinbock operation was launched against the United Kingdom in retaliation for the RAF's bombing of German cities, which at that time was dubbed the Battle of Berlin. I.KG 6 began offensive operations with 41 Ju 88s based at Chievres, Belgium under IX. Fliegerkorps. It carried out raids against London on 20 January 1944 but suffered heavy losses. Crews were often sent on missions they were not fit for until they were shot down or crashed. By 20 March, just 13 Ju 188s remained, only 10 of them operational. On the night/morning of 21/22 March, the unit raided London again. For the next six weeks, the unit was withdrawn for rest and refitting. It resumed attacks in May, losing an aircraft on 14/15 May and attacked Allied shipping in the Bristol channel. On 22 and 23 May, it contributed to a fleet of 104 aircraft that attacked Portsmouth. On 27 and 28 May, it attacked Weymouth Bay and on 30 and 31 May, dropped mines off Falmouth. It also bombed the docks as part of a 51-aircraft force. During Steinbock the commanding officer of the group, Major Helmut Fuhrhop was shot down and killed by Hawker Typhoons while on a transfer flight from Paris to Dreux in Ju 188 3E+KH, belonging to 1 staffel. All aboard were killed including his two boxer dogs; Oberfeldwebel Alfred Schubert, Alfons Eichschmidt, Walter Rehfeldt, Wilhelm Scachtshabel and Arnold Buttner. II./KG 6, with 39 Ju 88As, was based at Le Culot, Belgium. It participated in seven major raids on London in February 1944, and bombed London from 13 to 15 March. On 24 and 25 March 1944, it attacked Whitehall and Westminster, in London. The unit returned to attack London again on 18 and 19 April. On 14 and 15 May, it attacked Allied invasion shipping in Bristol Harbour with a fleet of 91 aircraft (with other Geschwader), without suffering any losses. Along with the other Gruppen, it took part in the Portsmouth and Falmouth raids on 22/23, 29/30 and 30/31 May. By the end of Operation Steinbock, the Gruppe had been decimated. III./KG 6 had 41 Ju 88 A and S variants (of which a total of 37 were operational), from Brussels, Belgium. This unit flew missions in support of Steinbock as well, and recorded high losses. It took part in the first raid of the year against London on 21/22 January 1944 and more raids on 29/30 January; 3/4, 20/21, 24/25 February; and 14/15, 21/22 March. The unit left Belgium for Hungary to participate in Operation Margarethe, the Nazi occupation of that country. It returned to Belgium on 21 March and resumed attacks on London on 24 and 25 March, and on Bristol on 27 and 28 March. It took part in a major assault on London on 18 and 19 April 1944, during which the Gruppe flew its 10,000th operational sortie. On 25/26 April 1944, it participated in a 137-aircraft attack on Portsmouth Harbour, and on the following night, bombed Bristol. In mid-May, it was withdrawn from Steinbock operations, having lost two-thirds of its aircraft. The Geschwader lost a total of 70 aircraft out of 110 during the operation. =Normandy= I. Gruppe flew missions over the Allied beachheads and French estuaries on 7, 10, 11, 13, 15, 20, 21, 24 and 29 June. Losses were heavy. At dawn on 7 July 1944, a force of 91 bombers sent out by IX. Fliegerkorps bombed ships off the beaches. Five ships were reportedly hit by III. Gruppe. This was repeated on 9 July. Mine-laying and ground attack missions were also flown. By September, fuel shortages meant that the group was no longer operational. On 23 November 1944, after withdrawing into Germany, it was redesignated as fighter unit I. KG 6 (J) (Jagd or Fighter). II. Gruppe flew missions throughout June, July and August 1944. It gradually withdrew into the Netherlands in late August and Germany in September. III. Gruppe flew missions in support of Heer and Waffen SS units in France. It flew sorties in the Orne estuary on the night of 6/7 June and 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19 and 20 June 1944. The Gruppe moved to Villaroche and Ahlhorn on 2 July. Fuel shortages forced the group to abandon operations.de Zeng et al Vol. 1 2007, p. 68. It was ordered to retrain as a fighter aircraft unit on 23 November and was renamed III./KG 6 (J).

A Kammers√§nger of the Dresden State Opera, he created leading roles in three operas by Richard Strauss ‚Äì Jochanaan in Salome, Orest in Elektra, and Baron Ochs in Der Rosenkavalier.Kuhn (2000) p. 602 Biography Karl Perron was born in Frankenthal to one of the city's prominent families. His father was an art collector and numismatist. Another of his relatives, Phillip Perron (1840‚Äì1907), was the court sculptor to Ludwig II of Bavaria.City of Frankenthal, Perron Kunstpreis 2002. Accessed 28 July 2009 (in German). After studies with Julius Hey in Berlin, Joseph Hasselbeck in Munich, and Julius Stockhausen in Frankfurt, Perron made his debut in Leipzig in 1884 as Wolfram in Tannh√§user. He sang in Liepzig until 1891 when he became a member of the Dresden State Opera. Perron remained with the Dresden company until his retirement in 1924, and sang there in three world premieres of operas by Richard Strauss ‚Äì Jochanaan (John the Baptist) in Salome (1905), Orest (Orestes) in Elektra (1909), and Baron Ochs in Der Rosenkavalier (1911). Perron was a distinguished Wagnerian singer and appeared at Bayreuth from 1889 to 1904 where his roles included Wotan, Amfortas, and King Marke. Charles Webber, who had been a voice coach at the Dresden State Opera from 1908 to 1911 recalled that Perron was past the peak of his career by then but still an impressive singer, especially in the title role of The Flying Dutchman and as Wotan. According to Webber, although Perron's top notes were occasionally forced and his intonation sometimes faulty, he retained an intense and mesmerizing stage presence which obscured the flaws.Webber (1952) p. 296 Outside the Wagner and Strauss repertoire, Perron's other notable roles were Don Giovanni and Eugene Onegin.Warrack and West (1992) Perron taught singing after his retirement. His house in Dresden was filled with his own art collection, and the salons there were one of the centers of the city's musical life.

Biography  Son of Liqa Mequas Abebe Atnaf Seggad, Abye was born 1917 in Addis Ababa as a Lij. He attended the Holeta Military Academy. In the 1940s and 1950s he was Minister of Defence, and later served as Minister of Justice and Minister of the Interior.Bahru Zewde, A History of Modern Ethiopia, second edition (London: James Currey, 2003), p. 205 He chaired the High National Security Commission during the Ethiopian Revolution until his arrest by the Derg 16 July 1974.Andargachew Tiruneh, The Ethiopian revolution, 1974-1987 (Cambridge: University Press, 1993), p. 68 Lt. General Abiye was serving as Chief of the General Staff when he was arrested. According to John Spencer, when Prime Minister Aklilu Habte-Wold sought to resign his post in 1973, he suggested to the Emperor that he be replaced by General Abiye. Other sources indicate that Aklilu Habte-Wold's rival Prince Asrate Kassa was the person who put General Abiye forward as a fellow aristocrat. However Abiye consented to becoming Prime Minister only if his nomination, and those of his cabinet, were approved by the Ethiopian parliament, a condition Emperor Haile Selassie found unacceptable. As a result, Haile Selassie decided to appoint Endelkachew Makonnen Prime Minister instead.Spencer, Ethiopia at Bay: A personal account of the Haile Selassie years (Algonac: Reference Publications, 1984), p. 337 Abiye was one of 60 former government officials executed the night of 22‚Äì23 November at Akaki Central Prison by the Derg.Marina and David Ottaway, Ethiopia: Empire in Revolution (New York: Africana, 1978), p. 61 General Abiye was married three times. At Addis Ababa, on 26 April 1942, he married Princess Tsehai of Ethiopia who died in childbirth a year later. Subsequent to this marriage, Lt. General Abiye Abebe was accorded the dignities and protocol rank of the Emperor's son-in-law, even after he remarried. In 1946, married Woizero Amarech Nasibu, and then later to Woizero Tsige, his widow.

According to David C. Douglas he was \\"one of the most inspiring teachers which Oxford has ever produced\\".David C. Douglas, English Scholars (1939), p. 79. Life Thwaites was the son of William Thwaites of Crosby-Ravensworth, Westmoreland, born at Ravensworth. After schooling at Kendal, Thwaites was admitted batler of The Queen's College, Oxford, on 18 September 1689, and graduated B.A. in 1694 and M.A. in 1697. Before he took his master's degree Thwaites had come under the influence of George Hickes, who came to live at Gloucester Green in Oxford in 1696. There was already a group of Anglo-Saxon students at Queen's, among whom Thwaites was a leader. Thwaites was ordained priest on 2 January 1698, and shortly afterwards was elected fellow and lecturer of his college, to teach Anglo-Saxon. The difficulty which he found in procuring sufficient copies of William Somner's Anglo-Saxon Dictionary (1659) led to the issue of another edition, with additions by Thomas Benson, in 1701. In 1699, he was appointed dean of his college; he tried to improve college discipline, and had his windows broken. He was promoted to be lecturer in moral philosophy in 1704, and he became Regius Professor of Greek in March 1708. He gave his inaugural lecture on 12 May 1708. Thomas Hearne, once a friend, noted his decline into consumption. During 1708 Thwaites was appointed Whyte's professor of moral philosophy. Hearne speaks of Thwaites as reduced by 1711 to a skeleton; he was suffering from a complication of disorders, and Charles Bernard, royal surgeon, was impressed by his heroism during an operation to amputate his leg; he is said to have mentioned the case to Queen Anne, who made a grant of money. Thwaites died at Littlemore on 12 December 1711, and was buried in Iffley. His monument is figured in John Le Neve's Monumenta Anglicana (1717, v. 226). There is a portrait of Thwaites as St. Gregory, in an initial G, in Elizabeth Elstob's English-Saxon Homily on the Birthday of St. Gregory. Works His first project seems to have been to edit, with a commentary and translation, King Alfred's Anglo-Saxon version of the Universal History of Orosius, and this plan had Hickes's approval. He substituted, in the course of 1697, an edition of Dionysius Periegetes.Dionysii Orbis Descriptio cum veterum Scholiis et Eustathii commentariis. Accedit Periegesis Prisciani cum Notis Andreae Papii, Oxford. Before the close of 1698 Thwaites dedicated to George Hickes his Heptateuchus, Liber Job et Evangelium Nicodemi Anglo-Saxonicae: this act of loyalty by Thwaites to the nonjuror Hickes was at some risk to his position, and attracted attention from the meddling Arthur Charlett.:s:Charlett, Arthur (DNB00)Douglas, p. 116. The same year saw an edition of Alfred's version of Boethius (Consolationis Philosophiae lib. v.) by Thwaites's pupil at Queen's, Christopher Rawlinson, who acknowledges help from his tutor. Thwaites had already begun in a modest fashion to assist Hickes in the preparation of his Thesaurus, which was published in 1705. In 1708 he had privately printed his Notae in Anglo-Saxonum nummos (Oxford). The coins described were from the collection of Sir Andrew Fountaine, another Oxford contemporary, friend, and fellow contributor to Hickes's Thesaurus. In 1709 appeared at Oxford an edition of Ephrem the Syrian.Œ§·Ω∞ œÑŒø·ø¶ ·ΩÅœÉŒØŒøœÖ œÄŒ±œÑœÅ·Ω∏œÇ ·ºòœÜœÅŒ±·Ω∂Œº œÑŒø·ø¶ Œ£œçœÅŒøœÖ œÄœÅ·Ω∏œÇ œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ ŒïŒªŒªŒ¨Œ¥Œ± ŒºŒµœÑŒ±Œ≤ŒªŒ∑Œ∏Œ≠ŒΩœÑŒ±. S.

In 1711 Thwaites returned to Anglo-Saxon, dedicating to his old pupil, Christopher Rawlinson, his Grammatica Anglo-Saxonica, ex Hickesanio Linguarum Septentrionalium Thesauro excerpta (Oxford).

The Civil Procedure Rules, which regulate civil procedure in the High Court, allocate non-exhaustive categories of work to the court, principally, as the name suggests, disputes in the areas of construction and technology. However, since its formation in its current guise in October 1998, the court's jurisdiction has expanded such that many civil claims which are factually or technically complex are now heard in the TCC, beyond its traditional case load. For example, large-scale group personal injury claims are heard by the court, as are disputes arising out of the EU's public procurement regime. The court's reputation has steadily grown over the years, such that it is now regarded as a highly capable and knowledgeable court. Its case load has dramatically increased since 1998, both in the form of traditional litigation and through assisted methods of alternative dispute resolution. In 2011, the court moved its central location from its aged buildings in Fetter Lane to the newly constructed ¬£200m Rolls Building.http://www.justice.gov.uk/news/press- releases/moj/newsrelease071211a.htm History The court was known until 9 October 1998 as the Official Referees' Court, a name which reflected its old status as a tribunal with no jurisdiction per se, but which could report to judges on its findings. The new court, which was founded under the leadership of Mr Justice Dyson (later the Master of the Rolls), aimed to rid the perception this created that the court was not equal to others in the Queen's Bench Division. When opening the new court, Dyson said the new changes were \\"of real significance\\", and included technological advancements to aid the court's running, such as a centralised listing system. With the introduction of the new Civil Procedure Rules on 26 April 1999 following Lord Woolf's report, the TCC's caseload dropped slightly as a result of the new Rules' focus on alternative dispute resolution. These meant that less claims were issued - previously, claims had simply been issued as a matter of course as part of the negotiation process. The proliferation of adjudication following its introduction in the Construction Act 1996 also led to fewer disputes going before the court, but did give the court a new role in enforcing adjudication decisions. The Construction Act gives parties to a \\"construction contract\\" a right to refer matters to adjudicators, with the aim of aiding cash flow in the construction sector by allowing disputes to be settled without the need for lengthy and costly court proceedings. Changes to the Construction Act 1996 brought in by the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 are likely to see even more disputes referred to adjudication before reaching the TCC. The Arbitration Act 1996 had a similar effect as adjudication. Such was the effect on the number of cases being brought before the TCC, extra capacity meant that TCC judges could act as judge-arbitrators, utilising their experience and knowledge while contributing to the CPR's goals in reducing litigation costs. Jurisdiction The TCC deals primarily with litigation of disputes arising in the field of technology and construction. It includes building, engineering and technology disputes, professional negligence claims and IT disputes as well as enforcement of adjudication decisions and challenges to arbitrators‚Äô decisions. The TCC also regularly deals with allegations of lawyers‚Äô negligence arising in connection with planning, property, construction and other technical disputes. The work of the TCC often involves both complex legal argument and heavyweight technical issues, and as a result TCC judges try some of the most arduous and complex disputes that come before the civil courts. The sums at issue can be large, often involving millions of pounds, although there is in theory at least no minimum sum to be claimed (as, under the CPR, the court has wide powers to assert jurisdiction over clams it feels are appropriate). Cases can last several days and involve mountains of paperwork and expert evidence. Court locations TCC cases are managed and heard by specialist judges in London and at centres throughout England and Wales. The cases are allocated either to High Court Judges, Senior Circuit Judges, Circuit Judges or Recorders both in London and at regional centres outside London. Since its inception, the court has been led by several Judges in Charge, a role filled by a number of pre- eminent judges in the field of construction law: Lord Dyson, Sir John Thayne Forbes, Sir Rupert Jackson, Sir Vivian Ramsey, Mr Justice Akenhead (2010 to 2013), Sir Antony Edwards-Stuart (2013 to 2016), Sir Peter Coulson (2016 to 2018), and Sir Peter Fraser (2018 to present). As at 2019, the Court has seven full-time High Court judges. In April 2011, the court moved its central location from its aged building in Fetter Lane (now replaced by a block of plush apartments) to a purpose-built block less than 100 yards away on Fetter Lane, the Rolls Building, not far from the Royal Court of Justice in London. The court shares the building with other divisional courts of the Queen's Bench and Chancery Divisions. As well as its London location, where most cases (including those with an international element) are heard after being started or transferred there, claims can be issued and heard at any of the following regional court centres: * Birmingham (full-time TCC judge available) * Bristol * Cardiff * Chester * Exeter * Leeds * Liverpool (full-time TCC judge available) * Manchester (full-time TCC judge available) * Newcastle * Nottingham TCC authorised judges are also available at Leicester, Sheffield and Southampton, although claims cannot be issued there.

The avifauna of the Palestine region is unusually rich for so small an area. Henry B. Tristram, who identified much of the avifauna of Palestine in an 1885 study which denoted the geographical scope as covering an area of , identified 348 species. Of those, 271 are Palearctic, 40 are Ethiopian (10 of which are also Indian), 7 Indian and 30 which are peculiar to Syria.Hastings, 2004, p. 762. The number of species identified has grown considerably since then and is expected to grow further as the number of active ornithologists in the region grows. Today, there are 470 species, classified in 206 genera, belonging to 67 families and grouped in 21 orders. Orders containing the largest numbers of species are: Passeriformes (songbirds) with 192 species, Charadriiformes (waders, plovers, gulls) with 88 species, Falconiformes (diurnal birds of prey) with 44 species and Anseriformes (swans, geese, ducks) with 33 species. The largest families are: Sylviidae (warblers) with 43 species, Turdidae (thrushes, chats) and Anatidae (swans, geese, ducks), both with 33 species and Accipitridae (eagles, vultures, hawks) with 32 species. The most populous genera are: Sylvia (warblers) with 15 species, Emberiza (buntings) with 14 and Larus (gulls) with 13, while Oenanthe (wheatears), Sterna (terns) and Falco (falcons) each comprise 11 species. The types of avifauna are not equally diffused over the whole area. The Palearctic species are found largely near the coast of the Mediterranean Sea and the highlands east and west of Jordan. The Ethiopian and Indian types are almost exclusively confined to the Dead Sea basin. There are 30 species of migratory soaring birds that pass through Palestine annually.

Peninsular Malaysia (Malay: Semenanjung Malaysia), also known as Malaya or West Malaysia, is the part of Malaysia which occupies the southern half of the Malay Peninsula and the surrounding islands. Its area is , which is nearly 40% of the total area of the country; the other 60% is East Malaysia. For comparison, it is slightly larger than England (130,395 km¬≤). It shares a land border with Thailand to the north. Across the Strait of Malacca to the west lies the island of Sumatra (Indonesia) and across the South China Sea to the east lies the Natuna Islands (Indonesia). At the southern tip across the Strait of Johor lies the island and country of Singapore. Peninsular Malaysia accounts for the majority (roughly 81.3%) of Malaysia's population and economy; as of 2017 its population is roughly 26 million (92% of total population).  States and territories  A map of Malaya. Peninsular Malaysia consists of 11 out of the 13 states, and two out of the three federal territories of Malaysia. The capital city, Kuala Lumpur is also in Peninsular Malaysia. *Northern Region: Perlis, Kedah, Penang, Perak *East Coast Region: Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, *Central Region: Selangor, federal territories of Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya *Southern Region: Negeri Sembilan, Malacca, Johor  Etymology  The topography of Peninsular Malaysia. Peninsular Malaysia is also known as West Malaysia (Malaysia Barat) or the States of Malaya (Negeri-negeri Tanah Melayu). Demographics The majority of people on Peninsular Malaysia are ethnic Malays, predominantly Muslim. Large Chinese and Indian populations exist. The Orang Asli are the indigenous people of Peninsular Malaysia; they number around 140,000 and mostly live in inland parts of the region. Economy As of 2012, Peninsular Malaysia oil production stood at 520,000 barrel of oil equivalent per day.  Other features = East Coast and West Coast = The term East Coast is particularly used in Malaysia to describe the following states in Peninsular Malaysia facing the South China Sea, a component of the Pacific Ocean: *Kelantan *Pahang *Terengganu The term West Coast refers informally to a collection of states in Peninsular Malaysia situated towards the western coast generally facing the Strait of Malacca which is a component of the Indian Ocean, as opposed to the East Coast. Unlike the East Coast, the West Coast is partitioned further into three regions (as seen in #States and territories), including: * The Northern Region: Perlis, Kedah, Penang and Perak. * The Central Region: Selangor and the federal territories of Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya. * The Southern Region: Negeri Sembilan, Melaka and Johor. Even though Johor has a coastline facing the South China Sea on the Pacific Ocean, it is not generally regarded as an East Coast state, since the main coastline of the state is located on the Straits of Johor of the Indian Ocean. = West and East Malaysia = The distinction between West and East Malaysia (Sabah and Sarawak) goes beyond the sphere of geography. Being separate regions administratively before the formation of the Malaysia, there exists more autonomy than the original States of Malaya, e.g. in having a different judicial court structure and separate immigration regulations. These rights were granted as part of Sarawak's 18-point agreement and Sabah's 20-point agreement with the Federation of Malaya during the formation of expanded federation.

The Ethiopians offered the IML assurances that if Eritrea enter into union with Ethiopia, Islamic traditions would be respected and schools would teach in Arabic language alongside Amharic.

Such buttons can appear to work, by lighting up or otherwise reacting, which rewards the user by giving them an illusion of control. They are commonly placed in situations where it would have once been useful to have such a button but the system now operates automatically, such as a manual thermostat in a temperature-regulated office. Were the control removed entirely, some users would feel frustrated at the awareness they were not in control. In many cases a button may appear to do nothing but in fact causes behavior that is not immediately apparent; this can give the appearance of it being a placebo button.  Office thermostats  It has been reported that the temperature set point adjustment on thermostats in many office buildings in the United States is non-functional, installed to give tenants' employees a similar illusion of control. In some cases they act as input devices to a central control computer but in others they serve no purpose other than to keep employees contented. A common implementation in buildings with an HVAC central control computer is to allow the thermostats to provide a graded level of control. Temperatures in such a system are governed by the central controller's settings, which are typically set by the building maintenance staff or HVAC engineers. The individual thermostats in various offices provide the controller with a temperature reading of the zone (provided the thermocouples are not installed as inline duct sensors), but also serve as modifiers for the central controller's set point. While the thermostat may include settings from, for example, , the actual effect of the thermostat is to apply \\"pressure\\" to the central controller's set point. Thus, if the controller's setting is , setting the thermostat to its maximum warm or cool settings will deflect the output temperature, generally by only a few degrees Fahrenheit (about two degrees Celsius) at most. So, although the thermostat can be set to its lowest marking of , in reality, it may change the HVAC system's output temperature only to . In this case, the thermostat has a \\"swing\\" of 2 ¬∞C (4 ¬∞F): it can alter the produced temperature from the main controller's set point by a maximum of 1 ¬∞C (2 ¬∞F) in either direction. Consequently, while not purely a placebo, the thermostat in this setup does not provide the level of control that is expected, but the combination of the lower setting number and the feeling of a slight change in temperature can induce the office occupants to believe that the temperature was significantly decreased. Placebo thermostats work on two psychological principles, which are classical conditioning and the placebo effect. First, placebo thermostats work in accordance with classical conditioning. Classical conditioning was first discovered by Ivan Pavlov and is a type of learning which pairs a stimulus with a physiological response. Applied to placebo thermostats, this is when the employee adjusts the thermostat and hears the noise of hissing or a fan running and consequently physically feels more content. This is due to the countless trials involving the thermostat in their own home, which actually works. The employee has paired the sound of hissing or a fan running to being more physically content due to the actual temperature change and therefore when they experience the noise at work they feel the same way even though there is no change in temperature. As long as individuals get the result they are looking for (noise associated with temperature change) they will continue with the practice (changing the placebo thermostat). Additionally, placebo thermostats work due to the placebo effect. The placebo effect works on the basis that individuals will experience what they believe they will experience. This is attributed to Expectancy theory, which states that the placebo effect is mediated by overt expectancies. The most common example is in medical testing: inactive sugar pills are given to patients who are told they are actually medicine. Some patients will experience relief from symptoms regardless. According to expectancy theory, if people believe they are going to experience a temperature change after changing a placebo thermostat they may psychologically experience one without an actual change happening. Both psychological concepts of classical conditioning and the placebo effect may play a role in the effectiveness of placebo thermostats.  Walk buttons  A walk button in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn Many walk buttons at pedestrian crossings were once functional in New York City, but now serve as placebo buttons. In the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, pedestrian push-buttons on crossings using the Split Cycle Offset Optimisation Technique may or may not have any real effect on crossing timings, depending on their location and the time of day, and some junctions may be completely automated, with push-buttons which do not have any effect at all. In other areas the buttons have an effect only during the night. Some do not affect the actual lights timing but requires the button having been pressed to activate pedestrian green lights.  London Underground train door buttons  London Underground 1992 stock, 1995 stock and 1996 stock include door control buttons. The doors are normally driver operated, but a switch in the driving cab can hand control to passengers once the driver activates the buttons, much like mainline railway stock. In addition, London Underground D stock used on the District line were built with door open buttons which worked much like those of the 1992, 1995 and 1996 stock.

After Newton had formulated his law of gravitation, he observed, in a letter to Richard Bentley, that if all the stars are drawn to each other by gravitation, they should collapse into a single point. One will be drawn to another; that star will grow and pull in still more and more. In time, everything must be drawn in. \\"According to Newton, each star in the universe ought to be attracted towards every other star.

The episode was written by Bryan Elsley and Georgia Lester, and was directed by Simon Massey. The episode focuses on the character of Pandora Moon (Lisa Backwell), who is miserable after her boyfriend, Thomas Tomone (Merveille Lukeba), recently returned to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. She holds a small pyjama party for her friends, but it descends into chaos when uninvited guests arrive and the food is spiked with drugs. Pandora and Effy get into an argument after both girls have sex with James Cook (Jack O'Connell), but the argument is interrupted when Thomas unexpectedly returns. \\"Pandora\\" was filmed in September 2008. It featured guest appearances by Sally Phillips and Harry Enfield, as well as real-life partners Morwenna Banks and David Baddiel, who play on-screen lovers. The episode brought in 701,000 viewers and was E4's highest-rated programme of the week. It received generally positive reviews from critics. Harry Enfield and James Fleet who both appear in this episode previously starred together as father and son in the 2000 film Kevin & Perry Go Large. Plot At the house of her friend, Effy Stonem (Kaya Scodelario), Pandora (Lisa Backwell) tells Effy's mother, Anthea (Morwenna Banks), that she misses Thomas, who recently returned to his country of origin, the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Later, Effy's father, Jim (Harry Enfield), discovers his wife's infidelity when his boss, Steve (David Baddiel), arrives at the house, declaring his love for Anthea. Effy grows miserable after Jim leaves the family, and Pandora, desperate for some fun, throws a pyjama party. Effy and Katie Fitch (Megan Prescott) arrive with Pandora at her house for the party and meet her neurotic mother, Angela (Sally Phillips). Disappointed by the lack of boys, drugs and alcohol because of Angela's strict supervision, Katie spikes the brownies that they make with MDMA. As Naomi Campbell (Lily Loveless) and Katie's twin sister, Emily (Kathryn Prescott), arrive together, Naomi urges Emily to admit that she is gay, but Emily denies it. All of the girls indulge in the brownies and Pandora is unhappy to see her mother's behaviour grow increasingly erratic. After Angela is carried into a bedroom to sleep, Pandora locks herself in the bathroom, upset about Thomas's departure and angry with Effy, who she believes spiked the brownies. Outside, Cook and JJ Jones (Ollie Barbieri) try to sneak into the girls' party. Cook enters the house through a window, but accidentally locks himself inside a wardrobe. After calling his friend, Freddie Mclair (Luke Pasqualino), for help, JJ goes into the house by himself and sees Emily and Naomi kissing. Katie, too, witnesses the pair kissing, but is interrupted when her footballer boyfriend, Danny Guillermo (Henry Garrett), and dozens of his friends arrive at the house to crash the party. Hiding from the rest of the party, Effy finds Cook, and they have sex in the wardrobe. They fall through the wall into the next room and find a DVD which shows Angela having sex with her older neighbour, Martin (James Fleet). Freddie comes to take JJ home and confronts Effy about leaving Pandora for Cook. As he leaves, so does Effy. By the time Pandora comes out of the bathroom, Cook is the only person left at the house. Together they play Twister, which was all Pandora had wanted to do, along with learning from her friends about human sexuality. Cook offers to have sex with her, and they spend the night together. Effy visits Pandora the next morning, and sees Cook share a kiss with her as he leaves. Feeling hurt, she confronts Pandora, but to no avail, as Pandora is slightly empowered after losing her virginity. Pandora defiantly tells Effy that Cook, due to his promiscuity and impulsive, carnal behavior, belongs to no one. Effy appears to understand, and makes no rebuttal. Suddenly, Thomas appears and runs up to Pandora, and she sobs in his arms as a thoughtful Effy looks on. Production A scene from \\"Pandora\\" is filmed at the Bristol Harbour. \\"Pandora\\" was filmed in September 2008 in the same production block as the series' sixth episode, \\"Naomi\\", and the series' opening title sequence. Lisa Backwell described filming Pandora's episode as \\"brilliant\\" and said that \\"spending 12 hours in the loopy world of Pandora wearing wacky floral prints and bright yellow trainers is probably the most fun I've ever had\\". Comedian David Baddiel appeared in a brief cameo appearance as the lover of Anthea, who is played by Baddiel's real-life partner, Morwenna Banks. Kaya Scodelario said that working with Baddiel was \\"amazing\\" and that returning to work with her on-screen parents, Banks and Harry Enfield, after the show's second series was \\"brilliant\\".

Another 165,000 viewers watched the episode an hour after its initial broadcast on E4's timeshift channel, E4+1. The episode received mostly positive reviews. A critic for PopSugar.com called \\"Pandora\\" a \\"fantastic episode\\" and was pleased that Pandora's character \\"graduated from being random light relief and we got a real insight into her life\\". They praised each of the \\"superb\\" guest actors, particularly Harry Enfield, David Baddiel and Sally Phillips, who she thought played Angela \\"brilliantly\\". Digital Spy's Neil Wilkes gave the episode a positive review, describing it as \\"probably the most outrageous of the series to date\\". He wrote that the tension between Effy and Freddie \\"set things up nicely\\" for the following episode, which focused on Freddie. The entertainment editor for eurOut.org, a website for European lesbians, thought that the episode included \\"a lot of confusing straight relationship drama\\" and felt like she was \\"stuck in high school hell\\". She wrote, however, that the brownie-making scene was \\"so ridiculous it's kind of funny\\" and likened Skins to \\"Gossip Girl on crack\\". Jason Hughes of TV Squad felt that within the ensemble cast \\"most of these kids were so unlikable\\", though he attributed this to the series \\"show[ing] us their weaknesses\\". He found Pandora to be more likable, however, believing that her innocence was \\"more representative of youth than most of the other characters\\". One reviewer for lesbian-based website AfterEllen.com called the episode \\"must-see TV\\", while another reviewer expressed disapproval of the use of Katy Perry's song, \\"I Kissed a Girl\\", in promotional videos for the episode.

He was drafted to the Crows with selection 52 in the 2007 Rookie Draft.

He was named as an emergency in the game against and after two teammates were withdrawn due to illness, he was selected for his first game. He kicked a goal with his first kick in AFL football and performed well enough to retain his place in the side for the next week. In that game, against , he seriously injured his left knee while landing awkwardly after a marking contest, and although he played out the match, scans later revealed a rupture to the anterior cruciate ligament in the knee, requiring reconstructive knee surgery and a 10 to 12-month rehabilitation period. He made a successful return late in 2010, playing two games in the SANFL for and two AFL games, including a 28-possession effort against . After the season, retiring captain Simon Goodwin passed his guernsey number, 36, to Martin. In 2011 Martin struggled for form, playing only five matches for Adelaide, although he showed good signs late in the season for Sturt. He was kept out of the side by persistent hamstring injuries in 2012, playing seven games. He continued to perform for Sturt, with 12 Magarey Medal votes from limited appearances. 2013 was also ruined by injuries, with Martin only playing two games. Martin had his best season to date in 2014, playing 17 games including the last 15 in a row. He averaged 16 disposals per game, playing on the wing and at half-forward.

He established the New England Museum in 1818. Biography Greenwood was born in Hubbardston, Massachusetts to Moses Greenwood and Betsy Dunlap, May 27, 1779. He attended school at the Academy at New Salem, and the Leicester Academy. In 1806 he graduated from Dartmouth College. He also studied at West Point. Between 1801 and 1825, Greenwood produced many portraits, perhaps as many as 800 works. He utilized the physiognotrace technique. He kept a studio in Boston circa 1813 and associated with other artists, including Gilbert Stuart. He joined the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company in 1814. He married Mrs. Caroline Carter Warren of Roxbury, Massachusetts in 1829. After the deaths of his parents he built a large house on their land and he became active in the public and business affairs of Hubbardston. Throughout his life, Greenwood kept a diary. On reviewing some of the diary entries, one scholar observed he \\"each day recorded both the weather and the title of the book he was reading ... and occasionally noted the library from which the volume was borrowed‚Äîthe Adelphi Fraternity Library, the Social Friends Library [of Dartmouth College], or the unnamed circulating library he joined in 1806.\\" His diaries now reside in the collection of the American Antiquarian Society.

Mandel is the national record holder (2014) in 50- and 100-meter butterfly. Mandel won the 100-meter butterfly at the 2009 Maccabiah Games and still holds the record in that event. Biography Mandel was born in the United States and was raised in Netanya, Israel. He has a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the University of Michigan, a master's degree in environmental engineering from Tel Aviv University, and another master's degree in political science from Tel Aviv University as well. Mandel started swimming at age 6 and began training at the club Hapoel Emek Hefer. Initially he raced in backstroke, and set records for youth in both the 50- and 100-meter backstroke. In 2006, at age 18, Alon was recognized as an athletic prodigy, and postponed his mandatory army service in order to study chemical engineering at the University of Michigan in parallel to training with the varsity men's swim team at the University of Michigan, along with Michael Phelps and his coach, Bob Bowman. During his training in Michigan, Alon switched his primary stroke from backstroke to butterfly, although he kept competing in backstroke for the University of Michigan.

Ritchie plays a publicist observing and interacting on the story of Daisy Cockram, a police officer catapulted to fame after she is arrested for public indecency with a footballer in the back of a car and who becomes a national celebrity, which is soon shown to have many pitfalls. The moral of the story being \\"be careful what you wish for\\". It was first aired on ITV & UTV on Sunday 26 July 2009. Plot JJ Merrick (Ritchie) is narrating the story of Daisy Cockram who is about to be \\"devoured by the venus flytrap of fame\\" after winning tickets to attend a premi√®re when she meets a leading professional footballer who seduces her. Shortly afterwards they are discovered having sexual intercourse in the back of a car by a police patrol officer and taken in. This is particularly embarrassing for Daisy as she is herself a police officer - and she is fast suspended from duty for bringing the force into disrepute. The tabloid newspapers speedily track Daisy down using various underhand methods and she is soon splashed across the front pages of the media, with many lurid and exaggerated details about her life. It is at this point that she approached by JJ Merrick, who offers to represent her and help her out. She is hoping he will be able to hold the press off, so that she can appeal against her dismissal from the police, but he insists that is impossible once the media has scented blood. Instead he impresses on her the need to get her side of the story across. He sets up a major deal with a Sunday Newspaper, and arranges a photo-shoot where a number of glamour shots are taken with Daisy taking provocative poses. At first she is withdrawn and uncomfortable, but soon relaxes and proves to be a natural in front of the camera. As Merrick had predicted, the kiss-and-tell article proves a major success, launching Daisy into the spotlight. However it leads to an angry row with her father, a senior police officer, who considers her \\"a slut\\" and is hurt at how her behaviour has undermined people's respect for him. Her sister is not as angry as father, but she is also made unhappy by the new public persona of Daisy. Daisy is distressed by her family's reaction, but it does not change her interest in pursuing a new career as a celebrity. Her management by JJ Merrick helps her to scale new heights in the celebrity world, where her freshness help propel her upwards. JJ has become increasingly cynical about his profession, yet he manages to successfully bury his misgivings and has moved to the top of his game. He revels in his own invisibility, he is unknown to the public at large which gives him enormous power. He visits her a year later remarking \\"if a week is a long time in politics, a year is a lifetime in showbuisness\\". He is paying a visit to Daisy who has now changed completely beyond recognition. She has moved from her dingy tower-block flat to a large country mansion, has had numerous plastic surgery operations and is now dating a leading soap actor. Daisy now has a seemingly \\"perfect life\\", in which she has become a sexual icon - an idol for many teenage girls, lots of money and a large personal staff. She has ambitions to launch a singing career as well. She is able to pick up large fees just for turning up for public appearances. However the first cracks begin to appear in her life - pictures of her having sex are being sold to the newspapers, she has not had an invite to her sister‚Äôs wedding and she is finally pictured snorting cocaine. This provokes a howl of condemnation of her from the media, led by a hatchet-job article written by a leading left-wing journalist from the leading broadsheets. On the advice of Merrick, she stages an overdose and then goes to a private hospital to recover. As Merrick had intended this stokes public interest and gains her a deal of sympathy. However shortly afterwards a rival appears on the scene who steals the show from Daisy. Kaitlin now has a fresh face, and natural breasts, and she is fast elbowing Daisy aside. Merrick knowing that celebrity is merely a carousel promptly signs up Kaitlin and makes her his new prot√©g√© - effectively abandoning Daisy. He tells her she has had a good run, made several million pounds with no discernible talent - and should get out of showbuisness while she still could with some sort of humanity left inside. Instead of Daisy taking his advice, she instead stages an orgy with the soap actor and releases it to the press, in a last attempt to claw back some public interest, showing as Merrick had observed that she has become totally addicted to celebrity.

Biography Boyd graduated from T. C. Williams High School in Alexandria, Virginia, where he was a defensive lineman on the football team. He married his girlfriend, Sabrina, who converted to Islam hours before their wedding. Boyd worked in construction before moving to Peshawar, Pakistan, in October 1989. He was sponsored by a Muslim relief group to help refugees from the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan by working as a mechanic. He trained with the mujahideen and fought against the Soviet-backed forces in Afghanistan.Associated Press. \\"7 N.C. Men Charged With Terror Plot\\" New York Times July 28, 2009. He took the Muslim name Saifullah (\\"Sword of God\\"). In June 1991, Boyd and his brother Charles (also a Muslim convert, working as an engineer in Pakistan) were accused of robbing a branch of United Bank in Hayatabad, a Peshawar suburb. It was also alleged that they carried Hezb-e- Islami Gulbuddin membership cards. In September 1991, a special Islamic court convicted the brothers, who were sentenced to fines, prison terms, and amputation of their right hands and left feet. As the sentence was handed down, Daniel Boyd shouted, \\"This isn't an Islamic court. It's a court of infidels!\\" After their convictions, they worked in a prison factory, making carpets and chairs. In October 1991, an appeals court overturned the conviction. The case made international headlines. Boyd maintained his innocence at the time and asserted that it was all a malicious set-up by a bank employee who had made inappropriate advances toward his wife and had tried to pilfer money from the family. Returning to the US, Boyd raised his family of five children: sons Dylan, Zakariya, Luqman, and Noah, and daughter Maryam. In July 2004, the Boyds formed Saxum Walls & Ceilings Inc; in April 2007, the family suffered the loss of Luqman \\"Luke\\" Izzudeen Boyd, then 16, in a car accident. Late in 2007, Boyd opened Blackstone Market in Garner with business partner Abdenasser Zouhri of Morrisville. A Mediterranean grocery, it offered halal meat and snacks, copies of the Qur'an in English and Arabic, and a place to worship in the back. The store closed in 2008, reportedly due to the recession. Boyd was arrested by Federal agents along with seven men in North Carolina on July 27, 2009. They were charged with plotting to wage \\"violent jihad\\" outside the United States. Boyd was accused of recruiting six men, including two of his sons, to take part in a conspiracy \\"to advance violent jihad, including supporting and participating in terrorist activities abroad and committing acts of murder, kidnapping, or maiming persons abroad.\\" According to the indictment, members of the group practiced military tactics and the use of weapons in rural North Carolina, and traveled to Gaza, Israel, Jordan, and Kosovo hoping \\"to engage in violent jihad.\\" Muslim community members and supporters in North Carolina have been active for him and his co- defendants, and some non-Muslim neighbors and acquaintances in particular have spoken in his defense. A July 30, 2009 CBS news headline about Daniel Boyd is entitled \\"The Nicest Terrorist I Ever Met,\\" with the subtitle: \\"Friends, Colleagues and Pakistani Jailers Describe N. Carolina Terror Suspect as Kind, Devoted Muslim.\\"Associated Press. \\"The Nicest Terrorist I Ever Met \\". cbsnews.com Retrieved October 5, 2010. The headline is a quote from Boyd's neighbor Charles Casale: \\"If he's a terrorist, he's the nicest terrorist I ever met in my life, [...] I don't think he is.\\" Boyd's older brother Robert Boyd, a practicing Muslim, said the charges sound \\"like another attempt to associate Islam with terrorism\\" and the accusations \\"they're trying to pin on him is pure poppycock as far as I am concerned.\\" Boyd's wife, Sabrina Boyd, has given interviews and written statements professing the Boyds' innocence. Khalilah Sabra, of the Muslim American Society, spoke at a press conference calling on the public not \\"to rush to judgment\\", and specifically addressing allegations of terrorist training in Afghanistan, writing that \\"He was there fighting against the Soviets with the full backing of the United States government, [...] I think he thought it was part of his patriotic duty as a Muslim and an American to go there and fight.\\" At Boyd's August 5 detention hearing, at least 100 supporters (relatives, friends, and acquaintances) were in attendance at the federal courthouse in Raleigh; some expressed the belief that the defendants had not violated the law. On February 9, 2011 at the United States District Court in New Bern, North Carolina, Daniel Patrick Boyd pleaded guilty to two counts of the Second Superseding Indictment: conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists, and conspiracy to commit murder, maiming, and kidnapping overseas. The second count carries a potential life sentence. The government agreed to dismiss nine counts against him in exchange for his plea and cooperation against the remaining defendants. Ultimately, Boyd cooperated with the government, as noted by federal prosecutors during the sentencing hearing on August 24, 2012. After pleading guilty to two counts of the superseding indictment in 2011, Boyd testified at trial against several of his co-conspirators who were convicted in October 2011.

Maintaining a high profile for its excellent education, the school was closed for a time during the 1989 civil war. Two nuns, Sister Agnes and Sister Shirley, reopened the school.

It owns and operates Expocentre Fairgrounds, an exhibition venue located in the Central Administrative Area of Moscow (near Vystavochnaya and Delovoi Tsentr metro stations) on the Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment between the Moscow International Business Center and the World Trade Center. The company is headquartered in Moscow.  Company history  In 1959 Sokolniki Park in Moscow hosted the first national exhibition of US industrial products, opened by Nikita Khrushchev and Richard Nixon. From the Soviet side, the show had been coordinated by the Department for Foreign Exhibitions of the USSR Chamber of Commerce. The Department was later turned into the Agency for International and Foreign Exhibitions in USSR. Soon after the American exhibition, national trade shows of Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia and other countries were staged in the Soviet Union. In 1964 Expocentre produced its first international trade show called Stroidormash (the Road-Building Machinery Show) which put on display the latest road-building machinery and equipment. The statistics of that first show were as follows: 377 exhibiting companies from 20 countries showcased their most advanced equipment and technology on the show floor of 54,000 m2. It had been co-organized by the National Committee for Construction, Road-Building and Utilities Engineering under the USSR Ministry of Construction. Among numerous exhibitions put on in 1960s and 1970s there were some that deserve special attention including the Chemistry International Specialized Exhibition, whose first edition was produced in 1965 on the initiative of Leonid Kostandov, the then Minister of Chemical Industry of the Soviet Union. The Chemistry exhibition was the first to get the Approved Event Logo of the Global Association of the Exhibition Industry (UFI), in 1975. The Chemistry show was followed by other events: Svyaz-Expocomm (telecommunications), Lesdrevmash (timber and woodworking machinery), Electro (power and electrical engineering), Neftegaz (oil and gas sector), Inlegmash (textile manufacturing and processing) and many others. The growing number of exhibitions required more exhibition floor space and resources. So, in mid 1970s on the initiative of Nikolai Patolichev, the then USSR Foreign Trade Minister, the USSR Chamber of Commerce suggested to the Government that a modern exhibition centre should be built on the bank of the Moskva River next to Kransaya Presnya Park. The first pavilion was erected in 1977, and as early as in January 1978 it hosted a major trade show Derevoobrabotka (woodworking). 1980s saw a rapid construction of the venue. Soon after Pavilion No. 1 had been built, Pavilions No. 2 and No. 3 were put into operation together with the Forum Pavilion - a unique structure in the form of a glass pyramid. In the subsequent years the venue continued expanding - Pavilions No. 4, 5, and 6 were put up. In 2002 Pavilion No. 7 - a two-level exhibition pavilion with fully flexible halls - opened its doors, which enabled Expocentre to boost its conference business so it has reached an entirely new level quality-wise. In 2007 Pavilion No. 8 was built offering meeting rooms and a conference hall with excellent acoustics. In 2014 Expocentre marks its 55th anniversary.  Company name  The company name Expocentre was registered in 1977, as the Agency for International and Foreign Exhibitions in USSR had been turned into the Expocentre Company (a National Company since 1980). Back then, Expocentre was the only company in the Soviet Union entitled to stage international and foreign exhibitions in the country.  History of company creation  * In 1945 a new committee was set up within the USSR Chamber of Trade. It was called a Standing Committee on Exhibitions, and in 1947 on its basis a Department for Foreign Exhibitions (the Exhibitions Department since 1949) was established. * In 1960 the Exhibitions Department was changed into the Agency for Exhibitions with two subdivisions: the Department for Soviet Exhibitions Abroad and the Department of Foreign Exhibitions in the Soviet Union. * In 1964 the Department for Foreign Exhibitions was turned into the Agency for Foreign Exhibitions in USSR and the Soviet Exhibitions Department - into the Agency for Soviet Exhibitions Abroad. * In 1969 the USSR Chamber of Commerce set up the Agency for International and Foreign Exhibitions consisting of the Department for Foreign Exhibitions, Department for International Exhibitions and other units. Such division was dictated by a new trend when, in addition to exhibitions conducted in the USSR on the initiative of other countries and private companies, universal international exhibitions began to be held there. * In 1972 the USSR Chamber of Commerce became the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. * In 1977 the Expocentre Association was set up from the Agency for International and Foreign Exhibitions as part of the USSR Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The Department for Soviet Exhibitions Abroad existed till 1989 and then merged into Expocentre. * In 1991, when the national economy was going through reforms, Expocentre became a joint stock company.  Exhibitions and congresses: prospects  Expocentre has nine exhibition pavilions, and multifunctional halls for congresses, press conferences, symposia and seminars. The total area of Expocentre Fairgrounds is 250,000 m2, where 165,000 m2 is exhibition floor space (105,000 m2 indoor and 60,000 m2 outdoor space). Annually Expocentre Fairgrounds hosts around 100 international exhibitions, which draw nearly 2,000,000 specialists; and holds over 800 congresses, symposia and conferences.

Expocentre is also a member of the Guild of Exhibition and Trade Fair Organizers of Moscow Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The company renders support to regional exhibition companies by sharing its broad experience and expertise in order to promote the development of exhibition business around Russia. * In 1978 Expocentre joined the InterEXPO - the Association of organisers of exhibitions abroad and of national group participations in international trade fairs and exhibitions. * With its meeting business developing successfully, the company was admitted to the International Association of Convention Centres (AIPC) in 2005 and the International Congress and Conference Association (ICCA) in 2006. * Expocentre delivers its trade shows and meeting events to the highest industry standards, which enabled the company to join the International Federation of Exhibition and Event Services (IFES) in 2011. * The venue was the first of the Central and Eastern European exhibition centre to be admitted to the European Major Exhibition Centres Association (EMECA), in 2012. * Director General of Expocentre ZAO is Sergei Bednov, who, apart from being a top manager of the Global Association of the Exhibition Industry (UFI) and the Russian Union of Exhibitions and Fairs (RUEF), became a member of the European Major Exhibition Centres Association (EMECA) Management Team in 2012.

Historically a mƒõstys was a locality which had the right to stage livestock markets (and some other \\"extraordinary\\" and annual markets), and it is therefore often translated as \\"market town\\". The term went out of official use in Czechoslovakia in 1954, but was reintroduced in the Czech Republic in 2006. As of September 2020, there are 228 municipalities on which the status of mƒõstys has been conferred. Historical development of mƒõstys in the Czech Republic=Middle Ages and early modern period= The development of the mƒõsteƒçko began in the 14th century, decreed by the reigning monarch primarily on the land of the nobility and church. From the 16th century on, it became possible for settlements with significant springs to get the title mƒõstys. The village then became entitled to call itself \\"mƒõstec\\", resulting in such place names as Mƒõstec Kr√°lov√© and He≈ôman≈Øv Mƒõstec. The typical mƒõsteƒçko was very small, and a large number were created during the 14th century. Eduard Maur estimated that the average distance between two mƒõsteƒçka was 5‚Äì20 km. =Early 20th century= After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the status was conferred by the Ministerial Council on the basis of a detailed application from the village. According to the \\"Statistick√Ω lexikon obc√≠ v Republice ƒçeskoslovensk√©\\" (Statistical lexicon of villages in Czechoslovakia), there were 503 mƒõstys in Czechoslovakia in 1930. After the coup d'√©tat of February 1948, the Communist ruling authorities ceased using the term by around 1950. =Late 20th century revival= After the Velvet Revolution of 1989, there was intense lobbying for the revival of the mƒõstys status from the representatives of villages which had previously held the title. On 27 January 2006 their efforts succeeded; the Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic approved an amendment to the Municipalities Act (Establishment of Municipalities) , which amongst other matters restored the title of mƒõstys. The amendment was approved by the Senate of the Czech Republic on 29 March, was signed by the president on 11 May and came into force on 1 July 2006. Municipalities that had the right to carry the title of mƒõstys prior to 17 May 1954 are to inform the chairman of the Chamber of Deputies, so that the restoration of the status can be arranged. On 10 October 2006, the chairman of the Chamber of Deputies announced the first 108 municipalities which can continue to use the title. Similar designations in other countries Many other countries in Europe have similar designations, for example: * Hungary and Slovakia: the Latin title oppidum; from 14th century to 1871 also - lit. \\"field town\\" * Austria: . In other German-speaking areas the terms Flecken, Marktflecken and Markt are also used. * Denmark: * Sweden: * France: Mƒõstyse also existed on the territory of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and before Communism these municipalities often used the terms: (mestechko) (mistechko) * (shtetl) A very approximate equivalent to this title in the former USSR was the \\"urban-type settlement\\" (, , ). The criteria for awarding this title differed greatly between members of the federation, and still do in Russia to this day. This category also existed in Poland between 1954 and 1972 ().
