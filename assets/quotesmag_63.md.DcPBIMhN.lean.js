The facility was built as a resort hotel, and housed Union veterans of the American Civil War prior to being converted to a veterans hospital. It was the first veterans facility developed by the United States government. Togus Springs Hotel Springs on the site were originally described by Native Americans as \\"worromontogus\\" (sometimes translated as \\"place of the mineral spring\\").Jones (1999) p.4 The 134-room Togus Springs Hotel was built on the site in 1858 by Rockland granite dealer Horace Beals. Beals constructed a stable, large pool, bathing house, race track, and bowling alley on the site in an effort to duplicate the success of the Poland Spring Hotel. Beal's investment of one-quarter-million dollars failed to attract the anticipated number of visitors, and the facility closed when receipts failed to cover expenses.

Two-hundred-seventy residents were displaced by a fire in a main building on January 7, 1868. Three 3-story brick dormitories and an amusement hall recreation building were built in 1868. Togus resembled a military establishment where the men wore surplus blue army uniforms and were subject to military discipline including confinement in the guardhouse for infractions of the rules.Jones (1999) p.6 The residents signed over their federal pension in return for their care. Those who were able to work could earn money working at the shops or farms raising much of the food consumed at Togus. Three Holstein dairy cattle were imported from the Netherlands in 1871 to form the first registered herd of the breed in Maine.Jones (1999) pp.8‚Äì9 In 1872 the name was changed to the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers.Jones (1999) pp.4‚Äì5 New buildings included a bakery, a butcher shop, a blacksmith shop, a brickyard, a boot and shoe factory, a carpentry shop, a fire station, a harness shop, a library, a sawmill, a soap works, a store, and an opera house theatre.Jones (1999) pp.5‚Äì6 President Ulysses S.

Togus became a popular recreation center for civilians from the surrounding area.

Special military ceremonies were held on Memorial Day, Flag Day, and Independence Day.Jones (1999) p.9 Veterans Administration hospital Additional buildings were constructed to convert the site to a Veterans Administration hospital. The facilities, along with the adjacent Togus National Cemetery, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. The Governor's House, the oldest building in the complex and the oldest veteran-related facility in the country, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1973.

Between 1948 and 1956 he worked as a professor of philosophy and theology in Mosul. On October 6, 1957, at the age of 35, he was ordained Bishop of Amadiya, by Patriarch Yousef VII Ghanima, becoming the youngest Catholic bishop in the world.http://www.britannica.com/biography/Raphael-I-Bidawid As bishop of Amadiya he experienced the mass exodus of Christians from Northern Iraq. Mar Raphael Bidawid was then appointed bishop of Beirut in 1966 and served in this capacity for 23 years. On March 21, 1989 Raphael I Bidawid was elected Patriarch of Babylon, head of the Chaldean Catholic Church. His election was confirmed by Pope John Paul II in June 1989. During his Patriarchate, Patriarch Bidawid, in agreement with the Chaldean Synod, established The Pontifical Babel College for Philosophy and Theology in 1991. The Babel College is situated in Baghdad, Dora, El-Mekaniek, next to St. Peter Chaldean Seminary. The Babel College became an instrumental educational institution for the Chaldean Church.Chaldean Patriarchate of Babylon Pontifical Babel College For Philosophy and Theology Patriarch Bidawid could speak 13 languages. He died in Beirut, Lebanon on July 7, 2003, at the age of 81.  Pastoral Work  Patriarch Bidawid was known as a champion of the unification of the Assyrian Church of the East (formerly the Church of the East) and the Chaldean Catholic Church, which split in 1552 AD. In November 1996 Mar Dinkha IV of the Assyrian Church of the East and Chaldean Patriarch Raphael I Bidawid met in Southfield, Michigan, and signed a Joint Patriarchal Statement that committed their two churches to working towards reintegration and pledged cooperation on pastoral questions such as the drafting of a common catechism, the setting up of a common seminary in the Chicago-Detroit area, the preservation of the Aramaic language, and other common pastoral programs between parishes and dioceses around the world. On August 15, 1997, the two Patriarchs met again, in Roselle, Illinois, and ratified a ‚ÄúJoint Synodal Decree for Promoting Unity,‚Äù that had been signed by the members of both Holy Synods. It restated the areas of pastoral cooperation envisaged in the Joint Patriarchal Statement, recognized that Assyrians and Chaldeans should come to accept each other's diverse practices as legitimate, formally implemented the establishment of an Assyrian-Chaldean ‚ÄúJoint Commission for Unity,‚Äù and declared that each side recognized the apostolic succession, sacraments and Christian witness of the other. The text also spelled out the central concerns of both sides in the dialogue. While both churches wanted to preserve the Aramaic language and culture, the Assyrians were intent on retaining their freedom and self-governance, and the Chaldeans affirmed the necessity of maintaining full communion with Rome.CNEWA page on The Assyrian Church of the East. http://www.cnewa.org/default.aspx?ID=1&pagetypeID;=9&sitecode;=HQ&pageno;=3 In an interview with Bidawid, published in 2003, he commented on the Assyrian name dispute and declared his ethnic point of view: :‚ÄúI personally think that these different names serve to add confusion. The original name of our Church was the ‚ÄòChurch of the East‚Äô ... When a portion of the Church of the East became Catholic, the name given was ‚ÄòChaldean‚Äô based on the Magi kings who came from the land of the Chaldean, to Bethlehem. The name ‚ÄòChaldean‚Äô does not represent an ethnicity... We have to separate what is ethnicity and what is religion... I myself, my sect is Chaldean, but ethnically, I am Assyrian.‚Äù In an interview with the Assyrian Star in the September‚ÄìOctober 1974 issue, he was quoted as saying: :‚ÄúBefore I became a priest I was an Assyrian, before I became a bishop I was an Assyrian, I am an Assyrian today, tomorrow, forever, and I am proud of it.‚ÄùMar Raphael J Bidawid.

After immigration laws were eased in the mid-1960s, many stores moved to Stockton Street from nearby Grant Avenue, drawn by lower rents and the better transportation enabled by the 30-Stockton Muni trolleybus line (which replaced the earlier F Stockton streetcar line). The San Francisco Chronicle has called the section of Stockton Street between Sacramento and Broadway \\"San Francisco‚Äôs most interesting street ... fascinating [but] not beautiful. It‚Äôs crowded, untidy, dirty, usually noisy.\\" The completion of the Central Subway is anticipated to bring major changes to the street's character. Union Square In the Union Square area, Stockton Street is home to numerous upscale stores, including the Macy's West flagship and Neiman Marcus department stores. The block next to Macy's has been closed to road traffic since 2012 due to the Central Subway construction work, with the success of a temporary \\"Winter Walk\\" plaza lending support for calls to convert it into a pedestrian zone permanently. In 2016 (shortly before her death), influential Chinatown community organizer Rose Pak vehemently opposed this project arguing that Stockton Street was a \\"vital link\\" for Chinatown, and threatened to organize a blockade of City Hall by thousands of vehicles if the idea came to pass. Stockton reopened to road traffic on February 22, 2019. Other notable landmarks Near the Northern tip of the street, the Academy of Art University owns and operates a building for academic and administrative purposes.

Membership in the association was obligatory for everyone in the German Reich who wanted to work on films in any capacity; lack of membership meant in effect a ban on employment. Based in Berlin, the establishment of the RFK was an important element of the Gleichschaltung process and Nazi film policy.  History  The predecessor of the RFK was the Spitzenorganisation der Filmwirtschaft (SPIO; English: \\"Film Industry Summit Organisation\\") founded by Erich Pommer in 1923. Established as an interest group of film producers, the association was dissolved after the Nazi seizure of power and re-established in West Germany in 1950. The Reichsfilmkammer was established on the basis of the Gesetz √ºber die Errichtung einer vorl√§ufigen Filmkammer (\\"Law for the Establishment of a Temporary Film Chamber\\") of 14 July 1933. Under the Reichskulturkammergesetz (\\"Law of the Reich Culture Chamber\\") of 22 September 1933 the Film Chamber was integrated as a subdivision of the newly founded Reich Chamber of Culture (Reichskulturkammer) corporation. The establishment of the RFK was preceded by an ordinance of the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, which prohibited Jews and foreigners from any participation in the German film industry. The RFK edited the journal Film-Kurier, a leading film magazine founded in 1919 and \\"aryanized\\" in 1933. In addition, the most popular Illustrierter Film-Kurier programmes were sold in the German cinemas million fold. The Reichsfilmkammer was officially dissolved by Law no. 2 passed by the Allied Control Council on 10 October 1945; the \\"Law for the Establishment of a Temporary Film Chamber\\" was repealed by Allied Control Council Law no. 60 on 19 December 1947.  Functions  The Reichsfilmkammer had a key role in the film-related politics of Nazi propaganda. Its mission was principally: * the establishment of compulsory control over all those active in any aspect of film production (production, distribution, cinema) organised in the Reichsfachschaft Film (RFF); * the regulation of the cinema industry (e.g., admission prices, composition of programs, advertising and so on) * the regulation of contracts, for example between filmmakers and film producers, or between theatre owners and tenants * supervision of the Film Credit Bank (Filmkreditbank GmbH, FKB) for the financing of projects * regulation of film exports  Direction  The presidents of the Reichsfilmkammer reporting directly to the Reich Chamber of Culture, chaired by Minister Joseph Goebbels, were as follows: * Fritz Scheuermann, lawyer, (1933‚Äì1935) * Oswald Lehnich, also economics minister in W√ºrttemberg (1935‚Äì1939) * Carl Froelich, film director (1939‚Äì1945) Members of the Presidential Council (Pr√§sidialrat) were, among others: Karl Ritter, Karl Hartl, Carl Auen, and Theodor Loos. The RFK had branches in Breslau, D√ºsseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, K√∂nigsberg, Leipzig, Munich, and Vienna.

The term \\"pantelism\\" comes from the Greek œÄŒ±ŒΩœÑŒµŒªŒÆœÇ \\"all accomplished,\\" and means \\"all things having been accomplished\\". Pantelism has a similar \\"inclusive\\" approach to that of Transmillennialism. Pantelism is an extension of Preterism. The difference from preterism is that pantelism views Israel's prophesied redemption in Christ as the catalyst for mankind's restoration to God. Some Christians view people being as \\"born lost,\\" while others would say merely that each person sins; they must therefore profess personal faith in Jesus Christ to escape judgment when they die. The majority of Christians hold the modern traditional viewpoint about Hell as the final abode of the wicked. Although some preterists accept Hell as a metaphor for judgment,http://oneinjesus.info/2008/08/surprised-by-hope-eternal-destruction/ and while Full Preterists view the \\"judgement of the lake of fire\\" in Revelation as referring to the destruction of Jerusalem in the year AD 70, Pantelists believe both of these things, as well as holding to a specific soteriology: With the Old Covenant system of law and judgment ended (see Abrogation of Old Covenant laws), redemption came to Israel. As a consequence, reconciliation then spread to all humankind. Pantelism understands this inclusive reconciliation, as distinct from Israel's redemption, as the unilateral act of God and not reliant on a professed personal faith in Jesus Christ. Pantelism further acknowledges that \\"faith in Christ\\" was the prerequisite and basis for those called to serve God on behalf of others. Because of the inclusive nature of pantelism and that it accepts the authority of the Bible some view it as a form of Christian universalism, with some referring to it as a \\"universalist version of full preterism.\\" There are significant aspects of pantelism also agreeing with universalism's antithesis \\"partialism\\". For example, pantelism is evangelical in nature‚Äîin order to focus people on their hope and on their responsibilities in this life; typical universalism holds that there is no need to spread a specific message (about Jesus) since a loving God condemns no one and all paths of searching lead to life.

High school Powell led Apex High School in Apex, North Carolina to the 2000 4-A state championship as a junior. Because he was already 18 years old, he was eligible to enter the 2000 Major League Baseball Draft and did so. However, he went undrafted because his agent, Scott Boras, did not inform teams he was available.http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/highschool/050302hsnotes.html This made Powell a free agent, but he chose to attend college after failing to receive an acceptable offer from an MLB club.

Taking possession of Confederate Navy assets  On 1 June Gamage entered the mouth of Red River to form with a joint expedition up that river to receive surrendered Confederate ships and men. The Union naval force of eight steamers under command of Lt. Comdr. W. E. Fitzhugh was accompanied by Army steamer Ida May, carrying Major General F. J. Herron and his staff. Arriving Alexandria, Louisiana, 2 June, Commander Fitzhugh took possession of Confederate ironclad Missouri and proceeded up river to Shreveport, Louisiana, in Gamage. There he seized the steamer Cotton and supplies at the Navy storehouse and on the 8th departed for the mouth of the river. At the request of General Herron, Gamage remained at Alexandria, Louisiana, to assist the Army as needed until 27 June when she departed for Natchez, Mississippi, arriving 7 July.  Post-war decommissioning, sale, and subsequent career  Gamage reached Mound City, Illinois, from Natchez 22 July. She decommissioned on the 29th and was sold at public auction 17 August 1865 to J. R. Griffith for $11,000. She was redocumented as merchant steamer Southern Belle 4 October 1865 and burned 11 October 1876 at Plaquemine, Louisiana.

It was the first sorority founded by African- American women. She went on to earn a Master's in Philosophy at Columbia University in New York. Holmes devoted her energies to teaching academic, or college preparatory, curriculum at the high school level for more than thirty years, mostly in Chicago, Illinois. She was voted \\"Best Latin Teacher\\" in the entire city. There Holmes distinguished herself further by leading the history department at Du Sable High School for several years, an unusual leadership role for any woman in those times. In addition, Holmes served as president and vice-president of the Theta Omega chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha in Chicago, where she was active for more than 30 years in programs for education and health. She also was active with the NAACP and the YWCA. Margaret Holmes demonstrated in her work as an educator and civic activist how African- American sororities supported women \\"to create spheres of influence, authority and power within institutions that traditionally have allowed African Americans and women little formal authority and real power.\\"Tamara L. Brown, Gregory Parks, Clarenda M. Phillips, African American Fraternities and Sororities: The Legacy and the Vision. Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 2005. p. 342. Early life Born in Durham, North Carolina to Reverend Lewis and Callie McAdoo Flagg, Margaret Flagg attended elementary school in the city's public school system. After her family moved to Washington, D.C., Margaret attended M Street High School (later called Dunbar High School), one of the city's academic high schools, where she graduated in 1904. Her ability was recognized by Howard University with the award of a scholarship. Flagg's ambition and abilities were demonstrated by her going to Howard at a time when only 1/3 of 1% of African Americans and 5% of whites of eligible age attended any college.James D. Anderson, The Education of Blacks in the South, 1860‚Äì1935. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina, 1988, p.245 Howard was the top historically black college in the nation. College life and the establishment of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority In September 1904, Margaret started at Howard University, where she majored in Latin, history, and English. With Ethel Hedgeman and Lavinia Norman, Margaret helped to plan the sorority by refining their first constitution, drafted by Lucy Diggs Slowe. She was among the nine African American women students who founded the sorority on January 15, 1908. Career At a time when many women taught primary school, Margaret Holmes earned advanced degrees and taught in academic high schools. In addition, she headed an academic department for years. For nine years, Flagg served as a history, Latin and English teacher at the same Baltimore high school as fellow founder Lucy Diggs Slowe. By studying during summers, Flagg earned a Master of Arts degree in philosophy in 1917 from Columbia University in New York. On August 1, 1917, Flagg married John Clay Holmes. The couple moved to Chicago, Illinois, where she returned to teaching in 1922. Holmes first taught Latin at Wendell Phillips High School, the first secondary school for African Americans in Chicago. It attracted talented teachers and students. Holmes earned recognition as \\"Best Latin Teacher of the City\\" by the North Central Association. As the school expanded, it was renamed Du Sable High School. Margaret Holmes headed the history department for several years, until 1931. Such a position of leadership at the high school level was unusual for women educators of the time. Holmes was an educator for more than 30 years, until 1953, teaching generations of students. Civic and Alpha Kappa Alpha involvement In Chicago, Margaret Holmes participated in the NAACP and the YWCA. Through her civic work relating to civil rights, Holmes collaborated with national NAACP leaders Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois, Mary White Ovington, and Dr. Joel Elias Spingarn. For more than thirty years, from 1922 to 1953, Margaret Holmes was active in Chicago's Theta Omega alumnae chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha. She served as the vice-president and president of the chapter. Both the chapter and national organization raised funds in the 1920s and 1930s for scholarships, and contributed to the NAACP and Urban League. Theta Omega Chapter, AKA Retrieved December 10, 2007. They worked to support education for African Americans and gain civil rights. Holmes helped serve the African American community through challenges of the Great Depression and the Great Migration, when Southern blacks arrived in Chicago at the rate of 5,000 per week.Nicholas Lemann, The Promised Land: The Great Migration and How It Changed America. New York: Vintage Books, 1992 After her move later in life to New York, Holmes became a member of the Tau Omega chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha. In total, she worked with the sorority nearly seventy years to build social capital. With her husband John, Margaret traveled across the United States and Canada. In Paris, France, Margaret met the famous African American dancer Josephine Baker. The Holmes couple were received by Pope Pius XI in 1931. After her husband died in 1946, Margaret Holmes moved to New York City to live with her sister. Holmes died on January 29, 1976.

The town is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Hudson Bay No. 394.  History  In 1757, a fur trading post was established in the Hudson Bay District beside the Red Deer River. Ruins from the post have been found near the village of Erwood. In 1790, the North West Trading Company set up a trading post at the mouth of the Etomami River. Speculators think that a South Company's post was set up on the opposite mouth of the River, where there are remains of a second post unaccounted for. Over the years a settlement grew and, in July 1907, an application was made to erect Etomami as a village. (Etomami was a native word that meant \\"a place that three rivers join.\\" However, to establish a hamlet needed fifteen occupied dwelling houses. By August, the list was completed and the village was formed. Mr. B.F. Noble was the first \\"overseer\\" of the village. The post office was also established at that time. It was located on the 100 block of Churchill Street. Then, in 1909, the Canadian Northern Railway Company chose the name Hudson Bay Junction and so the name was changed. During the early years, many difficulties were encountered in trying to maintain the village. It was even suggested at one time that it be disorganized but, as time moved on, things improved and the town continued to grow. The town was incorporated in 1946 and at the first council meeting, which was held in 1947, the town's name was shortened by dropping \\"Junction\\". In 1958, parking meters were introduced on Churchill Street although they have long since vanished. That year, the town switched to Mountain Standard Time but, less than two months later, decided to revert to Central Standard Time. The Hudson Bay School Building is a registered municipal heritage property. Originally built in 1910 to house the composite school, it was built as a four-room schoolhouse out of cement block in a Georgian Classicism/American Colonial style. Today, the building houses the Hudson Bay Museum.http://heritageapp.cyr.gov.sk.ca/assets/pdf/1668.pdf Saskatchewan Register of Heritage Property Database Entry for the Hudson Bay School Building  Demographics   Economy  Hudson Bay has a diverse economy based on forestry, agriculture, processing and eco-tourism. Forestry has continued to be the major source of employment and economic generator over the years, and its community has shown itself to be capable of supporting existing world class industries in the production of plywood and oriented strand board. In 1979 Hudson Bay earned the title of Forestry Capital of Canada. In addition, with the abundance of wildlife in the area, it has also become known as the Moose Capital of the World. The vast tracts of untouched wilderness enable visitors to enjoy year round recreational pursuits. The nutrient rich soils which surround Hudson Bay have enabled farmers to produce a wide range of crops on over .  Railway  Today Hudson Bay is still a major junction with the railway running in three directions, and the highway running in all four directions. Via Rail provides scheduled passenger service at the Hudson Bay railway station.  Wood products  Wizewood Products Ltd. established Canada's first waferboard plant in September 1961, this was taken over by MacMillan Bloedel and Powell River (Saskatchewan) Ltd. in 1965, followed by a $4 Million dollar expansion in 1968‚Äì69 making it the largest particle board complex in Canada. A $14.8 million expansion followed in 1983, and by 1995 the plant was operating as a joint venture between Macmillan Bloedel and Saskatchewan Forest Products Corporation (SFPC) under the name SaskFor. When SaskFor opened the new oriented strand board mill, the old waferboard plant was shut down. In 1999 Macmillan Bloedel bought-out its part taking over full control of SaskFor, that same year Macmillan Bloedel was taken over by Weyerhaeuser. Wood products continue to play an important role in the local economy with both Weyerhaeuser and C&C; Wood Products operating within the area.http://www.gov.sk.ca/news?newsId=6fe7f82c-74d2-4cc7-ac55-5a410ef1a3bf  Agriculture  Alfalfa is grown within the valley. Then dehydrated, it yields over 10,000 tonnes of alfalfa pellets annually for local sales and export. Wheat, Barley and Canola are also grown in the area.  Coal  On May 8, 2008 a major coal discovery by Goldsource Mines Inc. (www.goldsourcemines.com) sparked a land rush for coal prospecting permits. There have been many successful drill programs by such companies as Saturn Minerals, Wescan Goldfields Inc., North American Gem, and Westcore Drillinghttp://www.yourminingnews.com/news_item.php?newsID=29466  Tourism  An increasingly important industry is large game hunting in the area. Hudson Bay has become a much sought after location for recreational snowmobiling. Tourists from across Canada and the United States visit Hudson Bay to experience its diverse, natural surroundings. Hudson Bay is accessible by road and air. The town is located at the junction of Highways #3 (east and west) and #9 (north and south). The Canadian National Railway has three lines including the Bay Route to the Port of Churchill. Hudson Bay Transport provides truck service and the Saskatchewan Transportation Company provides daily bus service via Saskatoon, Regina and Prince Albert.

It runs from Hudson Bay, Saskatchewan south to Bismarck, North Dakota and beyond, passing through northern forest, prairie parkland, vast stretches of wheat- production, parks and coal mining country. Airport Hudson Bay Airport is unusual for a town of Hudson Bay's size and having it available makes industrial expansion locally all that much more attractive. The airport provides excellent service for charter and local aircraft and serves a water bomber base for forest protection. The airport, with a 5,000 foot runway and a 2,000 foot cross wind runway is able to accommodate almost any size of aircraft. A beacon and lights allow night landing.

History  In 1995, the people of Sierra Leone and the international community exalted pressure on the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC), the then military regime in Sierra Leone to lift the ban on politics and conduct democratic elections in the country. In June, 1995, a Sierra Leonean journalist and human rights activist, Mohamed Yahya Sillah, invited a group of Sierra Leoneans, namely, Sulaiman Sandy, Ousmann Hassann, Patrick Luseni Moriba, Wurie Kaisamba and Abdul Kamara to join him form a political party to contest the presidential and parliamentary elections in 1996. The group met in Brentwood, Maryland, USA on July 25, 1995 and formed the National Alliance Democratic Party (NADP).  Founding members  The founding members of the National Alliance Democratic Party elected Mohamed Yahya Sillah as Leader and National Chairman, Sulaiman Sandy, Vice Chairman, Ousmann Hassann, National Secretary General, Wurie Kaisamba, Vice National Secretary General, Patrick Luseni Moriba, Propaganda Secretary and Abdul Kamara, National Treasurer. The founders chose the name National Alliance Democratic Party to create an opportunity for newer and smaller political parties in Sierra Leone to merge into one political unit. The purpose was to put forth a formidable challenge against the two ‚Äúbigger political parties‚Äù, namely, the Sierra Leone Peoples Party (SLPP) and the All People‚Äôs Congress (APC). Both parties had ruled Sierra Leone respectively since independence in 1961 but failed to deliver quality leadership to Sierra Leone. NADP was determined to usher in a new breed of younger and more vibrant political leaders to help reshape the political destiny of Sierra Leone. NADP founders created the party with a vision to rebuilding Sierra Leone on the foundation of exemplary leadership. The party committed to helping build a strong economy, offer opportunities for quality education, create jobs for Sierra Leoneans, secure quality health care for all, help fight global terrorism, unite the nation and make tribalism a thing of the past. In 2006, the party chose a divine motto as the foundation upon which NADP would unshackle Sierra Leone from the grips of tribalism, corruption, human right abuses and inept leadership. The motto was: ‚ÄúWith God, All Things Are Possible‚Äù.  Political campaigns  Since 1996, NADP has not contested an election for public office. The Leader and Standard Bearer of the party, Mohamed Yahya Sillah, withdrew the party's participation in the 2002 elections and asked his supporters to back the SLPP candidate Ahmed Tejan Kabbah for president. In 2007, the party again withdrew its participation in the elections for reasons of lapses in the management machinery of the campaign, according to its leader. The party endorsed the candidacy of the Sierra Leone peoples party (SLPP), Solomon Berewa for president.

History The Christ Episcopal Church of Kent Island is recognized as the state's oldest Christian congregation. It was founded in 1632 by the Reverend Richard James,Historical marker near the entrance to Broad Creek Cemetery one year after Kent Island was founded by William Claiborne, and two years before settlers arrived at St. Clement's Island. The parish has used at least six buildings during its history. The church's original location was at Kent Fort. It moved to Broad Creek in 1652, and was rebuilt there in 1712 and again in 1826. The church moved again to Stevensville in 1880 as activity shifted there from Broad Creek, and to its current location in Matapeake in 1995 due to the need for a larger building. Of the six buildings, only the 1880 and 1995 buildings are standing today. The 1880 building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

The game was never released outside Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Falcom released a sequel, Vantage Master V2, a few months after the first game's release, featuring new maps and adjusted character balance but an unchanged overall game design. The English version of this game was made available as a free download as of 2002 under the title Vantage Master Online. Another sequel called VM Japan was released in 2002. Gameplay The player takes on the role of a summoner (known as Natial master or just master). A master can summon spirits known as Natials. All masters and Natials have maximum HP of 10. The object of the game is to reduce the opposing master's HP to 0. The game is played on a hex grid map with different types of terrains which affect the gameplay. In scenario mode, the player must play through 30 stages, divided into 6 phases each containing 4 to 7 stages, against opposing masters. In expert mode, both the player and the enemy are equipped with all Natials and magics available in the game, but the map design is generally disadvantageous for the player. Expert Mode consists of 8 stages.cFree Battle allows the player to configure all settings including masters, stats, Natials, magics and the map. Human vs Human, Human vs CPU and CPU vs CPU are also available. Secret characters are available in this mode. There are a total of 27 masters in Vantage Master, of which 18 can be accessed normally. There are 24 Natials that can be summoned, each of which belongs to one of four attributes: Earth, Water, Fire and Heavens. Each attribute has dominance and a weakness over one another in the following way: Earth beats Water, Water beats Fire, Fire beats Heavens, Heavens beats Earth. A Natial can also be day type or night type, becoming stronger in bright or dark places, respectively. Summoning and maintaining a Natial requires usage of MP. Each attribute has its own \\"style\\". For example, Earth units tend to have poor magic resistance with decent attack. They can move very well on land, while some are able to enter a watery terrain, albeit with penalized movement distance. Development Falcom announced the development of Vantage Master Portable for the PSP on December 20, 2007, which was released on April 24, 2008. It features new characters from the Sora no Kiseki series of games and a multiplayer mode using the PSP's wireless capabilities. The interface is changed slightly for the PSP, and there is no mouse functionality in the PC port. Otherwise, the game is essentially a complete 3D clone of the original Vantage Master with remastered orchestral music and corresponding gameplay mechanics.

A caretaker government is expected to conduct itself in accordance with a series of well-defined conventions administered by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, but there is no law compelling the caretaker government to do so. Under normal circumstances, there is no separate appointment of a caretaker government. The incumbent Prime Minister simply puts the government into \\"caretaker mode\\". During the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, appointed a new government headed by Malcolm Fraser, subject to Fraser's agreement that he would immediately advise a general election, and his government would operate on a caretaker basis in the meantime. It was a unique set of circumstances, leading to a unique solution. Caretaker conventions Australian constitutional practice calls for a government to continue in office even after parliament has been dissolved, during the election period and then into the next parliament only until the next government can be formed. The Prime Minister can however resign office and advise the Governor-General or Governor at any time to appoint a new government. The operation of the Australian political system ensures that a Cabinet is always maintained and that caretaker governments abide by the conventions. A document entitled \\"Guidance on Caretaker Conventions\\" is administered by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Section 1.2 of the Caretaker Conventions states that a caretaker government operates until the election result clearly indicates that either the incumbent party has retained power, or in the case where there is to be a change of government, until the new government is appointed by the Governor-General. Section 1.6 indicates that these conventions are not legally binding, and do not constitute \\"hard and fast rules\\". In practice, any flouting of the conventions by a caretaker government would immediately come to light, and could go against them in the election campaign. There are occasions when major appointments or decisions cannot wait until after the election, and the opposition would normally be consulted about them, ensuring a bipartisan approach. Caretaker government conduct Caretaker provisions explicitly recognise that after the dissolution of parliament, the business of government must continue and that \\"ordinary matters of administration\\" must be addressed. Provisions allow for the normal operations of all government departments. However, the caretaker conventions impose some restrictions on the conduct of the caretaker government. The conventions broadly include the following: * The Government will cease taking major policy decisions except on urgent matters and then only after formal consultation with the Opposition. The conventions apply to the making of decisions, not to their announcement. Accordingly, the conventions are not infringed if decisions made before dissolution are announced during the caretaker period. However, when possible, decisions would normally be announced ahead of dissolution. * The Government will cease making major appointments of public officials but may make acting or short-term appointments. * The Government will avoid entering major contracts or undertakings during the caretaker period. If it is not possible to defer the commitment until after the caretaker period for legal, commercial or other reasons, a minister could consult the Opposition, or agencies could deal with the contractor and ensure that contracts include clauses providing for termination in the event of an incoming government not wishing to proceed. Similar provisions cover tendering. * The Government ordinarily seeks to defer such major international negotiations, or adopts observer status until the end of the caretaker period. * The Australian Public Service adopts a neutral stance while continuing to advise the Government. There are several cases, notably the pricing of Opposition election promises, in which the APS conducts an investigation and report for the benefit of the electorate at large. Post-election If the incumbent prime minister will after an election continue to command a majority of seats in the House of Representatives, the incumbent government ceases to operate in a caretaker mode. When an opposition party or coalition wins enough seats at a general election to be able to command a majority in the House of Representatives, the convention is for the incumbent Prime Minister to publicly concede defeat and, still in caretaker mode, give formal advice to the Governor-General of no longer being able to govern and advising who should be invited to form government, which is usually the leader of the party or coalition of parties who now commands a majority of votes in the House of Representatives. The Governor-General requests the incumbent Prime Minister and his or her Ministers to remain in office on a caretaker basis until a new government is sworn in, and contacts the nominated successor and invites him or her to form a government. The nominated successor accepts the invitation and undertakes to inform the Governor-General when the new Ministry is in a position to be sworn in. That can be delayed by the counting of votes in closely contested seats or by the processes by which ministers are chosen under the relevant party's rules. In the meantime, the caretaker government continues in office until the government is sworn in. If it is unclear to the incumbent prime minister who will be able to command a majority in the House of Representatives, he or she may delay advising the Governor-General as to a potential change of government, and may negotiate an agreement with cross-bench members as to whether they will vote with a future government on questions of confidence and supply, and may even delay a final decision until the next House of Representatives sits, to let the House \\"test the numbers\\" by a formal vote in the House, or may advise the Governor-General to hold fresh elections. In most cases, several weeks can elapse between an election and the swearing-in of a new government. An exception came in 1972, when Gough Whitlam had himself and his deputy, Lance Barnard, sworn in as a two-man government on 5 December, only three days after the election, as soon as Labor's victory over the Coalition was beyond doubt. That lasted until Whitlam's full ministry was sworn in on 19 December. Exceptional situations The 1901 caretaker government The first Australian federal government, headed by Prime Minister Edmund Barton, was sworn in on 1 January 1901, the day on which the Federation of Australia took effect, whereby the six colonies of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania became states of the Commonwealth of Australia. The first election for the new Parliament of Australia was not held until 29 and 30 March 1901. In the meantime, Barton's government operated in a caretaker capacity but, due to the need to quickly establish administrative processes and make important appointments, they were not as inhibited by the caretaker conventions as later governments were. Outbreak of WWI, 1914 In June 1914, a double dissolution election was called for 5 September, with the incumbent government duly going into caretaker mode. However, Britain declared war against Germany in August, and Australia went onto a war footing. The caretaker conventions had to be relaxed because of the state of war, with the support of all major parties.

The surveys and plans for the project were performed by civil engineer James Fowle Baldwin (1782‚Äì1862), the son of Loammi Baldwin who designed the Middlesex Canal, and younger brother of Loammi Baldwin, Jr. (1780‚Äì1838) who authored the earlier studies for a Boston water supply.

Accessed February 3, 2011. Hildene was named Kentucky Broodmare of the Year in 1950, the same year her son Hill Prince was named Horse of the Year. Cicada was trained by Casey Hayes, who also trained Hill Prince, First Landing, and Sir Gaylord. Racing career Hayes believed in starting his horses young, so Cicada first raced in February 1961 at Hialeah Park Race Track and won easily by 4¬Ω lengths. She won one allowance race and lost one before being entered in her first stakes race. She lost the Fashion Stakes, but then won her third allowance easily. She won the Blue Hen Stakes wire-to-wire, winning by 5¬Ω lengths. Cicada was never out of the money in her sixteen starts as a two-year-old. She won eleven of those races (including the final six in a row) and set a new record for earnings by a filly. Her stakes victories included the Schuylerville, Frizette, Matron, and Spinaway. She was named the Champion two-year-old filly of 1961. In her first race in 1962 as a three-year-old, she won an allowance race against older males. She then ran one of her most courageous efforts in the Florida Derby, a major prep for the Kentucky Derby against some of the best colts in the country. It turned into a two horse battle between Cicada and Ridan, with Cicada losing by a nose. After she easily won the Oaks Prep (now called the Eight Belles Stakes) she was considered for the Kentucky Derby but her stablemate Sir Gaylord was entered instead, then went lame and was unable to race. Cicada entered the Kentucky Oaks and won by three lengths. The purse made her the world's leading money- winning filly or mare of all time, replacing Bewitch. She finished the year with 8 wins from 17 starts. Her other wins included the Acorn, Mother Goose and Beldame Stakes, in which she broke Kelso's track record for nine furlongs at Aqueduct. She also finished second in the Coaching Club American Oaks and third in the Alabama Stakes. She received the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Three-Year-Old Filly of 1962. At age four, Cicada raced eight times and won four: the Columbiana, Sheepshead Bay, Vagrancy and Distaff handicaps. She was awarded the title of Champion older female horse of 1963. She suffered an injury and was temporarily retired, then returned at age five for one last race in which she finished fourth. In 1967, Cicada was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. In 1993, the Cicada Stakes at Aqueduct was created in her honor. In the Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century, she was ranked #62. Breeding record As a broodmare, Cicada was not a great success. In her first season, she proved barren and was returned to the races. Retired a second time, she foaled Cicada's Pride in 1966 (by Sir Gaylord) who won the 1968 Juvenile Stakes at Belmont Park.

It was founded by Fred and Pat Cody. It moved to a larger location on Telegraph Avenue in 1960 and moved to another Telegraph Avenue location in 1965. In 1968, \\"Cody's served as a first-aid station [‚Ä¶] when anti-war protesters were tear gassed and clubbed just outside its Telegraph Avenue doors [‚Ä¶] the store's employees were tending the woundedanti-war protesters teargassed and clubbed by the police and the National Guard as protests broke out on Telegraph Avenue.\\" In the early 1970s, Mario Savio worked as a clerk at the Telegraph Avenue store. In 1977, the Codys sold the store to Andy Ross, who owned it until 2006. Cody's was best known for its extensive selection of literary, political, and scholarly titles. On February 28, 1989, unknown persons threw a firebomb through the window of the store. It was thought that this was in response to the prominent display of Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, which had been banned by a fatwa by Iranian clerics one month prior. An undetonated pipe bomb was subsequently discovered in the store. In response the staff unanimously voted to keep the book on display despite the attack and the increasing willingness of chain bookstores to bow to pressure to withdraw it. Cody's pioneered a well-regarded author-reading series. Some prominent authors and notables who appeared at Cody's were: Tom Robbins, Norman Mailer, Ken Kesey, Alice Walker, Allen Ginsberg, Maurice Sendak, Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, Muhammad Ali, and Salman Rushdie. In the 1980s, Cody's was a plaintiff in several anti-trust lawsuits charging that independent book sellers were discriminated against in favor of chain stores. Cody's owner, Andy Ross, was a prominent spokesperson supporting independent businesses against chain stores and Internet retailers.  Neighborhood booksellers  Cody's was a core bookseller among a coterie of independent booksellers, which included Moe's Books, located nearly next door to Cody's, , Shakespeare & Co., Black Oak Books, Diesel, and others, all located in the region from north Berkeley to north Oakland. This region includes the University of California, Berkeley. Together they were members of a significant regional supporter of independent bookselling, The Northern California Independent Bookseller's Association, or NCIBA.  Moves and closure  The Telegraph store was the flagship store until it closed in 2006, sparking a controversy in the local press over the cause. One explanation given for the closure was that it was caused by pressure from corporate chains like Borders. the location was still vacant. The Cody's San Francisco location closed in 2007 for a similar reason. Cody's was sold to Japanese book distributor Yohan, Inc. in September 2006. In March 2008, the last remaining store moved from 4th Street to its final location on Shattuck Avenue due to a rent increase. Financial pressures forced the closure of the store for good on June 20, 2008.

After two back-to-back losing seasons with the Packers, Symank's career fortunes turned when new coach Vince Lombardi took total control of the Green Bay Packers organization‚Äîon and off the field. Lombardi, who had worked the previous five seasons as an assistant coach for the New York Giants, was an enthusiastic leader eager to prove himself as a head coach. The Packers narrowly missed a shot at the NFL championship and Lombardi was recognized as the NFL coach of the year in . In , the Packers returned with renewed confidence in themselves and Lombardi's system and philosophy. Symank led the Packers in both interception-return and kickoff-return yardage, helping his team get to the 1960 NFL Championship Game. During the game, the Philadelphia Eagles' quarterback Norm Van Brocklin, on second down, threw a pass from the Packers' five-yard-line that Symank intercepted in the end zone for a touchback. This set up three downs and out as Packers quarterback Bart Starr threw three straight incomplete passes. On a fake punt play that was not ordered by Lombardi, Packers punter Max McGee ran thirty-five yards up the middle of the field for the first down; the Packers then drove the length of the field for a touchdown, putting the Packers back in the game. Despite the Packers furious fourth-quarter efforts, they fell eight yards short of winning the 1960 NFL championship as time expired; the final score was Philadelphia over Green Bay 17‚Äì13. During the season, Lombardi led the Packers to an improved record of 11‚Äì3, a Western Conference title, and a short trip to the 1961 NFL Championship Game. The New Year's Eve game, held in Green Bay, was the first NFL game ever to gross over one million dollars, and was attended by 39,029 people. Symank started and played in almost every defensive play of the game, as the Packers defense held the Giants scoreless in a 37‚Äì0 blow-out. The following season, Lombardi led Symank and the Packers to another victory in the 1962 NFL Championship Game. In , Symank was traded along with Bill Quinlan to the New York Giants. Before Symank ever wore a Giants uniform, he was traded again to the St. Louis Cardinals, where he played his final 9‚Äì5 season under coach Wally Lemm. During Symank's seven-year NFL career, he played in eighty-nine regular season games, recovered twelve fumbles, intercepted nineteen passes and returning them for 387 yards and a touchdown. Coaching career Early assistantships Symank's college and professional coaching career spanned two and a half decades. Symank's first assistant coaching job was at Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1964, when he met fellow assistant coach Bill Arnsparger, a relationship that spanned Symank's entire coaching career. In 1965, he went to the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia and worked under head coach George Blackburn. Norb Hecker, one of Lombardi's assistants who coached Symank at Green Bay, became the head coach of the Atlanta Falcons, the NFL's new expansions team, in . Hecker recruited Symank to join the Falcons' first coaching staff. In , Symank and Hecker were joined in Atlanta by former Packer Lew Carpenter. The Falcons' owner was frustrated with his team's 4‚Äì26‚Äì1 record, and Hecker was fired after the third game of his third season. Former Eagles quarterback Norm Van Brocklin took over as the Falcons head coach for the balance of the season, and the Falcons assistant coaches including Symank were fired at season's end. College head coach Symank was the head football coach for Northern Arizona University (NAU) in Flagstaff, Arizona in 1969 and 1970,College Football Data Warehouse, All-Time Coaching Records, John Symank Records by Year. Retrieved July 9, 2010. He picked his former Packers teammate and quarterback Lamar McHan as his offensive coordinator and C. O. Brocato, a very successful coach at Jesuit High School in Shreveport, Louisiana, as his defensive coordinator. The trio coached the NAU Lumberjacks together for two years and moved again when his alma mater, the University of Texas at Arlington (formerly Arlington State Junior College), asked him to be the head coach of the UT Arlington Mavericks. Symank was the eleventh head college football coach for the Arlington Mavericks, and he held that position for three seasons, from 1971 until 1973. He and his assistants assumed command over a completely demoralized team and set out to rebuild the program using the same techniques he had learned from Lombardi. Symank's three-year win-loss record at UT Arlington was 11‚Äì21. Return to the NFL Bill Arnsparger became the head coach of the New York Giants in , and called Symank to join his new staff. After winning just seven games in three seasons, Arnsparger was fired in . Symank was hired by Ted Marchibroda as an assistant coach for the Baltimore Colts, and also coached under Marchibroda's successor, Mike McCormack, from to . After years of frustration, the Colts management was ready to make major changes, so Symank, along with the rest of the Colts coaches, were fired. At home in Louisiana In 1984 a new opportunity presented itself when Bill Arnsparger accepted the head coaching position at Louisiana State University (LSU) in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Hired to be the LSU defensive coordinator, Symank was the first assistant hired by Arnsparger. The LSU Tigers posted an 8‚Äì3‚Äì2 record, including the loss to Nebraska in the Sugar Bowl. Arnsparger earned the SEC's Coach of the Year award for turning around an LSU program that had a losing 4‚Äì7 record the year before. In 1985 the Tigers came back even stronger, and Symank moved from defensive coordinator to coach the Tigers linebackers and coordinate Arnsparger's recruiting program. He had an affinity for recruiting small town high school players, and felt it was his duty to give promising young players the same chance he had been given. A college education, four years playing college football, and maybe a shot at an NFL roster, but most importantly, Symank would always say: \\"get that diploma because no matter how good you are, you can't play forever.\\" Symank died at his beach house on Dauphin Island, Alabama in 2002; he was 66 years old. He was survived by his wife Sarah and their children.

Latone (April 18, 1897 ‚Äì November 24, 1975) was an American football player of Lithuanian descent who played six seasons in the National Football League (NFL). Although he never attended college, he is unofficially considered the leading rusher of 1920s. During the six seasons he played in the NFL, Latone out-rushed (2,648‚Äì2,616 in yards) and outscored (26‚Äì21 in touchdowns) the Pro Football Hall of Fame's Red Grange, despite playing 30 fewer games. He was also one of the very few known persons to knock Grange out of a game. Grange later said that, \\"even though (Chicago Bears owner) George Halas was paying me, 500 bucks to barn storm the nation, it wasn't enough to be hit by the likes of Latone.\\"http://bleacherreport.com/articles/111914-cursed-cardinals-pottsville- maroons-mojo-will-curse-the-arizona-cardinals/show_full Playing career At age 11, after his father's death, he worked in his place in the Pennsylvania coal mines to support his mother and 5 other siblings. By working as a slaypicker in the mines, Tony developed his legs by pushing mining carts up a slope. Latone played for the Pottsville Maroons historic 1925 team. Latone and the Maroons won the 1925 NFL Championship, before the title was stripped from the team due to a still-disputed rules violation. That season, Tony contributed eight touchdowns in which Pottsville attack led the league with 270 points. He also followed the Maroons to Boston in 1929, where they became the Boston Bulldogs in 1929. According to his 1930 contract with the Providence Steam Roller, which is now in the Pro Football Hall of Fame archives, Latone was paid $125 for all NFL daylight games and 60 percent of that sum for NFL \\"floodlight\\" games. One of the original team's founders Pearce Johnson explained that the pay reduction for night games was arranged to help pay the installation costs of the floodlights at the Cyclodome.http://www.profootballhof.com/history/decades/1920s/providence.aspx Following his playing career, Latone moved to Michigan and went into business with former Maroon teammate Frank Bucher. For many years, he'd sit in the stands at Detroit's Briggs Stadium, watching the Detroit Lions play. Money Due to having support his family at an early age, Tony only had a fifth-grade education. According to one story, Tony was always paid in cash, a common occurrence for other players of the day. One day, several Maroons players found some money on the bench that belonged to Tony. They asked him, \\"What are you doing, Tony? Why don't you get yourself a checking account?\\" Tony didn't understand how a checking account worked and didn't want to get one. But because the other players kept bugging him about it, he eventually gave in and got one. However a week later, the same players found his checkbook lying on the bench, with every check in the book was signed. He'd typically walk into a business and ask the clerk, \\"What do I owe you?\\" He would then proceed to fill in the amount on the check because his name was already on it.

Background The origins of the fan club were rooted in the mid-1970s, when the band first broke through with their album Toys in the Attic. The band became a popular act with a loyal following of fans, often referred to as the \\"Blue Army\\". Former Aerosmith guitarist and band friend Ray Tabano got the idea of printing simple T-shirts with the classic Aerosmith \\"wings\\" logo. 100 of these T-shirts were printed and sold out within a matter of minutes at an Aerosmith concert. As a result, the band decided to form an official fan club with member dues. Its main source of revenue was T-shirt sales, and Ray Tabano would also write up newsletters and send them to members. The fan club was run by Tabano out of the band's headquarters, the Wherehouse, in Waltham, Massachusetts. As the band's popularity grew and things within the band began to change, Tabano was fired by band managers Steve Leber and David Krebs with little severance. When the band resurrected in the mid-late 1980s and band management changed, the fan club adopted a more professional look and its headquarters was moved out to San Francisco. Sometime in the late 1990s, the fan club moved back to Boston and has since been operated by a variety of outside agencies. The fan club is currently operated by BubbleUp in The Woodlands, Texas. Functions Aero Force One is a significant part of Aerosmith. Being over 25 years old, some fan club members have seniority of 10 years or more. The associated website, AeroForceOne.com, is the primary source of news, information, and media relating to the band, and is the most frequently updated of the band's three official websites. The fan club is also the point-of-purchase for official Aerosmith merchandise. The band's merchandise collection, which offers new items all the time, includes everything from T-shirts and sweatshirts, to coffee mugs and hats, to doormats and blankets, as well as jewelry designed by a fan and worn by Steven Tyler. The fan club offers premium concert ticket seating and a variety of special packages to members, based on seniority and the price levels members are willing to pay. The club's Premium tickets are the same price as public onsale tickets and include a collectible tour pin.

The community was named after Maidstone, Kent, England. It is mentioned in Joni Mitchell's \\"Song For Sharon\\" from her Hejira album and is one of the places in western Canada in which she lived as a young child. The song's seventh verse begins: \\"When we were kids in Maidstone, Sharon/I went to every wedding in that little town/To see the tears and the kisses/And the pretty lady in the white lace wedding gown...\\" Demographics  History  In the spring of 1903, settlers began arriving in the Maidstone area, many of whom were Barr Colonists. These settlers would be followed by African American settlers from the U.S. and a significant number of Mennonites after the construction of the Canadian Northern Railway through the region in 1905. John Henry ‚ÄúJack‚Äù Wesson settled in the area in 1907. He became one of Saskatchewan's foremost farm leaders and became the first president of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture in 1936 and the president of the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool in 1937. In 1955 Maidstone officially became a town. Oil and gas development in the 1970s created conditions for grow in the community. The booming economy resulted in the town's population growing from less than 700 at the beginning of the decade to over 1,000 by 1981. Shiloh People African Americans from Oklahoma settled in the Eldon district near Maidstone in 1909 creating the first and only African-American farming community in the province. In 1907 Oklahoma and the Indian Territory merged to become a State. The new government enacted segregation and laws disenfranchising African Americans. As a result, many decided to emigrate to Western Canada to take advantage of offers of free homesteads. About 10 or 12 families, led by Julius Caesar Lane and Joseph Mayes founded the Shiloh colony in the RM of Eldon. At its height in the late 1920s, the colony boasted between 50 and 75 African American families. Today, all that remains of the Shiloh community is a log building called Shiloh Baptist Church, built in 1911 and abandoned in 1940, as well as a graveyard known as the Shiloh Baptist Cemetery located about 29 km northeast of Maidstone. In 1991 the church and cemetery were designated a heritage property.

In 1881, he was appointed professor of surgery at the University of Zurich. After his death, he was succeeded by Ferdinand Sauerbruch (1875‚Äì1951) as chair of surgery at Zurich. In 1886, Kr√∂nlein published an account of an 1884 appendectomy that he performed on a 17-year- old boy. Although the patient died two days after the surgery, it was the first documented case of an appendectomy. He was also a pioneer involving lung resections, and his name is associated with \\"Kr√∂nlein's operation\\", which is a lateral orbitotomy of the eye. This surgery involves removal of an orbital tumor without excision of the eye. In 1899, he described evisceration of brain in a high velocity gunshot wound to the head.

Woggon was born the fourth of six children in Toledo, Ohio, and he grew up there. Fascinated by an art correspondence course that his older brother Elmer Woggon was taking, he became interested in drawing. At 16, he took a job in a department store as a commercial artist, and then did the same kind of work at the Toledo Blade, where Elmer worked. Comic strips By 1938, he was assisting Elmer in lettering and then drawing the latter's newspaper comic strip Big Chief Wahoo, which later metamorphosed into Steve Roper and Mike Nomad. According to the strip's writer, Allen Saunders, they were unable to keep him as a full-time Big Chief Wahoo staffer. Comic books Bill Woggon kept working on his own ideas for a comic book. Inspired by wartime pinup girls,Foley, Maureen. \\"Humble Man vs. the Diva: The Story of Cartoonist Bill Woggon,\\" Cherry Meltdown.Foley, Maureen. \\"Katy Keene and Bill Woggon, Straight Up,\\" Cherry Meltdown. in 1945, he created Katy Keene, beginning in Wilbur Comics and taking advantage of its teen market. It became a success during the next ten years, spawning fan clubs and pen pals. Katy Keene featured fashionable young beauty Katy (a model with \\"traditional values\\"), who had a pestering little sister, a stream of suitors and dreams of becoming an actress. The stories were not overly inspired and mainly served to put Katy through as many successive wardrobe changes as possible in order to show off reader-submitted fashions that Woggon drew and credited to them (a feature adopted by Dixie Dugan as well). Paper dolls with other outfits for Katy also increased the comic's appeal. It continued through the 1950s in various outlets (Katy Keene Pinup Parade, Laugh Comics, and Pep Comics, and Archie Comics). When it ended in 1961, Woggon turned to other work, such as the Dell comic Millie the Lovable Monster, ghosting the newspaper strip Priscilla's Pop and creating the Archie feature The Twiddles. With the success of Katy Keene, Woggon and his wife Jane moved their family in 1948 to California, where they bought a spread near Santa Barbara. At the same time, Katy also moved from New York City to California. Woggon was visited by his admirers, including Floyd Norman, Trina Robbins and John S. Lucas. With Woggon's blessing, Lucas was asked by Michael Silberkleit and Richard Goldwater to do the art on the Archie Comics revival of Katy Keene. Katy Keene inspired a generation of serious fashion designers, including Betsey Johnson.Spurgeon, Tom. \\"Obituary: Bill Woggon 1911-2003,\\" The Comics Journal #252 (May 2003). In his later years, Woggon illustrated Christian literature for children (e.g., coloring books such as Let's Read and Color, 1988). Awards In 1981, his work was recognized with an Inkpot Award.

Polar amplification is the phenomenon that any change in the net radiation balance (for example greenhouse intensification) tends to produce a larger change in temperature near the poles than the planetary average. On a planet with an atmosphere that can restrict emission of longwave radiation to space (a greenhouse effect), surface temperatures will be warmer than a simple planetary equilibrium temperature calculation would predict. Where the atmosphere or an extensive ocean is able to transport heat polewards, the poles will be warmer and equatorial regions cooler than their local net radiation balances would predict. In the extreme, the planet Venus is thought to have experienced a very large increase in greenhouse effect over its lifetime, so much so that its poles have warmed sufficiently to render its surface temperature effectively isothermal (no difference between poles and equator). On Earth, water vapor and trace gasses provide a lesser greenhouse effect, and the atmosphere and extensive oceans provide efficient poleward heat transport. Both palaeoclimate changes and recent global warming changes have exhibited strong polar amplification, as described below. Arctic amplification is polar amplification of the Earth's North Pole only; Antarctic amplification is that of the South Pole. History An observation based study related to Arctic amplification was published in 1969 by Mikhail Budyko, the study conclusion has been summarized as, \\"Sea ice loss affects Arctic temperatures through the surface albedo feedback.\\" The same year a similar model was published by William D. Sellers. Both studies attracted significant attention since they hinted at the possibility for a runaway positive feedback within the global climate system. In 1975 Manabe and Wetherald published the first somewhat plausible general circulation model that looked at the effects of an increase of greenhouse gas. Although confined to less than one-third of the globe, with a \\"swamp\\" ocean and only land surface at high latitudes, it showed an Arctic warming faster than the tropics (as have all subsequent models). Amplification Amplifying mechanisms Feedbacks associated with sea ice and snow cover are widely cited as the main cause of recent terrestrial polar amplification. However, amplification is also observed in model worlds with no ice or snow. It appears to arise both from a (possibly transient) intensification of poleward heat transport and more directly from changes in the local net radiation balance (an overall decrease in outward radiation will produce a larger relative increase in net radiation near the poles than near the equator). Some examples of climate system feedbacks thought to contribute to recent polar amplification include the reduction of snow cover and sea ice, changes in atmospheric and ocean circulation, the presence of anthropogenic soot in the Arctic environment, and increases in cloud cover and water vapor. Most studies connect sea ice changes to polar amplification. Some models of modern climate exhibit Arctic amplification without changes in snow and ice cover. The individual processes contributing to polar warming are critical to understanding climate sensitivity. Ocean circulation It has been estimated that 70% of global wind energy is transferred to the ocean and takes place within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). Eventually, upwelling due to wind-stress transports cold Antarctic waters through the Atlantic surface current, while warming them over the equator, and into the Arctic environment. Thus, warming in the Arctic depends on the efficiency of the global ocean transport and plays a role in the polar see-saw effect. Decreased oxygen and low-pH during La Ni√±a are processes that correlate with decreased primary production and a more pronounced poleward flow of ocean currents. It has been proposed that the mechanism of increased Arctic surface air temperature anomalies during La Ni√±a periods of ENSO may be attributed to the Tropically Excited Arctic Warming Mechanism (TEAM), when Rossby waves propagate more poleward, leading to wave dynamics and an increase in downward infrared radiation. Amplification factor Polar amplification is quantified in terms of a polar amplification factor, generally defined as the ratio of some change in a polar temperature to a corresponding change in a broader average temperature: ::::{ PAF }={\\\\Delta{T}_{p}\\\\over\\\\Delta\\\\overline{T}}, where \\\\Delta{T}_{p} is a change in polar temperature and \\\\Delta\\\\overline{T} is, for example, a corresponding change in a global mean temperature. Common implementations define the temperature changes directly as the anomalies in surface air temperature relative to a recent reference interval (typically 30 years). Others have used the ratio of the variances of surface air temperature over an extended interval. Amplification phase Temperature trends in West Antarctica (left) have greatly exceeded the global average; East Antarctica less so It is observed that Arctic and Antarctic warming commonly proceed out of phase because of orbital forcing, resulting in the so-called polar see-saw effect. Paleoclimate polar amplification The glacial / interglacial cycles of the Pleistocene provide extensive palaeoclimate evidence of polar amplification, both from the Arctic and the Antarctic. In particular, the temperature rise since the last glacial maximum years ago provides a clear picture. Proxy temperature records from the Arctic (Greenland) and from the Antarctic indicate polar amplification factors on the order of 2.0. Recent Arctic amplification The dark ocean surface reflects only 6 percent of incoming solar radiation, instead sea ice reflects 50 to 70 percent. Suggested mechanisms leading to the observed Arctic amplification include Arctic sea ice decline (open water reflects less sunlight than sea ice), and atmospheric heat transport from the equator to the Arctic. Jennifer Francis told Scientific American in 2017, \\"A lot more water vapor is being transported northward by big swings in the jet stream. That‚Äôs important because water vapor is a greenhouse gas just like carbon dioxide and methane. It traps heat in the atmosphere. That vapor also condenses as droplets we know as clouds, which themselves trap more heat. The vapor is a big part of the amplification story‚Äîa big reason the Arctic is warming faster than anywhere else.\\" Studies have linked rapidly warming Arctic temperatures, and thus a vanishing cryosphere, to extreme weather in mid-latitudes. In particular, one hypothesis links polar amplification to extreme weather by changing the polar jet stream. However, a 2013 study noted that extreme events in particular associated with sea ice and snow cover decline have not yet been observed for long enough to distinguish natural climate variability from impacts related to recent climate change. Studies published in 2017 and 2018 identified stalling patterns of rossby waves, in the northern hemisphere jet stream, to have caused almost stationary extreme weather events, such as the 2018 European heatwave, the 2003 European heat wave, 2010 Russian heat wave, 2010 Pakistan floods - these events have been linked to global warming, the rapid heating of the Arctic. According to a 2009 study the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) is highly correlated with changes in Arctic temperature, suggesting that the Atlantic Ocean thermohaline circulation is linked to temperature variability in the Arctic on a multi-decadal time scale. A study in 2014 concluded that Arctic amplification significantly decreased cold-season temperature variability over the Northern Hemisphere in recent decades. Cold Arctic air intrudes into the warmer lower latitudes more rapidly today during autumn and winter, a trend projected to continue in the future except during summer, thus calling into question whether winters will bring more cold extremes. According to a 2015 study, based on computer modelling of aerosols in the atmosphere, up to 0.5 degrees Celsius of the warming observed in the Arctic between 1980 and 2005 is due to aerosol reductions in Europe.

The post office was first located in Henry's Men's Clothing Store, and moved into its own building just north of the Times Office the next year. *1907: The town was named Junction City, with the hopes that it would become the largest city in western Canada *1907: The Canadian Bank of Commerce was constructed with K.W. Reikie as manager, and the Northern Crown Bank with R.S. Inkster as manager. Inkster's residence (Earl McDougall's house) was one of the first residences constructed. Others were homes of Norman Townsend and J.I. Jamieson. Ewart's hall opened above the Northern Crown Bank, and here the first schoolroom classes were held. Mabel Dobbyn, who later married K.W. Reikie of the Bank of Commerce, was the first teacher. *1908: Carloads of lumber, hardware and carpenters were arriving, and the Sash and Door Factory was kept busy. For a time the Franklin Realty Co. contemplated starting a brickyard, using the good clay of the district. Almost every train brought in new settlers, and many cars of settlers' effects. That month, the Nokomis Times building was put up on 2nd Avenue by W.C.R. Garrioch. *1908: The town was renamed Nokomis *1909: The post office was opened *1910: The Carter Land Company began purchasing land in the Nokomis district. *1912: The first coal seam was discovered south east of Nokomis in the Tate area (now known as the NSC1 Pit) (51.43935N,-104.819276W). *1914‚Äì1916: Two more mines were started, one (NCS2) and the other straight east(NCS3). *1918: Officials from Hunter Valley Coal Chain (HVCC) were sent to the Nokomis area to purchase the surface rights to as well as mineral rights *1946: After the Second World War many men returned to the area where they found work with a new oil company from the United States (ND Oil Seekers) *1947: The first well was drilled, which is known as NOW1 (Nokomis Oil Well 1). It was drilled in the formation known as the Hatfield Basin (Latitude: 51¬∞ 25' 26.117\\" N, Longitude: 105¬∞ 00' 47.486\\" W). The Hatfield Basin was mainly sweet crude oil and was extremely shallow. This made the area very popular to new oil companies. *1988: The first horizontal well was drilled in the area by the directional driller Ryan Oliver and MWD was done by Kent Ruether.

Powell plays a diplomat whose amnesia about his past comes back to trouble him.. The film was inspired by the 1938 French film Crossroads which had also had a British remake Dead Man's Shoes in 1940. Plot In 1935, French Diplomat David Talbot (William Powell) and his bride Lucienne (Hedy Lamarr) are enjoying their third month of marriage in Paris when Talbot is confronted by extortionist Carlos Le Duc (Vladimir Sokoloff) who demands money in exchange for not turning him in to the police. During a trial of the extortionist, whose defense is that he was seeking a repayment of debt by a former criminal comrade, Talbot is accused of being that notorious criminal. Henri Sarrou (Basil Rathbone) testifies that he is not. Talbot claims that amnesia prevents him from knowing the truth and his story is backed up by a psychologist, Dr. Tessier (Felix Bressart). Le Duc is convicted. Sarrou then visits Talbot at his home where we learn that Sarrou deliberately testified falsely to set up his blackmail scheme. He demands a million francs, half the loot from an alleged scheme he and Talbot (in his forgotten criminal phase) carried out. Talbot subsequently struggles to discover the truth about his past, while keeping Sarrou at bay and his wife in the dark.

The novel story line, which would do credit to an Alfred Hitchcock thriller, has the added potency of Hedy Lamarr and William Powell ... It‚Äôs good, escapist drama, without a hint of the war despite its Parisian locale, circa 1935, and evidences excellent casting and good direction. The script likewise well turned out, though better pace would have put the film in the smash class. Its only fault is a perceptible slowness at times, although the running time is a reasonable 82 minutes, caused by a plenitude of talk.\\"Variety. Staff film review, 1942. Accessed: July 25, 2013.

He played seven senior games for the Collingwood Football Club from 2009‚Äì2010, before being delisted at the end of the 2010 season.  Background  Drafted under the Australian Football League's father-son rule (son of Ricky Barham) with the 61st selection in the 2007 National Draft, Barham is a medium midfielder. He grew up in Barwon Heads and at 6 years of age moved to the suburb of Kew in Melbourne, Victoria. Barham attended Ivanhoe Grammar School, representing the school in football on more than one occasion before moving back to Barwon Heads to complete his Year 11 and 12 VCE studies at Geelong College. He played for Lorne Football Club, where he really started to turn heads for his playing style, which was considered as talented as his father, former Collingwood player, Ricky Barham. After just a few games for Lorne Football Club he was invited to join the Geelong Falcons a team competing in the TAC Cup, and a stepping stone for up and coming AFL players. Jaxson was one of the two over 18 year old players allowed to play for the Geelong Falcons in the TAC Cup under 18 division. Career Barham had an unfortunate start to his AFL career, cracking a shoulder socket in a practice match in the 2008 pre-season, as well as having his tonsils removed. He made his AFL debut on 17 April 2009 against the Brisbane Lions at the Gabba. Barham had 28 disposals and a game- high nine tackles, playing on Lions midfield star Luke Power.

W. Alexander Stanley Walter \\"S. W.\\" Alexander (16 November 1895 ‚Äì 23 March 1980) was a British journalist and political activist. Early life During the First World War, Alexander served as a Sergeant Major in the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, as he was unable to join the British forces as his height was only 5'1\\". He was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1918 (investiture 15 November 1919), and in 1919 married Doris Emily Kibble, whom he had met in the offices of Lord Beaverbrook. They had two sons, Andrew and Colin. Journalism and politics He was a journalist for the Beaverbrook press, being City Editor of the Sunday Express, Daily Express and Evening Standard. From 1948 he was editor of the City Press newspaper. He was instrumental in founding the Society for Individual Freedom and Oliver Smedley described himself and Alexander as \\"the only active free- traders left in England in the 1950s\\". He debated at the Cambridge Union with Lord Longford over the Beveridge Report in January 1943. He stood in the 1945 general election as an Independent Free Trade candidate (coming fourth) for City of London. He stood in the 1950 general election for the Liberal Party (coming third) for Ilford North. He was also chairman of the London Liberal Party.Richard Cockett, Thinking the Unthinkable. Think-Tanks and the Economic Counter-Revolution, 1931‚Äì1983 (Fontana, 1995), pp. 125‚Äì127. He was also against British membership of the Common Market. Political views Alexander was a believer in free trade, writing letters to The Times on this and other economic subjects. He believed that the abandonment of free trade in 1917 began \\"the lowering of the standard of life by stopping goods reaching people\\" and that it was responsible for \\"the closed market behind which monopolies and price rings of labour and capital have grown up\\".Letter: 'Free trade in practice', The Times (8 October 1947), p. 5. He argued for the restoration of free trade \\"regardless of what other nations may do\\" and asked: \\"...does the housewife improve her position by buying the poorest quality goods at the highest price or not? The future of the pound is inextricably bound up with this question of restoring to the people the right to buy in the cheapest market\\".Letter: 'Economics of imports', The Times (14 May 1953), p. 9. Alexander opposed collectivism and socialism and argued for more units of industry to combat them: \\"Over a period of 40 years the policy of \\"protection\\" has concentrated industry in fewer hands and helped to create monopolies which in turn has encouraged the Socialists to believe that the way to deal with monopolies is for the State to take them over...a policy of free trade...will provide the conditions under which more units will grow up...With more units we shall also get a larger number of responsible individuals with political independence\\".Letter: 'Widening share ownership', The Times (6 April 1959), p. 11. Alexander believed that protectionism, by fostering monopolies and nationalisation, would (if not reversed) lead to a totalitarian state: \\"Free Trade is a great safeguard for all the other liberties of the people and it can play a most valuable part in promoting good will among the peoples and world peace\\".Letter: 'Where Liberals differ', The Times (17 April 1959), p. 13. He contended that the best argument for foreign investment was \\"the natural right of Englishmen to do what they think is to the best advantage with their own money. Where responsibility for profit or loss resides with the individual there will the best results of investment be achieved\\".Letter: 'Foreign investment', The Times (9 September 1963), p. 11. \\"Protectionism\\", Alexander wrote, \\"is akin to socialism and no free enterprise political party in an island nation dependent for its life on international trading should ever have had anything to do with it...capital and labour need a return to the natural disciplines...[these] can only be restored as a result of a balanced national budget, a limitation on the volume of circulating paper money of all kinds, and the abandonment of import restrictions and duties so that all home production in cost and quality is constantly challenged by the alternative of the product from overseas\\".Letter: 'Economic and morale problems facing Britain', The Times (30 November 1964), p. 12. On imports, he argued against Sir Roy Harrod's proposals for protectionism: \\"Excessive imports arise as a result of an excessive volume of purchasing power introduced into the community as a result of excessive Government spending. That is the basic cause of the trouble. That is where the remedy should begin...The answer to the problem is not to impose import restrictions but to completely free imports and so conduct our internal affairs as to balance budgets, provide for the repayment of debt and thereby automatically limit the ability to pay for imports as near as possible to those imports that can be most profitably used\\".Letter: 'No restriction', The Times (10 August 1965), p. 7. Alexander also advocated abolishing all exchange controls so that \\"individuals could freely carry on their business and even use their automatically reduced resources even to resume their profitable overseas investment which has stood our people in good stead in two world wars. The need is to create the conditions of freedom in which new wealth can be accumulated\\".Letter: 'A way out of economic danger', The Times (9 July 1966), p. 9. He argued against Sir Alec Douglas-Home's view that going into the Common Market would provide a larger market for British industry: \\"The greatest handicap to British industry is not that we have not a sufficiently large market but that owing to the protectionist policy now pursued for 50 years our people are not allowed to buy raw materials and goods from the cheapest market. And, if we cannot buy cheaply we cannot produce competitively. That has been the primary cause of our country's decline in its share of world trade and shipping...Entry into Europe would I believe be but an extension of that protectionism which has already done immense damage to our country\\".Letter: 'Britain needs to buy raw materials from the cheapest market', The Times (23 April 1971), p. 22.

Its steeples are prominently visible to traffic passing through the city since the construction of the elevated US 9 expressway in 1965. The congregation first formed in 1854 as Christ Church. Six years later, it had incorporated and hired Richard Upjohn, a prominent architect noted for his churches, to design a building. His original plans are on file at Columbia University's Avery Library. The cornerstone - located at the southwest buttress of the tower was laid on June 14, 1859 and the church was consecrated by Bishop Horatio Potter on October 25, 1860. Holy Comforter is a cruciform church with walls of local Ulster County bluestone - from across the river and trim of New Jersey Brownstone. Inside, the original pews are still in place (note - the original church was \\"free\\" which meant that it did not have pews - as it was customary at the time to charge a fee for pews and this church was meant for the working people and poor of this area) and the vaulted ceiling is supported with Carpenter Gothic- style wooden ribs. It is now known as the Parish of the Holy Comforter in the Diocese of the Resurrection of the Holy Catholic Church (Anglican Rite) and is no longer affiliated with the Episcopal Church. Its break with the Episcopal Church grows out of disagreements and events in the 1970s. On April 13, 1972, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

The same trademark or service may be (or in many cases MUST be) classified in several classes, and some countries permit several classes to be registered in the same document. There are fees ordinarily associated with each classification, whether for initial application or later renewal. An application filed for descriptions covering more than one class of goods or services may also be divided later (for a fee) into several different applications for synchronization with a phased roll-out of multiple classes of products. Because of international priority claim issues, classes may be deleted from an application but not added after the initial filing date. There are often disputes regarding the exact classification to apply in an application, partly because prior registrations may already occupy broad areas that overlap the products described by a later applicant. Many countries permit marks to cover an entire class without regard to specific descriptions of goods or services. There is a general classification of marks into trademarks, service marks, certification marks and collective marks, each of which have slightly different rules. Within the broad categories of trademarks and service marks there are dozens of international classes defined for each category. See, e.g., International (Nice) Classification of Goods and Services. For the purpose of obtaining a trademark clearance, it is advisable to search all related classifications of goods and services that could interact with or be supplied by a potentially confusing mark that already exists. In the United States, the USPTO maintains the Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual to assist applicants and examiners to distinguish between classifications properly and consistently. Specific descriptions must be submitted for each type of goods and services to be covered by the registration, and overly broad terms will be rejected, depending upon how \\"crowded\\" a classification may be.

Early life Grey was the third son and heir of Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset (1455‚Äì1501), at that time England's only marquess, and his wife, Cecily Bonville, the daughter and heiress of William Bonville, 6th Baron Harington of Aldingham. His mother was suo jure 7th Baroness Harington of Aldingham and 2nd Baroness Bonville, and the richest heiress in England. The first marquess was the eldest son of Elizabeth Woodville, a stepson of King Edward IV and a half-brother of King Edward V.Grey, Thomas, second marquess of Dorset (1477‚Äì1530), magnate and courtier (login required) by Robert C. Braddock in Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2004) According to some reports, the young Grey attended Magdalen College School, Oxford, and he is uncertainly said to have been taught (either at the school or else privately tutored) by the future Cardinal Wolsey. Grey's father was opposed to King Richard III, and after the older Thomas joined Buckingham's failed rebellion of 1483, father and son fled to Brittany, joining Henry Tudor. Five months after Richard lost the crown to Henry at the Battle of Bosworth Field on 22 August 1485, the new king married the first Dorset's half-sister Elizabeth of York, but Henry VII was also suspicious of Dorset, who was imprisoned during Lambert Simnel's rebellion of 1487.T. B. Pugh, Henry VII and the English nobility, in The Tudor nobility, ed. G. W. Bernard (Manchester, 1992), 49‚Äì110 In 1492, Dorset was required to give guarantees of loyalty to the crown and to make the young Thomas Grey a ward of the king. Courtier The remains of Dorset's house at Bradgate Park Amongst the Queen of England's closest relations, Grey and his younger brothers Leonard and Edward were welcome at court and became courtiers and later soldiers. In 1494, Grey was made a knight of the Bath and in 1501 a knight of the Garter. Also in 1501, his father died and the younger Thomas inherited his titles and some of his estates. However, much of the first marquess's land went to his widow and not to his son, who did not come into his full inheritance until the death of his mother in 1529, shortly before his own death. Later in 1501, he was 'chief answerer' at the marriage of Arthur, Prince of Wales and Catherine of Aragon and was presented with a diamond and ruby Tudor rose at a court tournament. But in 1508 he was sent to the Tower of London, and later a gaol in Calais, under suspicion of conspiracy against Henry VII. Although he was saved from execution in 1509 by the accession of King Henry VIII, Grey was attainted and lost his titles. However, later in 1509 he was pardoned and returned to court, and was summoned to parliament as Baron Ferrers of Groby. In 1511, he was summoned as Marquess of Dorset. From 1509, Dorset was again an active courtier and took part with great distinction in many court tournaments, on one occasion in March 1524 nearly killing the king.Edward Hall, The triumphant reigne of kyng Henry the VIII, ed.

He helped with the entertainment of the court by maintaining a company of actors.Walker, Greg, Plays of persuasion: drama and politics at the court of Henry VIII (Cambridge University Press, 1991) In 1521, Dorset sat in judgment on the Duke of Buckingham, despite being related to him by marriage. After his father's death, Dorset's mother had married a brother of the Duke. Henry VIII rewarded Dorset with three of Buckingham's manors.Miller, Helen, Henry VIII and the English nobility (Basil Blackwell, Oxford, 1986) From 17 June 1523 until his death in 1530, Dorset was Justice in Eyre south of Trent.Turner, G.J., The Justices of the Forest South of Trent in The English Historical Review 18 (1903) pp. 112‚Äì116 As such, he presided at the triennial Court of justice-seat, which dealt with matters of forest law. In 1524, Dorset's Leicestershire feud with Lord Hastings turned into a fight between hundreds of men, and Cardinal Wolsey took action.Robertson, M. L., Court careers and county quarrels: George Lord Hastings and Leicestershire unrest, 1509‚Äì1529 in State, sovereigns and society: essays in early modern English history, ed. Charles Carleton (Sutton Publishing, 1998), pp. 153‚Äì169 Both rivals had to put up a bond for good behaviour of one thousand pounds, and Dorset was sent to Wales as Lord Master of Princess Mary's Council. In 1528, Dorset became constable of Warwick Castle, and in 1529 of Kenilworth Castle. In 1529, recalling his role as 'chief answerer' at the marriage of Arthur, Prince of Wales, Dorset was a critical witness in favour of Henry VIII's divorce of Catherine of Aragon. He strongly supported the King's contention that Arthur and Catherine's marriage had been consummated. In 1530, in the final months of his life, he assisted the King in the condemnation of Cardinal Wolsey. Soldier In 1512, Dorset led an unsuccessful English military expedition to France to reconquer Aquitaine, which England had lost during the Hundred Years' War. Ferdinand of Aragon gave none of the support he had promised. While Ferdinand delayed and tried to persuade Dorset to help him to attack Navarre instead of Aquitaine, the English army's food, beer, and pay ran out, many took to wine and became ill, and the army mutinied. Back in England, Dorset had to face a trial.Vergil, Polydore, The Anglica Historia of Polydore Vergil, AD 1485-1537 (translated by Denys Hay), Office of the Royal Historical Society, Camden Series, London, 1950. In 1513, he fought at the siege of Tournai and the Battle of Guinegate (also known as the Battle of the Spurs), and fought again in 1523 in the Scottish borders. These all gave him chances to make amends for the debacle of Aquitaine. To help Dorset in dealing with the Scots, he was appointed Lord Warden of the Marches, restored to the Privy Council, and became a gentleman of the chamber. Family Grey was the son and heir of Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset (c. 1456‚Äì1501), and his wife, Cecily Bonville, daughter and heiress of William Bonville, 6th Baron Harington of Aldingham and of Lady Katherine Neville (1442‚Äì1503) and granddaughter of Alice Neville, 5th Countess of Salisbury (1407‚Äì1462). Cecily Bonville's maternal uncles included Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick (called 'Warwick the Kingmaker'), John Neville, 1st Marquess of Montagu and George Neville, Archbishop of York and Chancellor of England, while her aunts had married Henry de Beauchamp, 1st Duke of Warwick, William FitzAlan, 16th Earl of Arundel, Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby, and John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford. Cecily Bonville succeeded her father as Baroness Harington in 1460, and two months later succeeded her great-grandfather William Bonville as Baron Bonville. at thepeerage.com (accessed 25 November 2007)On Cecily's death in 1530, her son Thomas inherited both of her baronies.

After the death of her first husband, another Oliver St John (died 1437), she married John Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset (1404‚Äì1444), producing Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond.

His second wife survived him and died in or after 1535. His younger brother Leonard Grey, 1st Viscount Grane (c. 14791541) served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1536 to 1540. Dorset's son Henry succeeded him as Marquess of Dorset, married Lady Frances Brandon, a granddaughter of King Henry VII, and in 1551 (on the death of his brother-in-law Charles Brandon, 3rd Duke of Suffolk) become Duke of Suffolk, by way of a new creation. Dorset's granddaughter Lady Jane Grey was the designated successor of King Edward VI by his will, and for nine days in July 1553 briefly sat on the throne of England. In 1554, together with Dorset's other surviving sons, Lord John Grey and Lord Thomas Grey, Suffolk took part in Wyatt's rebellion against Mary I's marriage to Philip of Spain and in support of Lady Jane Grey.Grey, Lord John (d. 1564), nobleman by Stanford Lehmberg in Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2004) When this rebellion failed, all three were arrested, and Suffolk and his brother Thomas were executed, as were Lady Jane herself and her husband Lord Guildford Dudley. Lord John Grey survived, and in July 1603 his youngest son, Henry Grey, was restored to the House of Lords by King James I as Baron Grey of Groby.

Playing career Stump was a member of three consecutive Southwest Conference championship teams as a quarterback for Texas A&M.; He was pressed into duty as a freshman in 1984 after standout Kevin Murray was injured in an early-season non-conference game. Although Stump filled in capably completing 94 of his 189 attempts for 1135 yards, he would spend his sophomore and junior seasons on the bench watching Murray break most of the Aggies' passing records. Since the NCAA had granted Murray an extra year of eligibility, considering the 1984 year a medical redshirt season, it appeared that Stump would spend his senior year as a backup once again. When Murray decided to leave school early for the National Football League Draft, Stump had his opportunity. Because of the loss of Murray and several other key Aggie players after the 1986 season, expectations were not high entering the 1987 campaign. Surprising many, Stump and freshman phenom Bucky Richardson led the Aggies to an unexpected conference championship and a third straight Cotton Bowl Classic appearance, a 35‚Äì10 victory over Notre Dame and Heisman Trophy- winner Tim Brown.

It was directed by Joe May and is a scene-for-scene remake of the 1935 German film Mazurka starring Pola Negri, which Warner Brothers Studios acquired the U.S. distribution rights for and then shelved in favour of the remake. With an estimated $513,000 budget, it started production in March 1937 and was released August 19, 1937, in New York City. Plot \\"In a European city in the year 1930,\\" 17-year-old music student Lisa Koslov (Bryan) sees her mother off at the train station, and as she is leaving, is handed an envelope containing two tickets to a piano concert she suspects come from a well- dressed man she thinks may be stalking her. Her friend Hildegard persuades her to attend the concert and realizes the man is the pianist himself, the renowned Michael Michailow (Rathbone). On Lisa's behalf, Hidegard accepts Michailow's dinner invitation to Lisa when she has misgivings. There he suavely pleads his loneliness and begs to see her the next day. When she goes to her conservatory lessons instead, she discovers that he has lied to the professor to insinuate himself as her tutor. Michailow kisses Lisa, who despite awareness that the situation is unsavory, responds to the kiss. The third day, when her mother returns, Michailow calls Lisa at home and persuades her to sneak out. He takes her to a seamy cabaret to continue his patient seduction where he won't be recognized. During a suggestive number sung by tawdry chanteuse Vera Kowalska (Francis), the couple are illuminated in a spotlight as Michailow again kisses Lisa. Vera and Michailow recognize one another and she faints from shock. He tries to leave hastily with Lisa, but Vera shoots him dead. At her trial Vera confesses to the murder but refuses to disclose her motive. As the lawyers are making their closing speeches, her newly discovered suitcase is brought as evidence before the presiding judge (Crisp). When he orders it opened to attempt to determine if it contains mitigating evidence, Vera abruptly decides to give a full statement to the court if the suitcase is not opened and the courtroom cleared of all witnesses and spectators. Vera reveals that in 1912 she was a young diva in Warsaw appearing in an opera composed by Michailow, a womanizer who claimed to be madly in love with her. She left the company to marry soldier Leonide Kirow (Hunter), and three years later was a mother with a husband at war. At her doctor's advice, Vera attended a charity ball, where she was reunited with her old company, including Michailow. He lured her to a party at his apartment, where she became drunk and passed out. The next morning, while pondering how to tell her husband before gossip reached him, he returned from the front as an amputee, and out of a sense of guilt she remained silent. Michailow bombarded her with letters begging to see her, which she hid from Leonide without answering them, until one day she went to Michailow to warn him to stop. Leonide followed her, and thinking the worse, sued her for adultery. Michailow fled to avoid testifying on her behalf, and she was found guilty, losing custody of her daughter. For fifteen years, reduced to being a cheap singer, Vera searched Europe for Leonide (who had changed his name to Koslov and disappeared) and her child. When she at last located them (the day of the shooting), she learned that Leonide has been dead three years and that he had remarried. Her daughter, who is Lisa, has no idea that the second wife is not her real mother. Vera's suitcase contains papers proving her statement, and she testified to prevent them from being read in open court, to save Lisa's reputation and her relationship with the woman she believes is her mother. When open session resumes, all the parties avoid any mention of the details, and while Vera is found guilty, her sentence is mitigated and Lisa is left unaware of the truth.

The ship was in reserve for most of the first decade of her existence. After the beginning of the First World War in August 1914, she was assigned to coastal defence duties on the East Coast of England. Patrol was badly damaged during the German bombardment of Hartlepool in mid-December 1914 when she attempted to exit the harbour during the bombardment. After repairs were completed she remained on coast defence duties until she was transferred to the Irish Sea in 1918. The ship was paid off in 1919 and sold for scrap in 1920. Design and description The Pathfinder-class ships were one of four classes of scout cruisers ordered by the Admiralty in 1902‚Äì1903 and 1903‚Äì1904 Naval Programmes. These ships were intended to work with destroyer flotillas, leading their torpedo attacks and backing them up when attacked by other destroyers, although they quickly became less useful as destroyer speeds increased before the First World War. They had a length between perpendiculars of , a beam of and a draught of at deep load. The ships displaced at normal load and at deep load. Their crew consisted of 289 officers and ratings.Friedman 2009, pp. 100, 294 The ships were powered by a pair of three-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by a dozen Laird-Normand boilers.

They also carried eight 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and two above-water 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, one on each broadside. The ships' protective deck armour ranged in thickness from and the conning tower had armour inches thick. They had a waterline belt thick. Construction and career Patrol was laid down on 31 October 1903 by Cammel Laird in their Birkenhead shipyard. She was launched on 13 October 1904 and completed on 26 September 1905.Morris, p. 113 Not long after completion, two additional 12-pounder guns were added and the 3-pounder guns were replaced with six QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss guns.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 85 The ship was in initially in reserve until she was assigned to the Home Fleet in October 1907 and then the 3rd Fleet at the Nore Command in 1908. In 1909 she served a short spell as leader of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla (DF) at Portsmouth, then moved to the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla and was fitted at HM Dockyard, Chatham, in June before rejoining the 1st later in the year. Patrol was back in reserve in 1912.Gardiner & Gray, p. 17 About 1911‚Äì1912, her main guns were replaced by nine guns, arranged four on each broadside and the remaining gun on the quarterdeck.McBride, p. 274 She was stationed at Haulbowline in 1913‚Äì14. The ship recommissioned on 27 January 1914 to serve as the leader of the 9th Destroyer Flotilla. At the beginning of the First World War in August, the 9th DF was protecting the north east coastline between the Firth of Forth and the Tyne. On 15 December, under the command of Captain Alan C. Bruce, she was berthed in Hartlepool with , another scout cruiser, four destroyers from the 9th Flotilla (, , and ) and the submarine . Hartlepool was a tidal harbour, and at low tide it was difficult for the cruisers to get out to sea. On 16 December, the destroyers put out to sea at 05:30 and had reported that the tide was very low and the swell outside the harbour was very high. Brown decided that it was too dangerous for the cruisers and C9 to go out on patrol.Massie, pp. 322‚Äì323 At 08:00 the flotilla sighted the German battlecruisers and and the armoured cruiser , preparing to bombard Hartlepool. The heavy German ships chased off the hopelessly outgunned destroyers and opened fire on Hartlepool's two coastal artillery batteries, which mounted three guns, before bombarding the port and harbour entrance. Bruce attempted to leave the harbour, but was engaged by Bl√ºcher in the channel to the open sea and hit by two shells. Four men were killed and seven wounded, and Bruce had to beach his ship. The German ships broke off the raid before finishing off the cruiser.Massie, p. 323 Badly holed, Patrol had taken on too much water to return to Hartlepool, but was able to reach the Middlesbrough docks.Corbett, p. 35 After undergoing extensive repairs she joined the 7th Destroyer Flotilla in the Humber in 1915.

In addition to teaching at the Insight Meditation Center in Cambridge, he is also a senior teacher at the Insight Meditation Society in Barre, Massachusetts. Rosenberg was born to Russian-Jewish immigrants and grew up in Coney Island in a working-class family. His father, who had Marxist leanings, came from 14 generations of rabbis. Rosenberg got his BS at Brooklyn College and his Ph.D. in social psychology from the University of Chicago, where he also subsequently taught. He later became an assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry at Harvard. Disappointed with his experience with the academia, he turned to intensive Buddhist practice. A major turning point that influenced this decision was his introduction to the teachings of Jiddu Krishnamurti and Vimala Thakar. He received Zen training with Korean Master Seung Sahn and Japanese Master Katagiri Roshi for eight years before coming to Vipassana. Anagarika Munindra was his first Vipassana teacher. His book Breath by Breath is a clear description of the practice of anapanasati (mindful breath meditation). His emphasis on the breath as an object of meditation was, in part, inspired by his encounter with the Thai meditation teacher Buddhadasa. Anapanasati also forms the basis of his teachings at the Cambridge Insight Meditation Center.  Books  * L.

Bury, The Imperial Administrative System in the Ninth Century (London, 1911), p. 93. It has been asserted by some, such as author Michael Antonucci, that the Bureau of Barbarians acted as a sort of espionage office for the Empire. There is however no evidence that it was an espionage office, or even that it survived the reform of the \\"master of offices\\" position under Leo III, 717-741‚Äîthough there is a lead seal bearing the name of a man, Peter, who was (\\"protospatharios and in charge of the barbarians\\"), which is dated to the 9th century.Bury, p. 93 The agentes in rebus within the postal system are noted elsewhere for maintaining a domestic intelligence gathering function in the Roman Empire into the 8th century, and hold a stronger claim to having been an imperial intelligence service than the Bureau of Barbarians. As its function seems to have dealt with the various barbarian nations with which the Empire had dealings, including translation, communication and correspondence, the Bureau of Barbarians would have had an intelligence function in the broadest modern sense, as distinct from espionage. The Greek term barbarian, ancient in its origin, came to be used as a pejorative to refer to non-Greek- speaking peoples, i.e. foreigners. Its official use during the Roman era reflected the Roman/Byzantine viewpoint that Roman civilization was the most advanced in mankind.

There are several techniques for treatment‚Äîincluding surgical and non-surgical methods. A square lower jaw can be considered a masculine trait, especially in Asian countries. As a result, whereas square lower jaws are often considered a positive trait in men, a wide mandible can be perceived as discordant or masculine on women, or sometimes in certain men, particularly when there is asymmetry. A wide lower face can primarily be caused by a wide mandibular bone or large masseter muscle. A large masseter muscle can be reduced in apparent size with the use of botox injections whereas having a wide mandibular bone requires surgical intervention to reduce the size of the bones. Consultation and patient evaluation  A facial structure with a larger mandible arch and wide zygoma is common, particularly among Asians, although it is also present in other populations. It can also be the result of certain developmental disorders such as acromegaly. Prior to selection of a treatment, the patient is examined to determine whether the wide jaw is due to the bone size, the masseter muscle or both. Three-dimensional analysis of the clinical photos, X-rays and 3D CT scans from the front, lateral, oblique, basal and overhead views are required for a detailed evaluation. The level of protrusion of the mandible angle, the size of the masseter muscle and the overall structure of the jaw are evaluated. Based on the analysis and face-to-face consultation, the surgery plan can be created to produce the desired aesthetic results. Surgical method Surgical techniques are used to directly reduce the size of a large mandible. Depending on the candidate's individual facial structure, either mandibular resection can be performed alone or in conjunction with a sagittal mandibular reduction. The surgery is performed under general anesthesia through tracheal intubation. The standard surgical procedure uses an intraoral approach, as it leaves no visible scars. A guarded oscillating saw is first used to mark the proposed osteotomy line to avoid excessive resection of the mandibular bone. Following this process, the bone resection is then performed with the appropriate size of oscillating saws. Additional sagittal split ramus resection can be performed using a burr.  Surgery complications  Inferior alveolar nerve is the most important anatomic structure during mandible reduction surgery and great care should be taken to avoid injury to this nerve. Potential complications include injury to the inferior alveolar nerve which provides permanent numbness and damage to the lower lip and even death. Another factor to consider is the mentalis muscle which elevates the lower lip and chin. During the surgery, the mentalis muscles should be carefully reattached after the mandible bone has been excised. Failure to reattach the mentalis muscles will lead to the chin and lower lip to sag, causing permanent damage.  Post-surgery symptoms  Common symptoms include haematoma, infection, asymmetry, over- or under-correction of the mandibular bone, sensory deficit. Excluding asymmetry and over- or under- correction, the other symptoms dissipate within three to six months post- surgery. Individuals with abundant soft tissue or thick skin may consider an additional lifting procedure done simultaneously with the jaw reduction surgery, as there is a high possibility of sagging soft tissue. Age and skin elasticity level also determines whether a lifting procedure is required.  Non-surgical method  Botox injection Non-surgical techniques are essentially limited to cases in which the masseter is enlarged. While a masseter muscle can be large due to genetic reasons, it can commonly be an acquired trait. Like any muscle it increases in size with exercise. Behaviors such as repeated gum chewing, teeth clenching, or bruxism can contribute to enlargement of the muscle. A convenient method to treat an enlarged muscle is through the use of botox injections. Botox is injected into the muscle, weakening it so it slowly becomes smaller through atrophy over several months. There is no down-time and improvement is gradual‚Äîindividuals who interact with the patient may never know that a plastic surgical procedure was performed The use of Botox for jaw reduction has been studied scientifically. Improvement is generally not seen for at least 2 ‚Äì 3 weeks. Peak improvement occurs at months 3 to 9 with good results still observable at one year in many patients. The procedure can result in temporary paralysis of the muscles that move the lips, a rare, but danger acknowledged complication.

First staged in 1641 or 1642 and first published in 1652, it is generally ranked as one of Brome's best plays, and one of the best comedies of the Caroline period; in one critic's view, Brome's The Antipodes and A Jovial Crew \\"outrank all but the best of Jonson.\\"Catherine M. Shaw, quoted in Logan and Smith, p. 182. Publication The play was first published in 1652, in a quarto printed by James Young for the booksellers Edward Dod and Nathaniel Ekins.Dod and Ekins shared a shop at the sign of the Gun in Ivy Lane; Plomer, pp. 65, 70. The volume contains Brome's dedication of the play to Thomas Stanley. The quarto also features prefatory verses composed by James Shirley, John Tatham, and Alexander Brome among others. The play was Brome's most popular work during its own historical era, and was reprinted in 1661 (by bookseller Henry Brome),Henry Brome was no relation to the playwright; he joined Ekins at the sign of the Gun in Ivy Lane sometime before 1659 (Dod had died or retired in 1657), and continued after Ekins left the business in 1660. Henry Brome co-published the 1659 edition of Brome's dramas, Five New Plays, with Andrew Crooke. He was succeeded in his business by his son, another Henry Brome; Plomer, p. 34. 1684 (by Joseph Hindmarsh), and 1708 (C. Brome). Performance The title page of the first edition states that the play debuted at the Cockpit Theatre in Drury Lane in 1641. That theatre had recently returned to the management of Brome's friend and colleague William Beeston, after a period under the control of their rival Sir William Davenant. In his dedication to Stanley in the 1652 quarto, Brome states that A Jovial Crew \\"had the luck to tumble last of all in the epidemical ruin of the scene\\" ‚Äî which has been interpreted to mean that the play was the last work acted before the Puritan authorities closed the London theatres on 2 September 1642, at the start of the English Civil War.See Ann Haaker's edition of the play, pp. xi‚Äìxii. The play was revived early in the Restoration era, and proved an enduring favourite with its audience. Samuel Pepys recorded seeing multiple performances of the play in his Diary ‚Äì twice in 1661, and again in 1662 and in 1669.Specifically, 25 June 1661; 27 August 1661; 21 January 1662 and 11 January 1669 (dates new style). The play remained in the active repertory when the King's Company and the Duke's Company joined to form the United Company in 1695. The publication of the play's fourth edition in 1708 was motivated by a revival at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane that year. In what may be a case of mutual influence, John Gay might have drawn upon A Jovial Crew when he created his Beggar's Opera in 1728. In turn, the great success of Gay's work may have inspired the adaptation of A Jovial Crew into a similar ballad opera (comparable to a modern musical): in 1731, Matthew Concanen, Edward Roome, and Sir William Yonge produced their adaptation, The Jovial Crew. In this musical form, the work remained a staple of the English stage for the next half-century, and was performed as late as 1791.Schultz, p. 167. The play was staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company in the Swan Theatre at Stratford-upon-Avon in 1992, in a modern adaptation by playwright Stephen Jeffries. Genre A Jovial Crew partakes of a long-standing tradition of \\"green world comedy\\"Catherine M. Shaw, quoted in Logan and Smith, pp. 181‚Äì2. in English Renaissance theatre, which employed a retreat from society into nature to reflect back upon the social world. Pastoral was a prior form of such drama, though as the seventeenth century wore on, pastoral came to seem an ever-more dated form; and the alternative of plays on gypsies and \\"merry beggars\\" began to fill its place. The Beaumont and Fletcher play Beggars' Bush (c. 1612‚Äì13?; revised by Massinger c. 1622) was a key development in this direction. Ben Jonson's 1621, masque The Gypsies Metamorphosed is also worth noting, since Brome was a self-styled follower of Jonson. Several works in the canon of Thomas Dekker and his collaborators, notably The Spanish Gypsy, belong in the same category.Similarly, the era also saw Robin-Hood-style \\"merry outlaws\\" plays, Like Sir John Suckling's The Goblins (1638). Indeed, Brome's play is only one item in a literature on beggars and their habits and music that grew throughout the century, from Samuel Rowlands' Slang Beggars' Songs (1610) to Daniel Defoe's The Complete Mendicant (1699).Ribton-Turner, pp. 601‚Äì24. Brome's contribution to this literature has attracted the attention of specialist scholars, for its songs and for its preservation of the particular linguistic forms of the Caroline underclass. Synopsis The play's opening scene introduces Oldrents and Hearty, two rural gentlemen and landowners. Oldrents is a generous and warmhearted countryman, who represents the best of the traditional order of England; but he is depressed and pre- occupied with a fortune-teller's prediction, that his two daughters will become beggars. Hearty, a younger and temperamentally more phlegmatic man, works to cheer up his neighbour, and Oldrents tries to adopt a lighter demeanor. Oldrent's steward Springlove enters, to present the bookkeeping accounts and the keys of the estate, and to request leave to follow the beggars about the countryside for the spring and summer. Oldrents is unhappy about this: he wants his young steward to behave more conventionally, more like a gentleman ‚Äî and offers to furnish him with funds and a servant (\\"Take horse, and man, and money\\") for respectable travelling. Yet Springlove rebels at this conventionality. The bird calls of the nightingale and cuckoo call him to vagabondage. (The play's stage directions repeatedly refer to summer birdsong.) As Oldrent's steward, Springlove has been a friend to the local beggars, feeding them generously and furnishing their needs; and once he joins them it turns out that he is something of a leader among them. Oldrents' daughters Rachel and Meriel are shown with their childhood sweethearts and suitors Vincent and Hilliard. The two young women deplore their father's depressed mood, and the staid order of their lives; they long for \\"liberty.\\" Vincent proposes \\"a fling to London\\" to take in the races at Hyde Park, \\"and see the Adamites run naked afore the Ladies\\" ‚Äî but the young women are determined to go in the opposite direction, and join the \\"stark, errant, downright beggars.\\" They challenge their suitors to join them, and the young men can hardly refuse; they link up with Springlove's band, and enjoy his protection and guidance. It is their \\"birthright into a new world.\\" Their initial efforts at the vagabond life are uneven, however; sleeping rough in the straw of a barn is less comfortable than a bed at home. When they try to beg, they employ the elaborate and courtly language they're used to, and ask for ridiculous sums, 5 or 10 or 20 pounds. Yet they persist with the beggars, and the play shows Springlove and his companions in their activities and celebrations. Oldrents is distressed to find that his daughters have left home; but Hearty prevails upon him to persist in his efforts to be cheerful. The plot thickens with the introduction of Amie and Martin. Amie has fled from the home of her uncle and guardian, Justice Clack, to avoid an arranged marriage with the ridiculous Talboy; she is escorted by the justice's clerk Martin, Hearty's nephew. They have disguised themselves in the clothing of the common people, and travelled toward Hearty's country estate ‚Äì though they are pursued by Clack's son Oliver and by beadles and other officers. Martin wants to marry Amie himself, though she sours on the idea as she travels with him and learns more of his character. Once Amie meets Springlove, she quickly falls in love with him. Oliver, chasing Amie, meets Rachel and Meriel; he is attracted to them, and propositions them. He also gets into a disagreement with Vincent and Hilliard, which threatens to lead them to the \\"field of hnour\\" and a duel. Oliver visits the estate of Oldrents, and makes him aware of the pursuit of Amie ‚Äì thereby drawing Oldrents and Hearty into the matter. The pursuing authorities round up many of the beggars and take them into custody, bringing them to Justice Clack. Oldrents and Hearty arrive at Clack's home; the beggars arrange to stage a play for the gentlemen. (As with his earlier The Antipodes, Brome incorporates the metatheatrical device of a play within a play into A Jovial Crew. Brome exploits the traditional equation of \\"strolling players\\" with vagabonds, by letting his vagabonds function as actors.) Oldrents is offered a choice of plays, with titles like The Two Lost Daughters, and The Vagrant Steward, and The Beggar's Prophecy. The old man recognises all of them as versions of his own life, and rejects them, as \\"a story that I know too well. I'll see none of them.\\" He finally settles on The Merry Beggars ‚Äî but that too proves to be a version of his tale. The beggars' playlet reveals that Oldrents' grandfather had taken advantage of a neighbour named Wrought-on, acquiring his land and reducing the man the beggary. The Patrico, the leader of the beggars, turns out to be the grandson of that Wrought-on; he is also the fortune-teller who had given Oldrents the original forecast of his daughters' beggary. And the Patrico also explains Oldrents' strangely strong affection for Springlove: the young beggar/steward is Oldrents' illegitimate son, born of a beggar-woman who was Patrico's sister. The family linkage allows the play's reconciliation: Oldrents embraces his son, and restores Wrought-on's property. Rachel and Meriel are ready to leave vagabondage and settle down with Vincent and Hilliard, as Springlove is with Amie. (Martin and Talboy have to reconcile themselves to continued bachelorhood, at least for the present; Hearty assures his nephew Martin that he'll help him find a wife. And the young people agree with Oliver to forget about the potential duel, and about the fact that Oliver propositioned the two Oldrents daughters for twelvepence apiece.) The play's complications yield to a happy ending. Relevance While Brome's A Jovial Crew had links with the theatre and literature of its period, the play also drew upon actual events and the social realities of its era. The tumultuous years leading up to the start of the Civil War saw some significant economic dislocations; local authorities in England complained of \\"the great number of rogues and vagabonds and sturdy beggars wandering and lurking in the country, to the great trouble and terror of the same.\\"Cressy, p. 354; see also pp. 347‚Äì78. Brome's play provided at least a limited recognition of this socio-economic underside of Caroline England. A Jovial Crew incorporates the type of political satire that is not unusual in dramas of its era. Justice Clack is portrayed as a dictatorial windbag. His \\"rule\\" is \\"to punish before I examine,\\" by the mere facial expressions of the unfortunates brought before him ‚Äî :I have taken a hundred examinations i' my days of felons, and other offenders, out of their very countenances; and wrote them down verbatim, to what they would have said. I am sure it has serv'd to hang some of 'em, and whip the rest. Yet Brome goes farther in A Jovial Crew than most dramatists of his era ever dared. His genteel characters find their comfortable lives intolerably oppressive, and long for liberty and freedom, even that of beggars. The references to the Adamites, and to a Utopia of a new social order, seem to presage the radical social movements of the coming Commonwealth era, the Levellers and Diggers and others. The idealisation of the beggars' life, as unrealistic as it is, appears to point to a profound social dissatisfaction. How much of this came through during stage performances of the play? Perhaps not much, especially after the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660. The second of the performances noted by Pepys, on 27 August 1661, was attended by both King Charles II and his brother the Duke of York, eventually to reign as James II. The version of the play they saw most likely had any political rough edges smoothed away.  References   Notes  * Cressy, David. England on Edge: Crisis and Revolution, 1640‚Äì1642.

Canada geese at the Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area. Sacramento is on the horizon.The Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area is located within the Yolo Bypass in Yolo County, California. The wildlife area is managed by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife with the intent of restoring and managing a variety of wildlife habitats in the Yolo Basin, a natural basin in the north part of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. The creation of the wildlife area was spearheaded by the Yolo Basin Foundation. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife and Yolo Basin Foundation are the core partners in the operation of this unique community resource. Located at History The wildlife area was open to the public in 1997 after extensive restoration efforts completed by Ducks Unlimited with federal funds appropriated through the United States Army Corps of Engineers. In 1999, this restoration project was named the Vic Fazio Yolo Wildlife Area in honor of congressman Vic Fazio who lobbied hard for the funds needed to build the project. In 2001 the wildlife area expanded to over with the acquisition of the Glide and Los Rios properties. These acquisitions included the Tule Ranch, a working cattle ranch with extensive vernal pool areas. The entrance to the wildlife area during a major flood. Habitats, Flora, & Fauna Most wetland on the wildlife area are managed as seasonal wetlands. They go through an extensive dry period during the spring and summer months. Typically these ponds are drained April 1 to stimulate the germination of Swamp Timothy. They may receive a brief summer irrigation and then are flooded in September to provide wetland habitat for migratory waterfowl and shorebirds. The threatened giant garter snake is found in aquatic habitats in much of the wildlife area. Permanent wetlands are flooded year round and tend to be deeper and have more emergent vegetation. These ponds provide important brood water for resident aquatic birds such as mallards, common moorhens and pied-billed grebes. They also provide drinking water for wildlife as well as relief from intense summer heat. This habitat is used extensively for roosting by black-crowned night herons, egrets, and white-faced ibis. The giant garter snake also occurs in this habitat. Upland habitats are used extensively by ground nesting birds such northern harriers, western meadowlarks, mallards and ring-necked pheasant. Vegetation is typically dominated by annual rye grass, curly dock and wild sunflower. Rodent populations in these areas provide prey for large numbers of wintering birds of prey. Approximately of natural uplands occur in the southwest portion of the wildlife area. There are several vernal pools in this area that are home to such invertebrate species as tadpole shrimp, clam shrimp and the endangered conservancy fairy shrimp. Rare and endangered plants include Heckert's pepperweed and Ferris' alkali milk vetch. Grassland bird species in this area include grasshopper sparrow, Savannah sparrow and burrowing owl. Extensive fields of wildflowers occur in the spring on the Tule Ranch. Riparian vegetation consists of willows, cottonwoods, black walnut and other tree species. Nesting species here include Swainson's hawks, great-horned owls, wood ducks, tree swallows, and black phoebe. This habitat is very important for neo-tropical migrants such as blue grosbeak, ash-throated flycatchers, and a variety of warbler species. Most riparian vegetation is located along Putah Creek in the central part of the wildlife area. Agriculture is an integral part of the management of the wildlife area. Other uses Flood control The Yolo Bypass is a flood control channel that protects Sacramento and other cities from flooding. The wildlife area was created with the understanding that it would remain completely compatible with this primary flood control function. For this reason, there are restrictions on the density of emergent vegetation and riparian trees within the wildlife area. These standards are determined through the use of hydrological models. Located at the north end of the Yolo Basin where Putah Creek enters the Yolo Bypass, this part of the Delta is known as the Putah Sinks and hosts a diverse assemblage of wildlife species inhabiting seasonal wetlands, permanent wetlands, riparian forest, uplands, vernal pools and agricultural habitats. White-fronted geese rising into a November sunrise. Agriculture An interesting feature of the wildlife area is the extensive use of agriculture to achieve its wildlife habitat goals, while providing important operating income. In the northern portions of the wildlife area, rice is grown, which is then flooded after harvest, attracting thousands of waterfowl and shorebirds in full view of the thousands of automobiles on Interstate 80. Wildlife managers have instituted a rotation within the rice fields that allows for a fallow stage every three years. During this fallow stage, the field is managed for migratory shorebirds by flooding during the mid-summer months. Public use Kids learn about wetlands in the \\"Discover the Flyway\\" program. California Department of Fish and Wildlife mobile aquarium at California Duck Days The wildlife area is open every day (except Christmas) for wildlife viewing and fishing. There are monthly tours on the second Saturday of each month conducted by volunteers from the Yolo Basin Foundation. Other public use opportunities are provided by the Yolo Basin Foundation and Fish and Wildlife including bat tours, open houses and a fall/winter speaker series. Hunting for waterfowl, pheasant and mourning dove is conducted in specific area by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife during the fall and winter months. The \\"Discover the Flyway\\" environmental education program annually brings approximately 4,000 students per year to learn about wetlands and visit the wildlife area. California Duck Days is an annual wildlife festival held each February, which includes educational exhibits and field trips to observe wildlife. Other activities include trout fishing for children, a mobile aquarium and displays of live captive raptors. Tule Ranch This ranch was purchased in 2001 as part of a large expansion of the wildlife area. It had been owned by the Glide family for over 130 years. Since the acquisition, approximately of new wetlands have been restored on this property. The western portion of the Tule Ranch contains vernal pools within a mostly natural grassland. Spectacular wildflower displays occur in the spring. Some notable breeding grassland species include grasshopper sparrow, Savannah sparrow and western meadowlark. A prominent landmark in the area is the Umbrella Barn, a large wooden barn that is over 100 years old. The cathedral like interior of the 100-year-old Umbrella Barn. Snow geese descend upon irrigated pasture on the Tule Ranch The Tule Ranch is host to a large grazing program. Some fields are managed for maximum nutritional value in the form of legumes such as burr clover. These fields also provide important forage for migratory snow geese and white-fronted geese. Cattle are the primary management tool in the vernal pool habitat area. Their removal of thatch from the thick stands of annual rye grass help facilitate the germination of native forbs in this area, resulting in spectacular blooms of wildflowers each spring. At the very bottom of the Tule Ranch is the Fireman's Club, a square mile of property that contains a historic slough that once drained into the Yolo Basin. This section of land was hunted by the Dixon Fire District employees for many years in exchange for their emergency services to the ranch.

It is a frank, thorough, yet light- hearted examination of various unappealing bodily functions and medical conditions. The topics are organized into three categories: ‚ÄúSlimy Mushy Oozy Gross Things,‚Äù (vomit, diarrhea, urine, acne, blisters, etc.); ‚ÄúCrusty Scaly Gross Things,‚Äù (dandruff, tooth decay, etc.); and ‚ÄúStinky Smelly Gross Things,‚Äù (halitosis, flatulence, etc.). The text is also accompanied by many humorous illustrations, which were provided by Jack Keely. Grossology spawned several sequels, most notably Animal Grossology () and Grossology Begins at Home (), both written and illustrated by Branzei and Keely. Animal Grossology, published in 1996, is an exploration of various organisms that either produce or consume unappealing substances. It is divided into four sections: ‚ÄúVomit Munchers‚Äù (flies, starfish, etc.); ‚ÄúBlood Slurpers‚Äù (leeches, ticks, etc.); ‚ÄúSlime Makers‚Äù (hagfish, slime mold, sea cucumbers, etc.); and ‚ÄúDookie Lovers‚Äù (tapeworms, dung beetles, etc.). Grossology Begins at Home, published in 1997, focuses on the hidden germs and unseen pests that thrive in a typical house. One of the highlights of this book is a chapter on Defect Action Levels, the acceptable amounts of animal contaminants and insect parts that can be found in foods. The book also teaches children how to grow their own bacteria. Grossology has also inspired two CD-ROMs (Grossology: The Science of Really Gross Things and Virtual Grossology), a highly popular traveling exhibition, and a children's television series.

Biography Brewer grew up in the Mississippi River town of Grand Tower, Illinois. She attended McKendree University in Lebanon, Illinois and concentrated on music education. She was a music teacher for several years before embarking on a professional music performing career. She began her career in St. Louis, Missouri with the Saint Louis Symphony Chorus. She auditioned in 1981 for the chorus of Opera Theatre of Saint Louis (OTSL), in the start of her career in opera. Her first OTSL work was in the chorus of \\"The Beggars Opera\\" in 1982. Her first major role with OTSL was as Ellen Orford in Peter Grimes in 1990. In 1989, she participated in a masterclass with Birgit Nilsson, and was one of the 10 winners of the National Council auditions sponsored by the Metropolitan Opera. While her daughter Elisabeth was in school during the academic year, Brewer deliberately limited her work in staged opera productions. She returned more actively to the opera stage after her daughter's high school graduation. She began to accept roles including a debut in the title role of Richard Strauss' Ariadne auf Naxos at the Metropolitan Opera in 2003, which has become a signature role for Brewer. Brewer is most famous for her interpretations of roles by Wagner, Strauss and Britten including Isolde, Ariadne, F√§rberin (Die Frau ohne Schatten), Ellen Orford (Peter Grimes) and Queen Elizabeth I (Gloriana). She made her debut at the San Francisco Opera in 2006 singing the title role in Beethoven's Fidelio and returned the following season singing the role of Isolde in Tristan und Isolde. Brewer is a regular featured singer at The Proms and the Wigmore Hall. In late March 2009, Brewer had to withdraw from the complete Ring Cycle at the Metropolitan Opera because of a knee injury. In August 2012, Ms Brewer sang the same program that her mentor Birgit Nilsson sang at the opening of the Concert Hall at the Sydney Opera House in Sydney, Australia 40 years before. It was an all-Wagner program, three performances with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra playing and conducted by Simone Young. In January 2013, Brewer created the role of Sister Aloysius in the world premiere of Douglas Cuomo's opera Doubt at the Minnesota Opera. BBC Music Magazine in April 2007 named her one of the top 20 sopranos of the 20th century. She continues to work with young students in the sixth grade classroom at Marissa, Illinois where she had formerly taught music, in an outreach program in conjunction with the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra. She currently lives in Lebanon, Illinois, with her husband Ross Brewer, a retired social studies teacher. Recordings Brewer has made a number of recordings, which include: * Two contributions to Hyperion‚Äôs Schubert series with pianist Graham Johnson * One CD in Hyperion's Richard Strauss series with pianist Roger Vignoles * Echoes of Nightingales encores by British and American composersSidney Homer, Edwin McArthur, Arthur Walter Kramer, Mildred Lund Tyson, Landon Ronald, James Hotchkiss Rogers, John Alden Carpenter, Paul Sargent, Vincent Youmans, Paul Nordoff, Frank La Forge, Frank Bridge, Idabelle Firestone, Sigmund Romberg, Harold Vicars, John La Montaine, Harold Arlen, Leonard Bernstein, Ernest Charles, Celius Dougherty Hyperion Records * Two recital recordings produced and released by OTSL: (a) \\"Saint Louis Woman‚Äù, (b) ‚ÄúMusic for a While‚Äù with pianist Kirt Pavitt * Mahler's Eighth Symphony with Sir Simon Rattle and the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (EMI) * Mozart's Don Giovanni with Sir Charles Mackerras and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra (Telarc) * Richard Strauss‚Äô Four Last Songs, Wagner's \\"Liebestod\\" from Tristan und Isolde * Mozart‚Äôs Requiem with Donald Runnicles and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra (Telarc) * Fidelio (in German) with Sir Colin Davis and the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO Live) * Barber‚Äôs Vanessa (Chandos) with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Leonard Slatkin * William Bolcom's Songs of Innocence and Experience (Naxos), conducted by Leonard Slatkin * Fidelio (in English) and ‚ÄúGreat Operatic Arias‚Äù (Chandos) with the London Philharmonic and David Parry * Tristan und Isolde with Donald Runnicles and the BBC Symphony Orchestra (Warner Classics) * Britten‚Äôs War Requiem with the London Philharmonic Orchestra and Kurt Masur (LPO Live) Brewer was honored at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards for Best Choral Performance and Best Classical Album for her work on Bolcom's Songs of Innocence and Experience.

She was caught after a fourth intended victim survived and identified her. Gray says she committed the murders to support her spending habits. She is serving her sentence in the California Women's Prison in Chowchilla. Early life Dana Sue Gray was born Dana Sue Armbrust on December 6, 1957, in southern California to Beverly (n√©e Arnett; 1918-1973) and Russell Armbrust. Russell worked as a hair dresser and had three previous marriages before marrying Beverly Arnett, a former beauty queen who had been a MGM starlet. They had several miscarriages before Dana was born. Beverly was described as an aggressive, vain woman. They divorced when her husband found her grappling with an older woman who had angered her. Dana Sue was two years old at the time and afterwards rarely saw her father; she began acting out to get attention. Whenever Beverly would discipline her, Dana would retaliate by stealing money to buy candy and would occasionally fly into fits of violence. In school, she did not get along well with other students and did poorly in all her classes. She was suspended from school many times for forging notes to get out of class. When Dana was 14, her mother developed breast cancer; Gray decided to become a nurse after watching hospital nurses treat her mother. After her mother's death in 1973, Gray moved in with her father but was forced to leave after her stepmother found drugs in her room. A few years later, she became involved with a skydiving instructor, who got her pregnant twice; he convinced her to terminate both pregnancies, something she resented. She later suffered several miscarriages, which led her into depression and psychotropic medications. She was fired from her nursing job after she was caught stealing drugs. Personal life Dana graduated from Newport Harbor High School in 1976. She lived with her sky-diving instructor, Rob, for the next several years and he helped her with nursing school. She became an expert skydiver. In 1981 she graduated from nursing school, and for the next few years had an on-again, off-again relationship with Chris Dodson, a windsurfer. Dana excelled in windsurfing and golf, and they took trips to Hawaii to participate in these activities. In October 1987, Dana married a man named Tom Gray at an upscale winery in the Temecula area. He was a fellow sports enthusiast who had known and admired her since high school. Not long after their marriage, Dana incurred a large amount of debt. At this time, she did not have much contact with her family due to a dispute over an aunt's will. She was a labor and delivery nurse at Inland Valley Regional Medical Center. They lived in the gated community of Canyon Lake where they had several business ventures under the name Graymatter. Gray left her husband in early 1993 and moved in with their friend and her lover, Jim Wilkins, and his young son Jason. In June, 1993, she filed for divorce from Gray, though this was not finalized until after Dana had been in jail for quite some time. In September 1993, she and Gray filed for bankruptcy to stave off foreclosure on their Canyon Lake house. Although the value of the house had greatly increased since they purchased it, they owed much more on the house than it was worth. On November 24, 1993, she was fired from the hospital where she worked for misappropriating Demerol and other opiate painkillers. On February 14, 1994, Dana sent word through Gray's parents (Gray kept his phone number and address hidden from her) that she wanted to meet with her estranged husband. Gray initially agreed but did not show up. Later that day, Dana murdered Norma Davis, an elderly lady whose home Dana had shared for a time. Gray later found out that Dana had taken out an insurance policy on him. The policy would have paid off the Canyon Lake house in the event of Gray's death. Murder victims Norma Davis Norma Davis, 86, is thought to be Gray's first victim. Because of the lack of evidence Gray was never convicted of killing her. Norma was the mother-in-law of the woman (Jeri Davis) who married Dana's father, Russell Armbrust, in 1988. Jeri's first husband, Bill Davis, was Norma's son. Davis died in the early 1980s, and his widow eventually married Armbrust. Jeri continued to care for her elderly mother-in-law, even after she remarried. Dana knew Norma very well. On February 16, 1994, Norma Davis had been dead for two days when she was found by her neighbor, Alice Williams. Davis had a wood handled utility knife sticking out of her neck, and a fillet knife sticking out of her chest. Other than a broken fingernail, she had no other marks. A bloodied afghan lay at her feet. Detectives learned that there was no forced entry into the house. Detectives were informed that she always kept her door locked unless she was expecting a visitor. Williams stated she could not remember Davis mentioning she was expecting company. Detectives found a Nike shoe print pointed toward the kitchen. They also found Davis' $148 Social Security check. On the first floor of Davis' condo, a smear of blood was found on an armchair. A ripped out phone cord was also found. June Roberts June Roberts, 66, was killed on February 28, 1994. Roberts, like Norma Davis, lived in the gated community of Canyon Lake. Gray had visited Roberts one day claiming she wanted to borrow a book about controlling a drinking problem. Roberts let Gray into her house. While Roberts searched for the book, Gray unplugged Roberts' phone, both the straight cord and the curly cord. She then used the curly cord to strangle Roberts. When Roberts was dead, Gray rifled through her credit cards, stealing two. An hour later, Gray went on a massive shopping spree at an upscale shopping center in Temecula.Braidhill, pages 31‚Äì34. Dora Beebe On March 16, 1994, Gray killed Dora Beebe, 87. A few minutes after Beebe came home from a doctor's appointment, Gray pulled up in front of Beebe's house. Gray knocked on Beebe's door and asked Beebe for directions. Beebe invited Gray inside to look at a map.Braidhill, pages 87‚Äì88. Once inside Gray attacked and killed Beebe. Beebe was found later that day by her boyfriend of eight years, Louis Dormand.Braidhill, page 91. An hour later, Gray used Beebe's credit card to go on a shopping spree. Other victims Dorinda Hawkins Gray attacked Hawkins, on March 10, 1994, at her job at an antique store. Hawkins had been working alone that day. Gray came in to buy a picture frame for a photo of her deceased mother. Gray strangled Hawkins with a telephone cord. Gray took $5 from Hawkins' purse and $20 from the cash register. An hour later, Gray went on another shopping spree, using Roberts' credit card. Hawkins had survived the assault, however, and was able to give detectives a description of Gray. The next day the story was in the newspaper.Braidhill, pages 66‚Äì67. Effects of killings Many of the residents of Canyon Lake were terrified. Some moved in with loved ones until the murders were solved. A group of elderly widows began sleeping in big groups at designated houses. They believed there was safety in numbers. A few residents theorised the murders were committed by a cult who engaged in ritual sacrifice.Braidhill, pages 73‚Äì74. Potential suspects Detectives had problems finding suspects early on. At one point, it was so hard to find a lead that the supervisor in charge recommended using a psychic. Before Dana Gray became the lead suspect, detectives had few other suspects. Jeri Armbrust In the case of Norma Davis, detectives initially suspected Jeri Armbrust might be the killer. From talking to Armbrust, detectives learned she used to be married to Davis' son. After Norma Davis' son died, Jeri continued to care for her former mother-in-law. When Jeri remarried, it was to Russell Armbrust, Dana Gray's father. Hence, Dan's connection to Norma Davis. Davis was in very poor health and was still recovering from triple bypass surgery. Detectives also speculated that Jeri Armbrust had been in Davis' house the Sunday prior to the murder.Braidhill, pp. 11‚Äì13. Jeri Armbrust claimed she only stopped by Davis' house to drop off groceries and heard Davis' TV on upstairs, but did not go up to say hello; she just left, and went home. Detectives found it unusual for Jeri Armbrust to take care of someone who was not a blood relative, and she was wearing Nikes, and they also wondered why she would not have said hello to Davis.Braidhill, pp. 11‚Äì13. After weeks of talking with Armbrust and building a rapport, Detective Joseph Greco, a lead investigator, realized she was not the person they were looking for. Greco and Jeri Armbrust became friends and began helping each other during the investigation. It was this relationship and trust which would be pivotal in solving this case.Braidhill, pp. 26‚Äì29. Lead detectives Joseph Greco Detective Joseph Greco, of the Perris Police Department, led the investigations into the murders of Norma Davis and June Roberts. He graduated from the Riverside County Sheriff's Academy as a pre- service student and ranked among the top ten (#7) of his graduating class. He was hired out of the academy by the Perris Police Department in 1988. Greco was highly decorated for his tenacity in the field and received numerous awards to include the Medal of Valor for running into a plane to save victims of an accident at Perris Valley Airport on April 22, 1992. Greco was promoted to the rank of Corporal in 1992 and assigned as an investigator working all major crimes against persons. The first victim, 87-year-old Norma Davis case, in 1994, was only Greco's second homicide investigation. Because of the seriousness of the crimes and his lack of experience, Greco initially questioned his ability to do an adequate investigation, but would eventually solve the case. Additionally, his youthful appearance made people question his ability to do the job. Greco suspected that the Roberts and Davis case were connected due to evidence collected in the case and ultimately discovered it was the work of one female serial killer. He identified Dana Sue Gray as a potential suspect and wrote a search warrant for her residence in Lake Elsinore, California; Ironically, on the day she was out killing her last victim, Dora Beebe, Greco arrested Dana Sue Gray at her front porch and took her into custody for the murder of June Roberts. The search of Gray's home revealed vital information belonging not only to Roberts, but also to Beebe and a surprise third victim, Dorinda Hawkins, the only woman who was not attacked at home, which may explain why she survived her attack, and who later positively identified Gray through a photo line-up. Faced with a mountain of strong circumstantial evidence in the case against her, along with the threat of the death penalty, Gray would eventually plead to life without the possibility of parole and waived all of her appellate rights. She made one condition, however, and that was that the State would not prosecute her for the murder of Norma Davis. Greco worked for the Riverside County's Sheriff's Department's Lake Elsinore Station specializing in elder abuse, sexual assault and child abuse cases from 1998 to 2010. He was later promoted to the rank of Sergeant in March 2010 and is presently assigned to the Southwest Detention Center in Murrieta, California. Greco graduated from the University of Redlands School of Business with an MBA in 2004. In 2007, he became a licensed California real estate broker. Television documentaries involving Detective Greco include: The \\"Discovery Channel\\" for the following shows: \\"The New Detectives\\", Season 7, Episode 1, (New Dominion Pictures 2000), \\"Deadly Women\\" (Beyond Productions 2009)\\", Unusual Suspects\\" (LMNO Productions 2009) and \\"Forensic Factor 2\\" (Exploration Productions 2009) Chris Antoniadas Detective Chris Antoniadas was the lead detective on the Dora Beebe case. Antoniadas interviewed Gray after Detective Greco finished interviewing her. Antoniadas had a knack for getting criminals to confess to their crimes during interrogation. He knew how to relate to people in order to gain their trust and have the person open up to him. Antoniadas also knew how to play someone's religion or insecurities against them. While interrogating Gray, Antoniadas had no clue how to approach her. Gray seemed cold and was unresponsive to any of Antoniadas's approaches. Antoniadas finally decided he needed to take some of Dana's control away from her. He then interrogated her roughly, yelling at her to confess but was unsuccessful. Seeing that did not work, Antoniadas charged her with the murder of Dora Bebee based upon the discovery of Beebe's credit cards found in Gray's sock drawer during Detective Greco's search warrant.Braidhill, pp. 171‚Äì173. Case Gray was finally caught because her description was obtained from various merchants in the Temecula, California area, where she used June Roberts' credit cards to go on a shopping spree. Dana had been spending so much money that the credit card company called June Roberts' family to alert them of the massive spending. The detectives then went to all the stores where Gray used the credit cards and interviewed the cashiers, getting a physical description of Gray. They also learned the killer had dyed her hair recently and had a little boy named Jason. Detective Greco kept in touch with Jeri Armbrust. He began providing the description of the killer to her on a visit to her home. Jeri would reveal to Greco the next day that she believed the suspect to be her stepdaughter. Dana had just dyed her hair and had a boyfriend with a son named Jason. Detective Greco wrote a search warrant for Gray's home and enlisted the help of ARCNET (Allied Riverside County Narcotics Enforcement Team) to stake out Gray's home in Lake Elsinore. Unbeknownst to the team, Gray was murdering Dora Beebe just hours before they began following her, trying to collect evidence. After seeing Dana go to the bank with Beebe's card and then go shopping, the detectives had enough information for nexus involving Dora Beebe's murder. Later that day, Greco arrested Dana while she was cooking dinner for her family. Detective Greco took Dana into custody while assisting officers took her boyfriend and his son down to the station for questioning. During questioning, Dana claimed she never took the credit cards. After detectives said they had evidence of her using them, Dana claimed she found both Roberts' and Beebe's cards. She stuck with this story for hours. She claimed the reason she kept the cards was she had an overwhelming need to shop. She also seemed to have no sympathy for the victims. Detective Antoniadas attempted to obtain a confession after Detective Greco's interview but was unsuccessful. Detective Greco eventually booked Gray on charges of murder. At a hearing on July 23, Deputy DA Richard Bentley requested the death penalty. Gray pleaded insanity on all counts. After a witness claimed to have seen Gray at Roberts' house the day of her death, Gray changed her plea to guilty of robbing and murdering two women and attempting to murder another. By pleading guilty Gray avoided the death penalty. On October 16, 1998, Dana Sue Gray was sentenced to life without parole and was incarcerated in the California Women's Prison in Chowchilla. In media The case was featured in a LMN (Lifetime Movie Network) 2015 episode of Diabolical Women. Gray's murder spree was also featured in a 2017 episode of It Takes A Killer on the television channel Escape.

They are useful in some transfinite induction proofs. The literature contains a few equivalent definitions of the parity of an ordinal Œ±: *Every limit ordinal (including 0) is even. The successor of an even ordinal is odd, and vice versa. *Let Œ± = Œª + n, where Œª is a limit ordinal and n is a natural number. The parity of Œ± is the parity of n. *Let n be the finite term of the Cantor normal form of Œ±. The parity of Œ± is the parity of n. *Let Œ± = œâŒ≤ + n, where n is a natural number. The parity of Œ± is the parity of n. *If Œ± = 2Œ≤, then Œ± is even. Otherwise Œ± = 2Œ≤ + 1 and Œ± is odd. Unlike the case of even integers, one cannot go on to characterize even ordinals as ordinal numbers of the form Ordinal multiplication is not commutative, so in general In fact, the even ordinal cannot be expressed as Œ≤ + Œ≤, and the ordinal number :(œâ + 3)2 = (œâ + 3) + (œâ + 3) = œâ + (3 + œâ) + 3 = œâ + œâ + 3 = œâ2 + 3 is not even. A simple application of ordinal parity is the idempotence law for cardinal addition (given the well-ordering theorem).

Debuting on the YTV network in Canada on September 29, 2006, the series was also broadcast on Discovery Kids/The Hub (now Discovery Family) in the United States on January 13, 2007. It also aired on Jetix on June 2, 2007 and Pop Max from September 15, 2008 in the United Kingdom, and on ABC in Australia in December 2007. The original run ended on October 24, 2009. Premise Ty and Abby are a teenage brother-and-sister crime-fighting team who report to the Bureau of Grossology, a secret government agency whose job is to investigate gross criminals, their gross crimes, and/or various gross phenomena.Ytv.com Each episode of the series follows the pair on adventures based on real scientific facts. Aided by their friend Lab Rat (a tech specialist and a lab researcher), their boss The Director, and their police liaison, The Detective, Ty and Abby work to keep the city safe, all while keeping their identities hidden. Characters Main * Tyler \\"Ty\\" Archer (voiced by Michael Cohen) ‚Äì Ty is Abby's younger brother and a hard kid to face. He is very intelligent, possessing a cool, active and analytical that takes everything in. He sees himself as a scientist and takes his job as a grossologist very seriously. His goal is to be remembered among the very best within the scientific community. He even owns a chemistry set and does analyses on things he finds (e.g. Hairball's hairballs). He and Lab Rat share many common interests. On the field, Ty pilots the GRS-1 and is great at strategic maneuvers. His quick thinking has saved the day many times. In fact, he is hinted to be the most intelligent of the team, being smarter than Abby and even than Lab Rat. He has a crush on Naomi, who eventually becomes his girlfriend later in the series. * Abigail \\"Abby\\" Archer (voiced by Krystal Meadows) ‚Äì Abby unravels mysteries so disgusting that no adult will touch them. She is very intelligent and loves everything gross and slimy. She likes to test her limits to see if there is something that can make even her, the Queen of Squeam, turn green. So far nothing has come close, although she closely resisted gagging on a few occasions. The only exception was when she unknowingly drank contaminated water and threw up. Despite all of this, she is terribly afraid of leeches. She gets covered in slop the most, and being dirty has yet to affect her trademark ponytail. On the field, she is a competent fighter. She holds a severe grudge against not only villains like Lance Boil, but her school rival Paige. Unlike her younger brother Ty, she is athletic and participates in school sports like volleyball. Abby depends on her instincts and feelings at times, which occasionally clouds her judgment. She shares ownership of her beloved pet kitten, Hairball, with Ty. * Paul \\"Lab Rat\\" Squirfenherder (voiced by M. Christian Heywood) ‚Äì Lab Rat, a former delinquent now is the who is now the older colleague of Ty and Abby, working as Bureau of Grossology's tech support assistent. He is a lab worker who make different sorts of gadgets and search for various scientific informations into the computer in order to aid Ty and Abby on their missions. Lab Rat suffers from agoraphobia, which prevents him from leaving the Gag Lab unless absolutely necessary, but instead spent his time doing lab work. This is what earned him the nickname \\"Lab Rat,\\" which he prefers to his real name. He has a pet rat named Hermes, who he treats as his best friend. He lacks in social skills. He also has a poor personal hygiene, Abby often jokes that he stinks due to the fact that bathing is not one of his favorite activities. * The Director (voiced by Paul O'Sullivan) ‚Äì The Director is the head of the Bureau of Grossology and gives the Grossologists their repulsive assignments, often in a state of panic. He is incredibly squeamish and terrified by the slightest hint of anything gross. In spite of this, he is known to arrogantly enter the scene after the crime is solved and take all the credit, claiming that Abby and Ty's success is because of his \\"great leadership skills\\". Abby and Ty see right through his farce and make sure his ego is kept in check, which isn't hard to do since the crime scenes often unnerve the Director anyway. He has on one known occasion gone into the field by himself to search for his missing agents.Episode 13, \\"Kid Rot\\" Villains * Insectiva (voiced by Lili Francks) ‚Äì She was once a promising young university student who wanted to study entomology (the study of insects) until she discovered how insects are treated by science: captured and dissected. Now, armed with all sorts of bugs, she pursues an insect agenda, to wipe all people off the planet so bugs can rule again. She, like many insects, can't get past windows, therefore she is continuously running into them. She began a romantic relationship with Sloppy Joe in the Valentine's Day episode \\"Pucker Up\\". She also has a twin sister, Arachnidia, who is also her rival. ** Real Name: Cara Chitin ** First Appearance: Episode 1 (\\"Queen for a Day\\") ** Cara Chitin's last name is based on chitin, what insects' exoskeletons are made of. * The Slim Slime Man (voiced by Neil Crone) ‚Äì A bitter old sewer worker, who abnormally fused with a living slime mould while working in the sewers one day, becoming a strange giant slime creature with a ghoulish skull-like head seen inside. As he gets more powerful, he aims to cover the surface world with living slime molds. ** Real Name: Slim ** First Appearance: Episode 2 (\\"The Slim Slime Man\\") * Fartor (voiced by Sean Cullen) ‚Äì Fifteen years ago, he was just an ordinary kid, until his older brother Gary tortured him by stuffing him under the bed sheets and farting in there. During those fifteen years, his lungs adapted to the gases in farts. Like a fish out of water, clean air is poison to him, so he breathes toxic gases in a dome that he wears on his body. There was only one thing Fartor wanted... revenge on his brother. ** Real Name: Larry ** First Appearance: Episode 3 (\\"Fartzilla\\") * Sloppy Joe (voiced by George Buza) ‚Äì After discovering that a whiff of his stink was enough to render people unconscious, Joe vowed to never let a drop of water, soap, or deodorant touch his skin again, and turned to an easy life of crime. His plan: go from filthy, to filthy rich. When clean he is shown to be an albino. Insectiva is his girlfriend as of the Valentine's Day episode \\"Pucker Up\\". ** First Appearance: Episode 4 (\\"The Perfect Stink\\") ** Real Name: Joseph Puglowski * The Scab Fairy (voiced by Jessica Holmes) ‚Äì A crazed former beauty queen who was traumatized over a small cut to her shoulder, ending her career. Not seen since then, she used her exceptional degree in dermatology and mythology to create a high-tech dragonfly-winged suit made of scabs, and takes the identity of the Scab Fairy, based on a Tooth Fairy-like myth figure that collects scabs (rather than teeth). She is armed with a high-tech wand that removes scabs from people's wounds, and inflicts them on others. Her ultimate obsession is to inflict scabs on anyone pretty, as revenge for the loss of her old beauty queen career. ** Real Name: Helena Globin ** First Appearance: Episode 5 (\\"The Scab Fairy\\") ** Helena Globin's name is a pun on the word hemoglobin, a protein found in red blood cells. * Lance Boil (voiced by Juan Chioran) ‚Äì He was once a successful Grossologist; however, he envied The Director's authority. Boyle tried to pull a coup, using a \\"prototype shrink-ray.\\" Ty had tinkered with the weapon though, and Lance ended up blasting himself and shrinking in a somewhat lopsided manner (small body; large, misshapen, pus- filled head). Although horrified at first, Lance comes to be very proud of his boil. Banished from the team, he decided to use his skills for evil, with one goal in his twisted head revenge against all Grossologists, especially Abby and Ty. He is also the person responsible in mentoring Abby and Ty, helped honed their fighting and investigation skills and tutored them personally in Grossology, human and animal anatomy, biology and chemistry to become the grossologists they are today. ** Real Name: Lance Boyle ** First Appearance: Episode 6 (\\"When Ya Gotta Go\\") ** His name references the medical term \\"lancing a boil\\". * Hagfish ‚Äì ** First Appearance: Episode 8 (\\"Go Fish\\") * Keith Van Kobbler (voiced by Pat Mastroianni) ‚Äì A popular and undefeated young basketball player, and Abby's former idol. Calls himself \\"VK\\" for short, and always refers to himself in the third person. Endorsed the \\"KVK-1\\" brand super-sneakers, which have been a runaway success, but after a short while, all wearers (including VK's opposing players, up-and-coming basketball players) suffer a severe case of foot fungus! After painstakingly examining the KVK-1 sneakers in the case, Ty and Lab Rat suspect VK himself to be the culprit, while Abby has difficulty accepting their suspicion. As it turns out, VK is indeed the culprit, with a twisted method behind his fame; he single- handedly manufactured the KVK-1 sneakers for mass consumption, and spiked them with fungus (while wearing a non-spiked \\"Deluxe Edition\\" pair for himself, of course), so that everyone will have foot fungus, and most of all, eliminate the competition, so that he will be the only basketball player in the world. His weapon is a high-tech \\"Wrecking Ball\\" basketball. ** First Appearance: Episode 9 (\\"It's Gotta Be the Shoes\\") * Mr. Fowler (voiced by Derek McGrath) ‚Äì He is the custodian at Ringworm Junior High School. He is small, timid, shy, afraid of Paige, and wears oversized glasses. Always hums the song \\"4 and 20 Black Birds Baked In a Pie.\\" He grew tired of cleaning up the excess pigeon poop around the school, so he built a giant mechanical owl suit, with which he captures pigeons and plots to put them in a pie to bake them. ** First Appearance: Episode 10 (\\"Owl Most Foul\\") * Kid Rot (voiced by Travis Ferris) ‚Äì After a science experiment mishap while trying to find a cure for foods going bad or rotting, young boy Chester gains the \\"rotting touch,\\" with which he causes all organic materials to rot with a single touch, and also gives off a horrible smell. He becomes a new student at Ringworm Junior High School, and causes chaos upon his arrival, with a concerned Abby and Ty trying to cure him (Abby initially had feelings for him, much to Ty's suspicion). But Chester's rotting powers literally go to his head, giving him a twisted personality (even christening himself \\"Kid Rot\\"), and making him a formidable and diabolical foe for the Grossology team. Worse, he has a psychotic infatuation for Abby (who ultimately hates him, at least his prevalent Kid Rot persona), and will stop at nothing to win her heart, even going as far as to rot the entire world! His rotting powers used to be an excellent fertilizer (in a way making his science experiment a success), but the second time they met, his rotting powers had evolved to where they just kill whatever they touch. The last time we saw Kid Rot, he was engulfed in rot he had created. Abby and Ty gave up looking for him but as the episode is about to end we see a hand (presumable Kid Rot's) sticking out from the rot and as a leaf lands on it, it's grabbed by the hand. The episode ends as we hear some heavy breathing. We have yet to know what has become of Chester/Kid Rot. ** Real Name: Chester ** First Appearance: Episode 13 (\\"Kid Rot\\") * Patrick (voiced by Julie Lemieux) ‚Äì ** First Appearance: Episode 17 (\\"Survival of the Grossest\\") * Dr. Cornelius Colon (voiced by Peter Keleghan) ‚Äì A mad proctologist, who plots to engulf the world in a gigantic colon, starting with Ringworm Junior High School (on the last day before its Summer vacation), to take revenge on people for unsympathetically making fun of him for his unfortunate surname. Has giant tapeworms as henchmen. ** First Appearance: Episode 18 (\\"School's Grossed Out for Summer\\") * Far-Ty ‚Äì Ty as a temporary villain. Feeling he's not needed after Abby showed him up several times, Ty, trying to overcompensate for himself behind her back, was captured by Fartor, who was in the midst of planning yet another full-scale fart attack on the world. He exposes Ty to the same deadly gases that transformed him, using a special process to speed up the transformation. Now, Ty, as Far-Ty, becomes Fartor's greatest asset in carrying out his dastardly plan. And just as Fartor plotted revenge on his older brother Gary, Far-Ty carried out a twisted revenge on his older sister Abby. ** Real Name: Ty Archer ** First Appearance: Episode 20 (\\"Silent But Deadly, Part 1\\") * Frankenbooger ‚Äì A giant monster made of nose mucus stolen by Sloppy Joe (using a suction gun), who simply wanted to make a \\"boogerman\\" with said mucus (much like a snowman). Abby and Ty confront Sloppy Joe, and in the process, inadvertently cause an electrical accident that brings the \\"boogerman\\" to life. The monster sucks mucus out of people's noses, and the more he consumes, the larger he gets. Its only weakness is dirt particles (just like any mucus), which cause him to not only dry up, but decrease in size. ** First Appearance: Episode 24 (\\"Frankenbooger\\") * Darko Crevasse (voiced by Julian Richings) ‚Äì A gothic caped villain whose eyesight is accustomed to darkness, and therefore must wear dark glasses. He summons a huge flock of bats to drop guano on anyone who opposes him. As he cannot stand light, his ultimate plan is to plunge the city into eternal darkness. In the Halloween episode \\"Night of the Living Roadkill\\", Paige commented that he was Goth. ** First Appearance: Episode 23 (\\"Lights Out\\") * Sarah Senia (voiced by Jayne Eastwood) ‚Äì A lady whose DNA structure was crossed with that of plants. Has leaves and tendrils around her body. Plotted to use giant carnivorous plants to attack the city, and ultimately, the world. ** First Appearance: Episode 25 (\\"A New Leaf\\") * Arachnidia (voiced by Maria Vacratsis) ‚Äì Insectiva's twin sister. Unlike Insectiva, she loves arachnids, as her name suggests. She and Insectiva have had a bitter rivalry, and both pit their own respective arthropods against each other, with catastrophic results. She is the gothic version of Insectiva and her hairstyle is a big double-knob ponytail. ** First Appearance: Episode 27 (\\"Sinister Rivalry\\") * Frederick Follicle (voiced by Stephen Ouimette) ‚Äì A hair dresser who doesn't like to change styles. After getting kicked out of a job, he went underground doing biological experiments, and ended up with living hair. ** First Appearance: Episode 31 (\\"Hairless Whispers\\") * Roger Pink-Eye (voiced by Lyon Smith) ‚Äì A kid with a pink eye. He is curious about Ty and Abby's extra-curricular activities, and thus sets off to find the truth about his classmates' secret identities, using various attempts to do so, but all of them end in failure. In the second season trilogy (Pinkeye and The Brain, Pinkeye's Revenge Part 1, Pinkeye's Revenge Part 2), he teams up with Lance Boil (after successfully capturing him) to find out Ty and Abby's secret. He eventually becomes a Grossologist, but he is fired/quits after his plan backfires with Lance betraying him. ** First Appearance: Episode 33 (\\"Mold Monster\\") * Basso Profondo (voiced by Ben Campbell) ‚Äì A disgraced opera star, who was once part of the Three Baritones. He's back for revenge, but this time he's singing a whole new tune; in other words, he's now a burping star. ** First Appearance: Episode 39 (\\"Ain't Over Till the Fat Man Sings\\") * Gary Gumdrop (voiced by Adrian Truss) ‚Äì People call him the ultimate candy man, but he's just a crazy man with a big sweet tooth and a lot of rotten teeth. His plan is to make super tooth-rotting candy, pretending that they'll take care of your teeth, and distribute them to everyone, so he won't be the only one with a rotten mouth and a large craving for candy. ** First Appearance: Episode 40 (\\"Candy Isn't Dandy\\") *Gundy McGoober (voiced by Bruce Pirrie) ‚Äì Tired of campers bringing their new electronic devices with them, Gundy uses mutated worms to scare away people from his lake. ** First Appearance: Episode 42 (\\"Squirm\\") * Evil Clone Abby (voiced by Krystal Meadows) ‚Äì She is the creation of Roger Pink-Eye and Lance Boil, used as part of a scheme to get Abby fired so that they can take over the Bureau of Grossology. She is made from a combination of human DNA and rat DNA. She attacked the city with an army of rats, and later infiltrated the Gag Lab and fired Ty and Lab Rat. ** First Appearance: Episode 46 (\\"Pink-Eye's Revenge (Part I)\\") * Slitherbuddies ‚Äì Genetically modified reptiles that start out cuddly but grow to be monstrous and vicious. ** First Appearance: Episode 48 (\\"Fang's A Lot\\") Supporting * Harvey & Petunia Archer (voiced by Richard Binsley and Karen Hines, respectively) ‚Äì Abby and Ty's father and mother, respectively. Both are shown to be gullible, and as such, are completely unaware of their children's secret jobs as Grossologists. Harvey manages the city's water treatment plant while Petunia teaches entomology. Petunia has a fear of heights as shown in the episode \\"Squirmed\\". * The Detective (voiced by Danny Wells) ‚Äì A gruff, burly police detective, who occasionally works with Abby and Ty on cases, and is the only outsider who knows their secret. He bears more than a strong resemblance to Detective Dick Gumshoe from the Phoenix Wright series of games. * Mr. Scheffer (voiced by Chad DeRohgth) ‚Äì An often nervous and uptight teacher at Ringworm Junior High School. He has been noted to teach science (Silent But Deadly: Part 1) and direct plays (When Ya Gotta Go). * Paige Logan (voiced by Melissa Altro) ‚Äì A popular but very snobbish girl at Ringworm Junior High, and Abby's bitter rival. However, as seen in \\"New Recruits\\", she was once actually nice to her. Her father is very rich, and her favorite color is pink. She has been noted several times throughout the second season to have a crush on a blond boy named Rudy. * Naomi (voiced by Lauren Collins) ‚Äì A shy and gentle girl at Ringworm Junior High, and Ty's love interest. She takes ballet. She also has three incredibly jockish brothers, as seen in the episode \\"When Allergies Attack\\" when Ty went on a family picnic with her. It was also noticed in the previously mentioned episode that she has a long list of allergies. *Emily (voiced by Leah Pinsent) - a gothic nurse who is an expert on leeches. Production * Back when the series was in development in 2004, the planned series was somewhat different. Background designer Brad Graham was originally slated to do the character designs and backgrounds. The character designs looked completely different, and had more of a conventional \\"abstract\\" look like most modern kids' cartoons, but many of Graham's elements remained in the final version. The more diverse Grossology team lineup consisted of Abby and Ty (who were still the main characters, only Abby had pigtails rather than the long trademark ponytail), Nigel Stodding (a British kid fashioned like 1960s secret agent Harry Palmer), Lab Rat (who was an overweight Caucasian boy, but still had Hermes, who looked somewhat identical to the final version), and a weirder assortment of kids including Pink Eye (a beatnik boy; the basis for the villain Roger Pink-Eye), Creepy Crawly (a goth girl with spiders, who may have been the basis for the adult villainess Insectiva.), Sloppy Joe (a dirty spud-shaped kid, who ultimately became an adult villain for the series) and Colin Polyp (A bulb-headed kid who may have evolved into the adult villain Dr. Cornelius Colon in the final series). Abby and Ty still went to Ringworm Junior High School (which looked like a more classic-style school than the more modern one in the series), and the Gag Lab was originally a more complex underground secret base called the Grossotorium. Abby and Ty did not wear Slime Suits at this point. * According to M. Christian Heywood, the voice of Lab Rat, upon discovering the original Lab Rat design, his initial audition for the character was a modified impression of Otacon from Metal Gear Solid.https://twitter.com/DevenOClock/status/1157075131216384001 However, the director insisted for him to try the audition more close to his natural voice albeit with some Chris Tucker influence; in which he complied. Although the directors' initially wanted a genuine child actor to play the character, the actor was fired from the project and not only did Heywood won the role but the characters' final design was re-worked and modeled after Heywood himself.https://twitter.com/DevenOClock/status/700103580263518210http://mactheactor.tumblr.com/post/70743922973/the- world-of-pre-lay-voiceover-where-drastic Episodes * Airdates are from original Canadian broadcasts on YTV.

History Origins The newspaper's origins date back to the 19th century. Its forerunner was launched on 27 June 1891 by William Ernest Fairbridge for the Argus group of South Africa. Named the Mashonaland Herald and Zambesian Times, it was a weekly, hand-written news sheet produced using the cyclostyle duplicating process. In October the following year it became a printed newspaper and changed its name to The Rhodesia Herald. The Argus group later set up a subsidiary called the Rhodesian Printing and Publishing Company to run its newspapers in what was then Southern Rhodesia. After the white minority Rhodesian Front government unilaterally declared independence on 11 November 1965, it started censoring The Rhodesia Herald. The newspaper responded by leaving blank spaces where articles had been removed, enabling readers to gauge the extent of the censorship. Copy of The Rhodesia Herald, 1976 Post Independence In 1981, after Zimbabwe became independent, the government bought The Herald and other papers from the Argus group, using a US$20 million grant from Nigeria, and established the Zimbabwe Mass Media TrustEllias T. Rusike. See http://journ.ru.ac.za/rjr/Rusike_homepage.html to operate them. The Trust created Zimbabwe Newspapers, Ltd., as the publisher of the papers. For Robert Mugabe's 93rd birthday, the state-owned newspaper issued a 24-page supplement packed with goodwill messages from government departments. Sister papers Other newspapers published by the same group include The Sunday Mail in Harare, The Chronicle and Sunday News in Bulawayo and the Manica Post in Mutare.Zimbabwe Newspapers website. The Chronicle, launched in October 1894 as The Bulawayo Chronicle, is the second oldest newspaper in the country. Controversy The Herald has for some time been noted for its completely one sided reporting for the government of President Robert Mugabe and the Zanu-PF party, and its demonisation of the opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). It often accuses the MDC of being agents of colonial powers.For example: \\"Tsvangirai confirms US, UK‚Äôs regime change agenda\\" , The Herald, 28 June 2008 The Herald faces limited competition from within Zimbabwe, mainly from independent newspapers, such as The Independent, due to very restrictive accreditation laws.Zimbabwe newspapers and news sites world- newspapers.com Many opposition media claim that the paper has evolved into an instrument of rather crude and aggressive propaganda.Zimbabwe: Herald newspaper trimmed to size over propaganda botch-up ZimDaily (On the other hand, it often offers important insights into the workings of the Zanu-PF elite.) The editorial staff are open in their partisanship.For example: \\"Time for MDC-T to take stock\\" , The Herald, 28 June 2008 The paper makes no pretence of impartiality. The editors also support the restrictions on opposition newspapers. Their rationale for this is explained as follows by Caesar Zvayi, a regular contributor to the Herald: :\\"A free Press is vital for a vibrant society. But you have to understand the context in which the Zimbabwean State is operating. It is under siege from some Western countries, some of which ‚Äì like the US ‚Äì openly admit to sponsoring the media and various opposition groups to discredit the Government. ... How independent will the Press be if they are funded by an outsider who openly declares his intention to unseat the incumbent Government?\\" In mid-May 2008, its website was briefly shut down by cyber hackers. Current editor As of October 2013, the editor of The Herald was Caesar Zvayi.

Work John Carroll is the author of Puritan, Paranoid, Remissive, Guilt, Ego and Soul, Humanism: The Rebirth and Wreck of Western Culture, and Intruders In The Bush: The Australian Quest For Identity. His Cambridge doctoral dissertation on epistemological anarchistic and anti-rationalist themes in Max Stirner, Nietzsche and Dostoyevsky was published as Breakout from the Crystal Palace (1974). It was supervised by George Steiner. Puritan, Paranoid, Remissive (1977) echoed and developed upon themes in Philip Rieff's Triumph of the Therapeutic: Uses of Faith after Freud (1966). Humanism (1993; 2010) is Carroll's most ambitious work to date. Predicated on the view that Western high culture is in a declining if not nihilistic mode, Humanism traces this decline to an epistemic tyranny of reason and its subjection of other forms of knowing and understanding being. Carroll's often bleak diagnosis is primarily based on unique readings of canonic theological, philosophical and artistic texts including those by Sophocles, Calvin, Holbein, Donatello, Shakespeare, Rembrandt, Poussin, Henry James and John Ford. The heart of the book's analysis is highly indebted to Nietzsche's critique of \\"Socratic\\" culture in The Birth of Tragedy. Terror: a Meditation on the Meaning of September 11 (2004) is an application of many of the themes in the former work. In The Western Dreaming and The Existential Jesus, Carroll rereads Gospel narratives and the ontology of Christ through a Heideggerian and non-theistic lens. Greek Pilgrimage is an unabashedly hellenophilic meditation on the nature of ancient Greek aesthetics and culture and what remains of the archaeological sites themselves. His latest book, Land of the Golden Cities, on the sources of Australia's current prosperity, was published by Connor Court in 2017. A book of essays about his work, Metaphysical Sociology: On the Work of John Carroll, edited by Sara James, was published by Routledge in 2018. It includes Carroll's response to the contributions.

Cardell Willis, was an influential Milwaukee comic. He was locally known mostly in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. He went by the name Cardell socially and professionally, but used his formal name legally. Willis was born in 1937, either on April 20, or August 3. The discrepancy is due to the remoteness of his hometown of Forest, Mississippi, and the fact that births had to be reported in the capital of Jackson at the time. He was born to William and Pearlie Mae Willis. He was the youngest of eight. His siblings included William, Joseph, Lilly Mae, and Geneva. He was mentor to Will Durst before his eventual fame in San Francisco, and Dobie Maxwell, as well as Richard Halasz, and Chris Barnes, all of whom are natives to Milwaukee. He eventually developed Alzheimers, which robbed him of his ability to tell the storied jokes he was known for. He died on February 10, 2007 in a group home at age 69 after suffering two strokes. He was buried at Graceland Cemetery in Milwaukee. A tribute show occurred to honor Willis' contributions and generosity to his peers and community. The MC was Dobie Maxwell, who called Willis his \\"comedy father\\". The tribute show was donation- supported, and the remaining proceeds were given to the Boy Scouts of America, in which Willis was a Scoutmaster and had received the Silver Beaver Award.

Sorin practiced law with her father William Herring in the firm \\"Herring & Sorin\\" initially in Tombstone, Arizona, and later in Tucson. After her father's death, Sorin moved to Globe, Arizona, where she became the attorney for the Old Dominion Copper Company and United Globe Mines. Sarah Sorin is a member of the Arizona Women's Hall of Fame. (See photo of Sarah Herring Sorin in the Arizona Library Archives.) She is also included in Stanford Law School's Women's Legal History Biography Project. Early life in New York City Sarah Herring Sorin was born in New York City on January 15, 1861, to Colonel William and Mary Inslee Herring. The Herrings had five children: Sarah, Howard, Bertha, Henrietta, and Mary, from oldest to youngest. Her father, Colonel Herring, had graduated from Columbia Law School and later became Deputy District Attorney in New York City and served in the New York State Legislature. Sarah finished high school in New York and then went on to obtain her teaching credentials. She taught school in New York City while her brother Howard attended high school. By this time Sarah and Howard were the only members of the family left in New York. Through a series of events, the rest of the family had moved far west to the city of Tombstone in the Arizona Territory. From New York to Tombstone In 1878, upon the death of her prospecting uncle Joe Herring, her father ventured to the Arizona Territory to settle the estate and evaluate various mining holdings. In the process, Colonel Herring caught the mining fever and decided to work the claims located in Bisbee through his newly formed Neptune Mining Company that was funded by East Coast money. In 1880 the family moved out west to Bisbee Canyon to join Colonel Herring, except for the two oldest, Sarah and Howard. Colonel Herring eventually ceased his mining aspirations and established himself as an attorney for mining companies. When Sarah and Howard moved west in 1882, the Herring family was now residing in Tombstone. The city was still reeling from the October 1881 Earp-Clanton shoot-out at the O.K. Corral. Colonel Herring was Wyatt Earp's attorney during the murder trial in which Earp was ultimately acquitted. Due to the volatile and polarized atmosphere surrounding the trial, Sarah's father was armed at all times, even in the courtroom, and was often under the protection of hired gunmen. Not long after her move west, Sarah became the first woman schoolteacher in Tombstone. In her ten years at the school, she also had stints as school librarian and principal. Her favorite activities were riding horseback and playing music. She also enjoyed the parlor games played in the respectable side of town. Sarah found Tombstone a rapidly growing and civilized city, in spite of the feuds and fights of the rough side of town. Tombstone had surpassed 10,000 in population and had more attorneys than any other city in the Arizona Territory. It also had some of the best restaurants between New Orleans and San Francisco. Sarah and her sisters felt perfectly safe strolling down the sidewalk, even at night. They avoided the part of town that housed the saloons and the infamous Birdcage Theater, where Doc Holliday, Virgil Earp, Wyatt Earp, and Morgan Earp could be found. Sarah's sister Bertha assisted their father in his law office on Toughnut Street, where most of the law offices were located. Her brother Howard joined his father's law firm as an attorney after being admitted to the bar in 1885. In 1886 the tide turned on Tombstone. The water levels in the mines began to rise, ruining its potential for mining. The mining companies began focusing on mines in other areas and the population in Tombstone started its downward spiral. The Herrings did not move. Sarah enjoyed her teaching and her father's law firm thrived. Colonel Herring served the Territory as Arizona Attorney General (1892-3), delegate to the 1891 Constitutional Convention, and President of the Territorial Bar. On November 2, 1891, Sarah's brother Howard died during a dental procedure at the age of 27. Howard had been the heir apparent to Colonel Herring and his law firm. Sarah decided to become an attorney and take Howard's place in the law firm. Legal training In 1892 Sarah quit her teaching job and started working in her father's law firm. Later that year she applied for a license to practice law in the First Judicial District Court of the Territory of Arizona in Tombstone. Her oral examination in open court was conducted by attorneys C.S. Clark, Allen English, and Judge W.H. Barnes. She passed unanimously. Sarah did not receive the same resistance that women attorneys in other parts of the country faced, such as Lavinia Goodell in Wisconsin, Myra Bradwell in Illinois, Clara Shortridge Foltz in California, and Belva Lockwood in Washington D.C. At the time of the 1890 census, there were only 208 women in the U.S. that were listed as attorneys. After being admitted to the Bar, Sarah returned to New York City to attend New York University's School of Law. NYU was one of the first law schools in the nation to actively recruit women. Sarah graduated with an L.L.B. in 1894. She ranked fourth in her class of eighty-six graduates. Upon graduation from NYU, she returned to her father's law firm in Tombstone. Her first case before the Arizona Supreme Court was in 1896 when she represented a mining company and won the case for her client. Relocation to Tucson In 1896 the Herring family left the declining Tombstone area and moved north to the thriving city of Tucson, Arizona. They were helped in their move by Thomas Sorin, who was to become Sarah's husband. Sarah married Thomas Sorin on July 22, 1898, in her family's home in Tucson. Sarah was 37 and Thomas was 52. Thomas Sorin was a successful miner who, like many others, had left his mining operations in Tombstone to focus on other areas in Arizona. To many he was better known as the co-founder of the Tombstone Epitaph along with John Clum. Thomas Sorin, who was renowned for his mining expertise, represented the Arizona Territory mining industry at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. The Sorins spent the weekends at their ranch in Cochise County. During the week Sarah would travel to Tucson and practice law with her father, while Thomas would travel to various mining operations in the territory. The law firm of Herring & Sorin focused on more than just representing mining companies. Herring worked with future son-in-law attorney Selim M. Franklin in founding the University of Arizona. Herring served a term as the University's Chancellor. Herring Hall was named for him. Colonel Herring was active in Arizona's statehood in 1912 and assisted in writing the state's first constitution. Sarah's work brought her in front of the U.S. Supreme Court on four occasions. Her father was alive to witness the first two appearances, but died in 1912, before witnessing her greatest legal achievement in 1913. U.S. Supreme Court cases On April 16, 1906, Colonel Herring applied for his daughter's admission to the United States Supreme Court. Sarah became the 24th woman ever to be admitted. Belva Lockwood, the first woman ever admitted to the U.S. Supreme Court, attended Sarah's ceremony in Washington, D.C. Sarah first appeared before the U.S. Supreme Court in October 1906 in the case of Taylor vs. Burns,.203 U.S. 120 (1906) Herring made the final arguments. Herring & Sorin won the case for their client, Thomas Burns. The opinion was delivered by Justice Brewer. Her next appearance involved mining tax issues. In an opinion delivered by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, they lost their argument. The case did lead to mining companies pushing for statutory revisions to tax laws, which led to the enactment of the Bullion Law, which Herring & Sorin drafted. Sarah's third appearance before the nation's highest court occurred after her father's death. Sorin was helping her attorney brother-in-law Selim M. Franklin on a title case that was argued before the court. Her fourth case was her landmark case, Work v. United Globe Mines, where she became the first woman to argue a case, unassisted and unaccompanied by a male attorney, on November 6, 1913. This event secured Sarah's place in national legal history. The written brief presented to the court was solely in Sarah's name, and she gave the final arguments by herself. Her accomplishment was noted in many newspapers, including the New York Times. The Women's Lawyers' Journal stated that Sarah's argument was \\"one of the most brilliant ever presented to that court by a woman\\". On January 5, 1914, Chief Justice White rendered the Court's decision in favor of Sarah and her client, United Globe Mines. Last days and recognition After her father's death in 1912, Sarah moved her practice to Globe, Arizona, closer to the Sorin Ranch. Sarah was the corporate counsel for both the Old Dominion Copper Company and the United Globe Mines, which was part of the Phelps Dodge mining empire. Not long after her triumph in the U.S. Supreme Court in January 1914, Sarah had to travel to Tombstone to deal with her father's estate. Shortly after she fell ill and died of pneumonia on April 30, 1914, in Globe, with her husband at her side. A ceremony was held in Tucson at her sister's home. Her obituary was carried on the front page of several newspapers and a special resolution was prepared by the Arizona State Bar Association. Both Sarah and Thomas Sorin are buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Tucson. In 1985 Sarah Herring Sorin was admitted into the Arizona Women's Hall of Fame. In 1999, the Arizona Women Lawyers Association created an annual Sarah Sorin Award. The state that produced the first woman to present a case unassisted to the United States Supreme Court also later produced the first woman Justice of the Supreme Court, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, and the first woman Chief Justice of a state supreme court, Lorna Lockwood.

Life Very little is known about her, as she is only briefly mentioned in the Chronographia of Michael Psellos, followed in the works of John Skylitzes and the Zonaras. Psellos writes of her only that: \\"Constantine while still a young man, had married a lady called Helena. She was a daughter of the renowned Alypius, then the leading man in the city and member of a noble family held in high repute. This lady, who was not only beautiful but also virtuous, bore him three daughters before she died.\\"Michael Psellos, \\"Chronographia\\", Book 2, chapter 4 Apart from this reference in Psellos, her father Alypius (ŒëŒªœÖœÄŒØŒøœÇ) is otherwise unknown. The marriage probably took place ca. 976, and Helena died at some unknown point, apparently long before her husband became sole emperor in 1025. The historian Gunther G. Wolf theorized that she died ca. 989, possibly during the birth of her third daughter. Their three daughters were: * Eudokia (ŒïœÖŒ¥ŒøŒ∫ŒØŒ±). Eldest daughter. According to the Chronographia \\"in childhood she had been attacked by some infectious illness, and her looks had been marred ever since\\".Michael Psellos, \\"Chronographia\\", Book 2, chapter 5 She later became a nun. * Zo√´ Porphyrogenita. * Theodora. At the time of their marriage, Constantine VIII was the co-ruler of his older brother Basil II. Basil reigned as senior Byzantine Emperor from 976 to 1025 but never married, which would make Helena the only Augusta during his reign. Possible descendants Ronald Wells, a modern genealogist, has suggested that Eudokia did not remain a nun for life. He has theorised an identification of Eudokia with the otherwise unnamed wife of Andronikos Doukas, a Paphlagonian nobleman who may have served as governor of the theme of Moesia. This theory would make Helena a maternal grandmother of Constantine X and John Doukas. Wells has further suggested two daughters of the above proposed union. The first suggested daughter is Maria, the wife of Ivan Vladislav. Christian Settipani has however posited a more robustly argued descent of Maria from Tsar Boris II of Bulgaria.Settipani 2006, pp.282-283 The second daughter is \\"Sophia\\", an alleged wife of Manuel Erotikos Komnenos. Manuel was the father of Isaac I Komnenos and John Komnenos, the latter being the father of Alexios I Komnenos. The claim, which provides no references or argumentation, apparently serves as a way to trace the ancestry of the Doukas and Komnenos families to the Macedonian dynasty. There is however no proof for any such relationship of Eudokia in primary sources or contemporary sigillographyProsopography of the Byzantine World, Eudokia (101) - vide: http://db.pbw.kcl.ac.uk/pbw2011/entity/person/107052 and modern historical and prosopographical authorities remain equally silent on the matter,Settipani 2006, p.158 (Doukas), p. 308 (Macedonian Dynasty).Cheynet 1996, p.275 (Ducas). making the asserted descent appear entirely unlikely.

Thompson is also CEO of FreedomProject Education, the educational arm of the American Opinion Foundation which is intended to provide online curriculum for students in grades 9 through 12 featuring an emphasis on \\"patriotism and the idea of American exceptionalism\\" which is \\"based on the foundation of Biblical belief\\" . Earlier career Before becoming head of the JBS, he had a long career as an anti-communist activist: he claims to have infiltrated Marxist organizations around his Seattle home in the 1960s. In his JBS Biography, Thompson is also credited with past membership in an unnamed small City Council, as the chairman of an unnamed local Chamber of Commerce, as a party official and an elector for the Republican Party, and as a Washington state citizen advocate for the Christian Coalition. The biography documents attendance but not graduation date or field of study from the University of Washington and the Washington Military Academy. Views Thompson believes that Russian communism remains a serious threat to the USA, and is responsible for much global terrorism including 9/11. He has claimed a number of Islamists including Ayman al-Zawahiri are or were communists. He has criticised both mainstream Republicans and Tea Party figures such as Sarah Palin for failing to see the nature of the threat from Moscow. He also believes in a shadowy international conspiracy including such bodies as the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission and the Rockefeller family that threatens American interests.

They act by blocking the estrogen receptor (ER) and/or inhibiting or suppressing estrogen production., Antiestrogens are one of three types of sex hormone antagonists, the others being antiandrogens and antiprogestogens. Types and examples Antiestrogens include selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) like tamoxifen, clomifene, and raloxifene, the ER silent antagonist and selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) fulvestrant, aromatase inhibitors (AIs) like anastrozole, and antigonadotropins including androgens/anabolic steroids, progestogens, and GnRH analogues. Although aromatase inhibitors and antigonadotropins can be considered antiestrogens by some definitions, they are often treated as distinct classes. Aromatase inhibitors and antigonadotropins reduce the production of estrogen, while the term \\"antiestrogen\\" is often reserved for agents reducing the response to estrogen. Medical uses Antiestrogens are used for: * Estrogen deprivation therapy in the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer * Ovulation induction in infertility due to anovulation * Male hypogonadism * Gynecomastia (breast development in men) * A component of hormone replacement therapy for transgender men Side effects Side effects of antiestrogens include hot flashes, osteoporosis, breast atrophy, vaginal dryness, and vaginal atrophy. In addition, they may cause depression and reduced libido. Pharmacology Antiestrogens act as antagonists of the estrogen receptors, ERŒ± and ERŒ≤.

It is located on Highway 6, 55 km. north of Regina, Saskatchewan, the capital city of the province of Saskatchewan. Southey is named after a famous English poet, Robert Southey. Additionally, most of the streets of Southey are named after English poets. Demographics According to the Canada 2011 Census, Southey's population was 778, which is a 9.4 percent rise from 2006. The median age was 39.9 years (males:37.4 yrs., females:42.0 yrs.) There were 354 private dwellings and the median household income was $71,585. History The vast prairie land of the Northwest Territories was opened for settlement during the latter part of the 1880s and 1890s. Prior to this, the whole area was home to the First Nations people and their culture. Settlement by Europeans and Americans followed the river valleys and then the westward movement of the railway. The first early settlement in the Southey area consisted of ranchers north and south of the present townsite. H.B. Chandler, one of the first settlers, filed on land on the south side of town in 1903. When the railway arrived in the area, he applied for the site to be named ‚ÄúSouthey‚Äù, after Robert Southey, one of his favourite English poets. From this point on, the town grew and developed with the appearance of the first stores, school, banks, elevators, barber shop, hardware and implement dealers, restaurants, lumber yard, telephone system, sidewalks, fire brigades and others in the 1905 - 1912 period. This growth allowed Southey to be incorporated in 1907-08. Subsequently, streets were named after other English writers and poets, so it is possible to travel down streets named Keats, Browning, Burns, Byron, Coleridge, Frost, Kipling, Milton and others. In 1988 Southey celebrated its 80th anniversary and in 2008 the town had a 100th year celebration. Education The Robert Southey School is a K-12 school incorporating over 100 years of history. In 2006 Southey School celebrated its centenary.

The summit is a difficult hike from the nearest trail head, making it one of the more distant locations in the wilderness. The last portion of the trail from Little Pines to the summit is not well used and often overgrown with chaparral. There are a few Santa Lucia Firs near the summit. There is a plastic box containing a summit register under some rocks at the peak. The peak is at the center of three watersheds: the Big Sur River watershed to the south, the Little Sur River watershed to the west and north west, and the Carmel River watershed to the east and south east. The largely inaccessible Ventana Cone is a few miles to the southeast. The view from the Ventana Double Cone is notable, enabling individuals to view the Pacific Ocean to the west and Chew's Ridge 30 miles inland. The summit is often covered in fog during summer months and hikers need to arrive at the peak in the morning to maximize chances of a clear view.  Fire lookout  A forest fire lookout was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1934-35 along with a supply trail that connected the lookout via Rattlesnake Creek to the Carmel River Guard Station. The lookout was situated on the southern of the two peaks, offering the lookout staff a wide view over the region. When the Bottchers Gap Guard Station was built in 1950, the Double Cone Trail was constructed that connected to the Rattlesnake Creek trail. Supplies were then brought in for summer fire lookout season by a twice-monthly pack train. The Forest Patrolman who resided at Bottcher's Gap led the train over Skinner Ridge and the Ventana Double Cone trail. The mule train usually spent one night of the trip at the old Comings Cabin.Sherman Comings, a descendant of a family who purchased property near Bottcher's Gap in 1927, says his family spelled the name \\"Boucher.\\" The lookout tower was decommissioned in the mid-1960s. The structure was struck by lightning or deliberately set fire by USFS personnel and burned to the ground in 1967 to 1977. Only the stone and concrete foundation remains today. The lookout atop the Ventana Double Cone was one of six active fire lookouts in the Monterey Ranger District of the Los Padres National Forest.

He was ranked first at the 2007 Draft Camp for aerobic capability, recording a 15.2 beep test result. Cale Morton attended Hale School in Western Australia and was a member of both the 1st XVIII football side and 1st XI cricket side, captaining the 1st XVIII in his final year at school. His two brothers also played in the AFL. Mitch played for Richmond Football Club and the Sydney Swans and Jarryd played for the Hawthorn Football Club. Cale also won the Larke Medal in 2007 for being the best player at the 2007 Under 18's National Championships. Melbourne Demons In 2008 he won the best first year player award at the Melbourne Football Club. Cale was nominated for the NAB AFL Rising Star in Round 20, 2008. West Coast Eagles In the 2012 trade period, he was traded to the West Coast Eagles in exchange for pick 88. Morton loomed as one of the trade bargains, lured back to Western Australia after five seasons and 73 games with Melbourne where he twice finished in the top 10 of the Demons‚Äô best and fairest count. Tall and athletic at 192 cm and 88 kg, Morton played a variety of roles while at Melbourne, but spent most of his time through the midfield. The Eagles traded selection 88, secured from Port Adelaide after trading Lewis Stevenson to the Power, to land Morton. The move didn't reinvigorate his career however, and he was delisted at the end of the 2013 season.

It is based on Graham Swift's 1983 novel of the same name. The film moved the contemporary location from England to Pittsburgh and eliminated many of the extensive historical asides. Plot The film follows the story of an anguished English-born Pittsburgh high school teacher (Irons) in 1974 going through a reassessment of his life. His method is to narrate his life to his class and interweave three generations of his family's history. The film portrays the history teacher's narrative in the form of flashbacks to tell the story of a teenage boy and his mentally challenged older brother living in The Fens of England with their widowed father. In an opening scene the teacher's childless wife (Cusack) takes a child from a supermarket and believes it to be hers. The teacher explains to his class how he and his wife had a teenage romance which led to a disastrous abortion that left her infertile. The teacher is tortured by the guilt of this as well as the jealousy he demonstrated to his older brother when he suspected his girlfriend's child was his brother's. The girl's flirtation with the older brother sets off events that lead to the older boy's death by drowning. A side-theme is the teacher's grandfather, who was a successful brewer and who fathered with his daughter the narrator's older brother. The film ends with the teacher's dismissal from his school and a possible renewal of his relationship with his wife.

It stars Ronald Colman as the title character, a proper English gentleman who moonlights as a notorious jewel thief, and Kay Francis as his love interest. It is based on the play Raffles, the Amateur Cracksman (1906) by E. W. Hornung and Eugene Wiley Presbrey, which was in turn adapted from the 1899 short story collection of the same name by Hornung. Oscar Lagerstrom was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Sound Recording. The story had been filmed previously as Raffles, the Amateur Cracksman (1917) with John Barrymore as Raffles, and again as Raffles, the Amateur Cracksman (1925) by Universal Studios. A 1939 film version, also produced by Goldwyn, stars David Niven in the title role. Plot Gentleman jewel thief A.J. Raffles (Ronald Colman) decides to give up his criminal ways as the notorious \\"Amateur Cracksman\\" after falling in love with Lady Gwen (Kay Francis). However, when his friend Bunny Manders (Bramwell Fletcher) tries to commit suicide because of a gambling debt he cannot repay, Raffles decides to take on one more job for Bunny's sake. He joins Bunny and Gwen as guests of Lord and Lady Melrose, with an eye toward acquiring the Melrose necklace, once the property of Empress Jos√©phine. Complications arise when a gang of thieves also decides to try for the necklace at the same time. Inspector Mackenzie of Scotland Yard (David Torrence) gets wind of their plot and shows up at the Melrose estate with his men. Burglar Crawshaw breaks into the house and succeeds in stealing the jewelry, only to have Raffles take it away from him. Crawshaw is caught by the police, but learns his robber's identity. Meanwhile, both Gwen and Mackenzie suspect that Raffles is the famous jewel thief. When the necklace is not found, Mackenzie insists that all the guests remain inside, then quickly changes his mind. Gwen overhears Mackenzie tell one of his men that he intends to let Crawshaw escape, expecting the crook to go after Raffles and thereby incriminate him. She follows Raffles back to London to warn him. Crawshaw does as Mackenzie anticipated. However, Raffles convinces Crawshaw that it is too dangerous to pursue his original goal with all the policemen around and helps him escape. Then, Raffles publicly confesses to being the Amateur Cracksman. When Lord Melrose shows up, Raffles reminds him of the reward he offered for the necklace's return (conveniently the same amount that Bunny owes) and produces the jewelry. Then, he outwits Mackenzie and escapes, after arranging with Gwen to meet her in Paris. Cast * Ronald Colman as A.J.

They are one of the greatest barriers standing in the way of plans for interplanetary travel by crewed spacecraft, but space radiation health risks also occur for missions in low Earth orbit such as the International Space Station (ISS). In October 2015, the NASA Office of Inspector General issued a health hazards report related to space exploration, including a human mission to Mars. The deep- space radiation environment Sources of ionizing radiation in interplanetary space. The radiation environment of deep space is different from that on the Earth's surface or in low Earth orbit, due to the much larger flux of high- energy galactic cosmic rays (GCRs), along with radiation from solar proton events (SPEs) and the radiation belts. Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) consist of high energy protons (85%), helium (14%) and other high energy nuclei (HZE ions). Solar energetic particles consist primarily of protons accelerated by the Sun to high energies via proximity to solar flares and coronal mass ejections. Heavy ions and low energy protons and helium particles are highly ionizing forms of radiation, which produce distinct biological damage compared to X-rays and gamma-rays. Microscopic energy deposition from highly ionizing particles consists of a core radiation track due to direct ionizations by the particle and low energy electrons produced in ionization, and a penumbra of higher energy electrons that may extend hundreds of microns from the particles path in tissue. The core track produces extremely large clusters of ionizations within a few nanometres, which is qualitatively distinct from energy deposition by X-rays and gamma rays; hence human epidemiology data which only exists for these latter forms of radiation is limited in predicting the health risks from space radiation to astronauts. But of course the radiation belts are within Earth's magnetosphere and do not occur in deep space, while organ dose equivalents on the International Space Station are dominated by GCR not trapped radiation. Microscopic energy deposition in cells and tissues is distinct for GCR compared to X-rays on Earth, leading to both qualitative and quantitative differences in biological effects, while there is no human epidemiology data for GCR for cancer and other fatal risks. The solar cycle is an approximately 11-year period of varying solar activity including solar maximum where the solar wind is strongest and solar minimum where the solar wind is weakest. Galactic cosmic rays create a continuous radiation dose throughout the Solar System that increases during solar minimum and decreases during solar maximum (solar activity). The inner and outer radiation belts are two regions of trapped particles from the solar wind that are later accelerated by dynamic interaction with the Earth's magnetic field. While always high, the radiation dose in these belts can increase dramatically during geomagnetic storms and substorms. Solar proton events (SPEs) are bursts of energetic protons accelerated by the Sun. They occur relatively rarely and can produce extremely high radiation levels. Without thick shielding, SPEs are sufficiently strong to cause acute radiation poisoning and death. Life on the Earth's surface is protected from galactic cosmic rays by a number of factors: # The Earth's atmosphere is opaque to primary cosmic rays with energies below about 1 gigaelectron volt (GeV), so only secondary radiation can reach the surface. The secondary radiation is also attenuated by absorption in the atmosphere, as well as by radioactive decay in flight of some particles, such as muons. Particles entering from a direction far from the zenith are especially attenuated. The world's population receives an average of 0.4 millisieverts (mSv) of cosmic radiation annually (separate from other sources of radiation exposure like inhaled radon) due to atmospheric shielding. At 12 km altitude, above most of the atmosphere's protection, radiation as an annual rate rises to 20 mSv at the equator to 50‚Äì120 mSv at the poles, varying between solar maximum and minimum conditions.Evaluation of the Cosmic Ray Exposure of Aircraft CrewSources and Effects of Ionizing Radiation, UNSCEAR 2008 # Missions beyond low Earth orbit transit the Van Allen radiation belts. Thus they may need to be shielded against exposure to cosmic rays, Van Allen radiation, or solar flares. The region between two and four Earth radii lies between the two radiation belts and is sometimes referred to as the \\"safe zone\\". See the implications of the Van Allen belts for space travel for more information. # The interplanetary magnetic field, embedded in the solar wind, also deflects cosmic rays. As a result, cosmic ray fluxes within the heliopause are inversely correlated with the solar cycle. # Electromagnetic radiation created by lightning in clouds only a few miles high can create a safe zone in the Van Allen radiation belts that surround the earth. This zone, known as the \\"Van Allen Belt slot\\", may be a safe haven for satellites in medium Earth orbits (MEOs), protecting them from the Sun's intense radiation. As a result, the energy input of GCRs to the atmosphere is negligible ‚Äì about 10‚àí9 of solar radiation ‚Äì roughly the same as starlight.Jasper Kirkby; Cosmic Rays And Climate CERN-PH-EP/2008-005 26 March 2008 Of the above factors, all but the first one apply to low Earth orbit craft, such as the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station. Exposures on the ISS average 150 mSv per year, although frequent crew rotations minimize individual risk.Space Radiation Organ Doses for Astronauts on Past and Future Missions Table 4 Astronauts on Apollo and Skylab missions received on average 1.2 mSv/day and 1.4 mSv/day respectively. Since the durations of the Apollo and Skylab missions were days and months, respectively, rather than years, the doses involved were smaller than would be expected on future long-term missions such as to a near-Earth asteroid or to Mars (unless far more shielding could be provided). On 31 May 2013, NASA scientists reported that a possible human mission to Mars may involve a great radiation risk based on the amount of energetic particle radiation detected by the radiation assessment detector (RAD) on the Mars Science Laboratory while traveling from the Earth to Mars in 2011‚Äì2012. However, the absorbed dose and dose equivalent for a Mars mission were predicted in the early 1990s by Badhwar, Cucinotta, and others (see for example Badhwar, Cucinotta et al., Radiation Research vol. 138, 201‚Äì208, 1994) and the result of the MSL experiment are to a large extent consistent with these earlier predictions. Human health effects thumb350pxleft Comparison of radiation doses, includes the amount detected on the trip from Earth to Mars by the RAD on the MSL (2011‚Äì2013). The y-axis scale is in logarithmic scale. For example, the exposure from 6 months aboard the ISS is roughly a factor of 10 greater than that from an abdominal CT scan. The potential acute and chronic health effects of space radiation, as with other ionizing radiation exposures, involve both direct damage to DNA, indirect effects due to generation of reactive oxygen species, and changes to the biochemistry of cells and tissues, which can alter gene transcription and the tissue microenvironment along with producing DNA mutations. Acute (or early radiation) effects result from high radiation doses, and these are most likely to occur after solar particle events (SPEs). Likely chronic effects of space radiation exposure include both stochastic events such as radiation carcinogenesis and deterministic degenerative tissue effects. To date, however, the only pathology associated with space radiation exposure is a higher risk for radiation cataract among the astronaut corps. The health threat depends on the flux, energy spectrum, and nuclear composition of the radiation. The flux and energy spectrum depend on a variety of factors: short- term solar weather, long-term trends (such as an apparent increase since the 1950s), and position in the Sun's magnetic field. These factors are incompletely understood. The Mars Radiation Environment Experiment (MARIE) was launched in 2001 in order to collect more data. Estimates are that humans unshielded in interplanetary space would receive annually roughly 400 to 900 mSv (compared to 2.4 mSv on Earth) and that a Mars mission (12 months in flight and 18 months on Mars) might expose shielded astronauts to roughly 500 to 1000 mSv. These doses approach the 1 to 4 Sv career limits advised by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) for low Earth orbit activities in 1989, and the more recent NCRP recommendations of 0.5 to 2 Sv in 2000 based on updated information on dose to risk conversion factors. Dose limits depend on age at exposure and sex due to difference in susceptibility with age, the added risks of breast and ovarian cancers to women, and the variability of cancer risks such as lung cancer between men and women. A 2017 laboratory study on mice, estimates that the risk of developing cancer due to galactic cosmic rays (GCR) radiation exposure after a Mars mission could be two times greater than what scientists previously thought.Study: Collateral Damage from Cosmic Rays Increases Cancer Risk for Mars Astronauts. University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV). May 2017. The quantitative biological effects of cosmic rays are poorly known, and are the subject of ongoing research. Several experiments, both in space and on Earth, are being carried out to evaluate the exact degree of danger. Additionally, the impact of the space microgravity environment on DNA repair has in part confounded the interpretation of some results. Experiments over the last 10 years have shown results both higher and lower than predicted by current quality factors used in radiation protection, indicating large uncertainties exist. Experiments in 2007 at Brookhaven National Laboratory's NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) suggest that biological damage due to a given exposure is actually about half what was previously estimated: specifically, it suggested that low energy protons cause more damage than high energy ones. This was explained by the fact that slower particles have more time to interact with molecules in the body. This may be interpreted as an acceptable result for space travel as the cells affected end up with greater energy deposition and are more likely to die without proliferating into tumors. This is in contrast to the current dogma on radiation exposure to human cells which considers lower energy radiation of higher weighting factor for tumor formation. Relative biological effectiveness (RBE) depends on radiation type described by particle charge number, Z, and kinetic energy per amu, E, and varies with tumor type with limited experimental data suggesting leukemia's having the lowest RBE, liver tumors the highest RBE, and limited or no experimental data on RBE available for cancers that dominate human cancer risks including lung, stomach, breast, and bladder cancers. Studies of Harderian gland tumors in a single strain of female mice with several heavy ions have been made, however it is not clear how well the RBE for this tumor type represents the RBE for human cancers such as lung, stomach, breast and bladder cancers nor how RBE changes with sex and genetic background. Part of the ISS year long mission is to determine the health impacts of cosmic ray exposure over the course of one year spent aboard the International Space Station. However, sample sizes for accurately estimating health risks directly from crew observations for the risks of concern (cancer, cataracts, cognitive and memory changes, late CNS risks, circulatory diseases, etc.) are large (typically >>10 persons) and necessarily involve long post-mission observation times (>10 years). It will be difficult for a sufficient number of astronauts to occupy the ISS and for the missions to continue long enough to make an impact on risk predictions for late effects due to statistical limitations. Hence the need for ground-based research to predict cosmic ray health risks. In addition, radiation safety requirements mandate that risks should be adequately understood prior to astronauts incurring significant risks, and methods developed to mitigate the risks if necessary.  Central nervous system  Hypothetical early and late effects on the central nervous system are of great concern to NASA and an area of active current research interest. It is postulated short- and long-term effects of CNS exposure to galactic cosmic radiation are likely to pose significant neurological health risks to human long-term space travel. Estimates suggest considerable exposure to high energy heavy (HZE) ions as well as protons and secondary radiation during Mars or prolonged Lunar missions with estimates of whole body effective doses ranging from 0.17 to greater than 1.0 Sv. Given the high linear energy transfer potential of such particles, a considerable proportion of those cells exposed to HZE radiation are likely to die. Based on calculations of heavy ion fluences during space flight as well as various experimental cell models, as many as 5% of an astronaut's cells might be killed during such missions. With respect to cells in critical brain regions, as many as 13% of such cells may be traversed at least once by an iron ion during a three-year Mars mission. Several Apollo astronauts reported seeing light flashes, although the precise biological mechanisms responsible are unclear. Likely pathways include heavy ion interactions with retinal photoreceptors and Cherenkov radiation resulting from particle interactions within the vitreous humor. This phenomenon has been replicated on Earth by scientists at various institutions. As the duration of the longest Apollo flights was less than two weeks, the astronauts had limited cumulative exposures and a corresponding low risk for radiation carcinogenesis. In addition, there were only 24 such astronauts, making statistical analysis of any potential health effects problematic. In the above discussion dose equivalents is units of Sievert (Sv) are noted, however the Sv is a unit for comparing cancer risks for different types of ionizing radiation. For CNS effects absorbed doses in Gy are more useful, while the RBE for CNS effects is poorly understood. Furthermore, stating \\"hypothetical\\" risk is problematic, while space radiation CNS risk estimates have largely focused on early and late detriments to memory and cognition (e.g. Cucinotta, Alp, Sulzman, and Wang, Life Sciences in Space Research, 2014). On 31 December 2012, a NASA-supported study reported that human spaceflight may harm the brains of astronauts and accelerate the onset of Alzheimer's disease. This research is problematic due to many factors, inclusive of the intensity of which mice were exposed to radiation which far exceeds normal mission rates. A review of CNS space radiobiology by Cucinotta, Alp, Sulzman, and Wang (Life Sciences in Space Research, 2014) summarizes research studies in small animals of changes to cognition and memory, neuro-inflammation, neuron morphology, and impaired neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Studies using simulated space radiation in small animals suggest temporary or long-term cognitive detriments could occur during a long-term space mission. Changes to neuron morphology in mouse hippocampus and pre-frontal cortex occur for heavy ions at low doses (<0.3 Gy). Studies in mice and rats of chronic neuro-inflammation and behavioral changes show variable results at low doses (~0.1 Gy or lower). Further research is needed to understand if such cognitive detriments induced by space radiation would occur in astronauts and whether they would negatively impact a Mars mission. The cumulative heavy ion doses in space are low such that critical cells and cell components will receive only 0 or 1 particle traversal. The cumulative heavy ion dose for a Mars mission near solar minimum would be ~0.05 Gy and lower for missions at other times in the solar cycle. This suggests dose-rate effects will not occur for heavy ions as long as the total doses used in experimental studies in reasonably small (<~0.1 Gy). At larger doses (>~0.1 Gy) critical cells and cell components could receive more than one particle traversal, which is not reflective of the deep space environment for extended duration missions such as a mission to Mars. An alternative assumption would be if a tissue's micro-environment is modified by a long-range signaling effect or change to biochemistry, whereby a particle traversal to some cells modifies the response of other cells not traversed by particles. There is limited experimental evidence, especially for central nervous system effects, available to evaluate this alternative assumption. Prevention Spacecraft shielding Standard spacecraft shielding, integrated into hull design, is strong protection from most solar radiation, but defeats this purpose with high-energy cosmic rays, as it simply splits this into showers of secondary particles. This shower of secondary and fragmented particles may be reduced by the use of hydrogen or light elements for shielding. Material shielding can be effective against galactic cosmic rays, but thin shielding may actually make the problem worse for some of the higher energy rays, because more shielding causes an increased amount of secondary radiation, although thick shielding could counter such too.NASA SP-413 Space Settlements: A Design Study. Appendix E Mass Shielding Retrieved 3 May 2011. The aluminium walls of the ISS, for example, are believed to produce a net reduction in radiation exposure. In interplanetary space, however, it is believed that thin aluminium shielding would give a net increase in radiation exposure but would gradually decrease as more shielding is added to capture generated secondary radiation. Studies of space radiation shielding should include tissue or water equivalent shielding along with the shielding material under study. This observation is readily understood by noting that the average tissue self-shielding of sensitive organs is about 10 cm, and that secondary radiation produced in tissue such as low energy protons, helium and heavy ions are of high linear energy transfer (LET) and make significant contributions (>25%) to the overall biological damage from GCR. Studies of aluminum, polyethylene, liquid hydrogen, or other shielding materials, will involve secondary radiation not reflective of secondary radiation produced in tissue, hence the need to include tissue equivalent shielding in studies of space radiation shielding effectiveness. Several strategies are being studied for ameliorating the effects of this radiation hazard for planned human interplanetary spaceflight: * Spacecraft can be constructed out of hydrogen-rich plastics, rather than aluminium. * Material shielding has been considered: ** Liquid hydrogen, often used as fuel, tends to give relatively good shielding, while producing relatively low levels of secondary radiation. Therefore, the fuel could be placed so as to act as a form of shielding around the crew. However, as fuel is consumed by the craft, the crew's shielding decreases. ** Water, which is necessary to sustain life, could also contribute to shielding. But it too is consumed during the journey unless waste products are utilized. ** Asteroids could serve to provide shielding.Morgan, P. (2011) \\"To Hitch a Ride to Mars, Just Flag Down an Asteroid\\" Discover magazine blog * Magnetic deflection of charged radiation particles and/or electrostatic repulsion is a hypothetical alternative to pure conventional mass shielding under investigation. In theory, power requirements for a 5-meter torus drop from an excessive 10 GW for a simple pure electrostatic shield (too discharged by space electrons) to a moderate 10 kilowatts (kW) by using a hybrid design. However, such complex active shielding is untried, with workability and practicalities more uncertain than material shielding. Special provisions would also be necessary to protect against a solar proton event, which could increase fluxes to levels that would kill a crew in hours or days rather than months or years. Potential mitigation strategies include providing a small habitable space behind a spacecraft's water supply or with particularly thick walls or providing an option to abort to the protective environment provided by the Earth's magnetosphere. The Apollo mission used a combination of both strategies. Upon receiving confirmation of an SPE, astronauts would move to the Command Module, which had thicker aluminium walls than the Lunar Module, then return to Earth. It was later determined from measurements taken by instruments flown on Apollo that the Command Module would have provided sufficient shielding to prevent significant crew harm. None of these strategies currently provide a method of protection that would be known to be sufficient while conforming to likely limitations on the mass of the payload at present (around $10,000/kg) launch prices. Scientists such as University of Chicago professor emeritus Eugene Parker are not optimistic it can be solved anytime soon. For passive mass shielding, the required amount could be too heavy to be affordably lifted into space without changes in economics (like hypothetical non-rocket spacelaunch or usage of extraterrestrial resources) ‚Äî many hundreds of metric tons for a reasonably-sized crew compartment. For instance, a NASA design study for an ambitious large space station envisioned 4 metric tons per square meter of shielding to drop radiation exposure to 2.5 mSv annually (¬± a factor of 2 uncertainty), less than the tens of milli sieverts or more in some populated high natural background radiation areas on Earth, but the sheer mass for that level of mitigation was considered practical only because it involved first building a lunar mass driver to launch material. Several active shielding methods have been considered that might be less massive than passive shielding, but they remain speculative.Simulations of Magnetic Shields for Spacecraft. Retrieved 3 May 2011. Since the type of radiation penetrating farthest through thick material shielding, deep in interplanetary space, is GeV positively charged nuclei, a repulsive electrostatic field has been proposed, but this has problems including plasma instabilities and the power needed for an accelerator constantly keeping the charge from being neutralized by deep-space electrons.NASA SP-413 Space Settlements: A Design Study. Appendix D The Plasma Core Shield Retrieved 3 May 2011. A more common proposal is magnetic shielding generated by superconductors (or plasma currents). Among the difficulties with this proposal is that, for a compact system, magnetic fields up to 10‚Äì20 teslas could be required around a crewed spacecraft, higher than the several teslas in MRI machines. Such high fields can produce headaches and migraines in MRI patients, and long-duration exposure to such fields has not been studied. Opposing-electromagnet designs might cancel the field in the crew sections of the spacecraft, but would require more mass. It is also possible to use a combination of a magnetic field with an electrostatic field, with the spacecraft having zero total charge. The hybrid design would theoretically ameliorate the problems, but would be complex and possibly infeasible. Part of the uncertainty is that the effect of human exposure to galactic cosmic rays is poorly known in quantitative terms. The NASA Space Radiation Laboratory is currently studying the effects of radiation in living organisms as well as protective shielding.  Wearable radiation shielding  Apart from passive and active radiation shielding methods, which focus on protecting the spacecraft from harmful space radiation, there has been much interest in designing personalized radiation protective suits for astronauts. The reason behind choosing such methods of radiation shielding is that in passive shielding, adding a certain thickness to the spacecraft can increase the mass of the spacecraft by several thousands of kilograms. This mass can surpass the launch constraints and costs several millions of dollars. On the other hand, active radiation shielding methods is an emerging technology which is still far away in terms of testing and implementation. Even with the simultaneous use of active and passive shielding, wearable protective shielding may be useful, especially in reducing the health effects of SPEs, which generally are composed of particles that have a lower penetrating force than GCR particles. The materials suggested for this type of protective equipment is often polyethylene or other hydrogen rich polymers. Water has also been suggested as a shielding material. The limitation with wearable protective solutions is that they need to be ergonomically compatible with crew needs such as movement inside crew volume. One attempt at creating wearable protection for space radiation was done by the Italian Space Agency, where a garment was proposed that could be filled with recycled water on the signal of incoming SPE. A collaborative effort between the Israeli Space Agency, StemRad. and Lockheed Martin. was AstroRad, tested aboard ISS. The product is designed as an ergonomically suitable protective vest, which can minimize the effective dose by SPE to an extent similar to onboard storm shelters.Waterman, G., Milstein, O., Knight, L., Charles, J., Coderre, K., Posey, J., Semones, E. \\"AstroRad Radiation Protective Equipment Evaluations On Orion AND ISS\\", IAC-19,A1,5,5,x52629, 70 th International Astronautical Congress (IAC) It also has potential to mildly reduce the effective dose of GCR through extensive use during the mission during such routine activities such as sleeping. This radiation protective garment uses selective shielding methods to protect most radiation-sensitive organs such as BFO, stomach, lungs, and other internal organs, thereby reducing the mass penalty and launch cost. Drugs and medicine Another line of research is the development of drugs that enhance the body's natural capacity to repair damage caused by radiation. Some of the drugs that are being considered are retinoids, which are vitamins with antioxidant properties, and molecules that retard cell division, giving the body time to fix damage before harmful mutations can be duplicated. It has also been suggested that only through substantial improvements and modifications could the human body endure the conditions of space travel. While not constrained by basic laws of nature in the way technical solutions are, this is far beyond current science of medicine. See transhumanism. Timing of missions Due to the potential negative effects of astronaut exposure to cosmic rays, solar activity may play a role in future space travel. Because galactic cosmic ray fluxes within the Solar System are lower during periods of strong solar activity, interplanetary travel during solar maximum should minimize the average dose to astronauts. Although the Forbush decrease effect during coronal mass ejections can temporarily lower the flux of galactic cosmic rays, the short duration of the effect (1‚Äì3 days) and the approximately 1% chance that a CME generates a dangerous solar proton event limits the utility of timing missions to coincide with CMEs. Orbital selection Radiation dosage from the Earth's radiation belts is typically mitigated by selecting orbits that avoid the belts or pass through them relatively quickly. For example, a low Earth orbit, with low inclination, will generally be below the inner belt. The orbits of the Earth-Moon system Lagrange points - take them out of the protection of the Earth's magnetosphere for approximately two-thirds of the time. The orbits of Earth-Sun system Lagrange Points and - are always outside the protection of the Earth's magnetosphere.

Shuffle tracking is typically done in blackjack games, although it can be done in other card games. Games with simple shuffles are generally easier to shuffle track than games with complicated shuffles. Thus, shuffle tracking is usually done in 6 or 8 deck shoe-dealt blackjack games, as these tend to have simpler shuffles compared to pitch games, due to the time required to accomplish a complicated shuffle on 6 or 8 decks of cards. Shuffle tracking Shuffle tracking is an advanced technique used with card counting. Many types of shuffle tracking exist.http://www.blackjackincolor.com/Shuffletracking1.htm Blackjack Shuffle Tracking Charts Generally, the player, or a team member, keeps track of the count (high cards versus low cards) of one or more subsections of the cards as they are played. The selected sections may or may not be predetermined by observing and mapping the shuffle. These sections are referred to as tracking zones. The player may attempt to follow slugs of cards through the shuffle, or have a good idea of the final location by previously analyzing the shuffle. After the shuffle, play zones exist which contain most of the cards in the tracking zone as well as other cards. The player can then cut zones with high cards into play, or with low cards out of play, thus changing the normal composition of the shoe. Betting can then be altered to reflect the altered composition.[http://www.qfit.com/blackjackshuffletracking.htm \\"Blackjack Shuffle-Tracking Treatise\\". Ace sequencing Another form related to shuffle tracking is called ace sequencing, because it involves attempting to determine when an ace is about to be dealt. If a player knows that he will be dealt an ace as his first card, he gains a 50.43% advantage. This is because a player has about a 31% (depending on number of decks) chance of getting a blackjack and a good chance of making a strong hand if he is not dealt a blackjack. First the player should know what segments the discards are likely to appear relatively intact after a shuffle. He then observes aces as they are placed into the discard tray within a segment. He then remembers the two or three cards placed on top of the ace in the tray. These are called key cards. After the shuffle, the player looks for the key cards. The ace is likely to follow these cards and the player may be able to raise his bet in anticipation of receiving the ace. One of the first books to be published on Ace sequencing was David McDowell's Blackjack Ace Prediction which provided an overview of the skill. Although critically acclaimed on its release in 2004, it was later discovered that some of the mathematical theory in the book was faulty .

It was the first successful rimless pistol cartridge. History and Design With a rimless, bottlenecked case using smokeless powder, the 7.65√ó25mm Borchardt adapted features of the 7.92mm cartridge used in the 1888 pattern M/88 rifle, essentially scaling it down for use in a pistol. Georg Luger also claimed to have influenced the design of the Borchardt pistol cartridge. The Feederle brothers (Fidel, Friedrich, and Josef) used the Borchardt cartridge in their design for the Mauser C96 pistol. The Borchardt cartridge thus was the basis for the 7.63√ó25mm Mauser cartridge, which used the same dimensions but was eventually loaded with a stronger powder charge. By extension, the Borchardt cartridge was also the basis for the 7.62√ó25mm Tokarev cartridge, which was developed directly from the Mauser round using an even stronger powder charge than the Mauser cartridge. The 7.65√ó25mm Borchardt was also the basis of the 7.65√ó21mm Parabellum and 9√ó19mm Parabellum cartridges developed for the Luger pistol. The shorter case length of the 7.65√ó21mm Parabellum allowed for improvements in the Luger pistol, including a shorter stroke in the toggle mechanism as well as a smaller grip. The same shorter length of cartridge was maintained when the design transitioned to the 9√ó19mm Parabellum. The 7.65√ó25mm Borchardt was manufactured by DWM in Germany, Eley Brothers and Kynoch in Great Britain, and Remington Arms - Union Metallic Cartridge Co. and Winchester in the United States.

He immigrated to the United States in 1951 and later became an American citizen. Lindblad pioneered cruising to the Arctic, Tierra del Fuego, the Falkland Islands, but also to places such as the Seychelles and the islands east of Bali. In 1984, he led the first voyage by a tourist ship through the Northwest Passage from Newfoundland over the American continent and via Bering Strait to Yokohama, Japan.Lars-Eric Lindblad, 67, Pioneer Of Tours to Exotic Destinations, The New York Times, July 13, 1994. The voyage took 40 days and a distance of and the adventure was covered by most news media in North America and Europe.Lindblad Explorer Reunion of 2004, June 4 to June 6, 2004. Lindblad was president and chief executive officer of Lindblad Travel in Westport, Connecticut, for more than 30 years. The company introduced tourism in some of the most exotic parts of the globe including cruises to Antarctica, in 1966; to Easter Island and the Gal√°pagos Islands, in 1967, and along the coast of China and Bhutan in 1978. Many of these places had no facilities for visitors in the late 1950s and early 60s, when Lindblad Travel was in its infancy. In 1972, one of his company's ships, the MV Explorer, ran aground in Antarctica ‚Äì its passengers, including Lars-Eric Lindblad, were rescued by the Chilean Navy. Lindblad Travel ceased operations in 1989. In that year, the company was penalized more than $75,000 for violating United States trade embargoes against Vietnam and Cambodia by offering tours there. Lars-Eric Lindblad later said the penalties and legal fees incurred in his dispute with the U.S. Government contributed to the company's going out of business. In an interview in the New York Times when the penalties were levied, Lindblad said he had intentionally violated the sanctions. \\"I would do it again,\\" he said. \\"Travel in my opinion is not ordinary trade. Travel is a way of communication. To embargo travel is like burning books or imprisoning journalists.\\" Just three years later in 1992, the embargo against Cambodia was lifted by U.S. President George H. W. Bush, and in February 1994, President Bill Clinton lifted the trade embargo against Vietnam, resulting in a number of American companies starting to offer tours there. Lindblad was also a noted environmentalist who believed tourism had been responsible for saving many threatened areas. In opening remote and exotic areas of the world to tourism, he became widely recognized as a prominent figure of ecotourism. Lindblad was awarded the Order of the Golden Ark by the Netherlands for services to wildlife conservation, and was in 1987 made a Knight of the Polar Star by the King of Sweden. He also received a number of environmental and cultural awards, served on the council of the World Wildlife Fund and African Wildlife Foundation, and was elected to the Hall of Fame of the American Society of Travel Agents. In 1993, Travel & Leisure magazine named him one of the \\"top 20 explorers of all time\\". In 1995, the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names gave the name Lindblad Cove to a 5-mile wide cove on the Antarctic Peninsula in his honor.GNIS Detail - Lindblad Cove His autobiography, Passport to Anywhere with an introduction by the ornithologist Roger Tory Peterson, describes his many adventurous travel experiences.The Lindblad Legacy of Respectful Tourism , National Geographic Society, Washington, D.C.

Biography He was son of the Danish- Norwegian botanist and zoologist Martin Vahl (1749-1804). Jens Vahl graduated as a pharmacist in 1819 and then started studying botany and chemistry. Vahl participated W. A. Graah's expedition to uninhabited areas of East Greenland in 1828-1830 with the purpose to search for the lost Eastern Norse Settlement. The expedition - in umiaks - was largely unsuccessful, but Vahl's botanical collections extended the previous knowledge much. Financial support from king Christian VIII of Denmark enabled Vahl to continue his investigations. So he travelled in West Greenland from 1829‚Äì1836, visiting all the Danish colonies from Julianeh√•b in the South to Upernavik in the North. He returned to Copenhagen in 1836 with very extensive plant collections, which he later donated to the University of Copenhagen. The Vahl collections added several lengths to the previous investigations by Paul Egede, Morten Wormskjold and others, and effectively laid the foundation of knowledge about the flora of Greenland. In contrast to his predecessors, Vahl made meticulous notes on the finding circumstances, like exact location and habitat of the plants. In 1838-1839, Vahl participated in a French expedition lead by Joseph Paul Gaimard (1796‚Äì1858) to Nordkapp and Spitsbergen. In 1840, he was made assistant at the Botanic Garden in Copenhagen. He described many new species, e.g. Draba arctica, but he did not finish the planned Greenlandic flora before his death. His successor, Johan Lange, picked up the task two decades later, which resulted in Conspectus Florae Groenlandicae (1887‚Äì1894). Together with Salomon Drejer and Joakim Frederik Schouw, Vahl was the publisher of Flora Danica Fasc. 38.

They act by blocking the progesterone receptor (PR) and/or inhibiting or suppressing progestogen production. Antiprogestogens are one of three types of sex hormone antagonists, the others being antiestrogens and antiandrogens. Antiprogestogens are used as abortifacients and emergency contraceptives and in the treatment of uterine fibroids. They are also being studied in the treatment of breast cancer. Examples of antiprogestogens include the progesterone receptor weak partial agonist mifepristone, the selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM) ulipristal acetate, and the silent antagonist aglepristone. For medical abortion, mifepristone is combined with a prostaglandin (e.g., gemeprost). Several hundred antiprogestogens have been developed, but only three, mifepristone, lilopristone, and onapristone, have been given to humans, and of these, only mifepristone has been approved and introduced for clinical use.

The book raises questions of morality and accountability, as well as exploring the question of nature versus nurture. It won the Whitbread Award and was Highly Commended for the Carnegie Medal. Plot The story begins as Natalie and her parents move to live in The Palace Hotel, where her father will be the manager. They meet Tulip Pierce, a charming girl who tells imaginative, odd stories - embellishments which Natalie's father refers to as \\"the Tulip touch\\". As their relationship grows, Tulip introduces Natalie to a variety of sadistic and often dangerous games, such as tormenting strangers or endangering Natalie's younger brother Julius. Natalie finds out that Tulip's father is abusive to Tulip and her mother. Natalie's family are initially sympathetic towards Tulip, knowing the extent of the abuse to which Tulip and her mother are subjected. However, as her behaviour becomes more dangerous and erratic, Natalie's parents encourage her to end the friendship. Although other people seem mundane in comparison to Tulip's spontaneity and wild imagination, Natalie makes new friends. Meanwhile, Tulip's behaviour has grown more violent, stabbing bus seats and burning litter bins. When Tulip is not invited to the big Christmas party at The Palace, Tulip burns down the hotel, endangering Natalie's family and their guests. At the close of the novel, Natalie has moved to a new hotel with her family and things are going well for them. Her family, teachers, and the community all criticise and dislike Tulip, but Natalie feels immense guilt over what happened. Although she was too young to recognise the signs of abuse, Natalie wonders why the adults in their lives never helped Tulip. Major themes The book was inspired by the highly publicised murder of James Bulger, a two-year-old boy who was kidnapped, tortured and killed by a pair of ten-year-olds. Like the case, the story raises the question of nature versus nurture - in other words, are some children born bad, or are evil children the product of their circumstances? Fine stated in a 1998 interview that \\"it was not just the murder itself\\" that inspired her, \\"but the ghastly British response to it: 'Lock 'em up and throw away the key'\\". Reception The book received some criticism, along with others on the 1996 Carnegie Medal shortlist, for being too \\"grim\\" for children.

Cytochrome b-245 is composed of a light chain (alpha) and a heavy chain (beta). This gene encodes the light, alpha subunit, which has been proposed as a primary component of the microbicidal oxidase system of phagocytes. Mutations in this gene are associated with autosomal recessive chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), which is characterized by the failure of activated phagocytes to generate superoxide, which is important for the microbicidal activity of these cells.  Discovery  The p22phox protein (phox for phagocytic oxidase) was first identified in 1987 during the purification of the cytochrome b-245mv from human neutrophils. A few years before, this low-potential cytochrome b, also called cytochrome b558 (cytb) because of its spectral properties, was demonstrated as the major component of the microbicidal nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex in phagocytes. Cytb, the redox element of the NADPH oxidase complex, is a membrane heterodimer composed of two subunits: p22phox (also called the alpha or small subunit or the light chain of the cytb) and gp91phox (renamed NOX2 in the 2000s) or the beta or heavy chain or large subunit. By screening a cDNA library constructed from human promyelocytic leukemia cells, Parkos et al. isolated a cDNA corresponding to the light chain of cytb. The importance of the role of p22phox was evidenced by the discovery of autosomal recessive chronic granulomatous disease caused by mutations in CYBA and leading to the absence of cytb expression in phagocytes.  Gene  The human CYBA gene (OMIM number 233690) encoding the p22phox protein is located on the long arm of chromosome 16 at position 24 (16q24: 88,643,288 to 88,651,084, OMIM 608508), containing 6 exons, 5 introns and spanning 8.5kb (Fig. 1). An update of the promoter region of CYBA contains TATA, CCAC boxes, Sp1, -interferon, and nuclear factor B sites. The p22phox cDNA was also cloned in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and showed that the rat gene was homologous to both human and mouse genes. P22phox human mRNA is 0.8 kb and has a constitutive expression in a variety of cell types. P22phox expression is not related to the NOX2 transcript expression, suggesting that both subunits have an independent transcription process.  Protein structure and function  P22phox is a transmembrane protein that contains 195 amino acids and that has a molecular mass of 22.0 kDa. It associates with NOX2 and with NOX1, NOX3 and NOX4 in a 1:1 complex and has a ubiquitous expression. The main physiological role of p22phox is to contribute to the maturation and the stabilization of the heterodimer that it forms with NOX enzymes (NOX1‚Äì4) in order to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). Association of NOXs with p22phox in the late endoplasmic reticulum seems to be a prerequisite for the localization of the heterodimer to specific membrane compartments such as perinuclear vesicles for NOX4 and plasma membranes in the case of NOX1, 2 and 3. The importance of some sequences of p22phox for its interaction with NOXs has been highlighted. The hydropathic profile of p22phox deduced from the gene sequence is compatible with at least two (possibly three or four) transmembrane passages. However, the most probable are the two or four transmembrane-spanning models because they are compatible with a cytosolic location of both the N- and the C-terminal tail of p22phox. A polyproline-rich region (PRR) (K149 to E162 sequence) in the C-terminus of p22phox contains a consensus motif PxxP that interacts with the SH3 (SRC homology 3) domains of p47phox during NADPH oxidase assembly in phagocytes. This PRR-rich sequence also interacts with the cytosolic organizer NOXO1 homologs to p47phox expressed in nonphagocytic cells, during the activation of NADPH oxidases (NOX1, NOX2 and NOX3), except for NOX4, which is constitutively expressed. Phosphorylation of Thr147 close to the PRR region of p22phox enhances NADPH oxidase activity by promoting p47phox binding in phagocytes. ROSs generated by NOX2-p22phox (or cytb) in the phagocytes are microbicide and are able to kill microorganisms during infections. P22phox associated with NOX2 is also found in brain and especially in microglia. Anarchic ROS production by these cells is involved in the pathological process of degenerative diseases. P22phox can be associated with NOX1, NOX3 and NOX4 in several cells and tissues, but the level of ROS production is far lower than those produced in phagocytes by cytb. In this case ROSs are considered as signaling messengers rather than toxic products. Excessive ROS generation by NOX enzymes has been linked to a range of diseases including cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and hypertension, diabetes, neurodegenerative disease and ischemia/reperfusion injury. NOX1, NOX2 and NOX4, which require p22phox to be functional, are important contributors of ROS in tissues and especially vascular cells. Therefore, the variability of ROS production by NOXs could influence the risk of such diseases, although increased oxidative stress by p22phox overexpression has not been functionally characterized or attributed to a particular NOX family member.  Clinical relevance of mutations  Mutations in CYBA or CYBB, encoding p22phox or NOX2, respectively, lead to Chronic granulomatous disease because of the absence of cytb in both cases. This means that the synthesis of both subunits is essential for the maturation of cytb. CGD is a rare inherited disorder in which phagocytic cells are unable to kill pathogens during an infection. Patients suffer from severe and recurrent infections early in childhood. Actually, the main treatment is antibiotic and antifungal prophylaxis. Allogenic bone marrow transplantation is possible and genetic therapy is currently under development. The most frequent CGD form is X-linked CGD caused by mutations in CYBB (60% of cases). Mutations in the CYBA gene encoding p22phox are extremely rare (about 6%) and lead to AR-CGD220. However, in countries such as Turkey, Tunisia, Morocco and Jordan AR inheritance can be the predominant form because of the high rate of consanguinity. As of 2010, 55 different mutations of CYBA have been identified. Most CYBA mutations result in the absence of p22phox expression (AR-CGD220). The only missense mutation leading to a normal expression of a nonfunctional p22phox protein is Pro156Gln (AR-CGD22+) located in the potential cytosolic C-terminal tail of p22phox. This mutation in the PRR of p22phox disrupted the interaction between p22phox and p47phox, confirming the importance of this domain in the oxidase activation in neutrophils. Since p22phox is ubiquitous and associated with different NOXs, it could be logical that CGD patients suffer from the consequences of the absence of p22phox expression in tissues. However it is far from being evident. One possibility could be that the humans may be able to compensate for the absence of p22phox and/or NOXs in cells and tissues other than phagocytes. Given the rarity of the AR-CGD220 forms, information on the severity of this type of CGD is difficult to establish. A relationship between the presence of residual ROS production and the survival of CGD patients has been found. In case of CYBA mutations leading to the absence of p22phox, NOX2 expression is also absent and disables cytochrome b558, the redox element of the NADPH oxidase complex. Therefore, these mutations behave similarly to severe X-CGD. The molecular and phenotypic characterization of a p22phox-deficient mouse strain with the Tyr121His missense mutation in CYBA has been described. The p22phox deficiency results in the clinical and biological characteristics of CGD as well as a severe balance disorder in these mice. As the site of p22phox expression is in the inner ear, p22phox has been proposed as being involved in the control of vestibular organogenesis. In addition, mutations of NOX3 in head-tilt mice were associated with vestibular defects. Yet the in vivo relevance of p22phox for NOX3 function remains uncertain because AR-CGD220 patients do not suffer from vestibular dysfunction (personal data). One possibility could be that the human brain may be able to compensate the balance defect. In Matsumoto Eosinophilia Shinshu (MES) rats a loss-of-function mutation in CYBA was responsible for spontaneous and severe blood eosinophilia. These rats suffered from a balance defect due to a leak of otoconia in the inner ear, like nmf333 mice. In addition, MES rats retained normal innate immune defense against Staphylococcus aureus infection probably because of the hypereosinophilia. However, the mechanisms by which CYBA mutations lead to eosinophilia remain unknown.  Clinical relevance of single-nucleotide polymorphisms  Contrary to CYBB, CYBA supports a relatively high number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that could influence the level of ROS generation. These SNPs were mainly associated with cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), coronary heart disease (CHD) and also cerebral ischemic diseases. The first and most widely studied is the C242T polymorphism is located in exon 4 at position 214 from the ATG and resulting in a non conservative His72 substitution for a Tyr. Inoue et al. first found that the T allele of the C242 polymorphism might have a protective effect against CAD. Despite some evidence of the effect of this polymorphism on ROS generation at the cellular level, the association of the CYBA C242T polymorphism with cardiovascular diseases has been widely reported but with conflicting results. Single SNP analysis may explain the discrepancies among CYBA association studies. A global approach such as haplotype analysis is probably a better approach to understand the impact of CYBA genetic variability on diseases. CYBA variants together with polymorphism analysis of lipid metabolism or stress oxidant pathway genes are of great interest as well. However, for future investigations regarding the effect of these polymorphisms, it is crucial that the number of patients under study provide sufficient statistical power. In addition, genetics studies that include control of external factors should be extremely informative. Finally, since 2010 nine Chinese meta-analyses of the C242T polymorphism have been published in relation with CAD, hypertension atherosclerosis or diabetes and its complications and ischemic cerebrovascular diseases. The results from these meta-analyses were controversial. Several factors could influence these data: the search strategy, the identification of relevant studies (publication bias), the statistical analysis including a sufficient sampling, the prevalence of the studied polymorphism in the studied population [minor allele frequency (MAF)] and the type of population (population-based or not, for example). Results of these meta-analyses need to be confirmed with larger samples. In addition, a meta-analysis based on genome-wide association study data will be of great interest in the future.

BsMabs can be manufactured in several structural formats, and current applications have been explored for cancer immunotherapy and drug delivery.  Structural types and manufacturing methods  Three types of bispecific antibodies: trifunctional antibody, chemically linked Fab and bi-specific T-cell engager (bottom row). Blue and yellow parts distinguish parts from separate monoclonal antibodies. There are many formats of bsMab, but the two main categories are IgG-like and non-IgG-like. The main types of manufacturing methods are quadromas, chemical conjugation, and genetic recombination, and each method results in a unique format.  IgG-like  This format retains the traditional monoclonal antibody (mAb) structure of two Fab arms and one Fc region, except the two Fab sites bind different antigens. The most common types are called trifunctional antibodies, as they have three unique binding sites on the antibody: the two Fab regions, and the Fc region. Each heavy and light chain pair is from a unique mAb. The Fc region made from the two heavy chains forms the third binding site. These bsMabs are often manufactured with the quadroma, or the hybrid hybridoma, method. The \\"knobs into holes\\" approach for manufacturing IgG-like bsMabs is shown on the left, while a diagram depicting the DVD-Ig format is on the right. The red dot indicates a possible site for introducing mutations in the heavy chain. Blue and yellow correspond to separate monoclonal antibodies.However, the quadroma method relies on random chance to form usable bsMabs, and can be inefficient. Another method for manufacturing IgG-like bsMabs is called \\"knobs into holes,\\" and relies on introducing a mutation for a large amino acid in the heavy chain from one mAb, and a mutation for a small amino acid in the other mAb's heavy chain. This allows the target heavy chains (and their corresponding light chains) to fit together better, and makes bsMab production more reliable.  Non-IgG-like  There are other bsMabs that lack an Fc region entirely. These include chemically linked Fabs, consisting of only the Fab regions, and various types of bivalent and trivalent single-chain variable fragments (scFvs). There are also fusion proteins mimicking the variable domains of two antibodies. The furthest developed of these newer formats are the bi-specific T-cell engagers (BiTEs). Mechanism of action The mechanism of action of a bsMab, exemplified by catumaxomab, representing the first approved bispecific trifunctional antibody. The binding of a bsMab to its target antigens can lead to a variety of effects. The most widely used application of this approach is in cancer immunotherapy, where bsMabs are engineered to simultaneously bind a cytotoxic cell and a target like a tumour cell to be destroyed. It is possible to observe the bridging effect that bsAbs have on T-cell/cancer cell interactions using label-free live cell imaging. Catumaxomab, one of the first trifunctional antibodies approved for therapeutic use, binds both CD3 on cytotoxic T cells and EpCAM on human adenocarcinomas. The Fc region additionally binds to a cell that expresses Fc receptors, like a macrophage, natural killer cell or dendritic cell. Since the Fc region is still intact, this allows for the bsMab to trigger common immune responses when recognized by an Fc receptor, such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity or complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Example of cancer cells being killed cytotoxic T-Cells. Imaged with a label-free live cell imaging microscope. In work with Ebolavirus vaccines, a study has shown that a DVD-Ig antibody can be used to prevent viral escape from the endosome. Ebolaviruses infect cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Researchers developed DVD-Igs where the outer variable regions bind to the surface glycoproteins of the viral coat and enter the cell with the virus. These outer regions are cleaved in the viral endosome, revealing the inner variable regions that then bind to both the virus and internal receptors in the endosome. Blocking the interaction between the virus and endosomal proteins prevents viral escape from the endosome and further infection. Advantages over ordinary monoclonal antibodies Cancer immunotherapy with ordinary monoclonal antibodies does not activate T-lymphocytes because the Fab regions are already used for binding the tumour cells, and this type of cell does not have Fc receptors. Bispecific antibodies also have a higher cytotoxic potential, and bind to antigens that are expressed relatively weakly. The effective dose is around 0.01 mg¬∑m‚àí2¬∑d‚àí1 (milligrams per square metre body surface area per day), which is several orders of magnitude lower than with ordinary antibodies. For non-IgG-like bsMabs, their smaller size allows them to reach antigens usually unavailable to conventional antibodies. In the case of Ebola vaccines, this method allows the antibody to target intracellular targets not usually accessible by traditional monoclonal antibody treatments. Additionally, targeting more than one molecule can be useful to circumvent the regulation of parallel pathways and avoid resistance to the treatment. Binding or blocking multiple targets in a pathway can be beneficial to stopping disease, as most conditions have complicated multifaceted effects throughout the body.  Problems and current disadvantages  IgG-like antibodies can be immunogenic, which means the Fc region could cause detrimental downstream immune responses caused by cells that are activated by Fc receptors. The therapeutic use of bsMabs as a whole is still largely in development, with many clinical trials currently ongoing that are determining the efficacy and safety of bsMabs for treatment.  Clinical use  Two bispecific antibodies are presently in clinical use. Blinatumomab, which targets CD19 and CD3, is used in the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome negative B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Emicizumab, which targets clotting factors IXa and X, is used in the treatment of hemophilia A. Catumaxomab was withdrawn from the European market in 2017 for commercial reasons.

The manga began serialization in the monthly sh≈çnen manga magazine Dengeki Comic Gao! on October 27, 2005, and is published by MediaWorks. The first episode of the anime adaptation was broadcast on October 4, 2008. Plot Story Ten years before the events of the manga take place, 6-year old Sanpeita Kobayashi got engaged to his childhood friend, a mysterious pink-haired girl who promised they would meet again 10 years later, and she would become his bride. She then fed him a mysterious seed. Ten years after that day, Sanpeita has started to have dreams about his first love more and more. One day after the same dream, he wakes up to see robots crashing into his room, who are then defeated by a small but powerful robotic weird- looking girl. The girl identifies herself as \\"Kemeko\\" and tells him that from this day forth she is his bride. Remembering the girl from 10 years ago, Sanpeita at first doesn't believe that Kemeko is his first love, seeing as they look nothing alike (plus she also being a robot). However, when it is revealed that Kemeko is in fact a suit of robotic armor, piloted by a pink- haired girl named M.M., who greatly resembles his first love. Sanpeita is thrown into confusion as he tries to deduce M.M.'s real identity, despite her claiming of not having ever met him before. M.M., in the guise of Kemeko, instills herself into Sanpeita's life, moving in with him, becoming a teacher at his school, and likewise following him everywhere, presumably to protect him from the robots Mishima Electronics who are constantly targeting him for a mysterious power that he supposedly holds... It is later revealed that M.M. stands for Mei Mishima, daughter of Souichiro Mishima, founder of Mishima Electronics. Ten years ago Mei, her father, and her twin sister Mai came to Earth in a spaceship. One day when her father was busy working Mei escaped from the spaceship to go sightseeing on Earth, only to get lost. Sanpeita and his friend, Izumi Makihara, then helped her get back home, and from there the three played together every day. One day, however, when Mei got lost inside the spaceship she discovered girls who looked exactly like her (and by extension her twin sister), asleep inside a row of test tubes. Mai then appeared, revealing that she had known about this and her father's projects, one of which included the \\"Nano Ball\\", a seed that when given time to germinate inside a host, was a source of limitless power. When their father arrives and warns them of the danger, Mai tells him that she has no intentions of stopping what he started, and that she plans to use the power of the Nano Ball to create a perfect world for her and her sister. Mai then hands the Nano Ball to Mei, despite their father's attempts to stop her, and Mei's memories, including all of her memories of playing with Sanpeita and Izumi, are obliterated by the power of the Nano Ball. Mei escapes, and their father, who has been mortally wounded by the Nano Ball, gives her Kemeko, and sends her off into space, telling her to forgive Mai. Since then Mei lived as one with Kemeko, dedicating her life to protecting Sanpeita and the Nano Ball inside him. However, living with him is a constant reminder of what she lost, and she is devastated by not being able to recall any of the memories with Sanpeita that she kept in her journal. In the last volume, Sanpeita is kidnapped by Mai, who has become the president of Mishima Electronics, and taken to Mishima. Mai reveals that it was she, pretending to be her sister, who fed Sanpeita the Nano Ball seed 10 years ago‚Äînow she is here to unleash the incubated energies of the Nano Ball. By kissing him she unleashes the Nano Ball on the world, which causes strange plants to grow from every piece of Mishima equipment around the world, with which she plans to destroy the world and create a new, perfect world for herself and populate it with children of the Nano Ball. Her plans are put to end when Mei destroys Mai's Himiko, an advanced version of the Kemeko, and kisses Sanpeita to seal the power of the Nano Ball. In the aftermath, Mei forgives Mai and decides to allow her to be put in an intergalactic prison instead of killing her. Mei tells Sanpeita that she has fallen in love with him again and the two get engaged, this time for real. Characters ; : The main male protagonist. A high school student who still harbors feelings for a girl he met 10 years ago. His life was turned upside down when he was approached by Kemeko's pilot, who claimed to be his fianc√© and moved into his house. He was then constantly targeted by unknown assailants. Whenever he's in life-threatening danger, the Nano-Ball, that was planted inside of him, activates its self-defense mechanism, unleashing power that always defeats any threat posed to him and propelling him to safety. Sanpeita is unaware that the Nano Ball resides inside him, and moments where the Nano Ball is active, there are simply only holes left in his memory, unaware what had happened. His personality is kind, but because of a number of misunderstandings that are out of his control, he is constantly physically assaulted by both family, friends, and enemies alike. His kindness has made him popular with the girls, that he is chased after by Izumi, Mei (who truly cares for him, and which later in the story, actually falls in love with him all over again - since she lost her memory of falling in love with him the first time around), Yukina Kamishiro, and, as well as, one of Tamako's friends (who stalks him). In the end, he falls in love with Mei and the two get engaged. ; : A powerful combat robot suit, despite its chubby figure, piloted by M.M. (Mei Mishima). Since Mei rarely gets out from her robot suit Kemeko, everyone around Sanpeita thinks that Kemeko is actually a true person (her true form and not a robot suit). Her default paint scheme is a reference to the plugsuit used by Asuka Langley Soryu in Neon Genesis Evangelion. She has also been seen sporting a T-shirt with the NWO logo in Chapter 10. ; : Kemeko's pilot, who happens to be a tall and attractive girl who somehow manages to fit in Kemeko's smaller body. Despite her claims to have never met Sanpeita before moving to his house, she seems to be somehow familiar to him. She also wears the same bandages on her cheek just like the girl from ten years ago. Another appearance they share in common is their hair color. She later reveals that her true name is Mei Mishima, daughter of Souichiro Mishima, founder of Mishima Electronics. Ten years ago she escaped from the spaceship (her home at the time) that she came to Earth in, so she could go sightseeing, and met Sanpeita and Izumi. As her memories were later erased by the Nano Ball, her memories of Sanpeita and Izumi remain only in a journal that she kept. Her inability to recall the memories in her journal is a source of great pain for her, and living with Sanpeita is a constant reminder of what she has lost. For this reason she is almost always inside Kemeko at the beginning of the series, but starts to come out more often as Sanpeita encourages her to be herself. Over the course of the series, she falls in love with Sanpeita all over again, and when she does come out of Kemeko, it is usually out of jealousy to compete with the numerous other girls that like Sanpeita. At the end of the series, she tells him that she loves him, and the two get engaged. ; : Sanpeita's very well-endowed childhood friend and classmate, who harbors a crush on him. She tries to show her feelings, but Sanpeita is apparently oblivious. Whenever something perverted happens to her, she yells out \\"Unhealthy\\", then decks whoever caused the action, which Sanpeita is almost always on the receiving end of her rage. Izumi recognizes the similarity between M.M. and \\"Mei-chan\\", her friend from 10 years ago, and pursues her true identity much more fervently than Sanpeita, even calling out Mei-chan and accusing her of being both the girl from 10 years ago and Kemeko in front of the whole school. ; : Sanpeita's little sister, who's responsible for the house chores. She is revolted at first after finding that her brother got himself a \\"girlfriend\\", but later she befriends Kemeko and welcomes her into the house, even calling her \\"sister\\". ; : Sanpeita and Tamako's mother who works as a manga artist. Just like Tamako, she easily accepted Kemeko into the household, despite Sanpeita's protests. ; : A strange girl who is after the power hidden in Sanpeita. She carries a sword around and is not hesitant about using it. She is employed at Mishima, and is often seen with her black cat, Jyuumonji, who seems to be not an ordinary cat (like showing super strength). It turns out that Ryoko is also one of Sanpeita's classmates, but had not attended class since it started (not until she confronts Sanpeita and Kemeko). Also, even though Ryoko is a very skilled swordsman and fighter, it's also assumed that she can't swim. ; : Another one of Sanpeita's friends, who has also been Izumi's best friend since they were children. She is rather odd, with even Ryouta asking if she was human - during Chapter 5. She has a fetish in regards of being seen only wearing either her PE uniform or the school bathing suit. She seems to care for Izumi closely and even knowns of Izumi's true feelings for Sanpeita, encouraging her to act upon them. She also seems to come from a very rich family, which she has an older sister named Miura (who also has her own fetish). ; : Misaki's older sister, who has a fetish of wearing a maid outfit and acting like one, to the extent of making Sanpeita be her master. ; : Another friend of Sanpeita, who enjoys taking pictures. He tends to get beat up by the rest of the cast, and seems to have a crush on Ryoko. ; : The executive director of Mishima Electronics. She has a cutesy attitude and seems to have a liking for younger boys. The \\"M.\\" in her name stands for Make. ; : The cool acting red head of the series. Kyte is the head of the third R&D; Department at Mishima Electronics. He is a subordinate of Vanilla Make Repairs. He is very carefree, which is why he ignores orders from his higher-ups. He seems to have a relationship with Mei. ; : Kiriko is a robot similar to Kemeko, only with black hair and an eye-patch. It is piloted by Vanilla M. Repairs. ; : Fumiko's editor, who receives little recognition for her hard work. She has a boyfriend who she often has to cancel her dates with, in order to meet a manga deadline. However, in the anime, she complains that she broke up with her boyfriend due to the time they spend together in the \\"Summer Break\\" episodes.

The complex consists of three hydroelectric power plants. The first and most productive one is Ciunget, the second one is Malaia and the third one is Bradisor which, just as Ciunget is an underground power plant. The river which fills the dams is called Lotru. The first dam is called Vidra Lake and is one of the biggest artificial lakes in Romania. The dam supplies water to the Ciunget power plant via an 800-metre drop underground pipe. All the used water is recollected via an underground piping system and flows to the Malaia dam where is the second power plant. Malaia dam is a smaller dam and produces less electricity, mainly locally. From the second dam, the used water collects into the Bradisor dam. The Bradisor dam has a bigger capability of producing electricity than the Malaia dam and provides electricity to the Romanian national grid. Bradisor power plant is situated under a mountain in order to make the fall of water greater, thus more electricity. The project was started in 1965, being fully finished only in 1982 and it was made up by the construction of a rockfill with a clay core dam 140 m high and an underground power plant equipped with three hydrounits, having an installed capacity of 510 MW. The Pelton type turbines operate under a net head of about 800 m. A 220 kV outdoor substation connects the plant to the Romanian electric grid. The Ciunget hydro power plant entered revision and modernisation in 2007. This includes new generators to increase the electricity outflow. The modernisation period is expected to be finished in late 2010. The power plant generates 1.15 TW¬∑h (billion kW¬∑h) of electricity per year.

It was the 98th short in the Mickey Mouse film series to be released, and the ninth for that year. This short marked the first use of one of Goofy's catchphrases, \\"Somethin' wrong here!\\". Plot The Ajax Ghost Exterminators - Mickey, Donald and Goofy - are hired by telephone to drive out four ghosts from a haunted house that has long been abandoned. Unbeknownst to them, however, they were called by the ghosts themselves, who are bored because nobody has visited the house since they had been haunting for a long time (either because none of the locals were scared or they had scared them all away, as one ghost puts it: \\"Guess we're too good!\\"). They wish to play tricks on the living, and do so through a series of inventive, annoying pranks. The exterminators arrive and knock on the front door, which falls down. When they announce themselves, there is nobody to receive them. Mickey decides they should get to work anyway. When entering, the door lifts up and throws them inside before putting itself back in place, making a rat trap fall shut on Goofy's nose. After hearing the ghosts' laughter, the three split up to hunt the ghosts individually. The exterminators are toyed with at every turn; a ghost knocks Mickey on the head and puts its fingers in both barrels of his shotgun when he tries to shoot it and it explodes. Mickey is driven upstairs and tries to open a door that the ghost disappears into, which falls down and the ghosts (forming a marching band) come out of the fallen door and go into another. Mickey opens the door, which causes water to poor out of it while the ghosts surf across it on surfboards. The last one comes out on a motorboat that goes in a circle around Mickey until it and the water disappear altogether. Donald, meanwhile, is whacked in the rear with a wooden board and is scared away by the sounds of banging chains and dishes. He punches the ghost, but it resurfaces and blows water in his face. Goofy runs into a bedroom at the sound of a ghost banging a wooden spoon on a pan. He soon becomes tangled in a dresser after seeing a ghost in a mirror instead of his own reflection and stabs his own rear with a pin, mistaking his blue pants for a ghost and is shoved down into the basement. In the end, the three exterminators crash into some molasses and flour, making them look like ghosts and consequently, they scare the actual ghosts out of the house in a panic. The ghost hunters stand victorious, having driven the spirits out of the house, although not exactly certain how. Donald smugly assumes the ghosts fled in capitulation to their superior tactics, calling them sissies and laughing.

An endling is the last known individual of a species or subspecies. Once the endling dies, the species becomes extinct. The word was coined in correspondence in the scientific journal Nature. Alternative names put forth for the last individual of its kind include ender and terminarch. The word relict may also be used, but usually refers to a population, rather than an individual, that is the last of a species. Usage The 4 April 1996 issue of Nature published a correspondence in which commentators suggested that a new word, endling, be adopted to denote the last individual of a species. The 23 May issue of Nature published several counter-suggestions, including ender, terminarch, and relict. The word endling appeared on the walls of the National Museum of Australia in Tangled Destinies, a 2001 exhibition by Matt Kirchman and Scott Guerin, about the relationship between Australian peoples and their land. In the exhibition, the definition, as it appeared in Nature, was printed in large letters on the wall above two specimens of the extinct Tasmanian tiger: \\"Endling (n.) The last surviving individual of a species of animal or plant\\". A printed description of this exhibition offered a similar definition, omitting reference to plants: \\"An endling is the name given to an animal that is the last of its species.\\" In The flight of the emu: a hundred years of Australian ornithology 1901-2001, author Libby Robin states that \\"the very last individual of a species\\" is \\"what scientists refer to as an 'endling'\\". In 2011, the word was used in the Earth Island Journal, in an essay by Eric Freedman entitled \\"Extinction Is Forever: A Quest for the Last Known Survivors\\". Freedman defined endling as \\"the last known specimen of her species.\\" In The sense of an endling, author Helen Lewis describes the notion of an endling as poignant, and the word as \\"wonderfully Tolkien-esque\\". In Cut from history, author Eric Freedman describes endling as \\"a word with finality.\\" He opines, \\"It is deep-to-the- bone chilling to know the exact date a species disappeared from Earth. It is even more ghastly to look upon the place where it happened and know that nobody knew or cared at the time what had transpired and why.\\" Notable endlings Martha, the last passenger pigeon, died in the Cincinnati Zoo in 1914 This is not a comprehensive list of contemporary extinction, but a list of high-profile, widely publicised examples of when the last individual of a species was known.  Birds  A dusky seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus nigrescens), officially declared extinct in 1990. * The last known great auks (Pinguinus impennis) were killed in 1844 for specimen collectors, after many centuries of exploitation for meat, eggs and oil for burning. A disputed sighting in 1852 has also been debated. * The passenger pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius) became extinct on 1 September 1914 with the death of Martha at the Cincinnati Zoo. Once hugely abundant, millions of other passenger pigeons were eradicated by hunting. * Incas, the last known Carolina parakeet (Conuropsis carolinensis), died, also at the Cincinnati Zoo, on 21 February 1918. * Booming Ben, a solitary heath hen (Tympanuchus cupido cupido), was last seen 11 March 1932 on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. * Orange Band was the last known dusky seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritumus nigrescens) who died on 17 June 1987 at the Discovery Island zoological park at Walt Disney World Resort. * The Kaua ªi  ª≈ç ª≈ç (Moho braccatus) was last seen in 1985, and last heard in 1987 when it was recorded by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. The death of the  ª≈ç ª≈ç endling represented the extinction of not only a species, but the genus Moho, and the family Mohoidae. * The last confirmed American ivory-billed woodpecker, a female, vanished by 1944, though there have been possible sightings of the bird in later years such as 1967, 1999, 2004, 2005, and 2006. Erratum Those sightings have left the question of its survival up for debate. The Cuban ivory-billed woodpecker has not been seen since 1987. * By mid-1997, only 3 confirmed individuals of the Po'ouli remained. One died in 2004, and the other 2 have been missing since 2003 and 2004. *The last survivor of the rufous-fronted laughingthrush subspecies Garrulax rufifrons slamatensis is a female in a rescue station on Java. *Only 1‚Äì2 Bahama nuthatches (Sitta insularis) may survive in the forests of Grand Bahama Island; a 2018 search produced several sightings, but no more than 1 or possibly 2 individuals were seen at once, and they might have been killed by Hurricane Dorian.https://us.blastingnews.com/lifestyle/2019/09/hurricane- dorian-might-have-wiped-out-the-critically-endangered-bahama- nuthatch-002977549.html  Mammals  * In 1627, the last aurochs, an ancestor of bovine and cattle, died in a forest near what is now Jaktor√≥w in modern-day Poland. * The quagga (Equus quagga quagga) became extinct in the wild in the late 1870s due to hunting for meat and skins, and the subspecies' endling died in captivity on 12 August 1883 at the Artis in Amsterdam. * The tarpan became extinct when the last one died in captivity in 1909. * On 7 September 1936, Benjamin, the last known Tasmanian tiger (Thylacinus cynocephalus) died in Hobart Zoo, after the species was hunted to extinction by farmers. It has been suggested Benjamin died of neglect during a night of unusually extreme weather conditions in Tasmania. Benjamin was not only the last individual thylacine, but the last individual of the genus Thylacinus and even of the entire family Thylacinidae. * Celia, the last Pyrenean ibex (Capra pyrenaica pyrenaica), was found dead on 6 January 2000 in the Spanish Pyrenees, after hunting and competition from livestock reduced the population to one individual. The species was successfully cloned back from extinction by scientists in 2003; however, the clone only lived for seven minutes due to lung failure. *Najin and her daughter Fatu at Ol Pejeta Conservancy are the last two individuals of the northern white rhinoceros. * Approximately 10 vaquita specimens are the relict of their species. Lonesome George, the last Pinta Island tortoise  Reptiles and amphibians  * The last known golden toad was seen in 1989. * On 24 June 2012, Lonesome George, who was the last known Pinta Island tortoise (Chelonoidis abingdonii), died in his habitat in the Gal√°pagos Islands. * Until September 26, 2016, the Atlanta Botanical Garden was home to the last known surviving Rabbs' fringe-limbed treefrog (Ecnomiohyla rabborum) named Toughie. It is believed that the species became extinct in the wild mainly because of an epizootic of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis in its native range. *The relict of Panamanian golden frogs were taken into captivity in 2006 to prevent their deaths from Chytridiomycosis infection. *The Cochabamba Natural History Museum has Romeo, who until 2019 was believed to be likely the last Sehuencas water frog. The confirmed population now consists of 6 individuals. 'Toughie', the last known Rabb's fringe-limbed treefrog. *After being considered possibly extinct for 113 years, a Fernandina Island Gal√°pagos tortoise was found in 2019. However, this female is the only confirmed individual. *All that is confirmed to remain of the Yangtze giant softshell turtle is a captive male in China and 2 wild individuals in Vietnam of unknown sexes.  Invertebrates  * Turgi was the last Partula turgida, a Polynesian tree snail, who died on 31 January 1996 in the London Zoo. * A tank in the Bristol Zoo was the last refuge of Partula faba, a land snail from Ra'iƒÅtea in French Polynesia. The population dropped from 38 in 2012Five of the world's 10 most at-risk species at Bristol Zoo to one in 2015. The last individual died on 21 February 2016. * George was the last known individual of the Oahu tree snail species Achatinella apexfulva. It died on January 1, 2019, in captivity near Kailua, Oahu.Ed Yong (2019) \\"The Last of Its Kind\\" The Atlantic, July 2019. Accessed June 28, 2019.

Function  Endothelin receptor type B is a G protein-coupled receptor which activates a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system. Its ligand, endothelin, consists of a family of three potent vasoactive peptides: ET1, ET2, and ET3. A splice variant, named SVR, has been described; the sequence of the ETB-SVR receptor is identical to ETRB except for the intracellular C-terminal domain. While both splice variants bind ET1, they exhibit different responses upon binding which suggests that they may be functionally distinct.  Regulation  In melanocytic cells the EDNRB gene is regulated by the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor. Mutations in either gene are links to Waardenburg syndrome.  Clinical significance  The multigenic disorder, Hirschsprung disease type 2, is due to mutation in endothelin receptor type B gene.  Animals  In horses, a mutation in the middle of the EDNRB gene, Ile118Lys, when homozygous, causes Lethal White Syndrome. In this mutation, a mismatch in the DNA replication causes lysine to be made instead of isoleucine. The resulting EDNRB protein is unable to fulfill its role in the development of the embryo, limiting the migration of the melanocyte and enteric neuron precursors. A single copy of the EDNRB mutation, the heterozygous state, produces an identifiable and completely benign spotted coat color called frame overo.

The four baskets of research focus are: *Policy Studies, Public Management and Governance *Social Policy *International Relations and Global Governance *Economic Development and Competitiveness The LKY School has four research centres, providing research on the latest developments in public policy. These are: Asia Competitiveness Institute The Asia Competitiveness Institute (ACI) was established in 2006 to build the intellectual leadership and network for understanding and developing competitiveness in the ASEAN region. ACI seeks to contribute to the enhancement of economic growth and living standards in the region. It serves as a regional repository of competitiveness information that enables analyses of long-term trends in economic policies and development. It conducts research to understand patterns of policy and economic development, and develops models that are applicable to different contexts. It also undertakes projects to assess current competitiveness of key economic clusters and provide policy inputs for enhancing growth. The ACI is an affiliated institute of the Institute for Strategy and Competitiveness at Harvard University. Centre on Asia and Globalisation The Centre on Asia and Globalisation (CAG) was established in 2006 to analyse the management of global issues and Asia's role in a rapidly changing and integrating world. Within this broad context, CAG has mapped out two initial areas of research: the mechanisms of global governance, and energy governance. The Centre's research on global governance investigates a variety of innovative approaches to managing global issues, including: transparency and information; the public roles of the private sector; and inter-governmental organisations. The energy governance programme examines the policies and institutions needed to bring about a shift to a more effective, efficient, and sustainable global energy system, with a focus on the role of Asia in shaping globalisation forces. Institute of Policy Studies The Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) is a think-tank dedicated to fostering good governance in Singapore through strategic policy research. It focuses on Singapore's domestic developments and external relations taking a multidisciplinary approach with an emphasis on long-term strategic thinking. Established in 1988, IPS became an institute within the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in 2008. Institute of Water Policy The Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy established the Institute of Water Policy in June 2008 in partnership with the Singapore Public Utilities Board (PUB) and receives funding from the PUB and Singapore's Tote Board. The Institute's research is also funded by many local partners including Sembcorp and Temasek Foundation; local and international government agencies such the National Environment Agency (NEA) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA); and international organisations such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The mission of the Institute is to enhance understanding of the social and economic dimensions of water governance and contribute to improved water management in Asia. IWP undertakes independent research and engages in institutional and corporate partnerships to influence the discourse on water governance issues and make a difference in water governance and management. IWP brings together a diverse group of scholars from various disciplines across the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. Amongst them, Visiting Professor Asit Biswas, founder of the Third World Centre for Water Management in Mexico and recipient of the 2006 Stockholm Water Prize; and Michael Howlett, editor-in-chief of Policy Sciences journal. School publications The LKY School publishes a number of research papers, journals and books. Two flagship publications are: * Policy and Society * Global-is-Asian Policy and Society Policy and Society is sponsored by LKY School and edited by its faculty members Professors Michael Howlett and M Ramesh along with Professors Giliberto Capano (University of Bologna) and Darryl Jarvis (Hong Kong Institute of Education). It is a SSCI- listed journal that ranks 9th on the SCImago Journal Rankings (SJR Indicator) in the field of Public Administration. Global-is-Asian 'Global-is-Asian' is the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (LKYSPP)'s flagship digital platform focusing on policy issues affecting Asia and the world. Backed by research and grounded in practitioners' experience, our content aims to shape global thinking and steer meaningful conversations on Asian policy issues, especially among policymakers and fellow academics. Distinguished Speakers Series David Cameron, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, speaking at the School in July 2015 LKY School hosts conferences and lectures for its students as well as the wider public. Visitors who have spoken at the School include former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, former Australia Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, Pulitzer prize-winning author Thomas Friedman, Nobel laureates Elinor Ostrom, Amartya Sen, Muhammad Yunus, Aung San Suu Kyi, and former US Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. In 2019, the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy organised the ‚ÄòAsia Thinker Series‚Äô, a series of thought leadership events. These series of forums involving academic experts, policymakers and business leaders from Asia, focuses on key contemporary public policy issues and the emerging challenges of Asia's influence in the world. The inaugural ‚ÄòAsia Thinker Series‚Äô took place in Jakarta discussing about the topic, ‚ÄúIndonesia in the Global Trade War: Impacts on Business, Global Trade and Investment‚Äù. The topic of the second forum in Bangkok revolved around the topic, \\"ASEAN and the New World Disorder: Thailand, seeking a new balance\\". The third ‚ÄòAsia Thinker Series‚Äô forum will be held in Delhi, India in November 2019.

Campus The LKY School is situated at the Bukit Timah campus together with the NUS Law Faculty, next to the Singapore Botanic Gardens. It is based primarily in the Manasseh Meyer and Oei Tiong Ham buildings. The NUS Bukit Timah campus was built in the 1920s in order to facilitate the Raffles College, and later served as headquarters of Japanese Army during the Japanese occupation. The site became the campus for the Singapore Division of University of Malaya in 1949, then The University of Singapore in 1962, and the merged National University of Singapore (NUS) in 1980. After NUS moved its campus to Kent Ridge, the site served as the campus of the National Institute of Education and Singapore Management University (SMU), respectively. After SMU moved into their permanent campus at Bras Basah in 2005, the campus was returned to NUS, and became the campus for NUS Law School and the LKY School in the following year.

PBS will celebrate its 40th year of broadcast in 2019. PBS is a specialist contemporary music radio station hosting approximately 79 programmes per week. The key to its musical diversity is that, as volunteers, PBS announcers independently choose their own content according to genre or theme. Volunteer efforts are both behind the scenes and on air. The PBS vision is to nurture, inspire and champion Melbourne's diverse music community. The station dropped the \\"3\\" from its callsign before the turn of the century, preferring in the age of internet streaming and digital radio to be known as just PBS, PBS-FM, or PBS 106.7FM. The co-operative holds a Community class licence, and raises funds largely through paid annual membership, supplemented by on-air sponsorship, live music events and other activities relevant to the music community in Melbourne. Shareholding members of the co-operative elect a Board of Directors that employs a Station Manager to be responsible for all aspects of the station's operations, encompassing more than 400 dedicated volunteers and a small team of professional staff. Programming is determined by a committee chaired by a Board member who oversees the process. The committee includes the Station Manager, Program Manager and seven co-ordinators who are specialists in their respective genres. They are tasked with ensuring that the best announcers and programs are chosen to serve an active music community, complementing what mainstream radio offers. In 2019, PBS 106.7FM was inducted into the Music Victoria Hall of Fame. History During 1975 Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) student campus station 3ST applied to the Broadcasting Control Board for a restricted commercial AM licence. The application was done under the name of the SRNA, with 3ST, 3CT, 3MU and newly formed 3SW (Swinburne University). The application was unsuccessful and the licence went to 3CR. In 1976 Felix Hofmann, who had no affiliation with any broadcasting radio station, called a meeting of interested parties to establish an FM radio station for \\"progressive music\\". It was not practical to hold this meeting at his parents‚Äô home in St Kilda East so it was held at 1 Baldwin Street, Armadale a student household that included Rosalie Brookes and Garry Page. To publicise the meeting Felix Hofmann used a press story in \\"The Southern Cross\\" newspaper and an advertisement in \\"The Toorak Times\\" newspaper; while Garry Page, as a former member of 3ST, extended personal invitations to other 3ST members such as John Maizels and Barry Bron and also posted notices at the 3CR and 3ST studios. Given his knowledge of the industry and radio licensing process the elected chairman was John Maizels, Technical Manager at 3ST (and son of noted broadcaster Monty Maizels) and co-host of the 'John and Paul Show' on 3ST (with Paul Cuthbert). Although not a member of 3CR, but given his expertise, John Maizels was one of the announcers on 3CR's first test transmission on 1 May 1976. Felix Hofmann was elected vice-chairman and ensured the vision of a progressive music service was not lost. Early active members also included Maria McGuane, David Stubbs, Rosalie Brookes, Alan Quirk, Sally-Ann Rozario and Lee Traynor. Also during this early period of 3PBS, enthusiasts who had an interest in microprocessors from Intel, Motorola, Signetics 2650, Fairchild F8, etc. were meeting at the Clayton campus of Monash University, Graham Thirkell's Optro premises and went on to form the Microcomputer Club of Melbourne (MICOM). Peter Jetson, who was to play a significant role in 3PBS plus MICOM, and Garry Page, a broadcast technical officer who was employed by the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) to perform studio maintenance, were both members of MICOM. Rosalie Brookes facilitated the meeting when the 'Progressive Broadcasting Service' name was adopted. Subsequently, membership cards were printed for the unincorporated 3PBS group with the first memberships to John Maizels, Felix Hofmann and Garry Page. As the initial meeting was about 400 metres from the 3CR radio station in High Street, Armadale there were a significant number of curious 3CR members in attendance. Although names and addresses were recorded and used for initial mailouts, the vast majority of 3CR members were not seen at subsequent meetings, did not pay memberships or become active members of 3PBS. Garry Page managed the membership records on his account on the Control Data Corporation (CDC) Cyber 6000 series mainframe computer system at St Kilda Road. For convenience, the initial 3PBS mailing address was a post box in Armadale. The 3PBS membership records were later transferred by John Maizels to an IBM mainframe after some difficulty with a magnetic tape formatted on the CDC system using packed BCD that had to be converted into EBCIDIC for the IBM mainframe. Subsequently, the 3PBS postal address was moved from Armadale. Therefore, 3PBS could claim the first use of computer-based membership records by an Australian public radio broadcaster. Soon after the 3PBS group was established meetings moved to John Maizels home in Port Melbourne. 3PBS membership was drawn from ABC, 3ST, unaffiliated public and some 3CR members. It is a myth that 3PBS was an early splinter group of 3CR headed by John Maizels. The group registered as the Progressive Broadcasting Service Co- operative Limited at a meeting at Ken Fargher's upstairs room, Peel Street, North Melbourne. 3PBS test transmissions from a low power FM transmitter located on the BHP Building, corner of Bourke and William Streets in the Melbourne CBD occurred from a studio at John Maizels' Port Melbourne home in 1977 and 1978. Reception reports were received from listeners throughout Melbourne's extended metropolitan area. In August 1978 the station was successful in its application to the Australian Broadcasting Authority for a licence and subsequently began a series of short broadcasts from temporary studios. The fledgling station started to make regular broadcasts to inner Melbourne in the early 1980s on 107.7 MHz from its studios at the Prince of Wales Hotel and a 200W transmitter on the old Royal Women's Hospital site in Carlton. The first programme was presented by David Stubbs at 4:30pm on 21 December 1979, and the first track broadcast was I'll Be Gone (Someday I'll Have Money) by Spectrum. David Stubbs selection of I'll Be Gone was significant for Melbourne radio as it had been the final rock track played on the formerly top rating, commercial station 3AK 3AK#1970s-1980s when it had changed from a Rock/Pop format. Initially, PBS-FM's broadcast hours were restricted to exclude daytime on weekdays with Melbourne University claiming interference from the nearby transmitter. The station moved from the Prince of Wales Hotel in St Kilda up Acland Street to the Park Lake building in 1985. From there it began broadcasting 24 hours a day to greater Melbourne in late 1987, only becoming possible with the transmitter relocating to Mt. Dandenong on the new frequency of 106.7 MHz. The official frequency changeover took place on 16 November 1987. In 2001 the station moved again, this time to its current location in Easey Street Collingwood with the first transmission from the new premises on 27 November 2001. Magazine Separate from internal newsletters (Ripples and Unreal News), PBS has produced several magazines for financial members and the public during its history. The first was Waves from 1977 until it was discontinued in March 1988. Static emerged as a short-lived replacement in 1989, of which there were only three issues leading up to the station's 10th Anniversary; Issue Minus 3 (July 1989), Minus 2 (Oct 1989) and Minus 1 (Dec 1989). Largely for financial reasons, there was hiatus until late 2002 when a single issue of Over Easey appeared. Subsequently, this was renamed Easey magazine in 2003, initially published every three months. Easey magazine is still the official PBS print magazine, and is now posted out to all PBS Members twice a year. Mick Geyer Award Mick Geyer was a broadcaster and journalist in the alternative Melbourne music scene in the 1980s and 1990s. His influence was widespread, but remained largely outside the public view. In honour of his legacy as a fierce campaigner for the role of alternative and community radio (and PBS in particular), this occasional award was introduced by PBS in 2012 to acknowledge enormous contributions to the station and its community. The recipients to date are; Peter Merrett (2012), Mike Glover (2013), David Heard (2014), Helen Jennings (2015), John Carver (2016), Jan Dale (2017), Maddy MacFarlane (2018), Pierre Baroni (2019).

He sits down at a computer terminal and pulls up the first video. After the first video, he remembers that something might be in the room. He pulls a cloth off an exhibit, which is Jagger in suspended animation, wearing a c.1973 stage outfit. Wyman wakes Jagger up and they go through the exhibit, \\"playing\\" videos on such things as a microwave oven and an old TV, but mostly on Wyman's stylized computer, making pithy comments all throughout. The piece ends with real museum guards crashing through the locked door and carrying Wyman off, Jagger still in the exhibit glass. The image fades to Wyman being woken up by Jagger backstage, as it's time to go on. However, Wyman now has an MBE on his jacket.

It is an example of professional ethics. Accounting was introduced by Luca Pacioli, and later expanded by government groups, professional organizations, and independent companies. Ethics are taught in accounting courses at higher education institutions as well as by companies training accountants and auditors. Due to the many range of accounting services and recent corporate collapses, attention has been drawn to ethical standards accepted within the accounting profession. These collapses have resulted in a widespread disregard for the reputation of the accounting profession. To combat the criticism and prevent fraudulent accounting, various accounting organizations and governments have developed regulations and remedies for improved ethics among the accounting profession. Importance of ethics The nature of the work carried out by accountants and auditors requires a high level of ethics. Shareholders, potential shareholders, and other users of the financial statements rely heavily on the yearly financial statements of a company as they can use this information to make an informed of the decision about investment. They rely on the opinion of the accountants who prepared the statements, as well as the auditors that verified it, to present a true and fair view of the company. Knowledge of ethics can help accountants and auditors to overcome ethical dilemmas, allowing for the right choice that, although it may not benefit the company, will benefit the public who relies on the accountant/auditor's reporting. Most countries have differing focuses on enforcing accounting laws. In Germany, accounting legislation is governed by \\"tax law\\"; in Sweden, by \\"accounting law\\"; and in the United Kingdom, by the \\"company law\\". In addition, countries have their own organizations which regulate accounting. For example, Sweden has the Bokf√∂ringsn√§mden (BFN - Accounting Standards Board), Spain the Instituto de Comtabilidad y Auditoria de Cuentas (ICAC), and the United States the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). History a 1495 portrait by an unknown Renaissance artist, wrote on accounting ethics in 1494. Luca Pacioli, the \\"Father of Accounting\\", wrote on accounting ethics in his first book , published in 1494. Ethical standards have since then been developed through government groups, professional organizations, and independent companies. These various groups have led accountants to follow several codes of ethics to perform their duties in a professional work environment. Accountants must follow the code of ethics set out by the professional body of which they are a member. United States accounting societies such as the Association of Government Accountants, Institute of Internal Auditors, and the National Association of Accountants all have codes of ethics, and many accountants are members of one or more of these societies. In 1887, the American Association of Public Accountants (AAPA) was created; it was the first step in developing professionalism in the United States accounting industry. By 1905, the AAPA's first ethical codes were formulated to educate its members. During its twentieth anniversary meeting in October 1907, ethics was a major topic of the conference among its members. As a result of discussions, a list of professional ethics was incorporated into the organization's bylaws. However, because membership to the organization was voluntary, the association could not require individuals to conform to the suggested behaviors. Other accounting organizations, such as the Illinois Institute of Accountants, also pursued discussion on the importance of ethics for the field. The AAPA was renamed several times throughout its history, before becoming the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) as it's named today. The AICPA developed five divisions of ethical principles that its members should follow: \\"independence, integrity, and objectivity\\"; \\"competence and technical standards\\"; \\"responsibilities to clients\\"; \\"responsibilities to colleagues\\"; as well as \\"other responsibilities and practices\\". Each of these divisions provided guidelines on how a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) should act as a professional. Failure to comply with the guidelines could have caused an accountant to be barred from practicing. When developing the ethical principles, the AICPA also considered how the profession would be viewed by those outside of the accounting industry. Teaching ethics Courses on this subject have grown significantly in the last couple of decades. Teaching accountants about ethics can involve role playing, lectures, case studies, guest lectures, as well as other mediums. Recent studies indicate that nearly all accounting textbooks touch on ethics in some way. In 1993, the first United States center that focused on the study of ethics in the accounting profession opened at Binghamton University. Starting in 1999, several U.S. states began requiring ethics classes prior to taking the CPA exam.\\"State Regulatory Accounting Ethics\\" retrieved April 26, 2012. In 1988, Stephen E. Loeb proposed that accounting ethics education should include seven goals (adapted from a list by Daniel Callahan). To implement these goals, he pointed out that accounting ethics could be taught throughout accounting curriculum or in an individual class tailored to the subject. Requiring it be taught throughout the curriculum would necessitate all accounting teachers to have knowledge on the subject (which may require training). A single course has issues as to where to include the course in a student's education (for example, before preliminary accounting classes or near the end of a student's degree requirements), whether there is enough material to cover in a semester class, and whether most universities have room in a four-year curriculum for a single class on the subject. There has been debate on whether ethics should be taught in a university setting. Supporters point out that ethics are important to the profession, and should be taught to accountants entering the field. In addition, the education would help to reinforce students' ethical values and inspire them to prevent others from making unethical decisions. Critics argue that an individual is ethical or not, and that teaching an ethics course would serve no purpose. Despite opposition, instruction on accounting ethics by universities and conferences, has been encouraged by professional organizations and accounting firms. The Accounting Education Change Commission (AECC) has called for students to \\"know and understand the ethics of the profession and be able to make value-based judgments.\\" Phillip G. Cottel argued that in order to uphold strong ethics, an accountant \\"must have a strong sense of values, the ability to reflect on a situation to determine the ethical implications, and a commitment to the well- being of others.\\" Iris Stuart recommends an ethics model consisting of four steps: the accountant must recognize that an ethical dilemma is occurring; identify the parties that would be interested in the outcome of the dilemma; determine alternatives and evaluate its effect on each alternative on the interested parties; and then select the best alternative. Accounting scandals Accounting ethics has been deemed difficult to control as accountants and auditors must consider the interest of the public (which relies on the information gathered in audits) while ensuring that they remained employed by the company they are auditing. They must consider how to best apply accounting standards even when faced with issues that could cause a company to face a significant loss or even be discontinued. Due to several accounting scandals within the profession, critics of accountants have stated that when asked by a client \\"what does two plus two equal?\\" the accountant would be likely to respond \\"what would you like it to be?\\". This thought process along with other criticisms of the profession's issues with conflict of interest, have led to various increased standards of professionalism while stressing ethics in the work environment. The role of accountants is critical to society. Accountants serve as financial reporters and intermediaries in the capital markets and owe their primary obligation to the public interest. The information they provide is crucial in aiding managers, investors and others in making critical economic decisions. Accordingly, ethical improprieties by accountants can be detrimental to society, resulting in distrust by the public and disruption of efficient capital market operations. From the 1980s to the present there have been multiple accounting scandals that were widely reported on by the media and resulted in fraud charges, bankruptcy protection requests, and the closure of companies and accounting firms. The scandals were the result of creative accounting, misleading financial analysis, as well as bribery. Various companies had issues with fraudulent accounting practices, including Nugan Hand Bank, Phar-Mor, WorldCom, and AIG. One of the most widely reported violation of accounting ethics involved Enron, a multinational company, that for several years had not shown a true or fair view of their financial statements. Their auditor Arthur Andersen, an accounting firm considered one of the \\"Big Five\\", signed off on the validity of the accounts despite the inaccuracies in the financial statements. When the unethical activities were reported, not only did Enron dissolve but Arthur Andersen also went out of business. Enron's shareholders lost $25 billion as a result of the company's bankruptcy. Although only a fraction of Arthur Anderson's employees were involved with the scandal, the closure of the firm resulted in the loss of 85,000 jobs. Causes Fraudulent accounting can arise from a variety of issues. These problems usually come to light eventually and could ruin not only the company but also the auditors for not discovering or revealing the misstatements. Several studies have proposed that a firm's corporate culture as well as the values it stresses may negatively alter an accountant's behavior. This environment could contribute to the degradation of ethical values that were learned from universities. Until 1977, ethics rules prevented accounting and auditing firms from advertising to clients. When the rules were lifted, spending by the largest CPA firms on advertisements rose from US$4 million in the 1980s to more than $100 million in the 2000s. Critics claimed that, by allowing the firms to advertise, the business side overstepped the professional side of the profession, which led to a conflict of interest. This focus allowed for occurrences of fraud, and caused the firms, according to Apj , \\"... to offer services that made them more consultants and business advisers than auditors.\\" As accounting firms became less interested in the lower-paying audits due to more focus on higher earning services such as consulting, problems arose. This disregard for the lack of time spent on audits resulted in a lack of attention to catching creative and fraudulent accounting. A 2007 article in Managerial Auditing Journal determined the top nine factors that contributed to ethical failures for accountants based on a survey of 66 members of the International Federation of Accountants. The factors include (in order of most significant): \\"self-interest, failure to maintain objectivity and independence, inappropriate professional judgment, lack of ethical sensitivity, improper leadership and ill-culture, failure to withstand advocacy threats, lack of competence, lack of organizational and peer support, and lack of professional body support.\\" The main factor, self-interest, is the motivation by an accountant to act in his/her best interest or when facing a conflict of interest. For example, if an auditor has an issue with an account he/she is auditing, but is receiving financial incentives to ignore these issues, the auditor may act unethically. =Principles and rules= The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are standards and interpretations developed by the International Accounting Standards Board, which are principle-based. IFRS are used by over 115 countries or areas including the European Union, Australia, and Hong Kong. The United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting, is largely rule-based. Critics have stated that the rules-based GAAP is partly responsible for the number of scandals that the United States has suffered. The principles-based approach to monitoring requires more professional judgment than the rules-based approach. There are many stakeholders in many countries such as The United States who report several concerns in the usage of rules-based accounting. According to recent studies, many believe that the principles-based approach in financial reporting would not only improve but would also support an auditor upon dealing with client‚Äôs pressure. As a result, financial reports could be viewed with fairness and transparency. When the U.S. switched to International accounting standards, they are composed that this would bring change. However, as a new chairperson of the SEC takes over the system, the transition brings a stronger review about the pros and cons of rules- based accounting. While the move towards international standards progresses, there are small amount of research that examines the effect of principle- based standards in an auditor‚Äôs decision- making process. According to 114 auditing experts, most are willing to allow clients to manage their net income based on rules- based standards. These results offers insight to the SEC, IASB and FASB in weighing the arguments in the debate of principles- vs. rules based- accounting. IFRS is based on \\"understandability, relevance, materiality, reliability, and comparability\\". Since IFRS has not been adopted by all countries, these practices do not make the international standards viable in the world domain. In particular, the United States has not yet conformed and still uses GAAP which makes comparing principles and rules difficult. In August 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed that the United States switch from GAAP to IFRS, starting in 2014. Responses to scandals Since the major accounting scandals, new reforms, regulations, and calls for increased higher education have been introduced to combat the dangers of unethical behavior. By educating accountants on ethics before entering the workforce, such as through higher education or initial training at companies, it is believed it will help to improve the credibility of the accounting profession. Companies and accounting organizations have expanded their assistance with educators by providing education materials to assist professors in educating students. New regulations in response to the scandals include the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 2004 in Australia as well as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, developed by the United States. Sarbanes-Oxley limits the level of work which can be carried out by accounting firms. In addition, the Act put a limit on the fee which a firm can receive from one client as a percentage of their total fees. This ensures that companies are not wholly reliant on one firm for its income, in the hope that they do not need to act unethically to keep a steady income. The act also protects whistleblowers and requires senior management in public companies to sign off on the accuracy of its company's accounting records. In 2002, the five members of the Public Oversight Board (POB), which oversaw ethics within the accounting profession, resigned after critics deemed the board ineffective and the SEC proposed developing a new panel, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). The PCAOB was developed through the Act, and replaced the POB. In 2003, the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) released a report entitled Rebuilding Public Confidence in Financial Reporting: An International Perspective. By studying the international company collapses as a result of accounting issues, it determined areas for improvement within organizations as well as recommendations for companies to develop more effective ethics codes. The report also recommended that companies pursue options that would improve training and support so accountants could better handle ethical dilemmas. A collaborative effort by members of the international financial regulatory community led by Michel Prada, Chairman of the French Financial Markets Authority, resulting in establishment of the Public Interest Oversight Board (PIOB) on 1 March 2005. The PIOB provides oversight of the IFAC standards-setting boards: the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB), the International Accounting Education Standards Board (IAESB) and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA). The most recent reform came into effect in July 2010 when President Obama signed \\"The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\\". The act covers a broad range of changes. The highlights of the legislation are consumer protections with authority and independence, ends too big to fail bail outs, advance warning system, transparency and accountability for exotic instruments, executive compensation and corporate governance, protects investors, and enforces regulations on the books.. The legislation also resulted in the Office of the Whistleblower, which was established to administer the SEC's whistleblower program. Congress authorized the SEC to provide monetary awards to whistleblowers who come forward with information that results in a minimum of a $1,000,000 sanction. The rewards are between 10% and 30% of the dollar amount collected.\\"Welcome to the Office of the Whistleblower.\\" U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (Home Page). Web. 31 Oct. 2011. . Whistleblowers help identify fraud and other unethical behaviors early on. The result is less harm to investors, quickly holding offenders responsible, and to maintain the integrity of the U.S. markets. References Further reading *Armstrong, Mary Beth.

He was awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize for physics \\"for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy\\", which he shared with Andrea Ghez and Roger Penrose. Life and career Genzel was born in Bad Homburg vor der H√∂he, Germany, the son of Eva-Maria Genzel and Ludwig Genzel, professor for solid state physics (1922‚Äì2003). He studied physics at the University of Freiburg and the University of Bonn where he did his PhD in 1978Curriculum-vitae , website of the Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr extraterrestrische Physik and, in the same year, his PhD thesis on radioastronomy at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy. He then worked at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was a Miller Fellow from 1980 until 1982, and also Associate and finally Full Professor in the Department of Physics at the University of California, Berkeley from 1981. In 1986, he left Berkeley to become a director at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching and Scientific Member of the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft. He also lectured at Ludwig- Maximilians-Universit√§t M√ºnchen, where he has been Honorary Professor since 1988. From 1999, he also had a part-time joint appointment as Full Professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Additional activities include sitting on the selection committee for the Shaw Prize in astronomy. Work Reinhard Genzel studies infrared- and submillimetre astronomy. He and his group are active in developing ground- and space-based instruments for astronomy. They used these to track the motions of stars at the centre of the Milky Way, around Sagittarius A*, and show that they were orbiting a very massive object, now known to be a black hole. Genzel is also active in studies of the formation and evolution of galaxies. In July 2018, Reinhard Genzel et al. reported that star S2 orbiting Sgr A* had been recorded at 7,650 km/s or 2.55% the speed of light leading up to the pericentre approach in May 2018 at about 120 AU ‚âà 1400 Schwarzschild radii from Sgr A*. This allowed them to test the redshift predicted by general relativity at relativistic velocities, finding additional confirmation of the theory.Star spotted speeding near black hole at centre of Milky Way ‚Äì Chile‚Äôs Very Large Telescope tracks S2 star as it reaches mind-boggling speeds by supermassive black hole, The Guardian, 26 July 2017 Awards * Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes, 1973‚Äì1975 * Miller Research Fellowship, 1980‚Äì1982 * Otto Hahn Medal, Max-Planck- Gesellschaft, 1980 * Presidential Young Investigator Award, National Science Foundation, 1984 * Newton Lacy Pierce Prize, American Astronomical Society, 1986 * Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, 1990 * De Vaucouleurs Medal, University of Texas, 2000 * Prix Jules Janssen, Soci√©t√© astronomique de France (French Astronomical Society), 2000 * Stern Gerlach Medal for experimental physics, Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft, 2003 * Balzan Prize for Infrared Astronomy, 2003 * Albert Einstein Medal, 2007The Awarding of the Einstein Medal: Albert Einstein Medal Laureates at Albert Einstein Medal website * Shaw Prize, 2008 * \\"Galileo 2000\\" Prize, 2009 * Karl Schwarzschild Medal, Deutsche Astronomische Gesellschaft, 2011 * Crafoord Prize, Royal Swedish Academy, 2012 * Tycho Brahe Prize, European Astronomical Society, 2012 * Pour le M√©rite, 2013 * Harvey Prize, Technion Institute, Israel, 2014Harvey Prize 2014 * Herschel Medal, Royal Astronomical Society, 2014 * Nobel Prize in Physics, 2020 Membership of scientific societies * Fellow of the American Physical Society, 1985 * Foreign member of the Acad√©mie des Sciences (Institut de France), 1998 * Foreign member of the United States National Academy of Sciences, 2000 * Member of the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina, 2002 * Senior member of the Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften, 2003 * Foreign member of the Royal Spanish Academy of Sciences, 2011 * Foreign member of the Royal Society of London, 2012 References External links * Genzel's Homepage at MPE * Genzel's Profile at the MPG * The Balzan-Stiftung award * Black Holes and Galaxies 27 July 2009 ‚Äì ANU podcast mp3 also available as video on youtube * Black Holes and Galaxies: Professor Reinhard Genzel ‚Äì ANU TV on youtube * 1952 births Albert Einstein Medal recipients Fellows of the American Physical Society Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences Foreign Members of the Royal Society German astrophysicists German Nobel laureates Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize winners Knights Commander of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany Living people Members of the French Academy of Sciences Nobel laureates in Physics Recipients of the Pour le M√©rite (civil class) Studienstiftung alumni University of Bonn alumni University of California, Berkeley faculty ","title":"Reinhard Genzel"},{"id":"14417061","text":"Gran√•sen is a ski jumping hill, located in Gran√•sen Ski Centre in Trondheim, Norway.

The series originally started serialization in MediaWorks' now-defunct light novel magazine Dengeki hp on June 18, 2004. The first novel was released in October 2004, and as of January 2012, 15 volumes have been published by ASCII Media Works under their Dengeki Bunko imprint. A manga adaptation by Yasuhiro Miyama was serialized in ASCII Media Works' Dengeki Moeoh between the October 2006 and August 2010 issues. An anime adaptation produced by Studio Barcelona aired between July and September 2008; a second anime season aired between October and December 2009. A visual novel for the PlayStation 2 was released in Japan in September 2008 and a second game for the PlayStation Portable was released for digital download in February 2010. Plot The story is set at Hakuj≈ç Academy, a private high school in Japan, and centers around Y≈´to Ayase and his classmate Haruka Nogizaka. While Y≈´to is rather ordinary, Haruka is very attractive, intelligent, and wealthy, making her the school's most unattainable girl who is idolized by her peers. One day, Y≈´to's good friend Nobunaga Asakura asks him to return a book to the school library, and when he goes to return it, Y≈´to stumbles across Haruka. It's then that he learns she's been keeping a secret for years‚Äîshe is a diehard fan of anime, manga, and the otaku culture. Y≈´to promises to keep his lips sealed, since Haruka's hobby is considered unworthy of her status, and the two become close friends and start spending much of their time together. Y≈´to does his best to help hide Haruka's hobby while further developing his relationship with her. Characters Main characters ; : :Y≈´to is an ordinary student in his second year of high school who attends Hakuj≈ç Academy, a private high school. Y≈´to lives with his parents and older sister, Ruko, though his parents are always working and, thus, are generally absent from home. He behaves bluntly and generally likes to be left alone. He has an average determination to study for school. One day, he stumbles across his classmate Haruka in the library and discovers her hidden secret‚Äîthat she is an otaku who loves everything anime and manga. He agrees to keep her secret and over time they become closer, arousing envy and jealousy in his classmates. Even though he and Haruka are close, he sometimes believes that since he is not wealthy he cannot officially be her boyfriend. Eventually he comes to realize that her family loves and accepts him (even Haruka's father). ; : :Haruka is Y≈´to's classmate. Due to her beauty and intelligence, she is idolized at school and regarded as the school's most unattainable girl, even known by the French nicknames Nuit √âtoile (The Night Star) and Lumi√®re du Clavier (The Piano's Light). She is very skilled at playing the piano and has won international competitions. She also has a gentle personality, is a natural airhead, and is quite clumsy. Her deeply hidden secret is that she is an otaku and loves anime and manga. In middle school, her secret was exposed and she was shunned because of it, even by her best friends. This experience caused her to become introverted while maintaining an outwardly happy persona. She transferred schools and kept her hobby a secret once she entered high school. When Y≈´to finds out about it, Haruka is relieved that he does not tell anyone or harass her about it and, over the course of the series, develops romantic feelings for him. She comes from a rich family and a privileged upbringing, so her interest in the otaku subculture is looked down upon due to her status in society, which is another reason why she keeps it a secret. Her interest in otaku culture stems from an encounter she had several years previously: having fled to a park after being scolded by her father, Haruka was cheered by a copy of the first issue of Innocent Smile given to her by a boy she met (later revealed to have been Y≈´to who was helping Nobunaga carry his haul of otaku merchandise home). While being very talented in several areas, she cannot draw well but does not realize it because she is too proud of her drawings for anyone to tell her directly. Classmates and teachers ; : :Nobunaga is Y≈´to's childhood friend of who attends the same private high school, although he is in a different class. He has a cheerful and openhearted personality, gets very good grades, and is considered a bish≈çnen by the female students. However, despite his good looks, he doesn't have a girlfriend because he is a hardcore otaku and not afraid to let others know. Because of his hobby he is intimately familiar with the layout of Akihabara and is a very well regarded frequent customer in various stores in Akihabara. Due to the number of purchases he has had over the years, he is known as \\"Kaiser\\" at the Animate store, and is one of three people in possession of a golden Animate card. A picture of him shaking hands with the manager of the caf√© where Haruka once worked part time, called \\"@Home ~Caf√©\\", is framed in gold with the caption \\"Welcome home, our greatest master\\". He is well aware of Y≈´to and Haruka's relationship despite their efforts to keep it hidden but thinks nothing of it. ; : :Yukari is the vice-homeroom teacher of Y≈´to's class and is an old friend of his sister, Ruko. As a consequence she spends a lot of time at the Ayase house, often drunk and making Y≈´to's home life difficult. Y≈´to refers to as the \\"sexual harassment teacher\\". She is constantly smiling and she enjoys teasing trouble makers. At school, she is in charge of teaching music. She is twenty-three years old, though refers to herself as \\"eternally seventeen\\", and is unmarried but always on the hunt for a boyfriend. There is a possibility that she is the rumored teacher who graduated from this same school and is famous in the music world as the Performer of the Sunset. ; : :Shiina is a girl who participated in the London Piano Contest with Haruka; Shiina placed second after Haruka who ranked first. She transfers into Y≈´to's class at school. Her hobbies include playing the piano and the martial art of naginatajutsu. She always has a positive, cheerful and sociable personality. This makes her transition as a transfer student very easy. She used to live in Otaru, Hokkaid≈ç, Japan, but does not speak much of those days. She shows an interest for Y≈´to as she believes there must be a reason why they constantly bump into each other. She states that one of the reasons she chose Y≈´to's school to transfer to is because of a famous teacher, who graduated from the school and was known as the Performer of the Sunset, and who is teaching at the school. ; : :Mai is a girl in Y≈´to's class. She generally has a quiet personality, though is vice- president of the naginatajutsu club. She is close friends with Shiina and Ry≈çko. She has a small role in the first season of the anime adaptation, but appears as a regular character in Purezza. ; : :Ry≈çko is a classmate and close friend of Shiina and Mai, and is often seen with them. As opposed to the quiet Mai, she is quite boisterous and hyperactive. She often refers to Shiina as \\"Shiina-cchi\\" and Y≈´to as \\"Ayase-cchi\\". She notices that Shiina feels something for Y≈´to, so she (and Mai) encourage her to go for him, perhaps oblivious to the fact that Y≈´to and Haruka only have eyes for one another. ; : (Nagai), (Takenami), (Ogawa) :Nagai, Takenami, and Ogawa are a group of male students in Y≈´to's class obsessed with girls. Everyone refers to them as the \\"three idiots\\" because they always get into idiotic discussions. These three wish for the same wishes every New Year, and get the same fortune slips that indicate terrible luck. ; : :T≈çka is a first year student at Y≈´to's school. She is known by the nickname Princess Blizzard at school because of her domineering and arrogant personality. She comes from a family (known as \\"The Ten≈çji of the West\\") whose wealth may rival that of Haruka's family, \\"The Nogizaka of the East\\". Y≈´to worked as her personal butler for a time to earn money for Haruka's Christmas present. After the head of the family died at age 147, she became the third in line to inherit the family fortune. Her stated ultimate goal is world conquest. She has a cameo in the first season of the anime adaptation. Nogizaka family ; : :Mika is Haruka's 14-year-old younger sister in her second year of junior high school. Her hobbies include playing the violin, playing squash, caring for wild pigs, and spying on her sister and Y≈´to. She has a personality that is the exact opposite of her sister's, who is na√Øve. She enjoys Y≈´to's company and she often calls him \\"Onii-san\\" (an affectionate word meaning older brother, brother-in-law, or a brother-like male figure). When Haruka is with Y≈´to, however, Mika likes to tease them. In contrast to her airhead older sister, Mika is very stable. Even at her young age, she is more knowledgeable about sex than Haruka in principle, although she does get shocked or stunned if exposed to H-rated material just like her sister. She shows some interest in Y≈´to after their date. She is deathly afraid of ghosts. She has been running for the student council president of her all girl school for two consecutive years. She is just as much as an idol as her sister at school and is known by the name Moonlight Strawberry. ; : :Gent≈ç is Haruka's and Mika's father. His last name is adopted from his wife's family. He is a loving parent who dotes on his daughters though his speech and conduct makes him seem like a member of the yakuza. He bought an entire island for Haruka's birthday. He is against Haruka hanging around Y≈´to so much (and he often draws his sword when he suspects Y≈´to is \\"doing something hanky-panky\\" with Haruka), though he does not mind having Y≈´to around when he is alone. He heads the family's private paramilitary strike force unit known as The Hell Hounds. ; : :Akiho is Haruka's and Mika's mother. Despite having given birth twice, she appears youthful and beautiful, so much so that Y≈´to originally thought she was Haruka's older sister or cousin when he first met her. She is the principal of a cooking school. She has a quiet and intellectual demeanor but has the strength to overcome her husband; in fact, she is referred to by Y≈´to and Mika as \\"The Nogizaka house's ultimate weapon\\". In contrast to her husband, she thinks it is good that Haruka and Y≈´to spend time together, and she likes to watch the development of their relationship by joining in on spying on them. However, she is very strict that Haruka keeps up on her studies. ; : :≈åki is Haruka's and Mika's grandfather on their mother's side. He has a sociable personality and is a goodhearted old man. Although he is retired from his original position as the president of the Nogizaka's organization and now acts as a consultant, he is still a very powerful man in the economic and political world. If he were to request it, all great leaders in the world would gather at one place for a high level conference within three hours. He has a shadow warrior named Heiz≈ç Sebastian, Hazuki Sakurazaka's grandfather. =Nogizaka family maids= The Nogizaka family maid team follows a ranking system. For some unspecified reason (and it seems that the Maid Team are too scared to discuss the topic with Y≈´to), the second highest ranking maid is missing. ; : :Hazuki is the head maid of the Nogizaka family. She is mainly in charge of looking after Haruka and Mika, particularly Haruka; Hazuki acts in the way of an older sister towards her. She is generally very reserved and expressionless, but sometimes speaks in bombshell announcements. Hazuki adores cute things and even has a collection of stuffed animals. She often appears out of nowhere holding a chainsaw, her preferred weapon. ; : :Nanami is the third-highest ranking maid of the Nogizaka family, and she occasionally helps Hazuki with her work, but is more commonly found alongside Mika helping and joining in on her spying missions. She has a friendly personality and smiles a lot, though also has a wicked tongue. She is often seen wearing sunglasses. Like Hazuki, she also often appears out of nowhere, though holding a large hammer that looks like a meat tenderizer for a weapon. She has a habit of driving extremely fast (she drives the family Rolls-Royce Phantom like a WRC driver, though she sometimes drives the other Nogizaka limousine). Haruka states that she is a great driver when one is in a hurry. ; : :Minamo is the fourth-highest ranking maid of the Nogizaka family and in charge of finances, legal, and public relations. Very calm and refined in demeanor, she easily commands attention and respect. She is practically second in command and becomes the head maid in case something happens to Hazuki. ; : :Maria is the fifth-highest ranking maid of the Nogizaka family. She does general work around the house, though she is mostly on the family medical treatment group. ; : :Koayu is the sixth-highest ranking maid of the Nogizaka family, and is the head chef. She is extremely shy, and does not appear often. ;, , : (Ayame), Momoko Ishikawa (Sara), Sayuri Yahagi (Juri) :Ayame, Sara, and Juri are three sisters who are all equally ranked the seventh-highest maids of the Nogizaka family. They are the chauffeurs to the family. The eldest sister Ayame flies an eight-passenger airplane (the Nogizaka business jet, the Winter Shogun), which is comfortable to ride. Sara, the middle sister, is very speedy when flying her plane, or driving her limousine, or her Harrier jump jet. Juri, the youngest sister, also flies a plane. ; : :Alistia, otherwise known as Alice, is the eight-highest ranking maid of the Nogizaka family, and is in charge of VIP security and sabotage. She looks like a grade school student, and is a blond Caucasian (most likely German, since she once utters \\"Bruder\\", which means \\"brother\\", when addressing Y≈´to). She rarely speaks in the novel (being not yet skilled in Japanese), and normally converses with others via an array of nods and head-shakes to express her meanings (while uttering \\"koku\\"). However, in the second series, she is revealed to have superb fighting skills with the attitude of a programmed hell-bent killer, as she was revealed by Hazuki to be the one in charge of VIP security and sabotage. She uses a spike- studded baseball bat, as well as spiked knuckles, as weapons. ; : :Rio is the ninth-highest ranking maid of the Nogizaka family and in charge of the chemistry department. ; : :Iwai is the tenth-highest ranking maid of the Nogizaka family and in charge of festivities. She also works as a real miko. Other characters ; : :Ruko (black hair, ponytail) is Y≈´to's older sister. She works as a private secretary to a company president. She is skilled in karate and is a 2-dan. She is a hard worker on the job, but she drinks a lot at home and is unable to do any housework which makes Y≈´to in charge of all the chores. She generally has a rough attitude and will often speak in a brutish manner. Since her parents are absent so often, Ruko takes up the position as head of the house with her brother. When they first met, Ruko was very pleased with Haruka, something Y≈´to regarded as unusual. She is a weapon fanatic and owns many magazines about weapons. She also has her personal favorite Japanese blade called Ruri Dokuro, which means lapis lazuli skull. Her battle skills are considered to be at the professional fighter level. This is demonstrated when she, along with Yukari, completely broke the Tenn≈çji's household security while looking for Y≈´to, when he had to stay one week for his butler part time job, just because they were hungry. ; : :Milan is a popular idol. Her posters and promotions for her song (which is the first anime adaptation's opening theme) are seen in the Comiket and in places around Akihabara. She is also working on the anime Nocturne Girls' School Lacrosse Club as a voice talent. She made Y≈´to her manager upon finding out her real manager was at the other end of Japan, and later tipped Y≈´to off as to Yayoi's true plans for Haruka. ; : :Yayoi is a talent agent who is Milan's manager and the organizer of an idol audition that Haruka was asked to participate in. The truth was, she really wanted Haruka to become an idol by any means necessary (the \\"idol audition\\" and the related processes all being fake, a ploy to draw Haruka in). Haruka was absolutely unaware of what Yayoi was planning. ; : :Nozomi is Yayoi's partner as a talent agent. She usually fetches Haruka from school to the \\"lesson\\". ; : :Shute is the son of a wealthy family that is doing business with the Nogizaka family. He is an arrogant young man who, unlike his father, looks down upon common people. His arrogance often leads him into trouble that ends up humiliating him. During Haruka's birthday, he bullies Y≈´to and brags about his multimillion-dollar gifts while belittling Y≈´to's gift. He ends up humiliated when he handles ≈åki Nogizaka by the collar of his shirt (not knowing who he is), and his father demands that he apologize to both him and Y≈´to in front of the distinguished crowd (Haruka ignored him anyway‚Äîshe had just greeted him out of courtesy). He is later sent by his father to work as a butler \\"to teach him the value of humility,\\" but to no avail. At the Year-End Maid and Butler Convention he earned punishment for himself for calling the assembled maids and butlers slaves and tools to people like him, stepping on the stuffed frog that Y≈´to had won for Alistia and subsequently spitting on her. ; : :Eri is one of Mika's friends and classmates. She is in the drama club together with Mika and is very passionate about it. She has a gentle and kind personality. Minor ; :Mahiro is Nobunaga's younger sister. She is referred by her brother as a hopeless person with a poor sense of direction. She views Nobunaga as an idiot older brother, though she does like Y≈´to. She dislikes her brother's otaku hobbies. She does not make an appearance in the anime. ; : (visual novel) :Keiji is Y≈´to's classmate; he is known as \\"mad dog\\".

Most projected Tate to be picked somewhere in the early to middle of the second round, and recognizing his value at pick 58, the Texans aggressively traded up to draft him. This is the only time in team history that the Texans have drafted a running back earlier than the third round. Houston Texans Tate had high expectations to help a Texans running game that was one of the worst in the league the previous season, but during the Texans pre-season opener in 2010, Tate broke his ankle and was placed on injured reserve (IR). Tate returned healthy for the 2011 season, but was initially placed fourth on the depth chart behind 2010 NFL rushing champion Arian Foster, Derrick Ward, and Steve Slaton. At the conclusion of the preseason, Tate was listed as the opening-day backup to Ward due to a hamstring injury to Foster. In his NFL debut, Tate did not disappoint, rushing for 116 yards and his first NFL touchdown on 24 carries. He followed that performance the following week against the Miami Dolphins with another 100-yard game, finishing with 103 yards on 23 carries. He finished the 2011 regular season with 942 rushing yards on 175 attempts (a 5.4 yards-per-carry average, third-highest in the NFL) with 4 rushing touchdowns and 98 total receiving yards in 15 games played, two of which he started (Week 3 against the New Orleans Saints, and week 17 against the Tennessee Titans). Tate ran for 115 yards against the Cleveland Browns in Week 9 while Arian Foster ran for 124 yards in the same contest, leading the Texans to 261 yards on the ground, a franchise record.Browns vs. Texans, SI.com NFL Game Recap November 6, 2011 Tate played in 11 games in the 2012 season, amassing 279 rushing yards on 65 carries, averaging 4.3 yards per carry. While his per-carry average remained formidable, his carries were limited due to a competitive Houston Texans' backfield along with lingering injuries to his hamstring and foot. It was a frustrating season for the young running back, who had been competing with emerging running back Justin Forsett for backup duties to Arian Foster. In 2013, Tate appeared in 14 games with the Texans, making 7 starts, after a season-ending injury to Arian Foster. Tate responded by rushing for 771 yards and 4 touchdowns, 3 of which came in a Week 13 game against the New England Patriots where he rushed for a season-high 102 yards.

However, after playing only three games with the team, accumulating 38 rushing yards off of 13 attempts, the Vikings released Tate on December 25, 2014. Pittsburgh Steelers In the lead up to the 2014 NFL playoffs, the Pittsburgh Steelers lost Le'Veon Bell to injury. With no experienced running backs, they signed the newly released Tate on December 30, 2014. In the Wild Card loss against the Baltimore Ravens, Tate had five carries for 19 yards. Tate participated in The Spring League in 2017.

At the time, the most widespread form was RDT over the telephone network. Other transmission media like radio waves or light were also used. Most RDT now uses the Internet. In German speaking areas, RDT is used in the special sense of the considerably more narrowly defined Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). Systems for remote administration of facilities and remote control adjustments may use remote data transmission standards. To be transmittable, data must be appropriately prepared for the medium. For this, special hardware, e.g., a modem or an ISDN card is necessary.  History  When remote data transmission began, data were exchanged by the use of diskettes, magnetic tape, punched tape and dispatched via courier (the so- called sneaker net). In the beginning, electronic remote data transmission was also accomplished through special adapters on special data or telex lines, teleprinter, serial ports, and analog telephone] or over simple radio connections. Acoustic couplers that could be attached to a normal telephone handset, and later modems, were used. RDT achieved great significance for private users at the end of the 1980s with the arrival of local and global bulletin board systems like FidoNet and CompuServe. Many of these systems later had internet access via computer gateways, but they were mostly discontinued by the end of the 1990s with the internet rise to dominance.

It was written by lead guitarist Pete Townshend. Background Townshend wrote the song during the summer of 1965, and the band recorded it consistently with his home demos. According to Townshend, the song \\"wasn't as good as this before I did it with Keith [Moon]. It's not my favourite one on the LP. It reminds me a bit of Sandie Shaw.\\" Chris Charlesworth calls the melody \\"attractive.\\" Charlesworth particularly highlights Moon's unusual drumming, in which Moon uses only his tom-toms during the verses and refrain and incorporates cymbals only for the bridge and the solo. Allmusic critic Richie Unterberger calls it one of the \\"highlights\\" of My Generation. But Steve Grantley and Alan G. Parker describe the song as being \\"so-so\\" and \\"pretty conventional.\\" But they too acknowledge the power of Moon's \\"intermittent controlled\\" drum patterns and remark that it contains a preview of some elements of later Who songs, such as Townshend's \\"tentative crash chords.\\" Who biographer John Atkins concurs that the song is rather conventional and describes it as a \\"straight pop song.\\" Nicky Hopkins joins the band on piano for the song, and author Mike Segretto claims that his \\"hyper piano runs contribute much amphetamine fuel to it. Segretto also believes that the \\"shuffling rhythm\\" was influenced by Martha and the Vandellas' \\"Heat Wave.\\" Segretto claims that like \\"The Kids Are Alright,\\" also from My Generation, \\"La-La-La-Lies\\" \\"transform[s] the romantic song into something defiant,\\" in this case by declaring that his love is strong enough to withstand the \\"slander of jealous parties.\\" In common with several songs off My Generation, a theme of \\"La-La-La-Lies\\" is the \\"illusion of identity.\\" Rolling Stone critic Dave Marsh called it \\"as personal as anything Pete Townshend ever wrote.\\" The lyrics criticize a friend who lies about the singer. This makes the song a little different than other similarly themed Who songs, as in many of the band's songs about lying their complaint is that someone is lying to them; in \\"La-La-La-Lies\\" the complaint is that someone is lying about them. Christopher Ketcham sees \\"La-La-La-Lies\\" as representing a related theme common to several Who songs: the difficulty of seeing \\"the other.\\" Ketcham sees this as also being a theme of Quadrophenia and songs such as \\"My Generation\\" and \\"Who Are You.\\" Single release In November 1966, the song was released in Britain as the fourth single from the My Generation album without the permission of The Who. This was done by the song's producer Shel Talmy, who owned the rights to the song, in the midst of his legal dispute with the band, in order to compete with the singles the band wanted to release. The single reached the Top 20 in Sweden, but did not chart in the United Kingdom. Charlesworth suggests that the song would have performed better on the chart had it not been competing with The Who's own \\"Happy Jack.\\" It was backed with \\"The Good's Gone\\".

Function  Ephrin receptors and their ligands, the ephrins, mediate numerous developmental processes, particularly in the nervous system. Based on their structures and sequence relationships, ephrins are divided into the ephrin-A (EFNA) class, which are anchored to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage, and the ephrin-B (EFNB) class, which are transmembrane proteins. The Eph family of receptors are divided into 2 groups based on the similarity of their extracellular domain sequences and their affinities for binding ephrin-A and ephrin-B ligands. Ephrin receptors make up the largest subgroup of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family. The protein encoded by this gene is a receptor for ephrin-B family members.  Animal studies  EphB2 is part of the NMDA signaling pathway and restoring expression rescues cognitive function in an animal model of Alzheimer's disease.

She was married to professor Hal Koch, an advocate of democracy as a continuing deliberation instead of the majority's rights over the minorities. She represented the Social Democrats in the Danish Parliament, Folketinget from 1947 ‚Äì 1968. In 1947, she was elected to the Folketing and three years later she became the first female Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs in the world and the third female minister in Denmark. She only held the office for six weeks, as Prime Minister Hans Hedtoft resigned 30 October 1950 over a dispute on the continued rationing of butter. When the Social Democrats returned to the power in 1953, she again was appointed Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs. She held office until 1966, when she was appointed new Minister of Culture. She held office until Hilmar Baunsgaard in 1968 replaced Jens Otto Krag as prime minister.  Personal life  Bodil Koch graduated from the University of Copenhagen with a master's degree in theology in 1929, the same year she married Hal Koch. Their fundamental beliefs combined the Evangelical-Lutheran view of Christianity with Socratic humanism. Both had a strong interest in traveling and science and working for the common good.Possing, Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon They were the icons of a whole generation after World War II searching for a new set of values.Hoffmann-Hansen They had five children, and during the 1930s Bodil Koch was a stay-at-home mother and the wife of Hal Koch. They challenged the traditional idea of the nuclear family, and eventually she saw the ideal family as two working adults and a number of children who all participated in cooking and debating.  Political engagement  Bodil Koch's engagement in political affairs took off during World War II with op-eds and articles in Danish newspapers and she gave speeches all over the country. In 1944, she and 8 other prominent women founded the grass root organization Folkevirke (The People's Work or National Commitment).Possing, 2007, pp. 84‚Äì113 The goal of Folkevirke was to mobilize and educate women about democracy on a local, regional, and national level. Women all over the country, from Copenhagen to rural areas in Jutland participated in study groups and gave speeches about the problems of the Danish society.Possing, 2007  Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs  Folkevirke became Bodil Koch's stepping stone to Folketinget. Now that she had been fighting for women to get into politics, she ran for office herself in the 1947 Folketing election. It came as a surprise to many that she as a female, an academic, and practicing Protestant from Copenhagen could be elected in a rural area Herning in Jutland. She became a member of the Danish Parliament for the Social Democrats in 1947, and three years later she became Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs from September until October 1950. The Social Democrats regained power in 1953, and she was Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs until 1966 and Minister Cultural Affairs from 1966 until 1968 during three different governments led by the Social Democratic party. As Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs, Bodil Koch implemented reforms of ecclesiastical legislation, and she was a fierce defendant of the freedom of preaching in the state church Danish National Church. She worked hard to modernize the church including the ordination of women. After her death her ideas and visions were incorporated the Danish Church Law of 1973.  A lady in her own right  Bodil Koch was highly respected for her work, also by her opponents in Folketinget, and her biographer Birgitte Possing, describes her as \\"a lady in her own right\\".Possing, 2007, p. 114 She was a great speaker, spontaneous, and very outspoken ‚Äî also in other political areas than her own. She was from time to time a thorn in the side of her own party, especially in the debate about foreign policy. She was just like Denmark in a foreign policy dilemma: Since 1864 when Denmark was defeated by the Germans the tradition had been that it was too small a country to focus only on military capacity, instead it had to concentrate on socio-economic gains internally. But now Denmark was a member of NATO and the alliance was in the middle of the Cold War. The policy of deterrence worked, but there was a fear in Denmark that the country would be deleted from the map if retaliation was automatically set in action.Possing, 2007, pp. 182‚Äì84 In 1949, she grudgingly voted with her party for Denmark's membership of NATO. In 1952 and 1955 she voted against the party line, first against foreign military forces in Denmark during peacetime and second against Western Germany's admission to NATO. She was against the Vietnam War and nuclear rearmament and agitated for an open debate about the relationship between the Eastern and Western blocks during the Cold War in the 1950s and 1960s. Koch became worldwide famous for the first time when she in 1958 publicly criticized the US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles during the NATO conference in Copenhagen, May 1958.Possing, 2007, p. 15 The last two years of her political career Koch was Minister of Cultural Affairs (1966-1968). Her influence on cultural affairs was less than on ecclesiastical affairs, but she had always been interested and knowledgeable about culture and literature.

As with the town, the castle's name derives from the diminutive plural of the Slovene word breg, 'riverbank', in reference to the nearby Sava and Krka rivers. History Ceiling frescoes of Chapel. North wall of Knights Hall. A wooden fortification was present at the site long before 1241, when Bre≈æice (then known as Gradi≈°ƒçe) was first mentioned. A castrum was first recorded in 1249; the predecessor of the current castle, it was probably built during the late 12th century, when Bre≈æice became the administrative and economic center of the Bishopric of Salzburg's holdings in the Lower Sava Valley. In addition to a garrison, the castle hosted a mint and judicial chambers. The castle was then known by the German name Rain, as was the surrounding settlement (also meaning 'riverbanks'). In 1479, the Bre≈æice area was caught up in a war between the Emperor Frederick III of Habsburg and Hungarian King Matthias Corvinus; the king's forces took the castle from the Bishopric of Salzburg and occupied it until a peace treaty was signed in 1491, at which point it was transferred to the Habsburgs. During the great peasant revolt of 1515, local Carniolan nobility appealed for help to the ban of Croatia, who dispatched a force under the knight Marko of Klisa. En route, the knight captured some 500 wives and children of the rebellious peasants and sold them into slavery in the Croatian Littoral. A force of 900 peasants subsequently gathered at Bre≈æice, awaiting Sir Marko, who burned down the town before retreating into the castle, which the enraged rebels then stormed, killing him and his retainers before burning it. Hall of Knights. The castle was under repair until 1528, when it again burned down. Due to the intensification of Turkish raids, the Habsburgs now began a rapid building program, intended to fortify the Border March. On 22 January 1529, emperor Ferdinand I approved an outlay of 3,000 florins for the construction of a new castle and the fortification of the town. Between 1530 and 1551, Italian master builders demolished the ruins of the old castle and erected the principal elements of the current structure, four defensive towers connected by double defensive walls. The architects included Julio Dispatio of Meran. In 1554/5 the prominent renaissance builders and brothers Andrea and Domenico del'Allio worked on the castle. An armorial stele built into the facade states that the work was finally completed by the tenure of the noble Franc Gall von Gallenstein in 1590. In addition to surviving Turkish raids, the castle was the only fortress in the Lower Sava Valley to withstand another peasants' revolt in 1573, led by Ilija Gregoriƒç. The corners towers were defended by three cannons each, preventing close action. Ceiling fresco, the great hall In the mid-17th century, the castle passed from the hands of the Gallensteins to the Croatian noble house of Frankopan. After the death of Julianna of Frankopan in 1694, her heirs sold it to count Ignatz Maria Attems, who furnished the castle with its current interior decorations, including extensive trompe-l'≈ìil frescoes. Images on the walls of the great hall trace the progression of architecture from antiquity through the renaissance, and the ceiling bears scenes from Greek and Roman mythology. In addition to filling in the moats, a terrace was built up beneath the south wing, making room for orchards and gardens. Around 1720 the west wing was remodeled, and a great staircase and chapel built, the walls of each being decorated by Styrian painter Franc Ignac Flurer between 1715 and 1732. The Attems had the castle re-roofed in the second half of the 18th century; the towers were given mansard roofs at the same time. The castle was significantly damaged by an earthquake that struck the town of Bre≈æice on January 29, 1917, during World War I, at which time the great hall served as a military hospital. The Counts Attems retained the estate until its nationalization in 1945, for a total tenure of 251 years. Current Immediately after the war, the castle was divided into apartments for 26 families. In 1949, the castle became the home of the Lower Sava Valley Museum. The museum's holdings began with its first director, Franjo Stiplov≈°ek, who brought them from Kr≈°ko (the Aumann collection); they were later expanded and divided into archeological, ethnological, and historical exhibitions (the last focusing on the peasant revolt). There is also a gallery focusing on foreign and domestic oil paintings. The castle is a frequent venue for cultural events, including concerts of the Bre≈æice Festival. The great hall is also a popular location for marriages. The castle's basement has been occupied by a wine cellar, the Castle Cellar (), since 1946.Grajska Klet site Less widely known is the use of the castle, especially the picturesque Knights Hall, as a location for filming a number of foreign films in the period just before the breakup of Yugoslavia. The best known among these are Jackie Chan's Armour of God (1986), followed by The Dirty Dozen: The Deadly Mission in 1987 and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead (1990). It is located at the south end of the town's main street. Hours are 8-14:30 weekdays, 10-14:00 Sundays and holidays. Architecture \\"Bowed\\" doorway The castle is an excellent example of a renaissance flatland fortification, and retains its trapezoidal 16th-century layout. Records suggest construction took place in three phases: between 1530 and 1550, the basic fortress took shape, with four corner towers connected by walls; between 1567 and 1579, when the east and west tracts were added; and finally, between 1586 and 1590 or 1601, the northern tract and arcaded inner passageways. The structure has two stories, as well as a basement carved out of bedrock. The castle once also possessed a moat and drawbridge, but although the drawbridge chains remain, both were removed after the course of the Sava River (which had filled the moat) moved away over the centuries. The characteristic bowed gateway is the symbol of the castle's wine cellar.

The right to freedom in Article 19 guarantees the freedom of speech and expression, as one of its six freedoms.Constitution of India-Part III Article 19 Fundamental Rights.  History The law in the current form finds its root in the Hate Speech Law Section 295(A) enacted by the British Administration in India. This act was brought about in the backdrop of a series of murders of Arya Samaj leaders who polemicized against Islam. This started in 1897 with the murder of Pandit Lekhram by a Muslim because he had written a book criticizing Islam. Koenraad Elst argues that \\"Section 295b was not instituted by Hindu society, but against it. It was imposed by the British on the Hindus in order to shield Islam from criticism\\". The murder series caught lime-light in December, 1926 after the murder of Swami Shraddhananda for the protection he gave to a family of converts from Islam to Hinduism in addition to writing Hindu Sangathan, Saviour of the Dying Race in 1926. Precedence to this law started even before this as in a case against Arya Samaj preacher Dharm Bir in 1915, ten Muslims were sentenced for rioting, but Dharm Bir was also charged under section 298 for \\"using offensive phrases and gestures (‚Ä¶) with the deliberate intention of wounding the religious feelings\\" of another community; and under Section 153, for \\"wantonly provoking the riot which subsequently occurred\\" and \\"a judge was brought in who could assure conviction\\".  Constitutional antecedents  The Constitution of India 1950 was drafted by the Constituent Assembly from 1946-1950. However, this Constitution drew on a longer history of antecedents documents drafted either as legislation governing British India or aspirational political documents. The Constitution of India Bill 1895, widely considered to be the first Indian articulation of a constitutional vision, contained the following provision related to freedom of speech and expression - 'Every citizen may express his thoughts by words or writings, and publish them in print without liability to censure, but they shall be answerable to abuses, which they may commit in the exercise of this right, in the cases and in the mode the Parliament shall determine.' Other constitutional antecedent documents too contained provisions on freedom of speech and expression. These included: Commonwealth of India Bill 1925, Nehru Report 1928, and States and Minorities 1945. In most cases, the provisions contained some form of restrictions on freedom of speech and expression.  The Debate in the Constituent Assembly  The Constituent Assembly of India debated on freedom of speech and expression (Article 19(1) of the Draft Constitution,1948) on 1 December 1948, 2 December 1948 and 17 October 1949. The draft article read: 'Subject to the other provisions of this article, all citizens shall have the right ‚Äì (a) to freedom of speech and expression; ‚Ä¶ Proviso: Nothing in sub- clause (a) of clause (1) of this article shall affect the operation of any existing law, or prevent the State from making any law, relating to libel, slander, defamation, sedition or any other matter which offends against decency or morality or undermines the security of, or tends to overthrow, the State.' Most members of the Constituent Assembly welcomed the inclusion of the right. However, conflict emerged around the provision in the Article that placed restrictions on the right: while some members opposed the mention of restrictions on the right, others supported it. Members who opposed the restrictions argued that 1. There is no point in having a right to freedom of speech and expression in the presence of restrictions. 2. Putting restrictions on the freedom of speech and expression was a British practice. Members who supported the restrictions argued that # Restrictions are fine as the government now is not a colonial one. # No where in the world is freedom of speech and expression absolute. # Law-order and security of the state can't be compromised. In the end, the Constituent Assembly voted on the Article and included a \\"Right to freedom of speech and expression\\" in the Constitution of India, 1950 with restrictions similar to the ones mentioned in the Draft Constitution, 1948. Constitutional law In a landmark judgment of the case Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India,AIR 1978 SC 597. the Supreme Court held that the freedom of speech and expression has no geographical limitation and it carries with it the right of a citizen to gather information and to exchange thought with others not only in India but abroad also. The constitution of India does not specifically mention the freedom of press. Freedom of press is implied from the Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. Thus the press is subject to the restrictions that are provided under the Article 19(2) of the Constitution. Before Independence, there was no constitutional or statutory provision to protect the freedom of press. As observed by the Privy Council in Channing Arnold v. King Emperor:AIR 1914 PC 116, 117. \\"The freedom of the journalist is an ordinary part of the freedom of the subject and to whatever length, the subject in general may go, so also may the journalist, but apart from statute his privilege is no other and no higher. The range of his assertions, his criticisms or his comments is as wide as, and no wider than that of any other subject\\". The Preamble of the Indian Constitution ensures to all its citizens the liberty of expression. Freedom of the press has been included as part of freedom of speech and expression under the Article 19 of the UDHR. The heart of the Article 19 says: \\"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression, this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.\\" In Romesh Thapar v. State of Madras,Romesh Thapar v. State of Madras, AIR 1950 SC 124. Patanjali Shastri, Chief Justice observed: \\"Freedom of speech and of the press lay at the foundation of all democratic organisations, for without free political discussion no public education, so essential for the proper functioning of the process of popular government, is possible.\\" The Supreme Court observed in Union of India v. Assn. for Democratic Reforms:Union of India v. Assn. for Democratic Reforms, (2002) 5 SCC 294. \\"Onesided information, disinformation, misinformation and non-information, all equally create an uninformed citizenry which makes democracy a farce. Freedom of speech and expression includes right to impart and receive information which includes freedom to hold opinions\\". In Indian Express v. Union of India,Indian Express v. Union of India, (1985) 1 SCC 641. it has been held that the press plays a very significant role in the democratic machinery. The courts have duty to uphold the freedom of press and invalidate all laws and administrative actions that abridge that freedom. Freedom of press has three essential elements. They are: # freedom of access to all sources of information,M.S.M. Sharma v. Sri Krishna Sinha, AIR 1959 SC 395. # freedom of publication, and # freedom of circulation. In India, the press has not been able to practise its freedom to express the popular views. In Sakal Papers Ltd. v. Union of India,Sakal Papers Ltd. v. Union of India, AIR 1962 SC 305. the Daily Newspapers (Price and Page) Order, 1960, which fixed the number of pages and size which a newspaper could publish at a price was held to be violative of freedom of press and not a reasonable restriction under the Article 19(2). Similarly, in Bennett Coleman and Co. v. Union of India,AIR 1973 SC 106; (1972) 2 SCC 788. the validity of the Newsprint Control Order, which fixed the maximum number of pages, was struck down by the Supreme Court of India holding it to be violative of provision of Article 19(1)(a) and not to be reasonable restriction under Article 19(2). The Court struck down the rebuttal of the Government that it would help small newspapers to grow. In Romesh Thapar v. State of Madras (1950 SCR 594, 607; AIR 1950 SC 124), entry and circulation of the English journal \\"Cross Road\\", printed and published in Bombay, was banned by the Government of Madras. The same was held to be violative of the freedom of speech and expression, as \\"without liberty of circulation, publication would be of little value\\". In Prabha Dutt v. Union of India ((1982) 1 SCC 1; AIR 1982 SC 6.), the Supreme Court directed the Superintendent of Tihar Jail to allow representatives of a few newspapers to interview Ranga and Billa, the death sentence convicts, as they wanted to be interviewed. There are instances when the freedom of press has been suppressed by the legislature. The authority of the government, in such circumstances, has been under the scanner of judiciary. In the case of Brij Bhushan v. State of Delhi (AIR 1950 SC 129), the validity of censorship previous to the publication of an English Weekly of Delhi, the Organiser was questioned. The court struck down the Section 7 of the East Punjab Safety Act, 1949, which directed the editor and publisher of a newspaper \\"to submit for scrutiny, in duplicate, before the publication, till the further orders , all communal matters all the matters and news and views about Pakistan, including photographs, and cartoons\\", on the ground that it was a restriction on the liberty of the press. Similarly, prohibiting newspaper from publishing its own views or views of correspondents about a topic has been held to be a serious encroachment on the freedom of speech and expression.Virendra v. State of Punjab, AIR 1957 SC 896; Express Newspapers v. Union of India, AIR 1958SC 578, 617. Restrictions Under Indian law, the freedom of speech and of the press do not confer an absolute right to express one's thoughts freely. Clause (2) of Article 19 of the Indian constitution enables the legislature to impose certain restrictions on free speech under following heads: * I. security of the State, * II. friendly relations with foreign States, * III. public order, * IV. decency and morality, * V. contempt of court, * VI. defamation, * VII. incitement to an offence, and * VIII. sovereignty and integrity of India. Reasonable restrictions on these grounds can be imposed only by a duly enacted law and not by executive action.Bijoe Emmanuel v. State of Kerala, (1986) 3 SCC 615. Security of the State: Reasonable restrictions can be imposed on the freedom of speech and expression, in the interest of the security of the State. All the utterances intended to endanger the security of the State by crimes of violence intended to overthrow the government, waging of war and rebellion against the government, external aggression or war, etc., may be restrained in the interest of the security of the State.State of Bihar v. Shailabala Devi, AIR 1952 SC 329. It does not refer to the ordinary breaches of public order which do not involve any danger to the State. Friendly relations with foreign States: This ground was added by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act of 1951. The State can impose reasonable restrictions on the freedom of speech and expression, if it tends to jeopardise the friendly relations of India with other State. Public order: This ground was added by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951 in order to meet the situation arising from the Supreme Court's decision in Romesh Thapar's case (AIR 1950 SC 124). The expression 'public order' connotes the sense of public peace, safety and tranquillity. In Kishori Mohan v. State of West Bengal, the Supreme Court explained the differences between three concepts: law and order, public order, security of State. Anything that disturbs public peace or public tranquillity disturbs public order.Om Prakash v. Emperor, AIR 1948 Nag, 199. But mere criticism of the government does not necessarily disturb public order.Raj Bahadur Gond v. State of Hyderabad, AIR 1953 Hyd 277. A law punishing the utterances deliberately tending to hurt the religious feelings of any class has been held to be valid as it is a reasonable restriction aimed to maintaining the public order.Ramjilal Modi v. State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1957 SC 622; 1957 SCR 860. It is also necessary that there must be a reasonable nexus between the restriction imposed and the achievement of public order. In Superintendent, Central Prison v. Ram Manohar Lohiya (AIR 1960 SC 633), the Court held the Section 3 of U.P. Special Powers Act, 1932, which punished a person if he incited a single person not to pay or defer the payment of Government dues, as there was no reasonable nexus between the speech and public order. Similarly, the court upheld the validity of the provision empowering a Magistrate to issue directions to protect the public order or tranquillity.Babulal Parate v. State of Maharashtra, AIR 1961 SC 884. Decency and morality: The word 'obscenity' is identical with the word 'indecency' of the Indian Constitution. In an English case of R. v. Hicklin,LR 3 QB 360. the test was laid down according to which it is seen 'whether the tendency of the matter charged as obscene tend to deprave and corrupt the minds which are open to such immoral influences'. This test was upheld by the Supreme Court in Ranjit D. Udeshi v. State of Maharashtra (AIR 1965 SC 881). In this case the Court upheld the conviction of a book seller who was prosecuted under Section 292, I.P.C., for selling and keeping the book Lady Chatterley's Lover. The standard of morality varies from time to time and from place to place. Contempt of court: The constitutional right to freedom of speech would not allow a person to contempt the courts. The expression Contempt of Court has been defined Section 2 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. The term contempt of court refers to civil contempt or criminal contempt under the Act. But judges do not have any general immunity from criticism of their judicial conduct, provided that it is made in good faith and is genuine criticism, and not any attempt to impair the administration of justice. In In re Arundhati Roy ((2002) 3 SCC 343), the Supreme Court of India followed the view taken in the American Supreme Court (Frankfurter, J.) in Pennekamp v. Florida (328 US 331 : 90 L Ed 1295 (1946)) in which the United States Supreme Court observed: \\"If men, including judges and journalists, were angels, there would be no problem of contempt of court. Angelic judges would be undisturbed by extraneous influences and angelic journalists would not seek to influence them. The power to punish for contempt, as a means of safeguarding judges in deciding on behalf of the community as impartially as is given to the lot of men to decide, is not a privilege accorded to judges. The power to punish for contempt of court is a safeguard not for judges as persons but for the function which they exercise\\". In E.M.S. Namboodripad v. T.N. Nambiar ((1970) 2 SCC 325; AIR 1970 SC 2015), the Supreme Court confirmed the decision of the High Court, holding Mr. Namboodripad guilty of contempt of court. In M.R. Parashar v. Farooq Abdullah ((1984) 2 SCC 343; AIR 1984 SC 615.), contempt proceedings were initiated against the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir. But the Court dismissed the petition for want of proof. Defamation: The clause (2) of Article 19 prevents any person from making any statement that injures the reputation of another. With the same view, defamation has been criminalised in India by inserting it into Section 499 of the I.P.C. Where defamation is concerned, in case of a criminal defamation suit as laid down in Sections 499 and Section 500 of the Indian Penal Code, the issue - in question - being the truth isn‚Äôt considered a defence. Even if a person has spoken the truth, he can be prosecuted for defamation. Under the first exception to Section 499, truth will only be a defence if the statement was made ‚Äòfor the public good.‚Äô And that, is a question of fact to be assessed by the judiciary. The erstwhile Economic & Political Weekly (EPW) Editor Paranjoy Guha Thakurta‚Äôs resignation following a legal notice by the lawyers for Adani Power Limited (APL) to the owners ‚Äì the trustees of Sameeksha Trust, which owns and runs the Journal, Editor and authors of an article later withdrawn for \\"failing to meet editorial standards,\\" brought the reach of IPC's Section 499 back into limelight. Incitement to an offense: This ground was also added by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951. The Constitution also prohibits a person from making any statement that incites people to commit offense. Sovereignty and integrity of India: This ground was also added subsequently by the Constitution (Sixteenth Amendment) Act, 1963. This is aimed to prohibit anyone from making statements that challenge the integrity and sovereignty of India. Freedom of the press The Indian Constitution, while not mentioning the word \\"press\\", provides for \\"the right to freedom of speech and expression\\" (Article 19(1) a). However this right is subject to restrictions under sub clause, whereby this freedom can be restricted for reasons of \\"sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, preserving decency, preserving morality, in relation to contempt, court, defamation, or incitement to an offense\\". Laws such as the Official Secrets Act and Prevention of Terrorist Activities Act (PoTA) have been used to limit press freedom. Under PoTA, person could be detained for up to six months for being in contact with a terrorist or terrorist group. PoTA was repealed in 2006, but the Official Secrets Act 1923 continues. For the first half-century of independence, media control by the state was the major constraint on press freedom. Indira Gandhi famously stated in 1975 that All India Radio is \\"a Government organ, it is going to remain a Government organ...\\" With the liberalization starting in the 1990s, private control of media has burgeoned, leading to increasing independence and greater scrutiny of government. It ranks poorly at 138th rank out of 180 listed countries in the Press Freedom Index 2018 released by Reporters Without Borders (RWB). Analytically India's press freedom, as could be deduced by the Press Freedom Index, has constantly reduced since 2002, when it culminated in terms of apparent freedom, achieving a rank of 80 among the reported countries. In 2018, India's freedom of press ranking declined two placed to 138. In explaining the decline, RWB cited growing intolerance from Hindu nationalist supporters of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and the murders of journalists such as Gauri Lankesh. Practical constraints and curtailments Hate speech laws in India are regularly abused by political organisations and other influential people. Although these cases rarely result in a conviction, it is used as a form of intimidation which leads to wide spread self- censorship by the people. Apart from hate speech laws there are many other sections in the Indian Penal Code that curtails free speech. Several books and films have been banned due to their criticism of government policies and initiatives. Books about history and religion are often targeted due to their very nature of promoting historical criticism. The vague phrase ‚Äúdecency or morality‚Äù used in article 19(2) of the constitution has long enabled the state to engage in wide spread moral policing of mass media and the film and entertainment industry as religious groups often object to liberal ideas and deem all progressive values as indecent. Freedom of speech and expression, which enable an individual to participate in public activities. The phrase, \\"freedom of press\\" has not been used in Article 19, though freedom activists, as well as most scholars and industrialised jurisdictions throughout the world recognise that freedom of expression includes freedom of press. Reasonable restrictions can be imposed in the interest of public order, security of State, decency or morality. According to the estimates of Reporters Without Borders, India ranks 138th worldwide in press freedom index (press freedom index for India is 43.24 for 2018). Reporters Without Borders The Indian Constitution, while not mentioning the word \\"press\\", provides for \\"the right to freedom of speech and expression\\" (Article 19(1) a). However this right is subject to restrictions under subclause (2), whereby this freedom can be restricted for reasons of \\"sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, preserving decency, preserving morality, in relation to contempt of court, defamation, or incitement to an offence\\". Laws such as the Official Secrets Act and Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA) have been used to limit press freedom. Under POTA, person could be detained for up to six months before the police were required to bring charges on allegations for terrorism-related offences. POTA was repealed in 2004, but was replaced by amendments to UAPA. The Official Secrets Act 1923 remains in effect. For the first half-century of independence, media control by the state was the major constraint on press freedom. Indira Gandhi famously stated in 1975 that All India Radio is \\"a Government organ, it is going to remain a Government organ...\\" On 26 June 1975, the day after the so-called emergency was declared in violation of the natural rights of Indian citizens, the Mumbai edition of The Times of India in its obituary column carried an entry that read \\"D.E.M O'Cracy beloved husband of T.Ruth, father of L.I.Bertie, brother of Faith, Hope and Justica expired on 26 June\\". With the liberalisation starting in the 1990s, private control of media has increased, leading to increasing independence and greater scrutiny of government. Organisations like Tehelka and NDTV have been particularly influential, e.g. in bringing about the resignation of powerful Haryana minister Venod Sharma. In addition, laws like Prasar Bharati act passed in recent years contribute significantly to reducing the control of the press by the government. In recent times, the Indian government has been accused of trying to curtail this freedom through various means. Sedition According to the English Law, sedition embraces all the practices whether by word or writing which are calculated to disturb the tranquillity of the State and lead an ignorant person to subvert the Government.R. v. Salliven, (1868) 11 Cox Cases 55. Basic criticism of the government is not seen as sedition unless the Government believes that it was calculated to undermine the respect for the government in such a way so as to make people cease to obey it.Niharendra v. Emperor, AIR 1942 FC 22 Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code defines the offence of sedition as follows: \\"Sedition. Whoever by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise, brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards, the Government established by law in India, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, to which fine may be added, or with imprisonment which may extend to three years, to which fine may be added, or with fine\\". But Explanation 3 says \\"Comments expressing disapprobation of the administrative or other action of the Government without exciting or attempting to excite hatred, contempt or disaffection, do not constitute an offence under this section\\".Section 124A of the Code In Kedar Nath v. State of Bihar (AIR 1962 SC 955), the court upheld the constitutional validity of the Section 124A of I.P.C and also upheld the view taken in Niharendu‚Äôs case.

Cole, 'How mapping the Lowy of Tonbridge can further our understanding of its origin, nature and extent', Archaeologia Cantiana, CXXXV (2014), pp. 75-92 (Kent Archaeological Society pdf) Richard was a cousin of William's, both being descended from Richard \\"The Fearless\\" the first Duke of Normandy. The Lowey (also known as Lowry), which simply means \\"Freedom\\" or \\"Liberty\\", gave Richard huge powers over the region and he used this power to extract taxes from the local population to finance the building of Tonbridge Castle, which became the main de Clare family residence for the next 250 years. Richard used his influence and power to expand the Lowey so by the time of the Domesday Book it included much of Surrey as well as Kent. This continuous expansion of the estate put the de Clare family into dispute with the Archbishops of Canterbury and the king was asked to intervene twice to decide how large it should actually be. When the de Clare family got on the wrong side of the crown, the castle and its Lowey was the first thing the king seized back from them often by force and this happened in the reigns of kings William II, John and Henry III. The castle and Lowey were returned to the family once the dispute had been resolved. After the death of Gilbert de Clare, 8th Earl of Gloucester at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 aged only 23 without an heir, Hugh the younger de Spencer, who had married the earl's oldest sister could not wait for Edward II to decide how his estate should be divided, and seized the Lowey and castle without permission. His tenure was quite short-lived as he was executed by Queen Isabella, the wife of Edward II. The Lowey had two large deer parks, North Frith and South Frith, whose names still survive today. The Lowey survived well into the 19th century; in fact Tonbridge was one of England's largest parishes.

In 1759, she was sent to bring the new king, Carlos III, from Naples to Barcelona. When Spain entered the American Revolutionary War in June 1779, F√©nix set sail for the English Channel where she was to join a Franco-Spanish fleet of more than 60 ships of the line under Lieutenant General Luis de C√≥rdova y C√≥rdova. The Armada of 1779 was an invasion force of 40,000 troops with orders to capture the British naval base at Portsmouth. As the flagship of Admiral Juan de L√°ngara, the ship fought at the Battle of Cape St Vincent on 16January 1780, where she was captured by the British Royal Navy and commissioned as the third rate HMS Gibraltar in March of that year. She spent a short while in the English Channel before joining Samuel Hood's squadron in the West Indies and taking part in the Capture of St Eustatius in February 1781 and the Battle of Fort Royal the following month. Gibraltar and five other ships were sent to stop a French invasion fleet bound for Tobago in May 1781, but found the French too powerful and had to withdraw. In November, her 18-pound guns were replaced with 24-pounders, after which, in February 1782, she sailed to the East Indies and in the following year participated in the Battle of Cuddalore. At the start of the French Revolutionary War, Gibraltar served in the Channel Fleet, fighting at the Glorious First of June in 1794 before being sent to the Mediterranean in May 1795. In June, the ship was in an action off Hy√®res; then, in December 1796, she was badly damaged in a storm and had to return to England for major repairs. By June Gibraltar was back in the Mediterranean, serving in the navy's Egyptian campaign, where she remained during and beyond the Peace of Amiens, except for a short period when she was sent home for a refit. Returning to the Channel in April 1807, Gibraltar joined the fleet under Admiral James Gambier, which fought the Battle of the Basque Roads in 1809. This was her last major action; the ship was taken out of service in 1813 and converted to a powder hulk. She became a lazarette in 1824, then was broken up in November 1836 at Pembroke Dock.

Classed as an 80-gun third rate, F√©nix was armed with thirty on her lower gun deck, thirty-two on her upper gun deck, twelve on the quarterdeck, and six on the forecastle. Her sister ship, , was later converted to a 100-gun, three-decker. She was wrecked at Trafalgar in 1805. F√©nix was captured by the British in 1780. She was copper sheathed and fitted out for British service at Plymouth Dockyard between April and August 1780 at a cost of ¬£16,068.5.3d. The Admiralty changed her armament a number of times: in November 1781 the 18 pounders on her upper deck were upgraded to 24 pounders, and the same December two carronades were added. By 1810, the guns on her quarterdeck had been replaced with four guns and eight carronades, and on her forecastle with four 12-pounder guns and two 32-pounder carronades.Winfield, (2008) p. 29 Although large, two deck ships were favoured in other European navies, the British preferred to build three-deck third rates; the extra space making them better suited for flagships. After the capture of F√©nix, the Admiralty began to see the advantages of a longer two-deck ship which was less prone to hog, almost as well armed as its three-decked counterparts, and relatively quick.Winfield (2008) p. 28 Spanish service F√©nix was part of a squadron of eleven ships-of-the-line, accompanied by two frigates and two tartanes, sent to collect the new king, Carlos III, from Naples in 1759. Under Captain Gutierra de Hevia y Vald√©s and as the flagship of Lieutenant General Juan Jose Navarro, she set sail from C√°diz on 29August. The squadron passed through the Straits of Gibraltar on 2September, before stopping at Cartagena on 10September to pick up supplies. On 28September it arrived at its destination, where it was reinforced with five other men-of-war. The King embarked on 7October, and the squadron arrived in Barcelona on 17October.Duro, p. 17Al√≠a Plana, p. 345 F√©nix was stationed in C√°diz in January 1762 and spent the next two years serving in the Mediterranean Sea, the Straits of Gibraltar, and the Atlantic Ocean. F√©nix underwent several large repairs at the Arsenal de la Carraca between 1764 and 1765, where she remained stripped of her armament until 1769, under the command of Francisco Cotiella. In 1778 F√©nix was recommissioned under Captain F√©lix Ignacio deTejada, who was superseded by Captain Francisco Javier deMelgarejo y Rojas when Spain entered the American Revolutionary War in June 1779.Losada, p. 233 F√©nix immediately set sail for the English Channel, part of the fleet under Lieutenant General Luis de C√≥rdova y C√≥rdova, which was supposed to meet a French fleet at the Sisgaras Islands, off the northern coast of Spain. This Franco-Spanish Armada of 1779 of more than 60 ships of the line was to escort an invasion force of 40,000 troops across the Channel in a bid to capture the British naval base at Portsmouth.Duro, pp. 231‚Äì236 C√≥rdova's ships were delayed by contrary winds, which forced them to keep close to the coast of Portugal. In consequence they did not arrive at the rendezvous until 22July, by which time the French, short of supplies, had left.Duro, p. 236 Although the two fleets would eventually unite, F√©nix left for the Azores on 23July with a squadron under Lieutenant General Antonio de Ulloa, to protect the Spanish anchorage and to face a British force of which the Spanish had received news.Losada, p. 236 The Moonlight Battle By 1780 F√©nix was 31 years old. She was neither a good sailer nor as well armed as her British counterparts, which carried . Nevertheless, as the largest ship in a squadron comprising eleven ships-of- the-line and two frigates, she was serving as the flagship of Admiral Don Juan L√°ngara, when on 16January 1780, she was seen by a British fleet commanded by Admiral George Brydges Rodney.

Princessa would eventually engage in an hour-long battle with before striking her colours around 17:30.Syrett, p. 240 The chase continued into the dark; at 19:30, the 74-gun came upon F√©nix and engaged her in a battle that lasted over an hour. F√©nix was then broadsided in passing by another seventy-four, , and the 90-gun , wounding L√°ngara in the process. F√©nix finally surrendered to the 74-gun , which arrived late in the battle but shot away F√©nixs mainmast. At 21:15 Montagu engaged the 68-gun , which struck after her maintopmast had been shot away. Around 23:00, the 70-gun San Eugenio surrendered after having all of her masts shot away by the 74-gun while of 74 guns and Prince George, engaged the 70-gun San Juli√°n and compelled her to surrender around 01:00 the next day. The last ship to surrender was the 68-gun . After shooting away the topmast of the 68-gun , she engaged in a running battle with the frigate HMS Apollo and struck when Rodney's flagship, the 98-gun , came upon the scene around 02:00.Syrett, p. 241 San Eugenio and San Juli√°n were blown ashore and lost, but the other four were taken into the Royal Navy. Four other Spanish vessels escaped from the action. British service F√©nix was commissioned under Captain John Carter Allen in February 1780 and renamed HMS Gibraltar on 23April. She joined George Darby's fleet in the English Channel until 29November, when she left for Samuel Hood's squadron in the West Indies under Captain Walter Stirling. In 1781, under Captain Charles Knatchbull, Gibraltar became the flagship of Rear- Admiral Francis Samuel Drake and was present at the Capture of St Eustatius in February. Following the outbreak of war between the Dutch Republic and Britain in December 1780, Rodney received orders from London to seize the island. A British expedition of 3,000 troops from St Lucia, under the command of Lieutenant-General Sir John Vaughan, arrived off St Eustatius on 3February 1781. Rodney, in command of the naval forces, positioned his fleet so as to neutralise any shore batteries, but instead of disembarking the troops and launching an immediate assault, Rodney sent a message to Governor Johannes de Graaff suggesting that he surrender to avoid bloodshed. DeGraaff agreed to the proposal and capitulated. The only shots fired were from Gibraltar and , both of which, without orders, briefly engaged Mars, the only Dutch warship in the roadstead.Trew, pp. 102‚Äì103 Blockade of Martinique French map showing the position of the two fleets off Martinique, at 12:30, 15:00, and 19:00 Gibraltar was part of a 17-ship squadron, keeping four French ships-of-the- line in Fort Royal, Martinique, when on 29April 1781 a 20-ship fleet and a merchant convoy under Contre-amiral Fran√ßois deGrasse arrived from Brest. Out of sight of the British, deGrasse put a man ashore to swap information with Fort Royal's garrison, and agree on a plan of attack with the blockaded ships.Clowes (Vol. III), p. 482 De Grasse ordered his fleet to prepare for action, and on the morning of April29 sailed for Fort Royal with the convoy ships hugging the coast and the armed ships in battle line. Hood's fleet was seen bearing toward them around 08:00 but deGrasse held the weather gauge. At about 09:20, Hood was joined by Prince William, a 64-gun ship that had been at St. Lucia. The two fleets continued to push for advantageous positions. Hood's leeward position prevented deGrasse from bringing the convoy to the harbour, but the four previously blockaded French ships were able to sail out and strengthen deGrasse's position.Clowes (Vol. III), p. 484 Gibraltar, as Drake's flagship, led the British rear division. Around 11:00, the French van began firing at long range, with little effect. By 12:30 the two fleets were aligned, but deGrasse refused to close with Hood, despite Hood's efforts to bring the French to him. The fleets then exchanged cannonades and broadsides at a distance for the next hour. The damage incurred on either side was modest; the four British ships on the southern end of the line suffered the most damage from having been targeted and outnumbered by eight French ships. The 74-gun suffered in particular, and that night Hood sent her to StEustatius. Arriving on 4May, her commander was able to brief Rodney about the engagement and French numbers.Clowes (Vol. III), p. 486 British casualties amounted to 43 dead and 161 wounded, of which Gibraltars share was 6 and 16, respectively. In an attempt to force an action, Hood spent most of the next day struggling to get his ships to windward, but finding two of his fleet too damaged to sail properly, he eventually broke off in a northerly direction. Rodney, who had left StEustatius earlier that day in Sandwich with the 74-gun and the hurriedly repaired Russell, met with Hood on 11May between St Kitts and Antigua. The reunited fleet turned south, putting into Barbados on 18May. Invasion of St Lucia and Tobago Celebrating the capture of Tobago, French painting from 1784 Hood's withdrawal to Barbados had left St Lucia exposed, and on 10May, the whole French fleet, less two ships-of-the-line landed 1200 troops at Gros Islet, a village at the northern end of the island. On the same day, the remaining two ships from the French fleet and 1300 troops sailed for Tobago.Clowes, p. 487 The British were able to repel the attacks on St Lucia so deGrasse decided to reinforce his attack on Tobago, diverting his fleet there on 25May and sending 3000 more troops from Martinique. While at Barbados, Rodney received news of Tobago, and on 29May dispatched Drake in Gibraltar with five other ships. Drake intercepted the French the following day, but being hopelessly out-numbered retired to Barbados. He arrived on 3June, and Rodney immediately put to sea with the entire fleet. The British reached Tobago the following day, only to learn it had surrendered two days previously. Gibraltar carried Rodney back to England in August 1781 and was refitted at Plymouth that October. On completion in January the following year, she was allocated to Captain Thomas Hicks as the flagship of Sir Richard Bickerton. In February, she sailed for the East Indies. Cuddalore The Battle of Cuddalore by Auguste Jugelet, 1836 Following the death of French ally Hyder Ali in December 1782, British commanders at Madras decided to attempt the recapture of Cuddalore. The army marched south from Madras, circling around the city and then encamping south of it. The British fleet, eighteen ships-of-the-line including Gibraltar, under Admiral Sir Edward Hughes, anchored to the south to protect the army and its supply ships.Mahan, p. 561 By early June 1783 the Siege of Cuddalore was under way.Mahan, p. 562 French Admiral Pierre Andr√© de Suffren with a fleet of fifteen ships sailed from Trincomalee to support the besieged city on 10June. Arriving on 13June, the French found the British reluctant to fight, moving away and anchoring some five miles off. As the success of the siege would probably be decided by naval action, 1200 troops were embarked onto Suffren's ships to increase his gunnery complement. Having been frustrated by contrary winds, the French fleet was able to close with the British ships on 17June. Hughes, not wishing to be caught at anchor, weighed, and the two fleets began manoeuvring for advantage. Both fleets were at first hampered by light and changeable winds. When a consistent west wind appeared on 20June, Hughes lined up for battle and awaited Suffren's action. Lining up in a similar formation, Suffren gave the order to attack, and battle began shortly after four in the afternoon. The action lasted around three hours and resulted in no major damage to ships in either fleet, despite all ships being engaged. The British had 99 men killed and 434 wounded; French casualties amounted to 102 killed and 386 wounded.Mahan, pp. 262‚Äì263 Spanish armament and the outbreak of war Gibraltar returned to England in July 1784, paid off, and in September was laid up in ordinary. Repairs costing ¬£36,713.0.6d were carried out between February 1788 and August 1790. During the Great Spanish Armament, when Spain laid claim to the Nootka Sound, she was brought back into service under Captain Samuel Goodall in May 1790. France declared war on Britain in February 1793, and Gibraltar was recommissioned under Captain Thomas Mackenzie in May 1793. In September she was refitted at a cost of ¬£17,485 before joining the Channel Fleet under Richard Lord Howe. As part of this fleet, Gibraltar, on 2May 1794, accompanied the East and West India and Newfoundland convoys along the Channel as far as Lizard Point. Howe then divided his force, sending eight ships-of-the-line and four or five frigates to escort the convoys further.James, (Vol. I), p. 125 The remaining 26 ships-of-the-line, including Gibraltar, set off to search for a large Franco-American grain convoy known to be heading to France.James (Vol. I), pp. 125‚Äì126 Having had two frigates confirm that the French fleet was still at Brest, and realising that it would leave to protect the imminent convoy, Howe attempted an interception in advance by placing his ships where he thought an encounter likely. After thirteen days of searching, the British fleet returned on 19May, to find the fleet in Brest gone.James (Vol. I), p. 126 On the same day, Howe's fleet fell in with the fifth-rate , which had been attached to Rear-Admiral Sir George Montagu's squadron. Also searching for the convoy, Montagu had been cruising between Cape Ortugal and Belle-Isle, but knowing he would be hopelessly outnumbered, he had sent Venus to locate Howe and ask for reinforcements.James (Vol. I), p. 128 At 04:00 the next morning, Howe ordered all sail in an attempt to reach Montagu before the French. A Dutch convoy, bound for Lisbon, had been captured by the French on 19 May and some of these ships were intercepted by the British on 21 May. The crews were able to provide information regarding the whereabouts of the French fleet and Howe set off in pursuit, realising that Montagu was no longer in danger. Not wishing to reduce his numbers by allocating prize crews, Howe ordered the convoy destroyed.James (Vol. I), p. 129 First of June The British and French fleets on the morning of 1June 1794James (Vol. I), p. 147 On 25 May a French ship was seen and followed, which after three days led the British to the main French fleet.James (Vol. I), p. 130 Howe gave the order to prepare for battle at 09:45 on 28May and at 10:35 to form into two columns. In an attempt to force an action, some of the fastest ships were sent to attack the French rear, which they did throughout the day, both causing and receiving some damage.James (Vol. I), pp. 130‚Äì131 The two fleets came together on 29May, and a limited engagement took place that petered out and became a general chase after an attempt to cut the French line was mistimed.James (Vol. I), pp. 136‚Äì137 Thick fog prevented any further action for the next two days.James (Vol. I), pp. 144‚Äì145 The weather cleared on the morning of 1 June, and both fleets were drawn up line ahead, sailing in the same direction, Gibraltar in the centre, immediately before Hood's flagship, the first-rate and behind the 74-gun . At around 08:15 the order was given for each ship to bear down upon and engage her opposite number.James (Vol. I), pp. 146‚Äì147 Gibraltar was one of three ships Howe signalled to put on more sail.James (Vol. I), p. 148 The tardiness of Gibraltar and the 74-gun , on the other side of Queen Charlotte, meant that Howe found himself battling one 120-gun and two 80-gun ships simultaneously. Gibraltar was, however, able to stop a fourth enemy ship, the first-rate R√©publicain, from joining in, by bringing down her main and mizzen masts from a distance.James (Vol. I), p. 150 By the end of the action, six French ships had been captured and another sunk. The remainder escaped.James (Vol. I), p. 152 In the three engagements, it was estimated that French casualties were between 3,000 and 7,000 dead and wounded, while British losses were recorded as 290 dead and 858 wounded.James (Vol. I), pp. 152‚Äì153 Having been kept to windward for most of the battle, casualties aboard Gibraltar were light: two killed and 12 wounded.James (Vol. I), p. 159 After spending two days making repairs, the British fleet sailed for home with its prizes, having failed to stop the grain convoy that arrived in Brest on 12June.James (Vol. I), p. 169James (Vol. I), p. 172 Action of Hy√®res Gibraltar was sent to the Mediterranean in May 1795 under Captain John Pakenham, who had taken command in August the previous year. Joining Admiral William Hotham's fleet on 14June, Gibraltar fought in an action off the Hy√®res Islands in July.James (Vol. I), p. 267 The fleet was re-victualling in San Fiorenzo bay on 8July when a small squadron under Commodore Horatio Nelson approached, followed by the French Fleet from Toulon. The British fleet was not able to put to sea immediately due to contrary winds but was spotted by the French, who abandoned their chase. Hotham finished refitting and supplying his ships, and finally managed to set off after his quarry at 21:00; almost twelve hours later.James (Vol. I), p. 267 Following a storm, the British were carrying out repairs when they sighted the French fleet at dawn on 13July. At 03:45 Hotham gave the order to make all possible sail in pursuit of their enemy, five miles off and heading for Fr√©jus.James (Vol. I), p. 268 The two fleets were close enough to exchange fire at 08:00 when the British van engaged the rearmost French ships, one of which struck after six hours. However, she caught fire and exploded before the British could take possession of her. Just as Gibraltar was joining the action, Hotham signalled to disengage, believing the fleet to be running out of sea-room but being too far back to see that this was not the case.James (Vol. I), p. 269 Hotham resigned his position early the following year and was eventually replaced by Admiral John Jervis.James (Vol.I), p. 308 Caught in a storm The British fleet was anchored off The Rock on 10December 1796 when a storm blew up. Culloden was obliged to get under way when her anchors failed to hold, narrowly missing Pearl Rock in the process, and at 21:00, Gibraltar was forced to cut her cable.James (Vol. I), pp. 316‚Äì317 As she was attempting to get clear of Cabrita Point at 22:00, her fore topmast snapped and her foresail, mainsail, main topmast staysail, and mizzen staysail tore. Having already lost her main topsail, she became difficult to handle and struck the sandbank several times before being blown across it.James (Vol. I), p. 317 By midnight Gibraltar was out of danger and able to ride out the storm, and the next day at noon she anchored in Tangier Bay. The damage incurred during the storm necessitated her being sent to Plymouth in January 1797. During the repairs, which took until April and cost ¬£12,818, a large piece of rock was removed from her hull.James (Vol. I), p. 318 Gibraltar returned to the Mediterranean in July 1797 under Captain William Hancock Kelly. Bruix' expedition √âtienne Eustache Bruix In May 1799 Gibraltar was one of fifteen line-of-battle-ships in a fleet commanded by George Elphinstone, which had been blockading the port of C√°diz since the beginning of the year.James (Vol. II), pp. 256‚Äì257 On hearing from the British frigate that the French fleet had broken out of Brest and was on its way, Elphinstone immediately had all ships prepare for action, and dispatched the brig-sloop to warn Jervis at Gibraltar.James (Vol. II), p. 257James (Vol. II), p. 258 The French fleet under Vice-Admiral √âtienne Eustache Bruix, which had escaped on 25April, comprised 25 ships-of-the-line and had already evaded Hood's Channel Fleet, when it appeared fifteen miles off C√°diz on 4May.James (Vol. II), pp. 254‚Äì255 Bruix's orders were to combine the French and Spanish fleets and rescue Napoleon's army, stranded in Egypt following the Battle of the Nile, but the ships in C√°diz were prevented from joining their French allies by an opposing wind, and although the British offered their line-of-battle, it was declined and the Brest fleet instead stood out for the Straits of Gibraltar.Rodger, p. 462 Elphinstone followed as far as Cape Spartel before first returning to check on the fleet in C√°diz, then sailing to join Jervis at Gibraltar, arriving at 09:00 on 10May.James (Vol. II), pp. 259‚Äì260 Elphinstone made several further attempts to track down and bring the French to action, without success.James (Vol. II), pp. 260‚Äì265 Bruix was able to amass a powerful fleet of 59 ships but failed to achieve his ultimate goal and returned to Brest on 8August.James (Vol. II), p. 267Rodger, p.463 In January 1801 a large expedition of 16,000 troops and more than 100 vessels was assembled in Malta in preparation for an invasion of Egypt. Elphinstone's fleet, to which Gibraltar was attached, escorted the force to Aboukir Bay, arriving on 1February 1801.Long, p. 112 Bad weather prevented the army, under Sir Ralph Abercrombie, from landing for a week, and the lack of water prevented Gibraltar and the larger ships from giving covering fire during debarkation; nevertheless, the Battle of Alexandria was brought to a successful conclusion when the French surrendered on 2September following a long siege.Long, p. 113 In 1850 a medal with the clasp \\"Egypt\\" was retrospectively awarded to the surviving members of Gibraltars crew for their part in the campaign. Ganteaume's expeditions Honor√© Joseph Antoine Ganteaume In March 1801 Gibraltar took part in the pursuit of Contre-amiral Honor√© Ganteaume, whose squadron had made a further attempt to reinforce the French troops in Egypt. Having sailed from Brest on 7January, the French force of three 80-gun and four 74-gun ships-of-the-line, plus two frigates,James (Vol. III), p. 87 passed into the Mediterranean on 9February, where it captured the only British ship in the area, the 32-gun frigate, Success.James (Vol. III), p. 90 Rear- admiral Sir John Borlase Warren's squadron, comprising Gibraltar, the seventy- fours , , , , and the 64-gun Haerlem, on hearing of the event, set off in pursuit.James (Vol. III), p. 91 Forced into Port Mahon on 27February by a storm, the squadron remained there for several days while repairs were undertaken. The search continued on 4March, minus G√©n√©reux, which was left to defend the island in the event of a surprise attack by French and Spanish forces. After Warren's squadron had visited Naples and Palermo, it received reinforcements on 18 and 22March in the form of the 64-gun Ath√©nien and the 74-gun , respectively. Now, with seven ships-of-the-line, Warren turned towards Toulon, hoping to find Ganteaume there.James (Vol. III), p. 92 At dawn on 25 March, while crossing the Tyrrhenian Sea, the French squadron was spotted, having been reduced to ten ships by a storm the previous night. Ganteaume turned his ships to the south-east and Warren gave chase. Gibraltar and Athenienne began to lag behind, and Warren, fearing his force would become fragmented, ordered his faster ships to slow down. The French were thus able to escape into the night, the British continuing on a south-east course while they quietly turned north, back to Toulon.James (Vol. III), p. 93 Elba Warren's squadron was called upon to relieve the British garrison at Porto Ferrajo, which had been under siege since the beginning of May 1801.James (Vol. III), p. 95 The arrival of the British ships on 1August caused the two French frigates blockading the port to retreat to Leghorn.James (Vol. III), p. 96 These two frigates, and the recently captured Succ√®s, were later brought to action on 2September by the British frigates , , and . Succ√®s was recaptured, and Bravoure was destroyed after she had run aground.James (Vol. III), pp. 96‚Äì97 Warren's squadron, which included Gibraltar, supplied nearly 700 seamen and marines for an attack on the French batteries investing the town. The action took place on 14September but was only partially successful, and eight days later the British ships left Elba. Porto Ferrajo itself remained in British hands until the end of the war.James (Vol. III), p. 98 Conflict renewed During the Peace of Amiens, a short-lived mutiny took place aboard Gibraltar. The officers and marines were quickly able to regain control, however, and the instigators were hanged.Woodman, p. 147 When Britain declared war on France in May 1803, Gibraltar, commanded by Captain George Frederick Ryves, was one of only ten British ships in the Mediterranean. Under Sir Richard Bickerton, the squadron was stationed off Naples before sailing for Toulon on 4June.James (Vol. III), p. 182 Overall command passed to Horatio Nelson when he arrived in the frigate on 8July, and when Thomas Masterman Hardy joined in the first-rate on 30July, Nelson immediately moved his flag to her.James (Vol. III), pp. 182‚Äì183 By 1804 the British fleet in the Mediterranean had been reinforced and Gibraltar was paid off in July. She was refitted in Portsmouth in July 1805 at a cost of ¬£30,643 and re-classed as a second-rate. She returned to the Mediterranean at the end of the year under Captain Mark Robinson, command later passing to Captain William Lukin. Gibraltar and two 36-gun frigates, and , spotted the 74-gun off Belleisle, on 26August 1806. Commanded by J√©r√¥me Bonaparte, youngest brother of Napoleon, V√©t√©ran was returning from the Bahamas. The British ships gave chase, but V√©t√©ran outran them and found a safe anchorage in Baie de La For√™t, Brittany.Clowes (Vol. V), p. 195 Basque Roads The French under attack by British fireships during the evening of 11April 1809. Portrayed by Louis- Philippe Cr√©pin. When Captain John Halliday assumed command of Gibraltar in April 1807, she was serving in the Channel, part of a fleet under Admiral James Gambier. On 17March 1809 this fleet joined with Robert Stoppard's squadron, which was blockading the French fleet in the Basque Roads. Halliday was superseded at the beginning of April by Henry Lidgbird Ball, who was Gibraltars captain at the Battle of Basque Roads.James (Vol. V), pp. 103‚Äì104 The French ships had been anchored under the protection of the powerful batteries on the Isle d'Aix when on 11April, Lord Cochrane attacked them with fireships and explosive vessels.James (Vol. V), p. 105 Gibraltars crew and officers helped man the fireships, which were limited in the damage they caused by a boom placed across the channel.James (Vol. V), p. 104 This was breached by one of the explosive vessels, however, and the French panicked, slipped their anchors, and drifted onto the shore.James (Vol. V), pp. 108‚Äì109 Gibraltars Lieutenant John Cookesley, who commanded one of the fireships, and Master's mate John Conyer were both badly burnt during the operation.James (Vol. V), p. 107Clowes (Vol. V) p. 262 Gambier's fleet spent the next two weeks attempting to capture or destroy the stranded French vessels, with some success. The attack came to an end on 29April when the last French ship was re-floated and taken up the river to safety at Rochefort.James (Vol. V), p. 122 Command of Gibraltar passed to Valentine Collard in June 1809, then Robert Plampin in 1810 when she returned to service in the Channel. Gibraltars last commander was Captain George Scott, who took over in January 1812. Fate Gibraltar was paid off some time in 1813 and laid up in ordinary at Plymouth. Towards the end of the year, she was converted to a powder hulk. She was moved to Milford Haven in September 1824 where she was used as a lazarette, then broken up in November 1836 at Pembroke Dock. Some of her timbers (of South American cedar) were used to make the partitions and doors of the cabins of , which was being built at Pembroke at the time.

Function  The protein encoded by this gene is a helix-loop- helix (HLH) protein that can form heterodimers with members of the basic HLH family of transcription factors. The encoded protein has no DNA binding activity and therefore can inhibit the DNA binding and transcriptional activation ability of basic HLH proteins with which it interacts. This protein may play a role in cell growth, senescence, and differentiation. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.  Interactions  ID1 has been shown to interact weakly with MyoD but very tightly with ubiquitously expressed E proteins. E proteins heterodimerize with tissue restricted bHLH proteins such as Myod, NeuroD, etc. to form active transcription complexes so by sequestering E proteins, Id proteins can inhibit tissue restricted gene expression in multiple cell lineages using the same biochemical mechanism. Other interacting partners include CASK.  Clinical significance  ID1 can be used to mark endothelial progenitor cells which are critical to tumor growth and angiogenesis. Targeting ID1 results in decreased tumor growth.

Launched in 1779 as the French ship Jason, she was captured by the British in 1782 and commissioned by them in the same year. After active service against the French, she was converted to a hospital ship in 1804 and permanently moored off Chatham Dockyard. Argonaut was removed from navy service in 1828 and broken up in 1831.  Career   French career  On 2 May 1780, she departed Brest with the 7-ship and 3-frigate Exp√©dition Particuli√®re under Admiral Ternay, escorting 36 transports carrying troops to support the Continental Army in the War of American Independence. The squadron comprised the 80-gun Duc de Bourgogne, under Ternay d'Arsac (admiral) and M√©dine (flag captain); the 74-gun Neptune, under Sochet Des Touches, and Conqu√©rant, under La Grandi√®re; and the 64-gun Provence under Lombard, Ardent under Bernard de Marigny, Jason under La Clocheterie and √âveill√© under Le Gardeur de Tilly, and the frigates Surveillante under Villeneuve Cillart, Amazone under La P√©rouse, and Bellone. Amazone, which constituted the vanguard of the fleet, arrived at Boston on 11 June 1780. British career On 8 January 1795, while under the command of Captain Alexander John Ball she captured the French Republican warship Esperance on the North America Station. Esperance was armed with 22 guns (4 and 6-pounders), and had a crew of 130 men. She was under the command of Lieutenant de Vaisseau De St. Laurent and had been out 56 days from Rochfort, bound for the Chesapeake. Argonaut shared the prize money with Captain Robert Murray's HMS Oiseaux. The French ambassador to the United States registered a complaint with the President of the United States that Argonaut, by entering Lynnhaven bay, either before she captured Esperance or shortly thereafter, had violated a treaty between France and the United States.President (1815), pp.38-9. The French also accused the British of having brought Esperance into Lynnhaven for refitting for a cruise. The President passed the complaint to the Secretary of State, who forwarded the complaint to the Governor of Virginia. The Governor inquired into the matter of the British Consul at Virginia. The British Consul replied that the capture had taken place some 10 leagues off shore. The weather had forced Argonaut and her prize to shelter within the Chesapeake for some days, but that they had left as soon as practicable. Furthermore, Argonaut had paroled her French prisoners when she came into Lynnhaven and if had entered American territorial waters solely to parole her French prisoners no one would have thought that objectionable.Pitt et al., (1875-93), p.445. The authorities in Virginia took a number of depositions but ultimately nothing further came from the matter. Because she was captured in good order and sailed well, Rear Admiral George Murray, the British commander in chief of the North American station, put a British crew aboard and sent Esperance out on patrol with Lynx on 31 January. On 3 August 1795, Argonaut captured the ship Anna. Fate Argonaut was placed on harbour service in 1797, and eventually broken up in 1831.

It describes the historical events of Odisha related to Lord Jagannath and the Jagannath Temple. The Madala Panji dates from the 12th century.Britannica.com Madala Panji's role in Odia history While writing Odia history, historians like Sir W.W.Hunter and Andrew Stirling considered the facts related in Madala Panji as a base . The Madala Panji was traditionally written on a year-to-year basis. On Bijaya-Dashami day, the Karanas (official history writers of Puri, a caste of Odisha, involved in keeping the chronicle. This ritual is cited as a proof that the tradition of keeping this chronicle began with Odia king Anantavarman Chodaganga Dev (1078‚Äì1150) himself. There are some, like Dr. Harekrushna Mahatab, Dr.Nilakantha Dash and Dr. Krushna Chandra Panigrahi who hold that the Panji dates from the reign of Ramachandra Deva I who re-established the worship of Lord Jagannatha after Kalapahad said to have destroyed it. The arguments are complex, but it is likely that much of the early record was indeed lost in the period that followed Kala Pahad and was rewritten in a fashion that mixed legend with history. Writers of Panji According to the tradition, Chodaganga created 24 families of Karanas to preserve the temple records. Of these, five were entrusted with the writing and preservation of the Madala Panji. They are: * Panjia Karan‚Äîpreserves the Madala Panji * Tadau Karan‚Äîwrites the Madala Panji * Deula Karan‚Äîenforces the Madala * Kotha Karan‚Äîthe main compiler * Baithi Karan ‚Äì assistant Classification In subsequent stage, due to the bulky size of Madala Panji, its content covering different dimensions related to temple management, it was divided into four parts: # Bhandara Khanja Madala (maintained by Pattajoshi Mohapatra) # Deula Madala / Karmangi Madala (maintained by Deula Karana) # Deshapanji Madala (prepared by Deula Karana) # Rajakhanja Madala (prepared and maintained by Tadhau Karana),http://www.orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/june_july-2007/engpdf/Pages91-96.pdf Types of Panjis There are also five different categories of Panjis.

Important events related to the rituals recorded. Announced daily at the Beherana. * Dina Panji‚ÄîThe daily almanac read by the temple astrologer at the time of the Avakash. These were prepared annually and finalized on Vishuva Sankranti. Besides the Madala, there were other Karans who wrote regional chronicles, known as Chakadas. \\"All the Kadatas and Chakadas taken together will be about a cartload.\\" Madala Panji in recent years Madala Panji language is Odia and was recorded in Odia and Telugu script, preserved in the Manuscript Library in Madras, which speaks about the story regarding image of Neela Madhava or Lord Jagannath of Udra desa, as Odisha was known in Middle Ages. It seems to have re-written during 16th century when the King of Khurda had newly installed the images after destruction made by Kalapahad, Muslim general of Nawab of Bangal.

Cancell is available in tablet and liquid form. Originally called Entelev, the formula was developed by biochemist James V. Sheridan. Sheridan sought to target the primarily anaerobic cell metabolism of cancer cells (following the theories of Otto Warburg), claiming to lower cell potential leading to the destruction of cancer cells. The Cancell formula was tested by the National Cancer Institute and found to be ineffective against cancer, though Cancell continues to be marketed as a dietary supplement in the US.  Formulation and efficacy  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has listed the components as inositol, nitric acid, sodium sulfite, potassium hydroxide, sulfuric acid, and catechol. Precise formulation varies by manufacturer, and may include crocinic acid and various minerals and vitamins. Researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) tested the constituents of Cancell in animal experiments in 1978 and 1980 and in vitro on human tumors in 1990 and 1991. They concluded that the compounds comprising Cancell could not be taken in doses high enough to kill cancer cells in the body, and that further study was not warranted. No peer- reviewed clinical or animal trials of Cancell have demonstrated any positive effect; claims for Cancell's efficacy are limited to anecdotal reports and testimonials. The American Cancer Society and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center recommend against the use of CanCell, as there is no evidence that it is effective in treating any disease, and its proposed method of action is not consistent with modern science.  Legal status  Injunction proceedings were instigated by the FDA in June 1987 for manufacturing compliance violations and failure to maintain complaints files. A complaint for permanent injunction was filed February 21, 1989 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan to enjoin Sheridan and Edward J. Sopcak from distributing CanCell. At a hearing in November 1992, the Court found Sopcak to be in civil contempt and ordered him to comply with the injunction immediately. Cancell is currently distributed as a dietary supplement under the names Protocel and Entelev, and is not approved by the FDA for use as a cancer treatment or for any other purpose. Since it is marketed as a dietary supplement with no health claims attached, its regulation falls under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA).

Born in Glasgow in 1928, McGinn was a prolific songwriter and is recognised as an influential figure in the British folk music revival of the late Fifties and early Sixties. Biography Matthew McGinn was born in Ross Street at the corner of the Gallowgate in Calton, in the East End of Glasgow on 17 January 1928. Born the eighth child of a family of nine, his formal education ended when he entered an approved school at the age of 12. Despite this, McGinn was, by his early 20s, recognised as a highly political charismatic debater of left-wing politics. On his release from approved school he worked in the Hillington factory of GKN, spending his spare time at evening classes and reading. He gained a Trade Union scholarship to study economics and political science at Ruskin College in Oxford when he was 31. After graduating, he trained to become a teacher at Huddersfield Teachers' Training College and went on to work as a teacher in Lanarkshire for three years before becoming the organiser of the Gorbals Adventure Playground. McGinn joined the folk scene after winning a song contest with a song entitled \\"The Foreman O'Rourke\\". He met Pete Seeger in 1961 when Seeger was touring the British Isles. Seeger championed McGinn's music in the United States and arranged for him to be part of a concert performance at Carnegie Hall, where McGinn met a young Bob Dylan. His career in music began during the folk revival of the 1960s but, while others leaned towards what they perceived traditional music, McGinn carved his own niche as a humourist and playwright as well as a singer/songwriter. He was a prolific songwriter, drawing on his experiences of Glasgow life for much of his material. He was a communist, republican and trade unionist, and a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. His performances in clubs and concert halls were hugely popular. McGinn's earliest recording was in 1962 when he was featured on the Folkways Records Revival in Britain, Vol. 1a collection compiled by Ewan MacColl. He was also featured, alongside Bob Dylan and Pete Seeger, on the Broadside Ballads Vol. 1 released in 1963. McGinn was also included in the 2000 compilation The Best of Broadside 1962‚Äì1988, which was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Historical Album category in 2001. Matt McGinn embraced the \\"Folk Song Revival\\" of the 60s and brought to this his talent as a poet, his humour and his wealth of knowledge and experience of the ordinary folk of Glasgow and West of Scotland. It was never his ambition to be a singer/songwriter but considered tunes and melodies as a vehicle to express and propagate his beliefs and politics. Perhaps a recent description of him as a people's historian is fitting. McGinn brought together his musical abilities, perception, humour, knowledge, politics and personal experience, to leave a history in words and music of the life and times of Scottish people, in particular Glasgow and the West. McGinn also wrote songs for children, one of which, \\"Little Ticks of Time,\\" was frequently used in the BBC children's programme Play School and its offshoots such as Hokey Cokey. The song was also featured in the 2011 Franco-German film Goodbye First Love (French: Un amour de jeunesse) directed by Mia Hansen-L√∏ve. Well known recordings of McGinn include \\"Loch Lomond\\", ‚Ä≥The Rolling Hills of the Border‚Ä≥, ‚Ä≥I have seen the Highlands‚Ä≥, ‚Ä≥The Jeely Piece Song‚Ä≥ (written by another stalwart of Glasgow music, Adam McNaughtan), ‚Ä≥The Big Effen Bee‚Ä≥, ‚Ä≥Skinny Malinky Longlegs‚Ä≥, ‚Ä≥The Red Yo Yo‚Ä≥, ‚Ä≥Gallowgate Calypso‚Ä≥, ‚Ä≥The Ibrox Disaster‚Ä≥ and ‚Ä≥The Wee Kirkcudbright Centipede‚Ä≥. McGinn's first novel about his time in approved school Fry the Little Fishes was first published in 1975 () 2nd edition re- issued 2013 () There is a wealth of information about McGinn, as well as the words and music of some of his songs in the book McGinn of the Calton, collated by Janette McGinn, and originally published by Glasgow District Libraries in 1987 (). McGinn's songs are still performed by folk musicians in Scotland and America at tribute concerts. McGinn's songs have been recorded by Pete Seeger, The Weavers, Theodore Bikel, The Corries, Luke Kelly, The Chinese Man, The Ian Campbell Folk Group, Barry Dransfield & Rachel Unthank and the Winterset, among others. In Jim Hosking's 2018 movie An Evening with Beverly Luff Linn, McGinn's song \\"Why Did I Ever Become a Football Referee?\\" is sung by Craig Robinson, performing alongside Matt Berry. McGinn died on 5 January 1977 of smoke inhalation, aged 48 (12 days short of his 49th birthday) after falling asleep with a lit cigarette in his hand. The post mortem revealed that there was no trace of alcohol in McGinn's blood. In January 2019 a blue plaque for McGinn was installed in the Calton district of Glasgow's East End.

Description The community lies in the northwestern part of the state, northwest of the state capital at Salt Lake City, and west of the county seat at Brigham City. Utah State Route 30 runs through the center of the valley, generally from east to west. The valley is a roughly oval shape of about in length east to west and about north to south, covering a major portion of the western end of the county. Park Valley anchors the northern end of the Great Basin. The Raft River Mountains to the north mark the boundary between the Great Basin and the Snake River Plain. What is called the community of Park Valley includes name locations that used to be nearly separate communities, such as Rosette, Dove Creek, Muddy, Rosebud, and Kelton, as well as ones that have been almost forgotten by time, such as Ten-Mile, Clear Creek, Rosen Valley, Terrace, Golden, Matlin, and other lesser camps along the old railroad grade. Since all of these areas belong to a homogenous community, they are all known collectively as Park Valley. The valley center, or Park Valley proper, is the community center, which contains the church house, store, hotel, the park, and the schoolhouse. History In 1826, explorer Jedediah Smith passed through the area. In 1841, the Bartleson- Bidwell Party brought the first wagons through the valley. While the Transcontinental Railroad coming to Utah did not pass directly through the valley, its proximity played an important part in the settlement and development of the area. Settlement was apparently a result of surveys conducted for several miles on either side of the railroad right-of-way. Even before the rails were joined at Promontory on May 10, 1869, the effect of the railroad on Park Valley had begun. The first permanent settler was William P. (Cotton) Thomas, who migrated from Brigham City in 1869, and developed a cattle ranch near Dove Creek. The heavy growth of trees along the creek and the view of the valley inspired the name. The town experienced a minor boom in 1890 when gold was discovered. Climate According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Park Valley has a semi-arid climate, abbreviated \\"BSk\\" on climate maps.Climate Summary for Park Valley, Utah See also References External links Unincorporated communities in Box Elder County, Utah Unincorporated communities in Utah Populated places established in 1869 1869 establishments in Utah Territory ","title":"Park Valley, Utah"},{"id":"14417941","text":"Dutton Viaduct is a railway viaduct on the West Coast Main Line where it crosses the River Weaver and the Weaver Navigation between the villages of Dutton and Acton Bridge in Cheshire, England (), near Dutton Horse Bridge. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. The viaduct was built during 1836 and was completed on 9 December of that year. It was the longest viaduct on the Grand Junction Railway (GJR) and is an early example of a major railway viaduct. Its cost was ¬£54,440 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). The engineers were Joseph Locke and George Stephenson. The contractor was William Mackenzie. It was the first project for which Thomas Brassey submitted a tender but Mackenzie's estimate was ¬£5,000 lower. It is built in red sandstone and has 20 arches. The base of the viaduct pillars are splayed to give greater stability and of stone was used in its construction. The first GJR trains to carry passengers across the viaduct were run on 4 July 1837. Steel masts were added in the 1960s for electrification. The viaduct is high and long. The permitted speed on the viaduct is and, because of limited trackside clearance, the viaduct is a 'red zone prohibited area', meaning that workers are not permitted on the line when trains are running unless separated by a permanent fence. A 'near miss' incident was recorded in September 2017 when line-side contractors carrying out a structural inspection on the viaduct crossed the tracks between obsolete refuges in breach of the red zone regulations.

Carcinosarcomas are rare tumors, and can arise in diverse organs, such as the skin, salivary glands, lungs, the esophagus, pancreas, colon, uterus and ovaries. Four main hypotheses have been proposed for the cellular origins of carcinosarcoma, based largely on the pathology of the disease. First, the collision tumor hypothesis, which proposes the collision of two independent tumors resulting in a single neoplasm, based on the observation that skin cancers and superficial malignant fibrous histiocytomas are commonly seen in patients with sun-damaged skin; second, the composition hypothesis, which suggests that the mesenchymal component represents a pseudosarcomatous reaction to the epithelial malignancy; third, the combination hypothesis, which suggests that both the epithelial and mesenchymal components of the tumor arise from a common pluripotential stem cell that undergoes divergent differentiation; and fourth, the conversion/divergence hypothesis, which argues that the sarcomatous component of the tumor represents a metaplastic sarcomatous transformation of the epithelial component. Despite the remaining uncertainty on the mechanisms that generate these tumors, recent immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and molecular genetic studies suggest and favor the notion of monoclonality in carcinosarcoma. In addition, identical p53 and KRAS mutations have been identified in both epithelial and mesenchymal components of carcinosarcoma, findings that suggest an early alteration in the histogenesis of the tumor with late transformation or degeneration of the epithelial component into the sarcomatous component.

Usage Carcinomatosis is often restricted to tumors of epithelial origin, adenocarcinomas, while sarcomatosis describes the dissemination of tumors of mesenchymal origin, sarcomas. Lung Lymphangitic carcinomatosis When most tumors metastasize to the lung, they form distinct nodules, but about 7% spread through the lymph vessels of the lung. They may impair breathing in several ways; the lung becomes stiffer; blood vessels traveling alongside the distended lymph vessels become compressed. Miliary carcinosis A pattern of multiple small nodular metastases has been described as miliary carcinosis which has a radiographic appearance similar to miliary tuberculosis. Body cavities Any potential space may be seeded with tumor cells that grow along surfaces, but which may not invade below the surfaces. In rare cases, the joint spaces are affected. Peritoneal carcinomatosis Intestines with peritoneal carcinomatosis from gastric cancer, appearing as a grainy serosal surface. The lining of the abdominal cavity is a common site for surface dissemination. Ovarian carcinomas are common. Fluid produced by the cells can produce ascites which is typical in carcinomatosis, but less common in peritoneal sarcomatosis. Fluid can be serous as seen in primary peritoneal carcinoma or mucinous such as found in pseudomyxoma peritonei which is typically a tumor derived from the appendix. Pleural carcinosis Pleural carcinosis is associated with malignant pleural effusion and poor prognosis. Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis The meningeal covering of the central nervous system may be the site of tumor growth. Breast cancer, lung cancer and melanoma are the most common tumors. Treatment Colorectal cancer patients with peritoneal involvement can be treated with Oxaliplatin- or Irinotecan- based chemotherapy. Such treatment is not expected to be curative, but can extend the lives of patients.Joerg O W Pelz, Terence C. Chua, Jesus Esquivel, et al.

The ship was assigned by the War Shipping Administration for operation by the Bernuth Lembcke Co. and operated in the Atlantic and Mediterranean early in its career. Fort Lee was torpedoed and sunk by the in the Indian Ocean on 2 November 1944. Nine men aboard Fort Lee were killed during the attack. Three of the four successfully launched lifeboats were rescued by other ships within two weeks. The fate of the fourth lifeboat, with 16 men aboard, was unearthed by researchers in 2000. The boat had drifted over 10 weeks before landing on Japanese-held Sumba Island with three men remaining. All three perished in custody of the Japanese. Operational history Fort Lee (MC Hull #327) was laid down on 24 October 1942 at Sun Shipbuilding in Chester, Pennsylvania; launched on 25 February 1943; and delivered on 15 March 1943. After launching, Fort Lee initially operated in the Mediterranean and Atlantic. The ship departed New York on 28 May 1943 for Gibraltar, arriving in mid-June. In July, Fort Lee left Gibraltar and steamed for Avonmouth, which it reached later in the month. In mid-August, the tanker sailed from Liverpool and arrived at New York again on 28 August. Sinking and rescue In late October 1944, Fort Lee left Abadan, Iran, headed to Brisbane, Australia, with of Navy Bunker C fuel as well as rubber and some ores. Some time on 1 November 1944, under Kapit√§n zur See Kurt Freiwald spotted the tanker, sailing alone in a zig-zag pattern. After moving in a straight line path for a time, U-181 was able to get ahead of Fort Lee and in a position to fire upon her. At 20:02 on 2 November 1944, U-181 fired a single torpedo that hit Fort Lee under the port quarter and destroyed her boilers, stopping her engines and flooding the fire room. Two men in the engine room were killed by the torpedo. At 20:18, as lifeboats #3 and #5 were being lowered into the water, a second torpedo hit the starboard quarter. Two men aboard Fort Lee were killed by the second blast. Lifeboat #3 was destroyed by this torpedo, killing 6 of 7 men aboard, and lifeboat #5 was broken in half, dumping its men into the ocean. Lifeboats #1, #2, #4, and #6 were successfully launched and recovered the survivors from #3 and #5. Fort Lee succumbed to the attack stern first at 21:10. U-181 surfaced and intercepted the four remaining lifeboats, interrogating them as to cargo and destination. Although the crew refused to answer any questions, the U-boat‚Äôs skipper gave the Fort Lee crew a flare gun and flares, some blankets, food, and medicine, and allowed the boats to go on their way. The four boats were traveling within sight of each other for several days before lifeboat #4 with 16 men aboard disappeared from sight on 5 November. On 7 November, five days after the tanker went down, 16 men in lifeboat #2 ‚Äî including Master of the Fort Lee, Ottar Andersen ‚Äî were rescued by the British freighter and landed at Fremantle on 14 November. Two days later, 9 November, American tanker rescued the 17 men in lifeboat #6 and landed them at Albany on 14 November. On 16 November, two weeks after Fort Lee went down, the men in lifeboat #1 were rescued by American Liberty ship . The gunners on Mary Ball fired upon the lifeboat before identifying it. None of the 17 men aboard were injured. Mary Ball landed the survivors at Colombo, Ceylon on 24 November. By February 1945, all of the survivors had returned to the United States. Fate of lifeboat #4 For 57 years, the fate of lifeboat #4 and its occupants remained a mystery until Australian researcher Tom Hall discovered a reference to Fort Lee while researching Japanese war crimes committed against Allied prisoners of war (POWs) in what is now Indonesia. The story, as pieced together by Hall and M. Emerson Wiles III, an employee of the U.S. Army Central Identification Laboratory is that on 13 January 1945 ‚Äî two-and-a-half months after Fort Lee went down ‚Äî lifeboat #4, with only three men remaining, came ashore on the south side of Japanese-held Sumba, from where Fort Lee sank. One of the three men, Robert F. Lanning, a member of the Naval Armed Guard contingent aboard Fort Lee, was taken to Membora, on the north side of Sumba, where he died that same day. The names and fates of the other two men from lifeboat #4 are not known. Japanese records suggest that both men died in a Naval hospital within two weeks. But native and POW accounts suggest that the two men survived much longer. One account claims that they were executed, along with other Allied POWs, during a rampage by Japanese officers in September 1945, a month after the surrender of Japan.

These agents protect specific body parts from the harmful anti- cancer treatments that could potentially cause permanent damage to important bodily tissues. Chemo-protective agents have only recently been introduced as a factor involved with chemotherapy with the intent to assist those cancer patients that require treatment, which as an end result, improves the patients' quality of life. There have been a few studies on these agents though most of them come to the same conclusion, so what is known about them isn't very broad. Information including examples, risks, and more are the most researched aspects of Chemo protective agents. Amifostine; A common chemo- protective agent that has been approved by the FDA. Examples include: * Amifostine, approved by the FDA in 1995, which helps prevent kidney damage in patients undergoing cisplatin and carboplatin chemotherapy * Mesna, approved by the FDA in 1988, which helps prevent hemorrhagic cystitis (bladder bleeding) in patients undergoing cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide chemotherapy * Dexrazoxane, approved by the FDA in 1995, which helps prevent heart problems in patients undergoing doxorubicin chemotherapy  Risks  Chemo-protective agents are used to combat the negative effects of the chemotherapeutic medicine shown above. Chemo-protective agents are common drugs and like many other drugs, may have side effects of their own. Each agent has different side effects though the most common consist of dizziness, sleepiness, nausea, fever, etc. It is important to discuss the side effects of these drugs with a doctor before using them to combat any type of chemotherapy to insure the drug will benefit each and every patient.

In cases associated with PDGFRB, serum vitamin B12 and tryptase may be elevated.  Prognosis CEL associated with a mutation in PDGFRA is treatable with imatinib and has an excellent prognosis. On the other hand, CEL associated with FGFR1 mutations has a very poor prognosis. Progression can occur from CEL to AEL or AML in rare cases.  Epidemiology  Cases occur in people of all ages. The disease is more common in males than females.

It has about 1,300 inhabitants. The town is located on the outskirts of the Upper-Palatinate Forest at the upper Radbuza, and on the railway track between Doma≈ælice and Tachov. Administrative parts Adminitsrative parts of Hostou≈à are: Babice, Holubeƒç, Horou≈°any, Mƒõlnice, M√≠rkovice, P≈ôes, Ska≈ôez, Slatina, ≈†t√≠tary, Svr≈æno and Sychrov. History In 1238 the village was firstly mentioned in written records as a property of Gumpert of Hostou≈à. His descendants who ruled the area till the 15th century also processed the Palatinate town of Sch√∂nsee. During the Hussite Wars Citbor of Wolfstein, a supporter of Imperator Sigismund, was ruling in Hostou≈à. When the reign of the noble families of Wolfstein and Rabenstein came to an end the Dominion of Hostou≈à was taken over by the Lords of Guttenstein. In 1522 the village under Georg of Guttenstein was granted the right to hold markets. In 1587 Imperator Rudolf II awarded Hostou≈à the rank of a town and a coat of arms: A stannous wall with an open gate, above the wall two towers, between these a tripartite hatchment with a back deer head, a crowned lion and below a red area. Additionally in 1587 the town was granted to hold two other fairs and a horse market besides the annual Saint-James-Market as well. During the reformation Hostou≈à was temporarily Protestant. As a consequence of the Battle at the White Mountain the property of the Guttensteins was confiscated. The dominion was sold to Zdenko of Mitrowitz (1622), after a short period retailed to the family of Czernin and even in 1656 to the Counts of Trauttmansdorff- Weinsberg, who put their dominions Bischofteinitz and Hostou≈à together. Since 1805 Hostou≈à was seat of a deanery. The church of Saint James the Elder, since 1384 mentioned as a parish, was remodelled in baroque style in 1731 and rebuilt after the great fire in 1877. An in wood carved madonna derives from the first half of the 15th century and is adored as the \\"Shrine of the Sorrowful Mother of God of Hostou≈à\\". In 1915 an imperial military stud of Galicia and Bukowina was transferred to Hostou≈à. During the World War II parts of the famous Lipizzaner horses of the Spanish Riding School in Vienna were stationed in Hostou≈à. The stud's administrative offices had been housed in the former castle of the Prince of Trauttmansdorff in Hostou≈à. After the end of the World War II the Lipizzaner horses had been rescued by an adventures attempt of German and American soldiers. Since the 16th century a continuing inflow of German inhabitants could have been realized. From 1938 to 1945 it was one of the municipalities in Sudetenland. In 1946 the Germans still were the major ethnic group. In 1930 the population of Hostou≈à counted 1,048 inhabitants ‚Äì 160 Czechs, 8 foreigners and 880 German(-Bohemians). After the expulsion of the German population Hostou≈à only had 630 inhabitants in 1947. In addition Hostou≈à lost the rank of a town, finally got it back in 2006. Points of interest * Sanctus Jacobus Major was mentioned in written records firstly in 1384 (In Decanatu Horsoviensi et in Archidiaconatu Horsoviensi). In 1731 the church was remodelled in baroque style and was created a deanery in 1805. * The Assumption Chapel (Assumptio Beatae Mariae Virginis) was built in 1936 as a chapel for the cemetery by Susanna Kleinschmidt's donation. * The Corpus Christi Chapel was erected by the donation of Countess Kordula of Chudenitz honouring the miracle of consecrated hosts in Hostau during the 14th century. In 1805 the chapel was removed due its decrepit conditions. * The baroque rectory of the 18th century was rebuilt after the great fire in 1877, by which altogether 43 homes had been destroyed. * The princely castle of the Trauttmansdorff family was built as a triangle and was a hunting lodge, later the seat of the widow, Princess Anne of Trauttmansdoff-Weinberg. From 1916 on the castle was used as a military stud, then from 1918 as a regular stud. In the years 1942 to 1945 the Lipizzaner horses of the Spanish riding school were stationed here.

Saguisag was one of Estrada's eleven cabinet members who withdrew support for Estrada on January 19, 2001, following accusations of massive corruption by the president. Estrada was ousted from office the next day, which is now known in the Philippines as EDSA II. She also served as the secretary-general of the Gymnastics Association of the Philippines. Saguisag was the wife of a former Filipino Senator Rene Saguisag, who was in office from 1987 to 1992.  Early life  Dulce Saguisag was born Dulce Maramba Quintans on September 5, 1943. She received a bachelor's degree in social work from the University of the Philippines Diliman and placed third in the country in the 1964 National Board Examination for Social Workers. She initially began her career as in 1964 at the Social Welfare Administration, which is now called the Department of Social Welfare and Development. She held a position of senior social worker at the SWA until 1965, when she became a supervising social worker and community center director. Saguisag left the Philippines for the United States in 1967 after winning a grant by the US State Department to observe social work in the country. She was also recruited by the John F. Kennedy War on Poverty program while in the United States. Saguisag won a scholarship to Boston College where she received a master's degree in social work, with an emphasis on community organization and social planning, in 1969. She met her future husband, Rene Saguisag, a student at Harvard Law School, while studying at Boston College. The couple had two daughters and three sons during their marriage. Her hobbies included collecting angel and Santa Claus figurines and ballroom dancing with her husband.  Career  Upon receiving her master's degree, Saguisag returned to the Philippines. She took a job with the Department of Social Welfare and Development in 1971. She worked as a social welfare program specialist at the department before being promoted to assistant director of the Bureau of Family and Child Welfare. She left her position with the bureau in order to become dual director of human resources development and director of management training at the Development Academy of the Philippines in 1976. Saguisag once again left to take a new position, this time for an organization outside of the Filipino government. In 1984, she took a job with the Mondragon International Philippines, Inc. as a manager for human resource development. She stayed with the company until 1999. She was serving as Mondragon's vice chairperson and deputy chief executive officer at the time of her departure.  Secretary of the Department of Social Welfare and Development  Dulce Saguisag was appointed Secretary of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) by President Joseph Estrada in October 2000. Her appointment to Secretary of the DSWD followed the resignation of then Vice President and DSWD Secretary Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Arroyo had left the Estrada administration over the jueteng scandal which had plagued Estrada during his term. Saguisag accepted the Secretary position despite the objections of her husband, Rene Saguisag. He worried that the cabinet position would be too stressful to his wife, who had undergone successful breast cancer surgery in 1997. Saguisag became one of eleven of Estrada's cabinet members who withdrew support for the embattled President on January 19, 2001. Her decision to withdraw her support for the President came after allegations of massive government corruption against Estrada. Estrada was ousted from office the next day on January 20, 2001, which is now known as EDSA II in the Philippines. (Dulce Saguisag's husband, Rene Saguisag, later became Estrada's defense lawyer.)  Car accident  Dulce Saguisag was killed in a serious car accident on November 8, 2007, on President Osme√±a Highway in Makati City. Her husband, Rene Saguisag, was seriously injured in the accident. Two other people riding in the same Toyota Grandia van as the Saguisags, including Filipino dance instructor, Rhea Imelda Obong, and driver, Felipe Calvario, were also seriously injured in the accident. All four were rushed to Ospital ng Makati where Dulce Saguisag was pronounced dead from her injuries. The Toyota that Ducle Saguisag was riding in, which was travelling on Pasay Road, was struck by a dump truck at the corner of the President Osme√±a Highway in Makati City at about 2 A.M. The dump truck had reportedly been speeding when it ran a traffic light and struck the left side of the Saguisags' van, killing Dulce. Police arrested the driver of the dump truck at the scene of the accident. Dulce Saguisag's funeral was held on November 16, 2007.

Summary During the last phase of Ottoman rule in the Middle East, Rikabi occupied prominent positions. After the Ottoman Turks departed from Arab lands in 1918, he formed the first cabinet in the history of Syria under Prince Faisal, third son Sharif Hussain of Mecca. Later, during two periods (1922 and 1924-1926) as Prime Minister in Jordan, Rikabi established Jordan's administrative and financial system. He supported the Syrian revolt of 1925 against the French Mandate while he was Prime Minister of Jordan. During Ottoman Rule Ali Rida Pasha al-Rikabi came from a Damascene family whose ancestor had migrated from Rifa‚Äôi in southern Iraq during the seventeenth century. Rikabi obtained his primary education at the Rushdiya Military School and completed Secondary school in Damascus also. His extraordinary performance at school earned him recommendations to be sent to the Military College in Istanbul, where he studied military engineering and graduated as the youngest in his class with the rank of Staff Major. He was later appointed military commander of the Ottoman army and deputy governor in Jerusalem. When the Ottoman Constitution was proclaimed in 1908 he was appointed Head of Special Branch in Istanbul. From there he was transferred to al-Medina al-Munawara where he was appointed Governor and Military Commander after being promoted to the rank of Major General. He then went on to Iraq as Military Commander in Baghdad and Governor of Basra. On the eve of the First World the Ottoman Government consulted him, among other army commanders, about his opinion of Turkey's participation in the war along the side of its German ally. Rikabi advised the Ottoman Government to remain neutral in this European conflict because he was well aware of the poor condition of the Ottoman Army, its outdated weapons, insufficient ammunition and weak training. This advice led the ruling Triumvirate (Enver, Talat & Jamal), leaders of the Young Turks, to consider Rikabi a defeatist; so, he was dismissed into retirement from the army. Other officers and members of the Young Turks were enthusiastic in their drive to enter the war on the side of Germany, their friend and ally. When Rikabi returned to Damascus after his dismissal, Jamal Pasha appointed him Mayor of Damascus and Chief of Defences in order to utilise his knowledge and experience, while keeping him under close surveillance. Rikabi preferred to accept these two positions to ward off suspicions, as he was in fact one of the founders of the first two secret organisations that planted the seeds of Arab Nationalism under Ottoman rule, namely ‚ÄòThe Young Arab Society‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe Covenant Society‚Äô. Arab Kingdom: After the Arab Revolt (1916) and the Ottoman defeat by the British army, the allies entered Damascus on 1 October 1918 with King Faisal, and the Arab kingdom of Syria created at Damascus. On 3 October 1918 Ali Rida Rikabi was appointed Military Governor of Arab Kingdom of Syria, and Chief of the Council of Directors (i.e. prime minister) of Syria under Prince Faisal son of King Hussain of Mecca. First Syrian Cabinet On 8 March 1920 the First Syrian Conference (representative body) announced Syria's independence and proclaimed Faisal as King. Rikabi became the first Prime Minister of Syria. From a base in Lebanon, the French Army under General Gouraud attacked the small Syrian volunteer force assembled in Maysaloon, defeated them, entered Damascus, proclaimed the French Mandate over Syria and Lebanon and forced King Faisal to leave Syria immediately. Rikabi in Jordan When Rikabi felt he could no longer participate in Syrian politics under the French Mandate, he travelled from Damascus to Egypt, where he left his family and went on to Mecca to meet King Hussain of Hejaz. The latter directed him to proceed to Jordan and assist his second son, Prince Abdullah, in the administration of the Principality of Transjordan, newly formed under the British Mandate. In Amman, Prince Abdullah commissioned Rida Rikabi to form his first Jordanian cabinet in March 1922. So, he took up the task of setting suitable laws and regulations for the new State, particularly in administration and financial management. In October of that year he accompanied Prince Abdullah to London for conducting a treaty between Britain and Jordan and discussions of Arab Affairs thereat. After Prince Abdullah left, Rikabi remained in London to reach an agreement with the British authorities on the formulation of the Government of Transjordan. Rikabi succeeded in obtaining Britain's approval for parliamentary independence of the State, and in excluding Jordan from the Balfour Declaration (by which Britain promised to establish a Jewish state in Palestine). After Rikabi returned to Jordan, Prince Abdullah objected to some terms of this agreement prompting Rikabi to resign. In early 1924, Prince Abdullah invited Ali Rida Rikabi to form a new Jordanian cabinet, this time on the advice of King Faisal of Iraq, Abdullah's younger brother who had ruled briefly in Syria. Rikabi declared his cabinet's program for promoting justice among all citizens, economic reform, employing competent civil servants, eradicating corruption and ensuring security. Whilst such a program may seem rudimentary nowadays, it was a novelty when new Arab states were being established in the aftermath of four dark centuries under Ottoman oppression that only ended after World War 1. During Rikabi's second term as Prime Minister of Jordan, he secretly supported the Syrian Revolt against French rule. This was strongly backed by King Faisal of Iraq, overruling his elder brother Prince Abdullah on matters concerning the policies of his Prime Minister Rikabi, who set tactical plans for the Syrian Revolt, received Syrian casualties in Jordan and channelled Iraqi assistance to Syrian fighters. After the Syrian Revolt was crushed by the French Rikabi resigned from the prime ministership of Jordan because it became once more impossible for him to work with Prince Abdullah. Final Years When Rikabi left Jordan in 1926 he lived as a private citizen for a few years in Jerusalem and Haifa because the French banned him from entry to Syria for a few years before he could return to Damascus. In 1932 he coordinated efforts with King Faisal of Iraq, established the Royal Party and ran for President of Syria. The French heavily supported his rival and Rikabi lost the elections. He spent the last ten years of his life in seclusion at home, under constant harassment from the French and their agents. His health soon began failing and he died a destitute man in May 1942.

In this technique, a plate of selenium, which rests on a thin layer of aluminium oxide, is charged uniformly by passing it in front of a scorotron. The process was developed by engineer Dr. Robert C. McMaster in 1950. As X-ray photon impinges on this amorphous coat of selenium, charges diffuse out, in proportion to energy content of the X-ray. This occurs as a result of photoconduction. The resulting imprint, in the form of charge distribution on the plate, attracts toner particles, which is then transferred to reusable paper plates. In contrast to conventional X-rays, photographic developers are not needed. Hence the term xeroradiography; 'xero' meaning dry in Greek. It requires more radiation exposure.

It has about 2,800 inhabitants. It lies 440 m above sea level in the valley of Klabava River which is also known as Padr≈•sk√Ω potok. North of Hr√°dek, large forested massif of ≈Ωƒè√°r (629 m above sea level) with its lateral elevation of Hr√°deck√Ω vrch (549 m above sea level) delineates northern border of the Klabava valley while in the south relatively mild slopes form large plateau where most of Hr√°dek's built-up area lies. The most prominent elevation in the southern section of the valley is Svat√Ω Vojtƒõch hill (513 m above sea level). Hr√°dek together with Rokycany and Kamenn√Ω √öjezd belongs to the contiguous urban area along the Klabava valley. Main artery of this urban concentration being road from Rokycany to Miro≈°ov that runs along Hr√°dek's western periphery. Another road connecting Rokycany and Stra≈°ice via Dob≈ô√≠v runs north of Hr√°dek. Demography As to ethnicity, Hr√°dek was traditionally a Czech settlement. In 1890 population of Hr√°dek was 448, village of Nov√° Hu≈• had population of 215 then. In 20th century population steadily grew. After World War II massive housing project of completely new town of Hr√°dek was started and population reached more than 3,000.

Village of Hr√°dek was mentioned as early as 1325. The king John of Bohemia donated Hr√°dek to Petr of Rosenberg then. Village of Nov√° Hu≈• was located ca. 1 km to the east of Hr√°dek. Since Middle Ages the Klabava Valley region specialized in iron ore mining and iron production. This industrial aspect was further strengthened in the 20th century when both communities (Hr√°dek and Nov√° Hu≈•) formed functionally one settlement with their economy centered around the Hr√°deck√© ≈æelez√°rny steelworks. Later both villages merged into one under name of Hr√°dek. After World War II, local steelworks have expanded filling most of the area along the Klabava River. These investments were accompanied by massive residential construction that completely transformed Hr√°dek. New housing project grew in area between old Hr√°dek and Nov√° Hu≈• villages covering the plateau south of Klabava river. Architecture of earlier stages of this new tenement houses district was inspired by Socialist realism. Main axis of new Hr√°dek is a wide avenue (1.m√°je Street) leading from Nov√° Hu≈• to the southeast where it ends in central square (9.kvƒõtna Square) with community center, department store and other public facilities. Rapid population growth followed and Hr√°dek acquired urban character. In 1975 Hr√°dek was officially declared a town.

Early life  Patriarch Abune Basilios was born Gebre Giyorgis Wolde Tsadik in Mada Mikael, a village in the district of Merhabete in Shewa. Memhir Wolde Tsadik Solomon, his father, was a respected ecclesiastical official. In his home town Gebre Giyorgis received an elementary education at the local church then entered the Monastery of Debre Libanos where he received advanced religious education. He took the Holy Orders and became a monk at the age of 21. For the next 12 years he served in the same monastery. He went on to be appointed administrator of various churches in Ethiopia, most notably the Church of St. Mary at Menagesha. In early 1923 he was nominated Head of the Ethiopian Churches and Monasteries in Jerusalem with the title of \\"Memhir\\". Memhir Abba Gebre Giyorgis remained in Jerusalem for two years, where he gained the theological knowledge to become Ichege of the Debre Libanos Monastery in 1933. (At the time this was the highest rank open to an Ethiopian within the church, for the office of Abuna, or archbishop, was always a cleric of the Coptic Church). During the Italian invasion, Ichege Gebre Giyorgis accompanied Emperor Haile Selassie and the Ethiopian troops to the Battle of Maychew; following the defeat in that battle the Ichege accompanied the Emperor back to Addis Ababa and participated in the decision of the Emperor to go into exile and present Ethiopia's case to the League of Nations. During the Italian occupation, Ichege Gebre Giyorgis lived in exile in Jerusalem, where he remained in touch with the Arbegnoch, or resistance fighters inside Ethiopia. During the Italian occupation, the Coptic Archbishop of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, \\"Abune\\" Kerrilos had initially submitted to Italian rule. Later, the Archbishop returned to Egypt and denounced the Italian occupation, and the Italians then un-canonically appointed the Ethiopian born Bishop of Gojjam, \\"Abune\\" Abraham as the new Archbishop of the Ethiopian Orthodox church in 1937, and allowed him to anoint new Bishops without the sanction of the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria. Upon \\"Abune\\" Abraham's death the Italian authorities replaced him with \\"Abune\\" Yohannes as Archbishop. Neither the Patriarch in Egypt, nor the Emperor living in exile in Britain recognized these Archbishops appointed by the Italians. However, the exiled Imperial court also regarded the exiled \\"Abune\\" Kerrilos as having first collaborated with the enemy and then abandoned his flock. At the eve of Emperor Haile Selassie's return to Ethiopia, the Coptic ecclesiastical authorities suggested that the current Abuna, Kerrilos accompany the Emperor on his entrance into Ethiopia; the offer was declined and the Ichege selected instead. As Margary Perham notes, \\"The photographs of that dramatic moment when the Emperor stepped across the frontier in the wild region of the Upper Dinder and unfurled his flag, show the Icheg√©, a fine figure of a man in his flowing black ceremonial robes, standing beside him.\\"Perham, The Government of Ethiopia, second edition (London: Faber and Faber, 1969), p. 126 Following the liberation of Ethiopia in 1941, due to the Emperor's refusal to receive or recognize \\"Abune\\" Yohannes as Archbishop of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, and the refusal of the clergy at large to countenance the return of \\"Abune\\" Kerrilos, \\"Ichege\\" Gebre Giyorgis acted as the chief administering cleric of the Ethiopian Church while negotiations were undertaken to regularize the status of the church with the Coptic Patriarchate. Ichege Gebre Giyorgis was consecrated by the Coptic Pope Yussab II as Archbishop of Ethiopia with the name and style of Abuna Basilios July 1948 during a ceremony held at the Patriarchate of Saint Mark in Egypt. In 1950, on the death in Cairo of Abuna Kerrillos, \\"Abune\\" Basilios became the head of the Church of Ethiopia, with the full authority to nominate bishops and archbishops. During a solemn ceremony in 1959 at which His Majesty Emperor Haile Selassie was present, he was consecrated the first Patriarch Catholicos of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church by the Coptic Pope Kirillos VI at St. Mark's Cathedral in Cairo. Reign as Patriarch Abune Basilios was regarded as a conservative and traditionalist figure within the church, in contrast to his eventual successor Abuna Theophilos who was then Archbishop of Harar and regarded as a modernist and a reformer. Patriarch Abune Basilios regarded all innovation with deep suspicion. Abune Basilios was a deeply pious man, greatly focused on prayer and fasting, and as such left more and more of his duties to Abuna Theophilos who acted as his deputy, and later as acting Patriarch when Abune Basilios' health began to deteriorate after 1963. Abuna Basilios was one of the few people who although very respectful of the Emperor, was not so in awe of him as to keep his true views or feelings from the Emperor. Known to always be forthright and open with the monarch, he never hesitated from telling the Emperor the truth or his own views even if he knew they might not please the Emperor. When the Patriarch believed that actions of the government or the Emperor himself were contrary to what he thought to be right, he would threaten to seclude himself at the monastery of Debre Libanos, a threat that the Emperor took seriously and which often changed the Emperor's mind. The Patriarch served on the Crown Council, and was considered among the most influential of the Emperor's advisors. In 1960, the Imperial Guard (Kebur Zabagna) launched a coup attempt against the Emperor while he was on a state visit to Brazil. The Imperial Guard announced that the Emperor and his government were deposed, that Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen (Amha Selassie) would serve as a constitutional monarch, and that reforms would be implemented. The Imperial Army however came out in opposition to the coup as did the Imperial Airforce. The coup leaders, Brigadier General Mengistu Neway and his brother Girmame Neway sent emissaries to explain their acts to the Patriarch. Abuna Basilios refused to recognize this act and proclaimed that the Imperial Guard had no authority to depose an Emperor who had been anointed by the Church, and pronounced an anathema against those who took part or supported the coup. His statement was printed and scattered over Addis Ababa by Army helicopters. The Army and Air Force used this proclamation to rally support for the Emperor and the coup was crushed. In order to make sure that no Imperial Army units deserted to the other side, the Patriarch had toured the barracks of the 4th Division in Addis Ababa and promised that the soldiers, who had long complained of poor pay, would receive a significant raise when the Emperor returned. Upon his return, Emperor Haile Selassie was told of the Patriarch's promise to the soldiers, but stated such a raise could not be honored at the time because there simply wasn't enough money in government coffers to do so. Angry at this, Abuna Basilios made good on previous threats and secluded himself at Debre Libanos Monastery in protest. The Emperor went personally to Debre Libanos and persuaded the Patriarch to return to Addis Ababa, and granted a smaller raise to the soldiers to appease the Patriarch. Final Years Abuna Basilios began to spend an increasing amount of time at the Debre Libanos monastery after his health began to fail in the early 1960s. He left more and more of his duties to Abuna Theophilos, and spent more time resting and praying at the monastery, rarely making an appearance at the Patriarchate in Addis Ababa or at the Imperial Court. He was too frail to participate in the Conference of the Oriental Orthodox Churches held in Addis Ababa in 1965, and deputized Abuna Theophilos to represent him in most of its sessions. Patriarch \\"Abune\\" Basilios, the first Patriarch and Catholicos of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church, died on October 13, 1970. Following a state funeral at Holy Trinity Cathedral in Addis Ababa, attended by the Emperor, the entire Imperial family, members of the Imperial Court and the government of Ethiopia, as well as the diplomatic corps and representatives of various other Churches, Abuna Basilios was buried at Debre Libanos Monaster. He was succeeded by Abuna Theophilos as Patriarch of Ethiopia.

Maurer (born July 20, 1924) is an American industrial physicist noted for his leadership in the invention of optical fiber. Early life Maurer was born either in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, or by other accounts in Richmond Heights, Missouri. In 1943 he enlisted in the United States Army Reserve and began studies at the University of Arkansas. He was quickly called up for active service, and studied preengineering for about one year at the Huntsville, Texas, state college. In 1944 he shipped overseas with the 99th infantry division for combat in France and Belgium along the German border. He was wounded by a landmine, spending more than 20 months in the hospital before receiving a disability discharge with Purple Heart. Supported by the GI Bill, Maurer returned in 1946 to the University of Arkansas to study chemical engineering, but quickly switched to physics. He graduated with a B.S. in physics in 1948, then performed graduate work at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he measured second sound velocity in liquid helium. He took his orals in summer 1951, and graduated with a physics PhD in the winter class. Corning In 1952 Maurer joined the physics department of Corning Glass Works, becoming manager of its applied physics group in 1960, and ultimately research fellow in 1978. He retired from Corning Incorporated in 1989. Around 1966 Maurer learned of Charles K. Kao's pioneering work in optical fibers at the Standard Telephones and Cables company in the United Kingdom, and initiated a project to develop such fibers at Corning. In 1970 Maurer and his colleagues Donald Keck and Peter C. Schultz designed and produced the first fiber with optical losses low enough for use in telecommunications by a novel process of depositing titania-doped silica inside a quartz tube using a flame-hydrolysis process and sintering, then fusing it to draw into fiber. They demonstrated optical loss as low as 20 dB/km, which for the first time indicated a practical technology. Honours and awards Maurer is an elected member of the National Academy of Engineering (1979) and inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame (1993), and a fellow of the American Ceramic Society, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and American Physical Society, and has received numerous honors including the American Institute of Physics' 1978 Prize for Industrial Physics, the 1978 IEEE Morris N.

Captured on September 14, 2007 in Ankara, he admitted killing two men, attempting to murder another man and cannibalising one of his victims. He is nicknamed the \\"Cannibal of Ankara\\". Early years √ñzg√ºr Dengiz was born to Satƒ±lmƒ±≈ü, a non-commissioned officer and veteran of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, and Sultan, a seamstress. He fought with his parents constantly, and often ran away from home. He did not continue his education after finishing middle school. When he was 17, he killed one of his friends during an argument, and was sentenced to a reduced 10-year sentence in prison due to his young age. His father was the one who turned him in to police. He served three years of the sentence before being pardoned by President Ahmet Necdet Sezer. He then joined the army at his father's insistence. During his military service, he was hospitalized several times for psychological problems. Dengiz attempted to escape the military multiple times, and due to fail attempts his aggression increased. After completing his service, he returned to Ankara. His mother opened a tailor shop for him; however, he did not stop by even briefly.Newspaper Milliyet September 16, 2007 Crimes On June 5, 2007 Dengiz killed Sedat Erzurumlu, a computer engineer, who angered him by saying that he couldn't afford to buy the laptop he had been looking at. Newspaper Today's Zaman September 17, 2007 Dengiz stole two laptops from the store, and took also his victim's mobile phone with him. Later on, Dengiz tried to sell one of the laptops, but was cheated out of the money. He kept the other one at home. On September 12, 2007, Dengiz shot a garbage collecter at the Mamak Dump. A few hours later, he met Cafer Er, a 55-year-old municipal worker, and killed him after a brief conversation by shooting him in the head twice from behind. He dragged his victim's body and put it in his car. Then, he skinned the corpse with a cleaver; he ate some of it raw and put the rest in his bag. He wrapped the body in a cloth and put it in the trunk. He abandoned the corpse at the Mamak Dump and returned to the apartment he shared with his parents. He gave a piece of flesh to stray dogs outside his apartment. He then put the remaining flesh in the refrigerator. Capture Cafer Er had been missing for days when his corpse was discovered in the Mamak Dump. On closer examination, it became apparent that he had been murdered, his body mutilated and large chunks of flesh cut from the soft parts of his body. Further investigation revealed that Er had last been seen arguing with a young man in the park he was responsible for keeping clean. The police soon traced Dengiz with the help of recording of calls Dengiz made with the mobile phone he had stolen from his second victim Erzurumlu, but lost at the last murder scene.Newspaper Milliyet September 16, 2007 They conducted a search of his apartment for evidence, and discovered fresh meat in a plastic bag in the refrigerator. They took samples for analysis, which proved the positive identification of a human arm, buttock and thigh. Questioning, arrest, and conviction Dengiz showed no remorse for his crimes, saying he was irresistibly drawn to eating human flesh. The only emotion he is said to have exhibited as he explained his behavior was to break into fits of laughter. He said he would have kept killing had he not been caught. After making his statement, Dengiz was arrested by the court. He was later found guilty of 2 murders, and sentenced to 2 life sentences. However, the Court of Cassation of Turkey ruled that Dengiz was insane, and not fit to stand accused.

Water and a powder must be mixed in a shaker and after turning the shaker the mixture flows into moulds inside the shaker. Because of fast polymerisation the consistency of the mixture becomes like pudding in seconds. After some days it hardens. Shaker Maker was invented in the 1970s of the firm Ideal Toy Company. The toy was primarily sold in the US and some countries in Europe. In the 1990s and the 2000s there were two relaunches of Shaker Maker but these met with less success. Principle Magic Mix in blue, pink and ivory Shaker Maker is a toy for children aged four years and older which makes it easy for them to make their own toy figures. The base element is a powder called \\"Magic Mix\\" which comes in a range of colours. After mixing with water it has to be shaken. After some seconds the shaker has to be turned so that the mixture can flow into a mould which is installed in the shaker. After five to ten minutes the mixture hardens, and the figures are ready to be taken out of their mould and placed on a drying stand. The figures shrink dramatically as they dry, and final drying can take another few days. When the figures are completely dry they can be painted and decorated. History First created by ALLEN GREENBERG and licensed to the Ideal Toy Company, it appeared in stores in the early 1970s.

It has a population of about 2,100. Etymology In Czech, Hranice means \\"border\\". The old German name, Rossbach, means \\"horse brook\\". Following the partition of Germany, a border tripoint (between Czechoslovakia, West and East Germany) was situated near the town, for which the village of Trojmez√≠ (literally \\"Tripoint\\") is named. In fact, the village is also the tripoint of the three historical regions of Bohemia, Bavaria and Saxony. Geography Hranice lies twelve kilometres north of A≈°, in the northernmost part of the region, at about 575 meters above sea level. The villages of Trojmez√≠ and Koz√≠ H≈ôbety to the west of the town, Kr√°s≈àany to the east, Pastviny to the southwest, and Stud√°nka and Novosedly to the south are parts of Hranice. It neighbors the German towns of Bad Elster to the southeast, Gettengr√ºn to the northeast, and Ebmath to the north. The municipality of Hranice, besides Hranice proper, includes villages of Pastviny, Stud√°nka and Trojmez√≠. History The first written mention of Hranice dates to 1413, when the town was bought by the House of Zedtwitz. Before that time, Hranice was the property of the Neubergs. At the end of the 14th century, the Neubergs ran into financial trouble and sold the town. The House of Zedwitz controlled Hranice and the whole region around A≈° for almost 500 years. In 1542, Lutheranism first appeared in the village. In 1633, the bubonic plague killed forty people in the town. In 1822 a new school was built; in 1850, a post office was opened; and in 1868, the first fire squad was established. Textile industry In the 19th century, the textile industry expanded rapidly in the region, including in Hranice. Beginning in 1806, a local textile factory was one of the most successful in Bohemia. In 1840, however, a plan to build a new road through the town was rejected by the local council. Because Hranice had no railway connection and only bad roads, the textile industry there began to decline. Two new railway routes ‚Äì one from A≈° to Hranice (established in 1885) and the other from Hranice to Adorf (established in 1906) ‚Äì helped local industry greatly. Landmarks Buildings Notable buildings in Hranice include the Evangelic Church, built in the 14th century, and the Catholic Church of the Virgin Mary, built in 1894. Memorials Hranice contains a World War I memorial, built in 1928, along with a World War II memorial and a memorial to a Royal Air Force pilot who crashed in the area during World War II.

Method of image formation in photofluorography  X-ray beams from the tube get attenuated by the patient producing a transmitted radiation intensity corresponding to the part of the body traversed by the X-ray beam. Transmitted intensities now fall on the photocathode stimulating it to produce electrons in quantities external to the light intensities emitted by the input. This is caused by the formation of a light image of the transmitted radiation pattern. Electrons from the photocathode are accelerated and focused electronically out on the output phosphor which emits light as a result of electron bombardment. This shows a magnified image of what appears on the input phosphor. The semitransparent mirror splits the image in which one part is focused by the camera lens onto the film to form the image. The image size depends on the focal length of the camera lens. At the same time, the TV camera lens focuses the light to form an image on the TV camera photoreceptor where the image is transformed to a complex electronic signal and sent to the electronic image distributor. This then passes the image to the various display or recording devices, e.g. a videotape recorder, kinescope, TV, or display.

During the Nazi Occupation of Poland she assumed the name Barbara Zawisza. Irena and her husband Jerzy lived at different addresses in order to avoided being arrested by the Gestapo. She started service as an Intelligence agent in the intelligence unit \\"Zach√≥d\\" (\\"West\\"). These assignments were to conduct military, economic and information reconnaissance. Department II of Organizacja Wojskowa ZwiƒÖzek Jaszczurczy, in agreement with Department of ZwiƒÖzek Walki Zbrojnej ‚Äì Armia Krajowa, controlled sub-section \\"Zach√≥d\\". Speaking German fluently, Irena went to Berlin, where the contact point of branch of sub-section \\"Zach√≥d\\" was located. Between 1941 and 1942, her section was destroyed by the Germans. The outcome of this action were the numerous arrests of underground activists. Irena was arrested by the Gestapo on 7 October 1942. They placed her at Pawiak. She underwent harsh interrogations but revealed nothing. Other colleagues, knowing her role in intelligence, sent her a vial of cyanide, but she didn't use it. Her husband arranged for her to be freed from prison. A bribed guard put her in the group of non-political prisoners to be transported to the Majdanek camp. While there, a group of NSZ fighters from Pomerania freed her from the camp. Dressed in Gestapo uniforms, they came to the camp and presented a falsified document saying that Irena was to be brought to Warsaw for more interrogation. This event was documented in a Delegatura RzƒÖdu report. After a short stay in the Lublin area, Irena found herself in Klarysek-Jan√≥wek. Later she came back to Warsaw and stayed with Dr. Mi≈Çodroska at Filtrowa street. She started working on the Soviet intelligence network in Poland. Her husband was to be sent to London as the representative of TNRP (command of the National Armed Forces). He wanted to take her with him, but the command decided against it. She was to be sent with Tadeusz Salski (\\"Jan\\"). Nine days before the trip, on the night of 4 October 1943, Irena was summoned to a meeting on an important issue. She suspected a provocation, but thinking it too important, went to the meeting. In case she did not return, she asked Dr. Mi≈Çodroska to notify her contact. Irena was murdered in unknown circumstances. Jerzy, her husband, started searching for her and found her body in the infirmary at Oczki street. Her body was found in Pole Mokotowskie. Irena's murderers remain unknown. In the days before her death she was involved in intelligence activities against a radio contact point in Otwock which actively supported Soviet parachutists sent to Poland. Accusations were directed at the NKVD or the PPR. Irena was buried at PowƒÖzki under the name of Barbara Zawisza. Because the Gestapo often sent agents to family funerals (and other ceremonies), her husband participated in the ceremony dressed as a gravedigger and her mother as cemetery helper. In 1948 her mother placed a plaque with Irena's true name on her grave. On 20 May 1944, by order of the commander of the National Armed Forces, Irena was promoted to second Lieutenant. In 1995 she was posthumously decorated with the Krzy≈º Narodowego Czynu Zbrojnego (nr 1-95-59). Bibliography *Sylwetki kobiet-≈ºo≈Çnierzy.

The Fosters had come to Ireland from Cumberland in the previous century, and had acquired lands and political influence in Louth. He was Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer 1766-1777. Prior to appointment to the Bench he represented the family constituency of Dunleer in the Irish House of Commons from 1738 to 1761 and subsequently Louth from 1761 to 1767.Ball, F.

He entered Middle Temple in 1726 and was called to the Irish Bar in 1732. He became King's Counsel in 1760 and acted as counsel to the Board of Revenue; unlike many of his judicial colleagues he never held office as a Law Officer or as Serjeant-at-law. As a member of Parliament he worked hard to promote the interests of the manufacturers of Irish linen ;Ball p.161 there is no reason to doubt the sincerity of his belief in this cause (it fits well with his known interest in the improvement of agriculture), although Elrington Ball rather cynically notes that his support for the linen manufacturers brought him rich rewards, including a gold box. As an orator (which was a much-prized skill among the Irish public figures of his time) he was badly thought of, being described as \\"slow, sleepy and charmless\\". Family and personal life He married firstly Elizabeth Burgh, daughter of William Burgh in 1736; she died in 1744. They had three children: * John Foster, 1st Baron Oriel, the last Speaker of the Irish House of Commons. * William Foster, who was successively Bishop of Cork and Ross, Bishop of Kilmore and Bishop of Clogher. * Margaret Foster who married Henry Maxwell, successively Dean of Kilmore, Bishop of Dromore and Bishop of Meath.

He built an impressive country seat, Collon House, which was much added to by his son and heir, John, Lord Oriel. Anthony had a keen interest in agricultural development, and his improvements at Collon were described as being \\"of a magnitude never before attempted\\". Collon became famous for its great variety of trees and shrubs and its cider orchard. Reputation Foster was not regarded as the most outstanding lawyer on the Irish Bench in his lifetime, but it has been argued that he was its most gifted member overall, with his wide-ranging interests in law, politics, trade and agriculture. If he has been largely forgotten, this may be because his reputation was eclipsed by that of his even more gifted son, John.

William Haldimand Life He was the son of Anthony Francis Haldimand (1741‚Äì1817), a London merchant, nephew and heir of Sir Frederick Haldimand. He was one of twelve children, most of whom died young, and was born in London 9 September 1784. At sixteen he entered his father's counting-house, showed talent for business, and at twenty-five became a director of the Bank of England. Haldimand was an advocate of the resumption of specie payments, and gave evidence in the parliamentary inquiry which led to the act of 1819. In 1820 he was elected Member of Parliament for Ipswich, and was re-elected in 1826, but when the return was disputed he gave up the seat. In 1828 Haldimand settled permanently at his summer villa, Denantou, near Lausanne. He supported Greek independence, sending the insurgents of the Greek War of Independence funds by his nephew, and guaranteeing Admiral Thomas Cochrane ¬£20,000 to equip a fleet. A visit to Aix-les-Bains for his health resulted in his erecting there in 1829 a hospital for poor patients. The municipality gave it his name; but after the annexation of Savoy to France from the Kingdom of Piedmont- Sardinia, it was styled the Hortense Hospital, Queen Hortense having endowed it. Purchases of French rentes, made to strengthen the new Orleans dynasty, involved Haldimand in losses. He gave ¬£24,000 for a blind asylum at Lausanne, with more after his death, and ¬£3,000 towards the erection of an Anglican church at Ouchy. Inclined to radicalism in politics, and to scepticism in religion, he nevertheless exerted himself in favour of the free church in Vaud, threatened with state persecution. He died unmarried at Denantou on 20 September 1862 aged 78.

History The church was built from 1887 to 1897 as a memorial to the merchant and civil leader George W. South. The church was designed by Charles Marquedant Burns (1838 ‚Äì 1922), a prominent church architect in the late 19th and early 20th century. It was intended to serve as the Episcopal Cathedral of Philadelphia.Listing as a National Historic Landmark at the National Park Service. On July 29, 1974, the church was the site of the ordination of the Philadelphia Eleven, the first women priests in the Episcopal Church.\\"Woman in the News: Advocate of Equality, Barbara C.

They were painted between 1973 and 1976 by Philadelphia artist Walter EdmondsPhiladelphia artist Walter Edmonds, 73, died of a heart attack Sunday, June 12, 2011 at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. In a review of \\"Biennial 2000: At the Crossroads,\\" at the African American Museum in Philadelphia, Inquirer art critic Edward J. Sozanski wrote that Mr. Edmonds was among those in the show who were prominent enough that their \\"absence would be conspicuous.\\" Edmonds was well known for his work at the Church of the Advocate in North Philadelphia. From 1973 to 1976 Edmonds and the artist Richard Watson, at the invitation of the Rev. Paul M. Washington, the longtime pastor of that Episcopal congregation, painted 14 murals inside the church. In 2003, an Inquirer reporter wrote that they were still significant because of the \\"hallucinatory imagery that connects the Bible and the black experience of slavery and uprising - flaming heads and spurting blood, along with heroes ranging from Nat Turner and Harriet Tubman to Malcolm X.\\" The murals were also the centerpiece for \\"North & Beyond: The Mural Cycle,\\" a 2003 multimedia performance at the church that followed a similar 2002 event there titled \\"North Called Home.\\" In 2000, The Inquirer reported that the National Endowment for the Arts had given a $10,000 grant to the Perkins Center for the Arts in Moorestown for a public mural in East Camden. Edmonds was \\"in charge of the community process for the project,\\" the story reported. He painted murals at the West Philadelphia Regional Library in 1989 and at Frankford High School in 2004, among others. The mural at the library was titled Adventures in Reading. In 1996, he was a recipient of the Giverny Terra Fellows Program where he studied French Impressionalists. While he was in Giverny, France, he passionately painted in the gardens of Claude Monet. Mural painting was not his only medium. In 2003, his etchings were in a group show at Artists' House Gallery, on Second Street north of Market Street. Three years earlier, Sozanski had reported that the gallery had staged \\"a tribute to the centennial of the Philadelphia Orchestra\\" in a group show by 14 artists with \\"small etchings of musicians\\" by Edmonds. In 2002, a report about the annual Open Studios Tour noted that Edmonds had invited the public to his workplace to \\"view his colorful landscape paintings, prints, and sculpture.\\" Born in Philadelphia, Edmonds graduated from what is now Bok Technical High School in 1956. He attended what is now the University of the Arts in 1962, the Fleisher Art Memorial in 1975, and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1992. A 1972 Philadelphia Daily News story reported that at that time he was administrator of the Mantua Halfway House, 428 N. 38th St. The outpatient program there was started four years earlier by the Young Great Society, a neighborhood organization. His resume shows that Edmonds completed murals at the Halfway House, one titled Promise of Tomorrow in 1970 and one titled Struggle for Life in 1973. In the 1960s, he was employed by the City of Philadelphia as a City Surveyor. Obituary - Philadelphia Inquirer, Saturday, June 18, 2011 The murals can be found primarily in the transepts and aisles of the church. Father Washington commissioned the murals in response to black parishioners who felt that the African-American experience was not validated in the church despite the fact that the majority of the community was African- American. Each of the fourteen murals was painted by either Edmonds or Watson, each of whom has a very different artistic style. Edmonds's pieces are mostly in fiery shades of orange and yellow and depict the violent oppression of blacks in America. Watson, on the other hand, used a cooler palette in his paintings to express sorrow in the black experience and the importance of memorializing this history as a way to find courage for the future. The church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, and was designated a National Historic Landmark on June 19, 1996. The landmark designation cited the church as one of the finest examples of Gothic Revival architecture, with a complete set of stained glass windows provided by the English firm Clayton & Bell. It also cited the church's ongoing role in activism for African American civil rights. The Church of the Advocate serves as host space for Art Sanctuary, a Black art performance program in the heart of the Black community.

[3][2] Grades III and grade IV are considered malignant astrocytomas. Anaplastic astrocytomas are considered by the WHO to be a grade III astrocytoma and Glioblastoma is a grade IV both are referred to high-grade glial tumors.[2] ependymal tumors are another glial tumor type of the central nervous system. These are tumors which have cells which resemble the ependymal cells of the ventricles within the brain and the spinal cord. These too are classified into different categories according to their severity of aggression. Least aggressive ependymal tumors include Subependymomas and Myxopapillary ependymoma which are classified as grade I. The most severe are classified as grade III and are called anaplastic ependymomas and these usually occur at the base of the spine. Oligodendroglioma is another type of glial tumor which, are rare.

It is used as a 'conditioning' treatment to clear the bone marrow and make room for the transplanted bone marrow cells, which can then produce healthy blood cells. It is used together with another medicine called fludarabine in adults and children from one month of age with blood cancers as well as in adults with other severe disorders requiring a bone marrow transplant. It belongs to the family of drugs called alkylating agents. In the body, treosulfan is converted into other compounds called epoxides which kill cells, especially cells that develop rapidly such as bone marrow cells, by attaching to their DNA while they are dividing. The most common side effects in adults and children are infections, nausea (feeling sick), stomatitis (inflammation of the lining of the mouth), vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain (belly ache). Tiredness, febrile neutropenia (low white blood cell counts with fever) and high blood levels of bilirubin (a breakdown product of red blood cells) are also seen in more than 1 in 10 adults, and rash also affects more than 1 in 10 children. Medical Uses Treosulfan in combination with fludarabine is indicated as part of conditioning treatment prior to allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) in adults with malignant and non malignant diseases, and in children older than one month with malignant diseases. History Treosulfan was approved for use in the European Union in June 2019. Two main studies showed that treosulfan is at least as effective as busulfan, another medicine used to prepare patients for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In one of the studies, involving 570 adults with acute myeloid leukaemia (a blood cancer) or myelodysplastic syndromes (conditions in which large numbers of abnormal blood cells are produced), 64% of patients given treosulfan (with fludarabine) had a successful transplant and were alive and disease-free after 2 years, compared with 51% of patients given busulfan (with fludarabine). In an additional study in 70 children with blood cancers, 99% of children given treosulfan (with fludarabine) were alive 3 months after their transplant. On 23 February 2004, orphan designation (EU/3/04/186) was granted by the European Commission to medac Gesellschaft fuer klinische Spezialpr√§parate mbH, Germany, for treosulfan for the conditioning treatment prior to haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation.

Hibbs was a catcher and outfielder by trade, but his MLB experience was limited to three pinch hitting appearances at the outset of the 1967 season. He threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed during his active career. Born in Klamath Falls, Oregon, Hibbs graduated from high school in Ventura, California, and played college baseball at Stanford University, where he was an All-American selection and starred for the 1964 U.S. Olympic baseball team, hitting .379 with four home runs.Ventura County Sports Hall of Fame He was chosen in the third round of the secondary phase of the January 1966 Major League Baseball draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers. After hitting .309 with nine home runs during a year spent at the Rookie and Class A levels of the Dodgers' farm system, he entered the Rule 5 draft that fall, and the Angels acquired him. He remained on the Halos' 28-man, early-season roster when the 1967 American League season began and made his debut April 12 against Mickey Lolich of the Detroit Tigers, making a ground ball out to the second baseman in the ninth inning, pinch-hitting for veteran relief pitcher Jim Coates to make the final out in the Tigers' 6‚Äì3 win at Anaheim Stadium.Retrosheet box score: 1967-04-12 In his other two plate appearances, Hibbs struck out against Darold Knowles of the Washington Senators on May 6,Retrosheet box score: 1967-05-06 and fanned against Jim O'Toole of the Chicago White Sox on May 13.Retrosheet box score: 1967-05-13 The three pitchers whom Hibbs faced were all left-handers.

He negotiated with Lenape and other Native American tribes in western Pennsylvania to gain their support during the American Revolutionary War. An associate of the Lenape chief White Eyes, Morgan cared for his son George Morgan White Eyes for several years after White Eyes died. Early life and education George Morgan was born in Philadelphia to Evan Morgan, an immigrant from Wales, and Joanna Biles. Like his older brother John Morgan, who became a physician and the co-founder of the University of Pennsylvania Medical College, George was likely educated at the classical Nottingham Academy in Chester County, Pennsylvania.\\"John Morgan (1735-1789)\\", Archives, University of Pennsylvania, accessed 29 January 2011 He graduated from the College of New Jersey (Princeton). Merchant George Morgan worked as a clerk for John Bayton and Samuel Wharton at the mercantile firm Bayton & Wharton in Philadelphia. After receiving inheritance, he became a junior partner at Baynton, Wharton & Morgan in 1760. In 1764, he married John Baynton's daughter Mary. Enjoying the patronage of Sir William Johnson, Superintendent of Indian Affairs, the firm started to trade with Illinois Country ceded to Great Britain by France after the end of the French and Indian War, using Fort Pitt Trading Post in present-day Pittsburgh as a forward base.Sosin, Jack M. Agents and Merchants. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1965. Morgan made frequent business trips to the frontier and developed good relations with Native Americans. Lenape made Morgan a member of their tribe naming him Tamanend in honor of one of their great warriors.Walter R. Fee. Colonel George Morgan at Fort Pitt, West Pennsylvania History Magazine, Volume 11, 1928, pp. 217‚Äì224. Agent for Indian affairs George Morgan was made an agent for Indian affairs in the Middle Department in 1776, and commissioned on January 8, 1777 as colonel in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. He was assigned to Fort Pitt to oversee diplomacy with Native Americans in the area: Lenape, Shawnee, and others. The American rebels hoped to gain them as allies, or at least convince them to be neutral and not ally with the British. While there Morgan worked closely with the Lenape chief White Eyes; the two became trusted friends. In 1777 there were allegations made to the Continental Congress against Colonel Morgan that he had collaborated with Alexander McKee and others against the American cause. McKee was the former British deputy Indian superintendent and had escaped from captivity at Fort Pitt. Morgan was cleared of these charges in 1778.Reuben Gold Thwaites and Louise Phelps Kellogg, eds., Frontier Defense on the Upper Ohio, 1777-1778 (Madison: Wisconsin Historical Society, 1912), pp. 184-87; and Committee of Congress letters to Edward Hand and to Unknown, October 24, 1777The March 27 certificate of the commissioners at Fort Pitt, exonerating Indian agent Morgan \\"of the charges against him, of infidelity to his public trust, and disaffection to the American cause,\\" is in Journal of the Continental Congress (JCC), 10:314-15.

He died that month, with the Americans' reporting he had contracted smallpox. Years later Morgan wrote to Congress saying that the American militia had killed White Eyes in Michigan, and that American officials had covered up the murder. In 1783 Morgan reported on Indian affairs to the Continental Congress, accompanied by White Eyes' 12-year-old son, named George Morgan White Eyes, for whom he was caring. The Congress authorized him to care for the boy for another year.\\"Biographies W-Z\\", 29 January 2006, Lenape Delaware History, accessed 29 January 2011 In view of the chief White Eyes' service to the Americans, Morgan helped secure funding from the Continental Congress for the education of George Morgan White Eyes, who graduated from the College of New Jersey (Princeton University) in 1789.\\"Brief History of Students of Color at Princeton\\" , Thriving at Princeton, 2007-08, July 2007, Princeton University Land developer After the Revolution, Morgan explored the Ohio River Valley as he decided to become a land developer and speculator. To his disappointment, in 1784 the United States government claimed much of the territory which he hoped to survey. While in Ohio, he gathered paleontological specimens which he sent to his brother John, an early member of the American Philosophical Society, of which George Morgan was also a member, having been elected to it in 1768.Bell, Whitfield J., and Charles Greifenstein, Jr. Patriot-Improvers: Biographical Sketches of Members of the American Philosophical Society. 3 vols.

Gentleman farmer Prospect Farm George Morgan‚Äôs Prospect Farm in 1779 On April 1, 1779, Morgan bought 210 acres of land in Princeton, New Jersey where he built a stone farmhouse with splendid eastern vista, and named his estate the Prospect Farm. Along with regular farming, he conducted scientific experiments by growing different varieties of corn from various climate zones; maintained a model aviary; developed methods of pest control, in particular, aimed at the hessian fly. In the words of Manasseh Cutler, who visited George Morgan in July 1787, \\"Here I saw the Hessian fly, as it called, which has done immense injury for wheat. Our country is under much obligation to this gentleman for the discoveries he has made, and the information he has given respecting this insect, in consequence of his experiments. It has enabled the farmers in this part of the country to get rid of an insect that had wholly cut off their crops of grain for several years successfully.\\"Collins, Varnum L.

One third of Mongolian livestock (over 7 million heads) was decimated as herders were forced onto collective farms. Private trade was suppressed and over 800 properties belonging to the nobility and the Buddhist church were confiscated and over 700 head of mostly noble households were executed. Refugees streamed across the border into Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang as scattered local uprisings erupted between February and April 1930 in different areas of southern and south-western Mongolia. In March 1930, Bat- Ochiryn Eldev-Ochir, a rising star of the MPRP's left wing, was appointed head of the Internal Security Directorate and ordered to suppress uprisings by lamas at T√∂gsbuyant and Ulaangom monasteries in Uvs Province. He and a Soviet trainer commanded the fourth cavalry out of Khovd that swiftly and brutally defeated the lamas. Eldev-Ochir ordered the on-the-spot execution of 30 leaders of the rebellion. Outline of events Jambyn Lkh√ºmbe The swift defeat of the Uvs revolt failed to prevent further violent uprisings from spreading across western Mongolia in 1932. The main uprising began on April 10 or 11th 1932 centered at the Khyalganat monastery of Rashaant sum in Kh√∂vsg√∂l aimag, and spread quickly to neighboring monasteries. The insurgents established a high command under the name \\"Ochirbat's ministry\\" (), and began arming the local lamas and lay people, burning down collective and sum centers, and assassinating opponents, especially local officials and party and youth league members who actively sought repress institutional Buddhism in favor of socialism. The rebellion quickly spread to Arkhangai, √ñv√∂rkhangai, Zavkhan and D√∂rb√∂t aimags. The Mongolian government responded by establishing an extraordinary commission headed by Jambyn Lkh√ºmbe and deploying Interior Ministry armed units on April 15/16th.D. Tserenbaljir, 1932 ony zevsegt boslogo, Ulaanbaatar 1990, p. 33f. Lkh√ºmbe's troops torched the town of Rashaant, destroyed Khyalganat monastery where the rebellion had originated, and ordered the immediate execution of 54 of the 204 insurgents that were captured.Baabar 315 Government forces, with the assistance of Soviet tanks and aircraft, gradually brought the rebellion under control by the end of summer 1932. Through June and July 614 rebels were killed and another 1500 arrested during the course of 15 battles. Lkh√ºmbe returned to Ulaanbaatar where, in recognition of his efforts, he was elected First Secretary of the MPRP Central Committee on July 30, 1932. In August, however, the rebellion resumed in southern Kh√∂vsg√∂l and northern Arkhangai aimags. It is supposed that the Mongolian rebels have connection with similar uprising in Tuva.Kuzmin, S.L. and Oyuunchimeg J. Vooruzhennoe Vosstanie v Mongolii v 1932 g. Moscow, MBA Publ., 2015, p. 164‚Äì165. The uprising was suppressed to November 1932.Kuzmin, S.L. and Oyuunchimeg J. Vooruzhennoe Vosstanie v Mongolii v 1932 g.

The uprising covered an area of about 155 thousand km2. The garrison town of Tsetserleg, population 1195 people, joined the rebellion. In general, most of rebels were common herdsmen. In √ñv√∂rkhangai aimag 90% members of Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the Revolutionary youth union joined the rebels, as well as 95% of collective farms. Rebel fighting units numbered from dozens to thousands men. They were armed mainly with flintlocks, and antique rifles. Governmental troops numbered just a few hundred men, but were better armed with modern rifles, machine guns, grenades, mountain artillery, armored cars and planes provided by the USSR. Soviet troops were not introduced, but military advisers participated in some battles. Results The trial of the participants of the armed uprising in 1933 The uprising covered the country's four most populated aimags (Kh√∂vsg√∂l, Arkhangai, √ñv√∂rkhangai, Zavkhan, D√∂rb√∂t, partly Altai and Southern Govi). The numbers are quite fragmentary but more than 3,000 people are said to have participated on the side of the insurgents, and they are said to have killed more than 700 people between April and July 1932. According to a short-time chairman of the Defense Council, D. √ñlziibat, 500 insurgents were killed in 16 battles, and 615 insurgents were condemned to death by drumhead courts- martial. 35 sum centers and 45 cooperatives were destroyed. According to one Soviet document, 8000-10,000 people were killed. Total number of people killed by insurgents is many times less than the total number of victims of the uprising.Kuzmin, S.L. and Oyuunchimeg J. Vooruzhennoe Vosstanie v Mongolii v 1932 g. Moscow, MBA Publ., 2015, p. 102‚Äì103. Aftermath Following the violent uprisings, Moscow ordered a curtailment of the unpopular leftist initiatives and pinned the blame for the excesses of what became known as the \\"Leftist Deviation\\" on hard-line leftists within the MPRP leadership, including Zolbingiin Shijee, √ñlziin Badrakh, and Prime Minister Tsengeltiin Jigjidjav. All were officially expelled from the party in May 1932. The government instituted a \\"new course\\" policy in which anti-religious policies were eased after June 1932 and collectivization was suspended. Nevertheless, by this point the Mongolian nobility had effectively been destroyed, and the political moderation would prove to be only a temporary respite: the Buddhist church would be almost completely eradicated in the Stalinist purges of the late 1930s, and livestock would be collectivized again in the 1950s.C.R.

BPI was originally intended to help measure cancer patients pain, but today it is used in cancer related cases as well as non-cancer related cases. There are two categories in the Brief Pain Inventory: Pain Intensity and Pain Interference. In Pain Interference two dimensions help discover different problems that need to be accessed to accurately treat the patient. These two dimensions being: Activity Interference and Affective Interference. Activity interference deals with general activity or more physical aspects of daily life such as walking. Affective Interference deals with emotional or internal aspects of daily life such as enjoyment of life and/or mood. Pain Intensity is measured in four categories: worst, least, on average, and currently, while Pain Interference is measured in 7 categories: mood, work, general activity, walking, relationships, enjoyment of life, and sleep. The patient rates each of these on a scale from 0-10, 10 being excruciating pain intensity and a complete interference in their life.

Highways and byways in Derbyshire. London: Macmillan (1905), pp. 32-34. Life Thomas Bancroft was a native of Swarkestone, a Derbyshire village on the River Trent: he has an epigram in celebration of his father and mother buried in Swarkestone Church. He matriculated at St Catharine's College, Cambridge in 1613, where he was a contemporary of James Shirley, to whom he addresses an epigram. He was an usher (a junior grammar school master who taught the rudiments of Latin to 7- to 10-year-old students) at Market Bosworth grammar school in Leicestershire, a position he acquired through his connection with Sir John Harpur of Swarkestone, who was related to the family of Wolstan Dixie, the school's founder. In 1626 he married Rebecca Errington, a widow from Osgathorpe. Bancroft's sister, Elizabeth, had married a John Errington in 1621, perhaps the brother of Rebecca's husband.Charvat, William. \\"Thomas Bancroft\\" in PMLA 47:3 (Sept. 1932) pp. 753-758. Bancroft had apparently only a younger son's fortune, his elder brother died in 1639, having broken up the little family- property. He seems to have lived for some time in his native Derbyshire, where Sir Aston Cockayne, as a neighbour and fellow-poet, appears to have visited and been visited by him. On the evidence of one of his own epigrams and Sir Aston Cockayne's commendatory lines, in 1658 he was living in retirement at Bradley,Dictionary of National Biography now in the public domain near Ashbourne, Derbyshire.Kelly's Directory of the Counties of Derby, Notts, Leicester and Rutland, London 1891, pp. 54-5 He continued there until his death, recorded in the church register there. It was said that Bancroft was 'small of stature', and that he published sermons. He was referred to as 'the small poet,' partly in reference to his stature, and partly in allusion to his small poems. Work Bancroft's first publication was The Glvtton's Feaver (1633), a narrative poem in seven-line stanzas of the parable of the rich man and Lazarus. Prefixed to that work is a poem that perhaps puns on William Shakespeare's stature as it does on Ben Jonson's obesity, George Chapman's appearance, and Francis Beaumont's family connexions: ::But the chast bay not euery songster weares, ::Nor of Appollo's sonnes prooue all his heires: ::'Tis not for all to reach at Shakespeares height, ::Or thinke to grow to solid Iohnsons weight, ::To bid so faire as Chapman for a fame, ::Or match (your family) the Beaumonts name.Bradley, Jesse Franklin, and Joseph Quincy Adams, eds. The Jonson Allusion Book. New Haven:Yale UP (1922) p. 175. Bancroft's next and better-known book was his Two Bookes of Epigrammes and Epitaphes. Dedicated to two top-branches of Gentry: Sir Charles Shirley, Baronet, and William Davenport, Esquire (1639). These epigrams were quoted partly because of the notability of the people they celebrate. The names include Philip Sidney, Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, John Donne, Thomas Overbury, John Ford, Francis Quarles, Thomas RandolphBancroft wrote that Randolph \\"drank too much at the Muses spring\\". ref Randolph in DNB and Shirley. Several examples show his propensity to punning: ::118. To Shakespeare. :: ::Thy Muses sugred dainties seeme to us ::Like the fam‚Äôd apples of old Tantalus : ::For we (admiring) see and heare they straines, ::But none I see or heare those sweets attaines. ::119.

To Dr. Donne. ::Thy muses gallantry doth farre exceed ::All ours; to whom thou art a Don indeed. ::192.

Chetham society Publications, old series, vol. 52, pp. 144-150; 146-147. Available online at Internet Archive American Libraries. In 1649 Bancroft contributed to Alexander Brome's Lachrymce Musarum, or the Teares of the Muses, a poem To the never-dying memory of the noble Lord Hastings. Finally he published, in 1658, The Heroical Lover, or Antheon and Fidelta, and the collection of verse Times out of Tune, Plaid upon However in XX Satyres. This last is a series of moralizing satirical poems directed against (inter alia) whoring, gluttony, alcoholism, hedonism, lying, pride in clothing, false friends, ambition, cowardice, cruelty, and the abuse of poetry. Full of invective, the subjects Bancroft chose for this collection seem to leave few aspects of life to enjoy.

Holguin learned the game of golf while growing up in San Antonio, Texas during the Great Depression. His family, which was of Mexican descent, had no money and could not afford an automobile. He spent much time at home, practicing his putting. Holguin served in the U.S. Army during World War II. He won the San Antonio City Championship in 1946 and 1947. He turned professional in 1948. Holguin won the Mexican Open in 1949 and 1950. His best finish in a major championship was T17 at PGA Championship in 1957. The biggest win of his career came in 1953 at the Texas Open. In 1957, Holguin tied Arnold Palmer for third place in the Texas Open. His majors resume consists of three Masters, six U.S. Opens and eight PGA Championships.

Pope Francis has extended his appointment to 2022. He previously served as chief liturgist for the Archdiocese of Genoa. Early years Marini was born in Genoa on 31 January 1965. He earned his B.A. in theology at the seminary in Genoa and was ordained a priest on 4 February 1989 by Cardinal Giovanni Canestri. He then earned a degree in both canon and civil law (JUD) from the Pontifical Lateran University and another degree in the psychology of communication in 2007 from the Salesian Pontifical University. In addition to working as a spiritual director, he held the following positions in Genoa: secretary to the archbishop of Genoa from 1988 to 2003; master of liturgical celebrations from 2003 to 2007; member of the archdiocesan Council of Priests from 1996 to 2001; spiritual director of the seminary in Genoa from 2004 to 2007; and Chancellor of the Archdiocese from 2005 to 2007. Master of Pontifical Liturgical Celebrations Marini at a Papal Mass with Pope Benedict XVI Marini at the Inauguration of Pope Francis Marini was named Master of Pontifical Liturgical Ceremonies on 1 October 2007, appointed to another five-year term by Benedict XVI, confirmed in that office by Pope Francis in April 2014, and appointed to another five-year term in 2017. Francis also named him a member of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches on 19 February 2014. Marini, following his appointment as Master of Pontifical Liturgical Celebrations, restored some traditional elements of papal ceremonial. During his time as Master of Ceremonies the Papal Altar was rearranged. The seven candles and crucifix were placed in a line across the Altar rather than clustered on the sides. This arrangement has become known as the \\"Benedictine arrangement\\". In a January 2010 speech, Marini supported calls in the church for a \\"reform of the reform\\" of liturgy. He said: \\"For some years now, several voices have been heard within church circles talking about the necessity of a new liturgical renewal,\\" adding that a new renewal movement would be \\"capable of operating a reform of the reform, or rather, move one more step ahead in understanding the authentic spirit of the liturgy and its celebration.\\" In 2015 Pope Francis made changes to the public ceremony of investiture of the pallium on metropolitan archbishops emphasizing that the investiture is an ecclesial event of the whole diocese, and not merely a juridical or ceremonial event. Monsignor Marini said that from now on ‚Äì starting from 29 June this year ‚Äì the ceremony of investiture of the pallium will take place in the Metropolitan Archbishops' home dioceses and not in the Vatican. During Marini's time as Master of Ceremonies Pope Benedict ceased to use the papal staff made for Paul VI and began to use an older one made for Pius XI. Due to the weight of that staff, Benedict had his own made which is much lighter, and shares a similar style with the previous one. Pope Francis occasionally makes use of this one also in order to emphasize continuity with his predecessor. He also made decisions about the use of papal vestments at Mass and other pontifical celebrations, dressing Cardinal-Deacons in dalmatics when serving pontifical celebrations.  Papal conclave 2013  Marini was Master of Ceremonies in the 2013 conclave that elected Pope Francis. On 11 March 2013, the day before the conclave, at a ceremony presided over by the Camerlengo Tarcisio Bertone, Marini led the non-cardinal officials, support staff and other non-elector personnel with duties in the conclave in taking an oath of secrecy pertaining to the conclave. The next day, after the cardinal- electors had taken their oath in the Sistine Chapel, Marini called out the command \\"Extra omnes\\" (Everyone out) and closed the chapel doors once all outsiders had left the chapel.

Hansen Industries work on the Liberty ship SS John W. Brown at Colonna's Shipyard, a ship repair facility located in the Port of Norfolk, Virginia. (December 2014) A rivet gun, also known as a rivet hammer or a pneumatic hammer, is a type of tool used to drive rivets. The rivet gun is used on rivet's factory head (the head present before riveting takes place), and a bucking bar is used to support the tail of the rivet. The energy from the hammer in the rivet gun drives the work and the rivet against the bucking bar. As a result, the tail of the rivet is compressed and work-hardened. At the same time the work is tightly drawn together and retained between the rivet head and the flattened tail (now called the shop head, or buck-tail, to distinguish it from the factory head). Nearly all rivet guns are pneumatically powered. Those rivet guns used to drive rivets in structural steel are quite large while those used in aircraft assembly are easily held in one hand. A rivet gun differs from an air hammer in the precision of the driving force. Rivet guns vary in size and shape and have a variety of handles and grips. Pneumatic rivet guns typically have a regulator which adjusts the amount of air entering the tool. Regulated air entering passes through the throttle valve which is typically controlled by a trigger in the hand grip. When the trigger is squeezed, the throttle valve opens, allowing the pressurized air to flow into the piston. As the piston moves, a port opens allowing the air pressure to escape. The piston strikes against the rivet set. The force on the rivet set pushes the rivet into the work and against the bucking bar. The bucking bar deforms the tail of the rivet. The piston is returned to the original position by a spring or the shifting of a valve allowing air to drive the piston back to the starting position. Slow-hitting The slow-hitting gun strikes multiple blows as long as the trigger is held down. The repetition rate is about 2,500 blows-per-minute (bpm). It is easier to control than a one-hit gun. This is probably the most common type of rivet gun in use. Fast-hitting gun The fast-hitting gun strikes multiple light-weight blows at a high rate as long as the trigger is held down. These are repeated in the range of 2,500 to 5,000 bpm. The fast-hitting gun, sometimes referred to as a vibrator, is generally used with softer rivets. Corner riveter The corner riveter is a compact rivet gun that can be used in close spaces. The rivet is driven at right-angles to handle by a very short barreled driver. Squeeze riveter This gun is different from the above rivet guns in that the air pressure is used to provide a squeezing action that compresses the rivet from both sides rather than distinct blows. The squeeze riveter can only be used close to the edge because of the limited depth of the anvil. Once properly adjusted, the squeeze riveter will produce very uniform rivet bucks. The stationary (fixed) jaw is placed against the head and the buck is compressed by the action of the gun.  Pop-rivet gun  A typical pop-rivet (a.k.a. blind rivet) A pop rivet gun is made to apply pop rivets to a workpiece. This type of rivet gun is unique in its operation, because it does not hammer the rivet into place. Rather, a pop rivet gun will form a rivet in-place. The gun is fed over the rivet's mandrel (a shaft protruding from the rivet head) and the rivet tail is inserted into the work. When the gun is actuated (typically by squeezing the handle), a ball on the rivet's tail is drawn towards the head, compressing a metal sleeve between the ball and the head. This forms another \\"head\\" on the opposing side to the workpiece, drawing the work together and holding it securely in place. The mandrel has a weak point that breaks, or \\"pops\\" when the riveting process is complete. This style of rivet does not require the use of a bucking bar, because the force applied is away from the work. Two styles of pop rivet gun, a dual handle style and a squeeze handle style.

He was Governor of Katanga Province, located in the southern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, from 2007 to September 2015. He was a member of the People's Party for Reconstruction and Democracy (PPRD) until September 2015. He has been described by The Economist as \\"probably the second most powerful man in the Democratic Republic of Congo after the president, Joseph Kabila\\". Jeune Afrique named him \\"African of the Year\\" in 2015. Background and personal life Mo√Øse Katumbi was born on 28 December 1964 to a Congolese mother and a Sephardic Jewish father from Greece, Nissim Soriano. Katumbi's father, a Greek Sephardic Jew, fled Rhodes Island in 1938 with his two sisters after the introduction by the Italian fascist regime of the discriminatory Racial Laws (Rhodes had been under Italian occupation since 1912). He settled in Katanga, in the Congo, a Belgian colony at the time. Katumbi's mother was of Kazembe royalty of the Lunda people. His grandfather was Mwata Kazembe XIV (Chief of the Lunda kingdom) The family adopted the name Katumbi from a great-grandfather on his mother‚Äôs side. Katumbi grew up in the village of in the Congo near Lake Mweru near the border of Zambia. His father was involved in the fishing trade. Katumbi studied at the Kiwele school of Lubumbashi and the Kapolowe mission. He is married to Carine Katumbi. His older half-brother is Raphael Katebe Katoto, a businessman and retired politician who was a member of RCD-Goma and led a political party that opposed Congolese president Joseph Kabila in 2006. Katumbi is one of the wealthiest people in the DRC. He has been the subject of two documentaries by director Thierry Michel: Katanga Business (2009) and The Irresistible Rise of Mo√Øse Katumbi (2014).  Private career  Katumbi's career began in the fishing industry when he was 13. He sold salted and fresh fish to the state-owned mining company G√©camines. In 1987, he created the holding company Etablissement Katumbi to aggregate all of his business activities including mining, transportation, and food processing. Katumbi founded MCK (Mining Company Katanga) in 1997, which specialized in mining and logistics and subcontracted for mining companies in the region, including G√©camines. By 2015, the company had grown to 1900 employees and was a leading mining company in the country. French company Necotrans bought MCK in November 2015 for an undisclosed amount. Around 2000, during the Second Congo War, Katumbi moved to Zambia, where he had business ties in transportation. He returned to the DRC in 2003 by invitation from President Kabila, who urged Katumbi to help fix the mining industry in Katanga. Football Since 1997, Katumbi has been the president of the football team TP Mazembe in Lubumbashi. The team has won the CAF Champions League title five times, including 2009, 2010, and 2015, and became the first African team to play in the FIFA Club World Cup finals in 2010. Katumbi has invested heavily in the team and been credited by the media and public as one of the reasons for the club‚Äôs success. Under his tenure, the team has recruited players from Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Ghana, and Zambia, and retained local players by paying the highest wages for players in Africa. Katumbi invested $35 million in building the team a stadium which was completed in 2011. Katumbi began a football academy in 2012 as a social program to engage and train young Congolese people in the province of Katanga. In 2015, 2,000 young men were enrolled in the academy. In 2012, Katumbi was elected to the FIFA strategic commission. In 2013, he was elected to the Africa Cup of Nations organizing committee, which he is slated to chair until 2017. He has also served on the marketing committee of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) since 2009. Political career In 2006, Katumbi was elected as a deputy in the National Assembly. He was the first democratically elected Governor of the Katanga Province in January 2007, receiving 94 votes out of 102. Katumbi's governance has been credited with bringing economic revival to the province through developing infrastructure, encouraging foreign investment with tax breaks and reduced government procedures, and targeting corruption. Through Katumbi's efforts as governor, local taxes increased from $80 million in 2007 to more than $3 billion in 2014. Annual revenues increased from 100 million in 2007 to 1.5 billion by 2013. Shortly after he took office as governor, Katumbi implemented an export ban for raw minerals, including cobalt, forcing major mining companies to either build processing plants in the province or pay a tax on the exported concentrate. Under Katumbi, copper production increased from 8,000 metric tons in 2006 to more than 1 million tons in 2014. Along with mining, Katumbi focused on expanding other areas of the province's economy including the service industry, energy and agriculture. He offered both free farmland and tax breaks for farmers to encourage food production. Reliance on imported food decreased 68% between 2006 and 2011. In 2014, the amount of food grown locally had tripled. The accomplishments of his administration included improving travel and commerce through the building or rebuilding more than 1,500 kilometers (approximately 30%) of roads and the increase in other infrastructure, including bridges, hospitals and schools. Access to clean water rose from 3% to 67% between 2007 and 2013. Additionally, within 6 years, the number of children attending school increased from 400,000 in 2007 to 3 million in 2014. The number of girls enrolled in school tripled. Worker-focused initiatives included encouraging local mining companies to invest in growing crops for their employees and the banning of \\"unnecessary dismissal of employees\\". In September 2015, Katumbi resigned as governor and from his political party, the People's Party for Reconstruction and Democracy. On 22 June 2016, he was convicted, in absentia, of selling a house that was not his and sentenced to 36 months in jail. This was seen as part of President Joseph Kabila's attempts to hold on to power. On 2 January 2018, Katumbi declared his candidacy for president for the 2018 DR Congo general election. The next day, his home in Lubumbashi was surrounded by police who accused him of hiring mercenaries, which he denied. On 12 March 2018, Katumbi officially launched his presidential campaign as well as his new political alliance, Ensemble pour le changement (Together for Change). On 9 May, Katumbi was accused of inciting rebellion against Kabila. He was also accused of being behind the 2018 √âquateur province Ebola virus outbreak. On 25 May, Katumbi discussed with fellow opposition presidential candidate F√©lix Tshisekedi at the Atlantic Council fielding a single opposition candidate. On 1 June, attackers burned posters of Katumbi in Lubumbashi, and attempted to attack Katumbi's residence. The next day, it was revealed that the perpetrators were a mission sent by Kabila, who tried to kill Katumbi's relatives. On 9 June, Katumbi gave his first presidential campaign speech via Skype to thousands of supporters in Kinshasa. On 13 June, Katumbi was arrested at Zaventem Airport in Brussels for allegedly traveling with a fake passport while attempting to travel to Russia to attend the opening ceremony of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. He was later granted a temporary residence permit by the Belgian authorities. Katumbi discovered that Congolese authorities had canceled his passport while going through customs at Zaventem. On 3 August 2018, Katumbi was blocked from entering the DR Congo via the border with Zambia. Those close to him are discussing with MONUSCO about Katumbi's return to the country before the presidential filing deadline on 10 August. He was greeted by thousands of his supporters in the Zambian portion of the town of Kasumbalesa, along the border with the DR Congo. On 4 August, it was announced that Katumbi would appear before the customs union to attempt to enter the country again. On 5 August, Katumbi's lawyer, Eric Dupond-Moretti, announced that he would attempt to reach out to the United Nations concerning Katumbi's denial of entry into the DR Congo. The same day, Ensemble's secretary general Delly Sesanga announced that they would file for Katumbi to run for president even if he was not in the country.https://actualite.cd/2018/08/05/rdc-presidentielle-ensemble-pour- le-changement-annonce-quil-va-deposer-la-candidature-de-katumbi/ When the final list of retained candidate for the December 23rd election was out, his name was missing since he did not make it to return home and file for his candidature. Views In 2006 and 2011, Katumbi supported Joseph Kabila for President of the Democratic Republic of Congo. However, Katumbi publicly distanced himself from Kabila in 2015. Katumbi has been outspoken about his belief that President Kabila should follow the country's constitution and step down as president in 2016. In January 2016, Katumbi joined other high-profile Congolese figures in a coalition dubbed \\"Front Citoyen 2016\\". The entity aimed to protect the constitution and attempted to ensure that the 2016 presidential elections took place. He is against Katangese secession from Congo, which is supported by a section of the province's population. Katumbi has frequently said that he prefers his private career to politics. Public perception Katumbi is generally viewed positively both in Katanga Province and nationally for both his development of the Katanga region and as president of TP Mazembe. He is known for being generous, giving money directly to those who ask and investing his own funds in social causes. The media has described Katumbi's public perception as being a \\"self-made man\\" and a \\"man of the people\\". In 2011, nearly one million people signed a petition asking Katumbi to remain governor after he said he planned to quit. In 2012 he was named one of \\"The 50 most influential Africans\\" by The Africa Report. Jeune Afrique named him \\"African of the Year\\" in 2015.

Throughout his career he had various nicknames: El Cuto, La Flecha and Ca√±itas. Jorge Ca√±as was the son of Amanda Ca√±as Cerna and Jorge Alberto Ca√±as Andrade. His younger siblings are: his brother Carlos Ernesto Ca√±as Cerna (who also played as a fearless left defender in C.D.

A testament to this was seen at the religious mass on the 10th anniversary of his death, which in addition to his mother, brother, sister and surviving family (wife, two sons, a daughter and grand children), was also attended by several of his C.D. FAS teammates and by Don Jaime Battle (ex-president of C.D. Fas).10th anniversary mass Although Ca√±itas and his younger brother, nicknamed El Burro, played together at C.D. FAS in 1972, they also often found each other in opposing teams. A common anecdote between the brothers came from a match where they played for opposing teams and where they were matched up against each other. El Burro was playing at C.D. FAS and Ca√±itas at Sonsonate. Sonsonate had a green uniform, with green socks. The brothers joked in later years about facing each other in that match, where El Burro played a very rough game against his older sibling. After the match, when they arrived at their common home, Ca√±itas confronted his younger brother about his rough play during the match, to which El Burro responded: Hey, all I saw were the green socks!

In March 2009, Payne was announced as the Defensive Line Coach for Florida Atlantic University, marking his first foray into coaching at the collegiate level. After leaving Florida Atlantic, Payne was named the Head Football Coach at Spanish River High School in Boca Raton, Florida.

Payne once broke his right wrist during the Michigan-Michigan State Paul Bunyan Trophy game and proceeded to snap the ball for the rest of his game with his left hand. Professional career He was selected in the third round of the 1997 NFL Draft by the Cincinnati Bengals. He was a backup with the Bengals from 1997-1998 and was released in September 1998. His playing career was shortened by numerous injuries. He sat out the 1999 NFL season and had surgery on both knees. The Bengals had released him during the 1999 season knowing he was injured, which caused Payne to file a grievance, which was settled. He signed with the Baltimore Ravens in April 2000 and was released at the end of training camp. He was signed to the Ravens' 2000 practice squad in November, and he won a Super Bowl ring with them in Super Bowl XXXV. Over the course of his career, Payne had twelve surgeries to repair his numerous football-related injuries. In 2006, Payne co-authored a 2006 book called \\"Centered by a Miracle\\" (Sports Publishing, ) with his friend and sportswriter Steve Rom. The publisher describes the book as follows: \\"After Steve was diagnosed with leukemia, Rod left his job as co-host of a daily sports radio talk show in Ann Arbor, his first post-football career, to help rally his friend back to health. Steve's future, once again, became clear. So too, however, did the challenges that lay ahead. What ensued was a 10-month battle for survival, one that would ultimately turn these friends into brothers.\\" Since retiring, Rod has taught special education and been a managing partner of a health club. Rod has served on the board of the Michigan Letterwinners M Club Alumni Association. Since retiring from football, Payne has operated a shop in Ann Arbor, Michigan where he customized cars, hosted a sports talk radio show in Ann Arbor, taught special education, been a personal trainer, and served as managing partner of a gym in the Ann Arbor area.

He was apparently the ealdorman of East Anglia from 1004 to his death at the battle of Assandun in 1016, although he is not called an ealdorman in any of the charters he witnessed. Scandinavian sources refer to him as Ulfkell Snillingr, the byname meaning bold. Background and status Leofsige, ealdorman of Essex, was exiled for killing a shire reeve in 1002. It is not certain that any ealdorman was appointed by King √Üthelred the Unready to replace Leofsige, although John of Worcester's chronicle calls Ulfcytel the dux‚Äîwar leader‚Äîof the East Anglians, and he appears as leader of the East Anglians on several occasions. It may be that Ulfcytel was married to a daughter of King √Üthelred (by his first wife) named Wulfhild, as suggested by a supplementary text to the J√≥msv√≠kinga saga.Handbook of British Chronology, p. 27. From 1004 onwards he witnessed a large number of King √Üthelred's charters, being described in these as a minister, that is thegn, rather than an ealdorman. Ulfcytel's name is of Scandinavian origin, but no details of his family are known. It is possible that he was in some way related to the family or affinity of √Üthelstan Half- King which had dominated politics in East Anglia and Essex from the 930s to the 990s. In addition to the English sources, Ulfcytel also appears as a character in Saint Olaf's saga in the Heimskringla, and here East Anglia is called \\"Ulfcytel's land\\". Military career 1004-1016 In 1004 the Anglo- Saxon Chronicle reports a bloody battle between the East Anglians and an army led by Danish king Swein Forkbeard. The Chronicle states that Ulfcytel and the \\"councillors in East Anglia\\" attempted to buy a truce with Swein, but that the Danes broke the truce and marched to Thetford where a part of the East Anglian fyrd engaged them. The battle seems to have been a draw as the Danes managed to escape. Two of the Chronicle manuscripts state that the Danes later \\"admitted that they had never met with harder hand-play [fighting] in England than Ulfcytel gave them\\". The Danes suffered heavy losses, and were probably only saved from destruction because Ulfcytel's order to destroy their ships was not carried out. They left England without causing any further devastation which has been recorded.Frank Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, Third Edition, Oxford University Press, 1971, pp. 380‚Äì1 On his next appearance in the Chronicle again Ulfyctel is portrayed as the leader of the East Anglian armies. On this occasion the Battle of Ringmere against the Danes near Ipswich in 1010 turned into a rout, caused by the flight of Thurcytel \\"Mare's head\\", and only the men of Cambridgeshire stood to fight. The English dead included the King's brother-in-law, the son-in-law and grandson of ealdorman Byrhtnoth, \\"and countless people\\". Ulfcytel's third and last appearance in the Anglo- Saxon Chronicle is at the battle of Assandun on 18 October 1016 where he fought for Edmund Ironside. Here he was killed; he is listed among \\"the chief men of the nation\\" by the Chronicle. According to one Scandinavian source he was killed by Thorkell the Tall, who married his widow. Thorkell may well have married one of √Üthelred's widowed daughters although it is far from certain that he married Wulfhild. Alternatively, and less plausibly, Saint Olaf's Saga states that Ulfcytel was killed by Eir√≠kr H√°konarson near London. Notes References Fryde, E. et al. Handbook of British Chronology. 3d ed.

Life George Geddes was born in Oldhamstocks, East Lothian the son of Ina Nicholson and her husband, William Brydon Geddes. His early education was at Dunbar Grammar School. He studied civil engineering at the University of Edinburgh, graduating with a BSc in 1934 and gaining a \\"blue\\" in football. He worked for the City Engineer in Edinburgh, then Sir William Arrol & Company, and F.A. Macdonald & Partners under William Fairhurst, before joining Babtie, Shaw and Morton in 1942. He became a partner of the firm in 1950 and senior partner from 1976 to 1978. His specialist experience was structural engineering which led to an interest in hydro-electric projects, dams, shipyards, docks and industrial developments.\\"A century of achievement. Babtie 1895‚Äì1995\\". Published by Babtie Group Ltd, 1995. One of Geddes' most notable projects, under the overall direction of James Arthur Banks and later constructed by the contractor Marples Ridgway, was his contribution to the design of the Allt na Lairige dam in Argyllshire in the 1950s. This was the first concrete dam in western Europe, and possibly the world, to be prestressed by using high tensile steel bars, bolted either end, to compress the structure. Later Geddes was in charge of Backwater Dam, the first in the UK to use a chemical grout cut-off. One of his outstanding achievements was the major shipbuilding dock at the head of the Musgrave Channel in Belfast for Harland and Wolff. The dock was the largest in the World when it was completed in 1970, having been designed and built scarcely two years after the decision was taken to proceed. In 1975, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Hugh Sutherland, William Thomas Marshall, Ian Sneddon, Anthony Cusens, Robert Simpson Silver and Arnold Hendry. As well as being active in Scottish branches of professional institutions, he was elected President of all three of the Institutions in which he took a keen interest: the Institution of Structural Engineers in 1971‚Äì72, the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland 1977‚Äì79, and the Institution of Civil Engineers between November 1979 and November 1980.ICE past presidents In 1975, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1978. In 1980, he received an Honorary Doctorate of Science from the University of Edinburgh. Family Geddes was married to Margaret Gilchrist Wilson in 1941.

Kurfirst founded Radioactive Records, whose acts included Live, Black Grape, Jane's Addiction, the Ramones, Big Audio Dynamite, Talking Heads, Eurythmics and Shirley Manson. He managed a variety of artists including Manson, Blondie, Tom Tom Club, the Ramones, Jean Beauvoir, Eurythmics, Bob Marley and the Wailers, Toots and the Maytals, and The B-52s. Early years Kurfirst was born in Forest Hills, Queens.Bowman, David. \\"This Must Be the Place\\", HarperCollins, 2002, p. 109. . Accessed June 18, 2009. \\"The man was Gary Kurfirst. He was born in Forest Hills, Queens, in 1947. He was a manager.\\" He started promoting dances while he was still a student at Forest Hills High School in Queens. He rapidly moved on to organizing and promoting shows at the tennis stadium at the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills and moving across the East River to promoting gigs in Manhattan. Kurfirst helped arrange the first East Coast performances of acts including Jimi Hendrix and The Who.

In his obituary, The New York Times credited Kurfirst's success at the New York Rock Festival with inspiring the creation of the Woodstock Festival in Bethel, New York in August 1969. While negotiating a contract for the group Mountain in the late 1960s, Kurfirst developed a close relationship with Chris Blackwell, his counterpart at Island Records. Blackwell, quoted in Kurfirst's obituary in The New York Times, described him as \\"one of the first managers who basically built the rock business\\", stating that Kurfirst \\"stayed below the radar and once refused the cover of Rolling Stone because he felt it was not the right time for his band\\".

It was designed for the Bank of Asia by Sumet Jumsai to reflect the computerization of banking; its architecture is a reaction against neoclassical and high-tech postmodern architecture. The building's features, such as progressively receding walls, antennas, and eyes, contribute to its robotic appearance and to its practical function. Completed in 1986, the building is one of the last examples of modern architecture in Bangkok. Design Thai architect Sumet Jumsai designed the Robot Building for the Bank of Asia, which was acquired by United Overseas Bank in 2005.Williams, Nick B. \\"Third World Review: High rise battle of Bangkok - The 20-storey robot that is the focus of architectural acrimony.\\" The Guardian (May 22, 1987). He had been asked by the Bank of Asia's directors to design a building that reflected the modernization and computerization of banking\\"Buildings that put a sparkle in Thai skyline.\\" The Straits Times (April 4, 1997). and found inspiration in his son's toy robot.Algie, Jim. \\"Building A Name in Paris: The French capital plays host to an exhibition by Thailand's Renaissance Man.\\" Asia Week (December 17, 1999). Sumet designed the building in conscious opposition to postmodern styles of the era, particularly classical revivalism and high-tech architecture as embodied in the Centre Pompidou.Sumet, p. 79‚Äì80. While Sumet praised the inception of postmodernism as a protest against puritanical, bland modern design, he called it \\"a protest movement which seeks to replace without offering a replacement\\".Sumet, p. 79 Sumet dismissed mid-1980s classical revivalism as \\"intellectual[ly] bankrupt[]\\" and criticized the \\"catalogue[s] of meaningless architectural motifs\\" that characterized classical revivalism in Bangkok. He further dismissed high-tech architecture, \\"which engrosses itself in the machine while at the same time secretly...lov[ing]...handmade artifacts and honest manual labor\\", as a movement without a future.Sumet, p. 80. Sumet wrote that his building \\"need not be a robot\\" and that a \\"host of other metamorphoses\\" would suffice, so long as they could \\"free the spirit from the present intellectual impasse and propel it forward into the next century\\". He wrote that his design might be considered post-high-tech: rather than exhibiting the building's inner workings, he chose to adorn a finished product with the abstractions of mechanical parts.Sumet, p. 77. His building, he argued, struck against the 20th century vision of the machine as a \\"separate entity\\" often \\"elevated on a pedestal for worship\\" and, by becoming \\"a part of our daily lives, a friend, ourselves\\", cleared the way for the 21st century amalgam of machine and man. The building was completed in 1987 at a cost of US$10 million.Kusno, p. 197. By the mid-1980s, architectural modernism had faded in Bangkok; this building is one of the last examples of the style.Williams & Cummings, p. 28. Characteristics The building is 20 stories tall and has a total floor area of 23,506 m¬≤ (253,016 ft¬≤). The floor areas decrease progressively at the 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 18th floors; the staggered shape both contributes to the robot's appearance and is an efficient solution to setback regulations requiring an 18 degree incline from each side of the property line.Sumet, pp. 74, 76. The building's ground floor is a double-height banking hall.Sumet, p. 76. The hall's interior architecture, designed in association with the firm 7 Associates, was designed to further the robotic appearance of the building; four sculptures by Thai artist Thaveechai Nitiprabha stand at the main door.Sumet, p. 77. Mezzanine floors located on each side of the banking hall contain offices and meeting rooms. The building's second floor features a large multipurpose hall, offices, and training rooms, and its upper floors contain general office space. An eight- story parking garage is located behind the main building. Robot Building as seen from left The decorative exterior contributes its building's robotic appearance, though it often serves practical functions as well.Sumet, p. 74, 76‚Äì77. Two antennas on the building's roof are used for communications and as lightning rods. On the building's upper facade, in front of the main meeting and dining rooms of the top executive suites, are two 6 m (19.7 ft) lidded eyeballs that serve as windows. The eyeballs are made of reflective glass; the lids are made of metallic louvers. Nuts made of glass-reinforced concrete adorn the building's sides; the building's largest nuts measure 3.8 m (12.5 ft) in diameter and were the largest in the world at the time of their construction. The building's east and west walls (the robot's sides) have few apertures to shield its interior from the sun and to increase energy efficiency, and its north and south sides (the robot's front and back) are tinted curtain walls whose bright blue color was chosen because it was the symbol of the Bank of Asia. Recognition The Robot Building was selected by the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles as one of the 50 seminal buildings of the century.\\"Sumet Jumsai.\\" ArchNet digital library at archnet.com. Accessed November 13, 2007. The building also earned Sumet an award from Chicago's Athenaeum Museum of Architecture and Design, the first such award given to a Thai designer.\\"Corporate Focus: Propaganda coup in decor market; Inventions: Original designs intended to make people ask 'What is this?'\\" Bangkok Post (August 6, 2001).
