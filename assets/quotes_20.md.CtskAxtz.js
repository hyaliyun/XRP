It gives 40 per cent of the Kerala‚Äôs rice requirement and acts as a natural drainage system for Thrissur city and Thrissur District. The Kole Wetlands is one of largest, highly productive and threatened wetlands in Kerala and it comes in Central Asian Flyway of migratory birds. Kole Wetlands in Puzhakkal,Enamavu], Thrissur City History From 18th century onwards, rice cultivation in Kole lands is said to have been started. But the Thrissur Kole lands recorded rice cultivation dates back to 1916 only. Geography The word Kole is a Malayalam word, and means that a bumper yield. It is a particular cultivation method adopted in wastelands in Thrissur District from December to May which otherwise is submerged from June to November, half of the year. The Kole wetlands lies between 10¬∞ 20' and 10¬∞ 40' N latitudes and 75¬∞ 58' and between 76¬∞ 11' E longitudes. The Kole wetlands are low lying tracts located 0.5 to 1m below Mean Sea Level (MSL) and remain submerges for about six months in a year. Kole lands in Thrissur are spread over eight blocks. The average annual rainfall is 3,200 mm and temperature varied from 28¬∞C to 31¬∞5¬∞C. The Kole Wetlands cover an area of about 13,632 hectares spread over Thrissur district and Malappuram district. The area extends from Chalakudy River in South to Bharathappuzha River in the North, and to Ponnani Taluk. The Kole Wetlands acts as natural drainage system for Thrissur city and Thrissur district through a network of canals and ponds which connects different parts of Kole Wastelands to Enamavu river{one of the smallest River in Kerala,Canoli Canal,Chettuva River and then to the Arabian sea. It is fertile with Alluvium soil which is deposited Kechery and Karuvannoor river in the monsoon. Fauna Puzhakkal River, one of the rivers which go through the Kole Wetlands and provide water for rice cultivation In terms of the number of birds, the Thrissur Kole Wetlands is the third largest in India after Chilika Lake in Orissa and Amipur Tank in Gujarat. It has been recognised as one of India's Important Bird Areas by BirdLife International. According to studies, there are 241 species of birds like spot-billed pelican, darter, Oriental darter, black-headed ibis, painted stork, black-bellied tern, cinereous vulture and greater spotted eagle. Fishes like Caranx, Cyprinidae, mangrove red snapper, Megalops cyprinoides and barramundi are also found in Kole Wetland. Sunrise over the Pullu Padam with a Morning drizzle Bird's Nest Thrissur Kole Wetlands Threat The main threat to Kole Wetlands is expansion of cities and towns like city of Thrissur. The boom in construction industry, especially the real estate business in Central Kerala, has rung the alarm bell for the Kole wetlands. Coconut cultivation, construction of buildings and houses, conversion of fields for sand and clay mining and brick kilns, hunting of wetland birds are the main threats for the Kole wetlands. Fresh water shortage and quality of water due to water intrusion from the Canoly Canal has been reported from various parts of Kole wetlands in Thrissur district. Kole Development Agency Rice cultivation in Kole Wastelands in Thrissur Metropolitan Area Farming Thrissur Kole Wetlands The Government of India has approved Rs 425-crore project for the comprehensive development of Thrissur Kole fields. The fund will be used for infrastructure development, construction of bunds, canals, roads, farm mechanisation in Kole fields. At the Rs 15 crore a research centre would be set up to study the Kole land development. The Government of Kerala has formed a Special Purpose Vehicle for the implementation of the Kole development project and the District Collector of Thrissur is designated as special officer to coordinate implementation of the package. For the implementation of the project, Government of Kerala has opened an agency known as Kole Development Agency (KDA) in Thrissur City on 30 June for the development of Kole farming. Thrissur District Collector is the special officer to implement the project.

They are: (1) nucleosynthesis, the assembly within stars of the atomic nuclei of the common chemical elements by nuclear reactions occurring therein; (2) astronomical detection of gamma-ray lines emitted by radioactive atoms created and ejected by supernovae; (3) mathematical models of the growth over time of the interstellar abundances of radioactive atoms; (4) predictions of the existence of interstellar cosmic dust grains from individual stars‚Äîindividual chunks of long-dead stars. He named those stardust, each containing isotopically identifiable radioactive atoms of the host stars; (5) predictions of the condensation of solid grains of pure carbon within hot, oxygen-dominated radioactive supernova gases. Clayton launched these original ideas from research positions at California Institute of Technology, Rice University, Cambridge University (England), Max-Plank Institute for Nuclear Physics (Germany), Durham University (England) and Clemson University during an international academic career spanning six decades. Clayton also authored four books for the public: (1) a novel, The Joshua Factor (1985), is a parable of the origin of mankind utilizing the mystery of solar neutrinos; (2) a science autobiography, Catch a Falling Star; (3) a mid-career memoir The Dark Night Sky, of cultural interest owing to Clayton's conception of it in 1970 as layout for a movie with Italian filmmaker Roberto Rossellini about growing awareness during a cosmological life (See Personal below); (4)Handbook of Isotopes in the Cosmos (Cambridge Univ.

Sloan Foundation Fellow (1966‚Äì68); Fulbright Fellow (1979‚Äì80); Fellow of St. Mary's College, Durham University (1987); SERC Senior Visiting Fellow, The Open University, Milton Keynes, U.K. (1993). In 1993 Clayton was named Distinguished Alumnus of Southern Methodist University, thirty-seven years after his BS degree there. Early life and education Clayton was born on March 18, 1935 in a modest rented duplex on Walnut Street in Shenandoah, Iowa while his parents were temporarily away from both family farms near Fontanelle seeking work during the Great Depression. Clayton spent much of his early childhood on those farms and has rhapsodized over his love of the farm. Clayton attended public school in Texas after his father's new job as co-pilot for Braniff Airlines moved the family to Dallas in 1939. His parents purchased a home in the already renowned Highland Park school system, providing him excellent education. He graduated third in his 1953 class of 92 studentsCatch a Falling Star op cit , p. 84 from Highland Park High School. Becoming the first among his entire Iowa relations to seek post-high-school education, Clayton matriculated at Southern Methodist University and excelled in physics and mathematics, graduating summa cum laude in 1956. At the urging of his SMU professors, he applied as a physics research student to California Institute of Technology (Caltech), which he attended bearing a National Science Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship. In the 1957 nuclear physics course at Caltech Clayton learned from William Alfred Fowler about a new theory that the chemical elements had been assembled within the stars by nuclear reactions occurring there. He was captivated for life by that idea. Clayton completed his Ph.D. Thesis in 1961 on the growth of the abundances of the heavy elements owing to the slow capture of free neutrons (the s process) by more abundant lighter elements in stars. Clayton and his wife Mary LouNote: Mary Lou Clayton was hired by Mathew Sands on the Ford Foundation project for these lectures. Donald Clayton contributed time to help identify the physics vocabulary that Feynman used. See Catch a Falling Star, p. 142 played a small role in producing the celebrated Feynman Lectures on Physics by converting the taped audio of Richard Feynman's lectures to prose. Caltech afforded Clayton the chance to meet and later become a lifelong friend of Fred Hoyle, British cosmologist and creator of the theory of nucleosynthesis in stars. Hoyle exerted strong lifetime influence on Clayton. Clayton's published collaborations with Fowler (1983 Nobel Laureate in Physics) as Fowler's research student (1957‚Äì60) and subsequently as Fowler's post-doctoral research associate (1961‚Äì63) launched Clayton's scientific career. He established himself at Caltech as a new worker in the field of nucleosynthesis in stars by calculating the first time-dependent models of both the s process and the fast neutron-capture chains of the r process of heavy-element nucleosynthesis and of the nuclear abundance quasiequilibrium that establishes the highly radioactive abundances between silicon and nickel during silicon burning in stars. He came onto the field early, when nucleosynthesis was a vibrant, modern frontier. Citations are in the Nucleosynthesis section below. Academic history A historic connection of Clayton's academic career to NASA's Apollo Program arose arose through establishment by Rice University of its Department of Space Science in 1963. This action by Rice University provided the academic position assumed by Clayton in 1963. Clayton described this good fortune in his autobiography.p. 159-163, Catch a Falling Star His academic research into five fields of astrophysics championed by him is detailed in section 5 below. Foundational academic positions at Caltech, Rice University and Clemson University were augmented by international breadth: seven-year-long academic affiliations in Cambridge (1967‚Äì1974) and later in Heidelberg (1976‚Äì82),Clayton, p. 178, Chapters 10 and 15 of his autobiography Catch a Falling Star as well as by visiting summer positions in Cardiff UK (1976, 1977)Chap. 15, p.369 of Clayton's autobiography Catch a Falling Star as well as sabbatical leaves in Cambridge (1971), Heidelberg (1981) and Durham University UK (1987).p. 439‚Äì442, autobiography Catch a Falling Star Following his two-year (1961‚Äì63) postdoctoral research fellowship at Caltech, Clayton was awarded an Assistant Professorship, one of the four founding faculty members in Rice University's newly created Department of Space Science (later renamed Space Physics and Astronomy). There he initiated a graduate-student course explaining nuclear reactions in stars as the mechanism for the creation of the atoms of our chemical elements. His pioneering textbook based on that course (Principles of Stellar Evolution and Nucleosynthesis, McGraw-Hill 1968) earned ongoing praise. In 2018, 50 years after its first publication, it is still in common usageUniversity of Chicago Press, reprint edition 1983 in graduate education throughout the world. At Rice Clayton was awarded the newly endowed Andrew Hays Buchanan Professorship of Astrophysics in 1968 and held that endowed professorship for twenty years until responding to the opportunity to guide a new astrophysics program at Clemson University in 1989. During the 1970s at Rice University Clayton guided Ph.D. theses of many research students who achieved renown, especially Stanford E. Woosley, William Michael Howard, H. C. Goldwire, Richard A. Ward, Michael J. Newman, Eliahu Dwek, Mark Leising and Kurt Liffman. Senior thesis students at Rice University included Bradley S. Meyer and Lucy Ziurys, both of whom forged distinguished careers in the subjects of those senior theses. Historical photos of several students can be seen on Clayton' s photo archive for the history of nuclear astrophysics. Clayton followed the historic Apollo 11 mission while on holiday with his family in Ireland while traveling to Cambridge UK for his third research summer there. Letters in winter 1966 from W.A. Fowler unexpectedly invited Clayton to return to Caltech in order to coauthor a book on nucleosynthesis with Fowler and Fred Hoyle. In his autobiography Clayton quotes these letters. He accepted that offer but the book was never written because while he was resident at Caltech Clayton was invited by Fred Hoyle to Cambridge University (UK) in spring 1967 to advise a research program in nucleosynthesis at Hoyle's newly created Institute of Astronomy. The award to Clayton of an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Fellowship (1966‚Äì68) facilitated leaves of absence from Rice University for this purpose. Clayton exerted that research leadership in Cambridge during 1967-72 by bringing his research students from Rice University with him. That prolific period ended abruptly by Hoyle's unexpected resignation from Cambridge University in 1972.Fred Hoyle, Home is where the wind blows (University Science Books, Mill Valley CA 1994) p. 372-376 Clayton was during these years a Visiting Fellow of Clare Hall. At Rice University W.D. Arnett, S.E. Woosley, and W.M. Howard published jointly numerous innovative studies with Clayton on the topic of explosive supernova nucleosynthesis.W. David Arnett & Donald D. Clayton, \\"Explosive nucleosynthesis in stars\\", Nature 227, pp. 780-784 (1970); Woosley, S.E, Arnett, W.D., Clayton, D.D., \\"Explosive burning of oxygen and silicon\\", Astrophys. Journal Supplement 26, 231‚Äì312 (1973) During his Cambridge years, Clayton proposedClayton, S. Colgate and G. Fishman, Astrophysical Journal 155, 75 (1969); Clayton and J. Silk, Astrophysical Journal 158, L43 (1969) radioactive gamma-ray-emitting nuclei as nucleosynthesis sources for the field of gamma-ray astronomy of line transitions from radioactive nuclei with coauthors (Stirling Colgate, Gerald J. Fishman, and Joseph Silk). Detection of these gamma-ray lines two decades later provided the decisive proof that iron had been synthesized explosively in supernovae in the form of radioactive nickel isotopes rather than as iron itself, which Fowler and Hoyle had both advocated. During (1977‚Äì84) Clayton resided part-time annually at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg as Humboldt Prize awardee, sponsored by Till Kirsten. Annual academic leaves from Rice University facilitated this. There he joined the Meteoritical Society seeking audience for his newly published theoretical picture‚ÄúExtinct radioactivities: Trapped residuals of pre-solar grains‚Äù, Astrophys. J., 199, 765‚Äì69, (1975); ‚Äú22Na, Ne-E, Extinct radioactive anomalies and unsupported 40Ar‚Äù, Nature, 257, 36-37, (1975); ‚ÄúCosmoradiogenic ghosts and the origin of Ca-Al-rich inclusions‚Äù, Earth and Planetary Sci.

He hoped that such interstellar grains could be discovered within meteorites;Clayton, Catch a falling star, op cit, p. 354‚Äì57, p. 387‚Äì395 and he also advanced a related theory that he called cosmic chemical memoryCosmic chemical memory: a new astronomy (1981 George Darwin Lecture of the RAS), QJRAS 23, 174-212 (1982) by which the effects of stardust can be measured in meteoritic minerals even if stardust itself no longer exists there. Clayton designated the crystalline component of interstellar dust that had condensed thermally from hot and cooling stellar gases by a new scientific name, stardust. Stardust became an important component of cosmic dust. Clayton has describedChapter 14 of his autobiography Catch a Falling Star the stiff resistance encountered from meteoriticist referees of his early papers advancing this new theory. He nonetheless established that research program at Rice University, where he continued guiding graduate-student research on that topic. He and student Kurt Liffman computed a pathbreaking history of survival rates of refractory stardust in the interstellar medium after its ejection from stars;Stochastic histories of refractory interstellar dust, Proceedings Lunar and Planetary Science Conference 18, 637-657 (1988); Astrophys. J. 340, 853-868 (1989) and with student Mark D. Leising computed a propagation model of positron annihilation lines within nova explosionsAstrophys. J. 323, 159-169 (1987) and of the angular distribution of gamma ray lines from radioactive 26Al in the galaxy.Astrophys. J. 294, 591-598 (1985) Following laboratory discovery in 1987 of meteoritic stardust bearing unequivocal isotopic markers of stars, Clayton was awarded the 1991 Leonard Medal, the highest honor of the Meteoritical Society. Feeling vindicated,Clayton's own words in Catch a falling star op cit attest to his sense of vindication over this issue:(1) The telephone rings in s-process stardust, p 400-401; (2)\\"Comic battle over the Leonard Medal, p. 489‚Äì491 Clayton exulted in Nature \\"the human race holds solid samples of supernovae in its hands and studies them in terrestrial laboratories\\".Donald D. Clayton, Nature 404, 329 (2000) In 1989 Clayton accepted a professorship at Clemson University to develop a graduate research program in astrophysics there.Catch a Falling Star, Chap. 18 He began this academic segment (1989‚Äìpresent) by hiring three talented young astrophysicists Mark Leising, Dieter Hartmann and Bradley S. Meyer: Catch a Falling Star photo p. 494 to vitalize joint research with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (launched in 1991 after several delays). Its four instruments successfully detected gamma-ray lines identifying several of the radioactive nuclei that Clayton had predicted to be present in supernova remnants. Clayton had been designated ten years earlier Co-Investigator on the NASA proposal submitted by James Kurfess for the Oriented Scintillation Spectrometer Experiment OSSE, one of the four successful instruments carried into orbit by Space Shuttle Atlantis, and he carried that research contract to Clemson. Simultaneously Clayton developed at Clemson his stardust research, introducing annual workshops for its researchers. The initial NASA-sponsored workshop at Clemson in 1990 was so lively that it was repeated the following year jointly with Washington University (St. Louis) cosponsorship, and in later years cosponsored also by the University of Chicago and by the Carnegie Institution of Washington. These workshops featured the excitement of new isotopic discoveries, and also helped participants focus their ideas for submission of abstracts to NASA's Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. Otherwise participants' workshop discussions were not shared or publicized. Eventually a unique new goal became to assemble from his large personal collection of photographs a web-based archive for the history of nuclear astrophysics and to donate the original photographs to the Center for the History of PhysicsCenter for History of Physics is a wing of American Institute of Physics. It can be reached on the web at aip.org and clicking on History Programs The thrusts of Clayton's career at Clemson University are well represented on that Photo Archive by photos between 1990 and 2014. Following his retirement from academic duties in 2007, Clayton remained quite active in research problems involving condensation of dust within supernovaeDonald Clayton & Bradley S.

Clayton's promotion to full professor at Rice University was brisk (1963‚Äì69). In 1989 he resigned to accept an offer from Clemson University in South Carolina to guide the establishment of a research program in astrophysics. Clemson University had launched an effort to move into the top 20 of public universities, and Clayton's hire was part of that plan. He resides with Nancy in historic G. W. Gignilliat House (1898) in Seneca, South Carolina (pop. 8,000), seven miles from the city of Clemson. They jointly have one son who grew up in that house, Andrew, born in 1987 in Houston. Clayton's three previous children arose from his earlier marriages. A son (Donald Douglas Clayton b.1960, Pasadena CA) lives in Houston and a daughter (Alia Clayton Fisher, b. 1977, Houston) lives with her husband and four children in Longmont, Colorado. Another son, Devon Clayton (b. 1961 Pasadena), died in 1996 in Seneca SC. Clayton has one brother (d. 1980) and two sisters living in Texas, two of whom were also born in Iowa. Clayton's mother and father had both been born on family farms in Fontanelle IA to parents Catch a Falling Star, p. 6-9 who had lived their entire lives on Fontanelle farms. Their own parents had immigrated to Iowa near 1850 from England and Germany. Two of Clayton's great grandfathers (Kembery and Clayton) fought in the Civil War (North). Robert M. Clayton fought in Sherman's Army at the battle of Atlanta.National Archives, Muster Roll, 43rd Company, Army of Ohio Infantry While at Rice University Clayton was introduced by patron of the arts Dominique de Menil to Italian filmmaker Roberto Rossellini, and they jointly conceived of a film about one scientist's deepening realizations during a cosmological life, a sequence of experiences which Clayton proposed p. 245‚Äì249 in Catch a Falling Star. The wiki article on Dominique de Menil documents the interaction of the de Menils with Rosselini through the Rice University Media Center to provide for that project. In summer 1970 Clayton spent two weeks in Rome working daily with Rosselini on that effort, which failed owing to insufficient financial support or to insufficiently theatrical plan.No documentation exists for this failure, so this conclusion is based on Clayton's memory of it in his autobiography Clayton's published early memoir The Dark Night Sky: a personal adventure in cosmologyQuadrangle/The New York Times Book Co. (1975): A book columnist for the Washington Post wrote on March 21, 1976: \\"Altogether more personal (than other books on cosmology that he was reviewing), The Dark Night Sky alternates cosmology with affable reminiscence. Clayton knows the rapture of astronomy and uses it to shuttle engagingly back and forth between Copernicus, Einstein, Stonehenge, the Milky Way and punts on Cambridge's Cam. A brooding, ecumenical enthusiast, Clayton dreads the vacant interstellar spaces as much as he loves galaxies, Texas, and the maple tree he planted a quarter of a century ago. His is a book of brainy charm\\" laid out his plan for that film. Citations of seminal research Clayton's research innovations in astrophysics and planetary science lay in five disciplines that have been largely introduced above; but the five sections here provide more details and more complete citations to his work for readers wanting more information. Clayton's own history of each topic as described within his autobiography, Catch a Falling Star, is given at the end of each section. The references are to Clayton's noteworthy published papers. Clayton's independent style produced an unusual 120 single-author research papers, a relatively large number for astrophysicists. Nuclear physics origin of the chemical elements (Nucleosynthesis) Trained at Caltech as a nuclear physicist by Wm. A. Fowler, Clayton was well positioned to consider interactions of heavy nuclei with neutrons. These were believed by Fowler to govern the nucleosynthesis of nuclei heavier than iron. Clayton established that theory by calculations of the isotopic abundances of heavier elements produced by neutron irradiation of iron in stars for both the slow neutron capture S-process and the rapid neutron capture R-process of heavy-element stellar nucleosynthesis (processes first defined by B2FHBurbidge, Burbidge, Fowler & Hoyle RMP 29, 547 (1957)). Clayton's two papers in 1961 and 1965 on those topics demonstrated that the solar-system abundances had been created not by a single neutron irradiation but as superpositions of abundance patterns established in presolar stars by differing neutron irradiations.[Donald D. Clayton,W.A. Fowler, T. Hull & B.Zimmerman\\"Neutron Capture Chains in Heavy Element Synthesis\\" Annals of Physics, 12, 331-408 (1961); Phillip A. Seeger, Donald D. Clayton and W. A. Fowler \\"Nucleosynthesis of Heavy Elements by Neutron Capture\\" Ap. J. Suppl. 11, 121-166 (1965)] His 1961 calculations of s-process abundance patterns, achieved by mathematical analysis rather than by not-yet-mature digital computation, established Clayton as a nucleosynthesis theorist. They also provided a standard model for the s process abundance patternsClayton published subsequent papers on the mathematical properties of that standard model, each bearing the title s-process studies, followed by a specific subtitle. Those papers and their subtitles were: \\"exact solution to a chain having two distinct cross section values\\", Astrophys. J. 192, 501 (1974 with M.J. Newman; \\"exact evaluation of an exponential distribution of exposures\\", Astrophys. J. 193, 397 (1974) with R.A. Ward; \\"Branching and the time scale\\", Astrophys. J. Suppl. 31, 35 (1976) with R.A. Ward and M. J. Newman; \\"Xenon and krypton isotopic abundances\\", Astrophys. J. 224, 1000 (1978) with R. A. Ward; \\"s-process studies in the light of new experimental cross section: distribution of neutron fluences and r-process residuals\\", Astrophys. J. 257, 821 (1982) with F. Kaeppeler, H. Beer, K. Wisshak, R.L. Macklin and R. A. Ward that guided four decades of progress on the s process abundances and on derived characteristics of the r-process abundances. In 1967 Clayton turned to the supernova origin of the abundances of elements that can be created in stars from hydrogen and helium alone. Those so-called primary nucleosynthesis nuclei having atomic weights between silicon and nickel (A=28-62) are very abundant. To understand their dramatic alternating abundances he tested a new conceptual idea that he named nuclear quasiequilibrium during silicon burning The quasiequilibrium concept did explain the observed numbers of isotopes in the A=28-62 mass range, which had previously been unsolved./ The B2FH review \\"Synthesis of the Elements in Stars\\" RMP 29, 547 (1957) had little correct to say in explanation of primary nucleosynthesis in this mass region. The highly acclaimed B2FH review focussed more on isotopes that can be converted in stars to other isotopes, the so- called secondary processes Nuclear quasiequilibrium was at that time the grandest advance in theory of primary nucleosynthesis in supernovae since Hoyle's 1954 paper, whose focus it validated. Of extreme importance was its demonstration that supernova silicon burning should become profoundly radioactive because rapid quasiequilibrium between atomic weights A=44-62 is overwhelmingly of radioactive nuclei.Phys. Rev.Letters 20, 161 (1968); Astrophys. J. 16,299 (1968) Clayton's recent description in 2016 in terms of a secondary supernova machine of this important process with B. S. MeyerDonald D. Clayton & B.S. Meyer, \\"The Secondary Supernova Machine: Gravitational Compression, Stored Coulomb Energy, and SNII Displays\\", New Astronomy Reviews 71, 1-8 (2016) clarified that the intense radioactivity resulted from supernova shock waves forcing excess Coulomb energy into those nuclei. Abundant radioactivity is widely regarded as Clayton's most important discovery for astronomy because it controls the late luminosity of supernovae. Quasiequilibrium demanded that even the mountain-like abundance peak at iron was synthesized as radioactive nickel parents 56Ni and 57Ni in the supernovae explosions rather than as iron directlyD.Clayton, S. Colgate & G, Fishman, Astrophys. J. 155, 75 (1969); S. Woosley, W. Arnett & D. Clayton, Astrophys. J. Suppl. 26, 231‚Äì312 (1973). See Radioactive Progenitors on p. 286‚Äì87 as Hoyle and Fowler maintained. This discovery ignited Clayton's long and productive focus with radioactive isotopes ejected from supernovae, leading to his predictions of both gamma-ray line astronomyD.Clayton, S. Colgate & G, Fishman, Astrophys. J. 155, 75 (1969); D. Clayton, Astrophys. J. 188, 155 (1974); D. Clayton, Astrophys. J. 198, 151 (1975) and of radioactive supernova grains condensed from hot supernova gasesD. Clayton, Astrophys. J. 199, 765 (1975); D. Clayton, Nature 257,36 (1975); D. Clayton, Moon & Planets 19, 109 (1978) Experimental confirmation two decades later of both predictions spurred those new fields of astronomy and brought Clayton high honors. At Rice University a prolific 1970‚Äì74 with colleagues W. David Arnett, Stanford E. Woosley and W.Michael Howard explored other explosive nucleosynthesis caused by the radially outgoing supernova shock wave.[Explosive nucleosynthesis in stars, W.D. Arnett & D.D. Clayton, Nature 227, 780‚Äì84 (1970); ‚ÄúThermonuclear origin of rare neutron-rich isotopes‚Äù Howard, Arnett & Clayton, Physical Review Letters, 27, 1607, (1971) and Astrophys. J., 175, 201, (1972); S. Woosley, W. Arnett & D. Clayton, ‚ÄúThe explosive burning of oxygen and silicon‚Äù, Astrophys. J. Supplement Series, 26, 231‚Äì312, (1973)] Leadership of nucleosynthesis seems to have shifted by 1975 to Rice University. During 1967-72 Clayton resided half time in Cambridge U.K. at Hoyle's invitationCatch a Falling Star Chapter 10, p.210 to import and advise nucleosynthesis research at Hoyle's newly constructed Institute of Theoretical Astronomy. Clayton did this by bringing his graduate students at Rice with him to Cambridge. After Hoyle's abrupt 1972 resignation from Cambridge Hoyle made three research visits with Clayton at Rice University.http://www.clemson.edu/ces/astro/NucleoArchive/PhotoList/1970s/73HC_Rice.html shows photographs of Hoyle and Clayton at work in Houston.http://www.clemson.edu/ces/astro/NucleoArchive/PhotoList/1970s/75letterHC.html After Clayton's 1989 move to Clemson University, his research with Bradley S. Meyer showed how the uniquely puzzling 48Ca isotope of calcium had become so abundant in the GalaxyB. S. Meyer & D.D. Clayton, \\"48Ca Production in Matter expanding from High Temperature and Density\\" Astrophys. J. 462, 825 (1996); Meyer, Krishnan & Clayton, Astrophys. J. Suppl. 26, 231-312 (1973) owing to a relatively rare form of Type Ia supernovae in which the appropriate neutron- enriched quasiiequilibrium nucleosynthesis occurs. They subsequently explained why the minor 95Mo and 97Mo isotopes of the element molybdenum had become dominant in supernovae stardustB.S. Meyer & D. D, Clayton, Astrophys.J., 540, L49‚Äì52 (2000) explaining an experimental riddle in stardust isotopic abundances. Clayton began in 2000 a spirited prose description of isotopic nucleosynthesisHandbook of Isotopes in the Cosmos Cambridge University Press 2003 in order to increase its accessibility both to laymen and to scientists conducting isotopic analyses of stardust. Becoming increasingly disappointed at the same time that Hoyle's theory of primary nucleosynthesis in massive stars was being overlooked and forgotten after he fell into science disfavor over his views on interstellar biology, Clayton published two historical papers reestablishing community consciousness of Hoyle's pioneering achievement.Donald D.Clayton \\"Hoyle‚Äôs Equation\\" Science 318, 1876‚Äì77 (2007); Donald D. Clayton \\"Fred Hoyle, primary nucleosynthesis and radioactivity\\" New Astronomy Reviews 52, 360‚Äì63 (2008). Younger scientists who never knew Hoyle were overlooking what his 1954 paper had achieved See chapters 7, 9 and 18 of Clayton's life in Catch a Falling Star. Gamma-ray-line astronomy of radioactive nuclei in supernovae Clayton, Colgate and Fishman's 1969 prediction that motivated pursuing gamma-ray-line astronomy as an empirical test of supernova nucleosynthesis was recognized in the American Astronomical Society Centennial Volume as one of the 50 most influential astrophysics papers of the 20th century. Observational discovery of those gamma rays would later confirm explosive nucleosynthesis theory and cement mankind's understanding of the profoundly radioactive nature of supernovae. It is the innovation for which Clayton is best known. His NASA-funded research at Rice University during the 1970s sought after additional nuclear prospectsDonald Clayton, \\"Cosmic radioactivity: a gamma-ray search for the origins of atomic nuclei, in ESSAYS IN NUCLEAR ASTROPHYSICS, Barnes, Clayton & Schramm, eds., pp. 401‚Äì426 (Cambridge University Press, 1982) for that high-energy spectroscopic astronomy, which is based on the recognizable energies of gamma rays emitted by individual radioactive nuclei that had recently been ejected from supernovae. Today it has blossomed with many observational results after quickly becoming a goal for future space astronomy missions, especially at a time when Compton Gamma Ray Observatory was being proposed to NASA in 1977 (launched by Space Shuttle Atlantis in 1991). Hopes were suddenly raised for a detectable source when in 1987 optical astronomers discovered a nearby supernova called SN1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Clayton described those hopes from his 1987 sabbatical-year office at Durham University UK as a mounting excitement generated by observed X-ray emission from its supernova surface.\\"Hard X rays imply more to come\\", Nature 330, 423 (1987) His research with L-S The augmented understanding of those hard X-rays and their derivation from the radioactivity gamma rays permeating supernova interiors.[Clayton & The \\"Bremmsstrahlung and Energetic Electrons in Supernovae\\" (1991) ApJ, 375, 221] Supernova 1987A gamma-ray-line emission did yield exciting first detections of those gamma-ray lines from 56Co\\"Gamma-ray line emission from SN1987A\\", S.M.

Letters, 399, L137 (1992) (by OSSE with Clayton a coauthor) thereby establishing this field of astronomy. CGRO, the space gamma-ray telescope mission that detected several predicted gamma-ray lines, was the second mission of NASA‚Äôs Great Observatories program. In 1977 at Rice University Clayton had been named Co-Investigator for the NASA-approved proposal for the OSSE spectrometer on CGRO, and in 1982 he summarized physical expectations for several gamma-ray-line emitting young nuclei. Key to the intense supernova radioactivity had been Clayton's 1967 discovery that rapid-silicon-burning was dominated by abundances of radioactive alpha-particle nuclei (those having equal numbers of protons and neutronsPhys. Rev. Lett. 20, 161 (1968); Principles of Stellar Evolution and Nucleosynthesis, Chap. 7 (1968); \\"Explosive Burning of Oxygen and Silicon\\" Astrophys. J.

J., 142, 189-200, 1965] but r-process nuclei are much less abundant in supernovae than are the nuclei fused during silicon-burning. So it was the latter that became the demonstrated source of radioactive nuclei. Chapters 8, 11, 17 and 18 in Catch a Falling Star, whose title Clayton has said he chose as an allusion to the gravitational core collapse that triggers these supernovae. Astronomy of Stardust Clayton introduced the idea that the relative abundances of the isotopes in tiny solid dust grains that condensed within hot gas leaving individual stars would be observable in such single dust grains. Those grains reveal the isotopic composition of their parent stars. He named these solids stardust,Precondensed Matter: Key to the Early Solar System, Moon & Planets 19, 109 (1978) postulating thereby a new component of interstellar Cosmic dust. Stardust inherits its unusual isotopic compositions from the evolved nuclear composition of the parent star within which that grain condensed. Clayton's initial steps[ ‚ÄúExtinct radioactivities: Trapped residuals of pre-solar grains‚Äù, Astrophys. J., 199, 765-69, (1975); ‚Äú22Na, Ne-E, Extinct radioactive anomalies and unsupported 40Ar‚Äù, Nature, 257, 36-37, (1975) focused on large isotopic excesses in supernova dust grains owing to decays of abundant short-lived radioactive nuclei that were created in the nuclear explosion and then condensed within a few months in the cooling ejecta; but it was generalized to all types of stellar mass loss in 1978.Donald D.

Lett., 224, L93‚Äì95, (1978) These isotopic abundance ratios were predicted to differ from common solar-system ratios more than any that had ever been observed; but Clayton emphasized their likelihood in stardust. He described stardust as a ubiquitous component within interstellar dust, a peppering of the interstellar medium. These papers initially encountered such incredulity in the field of cosmochemistry that most were rejected first and published only later;Chap. 14, \\"Falling Stardust\\", p. 299‚Äì368 , Catch a Falling Star (iUniverse; New York 2009 nonetheless, Robert Walker and Ernst Zinner at Washington University undertook instrumental development that would prove capable of measuring isotope ratios in such tiny solids.K. D. McKeegan, Met. and Planetary Sciences, 42, 1045 (2007) reviews this history Almost two decades of experimental search were required before intact stardust grains, (also called presolar grains by some meteoriticists), were successfully isolated from the vast remainder of normal presolar dust particles. Tiny stardust grains were successfully extracted from meteorites and their isotopes counted by precision laboratory technique of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). Those dramatic experimental discoveries in the 1990s, led primarily by Ernst Zinner (d.2015)Clayton and Zinner became close friends and colleagues. Clayton's obituary for Zinner appears in the February (2016) issue of PHYSICS TODAY. and his colleagues at Washington University (St. Louis),, but also by scientists in Chicago, Pasadena, and Mainz confirmed the stunning reality of this new type of astronomy; namely, solid interstellar dust particles that condensed within stellar gases long before the earth was created are today studied in laboratories on earth. These tiny stones are quite literally solid pieces of long dead stars. This was a revolutionary idea, endowing that experimental search with excitement. The discovery experiments dispelled skepticism surrounding Clayton's predictions, causing him to be awarded the 1991 Leonard Medal of the Meteoritical Society. Main modern themes of this solid-state astronomical science have been summarized in 2004 by Clayton & Nittler.Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics 42, 39‚Äì78 (2004) To debate the meanings of the frequent new discoveries Clayton initiated in 1990 at Clemson University an annual series of workshops co- sponsored by NASA and planned jointly with Ernst Zinner and his colleagues at Washington University (St. Louis). These workshops have continued annually for 27 years. Clayton continued new interpretations of stardust for three decades after his founding ideas.[‚ÄúPlacing the Sun in Galactic Chemical Evolution: Mainstream SiC Particles‚Äù, Astrophys.

He interpreted them as arising from stars born in a galactic merger of Milky Way interstellar gas with the interstellar gas from a smaller captured satellite galaxy possessing a lower gaseous isotopic abundance ratio for 30Si28Si‚ÄúA Presolar Galactic Merger Spawned the SiC-grain Mainstream‚Äù, Astrophys. J. 598, 313-24 (2003)] owing to its lesser degree of galactic abundance evolution.\\"Isotopic anomalies: chemical memory of galactic evolution\\" Astrophys. J 334, 191 (1988) That picture audaciously claimed that the merger of a small satellite galaxy with the Milky Way (a galactic-scale event) can be seen within microscopic interstellar grains of sand. Chapters 14 and 15 and pages 504‚Äì508 in Catch a Falling Star Galactic abundance evolution of radioactive nuclei Clayton created mathematical tools for calculating the interstellar abundances of radioactive nuclei in the Galaxy. In 1964 he discovered a new method for measuring the age of interstellar nuclei based on the larger than expected observed abundances of stable daughters of radioactive nuclei.[Donald D. Clayton, ‚ÄúCosmoradiogenic chronologies of nucleosynthesis‚Äù, Astrophys. J., 139, 637‚Äì63, (1964)] The decays of rhenium-187 to osmium-187 and of uranium and thorium to three differing isotopes of lead (Pb) defined the cosmoradiogenic chronologies. Merging his cosmoradiogenic method with an earlier method based only on the abundances of uranium and thorium themselvesW.A. Fowler and Fred Hoyle, Annals of Phys. 10, 280(1960) still did not yield a consistent galactic age, however. Clayton wroteNuclear cosmochronology within analytic models of the chemical evolution of the solar neighborhood, Mon. Notices Roy. Astron. Soc., 234, 1‚Äì36 (1988) that the discord arose from inadequate treatments of both the history of star formation in the Galaxy and of the rate of infall of pristine metal- free gas onto the young Milky Way, compounded by a prevailing but erroneous technique for computation of the radioactive abundances within interstellar gas. Reasoning that interstellar gas contains a higher concentrations of shorter-lived radioactive nuclei than do the stars, Clayton invented in 1985 new mathematical solutions for the simplified differential equations of galactic abundance evolution that for the first time rendered these relationships understandable,Donald Clayton, ‚ÄúGalactic chemical evolution and nucleocosmochronology: A standard model‚Äù, in Challenges and New Developments in Nucleosynthesis, W. D. Arnett, W. Hillebrandt, and J. W. Truran, eds., University of Chicago Press, 65‚Äì88 (1984); ‚ÄúNuclear cosmochronology within analytic models of the chemical evolution of the solar neighborhood‚Äù, Mon. Notices Roy. Astron. Soc., 234, 1‚Äì36 (1988); ‚ÄúIsotopic anomalies: Chemical memory of galactic evolution‚Äù, Astrophys. J., 334, 191‚Äì195, (1988) ending decades of poor reasoning about radioactive abundances. Clayton then calculated an age of 13-15 billion years for the oldest galactic nuclei, which would necessarily approximate the long-sought age of our galaxy. More recently radioactive cosmochronology has diminished in importance because more precise techniques for determining the age of the Milky Way have been discovered in the cosmic microwave background. Nonetheless, his analytic solutions demonstrated importantly that the concentration of short-lived radioactive nuclei in interstellar gas had routinely been underestimated by the factor (k+1), where k is an integer near 2 or 3 that measures the steepness of the rate of decline of the infall of pristine gas onto our growing galactic mass.[Donald D. Clayton, ‚ÄúGalactic chemical evolution and nucleocosmochronology: A standard model‚Äù, in Challenges and New Developments in Nucleosynthesis, W. D. Arnett, W. Hillebrandt, and J. W. Truran, eds., University of Chicago Press, 65‚Äì88 (1984); ‚ÄúNuclear cosmochronology within analytic models of the chemical evolution of the solar neighborhood‚Äù, Mon. Notices Roy. Astron.

(Letters) 415, L25‚ÄìL29 (1993)] For scientific studies of the identities and the initial abundances of short-lived radioactive nuclei that remained alive at differing concentrations within the interstellar gas cloud that formed the solar system, but which are now extinct in the solar system, Clayton's factor (k+1) has grown in importance owing to experimental discoveries of many such nuclei within the meteorites. These are called the extinct radioactivities because none remain on earth today but which did leave clear evidence of their prior existence in meteorites. Solution for a model history for the origin of our solar system that simultaneously fits their residual abundances became the guiding principle for a new discipline that focuses on local extra nucleosynthesis near the solar interstellar cloud during the billion years preceding solar birth.[‚ÄúShort- lived Radioactivities and the Birth of the Sun‚Äù, B.S. Meyer & D.D. Clayton, Space Science Revs., 92, 133‚Äì152 (2000)] In 1983, at a time when astrophysicists relied for simplicity on a well mixed interstellar gas, Clayton introduced a new related aspect of the interstellar mediumDonald D. Clayton, ‚ÄúExtinct radioactivities: A three-phase mixing model‚Äù, Astrophys. J., 268, 381-384,1983 that has proven to be essential for understanding the abundances of the extinct radioactivities; namely the time required for isotopic mixing between freshly synthesized atoms ejected from supernovae with distinct physical phases of interstellar gas. He showed that because those time delays allowed more interstellar decay of radioactive nuclei, each phase of interstellar gas contains a distinctly different concentration of each of the extinct radioactive nuclides, whereas the early solar system radioactivities measure only those abundances present in the dense molecular- cloud phase‚ÄúExtinct radioactivities: A three-phase mixing model‚Äù, D.

Aspects of interstellar-phase mixing are sure to remain important for decades to come while astronomers probe the circumstances of solar birth using accurate meteoritic data revealing the abundances of the extinct radioactive nuclei. Clayton therefore gave emphasis to extinct radioactivity in the Glossary of his 2003 book on isotopes in the cosmos.Donald Clayton, Handbook of isotopes in the cosmos, Cambridge University Press 2003), p.285‚Äì289 Chapters 16 and 17 of Catch a Falling Star. Condensation of carbon solids from oxygen-rich supernova gas In 1998 Clayton voiced a new idea for supernova chemistry by arguing that radioactive decay causes carbon to condense within oxygen-rich supernova gas. He reached that conclusion after Weihong Liu and Alexander DalgarnoW. Liu & A. Dalgarno, Astrophys. J. 454, 472‚Äì79 (1995) showed that radioactive decays of 56Co create fast Compton-scattered electrons that would dissociate the CO molecule [e+CO > e'+C+O], thereby preventing the complete oxidation of carbon atoms within young remnants of core-collapse supernovae. Clayton initiated an energetic crusade in 1998D. D. Clayton, \\"Condensing carbon SUNOCONs when O>C\\", Lunar and Planetary Science Conference 29 (1998); D Clayton, W Liu & A Dalgarno ‚ÄúCondensation of Carbon in Radioactive Supernova Gas‚Äù, Science 283, 1290‚Äì1292 (1999); W Liu & D Clayton, \\"Condensation of carbon in supernovae: 1. Basic Chemistry\\" Lunar and Planetary Science Conference 30 (1999), and D. Clayton & W. Liu \\"Condensation of Carbon in Supernovae 2. Graphite in meteorites\\", Lunar and Planetary Science Conference 30 (1999) demonstrating that the vast reservoir of carbon in core-collapse supernovae must condense as carbon dust despite being bathed in more-abundant oxygen gas. This idea met skepticism from meteoriiticists and cosmochemists because it contradicted a commonly accepted rule of thumb that held that the abundance of carbon must exceed that of oxygen (written C>O) in order for carbon to condense. Clayton advocated that supernova carbon stardust (which in 1977 he had namedDonald D. Clayton, \\"Precondensed matter: Key to the early solar system\\", Moon & Planets 19, 109(1978) SUNOCONs, an acronym for SUperNOva CONdensates) could therefore assemble within hot supernova C+O gases containing more oxygen than carbon and nothing else. Rather than a specialist's chemical detail, this is a profound conclusion for astrophysics because it partly explains the large amounts of dust created by supernovae in the early universe. Meteoritic chemists to whom his 1998-99 Lunar and Planetary Science Conference papers were addressed doubted that possibility on intuitive but erroneous chemical grounds, believing that abundant hot oxygen gas would oxidize all carbon atoms leaving them trapped within chemically inert CO molecules‚Äîan expectation that holds true in ordinary stars. Clayton asserted that this incorrect chemical rule-of- thumb was erroneously biasing interpretive studies of carbon SUNOCONs (primarily SiC grains and graphite grains). With Lih-Sin The at Clemson he computed the large density of energetic electrons produced by scattering of gamma rays D.D. Clayton and L.S. The, Astrophys J., \\"Bremmstrahlung and Energetic Electrons in Supernovae\\", Ap.J. 375, 221-38 (1991) emitted by radioactive cobalt. Those continuously replenish the abundance of free carbon atoms in the supernova gas by breaking apart the abundant CO molecules. In the most recent of his papers, Clayton & Meyer (2017) D.D.Clayton & B. S. Meyer, \\"Graphite Grain-Size Spectrum and Molecules from Core-Collapse Supernovae\\", Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta (2017) doi:10.1016/j.gca.2017.06.027 computed every reaction step from hot gas to cold grains during the cooling expansion of the supernova gas. Those quite abundant free carbon atoms enable carbon- chain molecules to maintain their small abundances against constant oxidation and later capture carbon atoms until they become macroscopic grains of carbon.[DD Clayton, W Liu & A Dalgarno, ‚ÄúCondensation of Carbon in Radioactive Supernova Gas‚Äù, Science 283, 1290‚Äì1292 (1999); DD Clayton, E Deneault & BS Meyer Astrophysical Journal 562, 480‚Äì493 (2001); E Deneault, DD Clayton & A Heger, ‚ÄúSupernova Reverse Shocks: SiC growth and isotopic composition‚Äù, Astrophys.

The kinetic-chemical-reaction model underlying all of these works was initially devised with Weihong Liu and Alexander DalgarnoDD Clayton, W Liu & A Dalgarno, Science 283, 1290‚Äì92 (1999) and later expanded by Clayton and his colleagues at Clemson.DD Clayton, E Deneault & BS Meyer, Astrophys. J. 562, 480 (2001); E Deneault, DD Clayton & A Heger, Astrophys. J. 594, 312‚Äì325 (2003); E Deneault, DD Clayton & BS Meyer, Astrophys. J. 638, 234‚Äì240 (2006); T. Yu, BS Meyer & DD Clayton, Astrophys. J. 769, 2013‚Äì19 (2013) Their works showed that very large dust grains (micrometers in radius) in comparison with average interstellar-medium dust sizes grow within the expanding oxygen-rich supernova interiors owing to the principle of Population Control.[D. D. Clayton, New Astronomy Reviews 55, 155‚Äì65 (2011), section 5.5, p. 163] According to that principle rapid oxidation actually intensifies growth of large grains of carbon by keeping the population of carbon solids small so that those few can grow large by accreting the continuously replenished free carbon. This topic establishes another new aspect of carbon's uniquely versatile chemistry. Their 2017 paper also computes the abundances of molecules and of Buckminsterfullerene grains ejected along with the graphite grains.

She identified as a U.S-based woman of color and theorized this category as a political identity forged through feminist coalitional work. Lugones advanced Latinx Philosophy in theorizing various forms of resistance against multiple oppressions in Latin America, the US and elsewhere. She was known for her theory of multiple selves, her work on decolonial feminism, and for developing the concept of the \\"coloniality of gender,\\" which posits that gender is a colonial imposition.  Research  Lugones is the author of Pilgrimage/Peregrinajes: Theorizing Coalition Against Multiple Oppressions (2003) a seminal, highly-praised collection of essays, many of which were originally published in Hypatia, Signs and other journals. Among the essays included are ‚ÄúPlayfulness, ‚ÄòWorld‚Äô‚ÄêTravelling, and Loving Perception,‚Äù which addresses the experience of navigating hyphenated identities from a phenomenological perspective. Lugones posits ‚Äúa plurality of selves‚Äù that literally shift from being one person to being a different person, with each shift producing a corresponding new world. In another essay, ‚ÄúPurity, Impurity, and Separation,‚Äù Lugones introduces the concept of curdling as an intersectional practice of resistance that works against an oppressive logic of purity. Examples of curdling include: code-switching, drag, gender transgression and multilingual experimentation. In her later work, ‚ÄúHeterosexualism and the Colonial/Modern Gender System‚Äù (2007) and ‚ÄúToward a Decolonial Feminism‚Äù (2010), Lugones turns her attention to coloniality: its impact on gender formation, as well as various strategies of resistance which could contribute toward its eventual dismantling. Combining Anibal Quijano‚Äôs theory of the coloniality of power with a feminist, intersectionalist framework, Lugones concludes that gender is a colonial imposition. Drawing on historical examples of pre-colonial, gynecratic Native American tribes, Lugones situates gender as a colonial classification system that divides and subjugates people differently depending on multiple intersectional factors including class and ethnicity.

He entered the railroad industry in the 1830s and ran steamboats on the St. Lawrence River. He was also a director of the Bank of Montreal and closely involved with many aspects to do with the progression of Montreal from the 1820s to the 1850s. His home, St. Antoine Hall, was one of the early estates of the Golden Square Mile. Early years In 1786, John Torrance was born at Larkhall, Lanarkshire, Scotland. John was the second of the five very able sons born to Thomas Torrance (1735‚Äì1805), of Larkhall. Career In 1805, John accompanied his four brothers to New York City, in 1897, he moved again to Montreal to join his brother, Thomas, who had established himself as a merchant there. John next went to Quebec City to represent Thomas' firm, meeting his wife there. By 1814, he was back in Montreal and had opened a general store near to Thomas' on Saint-Paul Street. By 1826, his nephew David Torrance, had become a clerk in John‚Äôs business, marrying John's daughter in 1832. Their business partnership lasted until John retired in 1853. This closeness between uncle and nephew was a likely reason for John's son opening his own rival firm. The firm of John Torrance & Co., became strongly associated with tea. In the late 1820s, they began to import tea directly from China and India, breaking the East India Company monopoly previously controlled by Forsyth, Richardson & Co. They diversified into loans from their warehouses to Upper Canadian merchants and developed the Montreal & Quebec Steamboat Company, which at first competed with and then joined forces with John Molson. The Torrances were a major driving force with the Molsons in the creation of the St Lawrence Steamboat Services.Steamboat Connections: Montreal to Upper Canada, 1816-1843 By Frank Mackey From as early as 1832 the Torrances jointly incorporated the Champlain and St Lawrence Railroad. By 1847, they had invested ¬£1,000 to link Montreal by rail to the other major eastern port, Portland, Maine. John was a director of this railroad from 1847 until it became part of the Grand Trunk Railway in 1853. A complex web of railroads were being built to connect Montreal to New York City, and in 1846, Torrance was in the group that incorporated the Montreal and Lachine Railroad Company, of which he was later a director and inventor. This railroad later joined the Montreal and New York Railroad Company in 1850, and he was made a director. He was also a director of the St Lawrence and Ottawa Grand Junction Railroad Company, chartered in 1850, to extend the Montreal and Lachine line to Prescott, Canada West. John Torrance was a stockholder in the short-lived Bank of Canada in Montreal and became a director of the Bank of Montreal from 1826 to 1857, after the death of his brother, Thomas. In the 1840s, he was a director of the Montreal Provident and Savings Bank and at one time had ¬£2,000 invested in the City Bank of New York. In the 1850s, he was elected a director of the Montreal Fire, Life & Inland Navigation Assurance Company and of the Equitable Fire Insurance Company of London, England. He had been a founder of the Committee of Trade in 1822 and invested in a variety of land speculations and mortgages. Civil life in Montreal Torrance strongly supported the Montreal Annexation Manifesto, which cost him his commission as a Major in the militia. Through his wife's influence, he became a Methodist in later life and strongly supported his church as well as a variety of literary and educational associations. He was a life governor of the Montreal General Hospital and a founder and trustee of the Mount Royal Cemetery. He made gifts to McGill University including a fund for a gold medal in law as a memorial to his wife.ANNUAL CALENDAR OF McGILL COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY MONTREAL, 1869 St. Antoine Hall Rear view of Torrance's home, St. Antoine Hall, built in 1818 In 1818, Torrance built a 42-room mansion, St. Antoine Hall, off the then fashionable Saint Antoine Street. The house was renowned for its acres of gardens, conservatories, vineries, and orchards, enjoyed by Torrance whose hobby was gardening - he was also an incorporator of the Horticultural Society of Montreal in 1849. St. Antoine Hall was also famous for its high brick walls and the great gate which according to family tradition closed firmly at 10 p.m. Torrance's granddaughter, Evelyn (Galt) Springett (a god-daughter of Sir George-√âtienne Cartier) remembered it as \\"a lovely place... great shady trees, and in summer the horse chestnuts were alive with humming birds\\".My Children's Children (Montreal, 1932), by Evelyn Cartier Springett Torrance had also purchased a small estate in his native Scotland, known as the 'Gatehouse'. Personal life Mrs Elizabeth (Fisher) Torrance In 1811, at Montreal, Torrance had married Elizabeth Fisher (1794‚Äì1862), the daughter of Catherine (n√©e Embury) Fisher and Duncan Fisher, an American merchant who settled in Montreal after the Revolution. Elizabeth's maternal grandfather, Philip Embury, was the founder of Methodism in the United States. In their marriage contract, Torrance made a provision of ¬£1,000 to her should she outlive him, an indication of his early success as he was only 25 at the time. Together, the Torrances were the parents of fifteen children, including: * Jane Torrance (1812‚Äì1875), who married her first cousin and the business partner of her father, David Torrance, president of the Bank of Montreal. * Daniel Torrance (1815‚Äì1885), who married Sophia Johnson Vanderbilt (1825‚Äì1912), daughter of Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt. * Elliot Torrance (1828‚Äì1850), who married Sir Alexander Tilloch Galt, the first Canadian Minister of Finance. * Mary Eakin Torrance (1831‚Äì1907). * Amy Gordon Torrance (1834‚Äì1911), who married her elder sister Elliot's widower after her death in 1850.The Torrance Family * Alexander Hutchison Torrance (1837‚Äì1880). Torrance died on January 20, 1870 in Montreal. Upon his death, the Montreal Gazette called him, \\"one of our wealthiest citizens.\\" His fortune was divided among his many children and his businesses were continued by his nephew, David.

At that time, the Knights became the first football program to play in four different NCAA divisions (III, II, I-AA and I-A). Sophomore Quarterback Daunte Culpepper led the team to rank 16th in the nation in passing offense. This despite suffering first a sprained ankle and later a separated shoulder (non- throwing arm). The Golden Knights won their first game as a member of Division I-A, defeating William & Mary. UCF dropped six of their next seven games, however, and finished with a record of 5‚Äì6.

August 29 ‚Äì William & Mary  UCF made their debut as an NCAA Division I-A team at the Citrus Bowl on Thursday night against I-AA William & Mary. The Golden Knights took a 10‚Äì0 lead into halftime, but errors and miscues almost cost them the game. The Tribe scored 27 points in the third quarter to take a 27‚Äì10 lead. UCF had seven fumbles (four lost), and the defense gave up big plays, including a 70-yard touchdown pass by Mike Cook. Quarterback Daunte Culpepper led UCF on a rally, throwing for 307 yards and three touchdowns, and rushing for 87 yards. The Golden Knights scored 22 points in the fourth to take a 39‚Äì33 lead with 1:47 remaining. In the final minute, despite back-to-back turnovers, the Golden Knights held on to win their first game as a Div. I-A school.  September 7 ‚Äì at South Carolina  The Golden Knights scored a touchdown on the opening drive, but the Gamecocks scored 23 unanswered points before the first quarter had ended. Quarterback Daunte Culpepper suffered a sprained ankle, and left the game in the second half. South Carolina overpowered the Golden Knights, as tailback Duce Staley rushed for 188 yards and three touchdowns. The gamecocks won by the score of 33‚Äì14.  September 14 ‚Äì at New Mexico  UCF strong safety Donnell Washington scored an 80-yard interception return for a touchdown, and the Golden Knights defense played strong, giving UCF a 7‚Äì3 lead after three quarters. However, the offense struggled all night, and quarterback Daunte Culpepper re-injured his ankle. The Lobos rallied for two touchdowns in the fourth quarter, and won 17‚Äì7.  September 21 ‚Äì at Ball State  On a cold, rainy afternoon, Ball State beat UCF 31‚Äì10 to give the Golden Knights their third loss in a row. Quarterback Daunte Culpepper, still suffering lingering pain from his injured ankle, brought UCF with six points in the third quarter. But in the fourth quarter, trailing 16‚Äì10, the UCF special teams broke down. The Golden Knights gave up an 80-yard punt return touchdown, followed by a blocked punt that lead to another Cardinals touchdown.  September 28 ‚Äì at East Carolina  UCF lost their fourth game in a row, falling to East Carolina. The Golden Knights were shut out 14‚Äì0 in the first half, but quarterback Daunte Culpepper was able to put UCF on the board with a 54-yard touchdown pass to Mike Huff early in the third quarter. The offense continued to sputter, however, as Culpepper was sacked twice, lost a fumble, and threw three interceptions on the day. After his third interception, which led to a Pirates score, Culpepper was benched in favor of Jason Thorpe. The Golden Knights fell 28‚Äì7, and went 0‚Äì4 on their September road trip.  October 12 ‚Äì Samford  After a much-needed bye week, UCF returned home to take on I-AA Samford. The Golden Knights rolled over the Bulldogs to snap their four-game losing streak. Todd Cleveland took the opening kickoff back 93 yards for a touchdown, and UCF led 7‚Äì0 just 15 seconds into the game. The Knights would never trail, as quarterback Daunte Culpepper threw two touchdown passes in the win. Mike Huff ran for a touchdown and caught a touchdown pass, while Mike Grant had a 40-yard touchdown run in the second half. Up by 29 points, Culpepper was rested in the fourth quarter, and replaced by backups Jason Thorpe and Kevin Reid. Both Thorpe and Reid had one pass attempt apiece, and both were intercepted. The Bulldogs were held scoreless in the second half, and UCF won 38‚Äì6.  October 19 ‚Äì Northeast Louisiana  UCF hosted Northeast Louisiana at the Citrus Bowl, its first Division I-A opponent at home since ascending to the I-A level themselves. The Golden Knights blew an 11-point lead inside the final three minutes as the Indians took the win by a score of 39‚Äì38. In a high scoring game, quarterback Daunte Culpepper threw two touchdown passes and ran for another. With 3:01 left to play, the Golden Knights led 38‚Äì27. In just 43 seconds, quarterback Raymond Philyaw drove the Indians 65-yards for a touchdown, and trimmed the score to 38‚Äì33. The Indians recovered an onside kick, and 48 seconds later, were in the endzone again for the go-ahead score. Facing 4th & 10 at the 37, Philyaw threw a perfect pass to Marty Booker at the goal line. Trailing by one point, UCF had one last chance to drive for a potential game-winning field goal. Driving near midfield, Culpepper broke away for a 20-yard scramble, but had the ball slapped from his hand at the 47 yard line. The Indians recovered the fumble, and sealed the victory.  October 26 ‚Äì at Georgia Tech  UCF gave George O'Leary and the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets a scare, but five turnovers thwarted any chance of victory. Trailing 20-6 early in the fourth quarter, quarterback Daunte Culpepper was on the sidelines with an injured shoulder. Strong safety Donnell Washington grabbed a mid-air fumble and returned it 46 yards for a touchdown to trim the deficit to 20‚Äì13. The Knights were able to pin Georgia Tech back at their own 4 yard line with 8:02 to go. But Georgia tech responded with a 96-yard touchdown pass from Shaw to Charlie Roberts, and a 27‚Äì13 lead. UCF scored a touchdown with 40 seconds left in regulation to make the score 27‚Äì20. An onside kick attempt in the final minute failed, and the Golden Knights lost 27‚Äì20.  November 2 ‚Äì Illinois State  Two UCF players, receiver Todd Cleveland and running back Mike Grant, were suspended before the game for the season, but the Golden Knights still routed Illinois State 42‚Äì15 on homecoming. UCF racked up 597 yards of offense, led by quarterback Daunte Culpepper, who threw for 260 yards and two touchdown passes. Culpepper only played in the first half, as the team elected to rest him in the second half due to his lingering shoulder injury.  November 9 ‚Äì at UAB  Quarterback Daunte Culpepper has his best game of the season, completing 24 of 36 passes. He threw for 421 yards and three touchdown passes, and ran for another touchdown, as the Golden Knights won by the score of 35‚Äì13. The win was notable, as it marked UCF's first victory against a Division I-A opponent since ascending to Division I-A themselves. After falling behind 10‚Äì0 in the second quarter, the Golden Knights outscored UAB 35‚Äì3 to take complete control of the game. Culpepper's 421 passing yards was the second-most in school history.  November 16 ‚Äì Bowling Green  UCF finished the season on a three-game winning streak, defeating Bowling Green 27‚Äì19 at the Citrus Bowl. UCF led 14‚Äì13 early in the third quarter, but a miscue kept the Green Falcons in the game. Windy conditions helped Bowling Green, as a punt carried for 73 yards, pinning the Golden Knights at their own 1 yard line. Quarterback Daunte Culpepper was intercepted, setting up a Cates 1-yard touchdown run, and a 19‚Äì14 lead for the Falcons. Culpepper responded with a 54-yard pass to Mark Nonsant, which set up a touchdown run by Mike Huff, and a 20‚Äì19 lead. UCF added another touchdown in the fourth quarter, after stopping the Falcons on a 4th down & 6 at the 36 yard line.

It would be the thirteenth and final season for head coach Gene McDowell. McDowell's 1997 team finished with a 5‚Äì6 overall record, matching the record from the previous season. McDowell would resign at season's end in the wake of a cell phone fraud scandal. His tenure as head coach came to a close after compiling an 86‚Äì61 record. To-date, McDowell still has the most wins as head coach in program history. UCF started to gain notoriety in 1997, building their program, and playing a higher-profile schedule, including several SEC teams. The Golden Knights lost in overtime to Ole Miss, then narrowly lost to South Carolina. In week three, UCF gained national attention by leading #6 Nebraska 17‚Äì14 at halftime. UCF, however, could not hold off the powerful Cornhuskers in the second half, and fell by a final score of 38‚Äì24. Lauded by media as the \\"best 0‚Äì3 team in the nation,\\" the Golden Knights won five of their last eight games, including a perfect 4‚Äì0 record at home. The team set a then-record average home attendance of 29,585 at the Citrus Bowl, including a then single- game record crowd of 41,827 on September 20. With a 5‚Äì6 final record, they were not bowl eligible, but they did attract some attention from scouts for the Carquest Bowl, who saw them as a potential at-large team. At the conclusion of the season, quarterback Daunte Culpepper set fifteen school records, and was named a finalist for the Davey O'Brien Award. He was also named a semi-finalist for the Football News Offensive Player of the Year. The 1997 season was a break-out year for the junior quarterback, and towards the end of the season, speculation began to swirl if Culpepper would forgo his senior year and enter the 1998 NFL draft. Ultimately, Culpepper elected to return to UCF for one final season. Hearing impaired tailback Dwight Collins received the Disney's Wide World of Sports Spirit Award, and running backs coach Alan Gooch who worked with him, was named the AFCA Assistant Coach of the Year. After only two seasons in Division I-A, UCF was already beginning to earn a reputation as a \\"scary\\" team on the road. Their near-misses against high-profile teams was in contrast to their predicted status as a mid-major, non-conference school. It started prompting some reluctance among larger schools of scheduling the Knights in future seasons. Cell phone fraud scandal The Citrus Bowl, the Knights home field. On October 28, 1997, Secret Service agents raided the UCF football team's locker room, as part of a federal cell phone fraud investigation. Former UCF player Patrick Brinson, a former AT&T; employee, was arrested for rigging as many as 17 cell phones with non-billing numbers, and subsequently selling them to fellow players. It was later revealed that head coach Gene McDowell had been tipped off on the pending raid by David Smith of the Seminole County Sheriff's Office. McDowell was accused of lying to federal agents and warning the players of the upcoming raid, as well as encouraging players to lie and further engaging in a cover- up. McDowell resigned as head coach on January 20, 1998. McDowell would eventually be sentenced to house arrest, community service, and two years probation. Two players involved received probation, and three others were sentenced to community service. Brinson, and an accomplice were separately sentenced to probation, restitution, and community service. Smith received probation and a fine. Schedule Quarterback Daunte Culpepper set 15 school record in 1997. Game summaries= August 30 ‚Äì at Ole Miss  In only their second season in Division I-A, the Golden Knights nearly pulled off a huge upset at Ole Miss. Quarterback Daunte Culpepper threw two touchdowns passes in regulation, and the game went into overtime tied 17‚Äì17. Ole Miss got the ball first in the overtime period. Stewart Patridge threw a 19-yard touchdown pass to Rufus French to take a 24‚Äì17 lead. UCF took over, and Culpepper completed a 21-yard touchdown pass to Charles Lee. The Golden Knights took a timeout, and contemplated whether to kick the extra point or go for the win. The team elected to try a two-point conversion. Culpepper attempted a quarterback draw, but was stopped just inches short of the goal line. Reaching forward to break the plane of the goal line, the ball came loose and the attempt ultimately failed. UCF lost by the score of 24‚Äì23, the first of several near-misses against high-profile schools. *Source: The Orlando Sentinel  September 6 ‚Äì at South Carolina  For the second time in two weeks, the Golden Knights nearly pulled off an upset of an SEC team. South Carolina took a 14‚Äì10 lead into halftime, but UCF exploded into the lead early in the third quarter. Quarterback Daunte Culpepper threw touchdown passes of 71 and 41 yards to Siaha Burley to take a 24‚Äì14 lead. The Gamecocks rallied, however, and took a 33‚Äì24 lead midway through the fourth quarter. Penalties (17 for 122 yards) and seven sacks haunted the Knights. Darryl Latimore blocked a South Carolina punt - his second punt block of the game - to give UCF good field position, which led to a Mike Huff touchdown with 2:39 remaining. With the score 33‚Äì31, UCF attempted an onside kick, but failed, and South Carolina held on to win. *Source: The Orlando Sentinel  September 13 ‚Äì at Nebraska  UCF traveled to Nebraska for what would become one of the most memorable games in the program's history. The Golden Knights entered the game as 43 point underdogs, and were not expected to compete with the powerful Cornhuskers. Led by Hall of Fame head coach Tom Osborne, Nebraska had won two national championships (1994 & 1995) and were contenders once again (they would be voted co-national champions for 1997). Led by starting quarterback Scott Frost (the future UCF head coach), the Cornhuskers were ranked #6 in both polls. Both teams punted on their first two possessions, with the Golden Knights defense seemingly holding the Cornhuskers at bay. Late in the first quarter, quarterback Daunte Culpepper completed a 44-yard pass to Mark Nonsant to the Nebraska 25 yard line. Four plays later, Culpepper scored on a 10-yard touchdown run for a surprising 7‚Äì0 Knights lead. Nebraska tied the score at 7‚Äì7 early in the second quarter. But Fred Waczewski kicked a career-best 51-yard field goal to give UCF the lead again at 10‚Äì7. At one point in the second quarter, Frost was benched in favor of backup quarterback Frankie London. London completed only one pass, but still drove Nebraska for a touchdown and a 14‚Äì10 lead. UCF went three-and-out on their next drive, and was forced to punt. The Nebraska punt returner was tackled and fumbled, and it was recovered by UCF at the Nebraska 45 yard line. Culpepper connected with Mark Nonsant for a 42-yard gain to the 2 yard line. Mike Grant punched it in on the next play for a touchdown and a shocking 17‚Äì14 lead. Frost returned to the game, and drove the Cornhuskers into UCF territory. But Kris Brown missed a 27-yard field goal attempt to close out the half. After a stunning first half by the Golden Knights, Nebraska finally gained control of the game in the third quarter. The Cornhuskers scored 17 unanswered points to take a 31-17 lead into the fourth quarter. A Culpepper interception in the endzone also hurt UCF's chances for a rally. Later, Paul Miranda partially blocked a Nebraska punt, which set up the Golden Knights at the Nebraska 43 yard line. Culpepper drove the Knights for a touchdown, and trimmed the deficit to 31‚Äì24. Scott Frost's 5-yard touchdown run with 3:03 remaining sealed the game for the Cornhuskers, and they held on to win 38‚Äì24. After the game, the Memorial Stadium crowd gave the UCF players a standing ovation for their efforts. UCF gained national attention for their performance, and received a single vote in the AP Poll, the first time the school had ever received a vote in either major poll. The team was lauded as the \\"best 0‚Äì3 team in the nation\\" and the game went down in UCF history as a defining moment for the program. Meanwhile, Nebraska slipped one spot in both polls, but would recover to finish undefeated and claim a share of the national championship. *Source: The Orlando Sentinel  September 20 ‚Äì Idaho  A then school record crowd of 41,827 arrived at the Citrus Bowl to watch UCF host Idaho in their home opener. The Golden Knights defense recovered four fumbles and made two interceptions, as UCF won handily by the score of 41‚Äì10. Quarterback Daunte Culpepper, however, had a mixed day, throwing for 228 yards and one touchdown, and rushing for a touchdown, but also threw three interceptions. The two teams started off the game committing back-to-back turnovers, and Idaho then drove to the UCF 6 yard line. Vandals quarterback Brian Brennan fumbled on the 1 yard line and it was recovered by UCF, setting the tone for the game. Tailback Mike Grant was the offensive star of the game, rushing for three touchdowns, and had one receiving touchdown. Grant tied a school record with four touchdowns in a single game. *Source: The Orlando Sentinel September 27 ‚Äì at Auburn No. 8 Auburn defeated UCF by the score of 41‚Äì14 in the first meeting between the two teams. The Tigers went up 7‚Äì0 in the first quarter. Then Darryl Latimore intercepted Tigers quarterback Dameyune Craig, which led to a UCF touchdown and a 7‚Äì7 tie. The Golden Knights defense, however, could not contain Craig most of the day, who threw for 360 yards, and ran for 57 yards. Quarterback Daunte Culpepper managed a 47-yard connection to Todd Cleveland, followed by a 1-yard touchdown pass to Joey Hubbard to make the score 14‚Äì14. But Culpepper was unable to keep up with the high-powered Tigers offense. UCF totaled only 45 net yards of rushing. While the Golden Knights were able to keep the game close in the first half, the Tigers pulled away in the second half. The Knights fell to 1‚Äì4 on the season. *Source: The Orlando Sentinel October 4 ‚Äì at Kent State A total of 43 points were scored in the fourth quarter, as UCF outlasted Kent State 59‚Äì43 to win their first road game of the season. The Golden Knights and the Golden Flashes combined for 1,227 yards of offense, with Kent State quarterback Jose Davis throwing for a then MAC record of 551 yards and six touchdown passes. UCF quarterback Daunte Culpepper threw for 322 yards, and a then career-high four touchdown passes. He also ran for a 75-yard touchdown. Hearing impaired freshman tailback Dwight Collins had his best game of the season, rushing for 130 yards and two touchdowns, the first 100-yard rusher for UCF since 1995. Culpepper threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to Kendrick Moore in the first quarter, then Mike Grant scored on a 2-yard run in the second quarter, However, the Golden Knights found themselves trailing 21‚Äì14 with under two minutes left in the first half. Grant broke away for a 30-yard gain, which led to a 15-yard touchdown pass from Culpepper to Siaha Burley with 1:50 remaining. Then the Golden Knights got the ball back once more, and Fred Waczewski kicked a 37-yard field goal to make the score 24‚Äì21 as time expired in the half. UCF began to pull away, with two touchdown passes in the third quarter. Culpepper connected to Joey Hubbard and Burley to stretch their lead to 38‚Äì21. But the fourth quarter was explosive for both teams. Kent State drove 75 yards in three plays, capped off by a 69-yard touchdown pass from Jose Davis to Jason Gavadza. Culpepper answered, however, with a 75-yard scramble for a touchdown and a 45‚Äì29. UCF pinned Kent State back at their own 2 yard line with just over 6 minutes remaining in regulation. Kent State scored on a shocking 98-yard touchdown reception by Eugene Baker, and cut the lead to 45‚Äì35. Not to be denied, Dwight Collins iced the game for the Golden Knights with two touchdown runs (40 yards and 14 yards, respectively) in the final minutes. *Source: The Orlando Sentinel October 11 ‚Äì Samford UCF quarterback Daunte Culpepper started the game 15-for-15 passing, throwing for 252 yards and two touchdowns in the first half alone, as the Golden Knights routed Samford. Culpepper finished with 309 yards and three touchdown passes, and was rested in the fourth quarter of a 52‚Äì7 victory. Mike Grant ran for three touchdowns, as UCF racked up 181 yards rushing. The Golden Knights quickly jumped out to a 17‚Äì0 lead in the first quarter, and were never challenged for the lead. Samford's only score came late in the second quarter. Despite a somewhat lethargic second quarter, which resulted in three punts, and where Culpepper lost a fumble when he collided with an official, the UCF offense rebounded in the second half. After Culpepper was benched, backup quarterback Jason Thorpe added a 31-yard touchdown pass to Eric Leister partway through the fourth quarter. *Source: The Orlando Sentinel October 25 ‚Äì at Mississippi State After a bye week, UCF traveled to Starkville to face Mississippi State. In yet another near-miss against an SEC team, the Golden Knights, led with under 7 minutes to go, before giving up two late touchdowns. UCF quarterback Daunte Culpepper threw for 359 yards, two touchdown passes, and rushed for 61 yards. Three interceptions, however, foiled the team's chances. The Golden Knights out- gained the Bulldogs in yardage 486 to 318, first downs (29 to 13), and had a time of possession advantage of more than 8 minutes. J. J. Johnson's four touchdown runs, though, was the deciding factor. Robert Isaac returned the opening kickoff 84 yards, setting up the Bulldogs first touchdown a minute into the game. UCF soon tied the score at 7‚Äì7 with a 2-yard touchdown run by Mike Grant. Culpepper's first interception of the game came in the second quarter, snapping a school-record streak of 117 pass attempts without an interception. The game went into halftime with the score was tied 14‚Äì14. In the third quarter, the Bulldogs again capitalized on sluggish kick return coverage. Another long return by Isaac set up a 42-yard touchdown pass by Matt Wyatt to Lamonte Woodberry. Two field goals by UCF kicker Fred Waczewski made the score 21-20 in favor of Mississippi State. Trailing by 1 point, Culpepper drove the Golden Knights 80 yards in 9 plays, capping off the drive with a 17-yard touchdown pass to Charles Lee. Culpepper's two-point conversion pass to Siaha Burley put the Golden Knights up by 7 points. With under nine minutes left in regulation, the cowbell-wielding homecoming crowd was stunned and quieted as UCF now led 28‚Äì21. Anxious at another chance for a program-defining victory, fatigue began to set in for UCF on both offense and defense. Wyatt connected to Reggie Kelly for 36 yards, then a 1-yard touchdown run by Johnson tied the game. On the next drive, a blitzing defense forced UCF into a 3-and- out. Two plays later, Johnson scored the go-ahead touchdown for Mississippi State with 5:13 left. Driving to tie the game, a Culpepper pass was tipped and intercepted. UCF had one last drive, however, Culpepper was intercepted with 43 seconds to go, sealing the game for the Bulldogs. *Source: The Orlando Sentinel *Source: The Clarion-Ledger November 1 ‚Äì at Northeast Louisiana Just days after a cell phone fraud scandal broke at the team headquarters, UCF traveled to Monroe for their final road game of the season. Quarterback Daunte Culpepper scored six touchdowns (five passing, one rushing), and had 480 yards of offense, but the Golden Knights could not outlast the Indians. They fell by the score of 45‚Äì41, erasing hopes for a winning season. Culpepper threw two touchdown passes to jump out to a 14‚Äì0 lead in the first quarter. The Indians, bounced back in the second quarter, scoring three touchdowns, while blocking a UCF extra point, to take a 21‚Äì20 lead into halftime. Culpepper's career-long 44-yard touchdown run in the third quarter, followed by a two point conversion pass from tailback Mike Grant to Rufus Hall, made the score 28‚Äì28. The touchdown run followed a Knights interception, and a 17-yard pass completion to Hall. The back-and-forth game continued into the fourth quarter, with touchdowns by both teams and a 35‚Äì35 tie with 9:45 remaining. The Indians executed a fake punt, which kept their drive alive, capping off by a 1-yard touchdown run by Alan Ricard. Later, Travis Singleton intercepted Culpepper, leading to an Indians field goal, and the Golden Knights trailed 38‚Äì35 with under five minutes to go. Culpepper took over on the next drive, and in five plays re-took the lead. He connected to wide receiver Charles Lee, who broke free for a 61-yard go-ahead touchdown with 2:45 left in regulation. The UCF defense, however, could not seal the game. The Indians drove 82 yards in the final two and a half minutes, scoring the game-winning touchdown with 33 seconds to go. *Source: The Orlando Sentinel November 15 ‚Äì Eastern Michigan After a week off, a homecoming crowd of 39,433 arrived to cheer the Golden Knights, as they defeated the potent offense of the Eastern Michigan Eagles led by quarterback Charlie Batch. UCF quarterback Daunte Culpepper threw for 243 yards, and rushed for 79 yards. Tailback Mike Grant rushed for 83 yards with two touchdowns, while Siaha Burley caught eight passes for 135 yards. On two occasions Eric Leister, a utility player, executed tricks plays for the Golden Knights. In the first quarter, Leister took a reverse from Culpepper, then connected downfield to Burley for a 40-yard gain. In the third quarter, a fake field goal attempt saw Leister as the holder, tossing a 4-yard pass to fullback Joe Field, which gave UCF a first down. The play led to a touchdown few plays later. Despite issues on defense in previous weeks, the Golden Knights defense stepped up much of the game. Miscues by the Eagles were noted, as in the second quarter, trailing by 7 points inside the UCF 1 yard line, time was running out in the half. Batch failed to get a play off before halftime, and just inches short of the goal line, Eastern Michigan's drive came up empty. With UCF leading 21‚Äì10 with six minutes remaining, Eastern Michigan faced a 4th & 3 at the UCF 44 yard line. Mike Osuna sacked Charlie Batch for a turnover on downs, and UCF was able to secure the win. *Source: The Orlando Sentinel November 22 ‚Äì Toledo UCF's final game of the season came against Toledo. The Rockets were 9‚Äì1 coming into the game, and had clinched the MAC west division crown. The game would be an opportunity for the Golden Knights to beat a team that had been ranked as high as 18th in the Top 25, as well as finish undefeated at home on senior day. The Golden Knights even came into the game as 6-point favorites. The game was played as a doubleheader at the Citrus Bowl along with the Florida Classic. Much of the pregame hype focused on quarterback Daunte Culpepper and whether or not this would be his final game at UCF. Rumors had been swirling over the past few weeks that Culpepper might forgo his senior season and enter the 1998 NFL Draft. Culpepper was largely silent on the issue, and stated he would announce his intentions after the game. Quarterback Daunte Culpepper threw for 209 yards and one touchdown pass, and ran for one touchdown, but it was an explosive play on special teams that set the tone for the game. The teams traded field goals in the first quarter for a 3‚Äì3 tie. With about five minutes left in the first quarter, Toledo kicked off and UCF returner Todd Cleveland caught the ball at the 7 yard line. The Knights executed a reverse, and Cleveland handed off to Paul Miranda at the 12, who then broke free for an 88-yard touchdown. Fred Waczewski added another field goal, and the Golden Knights led 13‚Äì3. In the final minute of the second quarter, Culpepper capped off a 9-play, 81-yard drive with a 1 yard run. UCF led 20‚Äì3 at halftime. The Rockets cut into the lead in the second half. With the score 27‚Äì10 in favor of UCF, Toledo drove 73 yards for a touchdown, a 6-yard pass from Chris Wallace to Mel Long. With 13:43 left in regulation, UCF's lead was down to 27‚Äì17. With the UCF offense stalling, Toledo got the ball back and drove into Knights territory with under 7 minutes to go. The Rockets got to the red zone, but the defense stiffened and they had to settle for a 34-yard field goal attempt. The kick sailed wide right, and UCF held their lead. The Knights offense put the game out of reach with a clock-burning 11-play, 80-yard drive culminating in a 4-yard touchdown run by senior fullback Kendrick Moore. In his final game as a Knight, it was Moore's first and only rushing touchdown. On Monday after the game, Daunte Culpepper announced he would return for his senior season in 1998. *Source: The Orlando Sentinel See also * UCF Knights * UCF Knights football * List of UCF Knights football seasons * List of University of Central Florida alumni * List of UCF Knights head football coaches References UCF Golden Knights UCF Knights football seasons Knight ","title":"1997 UCF Golden Knights football team"},{"id":"36062195","text":"The 1998 UCF Golden Knights football season was the twentieth season for the team and Mike Kruczek's first as the head coach of the Golden Knights.

The Golden Knights faltered, however, and lost 35-7.UCF Blows It_ Big-time Twice the Golden Knights were deep inside the red zone, but a pick-six interception and a turnover on downs were the results. On November 7 at Auburn, the team experienced one of the most heartbreaking losses in school history. UCF entered with a record of 7-1, and hoped for a huge upset, working towards a possible at-large bowl bid. The Knights led 6-3 late in the game when inside the red zone, quarterback Daunte Culpepper fumbled away a bad shotgun snap. Auburn recovered, and quickly drove down the field. With one minute left, Auburn scored a go-ahead 58-yard touchdown pass. Karsten Bailey eluded a tackle at midfield, and managed a tightrope run down the sidelines for the game-winning score. Following the disappointment at Auburn, UCF returned home to rout Ball State and New Mexico and finished with an impressive 9-2 record. UCF received a tentative verbal agreement to play in the Oahu Bowl. However, the arrangement fell through in the final week of the season, when Miami upset undefeated UCLA. The resulting shuffle in the bowl berths left UCF out, and dashed their hopes for their first bowl appearance. Following the season, Culpepper was drafted with the 11th pick in the first round by the Minnesota Vikings, marking the highest ever draft pick of a UCF player to that point until Blake Bortles would break it in 2014 as the 3rd pick of the Jacksonville Jaguars.

With the departure of Daunte Culpepper to the NFL Draft, the quarterback duties were taken over by college journeyman Vic Penn.Sports Illustrated profile - Vic Penn On two occasions, the Golden Knights nearly upset a major SEC opponent on the road. Season summary The Golden Knights opened the season at the Citrus Bowl, hosting their largest-profile opponent thus far since elevating to Division I-A. Purdue, led by quarterback Drew Brees, soundly defeated UCF 47-13. UCF got out to an early 6-0 lead, but the Boilermakers scored 47 unanswered points, as Brees threw for 273 yards and four touchdowns. As the game got out of hand, two players were later ejected, and twice fans were arrested for running out on the field. The loss snapped UCF's school record of 11 consecutive home game wins, dating back to November 1996. After being routed by #4 Florida, and #10 Georgia Tech, the Golden Knights almost earned their first victory over an SEC team. UCF was defeated 24‚Äì23 by #11 Georgia in a game known as the \\"Burglary Between the Hedges.\\" (see below). At the 20 yard line with 15 seconds left, quarterback Vic Penn lofted a pass to Kenny Clark in the endzone, but Clark was tackled out of bounds by Bulldogs defender Jeff Harris in what appeared to be blatant pass interference. The SEC officials, however, inexcusably called offensive pass interference on UCF. The Golden Knights were backed up 15 yards, and out of field goal range, and were robbed of a chance for victory. After starting the season 0-4, the Golden Knights earned two victories against Division I-AA opponents (Eastern Illinois and Nicholls State). They finally got their first win of the season against a Division I-A team with a 31-6 win over Eastern Michigan on October 30. On November 6, UCF was poised for another possible upset. After a near-miss against Auburn a year earlier, UCF once again took the Tigers down to the wire. Trailing 10-7 with three minutes left, the Tigers blasted for three touchdowns in the span of 97 seconds, dropping UCF by a final score of 28-10. During the decade of the 1990s, UCF would compile an overall record of 67-46-0 (.593) during the decade. Schedule The Citrus Bowl, the Knights home field. Selected game summaries=September 25: at Georgia - \\"Burglary Between the Hedges\\" The UCF Golden Knights traveled to Athens to take on No. 11 ranked Georgia at Sanford Stadium. The Golden Knights were defeated 24‚Äì23 in a game that became known as the \\"Burglary Between the Hedges.\\" The young UCF program, in only its fourth season in Division I-A, was 0‚Äì7 against SEC teams, and in the closing seconds, appeared poised for a historic upset. However, a controversial offensive pass interference penalty thrown by officials in the endzone late in the game took away their chance for victory. The Bulldogs entered the game undefeated and as a 28-point favorite over the 0‚Äì3 injury-depleted Golden Knights. In the first quarter, the Bulldogs jumped out to a 14‚Äì3 lead with a 20-yard touchdown pass from Quincy Carter to Terrence Evans, followed by an 8-yard touchdown run by Jasper Sanks. Javier Beorlegui kicked a 28-yard field goal for UCF's first points, but it came moments after Kenny Clark had dropped a touchdown pass in the endzone. Looking to go up by three scores, Georgia gambled on their next drive, going for it on a 4th down & 9 at the UCF 43-yard line. Receiver Michael Greer was tackled by UCF defensive back Davin Bush just inches short of the first down, and the Bulldogs turned the ball over on downs. That crucial stop would set up the Golden Knights first touchdown. It was the first of several miscues by the Bulldogs that kept the game close. Early in the second quarter, UCF finished off an 11-play, 66-yard drive, that culminated in a 5-yard touchdown run by Page Sessoms. Aided by a 15-yard personal foul penalty against the Bulldogs, the Golden Knights had advanced to the Georgia 12. Facing 4th & Goal at the 6 yard line, RamPage Sessoms slipped by untouched for the score. The deficit was trimmed to 14‚Äì10. Georgia went a quick three-and-out on their next drive, setting up a Jonathan Kilgo punt deep in their own territory. Rioct Joseph blocked the punt, and it was recovered by Thad Ward, who returned the ball 6 yards for a UCF touchdown. The Golden Knights led 17‚Äì14 with 9:26 remaining in the second quarter. On the next drive, Georgia fumbled away the ball near midfield. With the momentum swinging to UCF, the Golden Knights drove to the 10 yard line. Beorlegui's 27-yard field goal attempt was blocked by Kendrell Bell, and the drive came up empty. In the final minute, the Bulldogs managed a 54-yard field goal by Hap Hines, and a 17‚Äì17 halftime tie. On their first possession of the third quarter, Georgia drove 70 yards in 8 plays for a go- ahead touchdown. Jasper Sanks broke away for a 54-yard run, and a sure touchdown, but he was caught and tackled from behind by Travis Fisher. Moments later, the Bulldogs capped off the drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass from Carter to Michael Greer. At the end of the third quarter, Georgia led 24‚Äì17. In the fourth quarter, UCF put together a superb touchdown drive. UCF drove 89 yards in 12 plays. They never faced a third down. Omari Howard broke away for a 21-yard run down to the Georgia 32, setting the Knights up deep in Bulldogs territory. Vic Penn threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to Page Sessoms, but Javier Beorlegui missed the extra point. The score was now 24‚Äì23 with 9:13 remaining in regulation. With 1:41 left in regulation, trailing by only 1 point, Vic Penn began leading UCF on a hopeful game-winning drive. He swiftly drove the Golden Knights 61 yards to the Bulldogs 20 yard line, spiking the ball with 25 seconds left on the clock. Rather than taking a knee, running out the clock and attempting a 37-yard field goal as time expired, head coach Mike Kruczek decided to call another play. Kruczek admitted \\"I'm not overwhelmed with confidence in our field goal kicking\\", after Beorlegui's two earlier misses, and decided to take one last crack at the endzone instead. Penn threw a fade pattern to receiver Kenny Clark on the left front corner of the endzone, but the ball fell incomplete. Bulldogs cornerback Jeff Harris was all over Clark, but a flag was thrown for offensive pass interference. The Golden Knights were backed up 15 yards, and out of field goal range. A sack on the next play set up a desperation pass as time expired. Penn's pass was intercepted, sealing the game for Georgia, and snuffing out the upset bid. The offensive pass interference penalty was instantly controversial. Observers on both sides of the field were shocked by the call, which was made by an SEC officiating crew. UCF head coach Mike Kruczek said he saw \\"face guarding, defensive pass interference, plain and simple, and 86,000 people saw the same thing.\\" According to UCF radio announcer Marc Daniels, Harris was blanketing Clark along the sidelines, and \\"basically tackled Kenny Clark out of bounds.\\" Even Georgia head coach Jim Donnan appeared surprised, conjecturing it was a payback for the 102 yards of penalties Georgia had been assessed, saying \\"I thought it was a good call, even if it was a bad call - very apropos.\\" He went on to say \\"We might not be as good as everybody wants us to be.\\" Bulldogs radio announcer Larry Munson believed that UCF \\"got a really bad break on that call.\\" Harris claimed he \\"just tried to put my body between [Clark] and the ball, and he grabbed me.\\" Clark said afterwards \\"I'm not going to call it a bad call, but I thought it was defensive pass interference. I don't know how they could have made that call.\\" He went on to say UCF \\"let it slip away, and they [Georgia] know it\\". Quarterback Vic Penn, who at the time thought the pass attempt was a safe play call, reflected upon the incident saying \\"no doubt about it, we were robbed.\\" Later in the season, Georgia Tech coach George O'Leary (coincidentally the future UCF coach) was studying game film for his upcoming rivalry game against Georgia. When he came across the play in question he said \\"Whoaaa, there's those SEC officials again. It was a terrible call.\\" The Golden Knights had racked up 441 yards of offense with 30 first downs, controlling the clock for nearly 36 minutes. The Bulldogs had 13 penalties for 102 yards and committed the game's only turnover except for Penn's interception on the final play. Though Georgia escaped with the win, they were highly criticized for poor play, particularly on defense. UCF kicker Javier Beorlegui was singled out by many, having missed a field goal, an extra point, and having another field goal attempt blocked - all three of which could have changed the outcome. The game would go down as one of the most devastating losses in school history. The two teams would not play again until the 2010 Liberty Bowl. November 6: at Auburn The UCF Golden Knights traveled to Jordan‚ÄìHare Stadium to face the Auburn Tigers for the third straight year. Going into the game the Golden Knights were 0‚Äì8 against SEC teams, and 0‚Äì14 against major Division I-A opponents. The previous season, the Golden Knights had suffered a heartbreaking 10‚Äì6 loss at Auburn, and were looking to finally notch a win against a major opponent after a bevy near- misses. With a bowl berth out of the picture for 1999, and with the Tigers in the midst of a five-game losing streak, UCF instead shifted their focus on securing a signature victory to help further their program. In the first quarter, Auburn quarterback Jeff Klein threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to Tavares Robinson and an early 7‚Äì0 Tigers lead. The 73-yard opening drive included a 24-yard run by Heath Evans. However, Auburn's offense would suffer more frustration than success over the next two quarters of play. Pinned back at their own 2 yard line, UCF quarterback Vic Penn threw a crucial 13-yard pass completion to Kenny Clark from his own endzone. On the next play, Penn connected with Charles Lee for an 83-yard touchdown. The Golden Knights tied the game 7‚Äì7, despite Lee entering the game suffering from a stomach flu. At the start of the third quarter, Penn led the Golden Knights on a 9-play, 53-yard drive. Javier Beorlegui kicked a 39-yard field goal to give UCF a 10‚Äì7 lead. Later, Golden Knights safety Tommy Shavers intercepted Jeff Klein in the red zone, snuffing out a Tigers scoring opportunity. Auburn kicker Damon Duval missed two field goals wide left, and the Golden Knights clung to the same 10‚Äì7 lead at the end of the third quarter. Vic Penn drove the Golden Knights into Auburn territory early in the fourth quarter. Facing a third down at the Auburn 24 yard line with just over ten minutes left in regulation, Penn barely missed too high an open Charles Lee in the endzone. Instead, UCF lined up for a 43-yard field goal attempt. Beorlegui's kick hit the crossbar, and fell no good. Subsequently, the Tigers drove 70 yards in 16 plays, including five third down conversions, for a go-ahead 16-yard touchdown catch by Reggie Worthy with only 3:41 left in regulation. Trailing 14‚Äì10, the Golden Knights were pinned back deep in their own territory. Facing a 4th & 15, Penn was sacked at his own 8 yard line for a turnover on downs. One play later, the Tigers were back in the endzone with an 8-yard touchdown run by Heath Evans. The Golden Knights had one last meaningful possession, but Penn was intercepted by Alex Lincoln who returned the ball 20 yards for a touchdown, and a 28‚Äì10 final score. After trailing much of the game, the Tigers scored three touchdown in the span of 97 seconds to secure the victory. The two schools would not play one another again until the 2018 Peach Bowl.

It includes texts which Bentham published (or which were published in his name) during his lifetime; and also the many texts which remained unpublished at his death, and which exist only in manuscript. Scope and history The Collected Works is intended to supersede the 11-volume The Works of Jeremy Bentham (1838‚Äì1843), edited by Bentham's friend and literary executor, John Bowring, which is now considered to be flawed in many points of detail, and which omits Bentham's writings on religion; and also the 3-volume Jeremy Bentham's Economic Writings (1952‚Äì54) edited by Werner Stark, which has likewise been subject to criticism. The series is being published under the auspices of the Bentham Project at University College London, whose library holds the majority of Bentham's surviving manuscripts. Since 2010 the Project has also run Transcribe Bentham, a project for transcribing Bentham's manuscripts through crowdsourcing, the output of which is intended, once edited, to appear in future Collected Works volumes. The Bentham Project is governed by the Bentham Committee, which was established in 1959. The first volume in the Collected Works appeared in 1968, and to date 34 volumes have been published. The initial estimate was that the series would eventually run to approximately 38 volumes, but this figure has since risen to a projected total of 80. The series divides into two sequences: the Correspondence (including letters both to and from Bentham); and the Works, i.e. writings which Bentham intended for publication, although many never progressed beyond drafts or outlines. The series was published from 1968 until 1981 by the Athlone Press (once the University of London's publishing house, now defunct), but since 1983 it has been published by Oxford University Press under its Clarendon Press imprint. The first five volumes of Correspondence, originally published by Athlone Press, were reissued with minor corrections in 2017 by UCL Press, both in hard copy and in open access electronic formats. General Editors The General Editors of the series have been: J. H. Burns (1961‚Äì79); J. R. Dinwiddy (1977‚Äì83); Fred Rosen (1983‚Äì94); Fred Rosen and Philip Schofield (1995‚Äì2003); and Philip Schofield (2003‚Äìdate). Published volumes 12 volumes of Correspondence, of an eventual 14, have so far been published; and 22 volumes of Works. The Works volumes are not sequentially numbered. Those volumes which have been published to date are as follows: Correspondence * (Reissued with minor corrections by UCL Press in open access formats in 2017: ) * (Reissued with minor corrections by UCL Press in open access formats in 2017: ) * (Reissued with minor corrections by UCL Press in open access formats in 2017: ) * (Reissued with minor corrections by UCL Press in open access formats in 2017: ) * (Reissued with minor corrections by UCL Press in open access formats in 2017: )  Works * :Now superseded by: * (Reprinted in paperback with a new introduction by F.

With one brief interruption at the end of World War I, the membership remained constant throughout the quartet's existence: Joseph Zoellner and his children Antoinette; Amandus; and Joseph, Jr. A second \\"Zoellner Quartet\\" was later formed by Joseph, Jr. and three unrelated musicians.  Formation and European career  Joseph Zoellner founded the quartet, most likely in 1903 but possibly in 1904, in Brooklyn, where he operated a music school. From the group's founding until 1906 the members lived in Stockton, California, where he had opened a similar school or music store. Under sponsorship of Ethel Crocker, wife of San Francisco banking magnate William Henry Crocker, the Zoellners then went to Belgium for several years to hone their skills with the celebrated Belgian pedagogue C√©sar Thomson, who had also taught three members of the group's contemporary, the Flonzaley Quartet. The Zoellner Quartet's first European appearances were at C√©sar Thomson's private soirees, but the group soon began performing more widely in Belgium and in Paris and Berlin. Of particular note, late in the period of its European residency, the mother of King Albert I of Belgium presented the quartet with a gold medal specially struck by goldsmith C.H. Samuels after the group performed as royal guests of the Belgian king and queen in 1911.  North American career  Following its journeyman years in Europe, the quartet in the 1912‚Äì1913 season embarked on what would be a constant round of activity in Canada and the United States, keeping to an intense schedule during annual coast-to-coast tours. During an early 1919 tour of western Canada starting in Victoria, British Columbia, in the final city of Winnipeg the quartet gave its 500th performance in six years of touring; by 1921, its total was reported to be 1,100 performances upon return from a tour of the US East and Midwest, within a week of which it was scheduled to perform yet again in Los Angeles. In nine weeks ending in late March 1923 alone, the quartet performed 46 concerts in connection with its twelfth tour of the US East. In later years, Amandus was said to have participated in more than 2,500 performances during his career with the quartet. The quartet prided itself on keeping to non-stop schedules in its numerous transcontinental tours without letup or delays, even when on one occasion in 1921 Joseph, Jr. fell in Topeka, Kansas and was relegated to use of a crutch for a few days. In its North American years, as its celebrity grew, the quartet's members naturally associated with notable musicians such as Ernestine Schumann-Heink, Mischa Elman, and‚Äînot surprisingly, given the quartet's Belgian connections‚ÄîEug√®ne Ysa√øe. The group also, however, had less obvious associations with the famous of its day. In one colorful incident, as the quartet toured during the 1916‚Äì1917 season, it crossed paths with the famous deafblind author, activist, and lecturer Helen Keller and her teacher and companion Anne Sullivan in Oklahoma City, where Keller was scheduled for a lecture. Keller proposed as an experiment that the quartet should play for her, to determine whether she could sense music; readily acceding to her request, the quartet played music including the celebrated second movement, andante cantabile, from Tchaikovsky's String Quartet no. 1 in D Major, op. 11, as she held her fingertips lightly on a resonant tabletop. Keller quickly sensed the musical vibrations, swaying in time, alternately crying and smiling. Afterward, Keller reacted as follows: For his part, Joseph Zoellner rather more prosaically stated that he and the rest of the quartet felt they had been playing to a \\"responsive instrument\\" and were impressed with Keller's ability to interpret the music. For instance, although no one had told her the Tchaikovsky work supposedly had its basis in an old fisherman's song, Keller described it as evoking the sea and the ocean breeze on her face. More than a dozen years later, in January 1931, Albert Einstein, who was then engaged in research at the California Institute of Technology, visited the Zoellner family's conservatory and played violin with members of the quartet in music of Beethoven and Mozart. The following year, a few days before Einstein sailed for what would be his last visit to Germany, he presented Joseph Zoellner with an autographed photograph as a memento of the occasion. In the United States, as in Europe, the quartet was no stranger to the major cultural centers. Upon its return to America it first performed in New York City at Aeolian Hall on January 7, 1914, when, demonstrating a recurrent predilection for adventurously mixing music old and new, the program featured Glazounov's Suite in C Major, op. 35; Haydn's Quartet in G Major, op. 76 no. 1; and the Romantische Serenade of Jan Brandts Buys, which had been heard in New York on only one prior occasion. The quartet's sixth transcontinental tour of the United States and Canada, announced in late 1917, included two performances in New York City and others in Brooklyn, Philadelphia, Boston, and Chicago. The quartet saw its mission as broader than performing in such major venues, however; its aim was to widen the audience for chamber music, which the Zoellners considered an intimate form with personal appeal to the audience, even one lacking cultured appreciation of music. Thus, with missionary zeal, they consistently performed in towns well removed from the regular concert circuit, often ones that had never been visited by a string quartet. Toward the end of its 1921 season, for instance, the quartet had already committed to return engagements in Topeka and Wichita, Kansas; St. Joseph, Missouri; Dubuque, Iowa; Richmond, Indiana; and Peoria, Illinois. Pursuing this educational goal, the Zoellners performed in such unconventional surroundings as trains and an Illinois insane asylum. In 1916 the quartet presented Charles Sanford Skilton's \\"Indian Dances\\" to traditional audiences in Boston and also to five hundred Native Americans in Oklahoma, in each case receiving a standing ovation. In parallel with this diversity of performance locales, the quartet appears to have cultivated qualities calculated to please both cosmopolitan and discerning but less urbanized audiences and critics. Following the 1914 Aeolian Hall performance, a review in The New York Times commended the group's tone, intonation, and ensemble, while, tellingly, the Lawrence, Kansas Lawrence Journal-World in 1917 described the quartet as follows: \\"The Zoellner Quartet is a great favorite with Lawrence audiences, as its programs suit the tastes of the average concert-goer, and this without the inclusion of superficial music.\\" Giving an idea of how the quartet assembled its programs and the widely scattered smaller venues in which it played on what were tight schedules in those days before air travel, some of its documented performances in 1917 were as follows: * The performance in Lawrence, scheduled for April 5, included the String Quartet no. 1 in B-Flat on Maori (New Zealand) Themes by Alfred Hill; the adagio from a Mozart quartet in B-Flat major; the scherzo from Alexander Glazunov's Quartet no. 4 in A Minor; a piano quintet by Edgar Stillman Kelley, with Carl Preyer, head of the piano department at the local School of Fine Arts, at the keyboard; and arrangements of \\"Cherry Ripe\\" by Frank Bridge and of a German folk song by Kaessmayer. * Five days later, in Appleton, Wisconsin, the Quartet performed the same Hill quartet, Glazunov scherzo, and folk song arrangements, to which were added the nocturne from the Second Quartet by Alexander Borodin; the lullaby from a quartet by Skilton; and two works presented by subsets of the quartet: Sinding's Serenade for Two Violins and Piano, featuring Atoinette and Amandus on violins and Joseph, Jr. on piano, and Dvo≈ô√°k's Ballade in D Minor for Violin and Piano, performed by Amandus, presumably again with Joseph, Jr. as pianist. * On November 5, the quartet performed at the North Dakota Agricultural College, now North Dakota State University. The program included the \\"American\\" Quartet of Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k; \\"Deep River\\" (arr. Burleigh and Kramer) and a Russian folksong (arr. Kaessmeyer); a suite for two violins and piano by Em√°nuel Mo√≥r, played by Antoinette and Amandus with Joseph, Jr. on the piano; and K√°roly Thern's \\"Genius Loci\\" and Skilton's \\"War Dance\\" as encores, both by request. * A week later, on November 12, the quartet was in Columbia, Missouri to present the season's second Phi Mu Alpha concert at the University Auditorium. The works on the program again included the \\"American\\" Quartet and also Haydn's Quartet in C Major, op. 74, no. 1; Two Sketches for String Quartet by Eugene Goossens; and Quartet no. 2 in A Major, op. 28 by Eduard N√°pravn√≠k. From the beginning of its US career, the quartet also performed under the auspices of various performing arts societies and series, academic and civic, scattered across the United States. Among these appearances were the following: * June 26, 1912, 24th annual convention of the New York State Music Teachers' Association at Columbia University. Marie Rappold and Frank Croxton also performed, and David Bispham and Reginald de Koven discussed presentation of opera in English. * February 4, 1914, Saturday Morning Musical Club at the Temple of Music and Art in Tucson, Arizona. * 1915‚Äì16 season, fourth formal season of the Tuesday Morning Musical Club Concert Series, now Tuesday Musical, in Omaha, Nebraska; the quartet made a return appearance in the 1919‚Äì1920 season. * Between 1911 and 1920, performance series of the Schubert Club of St. Paul, Minnesota. The performances noted above suggest the Zoellner Quartet's breadth of repertory. This musical catholicity did not escape critical notice, as, for example, in a review by Florence Lawrence in the Los Angeles Examiner of July 26, 1919: \\"[T]he brilliant closing concert of the Zoellner chamber music season last night ... proved the climax in this unusual course, in which modern and classical works have been especially well contrasted, and testified vividly to the fine artistry of the musicians. It was a great personal achievement for the artists.\\" Occasioning that review was the conclusion of a marathon series of ten weekly recitals from May 23 to July 25, 1919 at the Ebell Club Auditorium in Los Angeles. Works presented over the course of this venture, ranging from Baroque to then-contemporary, were as follows: * Beethoven: Quartets no. 4 in C Minor, op. 18 no. 4; no. 6 in B-Flat Major, op. 18 no. 6; and no. 10 in E-Flat Major (\\"Harp\\") * Borodin: Quartet No. 2 in D Major * Brandts-Buys: Romantic Serenade, Op. 25 * Bridge: Noveletten; (arr.) Two Old English Songs. The quartet had begun including the Noveletten in its programs during its 1916 tour of Canada and the United States. * Debussy: Quartet in G Minor, op. 10 * Dohn√°nyi: Quartet no. 2 in D-Flat Major, op. 15 * Dvo≈ô√°k: Quartet no. 12 in F, op. 96 (\\"American\\") * Fasch: Sonate A Quatre * Franck: Quartet in D Major * Glazounov: Suite in C Major, Op. 35 * Eugene Goossens: Two Sketches, op. 15 * Handel: Sonata in G Minor for two violins and piano * Haydn: Quartets op. 51 (\\"Seven Last Words of Christ\\"); in C Major, op. 74 no. 1; and in G Major, op. 76 no. 1 * Hill: Quartet no. 1 in B-Flat * Jean Baptiste Loeillet (1653‚Äì1728): Sonate a Trois for violin, viola, and piano * Witold Maliszewski: Quartet no. 1 in F Major, op. 2 * Milhaud: Quartet in C * Jules Mouquet: Quartet no. 1 in C Minor, op. 3 * Mozart: Quartets no. 16 in E-Flat Major, K. 428; no. 17 in B-Flat Major, K. 458 (\\"Hunt\\"); and no. 21 in D Major, K. 575 (\\"Violet\\") * Eduard N√°pravn√≠k: Quartet no. 2 in A Major, op. 28 * Schubert: Quartet in E-Flat Major, D. 87 (op. 125 no. 1) * Schumann: Quartet in A Major, op. 41 no. 3 In 1922, the family, which had resided at 909 St. Marks Ave. in New York City and summered in Wrentham, Massachusetts, shifted its base of operations to California, where it had already performed actively, and settled in Los Angeles. There the Zoellners opened a conservatory, which eventually added branches in Hollywood and Burbank, California; it was still active as of 1942, well after the quartet's retirement, when the Hollywood branch conferred an honorary Doctor of Music Degree on bandmaster Earl Irons. Upon its resettlement, the quartet continued to be an active part of musical life in its adopted home. Nor did it restrict its educational endeavors to the activities of its own school: the quartet participated in the Behymer Philharmonic Series, a youth promotion initiative of low-priced concerts, four for $1.00, organized by Lynden Behymer. The quartet retired in 1925. As noted below, however, members of the family continued their involvement in music, both through the conservatory and through various institutions of higher learning, and evidently they still performed together occasionally, at least for a time, in that context. An appearance in a radio broadcast on station KHJ, Los Angeles, was scheduled for as late as November 24, 1927, and the group's informal performance with Albert Einstein took place in 1931.  Premieres and dedications  The Zoellner Quartet gave premieres or was dedicatee of works by a number of contemporary composers. Among them were the following: * Arthur Farwell, acting at the suggestion of Joseph Zoellner, wrote a string quartet titled \\"The Hako\\" in 1922 and dedicated it to the Zoellner Quartet, which performed it in 1923 at the Ojai Music Festival in Ojai, California. * Charles Sanford Skilton dedicated his Two Indian Dances to the Zoellner Quartet, which premiered them in January 1916. Carl Fischer Music published the works a year later, by which time Skilton had orchestrated them, and later still he incorporated them into his Suite Primeval. The Zoellner Quartet's Edison recording of the second number, \\"War Dance,\\" can be heard via the link above. * Eugene Goossens wrote a quartet for the Zoellners; they programmed it for their Eastern US tour in early 1919. * The Quartet premiered \\"Impressions of a Rainy Day,\\" a suite for quartet by Roy Harris, on March 15, 1926 at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles. * During its 1923 tour of the eastern United States, the Quartet gave the American premiere of Joseph Jongen's Serenade Tendre. * Also receiving its American premiere during the 1923 tour was a Fantasie for string quartet by Marion Frances Ralston.  Personnel  Antoinette Zoellner, from a postcard promoting a performance of the quartet in Meridian, Mississippi, January 20, 1914 The quartet's configuration was unusual, particularly for its day. Being, in the words of one 1917 article, \\"about the only string quartet in existence\\" to \\"honor\\" a female with the first violinist's chair in an otherwise entirely male ensemble, it drew public attention, as when, after a concert in Quebec, a suffragette leapt to her feet and cried, \\"I never thought I'd live to see it, but it comes to pass‚Äîone woman leading three men. Votes for women!\\" Moreover, the founder and most senior member, both by age and experience, served as violist. All three of the quartet's junior members studied first with their father before continuing studies in Brussels. * Antoinette Zoellner was first violinist. Information from her gravesite indicates that she was born on December 1, 1885, although other sources give 1889 or 1891; if either of the latter dates is correct, she would have been improbably young to take the first violinist's chair upon the quartet's founding. She studied with her father and, from 1907 to 1912, with C√©sar Thomson; she also studied singing with Raimund von zur-M√ºhlen. As of 1920, she shared a residence in Los Angeles with her father and brother Joseph, Jr. She died on March 11, 1962. * Amandus Carl Zoellner, second violinist, was born on November 7, 1892 and died on June 14, 1955. He and his wife, Ruth, n√©e Koehler, had at least two children, daughters Ruth and Marjorie; the former did not follow her father into music but eventually fell heir to the quartet's archives and arranged for their institutional preservation, with the scores going to Scripps College in Claremont, California and memorabilia and scrapbooks to UCLA. When not playing the violin, Amandus enjoyed photography and fishing. * Joseph Zoellner, the quartet's violist and father of the other three members, was born on February 2, 1862 and died on January 24, 1950. Initially, he trained as a violinist, first in New York and then in Germany. By the time he founded the quartet, he was a musical veteran, having already served as first violinist of the Theodore Thomas Orchestra in New York. He also gave initial training to all three other members of the quartet before their studies in Belgium. * Joseph Zoellner, Jr., cellist for nearly the entire life of the quartet, was born on October 26, 1886 and died in September 1964. Zoellner was a 1910 graduate of the Royal Conservatory of Brussels in both piano, in which he took honors, and cello; his teachers included Jean G√©rardy for cello, Paul Gilson for harmony, and Arthur de Greef for piano. Joseph, Jr. was the sole member to leave the quartet, when for a few months at the end of World War I he served as a corporal in the United States Army; the quartet's concert manager, Harry Culbertson of Chicago, likewise enlisted at that time. Both men had returned to civilian life by early 1919. * Robert Alter, who had played with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, substituted for Joseph, Jr. as cellist while the latter served in the army at the end of 1918, when the quartet had scheduled a tour of California. Alter had good chamber music credentials through his association with Alwin Schroeder, cellist for the Kneisel Quartet from 1891 to 1907. Joseph, Sr.; Antoinette; and Amandus are all buried in the Great Mausoleum at Forrest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. Joseph, Jr. is interred with his wife, Mabel R. Zoellner, at San Gabriel Cemetery.  Outside activities  Unlike their colleagues of the Flonzaley Quartet, who agreed to restrict themselves to performing as a group, various members of the Zoellner Quartet engaged in extensive outside activities. Besides individual undertakings, as noted above the family as a whole opened a music conservatory, eventually with locations in Los Angeles, Hollywood, and Burbank. Joseph, Jr. for three years was a member of the Symphony Concerts Durand in Brussels, and later served as dean and head of the piano department at the family's conservatory. He also was heard as accompanist for other artists; for instance, he and pianist/composer Charles Gilbert Spross performed with Gina Ciaparelli in the Lyceum at New York's Carnegie Hall on March 5, 1912. On that occasion he played two solos and the obbligato part in Courtlandt Palmer's Lethe. Joseph, Sr. also was a member of the Durand orchestra. He headed the violin department at the Ecole Communale in Etterbeek, now Brussels, from 1907 to 1912 and later the same department at the University of Redlands in Redlands, California. As in Brooklyn and Stockton, he was proprietor of a music school in Brussels. Amandus taught violin at the Ecole Communale when his father was director there, and like his father and brother he was a member of the Durand orchestra. Also like his father, Amandus served as university violin department director, first at Pomona College in Claremont, California and then at Occidental College in Los Angeles. At the latter he performed solo recitals as well as with the quartet. He helped found the Zoellner Conservatory of Music and eventually served as its president. Joseph, Sr. and Amandus together compiled The Zoellner Quartette Repertoire Album, a collection of music published by Carl Fischer Music. In addition, Joseph, Sr.; Amandus; and Antoinette all contributed essays regarding quartet playing to an omnibus volume on string instruments.  The New Zoellner Quartet  Joseph, Jr. followed his father's example by founding a quartet of his own, although it was not made up of relatives. This ensemble was based in Chicago, home town of Joseph, Jr.'s wife; the other members, all with previous connections to artistic organizations in that city, were Charles Buckley and Michael Rill, first and second violinists, respectively, and violist Jose Marones. A family account dated the founding to 1950, but promotional literature cited a review in 1938. In either event, sources agree that the new group was active through the 1950s, although it appears not to have achieved its predecessor's level of widespread recognition.  Recordings  The original Zoellner Quartet left six sides issued as Edison diamond discs and at least three more recorded for Columbia. All were acoustic recordings, and, like their counterparts in the contemporary Flonzaley Quartet's acoustic discography, comprised isolated movements, arrangements, and encore pieces rather than complete works. As noted above, one of the Edison records captured a performance of Skilton's \\"War Dance,\\" of which the Zoellner Quartet was dedicatee. * Anonymous: Humoresque on Two American Folk Songs, Columbia 37391; also issued as A-7534 (Nov. 1915) * Boccherini: Quintet in E, op. 13 no. 5 ‚Äì Minuet.

History Foundation stone of St Luke's Church The site bounded by Manchester, Lichfield and Peterborough Streets was one of five sites set aside by the Canterbury Association in the original survey of Christchurch, which was carried out during 1850. A church, the Chapel of Ease, was built on the site between 1858 and 1860. After St Michael and All Angels, it was the second Anglican church in Christchurch. The result was described as \\"ugly and barn-like\\". This first church had a frontage onto Peterborough Street, and it was extended in 1871 based on a design by Benjamin Mountfort. The Chapel of Ease was demolished in 1908. St Luke's was designed by Cyril Mountfort, the son of Benjamin Mountfort, in Gothic revival style. St Luke's design is similar to two churches designed by Mountfort Senior in the 1880s; The Church of the Good Shepherd in Phillipstown (demolished in 2011) and St John's Cathedral in Napier (destroyed in the 1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake). The foundation stone was laid by Bishop Julius on 3 September 1908. Construction took 13 months and the contract value was ‚Ç§9,800. The church was consecrated on 17 October 1909 by Bishop Julius, and the sermon read by Archdeacon Averill. Of the series of eight stamps issued by New Zealand Post for Christmas 1995, the four highest denominations ($0.80 to $1.80) depicted scenes from the stained glass windows of St Luke's. The church was badly damaged in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, deconsecrated, and demolished the following July. The church can be seen in Gerard Symth's video chronicle of the earthquakes, When A City Falls. The congregation is still meeting, despite the earthquake damage, and counselling services continue. Services are currently held in the Mary Potter Community Centre, and at the central-city Knox presbyterian church, as well as weekday morning prayer on the St Luke's site but the rebuilding of a church on the site is uncertain. Heritage registration The church was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category II heritage building with registration number 3353.

When it was built in 1912, at 15,750 square meters, it was the largest building in western Canada. It was designated a historic resource in November 1981 but then in a motion from city council that designation was rescinded. The building was taken down December 12, 1982. Robert Tegler was an entrepreneur and businessman who came to Edmonton in the early 1900s. He saw opportunity in Edmonton and decided to erect the Tegler Building at the corner of what was then known as Elizabeth Street and First Street (now 102nd Avenue and 101st Street). The building site was located at 10189 101 St NW. Herbert Alton Magoon was hired to design a six-storey building, 100 feet long, 70 feet wide and 80 feet high. Construction started in 1911 and was completed in early 1912. An expansion to the Tegler building was needed by 1913 and so Robert Tegler started construction on the third floor over top of the Edmonton Journal building, eventually building down to ground level when the Edmonton Journal moved. While the Tegler Building was taken down in 1982, parts of the historic building live on in The Tegler Foundation and its subsequent buildings. The Tegler Manor - constructed in 1982 - houses many of the original bricks from the building, as well as the mural by Ernest Huber depicting early life in Alberta which once graced the lobby above the elevators in the original building.

History Furna Feia park is the first national park in Rio Grande do Norte. Creation of the park was stalled by resistance from mining operations in the area, mainly limestone for use in making cement. As a compromise of the planned park where mining applications had been filed were given up, removing the main obstacle. The park was created on 5 June 2012, and is administered by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio). President Dilma Rousseff announced creation of the park on World Environment Day. Location The park is in the Caatinga biome and has an area of . The park lies in the municipalities of Bara√∫na and Mossor√≥ in the state of Rio Grande do Norte. Furna Feia (Ugly Cavern) is the largest cave complex in the state of Rio Grande do Norte. So far more than 200 caves have been found. The main cave is long, and is the most important attraction in the park. The park holds about 105 species of plants and 135 species of animals, some of which are endangered. Eleven species of troglobite invertebrates have been found, all new to science. Conservation The parks is classed as IUCN protected area category II (national park). Its goals are to preserve the speleological complex of Furna Feia and the biodiversity associated with the Caatinga biome, to carry out scientific research and to develop educational activities, environmental interpretation, outdoors recreation and eco-tourism. ICMBio works with the local people to try to prevent actions that degrade the natural resources of the park, which include hunting, illegal removal of timber and destructive visits to the caves, particularly the main cave. The agency has established a fire brigade to help prevent forest fires in the conservation unit.

After confronting the head of the oil company, Carruthers, Gene realizes that his employers are crooked oil promoters trying to peddle the land on which the poor Mexican orphanage is located. Gene quits his job and travels down to Mexico to investigate. Along the way he meets a Mexican bandit named Valdez who, with Gene's influence, comes to see himself as a modern-day Robin Hood. At the orphanage, Gene is reunited with Anita and meets her uncle. The padre tells Gene that he leased the land to Carruthers on a royalty basis and that the company has no plans of drilling, content making money by selling worthless shares in a non-existent well. Without the royalties, the orphanage will soon go bankrupt. At a fundraising dance held at the orphanage, Gene sings a romantic song to Anita. Valdez arrives and in keeping with his Robin Hood role, \\"encourages\\" those present to contribute to the donation box. Meanwhile, Carruthers' men arrive and kidnap Alta Vista's lead engineer Blythe, who intended to spill the beans on the company's scheme. Gene and Frog chase after them and rescue Blythe who confirms that there is oil in the area. Gene comes up with a plan to get Carruthers to start drilling. After identifying the land most likely to contain oil, Gene, his sidekick, Frog Millhouse, and Valdez plant oil in the area, upriver from the oil company office. Later, when Carruthers tastes oil in the drinking water, he and his men track the source of the oil and build a derrick on the site, just as Gene had planned. As construction is completed, however, Carruthers learns of Gene's ruse and abandons the well. Trusting that the site will produce oil, Gene convinces the investors to buy up the rest of Carruthers' stock and drill. When Carruthers learns that there really is oil on the land and that his men have sold all his holdings, he begins a campaign of sabotage hoping to buy back the stock. When two orphans go missing, Gene tracks them to a cabin where Carruthers and his men are holed up. In the ensuing fight, Gene is captured but soon escapes when Valdez arrives on the scene. The orphans are rescued thanks to the heroic efforts of Valdez who sacrifices his life to save the children and dies like a true Robin Hood. As the well comes in, Gene remembers Valdez saying, \\"He was a true friend.\\" Cast * Gene Autry as Gene Autry * Smiley Burnette as Frog Millhouse * Noah Beery as Valdez * Luana Walters as Anita Loredo * William Farnum as Padre Dominic * William Royle as Carruthers * LeRoy Mason as Blythe * Wally Albright as Tommy Romero * Kathryn Frye as Chalita Romero * Roy Barcroft as 'Mac' McElroy * Dick Botiller as Manuel, Valdez Rider * Vic Demourelle as Hollister * John Beach as Henchman Brown * Henry Otho as The Alcade * Champion as Gene's Horse (uncredited) Production=Stuntwork * Ken Cooper (Gene's double) * Jack Kirk (Smiley's double) * Hal Wills * George DeNormand * Eddie Parker * Bill Yrigoyen * Joe YrigoyenMagers, p. 131.

History=Origins The terminal opened in the twentieth century to provide a commute option for passengers headed to San Francisco across the bay. It was predated by numerous passenger, cargo, and vehicle ferries that connected the mainland with San Francisco's rather isolated peninsula before the advent of numerous bridges crossing the bay. The ferries declined upon the opening of the Oakland-San Francisco Bay Bridge but as traffic and time increased a water crossing service was reborn. Rebirth The service was created by pressure from the community to have a ferry service similar to that offered from Marin County to San Francisco's north. Their ferry service declined after the opening of bridges and although routes and terminals were closed, streamlined, or eliminated - the service was never abandoned. This was much to the benefit of the waterfront communities of that region. Oakland also presented the unique challenge of an adjacent island, the city of Alameda being located just hundreds of feet away with only one congested roadway tunnel linking the city's downtown and business core to the island's population centers directly. The Oakland Alameda Estuary presented many unique localized peculiarities. It is a major shipping channel and the shipping traffic of the Port of Oakland along with a highly developed shoreline prohibited a new bridge. Another fact, tunneling in an earthquake and liquefaction plagued region is extremely expensive for a rather poor community. Lastly what remains of the wetlands of the once large estuarine habitat is fervently protected by locals in order to preserve wildlife in addition to flood and pollution controls offered by these natural tidal flats and shoreline vegetation. Ferry For these reasons a service was established between a new Alameda Ferry Terminal and Oakland with continuing commuter service to the San Francisco Ferry Building and also Fisherman's Wharf at Pier 41. When the new shoreside Oracle Park opened season service was added in addition to expedition service to Angel Island State Park. In 2012 service was added to a new South San Francisco Ferry Terminal at the Oyster Point marina and park.New East Bay-South S.F. ferry service starts, Michale Cabanatuan, San Francisco Chronicle, 04-06-2012, access date 04-06-2012 ReferencesExternal links *San Francisco Bay Ferry Ferry terminals in the San Francisco Bay Area Transportation in Oakland, California Transportation buildings and structures in Alameda County, California ","title":"Oakland Ferry Terminal"},{"id":"36062838","text":"To the Ladies is a 1923 American silent comedy film produced by Famous Players-Lasky and released by Paramount Pictures.

Biography Monnin was named Miss Pennsylvania USA 2012 and competed at the Miss USA 2012 pageant, though she failed to place. Monnin was sued by Donald Trump for $5 million for calling the pageant \\"rigged.\\" She alleged that the Miss Universe Organization had predetermined the results of the Miss USA 2012 pageant. A default judgment was entered due to faulty legal advice from her lawyer, who failed to prepare for or attend the arbitration hearing. Monnin was told by her lawyer that she didn‚Äôt need to attend the hearing. Because she failed to show up for court, the judge entered a default judgment against her for $5 million. She later sued her attorney and was able to recover expenses and also resolve the lawsuit. Miss USA 2012 controversy In June 2012, Monnin said that another contestant, Karina Brez (as Miss Florida USA), saw the names of the top five on a telecast paper in the same order in which they were later called out. Brez later said she had made her comment jokingly. Brez went on to then say that she made the whole thing up, changing her story more than once. Monnin stepped down when what she said were those same contestants were named to the Top 5. Fox News reported an unnamed second contestant had confirmed Monnin's account: \\"I thought it might be because she didn't make the top 15 cut, but at that point [Monnin] was able to reveal to me at least four of the five names who went on to be the top girls. She couldn't remember the fifth because she was so upset\\" On the night of the Miss USA awards, Monnin made a Facebook post resigning her position: > I have decided to resign my position as Miss Pennsylvania USA 2012. > Effective immediately I have voluntarily, completely, and utterly removed > myself from the Miss Universe Organization. In good conscience I can no > longer be affiliated in any way with an organization I consider to be > fraudulent, lacking in morals, inconsistent, and in many ways trashy. I do > not support this system in any way.

I remove my support completely and have turned in the > title of Miss Pennsylvania USA 2012. Immediately following Monnin's resignation, The Trump Organization publicly denied Monnin's allegations. In an interview with Good Morning America (ABC News), Donald Trump accused her of \\"loser's remorse\\", saying \\"She lost and if you look at her compared to the people who were in the top 15, you would understand why she's not in the top 15. It's a very, very sad situation.\\" He went on to defend the honesty of the final round judging: \\"Ernst & Young is one of the great, respected accounting firms. They do the tabulation. It's not like we care who the final contestants are. You take the 16 and you go down to 10 to five and then you have a winner and then it's all tabulated. The judges are all celebrities and they make their pick and that's the end of it.\\" The pageant organizers initiated an arbitration proceeding against Monnin for defamation and damages, arguing that they lost a $5 million BP sponsorship and reputation because of her allegations. Monnin refused to renounce her claims. In the December 30, 2012 default judgment, an arbitrator ruled that she must pay the pageant organization $5 million for direct damages, but did not award the other demands of the organizers. According to an interview with Monnin's father by The Daily Beast, the other demands included that Monnin remove from her Facebook page all references to Trump or the pageant. He said that when he conveyed the message she would not remove the material, Michael Cohen \\"threw a fit on the phone. He basically said if I went along with my daughter I was an idiot. And said that she should apologize and if she didn‚Äôt want to, then ‚ÄòGame on,‚Äô and he slammed the phone down. And that was the end of the conversation.\\" On July 2, 2013, Federal Judge J. Paul Oetken upheldMiss Universe L.P., LLLP. v. Monnin, 2013 WL 3328241 (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2013) the decision that Monnin must pay Donald Trump and the Miss USA pageant for direct damages caused by calling the pageant \\"fraudulent\\". The decision was based on the legal principle that arbitrations are rarely voided. The ruling stated: \\"The court does not take lightly that Monnin is compelled to pay ...a devastating monetary award.\\" A November 4, 2013 lawsuit against her prior lawyer (from abstract) was reported by TMZ to have been settled for \\"somewhere north of a million bucks\\", and a deal was made to settle with Trump for \\"more than a million bucks\\". Her father told The Daily Beast that she \\"no longer speaks publicly about the lawsuit.\\" and \\"She‚Äôs fine. She‚Äôs moved on with her life. She‚Äôs not had to rescind what she said.\\" The Beast noted that the judgment \\"was satisfied in August 2014\\", and speculated that she might be under a gag order as part of the deal. Jeff Lee, a judge for Miss Universe, later told GQ that since 2005, Donald Trump would pick as many as six semifinalists to go on to the final round, allegedly in response to the failure of Oleksandra Nikolayenko to progress in 2004. GQ reported that \\"the international finals are rigorously judged\\" but described \\"massaging\\" at lower stages, quoting Anya Ayoung-Chee (2008 Miss Trinidad and Tobago) who said \\"You kind of know the thing is fixed and predetermined.

Early and family life James Wheat was born on May 10, 1810, the fourth son of merchant Thomas Wheat and his wife Mary Chatham, at Cool Spring Plantation, Prince George's County, Maryland. Although his father lived in Washington, D.C. during the War of 1812 and had some connection with the Washington Navy Yard, James lived most of his adult life in Wheeling, Ohio County in what became West Virginia during the American Civil War. His father and uncle Benoni Wheat were West Indies traders with a dock and warehouses in Alexandria, Virginia. His elder brothers were John Thomas Wheat (1801-1888), Samuel Wheat who moved to St. Louis, Missouri and Henry; his sisters were Mary E. and Josephine.North American family history 1500-2000 database; Wheat Genealogy: a History of the Wheat family in America, with a brief account of the name, pp. 347-348 He married Elizabeth Johnson Dorsey (b. 1820) and by the 1850 census lived in Wheeling (then still in Virginia) and supported his parents and sister and her child, as well as his children James Cheatham Wheat (1840-1915), Julia Wheat (b.1843), Stanley Hulliken Wheat (1842-1932) and Eli D. Wheat (b. 1849).1850 U.S. Federal Census for District 44, Ohio County, Virginia, family 1908 in residence 18341860 U.S. Federal Census for family 2357 in Ward 4, Wheeling, Ohio County disagrees with some of spelling, showing his wife as Mary L. Wheate, his 21 year old son as civil engineer James S. Wheat, their eldest daughter as Elizabeth J. Wheate and youngest child as daughter Ella D. Wheat; two Irish-born domestics also lived with the family Career James Sanders Wheat was admitted to the Virginia bar and practiced law in Wheeling. Ohio County voters elected him to represent them in the Virginia House of Delegates in 1849, and he served in that single session which began on December 3, succeeding William Pitts and was succeeded by Charles W. Russell in the legislative session that began on December 2, 1850.Cynthia Miller Leonard, Virginia General Assembly, 1619-1978 (Richmond: Virginia State Library 1978) p. 437 His last name was spelled \\"Wheate\\" as in some 1860 census documents, but they appear the same person. By contrast, although they had the same initials, he was not related to Unionist farmer and legislator Joseph Shaw Wheat of Berkeley Springs in what became Morgan County, West Virginia, because that J.S. Wheat was the son of an English emigrant (and innkeeper). When Virginia seceded from the Union in early April 1861, West Virginians disagreed, and many met in Clarksburg on April 22, 1861 and called for a convention to decide their status. The first Wheeling Convention (with representatives from 24 Unionist counties including Frederick County which chose not to join them), met beginning on May 13, 1861, but could not decide whether to secede from the Commonwealth of Virginia. Wheat was a member of the moderate faction which believed that open resistance to Virginia authorities so soon after their secession vote would invite disturbance and bloodshed. Other members of that faction included fellow attorney Francis H. Pierpont of Fairmont (with whom Wheat disagreed on other matters), John J. Jackson Sr.https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid;=8427911 of Parkersburg, and Waitman T. Willey of Morgantown.George E. Moore, A Banner in the Hills (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts 1963) pp. 58-60 The delegates called for elections for a second convention, which met at Wheeling beginning June 4, with representatives from 32 counties. General John J. Jackson and Waitman T. Willey were conspicuously absent; Arthur I. Boreman was elected the convention's president. On June 19 the delegates decided to enact an ordinance to re-establish a loyal state government, and by evening had elected Francis H. Pierpont the governor and Daniel Polsley as lieutenant governor. James S. Wheat, who had been acting as adjutant-general in the Unionist territory for a month, was elected the state's attorney general on June 21.Moore, pp. 80-83Lewis pp. 181-183 Meanwhile, John Randolph Tucker continued as Virginia's Attorney General in Confederate sections of the state. President Abraham Lincoln acknowledged Pierpont as Virginia's governor and soon named fellow Wheeling attorney A. Bolton Caldwell as the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia, to handle federal matters (and the U.S. Senate concurred). After West Virginia voters seceded from Virginia, and approved their new Constitution in the summer of 1863, they selected Caldwell to become their first Attorney General (and Boreman to become their first Governor). Caldwell had run unopposed.Lewis, pp. 187-188 Meanwhile, Virginia voters in Union-held territory (known as the Restored Government of Virginia, which had expanded to include Alexandria and much of northeastern Virginia), elected Thomas Russell Bowden to succeed Wheat. Wheat returned to what had become West Virginia, and was a member of its state Constitutional Convention in 1872.Virgil A.

Geography  The town is on the Leichhardt River in the remote north-west of Queensland, north west of the state capital Brisbane. The town is small, described by a travel writer as \\"no more than a pub and a couple of houses\\". The Kalkadoon Hotel is the only commercial business in the town. History The town takes its name from its former railway station, which was named by Railways Department on 29 April 1915. It is reportedly an Aboriginal word, but the language and dialect were not recorded, indicating kite hawk. Nearby Battle Mountain was the scene of an armed conflict between local Kalkadoon people and European cattlemen supported by the armed forces. Many of the local Aborigines were killed. In the 1920s Kajabbi was a service centre for nearby copper mines at Dobbyn and Mount Cuthbert.

It is located in the historic Glendower Street neighbourhood, within the medieval town walls. The eight bedroom home is most remarkable for the rear of the property which features a Coalbrookdale verandah and formal walled garden that have been separately grade II listed with the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales. The villa's garden is also registered with the Welsh Historic Gardens Trust. History 1610 map of Monmouth by John Speed St John's (pictured) at 11 Glendower Street has been described as \\"one of Monmouth's best-kept secrets.\\" It is an 18th-century, grade II listed building. St John's derived its name from a mistaken assertion by author Charles Heath at the turn of the 19th century. He had claimed that a monastery of St John was present at one time in the vicinity. St John's is located on the south side of Glendower Street, within the medieval walls of Monmouth that were built around 1300 and are shown on Speed's map of the town (pictured). In the mid 19th century, St John's was the residence of a physician. A carriage lane, coach house, and stables were on the east side of the property. The doctor could be quickly conveyed by his carriage driver to patients who needed his assistance on an urgent basis. In 1891, the residence was referred to as St John's College. The principal of the school was a widow, Mrs. Marshall. In 1901, 11 Glendower Street was home to a retired farmer, Henry Perkins, and his family. In 1923, Mrs. Willis resided at St John's; she continued to live there in 1934. The property is included on the 1901 Second Edition Ordnance Survey map of Monmouthshire. Details of the garden depicted on the map include a conservatory, kitchen garden, and tennis court. The home includes the main house and a smaller building; the total complex has eight bedrooms. The main residence has a two-storey, somewhat unimposing street elevation and a three- storey rear elevation. The ground floor features a parlor, dining room, and kitchen. The first floor has three bedrooms, and the second floor three additional bedrooms, as well as a cloakroom and den. The smaller building has a living room, kitchen, and shower on the ground floor, with two bedrooms and a bathroom on the first floor. The two-storey, three-bay street elevation has a pedimented entrance flanked by fluted columns. There is a roughcast exterior and a slate roof. The rear of the property is remarkable for the mid 19th- century, cast iron, Coalbrookdale verandah which runs the length of the three- story rear elevation. There is a 19th-century, formal, walled garden between the villa and Chippenham Park to the south. High brick walls are present on the east and west sides of the garden. The south end of the garden is wider than that closer to the house, with a low stone wall and gate that access Chippenham Park. Lawn has replaced the early 20th-century tennis court. The site of the former kitchen garden, east of the formal garden, was sold in the 1920s and currently has a building on it. The house was grade II listed on 9 April 1973. Later, the garden, including the verandah, was grade II listed, and registered by 1994 with the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales, ICOMOS a reference to the International Council on Monuments and Sites.

Full squad Laboviƒá made the Serbian national basketball team under head coach Moka Slavniƒá for the EuroBasket 2007. ;Controversial 2012 press release about Du≈°an Ivkoviƒá During summer 2012, head coach Du≈°an Ivkoviƒá included Laboviƒá on the preliminary list of players for the EuroBasket 2013 qualifying, but the 25-year-old power forward who spent the previous season with BC Krasnye Krylia from Samara didn't make the final cut. Commenting his decision to exclude Laboviƒá, Ivkoviƒá reportedly said that \\"Laboviƒá has issues with his weight as he recently became a father and probably celebrated a little too much\\". Stung by Ivkoviƒá's comment, Laboviƒá responded months later in September 2012 by putting out a bitter, somewhat cryptic, and highly unusual press release, which was published by Serbian sports media outlets. Though Ivkoviƒá's comments were made months earlier, Laboviƒá's press release came after the end of qualifying cycle in which Serbia barely qualified for the EuroBasket. In the release Laboviƒá criticized 68-year-old Ivkoviƒá's professional integrity and coaching skills, accusing the famous coach of letting his agent Mi≈°ko Ra≈ænatoviƒá of the BeoBasket agency exert an undue influence when it comes to squad selection for the national team. Among other things, addressing Ivkoviƒá directly, Laboviƒá said: A few weeks after his press release, Laboviƒá's club BC Nizhny Novgorod led by a Serbian head coach Zoran Lukiƒá, reprimanded the player although his punishment was not specified.

As of 2010, there has been a renaissance of Chumash pride and identity, including efforts to revive Samala and other Chumash languages. In the early 1900s linguist/ethnographer John P. Harrington worked with Maria Solares, one of the last fluent speakers of Samala. He created manuscripts containing information on Chumash language, culture, and traditions. Dr. Richard Applegate, who received a Ph.D. in linguistics from U.C. Berkeley, used these manuscripts to write an extensive grammar of Samala and compile a dictionary of the language, which was released in 2008. Dr. Applegate and Nakia Zavalla, the Cultural Director for the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash and a direct descendant of Maria Solares, have begun an effort to revitalize the language. Applegate began teaching Samala in 2003, and Zavalla has spearheaded an immersion-based language apprentice program. As of 2008, Applegate had five language apprentices; however, none had yet reached full fluency. An online Samala Chumash tutorial is available.

It used Aerozine 50 fuel, and oxidizer. Rocketdyne provided the injector system, at the request of NASA, when Bell could not solve combustion instability problems. Origins The LMAE traces its origin to the earlier Bell Aerosystems engines (8096, 8247) used in the RM-81 Agena, the American rocket upper stage and satellite support bus developed by Lockheed initially for the canceled WS-117L reconnaissance satellite program. The Agena served as an upper stage for several defense, intelligence, and exploration programs: SAMOS-E, SAMOS-F (ELINT Ferret) and MIDAS (Missile Defense Alarm System) military early-warning satellites, Corona photo intelligence program, and the Ranger and Lunar Orbiter lunar probes. The Lockheed Agena target vehicle using the Bell 8247 engine was qualified for 15 restarts for NASA's Project Gemini. A total of 365 Agena rockets were launched by NASA and the US Air Force between February 28, 1959 and the last Agena D launched on 12 February 1987, configured as the upper stage of a Titan 34B. Development During the spring of 1963, Grumman hired Bell to develop the lunar module ascent engine, on the assumption that Bell's experience in development of the Air Force Agena engine would be transferable to the lunar module requirements. Grumman placed heavy emphasis upon high reliability through simplicity of design, and the ascent engine emerged as the least complicated of the three main engines in the Apollo space vehicle, including the LM descent and CSM service propulsion system engines. Embodying a pressure-fed fuel system using hypergolic (self- igniting) propellants, the ascent engine was fixed-thrust and nongimbaled, capable of lifting the ascent stage off the Moon or aborting a landing if necessary. The engine developed about of thrust, which produced a velocity of 2,000 meters per second from lunar launch, to LOR, and CM docking. It weighed 180 pounds (81.6 kg), with a length of 47 inches (119.4 cm) and diameter of 34 inches (86.4 cm). RS-18 Engine Rocketdyne brought the lunar module ascent engine out of its 36-year retirement, now designated as RS-18, and reconfigured this non-throttleable hypergolic engine to use LOX/methane for NASA Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS) engine testing in 2008.

The mineral varies in color from green-brown to red-brown. It was discovered in 1986 in Manitoba, Canada, and named for Robert Bury Ferguson (born 1921). , the mineral has only been found in Canada and Argentina. Description Bobfergusonite occurs as equant anhedral single crystals up to in size or as nodular aggregates of few crystals.Ercit, p. 600. The mineral varies in color from green-brown to red- brown. Thin fragments of bobfergusonite are transparent. Bobfergusonite has been found in association with alluaudite, apatite, beusite, fillowite, and triplite. Bobfergusonite is a primary mineral that occurs in the intermediate zone of manganese and fluorine enriched granitic pegmatites. Structure Bobfergusonite has a layered crystal structure topologically identical to that of alluaudite and wyllieite but with differences in the ordering of metal cations. The two types of layer alternate along Y. One layer consists of chains of metal cation octahedra cross-linked by phosphate tetrahedra. Within the chains metal cations are ordered M3+‚ÄìM2+ in a similar fashion to wyllieite. However, the structure of bobfergusonite is distinct by the presence of Al and Fe3+ ordering between chains. The other layer, identical to its wyllieite counterpart, consists of chains running parallel to X: one consisting of alternating, face-sharing sodium and manganese polyhedra and the other edge-sharing sodium polyhedra. These chains are not cross-linked but bind the other layers together.Ercit, p. 605. History Alan J. Anderson discovered large brown crystals in a granitic pegmatite at Cross Lake in Manitoba. Study by electron microprobe and X-ray diffraction identified it as a new mineral related to the wyllieite and alluaudite groups. The mineral was named for professor Robert Bury Ferguson to celebrate his 65th birthday and retirement from the University of Manitoba.Ercit, p. 599. The mineral and the name bobfergusonite were approved by the IMA Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names. Distribution , bobfergusonite is known from the Nancy pegmatite in Argentina and the Gottcha Claim in Manitoba, Canada. The type material is held at the University of Manitoba and the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto.

Lovecraft Film Festival.  Plot  The film is told through the perspective of Rebecca Marsh (Renee Sweet) a young reporter, dissatisfied with the boredom of her current occupation, who is sent to conduct a special Halloween program dedicated to H.P. Lovecraft, renowned horror writer, and worldbuilder. Rebecca's personality is initially skeptical, however, she and her assistant, Amber (Denise Amrikhas), find that their lives are in danger once they discover that the various creatures, societies, and gods featured in Lovecraft's short stories do exist, and are now actively pursuing the two of them. Rebecca and her crew enlist the help of an expert in the occult and a witch, who assist them in fighting the forces of evil, which are revealed to be minions of the Dark God Nyarlathotep and are attempting to summon him into the real world.

The school was built in 1938 and was the first publicly supported black high school in Fredericksburg. The school was named for Joseph Walker (born 1854) and Jason Grant (1861‚Äì1951) who worked to establish the school. The Art Deco designed school was added to the National Register of Historic Places in October 1998. Joseph Walker and Jason Grant Walker was born into slavery in Spotsylvania County, Virginia. He was owned by the Goodwin family. Once freed at the conclusion of the American Civil War, he held a variety of jobs in Caroline and Spotsylvania counties. In the 1870s he moved to Fredericksburg where he worked at a paper mill. Though he was almost entirely self-taught, and unable to read or write well, he had a strong interest in education. Grant's father was a slave in Kentucky who fled to Chatham, Ontario, Canada to escape a whipping. Grant attended schools in Chatham, Pontiac, Michigan, and at the Wilberforce Educational Institute in Ohio. Grant met a teacher from Fredericksburg, Virginia while he was working as a waiter in New York. He was convinced to move to Fredericksburg to teach there. He taught mostly in country schools and was the principal of the Fredericksburg Colored School. In 1924 he retired after 42 years in education. History Both Walker and Grant worked together with others to create the Fredericksburg Normal and Industrial Institute, the first high school for blacks in Fredericksburg. The Institute opened in 1905 with 20 students, supported only by donations from residents and, thus, was not a public school. The school opened in the basement of the Shiloh Baptist Church. In 1906, the Institute was moved to a farmhouse on land purchased in an area of Fredericksburg known as Moorefield. The name of the area was changed to Mayfield. A new building was constructed for the school in the 1920s with four classrooms, an office, science laboratory, cloak rooms and about 20 rooms for boarding students. In time, the financial burden on the black community to support the growing and successful school became too great and by 1935 the school was struggling to survive. In 1938, the Fredericksburg Normal and Industrial Institute was made part of the city school system. The school was merged with the nearby black elementary school and the entire school was named Walker‚ÄìGrant. When the Fredericksburg school system was integrated in 1968, Walker‚ÄìGrant became the city's middle school, serving white and black students. In 1988, Walker‚ÄìGrant Middle School moved to a new building, retaining the Walker‚ÄìGrant name. The original Walker‚ÄìGrant building is still used by the Fredericksburg school system for administrative offices and the Head Start Program.

A man, whose identity is known, kills his own neighbors ‚Äï including a middle-school girl ‚Äï living in his building, and continues to stay there even after committing the grisly murders. All the neighbors in the film are reluctant to act due to self-interest. One character does not want the property price to fall after a scandal. Another wants to avoid attention from the police, as he has just five months left before his statute of limitations runs out. Some simply do not want to meddle without evidence, clinging to their daily routines. Meanwhile, the criminal continues to kill.

It is located on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. Lombrum is the home port of the PNGDF's Pacific-class patrol boat force. After redevelopment in 1950 by the Royal Australian Navy, it was known as HMAS Seeadler, being renamed HMAS Tarangau soon afterwards. The Manus Regional Processing Centre was established within the base in 2001. History The naval facility was first built during World War II as a \\"Lion\\" which was code for a major Fleet installation of the United States Navy. It was constructed by the Seabees of CBs 11, 58, and 71 and commissioned in January 1944. Although a major base during the latter part of the war, the facility was abandoned by the Americans in 1946 with the downsizing of their military and their policy of containment shifted strategic focus away from the southern Pacific. The Australian government took over the site, redeveloped it, and reopened it as the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) base HMAS Seeadler, commissioning on 1 January 1950 to replace the RAN base at Dreger Harbour, near Finschhafen. The base was renamed HMAS Tarangau, the name of the former Dreger Harbour base, on 1 April 1950. The base was used as a refuelling and stores point for RAN ships travelling between Australia and South East Asia. The size of the facility gradually shrank through the 1950s and 1960s, and the decision was made to hand the facility over to Papua New Guinea as part of the process leading to the nation's independence from Australia. As part of this, Tarangau was paid off on 14 November 1974 and given to the Papua New Guinea Defence Force, who reactivated the base as PNG Defence Force Base Lombrum. In 2018 Australian and Papua New Guinea officials met to discuss expanding the base again, so that it can also serve as a base for Australian and United States Navy vessels.

Development The 2005 NASA Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS) recommended that the crew exploration vehicle (CEV) lunar surface access module (LSAM) ascent stage propulsion and service module propulsion systems employ a pressure-fed LOX/liquid methane (CH4) engine. \\"Green\\" propellants, such as LOX and liquid methane, offer savings in both performance and safety over equivalently sized hypergolic propulsion systems in spacecraft applications such as ascent engines or service module engines. The mass savings over monomethyl hydrazine (MMH) and nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) were around 1,000 - 2,000 lb (450 ‚Äì 910 kg) for the LSAM ascent module, which was larger than the current design. The thrust levels identified in ESAS were 5,000 - 10,000 lbf (22 - 44 kN) for the ascent engine. To remove key technology risks in the decision for hypergolic or LOX/Methane, the Propulsion and Cryogenics Advanced Development (PCAD) project is being conducted within NASA, led by the Glenn Research Center, for 5,500 lbf (24,500 N) ascent engine technology. Progress The RS-18 rocket engine was tested using LOX and liquid methane under simulated altitude conditions at NASA Johnson Space Center White Sands Test Facility (WSTF). This project is part of NASA's Propulsion and Cryogenics Advanced Development (PCAD) project. Altitude simulation was achieved using the WSTF Large Altitude Simulation System, which provided altitude conditions equivalent up to ‚Äî122,000 ft (~ 37 km). The RS-18 gas spark-torch igniters were designed and supplied by Pratt and Whitney Rocketdyne as part of the LOX/Methane RS-18 test program.

It hosts cultural festivals and performances, such as \\"El Grito de la Independencia\\" and \\"Cinco de Mayo\\" festivities. Architectural authenticity Plaza M√©xico seeks to recreate Mexican regional and national icons. The architecture is based on traditional Mexican towns and contains a variety of Mexican cultural symbols from different eras. The Korean owners hired two Mexican public relations coordinators to select the icons, cultural symbols and events that are portrayed.Clara Ir√°zabal & Macarena G√≥mez-Barris (2008): Bounded Tourism: Immigrant Politics, Consumption, and Traditions at Plaza Mexico, Journal of Tourism and Cultural Change, 5:3, 186-213. The coordinators also selected construction materials to build Plaza M√©xico in order to produce quality and Mexican authenticity. The architectural decorations like the plaza, kiosk, fountains and monuments are similar to those of many Mexican cities. For example, Plaza M√©xico has replicas of the Angel of Independence of M√©xico City and the kiosk of the Z√≥calo of San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato. The plaza was reproduced with characteristics based on the appearance of the Palace of Jalisco at Guadalajara. The plaza‚Äôs pavement is made of adoqu√≠n stone and the benches are made of crafted iron, like the ones found in the provinces of M√©xico. Plaza M√©xico was constructed using materials from M√©xico such as stone from Zacatecas and talavera from Puebla. The mall is physically structured with open streets and a plaza to reconstruct the environment of a traditional Mexican town. \\"Angel of Independence\\" The reproduction of Mexico City‚Äôs Angel of Independence, which symbolizes Mexican nationhood in Mexico, marks the major entrance to Plaza Mexico. This sculpture serves as the master symbol of Plaza Mexico representing its importance in the community. The Angel has already developed some history in Plaza Mexico becoming an important site of congregation for political rallies. For example, during the March and April 2006 student walkouts for US congressional immigration reform proposals, large groups met at the Angel before marching to Los Angeles City Hall. In addition, during the 2006 FIFA World Cup, community members and other visitors gathered in Plaza Mexico to watch the games and after a victory or tie they would congregate around the Angel of Independence. Tourist attraction Many of the visitors consist of immigrant clienteles, some of them are unable to travel to Mexico because they do not have the legal or economic resources. Most of the visitors are of low or middle-low income status and many some of their families are undocumented immigrants and face harsh border conditions. The Plaza also attracts other local and regional visitors. The Plaza also has an altar for the ‚ÄúVirgen de Guadalupe‚Äù frame and the crucified ‚ÄúJesus Christ‚Äù sculpture. The altar is inside a small temple located outside by the plaza. The Plaza sells different types of souvenirs, such as rosaries, crosses, keychains and T-shirts of Virgin reproductions and Mexico flags and colors. Festivities and cultural events The Plaza hosts a number of Mexican festivities and cultural events, such as Mexican folk music, dances, Aztec and Mejica performances, cultural exhibits and other artistic expressions. Some of the traditional celebrations that are celebrated are ‚ÄúCinco de Mayo,‚Äù ‚ÄúEl Grito de la Independencia,‚Äù and Virgin of Guadalupe: ‚ÄúEl dia 12 de deciembre‚Äù.

It was discovered during a study of Japanese cedar trees, with the year of occurrence determined through dendrochronology. A surge in beryllium isotope , detected in Antarctic ice cores, has also been associated with the 774‚Äì775 event. It is known as the Miyake event and it produced the largest and most rapid rise in carbon-14 ever recorded. The event appears to have been global, with the same carbon-14 signal found in tree rings from Germany, Russia, the United States, and New Zealand. The time profile of the carbon-14 spike around 774. The colored dots represent the measurements in Japanese (M12) and German (Oak) trees, while the black lines represent the modeled profile corresponding to the instant production of carbon-14. The signal exhibits a sharp increase of around 1.2% followed by a slow decline (see Figure 1), which is typical for an instant production of carbon-14 in the atmosphere, indicating that the event was short in duration. The globally averaged production of carbon-14 for this event is calculated as . Hypotheses Several possible causes of the event have been considered. The \\"red crucifix\\" recorded by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle was thought to have been a supernova. However, since no supernova remnant has been found for this year, it is interpreted as an aurora borealis. In China, there is only one clear reference to an aurora in the mid-770s, namely the one on 12 January 776. Instead, an anomalous \\"thunderstorm\\" was recorded for 775. The common paradigm is that the event was caused by a solar particle event (SPE), or a consequence of events as often happen, from a very strong solar flare, perhaps the strongest ever known but still within the Sun's abilities. According to a summary of the state of knowledge on radiocarbon dating in 2020, the spike is thought to have been caused by an extreme solar proton event. Another discussed scenario of the event origin, involving a gamma-ray burst, appears unlikely, since the event was also observed in isotopes and . Frequency of similar events The AD 774/5 event in view of , and The event of 774 is the strongest spike over the last 11,000 years in the record of cosmogenic isotopes, but it is not unique. A similar event occurred in 993 or 994, but it was only 60% as strong as well as another event of . Several other events of the same kind are also suspected to have occurred during the Holocene epoch. From these statistics, one may expect that such strong events occur once per tens of millennia, while weaker events may occur once per millennium or even century. The event of 774 did not cause catastrophic consequences for life on Earth, but had it happened in modern times, it might have produced catastrophic damage to modern technology, particularly to communication and space-borne navigation systems. In addition, a solar flare capable of producing the observed isotopic effect would pose considerable risk to astronauts. As of 2017, there is \\"little understanding\\" of past variations because annual-resolution measurements are only available for a few periods (such as 774‚Äì775). In 2017, another \\"extraordinarily large\\" increase (2.0%) has been associated with a 5480 BCE event, but it is not associated with a solar event because of its long duration, but rather to an unusually fast grand minimum of solar activity. In 2019, evidence of another \\"enormous solar storm\\" in around 660 BCE was published, comparable with the 774‚Äì775 and 993 events and likely relevant with the auroral records in Assyrian records. One of the conclusions of the work is that an exclusive reliance on records may lead to underestimation of the number of possibly catastrophic events.

The captain nearly cancelled the flight until arrangements were made for seven more cargo pallets to be added. The aircraft took at approximately 17:00 UTC and arrived in Jeddah a few minutes past 22:00 UTC. The turnaround time would have normally taken an hour and a half, but it took two and a half hours since the cargo pallets had to be loaded after arrival in Jeddah. The aircraft was ready for takeoff at 00:30 UTC, but during the engine start up procedure engine number 4 would not start. Engine number 4 was repaired and the flight took off at 13:48 UTC en route to Kano and was expected at Kano at 18:19 UTC. The captain was not warned about any classified or hazardous material aboard. The flight engineer sensed a strange odor in the cockpit at flight level 35 as the aircraft approached N'Djamena, at about 17:00 UTC. The rest of the crew as well as the ground engineer and the load- master confirmed the smell had persisted for a while. The two passengers traced to odor to pallet 11 and which appeared to be misty. After being handed a fire extinguisher they applied it to the pallet and when they returned they were breathing heavily. Afterwards the smoke evacuation procedure was followed and the smell temporarily ceased. The flight was cleared to descend at 18:00 UTC. Shortly afterwards the master warning followed a minute later by the sound of a fire warning. With smoke entering the cabin, the flight went into a descent of nearly per minute. Control of the pitch trims was lost. The flight engineer started a radio transmission to the airline at 1804:57 UTC that ended suddenly at 1805:04, the same time the cockpit voice recordings stopped. The two survivors both reported that the first explosion tripped the autopilot and the aircraft rocked sharply. The aircraft descended slowly in the grasses but rolled upon contact with the water. The aircraft then exploded a second time and was destroyed.  Probable Cause  According to the accident report: \\"The probable cause of this accident was a heat generating substance that was hidden in a cargo of fabrics inside pallet No. 11 in the cargo compartment of the aircraft. The heat that emanated from the pallet resulted in smoke that caused a major distraction in the cockpit and later caused an explosion which seriously impaired the flight controls of the aircraft.\\" See also *Kano air disaster, a deadly crash of a Boeing 707 operated on behalf of Nigeria Airways ReferencesExternal links * Final Report (Archive) - Nigerian Federal Ministry of Aviation Aviation accidents and incidents in Nigeria Accidents and incidents involving the Boeing 707 Aviation accidents and incidents in 1994 Nigeria Airways accidents and incidents Airliner accidents and incidents caused by in-flight fires 1994 in Nigeria December 1994 events in Africa ","title":"Nigeria Airways Flight 9805"},{"id":"36064799","text":"Heliozela eucarpa is a moth of the Heliozelidae family.

Many Hollands were Earls, Dukes, Knights and Barons in medieval England, and they played significant roles in the struggles for the crown in fourteenth and fifteenth century. Origin and ennoblement The first recorded Holland was Matthew de Holland of Upholland, son of Siward de Longworth 'the Warrior'. Matthew's great-grandson was a knight named Sir Robert de Holland of Upholland. Robert had a son, another Robert, born around 1283, who became a favourite knight of Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster. After fighting for Thomas in the Banastre Rebellion, a civil war started by rival barons, he acquired large plots of land and was created Baron Holand in 1314. He fought with Lancaster against king Edward II of England at the Battle of Boroughbridge in 1322 and after briefly being imprisoned twice and escaping, he continued in rebellion until Queen Isabella's Invasion of England. In 1328 Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster's followers declared Robert a traitor over the events of the Banastre Rebellion more than a decade earlier, and he was taken prisoner and beheaded. Robert's eldest son, Robert, would succeed him as 2nd Baron Holand, and whose 1373 death, after that of his son Robert, his heir was his granddaughter Maud, wife of John Lovel, 5th Baron Lovel. It was the younger sons of the 1st Baron, Thomas Holland and Sir Otho Holland, who gained prominence. Founding of the Order of the Garter Earls of Kent, inherited from the earlier Earls of the royal family, the Royal arms of England with a silver border Thomas Holland, 1st Earl of Kent and his brother, Otho Holland, fought side by side in the Hundred Years' War, against the French. They were both daring commanders of the English army, and both saw intense action at the battles of Caen and Cr√©cy. The brothers later left duty in France and returned home to England, where they became two of the founding knights of the Order of the Garter, which remains England's highest order of chivalry. Thomas married Joan of Kent, daughter of Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent, and granddaughter of king Edward I. Thomas was summoned to Parliament in 1354, thus becoming Baron Holland, of a second creation distinct from that held by his father. Otho died childless in 1359, and Thomas died the next year, but not before being made Earl of Kent in right of his wife, who was Countess of Kent in her own right. Thomas and Joan had two sons who were prominent members of the nobility. Their eldest son, Thomas, inherited the earldom, while John first became Earl of Huntingdon and then Duke of Exeter. Elevation and fall Thomas inherited his father's title of Earl of Kent, becoming the 2nd Earl of Kent, and like his predecessors, Thomas was a keen warrior. When he grew up, he fought in many battles, most notably the Battle of N√°jera, in which he served under his stepfather, Edward, the Black Prince. He became influential in the court of his half-brother, Richard II of England, and like his father became a Knight of the Garter in 1375, dying in 1397. His eldest son Thomas Holland, 3rd Earl of Kent would be created Duke of Surrey months after succeeding his father as reward for his support of Richard II, but with that king's downfall in 1399 he was forced to forfeit the Dukedom. He would join his uncle John and other supporters of Richard in the Epiphany Rising, and was captured and executed in January 1400. He was succeeded by his brother Edmund Holland, 4th Earl of Kent, who became Knight of the Garter in 1403 and was killed fighting for Henry IV at √éle-de-Br√©hat in 1308, without legitimate issue, his heirs being several sisters married into the highest ranks of the English nobility, including both the Lancastrian and York houses that would contest the War of the Roses. Arms of John Holland, 1st Duke of Exeter Arms of the later Holland Dukes of Exeter John Holland, second son of the 1st Earl of Kent also became a Knight of the Garter, in 1383. He was deprived of his lands in 1385 over his murder of the son of the Earl of Stafford, but was restored the next year and married to a cousin of the king, Elizabeth, daughter of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, under whom he would fight in Spain. He was made Earl of Huntingdon in 1388, and as close supporter of his half-brother King Richard, was made Duke of Exeter in 1397. He was stripped of the title in 1399 by his brother- in-law Henry IV of England, and after his participation in the Epiphany Rising was attainted and executed. His eldest surviving son John would be restored to his father's lands and earldom and made Knight of the Garter in 1416 after distinguishing himself at the Battle of Agincourt, and he continued to support the Lancastrian kings, being member of the Privy Council from 1423. The Dukedom of Exeter was returned to the family in 1444 with an elevated precedence falling only behind that of the Duchy of York, and he died in 1447. His son Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter would succeed, and though he married the daughter of Richard, Duke of York, he remained a staunch Lancastrian in the War of the Roses. He was a commander in the Lancastrian victories at Wakefield (1460) and St Albans (1461), before being defeated at Towton and attainted while in exile, and his properties awarded to his wife, the sister of Edward IV, who had separated from Holland. With the Readeption of Henry VI in 1470, Holland was restored to his lands but was again defeated at Barnet, deprived and divorced. He drowned under mysterious circumstances in 1475, his only child having predeceased him.

All 14 crew members survived, while 11 of the 124 passengers died.\\"ASN Aircraft accident Boeing 737-2F9 5N-AUA Kaduna Airport (KAD).\\" Aviation Safety Network. Retrieved on 6 June 2012. Background The aircraft was a Boeing 737-2F9 registered in Nigerian registration code 5N-AUA. The aircraft was equipped with 2 Pratt & Whitney Canada engines. It had its first flight on 14 October 1982. Manufactured in Renton, U.S.A and had a construction number of 22985, it was manufactured on 11 February 1983. The aircraft had the airframe time of 22,375.40 hours. The Captain was a 43 year old Nigerian male with a Nigerian issued Airline Transport Pilot Licence Number 2911 valid until May 1996. He had his command ratings on B-737, Cessna-150 and Piper Aztec. As at the time of the accident, the Commander had a total flying experience of over 6,000 hours of which over 4,000 hours were on type. The Commander was qualified to take the flight. While the First Officer was a 39 year old Nigerian male with a Nigerian issued Commercial Pilot Licence Number 2884 which was valid until midnight of 13 November 1995. His part 2 ratings were Boeing-737 and Boeing-727. The First Officer had a total flying experience of over 5,000 hours out of which 3,000 hours were on type. He was found qualified to take the flight that day. Before the fatal Jos - Kaduna sector, the aircraft had flown from Yola to Jos. The first and third sectors of the flight were flown by the Captain, while the first officer was on the controls for the second sector (KAD -JOS) of the flight. They both had problems with the flight controls in these sectors (aircraft veering to the left or right). The aircraft landed at Yola at 21:00 UTC for a night stop and the crew arrived at their hotel by 22:00 UTC. Accident Flight 357 took off from Yola Airport at 07:30 UTC for Kaduna, carrying 138 people on board with an adequate fuel. The Captain stated that the official crew members were eight in number and the extra six persons were boarded at his discretion and that of the Station Manager. The Estimated Time of Arrival at Kaduna is 07:46 UTC. Kaduna gave Flight 357 an inbound clearance for approach onto runway 05. Though, the initial landing clearance was for runway 05, the Captain requested to land on runway 23. He was reminded by the Air Traffic Controller that the wind was from 090 magnetic, but he still insisted on using the 23 approach. The Captain, therefore, accepted to land with a tailwind. Flight 357 then commenced its initial descent at 07:42 UTC and was cleared to 3.500 ft. It then descended to 500 ft. The crew then tried to align the aircraft with the runway. The First Officer asked the Captain \\"Can you make it to land from that position?\\" An observer in the cockpit also suggested going on the downwind; presumably to re-position the aircraft for landing on runway 05. However, there was no response at all from the Captain and the approach was continued for runway 23. The left turn was very steep and it took the aircraft to the left of the runway centreline and a right correction was applied. The observer had to shout a warning \\"Watch the wing\\" as the wings could have struck the ground on the final approach. The crew were still struggling with the plane's control to align it with the runway. The aircraft touched down at 2020 ft (615.85m) from the end of the paved runway 05 after consuming 79.5% of the runway total length. The Captain was reported to have used 1.8 and 1.6 EPR (Engine Power Ratio) on the reversers. When a runway overrun became inevitable, the Captain turned the aircraft to the left with the intention to take advantage of the last rapid exit intersection to avoid the runway end lights. At this juncture, the aircraft entered an uncontrollable skid. The attendant turning moments inevitably forced the right wing to hit the ground, thus rupturing the fuel tanks and a huge fire erupted. Passengers and crews scrambled and tried to escape the fiery wreckage. 66 people were injured in the crash, 14 of them seriously. 11 passengers on board were killed.

Several factors have been demonstrated to increase the imagination inflation effect. Imagining a false event increases familiarity and people mistake this familiarity for evidence that they have experienced the event. Imagination inflation could also be the result of source confusion or source monitoring errors. When imagining a false event, people generate information about the event that is often stored in their memory. Later, they might remember the content of the memory but not its source and mistakenly attribute the recalled information to a real experience. This effect is relevant to the study of memory and cognition, particularly false memory. Imagination inflation often occurs during attempts to retrieve repressed memories (i.e. via recovered memory therapy) and may lead to the development of false or distorted memories. In criminal justice, imagination inflation is tied to false confessions because police interrogation practices involving suspects to imagine committing or planning the crime in question. Research= Early Research  In 1996, Elizabeth Loftus, Maryanne Garry, Charles Manning, and Steven Sherman, conducted the original imagination inflation study. The study examined the effect of imagining a childhood event on childhood memories. It was the first study to examine the effects of imagining false events on memory in the absence of other factors present in previous studies, such as social pressure. In the study, the act of imagining unexperienced childhood events, such as being rescued by a lifeguard or breaking a window with one's hand, increased confidence that the events had occurred. After people imagined events with low initial confidence ratings (i.e. ones which they originally said they had not experienced) they became more confident that the events took place compared with unimagined ones. Due to the unreliability of memory, it is not possible to be certain whether or not someone has had a given experience based solely self-reports. This leaves open the possibility that imagination does not actually have any effect on beliefs about false past events, but instead helps people retrieve actual memories of true experiences. In 1998, Lyn Goff and Henry Roediger used a different method to study imagination inflation effect for events that could be confirmed. It also looked at the effect of imagination on recognition reports rather than confidence ratings. Participants performed certain actions (such as breaking a toothpick) but not others, then imagined doing other actions in the overall set, and finally were given a list of old actions encountered in the first two parts of the study and brand new actions. Participants were more likely to mistakenly say that they had performed imagined actions compared to unimagined actions.  Further Research  Later studies have used similar methods with a pre-test rating of a series of events, an intervening cognitive task using the events, and a post-test confidence rating. These have shown that a similar imagination inflation effect occurs when instead of imagining, people simply explain how events could have happened or paraphrase them. These findings suggest that vivid imagining is not always necessary for \\"imagination inflation\\" to occur; explanation or paraphrasing may function to make the false event seem more fluent and thus more familiar without producing a detailed image of it. Other research has investigated what types of events can show an imagination inflation effect, often using a method similar to Goff and Roediger's, in which participants perform some actions but not others, then imagine some of them, and later mistakenly believe they have performed imagined actions but not control unimagined ones. One comparison found a similar imagination inflation effect for actions identical to those in Goff and Roediger's study (i.e. \\"break the toothpick\\") and altered, bizarre versions of such actions (i.e. \\"kiss the magnifying glass\\"). Another found an effect when people imagined a highly unusual action such as kissing a vending machine or lying on a couch and talking to Sigmund Freud. Some people have developed false beliefs of having performed bizarre actions or experienced more ordinary events even after imagining somebody else, rather than themselves, performing them. Causes The cause of the imagination inflation effect is debated. There is evidence that source-monitoring framework, the familiarity misattribution theory, and the effects of sensory elaboration contribute to the formation of false memories through imagination inflation. It has been theorized that these effects, and other unknown effects, all contribute to the imagination inflation effect.  Source-monitoring Framework  The source-monitoring framework, developed by Thomas et al., states that past memories are not specified as real or imagined. Thus, under this framework, after imaging an event, it is difficult to distinguish whether the memory is real or not.  Familiarity Misattribution Theory  Under the familiarity misattribution theory, the imagination inflation effect is likely to occur because imagining an event increases familiarity with that event. This familiarity is then misattributed and interpreted as evidence that the event actually occurred.  Sensory Elaboration  Thomas et al. argue that perceptual components of imagining events confuse actual lived memories because of elaboration. When participants included sensory details while recalling imagined events, participants were more likely to falsely remember the imagined events. Participants were thought to confuse imagined events with actual events because of the specific and elaborate nature of their imagination. The results of the study argue that elaboration (in the form of vivid sensory details) leads to increased formation of false memories. Implications= False Confessions  Imagination inflation has implications for the criminal justice system, in particular interrogation and interviewing procedures. Interrogators who ask suspects to repeatedly imagine committing a crime risk making their suspects more confident that they are the perpetrators, ultimately producing false confessions from innocent suspects. In one case in the United States in the 1990s, after an intense police interrogation, a man who initially denied accusations of raping his daughters admitted to crimes that were even denied by his accusers, including abusing his children and leading a satanic cult which sacrificed babies. The psychologist Richard Ofshe argued that the confessions were false memories created by repeated suggestion. In another interrogation technique, interrogators ask suspects to explain how a crime might have been committed or how they themselves could have done it. This practice has been suggested as another cause of self- generated false confessions because it forces an innocent suspect to create a believable narrative of their own guilt. This is supported by research in which people explained how a false childhood event could have occurred, and, after, became more confident that it had really happened. Criticisms=Regression to the mean A 2001 critique argued that the original findings of the 1996 imagination inflation study did not in fact reflect changed beliefs about the past via imagination, but were instead a product of regression to the mean. That is, events with confidence ratings at the extreme (low or high) ends of the scale at the first time of measurement happened to have such scores due only to observational error, so they became more moderate at post-test. The authors of the '96 paper disagreed with this interpretation, pointing out several issues that they found in Pezdek's reasoning. In particular, they agreed that regression to the mean was present in their own data and contributed to the overall changes in confidence at the second test. But this could not explain the finding that imagining events that were low in confidence led to a greater increase in ratings than for unimagined low- confidence events, as regression to the mean should affect all events equally.

Unlike single telescopes or cameras that can compensate the Earth's rotation in real time with a dedicated mount, the different telescopes of the interferometer are at fixed positions on the Earth. As a result, maps obtained with interferometers feature the elongated orthoradial features similar to those of night sky photographs taken with a fixed tripod, unless they use short enough integration times.

It grows to a length of about and is a silvery-cream color, with narrow yellow and blue longitudinal stripes, but can modify its color somewhat to match its surroundings. It is closely related to the blue striped grunt and the French grunt and often schools with these species. It feeds on shrimp, other crustaceans, annelids and mollusks, and is preyed on by larger piscivores such as barracuda and shark. It is sometimes caught by anglers as a game fish and its flaky white flesh can be eaten. It is also a popular aquarium fish. Habitat and distribution The white grunt is found near mangroves, reefs, docks, and nearly any sort of structure in its range, which extends in the Western Atlantic from Chesapeake Bay through the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico down to Brazil. It normally lives in depths similar to that of its relative, the blue striped grunt, from 0-30m in depth. This fish is closely related to the blue striped grunt (Haemulon sciurus) and the French grunt (Haemulon flavolineatum). The white grunt is often seen schooling with those species. The familiar \\"grunt\\" that this fish makes is caused by its pharyngeal teeth grinding in the back of its throat. This sound is normally made when the fish is distressed or in danger, such as when being caught by an angler. Description The white grunt is a silvery cream color with numerous yellow and blue horizontal stripes present throughout the body. The head is long with a distinct snout, and falcate pectoral fins and a forked caudal tail are also present. H. plumieri also has numerous dorsal spines and rough teeth. Unlike groupers or snappers, grunts have a strong fixed lower jawbone. The average size of this fish is six inches to more than a foot, and H. plumieri often changes its color to its direct surroundings, becoming accordingly paler or darker. The white grunt has been observed to reach lengths of over 20 inches and weights upwards of 15 lbs. Diet Although the natural diet of this fish largely consists of shrimp, they also feed upon annelids, crustaceans, and bivalves. Largely opportunistic, anglers have caught them on the whole spectrum of natural and artificial baits. Predators Large species of predatory fish such as barracuda and shark feed upon white grunts, as they are abundant and school in fairly large numbers. Other piscivorous fish such as groupers and snappers also eat H. plumieri. Human uses, commercial and recreational The white grunt has minor importance on the commercial scale, but is somewhat popular with children and beginners as game fish, and even experienced fishermen. Grunts are easy to catch and have white meat that cooks well, so they are sometimes caught to be eaten. A historic Florida dish, \\"Grits and Grunts\\", is traditionally prepared with H.plumieri. They also have bait value for large piscivorous fish. These fish also have high value as aquarium fish, due to their bright colors.

Its three core members consisted of lead singer Teresa Covarrubias, lead guitarist Rudy Medina, and alternate lead and rhythm guitarist Sidney Medina. From their conception in late 1978 to their eventual break-up in 1985, The Brat contributed to the customization and intermeshing of multiple musical and cultural models that culminated in the distinct East Los Angeles, Chican@ punk sound. Along with being pioneers in the East Los Angeles punk movement, they are best known for their five song EP Attitudes ‚Äî released in 1980 through the independent label Fatima Records ‚Äî while contributing to the understanding of the many ways culture transforms and challenges dominant hegemonic ideologies. Early Beginnings Teresa Covarrubias was a Chicana who was born and raised in the Boyle Heights section of East Los Angeles. She attended Boyle heights Elementary School and Resurrection school, Sacred Heart of Jesus High School and studied psychology at California State University, Los Angeles for two years. Musicians such as Bob Dylan, The Rolling Stones, Benny Goodman and David Bowie had a heavy influence on the young musician as they influenced her to seek alternative forms of music that deviated from the mainstream. This drive to seek alternative forms of media was only heightened when her sister returned to her D.I.Y. (Do It Yourself) punk fanzines from Germany ‚Äî immediately attracting her to the underground subculture. Guitarists, Rudy Medina and Sidney Medina (despite being uncle and nephew, were very close in age) lived only a mile away from Teresa in the same section of Los Angeles. Although practically neighbors, the Medinas grew up in a completely different household compared to Teresa. Unlike Teresa who was second generation Chicana, the Medinas were first generation Chicanos whose parents immigrated to the United States through the bracero program. Their parents were extremely traditional and non- English-speaking, maintaining a strong sense of their cultural identity. Both Rudy and Sidney were classically trained musicians specializing in classical guitar and regularly performed as a duet in recitals through a small music and art center targeting low-income families who desired their children to be exposed to musical instruction. Rudy‚Äôs record collection consisted of the usual suspects of the era, heavy on guitar, rock, and iconic legends. But in and amongst the heavy rock were albums by outsiders such as The Clash, David Bowie, The New York Dolls, and Sparks. Rudy eventually studied at California State University Los Angeles, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in music while Sidney, who also attended the university, did not finish. Teresa and Rudy met during the record release show for English punk band The Jam on April 14, 1978 at the Starwood, a nightclub in West Hollywood, California. Their meeting blossomed into friendship and eventual musical collaboration when Teresa replaced Rudy‚Äôs singer, leading to the formation of The Brat. Overview of a Short-Lived Career The group began performing mostly at backyard parties and high school gymnasiums covering past and present top radio hits of their time. They experienced immediate local recognition as they could be regularly spotted playing local backyard shows. However it was extremely difficult to sign under a label and play West Los Angeles venues in a time where the city was still greatly segregated. East Los Angeles was primarily made up of low income, working class poor while West Los Angeles was blooming with the wealthier, affluent middle class and elites where many popular venues were located. Until then there was no official venue for new and upcoming East Los Angeles punk bands to prove their worthiness of mainstream stardom. It was not until March 22, 1980 when the very first venue showcasing East Los Angeles local punk bands was opened by Willie Herron, frontman of another local group, Los Illegals. The Vex (as the venue was named) shared occupancy above the same commercial space of the influential art gallery, Self Help Graphics. Once The Brat began to regularly showcase their music ‚Äî through the Vex and multiple backyard shows in the community instating their presence among local groups such as The Plugz, Los Illegals, Odd Squad, and the Cruzados ‚Äî they landed a record contract with Fatima Records. Tito Larriva of The Plugz and Fatima Records and local business owner Yolanda Comparran championed the band, and, by the end of 1980, chose The Brat to launch their new label. The contract also led to The Brat's first and only release. With Teresa's screaming vocals and Rudy's and Sidney's multidisciplinary guitar, the five song EP was a prime example of customization and transculturation of popular musical genres. Covarrubia's driving vocals of the Mexican American experience with a focus on social and economic inequality engaged in dialogue about the pervasive invisibility and alienation her community ‚Äî including herself ‚Äî faced in East L.A. Other songs contain influences from reggae and other local and influential West Los Angeles punk bands such as X. These themes of the collective experience of struggle between their community within a semi narrative fashion reflected corrido ballads popular in Mexico. The unreleased song, \\"The Wolf\\", engages in the narrative of the struggle of dominant social elites against the popular working poor who maintain their dominance over marginalized communities through violence and neglect of their counter-hegemonic history. Like the corridos of Mexico, The Brat produced their music to express the historical and then contemporary challenges Mexican Americans faced in the United States. Scholar George Lipsitz categorized their music as a \\"historic bloc\\" as it provided counter master narratives challenging dominant hegemonic ideologies in the United States, especially in East Los Angeles. This multiplicity of musical genres that embody the music of The Brat also evidenced its transculturation status as it was a product of customization of Caribbean, Mexican, American and European influences. These processes occurred in areas like East Los Angeles where multiple distinct cultural models were in constant contact with one another. After their release, the group experienced yet another hint of success as their growing popularity pushed them to open for major groups such as R.E.M. and Adam and the Ants. Although their music contained a rich history and formation as the band experienced small-time success, they disbanded in 1985 after the growing frustrations of failing to sign with a major record label and growing apathy towards the scene. Family Resemblance: Impact of Los Angeles Punk as an Agent of Unification As previously mentioned, there existed an East versus West L.A. rivalry that led to the exclusion of many Chican@ punk bands from performing in many of the West Los Angeles clubs. In interviews, Willie Herron and Teresa Covarrubias had expressed that their exclusion was due to a result of stratified boundaries based on geographical location, race, and class. Yet as scholars have mentioned these borders had become blurred and finally unrecognizable. George LItpitz discusses how at times, certain elements and themes of a particular cultural structure can sometimes reflect that of another distinct cultural group. These somewhat similar experiences or cultural memories are what he defines as \\"family resemblance\\" to explain intercultural relations. In this case, West L.A. punk was primarily composed of children of elites who deviated from their status quo, privileged positions and undertook a process of self-marginalization and isolation resulting from their growing discontent of mainstream society. Experience of self-exclusion and isolation represented itself in the music produced by West L.A. punks whereas music produced in the Eastern half of Los Angeles similarly echoed experiences and memories of anger and discontent towards the isolation and marginalization that dominant society imposed onto them. Another very important aspect of the common resemblance both groups shared was their gravitation to the D.I.Y. subcultural ethic that punk centralized. This hands on approach to music, art, and community attracted many musicians from the West and East side ‚Äî like Teresa Covarrubias ‚Äî towards punk. Their similar hands on approach with their community constructed similar experiences had by these individuals and eventually created what many scholars would call an imaginary community that crossed multiple boundaries of identity . The common experience of oppression, marginalization and isolation and the focus of the D.I.Y. ethic led to cross cultural similarities that ultimately united both groups who had originated from very distinct class, racial, and geographical backgrounds.

BLM depends on the site-specific water quality including such parameters as pH, hardness, and dissolved organic carbon. In this model, lethal accumulation values (accumulation of metal on the gill surface, in the case of fish, that cause mortality in 50% of the population) are used to be predictive of lethal concentration values that are more universal for aquatic toxicology and the development of standards. Collection of water chemistry parameters for a given site, incorporation of the data into the BLM computer model and analysis of the output data is used to accomplish BLM analysis. Comparison of these values derived from the model, have repeatedly been found to be comparable to the results of lethal tissue concentrations from acute toxicity tests. The BLM was developed from the gill surface interaction model (GSIM) and the free ion activity model (FIAM). Both of these models also address how metals interact with organisms and aquatic environments. Currently, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) uses the BLM as a tool to outline Ambient Water Quality Criteria (AWQC) for surface water. Because BLM is so useful for investigation of metals in surface water, there are developmental plans to expand BLM for use in marine and estuarine environments. History Current knowledge of how specific water quality parameters alter the toxicity of metals to aquatic life is still growing. In 1973, Zitko et al. provided evidence that the free metal ion played a stronger role in determining toxicity than did the metals overall concentration. Shortly after, in 1976, Zitko et al. established that Ca2+ and Mg2+ (hardness cations) were in competition with metal ions at the binding sites of the metals. This competition at the binding site resulted in lower toxicity of metals as the hardness of the water they were in increased. Pagenkopf et al. used a chemical equilibrium model to explain how water chemistry will control which form of a metal is present and how that was related to the metal's toxicity. Both of these findings helped establish that metal toxicity and availability is directly related to the free ion activity of the metal. This led to the development of what is now called the free-ion activity model (FIAM). The FIAM describes effects of metals based on metal speciation and their subsequent interactions with organisms. The free ion activity model was created to explain original observations about behaviors of metals in aquatic organisms and to examine the ‚Äúuniversal importance of free metal ion activities in determining the uptake, nutrition and toxicity cationic trace metals‚Äù. It is now known that aqueous concentrations of metals are poor predictors of the bioavailability of a particular metal. Further, as the biotic ligand model addresses, the binding of trace metal to a site is not only dependent on the concentration of the metal in question. Parent et al. describe cell surface interactions according to the FIAM by saying that the biological response that is elicited is the result of the concentration of cell surface complexes, either metal or metal ligand. The original FIAM did not address other roles that ligands play besides complexing metals and how these other roles could affect the biological response of an organism. Around the same time that the free ion activity model was proposed, the gill surface interaction model (GSIM) was introduced by Pagenkopf in 1983. The model was put into use in order to evaluate toxicity test results of metals as well as metals in mixtures. Pagennkopf outlined that the compilation of previous studies on metals necessitated further examination of how metal toxicity changes as a function of pH, hardness and complexation capacity for the toxicity of metals to fishes. In the gill surface interaction model both metal hardness and complexation are included. Pagenkopf lays out several major concepts that are the basis of the GSIM. # Trace metals alter gill function in fish (acutely) and the fish die as a result of respiratory failure. # Some trace metal species are significantly more toxic than others. # Gill surfaces can form complexes with the metal species and hydrogen ions that are present in the water. # Metal exchange between the gills and test waters are fast when compared to the time needed to perform a bioassay. # Gill surfaces have a determinate interaction capacity per unit weight. # Competitive inhibition occurs between the calcium and magnesium and the toxicants which include trace-metals and hydrogen ions . Using these six concepts Pagenkopf looked at copper, zinc, cadmium, lead, combinations of metals, and hydrogen ion concentration using effective toxicant concentration. Per the results Pagenkopf assessed the applicability of the model and came up with several steps to using the GSIM. The required data are pH, alkalinity, hardness and total trace-metal content of a water sample. Once these parameters are obtained, the next step is to calculate the speciation of the metals in the water sample. Then look at the competitive interaction factor (CIF) and the effective toxicant concentration (ETC) of the metals‚Äîthen effective toxicant concentration is compared to laboratory observations. The limitations of the FIAM and GSIM were important in the genesis of the BLM and both the FIAM and the GSIM led to the development of the biotic ligand model. Quantitative Information The BLM is used to predict the lethal accumulation (LA50) of metals on the gill surface that results in mortality of 50% of the exposed individuals. Accumulation of metals on the gill surface is dependent on the specific area's water quality as the metal's bioavailability for binding with the ligand will be determined by what's in the water that the metal is likely to complex to other than the ligand on the gill surface of the fish. There are ten major inputs of water quality that the EPA recommends should be put into the Biotic Ligand Model to produce an estimation of the area's water quality. Two additional inputs (percent humic acid and sulfide) may also be used in some cases, though the EPA has cautioned against their extensive use due to their minimal effect and inconsistent reporting in scientific documents. Temperature of the water is one factor for consideration in the BLM, though it's been found to have a lesser effect than some of the other parameters. With respect to BLM, pH can have a large effect on the metal's ability to bind to the biotic ligand. Higher pH will decrease the metal's toxicity as the metal (in the case of copper) will complex more readily with carbonate and other organics that are dissolved in the water. With increasing pH, fewer protons are available to compete for a spot on the biotic ligand, so looking at this factor alone, it would seem that increasing pH would increase the metal's toxicity as it would have less competition for a binding site. However, the complexation effect that increasing pH has on the metal makes it less bioavailable for binding to the biotic ligand. Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) is another important factor among the BLM inputs. Increasing dissolved organic carbon decreases the metal's toxicity as the metal will bind with the dissolved organic carbon, making it less bioavailable for uptake by the biotic ligand. The major cations that have been found to have a significant impact on BLM are Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and K+. Major anions, including SO4‚àí and Cl‚àí also may be responsible for changing the metal's binding affinity for the biotic ligand. Alkalinity has a lesser effect on the BLM partitioning coefficients than do DOC and pH. Partitioning coefficients are used to determine the binding affinity of the metal to the biotic ligand. These coefficients are produced by the BLM following input from the above parameters. Limitations/Uncertainty The Biotic Ligand model has several limitations and uncertainties. These uncertainties are important to address when utilizing the BLM for management of water resources. Water quality standards are based on total or dissolved metal concentrations. Water quality criteria are often derived using extrapolations from lab tests and data. Data is derived from lab tests using standardized laboratory methods and is generally not representative of the dynamic environmental conditions experienced in the field over a broad range of species. Types of Biotic Ligand Models=EPA's Biotic Ligand Model and Water Quality Criteria Section 304(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) requires that ‚Äúthe Administrator,‚Äù or Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, develop a water quality criteria that is based on current scientific information and judgment, data, contaminant concentrations, and the protection of human health and the environment. Water quality criteria are one of the goals of the EPA's Water Quality Standards (WQS) under the CWA. WQS are set by each state and determine the quality of specific water bodies based on its designated use, WQC, and anti-degradation policies. As of 2007 the EPA accepts use of BLM to help produce site specific freshwater WQC values for copper. The inputs for this model are: temperature, aquatic cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and K+), aquatic anions (Cl‚àí and SO42‚àí), sulfide, pH, alkalinity, and DOC. The EPA has a working version of their BLM on their website. HydroQual/Windward BLM The BLM was originally developed by researchers at HydroQual Inc. The BLM software (up to version 2.2.3) was available at the HydroQual website for zinc, copper, lead, silver, and cadmium for aquatic freshwater systems only, although marine models were in the works. The HydroQual team also developed the BLM software distributed by US EPA. HydroQual was a privately owned science, research, and engineering company founded in 1980. In 2010, HydroQual was purchased by HDR Inc and the HydroQual website, including the BLM pages, have been retired. The research team at HydroQual that worked on the BLM have moved to Windward Environmental where a new BLM website is maintained. Current and Future Studies Currently, the EPA recognizes the use of the BLM in the identification and cleanup of copper. This is because of the extensive characterization and testing performed using copper to predict toxic outcomes of metal exposure in various environmental conditions (pH, DOC, temperature, etc.) . Another version of the BLM is underway by HydroQual who is in the processes of developing the TBLM with Copper and Nickel for predicting metal effects in soil. The future characterization of metals for the BLM like Ag, Zn, Pb, Al, Ni, and Cd on aquatic systems and organisms will help develop the BLM for a broader range of metals for which it can be certain to predict and assess potential impacts. The BLM is limited as it is only a predictive tool, but it has useful applications in aquatic toxicology.

It supports the three major operating systems: Windows, Linux and Mac OS X by using the PHP language. Applications are written in PHP language, and since it is an interpreted language, it does not require an intermediate compilation step in order to run the application, provided the PHP interpreter has the extension available. History Near 2003, a group of enthusiastic people started writing on mailing lists and forums presenting the idea of a PHP extension that wrapped the wxWidgets library in a similar way that PHP-GTK does for GTK+. A SourceForge project was created and many people joined in an effort to move the cause forward and make it a reality. Despite the will of project members, the same wasn't going anywhere until M√°rio Soares decided to join in. After the join, the first commits were done to the CVS repository on sourceforge. The first commits consisted of wrapping the wxApp class, wxFrame and some other basic controls, this is when wxPHP first saw the light. Inspired on wrapper generators like SWIG, development was started for a simple code generator that read the output of GCCXML ran over wxWidgets and transformed into a serialized PHP array. This helped save a lot of time on the monotonous task of writing the same code again and again for each class and its methods. After having some basic functionality and controls, an application was written using wxPHP itself, to assist the code generator on the selection of class methods that it could handle correctly. In August 2011 Jefferson Gonz√°lez wrote an email to current maintainer offering to make a website in order to boost wxPHP presence as attract more people and contributors. When the website was up and running, he started playing with the wxPHP sources. Later, decided to enable more methods and classes, discovering on the way that many features weren't supported by the code generator and extension itself. After several emails previous developer came with the idea of parsing the XML output generated by Doxygen from the wxWidget documentation. He took the task granted and started improving the code generator until it was re-written, adding lacking documentation and many features that would enable adding more wxWidgets functionality. Present wxPHP now supports around 400 wxWidgets classes and thousands of methods, making it pretty usable to develop a desktop commercial application. The project source code is now hosted on GitHub. A reference generator was written that serves as the documentation of the functionality supported by the wxPHP extension. Also an interface generator has been written in order to get code completion on IDE's like NetBeans and Eclipse. Planning is undergoing to re- write the code generator yet again using a modular and object oriented approach that permits other people to use it to generate code for other PHP wrappers. GUI Designer Support for PHP code generation was added to wxFormBuilder in order to easily create applications, and get people not familiar to the library to get up to speed on learning it.

It is an eco-toxicological tool that approaches community tolerance to pollution from a holistic standpoint. Community Tolerance can increase in one of three ways: physical adaptations or phenotypic plasticity, selection of favorable genotypes, and the replacement of sensitive species by tolerant species in a community. PICT differs from the population tolerance approach to community tolerance in that it can be easily applied to any ecosystem and it is not critical to use a representative test organism, as with the population tolerance approach. Community tolerance Community tolerance can be used as indicator for determining if a toxicant has a disturbance on an exposed community for multiple types of organisms. Tolerance of a toxicant can increase by three ways: physiological adaptation, also known as the phenotypic plasticity of an individual; tolerant genotypes selected within a population over time; and the replacement of species with more tolerant ones within a community. Physiological adaptation, or phenotypic plasticity, is the ability of an individual organism to change its phenotype in response to changes in the environment.Miner, Benjamin G., Sonia E. Sultan, Steven G. Morgan, Dianna K. Padilla, and Rick A. Relyea. 12 December 2005. \\"Ecological Consequences of Phenotypic Plasticity.\\" Elsevier. Trends in Ecology and Evolution. 20 (12): 685‚Äì692). http://bama.ua.edu/~rlearley/Miner_2005.pdf. This can occur with huge variance between the type of organism and the type of the disturbance they experience. Natural selection that occurs over several generations causes an entire population to exhibit specific selection of genotypes.Darwin, Charles. 1859. \\"Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life.\\" London: John Murray. 1st Edition. http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytint/docs/charles- darwin-on-the-origin-of-species/original.pdf Over time, tolerant genotypes can be selected over non-tolerant ones and can cause a shift in a population‚Äôs genome.Blanck, Hans. 22 September 2010. ‚ÄúA Critical Review of Procedures and Approaches Used for Assessing Pollution-Induced Community Tolerance (PICT) in Biotic Communities, Human and Ecological Risk Assessment.‚Äù Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: An International Journal. 8 (5): 1003‚Äì1034. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1080-700291905792. Natural selection can also cause a replacement of less tolerant species with more tolerant species. All of these aspects can alter a community's structure drastically, and if a toxicant can be identified as the culprit, action can take place to prevent that toxicant from further accumulating. PICT can be used for linkage between cause and effect of the toxicants due to the structure of a community that has survived the event, also known as toxicant- induced succession (TIS). Toxicant-induced succession would be the development of more tolerant generations once a chemical was introduced into the environment. There are two types of tolerances that can occur: multiple and co-tolerance. Multiple tolerances can elevate an individual' ability to tolerate several toxicants present at once. This means that the type of chemicals present in the environment, the concentration, and the organisms that are affected could alter the environment in multiple different ways. Co- tolerance is the ability of an organism to develop a tolerance to a certain toxicant in short-term tests, and obtain that tolerance for other toxicants similar to the first. It can be difficult to determine which type of tolerance is occurring if there are multiple types of toxicants in a community because they could be acting simultaneously. Basically it is difficult to understand what exactly may be going on in a community without testing it with multiple ecotoxicological tools with long- and short-term toxicity tests. Field studies Assessing pollution-induced community tolerance can be done utilizing in situ techniques, many of which involve the use of known or created chemical exposure gradients. One example is the use of a known concentration gradient of Tri-n-butylin to assess PICT in periphyton. Tolerance patterns showed that tolerance was highest closest to the marina that was the source of contamination. The use of reference sites in addition to contaminated sites is also commonly used for translocation assessments of PICT. A study in Germany cultured periphyton on glass discs in two river systems north of Leipzig, Germany. One system was the contaminated area of study and the other was 10 km upstream and uncontaminated, intended to be used as a reference. After the colonization period, 6 of the 10 racks of glass discs were trans-located to the other river system. During the experiment the community structure present on the glass discs from the reference site, when translocated to the contaminated site changed to mirror that of the control discs that were left in the contaminated sites. In another study in Denmark, enclosure experiments were done allowing for an assessment of PICT utilizing the lake water from Lake Bure as a baseline. By using this water from the lake potentially confounding variables would be nullified by comparing results to the control. Concentrations of atrazine and copper were added to these enclosures in varying concentrations. As in other experiments previously discussed periphyton communities were used in this experiment and were cultured using glass discs. Photosynthetic activity was measured and used as a measurement of PICT throughout the experiment. The experiment showed that elevated levels of Cu lead to community tolerance of the phytoplankton community as well as co-tolerance of zinc. Total Biomass decreased at the outset of the trials involving high concentrations of Cu indicating that Community Tolerance was increased due to direct mortality of the sensitive species. The use of PICT in an in situ fashion is not limited to aquatic systems. A study involving 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene utilized respirometric techniques to measure Pollution-Induced Community Tolerance in soil microbial communities in response to the presence of TNT. The results of this study further corroborate the PICT Theory, in that treatments with long-term exposure to TNT had a larger proportion of TNT-resistant bacteria than soils with low levels of TNT. This PICT caused by TNT was also present in another study. Ideally, pollution-induced community tolerance can be assessed in the field by using a representative sample of the natural community in response to environmental contamination. However, this is not always the case, which is why laboratory studies are necessary supplements to properly assess PICT. Lab studies The laboratory investigation of PICT is necessary to eliminate factors other than pollution that may affect community structure. It can be conducted in conjunction with field work, as in the study by Blanck and Dahl (1996). In this study, the results from laboratory acute toxicity tests of TBT on periphyton corroborated the results from the field study, supporting the conclusion that toxicity to periphyton resulted from TBT pollution at the site under investigation. The results from acute toxicity tests can thus help determine whether the effect identified is due to a specific contaminant. There are a variety of methods for laboratory testing, but a general format includes sampling, a bioassay, and an analysis of community structure. Samples can be collected on artificial or natural substrata, either in situ or in the laboratory.Blanck, Hans. 1985. ‚ÄúA simple, community level, ecotoxicological test system using samples of periphyton‚Äù. Hydrobiologia. 124: 251‚Äì261. There must be a series of samples exposed to different concentrations of contaminant and a control sample. In situ sampling involves setting up a sampling device in an aquatic ecosystem and allowing it to colonize for some time (e.g. a couple of weeks). One example is the diatometer, a device that is deployed in the water that becomes colonized by diatoms, and then is removed for analysis.‚ÄúTools of a Scientist‚Äù. Urban Rivers Awareness. 2004. In situ sampling devices are set up at increasing distances from the pollution source in the case of point source pollution. The samples thus represent a gradient in contaminant concentration, assuming that the contaminant becomes more dilute with increasing distance from the point source. An example of laboratory sampling was used in a study by Schmitt-Jansen and Altenburger (2005). For 14 days communities were allowed to establish on discs set up in laboratory aquariums which were continuously mixed and inoculated with algae from a pond. The aquariums were dosed with different concentrations of herbicide to get a gradient of long-term (14-day) contaminant exposures. Once a week the aquarium water was completely replaced and re-dosed with herbicide. A bioassay is conducted on the samples to test for correlation between tolerance and long-term contaminant exposure. First, samples are exposed to different concentrations of contaminant. Then an endpoint is measured to determine the toxic effect on the sample organisms. The results from these measurements are used to produce an EC50. Both Blanck (1996) and Schmitt- Jansen and Altenburger (2005) photosynthesis as their endpoint. Community structure of the samples is analyzed to check for a correlation between species prevalence and long-term contaminant exposure. Samples are taxonomically classified to determine the composition and species diversity of the communities that established over the long term exposures. The results are compared to the concentration of contaminant in the long-term exposure to conclude if a relationship was found in the study.

History Volterra still lacked a proper indoor performance stage in the early nineteenth century. In 1816 a group of citizens, including cavaliere Bartolommeo Falchi, cavaliere Mario Maffei, Luigi Ducci, Francesco Cinci, and Luigi Campani, commissioned the architect Luigi Campani (an architect of the Grand Duke Ferdinand III of Tuscany). The theater was erected on the site of the palazzo belonging to Marchesi Incontri. Work began in 1816 and the theater was inaugurated in 1820. Description The main curtain (sipario) was painted by Nicola Contestabili, who represented Aulus Persius Flaccus, a Roman satirist and playwright born in Volerra, being led by the muses to the summit of Parnassus, ruled by Apollo. This gave the theater its final name. The ceiling over the seats was painted with Venus in a chariot drawn by swans, and the parapets, with cupids, garlands and vignettes, harmonizing with the curtain. All these beautiful decorations were lost with subsequent restorations. Ongoing care In 1820, a group of 60 prominent citizens formed the Academy of the Riuniti (of the reunited), and purchased the entire theater, assigning to each member property of the individual boxes and seats, and this organization has continuously maintained that theatrical activity. The theater was closed for physical repairs for 15 years, from 1984 to 1999, before the reopening, members donated their ownerships of seats and boxes to the Academy. This availed them of funds to pursue reconstruction.

It now serves as the chapel of the Civic Hospital of Venice.  History  By 1224, a hospital for lepers, dedicated to St Lazarus, patron saint of those afflicted with the disease, was found adjacent to the church of San Trovaso in the sestiere of Dorsoduro. In 1262, a Leper Colony was quarantined to an island in the Lagoon, then called Isola di San Lazzaro. In 1500, funds left over after the construction of the Basilica of Santi Giovanni e Paolo, were allocated to build an adjacent leper Hospital of San Lazaro, Ospedale di San Lazaro e dei Mendicanti. It was one of the four main hospitals (Ospedali Grandi) in Venice. The term Mendicanti could be derived from two sources: first in 1601, the Mendicant Friars commissioned building of this church from the architect Vincenzo Scamozzi. Second, the hospital appears to have served as a shelter for beggars (mendicanti), as well as lepers. The father of Antonio Vivaldi taught violin at the music school here from 1689 to 1693. Like the Ospedale della Piet√†, it took in abandoned girls who studied music and were trained to sing and play. The church still has a metal grille behind which the orphan girls (figlie del coro in Italian) sang. For this church, the composer Simon Mayr wrote the oratorios Sisara (based on story of Sisera 1793), Tobiae matrimonium (1794) and David in spelunca Engaddi (1795).  Description  Completed by 1631, the nave has no flanking aisles, but does have choir galleries. Scamozzi also designed the cloister of the adjacent hospital. The canal-facing facade, designed by Antonio Sardi, was not completed until 1673 by his son Giuseppe. The south side of the bell-tower has a sundial. In the interior, the right wall, is a Crucifixion and Virgin and St John by Veronese, and in the second altar is a Saint Ursula and the 11 thousand Virgins by Tintoretto. The church contains the ornate funeral monument, completed by Sardi, and dedicated to the condottiero Alvise Mocenigo, represented as the admiral who died defending the then-Venetian Candia (Crete) from the Ottomans in 1654. Other funeral monuments were designed by Baldassare Longhena. The church also has a funeral monument for a member of the Rezzonico family. The interior decoration (1634‚Äì37) was designed by Francesco Contin.

The store is more than forty years old, the oldest and largest store of its kind in the United States. It sells snakes, lizards, various other reptiles and amphibians, as well as the supplies to maintain and care for them. The store is open to reptile enthusiasts, hobbyists, and the general public. The store has been deemed a \\"must-see\\" by Disney family and the \\"strangest attraction\\" in Berkeley by The New York Times. History The vivarium was owned by Ron Cauble. He opened the business in his basement in Oakland, California in 1970. The first storefront was located on Mac Arthur Blvd. in Oakland, then in 1979 he moved the store to an storefront in the Emeryville Market in Emeryville. In 1988, he sold the store and opened The Bone Room in Albany. In 1989, the building was damaged during the Loma Prieta earthquake. The damage was so bad that the store had to move. The insurance company denied the damage claim allowing the store to move. The owners had to pay $10,000 to break out of their lease. Upon moving to their current location on Fifth Street in Berkeley, they made efforts to stabilize the store to avoid future earthquake damage by having shatterproof plastic cages and attaching the shelves, via straps, to the walls. The Fifth Street location is . The front is the store and the back, which is closed to the public, is the breeding center. As of 2001, Cliff Moser and Owen Maercks co-owned the vivarium. In 2008, parking concerns threatened to close the vivarium. Owen Maercks spoke at a zoning board meeting, protesting the building of a 22-unit, three-story building, which would be next to the vivarium and cause a loss of parking. The vivarium only offers approximately five parking spaces to visitors. That same year, The New York Times called the vivarium and Moe's Books the only two \\"must-see\\" sites in Berkeley. Animals and breeding The store carries between 5,000 and 8,000 pets for sale during any given time. They sell animals such as spiders, fish, snakes, lizards, chameleons, frogs, crawfish, and turtles. Specific breeds include rattlesnakes, iguanas, reticulated pythons, tarantulas, Burmese pythons and box turtles. They breed the majority of their stock in a back room. Prices range from $3.50 for a tree frog and $25 to $50 for a snake, to a Chinese crocodile lizard that costs $1,000. They sell snakes that are venomous to small amphibians, not necessarily people; snakes venomous to people are illegal to sell in California. The vivarium also breeds crickets, rats and mice for food in a specific private space on the premises. They also sell rabbits, hamsters, guinea pigs, and chickens for food. Customers can also pay a small fee to pet animals in the store. Outreach The vivarium has an outreach program that goes to Northern California clubs, schools and museums. Animals such as giant boa constrictors and a monitor lizard may appear at an event. They also offer free materials on how to care for the animals they sell.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. The building no longer functions as a library; since 1992 it houses the Prairie Arts Council, a local performing arts organization. Built in 1904‚Äì1905, the library is a one-story masonry building on a raised basement. The basement is about above grade and below. The height of the main story creates the impression of a two or three story structure. The building is roughly square with a projecting entry bay centered in the main facade. The cubical massing is emphasized by the monopitch roof, which slopes to the rear (northeast). The roof is masked by a balustrade. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. All exterior elevations are of \\"Hobart\\" buff face brick laid in common bond with dressed limestone detailing. The central entry bay is flanked by large windows on either side. A flight of stairs leads to main entry. Entry level is halfway between the primary floor level and grade level. The entry is defined by a broken pediment supported by fluted console scroll brackets, all of limestone. Flanking the entry is a stone water table on which rest small, narrow windows. A frieze has raised Roman lettering stating \\"MDCCC PUBLIC LIBRARY 01111\\". Above this is a full pediment with stone raking cornices. An oculus with stone garland surround is centered in the brick tympanum. The bays flanking the entry projection have paired double hung three over one sash with heavy stone lintels at the basement level. Above this runs a plain water table. Large paired one over one windows with stone tablets below each window mark the primary level. Above each window pair are continuous transoms having classical criss-cross fretwork muntins. Each paired window opening is surmounted by a limestone flat arch with radiating voussoirs. The entablature consists of a stone architrave, plain brick frieze, and limestone cornice. A brick parapet with stone coping masks the roofline. Set into the parapet and centered over the double windows below are stone panels repeating the fretwork of the transoms. The cornerstone of the building is located at the southwest corner. It reads \\"LAID July 13.A.L.5904 A.D.1904. BY GRAND MASTER OF INDIANA. WITH THE AID OF PRAIRIE LODGE No. 125 F.& A.M. C.R. WEATHERHOGG ARCHITECT.\\" The side elevations of the library both have three bays of fenestration detailed identically to the flanking bays of the main facade. The basement windows at the northeast corner of the side elevation have been infilled with brick. The rear elevation is similar to the side elevations, however, the rear roof line lacks the parapet and has a single chimney stack. The basement window located toward the northeast corner has been bricked off as well. Near the center of the basement level, a small wood frame vestibule has been added to shelter a basement level entry. Interior A foyer with stairs is just inside the main door. This tall space leads down to the basement on the left, and up to the main level on the right. Oak woodwork in the foyer remains intact, including wainscoting, paneling, and a purely decorative stair rail. The stair rail has paneled newels and turned balusters. Door and window surrounds have beaded vertical boards and entablature headers. Only the window moldings have been maintained from the original. Most of the original built-in bookcases remain, as do window and door surrounds. Suspended fluorescent lighting and acoustical ceiling tiles have been added. The stained glass skylight was removed. Architecturally, Rensselaer Library is a good example of a Carnegie library building. Prominent Fort Wayne architect Charles Weatherhogg designed the building, which is among the best examples of Neo-Classical Revival architecture in Rensselaer.

Stationary houses of Irmen people were large, sometimes exceeding . Villages had several such large dwellings. Next to houses were found large deposits of ash. Archeology Irmen people buried their deceased by inhumation in kurgan cemeteries, with up to 17 predominantly oriented SW graves in a single kurgan, bodies in crouched position, except when inhumation was conducted after ground thawed or bodies were first exposed, and bone remains were mixed. Kurgans were encircled by sometimes rectangular trenches open at the entrance, deposits include vessels and animal bones of funeral feasts.

Juan was a soldier, diplomat and a worker for the Spanish state. He is best known for being the first Count of Mayalde and count consort of Ficalho (in Portugal). Biography=Family Origins and Early Life Juan was the third son of Francisco de Borja, a Catholic saint and the 4th Duke of Gand√≠a and his wife, Leonor de Castro. He was born accidentally in Bellpuig as his father was assisting at the courts Monz√≥n as the head caballerizo representing Carlos I at the time. Between 1539 and 1543, he lived with family members in Barcelona, coinciding with his father's stint as Viceroy of Catalonia. He later moved to Gand√≠a when his father was named the duke. Juan was educated amongst the Jesuits at the Universidad de Gand√≠a. In 1548, he was admitted into the Order of Santiago, which was by this time under the direct control of the Spanish monarchy. After the death of his mother in 1546, from 1550-51, he accompanied his father to Rome, where he was going to join a company. The pair returned to O√±ati, from where Juan then proceeded to attend the prestigious University of Alcal√°. Diplomat and Soldier After entering the service of Philip II of Spain as a staff member for Prince Carlos, he became a soldier at Gipuzkoa, where under the command of the contemporary Viceroy of Navarre, Vespasiano I Gonzaga, he took part in the defense of the province against the French during the Italian Wars. His diplomatic career began in 1569 when he was sent to Portugal as a substitute for the ambassador Fernando Carrillo Mu√±iz de Godoy y Valenzuela. There he worked as an intermediary between the court of Sebastian of Portugal with Margaret of Valois. He also failed in dissuading the Portuguese king to undertake his expedition to Africa which occurred in 1578 with predictably disastrous results. In 1576, he went to Prague as the Spanish ambassador to Emperor Rudolph II of the Holy Roman Empire. He maintained this position until 1581, the same year in which he published his only known literary work, \\"Empresas Morales\\".Empresas morales (Rafael Garc√≠a Mah√≠ques edition, ) At the Spanish court After returning to Spain, he was named head majordomo of Mar√≠a de Austria, a charge he would maintain until 1603. As recognition for his services to the state, Phillip II granted him the title of Count of Mayalde. During the reign of Philip III of Spain, he developed a relationship with the Duke of Lerma, who was his nephew. He was there named Count of Ficalho and president of the Council of Portugal, and he was added to the Spanish Council of State.Miquel Batllori, La familia de los Borjas (), pp. 75-76 Death and Legacy Cross of the Order of Santiago. Juan died at the age of 73 in September 1606, the victim of an accident which occurred when the litter basket in which he was carried, due to his suffering from gout, fell down a staircase at El Escorial. His body was initially buried at the Colegio Imperial de Madrid until 1613, when it was transferred to the Church of Saint Roch in Lisbon, Portugal.Luis Cabrera de C√≥rdoba, Relaciones de las cosas sucedidas en la corte de Espa√±a, desde 1599 hasta 1614, pp. 269, 287-288 Marriage and Descendants In 1552, Juan returned to Gandia and married Lorenza de O√±az y Loyola, the niece of Ignatius of Loyola.

Al-Qubeir is described as a Sunni farming settlement surrounded by Alawite villages in the central province of Hama. According to preliminary evidence, troops had surrounded the village which was followed by pro-government Shabiha militia entering the village and killing civilians with \\"barbarity,\\" UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the UN Security Council.Gun battles rage in streets of Damascus ‚Äì Middle East. Al Jazeera English (8 June 2012). Retrieved on 10 June 2012. Activists, and witnesses stated that scores of civilians, including children, had been killed by Shabiha militia and security forces, while the Syrian government said that nine people had been killed by \\"terrorists\\". It was further claimed by the Syrian National Council that 35 of the people killed were from the same Al Yatim family and more than half of them were women and children.  Events  Activists reported that the village was initially shelled by the security forces, before the Shabiha moved in to kill by shooting at close range and by stabbing. A government statement, reported by Syrian state TV, denied responsibility: \\"What a few media have reported on what happened in Al-Qubeir, in the Hama region, is completely false.\\" State TV had previously stated that the security forces were engaged in an assault on an \\"armed terrorist stronghold\\" in the village. At the time that the reports were issued, the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations were unable to verify the reports ‚Äì monitors stated they would be heading to the area to investigate \\"as soon as dawn breaks\\". Later, the head of the UN observer mission said that Syrian government soldiers prevented the observers from entering the village. Ban Ki Moon told the UN General Assembly that observers attempting to reach the site of the massacre were shot at with light arms. The UN monitors eventually reached the village on 8 June 2012. BBC journalist Paul Danahar, travelling with the UN, spoke of the stench of burnt flesh and blood-splattered buildings. The UN observers did not find bodies. Local people told them that after the Alawite militia had carried out the massacre others had arrived and taken the bodies away. The Syrian Government appointed its own commission to investigate, but the commission head, Talal Houshan, defected to the opposition, accusing the regime and Shabiha of murdering women and children in a video posted on YouTube.  Casualty estimates  Casualty estimates vary. In an early report activists stated that at least 78 people were killed, including children. The opposition said that 100 people had been killed in the massacre; Syrian National Council spokesperson Mohammed Sermini said, \\"We have 100 deaths in the village of Al-Qubeir, among them 20 women and 20 children.\\" The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimated the number of dead to be 87. Two days later, the SNC revised their death toll to 78, while SOHR revised it to at least 55. Syrian state media gave a figure of nine. When describing the massacre, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon reported how some of the victims were burned, while others were slashed with knives.  Reactions = Domestic  * ‚Äì Syria's Permanent Representative to the UN, Dr. Bashar Jaafari, emphasized that the Syrian government is ready to do everything in its power to make the mission of the UN envoy a success, indicating that Syria has offered all necessary facilitations for Annan's plan and the UN observer mission. He further said that killing innocent civilians in Al-Qubeir took place five hours before any clashes happened, adding that the images broadcast by al Jazeera and al Arabia are not those of the massacre victims. The Syrian government blamed \\"terrorists\\" for the massacre.  International  * ‚Äì Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the reported massacre as \\"shocking and sickening\\", and an \\"unspeakable barbarity\\". He stated that the Assad government had \\"lost its fundamental humanity\\" and no longer has any legitimacy. * ‚Äì High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton condemned the attacks.

His studies on US Latinos and contemporary Chilean culture ‚Äúparticipate in an effort to rethink Latin/o American Studies in a global framework. That is to say, capable of encompassing Latin America and the United States from interdisciplinary angles, which can do justice to the new complex cultural, social and political developments of a globalized Latin/o America.‚Äù Poblete's work has also often analyzed literary works (including comics, film, and literature) and their political or social role in the U.S./Latin America.

Contributions to the field=Affect in a Post-Social Space Poblete refers to the productivity of affect in a post-social space to describe a space dominated by fear and insecurity between different bodies and experiences as a result of both virtual and real, social/political, and economic circumstances. When Poblete uses the concept ‚Äúpost-social space,‚Äù he refers to societies where social security, pensions, health care, education, and other social services or rights are fully or partially privatized, leading to an increase in insecurity and anxiety within society. In this post-social context, it becomes easier and seems necessary for members of society to receive privatized services through the work afforded by racialized immigrants who work for less than the minimum wage. Therefore, a post-social space leads to both confidence in and interdependence between the migrant and non-migrant as well as fear, suspicion, and externalization of the ‚Äúother.‚Äù Poblete explains how non- migrants need migrants for the services they offer in a post-social space, while migrants need non-migrants' employment for their own economic survival. Despite this interdependence, mutual effects including fear, anxiety, and resentment within conditions of exploitation lead to insecurity. As a result of this externalization or ‚Äúotherization,‚Äù the migrant and non-migrant are both affected by a form of exclusion dominated by what becomes a subconscious form of fear and suspicion.Poblete, Juan ‚ÄúLa Productividad del Afecto.‚Äù Mora√±a, Mabel. El Lenguaje De Las Emociones: Afecto Y Cultura En Am√©rica Latina. Madrid: Iberoamericana, 2012. Print. Production of in/visibility In his focus on undocumented migrants, Poblete notes that more than a third of U.S. immigrants have been undocumented and a large percent has been Latino. Within this context, Poblete analyzes the dialectics of both visibility and invisibility affecting migrant populations in the United States. By in/visibility, Poblete refers to the ways migrants are invisibilized as political actors who have contributed to the economy of U.S., while they are visibilized as publics, audiences, and consumers. Their invisibilization as political actors therefore allows for their exploitation and vulnerability while their visibility as publics and consumers allows society to profit from them as a market, often representing them in a culturally homogeneous or stereotyped fashion.Poblete, Juan. ‚ÄúU.S. Latino Studies in a Global Context: Social Imagination and the Production of In/visibility.‚Äù Works and Days 47/48.

South Korea South Korea was the first country to put an internet real-name system into practice. Since 2009, 35 Korean websites have implemented a name registration system in compliance with Korea's amended Information and Communications Network Act. This act was enforced after the suicide of Choi Jin-sil, which was believed to have been related to malicious bulletin board comments about her. Real name systems aim to minimize the amount of negative information published on the Internet and encourage netizens to be responsible for their online behavior.

China The Chinese government in 2011 promulgated its Regulations on the Development and Management of microblogging, which stated that microblogging sites should ensure users were registered under their real names. Major microblogging sites like Sina Weibo, 163 and Sohu agreed to put real name systems into practice by 16 March 2012. Users who had not provided their real information would be barred from posting and transmitting messages thereafter. On 1 June 2017, the Cyber Security Law of China took effect, requiring that everyone who uses Chinese websites to provide their phone number. China's state-run media claimed this would provide a \\"safe and real\\" Internet environment. Social networking sites=Facebook Facebook does not employ a real-name system. Its online Name Policy states: \\"Facebook is a community where people use their real identities. We require everyone to provide their real names, so you always know who you're connecting with. This helps keep our community safe.\\" This strongly encourages users to provide real names when creating an account. Facebook's first uses were university students. According to Danah Boyd, a social media scholar, \\"people provided their name because they saw the site as an extension of campus life.\\" Later users adopted the norms and practices of the early adopters. The use of real names contributed to the quality and quantity of information Facebook has about its users. Facebook became an identity service by encouraging users to share their lives, including their real names.boyd, danah (2012). \\"The Politics of 'Real Names': Power, Context, and Control in Networked Publics.\\" Communications of the ACM. Emil Protalinski, technology journalist for The Next Web, states that some \\"Facebook users opt to use pseudonyms to hide from stalkers, abusive exes, and even governments that don't condone free speech.\\" Pseudonyms allows these users to connect with colleagues, friends, and family without compromising their safety. \\"People feel as though their privacy has been violated when their agency has been undermined or when information about a particular social context has been obscured in ways that subvert people's ability to make an informed decision about what to reveal.\\" Some users may feel uncomfortable with displaying their real names and choose a fake name that appears real to others. Twitter Twitter registration page saying \\"Name looks great\\" after a made-up, meaningless, and unformatted name is entered. Unlike Facebook, the Twitter social networking site does not require real-names for Twitter accounts. According to former CEO Dick Costolo Twitter does not care about real names. Whether the information comes from an account with a real name or one using a pseudonym does not matter. Twitter verifies accounts of prominent users such as celebrities and businesses in order to protect against identity fraud.

Greene, M. Ramalho, B. Rosen, IETF, April 2000 The architecture was originally defined in RFC 2805 and has been used in several prominent voice over IP (VoIP) protocol implementations, such as the Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) and Megaco (H.248), both successors to the obsolete Simple Gateway Control Protocol (SGCP). The architecture divides the functions required for the integration of traditional telecommunication networks and modern packet networks into several physical and logical components, notably the media gateway, the media gateway controller, and signaling gateways. The interaction between the media gateway and its controller is defined in the media gateway control protocol. Media gateway protocols were developed based on the Internet model of networking, the Internet Protocol Suite, and are referred to as device control protocols. A media gateway is a device that offers an IP interface and a legacy telephone interface and that converts media, such as audio and video streams, between them. The legacy telephone interface may be complex, such as an interface to a PSTN switch, or may be a simple interface to a traditional telephone. Depending on the size and purpose of the gateway, it may allow IP-originated calls to terminate to the PSTN or vice versa, or may simply provide a means to connect a telephone to a telecommunication system via an IP network. Originally, gateways were viewed as monolithic devices that had call control, using protocols such as H.323 and the Session Initiation Protocol, and hardware required to control the PSTN interface. In 1998, the idea of splitting the gateway into two logical parts was proposed: one part, which contains the call control logic, is called the media gateway controller (MGC) or call agent (CA), and the other part, which interfaces with the PSTN, is called the media gateway (MG). With this functional split, a new interface existed between the MGC and the MG, requiring a framework for communication between the elements, resulting in the media gateway control protocol architecture. SIP and H.323 are signaling protocols, while media gateway control protocols are device control protocols. The architectural difference between SIP and H.323, and the media gateway control protocols is that the relationships between entities in SIP and H.323 are peer-to-peer, while the relationships between entities in media gateway control protocols use the master/slave (technology) model. SIP and H.323 handle call setup, connection, management, and tear-down of calls between like interfaces, whereas media gateway control protocols define the mechanisms of setup of media paths and streams between IP and other networks. Implementations Several implementations of the media gateway control protocol are in common use. The names of the best-known protocols are abbreviations of the protocol group: *The Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) was first described in RFC 2705, and revised in RFC 3435.RFC 3435, Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) Version 1.0, F. Andreasen, B. Foster, The Internet Society (January 2003) *Megaco, or H.248, or Megaco/H.248, was first described in RFC 3525, which was revised and extended in various specifications, leading to its obsolescence as explained in RFC 5125.RFC 3525, Gateway Control Protocol Version 1, C. Groves, M. Pantaleo, T. Anderson, T. Taylor (editors), The Internet Society (June 2003)RFC 5125, Reclassification of RFC 3525 to Historic, T. Taylor, The IETF Trust (February 2008) Although similar in architecture, MGCP and H.248/Megaco are distinctly different protocols and are not interoperable. H.248/Megaco and MGCP protocols are complementary to H.323 and SIP, which both may be referred to as intelligent endpoint protocols. H.248/Megaco and MGCP may be referred to as device control protocols.title=Use of MEGACO vis-√†-vis MGCP to build a Gateway Solution Other media gateway control protocols include the predecessors of MGCP, namely the Simple Gateway Control Protocol (SGCP) and the Internet Protocol Device Control (IPDC). A proprietary protocol using a similar architecture is the Cisco Skinny Client Control Protocol (SCCP). Network elements=Media gateway A media gateway is a device that converts media streams in the form of digital data or analog signals in telecommunication for services such as voice, video, and fax applications between two, usually dissimilar, interfaces using different technologies. One of the technologies usually is a packet, frame, or cell network. For example, it may convert voice telephone calls between a traditional analog telephone to a digital format for transmission over an Internet Protocol (IP) network, to facilitate voice over IP communications. Media gateway controller A media gateway controller (MGC), also known as a call agent, controls the media gateways. It monitors the gateways for events, such as an off-hook state when a user intends to initiate a telephone call, and issues requests to the gateway to initiate or complete sessions, to alert the called party, or to terminate a call. The protocols used for this interaction between the gateway and its controller have evolved through various types and versions. The Simple Gateway Control Protocol (SGCP) and the Internet Protocol Device Control (IPDC) have been replaced by the Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) and Megaco, which is also known as H.248. Some MGCs interface with other signaling protocols, such as Signalling System No. 7 (SS7), for interconnection with the traditional telephone system, H.323, and the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Protocols The device control protocols evolved through several versions. MGCP emerged from a group now called the International SoftSwitch Consortium. This group started early with Level 3 Communications (through its acquisition of Xcom) and Telcordia (BellCore). In July 1998, Telcordia (Bellcore) and Cisco Systems created a protocol called Simple Gateway Control Protocol (SGCP) for controlling Telephony Gateways from external call control elements. Meanwhile, in mid-1998, Level 3 created a Technical Advisory Council (TAC), composed of a dozen leading communications equipment manufacturers. The TAC proposed a device protocol called Internet Protocol Device Control (IPDC) in August 1998. IPDC was intended to be used between a media gateway and a media gateway controller. Media gateway were capable of acting as a voice over IP gateway, voice over ATM gateway, dialup modem media gateway, circuit switch, or cross- connect. In October 1998, Simple Gateway Control Protocol (SGCP) was combined with Internet Protocol Device Control (IPDC), resulting in MGCP. MGCP was submitted to the IETF‚Äôs MeGaCo working group in October 1998. In November 1998, Lucent Technologies submitted a draft for third device protocol, called Media Device Control Protocol (MDCP) to use by media gateways and their controllers. IETF merged MGCP and MDCP and proposed a new and improved protocol named MeGaCo protocol (also known as H.248) in April 1999. The first \\"official\\" version of MGCP is defined in RFC 2705 as informational. RFC 3435 obsoleted RFC 2705. MGCP currently is purely informational rather than a standard-track protocol, although it includes protocol specification. Even while MGCP was still an Internet Draft, many companies developed included MGCP with their own development rather than wait for a standardized protocol. Therefore, the decision was made to release MGCP as an informational RFC in October 1999. IETF development of MGCP has stopped, although companies continue to implement MGCP, driven by the efforts of the PacketCable development of Network-based Call Signaling. Further standardization of MGCP effort was pursued in the IETF, in the MEGACO working group, and also in the ITU-T/SG16, under the code name H.GCP. RFC 3015 standard tracks the MEGACO protocol (also H.248) and The motivation of Megaco was the need to satisfy various requirements that were not addressed properly by MGCP. Megaco is an evolution of MGCP. It is a combination of MGCP and MDCP, and was published as Standard in RFC 3015 in November 2000. Megaco and MGCP are different and not interoperable. H.248 (H.248.1 Gateway Control Protocol version 3) is published by International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication (ITU-T) as a protocol standard. The ITU-T has published three versions of H.248.1. The IETF published it as Gateway Control Protocol Version 1 in informational RFC 3525. Both H.248 and MGCP are protocol for controlling media gateways using a media gateway controller or call agent. In a VoIP system, H.248 and MGCP are used with SIP or H.323. SIP or H.323 provide intercommunication between gateway controllers and MGCP is used to manage media establishment in the media gateways.

General Crumm commanded the 3d Air Division from 1965 until his death in a B-52 mid-air collision with another B-52 bomber over the South China Sea. General Crumm was the first American general officer and the first of two Air Force general officers (pilots) who were killed during the Vietnam War. Early life and career General Crumm was born on September 20, 1919, in New York City. He entered the military in 1941, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Army Air Forces and received his wings in 1942. General Crumm's first assignment was as a B-17 bomber pilot with the 91st Bombardment Group, based in the European Theater of Operations. Upon returning to the states, he lectured at thirty combat crew schools and every major aircraft factory as a member of the \\"Most Deserving Bomber Crew of the 8th Air Force\\". In May 1943, he was transferred to the 796th Bomb Squadron at Alexandria, Louisiana as Operations Officer, and later that year moved to the staff of Second Air Force in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He assumed command of the 61st Bombardment Squadron at Smoky Hill Army Air Field in Kansas, where he successfully moved the squadron to Guam. In 1946, he transferred to Headquarters, Strategic Air Command (SAC) as assistant training officer in the Flying Training Division, and would in rapid succession hold positions as chief of the Bombardment Section and Training Section deputy and acting chief. He left SAC in August 1947 to attend the Air Command and Staff School, Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. In July 1948, he assumed another squadron command‚Äîthe 344th Bombardment Squadron, based at Spokane Air Force Base in Washington. During January 1949, he assumed the duties as 98th Bombardment Group director of operations at Spokane AFB. He returned to SAC in 1950, as chief of the Special Projects Division, Director of Operations. In 1953 he moved to the Operational Plans Division within the Director of Operations at SAC. In October 1954, after attending the B-47 Advanced Flying School at McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita, Kansas, he was assigned to March Air Force Base, California, first as deputy commander of the 22nd Bombardment Wing, then as Fifteenth Air Force director of operations. He moved to Greenland in September 1956, serving as a task force commander at Thule Air Base. April 22, 1957 saw his return to March as commander of the 320th Bombardment Wing. In October 1958, he transferred to Headquarters, United States Air Force in Washington, D.C. as chief of the Strategic Division, reporting to the Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations. In May 1960, he was assigned as chief of the Atomic Operations Division, J-3, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and in August of that year returned to SAC as the senior Air Force member to the newly organized staff, director, strategic target planning. In June 1962, he became that group's chief of operations. He was assigned as commander, 3rd Air Division, at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, in July 1965. Death General Crumm was declared to be \\"missing and presumed dead\\" 18 days after a July 6, 1967 collision between the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress on which he was flying, and another B-52 bomber, over the South China Sea. At the time of the mid-air collision, both aircraft were en route to a bombing mission over Vietnam. He was the first American and Air Force general officer killed in the Vietnam War. His remains were never recovered; a memorial headstone is located at Arlington National Cemetery. Awards and Decorations Major General Crumm was rated as a command pilot. His military awards include two Legion of Merits, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Bronze Star, four Air Medals, the Air Force Commendation Medal, and two Army Commendation Medals.

Various authoritarian political leaders in various official positions assumed, formally or not, similar titles suggesting the power to speak for the nation itself. Most commonly the title is a form of \\"leader\\" or \\"guide\\", such as \\"Supreme Leader\\". See dictatorship. Before the Second World War Some of the titles used by dictators before World War II were: *The style Vozhd, meaning Chief, was conferred to George Karaƒëorƒëe Petroviƒá for his nationalistic leadership in the uprising against the Ottomans on 1804. *The Paraguayan President Jos√© Gaspar Rodr√≠guez de Francia used, among other titles, El Supremo (The Supreme) and Dictador Perpetuo (Perpetual Dictator). In the 1940s and parts of the 1950s Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. Such titles used by heads of state and/or government during the Second World War include: * F√ºhrer (\\"leader\\" or \\"guide\\") Adolf Hitler, from 1934 to 1945, dictator of Germany (formally \\"F√ºhrer and Reich Chancellor\\"). * Vozhd (\\"leader\\") Joseph Stalin, dictator of Soviet Union has also been referred to as Father of Nations, \\"Great Leader\\", \\"General Secretary\\", \\"Generalisimus\\", \\"The Man of Steel\\", \\"Brilliant Genius of Humanity\\", \\"Great Architect of Communism\\", \\"Gardener of Human Happiness\\", \\"Dear Father\\". * Duce (from Latin dux meaning \\"guide\\") Benito Mussolini, from 1925 to 1943 dictator of Italy (formally \\"Head of Government\\"). * Vodca (\\"Leader\\") monsignor Jozef Tiso, from 1942 self-styled, in Slovakia, President 1939‚Äì1945 (acting to 26 October 1939). * ConducƒÉtor (\\"leader\\"), a title used by Ion Antonescu and Nicolae Ceau»ôescu in Romania. * \\"Mar≈°al\\" (Croatian for \\"general\\" or \\"leader\\")-referred to Josip Broz Tito, dictator of the Yugoslavia * El Caudillo de Espa√±a (\\"the Chieftain of Spain\\") General√≠simo Francisco Franco Bahamonde, Jefe de Estado (Chief of State) and \\"Chief of Government\\" (Prime Minister). He adopted this title for himself and came to power after winning the Spanish Civil War. During World War II he maintained the neutrality of Spain. In fact the titles of Franco and Salazar (in Portugal) were used officially and rather than personally (cf: \\"mein f√ºhrer\\" or \\"mio duce\\" my fuhrer and my duce). It is alleged that it was often used as a protocolary title; preceded with By the Grace of God it would indicate that the Spanish People had been luckily spared from the Soviet invasion. * Naczelnik Pa≈Ñstwa (Chief of state) J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, dictator of Poland from 1926 to 1935. * Poglavnik Nezavisne Dr≈æave Hrvatske (\\"Chief of the Independent State of Croatia\\") Ante Paveliƒá, leader of the Nazi-Fascist Italy puppet government in Croatia. * F√∏rer (\\"leader\\", \\"guide\\") Vidkun Quisling, (formally Minister-president), premier of the Nazi puppet government in Norway, and after Reichskommissar Josef Terboven the highest official in occupied Norway, reporting directly to Adolf Hitler. * Leider (\\"leader\\"), a title used by Anton Mussert, the leader of Nationaal- Socialistische Beweging (National Socialist Movement) in the Netherlands. Though styled \\"leader\\" under the German occupation, he was not a real dictator as he had little actual power. In fact Arthur Seyss-Inquart was in charge of the Netherlands on behalf of the Nazi regime. * Nemzetvezet≈ë (\\"leader of the nation\\"), a title used by Ferenc Sz√°lasi, the chief of the Nyilaskeresztes P√°rt (Arrow Cross Party) who succeeded Mikl√≥s Horthy in Hungary. * Arhigos (\\"chief\\" or \\"leader\\"), a title used by General Ioannis Metaxas of Greece's 4th of August Regime. * Adipati (\\"chief of state\\" or \\"generalissimo\\"), the title used by Ba Maw of the Japanese satellite State of Burma * Udh√´heq√´si [i partis√´ dhe i popullit] yn√´ i madh, Our great guide [of the party and of the people], the most common title used by Albanian communist dictator Enver Hoxha. * Or even simply President as did for example, Get√∫lio Vargas of Brazil, from 1930 to 1945 as well as the generals during the 1964‚Äì1985 regime. Other 'leaders' of contemporary political groups who never achieved power: * Capitanul 'The Captain' Corneliu Zelea Codreanu of the \\"Iron Guard\\" in Romania. * El Jefe 'The Chief' Jorge Gonz√°lez von Mar√©es of the Chilean Nacistas (Chilean-Spanish word for \\"Nazis\\"), who failed a coup d'√©tat in 1938.Chinese Communist Leader Mao Zedong meets with US President Richard Nixon. * Vozhd 'Leader' Konstantin Rodzaevsky of the Russian Fascist Party, only active in exile in Manchuria, most admired Mussolini but saw action only in the anti-Communist service of the Japanese Empire. * the American F√ºhrer Fritz Kuhn. * Chief William Dudley Pelley of the U.S. Silver Legion of America. * Adrien Arcand, self-proclaimed Canadian F√ºhrer of the Canadian National Unity Party. * Tindis or Tandis (leader of a confederation of barangays) used by the Sakdalista Party leader Benigno Ramos during the Commonwealth of the Philippines, under United States sovereignty. In areas occupied by the Axis powers, some states or ethnic-cultural communities aspiring to national self-determination found they were not handed real power by their victorious German allies as they had hoped. Their nationalist leaders, too weak to gain control independently, were simply used as pawns. Such Nazi collaborators include De Leider \\"leader\\" Staf De Clercq of the VNV (Flemish National League) in Flanders (the Dutch-speaking northern majority of Belgium), who had dreamed of a 'Diets' nation uniting Flanders, the Netherlands and Frans-Vlaanderen (the French part of historic Flanders, united with Belgium into one military occupation zone and Reichskommissariat). Even when the Germans decided in December 1944, after the Allied breakthrough, to carve up Belgium, leaving only bicultural capital Brussels under the Reichskommissar, the post of Landsleider van het Vlaamsche Volk ('Land leader of the Flemish people') of the new Reichsgau (integral 'Germanic' part of the Reich, in this case merely on paper) (Flandern, Vlaanderen in Dutch; capital Anwerp) went to another collaborating party, Devlag, in the person of Jef Van de Wiele (1902‚Äì1979), 15 December 1944 ‚Äì 1945, in exile in Germany as the Allies controlled all Belgium since September 1944; meanwhile in the French- speaking south of Belgium, partially reconquered by the Wehrmacht (December 1944 ‚Äì January 1945), the equivalent post of Chef du Peuple Wallon ('Leader of the Walloon People'), at the head of the Reichsgau Wallonien, went to L√©on Degrelle (in exile in Germany) of the Belgicist Rex Party.  Postwar era and the Cold War  Mobutu Sese Seko, Zaire's longtime dictator, embezzled over $5 billion from his country. Suharto, Indonesia's longtime dictator, embezzled over $15 billion from his country. In the post-war era, dictatorship became a frequent feature of military government, especially in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. In the case of many African or Asian former colonies, after achieving their independence in the postwar wave of decolonization, presidential regimes were gradually transformed into personal dictatorships. These regimes often proved unstable, with the personalization of power in the hands of the dictator and his associates, making the political system uncertain. During the Cold War, both the U.S. and the USSR managed to expand or maintain their influence zones by financing paramilitary and political groups and encouraging coups d'√©tat that have led many countries to brutal civil wars and consequent manifestations of authoritarianism.

Main Street in Wichita, Kansas, Sedgwick County, Kansas, United States, is a Carnegie library built in 1915. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. The two-story, limestone Beaux Arts building stands in the southwestern part of Wichita's central business district, directly south of the old City Hall. Its fa√ßade orientation is west. The building measures approximately one hundred and twenty-eight feet from north to south and eighty-three feet from east to west. After the completion of Wichita's present library in 1966, the Wichita City Carnegie Library Building served as city offices and the municipal court until the Wichita Omnisphere and Science Center established its tenancy in 1976, followed by changing tenants. The two-story, ashlar cut, limestone block building sits on an ashlar cut, limestone block, raised foundation with a multiply moulded watertable. Three bays comprise the rectangular building's fa√ßade and rear. The building's main body is one bay deep, a one-bay-by-one-bay brick unit extends from the rear elevation's center bay. A parapetted entry pavilion projects from the facade's center bay. A short, square tower rises from the building's central bay, covered by a rounded, truncated hipped roof sheathed with pantiles and surmounted by a monitor roof. Tripartite windows with translucent glass pierce each wall of the central tower. Standing seam metal covers the gable roofs of the two main wings, the metal may have been tarred. Two skylights, which have been covered due to water leakage, pierce the gable roofs midway. The entry pavilion and the rear extension have low roofs hidden by parapets, they are likely covered with tar and gravel. The building retains its original metal drain pipes on the outer edges of the fa√ßade and the rear extension. A limestone or terracotta entablature, consisting of a multiply moulded bottom course surmounted by an egg and dart architrave, a bracketed frieze, and an incised vegetal and shell motif cornice engages the building on all elevations except the rear. National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination Form, May 12, 1987 The interior was designed by interior designer Louise Caldwell Murdock, a noted interior designer trained at the Parsons School of Fine Art in New York.http://www.kshs.org/resource/national_register/nominationsNRDB/Sedgwick_20CenturyClubSR.pdf In 1987 it was described that the building \\"maintains its original atrium floorplan and ceramic tiled floors. The beamed and coffered first level ceiling, the Doric pilasters below the ceiling beams, the first level marble columns, the egg and dart moulding ceiling cornice on the first level, the wooden door and window surrounds, the double cast iron staircase in the vestibule, and the three story, classically detailed atrium surround are retained.\\" In 2006, Fidelity Bank purchased the building, and is now its corporate headquarters.

It was made by husband and wife Sascha Hartmann and Tessa Hartmann. Directed by Sascha Hartmann, the film stars the voices of Sean Connery, Alan Cumming, Patrick Doyle and Kieron Elliott. The film is Scotland's first CGI animated feature film. Sascha directed the film from a screenplay written by his wife Tessa, based on an original story they developed together. It is also the final acting role for Sean Connery, who briefly came out of retirement to work on the film.  Premise  The titular Sir Billi, an old, skateboarding veterinarian, goes above and beyond the call of responsibility fighting villainous policemen and strong lairds in a war to save an illegal fugitive‚ÄîBessie Boo the beaver.

The film was in production for several years, with a 30-minute short film version completed in 2006, but it was expanded to 80 minutes. The total budget was ¬£15 million. The film premiered on 13 April 2012 at the Sonoma International Film Festival. which is better known as a wine festival. Worldwide distribution rights were acquired by Shoreline Entertainment in October 2012. It was scheduled for a limited British release on September 13, 2013 at three cinemas, to be followed by a DVD release. The film was released in the United States under the alternative title Guardian of the Highlands, which is also the name of the film's title song, sung by Dame Shirley Bassey. Critical response The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 0% approval rating with an average rating of 2.33/10 based on 6 reviews. The negative reaction to the film was widely reported in the British press. Peter Debruge of Variety called it \\"woefully anaemic\\", criticising its \\"simplistic story and non-sequitur style\\". They also pointed out a few in-jokes referencing Connery's past role as James Bond, such as title sequence featuring a Shirley Bassey song that pastiches Bond themes. Siobhan Synnot of The Scotsman called it \\"mirthless\\" and \\"rudimentary\\". Russ Fischer of SlashFilm criticized it as an \\"ignominious\\" end to Connery's career, even compared to his previous film, the critically reviled The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Fred Patten of Flayrah called the CG \\"the ugliest that I have ever seen\\". Journalist Lisa Summers was also harshly critical of both the CGI and the story. F Bomb Movie Review felt it badly failed to connect with today's children. Despite the film's universally negative reception, AM FM Magazine claimed it was well received on its premiere in Sonoma.

It is spread over an area of 443 acres. It is one of the most thickly wooded areas of the city‚Äôs green lungs. Concerns The forest, which is part of the Mehrauli South Central Ridge, has undergone severe degradation in recent times with the proliferation of the Prosopis juliflora tree which is non-endemic to the Aravalli Ranges and has caused depletion of the ground water level, killing native flora and changing the natural soil characteristics of the Aravallis. Sewage water and effluent which is discharged into Sanjay Van has also affected this green belt in the Capital. Restoration Work Amid a growing demand from nature lovers, the forest is going to be made a bird sanctuary. The Sanjay Van, which is presently undergoing restoration through a unique collaborative effort between the Delhi Development Authority and a citizen's group, may well serve as a model that will be replicated to restore other ridges in the capital. Attractions A nest of Camponotus ants in the forest Apart from heritage, the area is one of the few recluses for bird watchers and nature enthusiasts. Resident or visiting birds include the Indian peafowl, grey heron, Eurasian golden oriole, purple sunbird, Asian koel, Brahminy starling, Indian silverbill, grey- breasted prinia, crested honey buzzard, white-throated kingfisher, rufous treepie, Indian paradise flycatcher, Eurasian sparrowhawk, red-wattled lapwing, cattle egret, common moorhen, white-breasted waterhen, grey francolin and the Jacobin cuckoo, a migrant from Africa that breeds in this forest. The forest also conserves natural habitat for the nilgai, golden jackal, snakes and a large variety of butterflies.

OND is related to all-carbon bicycle norbornadiene. Synthesis Diels‚ÄìAlder synthesis of OND dicarboxylates While unsubstituted OND is known, the most useful OND derivatives are dialkyl OND-2,3-dicarboxylates, readily obtainable by a Diels‚ÄìAlder cycloaddition between furans and acetylenedicarboxylates such as DMAD. Properties OND-2,3-dicarboxylates (thereafter referred to as OND) display unusually high reactivity towards azides and thiols. OND‚Äìthiol adducts are prone to retro-Diels‚ÄìAlder fragmentation, which occurs with widely variable rates. Reactions with Azides ONDs react with azides to yield a mixture of four products, arising from initial 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition onto either of the two olefins, followed by retro-Diels‚ÄìAlder cycloreversion to form 1,2,3-triazoles and furans. The intermediate triazolines avoid detection because of a very strong thermodynamic drive to collapse into two aromatic products. The relative preference of attack on either double bond is governed by the electronic nature of the azides. Electron-rich aliphatic azides, e.g. benzyl azide, react preferentially via their HOMO orbital. Interaction of the azide HOMO with LUMO orbital of the OND, localized on the electron-poor C-2 and C-3, leads the products consistent with path A. Electron-poor aryl azides, such as p-nitrophenyl azide, react, to a significant extent, via their LUMO orbitals, interacting with OND HOMO (C-5 and C-6), leading to higher amounts of path B products. The dipolar reactivity of OND with azides is unusually high for olefins, and even exceeds that of parent electron-poor alkyne DMAD.[2] Reaction of OND with organic azides References Oxygen heterocycles Bicyclic compounds ","title":"Oxanorbornadiene"},{"id":"36066404","text":"A Harry Warren Showcase is an album by pianist Kenny Drew recorded in 1957 and released on the Riverside Records subsidiary Judson label.Kenny Drew discography accessed June 7, 2012 The album was rereleased on CD by Milestone Records as a compilation with its companion album A Harold Arlen Showcase as Kenny Drew Plays the Music of Harry Warren and Harold Arlen in 1995.

Accessed 07 June 2012 The book was dedicated to writer Theodore Dreiser and included a two-page essay about him titled \\"Dreiser\\" in addition to a foreword and nine stories. Composition and publication The beginning of 1923 was a busy time for Sherwood Anderson. With the publication of his novel Many Marriages (1923) in February, the author turned his attention to an autobiographical work slated for publication in Harper's (though the magazine deal didn't pan out, the work eventually became A Story Teller's Story).Rideout (2006), 498 and 501 It was at a pause in that work that he planned to work on the short story collection already bearing the title Horses and Men.Rideout (2006), 497-498 In the beginning of April, that pause came and Anderson put aside his manuscript to turn his focus to the collectionRideout (2006), 502-503 which he had promised to his publisher by July 1.McCullough (1979), 258 Anderson's excitement about the stories in Horses and Men and his comfortable surroundings in a small Reno, Nevada cottage where he was accompanied by his soon-to-be wife, Elizabeth Prall, pushed him to work quickly so the completed manuscript was posted to Ben Huebsch on 16 May 1923.McCullough (1979), 259 The months between May and October 1923 found Anderson back to work on Story Teller's Story (then tentatively titled \\"Modernist Notebook\\" or Straws)Rideout (2006), 498 and 502 with brief pauses on 19 July and early August to read the proofs for Horses and Men.Rideout (2006), 514-515 In multiple letters also sent during that time, Anderson and Huebsch discussed the order of the stories, the book's design, and Huebsch's editing (which was largely hands-off except the normalization grammar and spelling). Originally, it was decided that the design of Horses and Men would resemble Winesburg, Ohio, however the newer book's significantly greater length forced a compromise in which the publisher maintained the earlier book's cover and dust jacket characteristics while adding more words per page in the body of the book.McCullough (1979), 259-262 Another compromise was the omission of Anderson's story \\"There She is -- She is Taking Her Bath\\" which was scheduled to appear in Pictorial Review in November 1923. Rather than delay publication of the entire collection for the sake of the one story, a decision was made to cut it (the story later appeared in Death in the Woods (1933)).McCullough (1979), 263Rideout (2006), 512 Horses and Men was released on 26 October 1923, selling for $2.00 a copy.McCullough (1979), 264 Upon opening the book, readers would see that out of the nine stories and short essay on Dreiser, six were variations of previously published pieces. \\"Dreiser\\" was the earliest to be published, appearing in the April 1916 issue of The Little Review.Anderson, Sherwood (April 1916). \\"Dreiser\\".

The previous pair of transits had taken place in 1761 and 1769, and the next pair would not take place until 2004 and 2012. As with previous transits, the 1874 transit would provide an opportunity for improved measurements and observations. Numerous expeditions were planned and sent out to observe the transit from locations around the globe, with several countries setting up official committees to organise the planning. There were six official French expeditions. One expedition went to New Zealand's Campbell Island, the other five travelling to √éle Saint-Paul in the Indian Ocean, Noum√©a in New Caledonia in the Pacific, Nagasaki in Japan (with an auxiliary station in Kobe), Peking in China, and Saigon in Vietnam. There were five official British expeditions or observation sites. One expedition travelled to Hawaii, with two others sent to the Kerguelen Archipelago in the far southern reaches of the Indian Ocean, and Rodrigues, an island further north in the Indian Ocean, near Mauritius. A fourth expedition went to a site near Cairo in Egypt, and the fifth travelled to a site near Christchurch in New Zealand. Several of the expeditions included auxiliary observation stations that were constructed in addition to the main observation sites. In the United States, the Transit of Venus Commission sent out eight expeditions funded by Congress, one to Kerguelen, one to Hobart, Tasmania, one to Queenstown, New Zealand, one to Chatham Island in the southern Pacific, one led by James Craig Watson in Peking, one to Nagasaki in Japan, and one to Vladivostok in Russia. The eighth expedition had been intended for Crozet Island, but was unable to land there and instead made observations from Tasmania. These expeditions obtained 350 photographic plates for the 1874 transit. The transit was observed from many observatories, including the Melbourne Observatory, Adelaide Observatory and Sydney Observatory in Australia, the Royal Observatory at Cape Town in what is now South Africa, the Royal Alfred Observatory on Mauritius, the Madras Observatory in Madras, India, the Colonial Time Service Observatory in Wellington, New Zealand, and the Khedivial Observatory in Egypt. The Sydney Observatory sent an observing party to Goulburn in Australia. Passage de Venus (1874) by Pierre Janssen Italian astronomer Pietro Tacchini led an expedition to Muddapur, India. Other locations in India from where the transit was observed included Roorkee, and Visakhapatnam. The German astronomer Hugo von Seeliger directed an expedition that travelled to the Auckland Islands (subantarctic New Zealand islands). German astronomers also travelled to Isfahan in Persia, and to Kerguelen. The Dutch astronomer Jean Abraham Chr√©tien Oudemans made observations from R√©union, and observations were also made from various points in the Dutch East Indies. Austrian astronomers made observations from Jassy, in what is now Romania. The Russian astronomer Otto Wilhelm von Struve organised expeditions to make observations in eastern Asia, the Caucasus, Persia and Egypt. Two Mexican expeditions travelled to Yokohama in Japan. There were also several individuals that journeyed to various locations to observe the transit, or funded private expeditions. Archibald Campbell made observations from Thebes in Egypt. James Ludovic Lindsay funded a private expedition to Mauritius. Several private or amateur observations were known to have been made from New South Wales, including from Eden, Windsor, and Sydney. A privately funded expedition from the USA also travelled to Beechworth, Victoria, in Australia. Not all the observers were able to make measurements, either due to adverse weather conditions, or problems with the equipment used. Many observers, particularly those on the official expeditions, used the new technique of photoheliography, intending to use the photographic plates to make precise measurements. However, the results of using this new technique were poor, and several expeditions were unable to produce publishable results or improve on existing values for the astronomical unit (AU). In addition to this, observations made of Mars were producing more accurate results for calculating the value of the AU than could be obtained during a transit of Venus.
