He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Ogmore at a by-election in 1946, but stood down at the 1950 general election. John Evans, a fluent Welsh speaker, was elected MP for Ogmore in 1946, following a by-election, caused by the resignation of Ted Williams who had been appointed as high commissioner to Australia. It was said by many that at 70 years of age he was too old for the job but it is well to remember that Winston Churchill became prime minister for the second time at 76 and remained an MP into his eighties. John Evans was born at Cwmparc in the Rhondda Valley in September 1875 and attended the local Park Board School. He started work at twelve years of age in the local colliery where he remained for the next 20 years before winning a place at Ruskin College. On his return he became union secretary at Coegnant colliery, Maesteg. By now he was living at Nantyffyllon. He was elected to Maesteg UDC (1916‚Äì37) and Glamorgan CC in (1913‚Äì46). In 1929 he stood unsuccessfully for parliament in Montgomeryshire, and in 1931 he failed to get the nomination for Ogmore losing out to Ted Williams. Surprisingly, as the sitting MP, he failed to gain the nomination, from the Ogmore Labour Party, for the 1950 General Election, despite being steeped in mining tradition and Welsh Culture. Walter Padley gained the nomination and went on to be the MP for the next 29 years. Shortly after his non-selection, John Evans moved to Tongwynlais near Cardiff and from there won a seat on Glamorgan CC in 1952, at the grand age of 75. He died in 1961, aged 85.

However, school officials eventually settled on the name \\"High Point High School\\" because of the school's location on what residents believed to be the highest point in the county. Upon its opening High Point High began serving Greenbelt, and the former Greenbelt High School became Greenbelt Junior High School. By the late 1950s High Point used a \\"split class\\" system as it was over capacity.

In 2011 the district placed the assistant principal, as an interim principal after a video of a fight at the school appeared on YouTube. In 2014 the district's board agreed to do a feasibility study on building a new school building. By 2017 the existing building had 2,700 students when it was designed for around 2,100 students.

Beebe Plain is an unincorporated geographically-contiguous settlement, split politically between Canada and the United States. An unincorporated village partially in Stanstead and partially in Derby Line, it is divided by the Quebec-Vermont border. This settlement was begun by David and Calvin Beebe in 1798.Forests and clearings: the history of Stanstead County, province of Quebec, with sketches of more than five hundred families, by Hubbard, B. F. (Benjamin F.), b. 1798; Lawrence, John, b. 1814, Published 1874 History This was once a single village, established soon after the Treaty of Paris (1783) had provided for 45‚Å∞N to be Vermont's northern boundary, but well before surveyors had determined the border's location. The original International Boundary Commission charged with surveying and mapping the boundary was a creation of later treaties. Its survey, completed in the post-1812 era, missed the 45‚Å∞N line by anywhere from a kilometre to a mile through much of the region, dividing the village in two instead of placing it primarily in Canada. A saw mill was established as the town's first industry in 1863. The first post office was established in 1864, directly on the international boundary.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat;=19780619&id;=lhBPAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=gQIEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6012,1146080&hl;=en Until the early 1900s the Canadian and US post offices were in opposite sides of the same building - a former store built in the 1820s.http://townshipsheritage.com/article/first-mail-routes Both were served by the same postmaster, but a letter from one side of the building to the other took a 200-mile path by rail through both White River Junction, Vermont and Sherbrooke, Quebec.Grey River Argus (New Zealand), 1 November 1913 > Page 3 > [A UNIQUE POST OFFICE http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi- bin/paperspast?a=d&d;=GRA19131101.2.17] By 1869, Beebe Plain had a church, two stores, a post office, a customs post and some houses. Geography Border vehicles at the US-Canada borderCanusa Street (Quebec Route 247), the border between the two countries, runs through the middle of the village. Homes on the south side of Canusa Street are in the United States; their residents must obtain passports and report to Customs to leave their driveways. The Canadian portion of this divided village held the status of incorporated municipality (in Quebec) prior to its annexation to Stanstead, Quebec in 1995. As of 1991, the last census before municipal amalgamation, Beebe Plain housed 975 Canadians. While the US side of the village is at most comparable in size, it was not incorporated as a municipality and is therefore not broken out from the rest of Derby Line, Vermont for census purposes. Transport Beebe Plain was the border crossing for the Massawippi Valley Railway, a short line railway established 1870 between Lennoxville, Quebec and an 1867 Connecticut and Passumpsic Rivers Railroad line which ran through Newport, Vermont to the border. Part of the Quebec Central Railway from 1926, the line was abandoned by CP in 1990 and removed in 1992. Much of the former railway's path is now bicycle or nature trails. The railway's international boundary crossing has been closed, leaving a gap in the trail between Main Street (rue Principale) and the US border. The old rail station and the original post office still stand, used as private homes.http://townshipsheritage.com/article/stansteads- heritage-glance Economy The granite industry is the major force in the area's economic history; the stone has been transported to distant cities both for memorials and for architectural use.

Newcombe (born August 8, 1950) is the founder and chairman of Creators Syndicate, which currently represents more than 200 writers and artists. Since the company's founding in 1987, the roster of talent has included Ann Landers, Hillary Clinton, Bill O'Reilly, Hunter S. Thompson, Herblock and the comic strips B.C., The Wizard of Id, Archie and Mickey Mouse. Creators Syndicate is located in Hermosa Beach, California, and distributes its content to 2,400 newspapers, magazines, websites and other digital outlets around the world. Early life Richard S. Newcombe was born on August 8, 1950, in Chicago, Illinois. His father, Leo Newcombe, served as senior vice president for the newspaper division of Field Enterprises and as general manager of the Chicago Daily News and the Chicago Sun-Times. Leo and Ann Newcombe had eight children, and they lived in Winnetka, Illinois. In 1969, Rick Newcombe was one of the first graduates of La Lumiere School, a high school with boarding and day students that was founded in 1963 in La Porte, Indiana. U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts was also an early graduate of La Lumiere, which has had fewer than 2,000 graduates since its founding and has also become a national basketball powerhouse. Newcombe then attended Georgetown University, where he was one of the founding editors of The Georgetown Voice, was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, and graduated magna cum laude. Career=Publishing After graduating from Georgetown University in 1972, Newcombe worked as an advertising copywriter at Leo Burnett Worldwide and then as a sales manager in Chicago with Success Motivation Institute, based in Waco, Texas. He studied at night for an MBA degree at the graduate business school at the University of Chicago. He also worked in sales at David H. Sandler & Associates in Baltimore. From 1974 to 1978, Newcombe worked as a reporter and editor at United Press International. = L.A. Times Syndicate and News America Syndicate = In 1978, Newcombe became vice president and general manager of the Los Angeles Times Syndicate, and in 1984, he was named president of News America Syndicate, which then was the third-largest syndicate in the world and owned by Rupert Murdoch. = Creators Syndicate = Three years later, Newcombe left News America Syndicate to form Creators Syndicate, an American independent distributor of comic strips and syndicated columns to daily newspapers and websites. Creators Syndicate was founded in Los Angeles on February 13, 1987, and moved to Hermosa Beach, California, in 2012. Creators Syndicate revolutionized the syndication industry by being the first to offer cartoonists ownership rights to their work. The industry standard before Creators‚Äô founding was for the company to own the rights to their cartoonists‚Äô creations ‚Äî the name, characters and likenesses. Rudolph Dirks created the hugely successful comic strip, The Katzenjammer Kids, which first appeared in print in 1897. In 1912, Dirks challenged William Randolph Hearst for ownership rights to his comic strip, and ultimately Hearst prevailed, which set the tone for the industry until Creators Syndicate‚Äôs founding. Milton Caniff was another of several important cartoonists who had tried unsuccessfully to secure rights to their creations. In 1946, he walked away from the enormously popular Terry and the Pirates comic strip because his syndicate insisted that they own his creation. In 1947 he created Steve Canyon because Marshall Field III, who owned the Chicago Sun and its syndicate, allowed him to own the rights to his comic strip. This was one of the very few exceptions at that time. After Creators Syndicate was founded, Caniff sent Newcombe a postcard saying, ‚ÄúTo put it on the record: Hooray!!!\\" Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Mike Peters told Editor & Publisher magazine, \\"It's long overdue that syndicates realize a new day is here. Indentured servitude went out in the 1500s.\\" Johnny Hart, creator of B.C. and The Wizard of Id, called Creators ‚Äúa history-making venture in syndication.‚Äù Bil Keane, creator of The Family Circus, described Creators Syndicate as ‚Äúthe first breath of fresh air the syndicates have had in 100 years of existence.‚Äù The New York Times ran a story about Newcombe with the headline, ‚ÄúA Superhero for Cartoonists?‚Äù Today, largely as a result of Creators Syndicate, all syndicates grant cartoonists ownership rights to their work. Within a few months of forming his media company, Newcombe had acquired the syndication rights to Ann Landers, then the world's most widely syndicated newspaper columnist, the comic strip B.C. by Johnny Hart, and the political cartoons of Herblock, The Washington Post‚Äôs legendary editorial cartoonist. In addition to Herblock, Newcombe has also worked with Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonists Bill Mauldin, Michael Ramirez, Paul Conrad, Mike Luckovich, Paul Szep, Doug Marlette and Steve Breen. Other award-winning political cartoonists include Chip Bok, Steve Kelley, Chuck Asay, Bob Gorrell, John Deering, Steve Benson and Gary Varvel. Over the years, Newcombe and Creators has syndicated some of the most important figures of our time, including Pope John Paul II, Richard Nixon, Hillary Clinton, Jimmy Carter, Nancy Reagan, Henry Kissinger, Erma Bombeck, Art Buchwald, Joyce Jillson, Jeane Dixon, Sydney Omarr, Carl Rowan, Robert Novak, Dan Quayle and Oliver North. Newcombe also has syndicated Bill O'Reilly, Molly Ivins, Larry Kudlow, John Stossel, Hunter S. Thompson, Arianna Huffington, Tony Kornheiser, Patrick Buchanan, Thomas Sowell, Walter E. Williams, Michelle Malkin, Mona Charen, Ben Carson, Star Parker, Mark Shields and Susan Estrich. Other columnists include Alexander Cockburn, Robert Scheer, David Nyhan, Brent Bozell, Tony Snow, Tony Blankley, Eric Breindel, Chandra Bozelko and Benazir Bhutto. In addition to B.C., Creators comic strips include The Wizard of Id, One Big Happy, Speed Bump, Chuckle Brothers, Agnes, Ballard Street, Liberty Meadows, Rubes, The Other Coast, Archie, Long Story Short, Batman, Zorro, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. He also syndicated The Far Side internationally. In 2008 Creators Syndicate acquired the Copley News Service, a wire service that distributed news, political cartoons, and opinion columns. In 1991 Creators Syndicate took over Heritage Features Syndicate, which was part of the conservative Heritage Foundation based in Washington, D.C. In 2011 Jack Newcombe became President of Creators Syndicate,Press release. \\"JACK NEWCOMBE NAMED PRESIDENT/COO OF CREATORS SYNDICATE,\\" Creators.com (July 12, 2011). and together with Rick Newcombe started Creators Publishing and Sumner Books, which have published more than 150 titles. One of their best sellers is What I Believe by Ben Carson, which includes an introduction by Rick Newcombe. One of Sumner Books most successful projects is the \\"Stories of Success\\" series by best-selling author Horatio Alger, which have particular appeal to homeschooling parents. Controversies After 25 years of operating in the city of Los Angeles, Creators Syndicate moved to nearby Hermosa Beach because of a tax dispute with the city. In 1992 Creators and the city had a series of hearings to determine the category of tax classification for the company. Once that was determined, Creators stayed in Los Angeles. But in 2007, the city said it changed its mind and wanted Creators moved to a much higher tax classification retroactively for five years with interest and penalties. Newcombe gave Arianna Huffington her start as a syndicated columnist in 1996 but they parted ways in 1998 after Sheila Lawrence, widow of U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland Larry Lawrence, filed a $25 million lawsuit against the columnist, the syndicate and some of their clients. Author and hobbyist Newcombe is also an avid weightlifter, pipe collector, and writer. He contributed to the 1983 book The Businessman's Minutes-A-Day Guide to Shaping Up, by former champion bodybuilder and Italian actor Dr. Franco Columbu. He has been lifting weights for most of his life and entered one bodybuilding contest in 1986, placing third in the AAU Mr. Los Angeles Contest. He has been featured in Muscle & Fitness magazine.

To accomplish this the hot fluid is brought into contact with the heat storage medium, then the fluid is displaced with the cold fluid, which absorbs the heat.Regenerative heat exchangers In regenerative heat exchangers, the fluid on either side of the heat exchanger can be the same fluid. The fluid may go through an external processing step, and then it is flowed back through the heat exchanger in the opposite direction for further processing. Usually the application will use this process cyclically or repetitively. Regenerative heating was one of the most important technologies developed during the Industrial Revolution when it was used in the hot blast process on blast furnaces, It was later used in glass and steel making, to increase the efficiency of open hearth furnaces, and in high pressure boilers and chemical and other applications, where it continues to be important today. History Blast furnace (left), and three Cowper stoves (right) used to preheat the air blown into the furnace The first regenerator was invented by Rev. Robert Stirling in 1816, and is also found as a component of some examples of his Stirling engine. The simplest Stirling engines, including most models, use the walls of the cylinder and displacer as a rudimentary regenerator, which is simpler and cheaper to construct but far less efficient. Later applications included the blast furnace process known as hot blast and the open hearth furnace also called Siemens regenerative furnace (which was used for making glass), where the hot exhaust gases from combustion are passed through firebrick regenerative chambers, which are thus heated. The flow is then reversed, so that the heated bricks preheat the fuel.W. K. V. Gale, British iron and steel industry (David and Charles, Newton Abbot 1967), 98‚Äì100. Edward Alfred Cowper applied the regeneration principle to blast furnaces, in the form of the \\"Cowper stove\\", patented in 1857.Bennet Woodcroft, 'Chronological Index of Patents Applied for and Patents Granted, for the Year 1857', Patent No.1404, 19 May 1857 https://books.google.com/books?id=zXMyAQAAIAAJ&printsec;=frontcover&dq;=index+of+patents&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=A6cpU7vGKM3xhQef5ICIAg&redir;_esc=y#v=snippet&q;=edward%20alfred%20cowper&f;=false This is almost invariably used with blast furnaces to this day.C. K. Hyde, Technological change and the British iron industry 1700‚Äì1870 (Princeton University Press, 1977), 200‚Äì1. Five Cowper's regenerative heat exchanger placed in series.  Types of regenerators  Regenerators exchange heat from one process fluid to an intermediate solid heat storage medium, then that medium exchanges heat with a second process fluid flow. The two flows are either separated in time, alternately circulating through the storage medium, or are separated in space and the heat storage medium is moved between the two flows. In rotary regenerators, or thermal wheels, the heat storage \\"matrix\\" in the form of a wheel or drum,that rotates continuously through two counter- flowing streams of fluid. In this way, the two streams are mostly separated. Only one stream flows through each section of the matrix at a time; however, over the course of a rotation, both streams eventually flow through all sections of the matrix in succession. The heat storage medium can be a relatively fine-grained set of metal plates or wire mesh, made of some resistant alloy or coated to resist chemical attack by the process fluids, or made of ceramics in high temperature applications. A large amount of heat transfer area can be provided in each unit volume of the rotary regenerator, compared to a shell-and-tube heat exchanger - up to 1000 square feet of surface can be contained in each cubic foot of regenerator matrix, compared to about 30 square feet in each cubic foot of a shell-and-tube exchanger.John J. McKetta Jr (ed.), Heat Transfer Design Methods, CRC Press, 1991, , pages 101-103 Each portion of the matrix will be nearly isothermal, since the rotation is perpendicular to both the temperature gradient and flow direction, and not through them. The two fluid streams flow counter-current. The fluid temperatures vary across the flow area; however the local stream temperatures are not a function of time. The seals between the two streams are not perfect, so some cross contamination will occur. The allowable pressure level of a rotary regenerator is relatively low, compared to heat exchangers. Patent drawings for a rotary regenerator, illustrating the drum-shaped matrix and the seals that prevent mixing of the streams. Ljungstr√∂mRotary regenerator. In a fixed matrix regenerator, a single fluid stream has cyclical, reversible flow; it is said to flow \\"counter-current\\". This regenerator may be part of a valveless system, such as a Stirling engine. In another configuration, the fluid is ducted through valves to different matrices in alternate operating periods resulting in outlet temperatures that vary with time. For example, a blast furnace may have several \\"stoves\\" or \\"checkers\\" full of refractory fire brick. The hot gas from the furnace is ducted through the brickwork for some interval, say one hour, until the brick reaches a high temperature. Valves then operate and switch the cold intake air through the brick, recovering the heat for use in the furnace. Practical installations will have multiple stoves and arrangements of valves to gradually transfer flow between a \\"hot\\" stove and an adjacent \\"cold\\" stove, so that the variations in the outlet air temperature are reduced.Ramesh K. Shah, Dusan P. Sekulic Fundamentals of Heat Exchanger Design,John Wiley & Sons, 2003 , page 55 Another type of regenerator is called a micro scale regenerative heat exchanger. It has a multilayer grating structure in which each layer is offset from the adjacent layer by half a cell which has an opening along both axes perpendicular to the flow axis. Each layer is a composite structure of two sublayers, one of a high thermal conductivity material and another of a low thermal conductivity material. When a hot fluid flows through the cell, heat from the fluid is transferred to the cell wells, and stored there. When the fluid flow reverses direction, heat is transferred from the cell walls back to the fluid. A third type of regenerator is called a \\"Rothemuhle\\" regenerator. This type has a fixed matrix in a disk shape, and streams of fluid are ducted through rotating hoods. The Rothemuhle regenerator is used as an air preheater in some power generating plants. The thermal design of this regenerator is the same as of other types of regenerators. Biology We use our nose and throat as a regenerative heat exchanger when we breathe. The cooler air coming in is warmed, so that it reaches the lungs as warm air. On the way back out, this warmed air deposits much of its heat back onto the sides of the nasal passages, so that these passages are then ready to warm the next batch of air coming in. Some animals, including humans, have curled sheets of bone inside the nose called nasal turbinates to increase the surface area for heat exchange. Cryogenics Regenerative heat exchangers are made up of materials with high volumetric heat capacity and low thermal conductivity in the longitudinal (flow) direction. At cryogenic (very low) temperatures around 20 K, the specific heat of metals is low, and so a regenerator must be larger for a given heat load.  Advantages of regenerators  The advantages of a regenerator over a recuperating (counter-flowing) heat exchanger is that it has a much higher surface area for a given volume, which provides a reduced exchanger volume for a given energy density, effectiveness and pressure drop. This makes a regenerator more economical in terms of materials and manufacturing, compared to an equivalent recuperator. The design of inlet and outlet headers used to distribute hot and cold fluids in the matrix is much simpler in counter flow regenerators than recuperators. The reason behind this is that both streams flow in different sections for a rotary regenerator and one fluid enters and leaves one matrix at a time in a fixed-matrix regenerator. Furthermore, flow sectors for hot and cold fluids in rotary regenerators can be designed to optimize pressure drop in the fluids. The matrix surfaces of regenerators also have self-cleaning characteristics, reducing fluid-side fouling and corrosion. Finally properties such as small surface density and counter-flow arrangement of regenerators make it ideal for gas-gas heat exchange applications requiring effectiveness exceeding 85%. The heat transfer coefficient is much lower for gases than for liquids, thus the enormous surface area in a regenerator greatly increases heat transfer.  Disadvantages of regenerators  The major disadvantage of rotary and fixed- matrix regenerators is that there is always some mixing of the fluid streams, and they can not be completely separated. There is an unavoidable carryover of a small fraction of one fluid stream into the other. In the rotary regenerator, the carryover fluid is trapped inside the radial seal and in the matrix, and in a fixed-matrix regenerator, the carryover fluid is the fluid that remains in the void volume of the matrix. This small fraction will mix with the other stream in the following half-cycle. Therefore, rotary and fixed-matrix regenerators are only used when it is acceptable for the two fluid streams to be mixed. Mixed flow is common for gas-to-gas heat and/or energy transfer applications, and less common in liquid or phase-changing fluids since fluid contamination is often prohibited with liquid flows. The constant heating and cooling that takes place in regenerative heat exchangers puts a lot of stress on the components of the heat exchanger, which can cause cracking or breakdown of materials.

In 1854 he described bird- like trackways that he thought could have been made by dinosaurs, which he later identified as probably those of Iguanodon in 1862. In 1857, following the discovery of a mammal jaw at Durlston Bay, he directed a major excavation that became known as 'Beckles' Pit', removing five metres of overburden over a 600 square metre area, one of the largest ever scientific excavations. The collection of mammal fossils that resulted is now mainly held at the Natural History Museum. He discovered the small herbivorous dinosaur Echinodon. The only known species Echinodon becklesii, the mammal Plagiaulax becklesii and the dinosaur Becklespinax were named in his honour (although the last of these is now known as Altispinax). Early life Beckles was born on 12 April 1814 in Barbados. He was the seventh child of John Alleyne Beckles and Elizabeth n√©e Spooner. His father was at that time Chief Judge of the Court of Vice Admiralty of Barbados, later becoming President of the Legislative Council of Barbados. Samuel moved to England, becoming a student of the Middle Temple in 1835. He was called to the bar in 1838 and in the same year married his first cousin Susannah Henry. He retired from his life as a barrister due to ill health in 1845, moving to St Leonards-on-Sea in East Sussex. Fossil collector Beckles spent his remaining 45 years collecting fossils, apparently unrestricted by his health. He published a series of papers on his fossil discoveries in the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London. Between 1851 and 1854 he published three accounts of footprints from the Lower Cretaceous Wealden rocks near Hastings, identifying them as the imprints of large bipedal animals, possibly birds. He became a fellow of the Geological Society of London in 1854. By 1862 he was prepared to link these trackways with dinosaurs, particularly Iguanodon. In 1854 a mammal jaw was discovered at Durlston Bay by William Brodie of Swanage and he made further discoveries over the next two years. Richard Owen persuaded Beckles to carry out an excavation of the area where the jaw had been found and this commenced in 1856. Beckles both supervised and paid for the excavation, which became known as 'Beckles' Pit'. An area of more than 600 square metres was excavated, removing an overburden 5 m in thickness. The mammal bed, a layer of marl known as a \\"dirt bed\\", itself averaged only in thickness. The excavation lasted for nine months and was featured in the Illustrated London News. At least twelve species of mammals were recovered, along with the remains of reptiles, insects and freshwater shells. In 1859 he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in recognition of his ability and enthusiasm in this endeavour. The recovered specimens were sent straight to Charles Lyell, who handed them to Hugh Falconer for the initial description. Lyell then sent the material on to Owen, who published his descriptions in 1871. Following the death of his first wife, Beckles married for a second time in 1882, to Jane Gordon. Beckles died on 4 September 1890.

Accreditation Credential in Cosmetic Dentistry  In 1983, Dr. Morley saw the need for a standardized credential in the newly emerging field of cosmetic dentistry and led the formation of AACD's Accreditation Program in 1985. With the help of Dr. Michael Miller, the AACD developed an examination process for cosmetic dentistry, the first of its kind within the dental profession, and began offering postgraduate certification in the field in 1986. AACD Accreditation has grown into the preeminent cosmetic dentistry testing standard within dentistry, including written exams and submission of actual case-work in specific cosmetic dentistry disciplines. The credential is available to both dentists and laboratory technicians, worldwide. While the American Dental Association has not recognized cosmetic dentistry as a specialty, a landmark court case in Florida, Ducoin v Viamonte determined that AACD accreditation is a legitimate credential that can be announced by a dentist to the public.

In 1988, Holdren won the NHSCA girls track coach of the year award, and he won the NHSCA girls cross- country coach of the year award in 2006. A coach can only win this award once in any particular sport, making it both more honorable and exceptionable that he has won the award both in track and in cross-country. He is the only Virginia coach to win the national coach of the year award in two sports. Holdren has compiled 1,227 wins in high school running, including an 80 percent winning percentage in dual meets with a 16-year undefeated streak in girls outdoor track. He has coached 10 national record holders, 56 All- Americans, 115 state champions, and two female sub-five minute mile runners. Holdren also serves as the track and field rules interpreter for the state of Virginia. Holdren was inducted into the Virginia High School Hall of Fame in 1993, and he was inducted into the National High School Coaches Association Hall of Fame on June 28, 2006 in Branson, Mo. Holdren was one of only two coaches in the Richmond area to receive the honor, joining Hopewell basketball coach Bill Littlepage, who was inducted in 1997. Currently, Holdren is the head coach of cross country, indoor track, and outdoor track at the Maggie L. Walker Governor's School for Government and International Studies. During the 2013-2014 school year, Holdren coached the Maggie Walker boys' and girls' teams to VHSL State championships in cross country. The teams inserted 13 of their 14 runners into the all state team. Under his guidance, the boys' team also went on to win the VHSL State Indoor and Outdoor Track titles, while the girls' team won the Indoor title and were runners-up in the Outdoor competition. The Maggie Walker teams once again flourished in the 2014-2015 year under Coach Holdren. Both the boys' and girls' teams won the VHSL 2A State title in cross country, indoor track, and outdoor track, becoming the first school in VHSL to achieve the \\"Triple Crown\\" for both teams in one year.

It is situated approximately south-east of the town of Driffield and lies on the B1249 road. North Frodingham St Elgin's church, North Frodingham The civil parish is formed by the village of North Frodingham and the hamlets of Church End and Emmotland. According to the 2011 UK census, North Frodingham parish had a population of 830, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 712. The Grade II* listed church of St Elgin, North Frodingham was restored in stages between 1877 and 1891 by Sir Tatton Sykes, 5th Baronet with the top part of the perpendicular tower being designed by Temple Moor in 1892. It is on the Sykes Churches Trail devised by the East Yorkshire Churches Group. In 1901 there was a proposal to construct a railway terminus as part of the North Holderness Light Railway, but despite appearing on the North Eastern Railway's tile maps at various stations (including Beverley), the line was never constructed. The Old Howe and North Frodingham beck join to the west of the village. The landing was used until the 1950s for unloading coal transported from Kingston upon Hull. In 1823 North Frodingham was a town and civil parish in the Wapentake and Liberty of Holderness. Baines states that a town market was in disuse because of falling population, its charter having been transferred to the more successful town of Driffield in the 1860s. There were three chapels; one for Methodists, one for Independents, and one for Ranters. Population at the time was 575, including that of Emmotland. Occupations included twenty-two farmers, three blacksmiths, three grocers, one of whom was also a draper, three shoemakers, two tailors, two wheelwrights, two bricklayers, a weaver, a twine maker, a straw hat manufacturer, a plumber & glazier, a book keeper, a schoolmaster, and the landlords of The Red Line, The Star Inn, and The Gate public houses.

Professional career=Pittsburgh Steelers Pinney was selected in the second round of the 1976 NFL Draft (37th overall) by the two- time defending Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers. He played college football at the University of Washington in Seattle under head coaches Jim Owens and Don James and was a team captain for the Huskies in 1974 As a rookie in 1976, Pinney was a backup tackle and appeared in 14 regular season games. he played in 14 regular season games with two starts. Pinney earned the start at right tackle in Super Bowl XIII in January 1979 over Larry Brown, who had been the starter the majority of the season. He earned his first Super Bowl ring in the victory over the Dallas Cowboys. Pinney missed the entire 1979 season due to injuries. Although he was on the roster, he sat in the stands at the Rose Bowl during the Super Bowl XIV, a victory over the Los Angeles Rams. Pinney returned in 1980 but changed position as Brown had solidified himself as the starting right tackle in his absence; he started all 16 regular season games in 1980 at left guard. He began the 1981 season as the Pittsburgh's starting left tackle, winning the job over longtime starter Jon Kolb, and had 11 starts and appeared in all 16 games. During the 1982 season, Pinney started all nine games at left tackle. Michigan Panthers With the upstart USFL coming in fruition, Pinney was targeted along with other Steeler players. He signed with the Michigan Panthers after they had offered him twice his previous salary. He played offensive tackle for them and helped them win the USFL Championship Oakland Invaders After the 1984 season, the Michigan Panthers merged with the Oakland Invaders. Pinney played the 1985 season (spring) with the Invaders until the USFL ceased operations. Return to Pittsburgh Steelers After the USFL folded, Pinney returned to the Pittsburgh Steelers; he cited he was brought back because the Steelers knew he could play and he wasn't a locker room distraction. He resumed his starting left tackle duties from three years earlier and played in 15 games with 11 starts in 1985 and started fifteen games in 1986. In his last season in 1987 at age 33, Pinney played in six games and was hampered by injuries. He had announced that he cleared out his locker at the end of the season, and Steelers' owner notified him by phone that his contract would not be renewed.

Poverty in France has fallen by 60% over thirty years. Although it affected 15% of the population in 1970, in 2001 only 6.1% (or 3.7 million people) were below the poverty line (which, according to INSEE's criteria, is half of the median income). In the mid-Sixties, Jules Klanfer estimated that about 20% of the French population lived in poverty. Lionel Stoleru, in \\"The fight against poverty in the rich countries\\", estimated that 20% of the population lived in poverty in the early Seventies, while Rene Lenior in \\"The Outsiders\\" put the figure at 15%. An OECD study from the early Seventies estimated that 16% of the French population lived in poverty, compared with 13% in the United States, 11% in Canada, 7.5% in the United Kingdom, and 3% in Germany. Other national estimates at the time were 13% (the United States), 11% (Canada), 8% (Australia), 5% (Norway), and 3.5% (Sweden). In 1975, a basic tax-free cash allowance starting at ¬£665 for children under the age of ten provided a considerable amount of support for families living on low incomes, and its combination with direct taxation meant greater support to poor families than in any other country in the EEC. A two- parent family with four dependent children on 66% of average earnings gained an amount after tax and allowances equal to 49.4% of its income compared with 8.2% in the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, that same year, INSEE found that at any wage level disposable income per head was still much lower in large families than those with no or very few children, while the cost of bringing up a family weighed particularly heavily on households headed by a low-paid worker. According to one estimate from the early Seventies, using 1500 francs net per month for those in full-time employment 44% of women and 24.5% of men were low paid. The percentage of workers who were low paid was particularly high in personal services such as hairdressing (74%), hotel and catering (60%) and textiles (51%). In comparison with average French workers, foreign workers tended to be employed in the hardest and lowest-paid jobs and live in poor conditions. A 1972 study found that foreign workers earned 17% less than their French counterparts, although this national average concealed the extent of inequality because foreign workers were more likely to be men in their prime working years in the industrial areas, which generally had higher rates of pay than elsewhere. In 1974, the National Assembly's Commission on Cultural, Family and Social Affairs estimated that 5% of the population should be considered as \\"living in a state of destitution or on the borderline of destitution\\". Studies by Serge Milano, Lionel Stoleru, and Rene Lenoir estimated that between 10% and 14% of the population lived in poverty from 1970 to 1980. A report by the EEC estimated that 14.8% of households in France lived in poverty in 1975, defined as living below the threshold of 50% mean annual income. In 1987, it was estimated that 2 million people in France lived in extreme poverty. Previously, the poor were for the most part retirees. The trend reversed itself in the 1980s with an increase in unemployment among young people; while poverty among the elderly dropped 85% (from 27.3% to 3.8%), among those still in the workforce it increased by 38% over the same 30 years (from 3.9% to 5.4%). Various social welfare programs have had an important impact in low-income households, and in 2002, they may in some cases have represented more than 50% of the household's income. Le rapport de l'Observatoire national de la pauvret√© et de l'exclusion sociale 2003‚Äì2004 , second part and third part . See p. 26 of Part 1. In 2008, the OECD claimed that France was \\"one of only five OECD countries where income inequality and poverty have declined over the past 20 years\\". As a result of the European migrant crisis, beginning in 2015, makeshift and squalid migrant camps have begun regularly appearing around the capital city with French officials routinely clearing and dismantling them as of October 2016. Such camps are also becoming a common occurrence in Northern France, along the coast of La Manche, which migrants hope to cross in an attempt to reach Britain. The Calais Jungle is perhaps the best known example of this. Status in 2005 The poverty threshold was fixed at 645 euros per person per month. By comparison, the revenu minimum d'insertion (RMI, which idea draws on guaranteed minimum income, although it is not distributed to everyone) was at that time 440.86 euros per month for a person living alone. Montant de l'allocation de revenu minimum d'insertion The French poverty threshold is slightly higher than that of the United States,2005 Federal Poverty Guidelines, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, retrieved 15 February 2007 suggesting that some who would be considered living in poverty in France would not be if they had the same income in the United States. However, it is difficult to compare them as they are not calculated in the same way, notwithstanding differences in cost or standards of living. While the French poverty threshold is calculated as being half of the median income, the U.S. poverty threshold is based on dollar costs of the economy food plan, that is, on income inequalityThe Development and History of the U.S. Poverty Thresholds ‚Äì A Brief Overview, by Gordon M. Fisher, US Department of Health and Human Services, GSS/SSS Newsletter (Newsletter of the Government Statistics Section and the Social Statistics Section of the American Statistical Association), Winter 1997, pp. 6‚Äì7 In 2005: * A million children (8%) were living below the poverty line; * 42,000 children were affected by lead poisoning, a sign of decrepit housing; lead-based paint has been banned in new buildings since 1915, to all professionals since 1948, and to everyone since 1993. The risk of exposure to lead today is four times greater for buildings constructed before 1915 than for a building constructed between 1915 and 1948. * 500,000 housing units were unclean. * 200,000 students were in difficult financial situations, which has led some young women to pay for their studies through prostitution. This phenomenon is on the rise in the country (in 2006, the students' union SUD Etudiant estimated the number to be 40,000).La prostitution gagne les bancs de la fac, Le Figaro, 30 October 2006 Nevertheless, social services allow France to have one of the lowest child mortality rates despite this poverty. Despite the positive developments, it seems that rural areas have been attracting more and more of those left behind; a non-negligible segment of at-risk city populations have been moving to the country and joining the ranks of small-time farmers among \\"rural\\" welfare recipients. This phenomenon is partly explained by the lower cost of rural living compared with that in cities.Alexandre Pag√®s (2005), La pauvret√© en milieu rural, Toulouse, Presses Universitaires du Mirail Another indicator of poverty is the RMI. In 1994, in metropolitan France, the number of RMI recipients was 783,436; ten years later (in June 2004), it rose to 1,041,026. In the overseas departments, it was 105,033 at the end of 1994 and 152,892 in June 2004.Les b√©n√©ficiaires du RMI selon la situation familiale, INSEE (Source : Cnaf, fichier FILEAS, donn√©es au 31 d√©cembre 1994 et au 30 juin 2004). Published in June 2004 By 31 December 2005, the figure stood at 1,112,400. From December 2004 to December 2005, the number of RMI recipients increased by 4.7% according to the Secours catholique NGO.STATISTIQUES D‚ÄôACCUEIL 2005 ‚Äì Pauvret√©: facteur d'isolement , Secours catholique  Bidonvilles  Bidonvilles (\\"can towns\\") are shanty towns that exist in the urban outskirts of France and often have little access to roads or public services (such as electricity or access to water). Although once thought to be a phenomenon exclusive to the 1960s and 1970s, bidonvilles again gained attention in the French media in the 2000s. Often populated by immigrants, bidonvilles produce a degree of residential segregation between French nationals and recently arrived immigrant groups at a scale higher than any other western European city in the postwar years.Paul White, \\"Immigrants, immigrant areas, and immigrant communities in postwar Paris,\\" in Migrants in Modern France: Population Mobility in the Later Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, edited by Philip E. Ogden and Paul E. White (Oxon: Routledge, 1989), 198. However, most attention on residential poverty in France is now associated with the Parisian suburbs, or banlieues. In the late 1960s, there were eighty-nine bidonvilles on the outskirts of Paris. During this time, bidonvilles were often associated with immigrant groups from North Africa. However this is partly an exaggerated stereotype, as the largest bidonville of the Paris area in the 1960s (Champigny-sur-Marne) was populated mostly by Portuguese.White, 197. That being said, a Ministry of the Interior census carried out in 1966 suggested that the majority of the 46,827 people living in the 119 Parisian bidonvilles were of North African origin. Other bidonvilles were concentrated north-west of Paris, including near Nanterre, Gennevilliers, Asni√®res, and Colombes. In 1964, the Loi Debr√© sought to eliminate bidonvilles, and the urban formation was erroneously thought to have disappeared in the 1970s with the transformation of Nanterre's bidonville into a modern city. However, a 1973 count estimated at least 8,600 still living in bidonvilles around Paris. First-hand accounts describe the hardship of living in bidonvilles in the 1960s: \\"We live amongst mud and rubbish. There's no difference between us and animals...It's not life that we lead here: even the rats come to eat us...I tell you ‚Äì even the animals live better than we do.\\"From interviews with Tunisians in Ben Sassi (1968), cited in White, 197. A former occupant recalled the emotional legacy of life in the Nanterre bidonville even after its destruction: \\"Now they've got rid of almost all the bidonvilles at Nanterre, but they still exist in our heads and in our thinking. Life in a bidonville is something you never forget.\\"White, 198 However, bidonvilles may have provided certain measures of social freedom and political space for disadvantaged or marginalized groups, albeit at the cost of appalling daily living conditions. For example, established bidonvilles with more experienced immigrant communities could provide a network of support or feeling of solidarity to a newly arrived migrant greater than what they might find in the city center. Despite persistent attempts to rehouse individuals living in bidonvilles (and the more fragmented \\"micro-bidonvilles\\"), they remain a reality in places like Villeurbanne (Lyon), where a bidonville contains 500 persons of Romani origins, a third of them children.Les enfants des bidonvilles font leur rentr√©e scolaire, 20 Minutes (Lyons), 11 October 2006 In February 2007, bulldozers destroyed a bidonville in Bobigny, a northeastern suburb of Paris, where 266 Romanian and Bulgarian citizens had been registered. Another huge bidonville exists near Calais, inhabited by migrants from the Middle-East, North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa hoping to get to the United Kingdom. It has been destroyed several times, but since the people are in France illegally, they have nowhere else to go, and eventually they return to the same place. Bidonvilles are also common in the overseas departments.Quand la France rase ill√©galement maisons et bidonvilles, Radio France Internationale, 28 April 2006  Number of persons in France estimated to be living below the poverty line (1970‚Äì2002)  Poverty rate at 50% 1970 12% 1975 10.2% 1979 8.3% 1984 7.7% 1990 6.6% 1996 7.2% 1998 6.7% 2000 6.5% 2002 6% Poverty rate at 60% line 1970 17.9% 1975 16.6% 1979 14.2% 1984 13.5% 1990 13.8% 1996 13.5% 1998 12.8% 2000 12.7% 2002 12.2%  See also  * Abb√© Pierre * Observatoire National de la Pauvret√© et de l'Exclusion Sociale * Poverty by country  Footnotes References * Report by the Conseil de l'emploi, des revenus et de la coh√©sion sociale (CERC), 17 February 2005 * April 2005 report on poverty in France by Emma√ºs given by its president Martin Hirsch to the ministre des Solidarit√©s, de la Sant√© et de la Famille Philippe Douste-Blazy  Notes  * This article is based on the French Wikipedia article Pauvret√© en France, retrieved 15 February 2007.

Originating in an adaptation of rancher√≠a, a Californian term for the residential area of a rancho, where most farm hands were aboriginal, the term became in British Columbia prior to the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush of 1858, but from then on and in the series of gold rushes and settlement colonization that followed, the term came into wide use throughout the colony. In modern usage it is often a new residential area, but traditionally it is the oldest group of residences, typically log cabins or similar, generally clustered around a church. In some reserves where there is more than one residential area, \\"the rancherie\\" would mean a specific one of the group, typically the oldest. Rancherie does not refer to the whole of a reserve, or of a group of reserves run by a band government, but only to the community area so designated. The term is also in wide use outside of First Nations peoples, and is generally part of the vernacular in most small British Columbia towns with adjacent or contiguous Indian Reserves, with little or no derogatory overtones. The Kanaka Rancherie Historically the term could also be used for certain non- aboriginal (but also non-white, mostly) communities, most notably the Kanaka Rancherie on Vancouver's Lost Lagoon, which was the core of the local Hawaiian community since the earliest days of Gastown, its remnants - also known as the Cherry Orchard - lasting well into the 1920s.

During the following year he successfully avoided several attempts by the elites to establish a junta in Venezuela (among them the famous Conspiraci√≥n de Los Mantuanos), often by personally talking with proponents of the movements. Although a well-liked governor, on 19 April 1810, various members of the municipal council (cabildo) of Caracas and other important residents took advantage of the large crowds gathered for Maundy Thursday services to orchestrate popular agitation for the establishment of a junta. The crowd prevented him from arriving at the Cathedral for the day's services and he was directed to the cabildo building (today site of the Casa Amarilla) just across the main square from the Cathedral. There he met with an expanded council (cabildo abierto). Empar√°n spoke directly to the crowd from the balcony of the building and seeing the amount of support for a junta, he voluntarily stepped down. The cabildo transformed itself into the Supreme Junta of Caracas, and began to manage the affairs of the province. Following his ouster, he left for Philadelphia, United States, from where he reported to the Spanish government on the events of 19 April, before returning to Spain. There, it seems, he was tried for his failure to stop the establishment of a junta, but was acquitted. He died in El Puerto de Santa Mar√≠a, C√°diz, Spain on 3 October 1842.

He went on to play 14 seasons for San Diego where he missed only 8 starts in 163 career games. Macek was known for his durability and the integral role he played on the team's offensive line, which provided cover for Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Fouts through most of the 1980s. That Chargers' offensive line allowed the fewest sacks per pass attempt in the NFL from 1981-1983.

She was also the first woman to win a PGA individual professional tournament. She is currently recognized by Golf for Women as a top 50 female instructor and is a Board Member and Advisor for numerous organizations including Golfer Girl Magazine. She is an LPGA Teaching and Club Professional (T&CP;) member who played on the LPGA Tour in 1993. Whaley's achievement is questioned by some because the regional qualifying tournament she won, the 2002 Connecticut PGA Championship, which gained her a place in the Greater Hartford Open, was aided by her being allowed to play the course off tees 699 yards shorter than the men she competed against in that regional qualifying: she played 6,239 yards, while the men had to play 6,938 yards (a 10% shorter course). This anomaly was addressed later by the PGA, under the \\"Whaley rule\\", introduced in 2003, which requires all entrants at qualifying tournaments, whether male or female, to play off the same tees. In 2014, Whaley became the first female officer in the PGA, as PGA secretary. Personal While at University of North Carolina she played on their golf team.

The Carmelite Monks or Monks of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel is a cloistered contemplative religious community of diocesan right dedicated to a humble life of prayer. They are known for their loyalty to the Magisterium of the Catholic Church and to the ancient traditions of Carmel. Their life includes strict separation from the world and the living of the cloistered Carmelite spirituality and way of life established by St. John of the Cross and St. Teresa of Jesus. In accord with the Carmelite Rule, they engage in manual labor and the study of Carmelite spirituality in the solitude of the mountains, with the firm hope of attaining to Union with God.http://www.carmelitemonks.org Role of Cloistered Monks in Carmel The Carmelite Monks are cloistered Carmelite men who dedicate their lives to prayer and the pursuit of virtue so as to be a hidden leaven of grace for the Church's mission in the world. Their priests are called choir monks since their entire hidden priesthood is devoted to the following: offering daily the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, the chanting of the Divine Office in the choir and pursuing the heights of the mystical life through personal holiness and contemplative prayer. Though they are completely cloistered, they also share the fruits of their solitary lives by hearing confessions and giving spiritual direction to people who may come to the monastery.http://dioscg.org/index.php/springfield-man-professes-perpetual- vows/ As cloistered Carmelites, they are not active friars, but pray for their fellow Carmelites who have that mission. For this reason they do not belong to either the Ancient Observance or Discalced branches of the Carmelite Order. All Carmelites originated as hermit monks, but the main branches of the order have been mendicant friarsGregory Cleary, Friar in Catholic Encyclopedia since the 13th century. In one of the first works of the Carmelite Order, The Institutions of the First Monks, written near the beginning of the order,http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03354a.htm the charism of the Carmelites was laid out as a hidden life of contemplative prayer carried out in the solitary wilderness by a monk. The Carmelite monks follow this same solitary monastic Carmelite charism.http://www.carmelitemonks.org/HistoryCommunity.php Cloistered Carmelite nuns also consider themselves to be cloistered monastic hermits. Their life and the life of the Carmelite Monks' are similar in that both are cloistered Carmelite contemplatives and follow many of the same customs.http://www.phatmass.com/phorum/topic/136952-carmelite-monks-of-wy/ Background of the Community The Carmelite Monks were founded in 2003 by the authority of Bishop David Ricken, D.D., J.C.L. in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cheyenne, Wyoming, with Fr. Daniel Mary of Jesus Crucified, M. Carm.Fr. Daniel Mary Schneider as the first and founding Prior of the community. Fr. Daniel Mary was trained for eleven years in a hermitage of the Ancient Observance and through a close relationship with several houses of cloistered discalced Carmelite Nuns. Fr. Daniel Mary was clothed as a Carmelite by members of the order and lived in vows in a house of the order for many years. The Carmelite Monks use the suffix M.Carm. to designate membership in their order, which is the abbreviation of the Latin words Monachi Carmeli. This means \\"Monks of Carmel\\" in English. Charism The Carmelite Monks' spirituality and life are based on four pillars that are essential to their identity. The first pillar is filial union with the Blessed Virgin;http://carmelitemonks.org/UnionWithMary.php the second, the Rule of St. Albert;http://carmelitemonks.org/Rule.php the third, the traditional Carmelite Liturgy,http://carmelitemonks.org/CarmeliteRite.php and the fourth, the Carmelite spirituality and monastic inspiration of the way of life of St. Teresa of Jesus and St. John of the Cross.http://carmelitemonks.org/CarmeliteSpirituality.php A young Carmelite Monk, Br. Simon Mary, described his community's charism in this way in a 2008 interview: > Carmelite monks are consecrated to God through the vows of obedience, > chastity, and poverty.

They do not simply use elements taken from the Carmelite Rite, as do the Carmelite Hermits of the Blessed Virgin Mary , who experiment with the liturgy according to the needs of their hermits. The Carmelite Rite, based on the Rite of the Holy Sepulchre, was used by the Ancient Observance branch of the Carmelite Order from the time of the first hermits on Mount Carmel in the Holy Land in the late 12th century, until Vatican II at which time the Carmelites began to celebrate the ordinary form of the Roman Rite Mass. The first Rule of Carmel was given to the Carmelites by Saint Albert of Jerusalem, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, who in that time was exiled in the city of Acre, Israel, from which place Mount Carmel was visible to the south. New Mount Carmel thumbnail Separation from the world for contemplative prayer is essential to the life of the Carmelite Monks,http://www.carmelitemonks.org/HistoryCommunity.php their monasteries are founded in the mountains to ensure geographical enclosure.http://www.newmountcarmelfoundation.org/vision.php In modern times where noise abounds, the monks desire true silence and an atmosphere of natural solitude. The monks explain how the mountains provide this: \\"In the mountains, often wild and remote, the soul can make a swift journey towards union with God; the beauty of the wilderness alone raises the mind and heart to the Eternal Father who created the things of this world. In the mountains the Carmelite monks will at last be in a place conducive to their life and in keeping with their Holy Rule.\\"http://www.newmountcarmelfoundation.org/property.php Thus Carmelite Monks have founded the New Mount Carmel, where the original Carmelite charism is being lived in the mountains of Wyoming. This reflects the continual effort of Carmelites throughout the centuries to return to the eremitical life of a hermit in the mountains in imitation of Elijah from the Book of Kings in the Old Testament.

The highly classified program attempted to extend the monsoon season over specific areas of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, in order to disrupt North Vietnamese military supplies by softening road surfaces and causing landslides. The former U.S. Secretary of Defense, Robert S. McNamara, was aware that there might be objections raised by the international scientific community but said in a memo to the president that such objections had not in the past been a basis for prevention of military activities considered to be in the interests of U.S. national security. The chemical weather modification program was conducted from Thailand over Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam and allegedly sponsored by Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and CIA without the authorization of then Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird who had categorically denied to Congress that a program for modification of the weather for use as a tactical weapon even existed. Build up A report titled Rainmaking in SEASIA outlines use of lead iodide and silver iodide deployed by aircraft in a program that was developed in California at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake and tested in Okinawa, Guam, Philippines, Texas, and Florida in a hurricane study program called Project Stormfury. Project Popeye was the experiment in increased rainfall through cloud seeding leading up to Operation Popeye. The technical aspects of the experiment were verified by Dr. Donald F. Hornig, Special Assistant to the President of the United States for Science and Technology. During October 1966, Project Popeye was tested in a strip of the Laos panhandle east of the Bolovens Plateau in the Se Kong River valley. The government of Laos was not informed of the project, its methods, or its goals. The test was conducted by personnel from the Naval Ordnance Test Station located at China Lake California. The results of this specific experiment are unknown, but other less surreptitious cloud seeding tests have been conducted. Objectives Operation Popeye's goal was to increase rainfall in carefully selected areas to deny the Vietnamese enemy, namely military supply trucks, the use of roads by: # Softening road surfaces # Causing landslides along roadways # Washing out river crossings # Maintaining saturated soil conditions beyond the normal time span. Implementation The 54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron carried out the operation using the slogan \\"make mud, not war.\\" Starting on March 20, 1967, and continuing through every rainy season (March to November) in Southeast Asia until 1972, operational cloud seeding missions were flown. Three C-130 Hercules aircraft and two F-4C Phantom aircraft based at Udon Thani Royal Thai Air Force Base in Thailand flew two sorties per day. The aircraft were officially on weather reconnaissance missions and the aircraft crews as part of their normal duty also generated weather report data. The crews, all from the 54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, were rotated into the operation on a regular basis from Guam. Inside the squadron, the rainmaking operations were code-named \\"Motorpool\\".THE AIR WEATHER RECONNAISSANCE ASSOCIATION GALLERY FOR JANUARY 2005 The initial area of operations was the eastern half of the Laotian panhandle. On 11 July 1967, the operational area was increased northward to around the area of the 20th parallel and included portions of far western North Vietnam. In September 1967, the A Shau Valley in South Vietnam was added to the operational area. Operations over North Vietnam were eliminated on April 1, 1968, concurrent with conventional bombing restrictions being put into effect. The southern region of North Vietnam was added to the operational area on September 25, 1968, and then removed on November 1 of that year concurrent with a halt to conventional bombing of North Vietnam. In 1972, most of northeastern Cambodia was added to the operational area. All rainmaking operations ceased on July 5, 1972. Public revelation Reporter Jack Anderson published a story in March 1971 concerning Operation Popeye (though in his column, it was called Intermediary-Compatriot). The name Operation Popeye (Pop Eye) entered the public space through a brief mention in the Pentagon Papers and a July 3, 1972, article in the New York Times. Operations in Laos ceased two days after the publication of the Times article. The press stories led to demands from members of the U.S. Congress, led by Senator Claiborne Pell, for more information. U.S. House and Senate resolutions in favor of banning environmental warfare were passed as Senate Resolution 71 on July 11, 1973, H.R. 116 of 1974, H.R. 329 of 1974 and H.R. 28 of 1975.

It was likely written in the late 12th century. Marie claims it to be a Breton lai, an example of Anglo-Norman literature. Plot summary Le Fresne begins with two wedded knights. The wife of one knight gives birth to twins, and upon hearing a message to that effect, the other wife declares that in order to have two children at one time, a woman must have slept with two men. Many consider this comment to be slanderous, and the husband of the woman who gave birth to twins shuts her away. Appropriately, the wife who made the comment about twins being a mark of adultery gives birth, in turn to twin daughters. More willing to make amends with God than shame herself, the wife plans to secretly kill the extra child and deny its existence. A handmaiden offers to hide it instead. After an ornate brocade is tied to the baby's arm signifying its noble birth, the handmaiden leaves it under an ash tree outside of an abbey. A porter finds the girl and names her Le Fresne (modern French fr√™ne, \\"ash tree\\"), and gives her to a gentle abbess to raise. Le Fresne grows into an exceedingly beautiful woman, and a respected lord named Gurun becomes enamored of her. Gurun makes a great donation to the abbey as an excuse for his constant visits, and secretly gains the love of Le Fresne. Fearing the wrath of the abbess if Le Fresne became pregnant in her house, Gurun convinces her to run away with him, making her his concubine. Gurun's knights become concerned that if he does not marry a noblewoman for the sake of a legitimate heir, his lands and lineage will be lost upon his death. They find a noble and beautiful woman named La Coudre (modern French coudrier, \\"hazel tree\\"). Gurun's knights convince him that for the sake of carrying on his noble lineage, he should marry La Coudre instead of Le Fresne, creating a metaphor of the fertile hazel tree and the barren ash. The marriage is planned. While La Codre's mother originally plans to move Le Fresne as far away from Gurun as possible, she discovers upon meeting her that Le Fresne is very kind and then wishes her no harm. The night of the wedding, Le Fresne helps to prepare the wedding bed, for she knows how Gurun likes things. Not finding it sufficiently beautiful, she adds her brocade to the wedding bed. This is discovered by the mother of La Codre, who recognizes that the brocade is her own, and that Le Fresne is the twin sister of La Codre whom they had abandoned at birth. The family welcomes Le Fresne. Though the marriage of La Codre and Gurun is finished, it was annulled the next day. Le Fresne and Gurun marry, a husband is found for La Codre, and all characters end up happy. Motifs The motifs of Le Fresne are found in popular ballads, both in English and Scandinavian form, such as Fair Annie. The popular tales more often feature a heroine who was kidnapped by pirates when young and ransomed by the hero, thus ending as ignorant of her birth as this heroine.Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v 2, p 67-8, Dover Publications, New York 1965 The ring which identifies Le Fresne as a particular person of high birth is a motif that, according to Michelle Freeman, Marie may have gotten from the Roman d'En√©as, the twelfth-century version of the Aeneas legend that Marie was very familiar with. The child is abandoned immediately after birth, as is the practice in medieval literature, such as Sir Degar√©; this may reflect pre-Christian practices, both Scandinavian and Roman, that the newborn would not be raised without the father's decision to do so.Barbara A. Hanawalt, The Ties That Bound: Peasant Families in Medieval England p172 It shows no influence of courtly love; so far from regarding his love as important, Gurun shows no remorse about abandoning it for a lawful marriage.Laura A. Hibbard, Medieval Romance in England p298 New York Burt Franklin,1963 Le Fresne, also, shows no signs of conflict, gently yielding her place and even serving her successor.Laura A. Hibbard, Medieval Romance in England p298-9 New York Burt Franklin,1963 The idea equating twins with infidelity was a common folkloric belief at the time.Marie de France, \\"Les Lais de Marie de France\\", p. 91, traduits et annot√©s par Harf-Lancner, L., Livre de Poche 1990. It also appears in other chivalric romances, such as the Swan-Children of the Knight of the Swan, in the variant Beatrix.Laura A. Hibbard, Medieval Romance in England p242 New York Burt Franklin,1963 But as in those romances, it is treated as the result of envy and slander and so denounced.Lay le Freine: Introduction, Edited by Anne Laskaya and Eve Salisbury, Originally Published in The Middle English Breton Lays Kalamazoo, Michigan: Medieval Institute Publications, 1995 The hazel tree also makes an appearance in both La√ºstic and Chevrefoil, two of Marie's other Lais.

Background and content Skinny Puppy's seventh album, Last Rights, was originally going to end with the song \\"Left Handshake\\", which prominently featured a number of samples of Timothy Leary's voice from his 1967 release Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out. Because so many clips of Leary speaking were employed in the song, Skinny Puppy sought him out to ask for permission to use the sound bites. Leary agreed, and so the song was completed. Shortly after that, Henry G. Saperstein, the holder of the rights to the album from which Leary's voice was sampled, threatened to sue the band if they released \\"Left Handshake\\".

GENI's focus is on the interconnection of electric power transmission networks between nations and continents, emphasizing tapping abundant renewable energy resources, and utilizing the efficiencies of seasonal, time of day, and load differences around the world.  Renewable Energy Interconnected Global Grid  GENI's goal is to educate world leaders and policy makers on the benefits of this global strategy. The concept of an interconnected global grid linked to renewable resources was first suggested by Buckminster Fuller in the World Game simulation in the 1970s. Fuller concluded that this strategy is the highest priority of the World Game simulation, (see page 206 of Fuller's book Critical Path (1981, ). GENI has organized international workshops on international electricity transmission grids and coordinated workshops on renewable energy generation, the latter hosted by the IEEE Power Engineering Society. GENI is one of the original members of American Council on Renewable Energy and has been a regular presence at the World Energy Congress, held internationally every 3 years. GENI has stated that one reason technologies to accelerate the use of renewable energy and to avert climate change were not making headway in the marketplace has been the lack of ways for investors to track and easily invest in these technologies. Because of this, in 2004, GENI partnered with KLD, who creates socially conscious investing stock indexes in the US, to create the KLD Global Climate 100 stock index. The index became available for investment in Japan in 2005 and in the U.S. on April 24, 2007.  Research  GENI's research includes information about national electricity power grids; location and availability of renewable energy resources; international integrated energy models; current national energy usage (by fuel type) and global issues that are addressed by the GENI concept, such as international relations, human security, peace and disarmament, the environment, conflict and development, and global health.

Charlotte von Kirschbaum was born in Ingolstadt. In 1916 her father died in the war, which inspired her to be trained as a nurse. In 1924 she met Karl Barth, and initially became his pupil and later contributed to all of Karl Barth's academic publications. Relationship with Karl Barth and Nelly Hoffman-Barth Charlotte von Kirschbaum and Barth met at the University of G√∂ttingen in 1924, when she was 25 years old, at the time she was a Red Cross nurse and had an interest in theology and economically destitute. Charlotte von Kirschbaum was introduced to Karl Barth and his writings in the early 1920s. By 1929 she was working full-time for Barth as a secretary and assistant preparing his lectures. In October 1929 she moved into the Barth household with Barth's wife Nelly and children to continue academic theological work, where she remained until 1966. Charlotte and Barth cowrote the Church Dogmatics and many other theological works while she resided in the Barth household, and Barth's children referred to her as \\"Aunt Lollo\\". Charlotte von Kirschbaum's presence in the Barth household resulted in duress in the family at times, and has been a matter of vast speculation. However, after Karl Barth had died, Nelly Barth continued to visit Charlotte von Kirschbaum in the hospital.  Church Dogmatics  Charlotte von Kirschbaum coauthored the Church Dogmatics with Karl Barth. Although she is not listed as an author on the published works, Karl Barth admits that the Church Dogmatics would not have been written without her in the preface to CD III/3 he wrote: > \\"I should not like to conclude this Preface without expressly drawing the > attention of readers of these seven volumes to what they and I owe to the > twenty years of work quietly accomplished at my side by Charlotte von > Kirschbaum. She has devoted no less of her life and powers to the growth of > this work than I have myself. Without her co-operation it could not have > been advanced from day to day, and I should hardly dare contemplate the > future which may yet remain to me. I know what it really means to have a > helper.\\" Work with Karl Barth For the sake of the work she learned Latin, Greek and Hebrew. She also attended the philosophical lectures of Heinrich Scholz. She made an important contribution to the production of Barth's Church Dogmatics. In 1935 Barth moved to Basel, Switzerland, followed by Charlotte. From there they supported the German Resistance. Theological work In 1949 her theological book Die wirkliche Frau (The Real Woman) was published. It discussed the role of women. End of life and burial Charlotte von Kirschbaum, H√∂rnli Cemetery (Friedhof am H√∂rnli), Basel In the early 1962, Charlotte von Kirschbaum became ill and moved to a nursing home in Riehen, and was hospitalized for the rest of her life and she died ten years later.

Although the exact definition of what constitutes an \\"antique firearm\\" varies between countries, the advent of smokeless powder or the start of the Boer War are often used as cut-off dates. Antique firearms are usually collected because of their historical interest and/or their monetary value. Categories Antique firearms can be divided into two basic types: muzzle-loading and cartridge firing. Muzzleloading antique firearms are not generally owned with the intent of firing them (although original muzzleloaders can be safely fired, after having them thoroughly inspected), but instead are usually owned as display pieces or for their historic value. Cartridge-firing antique firearms are more commonly encountered as shooting pieces, but most antiques made from the 1860s through the 1880s were made with relatively mild steel and were designed to use black powder. They were limited to low bullet velocities and had heavily arcing \\"rainbow\\" bullet trajectories. However, advances in steel metallurgy and the advent of mass-produced smokeless powder in the early 1890s gave cartridge rifles of this new era much higher velocities and much flatter trajectories than their predecessors. These advances, typified by cartridges such as 8mm Lebel ( 1886 ), 7√ó57mm Mauser, .303 British, and 7.62√ó54mmR made many smokeless powder rifles manufactured in the 1890s quite capable of accurate shooting at long distances. Many antique smokeless powder cartridge firearms from the 1890s can still compete satisfactorily in target shooting events alongside their modern counterparts.Flayderman (2007) p.93 British shotguns made between 1861 and 1890 represent some of the finest examples of custom gunmaking from Europe. Collectibility Antique cartridge firearms are highly sought by collectors and shooters. This trend began in the 1950s as before World War 2, antique firearm collecting was not very popular.Flayderman (2007)pp. 15-16 Collecting grades differ between modern firearms and antiques due to their age. For example, a modern firearm retaining 90% of its finish may be considered \\"Very Good\\" condition, yet an antique firearm can be classed the same as having 80% of its finish. Prices Given their scarcity, the prices of antique firearms have steadily risen. Some highly desired brands such as Colt and Winchester Repeating Arms Company have tripled or quadrupled in value in recent years. Current prices are best monitored by comparing prices at gun shows, auctions, websites, and by checking references such as \\"The Blue Book of Used Gun Values.\\" Collectors also find gun auction catalogs, along with their accompanying \\"prices realized\\" sheets, particularly useful. Some auction houses, such as James D.Julia, publish photos, descriptions, and realized prices on their websites. Having provenance can greatly improve prices. The three main criteria for value are: rarity, condition, and provenance. Legality Gun control laws vary widely from country to country. Several nations such as Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Norway, the UK and the United States make special exceptions in their gun laws for antique firearms.Rawles, James Wesley (February 21, 2009). \\"The Pre-1899 Antique Guns FAQ\\". SurvivalBlog.com. The \\"threshold\\" or \\"cut-off\\" years defining \\"antique\\" vary considerably. The threshold is pre-1898 in Canada, pre-1899 in the United States, and pre-1901 in Australia. Some countries like England exempt certain antiques but they do not set a specific threshold year. In the United States the ATF has the National Firearms Act Definition as: For the purposes of the National Firearms Act, the term ‚ÄúAntique Firearms‚Äù means any firearm manufactured in or before 1898 (including any matchlock, flintlock, percussion cap or similar type of ignition system or replica thereof, whether actually manufactured before or after the year 1898) Australia Single-shot or double-barrel muzzleloading firearms manufactured before January 1, 1901, are considered antique firearms in all States of Australia, and can be legally purchased, used and owned. Victoria and Queensland do not require people to have a licence for them. Cartridge- loading firearms manufactured prior to January 1, 1901, may or may not be considered \\"antique\\", depending on the commercial availability of ammunition. For example, a Martini‚ÄìEnfield rifle manufactured in 1896 would NOT be considered antique in any state of Australia, as it is chambered in .303 British, a calibre which is still commercially manufactured and readily available to most of Australia's 2.0 million gun owners. Conversely, firearms manufactured after January 1, 1901, are not considered antiques, even if they are replicas of antique firearms (such as modern reproductions of black-powder guns), or if ammunition is no longer commercially available (such as the Arisaka Type 38 Rifle) Antique cap & ball revolvers require licensing in all states except Queensland and Victoria, where an individual may possess such a firearm without a license, so long as it is registered with the police. Argentina All muzzleloading black-powder firearms are free to sale and possess, new or old. All kinds of mobile (i.e. revolver) and static (i.e. cannons) guns and ammo made up to 1870 inclusive are free to sale, buy and collect. Belgium As non-licensed weapons for the purposes of Article 3, ¬ß 2, 2, of the Arms Act are considered weapons of a historical, folkloric or decorative value: 1 ¬∞, That are loaded through the breach, the muzzle or from the front of the cylinder are charged only with black powder or cartridges with black powder and separate ignition loaded, whose model or the patent dates back to 1890 and manufactured before 1945 2 ¬∞ using only cartridges with ignition, loaded with black powder, of which the model or the patent dates from 1890 and were produced pre-1945; 3 ¬∞ using cartridges with smokeless powder and that are listed in Annex 1 of the decree of 29 December 2006. 4 ¬∞ produced before 1897 or for which ammunition is no longer in production. Canada An Antique Webley Mk I .455 Revolver, circa 1887 In Canada antique firearms are defined under Section 84(1) of the Criminal Code and Regulations Prescribing Antique Firearms, SOR/98-464 as any firearm manufactured before 1898: * not designed to fire rim-fire or centre-fire cartridges (e.g. flintlock, wheellock, matchlock, cap and ball), * capable of only firing rim-fire cartridges other than .22 Short, .22 Long and .22 Long Rifle, * rifles capable of firing centre-fire cartridges with a bore of less than 8.3 mm, except for repeating rifles fed by any type of cartridge magazine, * shotguns capable of firing centre-fire cartridges, except for 10, 12, 16, 20, 28 gauge and .410, and, * handguns capable of firing centre-fire cartridges, except for .32 Short Colt, .32 Long Colt, .32 S&W;, .32 S&W; Long, .32-20 Winchester, .38 S&W;, .38 Short Colt, .38 Long Colt, .38-40 Winchester, .44-40 Winchester, and .45 Colt. For example, the Webley Mk I qualifies as an antique firearm in Canada because it was manufactured prior to 1898 and was designed to use Webley .455 (Mk I) calibre ammunition. These revolvers were used by both the police and the military in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and are now sought-after examples of antique Canadiana. The threshold for antique status being one year earlier (1898) than in the United States (1899) is a minor source of confusion for antique gun collectors and dealers in North America. Czech Republic Czech Arms Act considers historic firearms as category D weapons, therefore freely available to persons over 18 years of age. Historic weapon is defined as a \\"firearm manufactured at latest on December 31, 1890, and also all its main parts were manufactured no later than December 31, 1890\\". Ammunition for such weapons can legally be acquired under the same conditions. Finland In Finland, black-powder weapons manufactured before 1890 are exempt from licensing requirements, unless they are actually used for shooting. The Ministry of the Interior has authority to issue secondary legislation to release other kinds of historically valuable antique firearms from licensing requirements.https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1998/19980001#L2P19 The Netherlands Exempt are the following weapons (leaving out items that are not relevant in this context): b. All firearms produced before January 1, 1870 c. Rifles, shotguns, revolvers, pistols and combination-firearms designed and destined to be loaded with: 1) Loose balls and black powder, or 2) Cartridges, not being rimfire cartridges in caliber .22 or centrefire cartridges d. Rifles, shotguns and pistols (not being revolvers) designed and destined to be loaded with cartridges of which the propellant consists of black powder or only priming compound, except rimfire cartridges in caliber .22 with a cartridge length or more than 18mm e. Artillery pieces designed and destined to be loaded with loose projectiles and black powder, loose or in bagcharges The exemption mentioned in points c, d and e only applies to weapons produced before January 1, 1945. Notes: Point b, c.1), c.2), d and e are separate groups, the criteria are not cumulative Please note that point c.2) does NOT take into consideration what powder is used. Only the obsolete ignition system of the cartridge is the deciding factor. Point d. means that, in black-powder caliber .22 rf, only calibers .22 CB, .22 BB and .22 short are allowed. .22 long, lr and WRF are not. Specific types of weapons are mentioned in the law. That means that the exemption does not apply to other types of weapons. A pinfire rifle may be free but a pinfire trapgun is not, a muzzleloading cannon from the American civil war is free but a Gatling model 1873 is not. Norway In 2008 a new Norwegian firearms law re-defined an \\"antique\\" as any black powder firearm produced before 1890, or one that is chambered in a caliber the Crown (Norwegian Department of Justice) considers obsolete. Poland Firearms manufactured before 1885 that are separately loaded (not using cartridges) and replicas of such weapons, do not require a license. Spain Firearms manufactured before 1870 are considered exempt antiques under Article 107 of the Regulations on Arms.Report on the implementation of the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, December 2003 Sweden Firearms manufactured before 1890 and that do not support \\"gas tight\\" cartridges (gast√§t enhetspatron) are considered antique and do not require a license, under Sweden's 1996 gun law (1996:67). Switzerland Firearms manufactured prior to 1870 are considered exempt antiques under Article 2, alinea 3 of the Federal Gunlaw (amendment 2008-12-12). United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, antique firearms are exempt from most controls, but the definition of \\"antique\\" in Section 58(2) of the Firearms Act 1968 is vague. Interpretation of the law is often left up to local police officials. However, guidance was issued by the Home Office in paragraph 2.7 of 'Firearms Law: Guidance to the Police' in 1989, suggesting that a range of vintage firearms might be considered for 'antique' status ('vintage' for those purposes means manufactured before 1939). Following advice from the Firearms Consultative Committee (FCC), the Government issued further guidance in a circular letter to chief officers on 19 November 1992, as follows: > The provisions of the Firearms Acts 1968 to 1997 do not apply to any antique > firearm held as a curiosity or ornament. The word 'antique' is not defined > in the Act, but it is suggested that the categories below should be used as > a guide in deciding whether a particular firearm might be considered an > 'antique' for these purposes. Part I: Old weapons which should benefit from > exemption as antiques under section 58 (2) of the Firearms Act 1968 a) All > muzzle-loading firearms; b) Breech-loading firearms capable of discharging a > rim-fire cartridge other than 4mm, 5mm, .22\\" or .23\\" (or their metric > equivalents), 6mm or 9mm rimfire; c) Breech-loading firearms using ignition > systems other than rimfire and centrefire (These include pin-fire and > needle-fire ignition systems, as well as the more obscure lip fire, cup- > primed, teat fire and base fire systems); d) Breech-loading centre-fire arms > originally chambered for one of the obsolete cartridges listed in Annex B > and which retain their original chambering; e) Vintage (pre 1939) rifles, > shotguns and punt guns chambered for the following cartridges expressed in > imperial measurements: 32 bore, 24 bore, 14 bore, 10 bore (‚Öù\\" and 2‚Öû\\" only), > 8 bore, 4 bore, 3 bore, 2 bore, 1‚Öõ bore, 1¬º bore and 1¬Ω bore, and vintage > punt guns and shotguns with bores of 10 or greater. Note (i) - The exemption > does not apply to ammunition, and the possession of live ammunition suitable > for use with an otherwise antique firearm will normally indicate that the > firearm is not possessed as a curio or ornament. Note (ii) - The exemption > does not apply to firearms of modern manufacture which otherwise conform to > the description above. Fully working modern firing replicas of muzzle- > loading and breech-loading firearms, for example those used to fire blanks > by historical re-enactment societies but capable of firing live ammunition, > must be held on certificate. For these purposes, 'modern manufacture' should > be taken to mean manufacture after the outbreak of the Second World War in > 1939. Old weapons which should not benefit from the exemption as antiques > under section 58(2) of the Firearms Act 1968 NB: This list is not exhaustive > and there may be other types and calibres of firearms that should be > considered 'modern' rather than 'antique'. a) Shotguns and smooth-bored > guns, including shot pistols, chambered for standard shotgun cartridges, .22 > inch, .23 inch, 6mm and 9mm rim-fire cartridges;). b) Rifles and handguns > chambered for 4mm, 5mm, .22 inch, .23 inch, 6mm or 9mm rim-fire ammunition; > c) Revolvers, single-shot pistols and self-loading pistols which are > chambered for, and will accept, popular centre-fire cartridges of the type > .25, .32, .38, .380, .44, .450, .455 and .476 inch, or their metric > equivalents including 6.35, 7.62, 7.63, 7.65 , 8 and 9mm, unless otherwise > specified; d) Modern reproduction firearms or old firearms which have been > modified to allow the use of shotgun cartridges or cartridges not listed in > Annex B; e) Extensively modified weapons (e.g. Sawn off shotguns); f) Very > signalling pistols chambered for 1 and 1¬Ω inch cartridges or 26.5/27mm > cartridges; g) Pump-action and self-loading centre fire rifles, except that > examples originally chambered for one of the obsolete cartridges listed at > Annex B and retaining that original chambering, may benefit from exemption > as antiques under section 58(2) of the Firearms Act 1968 (as amended) United States Under the United States Gun Control Act of 1968, any cartridge firearm made in or before 1898 (\\"pre-1899\\") is classified as an \\"antique\\", and is generally outside of Federal jurisdiction, as administered and enforced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE). The only exceptions to the Federal exemption are antique machineguns (such as the Maxim gun and Colt Model 1895 \\"Potato Digger\\") and shotguns firing shotgun shells that are classified as \\"short barreled\\" per the U.S. Gun Control Act of 1968, namely cartridge rifles with a barrel less than 16 inches long, or shotguns firing shotgun shells with a barrel less than 18 inches long, or either cartridge rifles or shotgun-shell-firing shotguns with an overall length of less than 26 inches. Modern muzzleloading replicas of antique guns are not subject to Federal jurisdiction and are essentially classified the same as an antique firearm. Hence, a muzzleloading black-powder shotgun is not subject to the short-barreled National Firearms Act of 1934 restrictions. Purchases of such modern-day manufactured replicas may be done outside of the normal Federal Firearms License (FFL) restrictions that otherwise exist when purchasing modern (post-1898) firearms. Modern replicas of firearms that can fire fixed ammunition, however, are not classed the same as antiques, but must be shipped through FFL holders, although a true antique that was manufactured prior to 1899 firing the same cartridge as the replica would be legal for sale without the transfer being processed through an FFL. Furthermore, any rifle re-built on a receiver or frame that was manufactured prior to 1899 is considered antique, even if it has been re-barreled or even if every other part has been replaced. The following is an excerpt from the portion of the Gun Control Act of 1968 (which modified Title 18, U.S. Code) that exempted pre-1899 firearms from the Federal Firearms License paperwork requirements administered by the ATF: > 18 USC 921 (a)(16). (A) any firearm (including any firearm with a matchlock, > flintlock, percussion cap, or similar type of ignition system) manufactured > in or before 1898; and (B) any replica of any firearm described in > subparagraph (A) if such replica -- (i) is not designed or redesigned for > using rimfire or conventional centerfire fixed ammunition, or (ii) uses > rimfire or conventional centerfire fixed ammunition which is no longer > manufactured in the United States and which is not readily available in the > ordinary channels of commercial trade. Within the United States, antique exemptions vary considerably from state to state. =Identifying pre-1899 antiques= The production of many cartridge firearms, such as the famous Winchester Model 1894 lever-action rifle took place both before and after the December 31, 1898, cut-off date that delineates exempt antique status under U.S. law. Therefore, collectors rely on published reliable references such as The Pre-1899 Antique Guns FAQ by James Wesley Rawles to determine if a particular firearm's serial number falls within the range of \\"antique\\" (pre-1899) production. For example, a Winchester Model 1894 with serial number 147,685 had its frame (or \\"receiver\\") made in December 1898 and it is hence classified as an \\"antique\\", but records show that a Winchester Model 1894 with serial number 147,686 had its frame made in January, 1899 and it is hence classified as \\"modern\\" by the BATFE. Since it is the date of manufacture of the receiver that is relevant to identifying a firearm as antique or modern, it is possible to have a weapon with date marks post-1898 but still be considered an antique firearm. For example, some Finnish M39 (Ukko-Pekka) Mosin‚ÄìNagant rifles with hexagonal profile receivers are considered antique because some were built on receivers dated pre-1899, even though the rifle itself was adopted in 1939. Many of these were assembled using a mix of old round and \\"hex\\" receivers from then on, until as late as the 1970s. To be identified as pre-1899, however, Mosin‚ÄìNagants that have been re-barreled must be disassembled to see the date stamps on their tangs. A similar situation exists for 7.65mm Mauser Turkish Model 1893 bolt actions, most of which were re-arsenalized at the Ankara arsenal in the 1940s, and rechambered to 8√ó57mm Mauser. Despite this re-arsenalization and rechambering, they are still considered antiques under US law as all rifles of that model were manufactured between 1893 and 1896. Likewise, all firearms produced by Ludwig Loewe & Co. A.G., which are marked \\"Ludwig Loewe\\" or \\"Loewe, Berlin\\", are antiques. This is because Ludwig Loewe was merged into Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken in 1897, and the Loewe name was no longer used after the merger. In United States vs. Kirvan, the defendant used a replica of an antique .44 caliber black powder revolver in several bank robberies. He was eventually arrested, and was charged with \\"bank robbery\\", \\"armed bank robbery\\", and \\"carrying or using a firearm in connection with a crime of violence\\". Kirvan was convicted of bank robbery and armed bank robbery, but the firearms charge was dropped before trial by the prosecution. However, during his sentencing hearing, the probation department recommended a five- level upward adjustment to his sentence due to the use of a firearm, instead of a three-level adjustment for brandishing a dangerous weapon. Kirvan appealed the five-level adjustment, arguing that the antique replica weapon was not a \\"firearm\\" for sentencing purposes. However, the appellate court stated, \\"...An armed robbery is no less serious by virtue of the fact that the culprit happened to brandish an old or valuable pistol instead of a new one, although the crime might be more exotic or newsworthy...\\", held that an antique gun was a ‚Äúfirearm‚Äù for purposes of the sentencing enhancement, and affirmed the increased sentence., United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit.

Everard graduated with a BA in psychology from Victoria University of Wellington and worked for 19 years as a writer, editor and director at the National Film Unit. He directed films such as Margan‚Äôs Musical Move (1971) in which he captured the drama of classical music by filming tanks firing shells, and with John King, Sam Pillsbury and Paul Maunder, Games ‚Äò74, a documentary about the 1974 Commonwealth Games held in Christchurch. His film Score, which set slow-motion footage of French rugby players to the music of Tchaikovsky, won a jury prize at the Montreal Film Festival. Everard was appointed New Zealand‚Äôs seventh Chief Censor in February 1984. In an interview with Gordon Campbell published in the New Zealand Listener later that year, Everard explained that he did not think that the Chief Censor should be a defender of public morals or a defender of civil liberties. Instead he should be a referee ‚Äúbetween a part of the public that wants to inflict its tastes and norms onto another section of the public. Other sections of the public want to inflict their desires and wishes onto the movie industry. Sections of the movie industry are wanting to exploit various sections of the public to get the money out of their back pockets. . . . And you‚Äôre sitting in the middle, trying to keep the peace.‚ÄùGordon Campbell, \\"A screen for society\\", New Zealand Listener, 24 November 1984, p19, on file at the Office of Film and Literature Classification After passing the film I Spit on Your Grave in 1984, Everard‚Äôs tenure as Chief Censor was marked by attacks from Women Against Pornography and the Society for the Promotion of Community Standards ( the conservative Christian lobby group headed by Patricia Bartlett ), both of which campaigned for his removal. Women Against Pornography in particular called for ‚Äúhis resignation and the establishment of an independent tribunal of women to replace him.‚ÄùWomen Against Pornography pamphlet \\"Slam the Door on Pornography Sack Everard\\" on file at the Office of Film and Literature Classification Eventually, Parliament passed the Films Amendment Act in 1990 to impose a limit of six consecutive years on the length of time a person could remain Chief Censor, effectively forcing Everard from office in 1991. This provision remained in legislation describing the tenure and functions of the Chief Censor until it was repealed by the Films, Videos and Publications Amendment Act on 24 March 1999 while Bill Hastings was Acting Chief Censor. Everard resumed making films after stepping down as Chief Censor, notably Gottfried Lindauer in New Zealand, about the nineteenth century painter of Maori portraits, and with Bronwen Stewart and Brian Lennane, To live in the city 24 years on, a 1991 documentary that traced the progress of four adults who were featured in a 1967 film about a Maori Affairs Department pre- employment scheme for young rural Maori. He also wrote record reviews for newspapers and the New Zealand Listener and is currently the science and technology correspondent for a wine and spirits industry publication.

He was president of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America from February 1988 to 1995. Early life Lucassen was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Erling and Clara Lucassen in 1927. His parents were both Norwegian immigrants. His father was a unionized carpenter, and his mother a unionized garment worker. Lucassen was rarely called by his full first name, and most people referred to him as \\"Sig\\" or \\"Siggy.\\" When the Great Depression began in 1929, the Lucassens moved about south to Long Branch, New Jersey, a small beach town on the Jersey Shore. Although his father often was out of work, his mother (a member of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union) continued to hold a full-time job and support Sigurd, his father and his brothers. Lucassen went to work stacking fish in an ice house when he was nine years old. Despite having to work, he continued to attend school. He played football at Long Branch High School, where he received good grades and graduated in 1946. Lucassen went to work as a nonunion carpenter after high school in order to gain skill as a carpenter. A year later, in 1947, he married Audrey West‚Äîa girl he had known since elementary school. The couple had two children (a son and a daughter). In 1952, Lucassen joined Local 2250 of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters. He became a committed unionist, and was elected business representative of his local in 1960. He became known as a skilled negotiator. Lucassen was eventually elected president of his local, and was elected to several positions in the Carpenters' state organization. Convinced that apprenticeship and training programs were important to growing the union as well as providing skilled labor for economic growth and development, Lucassen co-founded and helped raise funds for the New Jersey Alliance for Action, a labor-management development coalition which sponsored apprentice and journeyman programs. Lucassen was appointed a vice president of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters in the 1970s. He moved to northern Virginia and worked out of the union's headquarters in Washington, D.C. Election as president In October 1982, Carpenters president William Konyha unexpectedly retired and first vice president Patrick J. Campbell assumed the presidency. Campbell won election outright in 1985. But Campbell, too, resigned from office early, stepping down for health reasons in February 1988. First vice president Sigurd Lucassen was appointed president to succeed him.Crowe, \\"$94M Loss Spurs Unusual Carpenter Union Election,\\" Newsday, October 9, 1991. In September 1989, Lucassen revealed that Campbell had approved $95 million in loans to various builders, only to have nearly all the construction projects lose money or declare bankruptcy. Half the union's annual budget of $200 million might be needed to write off the loans. Lucassen blamed Campbell and bad advice from investment advisors, and initiated several lawsuits against them. But several elected union leaders and union members accused Lucassen in federal court of colluding with Campbell to approve the loans.Swoboda, \\"Carpenters Union Could Lose $95 Million,\\" Washington Post, September 20, 1989. When Lucassen ran for election outright in 1991, he was challenged by the union's national secretary, John S. \\"Whitey\\" Rogers. It was the first contested election for presidency of the carpenters' union since 1915. The election split the union's 15-member general executive board, with half the members supporting Lucassen's slate and half supporting Rogers' slate. In a hotly contested election rife with allegations of fraud, Lucassen and his running mates Dean Sooter, first vice president; Paschal McGuinness, second vice president; Jim Patterson, general secretary; and Jim Bledsoe, general treasurer, won. Sooter stepped down in 1993, and McGuinness became first vice president. Lucassen appointed Douglas J. McCarron, secretary-treasurer of the Southern California Council of Carpenters, second vice president.Cleeland, \\"Organize or Die,\\" Los Angeles Times, March 10, 2002. Presidency Lucassen instituted a general policy of consolidating locals throughout the country. He began the process as soon as he took office. He consolidated locals in Los Angeles in 1988, in San Diego in 1990 and Orange and Riverside counties in California in 1991. Although members challenged the consolidations, a federal appeals court upheld union Lucassen's right to force consolidations if they are in the interest of union members.Flagg, \\"National Union Takes Control of Carpenter Locals,\\" Los Angeles Times, November 21, 1991. Lucassen was an active participant in the controversy over the spotted owl and the harvesting of timber in old growth forests. He strongly opposed any Endangered Species Act protection for the spotted owl in Washington, denounced existing protections for old-growth forests, demanded that these and other federally-owned timberlands be opened for extensive logging, and launched scathing attacks on environmentalists. When the federal government offered job retraining funds to the union to assist workers out of work due to federal forest policies, Lucassen angrily turned the grants down.Sonner, \\"Bill to Protect Northwest Old-Growth Forests Back,\\" The Oregonian, February 1, 1991; Taylor, \\"Owl Plan Hurts Workers, Say Timber and Labor Groups,\\" Seattle Post-Intelligencer, December 13, 1991; Ulrich, \\"Plan to Cut Tree Appeals Wins Praise,\\" The Oregonian, March 20, 1992; \\"Paul Newman Movie Theater Ad Seeks National Forest Protection,\\" The Oregonian, September 28, 1992; \\"Union Snubs Grant to Aid Logging Jobs,\\" Seattle Post-Intelligencer, July 13, 1993. In June 1991, Lucassen launched a \\"Ready to Rebuild America\\" campaign. The goal of the publicity effort was to build support for major new federal public works projects which would employ, among other others, out-of-work carpenters.Francis, \\"Union Calls for Public Works to Create Jobs,\\" Christian Science Monitor, September 24, 1991. In 1993, a federal judge castigated Lucassen for snap elections he had ordered in a Los Angeles local. U.S. district court judge Edward Rafeedie ordered new elections for Local 803 in Orange County, California. After imposing a trusteeship on the local in 1991, Lucassen ordered Southern California Council secretary- treasurer McCarron to hold elections on just a few days' notice. Nominations and voting were held in the same 24-hour period. Local union members sued, and Judge Rafeedie agreed that the elections were illegally held. Rafeedie singled Lucassen out, writing that the way the elections were handled lent credence \\"to the inference that this election was intended to produce certain results.\\"Flagg, \\"Judge Orders Carpenters to Conduct New Union Elections,\\" Los Angeles Times, October 30, 1993. In 1994, a federal jury in Arkansas found the Carpenters and the United Paperworkers International Union guilty of tortious business interference. BE&K; Construction had won a bid from the Potlatch Corporation to upgrade and expand a pulp and paper mill. A short time later, the jury found, Potlatch canceled the contract after union representatives threatened pickets, arson, violence and rioting. Lucassen denounced the $10 million award against the union, and appealed.Williams, \\"BE&K; Wins $20 Million Suit Against Two Unions,\\" Birmingham News, April 19, 1994. In 1995, Lucassen imposed a trusteeship on Carpenters Local 17 in New York City. The local, which represented carpenters at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center had been accused by a federal investigator of giving work to only a few, select members of the local union who were involved with organized crime.Pulley, \\"Headquarters Seizes Carpenters' Union Over U.S. Inquiry,\\" New York Times, April 12, 1995. Involvement in BCTD affairs In 1995, Robert Georgine was challenged for the presidency of Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO (BCTD) by A. L. \\"Mike\\" Monroe, president of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades. The Carpenters were the largest BCTD affiliate, and Lucassen opposed Georgine's re-election even though Georgine's running mate was Carpenters' first vice president Paschal McGuinness. Monroe, Lucassen and others argued that Georgine had failed to maintain the effectiveness of local BCTD councils, refused to fund organizing programs and allowed jurisdictional disputes to get out of hand. They also claimed that Georgine's role as chief executive officer of ULLICO left him little time to devote to BCTD business. In a close election, however, Georgine won.\\"Trades' Election Heats Up,\\" Engineering News-Record, July 24, 1995. Support for Sweeney insurgency In 1995, John Sweeney, president of the Service Employees International Union, challenged incumbent Lane Kirkland for the presidency of the AFL-CIO. The race was a bitter one, and Kirkland resigned the presidency of the AFL-CIO in mid-election. Thomas R. Donahue, the AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer, was named acting president of the federation and ran for president in his own right.Franklin, \\"First Public Feud in Years Stings AFL-CIO Leadership,\\" Chicago Tribune, May 14, 1995; Grow, \\"AFL-CIO Interim Leader May Pay Big Price for Loyalty,\\" Minneapolis Star-Tribune, September 12, 1995; Kilborn, \\"Bringing Down Labor's Giant Leader,\\" New York Times, September 4, 1995; Silverstein, \\"Kirkland to Quit in August in Bid to Block Opposition,\\" Los Angeles Times, June 13, 1995; Uchitelle, \\"Top Union Official Is to Retire,\\" New York Times, May 9, 1995. Lucassen was an early and strong Sweeney supporter. Although Lucassen's retirement was seen by some as possibly moving the Carpenters union into the Donahue camp, most union delegates to the AFL-CIO convention voted for Sweeney.Swoboda, \\"Sweeney Claims Lock on AFL-CIO Votes,\\" Washington Post, September 26, 1995. Retirement In 1993, \\"Whitey\\" Rogers asked the U.S. Department of Labor to overturn the Carpenters' 1991 election on the basis of fraud. He presented his case to the United States Department of Labor (DOL), which agreed that the election should be overturned. DOL sued the union, and in 1995 reached a settlement with Lucassen and the union calling for a new election. Realizing he could not win after having essentially admitted he had committed fraud in the 1991 election, Lucassen chose to retire instead. McGuinness, meanwhile, had been accused of, and subsequently settled, racketeering charges and had quit his international union post to run for secretary-treasurer of the BCTD.McGuinness had lost re- election as president of the New York District Council of Carpenters in 1991. Crowe, \\"Union Slams Door on Leader,\\" Newsday, June 13, 1991. At the 1995 convention, Lucassen announced his retirement and nominated McCarron as general president. He also nominated Jim Patterson for the merged secretary- treasurer position and Andris Silins as first vice president.\\"Carpenters Get New Leader,\\" Engineering News-Record, September 4, 1995. McCarron ran unopposed, and easily won election as president.Galvin, \\"Carpenters Union President to Step Aside,\\" Associated Press, August 17, 1995. Retirement and death Lucassen retired to Middletown Township, New Jersey, where he had purchased and restored a home. He built ice boats and sailed them in the winter. Lucassen died in March 2001.

He served one term in the U.S. House of Representatives, resigning to become a state judge. During the American Civil War Judge Thompson resigned that position as because he believed the creation of West Virginia to be illegal.CongBio no. T000201 Early and family life Born in St. Clairsville, Ohio, Thompson graduated from Jefferson College in 1824, then studied law in Richmond, Virginia. He married Elizabeth Steenrod (1817-1897). They had four sons, none of whom survived their mother, and two daughters. Their sons included Confederate Col. William P. Thompson (1837-1896, who became a vice president of Standard Oil as well as president of the Lead Trust); Lewis Thompson (1833-1918); George Western Thompson (1846-1895, who served a president of the Ohio River Railroad, and was married to Frances Belle Jackson, daughter of General John Jay Jackson); and Daniel Steenrod Thompson (1853-1893). His daughter Anna Gaither Thompson married Johnson Newlon Camden who became a prominent industrialist, banker and railroad organizer in West Virginia and U.S. Senator, although both his gubernatorial runs failed.https://www.findagrave.com/cgi- bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid;=7617808http://www.ohiocountylibrary.org/wheeling- history/4345 Career After admission to the Ohio bar in 1826, Thompson began his legal practice in St. Clairsville in 1828. He moved across the Ohio River to what was Virginia in 1837 and became deputy postmaster of Wheeling, Virginia (now West Virginia) in 1838. He was later appointed to a commission to settle jurisdiction of the Ohio River between Virginia and Ohio. President James K. Polk appointed Thompson United States Attorney for the western district of Virginia, and he served as from 1848 to 1850. A Democrat, Thompson won election to the United States House of Representatives in 1850, serving from 1851 until his resignation in 1852 when the Virginia General Assembly elected him judge of the circuit court. As both Congressman and state judge, he was involved in cases involving the Wheeling Suspension Bridge (completed in 1849) and a nearby railroad bridge which helped Wheeling become an important gateway city between the Ohio River valley and Eastern and international markets. As Congressman, Thompson introduced documents supporting the bridge (including resolutions of the Ohio and Virginia state legislatures), which impeded large steamboats to Pittsburgh. Congress passed a law declaring it a post road, so it was not torn down despite the United States Supreme Court finding it impeded Ohio River navigation.Elizabeth Brand Monroe, The Wheeling Bridge Case (Northeastern University Press 1992) pp. 133, 139-140. Virginia's General Assembly reelected Thompson as circuit judge in 1860. However, after Virginia voters in May 1861 approved the ordinance of secession which had bee passed by the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861 despite the Unionist stance of most delegates from northwestern Virginia (including near Wheeling), Unionists attended the Wheeling Convention which established the Restored Government of Virginia. Thompson left office in 1861, refusing to take the oath of office to support what he believed was an unconstitutional action to set up the present State of West Virginia.Although the surname is common, no-one named Thompson appears to have owned slaves in northwestern Virginia in the 1869 U.S. Federal census, which is indexed online, although slaveholders with different first names did own slaves in Russell County, Virginia, and in Kentucky and other states Ralph Lazier Berkshire, whom he had defeated in the judicial contest and who supported West Virginia's statehood, would be elected his successor and later first Chief Justice of the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals. His son William P. Thompson, who had become a lawyer in Virginia in 1857, recruited the \\"Marion Greys\\" and became a colonel of the 19th Virginia Infantry. Another son, George Western Thompson (1846-1895), became involved with the Ohio River Railroad and served as president until his death in 1895. After the war, William Thompson joined with his brother-in-law and another man and became president of the Camden Consolidated Oil Company, which in 1881 merged into Standard Oil Company, of which Thompson became vice-president and moved to Cleveland, Ohio.http://www.ohiocountylibrary.org/wheeling-history/4345 Death and legacy Meanwhile, Judge Thompson retired to his estate near Wheeling, West Virginia where he eventually died on February 24, 1888.

The flour is mixed with water, turmeric, and a little salt and heated, stirring constantly, until it reaches a creamy consistency. It is then transferred into a tray and allowed to set. It can also be made using dried chickpea instead of processed flour. In this process, dried chickpeas are soaked overnight. Once the peas have been re-hydrated, they are ground into a puree with some of the liquid used to soak the peas, then allowed to set for a couple of hours. Much of the top layer of clear liquid is then skimmed off and the remaining puree is brought to a boil with turmeric and salt and cooked and set in the same manner as the version using chickpea flour. It is matte yellow in colour, jelly-like but firm in consistency, and does not crumble when cut or sliced. It may be eaten fresh as a salad or deep fried. It may also be sliced and dried to make crackers for deep frying. Despite the name, Burmese tofu is unrelated to Chinese tofu, which is made from soy milk with added coagulants. Varieties and etymology (Burmese tofu crackers) are sold in bundles ready for deep frying. *P√® bya (, literally flat peas) refers to Chinese tofu and is translated into 'beancurd' in English in Myanmar. Stinky tofu or the fermented form of tofu, however, is called si to hpu, probably a version of the Chinese word ch√≤u d√≤ufu. *Won ta hpo is the yellow form of tofu made from yellow split peas or in Shan State. * or dried tofu is yellow tofu sliced into a long thin rectangular form and dried in the sun. They are similar to fish or prawn crackers and sold in bundles. *To hpu made from chickpea (kala b√®) flour or p√® hmont is the common version in mainland Burma. It has the same yellow colour and taste but slightly firmer than Shan tofu. *Hsan ta hpo is still mainly confined to Shan regions, made from rice flour called hsan hmont or mont hmont, and is white in colour. It has the same consistency but slightly different in taste. It is as popular as the yellow form as a salad. There is no (as in \\"French\\") in the Burmese language; hence, (as in the word \\"pot\\") is used in to hpu, the Burmese version of \\"tofu\\". Preparation=Fried (Burmese tofu fritters) are popular as snacks on their own, with glutinous rice for breakfast, or as a salad. * is yellow tofu cut into rectangular shapes, scored in the middle, and deep fried. Tofu fritters may be eaten with a spicy sour dip, or cut and made into a salad. They are crispy outside and soft inside. They are similar to the Sicilian snack panelle. * is so called because the fritters are \\"twice fried\\" after the tofu is cut into triangular shapes. It is the traditional form in the Shan States. * or deep fried tofu crackers, like , are usually served with htamin gyin (lit. \\"sour rice\\" balls kneaded together with tomato and fish or potato), another popular Shan dish. Fried tofu goes very well with (glutinous rice) as a breakfast option, and also with mohinga (rice vermicelli in fish soup), nan gyi thohk (rice noodle salad) and Shan (Shan-style rice noodles). Green tea is the preferred traditional drink to go with all these in Burma.

Fresh tofu, cut into small rectangular slices, constitutes the main ingredient of the salad, dressed and garnished with peanut oil, dark soy sauce, rice vinegar, toasted crushed dried chilli, crushed garlic, crushed roasted peanuts, crisp- fried onions, and coriander. This dish is similar to the Chinese dish liangfen. * refers to tofu fritters cut up and served as a salad as above. * (warm tofu) or (soft tofu) is the soft creamy tofu served hot before it sets, usually as a salad dressed and garnished the same way.

They commonly were used to plant, tend, and harvest cotton, sugar, rice, and tobacco.  Chores  Field slaves usually worked in the fields from sunrise to sundown while being monitored by an overseer. The overseer ensured that slaves did not slow down or cease their field work until the day was over.  Clothing  Field slaves were given one outfit annually. During the winter time, field slaves were given additional clothing, or material to make additional cloth, in order to keep warm.  Children  Children did not go to school and were put to work as young as they were able. Younger children were given lighter tasks, like fetching meals and guarding livestock. Slave children received little to no clothing until they reached puberty. They were given gender- appropriate clothing.  Women  Women were given long dresses to wear in the summer. During the winter they made themselves a shawl and pantalettes. Women often wore turbans on the heads, covering their hair.  Men  Men were given pants to wear during the summer and then in the winter they were also given long coats to wear.  Meals  Field slaves were given weekly rations of food by their master, which included meat, corn meal and flour. If permitted, the slaves could have a garden to grow themselves fresh vegetables.

This class of knots has many uses in climbing and mountaineering, for example in a pulley system where a load is being hauled up a cliff, the Garda hitch prevents the load from slipping when the pulley system is reset. The drawbacks to the garda hitch are that it is hard to release under load, it is hard to inspect, and it adds much friction to a pulley system. Particularly difficult is to figure out which way the rope will run freely, and which way it will lock just by visual inspection. The Garda requires two similar carabiners, and works best with two identical oval carabiners. However, identical \\"D\\" carabiners will work, although there is a risk of the \\"D\\" carabiners unclipping.

It takes a bit of experience to tell which end will run freely when pulled‚Äîit's the end that comes out between the two carabiners, 'spreading them'.

Career In baseball circles, he was known for his two-year stint as the general manager of the Kansas City Athletics, from to . During those two years, he engineered trades that sent key players to the New York Yankees, such as Bob Cerv and Ralph Terry, but his most notable deal came on December 11, 1959, in which Carroll sent 25-year-old outfielder Roger Maris to the Yankees along with two other players for Don Larsen (author of a World Series perfect game three years earlier), Marv Throneberry, Hank Bauer and Norm Siebern. With the aid of the short right-field porch in Yankee Stadium, Maris set a single-season record with 61 home runs in , just two years after leaving the A's. Only Siebern would pay dividends for the A's, however, as their regular first baseman from 1960 to 1963 and a two-time American League All-Star. Carroll's dealings with the Yankees were controversial because the Athletics, under owner Arnold Johnson, sent many top players to New York in apparently one- sided trades during the mid-to-late-1950s. Johnson and the team's director of player personnel, George Selkirk, had previously traded quality players such as Bobby Shantz, Clete Boyer, Harry \\"Suitcase\\" Simpson and Ryne Duren to the Yanks. Johnson also had business ties with Yankee partner Del Webb and owned Yankee Stadium in the Bronx prior to purchasing the Philadelphia Athletics and moving them to Kansas City. All these factors led to charges from fans, writers and other teams that Johnson and Carroll ran the Athletics as a Yankee farm team at the Major League level. Carroll came to the Athletics directly after working in the Yankee organization as business manager for the Bombers' two top farm clubs, the Newark Bears of the International League, and the Athletics' immediate predecessors, the Kansas City Blues of the American Association. A former sportswriter and sports editor of the Kansas City Journal Post, Carroll entered baseball as business manager of the Minneapolis Millers of the American Association when the Journal Post ceased publication during World War II. Carroll joined the Athletics in their first season in Kansas City in 1955 as vice president and business manager, and was promoted to general manager by Johnson after the end of the 1958 season. Johnson previously had not handed the general manager title to a specific executive, preferring to divide the GM responsibilities among himself, Selkirk and Carroll. Death Johnson died suddenly from a cerebral hemorrhage during 1960 spring training. His unexpected death forced the sale of the club to insurance executive Charlie Finley, who fired Carroll at the end of the 1960 season, replacing him with former Cleveland Indians GM Frank \\"Trader\\" Lane. Ironically, only months later, Carroll also died suddenly ‚Äî of a heart attack in Kansas City, on February 4, 1961, at age 56.

Carpenter pencils are easier to grip than standard pencils, because they have a larger surface area. The non-round core allows thick or thin lines to be drawn by rotating the pencil. Thin lines are required for high precision markings and are easy to erase, but thick markings are needed to mark on rough surfaces. The lead is strong to withstand the stress of marking on such surfaces. The pencil is robust to survive in a construction environment, for example when placed in a bag together with heavy tools. The core is often stronger than in other pencils. Carpenter pencils are used by builders, because they are suitable for marking on surfaces like concrete or stone. This shape and lead density aid in marking legible lines with a straight edge that are clear and easy to follow with a saw blade. Carpenter pencils are typically manually sharpened with a knife, although special sharpeners can be used. Artwork with carpenter's pencil The flat pencil is one of the oldest pencil types. The first versions were made by hollowing out sticks of juniper wood. A superior technique was discovered: two wooden halves were carved with a groove running down them, a plumbago stick placed in one of the grooves, and the two halves then glued together--essentially the same method in use to this day. Similar pencils (called 'jumbo pencils') are sometimes used by children. A pencil that is designed for a child rather than a carpenter would have a softer core, enabling the user to draw with less physical effort. Carpenter pencils are sometimes used by artists and designers to draw a thick line easily when needed. Notching the middle of the lead with the corner of a file makes it possible to draw two parallel lines at once, a technique used by artists and calligraphers. As an example, Old English letters are easier to draw with a carpenter pencil than with an ordinary pen (see photo).

Her solo, character- based stage shows include Youth Club and Joanna Neary Is Not Feeling Herself, which received a Perrier Best Newcomer award nomination in 2004. She has also appeared in the TV shows Time Trumpet, Angelo's, That Mitchell and Webb Look, Skins, Dogface, Man Down and Ideal. Radio credits include acting as an ensemble member of the cast in the first series of the Count Arthur Strong Radio Show, as well as appearing in numerous series of the Radio 4 show Out to Lunch. Harry Deansway, writing in The Guardian, described Neary as \\"a character actress par excellence; not only are her characters well observed and immaculately performed, but they are well written and, most importantly, funny....A Joyce Grenfell of our age.\\" Education Neary grew up in Redruth, Cornwall. She told The West Briton, \\"After leaving Pool School I did an art degree at Falmouth and became interested in performance art. I decided that people tying themselves together naked and walking across the Great Wall of China was the way to go.\\" She went on to study visual and performing arts at the University of Brighton, where she wrote plays and performed her first character-based comedy shows. As well as writing her own material, she also acted in plays and sketches written by Brian Mitchell and Joseph Nixon. Many of the songs in her shows are written by Mitchell. Neary has said, \\"I don't like comic songs particularly but I do love singing and dancing about.\\" Early career In 1998-9, Neary played the female lead, a French femme fatale, in The Ministry of Biscuits, a dystopian comic musical by Brian Mitchell and Philip Reeve. The musical was first performed in Brighton, followed by a national tour including a visit to the 1999 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. It was revived in Brighton in 2005 and again in 2017. In 2001, Neary teamed up with fellow Brighton character comedian, Graham Darg, to create Sean Hard vs Craft Woman, which they performed at Komedia Southside in the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. In 2003, Neary performed with David Mounfield and Brian Mitchell in the sketch show, Take This and Shove It, at the Smirnoff Underbelly, Edinburgh. The sketches, including Tarzan and Jane and The Wombles, were written by Mitchell and Nixon. Neary also performed some of her own character pieces, including Celia, based on the female protagonist in Brief Encounter. Solo shows In Neary's debut Edinburgh solo show in 2004, she appeared as multiple characters, including Mr Timkins (a sly cat mourning the recent loss of his \\"dingle\\"), a bespectacled dolphin commenting on news stories from a soggy newspaper, and her own mother and grandmother. She told The Scotsman, \\"The animals all started off with a dolphin which was an inflatable toy that I found in a bargain bin in a charity shop for a pound. It was my size so I slit it down the back, made a hole for my face and climbed inside it. Then I walked around my flat doing a silly voice and imagining what a dolphin would talk like.\\" Neary performing as \\"Pan's Person\\" According to the review in The Scotsman, \\"(her) Pan's People pastiche of I Can‚Äôt Live if Living Is Without You is worth the price of the ticket alone as she rhythmically mimes her way through every method of suicide available.\\" Brian Logan, in The Guardian, wrote, \\"There's one strong comic character after another in Joanna Neary's solo Fringe debut, which can feel like a one-woman Fast Show... Neary's alter egos are the products of a highly individual imagination.\\" The show was nominated for the Perrier Newcomer Award and won the Comedy Report Best Character Actress Award. For her 2005 Edinburgh show, Neary was directed by David Sant of Peepolykus. She created a cast of new characters, including Les Miserables, the Aussie comic, Lee, an 11-year-old deer, who is looking forward to starting rutting even though he doesn't know quite what it entails, and Fiona, the gap-year student who likes bongos but is worried about global dimming. According to The Scotsman's review, \\"Her range of accents is amazing ‚Äì she convincingly does no less than nine different English accents, yet the obvious choices of Brummie or Geordie are nowhere to be heard.' Neary returned to Edinburgh in 2007 with her third solo show. Alongside the familiar characters, such as Celia Johnson, she created Chris, a swinger from Portslade, Bj√∂rk singing a song about the property market, and Carol Streep, a nervous woman giving a talk on sex aids. The show was framed with readings from Neary's own teenage diaries, with stories of \\"life in Eighties Cornwall with a loose tooth and Lady Di haircut and the many boys that steadfastly ignored her.\\" Stephanie Merritt reviewed the show in The Observer: \\"For character comedy that is glorious fun with no underlying point whatsoever, Joanna Neary's Little Moments (Pleasance) would be hard to better. Neary is a fiercely gifted actor and her short monologues are peppered with clever songs and silly dances. The real joy here is the character based on Celia Johnson in Brief Encounter, a pitch-perfect impersonation taken to its logical conclusion. This is a show that leaves you with a huge smile and a renewed sense of delight in daftness.' Neary's fourth Edinburgh show, in 2008, was reviewed by Brian Donaldson in The List: 'Whether Neary... is being a cat or a dolphin, impersonating celebrity chefs or transforming herself into bonkers old Bj√∂rk singing about the credit crunch, each scene is infused with intricate details, layered by pinpoint writing and heightened with a highly polished performance.' New characters included the celebrity chefs Heston Blumenthal and Delia Smith. In one new sketch, written by Joseph Nixon, she appeared as a Katharine Hepburn type American actress, who says \\"My only regret is turning down Gone with the Wind... and sleeping with Hitler.\\" The show ended with another Pan's People dance, this time to the Charles Aznavour song \\"She\\". For her 2011 show, Youth Club, Neary drew again on her teenage years in 1980s Cornwall, and created a completely new set of characters. These were described by Colin Bramwell in Exeunt: \\"There are many memorable characters on offer here: Mr. Eddy, the youth club leader who annunciates each word with a new dance move; Eva, the madrigal-adapting new-girl from exotic Birmingham; Diana, the centrepiece of the story, who enjoys singing rude songs on the toilet and making things out of Weetabix boxes, and who fancies Gary, who knows the word for kite in Swahili... To effortlessly switch between a whole ensemble of characters takes considerable skill, and Neary pulls it off with no small amount of aplomb. Her talent for physical comedy is also impressive. The simulation of a young girl attempting an impromptu dance to a destroyed tape of the latest pop hit is both sympathetic and hilarious.\\" Celia Neary's most popular and lasting character creation is the repressed housewife, Celia, based on Celia Johnson's character in Brief Encounter. Writing in The List, Hannah Adcock commented \\"she dons a period hat and a perfectly modulated voice to become Celia Johnson. 'Arthur hasn't noticed' she confides, excitement ripening in her throat. 'He just thinks I'm an ordinary woman.\\" Bruce Dessau, writing in Metro, described Celia as encapsulating \\"a lost age of repressed passion, snobbery and lumpy marmalade.\\" In the Telegraph, Dominic Cavendish declared, \\"Her idea of crossing Celia Johnson's character from Brief Encounter with a contemporary (trapped) housewife ‚Äì relaying her diary's 1940s-styled entries to us throughout the show ‚Äì is so inspired, and beautifully executed, it deserves its own Radio 4 series.\\" In 2007, Neary made a short film as Celia, Brief Encounter of an Ordinary Woman, with John Sackville as Trevor Howard. It was filmed by the BBC Reversioning Unit for BBC Mini Movies, and directed by Vanessa Frances. For Neary's 2015 show Faceful of Issues, she remained in character as Celia, now the host of The Toxborough Village Hall Chat Show, in aid of the animal hospital for a kitten who needs an iron lung. The show features \\"topical talks, showbiz exclusives, celebrity interviews ‚Äì plus a local locksmith's bawdy confessions, a recipe for air soup, and a photograph of a conker.\\" It was nominated for Best Show at the 2016 Leicester Comedy Festival. Reviewing the show for Chortle, Steve Bennett wrote \\"In her compelling performance, Neary has impeccable comic instincts. The pauses are just perfect, and she knows when to ride a laugh, when to hold out for more, and when to move on swiftly. Faceful Of Issues is pretty much a Radio 4 comedy waiting to happen, both mocking and appealing to the middle-class demographic.\\" Joanna Neary Does Animals and Men Neary's 2016 Edinburgh show took the form of a PowerPoint presentation. Tim Wilcock described the show in Fringe Review: \\"art and education emerge as the twin themes of this really wacky and almost anarchic hour of character comedy from a very talented young comedienne that comes thoroughly recommended.\\" Visual and performance art Neary is a regular collaborator with the visual and performance artist Mel Brimfield. In 2010, she appeared as the fictional performance artist, Alex Owens, in a series of photographs, later reproduced in Brimfield's book, This is Performance Art. In 2011, Brimfield staged a live performance, Barbara Hepworth > Henry Moore, at the ICA as part of Bob and Roberta Smith's exhibition \\"Women Should Be in Charge\\". Neary gave a lecture as the sculptor, Dame Barbara Hepworth. Brimfield's 2012 exhibition, Between Genius and Desire, at the Ceri Hand Gallery in Covent Garden, dealt with the myth of the suffering male artist. It included a film, Clement Greenberg ‚Äì Lee Krasner = Jackson Pollock, in which Neary played the role of Lee Krasner. According to the Ceri Hand Gallery's website, \\"Lee Krasner is re-imagined as a downtrodden, dowdy Home Counties frump and Pollock reduced to a helpless feral dog-like caricature ‚Äì smashing things up, pissing on carpets, chasing balls and hanging his head out of the car window with his tongue lolling ‚Äì a version of Pollock's much discussed alcoholism and primitive urges. Krasner puts up a relentlessly optimistic front despite Greenberg's blatant misogyny and the art world's complete disinterest in her as anything other than Pollock's carer.\\" Other work In September 2016, Neary performed at the Keep Corbyn rally in Brighton in support of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election.

History of the Branch Three corporations operated the Shawnee-Asher branch during its 40-year history. The first five miles, from Shawnee to Tecumseh (which at this time was the county seat), was built in 1896 by the Tecumseh Railway Co. Cost of construction was not recorded. On October 12, 1900 the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf (C.O.G.) bought the property and franchise for $12,000 and promptly built 20 more miles of railroad to extend the branch to Asher, up to the bank of the South Canadian River. Cost of the extension is recorded as $422,873. Rock Island took over operations on March 24, 1904. Total investment in the branch over the years is estimated at $451,103. Route The branch began in Shawnee and traveled through Thackery, Tecumseh, Romulus and Pearson before arriving in Asher. In its prime, Old Beck would arrive in Asher at 4:00 each day carrying goods, groceries pharmaceuticals and the like. The train would stay the night in Asher and leave early the next morning carrying cotton, wood, cattle and passengers back to Shawnee. Decline In the oil boom days of 1927 through 1930, Old Beck ran every day and freights shuttled as often as five times daily down to Tecumseh, Pearson and Asher. However, starting in 1936, Rock Island reported operating deficits. Passenger transportation dwindled, down to none in 1940. The train schedule was reduced to three days a week until May 8, 1939, when only one weekly trip was made. Toward the end, the train only came out on call‚Äîwhen enough freight accumulated or there was a special request. Service on the branch ended February 10, 1942.

Arriving in England, as part of the Eighth Air Force, the 351st BG is welcomed by the Royal Air Force and begins training, attending daily lectures on security. Their first mission flying Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers has the armada departing at 15-second intervals. The first mission of the 351st on Fortress Europe, after fighting through Luftwaffe defenders, is a success, with all 20 B-17s returning safely back to base. The danger of flying in massed formation, however, is brought home in training, when a collision takes place over the home base. Missions are also not always without casualties and 351st bombers are shot down. Wounded airmen who make it back to base, are cared for at a nearby hospital. When bombers are all shot up, the ground crew works up to 90-hour periods to put them back into service. As the mission tallies build, the men partake in activities at the base, including games, socializing and worship. The U.S.O. brings entertainers such as Bob Hope while the Red Cross provides the men with rest and recreation. During special parades, commanders of the 8th Air Force bestow medals for exceptional service and sacrifice. The 351st participates in a big mission into Germany and after flying for about three hours, the B-17s' fighter escort turns back. As the bombers near their target to drop incendiary and anti-personnel bombs, enemy fighter aircraft appear and intense flak comes up from the ground. After a long battle, the 351st returns to base, ready to fight again until the war is over.

Biography  Lambert was born on January 29, 1860, in Champaign County, OhioForkner, p. 385 on a farm near Mechanicsburg, Ohio. As a teenager Lambert moved in with his family to Hillgrove in Darke County, Ohio near Union City. At the age of 16 Lambert devised a clever handheld corn planter that the Lamberts sold nationwide. It revolutionized farming for a brief time, before larger machines were developed. This first successful product started the long career of John Lambert invented items his family manufactured and sold.Lambert, Carol Jean, Something New Under the Sun, Merrimack Media, Cambridge, MA. 2014 One day his father had promised to take him to a tannery the next day to see an engine that could run without a steam boiler. This tannery was located in Greenville, Ohio that his father had previously seen. When they arrived at the tannery the next morning, Lambert was disappointed to find that the building had burned to the ground the night before. He searched amongst the ashes and found the burned Otto gas engine. This was the only one he had ever heard of or seen. He took it apart to see how it was constructed. It was a slide valve coal gas engine.Dolnar, vol.10, Jan. 1906, p. 225 In 1885 Lambert moved to Ohio City, Ohio, previously known as Enterprise, in Van Wert County. There he had an agricultural implement store, a grain elevator, and a lumber yard. Lambert also owned the town's opera house, town hall, jail and other town properties.Kimes, p. 835 Lambert always kept in the back of his mind the gas engine he saw in 1876. One day in the 1880s he heard of Karl Benz building an automobile in Germany and it rekindled his vision to build a gasoline engine that would operate a \\"horseless carriage.\\"John W. Lambert biography Stationary gasoline engines were extremely heavy in those days and too much for a \\"horseless carriage.\\" It so happened that a John B. Hicks had made a patent application in 1890 on a stationary gasoline engine. Lambert contacted Hicks and through Hicks was introduced to a Mr. Wacholtz, a German engineer who had worked with Hicks. On December 20, 1890 Wacholtz made a contract with Lambert to make a lightweight automobile engine. The license granted to Lambert a shop right or license to manufacture gas engines embodying the improvements invented by the said Hicks as above stated for the use only on land vehicles other than railway or tramway cars. Benz's automobile was belt driven from an engine. Lambert felt if he could make a lightweight gasoline engine that did not operate with belts to propel it he would have a valuable transportation vehicle that could be utilized in the United States. Lambert hired Wacholtz to work with him on building a balanced motor containing three cylinders. He agreed to pay for all the expenses of the development of such an engine. The machine was done by Lowell Machine Works of Cleveland, Ohio. One of the reasons the engine was fabricated in Cleveland was because they had gasoline available there. He also had the design and the body of \\"horseless carriage\\" done there. Also the running gears for the automobile were fabricated there. Lambert went to extremes to have the engine made lightweight. This was the first experience Lambert had with building an automobile engine. He originally agreed to spend $200 for the machine work to produce the automobile engine, however after spending $3,300 Wacholtz was not able to produce a working engine in Cleveland. Lambert stopped the work at this stage of fabrication and shipped the non-working engine and incomplete automobile to a small machine shop that he owned in Ohio City. This way he could then devote his personal attention to the engine and automobile when he could from his businesses he was running there. The automobile consisted of two clutches and two chains, which were connected to a jack shaft. The two clutches gave two speeds forward and there was no reverse speed used. The single front wheel of the tricycle designed automobile was steered by a foot lever and a hand lever. This direct steering method provided that the arms could be rested and the steering done by the feet, and vice versa. One item that needed to be solved for completion and a working engine was a means of carburation. Lambert heard of a means of vaporizing gasoline by Gottlieb Daimler of Germany. He went to New York to see the engine that was operating a boat. After seeing this complicated carburetor Lambert developed what he called the \\"vaporizer.\\" This was a simpler carburetor than Daimler's, which he was then able to get the engine working the way he intended it to. The automobile was completed soon after he had it Ohio City.John W. Lambert's first American gasoline automobile There was a great deal of secrecy surrounding the developments of Lambert's automobile. Operational tests were conducted with the window blinds pulled at the farm implement showroom where he ran it. Outside road tests were conducted at night on roads that were not used. That was a good thing since many times there were long intervals between being able to get the automobile started again after it stopped. It turned out that the villagers didn't even know what Lambert was working on since it was such a new concept. They didn't realize the significance of Lambert's horseless carriage. Lambert is said to have had the first automobile accident. One time when he was testing his \\"horseless carriage\\" at night in a secret run he drove his vehicle into a tree stump and ran into a hitching post. He made up sales brochures for his \\"horseless carriage\\" in January 1891, however not a single person bought one. He decided after extensive work on this automobile that the idea of a \\"horseless carriage\\" was way off into the future and was discouraged to continue. His father and brother encouraged him to sell his businesses in Ohio City and move to Union City, Ohio where they were and made stationary gasoline engines - which had an established market already. There in 1892 he started the Buckeye Manufacturing Company and the Lambert Gas and Gasoline Engine Company to make stationary engines and farm machinery implements. Later in 1893 Lambert started the Union Automobile Company in that city. Lambert moved to Anderson, Indiana from Union City in 1893. He then moved some of his machinery from his Union City plant at that time. Lambert incorporated the Buckeye Manufacturing Company and Lambert Gas and Gasoline Engine Company that year. Lambert 1876 corn-planter patent 178,166 Family The United States census shows Lambert was living in Jackson Township, Darke County, Ohio in 1880. It shows he was twenty years old and the third born in the family. His siblings were Anna Elizabeth (24), George Albert (22), Savina Ellen (deceased), Emma M. Lambert (17), Harry C.

Camara, is a Filipino American attorney. In 2001, having graduated from Hawaii Pacific University at 16, he matriculated at Harvard Law School, from which he graduated in 2004. He was also involved in a racial controversy at the school that attracted national attention. He attracted international media attention in 2009 as the pro bono defense lawyer of Jammie Thomas-Rasset, the defendant in the United States' first file-sharing copyright infringement lawsuit brought by major record labels to be tried to a jury. Background Kiwi Danao Camara was born in Manila, Philippines, to Enrico Camara and Teresa Danao, both licensed physicians. He is a grandchild of the first summa cum laude graduate of the University of the Philippines College of Medicine, renowned cardiologist, Augusto Camara, M.D. of Iba, Zambales. At age one, his family moved to Cleveland, Ohio before settling in Honolulu, Hawaii, where Camara attended the Punahou School. He wrote a medical paper on alternative treatments for rheumatoid arthritis at age 11, which was published in the Hawai'i Journal of Medicine. At 16, having skipped high school, Camara earned a Bachelor of Science in computer science summa cum laude from Hawaii Pacific University. He completed the program in two years and was recognized by the university for outstanding academic performance. The Philippines awarded him its Jose Rizal Certificate of Achievement while he was in college and later, in 2005, recognized him with a Presidential Commendation. In 2001, Camara enrolled in Harvard Law School. There he received a John M. Olin Fellowship in Law and Economics. He held the fellowship until September 2004, at which time he took a position as a law clerk for Judge Harris Hartz of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Camara held a John M. Olin Fellowship for 2006‚Äì2007 and was a visiting scholar at the Northwestern University School of Law. He was previously a John M. Olin Fellow in Law and Economics at Stanford Law School and was briefly a Ph.D student in Economics at Stanford University. Controversy at Harvard In his first year at Harvard, Camara was involved in a racial controversy that would gain attention from the national media. Like many students, Camara posted his course outlines to a popular student-run website. Camara's, however, referred to blacks as nigs. For example, to summarize Shelley v. Kraemer, he wrote \\"Nigs buy land with no nig covenant; Q: Enforceable?\\" The notes were prefaced with a disclaimer that they may contain racially offensive shorthand. Upon discovering the outline, classmate Michelle Simpson alerted other students and professors. Camara issued an apology and the outlines were promptly removed, whereupon a third student using the pseudonym \\"gcrocodile\\" e-mailed Simpson, expressing disappointment that they were no longer available. The student was later identified as then-1L Mattias Scholl. The section's professor, Charles Nesson, proposed as a didactic solution a classroom mock trial in which he would defend Scholl's right to free speech. The Black Law Student Association at the school took offense and called for a reprimand of the professor, along with another professor, David Rosenberg, who in an unrelated incident allegedly stated that \\"Feminism, Marxism and the blacks have contributed nothing to the scientific pursuit of legal discourse.\\" Nesson voluntarily withdrew from teaching the torts course, and the law school dean took over for the remainder of the semester. The following year, students protested in favor of more transparency in the selection of the next law school dean and requested a candidate in favor of affirmative action. In an article in The New Yorker, Jeffrey Toobin covered the incident and found it \\"striking\\" that a sequence of \\"quirky and anomalous events generated such a consensus at the law school-that racial bias was widespread and that immediate corrective action was needed.\\" Law professor Charles Fried described it as a \\"hysterical, ridiculous overreaction to a couple of unfortunate incidents.\\" The controversy is also the subject of the book The People Vs. Harvard Law: How America's Oldest Law School Turned Its Back on Free Speech and a talk at the New England Appellate Judges‚Äô Conference.Silverglate, Harvey. Harassment, Parody, and Patriotic (& Unpatriotic) Gore: Tensions Between Academic Freedom and Proper Governance of Student & Faculty Speech at Colleges & Universities , talk to the New England Appellate Judges‚Äô Conference held in Boston on November 4, 2005. Controversy at Yale in 2005 In 2005, The Yale Law Journal accepted for publication an article co-written by Camara. An anonymous e-mail informed the Law Journal's editors of Camara's course outlines at Harvard and requested that his article not be published. The editors of the Yale Law Journal considered and ultimately decided to publish Camara's article. Some Yale Law students were upset by this decision, and formed a group that held protest activities and an alternative panel on \\"Disempowered Voices in the Legal Academy\\" at the same time as Camara's talk. Law school dean Harold Koh was among several dozen students and faculty who walked out of Camara's talk. Before the talk, Camara was aware of the planned protest and told The New York Times that he was happy that the comments had led to \\"a teaching moment\\" that was \\"a more productive thing to do than burning [him] in effigy\\".

He also represented the United States at the 1984 Summer Olympics. After retiring from playing professionally, he taught Spanish and coached boys and girls high school soccer. Youth and college DiBernardo, a native of Argentina, moved to the United States with his family when he was sixteen. His family settled in the Chicago area where DiBernardo attended J. Sterling Morton High School West in Berwyn, Illinois. He played soccer both for the school's soccer team and for Sparta, a local Chicago club. DiBernardo attended Indiana University where he played on the school's men's soccer team for three seasons from 1976 to 1978. He had an immediate impact on the team, helping it to the 1976 NCAA Men's Soccer Championship which Indiana lost to San Francisco. In 1977, Indiana failed to make the NCAA post-season, but DiBernardo was selected as a first team All American. In 1978, Indiana reprised the 1976 season, making it to the championship game, but losing to San Francisco yet again. This year DiBernardo won the Hermann Trophy as the top collegiate soccer player in the country. At the end of the season, DiBernardo left Indiana and turned pro. He finished his collegiate career with 54 goals and 17 assists for 125 points. In 1991, Indiana University inducted DiBernardo into its Athletic Hall of Fame. He was also selected to the Soccer America College Team of the Century. National team In February 1979, DiBernardo earned his first cap for the national team, coming on as a substitute for Ty Keough in a loss to the Soviet Union. DiBernardo went on to play every national team game in 1979 and was selected to play for the 1980 U.S. Olympic Team. However, he did not compete in these games, held in the Soviet Union, due to President Carter's boycott. DiBernardo became an integral part of the U.S. efforts to qualify for the 1982 World Cup and played in the four qualification games in 1980. Unfortunately, the U.S. failed to reach the finals. NASL By this time DiBernardo had already played a season with the Los Angeles Aztecs, who drafted DiBernardo, of the North American Soccer League. He played the 1979 season with the Aztecs before they traded him and Larry Hulcer to the New York Cosmos. He would remain with the Cosmos from 1980 until 1984 when the NASL collapsed. He had played for the Cosmos as an amateur in the late 1970s. In 1980, he played 29 games and scored 7 goals, adding 13 assists. The 1981 season began well for DiBernardo. He played defense, midfield and forward with the top NASL team until he pulled a hamstring. The injury healed slowly and limited him to only 17 games with the team. In 1982, DiBernardo played only one game after before being badly injured in a hard tackle. Although he recovered from the injury, he never regained his pre- injury quickness or agility. In addition to playing outdoors with the Cosmos, DiBernardo played the 1983‚Äì1984 NASL indoor season. In May 1984, the Cosmos asked DiBernardo to take a 20% pay cut. He refused and the team placed him on waivers seven games into the season. 1984 Olympics After being cut by the Cosmos, DiBernardo spent the rest of the spring and summer playing with the national team as it prepared for the 1984 Summer Olympics and began the qualification for the 1986 FIFA World Cup. He played two of the U.S. team's games in the Olympics. His last game with the national team came as a substitute in the loss to 1985 World Cup qualification loss to Costa Rica in Torrance which led to the failure of the team to make the finals. MISL He played the 1985‚Äì1986 Major Indoor Soccer League season with the Kansas City Comets. In 1987‚Äì1988, he played six games with the St. Louis Steamers before suffering a back injury which finished his playing career. High school coaching Since retiring from playing, DiBernardo became a Spanish teacher and soccer coach at Waubonsie Valley High School in Aurora, Illinois beginning in 1991. The team's highest finish came in 2001 when it took third in the state. DiBernardo also coached the school's girls team for a single season, 1991‚Äì1992. That team went 19‚Äì2‚Äì3. DiBernardo's Argentinian heritage has aided him with teaching the Spanish language and South American culture. He also founded the Americas Soccer Club with Rudy Keller, who had played with DiBernardo in their youth club days.

Originally published in 1988, the novel was nominated for a World Fantasy Award the following year. Plot summary The narrator, Walker Easterling, is a film actor and screenwriter. His director friend Nicholas Sylvian introduces him to Maris York, a sculptress who makes model cities and who is freeing herself from Luc, her abusive partner. On the day Maris and Walker meet, Luc has just threatened to kill her, so Walker and Nicholas take her away to Vienna, where Maris and Walker commence a relationship. Walker, who knows nothing about his parents or family background, discovers that he can perform magical acts and has dreams of inhabiting another identity, that of an Austrian named Moritz Benedikt who fought in the First World War and was subsequently murdered. After Maris' brother Ingram loses his lover in an earthquake, Walker is able to foretell, or induce, Ingram's meeting with a certain Michael Billa, who will be a significant person in Ingram's life. (The consequences of Ingram's and Billa's friendship are recounted in Black Cocktail.) Through an acquaintance, screenwriter Philip Strayhorn, Walker meets Venasque, a mystic and teacher who appears in several other Carroll books. With Venasque's help, Walker learns to control his talent, but inadvertently causes Venasque's death because of the strength of his powers. He is contacted by his real father, a little man with no genitals whose name he does not know. The little man is an immortal (and the real-life source of the Rumpelstiltskin legend) who has murdered all Walker's previous incarnations, the last of whom was Moritz Benedikt, because they kept falling in love with women and repudiating the little man's sterile immortality. His father tries to persuade Walker to leave Maris by telling him that she'll mourn him forever and never love anyone else; this above all persuades Walker that his father is selfish and evil. Thanks to his and Maris' complete understanding of each other, Walker is able to discover his father's name in a city which Maris is building him as a birthday present. Walker uses his magic powers to call up the two sisters who originally told the Rumpelstiltskin story to the Grimm brothers. The sisters retell the story, changing it to end with the little man's death. Soon after Maris' and Walker's son is born, a little girl (apparently the original source of the Little Red Riding Hood story) appears on the doorstep and tells Walker: \\"You're dangerous.\\" As Walker observes that \\"nothing in life is done without regret\\", it seems that his and Maris' son has been affected in some way by the vengeful immortals. References in other Carroll novels Like most of Carroll's books, Sleeping in Flame includes a number of highly detailed characters, some of whom appear in other novels. At one point Walker works on a film with director Weber Gregston, who appears in Bones of the Moon and is the narrator of A Child Across the Sky, which also features Philip Strayhorn. Venasque and the Easterlings appear in Outside the Dog Museum. The protagonist of Outside the Dog Museum, Harry Radcliffe, is the subject of an anecdote Venasque tells Walker in \\"Sleeping in Flame\\", and also appears briefly in the hospital scene. Walker and Maris also appear briefly in Carroll's 1995 novel From the Teeth of Angels, in which they have a baby son, Nicholas, who was born with a hole in the heart.

He was born on Nova Scotia's mainland, but grew up in Cape Breton. He worked in the island's underground coal mines operated by the British Empire Steel and Coal Company (BESCO). He also served as a member of the infantry in the Canadian Corps in Flanders during the First World War. After the war he returned to the coal mines and became an official with the mine's United Mine Workers of America (UMW) union. In 1938, he helped bring UMW Local 26 into the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), becoming the first labour local to affiliate with the party.Smith, pp. 79‚Äì80 In 1940, he became the first CCF member elected to the House of Commons of Canada, east of Manitoba.Agnes Macphail, though a supporter of the CCF, was elected to the House of Commons as a member of the United Farmers of Ontario (UFO)-Labour party, not the CCF. Although, she did sit with the CCF caucus during her final years in parliament. While serving in the House, he was known as its leading voice championing labour issues. He was also a main voice for social rights during his 17-years in Parliament. His most notable achievement was securing the funding that allowed the building of a fixed-link between Nova Scotia's mainland and Cape Breton Island at the Strait of Canso: the Canso Causeway. After winning four-straight elections, he was defeated in 1957 and died three- years later in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia. Early life and World War I service He was born on the Nova Scotia mainland, in the town of Londonderry, in 1895. His father, J.H. Gillis, moved the family to the Industrial Cape Breton area in 1904.Harrop, p. 17 J.H. Gillis worked in the coal mines and was an associate of union leader J.B. McLachlan. Clarie, as Clarence Gillis was known, started working in the region's coal mines in 1913.Harrop, p. 18 The next year, he joined the Canadian Corps and rose from private to acting lieutenant.Harrop, p.15-16 He suffered a head wound from shrapnel in Flanders. He would recover enough to go back to the mines after the war. Trade Unionist and Federal MP The period between 1920-1940 was the time that Gillis rose through the ranks of the United Mine Workers of America (UMW) Local 26.He represented the federal riding of Cape Breton South, which mostly included the city of Sydney, from 1940 until his defeat in the 1957 election. Gillis was known as a defender of the working-man, and is credited with popularizing the Mouseland political parable. In 1943, The Ottawa Citizen had an editorial that attacked Cape Breton miners for asking for more butter during wartime rationing. As Gillis pointed out in the House of Commons, Cape Breton miners had amongst the highest enlistment rates in Canada, and their families were needy, not just for butter, but just about every kind of basic food-stuff. His constant support for workers did eventually bring about changes in the latter part of World War II. When labour unions were being attacked in Parliament, Gillis was usually the one called upon to defend them. In 1942, during the speech from the throne debate, H. A. Bruce, the Conservative Party member from Toronto's Parkdale electoral district, was a typical critic of the Canadian Congress of Labor (CCL). Parliamentarians started attacking the American Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), which the CCL was affiliated with, and claiming that its union members were hurting the war-effort. Gillis stood up in Parliament and actively defended the unions, reminding the Commons, that he had been a unionist for over 25-years. Scenes like this were common for Gillis during this period. He was one of the few MPs that attacked the Canadian government's racist policies towards Japanese Canadians in the period between 1942-45. In the House of Commons of Canada, he stated the following: > While we know that the war with Japan is a serious matter and that many > atrocities have been committed by the people of that country, there is no > reason why we should try to duplicate the performances of that country.

Pictured from Left to right: Clarie Gillis, MP for Cape Breton South; David Lewis, National Secretary; M.J. Coldwell, National Leader, MP for Rosetown‚ÄîBiggar; Percy E. Wright, MP for Melfort; and Frank Scott, National Chairman. His defence of Japanese-Canadians arose out of the July 1944 debate on whether to allow them to vote. After questioning from prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, Gillis pointed out that the CCF's official position is that all Canadians, especially those born in Canada, should have the full rights of that citizenship and have the franchise to vote. In the end, Liberal government ignored the CCF's pleas, and passed a law to racially restrict voting for Japanese-Canadians. One of his most notable achievements while in Parliament, was getting federal government funding to build the Canso Causeway to bridge mainland-Nova Scotia to Cape Breton Island.Harrop, pp. 42‚Äì49 The causeway was opened on August 13, 1955, and Gillis was part of the opening ceremonies, though his part was downplayed in the media at the time, as recently deceased former Nova Scotia premier Angus L. MacDonald was given most of the credit.Harrop, p. 49 Personal life and death He failed to get re-elected in the general election of 1957. He ran for parliament for the last time in 1958, the year of the Diefenbaker-Sweep, and lost the election. He retired from politics after this defeat. His first wife, Maime Gillis, n√©e Stewart, died in 1953.Harrop, p.59 He married his second wife, Theresa Sargeant in 1958.Harrop, p.61 He died of pleurisy, in the Glace Bay Hospital, on December 17, 1960, in Cape Breton.

Gervasius and Protasius. History It is said she was from a noble family, and at an early age was baptized, being among the first converts to Christianity in the city of Milan.Monks of Ramsgate. ‚ÄúValeria‚Äù. Book of Saints, 1921. CatholicSaints.Info. 28 April 2017 The reigning Pope had commanded the priests of the area to organize nine decurias, each consisting of five men and five virgins. Their duty was to gather the corpses of Christians who had been martyred in the Coliseum (Flavian Amphitheatre) and other places of martyrdom the preceding day. She was martyred for burying Christian martyrs, and then refusing to sacrifice to the Roman gods. According to one tradition, shortly after the martyrdom of her husband, Vitalis of Milan, in Ravenna, she refused to join in a celebration and sacrifice to pagan gods, and was severely beaten, causing her death two days later in Milan.Dunbar, Agnes Baillie Cunninghame. A Dictionary of Saintly Women, Vol. 2, Bell, 1905 According to another tradition, on 3 June, Valeria was discovered by Roman soldiers searching for Christians. She avowed herself to be one of the faithful. Following terrible tortures, Valeria was beheaded in the Coliseum in the company of several other martyrs. Her remains were gathered by other Christians and were deposited in the Catacombs of Saint Sebastian. Veneration St. Valeria's relics in St. Joseph Co-Cathedral, Thibodaux, Louisiana A mosaic depicting Valeria appears in the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo in Ravenna. A church dedicated to her in Milan was destroyed in 1786.Santa Valeria Canon Charles M. M√©nard (1845‚Äì1896), pastor of St. Joseph Church (now Co-Cathedral) in Thibodaux, Louisiana, made a pilgrimage to Rome in 1867, marking the anniversary of the martyrdom of Saint Peter the Apostle. Longing to bring back an important relic for the veneration of his parishioners, he requested an audience with Cardinal Costantino Patrizi Naro. Patrizi owned two such relics: one of Saint Prosper, as well as part of the arm-bone of Saint Valeria. After much persuasion, the Cardinal agreed to relinquish the latter. The prized relic was placed in a box of pasteboard, and sealed with Cardinal Patrizi's coat of arms. The relic was then sealed in a waxen statue which represented a young woman. It was dressed in a robe of silk moire embroidered with gold and a crimson tunic of velvet and gold ornamented with fringes. It was laid in a coffin-like reliquary of oak and glass from The Netherlands, and decorated with gilded copper. On the morning of 18 April 1868, the steamboat Nina Simmes arrived from New Orleans, by way of Bayou Lafourche, with the reliquary of Saint Valeria. It was placed on the altar of St. Joseph Church, with solemn ceremonies attended by more than four thousand people. Since then, Valeria has been known as the Patroness of Thibodaux, and is especially invoked for protection from storms and floods. On 25 May 1916, a fire began in the sacristy of St. Joseph's, and within minutes it was realized the church would not be saved. Cries of \\"Save Saint Val√©rie! Save Saint Val√©rie!\\" were heard from the onlookers. In fact, the reliquary was one of the few objects saved from the ruins. The reliquary was then brought to the Mount Carmel Convent Chapel until the new church was built, where it was installed with due reverence. The British Museum has in its collection an enameled reliquary sometimes misidentified as that of St. Valeria of Milan, but the reliquary is actually associated with Valerie of Limoges, a different saint.

He carries a tower that can capture any spirit, demon or god within its walls. He also appears in the classic Chinese novels Journey to the West and Fengshen Yanyi (Investiture of the Gods). He is an analogue of Vaisravana. Mythology Li Jing is renowned throughout the Shang Dynasty as a high ranking commander officer of the Old Pond Pass. His wife is Lady Yin, and he has three sons, Jinzha, Muzha, and Nezha. Throughout his past, Li Jing had studied under Superiorman Danger Skipper of Mount Kunlun, and had soon become a master of exceedingly fast underground travel (even to the extent of traveling thousands of miles without a single individual noticing). In time, Li Jing would have a third son by the name of Nezha, as destined by the heavens. He and Nezha's relationship began as rocky because Nezha is disobedient and short-tempered. Nezha would cause untold chaos and trouble in the future, such as that with the Eastern Sea Dragon King Ao Guang. Nezha kills the Dragon King's son and gains his wrath. Due to Nezha causing trouble in the Eastern Sea Dragon's Kingdom, Li Jing was required to give his life to Ao Guang if he did not sacrifice Nezha. But Nezha sacrificed himself, handing over his flesh to his parents. Following the bitter luck attained with his third son, Li Jing burned the sacrificial temple that had been built for Nezha's spirit. However, this made Nezha wish to kill his father. After Nezha was reincarnated, his body remade by his master Taiyi Zhenren, his father saw him and said,\\"You vermin! When you were my child, you caused untold calamities. Why do you reincarnate and disturb the peace?\\" Thus, a major conflict between Li Jing and Nezha began to unfold. After battling Nezha, Li Jing soon realized that his mortal body did not match 1 to 100 compared to that of Nezha's. Thus, he ran as fast as he could underground in a state of incredible fear for his life. Luckily, Li Jing happened to run into his second son, Muzha. Following Muzha's defeat by Nezha's hands, Li Jing tried to commit suicide. Wenshu Guangfa Tianzun interceded, saving Li Jing's life and containing Nezha. Nezha was then forced to submit to his father after being restrained by another superiorman by the name of Randeng Daoren. To effectively restrain his son, Randeng Daoren would teach Li Jing how to use the golden tower art as to trap Nezha within a burning tower if opposed. Thus, Nezha would be forced to submit to Li Jing, or now better known as Li the Pagoda Bearer. References * Fengshen Bang, chapters 12‚Äì14.

The IBRA regions, with the Esperance Plains in red The IBRA regions, with Mallee in red Flora Mallee is a generic term used to describe a number of eucalyptus trees that have an underground bulb called a lignotuber from which new buds can sprout following a forest fire. Mallee trees and accompanying shrubs are thus adapted to the poor soils, lack of rainfall, and regular fires, something common for the dry coast. Fauna Wildlife of the coast includes the highly venomous common death adder. Mammals include tiny honey possums (which feed on nectar of the kangaroo paw flowers) and the endangered western quoll. Birds include the endangered western whipbird, western ground parrots, red-winged fairywren, Australian white ibis, and the rare southwestern Cape Barren goose on the coast.

The operator controlled the steering wheel with his right hand and the speed changing lever with his left hand. The speed of the motor could be varied from 150 revolutions per minute to over 1,500 revolutions per minute. This variation of speed of the motor, in addition to the variable speed from the transmission, allowed a wide range of speed for the Union automobile.

Early life and amateur career Swandell was born Martin Schwendel in the Grand Duchy of Baden in July of 1841; the exact day of his birth is unknown. He emigrated to Brooklyn sometime before 1863, the year he joined the Eckford team in the NABBP. That year, Eckford went 10-0 and won the NABBP championship, while Swandell was the league's top hitter by averaging four hits per game. Swandell remained with Eckford until 1867, following which he joined the Mutual of New York side for three years. He returned to the Eckford club in 1871, and subsequently remained with them when they joined the NA in 1872. National Association career Prior to the Eckford side joining the NA, Swandell umpired two games in the league in 1871; one of them was the decisive final game of the year between Athletic of Philadelphia and the Chicago White Stockings that determined the league champion. Swandell was the oldest member of the Eckfords during their 1872 season in the NA and one of the oldest in the league overall. He appeared in 14 games for the team, appearing in multiple games at third base and center field, while also starting games at first and second base. As a batter, he had 12 hits in 52 at-bats for a .231 average, nearly matching the team's average of .232. Swandell struggled defensively, recording 17 errors in six games at third and eight errors in five games in center; his fielding percentage was far below the league averages at the position. While with the Eckfords, Swandell umpired nine games away from Brooklyn, mostly those featuring the New York Mutuals. With the Eckfords folding after a 3-26 season, Swandell joined the new Elizabeth Resolutes for 1873. Swandell appeared in two games for the Resolutes, who did little better by going 2-21, and went one-for-nine (.111) at the plate while making two errors in the field. These were his last as a player, but he stayed active in the NA as an umpire, working fifteen games in 1873 and two more in 1874. Post-baseball career By 1880, Swandell had left baseball to run a Brooklyn bakery. According to census records and city directories of the era, he still ran the bakery in 1890, and had also returned to using Schwendel, his surname of birth. He continued to live in Brooklyn up until his death on October 25, 1906.

Biography Breeze had his first one-person show in 1965 in Vancouver when he showed his Lovers in a Landscape series. It received much acclaim: the Vancouver Sun compared him with Francis Bacon. These fourteen paintings in the series have naked figures in some sort of combination to strip the skin off the sick 1960s, the artist said. His Sunday Afternoon (from an old American Photograph) (1965, Department of External Affairs Collection) was featured in the first issue of arts/canada in January 1967 by editor Barry Lord. In painting it, Breeze was inspired by a photograph in a University of British Columbia newspaper, The Ubyssey, of a lynching in the United States. During the 1970s, Breeze painted a variety of subjects and styles, from landscape, regarded as a landscape of signs, to abstraction. In the early 1980s, Breeze\`s love of martial arts and the orient led to a series of paintings and lithographs. (Each of the paintings had a wrapped weapon.) During the late 1980s and 1990s, Breeze used computer technology in his work. Breeze has exhibited his paintings in numerous solo and group shows around the world. His work is found in public, corporate and private collections, including Canada's National Gallery of Canada. Among his works are several pieces of public art, including Spacing...

He was the husband of New Zealand historian Margaret Alington. Biographic details and major works=Education and early years Alington was born in Lower Hutt in 1929. He attended Waiwhetu School, and later Hutt Valley High School, where he was taught by James Coe. Alington began his career as an architectural cadet in the New Zealand Ministry of Works (MoW) in 1949, before studying architecture at the Auckland University College School of Architecture (Auckland, New Zealand) from 1951 to 1955. Early influences of this time include Gordon Wilson, who was the Government Architect at the time, MoW cadet supervisor James (Jim) Beard, who was to become something of a mentor to Alington during the early part of his career, and Professor Richard Toy of Auckland University College School of Architecture. Upon returning to the MoW after his graduation, Alington was assigned to the Hydro-Electricity department where he worked for a short, but influential, time under Chris Valenduuk. Here Alington was responsible for designing the Bulls Water Tower (1956), and the Power House and Control Building for the Waipapa Dam (1956). In 1955 Alington married Margaret Hilda Broadhead. They have three children. In 1956 Alington left New Zealand, travelling to London, Europe; and on a Fulbright Travelling Scholarship, to Illinois in the United States. During 1956-1957 he worked in the London office of Robert Matthew and Johnson-Marshall on, among other projects, New Zealand House (London, England), and Ruddington Secondary Modern School (Nottingham, England). During this time he and his wife Margaret embarked on a tour of western Europe, fulfilling his desire to see firsthand the large medieval cathedrals, as well as key works of Modernist architecture including Le Corbusier's Ronchamp Chapel and Unit√© d‚ÄôHabitation in Marseille. From 1957 to 1959 Alington completed a MArch degree at the University of Illinois‚Äô School of Architecture at Urbana, in the United States, during which time he had occasion to meet with Mies van der Rohe. While in the United States Alington took the opportunity to visit buildings by Frank Lloyd Wright and Mies van der Rohe. The Ministry of Works years On his return to New Zealand Alington resumed work as an architect with the MoW, with notable buildings of this time including the Gisborne Courthouse (Gisborne, 1962), and the Meteorological Office (Wellington, 1965). Alington also designed his own house (Alington House, Wellington, 1962); an important building in his oeuvre, revealing the strong influences of both Mies van der Rohe, and Alington‚Äôs former cadet supervisor at the MoW, James Albert Beard. The Alington house was awarded an NZIA Wellington Branch Enduring Architecture award in 2002, and an NZIA (National) Enduring Architecture award in 2007. It was also listed as a Category 1 Protected Building on the New Zealand Historic Places Trust register in 2007. Private practice(s) thumb250pxrightUpper Hutt Civic Centre; Administration building (left) and Council Chambers (right). (photograph by Michael Dudding) thumb250pxrightWellington High School (photograph by Michael Dudding) In 1965, Alington moved into private practice, accepting a partnership offered by Allot Gabites and James Beard in their architectural practice of Gabites and Beard. This partnership merged with Toomath and Wilson in 1971, becoming Gabites Toomath Beard Wilson and Partners. Although this ‚Äòsuper-practice‚Äô was to win the only two NZIA national medals awarded in 1972 (Alington for the Upper Hutt Civic Centre, and Toomath for the Karori Teachers‚Äô College), the firm proved to be short-lived, and in that same year splintered under the weight of too many personalities. William Toomath and Derek Wilson took on new partners, becoming Toomath Wilson Irvine Anderson (TWIA), while Beard formed his own practice under the name of James Beard & Co. Alington remained with Al Gabites, and together with Derrick Edmondson formed Gabites Alington Edmonson. In 1978, George Porter joined the practice as a partner, prompting yet another name change to Gabites Porter and Partners. In 1983, Alington set up his own architectural practice: Alington Group Architects. He retired from professional practice in 2000. Much of Alington's work during the 1970s has taken the form of institutional projects including work for civic councils, and educational institutions such as schools and universities. Some examples of these are: * VUW School of Music Kelburn, Wellington 1984 * NZ Chancery New Delhi (unbuilt project) 1984 * Boulevard Hotel (unrealised project) 1984 * Dunedin City Council Administration Building (competition entry) 1979 * Waipa County Offices Te Awamutu 1977 * Wellington High School Wellington, 1973 * NZ Chancery New Delhi (unbuilt project) 1973 * Upper Hutt Civic Centre Upper Hutt 1972 * Helen Lowry Halls of Residence Karori, Wellington, 1972 * Massey University Halls of Residence Palmerston North, 1970 Alington has also carried out a large number of church projects, including: Stokes Valley Methodist Church (Stokes Valley, 1966), St Michael's Anglican Church Extension (Wellington, 1971), St Peter's Anglican Church Alterations (Wellington, 1978), St Mary's Anglican Church Extension 1988 (New Plymouth), Karori Baptist Church (Wellington, 1990), St Mary's Anglican Church Extension (Wellington, 1993). He was a Wellington Anglican Diocesan Synods Person 1972-1990. In 1972, Alington was appointed honorary lecturer and tutor at Victoria University of Wellington's School of Architecture & Design, lecturing in architectural history. He also taught at the University of Auckland as a visiting lecturer in 1982. Other professional posts held include: NZIA branch committee executive member (1961‚Äì1969), NZIA journal assistant editor (1964‚Äì1969), NZIA councillor, vice president, branch chairman (1977‚Äì1979), and Architectural Centre president (1970‚Äì1972).

Lester was one of the Philadelphian cricketers who played from the end of the 19th century until the outbreak of World War I. His obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, described him as \\"one of the great figures in American cricket.\\" During his career, he played in 53 matches for the Philadelphians, 47 of which are considered first class. From 1897 until his retirement in 1908, Lester led the batting averages in Philadelphia and captained all the international home matches. Early life and career Lester was born in Penrith in Cumberland, England in 1871. He began playing cricket at a very young age. He was playing a game in Yorkshire in 1892 when he met Dr. Isaac Sharpless. Sharpless was the president of Haverford College, and invited him to the United States to attend the school. In his early days as a student in Cumberland's Ackworth School, he had been described as a \\"very indifferent batsman\\". It was only after entering Haverford that he developed his batting style.Melville, Tom, The Tented Field, Bowling Green State University Popular Press, Ohio (1998), , p.135-136 As a student at Haverford, Lester excelled as an athlete and a scholar and played football, track, tennis, and soccer. During his freshman year, he averaged 100.5 runs per innings. Lester also won the Cope Bat every year during his time at Haverford. In his final season with the school in 1896, he scored 1,185 total runs and took 40 wickets for averages of 79 and 23.2, respectively. He also captained Haverford on their first overseas tour, scoring 105 against the MCC on his first appearance at Lord's. On this tour, he created a great impression with an average of over 84 and prepared himself for the Philadelphian's tour of England the following year. Tour of England in 1897 The tour undertaken by the Philadelphian cricketers was very ambitious. Though the results might have been less satisfactory than hoped for by its promoters, the tour was arranged mainly for educational purposes and few of those on the American side expected to win many matches. Previous tours had tended to involve amateur English sides as opponents, with a low level of competition. In 1897 a schedule was prepared including all of the top county cricket teams, the Oxford and Cambridge University teams, the Marylebone Cricket Club, and two other sides, though only a few of the counties thought it worthwhile to put their best elevens onto the field. Starting on June 7 at Oxford, the tour lasted for two months and ended in late July at The Oval. While it initially aroused some curiosity, many English fans lost interest until John Lester and the Philadelphians met the full Sussex team at Brighton on June 17. Behind a dominant bowling performance by Bart King, Lester helped to seal the victory with his batting. In the first innings, Lester and King were partners in a fourth-wicket stand of 107, with Lester top-scoring with 92. He continued in the second innings with 34 not out. Bart King partnered Lester in a stand of 107 against Sussex in 1897 Despite the excitement surrounding Lester's and King's performances, the Americans did not fare well overall. Fifteen matches were played, but only two were won, while the team lost nine and earned a draw in four. The other win came against Warwickshire. During this match at Edgbaston, Lester scored 35 runs in the first innings and 67 in the second. Lester was the best batsmen on the Philadelphian side; beginning with 72 not out in his first match, he kept up his form all through the tour, scoring 891 runs for an average 37.12. Several counties offered him contracts to play in England. Tours of England in 1903 and 1908 John Lester was chosen to captain the Philadelphians in 1903 and 1908 on their tours to England. Against Leicestershire in August 1903, Lester made his highest score in first-class cricket. In the first innings, he made 126 not out, and this was followed by a respectable 64 in the second innings. His batting on this tour so impressed the critics that he was called the \\"one batsman (among the Philadelphians) who may almost (be) described as great\\" and that he \\"would soon be one of the greatest men of his day\\"Melville, p. 136, quoting Manchester Guardian, July 10, 1903, John Lester, A Century of Philadelphia Cricket, 1951, and Cricket, July 23, 1903 In his last first-class match on the 1908 tour, Lester posted a score of 34 in the first innings, but was dismissed LBW for nought in the second innings. He did manage to take 4 wickets in the Philadelphians' loss to Kent. Legacy and later life John Lester posing at bat in later life John Lester helped to lift Philadelphia cricket to the highest levels of international play with his leadership and understanding of the sport. He is one of the few American cricketers noted in Cricket Scores and Biographies, which said that he was \\"a watchful batsman who could hit well and had plenty of strokes and strong defence.\\"Quoted in In 1951 he authored A Century of Philadelphia Cricket, which was a definitive history of the game in the area. Lester was also integral in the foundation of the C.C. Morris Cricket Library when he proposed in 1964 that cricket, \\"with a history and literature second to none should be given a permanent home in the United States.\\"Quoted in In 1969, he made his final public appearance at a cricket function when the library was opened at Haverford. Lester received his PhD in education from Harvard University in 1902 and for many years was head of the English department at The Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania and served as a university professor. He died in 1969 and as a lasting memorial, the pavilion at Cope Field is named in his honor.

It depicts Valeria standing on the far right, beside Conan. Art by Harold Saylor De Lay. Valeria is a pirate and adventuress (a member of The Red Brotherhood of pirates) in the fictional universe of Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian stories. She appears in Robert E. Howard's Conan novella \\"Red Nails\\", serialized in Weird Tales 28 1-3 (July, August/September & October 1936). This was the last Conan story written by Howard, and published posthumously. The name was also used for Conan's love interest in the 1982 film Conan the Barbarian. Description Robert E. Howard described Valeria in \\"Red Nails\\" as follows: Reception The character is a powerful, active figure, but is also sometimes rendered helpless for the titillation of the reader. As Winter Elliott writes, Valeria \\"represents a mediation between the possibilities of female agency and her own gendered identity. As Conan points out, Valeria can't escape the simple fact of her femininity. As such, her identity is structured by her society. Like Conan, Valeria's pursuit of freedom against her society's wishes marginalizes her, making her other, but it also forces Howard to go to extravagant lengths to substantiate her femininity, which he does by including not one, but two female bondage scenes. If she can be subjected to such sexual humiliation, Howard implies, she must be female... What happens to Valeria is more about the needs of the reading/viewing audience than her own action or inaction. Valeria in those sexually debased moments isn't a character in and of herself, but rather a narrative tool designed to provoke a response from the readers.\\"  In other media  *Valeria had a major role in the 1982 film Conan the Barbarian, where she was played by Sandahl Bergman, although the character portrayed in the film differed from Howard's character, having a romantic relationship with Conan and borrowing characteristics from B√™lit, another character by Howard. Valeria is killed during the course of the film, but assists Conan in spirit form. *Valeria appeared as an ally of the player in the 2008 MMO Age of Conan and began to rule Tortage after the fall of the tyrant Strom.

In Biographical Memoirs. National Academy of Sciences 2006;87:164-179. . Fulltext. Reprinted from Proc Am Phil Soc 2004;148(3):382-393. PDF . Biography Fredrickson was born in Canon City, Colorado. His father was a county judge and the owner of Fredrickson Brown, an independent insurance agency. After high school he commenced medical school at the University of Colorado, but completed his studies at the University of Michigan after being transferred there by the army. During a cycling trip in the Netherlands he met his future wife, Priscilla Eekhof, and they married two years later. They would have two sons. Between 1949 and 1952 he worked as a resident and subsequently as a fellow in internal medicine at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital (now part of Brigham and Women's Hospital) in Boston. Much of his published work from this period is in the field of endocrinology. Subsequently he spent a year in the laboratory of Ivan Frantz, a cholesterol biochemist, at Massachusetts General Hospital. Lipid research In 1953 he took up a post at the National Heart Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. Initially, he worked with protein chemist and Nobel laureate Christian B. Anfinsen, and subsequently (with Daniel Steinberg) developed an interest in the metabolism of cholesterol and lipoproteins, as well as related medical conditions such as Niemann-Pick disease. His group identified Tangier disease (HDL deficiency)Fredrickson DS, Altrocchi PH, Avioli LV, Goodman DS, Goodman HC. Tangier disease. Ann Intern Med 1961;55:1016-1031. and cholesteryl ester storage disease, two inborn errors of cholesterol metabolism. He played a prime role in the identification of several apolipoproteins (proteins that characterise the nature of a blood lipid particle): APOA2, APOC1, APOC2 and APOC3. In 1967 Fredrickson co-authored the paper that described the classification of lipoprotein abnormalities in five types, depending on the pattern of lipoprotein electrophoresis; this became known as the Fredrickson classification. It was adopted as the mondial standard by the World Health Organization in 1972. His group also conducted the first trials of pharmacological cholesterol reduction in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. Textbooks From 1960 he worked, with John Stanbury and James Wyngaarden, on several editions of the encyclopedic medical textbook The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease.Stanbury JB, Wyngaarden JB, Fredrickson DS (Eds). The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. New York, Toronto, and London: McGraw-Hill, 1960. Directorships Fredrickson at NIH in 1976 Apart from his work in research, Fredrickson was involved in the management of the NHI from an early stage. He was clinical director from 1960 onward and from 1966 general director of NHI. In 1974 he left the NHI (then already the National Heart and Lung Institute) to head the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences. Nine months later he was asked by president Gerald Ford to become head of the National Institutes of Health, a task he commenced on 1975-06-01. One of the main issues that occupied him was the controversy over research involving recombinant DNA. Already in 1973 there had been scientists urging a ban on such research for environmental reasons. Fredrickson released a guideline that restricted release of genetically modified organisms into the environment, and called into existence a body that would advise on these matters and had to approve any NIH research involving recombinant DNA technology. Fredrickson is credited with restoring confidence in this form of research. A second controversy involved congressional control over the NIH in general. Some feel that Fredrickson's decision to resign from his position in 1981 was fuelled by these controversies. The recombinant DNA controversy was the subject of a book published by Fredrickson in 2001.Fredrickson DS. The Recombinant DNA Controversy: A Memoir, Science, Politics, and the Public Interest 1974-1981. ASM press, 2001. . After 1981 Fredrickson was scholar-in-residence at the National Academy of Sciences for two years, but in 1983 he was recruited to become the vice-president of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, a privately run health research charity. At that stage, the institute was still the owner of the Hughes Aircraft Company, and Fredrickson participated in the negotiations that led to the sale (for $5.2 billion) to General Motors. He made substantial changes to the institute's research programme. He resigned in 1987 when the trustees of the institute discovered that there had been financial malversations under his presidency. Later years Fredrickson returned to the NIH, resuming work on lipid diseases and writing for the National Library of Medicine. He participated in the genetic elucidation of Tangier disease, which he had himself described in the 1960s. He was personal physician to Hassan II of Morocco, and had a close personal friendship with the king until the latter's death in 1999. He was found dead, face-down, in his swimming pool in 2002. He is buried in Leiden, the Netherlands. His papers are held at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland. ReferencesExternal links * The Donald S.

It was on the back of the chassis, then in the center, then to the front, and back again to the rear of the automobile. The early motors were built at the Lambert factories of the Buckeye Manufacturing Company and later they were outsourced to other proprietary manufactures.Kimes, p. 835 Chassis and suspension The Lambert chassis of the high end employed a three-point suspension to save driving power by decreasing the lift required of the automobile body because of road surface variations. It saved wear and tear on the automobile body and its parts. The others used ordinary suspension.Dolnar, p. 228 Sometimes a shaft drive was provided on some models, however most Lambert automobile models were with a chain drive to the rear axle. Powertrain The Lambert automobile chassis with the gearless friction drive speed change transmission was the basis for the Lambert automobiles and trucks built from 1906 through 1916. The valve action of the engines were hardened steel cams that were applied to the cam shaft. The cam faces were slightly convex, and worked on hardened rollers, carried in swinging forks, which bore against square ended sliders. The valves were alumimum heads driven to shoulder on riveted steel stems. The valve action was direct with no side action on the sliders. The compression was between 50 and 55 pounds of pressure.Dolnar, p. 226a The Lambert opposed cylinder motor had a number of features not usual in that form of gas engine in that era. For example, the oiler was of the precision variety, in which a ratchet actuated worm drive a worm gear carrying a spring actuated oil force pump successively over the oil leads to be supplied, the plunge spring being compressed by a circle of wedges, and the rise from each compression being regulated by an individual temper screw. Oil leads dropped oil on the crank wrist rod ends. The cranks had full disk arms and the crank shaft journals ran in bronze bearings. Racing success Lambert came in second in an automobile race conducted in July 1905 from Chicago to St. Paul. There were a total of 53 automobiles entered into the race and Lambert's was the only gasoline powered automobile to finish. The success of Lambert's automobile against others of was attributed to the Lambert friction gearing disk drive transmission.Anderson Morning Herald, July 6th, 1905, p. 1 Some of the models of the Lambert automobiles and trucks are described below.

History  The monastery was founded in 814 on the river Inde by Benedict of Aniane, an adviser to Emperor Louis the Pious (successor to Charlemagne). The monastery was at first known as the \\"Monastery of the Redeemer on the Inde\\".Ardo Smeragdus. Vita sancti Benedicti Anianensis et Indensis abbatis In the mid-9th century, the monastery became an Imperial abbey (\\"Reichsunmittelbar\\") and received large endowments of land, as well as Biblical or Saviour's relics: a loincloth, a sudarium and two shroud-like cloths.G√≥rny, Grzegorz. \\"The Aachen Relics\\", Witnesses to Mystery: Investigations into Christ's Relics, Ignatius Press, 2013, In 875, one of the shrouds was exchanged for a relic of the head of the martyred Pope Cornelius (died in 253), after which the abbey was known as Sancti Cornelii ad Indam, and later as Kornelim√ºnster. (The full official title of the present monastery is the Abbey of the Abbot Saint Benedict of Aniane and Pope Cornelius).

The name changed officially in 1905 to the Lambert Automobile Company and the Union Automobile Company name was dropped. A better quality automobile was then manufactured from the Union automobile.Dolnar, pp. 225-228 The Lambert Automobile Company was founded by automotive pioneer John William Lambert. The company was based in Anderson, Indiana. In the eleven years from 1905 through 1916 the company manufactured not only automobiles but trucks, fire engines and farm tractors as well. The Lambert automobile was the signature product of the company however. The company always made their own bodies, but sometimes had the engines manufactured by different independent motor builders. These outsourced motors done by manufacturers like Buda, Rutenber, Continental, Trebert, and Daviswere were always of Lambert's design. The upholstery used on the interiors was of the best quality and the final body finish was done with fifteen coats of paint.Kimes, p. 835 In 1906 Lambert produced the first \\"Lambert\\" automobile. With this line Lambert established himself as one of the more successful automobile manufacturers of that time period. Most of his automobiles were chain-driven rather than shaft driven. Production of automobiles and trucks had reached two thousand vehicles per year from 1906 to 1910. In 1910 the company had over a thousand employees and from 1910 to 1915 the production had reached about three thousand vehicles per year. It only produced about one thousand vehicles in 1916 and only a few vehicles in 1917. The Lambert Automobile Company manufactured the Lambert automobile through the Buckeye Manufacturing Company which had several subsidiaries.The Horseless Age: The Automobile Trade Magazine, p. 127Anderson Morning Herald, June 24, 1904, p. 3; March 14, 1905, p. 8; March 21, 1905, p. 1; April 30, 1905, p. 2; May 10, 1905, p. 1; May 24, 1905, p. 1; June 16, 1909, p. 1; November 18, 1909, p. 8; Jan. 27, 1911, p. 8; March 11, 1911, p. 8Anderson Sunday Herald; Anderson, Indiana; November 16, 1958Brandon, p. 180 One of the main features of the Lambert automobile was the friction gearing disk drive transmission. When the United States entered into World War I the factory was converted for national defense in 1917. The company then made ammunition shells, caisson wheels and military fire engines. When the war ended Lambert did not resume automobile production. He realized automobiles were only going to be made by large manufactures. The Buckeye Manufacturing Company stopped manufacturing automobile parts permanently in 1922. Additional There are only four known Lambert automobiles in existence as of the year 2008.

He previously played for the Oakland Athletics, Minnesota Twins, and Atlanta Braves. Prior to playing professionally, Suzuki attended Cal State Fullerton and won the Johnny Bench Award and Brooks Wallace Award. The Athletics drafted Suzuki in the second round of the 2004 MLB draft. He made his MLB debut in 2007. In 2019, Suzuki caught for the Nationals as they won the World Series. He has now won both the College World Series and MLB World Series. Early life Suzuki was born to Warren and Kathleen Suzuki in Wailuku, Hawaii and attended Henry Perrine Baldwin High School from which he graduated in 2001. Suzuki was mentored as a youth by Hawaiian MLB scout Walter Isamu Komatsubara. He managed a .328 batting average as a senior at Baldwin. College career Suzuki attended California State University, Fullerton, where he played college baseball for the Cal State Fullerton Titans baseball team. CSUF appeared in the 2003 College World Series and captured the 2004 College World Series championship, thanks to Suzuki's two-out RBI single in the bottom of the seventh inning, giving the Titans a 3-2 win over the Texas Longhorns. That year, he won the Johnny Bench Award as the country's top collegiate catcher. He was also selected All-American by two publications, Baseball America and Collegiate Baseball. He was also the recipient of the first-ever Brooks Wallace Award. Professional career=Draft and minor leagues The Athletics drafted Suzuki in the second round of the 2004 Major League Baseball draft and assigned him to the Single-A Short Season Vancouver Canadians, where he batted .297 and committed just one error in 46 games. His first full season of professional baseball came in 2005, with Single-A team the Stockton Ports. Playing in 114 games, Suzuki put up a .277 average, 12 home runs, 65 RBIs and a .440 slugging percentage. Moving up to the Double-A Midland RockHounds in 2006, Suzuki batted .285 with a .392 OBP.

Oakland Athletics Oakland Athletics in 2012 Suzuki joined the major league club on June 9, 2007, after rarely used catcher Adam Melhuse was traded to the Texas Rangers and made his debut three days later as a pinch hitter in a game against the Houston Astros. He served as backup to veteran Jason Kendall until Kendall was traded to the Chicago Cubs on July 16, making Suzuki the Athletics everyday catcher. On July 17, 2007, pitcher Shane Komine got into a game in the eighth inning against the Texas Rangers with Suzuki doing the catching. This marked the first time in major league baseball history that there was a battery where both players were from Hawaii. On September 10, 2007, Suzuki hit his first career grand slam in the second inning against the Seattle Mariners. For the 2008 season, Suzuki was the starting catcher while Rob Bowen served as backup. In the first 20 regular season games, Suzuki started 18. He ended the season with a .279 batting average in 148 games. During the 2009 season, Suzuki had a career-high 15 home runs and 88 RBIs, and batted .274 in 147 games. Suzuki led the A's in RBIs, and became only the second catcher in the franchise's history to do so. He also led the team in hits (156), doubles (37) and total bases (240), and was second in home runs and runs scored behind teammate Jack Cust. On July 23, 2010, Suzuki signed a four-year extension with the Oakland Athletics, estimated to be worth $16.25 million.

She is a USA Today bestselling author and the winner of a 2001 award from Romantic Times. Under her married name she writes historical romances set in medieval Scotland, and as Allie Mackay she writes Scottish-set paranormal romances. Biography Welfonder is of Scottish ancestry and was born and raised in Florida, United States. She worked as a flight attendant for twenty years, flying primarily international routes because she is fluent in German. After spending several years living in Dallas, Texas, she met her husband in Munich, Germany, where they lived for fifteen years. They have since returned to Florida. Welfonder learned to read before she entered school and has long been an avid reader. She began corresponding with her favorite romance author Becky Lee Weyrich, describing her travels. Weyrich encouraged her to try writing romances. For the next five years, Welfonder struggled to become a published author. While working on her novel, she also published several travel articles, a short story in the anthology Chocolate for a Lover's Heart, and various articles in her clan's newsletter. She completed four manuscripts in that time. She submitted only two of these for publication. The first, a paranormal romance with a ghost hero, was rejected by multiple publication houses. Discouraged by these rejections, she would often stop writing for weeks or months. She submitted a second of her manuscripts, Devil in a Kilt, to Warner Books, and it was purchased within two weeks. That novel and those that have followed are historical romances, set in Scotland in the medieval time period. Many of her novels also contain elements of the paranormal. Welfonder sets her novels in Scotland as a tribute to her own Scottish heritage, and she has extensively studied Scottish history and culture since childhood. She is an active member of the Macfie Clan Society of North America. Her ideas generally appear to her when she is visiting the places that will become a book's settings. Once she has identified the right atmosphere, she first envisions the book's eventual hero, who is usually an \\"Alpha male: super-sexy, dark, and dashingly handsome.\\" Once the hero's backstory has been fleshed out, Welfonder plans an appropriate heroine. Each story is fully planned well before Welfonder begins writing, although occasionally she detours from her plan. She does her own research and often reads reference books about Scotland or the medieval period for fun. Each book takes her approximately six to eight months to write. When she is finished, Welfonder does not read any reviews of the book if at all possible. Negative reviews distract her, and often leave her unable to write for days at a time. In 2006 Welfonder released Highlander in My Bed, a Scottish-set paranormal romance, under the pseudonym Allie Mackay. For her pen name she chose Scottish names which were also family names, and made sure the new name was shorter than her existing name.

It is not to be confused with the 1969 film by the same title. The Minx was written in collaboration with Vincent Francone and shot on location in Chicago and Hong Kong in late 2005 and early 2006. It was picked up for distribution by Echelon Entertainment of Glendale, California and was released on DVD in the United States on May 15, 2007.Ruth L Ratny presents REEL CHICAGO  Welcome The film's world premiere, held at Schuba's Tavern in Chicago, was a \\"Recommended\\" screening by Cine-File, Chicago's guide to independent and alternative cinema.http://www.cine- file.info/list-archive/MAY-07-2.htm Plot The Minx is by turns an action/thriller and a comedy. The film's plot details the adventures of Linnea Chiang, a mild-mannered tobacconist by day and a masked master thief by night; like some modern day Robin Hood, the black vinyl-clad \\"Minx\\" robs large corporations and gives the money away to homeless people on the streets of Chicago. Over the course of the film's plot turns, Linnea develops relationships with two very different men: Joseph Van Zwick, the ruthless CEO of the corrupt \\"World Energy\\" company, and Edgar Alvarez, an idealistic young reporter for \\"The Windy City Weekly,\\" Chicago's leading alternative newspaper. In an ironic twist, Edgar is assigned to write a story on the Minx, never dreaming that Linnea, the woman he has become romantically involved with, could be her alter-ego. As both of these men, as well as Chief Inspector Chiapetti of the Chicago police, begin to close in on the Minx's true identity, Linnea is forced to make a decision about her future that will affect the lives of everyone involved. History The Minx was shot on a shoestring budget in only ten days over a span of several months. It was made using 24p digital video technology while the cast and crew worked mostly for free. Most of the actors in the movie are well known in the world of Chicago theater, television and independent film; among the cast members are noted thespians Mia Park (host of television's Chic-a-Go-Go), Circus-Szalewski and Duane Sharp (star of Zen Noir). The Minx is dedicated to filmmakers Louis Feuillade and Chor Yuen. Quotes Tagline: Your heart isn't the only thing she'll steal Linnea: \\"I feel the deepest part of me awakening.\\" Joe: \\"My kind of culture somehow just doesn't jibe with karma and reincarnation. I'm just not temperamentally suited for it, you know what I mean? I grew up masturbating to Marilyn Monroe.\\" News Anchor: \\"Although it appears from this security camera image that the Minx is female, Chief Chiapetti has said that because of the daring nature of some of her acrobatic feats it is possible that the Minx could be a man disguised as a woman.\\" Linnea: \\"Maybe the Minx is just a down to earth girl who wants to play more than one role in this life. Maybe she'd like to play as many roles as she can because she knows one day death is going to strip us all of our costumes and make us completely equal in the grave.\\" Joe: \\"What's that bitch gonna do in Hong Kong?\\" ReferencesExternal links Worst of Netflix Review 2007 films American action comedy films English-language films American independent films American action thriller films American films ","title":"The Minx"},{"id":"9530832","text":"Red and White Army is a term applied to sports teams that play in the colours Red and White and is also ascribed to their respective supporters.

In the American entertainment industry, the studio zone, also known as the thirty- mile zone (TMZ), is the area traditionally marked roughly around a radius from the southwest corner of West Beverly Boulevard and North La Cienega Boulevard in Los Angeles, California. It is considered the \\"local area\\" for the purposes of determining employee benefits. The boundaries of the 30-mile radius includes almost all of the southern half of Los Angeles County, as well as parts of eastern Ventura County and northwestern Orange County. Usage Entertainment industry labor unions use the studio zone to determine per diem rates, work rules, and workers' compensation for union workers. For example, entertainment works produced within the area are considered \\"local\\" and workers are generally responsible to pay for their own transportation and meals; those outside the zone are considered \\"on location\\" and the studios are generally expected to pay for these things. During most of the 20th century, the Hollywood entertainment industry preferred to film movies and television shows within the studio zone to reduce labor costs. Thus, the zone largely determined the location and success of the original movie ranches in or near Hollywood. By establishing movie ranches around the periphery of the zone, studios could take advantage of Los Angeles's varied landscape. With clever editing, it was easy to use a few aerial and location shots (usually shot by a second unit), along with carefully dressed sets, to give viewers the impression that a movie or show was set elsewhere. The studio zone itself, as well as the lack of motion picture production companies and experienced personnel outside the zone, made it expensive to film on location, since movie studios had to bring everything needed from Los Angeles. In turn, anyone who wanted to start a career in the entertainment industry had to move to Los Angeles to break into the studio zone. History The studio zone's boundaries have expanded over the years, primarily to keep labor costs down and help keep Los Angeles as an attractive site to shoot productions. The studio zone was formally first established in 1934, originally defined as a radius from Rossmore Avenue and 5th Street. By 1970, the center of the zone became Beverly and La Cienega Boulevards, the then-headquarters of the Association of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), and expanded to a 30-mile radius. In addition to the traditional 30-mile radius from Beverly and La Cienega Boulevards, the studio zone also includes some locations that technically lie outside the area, such as the Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer Conejo Ranch near Thousand Oaks in Ventura County, and Castaic Lake in northwest Los Angeles County. This site also states that the Long Beach Dome is \\"considered to be in the studio zone\\", but the designation is redundant for this specific location, as it lies within the 30-mile radius. In 2010, additional locations were added: Agua Dulce, the entire community of Castaic (in addition to Castaic Lake), Leo Carrillo State Park, Moorpark, Ontario International Airport, Piru, and Pomona (including the Fairplex of which a small portion is jurisdictionally in La Verne).IATSE/AMPTP Deal: 2% Wage Increases and First-Time Ever Health Premiums - The Hollywood ReporterSagaftra.org With respect to the locations added in 2010, producers are required to grant reasonable requests to actors for hotel accommodations if the locations listed above lie over four miles outside of the original thirty mile zone.Sagaftra.org Locations rejected in negotiations included adding Lancaster and Port Hueneme to the zone.Business Representative  IA.T.S.E. Local 80 The addition of Pomona to the studio zone has led to an increase in filming in that city.Land of Lincoln comes to Pomona via Hollywood Since the 1990s, many countries and other U.S. states have offered generous tax credits or deductions to offset the much higher cost of filming on location. The result was what Hollywood people call runaway production. Places such as New Orleans, Louisiana; Atlanta, Georgia; and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada have become popular‚Äîand cheaper‚Äîalternatives to filming in Los Angeles and New York City.

It was used as a panacea against poisonings with criminal intent, as well as against mushroom poisonings, snakebite, scorpion stings, bites by rabid animals, and the plague.  Origins  Gerolamo Ferranti started producing and selling orvi√©tan in early 17th-century Paris. He was a fairground attraction, asking onlookers to give him unknown poisons to swallow and watch him cure himself with the remedy. Other charlatans in the business were Jean Vitrario, Desiderio Descombes, and Cristoforo Contugi. Though most physicians and pharmacists were skeptical, the reputed medical doctor Johann Schr√∂der published his own recipe in Pharmacopeia Medico-Chymica in 1655. The first pharmacist to include orvi√©tan in his compendium was Moyse Charas in Pharmacop√©e Royale Gal√©nique et Chymique, 1676.  Ingredients  Orvietan was a concoction of partially toxic herbs, wine, and dissolved honey, but existed in powdered form too (sold in lead boxes). Patrizia Catellani and Renzo Console analyzed 35 different recipes for mixing orvietan, published between 1655 and 1857. The number of ingredients varies from 9 to 57. The most frequent 26 ingredients are: garden angelica, healing wolfsbane, birthwort, bistort, sweet flag, Carline thistle, dittany, gentian, masterwort, black salsify, tormentil, valerian, blessed thistle, dittany of Crete, rue, germander, laurel berries, juniper berries, cinnamon, cloves, viper meat, and the two concoctions mithridate and theriac, as well as white wine and honey.  Literary references  Literary works mentioning orvietan include: * Tabarin's Inventaire Universel des ≈íuvres de Tabarin (1622), * Moli√®re's L'Amour m√©decin (1665), * Voltaire's Pot-pourri (1765), * Mme de Sevigne's correspondence, * Balzac's Le P√®re Goriot, * Alexander Dumas p√®re's Marquise de Ganges, * Victor Hugo's L'homme qui rit * Walter Scott's Kenilworth (1821), though Scott translates it as Venice treacle * Walter Scott's The Talisman (1825), in Chapter XXI King Richard notes \\"I have but to take a drachm of orvietan by way of precaution, though it is needless\\" after sucking poison from a wound. * Francis Parkman, in his La Salle and the Discovery of the Great West (1869), notes the explorer Louis Hennepin's devotion to the use of orvietan, \\"the famous panacea of his time\\", as an antidote to the toxic effects of various plants eaten while a captive of the Sioux in 1680 * La Salle's Tonty also used orvietan as he noted in Relation of Henri de Tonty Concerning the Explorations of La Salle from 1678 to 1683, Melvin B.

He has also appeared in the 2002 sequel, 2019 spin-off, the animated series and the video game MIB: Alien Crisis. Within the films, Frank has the appearance of a normal pug dog, but he is actually an extraterrestrial in disguise (a Remoolian). Frank is played in the first two films by a trained pug named Mushu, who was previously owned by Dylan and Caius, with Tim Blaney providing his voice in the films and the video game. In the animated series, the voice is provided by Eddie Barth. Men in Black In the first film, Frank the Pug appears at a small kiosk next to an odd-looking man selling keys. His first line is spoken when J (who only knows he's here to meet an alien in disguise) says \\"Now that's the worst disguise ever\\", referring to the man. Frank replies \\"If you don't like it, you can kiss my furry little butt!\\" Agent J is shocked to discover that the alien is Frank. In the film, Frank acts as an informant for MiB, providing Agent K information on a \\"galaxy\\" referred to by the Arquillians. Frank reveals that the galaxy is on Earth and is a vast power source that has the potential to wipe out the Arquillians if their enemies, the Bugs, find it. Frank also points out that humans must learn to understand the notion of scope in the universe; i.e. a very important and grand thing can be very small. Men in Black: The Series Frank appeared in a few episodes of Men in Black: The Series with virtually the same role as the first film. The man in the kiosk is different from the one in the first movie as he is revealed to be a robot in which Frank presses a button to make him talk (\\"Make it snappy, we're closing!\\"), this may also apply to the one from the first movie since he doesn't appear to move that much. Humorously, Frank's true alien form still resembles a pug, albeit with a dark green color, antennae, and a 3-pointed tail; however, the series is usually not considered canon, due to the release of Men in Black II. Frank is often shown denouncing his suit; Frank eventually replaced it with a similar suit, with minor cosmetic differences. The series also revealed Frank was once cell mates with the mentally-unstable Drekk. Men in Black II In the second film, Frank was given a bigger role as director Barry Sonnenfeld enjoyed the dog's performance in the first film. In this film, he appears to be an employee at MIB HQ. He first appears while delivering passports to Chief Zed's office. Zed is speaking with Agent J about a killing that he wants him and Agent T (Patrick Warburton) to investigate, but Agent J informs him that he had neuralyzed Agent T. Frank then volunteers to be J's new partner. Frank, now known as \\"Agent F\\" and wearing an MIB uniform, soon becomes a nuisance to J as he doesn't feel he needs a partner and Frank never stops talking. Frank sings a few lines of \\"I Will Survive\\" by Gloria Gaynor as he rides with J to the scene of the crime (Tim Blaney as Frank sings the song, slightly altered, in its entirety on the film's soundtrack). When the two agents arrive, he notices the \\"suit\\" that the dead alien was wearing and says \\"Hey, J, zero percent body fat\\". After J has talked with the witness, he can be seen barking to the song \\"Who Let the Dogs Out?\\" before he is interrupted by J. J and Frank were later dispatched to Central Park to investigate a ship. When one of his fellow agents was laughing about Frank being J's new partner, Frank attacked the Agent (implied to be at the groin). When Agent K is taken to be deneuralyzed, Frank steps down as Agent J's partner, but becomes Chief Zed's personal assistant, partly because the job offers better dental. He communicates with J about the situation within MIB while trapped in the base but is found by Serleena who imitates his voice to try to trap J and K. In his penultimate scene in the movie, he identifies himself as a Remoolian. He at the end of the film says \\"Woah\\" after Agent K showed him and J, that Earth and the Human race are stored in a locker at an Alien Space Station modeled after Grand Central Terminal. Frank also appears in the film's promotional music video \\"Black Suits Comin' (Nod Ya Head)\\" in which he literally pulls the plug on Will Smith's performance. MIB: Alien Crisis Frank the Pug is featured as a character, and on the cover art for the video game MIB: Alien Crisis. With J and K missing, Frank is working with Agent C, who has recently moved into fieldwork from administration to prove herself, and new MiB deputy Agent P, an art thief who was recruited after he showed exceptional skill in dealing with an alien ambush to prevent Earth from being caught up in a civil war. Men in Black 3 Frank does not appear in person in the third film, but can be seen in a picture in J's room. Additionally when J is being pulled over by two police officers in 1969, Frank appears on a Coney Island billboard where he is advertised as \\"The Incredible Speaking Pug\\". Frank was excluded from the film because Mushu the dog had died. Frank the Pug is featured on the cover art for MIB: Alien Crisis as well as the main story, and appears in the Men in Black III App game as Agent F and serves as the player's partner. MIB: International Frank the Pug returns in a cameo in Men in Black: International, guarding the entrance to MIB's New York HQ. He picks out Molly Wright (Tessa Thompson), who is posing as an MIB agent, and lets her through down to headquarters before calling in the intrusion.

The Constitution of the United States specifically charges the National Guard with dual federal and state missions, which includes to provide soldiers and airmen to the United States Army and U.S. Air Force in national emergencies or when requested by the president of the United States, and to perform military operations at the state level or any other lawful service as requested by the governor of Puerto Rico. The PRNG responds to the governor of Puerto Rico, who serves as its commander in chief and imparts orders with the Puerto Rico adjutant general acting as conduit, and its local mission is to respond as requested in military or civilian tasks. Abroad, its main function is to train a reserve capable of providing additional personnel in a war scenario. Background The PRNG traces its roots back to the first Puerto Rican militias founded by Juan Ponce de Le√≥n during the 16th century and prides itself in the battles that its predecessor won against the Ta√≠no, enemy navies, pirates, privateers and buccaneers, such as Francis Drake, Cumberland and Baldiuino Henrico, centuries before from strongholds such as Castillo San Felipe del Morro. These forces which preceded by operated similarly to the Minutemen, were involved in a number of military and piratical incursions during the Spanish colonial period. Due to this, the PRNG claims to be the only member of the National Guard of the United States to be a product of two distinct lineages. The entity claims a unique tradition that unlike the rest of the state national guards, also includes the early American period that preceded the creation of the Thirteen Colonies. This claim is reflected in its first coat of arms which depicts the defeat of the British in the second Battle of San Juan and the patch worn by the 295th Regiment, designed by John Roque√±a in 1953, which features a man wearing a morion. The first coat of arms of the PRNG featured a lion guarding a tower on top of an isle located in the middle of a blue field representing the ocean, the beast representing the militia guarding San Juan, three sailboats that represent the defeated British float in 1798, and a sheep next to a red book representing Puerto Rico as seen in the coat of arms. Since its early days, the units stationed in Puerto Rico used a yellow and red patch that features a guerite, similar to those at El Morro. After the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898, Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States. US military authorities discussed Puerto Rico's military value. It offered tremendous commercial value in expanding commerce among the US, Central and South America. Because of the political changes in the beginning of the 20th century, the strategic military importance of Puerto Rico grew. In 1906, a group of Puerto Ricans met with Governor Winthrop, and the commissioner of interior, Lawrence H. Graham, to organize a National Guard of Puerto Rico. The public supported this effort and some companies were organized, in different towns around the island: Yauco under the command of Captain Santiago Vivaldi; Juana D√≠az, commanded by Captain Diaz-Brik; Pe√±uelas by Captain Gabino Balasquide; and two in Ponce by Pedro Juan Armstrong, Mario Belaval, J. Oppenheimer, F. del Valle and Doctor Laguna. In San Juan three companies were organized under Federico Vall- Spinosa, Justo Barros, J. del Barril, R. Swigett, J. Doere, Lugo Vinas and F. Fano. As the companies were being formed, all of the officers and soldiers had to purchase their own uniforms and supplies, since there was no government funding for the enterprise. This organization failed due to existing US federal law, which prohibited the formation of any armed force within the United States and its territories without authorization from Congress. During World War I, Puerto Ricans served in the 373d, 374th, and 375th Infantry Regiments of the National Army and the Puerto Rican Regiment of the Regular Army. Approximately 20,000 troops were trained at Camp Las Casas. The young Puerto Rican officer, Luis Ra√∫l Estevez, thought a Puerto Rican National Guard was needed. As the first Puerto Rican to graduate from the US Military Academy at West Point, he had learned about military units in other states. He discussed the issue with the governor of Puerto Rico, Arthur Yager, soon after the conclusion of World War I. The governor, Legislature of Puerto Rico, and US Congress approved the plan, and the National Guard was organized in 1919. In 1938, Luis R. Esteves was promoted to Major General and appointed as Adjutant General of the Puerto Rican National Guard. The first regiment of the Puerto Rico National Guard, \\"First Infantry Regiment\\", was organized on June 2, 1920 and reorganized on December 26, 1922, as the 295th Infantry Regiment. On March 1, 1936, the 296th Infantry Regiment was organized. Before, the 296th existed as a battalion of the 295th Infantry Regiment. On October 30, 1950, the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party organized a series of uprisings in numerous cities in Puerto Rico against United States rule and the Puerto Rican commonwealth government in what is known as the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s. The Puerto Rico National Guard was mobilized under the command of Puerto Rico adjutant general Luis R. Esteves by orders of Governor Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n and sent to confront the Nationalists in various towns such as Jayuya, Utuado and San Juan.El ataque Nacionalista a La Fortaleza by Pedro Aponte V√°zquez, page 7. Publisher: Publicaciones REN√â. Due to the lack of belligerent invaders, the PRNG has participated in a number of functions such as coordination during natural disasters (mainly tropical storms, hurricanes, floods and droughts) repairing roads, bridges, telecommunication arrays and aqueducts. The PRNG also hosts other disciplines, including a band and a religious services branch that includes personal if different credos. Through these, the organization also related with other government agencies and entities, occasionally organizing parades or friendly competitions or entertainment through its artistic unit, Banda 248. Otherwise, the organization makes donations to other initiatives, mainly the Red Cross and similar entities. Structure The Puerto Rico National Guard comprises both Army and Air National Guard components, namely the Puerto Rico Army National Guard and the Puerto Rico Air National Guard respectively, with a total authorized strength of 8,400 citizen-soldiers and airmen. The Constitution of the United States specifically charges the different National Guards with dual federal and state missions. The Puerto Rico National Guard is the only United States military force empowered to function in a state/territorial status within Puerto Rico. Those functions range from limited actions during non- emergency situations to full-scale law enforcement of martial law when local law enforcement officials can no longer maintain civil control. The Puerto Rico National Guard may be called into federal service in response to a call by the president of the United States or Congress, usually at the request of the governor of Puerto Rico. When under state/territory control, the governor serves as commander-in-chief. When troops from the Puerto Rico National Guard are called to federal service, the president serves as commander-in-chief. The federal mission assigned to the different National Guards is: \\"To provide properly trained and equipped units for prompt mobilization for war, national emergency or as otherwise needed.\\" The governor of Puerto Rico may call individuals or units of the Puerto Rico National Guard into state service during emergencies or to assist in special situations in which National Guard use is appropriate. The state mission assigned to the National Guard is: \\"To provide trained and disciplined forces for domestic emergencies or as otherwise provided by state law.\\" History=Spanish colonial period (1510‚Äì1898) The PRNG claims direct descent from the Puerto Rican militias that were founded after the Spanish Empire granted the island a Governor and General captain. Its first large conflict emerged from the response to the Spanish‚ÄìTa√≠no War of San Juan‚ÄìBorik√©n, only years after the arrival of Juan Ponce de Le√≥n and before the totality of Puerto Rico was under Spanish sovereignty. The Ta√≠nos of Borik√©n, led by Ag√ºeyban√° II were forced into labor and their territory threatened by the Spanish expansionism in the region, consequently deciding to begin a counteroffensive by killing Crist√≥bal de Sotomayor, the leader of a settlement built in southern Puerto Rico. Lacking a formal structure during the initial stages of the colonization, the Spanish settlers were forced to adopt a military initiative and organize these militias, while also continuing their main jobs, giving rise to the first civilian reserves. Additional native attacks took place in 1514 and 1520 (by which point they had been driven into exile in the Lesser Antilles). During this decade, French buccaneers would also become a threat, attacking the archipelago in 1528, only for more exiled Ta√≠nos to attack the following year. Hostile adversaries would make a single incursion during the following decade, one was an attack attributed to island Caribs (in 1556) and the other a French attack, the only reported during the following thirty years. However, the 1570s saw a surge in activity, with buccaneers attacking in 1570 and 1576 and the natives in 1573. Puerto Rico was considered a strong strategic point by the Spanish Empire due to its location as the last bastion before taking the transatlantic voyage to Europe, and due to this fortification of its ports began during the second half of the 16th century. The first major attack faced by the militias was led by Francis Drake in 1595, leading thousands of men in the Battle of San Juan but being repelled. In 1598, George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland managed to take the city in the second Battle of San Juan after battling his way through the local militias, but was forced to leave two months later due to an epidemic. Despite this setback, the local militias earned enough of a reputation for the next governor, Alonso de Mercado, to reportedly send back most of the soldiers that accompanied him in his voyage and rely on them for defensive purposes. The main fortress of San Juan Bay, El Morro, was finished by 1608 and additional fortifications such as San Crist√≥bal soon followed. The next major engagement took part 27 years later, when Nerherlands lead another failed invasion in the third Battle of San Juan. The militias would also participate in military incursions in other adjacent islands, including some that are now part of the Puerto Rican archipelago. In 1765, Marshall Alejandro O'Reilly who would later become known as \\"El Padre de las Milicias\\", reorganized the militias and created a group that was disciplined enough to fight in regular combat at the Anglo-Spanish War and be commended by the crown. In 1797, the British attempted another invasion, this time led by Ralph Abercrombie, but were defeated by a force that heavily depended on the local militias in the fourth Battle of San Juan. In 1868, amidst a growing pro-independence in the population that eventually lead to the Grito de Lares, the Spanish government decided to replace the mostly Puerto Rican quorum of the militias with an Institute of Volunteers that was completely composed of Spanish-born citizens. During the decades that followed, the loss of several former colonies and of influence in the continent affected the maintenance of the local military installations and of the force, leading to an ill-prepared force with which to face the Hispano- American War. Early American colonial period (1898‚Äì1938) In 1906, a group of men led by Commissioner of Interior Lawrence H. Grahame decided that there was a need to create a national guard that mirrored those in the states in order to replace the militias. Companies were created in Yauco, Juana D√≠az, Pe√±uelas, Ponce and San Juan. This entity was initially dependent on volunteers that were trained in El Morro, none of which received a salary. However, the colonial legislature failed to approve a project that was meant to authorize the organization and seek funding, causing the initiative to be halted. Cadet Luis R. Esteves, 1915 With the onset of World War I and the mobilization of the 373th, 374th and 375th regiments of the Regular Army, the need for a local military force became evident as some 20,000 men were trained in Camp Las Casas. As soon as the war concluded, a local officer, Luis Ra√∫l Estevez, inquired colonial governor Arthur Yager about reactivating the national guard, an initiative that gained the support of the official and the colonial legislature. On July 19, 1919, Congress passed a law approving the budget for the following year to meet the requirements of the National Defense Act of 1916. Adjutant General John Wilson was given command over the nascent organization. On July 19, 1919, the United States Department of War informed Yager about the administration's intention of supporting a local reserve pursuant to the statutes of this law to create a permanent national guard that was capable of assisting the other branches of the military or working independently. The entity resumed operation and was meant to receive an infantry brigade, with artillery, cavalry, engineering and specialized troops. Esteves became the first commander of the current interaction of the PRNG. Company A was organized under Cpt. Luis Irizarry on November 23, 1919. The unit was trained in terrains and buildings that were lent by Carmelo Alemar of the Agricultural Experimental Station. Company B was organized on February 1, 1920, and was separated a week later in two companies stationed in San Sebasti√°n (Company M) and Lares (Company L) which were later formally organized. On February 7, 1920, several new companies were organized, including Company E in Ponce, Company G in Yauco. On February 25, 1920, the First Regiment Puerto Rico Infantry was provisionally organized under Mayor Luis Esteves, receiving Companies A, B, M, L, E, G and Headquarters. Company F was organized on March 7, 1920, in Pe√±uelas. The following week, Company I was organized at Arecibo. On April 13, 1920, Company C was organized in Cabo Rojo. On April 25, 1920, Company H was organized at Sabana Grande. On April 30, 1920, the First Regiment received command of a number of headquarters at San Juan, Mayag√ºez and Sabana Grande. On May 9, 1920, Company D was organized at San Germ√°n. Towards the month's end, Company K was organized at Bayam√≥n. On May 30, 1920, the designation of Company B was reassigned to a company in Maricao. That same day, Troop A of the First Squadron P.R. Cavalry was organized in Mayag√ºez. The First Infantry Regiment was formally recognized on June 2, 1920, before becoming the 295th Infantry Regiment two years later. With Esteves as its senior instructor, The regiment is symbolically considered the older within the structure of the US national guards due to its claim. On June 14, 1920, the First Infantry Medical Detachment was organized in Mayag√ºez. On June 17, 1923, the 296th was separated as a splinter, with its first Battalion winning recognition for best company in the national guard twice. The First Regiment's First Headquarters Company was organized in Bayam√≥n three days later. Later that week, the first PRNG band was organized at Mayag√ºez. The First Regiment's Machine Gun Company was organized at San Juan on September 19, 1920. More than two months later, its Supply Company was organized at San Juan. The first annual exercises began on December 6, 1920, at Salinas, during the following years this camp would be moved throughout the camps. In the 1920s, several groups dedicated to target shooting were scattered throughout Puerto Rico, with the PRNG deciding to organize competitions. On November 24, 1930, personnel from the entity founded the Ponce Rifle and Sporting Club, later affiliating itself with the National Rifle Association. The PRNG itself would promote these events, forming the Puerto Rico National Guard Shooting Club presided by Salvador Roig. The national guard was mobilized after the passing of hurricane San Felipe in 1928 and San Cipri√°n in 1932. During these disasters, they were assigned civil assistance. Similar interventions took place in the Dominican Republic and Haiti. In 1933, the 296th First Battalion won the Harrison Cup. On May 3, colonial governor Winship argued for a light artillery unit. On March 16, 1936, the PRNG underwent a reorganization. In February 1934, Gen. George Leach, who oversaw Company A of the 295th, visited Puerto Rico and was surprised to see that the bayonets had been repaired motu proprio with local resources and their discipline, promoting him to pronounce during a speech that he had \\"inspected the national guards of the 48 states\\" and not seen one better prepared than the PRNG, going to the extent that if the president asked which was the best regiment for defense, it would be the 295th. The 296th remained under the supervision of the 295th until June 1, 1936, when it was designated as a regiment under Col. Luis Irizarry. In 1937, the 296th first Battalion was reassigned to the 295th as Company A. In 1938, the PRNG joined the 65th Infantry Regiment and participated in exercises supervised by Gen. Frank Ross McKoy. On July 25, 1938, Irizarry was killed during an assassination attempt against colonial governor Winship in one of several confrontations between the government and the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party following the events of the Ponce massacre. Col. Jos√© Enrique Colom took over the 296th Regiment. In 1938, the 295th, 65th and 296th Regiments and other personnel from the PRNG joined the Regular Army in a number of military exercises also involving the Navy. The three regiments formed a brigade that was led by brigadier general Walter Short and was given jurisdiction over Puerto Rico in case of military action. The following two years, annual training was held in Arecibo and Tortuguero in anticipation to the impending activation in the newly declared World War II. Wilson died in December 1938, and months later Luis Ra√∫l Esteves was given command of the PRNG. On August 3, 1939, the national guard paid homage to the colonel of the 296th, Jos√© Colom, who was serving as interim governor of Puerto Rico, with a mass march (the first of this kind held under the colonial administration) to commemorate Governor's Day. In turn, Colom handed several recognitions to the companies and soldiers that distinguished themselves during the year. On January 8, 1940, an emergency camp was held and a training exercise where an invasion of the northern coast of Puerto Rico was being invaded, in particular the municipalities of Arecibo and Vega Baja, and the 295th and 296th were tasked with repelling it. Both were placed in charge of solving a tactical exercise, code named MUSKETRY, which involved a sudden appearance by a hostile force. In March 1940, a new military code for Puerto Rico was presented to the colonial legislature along other initiatives related to the PRNG. The final annual camp prior to activation in World War II was the longest yet, lasting three weeks. On May 19, 1940, the PRNG was mobilized to attend the flooding caused by Rivera Portugu√©s and Bucan√° in Ponce. During this time, the PRNG underwent a reorganization that led to the transfer of guardsmen and units, as well as the creation of new units. In June 1940, the 162nd Battalion of Field Artillery was first organized, with its batteries (A through C) being assigned to San Juan, R√≠o Piedras and Ponce. This same year, the 130th Engineering Regiment received authorization to organize its 1st Battalion, with its companies being assigned to San Juan, Mayag√ºez and Guayama. The 295th's Company A was reassigned as the 296th's Company K. This reorganization led to the ascension of several officers to accommodate the new units. World War II and reorganization (1938‚Äì1950) On October 15, 1940, the PRNG was activated pursuant to Executive Order 3551. A group of 1,359 belonging to 295th Infantry Regiment were assigned to Campamento Tortuguero in Vega Alta, Puerto Rico where training was under seen by Esteves under Col. Miguel A. Mu√±oz. The 296th had a force of 1,363 and joined the 295th at Tortuguero. The other units, which included those that received formal recognition on this date, were the 92nd Brigade (47 men), the 162nd Artillery Battalion (274 men), the 130th Engineering Battalion (193 men), the 253rd Artillery Battalion (175 men) and the 201st/123rd Artillery Battalion (323 men). Besides San Juan, the municipalities of Ponce, Mayag√ºez, Vega Baja, Manat√≠, Arecibo, Bayam√≥n, Caguas, Fajardo, Humacao, Cayey, San Germ√°n, Maricao, Cabo Rojo, Sabana Grande, Pe√±uelas, Yauco, Aibonito, Coamo, Juana D√≠az, R√≠o Piedras, Guayama and Aguadilla had personnel assigned to them. The 130th Regiment was placed under the Regular Army and trained by the 27th Combat Engineering Regiment at Tortuguero, where its Company A was charged with additional constructions. On March 19, 1941, additional personnel was assigned to the 295th Regiment, and shortly afterwards it was moved to Salinas, Puerto Rico, for further training. On August 12, 1941, Colom left the 296th Regiment and was replaced by Col. Antulio Segarra. The 130th and 27th Engineering were reorganized in a Combat Engineering Regiment in charge of Lt. Col. Sylvester Nordner and continued working on the infrastructure of the local bases. Engineers of the 60th Infantry Regiment in Korea On December 7, 1941, the PRNG was assigned to surveillance and monitoring operations throughout Puerto Rico. After more than a year performing this task, the 295th Infantry Regiment was separated in two battalions and reassigned to operate in Aruba and Curazao, while the rest of the personnel was placed on detachments and sent in operations that took place in Surinam, Trinidad, Jamaica and Cuba. On January 7, 1943, the 65th Infantry Regiment was assigned to Panama led by Commander Salvador Roig, with 300 men being transferred from the 296th to complement its force. The remainder of that regiment remained at Camp O'Reilly in Gurabo. On October 30, 1943, Col. Eduardo Andini took over the 296th Regiment. In December 1943 the 295th Infantry Regiment was reorganized in Puerto Rico and the following month began replacement operations in Campanento Tortuguero. That same month, Col. Andr√©s L√≥pez Antongiorgi took over the 296th Regiment and its battalions were systematically transported to Panama where it took over the work previously done by the 65th, which was reassigned to North Africa. The regiment also provided 400 men and a Cannon Company to the parting unit. The 266th Regiment was given the task of guarding the Panama Canal Zone, both in the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and participated in missions in Peru, Galapagos and Ecuador under Col. Francisco Parra Toro. It served in the Mobile Forces, in jungle training and performed before visiting Latin American officials. Three months later, the 295th Regiment began training at Camp O'Reilly and was later translated to Losey Field. On May 13, 1943, the 162nd Battalion traveled to Panama, where it replaced the 2nd Field Artillery Battalion and was assigned the medical detachment two months later. During the summer, the 295th was assigned to Panama, where replaced the 296th Regiment in the Mobile Force and surveillance operations under Col. Ram√≥n Nadal. There the battalions underwent jungle setting training along Latin American personnel and participated in monitoring of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The 130th was re designated 130 Engineer Battalion Combat and placed under Lt. Col. Walter Torres. In June 1943, a large portion of the 130th Puerto Rican officers were sent to Fort Belvoir for training. Later in the year, the 130th was reassigned to Panama and given the task of building a landing strip in the jungle and a bridge between Pi√±a Island and the Panamanian mainland, for which it was commended. On June 27, 1944, the 162nd Battalion returned to the United States and was assigned to Camp Burtner and later to Hampton Road and Fort Jackson. The 296th was reassigned to serve in the Pacific, and on November 11, 1944, Col. Ram√≥n Nadal took over it. In January 1945, Col. Amaury Gand√≠a took over and lead the 295th Regiment until it was demobilized and returned to Puerto Rico. In Hawaii and accompanied by the 1558th Engineering and the 1114th Artillery, the unit took charge of training at camps Aiea and Kahuco, where the first, second and third battalions were assigned to different locations. The 296th Regiment was trained in anticipation for an impending invasion of Japan, but was later reassigned to work as occupation troops. On April 19, 1945, the 162nd Battalion arrived at France, where it participated in operations held along the Seventh Army, the Sixth Group, 63rd Infantry, VI Army Corps, 84th Army Division and the Third Army. On October it was returned to Puerto Rico, where it remained until its demobilization seven month later. The 130th was sent to Camp Bowie, where they would complete further training an await further mobilization, but the war would end before. In March 1946, they were returned to Puerto Rico, where it was demobilized shortly after arrival. On May 6, 1946, the 162nd was demobilized and reorganized under Lt. Col. Jaime Fullana, with its batteries being granted recognition between 1947 and 1948. The conclusion of the war lead to the license and honorable discharge of several members of the PRNG, who wanted to continue their civilian lives. during the summer of 1946, Esteves reorganized the 295th and 296th Infantry Regiments. The Department of War issued a plan where the PRNG would be reorganized into headquarters, two units 295th and 296th, an anti-air group, and numerous battalions, detachments, companies and other specialty groups at a cost of 2.5 million per year. Secretary Patterson, who was once a member of his local national guard, felt an urgency to reorganize the civil guard as soon as possible. In the recruitment initiative that followed, the PRNG would finish second among the 51 national guards affiliated to the USNG, only behind Wyoming, surpassing pre-established goals for a 204% of the total. The most successful recruiter, Arturo Roma√±at, received a commendation and traveled to Washington where he met several high-ranking officials. The 296th was placed in charge of Col. Juan Cordero. Company Headquarters for the first and second natal lions were located in Mayag√ºez and Ponce, with Lieutenant Colonels Rafael Sep√∫lveda, Manuel Nazario and Invan Dom√≠nguez. The 296th's Company A (based in San Germ√°n) became the first unit to complete quorum among all national guards affiliated to the United States following the war, and won the Eisenhower Trophy in consecutive years. Between October and December 1946, other companies were scattered throughout Puerto Rico. On September 15, 1946, the 295th Infantry Regiment was taken over by Col. Wilson Colberg. This coincided with the establishment of Company Headquarters led by Cpt. Ram√≥n Cantero. The 295th held its first Annual Training under this new regime in August. On November 3, 1946, the first set of commissions were awarded to the new PRNG. Black men were not allowed to enlist in the PRNG until December 3, 1946, when colonial governor Jes√∫s T. Pi√±ero authorized it. On February 9, 1947, the 482nd Artillery Battalion was organized under Lt. Col. Jacinto Hidalgo, its batteries were organized in San Juan and Cayey throughout the year and one in 1948. Along the 225th Engineering Battalion, reorganized on January 22, 1948, the 296th was fully reorganized. In May 1947, Esteves re- designated several companies of the 295th and 296th in order to facilitate their training with tanks and mortars. In the summer of 1947, the 296th traveled to Tortuguero to attend its first training camp after reorganizing. The following year, it held its first training at full force. The 296th Regiment received Class A recognition, earning priority status in order of activation. On June 15, 1947, Company K of the 295th was reorganized at Ceiba under Lt. Alejo Rivera, moving from its previous base in Fajardo. On August 11, 1947, a parade led by the 295th was held in honor of Col. Miguel Mu√±oz. During the following years, the national guard was involved in training, with Company I of the 296th hosting visiting officers. On September 16, 1948, colonial governor Pi√±ero and president Trumsn proclaimed the celebration of National Guard Day. During this year, seven su officials were commended by Gen. Ray Porter for their performance at Panama. Korean War, Jayuya Uprising (1950‚Äì1953) Shortly after war was declared in Korea, the 65th regiment was activated, with the 296th Regiment taking its place at Puerto Rico on August 11, 1950. Led by Col. C√©sar Cordero, who was given control of Camp Tortuguero, the regiment was assigned for training in anticipation for future deployment and waiting for orders from the General Headquarters of the Antilles Department. During the following months, its battalions were scattered throughout Puerto Rico. On September 8, 1950, the municipality of Sabana Grande held an activity in homage of the PRNG. Troops of the Puerto Rico National Guard, commanded by Puerto Rico Adjutant General Major General Luis R. Esteves and under the orders of Governor Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, during the occupation of Jayuya During the following years, the dichotomy between the government of Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n and the Nationalist Party was widened over the Commonwealth that was being negotiated in Congress. On October 30, 1950, these differences materialized in the Jayuya Uprising. The 295th Infantry Regiment was mobilized from the beginning of the insurrection until November 6, 1950. In the crossfire that took place at Utuado, Corporal Jos√© Rodr√≠guez Alicea of H Unit in Arecibo was killed. The 296th's First Battalion was mobilized under Lt. Col. Rafael Sep√∫lveda, was moved to forts Brooke and Buchanan. This revolution was quelled after the Puerto Rico Air National Guard bombed the municipalities of Jayuya and Utuado, the first and so far only time that the United States military has bombed a locale under the jurisdiction of the federal government. Following the crossfire, the PRNG confiscated a flag of Puerto Rico that had been placed before the Jayuya Police Headquarters. For its participation in this conflict, the entity received letters of gratification from the Police of Puerto Rico and other organizations affiliated to the government such as the Puerto Rico Water Resources Authority. In turn, Esteves commended a number of officers for their coordination. On January 22, 1951, the 296th Regiment was moved to Camp Losey under Col. Cordero. On February 1, 1951, the 296th was formally reorganized. Its units systematically operated at Salinas and training continued in expectation. During this time, the 296th replaced personnel for the 65th Regiment. Chief of Staff J. Lawton Collins visited Puerto Rico and translated Col. Cordero to the 65th, replacing him with Lt. Col. Sep√∫lveda. Company D of Yauco was the first to complete its quorum, being recognized by the Army on February 15, 1953. On September 14, 1952, the 296th's Headquarters Company was organized. In 1953, the 296th Annual Training was heavily affected by the moves to service. The PRNG also promoted assistance by awarding a golden cup to units with perfect assistance. Battery B of the 482nd was returned to the jurisdiction of Puerto Rico and received a recognition by the Army. Cold War and governor assignments (1954‚Äì1991) Brigadier Gen. Kenneth Sweany attended the summer training in July 1954, expressing satisfaction following the Governor's Day parade that culminated it. On November 19, 1954, the Regular Army formally returned the designation of 296th Regiment to the PRNG in an activity hosted by Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, this under new administrative personnel due to several former members remaining in active service. Detachments were then assigned to several municipalities. The Regiment was able to gather enough troops, but the officers were scarce due to active service and the Inactive Reserve. Other moves included the adoption of a fighting cock as new insignia and the establishment of a periodical. The efficiency of the personnel was gauged in shooting competitions, with the results being sent back to the USNG for comparison with other national guards. In 1955, a Commission of the House of Representatives supervised the PRNG's exercises to gauge the entity's efficiency. During the passing of Hurricane Santa Clara, the 296th's Company I provided support to the government. The 296th's Engineering Company 225 was tasked with the construction of a bridge. The PRNG underwent another reorganization on February 15, 1959. The tank companies of the 295th and 296th Regiments were assigned to the first battalion in Ponce. Several pre-existing companies were reassigned into the creation of the new Group 65. Several other companies were reassigned new names and purpose, including the 162nd, 482nd and 123th Battalions. On February 15, 1959, the 296th was assigned to Mayag√ºez under Col. Ra√∫l Mercado. This same date the 92nd Brigade was returned to the PRNG, after having been formed from the 295th and the 296th in 1940 and reassigned to the Puerto Rico Military Department the following years. The 295th and 296th Regiments, 192nd Battalion, 162nd Second Support Battalion, 892nd Engineering Company, Rangers E Company and Troop E of the signaling platoon were placed under it. In 1955, the 296th's Company G won the local National Guard Trophy and the Pershing Trophy, besting other national guards in the Third Area of the South. On April 30, 1957, Esteves retired from service due to health concerns. Gen. Juan Cordero took office on October 1, 1958, and was ascended to the rank of Brigadier General. On February 21, 1960, commemorated as National Guard Day, the 65th Infantry Regiment was transferred from the Regular Army to the PRNG, in an activity where Gen. Ces√°r Cordero handed the units colors to Col. Rafael Rodr√≠guez. During this time, governor Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n took over the office of adjutant general. On September 5, 1960, the PRNG was activated to attend a series of building and bridge collapses caused by floods brought by the adjacent passing of Hurricane Donna, which lead to the deaths of 149 civilians. In December 1961, the PRNG was involved in the reception of John F. Kennedy during his visit to Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico National Guardsmen in 2012 The Military Academy of the Puerto Rico National Guard was established on June 1, 1963, at Camp Tortuguero on an initiative of C√©sar Cordero. Its curriculum was equivalent to Fort Benning's and lasted for a year and 15 days, at which point graduates received their certification. The institution was subsequently translated to the Henry Barracks in Cayey and from there to Campamento Santiago. On May 1, 1964, the PRNG underwent another reorganization, the second under Gen. Cordero. On March 20, 1966, Salvador Roig was placed in charge of the PRNG by Roberto S√°nchez Vilella. The PRNG also engaged in other civil activities, such as cooperativism (several becoming involved with Cooperativa El Sentinela) and inter-agency softball tournaments. In 1968 and 1969, Gen. Alberto Pic√≥ created the Civic Medical Service Program led by Support Battalion 192's Company B and the 201 Surgery Hospital of the Mobile Army, first offering service to the communities of Salinas. The initiative then moved to the municipality of Culebra. Other municipalities treated during this time include Aibonito, Coamo, Orovovis, Vega Baja, Gu√°nica, Ponce, San Juan, as part of yearly trainings, requests or emergent circumstances. Similar operations held at Utuado in 1974, lead to a recognition by the House of Representatives. On January 10, 1969, Pic√≥ was promoted to Adjutant General. The Civic Action and Rehabilitation from Disaster and Rescue Program was established parallel to this, with the expressed intention of aiding civic organizations in non intrusive ways following natural disasters. Under this initiative, the 892nd Company and personnel from the 130th of Engineering was engaged in protects such as reconstructing damaged roads, removal of debris and replaced bridges. They also attended some civic and government requests, particularly during training exercises. The PRNG was also involved in the activities of a Constitution Day on July 25. Other activities included raising funds for civic organizations, specific constructions, disposing of garbage, building restorations and cooperating with the Boy Scouts of America. On October 9, 1970, the PRNG was activated to attend a series of floods, mobilizing 265 men which remained in service for a period of ten days. The entity's role in this event was mostly focused on the evacuation of victims and proving supplies in cooperation with other government agencies. For these efforts, a number of government functionaries sent letters to Gen. Pic√≥, in which they thanked the services provided. On February 1, 1973, Chard√≥n was named Adjutant General and ascended to the rank of Brigadier General. On July 6, 1973, Rafael Hern√°ndez Col√≥n activated the PRNG in response to a strike being declared in the Autoridad de Fuentes Fluviales. The 92nd Brigade and other units were in service for a week under Brigadier General Salvador Padilla. On November 28, 1974, Hern√°ndez Col√≥n activated the national guard again, this time in response to a strike being declared in the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority. This time, the PRNG remained in service for two weeks. On September 6, 1975, Salvador Padilla was named Adjutant General of the PRNG. The following month, Tropica Storm Eloise passed near the North Coast of Puerto Rico, with a large number of guardsmen voluntarily joining the Civil Defense in the evacuation, clearing of debris, transportation and the management of Assistance Centers that followed. On January 2, 1977, Orlando Llenza was promoted to Brigadier General and named Adjutant General of Puerto Rico. During this decade, the PRNG also transitioned to the Joint Uniform Military Pay System (JUMPS). On May 1, 1983, Gonz√°lez was named General Adjutant of Puerto Rico.

Military installations * Camp Santiago Joint Maneuver Training Center on 16,000 acres of land located in Salinas, Puerto Rico is the island's premier National Guard training facility. Though it has no permanent residents, Camp Santiago can house thousands of troops on a temporary basis. Some old barracks are being replaced with new two-level barracks. In addition to rifle and small arm ranges, a leadership reaction course, and dining facilities and classrooms, Camp Santiago houses a Puerto Rico National Guard Museum, a theater, a Class Six Shoppette and, since 2009, a post exchange on base. A $1.7 million Urban Assault Course is to be constructed at Camp Santiago. National Guard units from other states also come to Camp Santiago for their two weeks annual training. In 1975 the facility was renamed from Camp Salinas to Camp Santiago in honor of Specialist Four H√©ctor Santiago- Col√≥n, who received the Medal of Honor during the Vietnam War. Salinas was Santiago's birthplace. * Fort Allen, located south of Juana D√≠az, is the site of the Puerto Rico National Guard Language Center. Many PRNG and U.S. Army Reserve units are stationed at Fort Allen. The National Guard's Youth Challenge Program operates at Fort Allen, graduating hundreds of high school students each year who had formerly dropped out of school. The Relocatable Over the Horizon (ROTHR) receiver site has operated at Fort Allen since the 1990s; it is part of a surveillance network designed to monitor flights over an area encompassing more than in South America. The (ROTHR) radar consists of 34 antennas and support structure from 71 to tall. Barracks can house military personnel on a temporary basis, NGX has a post exchange on base, and an Armed Forces Reserve Center is under construction. Previously Fort Allen was used by the US Army as the Losey Army Airfield during WWII, and later used as a U.S. Navy communications center. Since 1980, Fort Allen has been under control of the Puerto Rico National Guard. * Mu√±iz Air National Guard Base in Carolina is the home of the Puerto Rico Air National Guard 156th Airlift Wing and the 198th Airlift Squadron. Also, at Mu√±iz ANGB are located the headquarters of the 1st Air Base Group, the air support division of the Puerto Rico State Guard. Mu√±iz ANGB has hangars, command offices, a recruiting office, classrooms, maintenance shops, a community club, a Family Readiness Center, a post barbershop, and NGX has a post exchange on base. Mu√±iz ANGB is also the home of the STARBASE youth program in Puerto Rico. Operation Coronet Oak shares Mu√±iz ANGB flight line with the 156th Airlift Wing, which also flies C-130 military transport airplanes. In 1963 this Air base was renamed Mu√±iz Air National Guard Base while commemorating the 20th year of its federal recognition. * Punta Borinquen Radar Station located next to Punta Borinquen Golf Course at the former Ramey Air Force Base is home for the Puerto Rico Air National Guard's 141st Air Control Squadron. * Punta Salinas Radar Site Punta Salinas Radar Site in Toa Baja is operated by the Puerto Rico Air National Guard's 140th Air Defense Support Squadron. Its mission is to provide air traffic control to the Federal Aviation Administration, and provide support for military and law enforcement operations. * Isla Grande Aviation Support Facility is located at the Fernando Luis Ribas Dominicci Airport in San Juan. Its mission is to support the Puerto Rico Army National Guard aviation units. * Watercraft Support Maintenance Center at the former Naval Station Roosevelt Roads in Ceiba, Puerto Rico is home for the Puerto Rico Army National Guard Landing Craft Detachment, 191st Regional Support Group. * Puerto Rico Army National Guard armories are located in Aibonito, Aguadilla, Arecibo, Arroyo, Cabo Rojo, Caguas, Cayey, Ceiba, Coamo, Guayama, Gurabo, Humacao, Juncos, Mayaguez, Pe√±uelas, Ponce, Sabana Grande, San German, Utuado, Vega Baja and San Juan. Some of these armories might close and units will move into new Armed Forces Reserve Centers in Ceiba, Mayaguez, Fort Allen and to a new Puerto Rico National Guard Readiness Center in Fort Buchanan. Community outreach programs * Drug Demand Reduction Program :The National Guard uses its resources to help the island's youth to be drug-free. The Drug Demand Reduction Program works closely with local law enforcement, education and community-based organizations to reduce the chances of exposure of illegal drugs to American children. They also provide National Guard-led education- based, leadership and motivational programs. Drug Demand Reduction directly interacts with children through their KEY National Initiative, Drug Free Starts with Me. The program visits local schools and communities around the island to increase awareness and motivation, and provide leadership, guidance and support to adolescents about their choice to remain drug-free. * Youth Challenge Program :This program intervenes with 16- to 18-year-old high school dropouts to help them reclaim their lives; it helps them graduate with the values, life skills, education, and self-discipline necessary to succeed as productive citizens. Founded in the 1990s during the administration of Governor Pedro Rossell√≥, the program has had thousands of dropouts participate and graduate. * STARBASE Youth Program :As an acronym of Science and Technology Academies Reinforcing Basic Aviation and Space Education, this youth program is intended to help students from 4th‚Äì12th grade to improve their math and science skills through aviation. The program starts in elementary school to attract and prepare students at an early age for careers in engineering and other science-related fields of study. The program principally exposes at-risk children and their teachers to real-world applications of math and science; it includes experiential learning, simulations, and experiments in aviation and space-related fields. The program also addresses drug use prevention, health, self esteem and life skills within a math-and science-based program. Founded in 1995 by SSgt Elaine Montgomery, the program celebrates its 15th anniversary in May, 2010.

Headed by Ralph K. Farris and Gordon Kelly McLean, the company sought the contract for the Northern Ontario leg of the TransCanada pipeline, and tried to secure franchise supply contracts to the region's major cities. In particular, winning a contract to supply Inco's operations in Sudbury was considered a crucial component of the company's business strategy, as Inco was at the time the world's largest consumer of natural gas. The company offered Landreville, then Sudbury's mayor, an option on 10,000 shares of company stock at $2.50 a share before the city approved NONG's franchise contract. After the deal was approved and NONG's stock rose to $13, Farris purchased 10,000 shares at the $2.50 price, sold 2,500 shares at the new price to reimburse the company, and gave the remaining 7,500 shares to Landreville at no cost to him. Landreville later sold the stock for $117,000 in profit. The scandal was pursued in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario by Cooperative Commonwealth Federation leader Donald C. MacDonald, leading to the resignations of Philip Kelly, William Griesinger and Clare Mapledoram from Frost's cabinet after their own involvement in the scandal was also revealed. Although Landreville was acquitted on charges of influence peddling resulting from his involvement in the scandal, he was subsequently induced to resign from the Supreme Court of Ontario bench on the grounds that his conduct had fallen beneath the standards of probity expected of a judge.

History Saint Hermagoras parish church Archaeological finds have shown that the historic iron ore mining area was already settled around 1800-1200 BC. It later was part of the Celtic kingdom of Noricum, which was incorporated into the Roman Empire in 15 BC. The parish of Saint Hermagoras in the Duchy of Carinthia was first mentioned in an 1169 document, probably a foundation of the Patriarchs of Aquileia. Due to its strategic location, it quickly prospered, obtained market rights in 1288, and became the main settlement of the Gail valley. In 1779 the botanist Franz Xaver von Wulfen discovered Wulfenia carinthiaca on the slopes of the Gartnerkofel peak. Hermagor became capital of the eponymous district in 1868 and was home of an Imperial-Royal Landwehr garrison. The Gailtal Railway line was built from 1894, it was extended in 1915 for military purposes on the Italian Front of World War I. Hermagor obtained town privileges on 10 October 1930, on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the Carinthian plebiscite. The present-day municipality of Hermagor-Pressegger See was established by a merger of several formerly independent communes in the course of a 1973 administrative reform. PopulationPoints of interest * M√∂derndorf Castle, including the Gail Valley Museum Economy The economy of Hermagor today largely depends on tourism, especially skiing around Na√üfeld Pass, the largest ski area in Carinthia. Pressegger See and the surrounding mountains are also a traditional summer retreat and a popular destination for hikers.

The motion picture is a collection of ten, ten-minute shorts, by ten Argentine directors. The film focuses on the July 18, 1994, bombing of the AMIA Building in Buenos Aires, where 86 people were killed and 300 others wounded. The perpetrators were never caught. AMIA is the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association, a charity, and the attack is considered the largest single incident of terrorism against Jews since World War II. The film is a tribute to the memory of the victims from the Argentine cinema community, producers, and directors, and released on the ten-year anniversary of the attack. Each director portrays his or her memory and impressions of the event in their own way. The ten short films are shown in a sequence. The picture was co-produced by the INCAA (Instituto Nacional de Cine y Artes Audiovisuales) and ten of the most active Argentine producers. The film opens with a brief introduction by Argentine actor Norma Aleandro. Background Because the picture involved numerous explosions it was shot on an Argentine Army base. The short films capture Argentine life at several social levels, both Jewish and non-Jewish. The ten directors use a variety of cinematic styles: the sentimental, hard-hitting, and the abstract. Distribution The film opened in Argentina on August 19, 2004. In Brazil it opened October 4, 2004, at the Rio de Janeiro International Film Festival. The film has been screened at various film festivals, including: the Palm Beach Jewish Film Festival, Palm Beach, Florida; the Washington Jewish Film Festival, Washington, D.C.; the Haifa International Film Festival, Haifa, Israel; the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival, San Francisco; the Hong Kong Jewish Film Festival, Hong Kong; the Boston Jewish Film Festival, Boston; and others.

Following his graduation, he became a school instructor (chiefly of mathematics and physics) in Vienna, Graz, Neusohl, Gorz, Laibach (Ljubljana), and from 1764 Klagenfurt. After the Suppression of the Society of Jesus in the 1760s, he remained in Klagenfurt until his death. By 1763, he was officially a priest.ADB: Wulfen, Franz Xaver Freiherr von @ Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie Wulfen died at the age of 76 years. Work From his twenty-second year he devoted himself to botany. The upland and valley flora of the Eastern Alps was his chief study. To find specimens, Wulfen frequently hiked up the Gro√üglockner and was a pioneer in exploring the Austrian Alps. In 1781, he published his studies in the well- illustrated Plantae rariorum Carinthicae (Rare Plants of Carinthia). With particular success, he conducted research of lichens that he still regarded as a division of algae.Wulfen, Franz Xaver Freiherr von @ Austria Forum He made numerous trips to the south (on many occasions to the Adriatic Sea) and to the north as far as Holland. Wulfen was also a researcher of the fauna of the Inner Austria and the Adriatic Sea. He concerned himself primarily with insects, fish, and birds. Recognitions and commemoration In 1796, Wulfen was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The genus Wulfenia was named in 1782 in his honor by Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin.BHL Taxonomic literature : a selective guide to botanical publications Also, he is commemorated by plants with the specific epithet of wulfenii. A monument in Klagenfurt, erected in 1838, honors him, describing him as \\"equally great as priest, scholar and man\\". Works * Plantae rariores carinthiacae.

Guinean Minister seeks acceleration of Niger Basin Authority programme, PanAfrican Press, 06/11/2008. Purpose The Niger Basin Authority defines its purpose as the promotion of cooperation among member countries to ensure integrated development of resources. The organisation originally defined its mission as the cooperative management of water resources, most notably, but not limited to, the Niger River. While centering of water and hydroelectric resources, the NBA nations use the organisation to harmonise development of energy, agriculture, forestry, transport, communications, and industrial resources of the member nations. The NBA has worked to create a \\"Integrated Development Plan of the Basin\\", especially focusing on cross boundary projects. The NBA itself has been ceded no sovereign power over resources or management, and therefore all regulation must be imposed by individual sovereign governments. While not the original focus of the NBA, environmental protection from the threats of desertification, deforestation and pollution of the rivers by agriculture and industry have become a major theme of their work.R.

Plot summary The Great Llewes (as he is invariably known) is an organic chemist who runs the successful firm of Central Organic Laboratories with an iron fist and a tendency to take credit for his employees' work. The employees at Central Organic spend a lot of time fantasizing about killing Llewes, but one of them finally decides to do it. Edmund Farley has just spent half a year setting up an industrial-scale chemical plant in the hydrogen/methane atmosphere of Titan, and now Llewes is taking the credit for that as well. On Space Day, the anniversary of the first successful space flight, Farley sneaks into Llewes' atmosphere room and coats the inside of the nozzle of a compressed-gas cylinder with platinum black (finely powdered platinum). Only after he finishes does he realize that he chose the wrong cylinder. Fortunately (for him) he has enough powdered platinum left to booby- trap the correct cylinder. The next morning, Llewes is fatally injured in an explosion. As Farley's co-worker Jim Gorham inspects the wreckage of the atmosphere room with H. Seton Davenport of the Terrestrial Bureau of Investigation, he is convinced that the explosion could not have been an accident; Llewes was too safety-conscious for that. Davenport notices that the cylinder of compressed hydrogen is lying on the floor empty, and he asks Gorham whether there is a way to cause hydrogen to explode. Gorham tells him there are several catalysts that could cause hydrogen to react explosively with atmospheric oxygen, with platinum black at the top of the list. Gorham analyses the residue on the lip of the cylinder's nozzle and finds traces of platinum, but not enough to be certain. Davenport then has the rest of the cylinders inspected and finds powdered platinum in the nozzle of the oxygen cylinder. Gorham is puzzled by this; the murderer would not have put it in the oxygen cylinder on purpose, but he can't imagine why he would have done so accidentally, unless... Gorham realizes then that Farley must be the murderer. Six months working in Titan's hydrogen/methane atmosphere had accustomed Farley to using jets of oxygen to create combustion. He had booby-trapped the oxygen cylinder from force of recent habit, then realized his mistake and also booby-trapped the hydrogen cylinder. Davenport is convinced, and orders Farley's arrest. Story notes The author originally intended for \\"The Dust of Death\\" to be a fourth Wendell Urth story, but since it was due to appear in the premier issue of Venture and the Wendell Urth stories had all appeared in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, he decided to remove Urth. The story does feature agent H. Seton Davenport, who appeared in the first two Urth stories. When Asimov prepared the story for inclusion in Asimov's Mysteries, he considered restoring Urth, but, as he put it, \\"inertia rose triumphant over all\\". In line with accepted astronomical knowledge when the story was written, Asimov describes Titan as having an atmosphere composed of hydrogen and methane. Subsequent observations by the Voyager and Cassini spacecraft have since established that the majority of Titan's atmosphere is actually nitrogen.http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?Target=Jupiter&MCode;=Voyager_1&Display;=ReadMorehttp://www.space.com/15257-titan- saturn-largest-moon-facts-discovery-sdcmp.html References External links  * Short stories by Isaac Asimov 1957 short stories Titan (moon) in fiction Works originally published in Venture Science Fiction ","title":"The Dust of Death"},{"id":"9531325","text":"The Towerlight is the weekly independent student newspaper at Towson University.

There were only two issues published in 1921, and the first monthly publication was created in January 1922. Also in the first issue, then-principal Lida Lee Tall wrote that the purpose of the newspaper was: *To give the students a medium for telling their life and their ideals to all groups of interested students in the state. *To give the school its opportunity to place its stamp upon education. *To give the state an opportunity to know what one of its normal schools is doing and aiming to do. *To send a message out into the schools of other states. The original name (The Oriole) was a suggestion from one of the seniors at the time, Ellen Hutchinson. There were a pool of names suggested, and the students voted unanimously for the name.

He became the last (titular) viceroy of New Granada in 1819, serving until 1821, but the colony was in widespread, open revolt. He was also governor of Panama (August‚ÄìOctober 1821). From there he organized an expedition to reconquer Quito, where he arrived in December. He proposed to free the slaves who would fight for the royalist forces. In early 1822 he wrote to Simon Bol√≠var, admitting the failure of Spain to reconquer its former colonies. He died in Quito in April 1822.

He Chaozong fashioned mainly Buddhist white porcelain statuary in the tradition of the Dehua kilns in Fujian Province, known in the west as Blanc- de-Chine. Little documentary evidence remains for He Chaozong apart from extant examples of his ceramic art. A gazetteer entry for 1763 mentions him with other art notables of the Ming Dynasty and establishes that the artist had earned a considerable reputation by his own day. His works identified by his seal are in an entirely different category than the usual Dehua statuary of the period and those later. They are thickly potted and exhibit an artistic expressiveness and creativity unmatched by thinner and standardized unsigned works. He Chaozong and the few other artists of the Dehua kilns were nearly unique in Chinese ceramic history which was characterized by anonymous and industrial scale production. Blumenfield in his Blanc de Chine presents the reader with what may be one of the few believable examples of the artist, replete with a hidden inscription visible to ultraviolet light. Of great interest is the manner of carving of the piece which shows none of the exuberant flowing robes of other examples of the master that may be simply just superficially attractive to the eye. Of additional interest in the Blumenfield book is the He Chaozong seal impressed on an additional Guanyin (p. 133) statue attributed to He Chaozong. All of the characters in the seal appear in reverse. This indicates that at least some seals on Dehua porcelain figures were akin to brands and perhaps of metal construction that could be mistakenly impressed in reverse. The outer borders of the Blumenfield seal, and the seal presented with the Manjurisi statue accompanying this article, were both incised and evidently added after the characters were impressed on the bodies of the figures. He Chaozong Revival The late 19th to the early 20th century experienced a revival of the He Chaozong manner. Notable was the Dehua ceramicist Su Xuejin (, 1869-1919). He is said to have recreated the He Chaozong manner to a degree the originals cannot be distinguished from his own efforts. It can be safely assumed that many of these works bear the seal of the earlier master such as the Manjusri statue presented here. The accompanying thinly potted Guanyin statue displays the typical Dehua gourd seal above the He Chaozong square seal, an indication of an even later period of production. The Manjusri statue is heavily potted, clearly a revival piece and perhaps a close recreation of the original master. It bears a single He Chaozong seal. Both statues appear the products of the same ceramic studio, if not the same artist. The Manjusri statue shows none of the mannerism of robes characteristic of many late Ming and early Qing period Dehua statuary. It seems a revival of a classical manner.

Cudworth is located approximately 85 km north east of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan in the Minnichinas hills. Cudworth is in hilly partially forested country east of the South Saskatchewan River. The area is part of the aspen parkland biome. Cudworth had a population of 770 people in 2011. It has a public K-12 school, 60 local businesses and 3 churches serving the rural area surrounding it. It is surrounded by a large agricultural community. The first pioneers settled the area west of modern-day Cudworth in the late 19th century. German settlers arrived in 1903 and settled in nearby Leofeld, Saskatchewan. When the village was established in 1911 it was named after the English philosopher Ralph Cudworth. Present day Cudworth continues to consist mainly of families with Ukrainian, and German origins. History Main Street The town was originally peopled primarily by settlers of Eastern European origin including Germany, Hungary, Poland and Ukraine. In September 2008, Cudworth's grain elevator went up into flames. Cudworth was one of three Saskatchewan towns that still had an original Saskatchewan Wheat Pool elevator and a Canadian National Railway (CN) train station. Historic sites Located two miles west of Cudworth is the historic Our Lady of Sorrows Shrine. The site consists of an altar, chapel, statue and Stations of the Cross on a hill west of Highway 2. The shrine was established after three children saw a beautiful sad lady dragging chains and carrying a golden cross - when they approached her, she vanished. There is an annual pilgrimage on the tenth Sunday after Easter. It is an official pilgrimage of the Saskatoon Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy. The Cudworth Heritage Museum (former CN Station) (c. 1925) is a Municipal Heritage Property on the Canadian Register of Historic Places.

Written by Richard Price from a story by Ed Burns & Richard Price, and directed by Seith Mann, it originally aired on September 24, 2006. Plot Mayor Royce meets with Burrell to discuss the murdered witness, which Carcetti has used to gain on him in the polls. Royce decides to use city resources to harass Carcetti's campaign. He also orders that State's Attorney Steven Demper downplay the victim's role as a witness to the press, and threatens to drop him from the ticket when he questions the demands. State Delegate Odell Watkins criticizes Royce for his failure to fund a witness protection scheme. Royce still refuses to let it go ahead because Carcetti was involved in planning it and would politically benefit if it were properly funded. Elsewhere, Royce recommends to Burrell that Herc be promoted to sergeant in exchange for Herc's silence about his affair. At the funeral of the witness, Carcetti greets Councilwoman Marla Daniels. Against Wilson's advice, Carcetti does not address the press, deciding that the perceived restraint will make a stronger positive impression on Watkins and Daniels. Bunk visits McNulty and Beadie for dinner; McNulty, now no longer drinking, reluctantly goes to the bar with Bunk. Bodie is visited by Marlo, who gives him an ultimatum: start selling Marlo's product, or give up his corner to one of Marlo's crews. Marlo recognizes Michael and asks Partlow to find out more about him. Bodie also takes an interest in Michael and tries to convince him to stay with his crew instead of going back to school. Michael walks away without answering. Bodie later tells Slim Charles that he has decided to fight Marlo for control of the corner, even without backup. Meanwhile, the New Day Co-Op realizes they face two problems: Marlo is expanding his empire, and drug dealers from New York City are encroaching on the territory in East Baltimore. The Co-Op agrees to strike against the New York dealers and consider including Marlo in the effort. Slim Charles warns Proposition Joe that he is unlikely to be successful negotiating with Marlo, given Stringer Bell's previous failure to make him see reason. As Omar makes his way to buy cereal, lookouts announce his progress and drug dealers flee. On his way home, a frightened dealer drops his stash from a window. Omar reflects that he doesn't want the drugs because there was no effort required to take them, and worries that taking easy targets will eventually make him soft. While staking out a corner shop, Omar spots Greggs photographing the owner, Old Face Andre. Both observers notice a drug resupply being delivered by a man with a child in school uniform. After Greggs leaves, Omar and Renaldo stick up Old Face Andre. At the MCU, Freamon has linked Old Face Andre to Marlo through the wiretap, and hopes to tie him to other Stanfield lieutenants. Rawls appoints Lieutenant Charles Marimow as the new head of the unit, who demands that the Stanfield wiretap be shut down. Freamon confronts Rawls and is forced to accept a transfer back to Homicide. When Greggs considers transferring to Daniels' district, Daniels meets with Rawls and asks him to consider moving her to Homicide as well. Howard \\"Bunny\\" Colvin, the former commander of the Western District, has a new job as head of security at a hotel. The Deacon tells Colvin that the University of Maryland has been awarded a grant to study repeat violent offenders and seek a street- wise agent to act as liaison to potential subjects. Colvin is initially not interested. Later, Colvin loses his job at the hotel when the manager refuses to let him turn in a guest for assaulting a prostitute. Colvin approaches the Deacon and is introduced to the head of the study, Dr. David Parenti, who hopes to enlist Colvin as a field researcher recruiting subjects. Feeling that the age of Parenti's targeted age group is too high, Colvin takes him to interview a prisoner at the Western DEU. The prisoner attacks Parenti during the interview, forcing him to acknowledge that his age group is probably \\"too seasoned.\\" Colvin takes Parenti to the middle school where Prez teaches and, seeing how out of control the children are, persuades the academic to study them instead. On their way to school, Randy, Dukie, Michael, and Bug visit Namond's house to pick him up. Randy's home room teacher is Prez, who he believes to be out of his depth. Prez quickly finds that most of the students are disinterested and disruptive, and has to break up a fight between two girls, Chiquan and Laetitia. As he tidies up at the end of his first day, he finds notes on a math problem showing that at least one of his students followed his material. The following day, while Prez is trying to present a different math problem, Laetitia attacks Chiquan with a box cutter and threatens him. Laetitia is disarmed while Crystal is sent to call for an ambulance. Production=Title reference The title refers to the homeroom classes as the children begin the new school year. Also, this episode shows the home lives of both Omar Little and Jimmy McNulty. In this episode, Kima Greggs and Lester Freamon also search for homes in the police department.  Epigraph  Namond Brice remarking how people tend to be more friendly than usual on the first day of school. The epigraph could also be a reference to Lieutenant Marimow's first day as commander of the Major Crimes Unit.  Miscellanea  * Renaldo is shown reading the novel Drama City by George Pelecanos (a writer for the show). * Andre asks Detective Greggs if she is \\"one of them half-soul, half-Chinese types.\\" Though Kima has never been explicitly identified as mixed-race, actress Sonja Sohn's parents are African- American and Korean-American. * As the students enter the building on their first day, Marcia Donnelly instructs them not to go \\"up the down staircase\\", a likely reference by the writers to the novel of the same name, which deals with high school bureaucracy's compromising effects on a teacher's idealism. * Michael suggests that Chinese characters shown by Namond Brice are misidentified, which turns out to be true.

A steel rod is inserted into the lock and the snap gun briefly fires the rod against all of the lock pins simultaneously, momentarily freeing the cylinder and enabling it to be turned using a tension wrench. The snap gun is an alternative to a conventional lockpick, which requires other techniques such as raking to free the pins. A pin tumbler lock normally contains a set of bottom pins and a set of driver pins. The bottom pins move within pin channels inside the cylinder assembly and are cut at different lengths corresponding to the lock keying. The driver pins are installed in the lock housing and spring pressure forces them to penetrate the lock cylinder and prevent it from turning. If the wrong key is inserted, it will variously push the bottom pins either too high or not high enough, and the lock cylinder can not turn. When the bottom pins are correctly aligned by the key, the top pins are exactly aligned with the barrel of the cylinder, and it may freely turn. A traditional lock pick uses trial-and-error methods to find the correct alignment of the locking pins. The snap gun uses a primary law of physics, the transfer of energy, to momentarily burst all of the driver pins out of the lock cylinder without sending the bottom pins up into it. The snap gun strikes all of the bottom pins at once with a strong impact, and then withdraws again. The bottom pins transfer their kinetic energy to the top pins and come to a complete stop without penetrating the lock housing. The driver pins are thrown out of the cylinder body entirely up into the lock housing. Until the springs force the driver pins back into the cylinder, the lock cylinder is momentarily unobstructed. The physical effect of the impact is similar to the game of billiards, where the cue stick first strikes the cue ball, transferring kinetic energy into the cue ball. The cue ball then strikes a target ball. Since the two balls are very elastic, and since the target ball is free to move, the cue ball (representing a bottom pin) comes to a complete stop at the point of impact and the target ball (representing a driver pin) continues moving with most of the kinetic energy that was formerly in the cue ball. The same physical principles are involved in lock bumping, but the snap gun automates the transfer-of-energy process. A correctly applied snap gun can open a lock very quickly compared to traditional lock picking, but the sharp impact is more likely to damage the lock mechanism than raking, which mimics normal key movements. Louis S. Hanflig patented the first snap gun in the United States in 1934. Subsequent designs were patented by Segal Samuel in 1943 and William J. Miskill in 1951. The earliest snap guns were developed to assist police officers in opening locks without the additional training required for traditional lockpicking techniques. Although lock picking is often associated with crime, snap guns are not commonly used by criminals because concealment is difficult and the device will tend to attract attention from law enforcement. Some legal jurisdictions may classify snap guns as burglary tools or otherwise limit their possession. A person may then be required to be a police officer or locksmith by trade, or to have some other legal sanction, to be in possession of a snap gun.

Therefore, the name E. a. atlanticus might not be valid to refer to the Atlas wild ass. Description Based on ancient drawings, the Atlas wild ass had stripes on its legs as well as a shoulder cross. Of the living subspecies of African wild ass, the Somali wild ass has only leg stripes, and the Nubian wild ass only the shoulder stripe.

History The origins of the channel can be traced back to 21 March 1938, when the EIAR ‚Äì which was to become Radio Audizioni Italiane (RAI) in 1944 ‚Äì began transmitting a second, separately programmed radio service in major cities. Following the end of World War II and reconstruction and improvement of the surviving transmitter network, radio broadcasting was reorganized (with effect from 3 November 1946) to provide two national channels covering most of the country. The first channel was known as the Rete Rossa (red network) and the second as the Rete Azzurra (blue network). These \\"neutral\\" names were chosen to imply that, while at any one time each channel aimed to provide programming of a contrasting style to that available on the other, the two channels were nominally equal in status and had an equally wide-ranging remit. On 1 January 1952, as part of a move aimed at giving each of its channels a more distinctive \\"personality\\" ‚Äì a cultural Terzo Programma (third programme) having already been added on 1 October 1950 ‚Äì RAI renamed the Rete Azzurra as the Secondo Programma (second programme), later to become RAI Radio 2. Programmes Rai Radio 2 is among the highest-rated Italian radio stations in terms of audience share. Viva Radio2, has been one of the most famous and successful programs of the channel, it was hosted by the popular comedian and TV/radio personality Fiorello, together with Marco Baldini. The most popular shows are Il ruggito del coniglio, Caterpillar and 610. Radio 2, like its sister channels Radio 1 and Radio 3, has its own radio news service (Giornale Radio), known as GR2.

This can be done by a person not normally authorized to administer the sacraments. Catholic Church=Latin Church In the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church, the ordinary minister of baptism is a bishop, priest, or deacon (canon 861 ¬ß1 of the Code of Canon Law), and in normal circumstances, only the parish priest of the person to be baptized, or someone authorized by the parish priest may do so licitly (canon 530). \\"If the ordinary minister is absent or impeded, a catechist or some other person deputed to this office by the local Ordinary, may lawfully confer baptism; indeed, in a case of necessity, any person who has the requisite intention may do so (canon 861 ¬ß2), even a non-Catholic or indeed a non-Christian. By \\"a case of necessity.\\" is principally meant imminent danger of death because of either illness or an external threat. \\"The requisite intention\\" is, at the minimum level, the intention \\"to do what the Church does\\" through the rite of baptism.http://www.todayscatholicworld.com/nov05tcw.htm#baptism The Latin Rite considers that the effect of the sacrament is not produced by the person who baptizes, but by the Holy Spirit. In English, the formula to be employed by the layperson in order to ensure the baptism is valid is thus: The layperson pours water over the head of the one to be baptized while saying, \\"N., I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.\\" Eastern Catholic churches In the Eastern Catholic Churches, a deacon is not considered an ordinary minister of baptism. Administration of the sacrament is reserved, as in the Latin Church, to the parish priest. But, \\"in case of necessity, baptism can be administered by a deacon or, in his absence or if he is impeded, by another cleric, a member of an institute of consecrated life, or by any other Christian faithful; even by the mother or father, if another person is not available who knows how to baptize\\" (canon 677 of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches.) Other Eastern churches The discipline of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodoxy and the Assyrian Church of the East is similar to that of the Eastern Catholic Churches. As opposed to the Catholic Church, however, they require the baptizer, even in cases of necessity, to be of their own faith, on the grounds that a person cannot convey what he himself does not possess, in this case membership in the Church. Protestantism=Anglicanism Similar provisions exist throughout the constituent churches of the Anglican Communion, of which the Episcopal Church in the United States of America is one example as below. For the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, the 1979 Book of Common Prayer states that \\"Holy Baptism is especially appropriate at the Easter Vigil, on the day of Pentecost, on All Saints' Day or the Sunday after All Saints' day, and on the Feast of the Baptism of our Lord . . . It is recommended that, as far as possible, Baptisms be reserved for these occasions or when a bishop is present. If on any one of the above-named days the ministry of a bishop or priest cannot be obtained, the bishop may specially authorize a deacon to preside. In that case, the deacon omits the prayer over the candidates, page 308, and the formula and action which follow.\\" The Book of Common Prayer also specifies under the heading \\"Emergency Baptism\\" the following: \\"In case of emergency, any baptized person may administer Baptism according to the following form. Using the given name of the one baptized (if known), pour water on him or her, saying \\"I baptize you in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. \\"The Lord's Prayer is then said. \\"Other prayers, such as the following, may be added \\"Heavenly Father, we thank you that by water and the Holy Spirit you have bestowed on upon this your servant the forgiveness of sin and have raised him to the new life of grace. Strengthen him, O Lord, with your presence, enfold him in the arms of your mercy, and keep him safe forever. \\"The person who administers emergency Baptism should inform the priest of the appropriate parish, so that the fact can be properly recorded. \\"If the baptized person recovers, the Baptism should be recognized at a public celebration of the Sacrament with a bishop or priest presiding, and the person baptized under emergency conditions, together with the sponsors or godparents, taking part in everything except the administration of the water.\\" Other Protestant denominations For Methodists, as well as some High Church Protestant denominations, the ordinary minister of baptism is a duly ordained or appointed minister of religion. Infants, babies, and fetuses The Roman Ritual declares that a child is not to be baptized while still enclosed (clausus) in its mother's womb; it supposes that the baptismal water cannot reach the body of the child. When, however, this seems possible, even with the aid of an instrument, Benedict XIVSyn. Diaec., vii, 5 declares that midwives should be instructed to confer conditional baptism. The Ritual further says that when the water can flow upon the head of the infant the sacrament is to be administered absolutely; but if it can be poured only on some other part of the body, baptism is indeed to be conferred, but it must be conditionally repeated in case the child survives its birth. In these last two cases, the rubric of the Ritual supposes that the infant has partly emerged from the womb. For if the fetus was entirely enclosed, baptism is to be repeated conditionally in all cases.Lehmkuhl, n, 61 In case of the death of the mother, the fetus is to be immediately extracted and baptized, should there be any life in it. Infants have been taken alive from the womb well after the mother's death. After the C√¶sarean incision has been performed, the fetus may be conditionally baptized before extraction if possible; if the sacrament is administered after its removal from the womb the baptism is to be absolute, provided it is certain that life remains. If after extraction it is doubtful whether it be still alive, it is to be baptized under the condition: \\"If thou art alive\\". According to Catholic teaching, the fetus is animated by a human soul from the very beginning of its conception. In cases of delivery where the issue is a mass that is not certainly animated by human life, it is to be baptized conditionally: \\"If thou art a man.\\"Catholic Encyclopedia : baptism Controversial baptisms of Jews In 1858, Edgardo Mortara, then six years old, was taken from his Jewish parents by the police of the Papal States. He had reportedly been baptized by a Roman Catholic servant girl of the family while he was ill, because she feared that otherwise he would not be saved if he died. The Jewish orphans controversy is a legal dispute that occurred after the Second World War when the Holy See under Pope Pius XII issued instructions that Catholic institutions and families should keep baptized Jewish children in their ranks after they had been rescued from a likely deportation to Auschwitz. The Church, however, maintains it returned such children to their relatives, if any could be found.Dimitri Cavalli, ‚ÄúPius‚Äô Children,‚Äù https://theamericanmag.com/pius-children/ Deathbed conversion A deathbed conversion is the adoption of a particular religious faith shortly before dying.

The genre in which he excelled, however, was the diary form with long autobiographical divagations, reminiscences and impressions of people and places, interspersed with literary, philosophical and historical meditations and polemics.  Early years  Christopher Yeghiazarov, the author's father Zarian was born in Shamakhi. His father, Christopher Yeghiazarov, was a prosperous general in the Russian Army, \\"a strong man, profoundly Christian and Armenian,\\" who spent most of his life fighting in the mountains of the Caucasus. He died when Zarian was four years old, which then prompted the family to move to Baku. He then was separated from his mother and placed with a Russian family, who enrolled him in a Russian Gymnasium. After attending the Russian Gymnasium of Baku, in 1895, when he was ten, he was sent to the College of Saint Germain in Asni√®res, near Paris. He continued his studies in Belgium, and, after obtaining a doctorate in literature and philosophy from the Free University (Universite Livre) of Brussels, he spent about a year writing and publishing verse in both French and Russian, delivering lectures on Russian literature and drama, and living a more or less bohemian life among writers and artists. Zarian became involved in the Russian Social Democratic Party, where he became personally acquainted with Vladimir Lenin. After 1909, he was a political exile in Europe, as the tsarist government had reportedly banned his return to the Caucasus because of his revolutionary activities, for which he spent a year and a half in a German jail (1907‚Äì08). He published a few poems in Russian in the revolutionary magazine Raduga and contributed to Belgian publications with prose, poems and critical essays in French. Speaking of this period in his life, Zarian wrote: \\"We used to have cheap food with Lenin in a small restaurant in Geneva, and today, a syphilitic boozer with his feet on a chair and hand on revolver is telling me: 'You counter-revolutionary fanatic nationalist Armenian intellectuals are in no position to understand Lenin.'\\" In addition to Lenin, Zarian also met and befriended such poets, artists, and political thinkers as Guillaume Apollinaire, Pablo Picasso, Georgi Plekhanov, Giuseppe Ungaretti, Louis-Ferdinand C√©line, Paul √âluard, Fernand L√©ger, and the renowned Belgian poet and literary critic Emile Verhaeren. It was Verhaeren who advised him to study his own mother tongue and write in the language of his ancestors if he wanted to reveal his true self. Heeding his advice, Zarian studied Classical Armenian and Modern Armenian with the Mekhitarists on the island of San Lazzaro degli Armeni in Venice (1910‚Äì1912), where he also published Three Songs (1915), a book of poems in Italian (originally written in Armenian), one of which, titled La Primavera (Spring), was set to music by Ottorino Respighi and first performed in 1923. Young Gostan Zarian Zarian then moved to Istanbul, which was then the most important cultural center of the Armenian diaspora, though he often travelled between Venice and Istanbul; and during such a trip, when leaving Istanbul on the ship S.S. Montenegro in 1912, he met his future wife Takuhi (Rachel) Shahnazarian, marrying her on December 4, 1912 in Venice, then returning to Istanbul with her in two months. In 1914, together with Daniel Varoujan, Hagop Oshagan, Kegham Parseghian, and , he founded the literary periodical Mehian, which means pagan temple in Armenian. This constellation of young firebrands became known as the Mehian writers, and like their contemporaries in Europe‚Äîthe French surrealists, Italian futurists, and German expressionists‚Äîthey defied the establishment fighting against ossified traditions and preparing the way for the new. \\"In distant cities people argued and fought around our ideas,\\" wrote Zarian. \\"Ignorant school principals had banned our periodical. Well- known scholars looked upon us with suspicion. They hated us but did not dare to say anything openly. We were close to victory....\\" The tone of the Mehian publications was politically, aesthetically and religiously radical, with a strong influence from German philology‚Äîwith Zarian specifically advocating an anti-Semitic idea that was present in many of his later works of fiction: that Armenians were an Aryan people who needed to overcome the Semite within themselves. A year later, the Young Turk government decided to exterminate the entire Armenian population of Turkey. The genocide that followed claimed 1.5 million victims, among them 200 of the ablest Armenian poets and authors, including two of the Mehian writers, Varoujan and Parseghian. Zarian was able to escape to Bulgaria before the closing of the borders in November 1914, and then to Italy, establishing himself in Rome and later in Florence. In 1919, as a special correspondent to an Italian newspaper, he was sent to the Middle East and Armenia. He returned to Istanbul in late 1921 and there, together with Vahan Tekeyan, Hagop Oshagan, Schahan Berberian, and Kegham Kavafian, he founded another literary periodical, Partsravank (Monastery-on-a-Hill), in 1922. He also published a second book of poems, The Crown of Days (Istanbul, 1922).  Later years  Following the establishment of Soviet rule in Armenia, Zarian returned there and taught comparative literature at the Yerevan State University from 1922-1924. Thoroughly disappointed with the Soviet state, in 1924 he again went abroad where he conducted a nomadic existence, living in Paris (where he founded the short-lived French-language periodical La tour de Babel), Rome, Florence, the Greek island of Corfu, the Italian island of Ischia, and New York City. On August 31, 1934 he married his second wife, the American artist Frances Brooks. In New York he taught the history of Armenian culture at Columbia University and edited the English- language periodical The Armenian Quarterly (1946) which lasted only two issues, but was the first Armenian Studies journal in the United States and published the work of such scholars as Sirarpie Der Nersessian, Henri Gr√©goire, Giuliano Bonfante, and writers such as Marietta Shaginyan. From 1952‚Äì54 he taught history of art at the American University of Beirut (Lebanon). Following an interlude in Vienna and Rapallo, he taught at Berkeley.  Friendship with Lawrence Durrell  The British author Lawrence Durrell and Zarian were friends for many years, exchanging letters between 1937 and 1951 (only twenty-five written by Durrell still exist) in which Durrell addressed Zarian as \\"Dear Master\\" and \\"Ch√®re Ma√Ætre,\\" and spending time together in Greece and Italy (1937‚Äì54), Corfu (1937), Ischia (1950) and Cyprus (1954). They shared a fascination with classical Greek culture and the felt need for an existential reconnection to it via Hellenic culture and geography, self-realization through physical health and spiritual integration. In 1952, Durrell wrote an essay entitled Constant Zarian: Triple Exile in the magazine The Poetry Review in which he wrote that: > It was no conscious choice that made Zarian a classical man‚Äîit was the > development of a natural style of mind, founded in bitter experience and in > a tenacious belief that if man was to be saved from destruction he stood in > need of major artists of a new type‚Äîresponsible men. His own task was no > longer to reject, to criticize, to whine‚Äîbut in the deepest sense of the > word, to submerge in the swift currents of history and to give their impulse > direction and form. \\"To endure and contribute\\"‚Äîthat was the new motto: and > he had never deviated by a hairsbreadth from it in his attitude to his work > and his people. He was now a triple exile: exiled by both Czarist and > Bolshevik; and doubly exiled from the current of European thought by his > choice of language. In a 1950 poem, Durrell describes Zarian in Ischia: > We came originally here to see A character from Prospero called C. (It > stands for Constant) Zarian, Then wild and roguish literary man Who with his > painter wife lives on this island, A life romantic as one could in‚Ä¶Thailand. > Together we tasted every wine, Most of the girls (I mean the Muses Nine) And > some small favours accident affords To such poor chaps as we‚Äîas deal in > words *** You get here by super motor-launch Crowded with chattering girls > from Naples O Such animation such colossal brio It makes one feel much > younger just to see, At least so Zarian says. (He's sixty-three) He scales a > mountain like a wild chamois Despite a certain‚Äîbulk‚Äîavoirdupois And swears > Per Baccho loud as any peasant: Together we've enjoyed a very pleasant Month > of mad cookery and writing talk, Such food, such wine‚Äîa wonder we can walk.  The last years Memorial Plaque in Yerevan While teaching at UC Berkeley, Zarian was visited by the Catholicos of All Armenians Vazgen I, who asked him to return to Armenia after many years of exile.

History  The meaning of Dhulikhel is the \\"place where tigers play\\" as \\"Dhu\\" in Nepal bhasa is tiger. Dhulikhel was the eastern border of ancient Nepal Mandala, and it was one of the territories of Bhaktapur kingdom. Dhulikhel was among the last places to be annexed to the country Gorkha that was being expanded by Prithvi Narayan Shah. Yogi Narharinath, in Itihas Prakash writes about the difficulty Prithvi Narayan Shah faced in conquering Dhulikhel. He writes: \\"Prithvi Narayan Shah found it difficult to capture Dhulikhel. He got scared by the bravery of the locals. Being unable to conquer the place despite fighting for six months, he installed a fort in the hill above side. Staying there, he gave training and organized numerous forces. This scared the people of vicinity and they started fleeing their homes. Just fifty households remained back in Dhulikhel. Despite this, Mahindra Sing Rai fought valiantly. Prithivi Narayan Shah was frustrated to see yet another defeat when one soldier stabbed Mahindra Sing in the back and roped spear. He died on the spot. His brother, Naamsing also was stabbed with khukuri (cited by Somdhwoj Bista, Shahi sainik Itihaas: 36). In this way, the battle ended and Dhulikhel was won on B.S. 1820 Kartik 10 on Sunday. The next day, Khadpu and Panauti were conquered whereas on Kartik 14 Gorkhalis won Banepa, Sanga and Nala.

The company sells hunting and sporting models of shotguns noted for their removable trigger groups, high quality, and high prices (US$7,500‚Äì440,000). Its founder is Daniele Perazzi, and his family owns and operates it.  \\"The Perazzi Experience\\"  Perazzi shotguns are quality guns and are priced accordingly. The factory is in Botticino near Brescia, Italy. The guns are made to order and the customer can actually visit the factory to get a gun fit and select their wood. This is often called \\"The Perazzi Experience\\".The process of purchasing a shotgun normally begins with the specification of all the metalwork first. Custom options include the gauge of the shotgun, the blank and grade of wood for the stock and forearm, barrel length and diameter, rib height and width, the trigger group, and receiver engraving. The guns can also be engraved and there are different levels of engraving quality and also side plates available. A \\"test gun\\" is used to determine the correct fit and measurements for the shotgun to be made for the customer. In the Perazzi factory there is a public viewing area of shotgun production. Customers also have the option of visiting the nearby family owned Cafe / restaurant for homemade pasta and wine while their shotgun is being made.  History  Daniele Perazzi was six years old when he was introduced to firearms by his uncle. Later when he was fourteen, he was hired by a local gunsmith. Before becoming an apprentice to the gunsmith, he often ran errands around town on a bicycle. Perazzi began working on his own at the age of twenty. He found his first commercial success after inventing and patenting a trigger design which he sold to other gun manufacturers. At the age of twenty five in 1957, Perazzi officially established Perazzi Armi. In 1960, Perazzi met Ivo Fabbri, a young automotive engineer who worked for Fiat. The two joined together to create high class, yet affordable shotguns. They were inspired by the British gun makers Boss & Co. and Woodward, who made firearms by hand with extravagant prices. Perazzi and Ivo believed there was a way to create such high class firearms that would be affordable for the average Italian. The pair then began to work with Italian shooting star and gun designer, Ennio Mattarelli. From this partnership the first Olympic grade Perazzi shotgun was born, which Mattarelli used to win the gold medal in Olympic trap at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics with a world record score of 198/200 targets. A year later Fabbri separated from Perazzi to establish his own firearm company, Fabbri Arms. Perazzi continued to work with Mattarelli. The two focused on developing a new shotgun for Mattarelli to shoot at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics. The model MX8 shotgun was born, built specifically for the conditions of shooting in Mexico City. The gun featured a higher rib and respective higher stock to reduce heat distortion along the sight plane in the hot climate. Doing so lowered to the placement of the stock on the shoulder, resulting in the recoil being directed horizontally back into the shooter, rather than vertical muzzle jump. A pistol grip was included to increase the control over traditional straight English stocks. The MX8 was also one of the first guns to have interchangeable screw in chokes in the bottom barrel. This feature is now found in nearly every modern shotgun. Also included was the revolutionary detachable v-springs trigger assembly. Perazzi preferred v-springs over the traditional coil trigger assembly due to their better trigger pulls. The draw back of v-springs was their unreliability. When worn out they can break without warning, unlike the coil trigger assemblies they slowly wear down with age. Since the v-spring assembly was detachable, they could be changed at any time by the competitor for peace of mind. This innovation along with slanted hammers reduced misfires significantly. Following Daniele Perazzi's death in 2012, his son, Mauro, and his daughter, Roberta, have taken over the business.  Olympic use  1964 Tokyo * Ennio Mattarelli ITA. Olympic Trap.

The plaza, or \\"city-square\\", was originally, and is still to this day, the center gathering place in town. Many know it as \\"the heart of Santa Fe\\". The landmark has since grown into a playground for many tourists interested in Spanish, Native American, and Mexican cultures, and includes music, design, jewelry, art and dance. Known to locals simply as the \\"Plaza,\\" it is home to annual events including Fiestas de Santa Fe, the Spanish Market, the Santa Fe Bandstand, and the Santa Fe Indian Market. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the Plaza consists of a central park lined with grass, trees, and benches, which add to the cultural scenery, especially at Christmas time when the Plaza streets and buildings glow with farolitos and the occasional luminaria, and trees glow with lights. Included in the park is a performing arts stage.  Environs  Encompassed in the general Plaza area are historic monuments, restaurants, businesses and art galleries, including the Palace of the Governors (the oldest public building in the U.S.), the New Mexico Museum of Art, Cathedral Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi, and the Loretto Chapel. In true pueblo fashion, the Plaza architecture is traditional adobe. Just from the Santa Fe ski basin, the Plaza dates back to the early 17th century when Santa Fe was settled by conquistadors. Until the mid-19th century, the Plaza lacked landscaping, and ownership of the area transitioned between the Spaniards and the Mexicans throughout the earlier years.  Precolumbian era  The area now known as Santa Fe had been inhabited by Tewa and other peoples, for which there is archaeological evidence as near to the Plaza as the Sena compound.  Spanish era  The Plaza is Santa Fe's historic, cultural and geographic center since c. 1610 when it was established by Don Pedro de Peralta.  Defensive nature  All Spanish colonial towns with a regional governor's office (for Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico, that was the Palace of the Governors) were required by the civic planning section of the laws of the Indies to have a Plaza de Armas to marshal the palace guard in. The original Plaza was a presidio (fort) surrounded by a large defensive wall that enclosed residences, barracks, a chapel, a prison and the Governor's palace. Eventually the wall gave way to large houses built by high-ranking Spanish officers and officials. In the early days, it was found at the end of El Camino Real (the Spanish Royal Road from Mexico City).  Mexican era  US territorial era  In 1822 the famed Santa Fe Trail, a trade route connecting New Mexico with Missouri, was opened with its western terminus at the Santa Fe Plaza.Santa Fe National Historic Trail, National Park Service. The Old Pecos Trail also passed nearby before it was rerouted.  US statehood  Today the Plaza is ringed by structures in the Pueblo, Spanish and Territorial styles that reflect its diverse history. Among the most noted are the original palacio, the Palace of the Governors, built between 1610 and 1612 and San Miguel Mission, a noted landmark c. 1640, and one of the oldest churches in the United States.Santa Fe Plaza-American Southwest-A National Register of Historic Places Travel Itinerary The Plaza is surrounded by restaurants, shops and museums and it serves as a gathering place for both locals and tourists. Many seasonal community events are held at the Plaza, and it is then filled to capacity with people enjoying the magic that is 'The City Different'.Santa Fe Plaza  Points of interest  The Plaza has several mature trees, street lamps, a banco, a central monument, a buried time capsule, a bandstand and a water fountain.

His novel Radiance of Tomorrow was published in January 2014.Hilary S. Kayle, \\"BEA 2013: Ishmael Beah: After War\\", Publishers Weekly, 30 May 2013. His most recent novel Little Family was published in April 2020. Biography In 1991, the Sierra Leone Civil War started. Rebels invaded Beah's hometown, Mogbwemo, located in the Southern Province of Sierra Leone, and he was forced to flee. Separated from his family, he spent months wandering south with a group of other boys. At the age of 13, he was forced to become a child soldier. According to Beah's account, he fought for almost three years before being rescued by UNICEF. Beah fought for the government army against the rebels. In 1997, he fled Freetown by the help of the UNICEF due to the increasing violence and found his way to New York City, where he lived with Laura Simms, his foster mother. In New York City, Beah attended the United Nations International School. After high school, he enrolled at Oberlin College and graduated in 2004 with a degree in Political Science. Beah says he doesn't remember how many people he killed during his time in the Sierra Leonean government army. He and other soldiers smoked marijuana and sniffed amphetamines and \\"brown-brown\\", a mix of cocaine and gunpowder. He blames the addictions and the brainwashing for his violenceJames Pitkin, \\"Ishmael Beah‚ÄîAn ex-child soldier's trip from Sierra Leone's war to a Starbucks bookshelf\\", Willamette Week, 14 February 2007; retrieved 15 February 2007. and cites them and the pressures of the army as reasons for his inability to escape on his own: \\"If you left, it was as good as being dead.\\" During a 14 February 2007 appearance on The Daily Show with host Jon Stewart, Beah said that he believed that returning to civilized society was more difficult than the act of becoming a child soldier, saying that dehumanising children is a relatively easy task.The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, 14 February 2007. Rescued in 1996 by a coalition of UNICEF and NGOs, he found the transition difficult. He and his fellow child soldiers fought frequently. He credits one volunteer, Nurse Esther, with having the patience and compassion required to bring him through the difficult period. She recognized his interest in American rap music and reggae since he was a kid, gave him a Walkman and a Run DMC cassette, and employed music as his bridge to his past, prior to the violence. Slowly, he accepted her assurances that \\"it's not your fault.\\" Living in Freetown with an uncle, he went to school and was invited to speak in 1996 at the UN in New York. When Freetown was overrun by the joined forces of the rebels (RUF or Revolutionary United Front) and Army of Sierra Leone in 1997 (the Army of Sierra Leone was originally fighting against the RUF), he contacted Laura Simms, whom he had met the year before in New York, and made his way to the United States. > \\"If I choose to feel guilty for what I have done, I will want to be dead > myself,\\" Beah said. \\"I live knowing that I have been given a second life, > and I just try to have fun, and be happy and live it the best I can.\\"Alissa > Swango, NYC24, the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, A > Child Soldier Grows Up , 2006.

In 2013, Beah married French born Congolese Iranian Priscillia Kounkou Hoveyda. They have three children and live around the world. Awards, recognition and works A Long Way Gone was nominated for a Quill Award in the Best Debut Author category for 2007. Time magazine's Lev Grossman named it one of the Top 10 Nonfiction Books of 2007, ranking it at No. 3, and praising it as \\"painfully sharp\\", and its ability to take \\"readers behind the dead eyes of the child-soldier in a way no other writer has.\\" The book was also included in Amazon's 100 books to read in a lifetime list. With his new novel, Radiance of Tomorrow, Beah explores the life of a community including Benjamin and Bockarie, two friends who return to Bockarie's hometown, Imperi, after the civil war. The village is in ruins, the ground covered in bones. Radiance of Tomorrow is said to be 'written with the moral urgency of a parable and the searing precision of a firsthand account'.Review of Radiance of Tomorrow; accessed 10 December 2014.

The B4Y replaced the Mitsubishi B2M2 and was the last biplane bomber used operationally by the Imperial Japanese Navy. The Allied reporting name was \\"Jean\\". Design and development In 1932, the Imperial Japanese Navy issued a requirement for a new carrier-borne attack aircraft. Aichi, Mitsubishi and Nakajima responded to this requirement and each built a prototype. None of these aircraft were deemed satisfactory, and the service thus issued in 1934 a new requirement, 9-Shi, for a more capable aircraft to replace the obsolescent Yokosuka B3Y. left The B4Y was designed by Sanae Kawasaki at the First Naval Air Technical Arsenal at Yokosuka. Regarded only as an interim type, the Navy wanted a torpedo bomber offering performance comparable to the Mitsubishi A5M monoplane fighter. The result was a biplane with fixed landing gear and an all-metal structure with metal or fabric skin. To speed development and production, the B4Y utilised the wings from the Kawanishi E7K. The B4Y1 was also the first Navy carrier attack aircraft to utilize an air-cooled engine, as the prototype that was equipped with the Nakajima Hikari 2 radial engine performed better than its opponents. The crew of three occupied two cockpits. The pilot in the open front cockpit and the other two crewmen, (navigator and radio operator/gunner), in the enclosed rear cockpit. Operational Service Kaga off China in 1937 or 1938. On 12 December 1937 3 B4Y1s were involved in the Panay incident during a Japanese attack on the United States Navy gunboat Panay while she was anchored in the Yangtze River outside of Nanjing. Although primarily used as a carrier-based aircraft, the B4Y1 was also used as a land- based bomber on occasion. In 1940, the Nakajima B5N replaced the B4Y1 as the primary carrier attack aircraft, though the B4Y1 did remain in service as an advanced trainer, and flew from and until 1943. Before its replacement, the B4Y1 had flown during the Second Sino-Japanese War and served at the Battle of Midway during June 1942, where eight of them were operated from H≈çsh≈ç.

It is a follow-up to Devil's Crush (Dragon's Fury), a pinball game set in sword and sorcery scenario, wherein the player has to defeat a dragon and a witch. The game was released to generally positive reviews.  Gameplay  There are several various stages and bonus/boss stages in the game. None of the stages is attempting to simulate an actual pinball machine like in most other pinball games and the game only uses basic pinball mechanics.  Plot  The village of Kalfin's Keep has been enslaved by an evil and his consort Darzel, who used her magic to capture three adventurers: Kragor the warrior, a female barbarian named Flavia, and a good sorceress named Rina. The player's role is to guide magic balls (the game's game pinball balls) as a weapon on the quest to rescue the captive heroes, and then them lead in their fight against the forces of darkness. If the game is finished, the dragon is slain and Darzel gets herself trapped in a ball.  Reception  Dragon's Revenge was given a review score of 14.5 out of 20 by GamePro, who called it \\"a solid game for pinball fans and gamers who like fast action\\" and have enjoyed Dragon's Fury.GamePro 55 (February 1994), page 59. Electronic Gaming Monthly complimented the graphics and said the game was worthwhile for those who like pinball games, giving it a 6.8 out of 10. Mean Machines Sega rated 74% but opined it was a mediocre title and a disappointment compared to Dragon's Fury two years earlier. A review in Sega Visions, however, was much more positive, as were the reviews in French magazines such as Consoles Plus (90%), (83%), MEGA Force (84%), and Player One (89%).

It gathers three of Beckett's short stories (\\"The Expelled,\\" \\"The Calmative,\\" and \\"The End\\", all written in 1946) and the thirteen short prose pieces he named \\"Texts for Nothing\\"(1950‚Äì1952). All of these works are collected in the Grove Press edition of Beckett's complete short prose. They were originally written in French and published in 1958 by Les √âditions de Minuit as Nouvelles et Textes pour rien. The stories All three stories deal with the displacement or expulsion of old men who are forced to leave their modest lives in search of a new niche where they might fit. \\"The Expelled\\" Though the story deals with rejection and the forcible ejection of the narrator, it begins with the narrator's complaints regarding the difficulty of counting the stairs down which he had to go once he was expelled. The story follows the narrator as he tries to find a new place for himself, all the while presenting his bitterness and anger towards many things in the world. The resentment in the story is not directed at the injustices of being thrown out of what we assume is the narrator's home, but of the more general injustices of life, such as being born at all, for which the only consolation the narrator finds is in distractions like mathematics. \\"The Calmative\\"\\"The End\\"=\\"Texts for Nothing\\" None of the thirteen \\"Texts for Nothing\\" were given titles; they present a variety of voices thrust into the unknown. According to S. E. Gontarski: \\"What one is left with after the Texts for Nothing is 'nothing,' incorporeal consciousness perhaps, into which Beckett plunged afresh in English in the early 1950s to produce a tale rich in imagery but short on external coherence.\\"Gontarski, S. E. \\"From Unabandoned Works: Beckett's Short Prose,\\" Introduction to The Complete Short Prose 1929-1989. pg xxvi. Thus these texts, when compared to the three earlier stories, as well as First Love, may be interpreted as representing a movement in Beckett's writing from Modernism to Post-Modernism. Unlike the earlier stories, these pieces are no longer completed stories but shards - \\"aper√ßus of a continuous unfolding narrative, glimpses at a never to be complete being (Narrative).\\"Gontarski, pg xxv. This idea is voiced in text 4, where the narrator admits stories are not required any more: > There's my life, why not, it is one, if you like, if you must, I don't say > no, this evening. There has to be one, it seems, once there is speech, no > need of a story, a story is not compulsory, just a life, that's the mistake > I made, one of the mistakes, to have wanted a story for myself, whereas life > alone is enough.Beckett, Samuel. \\"Texts for Nothing,\\" The Complete Short > Prose 1929-1989. pg 116.

The battle was fought on the southern edge of the Bowland Fells, at Clitheroe, Lancashire.  Background  During the civil war in England known as The Anarchy, King David I of Scotland chose to fight for his niece, Matilda. At this time, David was also known to be attempting to absorb Northumberland into Scotland. To these ends David led a Scottish army into Northumberland in early 1138, carefully avoiding battle with the forces led by King Stephen of England, until King Stephen was forced to retire south. This left David free to resume his invasion, which he did, crossing into Northumberland on the 15th April and laying siege to Norham Castle. It was around the time of the siege of Norham castle that William fitz Duncan, the Mormaer of Moray, was placed in command of a part of the Scottish forces, including a contingent of Galwegians, and was sent to raid into the lands of Craven and Clitheroe.  The battle  Not much is known about the battle itself. What is known is that the Scottish forces led by William fitz Duncan encountered a heavily armoured English army in chainmail and helmets near the river Ribble on the 10th June. It is also said that the men of Galloway played a large part in the battle for the Scottish army. These men were known to be lightly armed and armoured, and renowned for their ferocious charges at the enemy. The battle resulted in a victory for the Scottish army, with English sources saying the river Ribble ran red with blood.  Aftermath  After the battle of Citheroe the Scottish army rampaged around the land, killing many and enslaving others. Later, William fitz Duncan and his men rejoined the main Scottish army in time for the Battle of the Standard, near Northallerton, on the 22nd August, which was a victory for the English army.

The Tribunal was superseded by the New South Wales Civil and Administrative Tribunal (NCAT) which came into effect from 1 January 2014. Its functions now operate within a divisional context in the NCAT. The former tribunal was able to appoint guardians and financial managers as substitute decision makers, give to consents to medical treatment for people over 16 years of age and was able to review private arrangements about enduring guardianship and enduring powers of attorney. The former tribunal was established pursuant to and commenced operations on 1 August 1989. Led by its former President, Malcolm Schyvens, who served for a fixed five-year term, the former tribunal was an independent body. However any decisions made by the tribunal were subject to legal appeal, with the Supreme Court of New South Wales being the ultimate body to make rulings on matters of law before the former tribunal. Where the former tribunal made an order to appoint the NSW Public Guardian as guardian of last resort, the Public Guardian would then act as a substitute decision-maker for people under his guardianship. The NSW Public Guardian is an independent statutory official, presently Graeme Smith. The Public Guardian is part of the Department of Justice and is supported administratively by the NSW Trustee and Guardian. Constitution of the former tribunal The former tribunal was established under the Guardianship Act 1987 (NSW) (which was formerly called the Disability Services and Guardianship Act 1987 (NSW)). The former tribunal comprised a president, a deputy president and at least ten tribunal members appointed by the Governor of New South Wales. Prior to its dissolution on 31 December 2013, there were more than ten members appointed. The former tribunal normally sat as a three-member panel. One member was a member with legal expertise, normally a lawyer with more than seven years legal experience. The other two panel members were a professional member, who had experience in the assessment or treatment of adults with disabilities. The other member was a community member, who had experience with people with disabilities. Jurisdiction If a person was found to be unable to manage their own \\"lifestyle decisions\\", the former tribunal may appoint a guardian and would decide who that was. The former tribunal could appoint a financial manager if the person was incapable of managing their own affairs. The former tribunal could decide who that should have been. The former tribunal could also make orders in respect of powers of attorney and may previously have made orders to vary the power of attorney or to replace an attorney. A person unhappy with the decision of the former tribunal may, in certain circumstances, lodge an appeal to either the former Administrative Decisions Tribunal of New South Wales or the Supreme Court of New South Wales. The former Administrative Decisions Tribunal, now replaced by the New South Wales Civil and Administrative Tribunal, could have requested the former Guardianship Tribunal to supply documents subject to the Guardianship Tribunal's discretion and Section 101 of the Guardianship Act, and the Supreme Court could have instructed the former tribunal to supply records relevant to any matter before the Court. Tribunals and courts are exempt from the NSW Ombudsman Act. Although citizens are expected to comply with laws of the State, the Guardianship Act did not specifically instruct the former Guardianship Tribunal to do so and interpretation of Sections of the Guardianship Act by the former Tribunal were not subject to review. Evidence and matters previously considered by the former tribunal were excluded from internal consideration from any request for an internal review. The hearing Prior to its dissolution, all parties to a matter could have attended a hearing. When this was not possible, evidence would be taken by telephone and witnessed were called and gave evidence. Legal representation was only permitted with the former tribunal's leave. The former tribunal was not subject to judicial protocols or rules of evidence, and legal representation was usually not beneficial. The former tribunal assigned a case manager as \\"investigator\\" who received any reports sent to the tribunal; the managers did not initiate investigation of any matters but during the week before the hearing they prepared a report for the tribunal members who sat to consider the case. Reports by doctors and social workers were considered by the former tribunal to be more reliable than community testimony. The former tribunal sat in Sydney, but also sat elsewhere in the State, including a range of locations in regional New South Wales. Caseload In the former tribunal's Annual Report for 2004‚Äì2005, the former tribunal reported that it had received 4,968 application in that year and about 2,000 matters under continuing management by the former tribunal.

The airport is connected by flights to Kolkata, Guwahati and Imphal and is located at a distance of 32 km from Aizawl, the capital of Mizoram. Lengpui Airport is the first large airport in the country to be built by the State Government. History First trial flight for Lengpui Airport The airport was constructed at a cost of ‚Çπ 979 millions and was completed in a record time of two years and two months. The construction work started in December 1995 and completed in February 1998. The Airport is expected to be able to cater to 300 incoming and outgoing passengers. Before the construction of this airport, Aizawl was from the nearest railway head at Bairabi and from the nearest airport at Silchar. With regards to land acquisition it has been found out that about 65 percent of the area acquired, belonged to some high government officials and political leaders at Aizawl who started buying plots from people in Lengpui village at very low prices. They then donated the land to the government for the airport for which the rich persons got much more compensation as donors than the actual farmers. Previously, Lengpui was also served by Air Deccan which later became Kingfisher Red but the airlines stopped operating from Lengpui on April 2012. Technical details The 2,500-metre runway of the Lengpui airport is unique in that it has many hilly streams running underneath. The airport is one among the three airports in India that has a table top runway (others being Kozhikode and Mangalore) which creates an optical illusion that requires a very precise approach from the pilot. At present, Lengpui Airport has installed Cat-I Instrument Landing System. which will help planes land safely during low visibility conditions. A Runway safety area and Isolation parking bay are also under construction plan. The Indian Air Force is planning to station at least 4 jet fighters at Lengpui airport. Indian Oil handles the Aviation fuel service department of lengpui airport. Lengpui airport terminal building  Airlines and destinations Incidents and accidents On 4 May 2011, a Northeast Shuttle's Cessna Caravan (VT-NES) crash landed at Lengpui airport, overshooting the runway. While there were no fatalities, the aircraft was damaged beyond repair and was written off. The officials at Lengpui airport attributed the mishap to rainfall coupled with strong winds reducing visibility during landing. However, the DGCA enquiry reported the cause of the accident to be \\"inadequate skill level of the pilot to execute a safe landing during marginal weather conditions\\". The pilot had failed to execute a stabilized approach. As a consequence the aircraft touched down well past the runway threshold, overshot the runway and fell into a ravine. The overshoot was a consequence of the pilot choosing to continue with the unstable approach, rather than going around to divert or make another approach. The DGCA also held the operator responsible for not ensuring that the pilot met the minimum regulatory requirements of the DGCA. The pilot was not cleared as per DGCA regulations to operate in airports situated in hilly terrain. The regulator also observed that the availability of a runway end safety area (RESA) and a functioning instrument landing system (ILS) would have increased the safety margin at the airport.

In boxing and mixed martial arts bouts, introductions occur after both fighters have entered the ring or cage. Along with each fighter's name, the announcer typically also announces their height, weight, town, nickname, win/loss record and any current or past titles the fighter has won. In MMA, the fighting discipline is usually announced. In professional wrestling, wrestlers are similarly introduced, though usually before or as they come to the ring (the weight of each female wrestler is unannounced in most promotions). In-ring introductions are sometimes used for title matches or other major bouts, to add a \\"big fight feel\\". The ring announcer often states the rules of the match. In boxing and MMA, this is usually limited to the number of scheduled rounds and the length of each round. In professional wrestling, the variations are much more numerous and so the announcer may have to explain significantly more to the audience. When an MMA or boxing bout concludes, the ring announcer announces the winner, time of finish and method. If the fight lasts all scheduled rounds, the announcer will read the fight judges' scorecard totals, before announcing a unanimous, majority, or split decision victory for one of the fighters, or a draw. This is typically done from inside the ring or cage. In professional wrestling, the announcement is usually performed outside the ring, and typically doesn't mention the time or method of victory; however, as professional wrestling shows do incorporate an official timekeeper at ringside, much like boxing and MMA, some ring announcers may be informed of the time of the fall at the match's conclusion and will relay that information to the audience as well. Even further to this, some professional wrestling matches will stipulate a time limit, the confines within which a wrestler must win if he wishes to avoid a time-limit draw. In cases like this, the ring announcer may inform the audience of how much time has passed (and will ordinarily do so every five minutes) and how much time remains. In a championship match, the announcer specifies that the winner is either still the champion or the new champion.

Social scientists have developed class models on the socio-economic stratification of Ottoman society which feature more or less congruent theories. Albert Hourani described the Ottoman Empire as \\"a bureaucratic state, holding different regions within a single administrative and fiscal system\\". The Ottoman Empire lasted for over six hundred years (1299‚Äì1923) and encompassed present-day Turkey, the Balkans and the Fertile Crescent. Thus the Empire included an extremely diverse population ranging from the Muslim majority (Turks, Arabs, Bosniaks, Albanians, etc) to various minority populations, specifically Christians and Jews, whom Muslims referred to as \\"People of the Book\\". As an imperial/colonial enterprise, the Ottoman system allowed some Greeks, Tatars, Italians, Albanians, Serbians, Hungarians, Georgians, Bulgarians, Ruthenians and Circassians, slave and free, to attain high office as soldiers, viziers or members of the imperial family.

Several women are known to have composed music in Northern Italy and Austria during the period 1670 to 1725. Of those women, though there is no remaining biographical information, Camilla de Rossi by far has the most surviving works. The only known biographical detail about Camilla is her Roman citizenship. She always signed the title pages of her manuscripts as Romana, or a woman of Roman descent. Rossi composed four oratorios for solo voices and orchestra, all of which were commissioned by Emperor Joseph I of Austria and were performed in the Imperial Chapel in Vienna. All of Rossi‚Äôs surviving works demonstrate an intimate knowledge of stringed instruments and, as Barbara Garvey Jackson describes, \\"a keen interest in tone color\\". Her oratorios are all for solo voices; none of her works use choruses. She calls for various instruments (chalumeaux, archlute, trumpets, oboe) with string orchestra (including continuo). Her oratorio, Il Sacrifizio di Abramo, reveals her knowledge of instruments, strings in particular, but also demands two chalumeaux, an instrument first heard in Vienna in 1707, one year before her oratorio was performed for the first time in 1708. Her cantata Fr√° Dori e Fileno is for strings and two soloists. Where she learned these skills as a musician and as a composer are entirely unknown as of today. Especially given the fact that she was a woman from Rome, she would not have had access to the musical gatherings fostered by the pope and his cardinals.

Lake Harris is the largest lake entirely in Lake County, at , with an irregular shape when viewed from the air. An adjoining bay, Little Lake Harris, east of SR 19, is a smaller version of the lake. The combined area of the two lakes exceeds . The lake's northeastern shore is a landing approach zone for Leesburg International Airport. It is a harbor city for Leesburg, at the northwestern shore of the lake. At the westernmost point of the lake is U.S. Route 27/SR 25. Lake Harris' primary inflow is at its southwestern shore from the Palatlakaha River, which originates from the Clermont chain of lakes to the south. Other inflowing rivers include Helena Run, and outflow from many small springs in Yalaha. Lake Harris' depth is much greater than Lake Okeechobee to the south, with many deeper holes and ledges. The lake is surrounded by sandhills and cypress trees, part of the Central Florida Ridge. This region has the highest elevations in central Florida, including Sugarloaf Mountain reaching above sea level. Compared to the rest of Florida, which is relatively flat, it is quite hilly. There are three public launching ramps on Lake Harris; off U.S. Route 27 to the west, Venetian Gardens in Leesburg, and Hickory Point near the Howey-in-the-Hills bridge off SR 19. There is a small but serviceable ramp on the east side of Little Lake Harris in the town of Astatula. The lake is ringed with cattail and bullrush, except for the occasional boat, dock, or seawall. The depth in these tall grasses normally ranges from . The bottom is mostly hard sand, except for some marshy areas where the bottom is considerably softer. These sheltered areas around the edge can offer a good place to fish during inclement weather. Origin of name Lake Harris derives its name from Ebenezer Jackson Harris (1815‚Äì1885), Findagrave - Ebenezer Jackson Harris a pioneer resident who lived at Yalaha on the south side of the lake in the 1840s. Lake Harris had been originally called \\"Lake Eustis\\" since 1823, in honor of Colonel Abraham Eustis. A freshwater lake to the north, the modern-day Lake Eustis, now honors the pioneer settler.

On March 21, 2006 the band released their debut album, Arcade Rock. Karate High School's second album, The League Of Tomorrow, was released on September 4, 2007, which further honed the band's layered, keyboard-driven style of alternative rock. On November 11, 2008, Karate High School announced that they had signed to Eyeball Records, and would release a new record entitled Invaders on May 19, 2009. In early 2010 Paul McGuire announced that he was done producing music under the name Karate High School and has since chosen to go into other studies. Style Karate High School's style evolved over the last three records. Once described as an \\"aggressive blend of poppy punk, hyper post- hardcore, and eight-bit blips\\"; the band began as a spazzy, catchy, keyboard- driven rock act on their debut record, but grew and matured over the course of three records to a sound that crosses the genres of rock, punk, experimental, electronica, and power-pop. Their sound has often been referred to as synthcore. While 2007's The League Of Tomorrow effortlessly gear-shifted through poppy, upbeat melodies to heavy electronica-fused pop-punk, their 2009 album Invaders focused on all of the aforementioned elements and further evolved the band's sound. The band's sound has also been called Nintendocore. Members Karate High School was the songwriting project of Paul McGuire, and he wrote all the music and lyrics for the band. Ray Bautista joined the group as the touring keyboard player, and was the only member to be in the band since Arcade Rock. For recording purposes, Paul produced all three records and played all the instruments on The League Of Tomorrow.

It was formerly found north of the Saharan Desert. Other subspecies live currently in grasslands south of the Sahara, from Senegal in the west to Eritrea and Ethiopia in the east and down to central Tanzania. The red hartebeest and Lichtenstein's hartebeest, alternatively considered subspecies or sister species of the common hartebeest, are present in southern Africa.Kingdon, Jonathan (1997) The Kingdon Field Guide to African Mammals Princeton University Press Name The ancient name for the bubal hartebeest was bubalus (Latin) or boubalos (Greek), from which the term buffalo is derived. Authors that describe the wild bubali of north Africa include Herodotus, Dio Cassius, Strabo, Polybius, Diodorus Siculus and Oppian.Kenneth F. Kitchell Jr., Animals in the Ancient World from A to Z (Routledge, 2014), pp. 18‚Äì19.  Description  Bubal hartebeest in The Book of Antelopes (1894). The bubal hartebeest was described as uniformly sand colored, save for \\"an ill-defined patch of greyish on each side of the muzzle above the nostrils\\", and the terminal tuft of the tail, which was black.Cited in Harper (1945) after Sclater and Thomas (1894) In this case the subspecies was similar to the plain colored Lelwel hartebeest, lacking white or black facial markings such as those present in the Western and Swayne's hartebeest. It measured 43 inches at the shoulder and the horns were 'U' shaped when seen from the front. Like other hartebeests, the bubal was a social animal. Luis del M√°rmol Carvajal wrote in 1573 that herds of 100 to 200 animals could be found in northern Morocco. According to 19th century writers, the bubal hartebeest preferred rocky areas with a fair amount of vegetation, in contrast to the sandy, drier habitat of the Addax. Its main predator was the also extinct Barbary lion.Extinct and vanishing mammals of the Old World (1945) by Harper, Francis, from the Internet Archive retrieved 16:52 30.9.11  History and extinction  The bubal hartebeest ranged originally across Africa north of the Sahara, from Morocco to Egypt, where it disappeared earlier.Extinct and vanishing mammals of the Old World (1945) by Harper, Francis, from the Internet Archive retrieved 16:52 30.9.11 It was also present with certainty in the Southern Levant prior to the Iron Age,Tsahar E, Izhaki I, Lev-Yadun S, Bar-Oz G (2009) Distribution and Extinction of Ungulates during the Holocene of the Southern Levant. PLoS ONE 4(4): e5316. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0005316 but Harper (1945) found only \\"none too well substantiated\\" recent historical records from Israel and Arabia. The northern limit of the bubal hartebeest's range was the Mediterranean coast; large herds were still reported existing in Morocco north of the Atlas Mountains in 1738. As for the southern limits of its distribution, \\"wild oxen (Antilope bubalis)\\" were mentioned living in the Tassili mountains of the central Sahara in 1850. However, the identity of the latter animals is debatable. Even if they were indeed hartebeest, they might not belong to the northern subspecies.Extinct and vanishing mammals of the Old World (1945) by Harper, Francis, from the Internet Archive retrieved 16:52 30.9.11 The subspecies declined sharply during the course of the 19th century, especially after the French conquest of Algeria, when entire herds were massacred at once by the colonial military. By 1867 it could only be found in the mountain ranges of north-western Africa that are near or within the Saharian desert. It disappeared from the Tunisian Atlas in 1870, and the last animal in this country was shot in 1902 near Tataouine. Outside of this instance, the bubal seems to have entered the 20th century restricted to the Western Atlas, from Boulemane in Morocco to the south of the Wahran department in Algeria. The last known herd, numbering only 15 animals, was located near Outat El Haj, Morocco in 1917; all but 3 of them were killed by the same hunter. The last animal in Morocco was shot in Missour in 1925. It probably disappeared around the same time in Algeria. One last specimen is mentioned as having been 'collected' in the 1920s near Geryville, south of the Chott Ech Chergui. While Harper, writing in 1945, considered that the subspecies could still possibly exist at the time in this area, he also mentioned that different campaigns in the 1920s and 1930s failed to find any animals in Morocco, Algeria or Tunisia, even in regions where it had been reported as numerous only a few decades before.Extinct and vanishing mammals of the Old World (1945) by Harper, Francis, from the Internet Archive retrieved 16:52 30.9.11 The bubal hartebeest was protected under the London Convention of 1933.Extinct and vanishing mammals of the Old World (1945) by Harper, Francis, from the Internet Archive retrieved 16:52 30.9.11  Zoo and museum specimens  1837 illustration Individuals of bubal hartebeest were sometimes captured and kept in British, French, Italian and German private and public zoos around the start of the 20th century, although Ruxton and Schwarz (1929) failed to find any preserved in museums of these countries. The last captive bubal, a female (sometimes wrongly reported as the last bubal ever), died in Paris in 1923. The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia received another female in 1905 from the Zoological Society of Philadelphia, which was stuffed. This is possibly the only bubal preserved in the United States of America.Extinct and vanishing mammals of the Old World (1945) by Harper, Francis, from the Internet Archive retrieved 16:52 30.9.11  Relation with ancient civilizations  Remains of bubal hartebeests have been found in several Egyptian archaeological sites such as Abadiyeh, Saqqara and Karanis, the last one dating to the early Middle Ages.Extinct and vanishing mammals of the Old World (1945) by Harper, Francis, from the Internet Archive retrieved 16:52 30.9.11 A hieroglyph meaning \\"baby hartebeest\\" also existed: :E9 For these reasons, it has been suggested that the bubal was domesticated in Ancient Egypt, or at least used as a sacrificial animal..article created by Peter Maas retrieved 02:20GMT 30 March 2009 It is also mentioned in the Old Testament under the name of Yachmur (1 Kings 4:23) It is a likely candidate for the unidentified \\"the'o\\" in Deuteronomy, described as a kosher animal.

Major-General of the Ottoman Cavalry, Commander in Chief at Tripoli, Libya. Sometime Major √† la suite of the Hussar Regiment of Prussian Gardes du Corps. Received: the Collar of the Hanedan-ƒ±-Ali-Osman, the Ni≈üan-ƒ±-Ali-Imtiyaz, the Ni≈üan-ƒ±-Osmaniye, and the Ni≈üan-ƒ±-Mecidiye Special Class in Brilliants, the Grand-Cross of the Order of the Red Eagle of Prussia, the Grand-Cordon Privy Councillor of the Austrian Imperial Order of Leopold of Austria-Hungary in 1917 and the Iron Cross 2nd Class of Prussia. Succeeded on the death of his elder half-brother, Ahmed Nihad Efendi, as Head of the Imperial House of Osman in 1954. Had he been the reigning Sultan he would have been Sultan Osman IV. Life He was born as the third son of Prince Mehmed Selaheddin Efendi, by his sixth wife, Jalefer Hanƒ±m, and was a grandson of Murad V. He spent his early childhood confined to the √áƒ±raƒüan Palace, Ortak√∂y, in Istanbul. The Palace served as an enforced residence to his grandfather Murad V, who had been deposed in 1876, and replaced by his brother, Abd√ºlhamid II. The restrictions imposed on the former Sultan extended to his entire family, and were not lifted until his death in 1904. On the death of his grandfather, Osman Fuad Efendi left this life of confinement and for a few years lived in the properties rented by his father in Feneryolu, Kuru√ße≈üme, and Ortak√∂y, before returning to the √áƒ±raƒüan Palace to live with his grandmother Empress ≈ûayan Kadƒ±n, the third wife of Murad V. Early military career When Tripolitania was invaded by Italy in 1911, Osman was aged sixteen. He joined the Volunteer Officers Force (Fed√¢√Æ Z√¢bit√¢n) raised by Enver Pasha and saw active service in the campaign. Osman Fuad Efendi, took part in the Cyrenaica Operation in the Benghazi Sanjak. Here, he made the acquaintance of Mustafa Kemal Bey, who was then a Captain. On returning to Istanbul, he attended the Ottoman Military Academy. Once he had completed his studies there, he went to Palestine. Following this, he was sent to Germany together with his cousins Princes Abd√ºrrahim Hayri Efendi and Mehmed Abd√ºlhalim Efendi, where he studied at the Military Academy in Potsdam. After graduation, he joined the Imperial Guard of Hussars, where he held the rank of Captain. After two and a half years in Germany, Osman was recalled to the Ottoman Empire, following the outbreak of the First World War. During his journey back to his homeland, the German submarine in which he was travelling was torpedoed by British submarines near the port of Kiel, and Osman suffered a head injury from the lid of an escape hatch. He was operated on at an Austrian military field hospital on the shores of the Adriatic. When he recovered, he was given a command in the Imperial Household Cavalry, with the rank of Major. He was an accomplished soldier, and was one of many Imperial Ottoman princes who served bravely in the Imperial Army throughout the First World War. He was first sent to Sinai, but his head wound reopened and he was sent to Aleppo for further treatment. It was while there that he met Mustafa Kemal Bey again, who was now also a major. While stationed there, they stayed at the Hotel Baron, which still survives to this day. Osman Fuad also fought at Gallipoli in defence of his homeland from the invading Allied forces and was awarded the Gallipoli Star. Like so many other Turks, he was wounded while serving there, but unlike hundreds of thousands he was lucky to survive. He was then transferred back to Istanbul, where he became deputy commander of the Imperial Household Cavalry, accompanying Sultan Mehmed V on his procession to and from the mosque for Friday prayers, and at other ceremonies. He also became the Sultan's personal Aide-de-Camp. However, Osman longed for active service and was soon sent to Libya once more, this time in the suite of Nuri Pasha, an uncle of Enver Pasha. He then returned to Istanbul for a short time until in January 1918, when he was only 23 years of age, he was promoted from the rank of Major to that of Major-general. Commander-in-Chief of the Africa Groups Following the appointment of Nuri Pasha to the Army of Islam, Osman Fuad Efendi became Commander-in-Chief of the Africa Groups Command and was posted back to Libya, travelling in German submarine UC-78 by way of Pola. He had under his command a force of between 300 and 500 Ottoman officers and soldiers, as well as between 15,000 and 30,000 Libyan volunteers. His Chief of Staff was Abdurrahman Nafiz Bey (G√ºrman). Despite his efforts in the field, Osman Fuad Efendi and his men were unable to withstand the well-equipped Italian force of 60,000 opposing them. In April 1917 the Ottoman force in Benghazi had surrendered. Following the Armistice of Mondros, signed between the Ottoman Empire and the Allies in 1918, Osman Fuad Efendi refused to lay down his arms, as he had been ordered to do. He continued to put up a resistance for a few more months from his headquarters in the city of Misrata, and was encouraged in this by Mustafa Kemal Pasha, who had advised him to \\"declare his independence\\" and not to pay any attention to the orders he received from the Ministry of War in Istanbul. The two men had become friends after their previous meetings and the subsequent time they had spent together in the capital at the Pera Palace Hotel. However, as a result of the Armistice, the German submarines which had been supplying the Ottoman forces with supplies and ammunition were unable to put to sea, and this left the Ottomans in a very difficult situation. Rather than surrender to the Italians and risk being shot as a terrorist, Osman Fuad Efendi decided to give himself up to the French in Tunisia. Firstly he disbanded his force of volunteers. He then rode south, with the Ottoman troops under his command, into the desert until they were out of the Italians' reach before turning west. During this time, he was suffering from dysentery. On reaching the Tunisian border he announced his intention of surrendering to the French, on condition that he and his men would not be handed over to the Italians. The French agreed to this condition, however within 24 hours they handed him and his men over to the Italians. The Italians sent their captives to Tripoli, distributing them among the various prisoner-of-war camps where German soldiers were also being held. Knowing that he was an Ottoman Imperial Prince they were reluctant to shoot him, so he was sent to Naples in a military transport ship. He was first kept in a ship off the island of Ischia, then placed in confinement in a house in Naples for nearly eight months. Towards the end of 1919 he was released, and allowed to return to Istanbul, where he was made garrison commander of the city, and where he had several discussions with Sultan Mehmed VI on matters of state. Marriage On 26 March 1920, at the Feriye Palace, Be≈üikta≈ü, Osman married Kerime Halim of Egypt (born in Istanbul 15 March 1898, died childless 28 March 1971), the second daughter of Abbas Halim Pasha, sometime Governor- General of Bursa and Minister for Public Works, by his wife Hadice, second daughter of Mehmed Tawfik Pasha, Khedive of Egypt, GCB, GCSI. One of the people who attended the wedding in the √áƒ±raƒüan Palace was ƒ∞smet Bey (ƒ∞n√∂n√º), who had recently stayed as a guest at Osman Fuad's house for eighteen months. At the time of the expulsion of the Ottoman Imperial family, Mustafa Kemal only felt it necessary to exile the Imperial Princes. It was ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º, who was then Prime Minister, who insisted on having the whole family, both men and women of all ages, expelled. It is said that ƒ∞n√∂n√º‚Äôs unfounded hatred for the Imperial family was the result of a complex acquired at this time. The marriage ended in divorce at Paris on 22 November 1932. Exile When the nationalist movement in Anatolia turned against the Istanbul administration, Osman Fuad Efendi left Istanbul in secret, with his wife, on board an Italian steamboat. He then lived overseas for over two years. On the appointment of Abd√ºlmecid as Caliph, he returned to Istanbul, where he lived at the √áƒ±raƒüan Palace. However, following the establishment of the Turkish Republic and the abolition of the Ottoman Sultanate and the Ottoman Caliphate, in March 1924 the entire Imperial Ottoman family was forced into exile. At the time of the abolition of the Caliphate, Osman Fuad Efendi was again in Rome. While there he received a letter via military courier from Mustafa Kemal Pasha, his former friend and fellow veteran of the Ottoman campaigns of the First World War. In this letter Mustafa Kemal said, ‚ÄúI am very sorry. I am unable to make an exception for you and you will have to remain in exile. The law applies to everyone in the Imperial family.‚Äù Osman Fuad Efendi sent a reply via Muhtar Pasha, the Turkish Ambassador in Washington, saying, \\"If Mustafa Kemal Pasha wishes, I will come to Anatolia.\\" He never received a reply. This 29-year-old Ottoman prince, who had fought so bravely and loyally for his homeland and his people, was never to return to Turkey, since he died only one year before the decree of exile was lifted in 1974. While in exile, Osman Fuad Efendi lived in many places, including Geneva, Rome, Cairo, Paris, Nice, and Cannes. When in Paris, he sometimes stayed with his elder sister Princess √Çdile Sultan. He and his wife divorced after thirteen years of marriage in Paris in 1932. Life in exile was always very difficult, since members of the Imperial Ottoman family had no financial means, and all yearned to return to their country. The reputation and skill of Osman Fuad Efendi as a soldier and tactician were much admired. While Marshal Erwin Rommel was in Libya, he studied the operations carried out there by Osman and subsequently imitated these tactics in his own desert warfare. During the Second World War, Osman Fuad Efendi was living in Alexandria, Egypt, under the occupation of the British. Appreciating that he had commanded the loyalty of the Libyan people, the British offered to make him a Colonel in their army and to award him full powers if he agreed to conduct a commando campaign against the Germans there. However, he refused on the grounds that he did not wish to fight against his former comrades-in-arms. When the war ended, he was given a diplomatic passport by the French government and took the opportunity to travel the world, visiting countries as far as India and Iceland. On the death of his elder brother, Ahmed Nihad Efendi, on 4 June 1954, Osman Fuad assumed the position of head of the Ottoman family. Unlike his brother, Osman Fuad chose to adopt an extremely modern lifestyle, and was known to be fond of his pleasures and to have a natural love for life. As a young Imperial Ottoman Prince, he had been popular and well-loved, and had often been seen driving in an open-topped Mercedes in Istanbul, always dressed impeccably. He was brave, loyal, and generous, as well as being good-looking and a skilled horseman. He possessed a large number of medals and decorations awarded for his courage and service to his country, and which covered his chest when he wore his dress uniform. He was a true prince and perfectly fitted for the part he had to play. From 1911‚Äì1912 he became the fifth Chairman of Fenerbah√ße SK, a club that continues to be supported by members of the Ottoman family today. Like all other members of his family, he had a talent for music. He was an accomplished violinist, and during his exile he developed his passion for music. He particularly enjoyed playing Hungarian gypsy music on his violin, much to the enthrallment of those lucky enough to hear him play. Three years before his death, he was interviewed by a reporter from the H√ºrriyet newspaper named Doƒüan Ulu√ß. At the time, Osman Fuad Efendi was living in Room Number 6 at the Hotel Royal Bretagne in Montparnasse, Paris. This room contained only a bed, a cracked washbasin and two chairs. His description of the life the members of the Imperial family were leading in exile was a graphic one, and shocking. ‚ÄúWho would have thought it would come to this? Who would have thought that General Prince Osman Fuad, the former commander of the Ottoman army in Tripoli, would one day be thrown out of a third-rate hotel in Paris as he could not afford to pay the bill? No longer can we set foot in the land which our forefathers fought for and ruled over, that land that holds so many bitter-sweet memories for us. Is it right that we should be treated thus? How shameful that the Ottoman family should be living out their days far from their native country, forced to take refuge in foreign lands. Some of us have committed suicide, unable to bear the poverty and destitution. Some of us have died whispering ‚ÄúAh, Turkey! Turkey!‚Äù with our last breaths. Our children, born abroad, go to foreign schools and grow up without learning Turkish, knowing nothing of our history or our religion ‚Äì just as if they were foreigners. What I would request from you is that you should print a photograph of me in your newspaper when I leave this world. Under it, write ‚ÄòOsman Fuad‚Äô ‚Äì no more than that. It may be that some people will remember me.\\" Death Fuad died at Nice, France, following a short illness on 19 May 1973 and is buried in the Moslem cemetery, Bobigny, Paris. Although he had no children, he was particularly close to his only nephew Prince Ali Vasib Efendi, and as such he treated his nephew's son Prince Osman Selaheddin Osmanoƒülu as if he was his own, naming him as his heir.

He obtained his medical degree in Paris in 1893, and afterwards was associated with the H√¥pital Bic√™tre and Salp√™tri√®re. He succeeded Louis- Antoine Ranvier (1835‚Äì1922) in what then became the chair of comparative histology at the Coll√®ge de France. Nageotte specialized in anatomical research of the nervous system, and in his work stressed the importance of microscopic anatomy. He performed research of nerve fibers and the myelin sheath, and conducted studies involving connective tissue. He provided a description of boutons terminaux (terminal buttons) of spinal nerves, and did extensive work with nerve grafting.Dictionary of medical eponyms by Barry G. Firkin, Judith A. Whitworth In addition he investigated tabes dorsalis, and with Joseph Babinski (1857‚Äì1932), the Babinski-Nageotte syndrome was described. This syndrome is a complex of symptoms associated with medullary lesions. He documented this disorder in a treatise called H√©miasynergie, lat√©ropulsion et miosis bulbaire. Also with Babinski, he co-wrote a book on cerebrospinal fluid. In his 1910 article,Nageotte J. 1910. Phenomenes de secretion dans le protoplasma des cellules nevrogliques de la substance grise. C R Soc Biol. 68, 1068-1069 he surmised that glial cells behaves like an endocrine organ and secretes several molecules into the blood. Albeit the importance of this proposal had not been recognized in his time, today we know that glias have neurotransmitter receptors and even more, release neurotransmitters with similar mechanisms as neurons.

Born in Detroit, Michigan, Wiloch was \\"one of a handful of contemporary American masters of the prose miniature,\\" Greg Boyd wrote in Asylum. Writing in the Gore Letter, Michael Arnzen stated: \\"Wiloch has been quietly working away in relative obscurity in his own 'niche' for two decades, developing a one-of-a-kind approach to a form he almost entirely owns. Wiloch writes surrealist short-short pieces, often no longer than a page, that are as philosophical as they are whimsical, as clever as they are poetic, and as disturbing as they are intelligent.\\" According to Bruce Boston, writing in Illumen magazine, Wiloch is \\"arguably the leading writer of prose poems in the genre field for the last two decades.\\" English writer and artist A.C. Evans wrote in Stride magazine that Wiloch portrays \\"fragmentary confrontation with alien Otherness described in a symbolic vocabulary of closed rooms, casual catastrophe, uncanny Fortean phenomena, rituals of cruelty, and fleeting visions of transmundane worlds.\\" Wiloch was the principal instigator and editor of Grimoire, a journal of surrealistic art and literature published from 1982-1985 that featured some of the earliest published work by the notable American horror writer Thomas Ligotti. After working on the editorial staff of Gale, a reference book publisher, for some 26 years, Wiloch became a freelance writer and editor in 2004. Much of Wiloch's recent published writing is prose poetry, and has appeared in collections from various small press publishers including Snake Press and Wordcraft of Oregon. Wiloch has illustrated books by authors such as Bruce Boston, Robert Frazier, Andrew Joron, and Jessica Amanda Salmonson, and has contributed artwork to his own books as well.

Critical reception The Boatlift garnered a positive reception from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 69, based on 5 reviews. Patrick Taylor of RapReviews praised the album's versatile production for going beyond crunk music and showing depth in club anthems, concluding that \\"Pitbull continues to prove himself as an MC who is able to bridge Latin hip hop and Southern hip hop, creating a sound that should appeal to fans from both camps. He may not be the deepest lyricist on earth, and his attempts at bedroom music may fall flat, but he makes a mean soundtrack for a night out.\\" DJBooth's Nathan Slavik praised Pitbull for exploring vastly different genres to create party tracks with a worldview appeal and doing them with a talented cast of featured artists and producers, saying that \\"The Boatlift isn‚Äôt going to expand your intellectual or spiritual horizons, but it is without question a go-to album for all your booty-shakin needs.\\" Jose Davila of Vibe also praised the album's genre-hopping production mixing well with Pitbull's bilingual, charismatic flow, saying that it \\"solidifies Pitbull's position as one of the most diverse party MCs around. And little else.\\" Wilson McBee of Slant Magazine said that, \\"For better or worse, the story of Boatlift concerns more the production and song structures than Pitbull‚Äôs own rapping. It‚Äôs clear he‚Äôd rather be a chorus-shouter than a verse-spitter, or at least he believes that will help him sell more records.\\" AllMusic's David Jeffries commended the production and lyrical hooks for being catchy but felt that it lacked a sense of personality and talent compared to El Mariel, saying to consider The Boatlift \\"a fun floor-filler, but just not up to Pitbull's usual standards.\\" A writer for Music for America felt that Pitbull was wasting his talent throughout the record rhyming typical club tracks and party jams and would like to see him collaborate with artists like Little Brother, 2Mex, Deep Thinkers and Roots Manuva.

A book club edition was issued by Del Rey in conjunction with the Science Fiction Book Club in June 1989. An ebook edition was issued by Open Road Integrated Media in March 2011. The novel has also been translated into French. The novel won the 1989 Locus Poll Award for Best Horror Novel. Plot summary The 20th century is just under way, and somebody is killing the vampires of London. Against the wishes of his fellow undead, Simon Ysidro, oldest of the London vampires, seeks the assistance of Oxford professor James Asher, former spy for the British government. Ysidro gains Asher's cooperation by threatening the life of his beautiful young wife, Lydia. Unbeknownst to Ysidro, Asher enlists the help of his wife, a physician with a keenly analytical mind. Asher prowls the streets and crypts of London with Ysidro, entering the dark underworld of the undead, as Lydia combs property records and medical journals for clues as to who might have the means and the motive to carry out the slaughter. Asher's theory is that the killer must be a vampire himself, one able to remain awake and active in the daytime. Lydia develops a theory as to how such a vampire might come to be. Together Asher and Ysidro travel to Paris to seek out the mythical eldest of all vampires, who might be either the killer himself, or the key to the killer's undoing. What they discover is a threat to the living as well as the undead.

She was born Florence Mary Wilson, but adopted the professional surname Austral in 1921 in honour of her homeland of Australia.As was the case with Elsie Mary Fischer, who took the name Elsa Stralia ; also, Helen Porter Mitchell took the name Nellie Melba (after Melbourne), and June Mary Gough took the name June Bronhill (after Broken Hill). She was considered to have few equals in sheer vocal quality until the arrival of Kirsten Flagstad. Acting was not her strong point and her characterisations were mainly achieved with the voice, which made her recordings so vastly enjoyable. She, Germaine Lubin and Frida Leider were considered to be the great Wagnerian dramatic sopranos of their era, together with Flagstad, who did not rise to international fame until the 1930s. (Among all post-War Wagnerian sopranos, only Birgit Nilsson and, to a lesser extent, Astrid Varnay, have been in their exalted league.) Early life Florence Mary Wilson was born in Richmond, Victoria on 26 April 1892. She was the daughter of a Swedish carpenter who had changed his name from Wilhelm Lindholm to William Wilson, and the dressmaker Helena Mary, n√©e Harris. Her father died in 1895 and her mother set up in business. In 1903, Florence's mother married again, to a 28-year-old Syrian book-keeper named John Fawaz, and Florence took the name Florence Fawaz. Career She was discovered by the choirmaster Rev. Edward Sugden at the Wesleyan Methodist Church in Palmerston Street, Carlton, Melbourne (now Church of All Nations). In 1914, she won first prizes in both the soprano and mezzo-soprano categories at a singing contest in Ballarat, obtaining a scholarship which enabled her to continue her studies with Elise Wiedermann. She went to New York in 1919 to study further with Gabriele Sibella. Her voice impressed influential listeners and she was offered a contract to sing at the Metropolitan Opera; but she declined the Met offer to gain stage experience in England, and never again had a chance to sing with the New York company. Austral duly went to London where she was promoted by the leading British bass of the day, Robert Radford. She made her Covent Garden debut on 16 May 1922 as Br√ºnnhilde in Wagner's Die Walk√ºre, and later in the same role in Siegfried. She shared this role with Frida Leider, who received greater acclaim due to her superior acting skills. Austral's other roles at Covent Garden included Isolde and the title role in Verdi's Aida. In 1923, Austral appeared with Dame Nellie Melba, who called her, \\"One of the wonder voices of the world\\", praising the purity of her tone and the gleaming power of her high notes. Unfortunately for her career, due to prevailing circumstances and the reputed antipathy of conductor Bruno Walter, she ended up singing more with the British National Opera Company than at Covent Garden in the 1920s. During the mid-1920s she made the first of more than 100 recordings for HMV, which are still treasured by music-lovers and collectors. The famous recording engineer and producer at HMV, Fred Gaisberg, said: \\"In the early twenties Florence Austral was the most important recording artist we had, thanks to the beauty, power and compass of her voice\\". She recorded operatic arias as well as songs, sacred music and oratorio extracts. She can be heard, too, in superb duets opposite Feodor Chaliapin, Miguel Fleta, Tudor Davies and Walter Widdop that employ both the acoustic and electrical recording processes. (Her acoustic recordings for HMV include the pioneering, English-language series of excerpts from The Ring Cycle.) In 1925, Austral became the second wife of the Australian flautist John Amadio, and they toured widely together in America, Europe and Australia. She often sang in the Ring operas in Philadelphia, and in concert under the conductor Fritz Reiner. However, she never appeared at Bayreuth, or at the Vienna State Opera. She was negotiating to sing in Vienna, but this did not eventuate. Austral, however, did become a principal singer with the esteemed Berlin State Opera in 1930. It was there in that same year that she showed the first signs of multiple sclerosis, which manifested themselves on stage during a performance of Die Walk√ºre opposite bass-baritone Friedrich Schorr. Her opera career gradually suffered as a result of the advance of this debilitating disease, but she was still able to devote herself to concert and recital work, developing a large lieder repertoire, although she also sang operatic pieces. Her appearances in opera during this time included ones in her home country, Australia, where she toured with tenor Walter Widdop in 1934‚Äì35, singing the Australian premiere of Les p√™cheurs de perles. She returned to Britain in 1939, and appeared in many benefit concerts during the early part of World War II, before her illness forced her to retire in 1940. In 1946 she returned to Australia. Many of her possessions were lost in a fire. Royalty earnings from her recordings had declined, too, and she found herself in need of an income, so she taught singing at the Newcastle Conservatorium (now part of the University of Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia) from 1954 until her retirement in 1959. Death Austral gave a few newspaper interviews in her retirement. She died of cerebrovascular disease in a church home for the aged at Mayfield, Newcastle, on 15 May 1968. By general critical consent, she remains the finest dramatic soprano ever produced by Australia, as her various recordings, now available on CD reissues, readily attest. Tributes :The Waters of the Rhine seem to mount high, and over all rides the triumphant voice of Florence Austral as Brunnhilde. Her singing can justly be called queenly. Even after hearing the glorious singing of Frida Leider on other records, Austral's triumphant voice remains in the mind. ::::Neville Cardus, Manchester Guardian, 1928. :\\"In the early twenties Florence Austral was the most important recording artist we had, thanks to the beauty, power and compass of her voice.\\" -- Fred Gaisberg, HMV (later EMI) References *Elphinstone, Michael and Wayne Hancock, When Austral Sang: the Biography of Florence Austral, Hyde Park Press, Richmond, South Australia, 2005, 655pp. External links *Florence Austral Collection at the National Film and Sound Archive, includes sound recordings, photographs, programs, recording notes, scripts etc. * Florence Austral Collection in the Performing Arts Collection, the Arts Centre, Melbourne (news clippings, photographs, programmes etc.) * Listen to the Last Rose of Summer at the National Film and Sound Archive 1892 births 1968 deaths Musicians from Melbourne Australian operatic sopranos 20th-century Australian singers 20th-century opera singers 20th-century women opera singers 19th-century Australian women 20th-century Australian women ","title":"Florence Austral"},{"id":"9532685","text":"Mehmed Abdulaziz or Abdulaziz Mehmed (26 September 1901 ‚Äì 19 January 1977) was the 40th head of the Ottoman dynasty from 1973 to 1977.

The novella focuses on the life of young Montanan David Hayden, his family and the fictional town of Bentrock, Montana, and focuses on the struggles of a family torn between loyalty and justice. It was awarded the Milkweed National Fiction Prize.  Plot  When David's Native American housekeeper Marie Little Soldier falls ill, Frank Hayden, the local doctor and David's uncle, is called. Marie detests the use of a doctor and insists upon seeing another doctor that she is more familiar with. Marie is further reluctant to receive medical treatment from Frank Hayden and calls for Gail, David's mother, to be in the room with her during her checkup. After she has received medical attention and is prescribed medication, Gail questions Marie and discovers that Frank has a history of abusing his medical status to prey upon the local Native American women, forcing them to commit otherwise unnecessary acts. David's father, Wesley, is the local sheriff and begins to investigate these allegations against his brother, but is in a difficult situation between his loyalty to his family and his obligation to justice. When Marie is found dead after making significant recovery before, Frank convinces the family that the cause of death was pneumonia. When David admits to seeing his uncle leave the residence hours before his babysitters death, Wesley later confronts Frank about his actions at a family dinner at their parents' house and they reach a compromise, where Wes agrees to forget the whole incident. David, who was playing with his grandfather's pistol, once contemplates shooting Frank because of all the troubles he has given their family. Eventually, David decides to tell his parents the truth - that he had witnessed Frank leaving their house around the same time Marie had died, implying that Frank had something to do with her death. Wesley eventually arrests Frank, who confesses to killing Marie and molesting Indian women, and holds him captive in the basement, in order to avoid the embarrassment Frank would experience by going to the local jail. Wesley and Frank's controlling and racist father Julian is strongly opposed to Frank's arrest and sends men to break Frank free when Wesley is not home. Gail manages to scare them away by firing warning shots into the air, while David calls for help. Gail later pleads for Wes to take Frank out of their home. Wesley's moral values override his family loyalty and he agrees to take his brother to the local jail the next day, but later that night the family wakes to the sound of jars breaking in the basement. In the morning, Wesley finds that Frank committed suicide by slitting his wrists with the broken glass. Soon after, David's family moves out of Bentrock, ending the fight between Wesley and Julian Hayden.

It was marketed as the first game to feature support for the Jaguar's ProController, though the only difference that the controller provides is that its shoulder buttons can be used as an alternative way of nudging the table.Ruiner Pinball game manual (Atari Jaguar, US) In Ruiner Pinball, players can choose between any of the two available playfields, which both have their own thematic and self-contained story. The game originated as a project pitched by High Voltage Software to Atari Corporation, who wanted to create a pinball title for the Jaguar, as members within the company were fans of the genre. Ruiner Pinball garnered mostly negative reception from critics since its release but it has been recently referred by publications like PC Magazine as one of the best titles for the system.  Gameplay  Ruiner Pinball is an arcade-style pinball game, featuring two types of pinball tables and each one has their own main objective, gameplay mechanics, plot and thematic. The game has three levels of difficulty and the player can set the number of balls for play, turn on or off the picture-in-picture display window, apply texture to the ball and enter the number of players at the options menu. High-scores and other settings made by the player are automatically kept via the cartridge's internal EEPROM. The player can also reset the internal memory of the cartridge to erase saved high-scores and personal settings.  Tables  Ruiner is a two-screen wide table that features a four sets of flippers, taking place during the Cold War in 1962 as a nuclear war is about to begin. The main objective of the player is to bring down the DEFCON level from level 5 to 1 and launch the attack on an enemy country while defending his own. Tower is a three-screen tall table, featuring three sets of flippers and takes place in a fantasy setting, when an adventurer enters into a sinister castle tower to defeat an evil sorceress that resides within its walls, with the main objective of the player being able to make the sorceress cast three magic spells in order to destroy the castle tower, bring her down and then escape from the tower before it is too late.  Development and release  Assembly, Ruiner Pinball is one of the few titles written in a different programming language. Scott Corley, main programmer and one of the designers of Ruiner Pinball at High Voltage Software, recounted about the game's development process in a thread at the 3DO Zone forums. The company pitched the idea of a pinball project for the Jaguar to Atari Corporation by showcasing a working demo that was written in a few days by Scott, who got free rein to create it from High Voltage Software CEO Kerry J. Ganofsky, since many of the members within the company were fans of pinball and liked the idea of developing one, with Scott citing both Night Mission Pinball and Raster Blaster as his childhood favorites. After Atari Corp. greenlighted the idea upon seeing the demo, work on the project begun and at one point during its development, the company requested the project's name in order to advertise it. When looking at his personal music collection, Scott christened the project as Ruiner, which was named after the song of the same name featured in Nine Inch Nails' second studio album The Downward Spiral and as a result, he told Kerry Ganofsky about the name and the latter proceeded to send it to Atari Corp. The project was one of his first works in the video game industry. Originally, the game was set to have only one board to play but Atari Corp. requested to have two boards instead. Ruiner Pinball was showcased under its original name in an early but playable state during SCES '94, featuring vastly different board designs compared to the final release. Scott also recounted that all the game boards and their respective artwork were hand-drawn and painted on \\"a huge board\\" by Mike Baker, who also worked as a designer for the title. They were scanned, pieced together and corrected in Deluxe Paint. He stated that the process was a difficult task \\"because there was no scanner that large\\" at the time. Ruiner Pinball was also showcased in a near-complete playable state at both E3 1995 and at Spring ECTS '95. In an interview with Adisak Pochanayon, lead programmer of NBA Jam: Tournament Edition as well for being one of the programmers of White Men Can't Jump on the Jaguar, stated that Ruiner Pinball was written in C++ by Scott. The game was also showcased during the Fun 'n' Games Day event hosted by Atari.  Reception  The game received mostly poor reviews. A review by Next Generation gave it only two stars out of five, explaining that the game does not play well due to \\"rigid\\" animation and unrealistic, unpredictable physics. They added that the game makes good use of the video game format with its multi-tiered tables and animated targets, but that these elements are \\"superfluous\\" without good playability. GamePro's brief review described the game as enjoyable but unexceptional, saying that it \\"looks like a plain old 16-bit pinball game\\" and offers nothing unusual in its pinball action aside from the unusually large tables. The Electric Playground gave Ruiner Pinball a four out of ten, calling it \\"the Latoya Jackson of video pinball games\\". They elaborated that the gameplay is \\"boring and tedious\\" and that the blurry and overly busy visuals cause the ball to be frequently lost against the backgrounds. VideoGames scored Ruiner Pinball a five out of ten, comparing it with other pinball video games from the 16-bit era such as Dragon's Revenge and Cr√ºe Ball. The reviewer criticized the graphics and plot of the two tables, while also remarking that the game does not simulate the feel of playing pinball accurately. Ultimate Future Games also gave the game a low score, with the reviewer criticizing almost every aspect of the game. He remarked that \\"Ruiner is not even not very good pinball\\". However, when reviewing the game for French magazine Consoles +, Elvira gave it a positive outlook with praise to the graphics, presentation, music and playability.

Exile After the formation of the Republic of Turkey in 1923 and the abolition of the Ottoman Sultanate and the Caliphate in the following year, Vasib and other members of his family were forced into exile. Renaming of Constantinople to Istanbul, 1930. Accessed 20 July 2012. They left Istanbul from Sirkeci railway station. Vasib lived in Budapest for a few months, before settling in Nice, France. Other family members moved to the South of France and to Italy, including Vahideddin, (Mehmed VI) who went to San Remo; and Abdulmecid, (Vasib's cousin and the last Caliph) to Nice, after a short time in Switzerland. French passports The travel documents issued by the Turkish Republic to the members of the House of Osman on their exile were valid for only one year. Vasib intervened with the French government to obtain passports for them. Vasib made contact with the French minister, Count Castellane through General Toulouse and his son, Captain Toulouse, who was a friend. The French passports listed the family as having Ottoman nationality and acknowledged their imperial titles. Alexandria In January 1935, Vasib moved to Alexandria, Egypt with his wife and her family. For the next 18 years, Vasib was the Director of the Antoniadis Palace, which served to accommodate foreign heads of state and dignitaries visiting Alexandria. Later years Vasib was permitted to return to Turkey in 1974. From that time, he visited annually and his wife lived in a humble rented flat in the old part of the city near Sultan Ahmed Square.

Written by Gregg Allman, the five-minute studio version first appeared on their 1969 debut album The Allman Brothers Band. The song was regularly played live and was the basis for much longer and more intense performances. p. 15. This was captured in the Allman Brothers' 1971 double live album At Fillmore East, where a 23-minute rendition of the song takes up the entire final side. p. 131. It was this recording that garnered \\"Whipping Post\\" spots on both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll list and Rolling Stones list of \\"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\". Composition and studio version Gregg Allman was 21 years old when the song was first recorded. Its writing dates back to late March 1969, when The Allman Brothers Band was first formed. Gregg had failed to make a name for himself as a musician during a late-1960s stint in Los Angeles, and was on the verge of quitting music altogether when his brother Duane Allman called and said his new band needed a vocalist. Gregg showed the band 22 songs he had written, but only \\"Dreams\\" and \\"It's Not My Cross to Bear\\" were deemed usable. p. 108. Gregg, the group's only songwriter at the time, was commissioned to create additional songs that would fit into the context of the new band, and in the next five days he wrote several, including \\"Whipping Post\\". Gregg's travails in the music business would provide the thematic inspiration for the new song, which was written quickly on an ironing board cover: He later said: \\"It came so fast. I didn't even have a chance to get the paper out. That's the way the good songs come‚Äîthey just hit you like a ton of bricks.\\"Poe, Skydog, pp. 124‚Äì125. The blues rock song's lyrics center on a metaphorical whipping post, an evil woman and futile existential sorrow. Writer Jean-Charles Costa described the studio version's musical structure as a \\"solid framework of [a] song that lends itself to thousands of possibilities in terms of solo expansion. ... [It is] in modified , building to a series of shrieking lead guitar statements, and reaching full strength in the chorus supported by super dual-lead guitar.\\" The result was called by Rolling Stone an \\"enduring anthem ... rife with tormented blues-ballad imagery\\". Musically, the composition was immediately noticeable for its use of an time signature in the introduction. (It is also sometimes described as , p. 51. and band drummer Butch Trucks called it simply \\"a lick in 11\\" or \\"elevens\\".) As Gregg Allman later said: > I didn't know the intro was in time. I just saw it as three sets of three, > and then two to jump on the next three sets with: it was like > 1,2,3‚Äî1,2,3‚Äî1,2,3‚Äî1,2. I didn't count it as 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. It was > one beat short, but it didn't feel one short, because to get back to the > triad, you had two steps to go up. You'd really hit those two hard, to > accent them, so that would separate the threes. ... [Duane] said, \\"That's > good man, I didn't know that you understood .\\" Of course I said something > intelligent like, \\"What's ?\\" Duane just said, \\"Okay, dumbass, I'll try to > draw it up on paper for you.\\" The original \\"Whipping Post\\" was recorded for The Allman Brothers Band album on August 7, 1969, at Atlantic Recording Studios in New York City. Adrian Barber was the producer, and the band spent the entire full-day session getting the song's performance to their liking. The album was released on November 4, 1969, but sold poorly, barely reaching the bottom rungs of the U.S. albums chart. \\"Whipping Post\\" was placed last on the album's running order, in what writer Randy Poe described as \\"the classic tradition of leaving the listener wanting more\\".Poe, Skydog, pp. 131‚Äì132. Impact Despite its length, the live \\"Whipping Post\\" received considerable progressive rock radio airplay during the early 1970s, especially late at night or on weekends. Perhaps even because of its length, as especially long songs were popular as a means of allowing a DJ time to use the bathroom.All good DJs know the value of the 'toilet track' Such airplay led to \\"Whipping Post\\" becoming one of the band's more familiar and popular songs, and would help give At Fillmore East its reputation as having, as The Rolling Stone Record Guide wrote in 1979, \\"no wasted notes, no pointless jams, no half-realized vocals‚Äîeverything counts\\", p. 6. and of being, as Rolling Stone wrote in 2002, \\"the finest live rock performance ever committed to vinyl.\\" VH1 would say that \\"Whipping Post\\" was \\"what the band would become famous for, an endless climb of heightening drama staked out by the twin-guitar exorcisms of Duane and Dickey Betts and the cool, measured, almost jazz-like response of the rhythm section.\\" The song also acquired a quasi-legendary role in early 1970s rock concerts, when audience members at other artists' concerts would semi-jokingly yell out \\"Whipping Post!\\" as a request between numbers, echoing the fan captured on At Fillmore East. p. 132, 133. Jackson Browne took note of this occurring during his concerts of the time. Another such instance from 1974 in Helsinki affected rock guitarist and composer Frank Zappa, as described below. Later this same yell-out-at-a-concert \\"role\\" would be taken over to a far greater extent by Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"Free Bird\\", although the \\"Whipping Post\\" tradition made something of a later comeback at indie rock shows. p. 89. With the advent of album oriented rock radio formats in the 1980s and later, \\"Whipping Post\\" became less visible in the rock consciousness, but upon the reformation of the Allmans in 1989 and their perennial touring it held a regular slot in the group's concert set list rotation. Musicians continued to study it: Hal Leonard Corporation published a multi-volume sheet music book of the Allman Brothers' work in 1995, and it took 42 pages to transcribe all the guitar solos in the At Fillmore East rendition of the song.Poe, Skydog, pp. 183‚Äì184. \\"Whipping Post\\" has also made an impression on writers and been frequently referred to in literature. Ron Rash's 2006 novel The World Made Straight features a character listening to the opening bass line of the song at so loud and close a volume that the speakers shake. p. 238. Douglas Palermo's 2004 Learning to Live imagines future aliens exploring a desolate Earth and discovering the At Fillmore East recording; the aliens study it and eventually succumb to an overdose of emotion, p. 157. Tim McCleaf's 2004 novella For They Know Not What They Do uses the song as a metaphor for suffering, p. 46. while Mary Kay Andrews' novel Little Bitty Lies refers to the song as an example of \\"soul-scorching blues\\". p. 292. In non-fiction, John C. Leggett and Suzanne Malm's 1995 work The Eighteen Stages of Love uses \\"Whipping Post\\" as a metaphor for a romantic relationship in which the participants masochistically stay in though it has gone bad. pp. 14, 47. In comedic context, the song was featured in the 2008 My Name Is Earl television series episode \\"Joy in a Bubble\\", in which Joy gets sick and Earl has to perform all of her regular duties. The Fillmore recording appears in 2018 movie A Star is Born. Other Allmans versions Live versions of \\"Whipping Post\\" surfaced on other, later Allman Brothers Band albums, although none approached At Fillmore East in sales, airplay, or influence. The Allmans closed Fillmore East on June 27, 1971 with a concert broadcast over many radio stations; that rendition of the song was in 2006 incorporated into a Deluxe Edition extra CD of the Eat a Peach album, although the Allmans' into-the-early morning performance the night before, which also included \\"Whipping Post\\", is considered more memorable. Earlier 1970 renditions of \\"Whipping Post\\" have subsequently been released, such as an 8-minute run on Fillmore East, February 1970 and a 14-minute effort on Live at the Atlanta International Pop Festival: July 3 & 5, 1970. Some additional website-only Allmans archival releases, such as Boston Common, 8/17/71, also capture \\"Whipping Post\\" takes from the original band. The archival release Macon City Auditorium: 2/11/72 features a \\"Whipping Post\\" from the five-man-band period following Duane Allman's death. Keyboardist Chuck Leavell was then added to the band, and for a very brief period in late 1972 was there while Berry Oakley was still on bass. A November 2, 1972 performance of \\"Whipping Post\\" from Hofstra University was shown on the national late-night ABC In Concert show, introducing television audiences to both the band and song for the first time. Briefer than usual, and with Leavell taking an electric piano solo in the first slot, Betts still led the band through some of the tempo changes and emotional currents of the song. At the end, Gregg Allman changed the lyric to \\"... That I feel, that there just ain't no such thing as dying.\\" But within days, Berry Oakley too would be gone. After the Allmans broke up and re-formed in 1989, \\"Whipping Post\\" was carried forward by various personnel configurations. A 2003 Beacon Theatre performance showed up the following year on the live album One Way Out, and features the Warren Haynes/Derek Trucks era of the band. Gregg Allman himself performed \\"Whipping Post\\" with his outside-the-Allmans Gregg Allman and Friends group's concerts, but in a style that he described as \\"its funky, real rhythm n‚Äô blues-like\\" and in which he played guitar rather than organ.Mike Greenhaus, \\"Gregg Allman: Friends and Brothers\\", Jambands.com, October 23, 2006. Accessed May 29, 2007. Allman re-recorded the song for his 1997 album Searching for Simplicity, giving the song a jazzier groove, but rendering it in straight 4/4 time instead of the complex triple time of the original composition. Other artists In a 1974 concert in Helsinki, Finland, an audience member repeatedly disrupted a Frank Zappa performance by shouting a request for \\"Whipping Post.\\" Zappa responded by playing a version of his song \\"Montana\\", p. 87. where he altered the lyrics with references to whipping posts. (This incident was eventually captured on his You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 2 live album, released in 1988.) In 1981, Zappa's band learned \\"Whipping Post\\" and added it to their repertoire, since the band's new singer and keyboard player Bobby Martin knew the song and sang the lead vocals on it. p. 287 Zappa released a version of the song on the 1984 album Them or Us; a live recording of the song featuring Frank's son Dweezil Zappa on lead guitar was released in 1986 on the Does Humor Belong in Music? album, while a different version appeared in the associated video. Zappa also included a live solo from this song on Guitar with the title \\"For Duane\\". In the released versions, Bobby Martin also used the closing line \\"there just ain't no such thing as dyin'\\" that Allman had sung on ABC In Concert. Rock cult figure Genya Ravan produced the best-known recording by a female singer, with a screaming take on her 1974 album Goldie Zelkowitz, which was subsequently sampled in Jay-Z's \\"Oh My God\\" from his 2006 album Kingdom Come. Portions of the Jay-Z sample appeared as the soundtrack for feature advertisements for the 2013 film Gangster Squad. Perhaps the most-heard rendition of \\"Whipping Post\\" by any other artist came in 2005, during Season 4 of the then-top-rated television competition show American Idol, when it was performed by contestant Bo Bice whose effort on it pleased Randy Jackson, a fan of Southern rock, and the other show judges. Bice eventually finished in second place, with his performance of \\"Whipping Post\\" and his stage presence credited for gaining him voting support amongst viewers.

The substance of the resolution can be anything that can normally be proposed as a motion. This type of resolution is often used to express the body's approval or disapproval of something that they cannot otherwise vote on, due to the matter being handled by another jurisdiction, or being protected by a constitution. An example would be a resolution of support for a nation's troops in battle, which carries no legal weight, but is adopted for moral support. Use Non-binding resolutions are usually specific simple or concurrent resolutions that are not passed on to the executive branch to be signed into the law. These resolutions differ from pure concurrent resolutions (that are used for various procedural requests such as adjourning sessions) in that they are designed to express formally, document opinions and not initiate a process. These resolutions offer a means for elected officials to publicly air the concerns of their constituents and are closely followed by major media outlets. Additionally, these resolutions can be used to state the position of the legislature, showing a preview of how they will vote on future legislation and budget allocations.

Bora is in love with the younger Tisa (Gordana Jovanoviƒá), who is being offered in marriage by her step-father. The two get themselves in trouble and eventually have to flee. Tisa rejects her husband and she and Bora get married in the church. Tisa tries to get to Belgrade, while Bora stabs a man in a knife fight.

He played in Major League Baseball for the San Diego Padres, Montreal Expos, Texas Rangers, and Cincinnati Reds. Welsh spent his final season as an active player with the Reds and later became a sportscaster for the team. Early life Welsh was born in Wilmington, Delaware. His family later moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, near Moeller High School, where he grew up with three sisters. Welsh graduated from St. Xavier High School in 1973. He began his collegiate baseball career at the University of South Florida under coach Jack Butterfield, and later played a role in selecting former Major League Baseball pitcher Robin Roberts as the South Florida Bulls baseball coach. Welsh played his final collegiate baseball season under Roberts. In 1976, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Yarmouth Red Sox. Playing career Chris Welsh was first drafted by the New York Yankees in the 24th round of the 1976 amateur draft; however, he did not sign. In 1977, he was drafted again by the Yankees in the 21st round. He then went on to play for former Yankees Class AAA organization, the Columbus Clippers. On March 31, 1981, Welsh was involved in a six-player trade with Ruppert Jones, Joe Lefebvre, and Tim Lollar to the San Diego Padres for Jerry Mumphrey and John Pacella. In his rookie season with the Padres in 1981, Welsh pitched 123.7 innings while compiling a 6-7 record and a 3.78 ERA. He pitched four complete games‚Äîtwo of which were shutouts. After two years with the Padres, he was purchased by the Montreal Expos. He was then traded on November 7, 1984 to the Texas Rangers for Dave Hostetler. With the Rangers, he posted a 2‚Äì5 record with an ERA of 4.13. On April 4, 1986, Welsh signed as a free agent with the Cincinnati Reds, and he was released by the team at the conclusion of the season on November 12. Welsh was known for an unusual pitching delivery in which he would \\"straight-arm\\" the ball; he extended his left arm and pitched the ball sidearm with the arm almost completely straight and little to no bending of his elbow. Broadcasting career Welsh has been the Fox Sports Net Ohio TV color analyst for the Cincinnati Reds since 1993, teaming with long-time sportscaster George Grande until Grande's retirement in 2009 to form the longest-running TV broadcasting partnership in team history. During broadcasts, he commonly jokes about his playing career being nothing more than mediocre. Also, he is known as \\"The Crafty Left-Hander\\" because of his unconventional throwing motion. His current broadcast partner is Thom Brennaman, though as of August 19, 2020, Brennaman has been indefinitely suspended from broadcasting due to his on-air slur referencing gays. Welsh occasionally works with Jeff Brantley and Jim Day. On May 4, 2018, Welsh coined the phrase \\"Pac-Man Ball\\" to describe a high and inside fastball thrown by Cincinnati Reds pitcher Sal Romano to Lewis Brinson of the Miami Marlins. Welsh compared the movement of the pitch to the Namco video game character, Pac-Man, as it \\"ate up Brinson's fingers\\" in a way reminiscent of the video- game character.

Anna Nicole Smith is featured as herself. Directed and produced by Lee Friedlander, the screenplay was written by Celia Fox, who also executive produced. Wasabi Tuna premiered on August 20, 2003. It was issued on DVD on October 28, 2005, by Indican Pictures.  Plot  This camp screwball comedy of errors, that includes many over-the-top stereotypes, is set at Halloween against the backdrop of West Hollywood, California. Five friends, interior designer Evan (played by London); interior designer Harvey (played by Cheng); African American stockbroker Dave (played by Meadows); Latino spinning instructor Fredrico (played by Sab√†to); and Emme (played by Ubach), a sassy young woman obsessed with style and classic movies, have all been anticipating the West Hollywood Halloween Parade on Santa Monica Boulevard, which is the biggest and brashest block party of the year. Their annual tradition of joining the festivities in outrageous costumes has become part of local legend. It is the night before Halloween, however, and they still have not decided what to be. Evan and Harvey, who are femme gay boyfriends and business partners, have come up with food-themed sushi costumes that everyone refers to as \\"wasabi tuna.\\" Emme offers another suggestion -- that they all dress up as gang members. They all opt for the gang theme, but are unable to find the appropriate attire at the local stores. They then decide to seek out real life gang members in order to achieve the authentic, straight-from-the-hood look they want. While doing interior design work for an extremely wealthy Armenian woman who is actually in the illegal drug trade, Harvey and Evan become unwitting drug couriers. After they are arrested, there is a comic scene at the WeHo sheriff's station with them attempting to talk their way out of trouble. Dave goes to East L.A., where he comes across a real gang member named Romeo (played by D√≠az). He makes a deal with Romeo to loan him his Porsche in exchange for his lowrider gang car. A case of mistaken identity makes a vengeful, rival gang get after them. There is a comic drive-by shooting scene. Also, by driving Romeo's lowrider they are unknowingly carrying an illegal cache of weapons. Reality TV actress Anna Nicole Smith's (appearing as herself) pet dog, Sugar-Pie, is kidnapped. All is havoc, as a group of drag queens who dress like Smith, Santa Ana Anna (played by Arquette), Eenie Anna (played by Gil, who is a dwarf), Brown Sugar Anna and Hot Spicy Anna, believe that Harvey stole their idol's dog and band together to get Sugar-Pie back for Smith. A wild chase ensues as gang members, drug dealers, drag queens, and the police force are after the partygoers. They end up in Chinatown, where an old Chinese man, Mr. Ling (also played by Cheng), is in partnership with the Armenian drug shrew. Everything culminates with the clash of personalities colliding in a feisty showdown. A free-for-all street fight, involving the gang members, drug dealers, undercover DEA detectives, a trio of female martial arts gymnasts and the Santa Ana Annas, erupts and everyone battles it out with flying fists, feet and wigs. Anna Nicole Smith herself arrives and saves the day. As she shamelessly mocks herself, Smith clears up the Sugar-Pie mess, hands the drugs over to the police and invites the group to her Halloween party, where they change into their \\"wasabi tuna\\" costumes.

According to his creator, Lupin is the grandson of Maurice Leblanc's gentleman thief Ars√®ne Lupin. Acknowledged across the globe as the world's number one thief, Lupin is a master of disguise and deduction, marksman, and inventor of numerous handy gadgets. His fun-loving, foolhardy incongruity covers a brilliant mind always extemporizing and re-evaluating. As such, he has been responsible for heists no right-minded individual would believe possible. While occasionally arrested and jailed, typically by his ICPO nemesis Inspector Koichi Zenigata, he always succeeds in escaping unharmed. The original manga differs significantly compared to the family-friendly anime incarnations through its explicit depictions of sex and violence, with Lupin's character also differing as a result. Additionally, he and his famous gang, beautiful Fujiko Mine, cool triggerman Daisuke Jigen and samurai Goemon Ishikawa XIII, rarely work together in the manga version, but are nonetheless an inseparable team in various anime productions. Creation The aim of the Lupin III series was to produce a comedy adventure series that reflected the traits of Leblanc's Ars√®ne Lupin character. Originally the intention was to keep the blood ties between the two fictional characters secret, however Monkey Punch was convinced by others not to do so. He combined elements of Ars√®ne Lupin with James Bond to develop the character of Lupin III and made him a \\"carefree fellow\\". In the original manga, Lupin and his team typically work individually for their own goals. The author explained it is only in the anime that they frequently operate together, suspecting some unwritten rule that all five main characters have to appear in every episode. He believed that Lupin and Fujiko are similar to the characters of D'Artagnan and Milady de Winter, and described them as \\"Not necessarily lovers, not necessarily husband and wife, but more just having fun as man and woman with each other\\". Inspector Zenigata was conceived as Lupin's archrival to create a \\"human Tom and Jerry\\". Monkey Punch said the appeal of drawing Lupin comes from the character being able to go anywhere without obstacles and being able to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants. However, this is contrasted by the appeal of Zenigata's strict personality. The creator has said that he believes the Lupin III story can never end but that if he had to, both Zenigata and Lupin would have to end as equals. They would either both fail, both win or both get very old. In typical anime style, Lupin's appearance is racially ambiguous and tends to oblique his origins. He has black hair plastered flat with what is either a widow's peak or a V-shaped bang. His trademark sideburns extend from ear to nearly the chin. Outside his preference for large and rather plain boots, Lupin is a sharp dresser. He typically wears a button-down shirt, tie, chinos and a brightly colored sports jacket‚Äîexclusively red in the manga, while in animation his jackets are various colors which color-code his TV series (green for Part I, a few OVAs and The Woman Called Fujiko Mine; red for Part II and most films and television specials; pink for Part III; blue for Part IV and Part 5). In some images, Lupin is depicted as being cross- eyed; however, this may be a comic flourish by the artist(s) rather than a physical characteristic. Personality In Monkey Punch's original manga, Lupin is cocky, quite crude, and for the most part remorseless. He is very much the ladies' man, often using them for his own gains, but is not beyond forcing himself upon women who resist him. Mike Toole of Anime News Network referred to the character as a \\"rough, drunken, lecherous crook.\\" This is in stark contrast to his better-known anime self, who although a skilled thief, occasionally comes off as a chivalrous goofball who enjoys helping those less fortunate than he. Furthermore, Lupin often takes it upon himself and his gang to stop criminals engaged in more violent crimes and leave them for Zenigata to arrest. In the anime, while he fancies himself a Casanova, his actual success with women is erratic, appearing to fluctuate with the writer. Even though his gang's loyalty has been an issue, with Fujiko willing to betray and cohort Goemon promising to eventually kill him, Lupin will still drop everything to come to their aid in a helpless moment; further the team would rather face torture than to betray Lupin (or he betray them) to a third party. This rule of loyalty curiously extends as well to Inspector Zenigata, whom Lupin considers a respected friend and opposition. The Inspector reciprocates this regard and out of gratitude has vowed never to attempt to kill Lupin. Lupin's vendetta against the Tarantula Gang in In Memory of the Walther P-38 was partly settling of past betrayal and mostly vengeful payback for their shooting and nearly killing Zenigata. It seems Lupin loves to steal more than actually having the treasure he sought. Lupin relishes more in the challenge of stealing and, as long as he succeeds in the heist, is usually not that upset when he ends up empty-handed; there have been times he has lost the object or intentionally thrown it away. There have also been times when Lupin stole an object only to give it to someone else, such as if it rightfully belonged to them or they needed it more than he did. When not involved in criminal activities, Lupin usually spends his time dating beautiful girls, fishing, race car driving, attending formal dinners, playing pool, casino gambling, and participating in caf√© society. His favorite foods seem to be mostly French cuisine, sushi, and seafood; when on a job he may settle with ramen noodles. In Lupin the Third Part 5, he is shown with an affection for galettes. He also smokes cigarettes and occasionally cigars and kreteks; in the manga, he's seen smoking a briar pipe. His preferred cigarette is the famous French brand Gitanes. Lupin is a celebrated race car driver, competing in several international events when time allows. He's also a skilled sleight of hand artist who loves to befuddle his opponents with various gimmicks: i.e., a cigarette which explodes into confetti, a gun with a spring-loaded boxing glove that clobbers the shooter, and bubble gum that becomes plastique after brief chewing. Skills Lupin as seen in Episode 0: The First Contact Physically, Lupin is a man of average strength, but he can throw a surprisingly good punch. He is incredibly flexible and fast, and his manual dexterity is cat-like in precision and quickness. His talent in the art of disguise borders on the superhuman, with him able to flawlessly impersonate any man or woman in face, voice and costume after minimal observation. This skill is so complete that he can even fool close friends and family members of the subject. His skinny body enables him to easily impersonate larger individuals by use of oversized outfits, with attack paraphernalia usually making up the disguise's bulk. His favorite disguise has always been that of Inspector Zenigata, which incenses his adversary to no end. Lupin possesses an encyclopedic knowledge of various topics, such as history, the different sciences, fluency in multiple languages, etc. He shows amazing intuition and quick awareness of his surroundings. Lupin favors the long outdated Walther P38 as his principal firearm. He is shown to be an excellent marksman, having on at least one occasion fired directly into the barrel of another gun, although not quite on a par with Jigen. Despite the criminal nature of his activities, Lupin has a strict code that he follows in order to not taint his reputation. Lupin dislikes killing and takes care to use non lethal means to achieve his goals. When Lupin believes he has an illness causing him to become a compulsive killer he asks Jigen to kill him to save the lives of any potential victims. While killing is against his nature, he is willing to fire upon any enemy who threatens his friends or allies. Lupin is a talented driver, motorcyclist and pilot. His favorite automobiles seem to be either the Mercedes-Benz SSK or a souped up 1965 Fiat 500, most famously seen in Castle of Cagliostro. In the case of the SSK, one of the rarest cars in the world, one problem or another seems to cause the car's destruction in virtually every episode it's featured. Lupin either has several SSK models in possession, owns a selection of counterfeit models, or is talented to the extreme at auto repair and reconstruction. Lupin is a formidable escape artist, capable of cracking any safe or escaping from shackles in moments. He can even use his restraints to entrap his would-be captor before making his departure. Seemingly prepared for all contingencies, he can break free of confinement even when surrounded. In spite of his facade of reckless childlike antics, i.e., taunts, silly faces, and leaving notes of his next caper, Lupin's brilliance for tactics and originality belies any underestimations his behavior may have implied. In the Lupin III vs Detective Conan special, not only did he figure out Conan was far more intelligent than he appeared, but had also discerned his identity as Shinichi Kudo. Origins Lupin described himself to an Imperial soldier as being mixed heritage Japanese. Goemon immediately countered by saying Lupin was not Japanese, but still worthy of respect. Lupin's ethnic origins have not been specified; in the 2008 OVA Green Vs. Red, a dossier held by Zenigata indicates his place of birth as \\"unknown\\". He admits being French like his grandfather, but apparently lives in Japan. Inspector Zenigata has called him Japanese and Lupin himself once referred to himself as \\"half-Japanese, half-French\\" (2nd TV series, episode 118). In the first TV series, episode 13 (\\"Beware the Time Machine!\\"), Lupin tricks Mamo Kyosuke by dressing as a Japanese peasant and acting as though they are in feudal Japan. Lupin specifically states to Mamo that the ancestor whose face he most resembles was Japanese. When Mamo \\"meets\\" this ancestor (Lupin in disguise), Lupin states that he would like to marry some girl by the name of Marianne Lupin from France someday. Lupin often speaks of both his famous grandfather and his father, both of whom were thieves. He occasionally quotes his grandfather's advice and has attempted to complete or repeat heists attempted by his ancestors with good or bad luck. Voice actors Ars√®ne Lupin III was first voiced by Taichir≈ç Hirokawa in the CinemaScope version of the 1969 pilot film for the first anime, while Nachi Nozawa voiced him in the pilot's TV version. However, Yasuo Yamada was given the role when the first anime was actually produced (1971‚Äì72) and continued to voice Lupin until his death in 1995, with one exception. Due to budget concerns, TMS decided not to employ the regular voice cast for the 1987 original video animation The Fuma Conspiracy, with Toshio Furukawa voicing Lupin. Kanichi Kurita took over the role after Yamada's death and he continues to voice Lupin III to this day. Due to a lack of localization credits on any known prints, Lupin's English voice actor in the 1979 Toho/Frontier Enterprises dub of The Mystery of Mamo remained unverified until 2018, when a chance discovery by fans revealed the voice actor to be Tom Clark. From 1992 to 1995, Bob Bergen voiced Lupin in Streamline Pictures' dubs of The Castle of Cagliostro (in which the character was renamed \\"The Wolf\\" to avoid legal complications with Maurice Leblanc's estate), episodes 145 and 155 of the second anime (collectively released as Lupin III: Tales of the Wolf and later Lupin III's Greatest Capers) and The Mystery of Mamo. For AnimEigo's 1995 release of The Fuma Conspiracy, Lupin, named \\"Rupan\\" in the dub, was voiced by Robin Robertson. In Manga Entertainment's 1996 dubs of The Mystery of Mamo and Bye Bye, Lady Liberty (retitled Secret of Mamo and Goodbye Lady Liberty respectively) for the UK market, Bill Dufris provided Lupin's voice, where the character was renamed \\"Wolf III\\". In Manga's 2000 dub of The Castle of Cagliostro, produced in cooperation with Animaze, David Hayter provides Lupin's voice; due to the non- union nature of the project, Hayter was initially credited as \\"Sean Barker\\". Hayter was also involved in the production of Discotek Media's re-release of the film, and re-voiced several of his lines for a \\"family-friendly\\" edit of the Animaze/Manga dub produced exclusively for Discotek. Sonny Strait voiced Lupin in Funimation Entertainment's dubs of several TV specials and theatrical films between 2002 and 2005, and in their 2013 dub of The Woman Called Fujiko Mine. Tony Oliver voiced Lupin in the Phuuz dub of the second anime and The Mystery of Mamo for Pioneer/Geneon, as well as the video game Treasure of the Sorcerer King, between 2003 and 2006. Oliver reprised the role for Discotek's dubs of the fifth and sixth anime. Keith Silverstein voiced the character in the Bang Zoom! Entertainment dub for Discotek's 2015 release of the Jigen's Gravestone film. Appearances in other media Lupin makes an appearance as a guest character in the 2012 game Girls RPG Cinderelife developed by Level-5 for the Nintendo 3DS. The character has also been used in television advertising for motorcycles, gasoline, razors, fast food companies, etc. Reception Allen Divers of Anime News Network (ANN) called Lupin \\"one of the most recognized figures in Japan\\" with many homages and references in other series. Similarly, Crunchyroll's Kara Dennison said that even if someone has not seen a Lupin title, they have \\"almost certainly experienced something either inspired by or paying tribute to him and his gang.\\" Lupin was voted the eighth most iconic anime hero by Mania.com. IGN ranked Lupin as the fifteenth best anime character of all time in 2009, placing him on the 16th spot in 2014. After completing his involvement with the Lupin III franchise in 1980, Hayao Miyazaki wrote an article in Animage where he discussed his view of the series and the character. He stated that Lupin was \\"truly a character of his era\\" but that as the franchise progressed he had been overtaken by the real world. Despite this, Miyazaki still thought fondly of Lupin's early days. For the video game Persona 5, its creative team originally asked themselves how a character like Ars√®ne Lupin III might win appeal in modern society. Anime director and voice actor Shinichi Watanabe is known for dressing like Lupin in his daily life, a trait which is extended to his avatar character in Excel Saga, Nabeshin.

It was one of the most successful prison breaks of the American Civil War. Led by Colonel Thomas E. Rose of the 77th Pennsylvania Infantry, the prisoners started tunnelling in a rat-infested zone which the Confederate guards were reluctant to enter. The tunnel emerged in a vacant lot beside a warehouse, from where the escapees could walk out through the gate without arousing suspicion. Since the prison was believed to be escape-proof, there was less vigilance by the authorities than in other camps, and the alarm was not raised for nearly 12 hours. Over half the prisoners were able to reach Union lines, helped by their familiarity with the terrain after serving in McClellan's Peninsula Campaign of 1862.  Background  At the outbreak of the Civil War, Luther Libby was running a ship supply shop from the corner of a large warehouse in Richmond, Virginia. In need of a new prison for captured Union officers, Confederate soldiers gave Libby 48 hours to evacuate his property.Klee, 32. The sign over the north-west corner reading \\"L. Libby & Son, Ship Chandlers\\" was never removed, and consequently the building and prison bore his name. Since the Confederates believed the building inescapable, the staff considered their job relatively easy.  Location and layout  Libby Prison encompassed an entire city block in Richmond.Morgan, 29. To the north lay Cary Street, connecting the prison area to the rest of the city. On the south side ran the James River. The prison itself stood three stories above ground with a basement exposed on the river side. Confederate soldiers whitewashed the outer walls to make lurking prisoners instantly recognizable.Morgan, 30. The first floor of Libby Prison housed the various offices of the Confederate guard unit; the second and third floors were partitioned as inmate holding areas. The basement of the prison was divided into three sections. The western end was a storage cellar, the middle section was a carpenter's shop used by civilians, and the eastern end was an abandoned kitchen. This kitchen in the eastern section was once used by Union inmates, but an infestation of rats and constant flooding compelled the Confederates to close it off. The abandoned area became known as \\"Rat Hell.\\"  Rat Hell  Though most of the prisoners (and guards alike) did what they could to avoid Rat Hell, a handful of Union officers schemed to break in. By removing a stove on the first floor and chipping their way into the adjoining chimney, the officers constructed a cramped but effective passage for access to the eastern basement. Once access between the two floors was established, the officers set about plans to tunnel their way out. The floor of Rat Hell was covered in two feet of straw. This straw was a bane and a blessing for the officers. On one hand, it provided a perfect hiding place for the dirt excavated from the tunnel. Captain I. N. Johnston, who spent more time in Rat Hell than any other Union officer, commented, \\"I have been asked a thousand times how we contrived to hide such a quantity of earth as the digging of a tunnel of that size would dislodge. [On the floor] we made a wide and deep opening...in this the loose dirt was closely packed, and then nicely covered with straw.\\"Johnston, 67. By such means, the Union officers were able to conceal all signs of the tunnel that might tip off civilians and wandering sentries. The straw in Rat Hell also provided a convenient hiding place for workers during the day. One man was chosen to conceal all signs of the tunnel while the digging party scrambled up to the first floor. He would then remain buried in the straw for the remainder of the day until the next relief arrived at dusk. Johnston wrote, \\"...There was a large quantity [of straw] there, and but for which our undertaking must have been discovered nearly as soon as begun.\\"Johnston, 72. As helpful as the straw might have been, it was nevertheless the main reason for the nickname, Rat Hell. Lt. Charles H. Moran, a recaptured officer from Libby, wrote, \\"No tongue can tell...how the poor fellow[s] passed among the squealing rats,‚Äîenduring the sickening air, the deathly chill, the horrible interminable darkness.\\"Moran, 217. Major A. G. Hamilton, a leading founder of the escape party, pointed to the dilemma of the rats: \\"The only difficulties experienced [were lack of proper tools] and the unpleasant feature of having to hear hundreds of rats squeal all the time, while they ran over the diggers almost without a sign of fear.\\"Hamilton, Story of the Famous Tunnel Escape from Libby Prison. Colonel Thomas E. Rose, the leader of the escape, addressed the double-edged lack of light in Rat Hell: \\"The profound darkness caused some...to become bewildered when they attempted to move about. I sometimes had to feel all over the cellar to gather up the men that were lost.\\"National Tribune Despite the difficulties, the dark repugnant atmosphere of Rat Hell offered the most effective cover. \\"On rare occasions, guards entered the large basement rooms. 'This was, however, so uninviting a place, that the Confederates made this visit as brief as nominal compliance with their orders permitted.'\\"Morgan, \\"Breakout from Rat Hell,\\" 33.  Element of surprise  The tunnelers organized into three relief teams with five members each. After 17 days of digging, they succeeded in breaking through to a 50-foot vacant lot on the eastern side of the prison, resurfacing beneath a tobacco shed inside the grounds of the nearby Kerr's Warehouse. When Col. Rose finally broke through to the other side, he told his men that the \\"Underground Railroad to God's Country was open!\\"Morgan, \\"Breakout from Rat Hell,\\" 34. The officers escaped the prison in groups of two and three on the night of February 9, 1864. Once within the tobacco shed, the men collected inside the walled warehouse yard and simply strolled out the front gate. Union officers meandering through the streets of Richmond late at night might appear to be a leg of the plan doomed to failure, however, the guards simply did not expect that escape from Libby prison was possible. The fact that the Libby guards were not looking for signs of escape meant that they were in a position to be more easily deceived. Union Army Lieutenant Moran described how the sentries were not interested in stopping people outside the bounds of their jurisdiction, \\"provided, of course, that the retreating form...were not recognized as Yankees.\\"Moran, Famous Adventures, 209. The tunnel provided enough distance from the prison to stealthily subvert those jurisdictional lines and allow prisoners to slip into the dark streets unchallenged. So effective was this buffer that 109 men escaped the prison without ever being stopped. At one point, Colonel Rose walked straight into the path of an oncoming sentinel. Unflinching, he \\"strode boldly past the guard unchallenged.\\"Morgan, \\"Breakout,\\" 36. Even more amazing, once news of the escape way broke out among the prisoners a panicked rush resulted, creating a thunderous stampede for the tunnel. Wholly unsuspecting of the reality of the situation, one Confederate guard yelled out to a fellow sentry, \\"Halloa, Bill‚Äîthere's somebody's coffeepot upset, sure!\\"Cavada, 174. Libby Prison close-up Precious time Another example of how unaware the Confederates were caught is evident in the reaction to the escape. From the Richmond Examiner, February 11, 1864: \\"At first it was suspicioned [sic] that the night sentinels had been bribed. They were placed under arrest, searched ... for evidences of their criminality, [and] confined in Castle Thunder (a civilian penitentiary near Libby Prison). Upon the testimony afforded by the revelation of the tunnel, the imprisoned guards were at once released and restored to duty.\\"Richmond Examiner. Despite the stampeding of prisoners, strong senior officers such as Colonel Harrison C. Hobart had the sense of mind to tie off the flow of escapees before dawn's light. \\"The remaining prisoners replaced the bricks at the fireplace, and the guards began their morning routine, unaware that 109 escaped Union officers were making their way toward the Federal lines.\\" Keeping the escape secret from the Confederate guards until the last possible moment gave the evading inmates what they needed most: time. After the morning roll call came up over a hundred short, the Confederates counted frantically several more times to ensure that the Yankees weren't pulling a trick. Such \\"tricks\\" had occurred on many occasions when men slipped in and out of the counting lines; this \\"repeating\\" was a mild prank often used to frustrate the Confederates at roll call, much to the glee of the Union prisoners. On the morning of February 10, the Confederates realized that this was no trick. By this time, the first prisoners had been loose for nearly twelve hours. Frenzy broke out among the Confederates: \\"Messengers and dispatches were soon flying in all directions, and all the horse, foot, and dragoons of Richmond were in pursuit of the fugitives before noon.\\"Moran, Famous Adventures, 234. Despite the mobilization of Richmond, almost 17 hours passed before the Confederates could respond. This no doubt added greatly to the window of opportunity that helped 59 men reach Union lines. The Richmond Enquirer of February 11, 1864 expressed such a sentiment: \\"It is feared that [the fugitives] have gotten rather too much the start of the pursuers to admit anything like the recapture of them all.\\"Richmond Enquirer , February 11, 1864. Of the 109 escapees, 48 were recaptured, and 2 drowned in the nearby James River.Klee 33. Prior reconnaissance Though Union Commander George B. McClellan received little more than defeat in the Peninsular Campaign of 1862, his men received something more. For those who would break out of Libby prison, the time spent studying maps and hoofing ground in Virginia familiarized them with the enemy terrain. Such intelligence was of weighty benefit for the prisoners forging their way back to the Federal lines two years later. The Richmond Enquirer reported, \\"It is supposed that the direction taken by them all ‚Äì if, indeed all have left the city ‚Äì was towards the Peninsula...\\" Lieutenant Moran, who escaped late in the night, wrote, \\"I had served with McClellan in the Peninsula campaign of 1862, I knew the country well from my frequent inspection of war maps, and the friendly north star gave me my bearings.\\"Moran, Famous Adventures, 229. Just as slaves had been following the North Star to envisioned freedom, it also guided escaped Union prisoners from Libby in 1864. Most of the prisoners made reference to following the North Star, such as Captain Johnston who wrote, \\"I ... started due north, taking the north star for my guide, changing my course only when [I] came near any of the [Rebel] camps.\\"Johnston, Four Months in Libby, 97. Leaders Colonel Rose and Major Hamilton led the escape efforts. Rose, wounded at the Battle of Chickamauga, arrived at the prison on October 1, 1863. From the moment he stepped in the door, he was bent on escape. While exploring the darker regions of Rat Hell, he happened upon Hamilton, who was also searching for a proper tunneling point. Soon fast friends, the two worked toward the successful escape in February. Contemporarily, Libby prisoners showered Rose with admiration and credit for the escape's success. Rose and Hamilton worked tirelessly together to bring about the escape. Rose thought of breaking into the basement from the chimney, while Hamilton engineered the passage. Rose toiled feverishly in the tunnel and organized digging teams while Hamilton worked out the logistics and invented contraptions for removing dirt and supplying oxygen to the tunnel. Various setbacks plagued the tunneling effort but as Lieutenant Moran recorded, \\"the undaunted Rose, aided by Hamilton, [always] persuaded the men to another effort, and soon the knives and toy saws were at work again with vigor.\\"Moran, Famous Adventures, 207. Lieutenant Colonel Federico Fern√°ndez Cavada, a prisoner at Libby, wrote, \\"To Colonel Rose is chiefly due the credit [for the escape]... Animated by an unflinching earnestness of purpose, unwearying perseverance, and no ordinary engineering abilities, he organized ... working parties [which] he conducted every night [in] the cellars of the prison.\\"Cavada, Libby Life, 167. \\"[Rose] was the acknowledged leader of the tunnel party, the acknowledged projector of the tunnel,\\" maintained Hamilton, \\"and it was through his good sense, energy, and management ... that the escape was a success.\\" Despite his work in planning the escape, Rose was captured before reaching Federal lines. Minutes from an advancing Union front at Williamsburg, he was ambushed by Confederate pickets and wrestled back to Libby Prison. Though placed in solitary confinement, the Confederates felt Rose's presence at Libby now presented a danger. Given the chance, they gladly traded the famed escapist for a Confederate colonel on April 30, 1864. Rose returned to his unit, the 77th Pennsylvania Infantry, and fought through to the end of the war. Effect To judge the success of the Libby Prison escape solely by the number of men who crossed Federal lines would be a mistake. Richmond was deeply affected by the break, and Libby Prison itself was thrown into chaos, much to the satisfaction and raised morale of the remaining prisoners. Lieutenant Colonel Cavada recorded some of the more humorous effects of the escape inside the prison. On one occasion, the entire camp was roused in the middle of the night for a roll call because a sentry thought he saw something down in a sewer. It turned out to be his own shadow.Cavada, 190. Even the Confederate warden, Major Thomas P. Turner, was visibly shaken. Cavada commented, \\"Really, when our distracted little Commandant now comes into our rooms, he keeps his knees well together, it is necessary to be very cautious, some of us might slip out between his legs!\\"Cavada, 192.

The play dramatized some episodes from the life of Samuel Johnson and takes its title from his long poem The Vanity of Human Wishes. The episodes taken dramatize Johnson's relationship with Hester Thrale, and as such, draw from her Anecdotes and Diaries rather than the traditionally more popular Life of Samuel Johnson of James Boswell. The play was abandoned after the completion of the First Act. The only known extant fragment was given by Beckett to Ruby Cohn. Beckett left it in her Paris Hotel room shortly before the completion of her book of Beckett criticism, Just Play, the first to outline Beckett's dramatic juvenilia. The fragment was first printed as an appendix to that volume. The fragment was slightly annotated for the Disjecta collection, noting that Beckett produced a \\"fair copy\\" of the notebook material. The fragment, however, is only one of the \\"three full notebooks\\" that Beckett used while writing the play. Beckett would reuse some of the dramatic effects, however. Critic Harold Bloom writes in his essay on Beckett in The Western Canon that the fragment, particular the characters' reactions to Leavett's entrance offer the first glimpses of Beckett's much later masterpieces Endgame and Waiting for Godot.

Itazura na Kiss was first serialized and published in 1990 by Shueisha through Bessatsu Margaret magazine. It became successful very quickly and became the manga series that Tada became known for in Japan. The manga became so popular that three live TV series have been made so far in 1996, 2005, and 2010, with a sequel of the 2005 drama in late 2007. In 2013, a remake of the Japanese live TV series, called Mischievous Kiss: Love in Tokyo, was made. Despite its success, the manga was never completed due to the unexpected death of the author in a house accident while she was moving to another house with her husband and son. However the manga series continues to be published with the permission of the artist's widower. A drama CD series was released in 2005‚Äì2006 and a 25 episode anime adaptation aired in 2008. In an interview, the author's widower, Shigeru Nishikawa, revealed that the manga's intended finale was to be conceptualized in the anime for the first time. Scripts regarding the plot of the anime closely followed the author's planned ending. On January 27, 2009, Digital Manga Publishing issued a press release announcing the acquisition of the license to publish Itazura na Kiss in English. They will be publishing the series in 12 omnibus editions; the first two are scheduled for November 2009 and March 2010, respectively. The last two volumes were available in their Akadot Retail store. The manga is also available through Kindle and Bookwalker. The series was recently adapted into three live-action films. Plot In this romantic comedy story, a high school girl named Kotoko Aihara finally tells a fellow senior named Naoki that she has loved him from afar since she saw him on their first day of high school. However, Naoki, a hottie \\"super-ikemen\\" (handsome male) who is smart and good at sports, rejects her offhand. Fate intervenes when a mild earthquake ruins Kotoko's family house. While the house gets rebuilt, Kotoko and her dad stay at the home of her dad's childhood bestfriend...whose son is Naoki. Naoki eventually falls for Kotoko and starts to have romantic, protective feelings for her.

On the same day as her confession, Kotoko's poorly constructed house is destroyed in a mild earthquake, and she and her father Shigeo are invited to stay at a house owned by her father's close friend Shigeki. Arriving to the house, she is shocked to find out that Shigeo's friend is the dad of Naoki, and that she will be living in the same house as him.

Located in Ponce Inlet, Florida, the peak of the mound is the highest elevation in the small city. While it once stood at forty feet above sea level, a combination of public works projects on the nearby roads and natural erosion have reduced the height of the mound by about 10 feet. The mound was built by Native Americans of the late St. Johns II cultural period, as indicated by the finding of pre-Columbian \\"chalky ware\\" ceramics dating to later than 800 AD. These overlie earlier relics of the St. Johns I cultural period, the cultural period following the Archaic period. The St. Johns period was characterized by the introduction of mound-building and a more sedentary, rather than nomadic, lifestyle. The natives who once lived at this location were closely tied to both the nearby Atlantic Ocean and the resource-rich saltwater estuaries of the Halifax River immediately west of the mound. The mound formed from a combination of discarded oyster shells, clam shells, and other debris. Whether or not the shell heaps scattered in coastal and riparian locations throughout Florida were natural deposits or of human origin remained a matter of debate in the mid-19th century, although Daniel Brinton had come to the conclusion by 1859 that the shell mounds on the east coast of Florida were the waste heaps of aboriginal groups that had accumulated over centuries. Initial studies of the Green Mound area were conducted in the early to mid-1940s by archeologist Dr. John Griffin, who found that the mound was in fact inhabited by its builders and their subsequent generations. Later excavation revealed multiple layers of clay floors, remnants of structural components such as postholes, and evidence of ash, fire pits and hearths at the site. It is thought that the dwellings that sat upon the mound were constructed of materials such as palmetto limbs and other local forms of timber such as oak. It is also inferred that due to the social structure that existed at the time, the inhabitation of the mound's top was reserved for the highest-ranking members (elites) of the community. The most likely inhabitants of these prime locations on top of the mound would have been tribal chiefs and religious leaders. Depending on their social status, other members of the community would have lived in areas closer to ground level. The mound was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2020.

Asher, who had left the secret service years ago to wed Lydia, reluctantly trails the pair to Paris, wiring Lydia to alert her to the danger. But Lydia is aware of something Asher does not know: an obscure footnote in one of her medical journals clues her into the fact that the safe house Asher is planning to use is in the hands of a double agent, actually in league with Karolyi. To save her husband, Lydia seeks the assistance of the oldest of the London vampires: the enigmatic and haughty Simon Ysidro. Ysidro agrees to help, to keep Farren from forming an alliance with humans, but on one condition: over Lydia's strenuous objections, he recruits a drab but romantic-minded governess, Margaret Potton, to travel with them as Lydia's chaperon. The three of them trail Asher across Europe to Constantinople, as he joins forces with Farren's strong-willed and alluring vampire-wife, Anthea. In Constantinople, the trail dies, as Asher has been kidnapped by the vampire lord of the city, who is struggling to keep control as a rival seeks to destroy him. Asher tries to uncover his own role in the power struggle, for this may hold the key to his survival. Meanwhile, Lydia and Ysidro explore the city, Lydia through Asher's diplomatic connections, Ysidro through his nocturnal prowlings, seeking any clue as to where Asher and Charles have disappeared to, even as Margaret's obsession with Ysidro and jealousy of Lydia endanger them all. Only by unwinding the threads of money trails, strange business transactions, and a series of increasingly gruesome murders can Ysidro and Lydia find Charles and Asher, and escape the city alive.

After the United States Army Air Corps grew into the Army Air Forces and split into the new service, the United States Air Force, the Army was left with its sole fixed-wing aviation units flying Taylorcraft L-2 Grasshopper observation planes for artillery units. The Army would develop a new concept of aviation using the helicopter that would show promise during the Korean War and would revolutionize warfare during the Vietnam War. History=Origins of Army Aviation Army Aviation traces its origins back to the American Civil War. Both Union and Confederate forces used hydrogen-filled balloons to direct artillery fire, marking the beginning of U.S. military aeronautics and of aerial support of Army ground forces. The Army also used balloons during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and World War I, but airplanes replaced balloons for most military purposes during the latter conflict. While not part of the present Army Aviation Branch's heritage, United States military aviation began in 1907 with the Signal Corps Aeronautical Division and its acquisition of its first heavier-than-air aircraft, an airplane built to Army specifications by the Wright brothers. During World War I, the Air Service's aircraft strength grew from a few dozen to more than 11,000 planes, and the number of aviation personnel came to total more than 190,000. The Army Air Service was created with the disestablishment of the Signal Corps Aviation Section in May 1918. After World War I, General William Mitchell and other Air Service leaders spoke out forcefully in favor of an independent air force. Since they envisioned aviation as a separate striking force, capable of independent operations, they opposed its remaining a supporting arm of the ground forces. Although Congress, as well as most Army leaders, rejected Mitchell's argument, the Air Service did become a separate combat arm, equal in status to the infantry, cavalry, and artillery. In 1926, the name of the air arm was changed to Army Air Corps, and then, in June 1941, the Air Corps and other Army air elements were merged to form the Army Air Forces, co-equal with the Army Ground Forces and the Army Service Forces. During the 1930s, many Army Air Corps leaders began to experiment with strategic air operations. Like Billy Mitchell before them, they advocated using air power independently of the Army ground forces to destroy enemy targets behind the lines of combat. This Air Corps emphasis on strategic operations disturbed some ground forces leaders, who believed their aerial support needs were being neglected. Aerial support was particularly vital for artillery fire adjustment. Partly because Air Corps fire support aircraft were not always available, the chief of field artillery and other artillery officers became interested in using light aircraft organic to the artillery units. The Army experimented with using small organic aircraft for artillery fire adjustment and other functions in maneuvers at Camp Beauregard, La., in August 1940. The tests were repeated on a larger scale in the Army maneuvers in Louisiana, Tennessee, Texas, and the Carolinas in 1941. Birth of Army Aviation (1942) Following a final series of experiments with organic Army spotter aircraft conducted in 1942, the Secretary of War ordered the establishment of organic air observation for field artillery‚Äîhence the birth of modern Army Aviation‚Äîon 6 June 1942. It was this new World War II-era phenomenon with its few small single-engine spotter planes, organic Army Aviation, that eventually evolved into today's Army Aviation Branch. Organic Army Aviation first entered into combat in November 1942 on the coast of North Africa. During World War II, Piper L-4 Grasshoppers and a few larger Stinson L-5 Sentinels were used to adjust artillery fire, gather intelligence, support naval bombardment, direct bombing missions, and perform other functions. Most training of both pilots and mechanics was conducted by the Department of Air Training within the Field Artillery School at Post Field, Okla., although the Army Air Forces conducted some primary training of organic Army Aviation personnel. After the creation of the Army Air Forces, the Army Ground Forces retained the use of light aircraft for artillery forward observation and reconnaissance in June 1942. First use of the helicopter in combat is credited to the USAAF 1st Air Commando Group in Burma in 1943. The 1ACG operated six Sikorsky R-4 helicopters primarily for air rescue and medical evacuation. When the United States Air Force was established as a separate service in 1947, the Army developed its light planes and rotary wing aircraft to support its ground operations. The Korean War and Vietnam War proved the growing capabilities of these aviation assets to perform a variety of missions not covered by the Air Force. The Korean War provided new challenges and opportunities for Army Aviation. Organic Army Aviation had acquired its first helicopters, thirteen Bell H-13 Sioux, in 1947, shortly before the U.S. Air Force became independent of the Army. In Korea, the Army employed the Cessna O-1 Bird Dog and other improved fixed wing planes, but also helicopters. The Army used its H-13s primarily for medical evacuation, command and control, and transport of lightweight and valuable cargo. Because of the rugged terrain of the Korean peninsula, the value of helicopters came to be recognized by all the services; the demand for both helicopters and trained aviators consistently exceeded the supply. In 1951 the Army began organizing five helicopter transport companies and training warrant officer pilots. There was, however, an ongoing rivalry between the Army and the Air Force concerning responsibility and resources for the aerial support of ground forces. Because of this rivalry, and also because of the shortage of helicopters, only two Army transport companies were supplied with Sikorsky H-19 Chickasaw helicopters in time to participate in the Korean War. Transport helicopters nevertheless proved themselves by moving cargo and personnel during the final months of the war and then by participating in prisoner exchanges and other functions after the cessation of hostilities. During the Korean War, the Department of Air Training at Post Field expanded, and in early 1953, it became the Army Aviation School. As a result of the expansion of both aviation and artillery training, Post Field became overcrowded, and the Army decided to move the Army Aviation School to a different post. When no satisfactory permanent Army post was found, a temporary post, Camp Rucker, Ala., was chosen. The first armed helicopter company was activated in Okinawa in 1962. It was deployed to Thailand and then to Vietnam, where it flew escort for lift helicopters. The Department of Defense did not abolish mission restrictions on the Army's rotary-wing aircraft, thereby technically authorizing the Army to arm helicopters until 1966. The \\"Howze Board,\\" or \\"Tactical Mobility Requirements Board,\\" was established in 1962 to develop and test the concept of air mobility. After test exercises, war games, and concentrated study and analysis, the Howze Board recommended that the Army commit itself to organic air mobility ‚Äì later known as air assault. The Howze Board recommended the extensive use of helicopters to transport infantry troops, artillery, and supplies, as well as to provide local aerial fire support. These recommendations were tested by the 11th Air Assault Division (Test) from 1963 to 1965. In 1965, the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) was organized and sent to Vietnam, where it repeatedly demonstrated the validity of the airmobile concept in actual combat. The creation, implementation, and consolidation of the Army Aviation Branch dominated the 1980s. Prominent aviators, as well as other Army leaders, had debated the establishment of Aviation as a separate branch since the time of the Korean War. The opposition to a separate aviation branch had resulted in part from Army attitudes regarding the Army Air Corps and the U.S. Air Force. In Army circles, both of these aviation organizations were believed to have been unreliable in performing their mission of supporting the ground forces‚Äîeven after having been given resources to do so. Since Army Aviation had demonstrated its commitment to the support of the ground battle in Vietnam, however, opposition to a separate aviation branch began to wane. Also, Army Aviation had grown in size and technological sophistication. This growth caused increasingly complex problems in training, procurement, doctrine development, proponent responsibility, and personnel management. Many non- aviators as well as aviators became convinced that these problems could be solved more effectively by the creation of an aviation branch. \\"America‚Äôs Helicopter War\\" Began in Vietnam (1961) Both Army Aviation and the helicopter came of age during the conflict in Southeast Asia. The most widely used helicopter, the Bell UH-1 Iroquois, or Huey, began to arrive in Vietnam in significant numbers in 1964. Before the end of the conflict, more than 5,000 of these versatile aircraft were introduced into Southeast Asia. They were used for medical evacuation, command and control, air assault; personnel and materiel transport; and gunships. The AH-1 Cobra arrived in 1967 to partially replace the Huey in its gun ship capacity. Other important helicopters in Vietnam included the Boeing CH-47 Chinook, the Hughes OH-6 Cayuse, the Bell OH-58 Kiowa, and the Sikorsky CH-54 Tarhe. Although the concept of air mobility had been developed with a mid-intensity European conflict in mind, Army Aviation and the helicopter had proven themselves during the low intensity conflict in Southeast Asia. Under the Johnson- McConnell agreement of 1966, the Army agreed to limit its fixed-wing aviation role to administrative mission support (light unarmed aircraft of civilian design). Afterwards, the Army turned its major attention back to the threat of a mid or high intensity conflict in Europe, and doubts reemerged about the value of helicopters in that sort of arena. Some military leaders believed that the helicopter could not survive and perform an essential role in a heavy combat environment. To gain general acceptance and ensure further success, Army Aviation continued to develop new doctrine, tactics, aircraft, equipment, and organizational structure. New or radically modified aircraft were adopted from the late 1970s into the mid-1980s. These included the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk, Boeing AH-64 Apache, D-model of the CH-47 Chinook, and OH-58D version of the Kiowa. Birth of Army Aviation Branch (April 1983) Both Department of the Army and U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command conducted extensive studies of the separate-branch question during the 1970s through 1982. In March 1983, the Chief of Staff of the Army recommended forming a separate aviation branch. The Secretary of the Army approved that recommendation on 12 April 1983‚Äì the date celebrated as the Branch's birthday. Aviation Officer Basic and Advanced Courses began at Fort Rucker in 1984, and a gradual consolidation of aviation-related activities followed. In 1986, the U.S. Army Air Traffic Control Activity became part of the branch. In the following year, a Noncommissioned Officers Academy was established at Fort Rucker. In 1988, the Army Aviation Logistics School, which had been dependent on the Transportation Center at Fort Eustis, was incorporated into the Aviation Branch. Also in 1988, the Army Aviation Modernization Plan was given final approval and implemented. The modernization plan called for a gradual reduction in the number of Army aircraft as older models were replaced by modern ones. Aircraft that appeared during the late 1980s and early 1990s included the armed Bell OH-58 Kiowa Warrior and the new TH-67 Creek training helicopter, along with the Cessna Citation V and Beechcraft C-12 Huron fixed- wing aircraft. Army Aviation's role of providing the indispensable vertical dimension to the modern battlefield has become universally recognized. For example, during operations in Grenada, Panama, and the Persian Gulf region, Army Aviation played major and decisive roles. One of the first blows of Operation Desert Storm was struck by Army Aviation. Apache helicopters destroyed key Iraqi early warning radar sites and thus opened the air corridors to Baghdad for the bombing campaign that preceded the ground war. Then during the 100 hours of ground combat, Army helicopters dominated nighttime operations. The decreased military budgets following the end of the Cold War forced both the Army and Army Aviation to downsize. Army Aviation's response was to develop the \\"Aviation Restructure Initiative\\", a plan to decrease the size of the force while continuing to provide a capable, ready force. By the late 1990s, continuing deficiencies and unintended results of the ARI led to a series of aviation plans as key pieces of the Army-wide modernization and transformation. In 2003, the Aviation Branch assumed overall responsibility for unmanned aerial vehicles within the Army. Operations since Desert Storm showed the versatility and flexibility of Army Aviation. Examples were uses of AH-64 Apaches in peacekeeping operations in the Balkans as a deterrent to mobs threatening fellow citizens or paramilitary groups trying to remove weapons from agreed cantonments. The beginning of the Global War on Terrorism in 2001 drew Army Aviation again into ongoing combat. Events in Afghanistan and Iraq have reaffirmed the qualities that caused the creation of Organic Army Aviation in 1942. These qualities included the responsiveness to the needs of the ground commander and commitment to the Soldier in the ground fight. At the same time, Army Aviation ‚Äì including Army Special Operations Aviation ‚Äì has played vital and ever-expanding roles across the spectrum of Joint and Combined operations. In recognition of the demonstrated increasing importance of aviation in Army doctrine and operations, Aviation became a separate branch on 12 April 1983.\\"Aviation\\". The Institute of Heraldry. Headquarters, Department of the Army. Accessed 28 April 2008. Mission The mission of Army Aviation is to find, fix, and destroy the enemy through fire and maneuver; and to provide combat, combat support and combat service support in coordinated operations as an integral member of the combined arms team. On the modern battlefield, Army Aviation, unlike the other members of the combined arms team, has the organic flexibility, versatility, and assets to fulfill a variety of maneuver, CS, CSS, roles and functions. These cover the spectrum of combined arms operations. Aviation can accomplish each of these roles‚Äîwithin the limits of finite assets and capabilities‚Äîduring offensive or defensive operations and also for joint, combined, contingency, or special operations. Organization Originally aircraft and pilots were assigned directly to artillery or other units requiring light aircraft. In 1957 the Army decided to create individual company sized units in the numbered divisions. These companies were soon expanded to battalion size during the Vietnam war and further expanded in the late 1980s to regimental-sized support elements under a brigade headquarters.

Gerota (pronounced , 17 July 1867 ‚Äì 3 March 1939), Romanian anatomist, physician, radiologist, urologist, and a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy from 1916. Biography He was born in Craiova, the son of a priest, Dimitrie Constantin Gerota (b. 1841), and of Maria Gerota, n√©e SurpƒÉteanu (b. 1847). He studied at the Carol I High School in Craiova. In 1886, he entered the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Bucharest, graduating with an M.D. degree in 1892. For four years, he pursued his studies in Paris in Berlin. After returning to Bucharest, he started practicing medicine and teaching at various institutions. Starting in October 1897, he taught anatomy at the National School of Fine Arts in Bucharest. In Fall 1898, he and his student Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi produced the carved muscles anatomical study entitled the Ecorch√©, based on research done in the dissection room of the Faculty of Medicine and the Museum of Comparative Anatomy. In May 1903, the flayed study was exhibited at the Romanian Athenaeum; the Society of Students of Fine Arts petitioned Spiru Haret, the minister of Education and Culture, to acquire it. Since then, generations of Romanian art and medical students have studied anatomy from plaster casts made from the Ecorch√©. Considered to be the first Romanian radiologist, Gerota initiated academic radiology education in that country. In 1898, he wrote the book '\\"The R√∂ntgen Rays or the X-Rays\\". Some years later, he had to abandon radiology because of radiodermatitis of the hand, which required amputation. In 1909, he established a sanatorium, where he practiced surgery, and carried out charitable work. From 1913, he was a professor of surgical anatomy and experimental surgery at the University of Bucharest. In November 1935, he submitted the article \\"Monarhie cu camarilƒÉ sau republicƒÉ\\" to the newspaper Universul. The article, highly critical of King Carol II, was censored, and Gerota was arrested and sent to Malmaison prison in Bucharest. After protests by medical students, he was liberated four days later. He was arrested again in 1936, and sent to Jilava prison. Set free, he died in 1939 in Bucharest. Legacy Gerota researched the anatomy and physiology of the bladder and appendix, and developed a method for injecting lymphatic vessels known in textbooks as the \\"Gerota method\\". The renal fascia is sometimes called Gerota's fascia or Gerota's capsule after him. Also, the Albarran-Ormond syndrome (an inflammatory retroperitoneal fibrosis, named after urologists Joaqu√≠n Albarr√°n and John Kelso Ormond) is also known as Gerota‚Äôs syndrome or Gerota‚Äôs fasciitis. He was a famed surgeon and the founder of a large Bucharest emergency-care hospital. The hospital, established on July 17, 1907, is now named the \\"Prof. Dr. Dimitrie Gerota Military Emergency Hospital\\". Many of the patients affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in Romania are treated at this hospital. Gerota also founded a museum of anatomical-surgical casts of his creation. A street in central Bucharest (formerly Jean Louis Calderon Street) now bears his name.

Life=Origins Marcellinus was said to have been of good birth and character and to have had a good education,Damascius, fragments 158 he was also a devout pagan,Damascius, Epitome Photiana, 91 and is alleged to have been a skilled soothsayer.Damascius, fragments 158, 159. Nothing is known of Marcellinus' early life; records first mention his name in 454 when he rebelled against Western Emperor Valentinian III following his murder and assassination of Flavius A√´tius who was Marcellinus' friend.PLRE, II pp 708 He was in Dalmatia at the time and is believed to have held the title of comes rei militaris.PLRE, II pp 1289 He was powerful enough to seize control of Dalmatia for himself and was presumably able to do this because he was commander of the troops there. He appears to have remained ruler of Dalmatia down to 468 and to have preserved his independence except for briefly accepting the authority of the Emperors Majorian and Anthemius. Sources claim he ruled justly and well and kept Dalmatia independent of the emperor and of barbarian rulers.Damascius, fragments 155, 158 Military career During the dying days of the western half of the empire there remained four main players which participated in the power games revolving around the throne; the Eastern Roman Empire as one continued to play a significant political role as did the western Roman military which made up the other three. The Gallic army was prominent, especially under Aegidius in the 460's, the Italian army was the main influence for Ricimer, and the forces of Dalmatia gave a solid base of power and support between 450 and 480 for Marcellinus and later his nephew Western Emperor Julius Nepos.The Cambridge Ancient History Vol. XIV pp 19 When Majorian took the throne in December 457 Marcellinus pledged his allegiance to the new emperor and was soon sent to guard Sicily against the Vandals; perhaps at this time he held the title of magister militum. Marcellinus was to take part in a joint attack of Vandal Africa, with him coming from Sicily and Majorian invading from Spain, but before Majorian could begin his campaign the Vandals inflicted a severe defeat on the attack fleet and a year later in 461 the emperor was murdered by Ricimer, who soon after tried to bribe Marcellinus' troops who were mostly Huns, attempting to reduce the generals power.Priscus of Panium, fragment 29 This forced Marcellinus to leave Sicily and return to Dalmatia where he would work closely with the Eastern Emperor Leo I.PLRE II, pp 709 In 464 or 465 Marcellinus returned to Sicily to defend the island against the Vandals,Hydatius Chronicon, 227 this action posed a direct threat to the personal power and prestige of Ricimer who had already appealed to Leo to prevent Marcellinus from acting against him militarily. Leo recognized Marcellinus as magister militum but not by Ricimer and his new puppet emperor Libius Severus in the West. His title seems to have changed around this time to that of magister militum Dalmatiae though it is not for certain, only that his nephew who took over for him after held this title. During this time his power seems to have grown and it was possible he could attack Italy, but at the request of the Italians, the eastern court sent an envoy to him and he agreed not to attack. In the spring of 467 he was one of the comites who accompanied the new emperor of the West, Anthemius, to Italy with a large army.Hydatius, 234 In 468 we see him with the title of patrician which was given to him by Anthemius. Some explaining needs to be said here, since at this time Ricimer still held the titles magister utriusque militum and patrician,PLRE II, pp 1288 and it appears Atheminus wished for Marcellinus to have the similar power held by Ricimer in order to be a counterbalance to him. In the East, it was established practice for both magistri militum praesentales to be equal but in the West it had become common for one magister, (usually the magister peditum), to be superior over the other and so this may have been an attempt by Anthemius to introduce the eastern structure and rule like an eastern emperor using the successful and trustworthy Marcellinus as his second commander.O'Flynn, Generalissimos of the Western Roman Empire, pp 116-117. Death In 468, Leo organized a grand campaign against the Vandals in Africa in which the East and West would commit substantial forces. Marcellinus was given command of the forces from the western empire and the campaign was to be a three-pronged assault. Marcellinus by this time had expelled the Vandals from Sicily and had also retaken Sardinia and was to be taken by fleet to Africa. Basiliscus, Leo's brother-in- law, with the main army in an armada of over 1,000 ships would land at a distance from Carthage and link up with the comes rei militis Heraclius advancing from Egypt and Tripolitana. Marcellinus was supposed to have a command of some 10,000 to 20,000 troops.Stephin Williams and Gerard Friell, The Rome That Did Not Fall: Survival of the East in the fifth century, pp. 178 Marcellinus never sailed for Africa, perhaps due to Ricimer's veto; either he would not spare so many troops to become bogged in a campaign in Africa hoping the East would do the job for him, or he resented the military capabilities of Marcellinus who was obviously the favorite of Anthemius. Regardless of the reason, Marcellinus, not able to participate in the campaign and Basiliscus blundering in the Battle of Cape Bon, assured that the operation would result in failure and the West lost its only chance to regain Africa from the Vandals and possibly stave off its demise. Marcellinus was murdered in Sicily that same year, possibly by Ricimer's order. After his death, his nephew, Julius Nepos inherited his uncle's control over Dalmatia and was recorded as having the title magister militum Dalmatiae.PLRE II, pp. 777 Dalmatia would serve Julius Nepos in the same fashion as it had Marcellinus and due to the prestige and ability of Julius Nepos, the Eastern Emperor Leo I would push for him to be the new Western Emperor in 474. Source of power A topic of much debate concerns Marcellinus' source of power, mainly the forces under his command. This aspect becomes important in understanding his role as a player in the political and military theater of the Western Empire. A noteworthy comment on his army is that his troops were said to have always been well- equipped;Damascius, Epitome Photiana, 91. to say that in an age when the armies in the west were declining this becomes especially important. As the comes rei militaris Dalmatiae Marcellinus had a substantial fleet at his disposal which was based at Salona, and which would become of great importance in his career. From giving him the necessary means to threaten Italy with invasion, his ability to invade and secure Sicily on two occasions and from whence he accompanied Anthemius with an army from the East as well as forces of his own to install Anthemius as Emperor. As for his land forces, we know for certain he had Hunnic troops.Wozniak,East Rome, Ravenna and Western Illyricum pp. 357.O'Flynn, Generalissmos pp. 116. But it is not clear if these were federate forces or mercenaries. Regardless of which one they are, it not surprising he had Huns in his army since break up of the Hunnic Empire came in 454. He also had manpower to draw on from north of the Sava River and from traditional recruiting grounds in the Dalmatian interior. Perhaps most important of all, and the source of the \\"well-equipped\\" phrase is that Marcellinus had within his region the Imperial arms factory of Dalmatia and a naval arsenal at Salona and access to mining resources of lead in Domavia and iron in the Sava Valley. Due to the geography of Dalmatia which deterred approach from land (for the coastal cities), and his control of the Adriatic Marcellinus was quite unassailable which allowed him to become very active in major areas of the West. Coniuratio Marcellana Marcellinus may have been the individual of topic in the so-called coniuratio Marcellana in 457;Sidonius Apollinaris, Epistulae III.6 this may have been a movement in Gaul after the death of Avitus in late 456/early 457 to put Marcellinus on the throne. Nothing; however, suggests that he himself favored the idea. There is controversy in the academic world though as to who is really the topic of the machinations of the Gallo-Romano Aristocracy after the death of Avitus who was of Gallic origin and from amongst their own ranks. Many scholars old and new have either read the name of the event Marcellini, Marcelliniana instead of Marcellana.Mathisen, R. W. 'Resistance and Reconciliation; Majorian and the Gallic Aristocracy after the Fall of Avitus', Francia, 7: 599 This does not make much sense to place Marcellinus as the person in question for this action of the Gallic aristocracy since he is not Gallic and most likely comes from a wealthy Dalmatian family. The assumption to place Marcellinus as the person being spoken of has only led others to assume then that he is Gallic in origin when there is absolutely no evidence to support this. Mathisen has shown that Marcellinus cannot be the person in question and that Apollinaris Sidonius was speaking of a Marcellus, who was a Gallic aristocrat. He demonstrates why Marcellinus cannot logically be the person in question by comparing other names written by the same author and showing that Sidonius using the same style in writing the names thus giving the support it is Marcellus not Marcellinus he speaks of.Mathisen, 'Resistance and Reconciliation', 599-603 NotesReferences *John Martindale, John R.

These same tools can also apply to individuals' relations with other institutions and organizations. The term appeared in ComputerWorld magazine in May 2000,ComputerWorld May 2000 albeit in the context of a business managing its IT vendors.Vendor Relationship Management: The Role of Shared History And the Value of Return on Trust, Eric K. Clemons, Elizabeth T. Gray, jr., 27 June 2000 The term was first used in the context here by Mike Vizard on a Gillmor Gang podcastGillmor Gang: VRM Gang Part I on September 1, 2006, in a conversation with Doc Searls about the project Searls had recently started as a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. Vizard saw VRM as a natural counterpart of customer relationship management. Searls' project then became named ProjectVRM, and has since worked to guide the development of VRM tools and services. VRM tools provide customers with the means to bear their share of the relationship burden with vendors and other organizations. They relieve CRM of the perceived need to \\"target,\\" \\"capture,\\" \\"acquire,\\" \\"lock in,\\" \\"direct,\\" \\"own,\\" \\"manage,\\" and otherwise take the lead of relationships with customers. With VRM operating on the customer's side, customers are also involved as participants, rather than as followers. In its description of ProjectVRM,ProjectVRM page at the Berkman Center for Internet & Society the Berkman Center says \\"The primary theory behind ProjectVRM is that many market problems (including the widespread belief that customer lock-in is a 'best practice') can only be solved from the customer side: by making the customer a fully empowered actor in the marketplace, rather than one whose power in many cases is dependent on exclusive relationships with vendors, by coerced agreement provided entirely by those vendors.\\" Doc Searls believes VRM will help create what he calls an intention economy, which he described first in an essayThe Intention Economy, in the March 8, 2006 issue of Linux Journal by that name in Linux Journal. There, he writes, \\"The Intention Economy grows around buyers, not sellers. It leverages the simple fact that buyers are the first source of money, and that they come ready-made. You don't need advertising to make them. The Intention Economy is about markets, not marketing. You don't need marketing to make Intention Markets.\\" In May 2012 Searl's book titled The Intention Economy was published by Harvard Business Press. Searls also sees VRM addressing some of what he calls the \\"unfinished business\\"It's Not Your Relationship to Manage, by Lauren McKay, in CRM Magazine, May 2010 of The Cluetrain Manifesto, which he co-wrote in 1999 with Christopher Locke, Rick Levine and David Weinberger.

The modern usage of this term was popularized by United States presidents George W. Bush, George H. W. Bush, and Ronald Reagan. History=Origins Similar to \\"cut and run\\", a pejorative phrase used to describe cowardly withdrawal from battle, \\"stay the course\\" allegedly originated as a nautical metaphor on maintaining a constant, unaltering course while navigating. For instance, in a 2003 column, William Safire asked his readers what they knew of its origins, saying it \\"appears to be rooted in a nautical metaphor.\\" In this context 'stay' refers to the ropes or guys and sheets that hold the 'course' (mainsail) in a fixed position appropriate to the heading. Citations from the late 19th century, however, show the phrase describing horses having the stamina to remain on the course of a racetrack. Safire found the same, writing that the earliest such use found was for an 1873 rowing competition. Safire's correspondent, lexicographer Benjamin Zimmer, pointed out that before that, \\"citations for 'stay the course' invariably have the countervailing sense of 'to stop or check the course (of something).'\\" Elizabethan playwright Christopher Marlowe used it in that sense in The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus in 1588. The phrase has had fitful use in American politics. It was used by several figures during the Vietnam War, including Gen. William Westmoreland, who wrote in his 1976 autobiography A Soldier Reports that \\"a lack of determination to stay the course...demonstrated in Cambodia, South Vietnam, and Laos that the alternative to victory was defeat.\\" It had been invoked during wartime by President Lyndon Johnson in a 1967 speech'\\"America is committed to the defense of South Vietnam until an honorable peace can be negotiated,\\" Johnson told the Tennessee Legislature on March 15, 1967. Despite the obstacles to victory, the president said, \\"We shall stay the course.\\"' and by Johnson's Undersecretary of the Air Force Townsend Hoopes. The phrase gained a central place in rhetoric due to the publication by journalist Stewart Alsop in his 1973 memoirs of a conversation with Winston Churchill. Alsop related that the British Prime Minister had pondered at the close of World War II, \\"America, it is a great and strong country, like a workhorse pulling the rest of the world out of despond and despair. But will it stay the course?\\" The anecdote became a favorite of Democratic hawk Sen. Henry Jackson, and was retold by Secretary of Defense William Cohen more than once during his tenure. \\"Stay the course\\" was later popularized by Ronald Reagan while campaigning for Republicans during the 1982 mid-term elections, arguing against changes in his economic policies. According to the Washington Post, Reagan used the \\"stay the course\\" phrase while on a ten-day political campaign through fourteen states, and it was included in his 1982 budget message, where he sought to allay fears that his policies were causing a recession. He continued using it as a slogan through the November election. His Vice-President, George H.W. Bush, would later pick up the phrase as an argument for his election as President, both during the primaries and general campaign. His over-use of the phrase was parodied in a Saturday Night Live sketch. George W. Bush The phrase was first used by Bush II in July 2003 while in Gaborone, Botswana, after a meeting with President Festus Gontebanye Mogae to discuss the War on Terrorism. Bush, along with Vice President Dick Cheney and White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan, continually used the term afterwards to describe the Iraq War, stressing that the freedoms of the Iraqi people were at stake and that al-Qaeda would \\"use Iraq as an example of defeating freedom and democracy\\" if the United States were to withdraw. However, the phrase was eventually dropped by Bush two weeks before the 2006 U.S. midterm elections, due to continual pressure to change his Iraq War strategy. Tony Snow has stated that this only meant that the United States needed to adjust its strategy in Iraq, and that it was not a sign of any major changes in policy. On the other hand, in an interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News's This Week, Bush stated that \\"we've never been stay the course\\", in response to a question asking him about his thoughts on James Baker‚Äôs comments that the strategy in Iraq should be \\"between 'stay the course' and 'cut and run'.\\" Popular culture The phrase has been repeatedly parodied by political cartoonists, ranging from animator Mark Fiore to Chip Bok of the Akron Beacon Journal. It has also been parodied by numerous television shows, such as The Colbert Report and Saturday Night Live. The phrase was also used in Pixar's movie WALL-E (2008) in a message to Axiom from the CEO of Earth, John Conner in Terminator: Salvation has the line, \\"If we stay the course we are dead, all dead!\\", and is a recurring phrase in the 2000 film The Patriot (2000). In music, Epica's song \\"Stay The Course\\" (from Requiem for the Indifferent) is a criticism of this policy and of the popular culture surrounding its use.

It is the seat of the administrative district (gmina) called Gmina Radk√≥w, close to the Czech border. As at 2019, the town has a population of 2,406. Geography It lies in the K≈Çodzko Valley at the foot of the Table Mountains, approximately north-west of K≈Çodzko, and south-west of the regional capital Wroc≈Çaw. It is located within the historic K≈Çodzko Land. History Renaissance town hall The settlement probably already existed in the 11th century. In the High Middle Ages, together with the K≈Çodzko Land, it changed affiliation several times, passing between Poland and Bohemia.Jan Rzo≈Ñca, Uzdrowiska ziemi k≈Çodzkiej, \\"Ziemia K≈Çodzka\\" No. 223, 2013, p. 26 (in Polish) A church at the site was first mentioned in 1290. That same year, after the death of Polish duke Henryk IV Probus K≈Çodzko Land passed to Bohemia. It was granted town rights around 1320-1333. From 1327 to 1341 it was placed under the rule of Polish dukes from the Piast dynasty (within the duchies of Wroc≈Çaw and Ziƒôbice) and in 1348 it was incorporated to the Bohemian Crown Lands. By 1373 the town had a mayor and in the early 15th century defensive walls were built.Waldemar Brygier, G√≥ry Sto≈Çowe. Przewodnik, Oficyna Wydawnicza Rewasz, Pruszk√≥w, 2010, p. 193 (in Polish) Then in 1418 it received new privileges from King Wenceslaus IV, which equated its town rights with those of K≈Çodzko and granted the title of a royal city. In the following decades, the town was devastated by Hussite troops in 1425 as well as by the Hungarian forces of king Matthias Corvinus in 1469. In the 15th century, crafts flourished, local cloths were exported to other countries, while 85 of all 86 houses had the right to brew beer.Brygier, Op. cit., p. 194 With the County of Kladsko, it turned Protestant by the mid-16th century and was affected by the Counter- Reformation in the Habsburg Monarchy as well as the devastations of the Thirty Years' War, when it was captured by the Austrians in 1621, the Swedes in 1632, and it was struck by epidemics in 1625 and 1633. In the First Silesian War (1740-42), the town was conquered and annexed by King Frederick II of Prussia. The picturesque setting attracted Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who spent a few days here in August 1790. From 1815 onwards, it was incorporated into the Prussian Silesia Province. From the late 19th century onwards, the W√ºnschelburg sandstone pits supplied notable buildings like the Berlin Reichstag via the new Eulengebirgsbahn railway line to ≈öcinawka ≈örednia (then Mittelsteine). After the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II, the area fell to the Republic of Poland according to the 1945 Potsdam Agreement, while the German population was expelled.

After the Japanese surrender, he was tried by Britain and later Australia for war crimes. He was executed in the then Australian territory of Papua and New Guinea. Nishimura was a native of Fukuoka prefecture. Early military career Nishimura was a graduate of the 22nd class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1910, and subsequently attended Army Engineering School. He graduated from the 32nd class of the Army Staff College in 1920. He served most of his career in various staff and administrative posts within the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff. Nishimura served as presiding judge at the court-martial of army officers responsible for the assassination of Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi in 1932. The defendants all received light sentences. For this he was apparently rewarded later with command of the Imperial Guards Division, a prestigious post. From 1936‚Äì1938, Nishimura was commander of the 9th Infantry Regiment, and from 1938‚Äì1939 commanded the 1st Heavy Field Artillery Brigade. He became Chief of Staff of the Eastern Defense Army from 1939‚Äì1940.Steen Ammenthorp, The Generals of World War II Promoted to Major General in 1940, Nishimura was commander of the Indochina Expeditionary Army in the invasion of French Indochina in 1940. Nishimura was promoted to Lieutenant General in 1941. World War II During 1941, Nishimura commanded the 21st Independent Mixed Brigade, and then the Imperial Guard Division during the Malayan campaign. During the Battle of Muar, the Imperial Guards killed 155 Australian and Indian prisoners of war in an event known as the Parit Sulong Massacre. Following the surrender of Allied forces in Singapore, Nishimura was in charge of the eastern half of Singapore Island, during the period in which the Sook Ching massacre took place. Nishimura himself was often at odds with the commander of the 25th Army, General Tomoyuki Yamashita, at times engaging in conduct that seemed deliberately insulting.Kent Budge, The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia As a result, his division was denied the Emperor's Victory Citation, and he was recalled to Japan and forced to retire in April 1942. From June 1943 ‚Äì February 1944, Nishimura was appointed governor of the Shan States in northern Burma. From February 1944, Nishimura was appointed Japanese military Governor of Sumatra, a post he held until the end of the war. Trials for war crimes After the end of the war, Nishimura was tried by a British military tribunal in Singapore for the events related to the Sook Ching massacre. He was found guilty of war crimes, and was sentenced to life imprisonment, of which he served four years in Singapore before being sent back to Tokyo to complete his sentence. As he was being repatriated to Japan, Nishimura was forcibly removed from a ship at Hong Kong by Australian military police and brought before an Australian military tribunal on Manus Island, where he was charged with events in connection to the Parit Sulong Massacre. Evidence was presented stating that Nishimura had ordered the shootings at Parit Sulong and the destruction of bodies. Nishimura was found guilty and was executed by hanging on 11 June 1951. In 1996, Australian journalist Ian Ward suggested that the Australian Army prosecutor, Captain James Godwin‚Äîa former Royal New Zealand Navy pilot who had been ill- treated as a POW in Sumatra‚Äîhad \\"manipulated\\" evidence to implicate Nishimura. Ward's impressions were prompted by fabricated evidence from a U.S. lobbyist seeking compensation for Japanese POWs.Ian Ward, Snaring the Other Tiger (Media Masters Publishers, Singapore, 1996) Ward also claimed that Godwin took no action on the testimony of Lieutenant Fujita Seizaburo, who reportedly stated that he was responsible for the Parit Sulong massacre.

An Australian international and Queensland State of Origin representative , he played in the Brisbane Broncos first five Grand Final victories in 1992, 1993, 1997 Super League, 1998 and 2000. At the time of his retirement from football in Australia in 2000 he held the Broncos' club records for most career appearances. He played out the rest of his career in England with the Salford City Reds and retired in 2002. Early career Hancock started out playing in the under 16's/18's and A Grade in the Toowoomba rugby league for the Stanthorpe Gremlins.http://stanthorpegremlins.com.au/about A young from Stanthorpe, Queensland, Hancock starred as a 17-year-old for the Toowoomba Clydesdales in the Winfield State League. First grade career In 1988, Hancock joined the Brisbane Broncos for the club's initial season in the New South Wales Rugby League premiership as a member of the first Brisbane run-on team that thrashed defending premiers the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles 44‚Äì10 in 1988's season opener at Brisbane's Lang Park in a side that included representative players Wally Lewis (captain), Colin Scott, Joe Kilroy, Gene Miles, Allan Langer, Bryan Niebling, Greg Dowling and Greg Conescu. In 1989, Hancock made his d√©but for the Queensland Maroons, becoming the then-youngest footballer of either state to play in a State of Origin series and scored two tries in the 36‚Äì6 win over NSW at Lang Park. He then made his Test d√©but on the 1989 mid-season tour of New Zealand while still a teenager. Having already represented his state in all three matches of that year‚Äôs Origin series, he also played in all six matches on the New Zealand tour, scoring three tries. He played in all three Tests against the Kiwis and scored his first try in test football in Australia's 8‚Äì0 win in the second test at the Rotorua International Stadium on 16 July. He was known for his strength, elusiveness and a wide-legged running style that allowed him to change direction sharply and sometimes several times as he approached opposition defences. Hancock was named the 1989 Brisbane Broncos season's rookie of the year. 1990s In 1990 Hancock missed the one- off Test against France with a hamstring injury, but regained his spot on the wing for the test against New Zealand in Wellington where he scored a try in Australia's 24‚Äì6 win. He was then selected for the 1990 Kangaroo Tour of Great Britain and France at the end of the 1990 NSWRL season. Unfortunately, an ankle injury suffered in Australia's 19‚Äì14 loss to Great Britain in the first test loss at Wembley, London limited him to just six games on the English leg of the tour and he lost his test spot to Broncos teammate Dale Shearer. The first test loss was something of a disaster for Hancock as his opposite winger Paul Eastwood crossed for two of the Lions three tries on the day. Although he returned to action, before the second Ashes series test, scoring a try in a 36‚Äì18 win over Halifax, Shearer's form was such (scoring a try in the Aussies 14‚Äì10 win at Old Trafford in the second test) that Hancock was unable to regain his test spot for the remainder of the tour. In 1991 he was overlooked for the mid-season Trans Tasman tests against New Zealand, nor could he gain a spot on the end of season tour of Papua New Guinea. He later regained his Test spot and played in all three Ashes tests against Great Britain during the 1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand, helping Australia retain The Ashes. At the end of the year Hancock was a member of the Broncos team that defeated the St George Dragons 28‚Äì8 in the 1992 Winfield Cup Grand Final. He then traveled to England where he played on the wing in Australia's 10‚Äì6 win over Great Britain in the 1992 World Cup Final in front of 73,631 fans at Wembley Stadium, London. Hancock had a solid game in the WCF, keeping St. Helens winger Alan Hunte quiet. A week after the Final, Hancock scored two tries in Brisbane's 22‚Äì8 victory over English champions Wigan in the 1992 World Club Challenge at Central Park. In winning the Broncos became the first Australian team to win the World Club Challenge on British soil. Hancock made his second tour of New Zealand in 1993, playing all three tests of the 1993 Trans-Tasman series and scoring his 5th and final test try in the third test at Lang Park. He played in Brisbane's second consecutive premiership win in 1993, again defeating St George in the Grand Final. During the 1994 NSWRL season, Hancock played at centre for Brisbane when they lost 20‚Äì14 against Wigan in the 1994 World Club Challenge in front of a WCC record attendance of 54,220 at Brisbane's ANZ Stadium. Michael Hancock played his last test for Australia in 1994 against France in a 58‚Äì0 win at the Parramatta Stadium in Sydney. Called into the team after injury ruled out Broncos teammate Willie Carne, Hancock didn't score in the game but made a number of breaks and almost always had the hapless French grasping at air trying to tackle him. After being selected for his second Kangaroo Tour in 1994, his test career ended when he injured his shoulder in a training mishap only a week before the first Ashes test at Wembley. In a case of D√©j√† vu with 1990, he would return to the field before the tour ended, but wasn't able to regain his test place either on tour or in the following years. 2000s The advent of the unlimited interchange rule prolonged Hancock's career, with coach Wayne Bennett opting to use him as an impact player on the wing or in the . The last of the foundation players to leave the club, it was only fitting then, in his fourteenth season with the same club, that he left the Broncos after the 14‚Äì6 victory over the Sydney Roosters in the 2000 NRL grand final to play out the rest of his career for Salford in England. Also in 2000 Hancock was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in the sport of rugby league. At the time of his retirement, he held the record for most appearances for the Broncos and was number two on the club's all-time top try-scorers list with 120 (second only to Steve Renouf's 142). Post-playing In 2003, Hancock was one of the first four former players inducted into the Broncos official Hall of Fame. During the 2007 season at the Broncos' 20-year anniversary celebration, the club announced a list of the 20 best players to play for them to date which included Hancock. In 2008, rugby league in Australia's centenary year, Hancock was named on the wing in the Toowoomba and South West Team of the Century. Hancock has been involved in rugby league development encouraging children to take up the sport.http://m.nrl.com/where-are-they-now-michael- hancock/tabid/10874/newsid/62357/default.aspx ReferencesExternal links Michael Hancock at yesterdayshero.com.au *Michael Hancock at nrlstats.com 1969 births Australia national rugby league team players Salford Red Devils players Brisbane Broncos players Queensland Rugby League State of Origin players Rugby league wingers Recipients of the Australian Sports Medal Rugby league players from Queensland Living people ","title":"Michael Hancock (rugby league)"},{"id":"9533553","text":"Elbridge Township is one of fifteen townships in Edgar County, Illinois, USA.

The play has been described as \\"swift of action, exciting of episode, fertile of surprise, and genuinely poetic.\\"Arthur Huntington Nason James Shirley, Dramatist: A Biographical and Critical Study, New York, 1915; reprinted New York, Benjamin Blom, 1967; p. 321. The play dates from the Irish phase of Shirley's dramatic career (1636-40), and was acted at the Werburgh Street Theatre, most likely in 1638, under its alternative Rosania title. After Shirley's return to London (April 1640), the play was licensed for performance by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, still as Rosania (June 1, 1640), and was performed at the Globe Theatre by the King's Men. (In the play's Prologue, Shirley comments on how \\"vast\\" the stage of the Globe is, compared to the small private theatre in Dublin where the work premiered.) The title was changed by the time the play was included in a general list of works belonging to the King's Men (1641).Terence P. Logan and Denzell S.

The play was published in the octavo volume Six New Plays, issued by the booksellers Humphrey Moseley and Humphrey Robinson in 1653. In that volume the play is dedicated by Shirley to Sir Edmund Bowier. For the plot of his play, Shirley exploited Tirso de Molina's El Castigo del Pens√©que, a source he had previously employed for his The Opportunity.

Synopsis Olivia, the Queen of Murcia, is engaged to marry Leonario, the prince of Aragon. The wedding plans are disrupted by an invasion: Ferdinand claims to be the Queen's cousin and the rightful heir to the throne. Leonario leads an army against the pretender and brings him back a captive. Ferdinand is accompanied by his page, Tiberio -- who is actually Ferdinand's fiancee Rosania in disguise. On trial for treason, Ferdinand courageously maintains his claim to the throne. Olivia is impressed with him, falls in love with him, and commands a recess in the trial as she leaves the courtroom. Leonario and the nobles are prepared to sentence the apparent usurper, but the Queen prevents and reproves them. She states that investigation may yet validate Ferdinand's claim, and has him escort her from the court, to the general consternation of her supporters. Olivia soon marries Ferdinand -- but finds him neglectful, and becomes irate and jealous. She questions \\"Tiberio\\" about potential mistresses; when Ferdinand arrives, Olivia tries to provoke his jealousy by flirting with Tiberio/Rosania, and then leaves them together. Ferdinand confesses that he agreed to the wedding only to allow a chance for them to escape, and has avoided consummation of the marriage. Rosania is willing to leave Ferdinand to Olivia, but Fredinand will not accept this; he prevails on \\"Tiberio\\" to obey the Queen's summons to her chamber, and to leave the resolution of the problem in his hands. While Olivia is courting \\"Tiberio,\\" Fredinand barges into her suite with courtiers in an effort to expose her. Olivia, however, brazens out her predicament, while her maid is in the next room disguising \\"Tiberio\\" as a woman. As the confrontation between Olivia and Ferdinand is coming to a head, one of Leonario's spies drops a bombshell: the page is in fact a woman, and Ferdinand's fiancee. Back in jail, Ferdinand awaits execution. Suddenly, though, he is acknowledged and acclaimed as the rightful king by the chancellor and other nobles. It was the chancellor who rescued Ferdinand from a ruthless uncle during infancy and enabled his escape. Ferdinand becomes king in his own right, and publicly recognizes Rosania as his future queen; Olivia's unsullied honor leaves her a fit mate for Leonario. But Leonario has a plan of his own: in a surprise attack he and his forces take the palace and capture the new King and his court. Ferdinand is condemned to death yet again, and Leonario leads Olivia to the altar; yet the victorious army's general rips off his false beard to reveal himself as Ferdinand's old guardian and Rosania's father. The army that appeared to back Leonario is in fact a force from Valencia sent to reinforce Ferdinand. The rightful King Ferdinand and his new Queen Rosania triumph in the end.

He played for the New York Mets, Minnesota Twins, Milwaukee Brewers, Houston Astros, Texas Rangers and Tampa Bay Rays. G√≥mez is a two-time MLB All-Star and a Gold Glove Award winner. Professional career=Minor leagues At just 16 years of age, G√≥mez signed with the New York Mets as an international free agent on July 27, 2002. Along with Fernando Mart√≠nez, G√≥mez was considered one of their top outfield prospects, and was considered to be a five-tool prospect. While they were teammates, Mets shortstop Jos√© Reyes, who led the National League in stolen bases and triples for multiple seasons, said that G√≥mez was faster than he was. In fact, while he and G√≥mez were teammates with the Mets, G√≥mez routinely beat him in foot races during spring training. In 2006, G√≥mez played for the Double-A Binghamton Mets of the Eastern League and was the co-winner of the Sterling Award. He finished second in the league with 41 stolen bases and fifth in the league with eight triples. He batted .281 (121‚Äì430) with 53 runs scored, 24 doubles, seven home runs and 48 runs batted in. G√≥mez started the 2007 season with the Triple-A New Orleans Zephyrs. Playing every day, by the second week of May he led the Pacific Coast League (PCL) with 17 stolen bases in 36 games and hit .286 (40-for-140), scoring 24 runs, and hitting eight doubles, two triples, and two home runs. New York Mets in 2007 spring training New York Mets G√≥mez made his major league debut with the Mets on May 13, 2007. At 21 years and 205 days old, he became the youngest player in the National League. In his first season, G√≥mez hit .232 with 2 home runs and 12 RBIs in 139 at bats. Minnesota Twins When pitcher Johan Santana of the Minnesota Twins became available via trade, the Mets traded G√≥mez and pitchers Deolis Guerra, Philip Humber and Kevin Mulvey to the Twins to acquire him on January 29, 2008. G√≥mez became the starting center fielder for the Twins, following Torii Hunter's signing with the Los Angeles Angels. He won a three-way race for center field in 2008, beating out prospects Denard Span and Jason Pridie. G√≥mez's 40-yard dash time was clocked at 4.29. Twins manager Ron Gardenhire nicknamed G√≥mez \\"Go-Go\\" due to his last name and his blazing speed. Batting first, with Alexi Casilla batting second, Gardenhire referred to the speedy duo as \\"Loose Cannon One\\" and \\"Loose Cannon Two.\\" Minnesota Twins in 2009 G√≥mez had an excellent regular-season debut for the Twins, going 2-for-3 with a walk, two stolen bases and two runs as the Twins beat the Angels, 3‚Äì2.

During the 2011 postseason, G√≥mez hit .357, with 1 home run and 2 RBIs. In 2012, G√≥mez started the season platooning with Nyjer Morgan and Norichika Aoki in center field, but eventually G√≥mez got more starting playing time. G√≥mez ended up having the best season of his major league career at that point. G√≥mez had career highs with a .260 batting average, .305 on-base percentage, 19 home runs, and 37 stolen bases in the 2012 season. Prior to the 2013 season, G√≥mez signed a 3-year, $24 million extension with the Brewers. Milwaukee Brewers in 2013 G√≥mez started the 2013 season as the Brewers' starting center fielder, though he struggled early, batting only .162 after the first couple of weeks.

Mariano Rivera retired him to end the 8th inning in his last all-star game. On September 26, G√≥mez was suspended for one game for his role in an on-field altercation during a game on September 25 against the Atlanta Braves. In the game, G√≥mez hit a home run, and as he trotted around the bases, shouted at Braves pitcher Paul Maholm for apparently throwing at G√≥mez in an earlier game. As G√≥mez reached home plate, Braves catcher Brian McCann deliberately stood between G√≥mez and home plate, blocking him, which sparked a brief brawl between the two teams. G√≥mez's 2013 season was the best of his major league career, attaining career highs in practically every offensive  a .284 batting average, .338 on-base percentage, 27 doubles, 10 triples, 24 home runs, 80 runs scored, 73 RBIs, and 40 stolen bases.

G√≥mez began 2014 as Milwaukee's starting center fielder and leadoff hitter. In May, G√≥mez got into an altercation in a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates. In the game, G√≥mez hit a deep fly ball that he initially thought was a home run. As a result, he flipped his bat out of his hand, something he was known to do when hitting a home run. The ball ended up hitting the outfield wall, though G√≥mez still ended up at third base with a triple. When Pirates pitcher Gerrit Cole confronted G√≥mez about showing off, the two began to argue, and as the two were separated, Pirates player Travis Snider confronted G√≥mez as well, causing G√≥mez to throw punches at Snider, igniting a brief brawl in which Snider got hit in the eye by G√≥mez' teammate, Martin Maldonado. G√≥mez was suspended for three games. He initially appealed the suspension, but dropped it after suffering a minor back injury, using the time for the suspension to rest his back. Upon his return, G√≥mez was moved to the clean-up spot in the Brewers batting order, due to an injury to Aramis Ram√≠rez. G√≥mez had another solid season in 2014, batting .284 with 23 home runs, 73 RBIs, 95 runs scored, and 34 stolen bases, though he was also caught stealing a career- high 12 times.

Written in English \\"in a matter of weeks\\" in 1932 when Beckett was only 26 and living in Paris, the clearly autobiographical novel was rejected by publishers and shelved by the author. The novel was eventually published in 1992, three years after the author's death. Partial publication Three fragments from the book were published during Beckett's lifetime: \\"Text\\" and \\"Sedendo et Quiescendo\\" were actually published before he started working on the book and subsequently became part of it, whilst \\"Jem Higgins' Love-Letter to the Alba\\" was published in 1965. Beckett refused however to allow the entire novel to be published during his lifetime, on the grounds that it was \\"immature and unworthy\\": his biographer Deirdre Bair believes that his reluctance to make it available to the reading public was to avoid offending lifelong friends whom Beckett satirised in the book. Setting and influences The novel is set in the town of Kassel, Germany, where 17-year-old Peggy Sinclair, a cousin of Beckett, lived with her parents. Beckett made several visits in Kassel 1928‚Äì32. The main character Belacqua, a writer and teacher, is very similar to Beckett himself, though a character named \\"Mr. Beckett\\" also makes an appearance in the book. Belacqua's name is taken from the character created by Dante. Influences on the novel include Geoffrey Chaucer's The Legend of Good Women, Alfred Tennyson's \\"A Dream of Fair Women\\" and Henry Williamson's The Dream of Fair Women. Themes Two main themes can be found in the Dream: a rejection of realism in characters and the novel itself;P Stewart, Zone of Evaporation (2006) p. 41-2 and an anti-feminism,K Ince ed., Samuel Beckett (London 2000) p. 74 or perhaps an anti-sexuality, disavowing the possibility of sexual relations. The narrator explicitly criticises such realist figures as Balzac and Jane Austen, for their rigid characters and spurious novelistic coherence;P Stewart, Zone of Evaporation (2006) p. 41 and p. 60 but also challenges Proust‚Äôs exploitation of involuntary memory, and his metaphoric method of approach.P Stewart, Zone of Evaporation (2006) p. 21 and 42 At the same time, the work is concerned with a sense of the body as a machine that is broken;Y Tajiri, Samuel Beckett and the Prosthetic Body (2006) p. 5 and with male sexuality as oscillating between Apollo and Narcissus. ‚ÄúWe give you one term of Apollo: chasing a bitch, the usual bitch. And one term of Narcissus: running away from one‚Äù.Dream, quoted in K Ince ed., Samuel Beckett (London 2000) p. 196 Both themes come together in a rejection both of a realist world, and of a unified self to be found in sexual relations.K Ince ed., Samuel Beckett (London 2000) p. 73-4 See also *More Pricks than Kicks *Proust (Beckett essay) ReferencesExternal links * Beckett¬¥s visits in Kassel,Germany, incl. picture of Peggy Sinclair * Autobiographical aspects 1932 novels 1992 novels Novels by Samuel Beckett Novels about writers Autobiographical novels ","title":"Dream of Fair to Middling Women"},{"id":"9533651","text":"The Royal Institute of Oil Painters, also known as ROI, is an association of painters in London, England, and is the only major art society which features work done only in oil.

It was founded in 1992 and offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in a variety of professional fields including law, medicine, business, and engineering. While most degree programs include English language requirements, Spanish is the language of instruction for all courses except those offered by UAM College. The university website cites that more than 5,000 students have graduated from UAM since its founding. History The American University (UAM) was founded in 1992, by a group of university professors with vast experience in the teaching research and administrative field, with the purpose of devoting to the development of higher education in Nicaragua. On November 26, 1992, The National Council of Universities (CNU) approved UAM officially, and conferred its national recognition.  Departments  As of May 2020, the following departments offered degree programs at American University: * Department of Medicine * Department of Dentistry * Department of Juridical Sciences and International Relations * Department of Marketing, Design, and Communication Sciences * Department of Administrative and Economic Sciences * Department of Engineering and Architecture * UAM College  UAM College  Founded in 1998, UAM College is categorized as a distinct department within American University. While it offers many of the same undergraduate degree programs offered by other departments, it is often distinguished because all courses are taught in English. In addition, many UAM College professors hold doctoral degrees in their fields. Taken together, these attributes are meant to ensure that a UAM College degree is equal in quality with degrees earned in the United States. Due to the design of its programs, UAM College has welcomed many international exchange students in previous years. It has also become a popular option for students that hope to transfer to universities abroad after completing core courses. However, many students choose to start and finish their degrees at UAM College; since its founding, more than 300 students have graduated from the department UAM College currently offers five major degree programs: * Natural Resource Management * Global Finance * Strategic Marketing * Global Management * International Development Besides these major degree programs, students can choose from a list of minors including: Business Law, Economics, Entrepreneurship, Environmental Issues, Finance, International Development, Management, and Strategic Marketing. Students may further narrow their focus within their minor program of study by choosing a concentration, those of which include: Tourism Development, Outsourcing Management, Natural Resource Management, Integrated Marketing, Environmental Issues, Education, and Branding and Communications. UAM College was founded as the \\"Business Administration Faculty\\" and was known by this name until 2010, when its title changed to the \\"College of University Studies in English.\\" Its current name, UAM College, was adopted in 2017.  Language Center  The mission of the Language Center is to \\"contribute to the training of professionals with language competency in English, with a multicultural vision that will allow them to interact and effectively develop in different spheres of their daily and professional lives.\\" The Language Center currently offers two English- language programs. The first, English for Global Success (EGS), is geared towards helping learners age 16+ develop sufficient language proficiency to score a B2 on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). The program is composed of fourteen levels, each of which correspond to two months of Saturday instruction. The second program, English for Global Leaders, is oriented towards business executives and other professionals and prepares participants to score a B2 on the CEFR. The program consists of fifteen levels, each of which corresponds to one month of Monday-Thursday instruction. Besides these two programs, the Language Center also offers corporate classes catered to the needs of private businesses.

Diphyllobothriasis mostly occurs in regions where raw fish is regularly consumed; those who consume raw fish are at risk of infection. The infection is often asymptomatic and usually presents only with mild symptoms, which may include gastrointestinal complaints, weight loss, and fatigue. Rarely, vitamin B12 deficiency (possibly leading to anaemia) and gastrointestinal obstructions may occur. Infection may be long-lasting in absence of treatment. Diphyllobothriasis is generally diagnosed by looking for eggs or tapeworm segments in passed stool. Treatment with antiparasitic medications is straightforward, effective, and safe.

Retrieved on April 14, 2009For symptoms of diphyllobothrium due to vitamin B12-deficiency University of Maryland Medical Center > Megaloblastic (Pernicious) Anemia Retrieved on April 14, 2009 Most infections (~80%) are asymptomatic. Infections may be long-lasting, persisting for many years or decades (up to 25 years) if untreated. Symptoms (when present) are generally mild. Manifestations may include: abdominal pain and discomfort, diarrhoea, vomiting, constipation, weight loss, and fatigue. Additional symptoms have been reported/described, including: dyspepsia, abdominal distension (commonly as presenting complaint), headache, myalgia, and dizziness.  Complications  While the infection is generally mild, complications may occur. Complications are predicated on parasite burden, and are generally related to vitamin B12 deficiency and related health conditions. = Vitamin B12 deficiency and anaemia = Vitamin B12 deficiency with subsequent megaloblastic anaemia (which is indistinguishable from pernicious anaemia) may occur in some instances of the disease.John, David T. and Petri, William A. (2006) Anaemia may in turn result in subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord and cognitive decline. D. latum competes with the host for vitamin B12 absorption, absorbing some 80% of dietary intake and causing deficiency and megaloblastic anaemia in some 40% of cases. Vitamin B12 uptake is enabled by the position of the parasite which usually lodges in the jejunum. Vitamin B12 deficiency is - according to research - conversely seldom seen in D. pacificum infection. = Gastrointestinal obstructions = Rarely, massive infections may result in intestinal obstruction. Migration of proglottids can cause cholecystitis or cholangitis.  Cause  Diphyllobothriasis is caused by infection by several species of the Diphyllobothrium genus.  Transmission  Humans are one of the definitive hosts of Diphyllobothrium tapeworms, along with other carnivores; fish-eating mammals (including canids, felids, and bears), marine mammals (dolphins, porpoises, and whales), and (a few) birds (e.g. gulls) may also serve as definitive hosts. Definitive hosts release eggs in faeces; the eggs then mature in ~18‚Äì20 days if under favourable conditions. Crustaceans serve as the first intermediate hosts, and Diphyllobothrium larvae develop. The larvae are released when crustaceans are consumed by predators, which serve as second intermediate hosts (these are mostly small fish). Larvae move into deeper tissues in the second intermediate host. Second intermediate hosts do not serve as an important source of infection of humans as these are not regularly consumed raw. Consumption of infected second intermediate hosts by larger predatory fish, which serve as paratenic hosts; the parasites thereupon migrate into the musculature awaiting consumption by definitive hosts in which adult tapeworms will then finally develop in the small intestine to release up to a million immature eggs per day per parasite. Hosts begin to release eggs 5‚Äì6 weeks after infection.  Pathophysiology  Tapeworms develop in the small intestine. Adults attach to the intestinal mucosa. Adult tapeworms may grow to over 10m in length and may constitute of over 3,000 proglottids which contain sets of male and female reproductive organs, allowing for high fecundity. Eggs appear in the faeces 5‚Äì6 weeks after infection. D. latum tapeworms are the longest and typically reach a length of 4-15m, but may grow up to 25m in length within the human intestine. Growth rate may exceed 22 cm/day. D. latum tapeworms feature an anterior end (scolex) equipped with attachment grooves on the dorsal and ventral surfaces.  Host-parasite interactions  Diphyllobothriasis is postulated to cause changes in neuromodulator concentrations in host tissue and serum. D. latum infection has been shown to cause local changes in the host, leading to altered GI function (including motility) via neuroendocrine modulation. Diphyllobothriasis causes mast cell and eosinophil degranulation, leading to pro-inflammatory cytokine release.  Diagnosis  Infection may be suspected based upon a patient's occupation, hobbies, eating habits, and travel history. During diagnostic procedures, standard safety precautions apply. Eggs are not directly infectious to humans (in contrast to some other tapeworm species).  Microscopy  Diagnosis is usually made by identifying proglottid segments, or characteristic eggs in the faeces.http://web.gideononline.com/web/epidemiology/ Eggs are usually numerous and can be demonstrated without concentration techniques. Morphologic comparison with other intestinal parasites may be employed as a further diagnostic approach. These simple diagnostic techniques are able to identify the nature of the infection to the genus level, which is usually sufficient in a clinical setting. Though it is difficult to identify the eggs or proglottids to the species level, the distinction is of little clinical importance because - like most adult tapeworms in the intestine - all members of the genus respond to the same treatments. Treatment may distort morphological features of expelled pathogen tissues and complicate subsequent morphological diagnosis attempts.  Genetic identification  When the exact species need be determined (e.g. in epidemiological studies), restriction fragment length polymorphisms can be effectively used. PCR can be performed on samples of purified eggs, or on native fecal samples following sonication of the eggs to release their contents. Molecular identification is currently generally only used in research.  Radiography  A potential diagnostic tool and treatment is the contrast medium gastrografin which, when introduced into the duodenum, allows both visualization of the parasite, and has also been shown to cause detachment and passing of the whole parasite.Ko, S.B. ‚ÄúObservation of deworming process in intestinal Diphyllobothrium latum parasitism by Gastrografin injection into jejunum through double-balloon enteroscope.‚Äù (2008) from Letter to the Editor; American Journal of Gastroenterology, 103; 2149-2150.  Prevention  Ingestion of raw freshwater fish should be avoided. Adequate cooking or freezing of freshwater fish will destroy the encysted fish tapeworm larvae. Fish that is thoroughly cooked, brined, or frozen at -10 ¬∞C for 24‚Äì48 hours can also be consumed without risk of D. latum infection. Public health information campaigns may be employed to educate the public about the risks of consuming improperly prepared fish. Because human feces are an important mechanism for spreading eggs, proper disposal of sewage can reduce fish (and therefore human) infections. Prevention of water contamination may be achieved both by raising public awareness of the dangers of defecating in recreational bodies of water and by implementation of basic sanitation measures and screening and successful treatment of people infected with the parasite.  Treatment  Upon diagnosis, treatment is simple and effective. Praziquantel The standard treatment for diphyllobothriasis (as well as many other tapeworm infections) is a single dose of praziquantel, 5‚Äì10 mg/kg orally once for both adults and children. Praziquantel is not FDA- approved for this indication. Praziquantel has few side effects, many of which are similar to the symptoms of diphyllobothriasis. Niclosamide An alternative treatment is niclosamide, 2 g orally once for adults or 50 mg/kg (max 2 g) for children. Niclosamide is not available for human or even animal use in the United States. Side effects of niclosamide are very rare due to the fact that the medication is not absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Other Reportedly, albendazole can also be effective. Gastrografin may be potentially used both as a diagnostic and therapeutic; when introduced into the duodenum it allows for the visualization of the parasite, and has also been shown to cause detachment and passing of the whole worm.  Epidemiology  People at high risk for infection have traditionally been those who regularly consume raw fish. While people of any gender or age may fall sick, the majority of identified cases occurred in middle-aged men.  Geographical distribution  Diphyllobothriasis occurs in areas where lakes and rivers coexist with human consumption of raw or undercooked freshwater fish. Such areas are found in Europe, newly independent states of the former Soviet Union, North America, Asia, Uganda, Peru (because of ceviche), and Chile. Many regional cuisines include raw or undercooked food, including sushi and sashimi in Japanese cuisine, carpaccio di persico in Italian, tartare maison in French-speaking populations, ceviche in Latin American cuisine and marinated herring in Scandinavia. With emigration and globalization, the practice of eating raw fish in these and other dishes has brought diphyllobothriasis to new parts of the world and created new endemic foci of disease. Infections in Europe and North America were traditionally associated with Jewish women due to the practice of tasting bits of uncooked fish during preparation of the gefilte fish dish, and also occurred in Scandinavian women for the same reason. Diphyllobothriasis was thus also referred to as the \\"Jewish housewife's disease\\" or the \\"Scandinavian housewife's disease\\". = Japan = Diphyllobothriasis nihonkaiense was once endemic to coastal provinces of central and northern Japan, where salmon fisheries thrived. In recent decades, regions with endemic diphyllobothriasis nihonkaiense have disappeared from Japan, though cases continue to be reported among urbanites who consume sushi or sashimi. In Kyoto, it is estimated that the average annual incidence in the past 20 years was 0.32/100,000, and that in 2008 was 1.0 case per 100,000 population, suggesting that D. nihonkaiense infection is equally as prevalent in Japan as D. latum is in some European countries. = United States = The disease is rare in the United States.  History  The fish tapeworm has a long documented history of infecting people who regularly consume fish and especially those whose customs include the consumption of raw or undercooked fish. In the 1970s, most of the known cases of diphyllobothriasis came from Europe (5 million cases), and Asia (4 million cases) with fewer cases coming from North America and South America, and no reliable data on cases from Africa or Australia. Despite the relatively small number of cases seen today in South America, some of the earliest archeological evidence of diphyllobothriasis comes from sites in South America. Evidence of Diphyllobothrium spp. has been found in 4,000- to 10,000-year-old human remains on the western coast of South America. There is no clear point in time when Diphyllobothrium latum and related species were ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù in humans, but it is clear that diphyllobothriasis has been endemic in human populations for a very long time. Due to the changing dietary habits in many parts of the world, autochthonous, or locally acquired, cases of diphyllobothriasis have recently been documented in previously non-endemic areas, such as Brazil.Llaguno, Mauricio M., et al. ‚ÄúDiphyllobothrium latum infection in a non-endemic country: case report.‚Äù (2008) Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical, 41 (3), 301-303 In this way, diphyllobothriasis represents an emerging infectious disease in certain parts of the world where cultural practices involving eating raw or undercooked fish are being introduced.

The show was a period and relationship drama about the impact of sexual and social liberation in 1970s American suburban households, with story arcs involving open marriages and key parties. Overview Swingtown premiered on Thursday June 5, 2008, in the time slot previously occupied by Without a Trace. The show was also picked up by Global in Canada, ITV3 in the United Kingdom, TV3 Ireland in Ireland, Network Ten in Australia, Rai 4 in Italy, Warner Channel in South America, and Universal Channel in Poland, TV 2 in Norway, Channel Four in New Zealand, and Romania. After seven episodes of declining ratings, CBS moved the show's US airing to Fridays, swapping with Flashpoint, which had outperformed Swingtown despite airing in a less favorable time slot. Swingtown's first season's finale (ultimately the de facto series finale) aired on September 5. Although the show's cancellation was suspected well in advance, it was made official on January 14, 2009. Premise Set in the summer of 1976, the series begins with the relocation of the Miller family to a more affluent neighborhood in the North Shore, a suburban area of Chicago. Bruce Miller (played by Jack Davenport) is a futures trader working his way up in the business, married to Susan (Molly Parker). Susan Miller is a homemaker who got pregnant and married Bruce in high school. The couple have a teenage daughter, Laurie (Shanna Collins), and a young son Bruce Junior, nicknamed B.J. (Aaron Howles). Tom and Trina Decker (Grant Show and Lana Parrilla) are the Millers' new neighbors. Tom, an airline pilot, met Trina while she was a stewardess. The Deckers quickly befriend the Millers, and the Millers just as quickly learn that their new neighbors have an open marriage. The move strains the Millers' friendship with Roger and Janet Thompson (Josh Hopkins and Miriam Shor), their more conservative neighbors and friends from their old neighborhood. They try to maintain their friendship with the Millers, but the Thompsons are appalled when they learn about the Deckers' marital arrangement. The Thompsons have a son, Rick (Nick Benson). Although the show mostly focuses on the three couples, their children's stories are followed too, particularly Laurie, who is attracted to her summer school philosophy teacher (Michael Rady). B.J. and Rick's friendship is also tested by the move, and B.J. meets Samantha Saxton (Brittany Robertson), an enigmatic girl who lives next door to him in his new neighborhood.

Poul said HBO passed on the opportunity at least in part because it already had Big Love in production and Tell Me You Love Me in development. The two next approached Showtime, but before discussions with that network went anywhere, CBS Entertainment president Nina Tassler found out about the proposal and within a couple of days, had read the script; she gave the series the greenlight in May 2007. The script, written in anticipation of a cable network deal, had to be rewritten for American broadcast television standards, all but eliminating the nudity and the explicit depiction of sexual acts. CBS ordered 13 episodes from CBS Paramount Television. Reception The 26 critics included in the show's Metacritic gave it mixed reviews (a \\"metascore\\" of 49). Variety said the series \\"exhibits rare depth\\" and includes \\"plenty of nifty touches, from the pop-song score and Boogie Nights fashions to the first-rate cast.\\" The Hollywood Reporter said \\"even skillful performances by its largely unknown cast aren't able to hide the lack of character development and the sense that the people in this series are almost self-parodies.\\" Salon called it \\"stylish and '70s-sexy but also shallow enough to feel like a less funny, hollowed-out combination of The Wonder Years and Boogie Nights -- which is exactly what the show's creators told the New York Times they were aiming for (without using the words 'less funny' and 'hollowed-out' of course).\\" Controversy The American Family Association urged members to write letters of complaint to the media, while the Parents Television Council followed a failed boycott attempt with an effort to convince CBS affiliates to preempt the program. Procter & Gamble and Ace Hardware stopped advertising on the serial. Lindsay Soll writes that one \\"producer thinks of sophisticated swingers Tom and Trina (Show and Parilla) in a ‚ÄòGreat Gatsby-like way,‚Äô calling them 'the shining couple across the street.' Exactly why we'd get in bed with them--er, the show.\\" Audience interest dwindled as the summer progressed. After a strong pilot episode, the ratings for Swingtown got progressively worse, aided by a mid-season move from Thursdays to Friday. According to executive producer Alan Poul, the first season ending was shot with the show's uncertain future in mind: > The season ends with a cliffhanger, but it's also a completely satisfying > ending. So, if we go forward, there are many new things that are set up to > explore. And if we don't go forward, there's no feeling that we've been left > with something incomplete. The poor ratings led CBS to see if any cable networks, or perhaps DirecTV, were interested in picking it up. Bravo decided to acquire rights to the existing episodes, but did not order any new ones. Episodes Episodes feature songs of the period performed by the original artists; Last.fm, owned by CBS Interactive, features the songs from the show in a sponsored group cross-promoted during each episode.Last.fm Teams With CBS's 'Swingtown' from Billboard magazine's Billboard.biz { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%; background:#fff;\\" - ! style=\\"background:#8888FF;\\" No. ! style=\\"background:#8888FF;\\" Title ! style=\\"background:#8888FF;\\" Directed by ! style=\\"background:#8888FF;\\" Written by ! style=\\"background:#8888FF;\\" Original air date ! style=\\"background:#8888FF;\\" Prod. code ! style=\\"background:#8888FF;\\" Viewers } Ratings There were low ratings for the first seven episodes -- the seven Thursday night episodes averaged 6.7 million viewers and a 2.3 rating in adults 18-49 -- led CBS to move Swingtown from Thursdays to Fridays.

Shark Reef was built at a cost of $40 million, and was opened on June 20, 2000. In 2007, it underwent a re- branding campaign adding \\"Aquarium\\" to the official name. Shark Reef Aquarium officials stated that the re-branding is intended to present the actual nature of the habitat, as members of the public sometimes confused Shark Reef as a name for a bar, lounge, restaurant, etc. In 2012, Shark Reef Aquarium replaced the signage and audio-wands of each exhibit with various interactive touch screens throughout the facility.  Conservation and sustainability  Members of the Shark Reef staff participate in the \\"Adopt-a-Cove\\" program to aid in the clean up of Lake Mead. Within the map and guide handed out at the park, they offer an \\"In Good Taste\\" guide that folds up into a business card size pamphlet to promote sustainable seafood choices. The information found within this guide is credited to the Monterey Bay Aquarium Foundation. Throughout the various exhibits, there is signage to educate the audience about the dangers of shark finning, introducing invasive species (like lion fish), and various other harmful practices.

The shark was successfully flown into Mandalay Bay in August 2001 on a record 16-hour flight in a special transportation tank designed specifically for it. It remained in a private quarantine tank for 2.5 years until the in-house aquarium husbandry team decided it had grown large enough where it would not fall prey to the other sharks in the exhibit tank. It measured six feet long when it was finally introduced among big public fanfare into the tank on November 3, 2003 for public exhibition.

He represented Australia internationally and New South Wales in State of Origin, and played club football in Australia for the Penrith Panthers, South Sydney Rabbitohs, Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles and in England for the London Broncos. Biography Carroll was born in Penrith, New South Wales on 26 February 1967. He started out playing junior rugby league football for the Penrith Panthers. Playing career Carroll was a member of the Penrith Panthers 1987 reserve grade premiers. He played in three seasons of first grade at Penrith between 1987‚Äì1989. Carroll found immediate success after moving to South Sydney Rabbitohs in 1990, earning him a surprise selection as a reserve for the one-off Test against France at Parkes, New South Wales (having not yet played at State of Origin level). At the end of the 1990 NSWRL season, he went on the 1990 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France but made only six appearances due to a knee injury. He played with South Sydney Rabbitohs for four seasons between 1990‚Äì1993. Carroll moved to Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles in 1994, but despite being a shadow player for New South Wales and the Australian Test team, he failed to make a second Kangaroo Tour at the end of the year. Carroll's representative career gained a boost with the Super League split in 1995 when he won a belated NSW jersey. Despite being suspended for a stiff-arm tackle on David Furner and missing the State of Origin match in Melbourne, he was selected for Australia to play against New Zealand. A member of Australia's victorious World Cup team in 1995, his appearances against New Zealand, Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Rest of the World teams over the next two years boosted his Test total to 12 matches. He is listed on the Australian Players Register as Kangaroo No. 600.ARL Annual Report 2005, page 56 While Carroll obviously enjoyed playing in a stronger pack at Manly, three consecutive grand Final appearances (1995‚Äì97) garnered just the one premiership success, in 1996. At the end of 1997, he left Manly to play for the London Broncos but the move was not a success and he cited homesickness as the reason for his return. Carroll re-joined South Sydney Rabbitohs in 1999 and was an important part of the club's early season resurgence. Recalled to rep football in the Second State of Origin match that year, he was knocked out in the series decider after a controversial tackle by Jason Smith. Post playing Forced to retire at season's end because of chronic knee injury, Carroll became a committed supporter of South Sydney Rabbitohs' reinstatement into the NRL in 2002. In 2000, Carroll was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in rugby league. He has since gained some notoriety as the international bodyguard of actor Russell Crowe.https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl- premiership/teams/rabbitohs/mark-carroll-reveals-how-russell-crowe-changed- his-life-turned-him-into-a-businessman/news- story/a1821157bccaf8fbc4dfaf7b0eb2d357https://www.independent.co.uk/arts- entertainment/films/news/russell-crowe-picks-on-somebody-his-own-size-in-a- fight-with-his-bodyguard-558258.html In June 2020, Carroll advised listeners on 2GB and FoxSports that Paul Gallen was a drug cheat and coward and that he got off lightly for his involvement during the Cronulla Sharks supplement scandal.

Early life Palmer was born in Great Torrington, Devonshire, England, the fourth son of the Rev. John Palmer (a nephew of Sir Joshua Reynolds), and his wife Jane, a daughter of William Johnson.Alan Gross, 'Palmer, Sir James Frederick (1803 - 1871)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 5, MUP, 1974, pp 392-393. Retrieved 2014-06-25 He was trained in medicine, practised in London, and was surgeon at St Thomas's hospital. In 1824 he became a house surgeon at St George's Hospital (M.A.C.S., 1826). In 1835-37 he edited a four-volume edition of the Works of John Hunter, the anatomist. He also supplied the glossary to A Dialogue in the Devonshire Dialect, written by his grandmother in the eighteenth century, but not published until 1837. On 21 November 1831 Palmer married Isabella, third daughter of Dr John Gunning, C.B., who was inspector-general of hospitals at the time. After failing to secure two surgical appointments, Palmer migrated to Melbourne, arriving at the end of September 1840, and in addition to practising his profession, was proprietor of a cordial manufactory and later, a wine merchant. Politics Palmer was an early member of the Melbourne City Council and was elected Mayor of Melbourne in 1845. A mayor he laid the foundation-stone of the first Melbourne hospital building on 20 March 1846. In September 1848 Palmer was elected one of five members for Port Phillip District for the New South Wales Legislative Council, but resigned in June 1849. When Victoria became a separate colony in 1851, Palmer was elected a member of the Victorian Legislative Council for Normanby, Dundas and Follett and its speaker. When responsible government was granted Palmer became a candidate for the Council and was elected in 1856 for the Western Province. He was the Council's first President and continued in that position until September 1870, when he did not seek re-election to the Council on account of his failing health. He was knighted in 1857. Palmer was a good President of the council, took much interest in the Melbourne hospital, of which he was president for 26 years, and was also greatly interested in education. Palmer was president of the national board of education and subsequently of the board of education. Charles La Trobe described him as 'a gentleman by birth, education and profession. Sometimes he pulled against, more often for, but I always respected him as honest'. Palmer died at Burwood, his estate in Hawthorn, Melbourne, on 23 April 1871.

As the grandson of a coal miner from southern Illinois, Jeff Biggers has been a vocal critic of mountaintop removal in Appalachia and strip mining across the nation, poorly enforced black lung and mining workplace safety laws, and the fallacy of \\"clean coal\\" slogans. Reckoning at Eagle Creek examines the loss of his family's 200-year-old homestead to strip mining, and the historical parallel impact of coal mining on communities and their environment.

Writing career=Non-fiction books \\"Resistance: Reclaiming an American Tradition\\" is a \\"widely ranging history of intellectual and moral resistance within American politics,\\" according to Kirkus Reviews. It includes portraits of Native American and early American figures, and the American legacy of resistanec to duplicitious authority for civil rights, women's rights, immigrant rights, environmental protection, free speech. In an interview with PEN American, Biggers said, \\"In dealing with the most challenging issues of every generation, resistance to duplicitous civil authority and its corporate enablers has defined our quintessential American story.\\" \\"Reckoning at Eagle Creek: The Secret Legacy of Coal in the Heartland\\" is a family saga, part memoir, cultural history and journalistic investigation, examining the impact of coal mining on Biggers' native region of southern Illinois. It won the Sierra Club's David Brower Award.

While many political movements have put down roots in the state, the paths their struggles collectively blaze for the country ultimately point toward emancipation.‚Äù Another critic said, \\"for Jeff Biggers what the immigration policy of this country should be is as clear as unpolluted, smog-free air, and crystal clean, unchemicalized water. Biggers, an author, journalist, storyteller and playwright is not typical, however. His knowledge and writings about vital trending issues ... run far and wide. He is a discerning advocate.

Based on his one-year sojourn among the native Rar√°muri/Tarahumara of Mexico, Biggers examines the ways of a resilient indigenous culture in the Americas, the exploits of the Mexican mountaineers, and the parade of argonauts and accidental travelers that has journeyed into the Sierra Madre over centuries. From African explorers, Bohemian friars, Confederate and Irish war deserters, French poets, Boer and Russian commandos, hidden Apache and Mennonite communities, bewildered archaeologists, addled writers, and legendary characters like Antonin Artaud, B.

In 2001, Velasco was inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in recognition of his career and extensive influence on lucha libre. Professional wrestling career Velasco started his wrestling career in 1937 after having trained for two years under the tutelage of Ra√∫l Romero, using the name \\"Telmo Velazco\\". Because Velasco did not have the physical size to become a top line wrestler, he was never a main eventer, but because of his skills and tenacity he was a respected mid-card wrestler who could be relied on to put on a good match. In 1942 Velasco decided that his skills would be put to better use training wrestlers than performing in the ring. In 1959 he was made the head trainer of the Arena Coliseo de Guadalajara, one of the biggest wrestling schools in Mexico. Over the years he trained a long row of future top stars in Lucha Libre instilling in them his work ethic and drive. After some time as the head trainer at Arena Coliseo, his students would gain a reputation as having good prospects in the ring, if Velasco let them graduate they had to have a certain level of skill. Velasco was in the sport not for the money, but because he genuinely loved the sport, a sentiment he managed to pass along to most of his students. Even after an old hip injury forced Velasco to stop getting in the ring with his students he still oversaw and mentored everyone in his gym.

Father Walter Pelczynski, MIC, with the assistance of local clergy and friends of the Marian community, initially purchased 50 of the that constituted the \\"Eden Hill\\" estate in November, 1943. The house was to serve as the novitiate for a newly formed province. An image of \\"The Divine Mercy\\" was enshrined in one of the small chapels where the members of the community prayed daily a perpetual novena to the Divine Mercy. Pilgrims began to arrive the very next spring to celebrate the Feast of The Divine Mercy (the Sunday after Easter). By the end of World War II in 1945, pilgrims in growing numbers came to offer thanksgiving for graces received through the Divine Mercy message and devotion. They urged the Marians to build a shrine to Jesus, The Divine Mercy, as a votive of thanks. The Fathers decided to accede to the requests since there was also a need for a larger chapel to accommodate a growing community. The construction of the present Shrine began in 1950 and was completed and solemnly dedicated by Springfield Bishop Christopher Weldon in 1960. In 1996, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops declared it a National Shrine in accord with Church law. The National Shrine has drawn thousands of pilgrims from around the world.

It is the largest shopping center in northwestern Puerto Rico, with over 130 stores and fast food restaurants. History Plaza del Norte opened its doors in 1992. In 2005 the mall was acquired by DDR Corp. During the mid to late 2000s, the mall started to lose many of its tenants. The Cinevista Theatre and Pueblo Supermarkets were closed after their respective parent companies went bankrupt. Party City and Pitusa, which, along with Pueblo, occupied the strip mall area, also left . This led to that part of the mall becoming nearly fully vacant, as the smaller stores and Casa Febus relocated to the enclosed mall. The opening and later expansion of the Puerto Rico Premium Outlets in Barceloneta, led to many stores to open in this outlet mall than in Plaza del Norte. In the JCPenney wing, several formerly small stores were combined into a Circuit City in 2008, but the chain's bankruptcy led to the store being closed a year later. The space was temporarily used by Casa Febus, until it moved to a new building outside the mall. In 2011, DDR Corp. announced a significant interior and exterior renovation of the mall, including a 10,000-square-foot expansion and renovation of the existing J.C. Penney Co. store, which now occupies part of the JCPenney wing, including the former Circuit City. The project included the addition of a Rooms To Go, the combination of three small retail-space units to accommodate a PetSmart, several other new stores and outparcels, a new Caribbean Cinemas movie theater and new carts and kiosks through the entire mall. The project was completed in mid-2013. In early October 2015, Wal-Mart left the mall for a Supercenter. In November 2019 an Econo supermarket opened a store in Plaza del Norte.

Being built on the site of the Ipatiev House where Nicholas II, the last Emperor of Russia, and his family, along with members of the household, were shot and killed by the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War, the church commemorates the Romanov sainthood. Site history= Ipatiev House  The Ipatiev House, built in the 1880s, was a spacious and modern residence owned by Nicholas Ipatiev.Ipatiev House - Romanov Memorial - Outside Tour The Ural Soviet gave him two days' notice to leave. Once the building was vacated, the Soviet built high wooden walls around the house. First to arrive among the Romanovs were Nicholas, Alexandra Feodorovna and their daughter Maria. Later, they would be joined by Olga, Tatiana, Anastasia and Alexei. The Romanovs would be held prisoner in their final residence for 78 days. In 1974, the mansion was designated a \\"national monument\\"; but three years later on September 22, 1977, a team, under orders from the Soviet government and with the direction of Boris Yeltsin, demolished the house. Romanov execution After the February Revolution, the former Tsar and his family were taken captive and held as prisoners during the Russian Civil War. Tsar Nicholas and his family were at first kept at the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoe Selo outside St. Petersburg. Alexander Kerensky, leader of the provisional government moved them to the former Governor's mansion in Tobolsk. Later they were transferred to the Ipatiev House in Yekaterinburg. With the advance of the Czechoslovak Legion (fighting with the White Army against Bolsheviks) towards Yekaterinburg, fears of a potential attempt to liberate them grew, and the local Bolshevik leaders, after consulting with the leadership in Moscow, decided to kill the family. In the early hours of July 17, 1918, the Tsar Nicholas Alexandrovich, Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna, Grand Duchess Olga, Grand Duchess Tatiana, Grand Duchess Maria, Grand Duchess Anastasia and Tsarevich Alexei‚Äîwere taken to the basement of the Ipatiev House and were murdered by being shot and bayoneted.The Execution of Tsar Nicholas II, 1918 Czechoslovak Legions captured the city less than a week later.

She moved to Cleveland, OH during the 1850s. After the American Civil War, she and her mother helped former slaves who came to Cleveland. With a group of other women, she established the Cleveland Home for Aged Colored people in 1896 which has become the longest continuing home for aged colored people. In 1960, its name was changed to Eliza Bryant Home for the Aged, in honor of its founder. Later, in 1999, the name was changed to Eliza Bryant Village (EBV). Early days Mary Simmons nicknamed \\"Polly\\" was born in 1804 to Fereby Simmons, a free woman of color in North Carolina.Winns Family History Typescript: Wayne Cty Library Archives; Free Negroes of North Carolina p 1055. Therefore, Eliza Simmons Bryant, who was her daughter, was also born free. It is possible these women were descended from the Winyaws Tribe of the Tuscaroras Nation. Eliza was raised on a plantation in Wayne County. Polly Simmons bought property from her brother Calvin in 1838 and additional land from a neighbor Kinon Milard in 1847.Icabod Flewellen Collection, East Cleveland Public Library. Genealogy, Family Tree, Copies of receipts from Wayne Cty Public Records. Needham Bryant applied for a marriage license for himself and Eliza Simmons in Cuyahoga County in 1853. Buckner and John Simmons can be found in various Cleveland City Directories from 1848. The family was known for providing shelter, food and water to black families. Humanitarian work Eliza Bryant became a pioneer in the movement to assist African Americans in the Cleveland area, especially those who had moved from the southern states during the Great Migration after Emancipation Proclamation. She became particularly concerned for elderly African-Americans, who were tremendously suffering from the poor living conditions in Cleveland. The majority of these were freed slaves, with nothing given to them except their freedom. Because of ethnic, religious and racial segregation, existing facilities such as the Dorcas Home (aged white women) or the Baptist Home would not admit African Americans. In 1893, after a visit to the Pittsburgh Home for Aged Colored People, Edith Jackson gathered a group of women which included Eliza Bryant, Sarah Green and Lethia Flemming. These women began the work of establishing a home for aged black women, but also allowed male residents. They sought help for their cause through churches, community groups, business community, friends and family. Eliza and members of the Lady Board of Managers recruited volunteers who went door to door to raise money, food and clothing. Because of the appeal of a group of black women that included Prudence Jones, Lethia Fleming, Marie Taylor Perkins; Mrs. Laura Spellman Rockefeller made a financial contribution, which helped to enable the purchase of the first home. In January 1895 a board of managers composed of women and a male treasurer was named for the proposed home. By 1896, enough funds were raised and a house was purchased for $2,000 with barely any necessities. The Cleveland Home for Aged Colored People was incorporated on September 1, 1896, and opened on August 11, 1897. The home has been a central fixture of philanthropy by and for African Americans in Cleveland. Eliza Bryant died in 1907, and is buried at Woodland Cemetery in Cleveland. Over the years, the Cleveland Home for Aged Colored People struggled to support itself, but has been a pillar of the Black Community. After the advent of Social Security and eventually Medicaid the financing became more stable. The Dorcas Home closed and moved to the Cleveland Suburbs in 1967 selling its property in Hough to Eliza Bryant for $1. Another major gift from the closing of Forest City (African American) Hospital enabled the home to renovate, modernize and continue its tradition of quality and compassionate care for elderly African Americans.Jimmy Wilkinson Meyer & Kimberly S.

It is continuously developed and maintained by the French company PMB Services.  Features  PMB follows the rules of the library science. The software provides 4 essential features : * the library management, * the watch and the documentary products, * the publication of editorial content * the electronic document management. It provides an integrated portal of news and management of Web 2.0 content and is the only ILS that doesn't use a third-party CMS for the management of the portal. It is multilingual (100% English & French, 80% Spanish and Italian) and even supports Arabic (translation and UTF8 support) since its 3.0.5 version of November 2006. The latest 4.2 version of July 2015 includes a watch unit (Watch&Share;) and allows geo-referencing of the collections and several other improvements to the software.  Size  The software is used with collections up to around 500 000 records. Tests are done with 2 million records to show its capacity to manage bigger collections. It is regularly installed in public libraries networks of 10 to 15 sites.  Interoperability  PMB allows to use the Z39.50 protocol (in order to import bibliographic records that can be directly integrated in the database from different servers). It manages the UNIMARC cataloguing format and the ISO 2709 record exchange format. It also includes the XML data format. PMB is also OAI server and client. The user's database can be connected to an LDAP directory or any other base of users reachable by web services. It has an API allowing to integrate it into an existing information system. The integration of PMB into a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) is functional in many French academies.  Units/Modules  PMB is divided in two modules: the management module and the portal module (or OPAC). The management module includes specific functions for the librarian: circulation (loan/return), catalogue, authorities, editions, SDI (Selective Dissemination of the Information and the watch module Watch&Share;), acquisitions, CMS and administration. PMB comes with a user request management feature since 2009. It can, moreover, be completed by the preset addition of an extensions module. At the start, the software was providing a specialized user interface on the catalogue : the OPAC. An improvement to the software in 2012 added a CMS feature offering the ability to make highly customizable portals.  Requirements  It is a web application, based on a web server platform (Apache, Microsoft IIS) + PHP + MySQL or MariaDB, which can therefore work on Linux, Mac OS X or Microsoft Windows . PMB has its own search engine, supporting phonetic searches without needing any complementary search engine. PMB is written using PHP programming language. It requires: * PHP * Apache web server * MySQL database * Web browser  Documentary languages  PMB can integrate different sorting plans: DEWEY, CDU, PCDM or any other custom sorting plan. It includes the management of several thesauri, a feature that is actually in use with thesauri such as: PRISME, BDSP, MOTBIS, DELPHES, Thesaurus du Management, Vie culturelle, etc. It comes with a management of concepts allowing it to respect the ISO 25964-1 standard and therefore the use of indexation languages like RAMEAU or MeSH. It also allows the total implementation of the FRBR model.  Users  PMB is used by big institutions such as local communities, ministries, the constitutional council, regional councils, metro-poles, the Academy of Rennes and every documentation center of Brittany. Many public libraries networks, secondary schools, the ONISEP (a French work and study information institute) and the INSEE have chosen the software PMB. The group Radio France has joined the community of PMB users in 2015 for an FRBR migration of its library (including musical partitions). PMB also equips private groups such as law offices, Grandes √©coles, internationally known fashion groups etc. According to the annual survey of Livres-Hebdo, PMB was the third Integrated library system in France in 2005 in terms of number of installations with 165 installations. Next years' surveys showed the fast progression of the free software in many structures. Since 2011, PMB Services refuses to take part to this survey : the numbers given to Marc Maisonneuve weren't correctly reused and there was an amalgam made with the software BCDI, yet not a free software. On 1 January 2015, there was more than 6 000 operational installations in the world, for collections sizes going from 300 records to 500 000. Big companies such as Alstom or Orange S.A. now use more free solutions such as PMB. Since 2012, the software is running in a higher education network in Belgium, HENAM- HENALLUX, with more than 400 000 online searchable records. In France, PMB Services claims to have more than 1 800 clients. The company's official website lists most of them and links their online catalogues.  History  In its early beta versions, the software was called PhpMyBibli. It has been launched by Fran√ßois Lemarchand (director of the Library of Agneaux) in October 2002. The cataloguing and the application's base have been created during the autumn 2002, followed a bit later by the serials management module. In 2003, Eric Robert, an IT engineer fighting for the free software joins PMB founder Fran√ßois Lemarchand. He then develops the loan module, the Unimarc imports, the statistic files and the Z39.50 client. It is in December 2003, for a presentation at an international conference in Rabat that the 1.0 version was released. PMB then officially becomes an integrated library system (ILS). The OPAC (the user interface) appeared this year too, developed by Gautier Michelin and Christophe Bliard. The most involved developers at this date (Eric Robert, Gautier Michelin and Florent T√©tart) then created the company PMB Services to professionalize the software and to offer the services necessary for interested libraries or companies. The society provides services like training and installation of the software (local or hosted) along with all the support services needed to implement the software: local installation or SaaS mode, migration or recovery of data, set up, training, construction and design of the portal. The first library to be equipped with PMB was the library of Bueil-en-Touraine (in France). The version 4.1 has been downloaded more than 38 000 times. The 4.2 is available since 24 July 2015 and has been downloaded 2272 times on 15 September.  Development  PMB was initially licensed under GNU General Public License, which ensures the free availability of the software. Wiki, mailing lists and BerliOS hosting facilities allow communication between PMB developers and users. PMB is now licensed under CECILL free licence, that ensures legal security in France and other countries with similar legal systems.

() was a South Korean based video game company. They developed The King of Fighters 2001 and The King of Fighters 2002 after SNK was bankrupted. Their last title released was Chaos Breaker, for the arcade system Taito Type X. Although Eolith was founded as an independent company in 1996, Kum Gang published their early arcade games. In 2000, they started a small chain of arcades called G-Park. On June 7th, 2000, they registered at KOSDAQ as the first Korean arcade game maker. Besides video games, their redemption games El Dorado won the Ministry of Culture and Tourism Game of the Month June 2001 award, and Mugunghwa Kkot-i Pieosseumnida (English: The roses of Sharon have blossomed, known as Hide and Seek outside of Korea) won the Game of the Month November 2001 and Arcade Game of the Year 2001 awards. In 2000, the company M-Dream was founded by a former Eolith employee. M-Dream specialized in developing mobile games. They also developed several online games, and localized and published a number of PS2 and PC games. In November 2002, the subsidiary M-Dream China was formed. In 2003, Eolith merged with M-Dream, and Choe Jeongho became the new CEO. On June 3rd, 2005, Eolith was bought out by Netbrain, who was later integrated into the pharma company Neurotech and thoroughly restructured. Neurotech was renamed to Neurotech Pharma on November 8th, 2006, and that same day, Eolith shut down. M-Dream became a separate company again, and continued to publish mobile games until 2007 when they were shut down. Although M-Dream was shut down, M-Dream China is still active, but their website disappeared in 2018. In May 2008, a new company called Neolith was formed from the ashes of Eolith. Neolith received government support of 160,000,000 won, but never showed much as a result.

Plot A mentally challenged girl is defended by a young man who takes care of pigs. He gets into a fight with the local saloon keeper, prompting the man to get the boy drunk and bribe a priest into marrying the boy to the unfortunate girl. A female teacher arrives in town to teach women how to paint. She uses the young boy as a model and then as a toy for her pleasure. The teacher subsequently takes another lover and abandons the young man, claiming that she was unaware of his marriage. The young boy eventually kills his wife, but his father takes the blame for the crime and confesses his sins before he dies in prison. As a conclusion to this sad movie, the townspeople punish the young boy for what he has done. Themes Typical \\"film noire\\"See, e.g., Biesen (2005), p. 1; Hirsch (2001), p. 9; Lyons (2001), p. 2; Silver and Ward (1992), p. 1; Schatz (1981), p. 112. Outside the field of noir scholarship, \\"dark film\\" is also offered on occasion; see, e.g., Block, Bruce A., The Visual Story: Seeing the Structure of Film, TV, and New Media (2001), p. 94; Klarer, Mario, An Introduction to Literary Studies (1999), p. 59. plot of the film is not the main message of the film. The film is about fighting good against evil, and how criticism of government by Petroviƒá reached another level as battle between good, in the character of mentally challenged Goca, and evil, in most of the characters in the film. Other themes that run through the movie are: selfishness, prudence, jealousy, rejection of right values, and the decline of society. The end of the movie shows how easy evil can be spread and infect people who are in touch with it.

After starting his career as a door-to-door salesman and then broker, Miglin became a successful real estate developer. He was murdered in his home in May 1997 by Andrew Cunanan, a serial killer. Biography Miglin was one of seven children born to a Roman Catholic family of Lithuanian descent; his father worked as a Central Illinois coal miner. Miglin began his career selling silverware door-to-door and pancake batter out of the trunk of his car. In 1956, at the age of 31, he began his real estate career, taking a job as a broker with Chicago real estate magnate Arthur Rubloff. At Arthur Rubloff & Co., Miglin would first get involved with warehouse construction, later moving into office development. One of the projects he was involved in was the development of the first two of the three towers at the President's Plaza office complex near Chicago's O'Hare International Airport (he would later develop the third tower in 1985 with his firm Miglin-Beitler). Miglin was regarded as an early developer of the business park developments. Miglin formed a successful real estate development partnership with J. Paul Beitler, who had also worked at Rubloff & Co, creating the firm Miglin-Beitler Developments in 1982. Among the projects developed by the firm were Madison Plaza, 181 West Madison Street, Oakbrook Terrace Tower (the tallest building in Illinois outside of Chicago) The firm also managed properties. In 1988, Miglin-Beitler Developments unveiled plans to construct a 1,999 foot 125-floor skyscraper in Chicago to be called the Miglin-Beitler Skyneedle. However, the building was never built, with plans faltering during a 1990 downturn of Chicago's downtown office market. Miglin- Beitler had held hopes of resurrecting the project, but these hopes would be dashed by Miglin's murder. After the firm began shifting its focus away from development and towards property management in the 1990s, Miglin gradually withdrew from the daily operations, but still remained involved in the company. Personal life In 1959, Miglin married 20-year-old Marilyn Klecka, who is of Czech descent and also Roman Catholic. Klecka, a successful entrepreneur known as the Queen of Makeovers, established a prominent perfume and cosmetics company and is a celebrity on the Home Shopping Network. They had two children together, Marlena (born 1968) and Duke Miglin (born 1971), who became an actor. Murder Miglin was murdered on May 4, 1997, by the serial killer Andrew Cunanan. Miglin's body was found in the garage of his home in Chicago's Gold Coast Historic District. He had been bound at the wrists, and his head was bound with tape, with only a breathing space under his nostrils. He had been tortured with a saw and a screwdriver, his ribs had been broken, he had been beaten and stabbed, and his throat had been slashed with a gardener's bow saw. Cunanan was already wanted in Minneapolis for murdering his friend Jeffrey Trail, 28, and ex-lover David Madson, 33, a few days earlier. In popular culture The second season of the anthology television series American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace, recounted the Cunanan spree. It included appearances by Miglin, portrayed by Mike Farrell. This portrayal was based on Vulgar Favors: Andrew Cunanan, Gianni Versace, and the Largest Failed Manhunt in U.S. History by Maureen Orth, who speculated that Miglin may have been a closeted gay or bisexual man in a secret relationship with Cunanan.

First queen regnant in Sardinia, she ruled Gallura from the death of her father until her own death, though she was eclipsed by her husband after 1207.Murineddu, p. 200 When Barisone died in 1202 or 1203, he left Elena and the giudicato under the protection of Pope Innocent III,Moore, 91. According to Innocent, Barisone left his giudicato to papal protection, probably because of Innocent's success in protecting Constance and Frederick I of Sicily. who wrote a letter to Biagio, Archbishop of Torres, charging him with assuring a smooth succession in Gallura, which meant arranging a marriage for the young Elena. The prospect of interference from William I of Cagliari, Comita III of Logudoro, and Hugh I and Peter I of Arborea was great enough to incite a second letter to those judges, in which the pope told them to respect Biagio's authority in the matter. On 15 September 1203, Innocent admonished William to restrain a relative of his (the margrave William Malaspina) who was seeking Elena's hand and to get him out of Gallura.Moore, 90. He was asked to guard Elena from making a poor match and especially to guard her from Ittocorre de Gunale, her presumed grandfather. Ittocorre was the cousin, possibly brother, of Comita of Logudoro, and the father of her father Constantine III. Both William and Comita were warned a second time to follow Biagio in the matter. Innocent desired a husband that would not be \\"suspect\\" to any of the judges. In July 1204, Innocent wrote to Elena commending her for abiding by papal advice and admonishing her mother, Riccus, Archbishop of Cagliari, and the people of Gallura to follow the decision of Biagio. The bishop of Civit√†, the Gallurese capital, was sent to Rome to receive papal instruction concerning the marriage prospects. William of Cagliari intervened again to remove a suitor, a certain unnamed margrave. On 11 May 1206, Elena was informed that she would be marrying Trasimondo, a cousin of the pope's.Moore, 93. In August, Innocent sent letters ordering the Sardinian episcopacy to go through with the marriage. Elena, however, refused him and instead married a Pisan named Lamberto Visconti di Eldizio. Elena died around 1218, when Lambert was engaged to Benedetta of Cagliari. Her son Ubaldo II Visconti later succeeded to the Gallurese throne. NotesSources *Ghisalberti, Aldo (ed).

The Shire of Nungarin originated as the Nungarin Road District, which was gazetted on 24 March 1921. It was originally much larger, extending north into what is now the Shire of Mount Marshall until losing a section to that road board on 6 July 1923. In 1933, it included the Bonnie Rock, Campion, Lake Brown, Mukinbudin and Wilgoyne districts, with an area of 1708 square miles. In that year, it faced pressure to relocate the board seat to Mukinbudin as a more central location; however, instead, the Nungarin Road District was split into two and the Mukinbudin Road District formed on 1 September 1933, resulting in the Nungarin district losing over three quarters of its land area. On 1 July 1961, it became the Shire of Nungarin under the Local Government Act 1960, which reformed all remaining road districts into shires. Wards The Shire has been divided into 3 wards.

It was first heard in a broadcast by the American Broadcasting Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Beecham, on 7 April 1945. The first concert performance followed five days later, by the Rochester Philharmonic under Beecham. He continued to include movements from the work in his programmes for the rest of his life, and it featured in his final concert, in May 1960, less than a year before he died.Lucas, p. 338 The music has been recorded, but the projected ballet was never staged. The scenario, conceived and written by Beecham, is loosely based on real events. Set in 18th-century Bath, it depicts the love affair and elopement of the playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan and Elizabeth Linley (daughter of the composer Thomas Linley), in the elite society of Bath, presided over by the dandy Beau Nash. The music is mostly taken from Handel's operas, which in Beecham's day were rarely staged and were widely considered unstageable. Beecham researched the scores of many of them and for this ballet he exhumed forgotten numbers from operas including Ariodante, Il pastor fido, Parnasso in festa and Rodrigo, adding at the climax the only well-known number in the score, the \\"Largo\\" ‚Äì \\"Ombra mai fu\\" ‚Äì from Serse, transcribed for the full orchestra.

Notes to EMI CD (1990) Plot and scenes The movements of the ballet, and the action as described by Beecham in the score, are as follows: 1\\\\. The Pump Room. :\\"The scene is a large hall, one of the pump rooms in the baths, and various persons are taking the waters or walking about. In the centre of the background and covering nearly one half of it are tall, wide curtains screening what is afterwards disclosed to be an egress into the gardens behind. It is a bright morning in summer.\\" 2\\\\. Beau Nash :\\"The Master of Ceremonies, Beau Nash, enters and salutes the water-drinkers. He announces a f√™te and concert for the evening at which the beautiful Miss Linley will sing. Beau Nash is a handsome, genial person, slightly pompous and in his early 40s.\\" 3\\\\. The Linleys :\\"Enter Squire Squaretoes followed by Mr and Miss Linley. The squire is a bucolic and awkward type, obviously purse-proud and vain. Mr Linley is amiable, fussy and self-important. Miss Linley is about 18 and modest in appearance. It is clear that she does not welcome the attentions of the squire, although these are supported by her father.\\" 4\\\\. Hunting Dance :\\"Sheridan enters in hunting costume: he and his four friends, who are equipped with hunting horns and riding whips, perform a lively dance.\\" 5\\\\. Love Scene :\\"Sheridan observes Miss Linley and is presented to her by Beau Nash. He instantly becomes enamoured of her and she is equally attracted to him. The squire and Mr Linley have retired to the background, where they take the waters and converse with friends. Sheridan declares his love, but Miss Linley indicates the obstacles in the way.\\" 6\\\\. The Quarrel :\\"The attention of the squire and Mr Linley is now drawn to the tender passages between the young couple and they display marked dissatisfaction. Miss Linley endeavours to conciliate her father, but without effect, and she is hurried by him from the hall, the squire following.\\" 7\\\\. The Pump Room :\\"The water-drinkers leave the hall by the exits at the two sides of the scene (music same as No.1).\\" 8\\\\. The Plot :\\"Sheridan implores the advice and aid of Beau Nash, who at first refuses to have anything to do with the affair. Gradually he is won over to a plan whereby Sheridan can run off with Miss Linley, provided she consents. Beau Nash, Sheridan and his four friends leave together.\\" 9\\\\. The Weary Flunkeys :\\"Three tall flunkeys enter the empty stage and draw aside the tall curtains in the background to expose to view a spacious garden flanked by an elegant building behind it. The flunkeys are world-weary creatures who move with the greatest deliberation, perform their task with extreme reluctance and yawn frequently.\\" 10\\\\. The Exquisites (Madrigal) :\\"There enter from the garden eight persons clad in the most fashionable clothes of the period. These are the exquisites, who perform a slow and stately dance. There are four men and four women and they make their appearance in couples. Finally they go out.\\" 11\\\\. Second Love Scene :\\"Enter Miss Linley and Sheridan, the former from the garden and the latter by one of the pump room entrances. Miss Linley is agitated and apprehensive. Sheridan does his best to reassure her, discloses his plan for their elopement and obtains her approval of it. They go off in opposite directions. By this time the light has changed so as to present the appearance of late afternoon.\\" 12\\\\. March :\\"A procession of the whole company led by Beau Nash enters the stage from the garden.\\" 13\\\\. Sarabande :\\"This is the first of a set of formal ballet movements.\\" 14\\\\. Minuet :\\"A solo dance for Miss Linley.\\" 15\\\\. Hornpipe :\\"The first measure is danced by a group of naval officers, the second by a midshipman, the third by the principal officer, the fourth by a group of girls, the fifth by girls and men.\\" The number ends with a prominent quotation from \\"Rule, Britannia\\", which Beecham said he added to annoy the Americans. 16\\\\. Rondeau :\\"A general ensemble.\\" 17\\\\. Gigue :\\"A general ensemble.\\" 18\\\\. March :\\"The whole company retires as it made its appearance (music same as No.12).\\" 19\\\\. Interlude :\\"The stage is empty. Light gradually fades, leaving the foreground in semi-darkness. Lights are seen in the windows of the building in the far background. The evening entertainment is beginning.\\" 20\\\\. Serenade :\\"Miss Linley is heard singing her song. Beau Nash enters from the garden and is met by Sheridan and his four friends. The final arrangements for the elopement have been completed. A parson has been secured to marry them immediately. Beau Nash and his friends go off quietly. Sheridan remains to wait for Miss Linley.\\" 21\\\\. The Elopement. :\\"Miss Linley runs in from the garden. Beau Nash urges them to hurry, and she disappears with Sheridan.\\" 22\\\\. Discovery‚ÄîFinale :\\"Her absence is discovered and the whole company enters the scene. The squire and Mr Linley are furious, but everyone else seems delighted. The uproar is silenced by the appearance of the parson, who informs the company that Miss Linley and Mr Sheridan are now man and wife. Evident satisfaction of everyone except the squire and Mr Linley, but the latter accepts the fait accompli. Miss Linley and Sheridan reappear, and receive the congratulations of the assembled company.\\" Recordings and concert performances Beecham conducted a recording of twelve excerpts from the suite, under the title The Great Elopement, with the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1945.

Environmental issues in China are plentiful, severely affecting the country's biophysical environment and human health. Rapid industrialisation, as well as lax environmental oversight, are main contributors to these problems. China is ranked extremely low on the Environmental Performance Index sitting next to Indonesia and Qatar.https://epi.yale.edu/epi-results/2020/component/epi The Chinese government has acknowledged the problems and made various responses, resulting in some improvements, but the responses have been criticized as inadequate.China Weighs Environmental Costs; Beijing Tries to Emphasize Cleaner Industry Over Unbridled Growth After Signs Mount of Damage Done 23 July 2013 In recent years, there has been increased citizens' activism against government decisions that are perceived as environmentally damaging, and a retired official from the Communist Party of China has reported that the year of 2012 saw over 50,000 environmental protests in China.  Environmental policy  In 2012 the Center for American Progress has described China's environmental policy as similar to that of the United States before 1970. That is, the central government issues fairly strict regulations, but the actual monitoring and enforcement is largely undertaken by local governments that are more interested in economic growth. Furthermore, due to the restrictive conduct of China's undemocratic regime, the environmental work of non- governmental forces, such as lawyers, journalists, and non-governmental organizations, is severely hampered. Since 2002, the number of complaints to the environmental authorities increased by 30 percent every year, reaching 600,000 in 2004; meanwhile, according to an article by the director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs Ma Jun in 2007, the number of mass protests caused by environmental issues grew by 29 percent every year since that time. The growing attention upon environmental matters caused the Chinese government to display an increased level of concern towards environmental issues and the creation of sustainable growth. For example, in his annual address in 2007, Wen Jiabao, the Premier of the People's Republic of China, made 48 references to \\"environment,\\" \\"pollution,\\" and \\"environmental protection\\", and stricter environmental regulations were subsequently implemented. Some of the subsidies for polluting industries were cancelled, while some polluting industries were shut down. However, although the promotion of clean energy technology occurred, many environmental targets were missed. After the 2007 address, polluting industries continued to receive inexpensive access to land, water, electricity, oil, and bank loans, while market-oriented measures, such as surcharges on fuel and coal, were not considered by the government despite their proven success in other countries. The significant influence of corruption was also a hindrance to effective enforcement, as local authorities ignored orders and hampered the effectiveness of central decisions. In response to a challenging environmental situation, President Hu Jintao implemented the \\"Green G.D.P.\\" project, whereby China's gross domestic product was adjusted to compensate for negative environmental effects; however, the program lost official influence in spring 2007 due to the confronting nature of the data. The project's lead researcher claimed that provincial leaders terminated the program, stating \\"Officials do not like to be lined up and told how they are not meeting the leadership‚Äôs goals ... They found it difficult to accept this.\\" In 2014 China amended its protection laws to help fight pollution and reverse environmental damage in the country. In 2019, it launched the Belt and Road Initiative International Green Development Coalition. In September 2020 Xi Jinping announced that China will \\"strengthen its 2030 climate target (NDC), peak emissions before 2030 and aim to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060\\". According to Climate Action Tracker if it will be accomplished it will lower the expected rise in global temperature by 0.2 - 0.3 degrees - \\"the biggest single reduction ever estimated by the Climate Action Tracker\\". The announcement was made in the United Nations General Assembly. Xi Jinping mentioned the link between the corona pandemic and nature destruction as one of the reasons for the decision, saying that \\"Humankind can no longer afford to ignore the repeated warnings of nature,\\" On the 27 of September, China's climate scientists presented a detailed plan how to achieve the target, described as \\"The most ambitious climate goal the world‚Äôs ever seen\\". According to the plan GHG emission will begin to decline between 2025 and 2030, while total energy consumption will do so in 2035. By 2050 China will stop producing electricity with coal. By 2025, 20% of energy will be produced without fossil fuels. By 2060 emissions will fall to 200 million and these emissions will be mitigated with Carbon capture and storage, Carbon sequestration, Bioenergy.  Problems = Water resources  The water resources of China are affected by both severe water quantity shortages and severe water quality pollution. An increasing population and rapid economic growth as well as lax environmental oversight have increased water demand and pollution. China has responded by measures such as rapidly building out the water infrastructure and increased regulation as well as exploring a number of further technological solutions. Water usage by its coal-fired power stations is drying-up Northern China.Water Demands of Coal-Fired Power Drying Up Northern China 25 March 2013 Scientific AmericanOn China's Electricity Grid, East Needs West‚Äîfor Coal 21 March 2013 BusinessWeekChinese Utilities Face $20 Billion Costs Due to Water, BNEF Says 24 March 2013 BusinessWeek According to Chinese government in 2014 59.6% of groundwater sites are poor or extremely poor quality.China says more than half of its groundwater is polluted The Guardian 23 April 2014 A 2016 research study indicated that China‚Äôs water contains dangerous amounts of the cancer- causing agent nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA).

In 2011, Conservation International listed the forests of south-west Sichuan as one of the world's ten most threatened forest regions.

Rapid coastal development for agriculture, aquaculture and industrial development are considered the primary drivers of coastal destruction in the region. Land pollution Desertification remains a serious problem, consuming an area greater than the area used as farmland. Although desertification has been curbed in some areas, it is still expanding at a rate of more than 67 km¬≤ every year. 90% of China's desertification occurs in the west of the country.HAN, Jun \\"EFFECTS OF INTEGRATED ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT ON LAND DEGRADATION CONTROL AND POVERTY REDUCTION.\\" Workshop on Environment, Resources and Agricultural Policies in China, 19 June 2006. Retrieved 26 March 2008. Approximately 30% of China's surface area is desert. China's rapid industrialization could cause this area to drastically increase. The Gobi Desert in the north currently expands by about per year. The vast plains in northern China used to be regularly flooded by the Yellow River. However, overgrazing and the expansion of agricultural land could cause this area to increase. In 2009, it was estimated that over 200 high-altitude lakes in Zoig√™ Marsh, which provides 30% of the Yellow River's water, had dried up. In 2001, China initiated a \\"Green Wall of China\\" project. It is a project to create a \\"green belt\\" to hold back the encroaching desert. The first phase of the project, to restore 9 million acres (36,000 km¬≤) of forest, will be completed by 2010 at an estimated cost of $8 billion. The Chinese government believes that, by 2050, it can restore most desert land back to forest. The project is possibly the largest ecological project in history. It has also been criticized on various grounds such as other methods being more effective. In July 2015, Council on Foreign Relations Director of Asia Studies Elizabeth Economy writing in The Diplomat listed soil contamination as a \\"poor stepchild\\" of the Chinese environmental movement, and questioned whether or not recent measures from the Ministry of Environmental Protection would be adequate in combating the problem. In her 2004 book The River Runs Black, she wrote, \\"China's spectacular economic growth over the past two decades has dramatically depleted the country's natural resources and produced skyrocketing rates of pollution. Environmental degradation has also contributed to significant public health problems, mass migration, economic loss, and social unrest.\\" Climate change Since 2000, rising emissions in China and the rest of world have eclipsed the output of the United States and Europe., Table 7. Per person, the United States generates carbon dioxide at a far faster rate than other primary regions. The position of the Chinese government on climate change is contentious. China is the world's current largest emitter of carbon dioxide although not the cumulative largest. China has ratified the Kyoto Protocol, but as a non-Annex I country is not required to limit greenhouse gas emissions under terms of the agreement. Pollution Various forms of pollution have increased as China have industrialized which has caused widespread environmental and health problems. China has responded with increasing environmental regulations and a build-up of pollutant treatment infrastructure which have caused improvements on some variables. As of 2013 Beijing, which lies in a topographic bowl, has significant industry, and heats with coal, is subject to air inversions resulting in extremely high levels of pollution in winter months. In response to an increasingly problematic air pollution problem, the Chinese government announced a five-year, US$277 billion plan to address the issue. Northern China will receive particular attention, as the government aims to reduce air emissions by 25 percent by 2017, compared with 2012 levels, in those areas where pollution is especially serious. According to a report published by Greenpeace and Peking University‚Äôs School of Public Health in December 2012, the coal industry is responsible for the highest levels of air pollution (19 percent), followed by vehicle emissions (6 percent). Ambient air pollution is measured by the amount of particulate matter in the air. This is a result of burning fossil fuels. ‚ÄúBecause coal is the primary fuel used to power China‚Äôs industrial sector, it is responsible for about 40 percent of the deadly fine particulate matter found in China‚Äôs atmosphere.‚Äù In January 2013, fine airborne particulates that pose the largest health risks, rose as high as 993 micrograms per cubic meter in Beijing, compared with World Health Organization guidelines of no more than 25. The World Bank estimates that 16 of the world's most-polluted cities are located in China. Coastal pollution is widespread, leading to declines in habitat quality and increasing harmful algal blooms. The largest algal bloom recorded in history occurred in China around the southern Yellow Sea in 2008, and was easily observed from space. Rising affluence is another indirect cause of pollution. In particular, car ownership has skyrocketed. In 2014, China added a record 17 million new cars to the road and car ownership reached 154 million.Xinhua News, \\"Car ownership tops 154 million in China in 2014 ,\\" 27 January 2015. Population China currently has the world's largest population but population growth is very slow in part due to the one-child policy. The environmental issues are also negatively affecting the people living in China. Because of the emissions created from the factories, the number of people diagnosed with cancer in China has increased. Lung cancer is the most common form of cancer that is plaguing the population. In 2015, there were more than 4.3 million new cancer cases in the country and more than 2.8 million people died from the disease.  Energy efficiency  According to a 2007 article, during the 1980 to 2000 period the energy efficiency improved greatly. However, in 1997, due to fears of a recession, tax incentives and state financing were introduced for rapid industrialization. This may have contributed to the rapid development of very energy inefficient heavy industry. Chinese steel factories used one-fifth more energy per ton than the international average. Cement needed 45 percent more power, and ethylene needed 70 percent more than the average. Chinese buildings rarely had thermal insulation and used twice as much energy to heat and cool as those in the Europe and the United States in similar climates. 95% of new buildings did not meet China's own energy efficiency regulations. A 2011 report by a project facilitated by World Resources Institute stated that the 11th five-year plan (2005 to 2010), in response to worsening energy intensity in the 2002-2005 period, set a goal of a 20% improvement of energy intensity. The report stated that this goal likely was achieved or nearly achieved. The next five-year plan set a goal of improving energy intensity by 16%.ChinaFAQs: China‚Äôs Energy Conservation Accomplishments of the 11th Five Year Plan, ChinaFAQs on 25 July 2011, http://www.chinafaqs.org/library/chinafaqs/chinas- energy-conservation-accomplishments-11th-five-year-plan  Animal welfare  A 2005-2006 survey by Prof. Peter J. Li found that many farming methods that the European Union is trying to reduce or eliminate are commonplace in China, including gestation crates, battery cages, foie gras, early weaning of cows, and clipping of ears/beaks/tails. Livestock in China may be transported over long distances, and there are currently no humane-slaughter requirements. China farms about 10,000 Asiatic black bears for bile production‚Äîan industry worth roughly $1.6 billion per year. The bears are permanently kept in cages, and bile is extracted from cuts in their stomachs. Jackie Chan and Yao Ming have publicly opposed bear farming. In 2012, over 70 Chinese celebrities took part in a petition against an IPO application by Fujian Guizhentang Pharmaceutical Co. due to the company's selling of bear-bile medicines. China is the biggest fur-producing nation. Some fur animals are skinned alive, and others may be beaten to death with sticks. According to Prof. Peter J. Li, a few Chinese zoos are improving their welfare practices, but many remain \\"outdated\\", have poor conditions, use live feeding, and employ animals for performances. Safari parks may feed live sheep and poultry to lions as a spectacle for crowds. China currently has no animal-welfare laws. In 2006, Zhou Ping of the National People's Congress introduced the first nationwide animal-protection law in China, but it didn't move forward. In September 2009, the first comprehensive Animal protection law of the People's Republic of China was introduced, but it hasn't made any progress. In 2016, the Chinese government adopted a plan to reduce China's meat consumption by 50%, for achieving more sustainable and healthy food system.  Natural disasters  According to Jared Diamond, the six main categories of environmental problems of China are: air pollution, water problems, soil problems, habitat destruction, biodiversity loss and mega projects.Jared Diamond, Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, Penguin Books, 2005 and 2011 (). See chapter 12 entitled \\"China, Lurching Giant\\" (pages 258-377). He also explain that \\"China is noted for the frequency, number, extent, and damage of its natural disasters\\". Some natural disasters in China are \\"closely related to human environmental impacts\\", especially: dust storms, landslides, droughts and floods. Community activism Protests commenced in the southern town of Yinggehai in April 2012 following the announcement of a power plant project to be constructed in the small town. The protesters initially succeeded in halting the project, worth 3.9 billion renminbi (¬£387m) plant, as another town was selected for the location of the plant; however, the residents in the second location also resisted and the authorities returned to Yinggehai. A second round of protests occurred in October 2012 and police engaged aggressively with around 1,000 protesters on this occasion, leading to 50 arrests and almost 100 injuries (according to reports from the Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy, a Hong Kong-based rights group). In response to a waste pipeline for a paper factory in the city of Qidong, several thousand demonstrators protested in July 2012. According to the Xinhua news agency, 16 protesters from Qidong were sentenced in early 2013 to between 12 and 18 months in prison; however, 13 were granted a reprieve on the grounds that they had confessed and repented.

It mostly consists of low-density, single detached dwellings. As of 2009, the area is home to 2,232 residents. The neighbourhood is considered a lower-income area, with an average family income of $44,729, an average dwelling value of $162,491 and a home ownership rate of 68.9%. According to MLS data, the average sale price of a home as of 2013 was $207,347. History The area that now makes up Westmount was settled by homesteaders in 1884, as the east bank settlement of Saskatoon struggled for survival. A settler named Archibald L. Brown was one such landowner, owning a section of land where Westmount School would later be built. The neighbourhood was within the city limits when the City of Saskatoon incorporated in 1906. At that time it was the city's northwest corner, hence the name. The streets in Westmount are named for early settlers of the Saskatoon area, and most of the houses were built prior to 1960. The neighbourhood appeared on a surveyors' map in 1911. The current boundaries of Westmount include some of an area called Ruskin Place, which appears on a 1913 map of registered subdivisions. Westmount School was opened on April 3, 1913. It was designed by architect David Webster, who designed six of Saskatoon's Collegiate Gothic style elementary schools between 1910 and 1914. E.D. Feehan High School was opened in 1967, and named in honour of Edward Daniel Feehan, a former superintendent of separate schools in Saskatoon. It is designated a bilingual English and Ukrainian school, and also has classes in Cree and Spanish. McMillan Avenue, which forms part of Westmount's western boundary, is named for Frank McMillan. He was a Toronto businessman who moved to Saskatoon, owned several successful businesses, and built several landmark buildings downtown. He would serve as Saskatoon's mayor and later a Member of Parliament. Development prior to 1927 was haphazard, which sometimes resulted in irregularity between neighbourhood streets between Westmount and Caswell Hill. In 1927, the first formal town planning board was established. Westmount was zoned Residence A District, which limited development to one and two-family houses of no more than two- and-a-half storeys. In its recent history, Westmount has become a lower-income inner city neighbourhood. It and other core neighbourhoods have been the recipients of affordable housing and community economic development initiatives to improve the lives of residents. Government and politics Westmount exists within the federal electoral district of Saskatoon West. It is currently represented by Sheri Benson of the New Democratic Party, first elected in 2015. Provincially, the area is within the constituency of Saskatoon Centre. It is currently represented by David Forbes of the Saskatchewan New Democratic Party, first elected in 2001. In Saskatoon's non- partisan municipal politics, Westmount lies within ward 2. It is currently represented by Hilary Gough, first elected in 2016.

Alfred Kunz Father Alfred Joseph Kunz, (April 15, 1931 - March 4, 1998), was a Catholic priest who was found with his throat slit in his Roman Catholic church in Dane, Wisconsin. The still-unsolved murder investigation has been described as the most expensive and time-consuming investigation in Dane County's history. Career Kunz, though he continued to say the Latin Mass, also said the Mass in English and was in communion with his diocesan bishop. \\"Father Kunz was a well-known expert in canon law, so he knew how to walk the lines,\\" Bill Brophy, a spokesman for the Madison, Wisconsin Catholic Diocese said shortly after his murder. Kunz was pastor at the church for 32 years before his death. Prior to his death, Kunz had his own radio show and had been a close associate of Malachi Martin, an author and exorcist. After Kunz was murdered, Martin alleged that the priest had been killed by \\"Luciferians\\" and said Kunz had performed several exorcisms before his death. Martin said Kunz felt his life was in danger in the weeks before his murder. Kunz's friend, Abbot Ryan St. Anne Scott felt Kunz's murder was related to Kunz's investigation of sexual abuse scandals in the diocese. Death The Dane County Sheriff's Department also investigated a calf mutilation 15 miles from Kunz's church the day before his murder that a farmer attributed to a cult. Kunz had allegedly been investigating reports of homosexuality and sexual abuse by priests within the diocese of Springfield, Illinois. There were also allegations that Kunz had been involved with female parishioners. (available at Google news) \\"The motives are all over the place, anything from jealousy, power and control to betrayal and fear of exposure,\\" Dane County Sheriff's Detective Kevin Hughes said in 2001. \\"So take your pick at this point. We just don't know yet.\\" In 2002, Dane County sheriff Gary Hamblin stated that his department was still receiving tips about the case. By this time, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, investigators had concluded that the killer knew Kunz and was familiar with the church property. Dane County Sheriff David Mahoney stated in March 2008 that his department no longer uses the term \\"intimate\\" in regard to the murder investigation of Father Kunz, which dispels any hint of impropriety. Mahoney is also willing to cooperate with \\"cold case\\" investigators, even though his department does not consider the Kunz investigation \\"cold.\\"New Hope in Case of Murdered Priest International News Analysis Today, by Toby Westerman. 17 March 2008 By 2009, investigators with the Dane County sheriff's department were willing to state that they have a long-time suspect, who has never been named as they lack sufficient evidence to indict him. Steve Gilmore, lieutenant of detectives with the department, said that the suspect left town soon after Kunz's death. Gilmore also said, \\"We still know where he's at and what he's up to. If indeed he had committed this one, he's stayed pretty clean. We certainly don't think there's any threat to the public out there.\\" Gilmore has also stated that the suspect is alive () and under constant surveillance, although no longer living in the Dane County jurisdiction.

She is the youngest woman to be elected to federal parliament, winning election at the age of 25 and taking office at the age of 26. She was the youngest person ever elected to the Senate (although several others have been appointed at younger ages), until Jordon Steele-John was elected on a recount in 2017.Rob Lundie & Martin Lumb \\"Selected political records of the Commonwealth Parliament\\" (Parliament of Australia) . Access date: 1 March 2017. Early life and education Hanson-Young was born in Melbourne, and grew up near Orbost in East Gippsland. In 1999 she was awarded the Australia Day Young Citizen of the Year award for Gippsland, Victoria. She graduated from the University of Adelaide with a Bachelor of Social Sciences in 2002. While studying, she was Environment Officer from 2001 to 2002, and then President from 2002 to 2003, of the Students' Association of the University of Adelaide. Career In 2004, Hanson-Young worked as a bank teller. From 2004, until she took parliamentary office in 2008, she worked for Amnesty International as Campaign Manager for South Australia and the Northern Territory. In 2006, she was studying for a postgraduate law degree. Prior to her entry into politics, she also worked as media advisor to Mark Parnell (SA Greens) in the 2006 South Australian election and was a campaigner with Justice for Refugees (SA). Political career Hanson in 2009 Hanson-Young was a candidate for the South Australian Legislative Council in the 2006 state election, ranked fourth on the Greens' ticket. Hanson-Young was elected senator for South Australia at the 2007 federal election. She was the first Greens senator to be elected in that state, the youngest person‚Äîat 25‚Äîever popularly elected to the Australian senate, and the youngest woman ever elected to the Australian parliament (Natasha Stott Despoja was younger at her first sitting, but older at the time of her election). Although the South Australian Green primary vote remained relatively unchanged, preferences from the Australian Labor Party provided the required quota for a Greens senator. Cathy Perry (ALP) is excluded at count 23, giving 71,615 votes to Sarah Hanson-Young, who achieves quota. Hanson-Young's portfolio responsibilities within the Greens include finance and trade, arts, education, youth, and water and the Murray-Darling Basin. Hanson-Young became the focus of attention on 18 June 2009, when the Senate President ordered the removal of her two-year-old daughter from the Senate chamber during a division. The rules of parliament at the time did not allow for senators or members to bring their children into the chamber. Public reaction on the matter was divided, and ignited a debate on accommodating children and their careers in the workplace. Despite a delay of seven years, the incident led directly to a change in the rules of both the House of Representatives and Senate, which now allow MPs and senators to care for their children for short periods in the chamber. Hanson-Young challenged Christine Milne for the Green deputy leadership in October 2010, but she was unsuccessful. Hanson-Young was critical of the Greens supporting the minority Labor Gillard Government, and wanted the party to negotiate with the Liberal Party. However, plans for these negotiations were stopped by Milne. Following the resignation of Australian Greens leader Bob Brown in 2012, she was again nominated for the deputy leadership but lost by an undisclosed margin to Adam Bandt. Hanson-Young was re-elected to the Senate at the 2013 federal election and again at the 2016 double dissolution election. In December 2013, Hanson- Young, along with Senators Louise Pratt (ALP) and Sue Boyce (LNP) established a cross-party working group on marriage equality.Same-sex couples wait on High Court ruling, Herald Sun, 11 December 2013 In August 2016, Hanson-Young was replaced as the Greens' Immigration spokesperson by Nick McKim. She retained the senior portfolio areas of education and finance. In July 2018 Senator David Leyonhjelm suggested Hanson-Young should \\"stop shagging men\\", during a parliamentary debate on women's safety, in response to a parliamentary interjection by Hanson-Young, which Leyonhjelm interpreted as being to the effect of \\"all men being rapists\\". Hanson-Young has described the idea of all men being rapists as \\"absurd\\". In response to Leyonhjelm's interjection, Hanson-Young called Leyonhjelm a \\"creep\\" before he told her to \\"fuck off\\". Hanson-Young called for Leyonhjelm to resign after Leyonhjelm refused to apologise and commenced crowd fundraising to pay for legal proceedings to sue him for defamation, claiming that any damages awarded would be donated to charity. On 14 August 2018, the Greens moved a motion in the Senate to censure Leyonhjelm for his remarks against Hanson-Young which passed 30‚Äì28. In the defamation court case, Derryn Hinch has given evidence that Hanson-Young had said \\"women would not need protection\\" (in the forms proposed by the bill) \\"if men stopped raping women\\", and that this did not mean all men raped women. Hanson-Young won a further six-year senate term in the 2019 federal election, with her party receiving 10.9% of first preference votes, as well as a 5.03% swing in her favour.

On June 1, 2007, the company was dissolved and merged all assets and operations into Southern New England Telephone. History Woodbury Telephone began operation in the 1870s when a local businessman, Mr. Charles A. Stone visited the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition 1876 and realized the value of connecting his grain and feed store to the Southbury Railroad Station via the telephone. The company grew modestly and was incorporated in 1910 with Arthur D. Warner as its first President. The company continued in operation and upgraded from a manual switchboard to a direct dial system in 1955. As the service area grew considerably in the 1970s and 1980s the company deployed digital switching, fiber optic network architecture and in the 1990s it successfully introduced internet service with broadband access. At the time of its acquisition by SNET, the company had 19,000 lines.

Certain geographic areas have been positively correlated with high levels of biocultural diversity, including those of low latitudes, higher rainfalls, higher temperatures, coastlines, and high altitudes. A negative correlation is found with areas of high latitudes, plains, and drier climates. Positive correlations can also be found between biological diversity and linguistic diversity, illustrated in the overlap between the distribution of plant diverse and language diverse zones. Social factors, such as modes of subsistence, have also been found to affect biocultural diversity. Measuring biocultural diversity Biocultural diversity can be quantified using QCUs (quantum co-evolution units), and can be monitored through time to quantify biocultural evolution (a form of coevolution). This methodology can be used to study the role that biocultural diversity plays in the resilience of social-ecological systems. It can also be applied on a landscape scale to identify critical cultural habitat for Indigenous peoples. The \\"quantum coevolution unit\\" (QCU) was first proposed in 2009 by Kawika B. Winter and Will McClatchey as a unit of measure for coevolution between people and plants, but has applications for quantifying other forms of coevolution. Linguistic diversity Cultural traditions are passed down through language, making language an important factor in the existence of biocultural diversity. There has been a decline in the number of languages globally. The Linguistic Diversity Index has recorded that between 1970 and 2005, the number of languages spoken globally has decreased by 20%. This decline has been especially observed in indigenous languages, with a 60% decline in the Americas, 30% in the Pacific, and 20% in Africa. Currently, there are 7,000 languages being spoken in the world. Half the population speaks only 25 of these languages, the top 5 in order being Mandarin, Spanish, English, Hindi, and Bengali. The remaining 6975 languages are divided between the other half of the population. Because languages develop in a given community of speakers as that society adapts to its environment, languages reflect and express the biodiversity of that area. In areas of high biodiversity, language diversity is also higher, suggesting that a greater diversity in culture can be found in these areas. In fact, many of the areas of the world inhabited by smaller, isolated communities are also home to large numbers of endemic plant and animal species. As these people are often considered to be \\"stewards\\" of their environments, loss of language diversity means a disappearance of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), an important factor in the conservation of biodiversity. Declaration of Belem Awareness about the balance between biological and cultural diversity has been increasing for a few decades. At the first international congress on ethnobiology in 1988, scientists met with indigenous peoples to discuss ways to better manage the use of natural resources and protect vulnerable communities around the world. They developed the Declaration of Belem, named after the city where the congress was held, which outlined eight steps to ensure conservation efforts would be implemented effectively. Hotspots of biocultural diversity There are three areas which have been identified as hotspots of biocultural diversity: The Amazon Basin, Central Africa, and Indomalaysia/Malenesia. Hot spots of biocultural diversity can be calculated by averaging a countries biological diversity and cultural diversity. Cultural diversity is scored based on \\"a country's language diversity, religion diversity, and ethnic group diversity\\". Recent programs in the Eastern Himalayas have also engaged this concept to promote conservation. Biocultural conservation In 2000, Ricardo Rozzi coined the term biocultural conservation to emphasize that ‚Äú1) conservation biology issues involve [ontologically, epistemologically, and ethically] both humans and other living beings, 2) biological and cultural diversity are inextricably integrated, and 3) social welfare and biocultural conservation go together‚Äù (p. 10). Ricardo Rozzi. 2001. Introduccion. In Fundamentos de Conservaci√≥n Biol√≥gica: Perspectivas Latinoamericanas, eds. R. Primack, R. Rozzi, P. Feinsinger, R. Dirzo, & F. Massardo), pp. 1-22. Fondo de Cultura Econ√≥mica: M√©xico. Then, Rozzi and collaborators proposed participatory approaches to biocultural conservation, identifying ten principles: 1) interinstitutional cooperation, (2) a participatory approach, (3) an interdisciplinary approach, (4) networking and international cooperation, (5) communication through the media, (6) identification of a flagship species, (7) outdoor formal and informal education, (8) economic sustainability and ecotourism, (9) administrative sustainability, and (10) research and conceptual sustainability for conservation. These principles were effective for establishing the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve, Chile, at the southern end of the Americas, involving multiple actors, disciplines, and scales. Ricardo Rozzi, Francisca Massardo, Christopher Anderson, Kurt Heidinger, John Silander Jr. 2006. Ten Principles for biocultural conservation at the southern tip of the Americas: The approach of the Omora Ethnobotanical Park. Ecology and Society 11(1): 43. [online] URL: http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol11/iss1/art43/ Biocultural restoration Biocultural restoration endeavors to revive the many connections between cultures and the biodiversity they are founded on. This can be done in a larger effort to restore resilience in social-ecological systems. While some have questioned the conservation value of biocultural restoration, recent research has shown that such approaches can be in alignment with core conservation goals. The Hawaiian renaissance in Hawaii is held up as a global model for biocultural restoration within the scholarly literature on the topic.

The song is an up-tempo number, in which Str√∏m sings about the difficulties she faces in life. The cure for these, she sings, is to borrow some of the mystique of Mata Hari, to whom she addresses the song. The sexual exploits of the famous woman are implied to have been considerable.  Description  Composers Frode Thingn√¶s and Philip A. Kruse were invited by the Norwegian Broadcaster NRK to write a song for the Norsk Melodi Grand Prix 1976, and the result was \\"Mata Hari\\". The song was one of five that participated in the Norwegian final at NRK Marienlyst in Oslo on February 7, 1976. The song was last in the competition and was performed by Gudny Aspaas on the slow-beat rock tempo while Anne-Karine Str√∏m on a groovy style tune. A public jury of a thousand people chose the song until a clear winner wins. \\"Mata Hari\\" got 643 points, almost twice the number of second place \\"Voodoo\\". Despite the superb victory, the winning song did not hit, and it did not enter the VG list . While VG thought Norway had finally chosen a winning song with a advance in the Eurovision Song Contest, the people were not very positive. After the finale, the newspaper's watch phone glowed, and the comments were numerous: \\"After this muck, I'll give away my color television if you come and pick it up,\\" said a man from √Ölesund. An Unknown Woman said that her 6-year-old daughter had urged to turn off the sound while the Grand Prix went on air and She was admired by pictures. NRK's switchboard was also called down by irritated TV viewers, and Aftenposten summarized the finale as stated as Possible worse than ever.  Eurovision Song Contest  The song was recorded and revamped in English Language while the preparation for the Eurovision Song Contest as stated in the rules. The song was performed ninth on the night, following the Netherlands' Sandra Reemer with \\"The Party's Over\\" and preceding Greece's Mariza Koch with \\"Panayia Mu, Panayia Mu\\". At the close of voting, it had received 7 points, placing 18th (last) in a field of 18. Str√∏m had represented Norway at Eurovision twice before, once in 1973 as part of vocal group The Bendik Singers and again as a solo performer in the 1974 Contest. As of 2012, Str√∏m still holds the record as the only artist in the history of Eurovision to have finished in last place twice. The first time came in 1974 with the song \\"The First Day of Love\\". Anne was succeeded as Norwegian representative at the 1977 contest by Anita Skorgan with \\"Casanova\\".

She is well known for her contributions to research on language and identity within sociocultural linguistics, and especially the tactics of intersubjectivity framework developed with Kira Hall. Bucholtz's work focuses largely on language use in the United States, and specifically on issues of language and youth; language, gender, and sexuality; African American English; and Mexican and Chicano Spanish.  Biography  Bucholtz received a B.A. in Classics from Grinnell College in 1990 and an M.A. and Ph.D. in Linguistics from UC Berkeley in 1992 and 1997. She has held previous academic positions at Stanford and Texas A&M.; At UC Santa Barbara, where she has worked as an assistant professor (2002-2004), an associate professor (2004-2008) and a full professor (2008‚Äìpresent), Bucholtz is affiliated with several departments, including the Department of Anthropology, the Department of Feminist Studies, the Department of Spanish and Portuguese, the Gevirtz Graduate School of Education, the Comparative Literature Program, and the Latin American and Iberian Studies Program. Since 2011, she has also directed the Center for California Languages and Cultures within UC Santa Barbara's Institute for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Research. Through her work at the Center for California Languages and Cultures, Bucholtz has been the director (2009-2017) and associate director (2017‚Äìpresent) of a community partnership program, School Kids Investigating Language in Life + Society (SKILLS), which provides linguistics research opportunities to students enrolled in Santa Barbara high schools. Bucholtz has been an editorial board member for several journals. She served as series editor for Studies in Language and Gender from 1998-2013, editor of the Journal of Linguistic Anthropology from 2002-2004, and an editorial board member of Language in Society (2005-2012), Gender and Language (2005-2014), Journal of Sociolinguistics (2007-2011), American Anthropologist (2008-2012), and Text and Talk (2011-2014). She still serves as an editorial board member of the Journal of Linguistic Anthropology (from 1999-2001 and since 2005), Visual Communication (since 2004), the International Journal on Research in Critical Discourse Analysis (since 2005), Language and Linguistics Compass (since 2006), American Speech (since 2008), Research on Language and Social Interaction (since 2009), Pragmatics and Society (since 2009), and Discourse, Context, and Media (since 2011). She has also been an advisory board member for Gender and Language since 2014. From 2000-2001, Bucholtz was appointed as the chair of the Nominations Committee of the Society for Linguistic Anthropology. She was also elected to serve as an advisory council member and co-chair for the International Gender and Language Association from 2000-2004. Bucholtz was recognized in 2014 by the Society for Linguistic Anthropology with the Award for Public Outreach and Community Service.  Research & Work  As a sociocultural linguist, Bucholtz has focused on researching how language is used in interactional contexts to create identity and culture and contribute to issues of social power.  Language and youth  In the late 1990s, Bucholtz began ethnographic work on the ways adolescents and pre-adolescents construct identity. Her research extended the work of Penelope Eckert, who identified three adolescent social categories (Jocks, Burnouts, and In-betweens) concerned with pursuing \\"coolness.\\" From 1994-1996, Bucholtz studied another social category, \\"Nerds,\\" using a California high school in the San Francisco Bay Area as her field site. She initially presented her work on Nerd girls at the 1997 International Conference on Language and Social Psychology. Bucholtz positions the \\"Nerd\\" as a separate and distinct community of practice set in opposition to the Burnouts, Jocks and In-betweens: Nerds purposely reject the Burnouts', Jocks', and In-betweens' pursuit of \\"coolness\\" and instead prioritize knowledge and individuality. Bucholtz uses the concepts of positive identity practices (linguistic and social behaviors that confirm and reflect an intragroup identity) and negative identity practices (linguistic and social behaviors that distance individuals from other groups) to show how Nerds construct their community of practice. Her research suggests that the Nerd identity is \\"hyperwhite\\", characterized linguistically by more infrequent use of Valley girl speech and slang than other social categories; by a preference for Greco- Latinate over Germanic words; by the use of the discourse practice of punning; and by adherence to conventions of \\"super-standard English,\\" or excessively formal English. Additionally, Bucholtz found that the speech of Nerds often included consonant-cluster simplification, phonological reduction of unstressed vowels, careful and precise enunciation, and reading style speech (wherein Nerds pronounce words more closely to how they're spelled). She proposes that these linguistic practices and features are used to establish the Nerd's intragroup identity marker of intelligence.  Selected bibliography = Books    Book chapters  * Pdf. * Pdf.

Harry R. Dammer, University of Scranton \\"Prison Ministry\\" is a larger concept, including the support of the spiritual and religious needs of prison guards and staff, whose work in an often demanding and brutal environment often creates a special need for pastoral care, similar to the care that is extended to the military, police officers and fire fighters. History The chapel of the Saint-P√©lagie Prison, Paris Many religious groups often supply scripture and reading material, organize programs and worship, and train chaplains for work in prisons. Members of religious groups also engage in missionary activity, as there have been many instances of conversion throughout history. For instance, one of the earliest introductions of Islam into Eastern Europe was through the work of an early 11th-century Muslim prisoner who was captured by the Byzantines during their war against Muslims. The Muslim prisoner was brought into the territory of the Pechenegs, where he taught and converted individuals to Islam.The preaching of Islam: a history of the propagation of the Muslim faith. Sir Thomas Walker Arnold, p. 335 In the United States, early colonists originated the concept of the penitentiary as a place where inmates would demonstrate their penance and remorse for their crimes through prayer and reflection.Clear, Todd R., Cole, George F., Reisig, Michael D. 2008. American Corrections. Florence, KY: Cengage Learning. English prison chaplains also heard confessions from condemned prisoners, some of which were published ‚Äì for example, the 18th century Ordinary of Newgate's Account. Such accounts presented the prisoners as coming to terms with their guilt and preparing for salvation. Chaplains have worked with prisoners and prison staff for many years, even before formal legislation addressed the constitutional rights of inmates. A 2005 Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion study suggests that the practice of religion significantly reduces the chance of prisoners to engage in verbal or physical altercations, and increases the likelihood of reform after completing prison sentence time.UAB Study Finds Religion Helps Reduce Negative Prison Behaviors.

According to research conducted by sociologist Harry R.

A 1986 documentary film of the same name was developed by producer and writer Rob Epstein and filmmaker Peter Adair. 1984 production The AIDS Show was first produced by Theatre Rhinoceros, a San Francisco based theatre company, in September 1984 as The AIDS Show: Artists Involved with Death and Survival. Initial inspiration for the production came from several people including Allan B. Estes, founder of Theatre Rhinoceros, who died before the shows debut. The intention was to address the fears in the community and to portray how HIV/AIDS was affecting lovers and families. This was one of the first efforts giving voice to the \\"emotional turmoil\\" created by the epidemic. Directed by Leland Moss, the show was more like a review than a play, as it consisted of a series of vignettes built predominantly from the real-life experiences of the cast. The skits or scenes presented the perspectives of nurses, mothers, gay men \\"friend groups\\", romantic relationships, older gay men/women, the straight population, and those who lost loved ones to the disease. The original production was intended to run for nine shows but was extended for several months because it was so well received by audiences. Gaining notoriety, the show traveled throughout the country performing at street fairs, jails, and hospitals. Creators say it was designed to be portable. A notable tour performance took place before the Shanti Project, an organization that trained people to support and guide those who were living with terminal illnesses. The 1984 production was both criticized and applauded for giving such a candid look at how the community was dealing with the crisis. Audience members within the community praised the show for giving form to their experiences, while those in the cast said the play offered a medium for confronting the epidemic. 1985 production In 1985 the play was updated and co-directed by Leland Moss and Douglas Howlsclaw, a writer and actor from the 1984 original. Under the new title The AIDS Show: Unfinished Business, the revised show reflected the change in the \\"mood of the city [San Francisco].\\" By this time HIV/AIDS was not as mysterious as it once was, specific problems in the world of medicine were being addressed, and people were learning to live with the reality of the disease. This new show was designed to mirror this growth. Unfinished Business debuted in October 1985 and continued on various stages for another year.  1986 Documentary  In 1986 a PBS documentary, under the same name as the stage show and created by Rob Epstein and Peter Adair, was released. Epstein and Adair state in the opening of the film that they originally intended to make a film discussing the effect of HIV/AIDS on the population of the 70,000 gay men in the San Francisco area, when a friend pointed them in the direction of The AIDS Show. Upon their first viewing both men noted that the show was more social, less medical, and refused to filter itself when discussing the disease or disease transmission. The end result is a film which consists of interviews featuring several members of the cast and crew, separated by scenes from the production, all in conversation with the current events of San Francisco. This was one of the first films to deal with the subject of HIV/AIDS.

The player explores a dungeon, fights monsters with magic, and avoids traps in real-time without any set mission other than surviving. Lawrence first wrote the game as DND, a 1976 version of Dungeons & Dragons for the DECsystem-10 mainframe computer. He continued to develop DND at Purdue University as a hobby, rewrote the game for the Commodore PET 2001 after 1978, and ported it to Apple II+, TRS-80, and Atari 800 platforms before Avalon Hill found the game at a convention and licensed it for distribution. Its Commodore 64 release was the most popular. Reviewers noted Telengards similarity to Dungeons and Dragons. RPG historian Shannon Appelcline noted the game as one of the first professionally produced computer role-playing games, and Gamasutras Barton considered Telengard consequential in what he deemed \\"The Silver Age\\" of computer role-playing games preceding the golden age of the late 1980s. Some of the game's dungeon features, such as altars, fountains, teleportation cubes, and thrones, were adopted by later games such as Tunnels of Doom (1982).  Gameplay  A player navigates the dungeon in the IBM version In Telengard, the player travels alone through a dungeon fraught with monsters, traps, and treasures in a manner similar to the original Dungeons & Dragons. The game has 50 levels with two million rooms, 20 monster types, and 36 spells. It has no missions or quests, and its only objective is to survive and improve the player character. The game is set in real-time and cannot be paused, so the player must visit an inn to save game progress. In the early releases such as Apple II, the game world has no sound and is represented by ASCII characters, such as slashes for stairs and dollar signs for treasure. Unless the player enters a special cheat code, progress is lost upon dying. The single-player adventure begins by personalizing a player character. Each character has randomly generated values for their statistical character attributes: charisma, constitution, dexterity, intelligence, strength, and wisdom. The algorithm never changes, but the player can randomize repeatedly for new character attribute distributions until satisfied. The player begins with a sword, armor, shield, and no money, and can only see the immediate surroundings, rather than the whole level. Monsters spawn randomly, and players have three options in battle: fight, use magic, or evade. Magic includes combative missiles, fireballs, lightning bolts, turning the undead, health regeneration, and trap navigation. The effects of the game's most complex spells are not outlined in the instruction manual and must be learned by trial and error. Like the game, the battle events are carried out in real-time instead of in turns. Enemies increase in difficulty as the player progresses through the dungeon. They include both living and undead monsters such as elves, dragons, mummies, and wraiths. Defeating enemies awards experience points, which accrete to raise the player's experience level and increase player stats. The player is rewarded with treasures that include magical weapons, armor items, and potions. Players can code their own features into the game.  Development  While a computer science student at Purdue University, Daniel Lawrence wrote several hobbyist computer games for the university's PDP-11 RSTS/E mainframe computer, and one grew into Telengard. In his 1976 and 1977 college summer breaks at home, he worked at BOCES in Spencerport, New York, where he wrote a dungeon crawl game called DND (postdating the similar but unrelated dnd) in the BASIC programming language for the DECsystem-10's TOPS-10 operating system. He had been influenced by the pen and paper role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons. At college, he ported the game to Purdue's PDP-11 RSTS/E. The game's mechanics grew from conversations at the Purdue engineering building. Part of its real- time nature descended from the need to not have players monopolize the few shared computer terminals. In 1978, Lawrence purchased the Commodore PET 2001 and no longer needed the university's computer, though the microcomputer's lack of memory was his primary design obstacle. He rewrote DND as Telengard within eight kilobytes of memory and designed the dungeon to be procedurally generated based on the player-character's position so the maps would not have to be stored in memory. The final version almost completely used 32 kilobytes of memory. It was easily ported to the Apple II+ and TRS-80 platforms due to their similar usage of the 8K BASIC programming language. The later Atari 800 port required a more complicated handling of string variables. The three ports were finished before Avalon Hill saw the game at a gaming convention and licensed it in 1982 as one of its first computer games. The IBM PC port required a rewrite into the C programming language; the source code for this version was later lost. The Heath/Zenith CP/M version requires MBASIC. The game's Commodore 64 port was the most popular. Matt Barton of Gamasutra reported that Lawrence's DND (and consequently, his Telengard) was directly inspired by Whisenhunt and Wood's dnd for PLATO, with its randomized dungeons and minimalist graphics, though Lawrence recalled in an interview that he had not seen or known of their game. Computer Gaming Worlds Scorpia wrote that Telengard was based on the earlier, public domain software Castle Telengard. The game's BASIC source code was available, so ports and remasters were made by the fan community.Telengard on atarihq.comTelengardListing.pdf commented listing on atarihq.comTelengard Remaster 1.1 on the C-64 scene database (2016)  Reception and legacy  Norman Banduch reviewed Telengard in The Space Gamer No. 58, saying \\"Telengard could have been a good game, but is marred by poor programming and lack of polish. If you don't want to rewrite it yourself, wait for the second edition.\\" RPG historian Shannon Appelcline identifies Telengard as one of the first professionally produced computer role-playing games. Gamasutras Barton described the game as a \\"pure dungeon crawler\\" for its lack of diversions, and noted its expansive dungeons as a \\"key selling point\\". AllGame's Earl Green remarked that the game's mechanics were very similar in practice to Dungeons & Dragons, The Commodore 64 Home Companion described it to have Dungeons-and-Dragons style, Computer Gaming Worlds Dick McGrath also said the game \\"borrowed heavily\\" from the original such that he expected its creators to be thanked in the end credits, and Scorpia cited four specific similarities with Dungeons & Dragons. Green described the game as \\"exceedingly simple ... yet very addictive\\" and rated it four of five stars. McGrath wrote that he wanted to have more control over his money, and added that a store for purchasing upgrades would have been useful. He thought that games such as Dunjonquest and Maces and Magic handled this aspect better. McGrath suggested that the player draw their own map in the absence of an overview mapping system. He said that his appreciation for the game grew with time and that it had the necessary hook to make him continually return and play again. Tony Roberts of Compute! considered the Commodore 64 version of the game best for its enhanced graphics. The Commodore 64 GHome Companion agreed, stating that it \\"has some fine sprite graphics and sound effects not found in other versions of the game\\". Scorpia in 1993 stated that while Telengard was \\"interesting for its time, the game would be pretty dated today\\" compared to the Gold Box games; \\"back then, however, it was hot stuff, and a fun way of passing the time\\". Barton of Gamasutra placed Telengard alongside Wizardry and the early Ultima series in what he deemed \\"The Silver Age\\" of computer role-playing games that preceded the golden age of the late 1980s. Yet in 1992, Computer Gaming World Gerald Graef wrote that Telengard and Temple of Apshai were \\"quickly overshadowed\\" by the Wizardry and Ultima series.

It is in the local government district of Newark and Sherwood. The population of the civil parish as at the 2011 Census was 2,731, an increase from 2,681\\"Area: Farnsfield CP (Parish)\\" in the United Kingdom Census 2001. The village lies in a predominantly farming area. There is no major industry or employer within Farnsfield. The majority of residents of working age commute to work, mostly to Nottingham, Mansfield or Newark. Farnsfield's facilities include a small Co-op supermarket and Post Office, a village bakery, butcher, greengrocer, and other small shops. The village has two churches (Anglican and Methodist), a large primary school, and two public houses (The Plough Inn and The Lion). The Southwell Trail,a former railway line dating to 1842 and now adapted as a multi-user route for foot, cycle and horseback use, passes immediately to the north of the village. A free car park for the trail is located off Station Lane. In 1944, during World War II, an RAF Halifax bomber MZ519-LKU crashed on the south side of the village. All on board were killed. The site of the crash has a large memorial.  Location  Farnsfield lies in central Nottinghamshire, approximately 14 miles (22.5 km) north-east of Nottingham, and 4 miles (6.4 km) north-west of Southwell. It is approximately a mile to the east of the main A614 road linking Nottingham to Doncaster.  History  The parish church of St Michael dates from the 15th century, before the Reformation. Following a fire in the mid-19th century, it was rebuilt by Thomas Chambers Hine and Robert Evans in 1859 to 1860. Only a fragment of the tower from the 15th-century building survives. The parish is in the Diocese of Southwell and Nottingham. The area has evidence at several sites of ancient Roman and earlier occupation. To the south of the village, along the footpath to Oxton, are the remains of a small Roman marching camp, marked by a small Roman fort. There are no standing remains in the fields, but outlines of the buildings are clearly visible on aerial photos, including the satellite view on Google Maps. One mile south-west of the village is a small oval earthwork. The remains of a hillfort at Combs Farm is encircled by a bank and ditch. From excavated material, this fort appears to have been Romano- British in origin. Two ditches in a wood at Camp Hill, 1¬Ω miles north-east of Farnsfield, are the remaining traces of an Iron Age earthwork, a hillfort. In the 18th century, researchers estimated it to have been in area.Pevsner, Nikolaus. 1979. The Buildings of England: Nottinghamshire. Harmondsworth, Middx. Penguin. The Roman camp and the ancient hillfort at Combs Farm are both protected Scheduled Monuments. There was a tower windmill on Siding Lane () shown on a map of 1898Ordnance Survey One Inch to Mile, 1898 as an 'old windmill'. It was recorded as a shell in August 1935, with the cap and fantail gone. The mill was owned at some time by a miller named Whitehead, who also milled at Edingley Watermill. When in use, it was powered by a gas engine. The Good Intent Windmill () was a tower mill, built c. 1820 for Holliday, a resident of Farnsfield. Material for building the mill was carted from Fiskerton. The tower was 6 storeys, brick-built and untarred, with 4 sweeps driving 3 pairs of stones (1 French and 2 grey). The mill was worked by William Shaw, who was succeeded by his son Alec c. 1893. The mill was sold to George Hutchinson, who worked it for short periods until the machinery was dismantled and the tower demolished about 1915. A post windmill was recorded near the Junction Inn, owned by Bower.Nottinghamshire Archive ref. DDM 98/59 Sale of windmill 13 XII 1847. alt=On 6 July 1944 an RAF Halifax bomber MZ519-LKU crashed on the south side of the village on its return to RAF Burn near York. The Halifax had been on a mission to destroy a V1 flying bomb site in Nazi-occupied France. All of the Canadian and British crewmen on board were killed. A large memorial was erected at the crash site. A copse of English oaks and Canadian maples were planted and dedicated to the crewmen. A History of Farnsfield was published in 2000 by the Farnsfield Millennium Trust. They also compiled an oral history based on recordings of local people and related transcripts; copies of these were given to the local schools. A copy available in the library is illustrated by local artist Barbara Coulam. Farnsfield is twinned with the French village of Andouill√©. The Lady Goodwin Play Park on Station Lane is named after Lady Florence Goodwin, the wife of philanthropist Sir Stuart Goodwin: he was High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire in 1955. Notable people Both Sir Augustus Charles Gregory and his brother, Francis Gregory, Australian explorers and politicians, were born in Farnsfield. Their family emigrated to Australia in 1829, where they made their careers.

The channel stopped showing new material on 12 April 2012 and broadcast reruns until the channel finally closed on 11 May 2012. History=Launch The channel was established by NDTV Group under the stewardship of former STAR India CEO Sameer Nair. The channel was launched in India on 21 January 2008 as NDTV Imagine. Imagine TV tied up with Karan Johar, the creative consultant and ambassador of the Imagine TV brand. The channel was originally launched by NDTV in partnership with NBCUniversal but NBCUniversal left the partnership in October 2009. In December 2009, online and mobile video service NyooTV agreed a deal with NDTV Imagine to distribute ongoing and past TV shows on the platform. Sale to Turner On 8 December 2009, it was announced that Turner Asia Pacific Ventures (a wholly owned subsidiary of Turner Broadcasting System) had acquired a 92% stake in NDTV Imagine Ltd. NDTV's 76 percent stake in NDTV Imagine would be given to Turner for $67 million, and the Time Warner company would acquire fresh equity worth $50 million to get 92% control. NDTV Imagine Ltd. ran NDTV Imagine, NDTV Lumiere and NDTV Imagine Showbiz television channels and film production transfer of shares, amounting to 85.68% of NDTV Imagine Ltd, by NDTV Networks Plc to Turner Asia Pacific Ventures. The three channels will be under Turner General Entertainment Networks, a holding company that will infuse fresh capital to fund the network's growth. The 'NDTV' brand was dropped and the channels were relabelled Imagine TV, Lumiere Movies and Imagine Showbiz. Imagine Showbiz was sold in January 2011 to Reliance Broadcast Network. Shutdown On 12 April 2012, it was announced that Imagine TV would close, as the channel struggled for ratings amidst competition from rival Hindi entertainment channels, where it was even beaten by the newly launched Life OK. The channel faced the same fate for its sister channel Real.Turner launches Hindi GEC via local JV Real shutters within a year.

Although all of its business operations will close with immediate effect, the channel will continue to air reruns from 13 April, until official obligations ended and it could cease transmissions completely. Imagine TV shut down on 11 May 2012 at midnight in India. As of 12 May 2012, the channel has been removed successfully from all operators. Imagine TV's website was also closed and all episodes and promos were deleted from its YouTube channel. In the Middle East Imagine closed on 30 May 2012, when the channel was replaced by Imagine Movies. The UK and Irish feed of Imagine Dil Se closed on 6 July 2012. The channel's Sky EPG slot was purchased by Viacom 18 to launch Rishtey, a free- to-air sister channel for Colors. International availability In the UK and Ireland, Imagine TV is broadcast on the Sky platform, where it is free-to-air. Due to copyright issues, the channel was unable to use 'Imagine TV' in the region, therefore it was rebranded as Imagine Dil Se, from NDTV Imagine, on 1 November 2010. The feed proved to be a success, beating Star Plus in the UK ratings to become the most watched Asian channel. Some of the shows like Bandini and Jyoti were extremely popular in the region. From 4 February 2009 Imagine was available in the US on the Dish Network platform. Imagine was also available free-to-air on Nilesat in the Middle East. In November 2009, NDTV Imagine launched in Canada in partnership with Canadian broadcaster Ethnic Channels Group and is available on Bell Satellite TV. The channel was rebranded as Imagine Dil Se in early 2011. The channel was also aired in parts of Asia Pacific viz- Fiji, Australia, Japan, Malaysia, apart from Nepal and Bangladesh.

RSCT is the infrastructure used by a variety of IBM products to provide clusters with improved system availability, scalability, and ease of use. It follows a list of main RSCT components: *the Resource Monitoring and Control (RMC) subsystem. This is the scalable, reliable backbone of RSCT. It runs on a single machine or on each node (operating system image) of a cluster and provides a common abstraction for the resources of the individual system or the cluster of nodes. You can use RMC for single system monitoring, or for monitoring nodes in a cluster. In a cluster, however, RMC provides global access to subsystems and resources throughout the cluster, thus providing a single monitoring/management infrastructure for clusters. It is used for HMC DLPAR, sfp, invscout ... *the RSCT core resource managers. A resource manager is a software layer between a resource (a hardware or software entity that provides services to some other component) and RMC. A resource manager maps programmatic abstractions in RMC into the actual calls and commands of a resource. *the RSCT cluster security services, which provide the security infrastructure that enables RSCT components to authenticate the identity of other parties. *the Topology Services subsystem, which, on some cluster configurations, provides node/network failure detection. *the Group Services subsystem, which, on some cluster configurations, provides cross node/process coordination. Management Domains and Peer Domains The set of nodes that is configured for manageability or monitoring is called a management domain of your cluster. The set of nodes that is configured for high availability is called an RSCT peer domain of your cluster. A peer domain is a set of nodes that have a consistent knowledge of the existence of each other and of the resources shared among them. On each node within the peer domain, RMC depends on a core set of cluster services, which include Topology Services, Group Services and cluster security services. A management domain is a set of nodes with resources that can be managed and monitored from one of the nodes, which is designated as the management control point (MCP). All other nodes are considered to be managed nodes. Topology Services and Group Services are not used in a management domain. In order to understand how the various RSCT components are used in a cluster, be aware that nodes of a cluster can be configured for manageability, high availability or both.

CTM was short-lived, and the first production version of AMD's GPGPU technology is now called AMD Stream SDK, or rather the current AMD APP SDK for Windows and Linux 32-bit and 64-bit. APP stands for \\"Accelerated Parallel Processing\\". and also targets Heterogeneous System Architecture. Overview Close To Metal, originally called THIN (Thin Hardware INterface) and Data Parallel Virtual Machine, gave developers direct access to the native instruction set and memory of the massively parallel computational elements in modern AMD video cards. CTM bypassed the graphics-centric DirectX and OpenGL APIs for the GPGPU programmer to expose previously unavailable low-level functionality, including direct control of the stream processors/ALUs and the memory controllers. R580 (ATI X1900) and later generations of AMD's GPU microarchitecture supported the CTM interface. CTM's commercial successor, AMD Stream SDK, was released under AMD EULA in December 2007 after the software stack was rewritten.AMD Stream SDK download page , retrieved June 12, 2008 Stream SDK provides high-level in addition to low-level tools for general- purpose access to AMD graphics hardware. Using GPUs to perform computations holds a lot of potential for some applications because of the fundamental differences of GPU microarchitectures compared to CPUs. GPUs achieve much greater throughput (calculations per second) by executing many programs in parallel and restricting flow control (the ability of one program to execute instructions independently of another).

Propeller synchronization serves mainly to increase the comfort of crew and passengers, since its primary purpose is to reduce the ‚Äúbeats‚Äù generated by propellers that are turning at slightly different speeds. These beats can become very irritating to persons inside the aircraft after a time. Synchronization is not normally necessary for proper operation of the aircraft. Some aircraft provide a visual indicator of propeller synchronization in the cockpit. Pilots can use this indicator to decide whether or not to engage propeller synchronization, or to help them synchronize propeller speeds manually. Synchronizer function Many multiengine airplanes have a propeller synchronizer (prop sync) installed to eliminate the annoying ‚Äúdrumming‚Äù or ‚Äúbeat‚Äù of propellers whose rotation speed are close, but not precisely the same. To use prop sync, the propeller r.p.m. are coarsely matched by the pilot and the system is engaged. The prop sync adjusts the r.p.m. of the ‚Äúslave‚Äù engine to precisely match the r.p.m. of the ‚Äúmaster‚Äù engine, and then maintains that relationship. The prop sync should be disengaged when the pilot selects a new propeller r.p.m., then re-engaged after the new r.p.m. is set. The prop sync should always be off for takeoff, landing, and single-engine operation. The AFM/POH should be consulted for system description and limitations. Propeller synchrophaser A variation on the propeller synchronizer is the propeller synchrophaser. Prop sychrophase acts much like a synchronizer to precisely match r.p.m., but the synchrophaser goes one step further. It not only matches r.p.m. but actually compares and adjusts the positions of the individual blades of the propellers in their arcs. There can be significant propeller noise and vibration reductions with a propeller synchrophaser. From the pilot‚Äôs perspective, operation of a propeller synchronizer and a propeller syncrophaser are very similar. A synchrophaser is also commonly referred to as prop sync, although that is not entirely correct nomenclature from a technical standpoint. Usage As a pilot aid to manually synchronizing the propellers, some twins have a small gauge called a synchroscope mounted in or by the tachometer(s) with a propeller symbol on a disk that spins. The pilot manually fine tunes the engine r.p.m. so as to stop disk rotation, thereby synchronizing the propellers. This is a useful backup to synchronizing engine r.p.m. using the audible propeller beat. This gauge is also found installed with most propeller synchronizer and synchrophase systems. Some synchrophase systems use a knob for the pilot to control the phase angle. Operation of propeller synchronization can occur with a master/slave approach or with a push/pull technique associated with Type II systems. In Type II systems speed is increased for the side lower in RPM while at the same time speed is decreased on the faster RPM side. The net result is similar, but there is no master or slave, and no minute hunting typical of a Type I (master/slave) system. With a Type II system RPM cannot be reduced below manual speed settings so prop sync does not need to be \\"Off\\" during takeoff and landing. Type I systems MUST be off for takeoff and landings.

Plot After scientists accidentally spill a deadly chemical into the ocean, a group of aliens offer to help humans eliminate the chemical. They offer a choice, the Good Package to clean up the mess, or the Big Gun, a weapon capable of destroying the planet. The aliens only ask for a glass of water in return, which must be delivered by CIA agent Pillbox (John Ritter), the only human they entirely trust. While preparing to meet the aliens, agent Pillbox is shot and killed in a forest by an unseen assassin. FBI computers find Bob Wilson (also played by Ritter), an insurance agent who looks just like Pillbox, and suggest sending Wilson in Pillbox's place. However, Wilson is a meek office worker who we initially see being easily pushed around by a group of local bullies and by a milkman who is trying to seduce his wife. Tough guy government agent Nick Pirandello (James Belushi) is sent to recruit Wilson and escort him to the meeting. He meets Wilson at Wilson's home, with Russian agents close on his tail. Wilson thinks Pirandello is an intruder and tries ineffectively to attack him, culminating in a shoot-out with the Russians that devastates Wilson's house. Parindello explains the mission as the pair head to meet the aliens near Washington, D.C. Wilson doesn't believe the story, and instead believes that Pirandello is insane. He repeatedly tries to escape, forcing Parindello to stop and try to convince him they're real. After a series of rather unconvincing demonstrations, one finally convinces Wilson their mission is real. Wilson is then willing to do the job, but lacks skills and confidence. The pair meet corrupt CIA agents dressed as clowns, part of a splinter group that would rather receive the Big Gun. Pirandello tells Wilson that he is in fact a sleeper \\"Super Agent\\", at which point Wilson charges into battle and is knocked out with one punch. Pirandello defeats the clowns, but leads the waking/groggy Wilson to believe he did it. Wilson gains a new macho attitude. Pirandello, weakened by love for a dominatrix he meets in a bar in Pittsburgh, abandons the mission, leaving Wilson on his own. During a final shootout between the rogue CIA element and Wilson, Pirandello comes to his senses and rejoins the mission; together they defeat the others, including Pirandello's boss. Wilson meets with the aliens and receives the Good Package to save humanity. Wilson returns to his home, which has been repaired.

The series takes Emily from age ten to twenty-eight. She starts out a small, dark-haired child with a vivid imagination and passion for writing, and the series closes on her as an adult woman and professional writer. She goes through many difficult times in this period, and deals with near-death experiences, the deaths of those around her, love affairs, psychic experiences, and her quest for fame. Throughout the three novels of this series, Emily grows up an orphan under the care of her strict, old-fashioned relatives, the Murrays. Emily loves the farm (called New Moon), adores Aunt Laura and \\"Cousin Jimmy\\" Murray (Emily's mother's first cousin), but has a difficult relationship with her autocratic, yet not unsympathetic, Aunt Elizabeth. Emily enjoys the stimulating friendship of Dean Priest, a distant relative and former schoolmate of her father, and they are briefly engaged during the final volume of the series. Emily finally marries her childhood sweetheart, Teddy Kent, and her best friend Ilse Burnley is married to another of their friends, Perry Miller, who was also New Moon's hired chore boy in the first volume. Throughout the series, Emily ponders what it means to be a writer and a woman and has 'very decided ideas of what she was going to make of herself'. Living up to her place as a Murray and a woman of New Moon, she often acts to protect her pride and reputation rather than her happiness. Series=Background Emily is the daughter of Douglas Starr, a poor journalist, and Juliet Murray, a woman from an elitist family who would not approve of Juliet's engagement to Douglas and who rejected her when the young couple eloped. Juliet died when Emily was four, and Emily's beloved father dies of consumption at the beginning of the first novel, when Emily is ten. Emily is then taken in by her mother's half-sisters, members of a prominent family in (fictional) Blair Water. Emily Starr is described as slender, tall, and pale, with black hair and grayish-purple ('smoke-purple') eyes. Emily of New Moon  Emily is introduced as a ten-year-old living with her ailing and penniless father. Her mother died several years earlier, after a brief illness. When her father dies, Emily is taken in by her mother's family, and she moves to New Moon, her mother's family's ancestral home, in nearby Blair Water. Emily immediately falls in love with New Moon and soon comes to love her guardians, Aunt Elizabeth, Aunt Laura, and Cousin Jimmy (although she always has a difficult relationship with the old-fashioned and unyielding Elizabeth). Other relatives mentioned in the series are Aunt Ruth Dutton, Uncle Wallace Murray and his wife Aunt Eva, Uncle Oliver Murray and Aunt Addie, and two of their children, Jen and Andrew. Emily, due to her difficult past and her sudden removal to New Moon, experiences something of a culture shock. She eventually makes friends at school (though one of them, Rhoda Stuart, betrays her by revealing that Rhoda is only interested in Emily's social position). At school, Emily meets Ilse Burnley, a neighbour, distant relative, and unconventional tomboy, and they are fast friends throughout the series. She also meets Perry Miller, the hired chore boy at New Moon, and Frederick Kent, known as Teddy, who lives nearby. Emily Climbs  Emily Climbs picks up exactly where Emily of New Moon left off. Emily is finally given permission to go to Shrewsbury High School to further her education (and, in her own mind, her dream of becoming an author). Her friends Ilse, Perry, and Teddy attend the high school with her. Each of the central foursome has dreams toward which he or she is working: Emily, to be a famous writer, Ilse, an elocutionist, Teddy, an artist, and Perry, a business man and/or politician. Emily makes new friends and enemies, endures various scandals, and experiences many triumphs (including having her first 'pieces' of writing published). While studying at the high school, she boards with her aunt, Ruth Dutton. Aunt Ruth is a conservative, seemingly intolerant guardian, who constantly suspects Emily of being secretive and who never gives Emily the benefit of the doubt; however, she does come through in Emily's hour of greatest need. An expatriate Islander, Miss Royal, offers to take Emily to New York and help her with her literary career, but Emily chooses to remain in (rural) Prince Edward Island and work from her beloved New Moon. The novel closes on the central foursome graduating and making plans for their futures: Emily is to go home to New Moon and settle down to her writing career, Ilse and Teddy are going to Montreal, to study elocution and art respectively, and Perry has a job as a law clerk for a big firm in Charlottetown where he expects to be (and ultimately becomes) successful. Emily's Quest  In Emily's Quest, Emily is finally considered \\"grown up\\" by her Murray relatives. She writes constantly, and sends her stories and poetry to magazines where many of them are published. (Later in the book, Emily has a novel published, to significant acclaim.) Emily spends much of her time trying to gain Dean Priest's blessing on her writing; she values his opinion above all others, as he is intelligent, witty, and well-travelled. However, Dean (long in love with Emily) is jealous of her dedication to her 'art', and tells Emily that her stories are 'pretty, childish scribbles'. When he tells Emily that her first (unpublished) novel, 'A Seller of Dreams' is weak and subpar, she burns it. Afterward, in a haze of grief and hysteria, Emily trips and tumbles down the stairs at New Moon. Although the fall itself is not very serious, Emily's foot is pierced by a pair of scissors left on the landing. She nearly dies of blood poisoning, only escaping amputation through Aunt Elizabeth's insistence that Emily not be maimed. Touched by Dean's devotion and affection after her accident, and thinking that Teddy Kent does not care for her any more, Emily agrees to marry Dean, much to the shock and displeasure of both their families (Dean, though wealthy and cultured, is old enough to be her father, and is disabled). However, after a second sight experience that seems to tell her that she 'belongs' to Teddy, Emily realises that she does not love Dean in the way he loves her, and breaks off the engagement. Post-breakup, Emily begins to write again, after a long hiatus. She writes a serialised story (that becomes a new novel) in order to entertain the injured and temporarily-bedridden Aunt Elizabeth. Thanks to Cousin Jimmy, several months later the novel is published, and Emily's artistic dreams are realised. However, pride in her accomplishments does not protect her from the pain and shock of Ilse Burnley's engagement to Teddy Kent. Still too proud to admit that she has feelings for Teddy, Emily, as bridesmaid, helps Ilse with the preparations until the morning of the wedding, when Ilse hears that Perry is on his deathbed after a car accident. Ilse jilts Teddy moments before their scheduled wedding and goes to Perry, who is very much alive (contrary to rumour). Ilse and Perry admit their feelings for each other, and, later, are married quietly. After many years of misunderstandings, Emily and Teddy finally find each other and become betrothed at the close of this, the final volume of the series. Adaptions=Television Emily of New Moon was a 1998 Canadian television series, adapted from the series, that starred Canadian actress Martha MacIsaac as Emily Byrd Starr. Anime In April 2007, the novels were adapted into a 26-episode animated television series in Japan called Kaze no Shoujo Emily. The series was produced by NHK and Tokyo Movie Shinsha. In the series, Emily is voiced by Japanese voice actress Tomoko Kawakami.

He started his career as a commander in the army of the first Vietnamese emperor ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh and rose to the position of commander-in-chief. Following the death of ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh, L√™ Ho√†n became regent to ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh's successor, the six-year-old ƒêinh Toan. L√™ Ho√†n deposed the boy, married his mother, the Empress Dowager Duong Van Nga, and in 980 proclaimed himself emperor. He retained the imperial capital at Hoa L∆∞ and succeeded in warding off several invasions by the Chinese Song Dynasty, but paid them regular tribute with the aim of securing peaceful relations. When he died in 1005, the L√™ Dynasty went into decline. Biography L√™ Ho√†n was born in 941 into a poor family in Bao Thai (Ha Nam). At that time, the area belonged to the kingdom ruled by king Ng√¥ Quy·ªÅn, the Vietnamese general who had liberated the country from Chinese occupation in 938. L√™ Ho√†n was orphaned while still very young, but had the good fortune of being adopted by a local official who belonged to the L√™ family. As L√™ Ho√†n matured under the official's tutelage, he proved himself to be both talented and studious. Mundane assessments of his potential were confirmed by auspicious omens. According to legend, one night his adoptive father went to check up on him after L√™ Ho√†n had gone to bed; he found the boy fast asleep watched by a golden dragon who hovered protectively above him. Following the death of Ng√¥ Quy·ªÅn in 944, the country gradually dissolved into chaos for a time; Ng√¥ Quy·ªÅn's two eldest sons jointly wielded the royal power, but they were not consistently successful in subduing rebellious elements. After they died in 954 and 965 respectively, the country was fractured into the domains of 12 independent warlords. In these chaotic times, L√™ Ho√†n matured to manhood. Together with other young men, he practiced the martial arts and dreamt of saving the nation. After years of conflict, the task of reunifying the country under one rule was accomplished by ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh, a warlord from Hoa L∆∞ in Ninh B√¨nh Province, who succeeded by means of an adept mixed strategy of warfare and diplomacy. In 968, B·ªô Lƒ©nh declared himself Emperor of Dai Co Viet, establishing his capital at Hoa L∆∞. L√™ Ho√†n became a military general under ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh's adult son ƒêinh Li·ªÖn, and was promoted through the ranks until he became the commander-in-chief of ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh's armed forces. Takeover of the country and enthronement as emperor Portrait painting of L√™ Ho√†n. ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh was successful in unifying the country and in defeating his rivals. However, he was not successful in providing for an orderly succession. When he and his eldest son Dinh Lien were murdered in 979 by an official with delusions of seizing royal power for himself, B·ªô Lƒ©nh was succeeded by his six-year-old son Dinh Toan. The boy's mother Duong Van Nga assumed the role of empress dowager, while military commander-in-chief L√™ Ho√†n was made regent, with the idea that he would manage the government until Toan reached the age of maturity.Nhung Tuyet Tran, Anthony Reid Viet Nam: Borderless Histories ‚Äì Page 52- 2006 \\"When L√™ Ho√†n decided to expand his role beyond that of regent of the ƒêinh dynasty's young emperor ƒêinh To√†n to include the position of viceroy, Prime Minister Nguy”ºn B”Æc and another high official, Dinh /i”∏n, became suspicious of... The transition did not go smoothly. Other great men of the realm suspected that L√™ Ho√†n would soon attempt to seize power from himself, and went into open rebellion. In addition, the Song Dynasty of China took note of the weakened condition of Dai Co Viet and began to make plans for reconquering the country. The situation was most uncertain. L√™ Ho√†n, however, was able to suppress domestic opposition to his ascendency. Thereafter, and in collaboration with the empress dowager (the widow of Dinh Bo Linh and mother of Dinh Toan), he deposed the child king, married his mother, and in 980 declared himself Emperor at Hoa L∆∞. It was the end of the ƒêinh family's reign, and the beginning of the his royal family as Early L√™ Dynasty, so called in order to distinguish it from the Later L√™ family established in the early 15th century by L√™ L·ª£i.Nola Cooke, Tana Li, James Anderson The Tongking Gulf Through History ‚Äì 2011 Page 96 \\"fled to the Ruxi garrison on the Song side of the frontier, where the local commander Huang Lingde, likely from an upland Tai-speaking clan, offered the refugees official protection.25 L√™ Ho√†n ordered the Tri√™u D∆∞∆°ng township's military. Foreign relations with Song dynasty and Champa The beginning of L√™ Ho√†n's 25-year reign was marked by wars against the foreign powers of Song and Champa, both of which attempted to take advantage of the apparent weakness of the independent ƒê·∫°i C·ªì Vi·ªát following the death of Dinh Bo Linh. L√™ Ho√†n's success in these wars, together with his ongoing diplomatic efforts in relation to Song ensured that, for the time being, the country's borders were secure. It was not longer after L√™ Ho√†n's usurpation of the throne that an ambassador of the Song came to Hoa L∆∞. The ambassador demanded L√™ Ho√†n's immediate submission to the emperor of Song, promising that if he complied with the demand, he would be shown clemency, and threatening that if he did not comply, it would soon be too late for regrets. A diplomatic chessmatch ensued. L√™ Ho√†n sent an emissary to China in the name of the deposed ƒêinh To√†n; the emissary pretended that To√†n was still the head of the country and offered submission in the name of the ƒêinh dynasty. Emperor Taizong, for his part, attempted to lull L√™ Ho√†n into neglecting his military preparations by sending news that he would be willing to accept the submission of ƒêinh To√†n. L√™ Ho√†n, however, was not fooled. Remembering the success of Ng√¥ Quy·ªÅn who, half a century earlier, had defeated the Chinese navy as it attempted to invade ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát by way of the B·∫°ch ƒê·∫±ng River, he copied Quyen's strategy of booby-trapping the river with long sharpened stakes that were out of sight beneath the surface of the water at high tide. L√™ Ho√†n also strengthened his army by recruiting and training many new soldiers. The Song launched their invasion in 981. Their initial move was to launch a two pronged attack, consisting of an army and a naval force against the former capital of Dai La located in the area of modern Hanoi. The plan was for the two armies to unite and to strike southward against L√™ Ho√†n's capital of Hoa L∆∞. However, both armies were thwarted in their advance. The naval force attempted to make its way up the B·∫°ch ƒê·∫±ng river and ran into the stakes that the Vietnamese had planted there in preparation. The second Battle of B·∫°ch ƒê·∫±ng ended in a decisive defeat for the Chinese. The land army became mired in broken terrain, where it likewise suffered a decisive defeat. The remainder of the Chinese force retreated north. The Song emperor Taizong accused and executed the generals responsible for the Chinese defeat, but thereafter desisted from ordering any further invasions of ƒê·∫°i C·ªì Vi·ªát. To the South, the Indic kingdom of Champa also saw the chaotic condition of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát as an opportunity. In 979, after the death of ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh, the King of Champa, Parameshvaravarman I launched an unsuccessful maritime expedition against Hoa L∆∞, but his hopes were dashed when a storm destroyed much of his fleet. When the threat of the Chinese invasion was looming, L√™ Ho√†n sent an ambassador to Champa to establish friendly relations, but the king of Champa would have none of it and had the ambassador arrested. In 982, with the Chinese invasion having been turned back, L√™ Ho√†n personally led his troops south to sack the capital of Champa. His loot included women from the king's entourage, gold, silver and other precious objects.Maspero, G., 2002, The Champa Kingdom, Bangkok: White Lotus Co., Ltd., After repulsing the Song invasion of 981, L√™ Ho√†n pursued a policy of reconciliation with the Song Empire. He sent diplomats to the Song court in Dongjing and received Song emissaries in Hoa L∆∞. In addition, he consented to the Song Emperor's offers to award him traditional titles held by top Chinese officials during the Tang- era Chinese occupation of Vietnam: \\"Governor of Annam\\", and \\"Peaceful Sea Military Governor.\\" However, he refused to genuflect before a Chinese emissary, giving the phony excuse of being unable to do so due to an injury, and attempted to intimidate the emissary with displays of military force and bizarre gifts of a tiger and a python. On one occasion, L√™ Ho√†n assigned a learned monk named ƒê·ªó Thu·∫≠n to impersonate a menial servant and to impress a Chinese diplomat with his literary acumen, and thus to convey the impression that the ordinary people of the realm were skilled in Chinese poetry and speech. Thus, L√™ Ho√†n complied with Emperor Taizong's demand for recognition, while at the same time signalling his own independence and potential for belligerence. Domestic affairs : Development of the country and the state On the domestic scene, the reign of L√™ Ho√†n was marked by efforts to strengthen the fragile structure of the infant Vietnamese state and to put the country on the path of development. L√™ Ho√†n appointed a group of senior officials to help him in managing the civil and military affairs of the state. He divided the country into districts and subdistricts and appointed local officials to manage them. However, the structure of the Vietnamese government remained rudimentary, and the king relied in part on his own sons to second his command. Several of his sons were made provincial governors, with the authority to collect taxes and to have personal armies. L√™ Ho√†n also relied extensively on the already established network of Buddhist monks as advisors and administrators. The core of the army was the Forbidden Palace Guard. Other units were raised and disbanded according to need. Each member of the guard had the words \\"Army of the Son of Heaven\\" tattooed on his forehead in Chinese characters. The administration of justice remained a matter of official discretion rather than written laws. As a deterrent to wouldbe offenders, L√™ Ho√†n maintained the spectacular forms of punishment devised by ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh: violators could be handed over to a ferocious tiger, or cast into a vat of boiling oil. Under L√™ Ho√†n, new temples and residential and governmental palaces were constructed in the capital of Hoa L∆∞. Nh·∫•t Tr·ª• Pagoda still stands at Hoa L∆∞, and includes a pillar that is believed to date from the original foundation of L√™ Ho√†n. L√™ Ho√†n tried to promote the development of agriculture in the country. In 987, he revived an ancient Chinese ploughing ceremony, in which the ruler of the country ploughs the first field. In later times, other Vietnamese dynasties followed his example in celebrating the ploughing ceremony. To lubricate the economy, L√™ Ho√†n ordered the casting of bronze coins, each bearing an inscription of four Chinese characters. He also ordered extensive construction and maintenance of key routes of communication, including not only a system of roads but also a network of canals. Death L√™ ƒê·∫°i H√†nh's tomb at Hoa L∆∞. L√™ Ho√†n died in 1005 at the age of 64. Though he had designated his eldest son Long Viet as his successor in 1004, upon his death the remaining sons, each of whom commanded a private army, disputed the succession. Le Long Viet occupied the throne for only a short time before being murdered by thugs sent by his younger brother Long Dinh. Long Dinh then took over the country, but proved himself to be a depraved man and a cruel and despotic ruler. Unpopular with both the people and the high officials who served him, he became the target of plots by seditious groups hoping to bring the country back into the hands of a humane and capable ruler. L√™ Ho√†n's son and successor L√™ Trung T√¥ng neglected to give him a posthumous name in accordance with East Asian royal traditions. (The founders of later Vietnamese dynasties would be called \\"Th√°i T·ªï\\", meaning \\"Great Founder\\") Instead, L√™ Ho√†n received the posthumous name \\"L√™ ƒê·∫°i H√†nh\\" (ÈªéÂ§ßË°å), the interpretation of which is controversial. L√™ ƒê·∫°i H√†nh's dilapidated tomb is located at the foot of M√£ Y√™n (\\"Horse Saddle\\") Mountain in Hoa L∆∞. A temple in his honor stands in Hoa L∆∞ not far from the temple to ƒêinh Ti√™n Ho√†ng.

The paper was driven into bankruptcy by the legal costs of defending its charge that South African Police General Lothar Neethling had supplied poison to security police to kill activists.Sued by Gen. Lothar Neethling It was relaunched in a digital format in April 2019 by the Tiso Blackstar Group, with Max du Preez returning as editor and Jacques Pauw now as co-editor, joined by Anneliese Burgess also as co-editor. History Vrye Weekblad (literally Free Weekly, with \\"free\\" as in expression of opinion) was started as a result of frustration on the part of Afrikaner journalists who thought that the mainstream Afrikaans-language and English- language media lacked the courage to take on the apartheid state in South Africa. The paper was collectively owned by the founder members, who included editor Max du Preez and journalist Jacques Pauw. The editorial staff for the first edition of February 1989 comprised Karien Norval, Du Preez, Elsabe Wessels, Chris du Plessis, Pauw, Victor Munnik, and Koos Coetzee.Editorial staff for the first edition Threat to apartheid state From the outset the state viewed the upstart paper as a threat. The Minister of Justice, Kobie Coetsee, raised the cost of registering the newspaper from R10 to R40,000. As the owners could not pay, the first few editions of Vrye Weekblad appeared on the street illegally, and they were taken to court. In December 1988, former state president P. W. Botha sued Vrye Weekblad for R200,000 for defamation after the newspaper had exposed his links with a Mafia gangster. The case was dropped when Botha suffered a stroke early in 1989. Later that year, seven charges under state of emergency legislation were levied against Vrye Weekblad for advertising a meeting of a banned organisation. On 17 November 1989 it published extensive confessions of Dirk Coetzee, a former commander of the Police Death Squad at Vlakplaas. The story was published worldwide but none of the mainstream South African media covered it. In May 1990, the newspaper revealed the inner secrets of the Civil Cooperation Bureau (CCB) and described how Pieter Botes, a CCB commander, tried to kill anti-apartheid activist Albie Sachs in Maputo in 1988, and tried to undermine SWAPO in the run-up to the November 1989 elections in Namibia. In 1991, a powerful bomb wrecked the offices of Vrye Weekblad. A CCB operative, Leonard Veenendal, later confessed to having planted the bomb. In 1991 Judge Johann Kriegler ruled in favour of Vrye Weekblad in the Rand Supreme Court. But the Appeals Court overturned Kriegler's decision and ordered the paper to pay R90,000 and costs. (The ensuing legal battle cost both sides R2 million over five years and forced the paper to close). The African National Congress (ANC) criticized journalist Jacques Pauw's report in the 17 January 1992 issue that Patrick Lekota had offered money to a right-winger to assassinate Glory \\"September\\" Sidebe. Sidebe was a former ANC member who worked with Vlakplaas death squads, while Lekota was then a member of the ANC's National Executive Committee.ANC displeased over Lekota revelation Just prior to its closure the paper was published out of an old bank building in Newtown, Johannesburg. Vlakplaas revelations Late in 1989, Vrye Weekblad established contact with Captain Dirk Coetzee, the commander in charge of the South African Police's secret elite unit, Section C1, who were stationed at Vlakplaas, a farm southwest of Pretoria. This elite section formed part of President P.W. Botha's so-called \\"Total Strategy\\", and were supposed to disable opponents to Botha's apartheid regime, whenever the country's courts were unable to do so. Section C1's methods included assassination, kidnapping, poisoning and execution. Coetzee also revealed that General Lothar Neethling had supplied poison to the police, which would drug and eventually kill anti-apartheid activists. Well aware that it could have serious consequences for the newspaper, Vrye Weekblad decided not to withdraw Neethling's name from their reports. The newspaper arranged for Coetzee to be safely taken out of South Africa and he eventually found asylum in The Netherlands. On 17 November 1989, the story about Vlakplaas broke on the front page of Vrye Weekblad. The story was also used by other alternative newspapers in South Africa, although the local mainstream media preferred to ignore the story or deny its truthfulness. Across the world, however, the reports of Vlakplaas received widespread coverage. The revelations about Section C1 prompted more revelations from other policemen and army officials about the dirty activities at Vlakplaas and other government institutions. In 1994, Colonel Eugene de Kock (who operated Vlakplaas at the time of the revelations), was given two life-sentences and an additional 212 years in prison, on charges of among other things, murder, attempted murder, culpable homicide, kidnapping, assault and corruption. Following the revelations of the 1989 court case Neethling sued news agencies including Vrye Weekblad for defamation and was represented in court by Barry Roux. The judges of the Bloemfontein Appellate Division declared that both Neethling and Coetzee had probably lied, and it was impossible to determine the truth. Nonetheless, they found that Vrye Weekblad had defamed Neethling, and ordered it to pay him R90,000 plus legal costs. This ultimately led to the bankruptcy and closure of the Vrye Weekblad in February 1994. Breaking news According to Du Preez's submission to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Vrye Weekblad revealed:Max du Preez's submission to the TRC * November 1988: Eugene de Kock is the new commanding officer of the Vlakplaas unit and committed a number of murders, including those of eight people in Piet Retief * December 1989: Siphiwe Mthimkulu was tortured and poisoned by the Eastern Cape security police and was seen in SAP company on 14 April 1982 * January 1990: police tortured prisoners and supported Inkatha vigilantes against United Democratic Front supporters, and murdered activist David Mazwai * February 1990: a professor was an agent of the National Intelligence Service (the revelation led to a fine of R7,000 in terms of the Protection of Information Act) * May 1990: the secret Civil Cooperation Bureau (CCB) was run by the South African Defence Force.

The Mulobezi Railway (once known as the Zambezi Sawmills Railway) was constructed to carry timber from Mulobezi to Livingstone in the Southern Province of Zambia, when the country was Northern Rhodesia. The line uses the narrow gauge, also known as 'Cape gauge', shared by all main line railways in Southern Africa. Zambezi Sawmills The first railway had been built in the country in 1904-5 between Livingstone and Kalomo and was connected to Southern Rhodesia via the Victoria Falls Bridge, opened in 1905. The Zambezi Sawmills company was founded in 1916 to exploit forests of Rhodesian Teak on the north bank of the Zambezi above Livingstone. The timber is hard and strong and termite-resistant and found a ready market as railway sleepers, parquet floors and door and window frames in all parts of Britain's Rhodesian colonies (including what is now Zimbabwe). The timber was dragged to the river by oxen and transported by barge downstream to a point near Livingstone from where it was hauled the few kilometres to the town in wagons running on wooden rails drawn by traction engines modified so that the front wheels ran on the tracks and the large power wheels ran outside them. Construction of the line By the early 1920s the forests near the river were used up. They extended three hundred kilometres north-west and so the railway was constructed into them from 1923 or 1924 onwards using wrought iron rails which had originally been used for the first railway in southern Africa, the 1861 Cape Town-Wellington line.Roger Summers: \\"Some Historic Railway Lines at Livingstone\\", The Northern Rhodesia Journal, Vol 2 No 5 pp78-80 (1954).

According to an early 2012 report, it takes about 2 days for a train to make the 163 km distance from Livingstone to Mulobezi. Due to the track conditions, the speed limit on the line is 15 km an hour. About 200 passengers, as well as some livestock travel on an average train. Despite the low speed, the rail service was still in demand by the local residents, especially during the rainy season, when local roads are impassable.

Since the notion of what it means for a machine to \\"hear\\" is very broad and somewhat vague, computer audition attempts to bring together several disciplines that originally dealt with specific problems or had a concrete application in mind. The engineer Paris Smaragdis, interviewed in Technology Review, talks about these systems --\\"software that uses sound to locate people moving through rooms, monitor machinery for impending breakdowns, or activate traffic cameras to record accidents.\\"Paris Smaragdis taught computers how to play more life- like music Inspired by models of human audition, CA deals with questions of representation, transduction, grouping, use of musical knowledge and general sound semantics for the purpose of performing intelligent operations on audio and music signals by the computer. Technically this requires a combination of methods from the fields of signal processing, auditory modelling, music perception and cognition, pattern recognition, and machine learning, as well as more traditional methods of artificial intelligence for musical knowledge representation.  Applications  Like computer vision versus image processing, computer audition versus audio engineering deals with understanding of audio rather than processing. It also differs from problems of speech understanding by machine since it deals with general audio signals, such as natural sounds and musical recordings. Applications of computer audition are widely varying, and include search for sounds, genre recognition, acoustic monitoring, music transcription, score following, audio texture, music improvisation, emotion in audio and so on.  Related disciplines  Computer Audition overlaps with the following disciplines: * Music Information Retrieval: methods for search and analysis of similarity between music signals. * Auditory Scene Analysis: understanding and description of audio sources and events. * Machine listening: methods for extracting auditory meaningful parameters from audio signals. * Computational musicology and mathematical music theory: use of algorithms that employ musical knowledge for analysis of music data. * Computer music: use of computers in creative musical applications. * Machine musicianship: audition driven interactive music systems.  Areas of study  Since audio signals are interpreted by the human ear-brain system, that complex perceptual mechanism should be simulated somehow in software for \\"machine listening\\". In other words, to perform on par with humans, the computer should hear and understand audio content much as humans do. Analyzing audio accurately involves several fields: electrical engineering (spectrum analysis, filtering, and audio transforms); artificial intelligence (machine learning and sound classification); psychoacoustics (sound perception); cognitive sciences (neuroscience and artificial intelligence);Hendrik Purwins, Perfecto Herrera, Maarten Grachten, Amaury Hazan, Ricard Marxer, and Xavier Serra. Computational models of music perception and cognition I: The perceptual and cognitive processing chain. Physics of Life Reviews, vol. 5, no. 3, pp. 151-168, 2008. acoustics (physics of sound production); and music (harmony, rhythm, and timbre). Furthermore, audio transformations such as pitch shifting, time stretching, and sound object filtering, should be perceptually and musically meaningful. For best results, these transformations require perceptual understanding of spectral models, high-level feature extraction, and sound analysis/synthesis. Finally, structuring and coding the content of an audio file (sound and metadata) could benefit from efficient compression schemes, which discard inaudible information in the sound.Machine Listening Course Webpage at MIT Computational models of music and sound perception and cognition can lead to a more meaningful representation, a more intuitive digital manipulation and generation of sound and music in musical human-machine interfaces. The study of CA could be roughly divided into the following sub-problems: # Representation: signal and symbolic. This aspect deals with time-frequency representations, both in terms of notes and spectral models, including pattern playback and audio texture. # Feature extraction: sound descriptors, segmentation, onset, pitch and envelope detection, chroma, and auditory representations. # Musical knowledge structures: analysis of tonality, rhythm, and harmonies. # Sound similarity: methods for comparison between sounds, sound identification, novelty detection, segmentation, and clustering. # Sequence modeling: matching and alignment between signals and note sequences. # Source separation: methods of grouping of simultaneous sounds, such as multiple pitch detection and time-frequency clustering methods. # Auditory cognition: modeling of emotions, anticipation and familiarity, auditory surprise, and analysis of musical structure. # Multi-modal analysis: finding correspondences between textual, visual, and audio signals.  Representation issues  Computer audition deals with audio signals that can be represented in a variety of fashions, from direct encoding of digital audio in two or more channels to symbolically represented synthesis instructions. Audio signals are usually represented in terms of analogue or digital recordings. Digital recordings are samples of acoustic waveform or parameters of audio compression algorithms. One of the unique properties of musical signals is that they often combine different types of representations, such as graphical scores and sequences of performance actions that are encoded as MIDI files. Since audio signals usually comprise multiple sound sources, then unlike speech signals that can be efficiently described in terms of specific models (such as source- filter model), it is hard to devise a parametric representation for general audio. Parametric audio representations usually use filter banks or sinusoidal models to capture multiple sound parameters, sometimes increasing the representation size in order to capture internal structure in the signal. Additional types of data that are relevant for computer audition are textual descriptions of audio contents, such as annotations, reviews, and visual information in the case of audio-visual recordings.  Features  Description of contents of general audio signals usually requires extraction of features that capture specific aspects of the audio signal. Generally speaking, one could divide the features into signal or mathematical descriptors such as energy, description of spectral shape etc., statistical characterization such as change or novelty detection, special representations that are better adapted to the nature of musical signals or the auditory system, such as logarithmic growth of sensitivity (bandwidth) in frequency or octave invariance (chroma). Since parametric models in audio usually require very many parameters, the features are used to summarize properties of multiple parameters in a more compact or salient representation.  Musical knowledge  Finding specific musical structures is possible by using musical knowledge as well as supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. Examples of this include detection of tonality according to distribution of frequencies that correspond to patterns of occurrence of notes in musical scales, distribution of note onset times for detection of beat structure, distribution of energies in different frequencies to detect musical chords and so on.  Sound similarity and sequence modeling  Comparison of sounds can be done by comparison of features with or without reference to time. In some cases an overall similarity can be assessed by close values of features between two sounds. In other cases when temporal structure is important, methods of dynamic time warping need to be applied to \\"correct\\" for different temporal scales of acoustic events. Finding repetitions and similar sub- sequences of sonic events is important for tasks such as texture synthesis and machine improvisation.  Source separation  Since one of the basic characteristics of general audio is that it comprises multiple simultaneously sounding sources, such as multiple musical instruments, people talking, machine noises or animal vocalization, the ability to identify and separate individual sources is very desirable. Unfortunately, there are no methods that can solve this problem in a robust fashion. Existing methods of source separation rely sometimes on correlation between different audio channels in multi-channel recordings. The ability to separate sources from stereo signals requires different techniques than those usually applied in communications where multiple sensors are available. Other source separation methods rely on training or clustering of features in mono recording, such as tracking harmonically related partials for multiple pitch detection.  Auditory cognition  Listening to music and general audio is commonly not a task directed activity. People enjoy music for various poorly understood reasons, which are commonly referred to the emotional effect of music due to creation of expectations and their realization or violation. Animals attend to signs of danger in sounds, which could be either specific or general notions of surprising and unexpected change. Generally, this creates a situation where computer audition can not rely solely on detection of specific features or sound properties and has to come up with general methods of adapting to changing auditory environment and monitoring its structure. This consists of analysis of larger repetition and self-similarity structures in audio to detect innovation, as well as ability to predict local feature dynamics.  Multi-modal analysis  Among the available data for describing music, there are textual representations, such as liner notes, reviews and criticisms that describe the audio contents in words. In other cases human reactions such as emotional judgements or psycho-physiological measurements might provide an insight into the contents and structure of audio. Computer Audition tries to find relation between these different representations in order to provide this additional understanding of the audio contents.

Life He was born in Cologne and was the son of the German composer, pianist and teacher Eduard Franck. His father, who had studied with Felix Mendelssohn and knew the value of good instruction, sent Richard to the Leipzig Conservatory, where he studied with two of the leading teachers of the day, Carl Reinecke and Salomon Jadassohn. During the course of a long career, Franck held teaching positions at conservatories in both Germany (Kassel, Berlin, Heidelberg) and in Switzerland (Basle). Although he did not reach the front rank amongst his contemporaries, he was nevertheless well respected as a concert artist and as a composer. His conservative style was influenced by Reinecke and by his friend, the Swiss composer Hans Huber (1852‚Äì1921). Franck was firmly in the tradition of Mendelssohn and Schumann though it's clear that he was not immune from the influence of Wagner, Grieg and Reger also. Critics who were familiar with his compositions and his piano playing regularly lavished praised upon them. For example, the Schweizerische Musikzeitung (Swiss Musical Journal), writing about his First Piano Trio, Op. 20, wrote: > \\"Powerful and full-sounding energy is shown in many works, not least in > [Richard Franck's] Op.20 Piano Trio, which is a magnificent, significant > composition, fresh in invention, firm and secure in its development, and > mature in its expression.\\" The bulk of Franck's compositions are for solo piano; however, he also wrote orchestral and vocal compositions, as well as a considerable amount of chamber music. Though he and his music have been long forgotten, as of late, his music has been rediscovered and is in the process of being revived. His piano trios, piano quartets and four sonatas have all been recently recorded on Audite, a selection of orchestra works on Sterling. Early in 2007, Edition Silvertrust republished the parts to his Op. 20 Piano Trio, the first in a series of chamber works to be released. Within the next years, all available works of Richard Franck will be published in critical editions by Pfefferkorn Music Publishers, Leipzig.

The Government of Rajasthan signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Indian Air Force for the expansion of the civil enclave in March 2017, wherein 37 acres of IAF land would be transferred to AAI. It is 44th busiest airport in India, handling more than half a million passengers in the year 2018 - 2019. History The Jodhpur Flying Club was set up by Maharaja Umaid Singh in the 1920s at a small airfield near his Chittar Palace ( Umaid Bhavan Palace ) in Jodhpur. Through the next 3 decades, the airfield grew in stature, being used as an airfield for the Royal Air Force (RAF) during World War II. The airfield was later upgraded in 1950 after the formation of the Royal Indian Air Force (that later became the Indian Air Force). Jodhpur was home to the IAF's Air Force Flying College until the 1965 war. Structure Jodhpur airport's 12-acre civil enclave contains a terminal building measuring a built-up area of 5690 m2, that is capable of handling 430 passengers per hour. The terminal has 7 check-in counters and 3 boarding gates.

Rainbow Body is one of Theofanidis's most-performed compositions and won the 2003 London Masterprize competition. Composition Rainbow Body has a duration of roughly 13 minutes and is composed in a single movement. The melody of the piece is loosely based on \\"Ave Maria, o auctrix vite\\" by the 12th-century composer Hildegard of Bingen. The composition was also inspired by the Tibetan Buddhist idea of rainbow body (from which the piece takes its title), wherein the body of an enlightened being is absorbed back into the universe upon his/her death. Reception Rainbow Body has been praised by music critics. Andrew Druckenbrod of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette opined, \\"Under its attractive shimmering surface, it has depth and sophistication.\\" Andrew Farach-Colton of Gramophone also lauded the piece, writing: Bernard Holland of The New York Times gave the piece a mixed response, however, noting that it \\"sounded suspiciously like bait: a user-friendly feel-good piece bearing the imprimatur of modernity and beckoning to listeners skittish of the new.

Though largely unsuccessful in attaining its goals of better working conditions and wages, the strike was considered very successful in a lasting way; it caused an immense controversy which gave the labor movement momentum, propelling the movement in its national development.  Background  Located in the south- western piedmont of North Carolina, Gaston County had the ideal resources for manufacturing. Because of the large potential workforce of former sharecroppers and failed farmers,Salmond, John A. Gastonia 1929: The Story of the Loray Mill Strike, (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1995), p. xi many northern industrialists moved south in search of a reduced cost of labor.Yellen, Samuel. American Labor Struggles, (New York: Harbor Press, 1936), p. 292 World War I brought great prosperity to the southern cotton mills, \\"fueled largely by government defense orders for uniforms, tents, and war material. Thousands of new jobs opened in the mills, and wages soared to all time highs.\\"Huber,Patrick. \\"Mill Mother's Lament: Ella May Wiggins and the Gastonia Textile Strike of 1929.\\" Southern Cultures. (2009): 83. Web. 4 Oct. 2011. This boom was to be short-lived, however, and the prosperity that the workers enjoyed soon disappeared. The luxury items they had purchased on credit were now stretching their budgets so much that they could hardly afford to put food on the table. Managers introduced the \\"stretch-out\\" system in which spinners and weavers not only doubled their work, but also reduced their wages. \\"I used to tend forty-eight looms,\\" complained a South Carolina weaver in 1929, \\"while under the stretch-out I have to tend ninety looms and I couldn't do it. Three years ago I was makin' over $19 a week. Now I make $17.70.\\" \\"By the late 1920s some mill workers' wages sank as low as $5 a week.\\"Huber, 84 The owners of the mills insisted on keeping prices down, which caused mill work to become extremely dangerous and dirty. Often the workdays were so long that the women, who made up a considerable percentage of the workers, were rarely home to raise their children. Upon hearing about the conditions in the Loray Mill, Fred Erwin Beal of the National Textile Workers Union (NTWU), a communist labor union, as well as a member of the Trade Union Unity League, began focusing his attention on the small town of Gastonia.Salmond, 18-22 Strike alt= On Saturday, March 30, 1929, the union held its first public meeting in Gastonia. Ellen Dawson, co-director of the strike and vice president of the NTWU, urged workers to stand resolute. The \\"seemingly frail\\" woman was in fact a \\"tough, experienced organizer and superb stump speaker.\\"Salmond, 20 At 3 pm, Beal took a vote and the workers voted unanimously to strike. On April 1, 1929 1,800 mill workers from the Loray Mill walked off their jobs to protest intolerable working conditions. The strikers demanded a forty-hour workweek, a minimum $20 weekly wage, union recognition, and the abolition of the stretch-out system.Huber, 87 In response, management evicted families from mill-owned homes. In an effort to retain order, Mayor Rankin asked Governor O. Max Gardner for assistance. He immediately sent 250 National Guard troops who arrived on April 3.Salmond, p. 24. The strike escalated throughout the month. Nearly 100 masked men destroyed the NTWU's headquarters on April 18,Yellen, p. 304. As a result, the NTWU started a tent city on the outskirts of town that was protected by armed strikers at all times. The situation continued throughout the next few months as the workers continued to strike despite the return to production at the Loray Mill, making their situation appear hopeless.Yellen, p. 308. On June 7, 150 workers marched to the mill to call out the night shift. They were attacked and dispersed by sheriff's deputies. Later that night, four officers including Police Chief Aderholt arrived at the tent city and demanded that the guards hand over their weapons. An altercation ensued and Chief Aderholt was killed. Two of his officers and several strikers were wounded.Christensen, Rob. The Paradox of Tar Heel Politics (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 2008), p. 72 Trial An upright In the aftermath, 71 strikers were arrested. Eight strikers and another eight members of the NTWU, including Beal and Clarence Miller, were indicted for the murder of Sheriff Alderholt. During the trial, a juror went insane after seeing some disturbing evidence. As a result, the judge was forced to declare a mistrial. When news of the mistrial was released, a general wave of terror ran through the countryside, with the anti-strike \\"Committee of One Hundred\\" prominent in the vigilante activity.Chuck McShane, \\"The Loray Mill Strike in Gastonia: Demands for Higher Pay and a 40-hour Workweek Ignite a Furor in Gastonia in 1929,\\" OurState.com The defense team included: Arthur Garfield Hays, who had worked briefly in the Sacco and Vanzetti case, Dr. John Randolph Neal of the Scopes Trial defense, and Leon Josephson of International Labor Defense, the legal arm of the Communist Party of the USA. During the early part of September, mobs of men gathered up strikers and ran them out of the county.Yellen, p. 312. These actions came to a head when, on September 14, a truck containing 22 strikers was chased down and fired upon. One female striker, Ella Mae Wiggins, was killed. In a retrial in the Alderholt case, seven men were charged with his murder, six of whom were Loray Mill employees. All were found guilty of second degree murder and sentenced to lengthy terms of imprisonment by Judge M.V. Barnhill.\\"Gastonia Strikers Get Long Terms,\\" Salem Statesman-Journal, Nov. 5, 1929, pg. 3. Aftermath Beal and Miller were released on bail and fled to the Soviet Union to avoid their prison sentences. (On their ship were American Communist writer Myra Page and her husband John Markey.) Disillusioned by his life in the USSR, Beal subsequently returned to the United States and surrendered to the authorities in North Carolina. He was later pardoned.Christensen, p. 72 Ella May Wiggins Ella May Wiggins (also known as Ella Mae Wiggins) was a single mother of nine, four of whom died of whooping cough due to inadequate medical care. Rather than renting a mill- owned house in the mill town, she chose to live in a wooden shack in an African-American hamlet called \\"Stump Town\\"Huber, 85 where her children were cared for by a local African-American woman. Seeing the union as the best hope for her children, Wiggins became a key leader of the strike, and was very successful in rallying the workers through her songs. Some of her better known works are \\"Mill Mother's Lament\\", recorded by Pete Seeger, \\"Chief Aderholt\\", and \\"The Big Fat Boss and the Workers\\".Huber, 97,98 Woody Guthrie referred to her as \\"the pioneer of the protest ballad\\". Wiggins went to Washington D.C. and spoke with senators in the hallways, trying to impress upon them the dire the working conditions of the Southern mills. On September 14, 1929, following her return to North Carolina, a pregnant Ella May Wiggins was shot in the chest as she rode in the back of a pick-up truck with her brother, Wes, and 2 other men ‚Äî all headed to a union meeting in Gastonia. Two car loads of armed men pulled the truck over on the bridge leaving Bessemer City for Gastonia. The strike collapsed shortly after her murder.Huber, pg. 102 Impact The Loray Mill in 2013 Overall the strike was not a success, but during the same time period there was a series of other textile strikes throughout the South. The main objective of these strikes was the abolition of the stretch-out, and some met with a measure of success.Yellen, 304 The success was difficult to come by, though, as strikers were branded by the press as \\"radicals,\\" and labor organizers as \\"foreign agitators.\\" \\"Wherever a strike broke out, state troops were immediately sent and to this show of force were added police, deputy sheriffs, and . . . vigilantes.\\"Yellen, 322 Over time, this spontaneous uprising of textile workers in the South allowed for the formation of the United Textile Workers, the \\"first significant breach in southern anti- unionism.\\"Yellen, 326 Gastonia novels Because of the violent and dramatic events surrounding the mill strikes in Gastonia, North Carolina, the labor struggle became a symbol of \\"the strength, courage, and tenacity\\"Cella, Laurie. \\"Radical Romance in the Piedmont:Olive Tilford Dargan's Gastonia Novels.\\" The Southern Literary Journal. 39.2 (2007). 37.

These are commonly referred to as the Gastonia novels: *Anderson, Sherwood: Beyond Desire *Dargan, Olive Tilford: Call Home the Heart *Lumpkin, Grace: To Make My Bread *Myra Page: Gathering Storm *Rollins Jr., William: The Shadow Before *Vorse, Mary Heaton: Strike! \\"In each of the novels, Gastonia is given as the focus of the universal class struggle, as a set of real events operating within the context of Marxist ideology. . . .

Later (March 23, 1982), the Mylord Department Store opened within the station building and the first two automatic ticket machines were installed. From February 1, 1984 the Asagiri Romancecar service began stopping at Hon-Atsugi and on October 15, 1984, the Atsugi Bus Centre was completed.

It is situated at Ujlaiwadi, 9 km South-East from Kolhapur city. It is operated by the Airports Authority of India (AAI). The AAI is expanding the airport at a cost of Rs 274 Crore.  Future developments  Kolhapur airport was set for a major upgrade, making it capable of handling Boeing 737 aircraft. The upgrade involved increasing runway length to 2300 metres and expanding its apron and related equipment. MIDC was to acquire 223 hectares of adjoining land from local farmers in five villages at the cost of Rs 80 crore for this purpose.[5] The AAI is considering the installation of night landing facilities at the airport and is preparing a plan to use the airport for overnight parking of aircraft to reduce congestion at the Mumbai and Pune airports. Kolhapur: The city airport has been facilitated with the aviation fuel facility, which means that the aircraft landing here will have the facility to refuel while on halt. The facility, according to experts, will help in carrying more passenger load, which eventually will help both the airlines as well as the passengers. Kamal Kumar Kataria, airport director, Kolhapur, told TOI that the facility started from May 12, and is being provided by the Hindustan Petroleum, a public-sector oil and natural gas company. The facility will henceforth remain available on a permanent basis. When asked about how it could impact the current aviation scene over the city skies, Kataria said that earlier when the aircraft arriving to the Kolhapur airport had to made sure they carry the reserve fuel to depart to their next destination, the limited availability of the fuel can restrict the number of passengers on board a plane. However, that would not be the case any more. With the availability of aviation fuel, the number of passengers will increase. Notably, from May 12, Indigo airlines started its operations to-and-fro the city to Tirupati, which is receiving an overwhelming response. At present, the Kolhapur airport hosts daily to-and-fro flights for Tirupati, Hyderabad and Bengaluru, carrying over 8,000 passengers since December 9 last year. The Kolhapur airport is located at the Ujalaiwadi neighbourhood, which is around 9km from the main city. While one low-budget domestic airline had started its operations earlier last year, more airlines are likely to join the services in the future. The operations of Kolhapur airport resumed from December 9, 2018, with Air Alliance, a subsidiary of Air India, operating on Hyderabad and Bengaluru routes. History In January 1939, Air Services of India, a private airline based out of Juhu Aerodrome, (which was Mumbai's airport at that time) began air services to the princely state of Kolhapur. The service was officially inaugurated by the Maharaja of Kolhapur, Chhatrapati Rajaram Maharaj, who had shown considerable interest in the project and offered a subsidy to the company, apart from arranging for the necessary aerodrome facilities in his capital. The present Kolhapur Airport began operations in the year 1987 and was leased by the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) from Airports Authority of India (AAI) on 16 April 1997. The lease expired in February 2012 and the MIDC requested the State government in May 2012 to be relieved of the responsibility of managing the airport. The Maharashtra Government then handed over the airport to the AAI in August 2013. The airport was closed for repairs by order of the DGCA on June 16, 2010 after the runway surface was found to be unsafe in the monsoons. Due to the closure, flights into Kolhapur were temporarily suspended. DGCA gave its approval for re- opening of the airport in April 2011 after MIDC repaired the 1,370 metre long and 50 metre wide runway. MIDC also added facilities like closed circuit television system, baggage scanner, door-frame and hand-held metal detectors and guide lights along the airstrip at a total cost of Rs 6 crore. Kingfisher Airlines resumed commercial flights on 10 June 2011. The service to Mumbai was suspended in November 2011 when the airline pulled out of several towns citing financial losses. After a closure of six years, scheduled commercial operations at the airport resumed in April 2018 with Air Deccan launching its first flight to Mumbai under the UDAN scheme. In March 2018, the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly passed a resolution recommending the Central government to rename the airport as ‚ÄòChhatrapati Rajaram Maharaj Airport' after the member of the erstwhile royal family of Kolhapur. First Airport Director (Kamal Kumar Kataria) appointed on 13 December 2018 by Airports Authority of India. For Kolhapur Airport development. The foundation stone for a new terminal building and ATC Tower was laid by Union Civil Aviation Minister Suresh Prabhu on 2 February 2019. The new terminal complex is being built at a cost of Rupees 275 Crore and will cover an area of 3900 square metres. It will have 10 Check-in counters, and a peak hour handling capacity of 300 passengers.

Its membership includes 22 communities, 16 of them traditional kibbutzim, and 6 others in the category of Moshav shitufi, meaning that they have no communal dining hall or children's house but maintain a shared economy. The Religious Kibbutz Movement has about 15,000 members. It is not part of the secular Kibbutz Movement with its c. 230 kibbutzim, and it does not include the two Poalei Agudat Yisrael-affiliated religious kibbutzim. History The Religious Kibbutz Movement was founded in 1935 by groups of Jewish pioneers who immigrated to Palestine from Europe.\\"Settlement clustering on a socio-cultural basis: The bloc settlement policy of the Religious Kibbutz Movement in Palestine,\\" Yossi Katz, Journal of Rural Studies, vol. 11, no. 2, pp.161-171, 1995 It was the fourth kibbutz movement established in Palestine, after Hever Hakvutzot, HaKibbutz HaMeuhad and Hashomer Hatzair. From the outset, the policy of this movement was settlement in clusters, due to the need for religious schooling.\\"Settlement clustering on a socio-cultural basis: The bloc settlement policy of the Religious Kibbutz Movement in Palestine,\\" Yossi Katz, Journal of Rural Studies, vol. 11, no. 2, pp.161-171, 1995 Another consideration was the desire to counteract the influences of a secular environment: A single religious kibbutz in a non-religious environment would find it difficult to defend its religious and social principles. Bloc settlement also created the possibility for mutual assistance, with veteran settlements sharing their experience with those that came later.\\"Settlement clustering on a socio-cultural basis: The bloc settlement policy of the Religious Kibbutz Movement in Palestine,\\" Yossi Katz, Journal of Rural Studies, vol. 11, no. 2, pp.161-171, 1995 Settlement blocs In 1937-1948, the Religious Kibbutz Movement established three settlement blocs of three kibbutzim each. The first was in the Beit Shean Valley, the second was in the Hebron mountains south of Bethlehem (known as Gush Etzion), and the third was in the western Negev. Another kibbutz, Yavne, was founded in the center of the country as the core of a fourth bloc which only came into being after the establishment of the state.\\"Settlement clustering on a socio-cultural basis: The bloc settlement policy of the Religious Kibbutz Movement in Palestine,\\" Yossi Katz, Journal of Rural Studies, vol. 11, no. 2, pp.161-171, 1995 Current trends Many kibbutzim of the Religious Kibbutz Movement are in the midst of privatization, similar to the trend in non-religious kibbutzim. The movement operates a number of educational institutions, including Yeshivat Ein Tzurim, Yeshivat Ma'ale Gilboa, Ein HaNatziv Women's Seminary, the Yaacov Herzog Institute for Jewish Studies, a school for post-military Jewish studies for women on Massuot Yitzhak, and a Field School at Kfar Etzion.

Obscure and mysterious places in the midst of forests are an abundant source of energetic sounds. Desert ‚Äì although life withers on the arid soil, great civilizations have made the desert their home for thousands of years. The silence of the desert sharpens mind and ears of its inhabitants and creates strong and colorful music.

A direct descendant of the eighteenth-century composer Franz Benda, he operated in the shadow of better- known Teutonic maestri of his generation, notably Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler, Otto Klemperer, and Hans Knappertsbusch. After serving as musical director of Berlin Radio from 1926 to 1934, Benda became (1935) artistic director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, during Furtw√§ngler's tenure as chief conductor. He held this post until 1939. Meanwhile, he conducted the Berlin Chamber Orchestra, which he had founded in 1932, and with which he toured Australia, South America and Asia as well as Europe. He was married to Karin Rosander, a Finnish violinist. Unlike Furtw√§ngler and Knappertsbusch (or Klemperer, who had fled Germany shortly after Hitler gained power), Benda joined the Nazi Party , possibly through fear that the regime would regard his Czech lineage as insufficiently Aryan. That his party card brought a certain amount of foreign obloquy on his head is indicated by the fact that (according to John L. Holmes' Conductors on Record) a pre-war recording Benda conducted of music by Gluck was issued in America without his name on the label. After World War II, Benda gave evidence during Furtw√§ngler's denazification proceedings, avowing that Furtw√§ngler had protected Jews from official persecution. Having worked in Spain from 1948 to 1952, Benda was subsequently employed at Radio Free Berlin (1954-1958). Benda had a long recording career, lasting from the 1930s until 1968. Composers in his large discography include Bach, Vivaldi, Handel, Haydn, Mozart p√®re and fils, Schubert, Dvo≈ô√°k, Respighi, C. P. E. Bach, Frederick the Great, Johann Adolf Hasse, Johann Joachim Quantz, Carl Heinrich Graun, and his own collateral ancestor Georg Benda. His conducting on disc tended towards a hefty, straightforward style wholly at odds with Furtw√§ngler's and Knappertsbusch's improvisational unpredictability.  Further reading  *John L.

It was the predecessor to their best-known album In the Land of Grey and Pink (1971). The album is representative of the Canterbury scene genre featuring representative organ solos and melodic vocals typical of the band's style. The album was released on Decca Records, as was the title track as a single release. Background Caravan had released their debut album, Caravan in 1968, achieving some live success and had appeared on UK and German television in early 1969. Unfortunately, their label, Verve Records shut down their British operations and dropped the band. Guitarist Pye Hastings later recalled \\"that situation really left us in limbo\\". The band regrouped and continued performing live, eventually finding a manager Terry King. David Hitchcock, an employee of Decca Records' art department, saw the band perform at the London Lyceum and recommend that his boss, Hugh Mendl sign them. Sessions for the album started at Tangerine Studios on Balls Pond Road, Dalston, London in September 1969, with the band self-producing and Robin Sylvester engineering. Hastings recalled this caused problems, as every member of the band wanted their instrument to be louder than the others. The band recorded a few tracks, but these were abandoned while the band went out on tour, having become popular on the university circuit in Britain and Europe. They eventually regrouped in February the following year and recorded the songs on the album mostly live onto 8-track tape. The highlight of the sessions was a fourteen- minute jazz-rock piece assembled from various sections contributed by the band, called \\"For Richard\\". Keyboardist David Sinclair composed the basic structure, while bassist Richard Sinclair wrote the main tune. Hastings invited his brother Jimmy to guest on saxophone and flute, which would become a regular feature of Caravan's studio work. The album title and title of the title track is a quote often attributed to Spike Milligan but equally possibly deriving from a bootlegged Bob Dylan song \\"All Over You\\" (\\"Well, if I had to do it all over again/Babe, I‚Äôd do it all over you\\"), later released on The Bootleg Series, Vol 9: The Witmark Demos: 1962-1964. The cover was shot in Holland Park, London and was photographed by David Jupe. Release and reception \\"Hello Hello\\", backed with the title track, was released as a single in August 1970, which led to an appearance on the BBC's Top of the Pops. The album was released the following month in the UK, and in March 1971 in the US. According to AllMusic, \\"If I Could Do It All Over Again contains significant progressions over the first album.\\" \\"For Richard\\" became a staple of live Caravan shows and was typically heard as the set closer. A fully orchestrated, live version can be heard on the 1974 release Caravan and the New Symphonia. The CD was remastered in 2001, with the addition of bonus tracks, including the abandoned September 1969 sessions, and the out-take \\"A Day in the Life of Maurice Haylett\\", written about the band's road manager.

Anthony Venn- Brown OAM (born 13 March 1951) is a former Australian evangelist in the Assemblies of God now (Australian Christian Churches) and an author whose book, A Life of Unlearning describes his experience in Australia‚Äôs first ex- gay program. \\" A life of Unlearning\\" accessed 6 September 2012 He is also the Co-founder and previous Convenor of Freedom 2b which is a network for GLBTIQ (Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex and Queer) people from Evangelical backgrounds.ABC Radio National:religious faith and sexuality\\", 10 March 2011 accessed 8 April 2012 He is also the founder and CEO of Ambassadors & Bridge Builders International (ABBI).  Early life  Anthony Venn-Brown was born in 1951 and raised in a family with a strong Anglican Church background (Anglo-Catholic). His family were committed to church life during his early years but as a teenager Anthony felt that the rituals, language and beliefs were irrelevant not only to him but also the generation of the 60‚Äôs and he ceased all involvement in the church. It was also at this time the awareness of his homosexuality increased. Australian society in the 60‚Äôs viewed homosexuality as a mental illness/perversion and it was a criminal offence. This led to deep depression and a suicide attempt. Anthony Venn-Brown eventually made contact with evangelical Anglicans in the Sydney Diocese in his quest to be \\"normal\\" and acceptable to his family and friends and was converted in 1969. After his conversion in 1969, Anthony continued to be involved in evangelism and was baptised in a Baptist church. Many times he felt that God had answered his prayer and that he had been set free of his attraction to the same sex. However, although these moments were spiritually exhilarating they did not have a lasting impact on his life. Believing that ‚Äòmore faith and more power‚Äô was needed to overcome his ‚Äòproblem‚Äô, Anthony began to explore his Christianity in the Charismatic renewal, which had just commenced in Sydney, and also traditional Pentecostal contexts. In 1971, after feeling a strong call to ministry, Anthony attended Faith Bible College, a pastoral and missionary training centre in New Zealand. After confessing to the leadership of the college that he still struggled with homosexuality, he underwent several weeks of exorcisms through the ministry of Pastor Neville Johnson at Queen Street Assemblies of God in Auckland. However, on returning to Australia, Anthony was still troubled by his sexuality, and believing that he could never serve God until this part of his life was overcome, he signed himself into a ‚Äòlive-in‚Äô ex-gay program for six months at Moombara and Bundeena Christian Fellowship (a rehabilitation centre that claimed success for drug addicts, prostitutes and homosexuals). Anthony then moved to Orange, New South Wales in 1972 and began youth work for the local Assemblies of God Church and was married in 1974.  Early ministry  Venn-Brown pioneered several Assemblies of God churches in regional NSW including Port Macquarie, Gunnedah, Wauchope and Laurieton before moving to Sydney with his family in the early 1980s and founding \\"Every Believer Evangelism.\\" Venn-Brown became a popular preacher at all the major churches of the Assemblies of God in Australia including Hillsong Church's predecessor Christian Life Centre and also preached overseas. In 1990 he became the first Pentecostal to be appointed to the Lausanne Committee for World Evangelism in Australia.  Youth Alive  The Assemblies of God asked Venn-Brown to start a new youth work to replace the NSW Assemblies of God current youth organisation which was called Christ's ambassadors and start some large scale youth events. The first Youth Alive event was a concert held in the beachside suburb of Manly, New South Wales on 23 February 1985. Some more conservative members of the Assemblies of God opposed the event because of the use of Christian rock music and walked out. However, Youth Alive became a very successful youth organisation and eventually grew to events of over 20 000 people. Venn-Brown eventually handed over the ministry to his assistant Pat Mesiti as he wanted to concentrate on developing \\"Every Believer Evangelism\\".Venn-Brown, A. (2007) A Life of unlearning: a journey to find the truth. Coming out Venn-Brown resigned as a minister in 1991 after coming out as a gay man. In 2004 he published his autobiography, A Life of Unlearning - Coming out of the church, One Man's Struggle.The book detailed his struggle to reconcile his homosexuality with his Christian beliefs. It won the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Business Association Literary award in 2004. The revised edition, A Life of Unlearning - a Journey to Find the Truth was published in 2007. Anthony doesn't feel he will return to preaching, saying \\"30 years down the track someone who is gay or lesbian will be allowed to minister. I hope I'm there to see it, but I feel I've had my ministry. When I came back to God I felt like I had the essence of what it was all about. What I have now is real. I have learned to live non-judgementally, to live with integrity and I didn't have that as a preacher.\\"\\"Anthony Venn Brown ‚Äì Mr Charismatic Gay Australia\\", 15 February 2007 accessed 9 April 2012 Anthony Venn-Brown was one of the keynote speakers at the 2009 \\"Evangelical Network Conference\\" in Arizona. Dialogue between the church and the LGBT community Preferring to be known as a gay ambassador instead of gay activist, Venn-Brown is now a representative and advocate of gay and lesbian people. He seeks to create an informed, intelligent yet respectful dialogue about the issues of same sex orientation within the Christian and particularly Pentecostal community. One of the models that he has developed is \\"Creating a Space for Change\\" . This is a non confrontational way of changing stereotypes and preconceived ideas . One of the first people to be involved in this dialogue was Pastor Mike Hercock, a Baptist minister who was leading a church in Darlinghurst, Sydney . A friendship developed and Anthony relayed the many stories of tragedy and loss experienced by gay and lesbian people who had been rejected by the church. Anthony introduced Mike to the work of Freedom 2b. He was deeply touched by the stories of those he met. In 2007, Freedom 2b marched for the first time in the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras parade. Seeing the profound impact this had on those who had lived for so many years in shame, guilt and fear, Pastor Hercock stated that the following year he would encourage 100 Evangelical ministers to sign an apology to the LGBT community for the way the church had mistreated them and march in the 2008 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. This movement became known as the 100 Revs and led to the following statement. \\"As ministers of various churches and denominations we recognise that the churches we belong to, and the church in general, have not been places of welcome for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (GLBT) people. Indeed the church has often been profoundly unloving toward the GLBT community. For these things we apologise, whatever the distinctive of our Christian position on human sexuality ‚Äì to which we remain committed. We are deeply sorry and ask for the forgiveness of the GLBT community. We long that the church would be a place of welcome for all people and commit ourselves to pursuing this goal.\\" In 2007 Anthony co-ordinated the release of a statement from five Australian ex-gay leaders who publicly apologized for their past actions.\\"Apology from Former ex gay leaders \\", 16 August 2007, accessed 9 April 2012 In 2010 Anthony was invited to lecture on \\"An Alternative Approach to Sexual Orientation, Gender Diversity and the Christian Faith\\" at Tabor College in Melbourne (one of Australia‚Äôs leading bible colleges).

Childhood Collier was born on June 26, 1948 in Dallas, Texas to parents Carroll Lloyd Collier and Mildred Louise Ferguson, and was the oldest of six children (three brothers, two sisters). He attended and graduated school in Dallas, and according to his father (an artist himself), \\"...demonstrated great talent...as an artist...\\" During his time in college at North Texas, John originally planned to study philosophy or engineering. The academic curriculum allowed him to attend only two art courses per semester, but the limitations did not suit Collier. He has said, \\"I had other ideas...I had a figure drawing class in the morning; then, stayed in the studio drawing all day. I failed all my other classes, got an A in drawing, and learned what I wanted to learn.\\" Career From a selected group of more than thirty artists, John Collier was chosen as one of the sculptors for the Catholic Memorial at Ground Zero. His four sculptures, representing the patron saints of police officers, firefighters, and workers, along with St. Mary Magdalene, first witness to the Resurrection, along with the chapel design team and the other chosen artists received the prestigious Optim√© Award and were dedicated by Cardinal Egan in May 2005 in memory of those who died on 9/11/01 and of those who took part in the rescue effort. The works are permanently installed at St. Joseph‚Äôs Chapel, adjacent to Ground Zero in New York. Mr. Collier‚Äôs work has been exhibited at the Westmoreland Museum of American Art, the Mulvane Museum, the Narthex Gallery at Saint Peter‚Äôs Church in New York City and at Tatischeff Gallery in New York, the New York Historical Society Museum, Christie's Auction House, and the Smithsonian Institution‚Äôs Traveling Art Exhibition, the Museum of Biblical Art (Dallas), as well as many churches and religious institutions. Mr. Collier is one of America's most honored Artists. His ‚ÄúSt. Mary Magdalene‚Äù won the 2006 Design Award from Faith & Form and IFRAA, the Interfaith Forum on Religion, Art and Architecture, a division of the American Institute of Architects (AIA). John won the same award in 2004 and 2003 for his ‚ÄúCrucifix‚Äù and for ‚ÄúMary at the Wedding at Cana,‚Äù which was also awarded the 2004 Best-of-Show honor from Ministry & Liturgy. He has received over twenty Gold and Silver medals from the Society of Illustrators in New York, and he has received numerous awards from arts institutions of higher learning.

Franz Reuleaux introduced the kinematic pair as a new approach to the study of machinesReuleaux, F., 1876 The Kinematics of Machinery, (trans. and annotated by A. B. W. Kennedy), reprinted by Dover, New York (1963) that provided an advance over the motion of elements consisting of simple machines.A. P. Usher, 1929, A History of Mechanical Inventions, Harvard University Press, (reprinted by Dover Publications 1968).  Description  Kinematics is the branch of classical mechanics which describes the motion of points, bodies (objects) and systems of bodies (groups of objects) without consideration of the causes of motion. Kinematics as a field of study is often referred to as the \\"geometry of motion\\". For further detail, see Kinematics. Hartenberg & DenavitR. S. Hartenberg and J. Denavit (1964) Kinematic synthesis of linkages, pp 17-18, New York: McGraw-Hill. presents the definition of a kinematic pair: > In the matter of connections between rigid bodies, Reuleaux recognized two > kinds; he called them higher and lower pairs (of elements). With higher > pairs, the two elements are in contact at a point or along a line, as in a > ball bearing or disk cam and follower; the relative motions of coincident > points are dissimilar. Lower pairs are those for which area contact may be > visualized, as in pin connections, crossheads, ball-and socket joints and > some others; the relative motion of coincident points of the elements, and > hence of their links, are similar, and an exchange of elements from one link > to the other does not alter the relative motion of the parts as it would > with higher pairs.  Lower pair  A lower pair is an ideal joint that constrains contact between a surface in the moving body to a corresponding surface in the fixed body. A lower pair is one in which there occurs a surface or area contact between two members, e.g. nut and screw, universal joint used to connect two propeller shafts. Cases of lower joints: * A revolute pair, or hinged joint, requires a line in the moving body to remain co-linear with a line in the fixed body, and a plane perpendicular to this line in the moving body maintain contact with a similar perpendicular plane in the fixed body. This imposes five constraints on the relative movement of the links, which therefore has one degree of freedom. * A prismatic joint, or slider, requires that a line in the moving body remain co-linear with a line in the fixed body, and a plane parallel to this line in the moving body maintain contact with a similar parallel plane in the fixed body. This imposes five constraints on the relative movement of the links, which therefore has one degree of freedom. * A screw pair requires cut threads in two links, so that there is a turning as well as sliding motion between them. This joint has one degree of freedom. * A cylindrical joint requires that a line in the moving body remain co-linear with a line in the fixed body. It is a combination of a revolute joint and a sliding joint. This joint has two degrees of freedom. * A spherical joint or ball and socket joint requires that a point in the moving body remain stationary in the fixed body. This joint has three degrees of freedom, corresponding to rotations around orthogonal axes. * A planar joint requires that a plane in the moving body maintain contact with a plane in fixed body. This joint has three degrees of freedom. The moving plane can slide in two dimensions along the fixed plane, and it can rotate on an axis normal to the fixed plane.  Higher pairs  Generally, a higher pair is a constraint that requires a curve or surface in the moving body to maintain contact with a curve or surface in the fixed body. For example, the contact between a cam and its follower is a higher pair called a cam joint. Similarly, the contact between the involute curves that form the meshing teeth of two gears are cam joints, as is a wheel rolling on a surface. It has a point or line contact.  Wrapping pair/ Higher pair  A wrapping/higher pair is a constraint that comprises belts, chains, and such other devices. A belt-driven pulley is an example of this pair. In this type of which is very similar to the higher pair (which is having point or line contact), but having multiple point contact...  References  * Hartenberg, R.S. & J.

Monument to the Iron Curtain not far from the border crossing Thayatal National Park in Austria, on the border with the Czech Republic The European Green Belt initiative is a grassroots movement for nature conservation and sustainable development along the corridor of the former Iron Curtain. The term refers to both an environmental initiative as well as the area it concerns. The initiative is carried out under the patronage of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Mikhail Gorbachev. It is the aim of the initiative to create the backbone of an ecological network that runs from the Barents to the Black and Adriatic Seas. The European Green Belt as an area follows the route of the former Iron Curtain and connects National Parks, Nature Parks, Biosphere Reserves and transboundary protected areas as well as non-protected valuable habitats along or across the (former) borders.Riecken, U., K. Ullrich, A. Lang (2007): A vision for the Green Belt in Europe, in: Terry, A., K. Ullrich and U. Riecken (Eds.): The Green Belt of Europe. From Vision to Reality, IUCN, Gland, Switzerland and Cambridge, UK, Background In 1970, satellite pictures showed a dark green belt of old-growth forest on the Finnish-Russian border.Haapala, H., Riitta, H., Keinonen, E., Lindholm, T. and Telk√§nranta, H. 2003. Finnish-Russian nature conservation cooperation. Finnish Ministry of the Environment and Finnish Environment Institute In the early 1980s, biologists discovered that the inner German border zone between Bavaria in the west and Thuringia in the east was a refuge for several rare bird species that had disappeared from the intensely used areas covering most of Central Europe.Beck,P.and Frobel,K.1981.Letzter Zufluchtsort:Der ‚ÄúTodesstreifen‚Äù? in: Vogelschutz: Magazin f√ºr Arten- und Biotopschutz (2):24 (English: Last refuge: Border strip?). The reasoning behind this observation was that negative human impact on the environment is smaller in such border zones which are commonly closed to public access and thus wildlife is minimally impacted by human activities. After the end of the Cold War in 1991, the strict border regimes were abandoned and the border zones gradually opened, starting with the German reunification in 1990 and continuing with the step-by-step integration of new member states into the Schengen Treaty as part of the enlargement process of the European Union. At the same time, large military facilities such as training grounds and military research establishments in or close to the border zones were closed down. For most cases, it was unclear whom the property of these lands belonged to and thus what the fate of the valuable landscapes would be. Against this background, the conservation initiative Green Belt formed to conserve the natural assets along the former Iron Curtain. Route The route of the Green Belt follows the course of the borders which during the second half of the 20th century divided the eastern European communist countries and the western capitalist countries. It is divided into four regional sections: * Fennoscandian Green Belt: Norway, Finland, Russia. * Baltic Green Belt: Estonia, Latvia, Russia and Lithuania. * Central European Green Belt: Poland, Germany (the inner German border), Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia and Italy * Balkan (or South Eastern European) Green Belt: Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Bulgaria, Romania, North Macedonia, Albania, Greece and Turkey History The historical starting point of the initiative was the Green Belt Resolution of Hof (Germany) in December 1989,Riecken, U. & Ullrich, K. (2010): Implementation of the Green Belt ‚Äì from paper to practice. 20 years of experience in Germany, in: Gulbinskas, S., Gasi≈´naitƒó, Z., Bla≈æauskas, N. and Sterr, H. (Eds.): 2nd Baltic Green Belt Forum - Towards sustainable development of the Baltic Sea coast, 304 pp., Klaipƒóda University Publishing, 2010 one month after the fall of the Berlin Wall. This document formulated and signed by more than 300 environmentalists from the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany initiated the first conservation projects targeting the inner German border. After several achievements, the idea was taken to the European level. After a first conference on the European Green Belt in 2003, it was decided to establish a working group with the World Conservation Union (IUCN) as overall coordinator for its implementation; IUCN together with the Ferto-Hans√°g National Park in Hungary organized the first meeting of the working group, which took place 9‚Äì12 September 2004.Vogtmann (2007): Preface, in: Terry, A., K. Ullrich and U. Riecken (Eds.): The Green Belt of Europe. From Vision to Reality, IUCN, Gland, Switzerland and Cambridge, UK, In the following, the working group together with stakeholders of the Green Belt elaborated a Programme of Work and proposed representatives in each country along the Green Belt to be officially appointed as National Green Belt Focal Points by the respective Ministry of Environment. A Memorandum of Understanding to jointly protect the Green Belt in Fennoscandia was signed by the Environmental Ministers of Russia, Finland and Norway in 2010.

Borders.Wilderness.Future., Publisher Bibliothek der Provinz, who contribute either on a project or voluntary basis. Ecological values Observations by biologists revealed that the military practice along the borderline led to wildlife conservation in numerous ways: * A ban on pesticide spraying has preserved many rare insects. * Keeping the vegetation cut so border guards can see across easily, stopped the area from becoming continuous forest and thus preserved wildlife that needs open land. * One peculiar occurrence noticed was that in a forested part of this belt on the frontier between Bavaria and Bohemia, 18 years after the border barrier was removed, forest deer still refused to cross the frontier: compare hefting of livestock. * Old landmine explosion craters have become wildlife ponds. * In the Bulgaria/Greece section there are many eastern imperial eagle nests. * Where the River Drava is the frontier between Hungary and Croatia: mutual mistrust prevented river development works, so the river and its banks are still natural, including the river creating sand cliffs where sand martins nest. The Drava has cut off meanders, leaving many bits of each nation's territory on the wrong side of the river; these areas are not farmed and have become wildlife areas. * Along the coast of the Mecklenburg area, restricted access to the coast, to stop people from crossing over by boat or swimming, helped to preserve coastal wildlife. Cultural values It has been proposed to develop not only the natural but also the cultural heritage of the Soviet period: following the idea to link the numerous historical initiatives, installations, projects and relics in the Green Belt with the natural heritage,Jeschke, H.-P.

Hug High School is a fully accredited public high school in Reno, Nevada, and belongs to the Washoe County School District. Hug High was built on a hillside in northeast Reno in 1968 to serve students from rapidly growing areas in northeast Reno, northwest Reno and the Northern Valleys. Like many other local schools, Hug High was named for a member of the local school board. The high school was named for Procter Hug Sr., a college athlete, teacher, athletic coach and Washoe County School Superintendent who went on after retirement to serve as a Nevada State Senator. History Hug High's first principal, Bud Garfinkle, opened the school for the 1968-69 academic year with only sophomores and juniors; the first senior class graduated in 1970. Hug was a three year high school until the 1972-73 academic year when freshmen were admitted as all Washoe County High Schools transitioned to four year schools. As Hug was founded in the late 1960s when the U.S. was undergoing intense social change and political turmoil (especially in relation to guaranteeing equal rights to all of its citizens and fighting an increasingly unpopular war in Vietnam), the events of this period contributed to the idealism of the school's first years. In a recent letter, Garfinkle reiterates these sentiments: \\"I feel as if I gave birth to a child... A child born at a time when our nation was wrestling with many new ideas: that all people should be treated equally, regardless of race, color or creed.\\"Garfinkle, Bud. Letter to Principal Andrew Kelly, Procter R. Hug High School, Reno, Nevada. Undated. As one of the most ethnically diverse high schools in the district, it could be said that shifts in Hug's fortunes have often provided a litmus lest to the community at large as to how far it has come to achieving these ideals. Hug High School is also home to the GATE Institute, providing advanced coursework and dual-enrollment opportunities for qualified students through the district Gifted and Talented Education Program. Demographics Enrollment peaked in the early 1970s, and again in the early 1980s. Hug High currently has an enrollment of approximately 1,461 students in grades 9-12. Recent statistics on the ethnic origin of the student body of Hug High School (2016-2017 school year, with district-wide statistics in parentheses): American Indian/Alaska Native: 0.89% (1.48%), Asian: 3.35% (4.25%), Hispanic: 70.91% (40.1%), Black/African American: 5.54% (2.36%), White/Caucasian: 12.94% (44.83%), Pacific Islander 3.01% (1.14%), Two or More Races 3.35% (5.83%). Campus Its nine buildings (Academic Buildings A, B, C, and D, the Industrial Arts building, the Gymnasium, the Little Theater and Cafeteria building, the Library, the Administration building, and JROTC rifle range) are set on a multilevel series of terraces, and most are connected by covered outdoor walkways. The facades of most of the buildings are covered in dark green serpentine stone panels, and the equally green campus has been landscaped with a wide variety of trees and plants over the years. Reno's first \\"school on the hill,\\" the campus offers a beautiful panoramic view of the Truckee Meadows to the south, and of the Sierra Nevada to the southwest. The campus has been decorated over the years with numerous murals and mosaics depicting the mascot, school colors and the letter \\"H\\" for Hug.  Academics  Over the years, Hug has offered both a general-education and a full college-preparatory curriculum, and many of its alumni have gone on to attend some of the nation's most prestigious colleges and universities, with some earning Ph.D.'s, J.D.'s and other advanced degrees. In recent years, Principal Andrew Kelly has instituted a \\"small schools\\" program, converting the A, B, and C buildings and the Gymnasium annex into semi-autonomous academic entities, in order to create a more individualized, less anonymous academic environment for students and teachers alike. He has also spoken out publicly about the racial and socioeconomic inequality still present in the Washoe County School District. More recently, Hug has received attention from the local television station KOLO for its improving academic standing as well as the introduction of gender-separate classes in its ongoing objective to boost student performance. For the 2016-17 School Year, Hug had a graduation rate of 82%, while district averaged 84%. Today Hug offers classes in English, from English as a Second Language up to Advanced Placement levels, mathematics from Algebra I to AP Calculus BC, sciences such as Biology, Chemistry and Physics, Social Studies up to Advanced Placement Levels, Spanish, French, Industrial arts and physical education, as well as numerous elective courses. In 2003, the Academic Olympics (AO) team placed 4th in Washoe County and the Science Bowl team competed in the Nevada regional competition. In 2004, the AO team placed 3rd in the district, the Science Bowl team placed 4th in the Nevada Regional, and the Robotics team placed in the top third in the Chesapeake Regional in Annapolis, Maryland.  Athletics  Hug competes in the High Desert League of the Northern Nevada 4A Region (large school). The campus has a lighted stadium for night games, tennis courts, a baseball field, and a softball field, also on a descending set of hillside terraces. Hug has been successful in boys' basketball, football, Soccer and boys' track this decade. The boys' basketball team won the Regional titles in 2002, 2009, 2011, and 2012; the football team was the state runner-up in 2005, along with the Northern Region championship. The Soccer team won regionals and finished runner up at state in 2011. and the boys' track & field team won the division, zone & state title in 2001 with less than 30 members, one of which was team captain Senior David Butler who went to state in four events. Many other members of the track team also had multiple events in which they all placed in the top five.  History and student life  Sociopolitical background. While Hug has almost always had a higher percentage of students from ethnic minorities and low-income families than other schools in the district, since the late 1980s the student body has undergone an even more extreme demographic shift,Zunino, Ben and George C. Hill. \\"Changing the Image of an Inner-City School.\\" Education, Vol. 123, Spring 2003, pp. 428-431. underscoring the underlying problem of racial and economic segregation that still could be said to characterize the school district as a whole. Academic achievements. In the 1970s and 1980s, it had a fine theater program under the direction of local actor and director Eve Loomis. Along with numerous musical, dramatic and dance performances, she founded a traveling children's theater troupe, the Hug High Harlequins, which traveled to elementary school audiences all over Northern Nevada. In the 1970s and 1980s there was also a Shakespeare Club, active in organizing yearly fieldtrips to Shakespeare performances of professional theater companies under the supervision of English teacher Joanne Walen. This group was also commonly known as \\"Little Willy's Gang.\\"Talon Yearbook. Procter R. Hug High School, Reno, Nevada, 1979-1982. Hug High, along with crosstown high school partner Wooster High, co-hosted the prestigious National Association of Student Councils conference in June 1982, bringing hundreds of high school student leaders from all over the country to the Hug campus for its three-day leadership workshop. At that time, Hug was also competitive in speech and debate at the state level, and had a marching band that eventually went on to represent the state in the 1997 Presidential Inaugural Parade in Washington, DC. The march written for the occasion by Hug High marching band director Gerald Willis was called the \\"Silver State Fanfare,\\" and after being played by a number of other Nevada marching bands was eventually named the Official State March by the Nevada Legislature in 2001. Cultural diversity at Hug. Whether the Native frybread lunches of the First Americans Club and Black History Month pageants of the 1970s and 1980s (both organized under the mentorship of counselor Dolores Feemster) or the Cinco de Mayo celebrations planned by the Hug Unidos Club, and Polynesian dancing that characterize student life today, students continue to add to the history of student life at Hug through exploring and sharing their multifaceted cultural heritage with others. Traditions. The school mascot is the Hawk. Although the school colors originally chosen by the student body were kelly green and white, the school administration later modified them in the 1980s to a darker forest green and white. The school yearbook is called the Talon, and the school newspaper is called \\"Soar.\\" Its drill team, originally called the Shamrocks, is now called Hawk Havoc. The traditional school totem was the Spirit Claw, given to the class at each school assembly deemed to have shown the most school spirit.

B. W. Kennedy), reprinted by Dover, New York (1963) As in the familiar use of the word chain, the rigid bodies, or links, are constrained by their connections to other links. An example is the simple open chain formed by links connected in series, like the usual chain, which is the kinematic model for a typical robot manipulator.J. M. McCarthy and G. S. Soh, 2010, Geometric Design of Linkages, Springer, New York. Mathematical models of the connections, or joints, between two links are termed kinematic pairs. Kinematic pairs model the hinged and sliding joints fundamental to robotics, often called lower pairs and the surface contact joints critical to cams and gearing, called higher pairs. These joints are generally modeled as holonomic constraints. A kinematic diagram is a schematic of the mechanical system that shows the kinematic chain. The modern use of kinematic chains includes compliance that arises from flexure joints in precision mechanisms, link compliance in compliant mechanisms and micro-electro-mechanical systems, and cable compliance in cable robotic and tensegrity systems.Larry L. Howell, 2001, Compliant mechanisms, John Wiley & Sons. Alexander Slocum, 1992, Precision Machine Design, SME  Mobility formula  The degrees of freedom, or mobility, of a kinematic chain is the number of parameters that define the configuration of the chain.J. J. Uicker, G. R. Pennock, and J. E. Shigley, 2003, Theory of Machines and Mechanisms, Oxford University Press, New York. A system of n rigid bodies moving in space has 6n degrees of freedom measured relative to a fixed frame. This frame is included in the count of bodies, so that mobility does not depend on link that forms the fixed frame. This means the degree-of-freedom of this system is M = 6(N ‚àí 1), where N = n + 1 is the number of moving bodies plus the fixed body. Joints that connect bodies impose constraints. Specifically, hinges and sliders each impose five constraints and therefore remove five degrees of freedom. It is convenient to define the number of constraints c that a joint imposes in terms of the joint's freedom f, where c = 6 ‚àí f. In the case of a hinge or slider, which are one degree of freedom joints, have f = 1 and therefore c = 6 ‚àí 1 = 5\\\\. The result is that the mobility of a kinematic chain formed from n moving links and j joints each with freedom fi, i = 1, ..., j, is given by : M = 6n - \\\\sum_{i=1}^j (6 - f_i) = 6(N-1 - j) + \\\\sum_{i=1}^j f_i Recall that N includes the fixed link. Analysis of kinematic chains The constraint equations of a kinematic chain couple the range of movement allowed at each joint to the dimensions of the links in the chain, and form algebraic equations that are solved to determine the configuration of the chain associated with specific values of input parameters, called degrees of freedom. The constraint equations for a kinematic chain are obtained using rigid transformations [Z] to characterize the relative movement allowed at each joint and separate rigid transformations [X] to define the dimensions of each link. In the case of a serial open chain, the result is a sequence of rigid transformations alternating joint and link transformations from the base of the chain to its end link, which is equated to the specified position for the end link. A chain of n links connected in series has the kinematic equations, : [T] = [Z_1][X_1][Z_2][X_2]\\\\cdots[X_{n-1}][Z_n],\\\\\\\\! where [T] is the transformation locating the end-link‚Äînotice that the chain includes a \\"zeroth\\" link consisting of the ground frame to which it is attached. These equations are called the forward kinematics equations of the serial chain.J. M. McCarthy, 1990, Introduction to Theoretical Kinematics, MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Kinematic chains of a wide range of complexity are analyzed by equating the kinematics equations of serial chains that form loops within the kinematic chain. These equations are often called loop equations. The complexity (in terms of calculating the forward and inverse kinematics) of the chain is determined by the following factors: * Its topology: a serial chain, a parallel manipulator, a tree structure, or a graph. * Its geometrical form: how are neighbouring joints spatially connected to each other? Explanation Two or more rigid bodies in space are collectively called a rigid body system. We can hinder the motion of these independent rigid bodies with kinematic constraints. Kinematic constraints are constraints between rigid bodies that result in the decrease of the degrees of freedom of rigid body system. Synthesis of kinematic chains The constraint equations of a kinematic chain can be used in reverse to determine the dimensions of the links from a specification of the desired movement of the system. This is termed kinematic synthesis.R. S. Hartenberg and J. Denavit, 1964, Kinematic Synthesis of Linkages, McGraw-Hill, New York. Perhaps the most developed formulation of kinematic synthesis is for four-bar linkages, which is known as Burmester theory.Suh, C. H., and Radcliffe, C. W., Kinematics and Mechanism Design, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1978.Sandor,G.N.,andErdman,A.G.,1984,AdvancedMechanismDesign:AnalysisandSynthesis, Vol. 2. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ.Hunt, K. H., Kinematic Geometry of Mechanisms, Oxford Engineering Science Series, 1979 Ferdinand Freudenstein is often called the father of modern kinematics for his contributions to the kinematic synthesis of linkages beginning in the 1950s. His use of the newly developed computer to solve Freudenstein's equation became the prototype of computer-aided design systems. This work has been generalized to the synthesis of spherical and spatial mechanisms.

An optical phased array (OPA) is the optical analog of a radio wave phased array. By dynamically controlling the optical properties of a surface on a microscopic scale, it is possible to steer the direction of light beams (in an OPA transmitter), or the view direction of sensors (in an OPA receiver), without any moving parts. Phased array beam steering is used for optical switching and multiplexing in optoelectronic devices, and for aiming laser beams on a macroscopic scale. Complicated patterns of phase variation can be used to produce diffractive optical elements, such as dynamic virtual lenses, for beam focusing or splitting in addition to aiming. Dynamic phase variation can also produce real-time holograms. Devices permitting detailed addressable phase control over two dimensions are a type of spatial light modulator (SLM).  Transmitter  An optical phased array transmitter includes a light source (laser), power splitters, phase shifters, and an array of radiating elements. The output light of the laser source is split into several branches using a power splitter tree. Each branch is then fed to a tunable phase shifter. The phase shifted light is input to a radiating element ( a nanophotonic antenna) that couples the light into free space. Radiated light by the elements is combined in the far-field and forms the far-field pattern of the array. By adjusting the relative phase shift between the elements, a beam can be formed and steered.  Receiver In an optical phased array receiver, the incident light (usually coherent light) on a surface is captured by a collection of nanophotonic antennas that are placed on a 1D or 2D array. The received light by each element is phase shifted and amplitude weighted on a chip. These signals are then added together in the optic or electronic domain to form a reception beam. By adjusting the phase shifts, the reception beam can be steered to different directions and light incident from each direction is collected selectively.  Applications  In nanotechnology, phased array optics refers to arrays of lasers or SLMs with addressable phase and amplitude elements smaller than a wavelength of light. While still theoretical, such high resolution arrays would permit extremely realistic three-dimensional image display by dynamic holography with no unwanted orders of diffraction. Applications for weapons, space communications, and invisibility by optical camouflage have also been suggested. DARPA's Excalibur program aims to provide realtime correction of atmospheric turbulence for a laser weapon.

They comprise a post mill and a tower mill, and the roundhouse of a former post mill. All three are Grade II* listed buildings.  Setting and access  The windmills stand atop the South Downs with views of the Sussex Weald. They are seven miles north of the city of Brighton and Hove. As well as Jack and Jill, the roundhouse of Duncton Mill survives, located a short distance east of Jack. The mills are accessible by road at the end of Mill Lane from the A273 road where it crosses the South Downs. There is free parking in the car park beside the mills.  History of the mills =Duncton Mill Duncton Mill was built in 1765. It was owned by Viscount Montague and leased for 99 years. Duncton Mill was demolished in 1866, leaving the roundhouse to be used as a store. Duncton Mill description Duncton Mill was a post mill with a single storey roundhouse, four Common sails. It was winded by hand and had two pairs of millstones. The Head Wheel from Duncton Mill was used as the Brake Wheel in Jack when that mill was built. Jill Jill is a post mill originally built in Dyke Road, Brighton, in 1821. It was known as Lashmar's New Mill and was built to replace Lashmar's Old Mill. In 1830, the Windshaft broke, bringing the sails crashing to the ground. A painting by Nash dated 1839 and an engraving in the Handbook to Brighton (1847) show her to have had a roof mounted Fantail, similar to the arrangement still found on Icklesham windmill. Lashmar's New Mill was the most southerly of the three Dyke Road post mills. In 1852 she was moved to Clayton by a team of horses and oxen. The site is now Belmont‚Äîa short street of Grade II-listed villas. The working life of the mills ended in 1906 and in 1908 Jill was damaged in a storm. She lost her fantail and sails over the years until in 1953 restoration was carried out by E Hole and Son, the Burgess Hill millwrights, funded by Cuckfield Rural District Council. In 1978, restoration of Jill to working order was commenced. Jill ground flour again in 1986. During the Great Storm of 1987, the mill's sails were set in motion with the brake on, setting fire to the mill. Some members of the Windmill Society were able to get to the mill and save her. Today, Jill is in working order and open to the public most Sundays between May and September. She produces stoneground wholemeal flour on an occasional basis. The vast majority of her flour is sold to visitors. It is ground from organic wheat, grown locally in Sussex. On the occasions when the wind is blowing and Jill is in operation, a guide is available to explain the process of milling. Jill Windmill is owned by Mid Sussex District Council. Jill description Jill is a post mill with a two-storey roundhouse. She has four Patent Sails and is winded by a five blade fantail mounted on the tailpole. The windshaft is wooden, with a cast iron poll end dated 1831. Jill has two pairs of millstones, arranged Head and Tail. The compass arm Tail Wheel shows evidence of having been used as a Brake Wheel at some time. The main Post of Jill is made from four separate pieces of timber, a feature seen in some Sussex post mills and only found in this and Argos Hill Mill today. Jack Jack is a five-storey tower mill built in 1866 to replace Duncton Mill. Worked as a pair with Jill, Jack worked until c.1907. Unusually Jack mill has a male name -- almost every other mill in the country is considered female. In 1928, while a pit was being dug for a water tank, an Anglo-Saxon skeleton was discovered. It was later removed to the British Museum. Jack has been owned by barrister Jolyon Maugham since 2013. Jack description Jack is a five- storey tower mill with a domed cap. He carries four Patent Sails and was winded by a five blade fantail. There was a stage at first floor level. It is believed that Jack was built by the millwright Cooper, of Henfield. In 1873, Jack was fitted with Hammond's Patent Sweep Governor, a feature also fitted to the post mill at Herstmonceux, which was also run by the Hammonds. Jack had three pairs of millstones, and room for a fourth pair. All machinery below windshaft level has been removed. In 1966, Jack was fitted with new sails as he was to appear in a film. Jack is to the curb, diameter at the base and diameter at the curb. The present owners have lived at the windmill since 2012. The Mill House and Granary were built for them by architect Sarah Featherstone of Featherstone Young in 2016. The Granary retains the historical beams and original footprint of the 18th century granary, while the Mill House is a reconfiguration of Henry Longhurst's house. Together, the buildings connect Jack and Jill windmills on a straight axis, opening up views throughout the site.

TeleMation started with a line of black-and-white video equipment, and later manufactured color video products. Lyle Keys was the founder and president of TeleMation, Inc., started in the late 1960s. Early equipment was for the B&W; broadcast, cable television, and CCTV market. History In 1954, Lyle Oscar Keys was an itinerant equipment salesman from Wibaux, Montana. John F. Fitzpatrick was president of The Salt Lake Tribune at the time. Fitzpatrick's assistant John W. Gallivan hired Keys as an engineer for KUTV Channel 2, of which the Tribune was part owner. In a time when the electronics industry was burgeoning, Keys knew how to get essential parts fast in a time when these parts were unavailable or slow to get. By 1962, the Tribunes owner, Kearns-Tribune Corporation, and their partners in KUTV organized Electronic Sales Corporation (ELCO) to help meet these needs. Keys was installed as president with an office in the Kearns Building in Salt Lake City. Within eight years, the company, which had been incorporated as Telemation, had 420 employees, producing and marketing 156 products for the television industry with annual sales of $10 million. It became the nation's largest supplier of closed circuit TV systems and developed scores of proprietary items for cable television, industrial, educational and commercial TV. Keys personally conceptualized many of the firm's products, helped engineer them, produced millions of dollars in sales, and even wrote Telemation's news releases and advertising copy. He also laid out the blueprint for the company's development of of space in southwest Salt Lake County's technological park.

Telemation Productions Telemation Productions was a post-production house in Seattle, Washington; Chicago, Illinois; Phoenix, Arizona; and Denver, Colorado in the 1970s and early 80s. Offices were sold or closed in the late 1980s. Telemation Productions was started as a marketing tool by Telemation Inc. in the early 1970s. It started as a single office located in Glenview, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. In 1978, a second office was opened in Denver. Also in 1978, the television equipment manufacturing operation was sold to Bell & Howell. At that time, Telemation Inc. owned only the two production facilities and the manufacturing building in Salt Lake City, which was leased to Bell & Howell. In 1979 Telemation acquired a production facility in Seattle and renamed it Telemation Productions. In the early 1980s, Telemation acquired a facility in Phoenix, also renaming it Telemation Productions. In the early 1980s, Telemation Productions added a distribution division located in Chicago which provided duplication and shipping services to advertising agencies and a mobile division equipped with a television remote truck. Telemation Productions ownership changed in 1987 and again in 1990, with the Home Shopping Network buying the company. The Phoenix office and distribution division were sold in 1989 prior to this acquisition. The remote truck was sold in 1990. The Seattle office was closed in 1991, the Chicago office was closed in 1993, and the Denver office was closed the following year.

Road Town Fort is a colonial fort which was erected on Russell Hill in Road Town, Tortola in the British Virgin Islands above the town's main wharf. In historical records it is sometimes referred to as Fort Road Town. The fort subsequently fell into ruin, and in the 1960s the Bougainvillea clinic (known locally as the Purple Palace for fairly obvious reasons) was built on top of the old structure.The clinic was built by a British surgeon, Dr Robin Tattersall; Dr Tattersal's then-wife, Jill Tattersall is noted local historian who has written widely on the history of the Territory, although never, ironically, on Road Town Fort. The strong room of the original fort, which was once the Territory's treasury, still survives today, and is now used as a storeroom by the clinic. However, the main fortification was built by the British in the late 18th century around the outbreak of the American war of independence as part of the general upgrade of the fortifications of Road Town, and it was garrisoned throughout the Napoleonic Wars. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars, and the abolition of slavery the fort was eventually abandoned as the Territory sank into economic decline, and the expense of its upkeep could no longer be justified. Road Town Fort formed part of a formidable defensive network of forts around Road Town erected at this time. Road Town itself was triangulated with Fort Burt in the western entrance to the harbour, Fort George at the eastern entrance, Road Town Fort in the middle above the main jetty, and Fort Charlotte set high above on Harrigan's Hill. Some of the original walls remain visible from Main Street below. It is possible that the Road Town Fort was built on the remains of an earlier Dutch stockade; it is known that two forts erected by the British in Road Town were built on what were thought (by them) to be earlier Dutch sites, but they are believed to be Fort Burt and Fort George. However, some historians are less sure about Fort Burt (as it does not tie in with Spanish records relating to their attacks on Tortola in the 17th century) and it may be that one of the former Dutch stockades lies under Road Town Fort. Fort Charlotte was built on an earlier Dutch look-out post. Road Town Fort never actually engaged in combat. The combination of the formidable martial defences of Road Town, and relatively small strategic and economic importance of Tortola persuaded both foreign colonial powers and privateers and pirates alike to focus on other targets within the region. Given the prevalence of the attacks on Road Town by Spanish privateers prior to the re-fortification of Road Town, the Road Town Fort could be said to have fulfilled its role it was intended for despite the absence of battle. The clinic is a private clinic, and there is no general public access to the remains of the structure. However, from Main Street below, looking up, one can still see some of the remains of the outer wall.

In the context of animation, the inverse kinematics of the armature is the most relevant computational algorithm. There are two types of digital armatures: Keyframing (stop-motion) armatures and real-time (puppeteering) armatures. Keyframing armatures were initially developed to assist in animating digital characters without basing the movement on a live performance. The animator poses a device manually for each keyframe, while the character in the animation is set up with a mechanical structure equivalent to the armature. The device is connected to the animation software through a driver program and each move is recorded for a particular frame in time. Real-time armatures are similar, but they are puppeteered by one or more people and captured in real-time. Inside of every puppet stop motion character is an Armature. Armature fills two main functions, It must move in a human-like manner in order to give life to character animation. The inner skeletal structure must be close to human-like as possible this includes having joint and finger flexibility. Human movements also involve spinning at the elbows, knees, shoulders and hips in order to bend down and pick up something from the ground. The second job of an armature is to not move. It is necessary that armature does not move, it must have some stiffness when positioned into place. ‚Äúyou don't want to be in the middle of a shoot with several minutes can pass by between each shot and have the puppets slowly drooping between one shoot and the next‚Äù (Justatinyamount, 2018). In built geometric movement can extend into the hands and feet. Even facial movements are available in some armature figures. ‚ÄúThere are two types of digital armatures: Keyframing (stop-motion) armatures and real-time (puppeteering) armatures‚Äù (Wikipedia Article). Both Key framing and of wax, clay or plaster. Historically, armatures were made of chicken wire, wood and many pounds of clay, making them very heavy‚Äù (Computer Animation Complete, Parent, Rick). Real-time puppeteering Real-time Puppeteering, simply means that the character skeleton is controlled by a human animator, by ‚Äúsimple mapping between a hardware controller (such as a gamepad, a wiimote, a custom puppet controller, or even your body with a kinect-based system) and the character‚Äôs 3D animation armature‚Äù (Three Real-Time Animation Methods, Hancock, Terry). Because of the nature of Puppeteering devices there is no attempt to control ‚ÄúNatural Motion‚Äù, you just simply manipulate the Digital puppet to do what you want. It takes some skill to do this like puppeteering, ‚ÄúYou can take advantage of the puppeteer's skills, because these guys are masters. It‚Äôs just amazing seeing them put their hand in a puppet and it just comes to life‚Äù (‚ÄúComputer Animation Complete‚Äù, Parent, Rick). Digital Real- Time Armature main difference, ‚ÄúIt is controlled or we can say it is being puppets by people and the motions are captured in real time. This type of animation is used basically for 2D or 3D figures and objects created by using some 2D and 3D animation software. This type of animation armature is used for mainly filmmaking and Television production purposes. The film made using this technique is captured in real time by making the character move and capturing its live performance for the film‚Äù (Virtualschooldek.com). Motions are recorded with digital software. Software such as Blender, ‚ÄúBlender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline‚Äîmodeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, video editing and 2D animation pipeline‚Äù (https://www.blender.org). This software allows the registering of data from Digital Armatures. Types of armatures build Action Figures can also be converted into Armatures, for instance, TV shows such as Robot Chicken use modified forms of Armature Action Figures for their show. The most common toys for Armature are Lego‚Äôs, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easy to see why they look great, they stay where you put them and you can move them around a reasonable amount‚Äù (Youtube Video ‚ÄúThe 3 main types of Armature‚Äù). The only setback is their range of motion so this calls for them to be modified, so aluminium wire is inserted inside of them in order for joints to have a wider range of motion that seems organic to the character. In the ‚ÄúLego Movie‚Äù, the majority of the characters were Digital Armatures. Director Chris Miller, even used his childhood Lego Toy as the main character for the entire movie; ‚ÄúChris Miller literally brought his broken space man toy which he had since he was a little kid ‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs the level of detail and realism we wanna create (Film). Armatures was not the only method used but it was a hybrid effort of techniques in order to achieve the final product. Modifications can be done on figures such as LEGOs, such as installing wire through the character in order to have a fuller range of motion. Bringing life into toys is nothing new shows such as ‚ÄúRobot Chicken‚Äù implement, Action Figure Armatures in order for iconic doll super heroes to appear on the show. Twisted Wire Armature is another cost-effective method used by animators, the only problem with this type of method is that joints are not strong and will lead to a drooping figure over time. Ball and Sockets Armatures have been the traditional method in which figures have been built, with a method such as this the plates inside the puppet are easily adjustable for stiffness. Balls and sockets can often be bulky so a Hybrid method between Twisted Wire Armature and Ball and Socket Armatures are created by animators in order for characters to move fluidly throughout the body. Ball and Socket Armature Kits are available for purchase, but these figures are often expensive. Descriptions for Kits include, ‚ÄúThe Standard Armature Kit comes complete with everything you need to make your own armature. It is easy assembled and has been designed to meet most character designs. As well as double jointed ball and socket joints‚Äù (Animation Supplies Website). How armatures work ‚ÄúPuppeteering armatures are very similar to keyframing armatures, expect the motion is captured in real time as performed by one or more puppeteers.‚Äù( Parent, Rick and Computer Animation Complete) Through the use of tracking markers, sensors, hand controls, and animation software, ‚Äúpuppeteers‚Äù are able to produce an animated performance in real time. Through a live performance conducted in real time, sensors and tracking markers attached to the performer help translate their body movements into the actions and expressions that the 3D digital armature replicates in real time. Rather than using an armature model with joints and built in sensors, this type of ‚Äúreal time‚Äù animation relies on a live performer and the movements they conduct to simulate the actions the 3D digital armature will follow. Aside from the sensors attached to the live performer used to record their body movements, face trackers are also used to record the performers facial expressions in real time as well . ‚Äú The most popular are the real-time optical face trackers, consisting of a camera that is placed in a structure attached to the performer‚Äôs head so that it moves with the performer. The device captures the motion of small markers placed in different areas of the face.‚Äù( Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Menache, Alberto). Along with the body sensors these facial trackers allow the puppets to capture the real time expression and digitally animate it. However the application of facial tracks through real time simulations has a limit when it comes to its range of detail. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, these are 2D devices that cannot capture certain motions such as puckering of the lips, so the data is all in one plane and not very realistic. Three-dimensional facial motion data can be captured with an optical system using two or more cameras, yielding a much better result, but not in real time.‚Äù ( Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Menache, Alberto). Aside from the use of live performers in real time armatures, digital armatures made of joints, and sensors can also be used to simulate animated movement in real time. ‚ÄúThe last commercially available example of a digital armature was the Monkey 2 by Digital Image Design in New York City. It was modular, so it could be assembled in different joint configurations.‚Äù( Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Menache, Alberto) With modular capabilities embedded in the armature the puppeteers are allowed to maneuver the figure and transport its actions digitally. ‚ÄúBoth stop-motion and real time types consist of a series of rigid modules connected by joints whose rotations are measured by potentiometers or angular sensors. The sensors are usually analog devices, but they are called digital because the resulting readings are converted to digital signals to be processed by the computer system. These armatures are typically modular in order to accommodate different character designs.‚Äù( Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Menache, Alberto) The modular design allows for these digital armature models to simulate movements that in an animated environment resemble those of a human or animal. ‚Äú The first-generation Monkey had a fixed configuration, which made it unusable for any non humanoid applications.‚Äù(Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Menache, Alberto) A modular armature helps overcome this problem and create a solid baseline that is capable of various movements and extensions. Now depending on the package contents that come with the digital armature model itself the price may vary. ‚Äú The typical cost for a 39-joint Monkey 2 setup was approximately $15,000, which included all the necessary parts as well as driver software for most well known animation packages.‚Äù(Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Menache, Alberto) Both the live performance and digital armature real time animation methods convert to digital formats allowing the puppeteers different ways to produce and create an animated visual. Through real time armatures ‚ÄúMotus Digital‚Äù is able to bring their creations to life and implement interactive settings within their animations. Through real time armature this company creates ‚ÄúLarry the Zombie‚Äù, an interactive character that they use in their business ventures. ‚ÄúThis year Larry will take our Real-Time technology to the next level by attending the show himself, in search of ‚ÄúThe Next Big Thing‚Äù. He will interview panelists, share his schedule and report what‚Äôs going on and do whatever it takes to find the next big thing. Unlike Elf Hotline that takes place at the ‚ÄúNorth Pole‚Äù, Larry lives in the real world and is keen on pop culture and world events. Although the Real-Time interviews will be conducted via Skype, Larry‚Äôs character will be composited into the shot giving Larry a real presence at this years South by SouthWest.‚Äù( Motus Digital) Through real time armature this company shows how creative and interactive content can be created and shared with a larger audience. Keyframing (stop motion) Stop motion animation is captured one frame at a time and when they are played back it looks like movement. It is achieved by taking a picture of each individual frame and then editing it together in whatever software you may prefer. The more fluid you want the movements to look, the more frames you would need. Stop motion works just a flipbook but in a digital format. In this analogy frames would be equivalent to the pages in a flipbook, the more pages you have the more organic the movements look. Stop motion animation can be integrated into live action films or be completely animated. Live action movies like ‚ÄúThe Terminator‚Äù(1984) and ‚ÄúRoboCop‚Äù (1987) both had stop motion sequences. Tim Burton: Armature Influence Tim Burton, a graduate from CalArts in southern california, was well aware of the stop motion techniques available to him. CalArts, founded by Walt Disney, in 1961 was innovating computer applications of armatures and other forms of computer designs. A popular example of stop motion are Tim Burton movies, his animated ones of course. ‚ÄúNightmare before Christmas‚Äù, ‚ÄúCorpse Bride‚Äù, ‚ÄúCoraline‚Äù, etc. A lot goes into making a stop motion film with the quality of a Tim Burton one. Everything you see on screen was made by someone in the crew. The set was built, the puppets were hand made and every single frame was an individual picture taken. On a behind the scenes video for the movie ‚ÄúFrankenweenie‚Äù one of the crew members shows one of their exposure sheets which is a stop motion equivalent to a shot list. The frames are broken down in phonetics (the sound a letter makes) which means it takes multiple frames to even make one word that a character may say. The crew member has to shape the puppet's mouth so that it matches every sound made in every word that the voice actor says in the dialogue. It is also mentioned in the video that even the smallest action such as blinking requires the puppets eyelids to be replaced each time. In the behind the scenes video for the movie ‚ÄúCoraline‚Äù crew members show how movement can look so fluid in stop motion by explaining the process of rigging. Rigging in stop motion is when someone uses mechanics like winding or pulling to propel a puppet or set piece through space. For example an animator may put an object on a piece of wire and move the wire in different positions and then edit the wire out in post production. Tim Burton‚Äôs love for the old age technique of stop-motion animation, which has contributed a big part to its success is due to his obsession with the simple idea that this specific technique could really bring to life ideas that otherwise would be impossible. ‚ÄúThe animation helped viewers identify with something that could not possibly exist.‚Äù Burton‚Äôs need to use stop-motion animation was due to the idea that ‚Äúit could bring something purely imagined to vivid life in a way that 2-D animation couldn‚Äôt.‚Äù This was amplified through his exploration with other works of art such as James Whale‚Äôs Frankenstein, which helped focus on those ideas of monsters and his need to create them in his life. There is no question that Burton did exactly that with his work in The Nightmare Before Christmas which brought this technique back into the limelight. Although Burton worked with animators like John Lasseter who made Toy Story happen with computer animation he never lost focus on stop-motion animation. This helped him create amazing films such as Corpse Bride and remake of his 1984 short film Frankenweenie. To no surprise Burton‚Äôs original commercial for MoMA‚Äôs exhibition was made with the age-old technique of stop-motion animation to honor the amazing creator. Although Tim Burton was not the original creator of this technique he was honored in part of the series to help represent the influence that his films have had on the technique. Other creators who have come before him in the field of stop-motion animation are Harryhausen ‚Äúthe subject of a MoMA retrospective‚ÄîRay Harryhausen: Special Effects (May 28‚ÄìSeptember 1, 1981)‚Äù. Harryhausen who trained under Willis O‚ÄôBrien ‚Äúcreator of effects in King Kong (1933) and Mighty Joe Young (1949)‚Äù. Wes Anderson: Armature Animation Influence Wes Anderson is a director who primarily makes live action films but he does have two stop motion animated movies ‚ÄúFantastic Mr. Fox‚Äù and ‚ÄúIsle of Dogs‚Äù. Although these films are animated they still show Wes Anderson‚Äôs signature style. In a behind the scenes video for the movie ‚ÄúIsle of Dogs‚Äù it‚Äôs shown that animators used actual movement as a reference. They had real dogs on set so that they could have something to base their animation on. Also animators would film themselves walking or doing any action that they need to animate and then they would look at it when animating a human puppet. This helped them to make action look more fluid and realistic because they were using themselves as a reference. History of Stop Motion Stop motion started in the late 1800s. The first ever Stop-motion film was released in 1898 ‚ÄúThe Humpty Dumpty Circus‚Äù created by J. Stuart Black and Albert E. Smith. It was popularized by the animator Willis O‚Äô Brien who mixed stop motion with live actors. His best known work was ‚ÄúKing Kong‚Äù(1933). In 1940 animator George Pal developed a technique called ‚Äúreplacement animation‚Äù. Instead of using clay or any other malleable material to change the puppet he created multiple wooden heads, each with a different facial expression and replaced the heads when conveying different emotions. In 1944 George Pal won an Oscar for this technique. In 1955 Art Clokey, a pioneer in claymation (stop motion with clay figures), created ‚ÄúGumby‚Äù for ‚ÄúThe Howdy Doody Show‚Äù. In 1961 he also created the children‚Äôs show ‚ÄúDavey and Goliath‚Äù which was sponsored by the Lutheran Church. Claymation Claymation is a very popular type of Stop motion animation used by many different creators. Pioneered by Art Clokey as mentioned in the previous section, Claymation is still used by modern day animators. It was used by Tim Burton and Henry Selick in films like ‚ÄúParaNorman‚Äù ‚ÄúCoraline‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Nightmare before Christmas‚Äù. Director and animator Nick Park also used claymation in all of his ‚ÄúChicken Run‚Äù and ‚ÄúWallace and Gromit‚Äù movies. Rankin/Bass Productions Inc. also used claymation in Christmas special movies like ‚ÄúRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer‚Äù(1964) and ‚ÄúJack Frost‚Äù(1979) both in which air on the network NBC. Although all of these films use clay and stop motion animation, they each have their own unique look and style. Claymation has evolved throughout the years because all creators have their own vision and clay is so malleable that it could make endless styles of characters and scenery. moving clay. In this technique pieces of clay are moulded to create characters and based on the imagination of the animator, a story is unfolded. There are oil based and water based clays available. Sometimes the clay is moulded into free forms or filled up in a wire like structure called armature. The animated characters are kept in a set and with only short movements, the whole scene is film. Famous examples of this technique being used are, Missing Link by Chris Butler, Kubo and the two strings by Travis Andrew Knight, Coraline by Charles Henry Selick, The Boxtrolls by Graham Annable, Anthony Stacchi. Other animation techniques * Stop motion: The illusion of movement achieved by moving a figure in tiny increments between each photographed frame * Object-Motion: moving or animating objects, this is a form of stop motion animation that uses physical items instead of drawn objects which are not meant to be a human or recognizable character. * Puppet Animation: moving puppets, a unique phenomenon. It's born out of the hard work of its pioneers and their followers to bring creative impulses to life by experimenting with new technologie. in cinema a great example of this technique being used is in the film King Kong (1933). The writer/director Tim Burton often uses puppet animation in his work for example, Corpse Bride (2005) which is a stop motion animated horror musical.
