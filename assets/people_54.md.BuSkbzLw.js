In 1951, Nicaragua took its first loan from the World Bank in the form of the Highway Project. The goal of the Highway Project was to finance the construction of 266 kilometers of paved roads in order to facilitate the economic growth of Nicaragua. The creation of reliable roads helped open up new sections of land to agricultural development in Nicaragua. The Nicaraguan Revolution from 1979-1990 led to troubles with the World Bank as in 1984, Nicaragua became the first country to go into nonaccrual status with the IBRD. An onset of debt issues during the Nicaraguan Revolution led to a nonaccrual status with the IBRD and prompted fears of repayment issues. After the Nicaraguan Revolution, Nicaragua signed the MIGA Articles of Agreement in 1992 making it the 81st member of this group within the World Bank. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) was created to promote foreign investment in developing countries by providing insurance and credit enhancement to lenders and investers. The World Bank continues to operate in Nicaragua and notes that political unrest in 2018 has caused the economy to contract 3.8 percent prompting concerns that recent efforts to combat poverty levels will be undermined.  Recent World Bank Projects in Nicaragua  The World Bank continues to be heavily involved in Nicaragua. From 2018-2022, Nicaragua's Country Partnership Strategy (CPF) will be the main pathway to addressing poverty and creating prosperity for its citizens. The main goals of the CPF is to enable private investment, invest in human capital, and to strengthen public institutions to support risk management. One of the World Bank projects that falls under this mission is the Integrated Public Provision of Health Care Services project. The goal of the Integrated Public Provision of Health Care Services Project is to extend the coverage of health care to less advantaged groups while also increasing the quality of the health care. The cost of this World Bank project is sixty millions U.S. dollars. The loan will be used to finance consulting, training, and operation costs in order to support the goals of the project. Another modern project from the World Bank is the Rural and Urban Access Improvement Project which seeks to improve the accessibility of markets in rural areas through the development of roads and the strengthening of road management institutions. The cost of this project is $96.80 million dollars. Another main component of this project is to make resources available to the Nicaraguan government in the case of a crisis or emergency that warrants the use of the provided funds.

Founded by Jered Threatin, real name Jered Eames, it gained notoriety in November 2018 for its European tour, playing to largely empty venues. Threatin has been labelled a \\"fake band\\" by the music press and described as a vanity project of its founder. History=Background= Jered Eames was born in Moberly, Missouri. He formed the black metal band Saetith there with his older brother Scott. Following the break up of Saetith and a brief period with Abigail Williams, he moved to California in 2012 and began the band Threatin as a solo project, for which he adopted the name Jered Threatin. In 2015, Threatin released a single, \\"Living Is Dying\\". In 2017, the album Breaking the World was released, with Jered Threatin performing all instruments. =2018 tour incident= In November 2018, Threatin was booked to tour the United Kingdom and Europe having informed venues they had sold hundreds of tickets and had paid the hire fee before each gig. However, the tour achieved widespread news coverage when it became known that the shows had been played to empty rooms. The Camden Underworld in London had been told that 291 advance tickets had been sold, but only three people attended; similarly, 180 tickets had supposedly been sold for the Exchange in Bristol but the band played to an \\"empty room\\". Stories of empty venues began to break on social media before being picked up by MetalSucks, which initially published an expos√© on November 9, 2018.Vince Neilstein, L.A. Band Threatin Faked a Fanbase To Land a European Tour No One Attended, MetalSucks, November 9, 2018 MetalSucks investigated further, identifying Threatin as Eames and documenting his internet presence, including extensive fake record labels, booking companies and management companies, all registered to the same GoDaddy account.Threatin archives, MetalSucks, November 9‚Äì21, 2018 It was also discovered that the 38,000 likes on the band's Facebook page had been bought. The story was subsequently picked up by music publications such as NME, and then by the mainstream press. On November 11, Threatin's backing guitarist Joe Prunera and drummer Dane Davis left the band midway through the tour. Davis stated that bassist Gavin Carney was unable to quit the band as he could not afford a plane ticket home from Europe. Carney has stated he would be happy to work with Threatin again, although Threatin called himself \\"a solo artist, not a band. The session live musicians were hired solely for the purposes of this tour. There was never any intention of them touring in the future.\\" On November 14, Threatin issued a statement reading, \\"What is Fake News? I turned an empty room into an international headline. If you are reading this, you are part of the illusion.\\" Metal Injection commented that despite the publicity \\"we have seen no significant gains in Threatin's social media followings or their streaming numbers.\\" Scott Eames, Jered's brother and member of Thy Antichrist, who had previously played with his brother in Saetith, released a statement to distance himself from his brother's actions. He added that, \\"While [Jered] may try to spin all this as an elaborate hoax of sorts, I can assure you, knowing my brother, that this indeed was a failed attempt at entering the music industry.\\" In December, Threatin admitted the hoax and claimed to have sent emails to reporters exposing the hoax on the first day of the tour to build the controversy. This claim was later proved false by the BBC, who found the emails in question were sent after the failure of the tour. In May 2019 it was revealed that Prunera, Davis and Davis' mother had all sued Eames and his partner for costs accrued during the UK tour. Neither defendant attended the hearings, as Prunera was awarded $10,000 + $250 in court fees, Dane Davis was awarded $3,975.29 and Debra Davis was awarded $4,035.66.Jered Threatin‚Äôs Former Band Members Filed Lawsuits Against Him and Won MetalSucks.

However, his works represent a valuable source of information for later historians, even if their publication occurred with a lot of errors and delays, which partly explains the limited fame this author enjoyed.  Biography  He was born in Avezzano, Abruzzo. He completed his studies in Rome where he obtained a PhD in law before taking up theological studies and an ecclesiastical career. Febonio came, in 1626, to obtain the office of apostolic protonotary.. He became the abbot of Saint Cesidius Church in Trasacco in 1631 and the property administrator of the Colonna family in Marsica. Here he began to devote himself to the historical and geographical studies of his own land since it was lacking in historical summaries and documentation.. In 1648 Febonio settled first in Sulmona, where he obtained the post of general vicar of the cathedral and then, in 1651, in L'Aquila for the same position. During the troubled stay in L'Aquila he received several accusations, later totally dropped, from the vicar of St. Cesidius' Chair in Trasacco, including those of simony and murder. Misunderstandings and contrasts will arise with the new Aquilan bishop, Spanish Francesco Tellio de Leon, elected in 1654, which will prove irremediable. From 1660, after some years without posts when he devoted himself to scholarly studies with a greater commitment, he was partnered with the vicar of the Diocese of Veroli. The first draft of the precious Historiae marsorum () would date back just to 1660, however, the work, made of three books, was terminated between 1661 and 1662, and in all likelihood, after some months, so was the revision with the stylistic corrections suggested by historian Ferdinando Ughelli, also considered by Febonio as a master of erudition. He will spend the last years of his life in his native town as general vicar of Marsi diocese, finally partnering with the vicar of Pescina, where he died after a short disease.

The author of fifteen books & edited volumes, along with over fifty academic and media articles, he holds a Chair in Political Violence & Aesthetics at the University of Bath, United Kingdom. Evans work has centred on the political, philosophical and educational challenges posed by the problem of violence (in its many different forms), insisting upon the pedagogical need for a more \\"poetic\\" conversation between critical theorists, artists, writers and cultural produces. In 2011, Evans founded the Histories of Violence project that has grown to have a global user base spanning 148 different countries. His co-directed movie \\"Ten Years of Terror\\" (with Simon Critchley) screened in the Solomon K. Guggenheim, New York during September 2011. Having previously held positions at the University of Leeds and the University of Bristol, Evans has also been a visiting fellow at the Committee on Global Thought at Columbia University, New York (2013‚Äì14) and distinguished society fellow at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire (2017).  Biography  Evans grew up in the Rhondda mining valley communities of South Wales. His father became seriously ill before Evans's birth and the family was dependent on state welfare, and lived for a number of years on the notorious Penrhys social housing estate, a place of violent crime, drug abuse, theft, arson and widespread social depravation. They later moved to the village of Ton-Pentre where he lived until the age of eighteen. Evans said later that his youth had a formative impact on his understanding of structural and everyday violence, along with the importance of a critical education. Whilst inspired as a child by an illustrated copy his parents bought of Hans Christian Anderson fables, Evans suggested that his interest in reading only developed when we was around sixteen years old. This changed after reading Stephen King's Salems Lot: \\"Growing up in the isolating former mining valleys of South Wales, it was a book that resonated on so many levels. Indeed, having already been scared witless by the movie that was the first horror film I watched ‚Äì especially the scene of the floating child at the window, it was also the book, which taught me that words on pages are simply a point of entry into the more enriching and sometimes more terrifying life of the mind\\". Having attended Treorchy Comprehensive School, Evans initially pursued a career in fashion and design before going on to study at the University of Leeds, where he subsequently completed two master's degree programs in the fields of development economics and international relations. His PhD, titled \\"War for the Politics of Life\\", dealt with forms of resistance to liberal regimes of power, during which he spent visiting the Zapatista communities of Chiapas, Mexico. This experience led him to theorise about the ethics of (non)violence, arguing that violence itself is not the result of \\"differences\\" but rather it is the result of forced homogenisation. Such understanding on the nature of the human condition has led him to argue that Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll is the best book of political theory ever written: \\"Lewis Carroll is such a captivating thinker, who manages to break down the false and unhelpful binaries that set apart poetic vs. technical modes of thinking. Not only is Wonderland such a timeless book, I mean is there a better character to capture the politics of Trump than the Queen of Hearts ‚Äì she utters therefore its true ‚Äì but the way the book deals with questions of power, arbitrary violence and the transformation in subjectivities is truly exceptional. Moreover, Carroll allows us to rethink the very terms of resistance and revolution, for what are Alice‚Äôs greatest weapons, after-all, if not the power of her imagination? If we lack resistance to the present, it‚Äôs precisely because we don‚Äôt have an alternative vision of the world\\".  Overview of major works  Liberal Terror Evans' first book, Liberal Terror deals with the changing nature of security, war and violence in the latter part of the 20th Century. Focusing on the impact the complexity sciences have had on social and political understanding, the book addresses the shift away from the foundational logic of states to the age of radical interconnectivity, which collapse previous fixed arrangements in politics between the logics of what is inside and what is outside, friends and enemies, times of war and times of peace, along with disrupting ideas concerning the past, present and future. Addressing what is identified in security practice as the onset of a \\"catastrophic topography of endangerment\\", which has brought together all manner of threats \\"from terror to weather and everything in- between\\", Evans suggest we are living in a time of \\"terror normality\\". Central to the books thesis is the idea that liberal democracies have normalised insecurity in such a way that catastrophe is now presented as inevitable. Hence, countering arguments that focused after the September 11 attacks on the state of the exception (notably inspired by the ideas of the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben), Evans looks instead at the philosophy of events as a form of catastrophic rupture, which although bringing about the conditions of the new, offer a continuum where violence in response appears to be \\"business as usual\\". Connecting the global with the local, the book also considers the changing nature of political subjectivity as brought about through information and communications revolutions, leading to what Evans terms \\"the catastrophic individual\\" who is now capable of producing the image of a global security crises. In this Age of Catastrophe, Evans claims, our attention is therefore increasingly focused on spectacular media events and the promise of violence to come. The book was the focus for the inaugural episode of the comedian Russell Brand's podcast series Under the Skin. Resilient Life In Resilient Life: The Art of Living Dangerously (co-authored with Julian Reid), Evans provides the first substantive political and philosophical critique of the doctrine of resilience. Addressing the ways in which ideas concerning political subjectivity in the age of catastrophe promote insecurity by design, Evans & Reid provocatively suggest that resilience is ultimately a form of political nihilism, which forces people to accept a world that is catastrophically fated and whose ideas of disaster are inescapable. In order to counter this, they argue, there is a need to develop a more poetic understanding of politics that takes more seriously Nietzsche's claim \\"to live is to forever be in danger\\". According to Evans and Reid, this search for a new concept of the political has a number of important implications for critical thinkers: \\"[E]very intellectual project of a political kind should follow a number of basic principles1) Be deeply suspicious of anything that masks itself in universal regalia. Bring into question that which is not being questioned in the normal state of affairs. (2) Move beyond any self-righteous and self-absolving assessments of the operations of power. Look to deal with power at the level of its effects and the ways in which it positively manipulates subjects to wilfully abandon their own political freedoms. (3) Foreground the affirmative qualities of subjectivities. Not only is this integral in the fight against fascism in all its forms. It opens a challenge to the narcissism of those who would have us surrender to the mercies of the world. (4) Speak with confidence about the ability to transform the world, not for the better, but for the sake of it. Without an open commitment to the people to come, the struggle is already lost. (5) Use provocation as a political tool. Not to evidence extremist views. But to illustrate how normalizing power truly fears anything that appears remotely exceptional. The poetic most certainly included. (6) Trust in the irreducible qualities of human existence. The feelings we have, the atmospheres we breathe, the aesthetics we enfold, the fables we scribe, the playful personas we construct, they are all integral to the formation of a new image of thought. (7) Have faith in people. Just as they will resist what they find oppressive and intolerable, so they will also find their own dignified solutions to problems in spite of our best efforts. (8) Do not shy away from conflict. Without conflict there is no resistance to power. And without resistance to power there is no creation of alternative existences. (9) Reveal fully your political orientations. Do not abstract them from the work. Such a deception is of the order for those embarrassed by the mediocrity of their power. (10) Speak with the courage to truth that narrates a tale to affect a number of meaningful registers. No book should be read if it doesn't intellectually challenge and emotionally move us\\". Disposable Futures The book Disposable Futures: The Seduction of Violence in the Age of the Spectacle was co-authored with the public intellectual and educator Henry A. Giroux. In the book, they examine what they understand to be the production of \\"disposable lives\\" by addressing the connections between the spectacle and human disposability. Central to this work is the changing relationships between perpetrators, victims and witnesses of violence at a systemic level, in particular how modern societies curate what is seen and what is unseen, what is represented and what is ignored, and whose lives ultimately matter and whose can be disposed of without ethical consideration. To counter this, they argue, we need a new political imagination that moves beyond what they term \\"the dystopian realism\\" of the times. As they wrote in a published extract: \\"Never have we required with more urgency a new political imaginary that can take us out of the poverty of contemporary forms of catastrophe reasoning, which prove to be politically catastrophic and lead to civil and social death. Power has always feared those who have dared to think differently. It has always sought to pathologize and medicalize those who dared to imagine the alternatives instead of conforming. This is not incidental, for it is precisely in the realm of the imagination that we can rethink the world anew\\".  Conversations on violence  During 2016‚Äì2017, Evans led a series of conversation on violence for the opinions section of the New York Times engaging in conversation with a number of renowned thinkers including Simon Critchley, Bracha Ettinger, Zygmunt Bauman, Richard Bernstein and Simona Forti. Evans has continued this series in the Los Angeles Review of Books, with conversations featuring Oliver Stone, Russell Brand, John Akomfrah, Elaine Scarry, Malcolm London and Marina Abramovic.

Riding career Samuel Doggett began his career in horse racing as an exercise boy and began riding competitively as a fifteen- year-old in 1887 in County Fair races. By the early 1890s his success at the big racetracks led to his hiring by major stable trainers including Matthew Allen, John Hyland, John Rogers and Walter Rollins. In 1895, the Boston Post reported he was among the elite jockeys and was earning in excess of $10,000 a year. (US$300,522 in 2018) By the early years of the 1900s American jockeys were in great demand by owners throughout Europe and in 1901 Doggett joined Fred Taral in signing a lucrative contract to ride in Austria. Samuel Dogget's biography in the 1898 edition of The American Turf reported that \\"Throughout his career, Doggett has been noted for temperance, attention to business, and frugality\\" and that his home was \\"one of the most beautiful places in Gravesend, Brooklyn\\". =The American Classics= Samuel Doggett rode Dr. Rice in the June 10, 1893 Belmont Stakes, marking the first of three appearances in races that would become part of the U.S. Triple Crown series. In a field of five runners, he was aboard the favorite Dr. Rice, who had won the Withers Stakes, but it would be African-American jockey Willie Simms aboard Commanche who won by a head. On June 2, 1896 Samuel Doggett rode Del Paso II in the 1896 Belmont Stakes for the Marcus Daly stable, finishing fourth and last to August Belmont Jr.'s colt, Hastings. In a year when the Preakness Stakes was run four days after the Belmont Stakes, on June 6, 1896 Dodgett rode Hamilton II to a second second-place finish in the 1896 Preakness Stakes behind winner Margrave. Still active as an owner, he hired top trainer A. J. Goldsborough and with Canadian jockey Guy Burns aboard Doggett's filly Angerona they won the 1909 Fashion Stakes at Belmont Park. Training career In 1903 Samuel Doggett was no longer riding but had begun to train a small stable of four horses for himself then for other owners. In February 1907 he announced his retirement from racing and relocated to Denver, Colorado to go into the dry goods business with his brother.

It began forming in August, 1941, as a standard Red Army rifle division, in the Tomsk Oblast. After forming, it was assigned to the 59th Army, which soon moved west and joined the front facing the German Army Group North on the Volkhov River. In January, 1942, the division played a leading role in the early successes of the Lyuban Offensive Operation, which looked set to encircle and defeat the enemy forces laying siege to Leningrad. and on March 17 the division was redesignated as the 19th Guards Rifle Division. In November, 1944, a new 366th Rifle Division was formed in the Far Eastern Front, and saw action in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in August, 1945, being awarded the Order of the Red Banner for its services. 1st Formation The division began forming on August 10, 1941 in the Siberian Military DistrictWalter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 79 in the Tomsk Oblast. Its basic order of battle was as follows: * 1218th Rifle Regiment * 1220th Rifle Regiment * 1222nd Rifle Regiment * 938th Artillery Regiment Col. Semyon Ivanovich Bulanov was assigned to command of the division on September 1, and he would remain in command for the duration of the 1st formation. In late November it was assigned to the 59th Army which was also forming in the Siberian District. In mid-December the entire 59th Army was moved by rail to Vologda, in the Leningrad - Volkhov sector of the front. On December 17 the Army was assigned to the Volkhov Group of Leningrad Front, which later became Volkhov Front. On January 7, 1942, the 366th attacked across the frozen river and along with the rest of 59th Army and the 2nd Shock Army carved out a threatening, but vulnerable pocket deep behind Army Group North, but eventually the offensive stalled, mostly due to supply difficulties. On March 17 the division was recognized for its successes by being redesignated as the 19th Guards Rifle DivisionCharles C.

Glantz, The Battle for Leningrad 1941 - 1944, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2002, pp. 176-79 2nd Formation A new 366th Rifle Division was formed on November 27, 1944 from the second formation of the 21st Rifle Brigade and the 247th Rifle Brigade, in the 17th Rifle Corps of the 25th Army in Far Eastern Front, as part of the preparation for the coming offensive against the Japanese forces in Manchuria. It included the 401st, 428th, and 534th Rifle Regiments, the 604th Artillery Regiment, and smaller support units. The division was under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Alekseevich Manuilov (promoted to Colonel on April 30, 1945) from its formation until at least August 26, 1945. The division was still in 17th Corps when the Soviet invasion of Manchuria began in August, 1945, but that Corps was now part of the 5th Army. While the other division of the corps, the 187th Rifle Division, launched a frontal attack, the division encircled positions of the Japanese 284th Infantry Regiment of the 128th Division at Lotzokou from the south on 15 August. Late on the next day both divisions, in cooperation with a brigade of the 10th Mechanized Corps, pushed the Japanese forces out of Lotzokou and the Taipingling Pass. On September 19, 1945, the division was recognized for its service in the campaign with the award of the Order of the Red Banner. It was disbanded within weeks in accordance with the September 10 order that created the Primorsky Military District.

History  Our Children's Trust, was created by attorney Julia Olson to help formulate legal cases that could be taken against states and the federal government that would charge them with mitigating climate change under the public trust doctrine. Olson established the non- profit with advice and assistance from Mary Christina Wood, director of the Environmental and Natural Resources Law Program at the University of Oregon, who had been studying the concept of the public trust doctrine and established the idea of \\"Atmospheric Trust Litigation\\" to take legal action to make governments responsible for actions related to climate change. Part of OCT's inspiration was from Oposa's work in the Philippines. Since 2011, OCT has been filing various state and federal lawsuits on behalf of youth, though most of these have been dismissed by courts, as courts generally have not ruled that access to a clean environment is a right that can be litigated against. Such cases are also generally dismissed as lawsuits cannot be initiated by \\"generalized grievances\\", and require plaintiffs with standing to sue and can demonstrate concrete harm that the government has done, and that the courts can at least partially redress the harm by order of the court. Further, cases cannot be brought to court if they deal with a \\"political question\\" which cannot be resolved by actions of Congress and the President.  Juliana v. United States  Juliana, et al. v. United States of America, et al. is a lawsuit filed in 2015 that is being brought by 21 youth plaintiffs against the United States and several of its executive branch positions and officers, also formerly including President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama. The plaintiffs, represented by the non-profit organization Our Children's Trust, include Xiuhtezcatl Martinez, the members of Martinez's organization Earth Guardians, and on behalf of future generations represented by climatologist James Hansen. Some fossil fuel and industry groups were also initially named as defendants but were later dropped by a judge at their request. The lawsuit asserts that the government violated the youths' rights by allowing activities that harmed the climate and sought the government to adopt methods for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. The lawsuit is at the leading edge of an area of environmental law referred to as \\"atmospheric trust litigation\\", a concept based on the public trust doctrine and international responsibility related to the government's control over natural resources in the interest of public benefit. While previous lawsuits in a similar vein have been dismissed by U.S. Courts, Juliana v. United States gained attention in 2016 when U.S. District Court of Oregon Judge Ann Aiken upheld the idea that access to a clean environment was a fundamental right, allowing the case to proceed. Since then, the government has sought to dismiss the case for various concerns, which has delayed the case's hearing at the district court level. The case was rescheduled for a District Court trial following the Supreme Court's dismissal of the government's request to stay the trial. The Ninth Circuit scheduled oral argument on the appeal for the week of June 3, 2019 in Portland,Docket Order (Feb. 4, 2019) and the appeal was ultimately heard on June 4 in front of a different three-judge panel from the Ninth Circuit consisting of Mary H. Murguia, Andrew D. Hurwitz, and Josephine Staton (sitting by assignment), all of whom were appointed to the bench by former president Obama. Some legal experts believed that the interlocutory appeal could end the litigation due to the Supreme Court's already-expressed skepticism. Other experts, such as the director of Columbia University's climate change center, noted that any decision in favor of the plaintiffs likely would be reversed by the Supreme Court, which has been reluctant to declare new rights and which unanimously held in American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut that it was not for the courts to decide appropriate levels of pollution. On January 17, 2020, on a 2-1 vote, the Ninth Circuit panel dismissed the case for lack of Article III standing. Writing for the majority, Judge Hurwitz wrote that \\"it is beyond the power of an Article III court to order, design, supervise, or implement the plaintiffs' requested remedial plan. As the opinions of their experts make plain, any effective plan would necessarily require a host of complex policy decisions entrusted, for better or worse, to the wisdom and discretion of the executive and legislative branches.\\" In dissent, Judge Staton stated, \\"Seeking to quash this suit, the government bluntly insists that it has the absolute and unreviewable power to destroy the Nation. My colleagues throw up their hands. . . . No case can singlehandedly prevent the catastrophic effects of climate change predicted by the government and scientists . . . [but] the mere fact that this suit cannot alone halt climate change does not mean that it presents no claim suitable for judicial resolution.\\" Lawyers for the plaintiffs stated their intent to appeal this dismissal to the full Ninth Circuit sitting en banc.

As a result, New York City has the second- highest rents of any city in the United States. Shortage has long been usual. According to the Plan for New York City of 1969, \\"It is obvious that a great deal is wrong. The air is polluted. The streets are dirty and choked. The subways are jammed. The waters of the rivers and bays are fouled. There is a severe shortage of housing.\\" Since the middle 1990s construction has greatly increased in the city. Between 2009 and 2018, according to the New York City Comptroller, New York gained 500,000 new residents, but built only 100,000 new housing units. Mayor Bill de Blasio has described the affordability of housing as \\"the biggest crisis facing our city\\".  Supply factors  There was a 19 percent increase in the number of housing units between 1970 and 2016, although growth in new construction slowed after 2000 from over 7 percent to 5.3 percent. Newly-constructed housing units are renting for $400 a month over existing units in 2018, which is eight times the difference between new and existing units that existed in 2000.Purnima Kapur, Executive Director, NYC Dept. of City Planning, Michelle De La Uz, Commissioner, NYC City Planning Commission, and Rachel Fee, Executive Director, New York Housing Conference moderated by Brian Lehrer (May 30, 2018) Brian talks New York - The Housing Squeeze by Numbers (video) The privately-funded new construction has not been focused on families with the greatest need. A large percentage of new construction has been studio and one bedroom apartments and there is a great need for larger units to service families. On top of the 19 percent increase in new housing units, hundreds of thousands of rent regulated units have been lost. The units lost were those the lowest-income families in New York City would find affordable. Looking back over history, New York has always had an affordability crisis with a 5 percent vacancy rate. This is the reason the government has traditionally stepped in to subsidize housing. There is a 2 percent vacancy rate in rent stabilized units. So the affordability crisis is how the city can build and preserve housing units that serve low and moderate- income households. = Vacant units = In 2014, there were 182,600 vacant units unavailable for rent or sale. A large majority of these units were either bought for investment or used only occasionally by owners who live elsewhere while others are used as illicit short-term rentals. In two years this number had increased to 248,000 units and represented 8 percent of the city's housing stock.  Demand factors  Between 2000 and 2012, the median rent of an apartment increased 75 percent in New York City compared to 44 percent for the rest of the United States. The increase impacted the poor and working class most. There was a loss of 400,000 apartments renting for $1,000 a month or less (constant 2012 dollars) and a resulting gain of apartments renting over this. This was not a small shift but saw 240,000 units renting for $601‚Äì800 disappear and apartments renting for $1,201-1,600 having the highest gains. Median rent in constant dollars increased from $839 in 2000 to $1,100 in 2012. Partially offsetting the growth in housing units was an increase in population to 8.6 million people. All boroughs, including the Bronx, are close to all-time population highs as of 2018. Factors include an increase in employment to 4.5 million jobs and a trend of decreasing crime.  Impact of affordable housing shortage = Overcrowding = Almost 1.5 million people live in overcrowded conditions in New York City. Overall crowding rose from 7.6 percent in 2005 to 8.8 percent in 2013 (a 15.8 percent increase). Overcrowding is not limited to low-income households, but is found at all income levels.NYC Housing Brief - Hidden Households (October 2015) Office of the New York City Comptroller, Scott M. Stringer The California Health and Human Services Agency defines \\"severe overcrowding\\" as more than 1.5 persons per room.https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/housing-crowding The severe overcrowding rate in the nation is 0.99 percent and is 3.33 percent in New York City. = Homelessness = In 2018 there were 63,495 homeless in New York City, including over 23,600 children. Total homelessness in the city had increased by 82 percent over the last decade.State of the Homeless 2018 Coalition for the Homeless According to an agency funded by the New York State Education Department, there were 104,088 students (1 in 10) living in temporary shelters and identified as homeless in the city's school system for the period 2016-2017.Recommendations for improving school access and success for rising numbers of students in temporary housing (March 2018) Advocates for Children of New York(April 5, 2017) CUNY Forum - Homelessness in New York: Crisis and Policy (video) cunytv75 There is a huge cost to the city to provide for the homeless. Following a 1981 consent decree arising from Callahan v. Carey, the city is required by law to provide shelter to any eligible person who asks for it. To shelter one family in one of the 167 family shelters costs $34,573 a year. $1.04 billion was budgeted for 2014 to provide homeless services, up from $535.8 million in 2002.  Government initiatives  The city has had many periods of housing shortages in its history. Following a housing crisis in the 1920s, 700,000 units were built but in the 1930s people were again talking about a crisis. Mayors Fiorello H. La Guardia and William O'Dwyer dealt with slum clearance and building public housing. Rent control in New York, having begun as part of price controls on the United States home front during World War II, continued after the war. Robert F. Wagner Jr. and John Lindsay oversaw the Mitchell-Lama Housing Program. Ed Koch was mayor during a wave of housing abandonment which had to be addressed. This continued under David Dinkins and Rudy Giuliani.The Growing Gap: New York City‚Äôs Housing Affordability Challenge (2014) Office of the New York City Comptroller, Scott M. Stringer Homelessness of individuals and families became a major issue during the 1980s and 1990s. Mayor Bloomberg's term in office saw an economically resurgent city. During this period, rents in New York City rose more than 15 percent over the increase in the country as a whole. His New Housing Marketplace Plan pledged to create 165,000 units of affordable housing between 2002-2014, of which 53,000 would be new units and 112,000 preserved units. The cost for this program was $23.6 billion, of which $5.3 billion was public funds leveraging $18.3 billion in private funds. In 2016, Mayor Bill de Blasio promised an even more aggressive plan to build and preserve 200,000 housing units over ten-years and he introduced mandatory-inclusionary zoning requiring 30 percent of all new construction units to be affordable. The goals of the initiative, which was called Housing New York, were later increased to 300,000 affordable housing units by 2026.

It was built from 1924 to 1925 by Concrete Constructions Limited. It is also known as Old Sydney Holiday Inn and Old Sydney Park Royal Hotel. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The site is part of original grants to John Laurie in October 1816 and Robert Campbell in October 1834. Approval for the seven-storey Harrington's Building was sought from Sydney City Council on 17 May 1923 by the contractors, Concrete Constructions Pty Ltd. The building of reinforced concrete frame and brick cladding was completed in 1926. The site had formerly been occupied by several buildings: * In 1848 George Atherden, Robert Campbell's overseer, built three three-storey houses and shops at 53 - 55 George Street. They were constructed with brick walls and shingled rooves with a semi detached kitchen to the rear and were demolished between 1914 and 1916. * The land at 2-8 Playfair Street was part of lots 8 - 13 of William Whaley Billyard's subdivision and in 1875 the lots were conveyed to Thomas Playfair, James Rogers and Alfred Augustus. These lots were resumed by the Government in March 1901 under the Observatory Hill Resumption Act of 1900. In 1914 the tenements and stables were demolished the continuation of Playfair Street to George Street. The owner of the new building were Harrington Ltd, metallurgists. Founded in 1906 by John and Thomas Harrington, the company was first involved in gold in Western Australia then in silver residue technology connected with the photographic industry. The company was operating from 525 Kent Street in 1906 and by 1909 had moved to 386 George Street. In 1919 it was operating from main office and laboratory at 386 George Street with stores at 57 - 59 George Street North, adjacent to the site of the 1923 building. Photos of the interior of the laboratories are in the possession of John Cooke Jnr whose father took over the running of the company in 1945, a few years before the death of the last Harrington brother. Harringtons Ltd merged in the 1990s with another company and is now known as Golden West. To the north was a stone store, built in 1844 by Martyn and Coombes later used as the Catholic Mission for seamen and demolished in 1920 to make way for the widened Playfair Street to connect to George Street. To the south a series of three stores were built between 1895 and 1918. At least one of these was occupied by Harringtons Ltd (from 1914). The words \\"Harringtons Buildings\\" were prominently displayed. The store at 63 - 65 George Street and a large part of 57 - 59 George Street were demolished in 1952/3 after damage by fire. The remainder of these buildings were demolished to make way for extensions to the Old Sydney Inn (now the Park Royal) in 1980 into which the Harringtons Building at 53 - 55 George Street was incorporated.Duyker, S., 1999SCRA, 1979: KL/14 Work on the conversion of the L shaped Harrington's Buildings and its incorporation into a 180-room hotel, with the whole enclosing a roofed court of atrium, started in 1981.

Biography Bertin was born in Louisbourg, √éle-Royale (modern Cape Breton), in 1752 to Louis Bertin, a surgeon, and Marie-Anne Bertrand. Following France's loss of Louisbourg to the English, the Bertin family removed to Rochefort, France. As an adult, Bertin served as a senior civil servant in the Ministry of the Navy, which was charged with overseeing mercantile shipping, naval operations, and overseas colonies. Around 1792, Bertin served as a commissaire-ordonnateur for French naval forces in the Mediterranean, notably in 1793 aboard the Tonnant. By 1798, he had risen to the chief civilian officer for the Port of Bordeaux, before being transferred on July 12, 1798, to the Port of Toulon. Bertin next served as the first maritime prefect for Le Havre from July 1800 to May 1801. At the port, he focused on construction of the bassin de la Barre, a system of locks to ease movement between the outer harbor and the bassin des Capucins, employing some 250 diggers and 60 stonecutters to complete the work. In September 1801, Bertin was promoted to counselor of the state for the navy, and was replaced as maritime prefect by Bourdon de Vatry. In Martinique Waterfall in the jardin botanique de Saint-Pierre, Martinique In 1802, with the signing of the Treaty of Amiens, Martinique and St. Lucia were restored to France after six years of British control. Bertin, in May 1802, was named the first colonial prefect of the colony, arriving in Martinique on 18 Messidor X (July 7, 1802). Bertin shared control of the island with Rear Admiral Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse as captain general and Le sieur Lefessier-Grandpr√© as grand judge. Bertin reported that the inhabitants of Martinique were happy to be once again under French rule, as he moved to establish hospitals and barracks and to refurbish military batteries and fortifications. Bertin also stressed the need to resume trade with Metropolitan France. In February 1803, Bertin ordered work to begin on the creation of the Jardin colonial des Plantes de Saint- Pierre. In 1803, France once again declared war on England. Bertin sought support for the island from the United States by opening the ports of Martinique to neutral ships, but this proved ineffective in the face of the British maritime blockade. In 1804, Bertin was replaced by Pierre-Cl√©ment de Laussat, who had lost his position as colonial prefect of Louisiana following the sale of the territory to the United States. Bertin retired to France and to private life. Legacy in Saint-Pierre bears his name.

Background  Ravi was born in Singapore in 1969 to parents of Tamil descent. After graduating with a bachelor's degree in sociology and political science from the National University of Singapore, he went on to read law at Cardiff University and obtained a Bachelor of Laws.  Career = Legal career = Ravi defended the accused in high-profile death penalty cases such as Public Prosecutor v Shanmugam s/o Murugesu (2004), Public Prosecutor v Iwuchukwu Amara Tochi and Another (2006) and Yong Vui Kong v Public Prosecutor (2009-2015), the latter which flagged out other legal issues concerning human rights, which included the constitutionality of corporal caning, as well as the reviewability of the clemency process and exercise of prosecutorial discretion. As a lawyer, he is known for his discursive courtroom style. He has also argued other landmark human rights cases such as Shadrake v Attorney-General (2011) on freedom of expression and contempt of court, Tan Eng Hong v Attorney-General (2012) on gay rights and decriminalisation of homosexuality, and Vellama d/o Marie Muthu v. Attorney- General (2013) on voting rights, amongst others. In 2015, he defended Roy Ngerng in a defamation lawsuit initiated by Lee Hsien Loong, the Prime Minister of Singapore. Ravi acted for John Tan, Vice-President of the Singapore Democratic Party, in an application for a declaration that his contempt of court conviction did not disqualify him from standing for elections. He is also acting for 8 bus drivers from SBS Transit against the public transport operator over breach of employment terms relating to wages. He is also defending Daniel de Costa, who is accused of defaming members of the Cabinet of Singapore in an article published on The Online Citizen. Significantly, Ravi is now instructed by at least 12 inmates on death-row whose clemency petitions had been rejected, among which includes Norasharee Gous and Gobi Avedian, who were the second and third cases which the Court of Appeal had agreed to reopen and review in Singapore's legal history. = Political career = In 2015, Ravi led the Reform Party (RP) team in Ang Mo Kio Group Representation Constituency (GRC) in the 2015 General Election. His team lost to the People's Action Party, garnering only 21.4% of votes.  Controversies = 2015 suspension = In 2015, the Law Society issued a direction to Ravi to temporarily cease his legal practice. In response, Ravi and three companions appeared at the Law Society's premises, where he made inappropriate statements and acted in an unruly manner, which were recorded in a video clip that was later published on social media. The direction was based on the Law Society's concerns that the state of Ravi's mental condition impaired his fitness to practise law. The Court of Appeal then affirmed that decision and ordered Ravi be prohibited from applying for a practising certificate for a period of two years and to continue to seek medical help. = 2018 assault incident = In 2018, Ravi was sentenced to an 18-month mandatory treatment order after assaulting Jeannette Chong-Aruldoss, a fellow lawyer and opposition politician. Ravi, who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2006, had to undergo treatment to address his mental condition, in lieu of jail time.

It was developed by Westone and published by Sega for the Sega Saturn. It was never released outside of Japan.  Plot  Many tactical role playing games were set in medieval settings, while Wachenr√∂der is instead set in the Victorian era. The setting has been described as \\"steampunk\\". The story takes place in a dark future on the island Edward, which is ruled by the noble and magnanimous King Wizar (who is imprisoned by the evil prime minister Vlad at the time which the game begins). In this alternate history, steam power is very sophisticated and the people hold it dear: vehicles, gadgetry or weapons are driven by vapor in place of electricity. This links Wachenr√∂der, based on its contents and its overall design, to the steampunk genre. Since the building of several wastewater treatment plants for the rich upper class, the citizens of Edoalds suffer more and more from diseases caused by hazardous waste and contaminated drinking water. The gamer assumes the role of Lucian Taylor, who is in search of Imperator Duran, to avenge the illness-caused death of his younger sister, which he holds him responsible for.  Gameplay  Most of the game is presented in an isometric perspective, similar to the genrelike games Shining Force, Vandal Hearts, Front Mission or Final Fantasy Tactics, and consists of several turn-based fights separated by cutscenes. Some cutscenes are preceded by the playable character Bellebete narrating the story. The stages consist of 3D maps, which can be turned in all directions, as well as zoomed in to get a closer look at the gameplay. Combat in the game consists of turn based battles. The story advances through use of pre-rendered computer generated movies.  Development  Many of the game's artists were recruited from the anime industry. Anime and manga artist Range Murata was an artist for the game. Artist Takeyuki Takeya worked on Iria: Zeiram The Animation. Katsumi Yokota worked on character designs for the game. He also worked on Panzer Dragoon Saga, and Front Mission Alternative. The game uses the same game engine as Shining Force III. The game was previewed at the 1998 Tokyo Game Show. The game was developed at a time when there was growing interest in the simulation RPG genre for four years in Japan. Musician Ian McDonald (a member of Foreigner and King Crimson), contributed two tracks to the game's musical score. This is part of a larger trend in the late 1990s, where established musicians compose music for video games. Other examples Stewart Copeland composing the music for the Spyro the Dragon games, and Ronnie Montrose composing the music for Mr. Bones. The Wiener Werkst√§tte logo is printed on the game's cover, the CD-ROM, and used in the actual game itself.  Release  The game was released in Japan on August 6, 1998 for the Sega Saturn, and published by Sega. The game received a television commercial featuring the character Segata Sanshiro. The little artbook that comes packed with the game, begins with a longer German text that tells the background story in lyric poetry. The game's soundtrack, Wachenr√∂der Original Game Soundtrack, was published by Marvelous Entertainment. The game received previews in various magazines in Europe and North America, however it was never released outside of Japan.  Reception  Weekly Famitsu gave the game a score of 29 out of 40. Reviewers compared the presentation and graphics to Final Fantasy Tactics. Three reviewers for the Japanese Sega Saturn Magazine gave the game scores of 7, 6, and 8 respectively. Gamers' Republic gave the game a B-, while praising the artwork and music, but were highly critical of the gameplay and graphics. The reviewer instead recommended Shining Force III: Scenario 2 as a better import title to play. In a separate review for the game's soundtrack, Gamers' Republic gave the score a B and recommended the music for fans of rpg music. In 2001, IGN writer David Smith listed the game as the second most wished game he would like to see ported to the PlayStation. He praised the artwork of the game saying \\"the character design and world art have a wonderfully grim, clammy, sepia-toned neo-Victorian sort of quality to them.\\"  References  1998 in video gaming Tactical role- playing video games Japan-exclusive video games Sega Saturn games Sega Saturn-only games Video games developed in Japan Video games scored by Satoshi Miyashita Video games scored by Takayuki Negishi ","title":"Wachenr√∂der"},{"id":"59040438","text":"Moilang or Moirang (modern term) is one of the Seven clans of Meetei.

Following his probationary period, he was sent to study at Georgetown College. On July 4, 1843, he was ordained a priest by Archbishop Samuel Eccleston of Baltimore at Holy Trinity Church in the Georgetown section of Washington, D.C. He was made the pastor of St. Francis Xavier Church in Baltimore in 1845, where he remained until 1846. Following his pastorate, Blox was appointed the superior of St. Xavier College in Cincinnati (now Xavier University), a position he held for one year. On October 2, 1848, Washington Seminary (later known as Gonzaga College High School) in Washington, D.C. resumed official operations after having been suppressed by the Catholic hierarchy. Blox was appointed its fourth president, and the first following its reopening, succeeding William Matthews. Immediately upon its reopening, the school saw a resurgence in the number of students seeking to enroll. On May 14, 1851, Blox delivered the eulogy of Archbishop Eccleston at the requiem mass at St. Patrick's Church. His term as president came to an end on August 15, 1851, when he was succeeded by Fr. Samuel Barber, S.J. In 1854, Blox was appointed the pastor of St. Mary's Church in Alexandria, Virginia. In 1856, he directed the expansion of the church by adding a new altar, tabernacle, organ, and stained glass windows, and a large bell. He also oversaw the addition of the tallest belfry in Alexandria and the extension of the church by twenty feet. During his pastorate, Blox was responsible for a number of conversions to Catholicism, including George William Brent and fourteen others. Blox was transferred to Philadelphia in 1857. There, he was made the spiritual director of the sodality of the Blessed Virgin Mary at St. John the Evangelist Church. Blox died in Philadelphia on April 27, 1860.

However, despite this mission, The Family Shakespeare is most often cited in modern times as a negative example of literary censorship, despite its original family-friendly intentions. The Bowdler name is also the origin of the term \\"bowdlerise\\", meaning to omit parts of a work on moral grounds. The first edition of The Family Shakespeare was published in 1807 in four duodecimo volumes, covering 20 plays. In 1818 a second edition was published, containing all 36 available plays in 10 volumes.  Precedents  The Bowdlers were not the first to undertake such a project, but their commitment to not augmenting or adding to Shakespeare's text, instead only removing sensitive material while striving to make as little of an impact as possible on the overall narrative of the play, differentiated The Family Shakespeare from the works of earlier editors. A Folger collection second folio (1632) went under the pen of a censor for the Holy Office in Spain, Guillermo Sanchez, who, similar to the Bowdlers, focused on redacting sensitive material; however, unlike the Bowdlers, he blacked out and redacted large swaths of Shakespeare's verses with little care for maintaining the integrity of the works, even going so far as to cut Measure for Measure out entirely. Others took more creative liberty in sanitising the Bard's works: In 1681, Nahum Tate as Poet Laureate rewrote the tragedy of King Lear with a happy ending. In 1807, Charles Lamb and Mary Lamb published a children's edition of the bard's work, Tales from Shakespeare, that had synopses of 20 plays but seldom quoted the original text.  Motivation  As stated in the preface to the first edition, when the Bowdlers were children their father often entertained the family with readings from Shakespeare. They later realised that their father had been omitting or altering passages he felt unsuitable for the ears of his wife and children: > In the perfection of reading few men were equal to my father; and such was > his good taste, his delicacy, and his prompt discretion, that his family > listened with delight to Lear, Hamlet, and Othello, without knowing that > those matchless tragedies contained words and expressions improper to be > pronounced; and without reason to suspect that any parts of the plays had > been omitted by the circumspect and judicious reader. The Bowdlers took inspiration from their father's editing, feeling that it would be worthwhile to publish an edition which might be used in a family whose father was not a sufficiently \\"circumspect and judicious reader\\" to accomplish this expurgation himself, while still remaining as true to the original text as possible.  Harriet Bowdler and the first edition  Despite the fact that Thomas' name was ultimately the sole listed author on all later editions, the 1807 first edition (which appeared anonymously) was in fact largely the work of his sister, Harriet. This omission of authorship was likely because a woman could not then publicly admit that she was capable of such editing and compilation, much less that she understood Shakespeare's racy verses. It took nearly two centuries for Harriet to receive due credit for her work. Harriet's first edition, containing 20 edited plays, was published at Bath in four small duodecimo volumes. In the preface, Harriet describes her editorial goal as to endeavor \\"to remove every thing that could give just offence to the religious and virtuous mind\\", and to omit \\"many speeches in which Shakespeare has been tempted to 'purchase laughter at the price of decency.'\\" In this manner, she says, she will produce a publication that can \\"be placed in the hands of young persons of both sexes\\". However, in Harriet's edition she occasionally went beyond this \\"religious and virtuous\\" mission: in addition to the primary excisions of sexual material or Roman Catholic references that might prove unfavorable for good Protestants, Harriet also edited out scenes that she felt were trivial or uninteresting. These excisions amounted to approximately 10% of the original text. The edition was not particularly successful.  Thomas Bowdler takes over  After the first edition, Thomas Bowdler managed to negotiate for the publication of a new version of The Family Shakespeare. He took over from his sister and expanded the expurgations to the 16 remaining plays not covered by the first, on top of re-editing the 20 plays of the previous edition. Excluded from this completed edition was Pericles, Prince of Tyre, perhaps due to the contention over its authorship or its virtual disappearance until 1854. Thomas defended his expurgations on the title page, re-titling the work The Family Shakspeare: In which nothing is added to the original text, but those words and expressions are omitted which cannot with propriety be read in a family. With this mission, Thomas Bowdler aimed to produce an edition of the works of \\"our immoral Bard\\", as Bowdler calls Shakespeare in the preface to the second edition, that would be appropriate for all ages, not to mention genders. In addition to the reworkings and a new preface, Thomas also included introductory notes for a few of the plays‚ÄîHenry IV, Othello, and Measure for Measure‚Äîto describe the advanced difficulty associated with editing them. The spelling \\"Shakspeare\\", used by Thomas Bowdler in the second edition but not by Harriet in the first, was changed in later editions (from 1847 on) to \\"Shakespeare\\", reflecting changes in the standard spelling of Shakespeare's name.  Contents = First edition (1807) = The 20 plays of the first edition, selected, edited, and compiled in 4 volumes largely by Harriet Bowdler, occur in the order below: The Tempest; A Midsummer Night's Dream; Much Ado About Nothing; As You Like It; The Merchant of Venice; Twelfth Night; The Winter's Tale; King John; Richard II; Henry IV, Part 1; Henry IV, Part 2; Henry V ; Richard III; Henry VIII; Julius Caesar; Macbeth; Cymbeline; King Lear; Hamlet; Othello. = Complete second edition (1818) = This edition, commandeered by Thomas rather than his sister, contained all 36 available plays in 10 volumes. Beyond adding 16 new plays, Thomas also re-edited the 20 plays previously expurgated by his sister, and reinserted the scenes that she had removed not for their inappropriate content but because she considered them trivial or uninteresting. Not included is Pericles, Prince of Tyre, perhaps due to the contention over its authorship or its virtual disappearance until 1854. The 36 plays of the second edition occur in the order below. New plays that did not previously appear in the 1807 first edition are marked with an asterisk: The Tempest; The Two Gentlemen of Verona *; The Merry Wives of Windsor *; Twelfth Night; Measure For Measure *; Much Ado About Nothing; A Midsummer Night's Dream; Love's Labour's Lost *; The Merchant of Venice; As You Like It; All's Well That Ends Well *; The Taming of the Shrew *; The Winter's Tale; The Comedy of Errors *; Macbeth; King John; Richard II; Henry IV, Part 1; Henry IV, Part 2; Henry V; Henry VI, Part 1 *; Henry VI, Part 2 *; Henry VI, Part 3 *; Richard III; Henry VIII; Troilus and Cressida *; Timon of Athens *; Coriolanus *; Julius Caesar; Antony and Cleopatra *; Cymbeline; Titus Andronicus *; King Lear; Romeo and Juliet *; Hamlet; Othello.  Examples of Bowdler's edits  Some examples of alterations made by Thomas Bowdler within his 1818 complete edition of The Family Shakespeare are listed below, along with Bowdler's reasoning where a preface to the play is available. = Othello = In his preface to Othello, Bowdler commends the tragedy as \\"one of the noblest efforts of dramatic genius that has appeared in any age or in any language\\"; however, \\"the subject is unfortunately little suited to family reading.\\" He concedes the difficulty of adapting Othello for a family audience due to \\"the arguments which are urged\\" and themes of adultery, which are so intrinsic to the play itself that they cannot be removed without fundamentally changing the characters or plot and, \\"in fact, destroying the tragedy\\". He ultimately comes to the conclusion that perhaps the dire anti-adultery warnings of the play are worth the raciness of some, but not all, of the passages, deciding to strive to maintain the moral message of the play instead of expurgating everything for the sake of family friendliness. Indeed, at the conclusion of the preface, Bowdler recommends that \\"if, after all that I have omitted, it shall still be thought that this inimitable tragedy is not sufficiently correct for family reading, I would advise the transferring it from the parlour to the cabinet, where the perusal will not only delight the poetic taste, but convey useful and important instruction both to the heart and the understanding of the reader.\\" Original: \\"Even now, now, very now, an old black ram Is tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise!\\" ‚Äì (Iago, I.1.94-95) Bowdlerised: OMITTED Original: \\"I am one, sir, that comes to tell you, your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.\\" ‚Äì (Iago, I.1.121) Bowdlerised: \\"Your daughter and the Moor are now together.\\" = Measure for Measure = For the play's first Family Shakespeare appearance in the 1818 second edition, the entry is actually a reprint of John Philip Kemble's amended edition of Measure for Measure. Kemble had edited the comedy for performance at the Theatre Royal in Covent Garden around 1803. As stated by Bowdler in the 1818 preface to Measure for Measure, he chose to use the Kemble text over creating his own version, for the play proved too difficult to expurgate without fundamentally changing it in some way. Bowdler soon rose to the challenge, though, and the next edition (1820) saw the publication of his own fully revised version. Bowdler lauds this comedy as \\"contain[ing] scenes which are truly of the first of dramatic poets\\", but also suggests that the story, with its wealth of \\"wickedness\\", is \\"little suited to a comedy\\". He bemoans the boldness with which characters commit these \\"crimes\\" and the fact that they suffer no punishment for their doings; rather, states Bowdler, the women of the story gravitate to the men who have been, as they describe it, \\"a little bad\\". Aside from this romanticising of immorality, Bowdler also bemoans the issue that \\"the indecent expressions with which many of the scenes abound, are so interwoven with the story, that it is extremely difficult to separate the one from the other\\", quite similar to his issues with editing Othello. = Romeo and Juliet = Bowdler does not include a preface to Romeo and Juliet, but in general the targets of the expurgations are innuendos: Original: \\"the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon.\\" ‚Äì (Mercutio, II.4.61) Bowdlerised: \\"the hand of the dial is now upon the point of noon.\\" Original: \\"Tis true, and therefore women being the weaker vessel are ever thrust to the wall . . .\\" ‚Äì (Sampson, I.1.13) Bowdlerised: OMITTED Original: \\"not ope her legs to saint- seducing gold\\" ‚Äì (Romeo, I.1.206) Bowdlerised: OMITTED Original: \\"Spread thy close curtain, love performing night\\" ‚Äì (Juliet, III.2.5) Bowdlerised: \\"... and come civil night\\" = Titus Andronicus = Titus also lacks an introductory essay, but innuendos are once again the main excision. Bowdler removes some of the allusions to rape throughout the play, but does not entirely remove the many mentions and suggestions of the act. Original: \\"Villain, I have done thy mother.\\" ‚Äì (Aaron, IV.2.76) Bowdlerised: OMITTED Original: \\"There speak and strike, brave boys, and take your turns, There serve your lust, shadow'd from heaven's eye, And revel in Lavinia's treasury.\\" ‚Äì (Aaron, II.1.130-132) Bowdlerised: \\"There speak, and strike, shadow'd from heaven's eye, And revel with Lavinia.\\" = Macbeth = Prominent modern literary figures such as Michiko Kakutani (in the New York Times) and William Safire (in his book, How Not to Write) have accused Bowdler of changing Lady Macbeth's famous \\"Out, damned spot!\\" line in Macbeth (V.1.38) to \\"Out, crimson spot!\\"Michiko Kakutani, Light Out, Huck, They Still Want to Sivilize You, N.Y. Times, Jan. 7, 2011, at C1 & 5 (only the original print version still contains Kakutani's accusation -- the online version has been corrected)William Safire, How Not to Write (1990; 2005 printing), page 100 But Bowdler did not do that. Thomas Bulfinch and Stephen Bulfinch did, in their 1865 edition of Shakespeare's works. Bowdler's actual edits serve to remove instances of blasphemy, overtly-violent lines, and sexual innuendo. = Hamlet = In Bowdler's Hamlet the excisions are primarily on the grounds of blasphemy, removing all exclamations and curses that are religious in nature. There are also the usual redactions of sexual remarks and innuendos. Original: \\"For God's love, let me hear.\\" ‚Äì (Hamlet, I.2.195) Bowdlerised: \\"For Heaven's love, let me hear.\\" Original: \\"To those of mine! But virtue, as it never will be mov'd, Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven; So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd Will sate itself in a celestial bed, And prey on garbage. But soft!\\" ‚Äì (Ghost, I.5.52-58) Bowdlerised: \\"To those of mine But soft!\\"  Initial reception  The release of Harriet's first edition of The Family Shakespeare passed rather innocuously, not attracting much attention. There were three reviews: one in favor, complementing the tastefulness of such a \\"castrated\\" version; one against, decrying the edits as wholly unnecessary; and a third, in which the reviewer suggested that the only satisfactory edition of Shakespeare would be a folio of blank pages. At first, Thomas Bowdler's new and complete second edition seemed to be on the same track. However, between 1821 and 1822 The Family Shakespeare found itself in the middle of a dispute between Blackwood's Magazine and the Edinburgh Review, the leading literary journals at the time. While Blackwood's scorned Bowdler's work as \\"prudery in pasteboard\\", the Edinburgh commended his expurgations as saving readers from \\"awkwardness\\" and \\"distress\\". It appears that the public sided with the Edinburgh. With this free publicity via controversy interest in the book spiked and sales of The Family Shakespeare soared, with new editions consistently published every few years through the 1880s. In 1894 the poet Algernon Charles Swinburne declared that \\"More nauseous and more foolish cant was never chattered than that which would deride the memory or depreciate the merits of Bowdler. No man ever did better service to Shakespeare than the man who made it possible to put him into the hands of intelligent and imaginative children.\\" Indeed, this favorable opinion of Bowdler's expurgations was the conventional view at the time, as reflected by the increasing popularity and immense success of expurgated or Bowdlerized works: in 1850 there were 7 rival expurgated Shakespeares, and by 1900 there were almost 50.  Downfall and legacy  The Bowdler name took on a life of its own soon after the publication of the 1818 second edition: by the mid 1820s, around the time of Thomas Bowdler's death, it had already become a verb, \\"to bowdlerize\\", meaning to remove sensitive or inappropriate material from a text. However, at this time it was not yet a byword for literary censorship; rather, it was more of a genre of books edited to be appropriate for young readers or for families, and a very popular and successful genre at that. The tides began to change for the Bowdler name in 1916, when the writer Richard Whiteing decried the sanitized edition in an article for The English Review entitled \\"Bowdler Bowdlerised\\". In the scathing and oft-sarcastic piece, Whiteing utterly denounces Bowdler and his expurgations, calling the changes \\"inconsistent\\" and scorning the prefaces to the more difficult-to-edit plays as \\"mealy-mouthed attempts to right himself\\". The inconsistencies in what Bowdler changed versus what remained deeply perturbed Whiteing, who declares that \\"There is no end to it, except the in the limits of human patience.\\" He continues to liken Bowdler's perceived editorial tactlessness to \\"a baby playing with a pair of shears\\". Whiteing argues that children should not be protected from the scandal of Shakespeare; no, they must be taught how to meet these facts of life. He concludes his heated review with a warning, that Bowdlerization could easily become overzealous and create an even larger Index of banned literature than that of the Catholic Church at its prime, and a question: \\"Should there be any age of innocence?\\" It appears that the public was wont to agree with this strongly worded viewpoint. Public favor turned against Bowdlerized editions of books and expurgation for the sake of \\"appropriateness\\", and The Family Shakespeare began to be cited as an example of negative literary censorship. The word \\"bowdlerize\\" lost its family-friendly connotations and instead became a term of derision. This phenomenon is outlined in a piece in The Nation, written shortly after and in reaction to Whiteing's harsh commentary. Taking a much more moderate stance than Whiteing, the opinion of whom The National describes as \\"flagrant exaggeration\\", they instead suggest that The Family Shakespeare is a relic of a bygone, pre-Victorian time, and that \\"As public taste moved on towards broader standards of literary propriety, the verb 'to bowdlerize' suffered corresponding degradation.\\" Nonetheless, they acknowledge that public opinion of Bowdler and bowdlerization as a practice is perhaps best represented Whiteing's strong views. By 1925 The Family Shakespeare was all but obsolete. In 1969 Noel Perrin published Dr. Bowdler's Legacy: A History of Expurgated Books in England and America. Perrin attributes the fall of bowdlerization and literary expurgation to the rise of Freudian psychology, feminism, and the influence of mass media. Perrin also cites Whiteing's statements as a harbinger of doom for Bowdler's popular status. On Bowdler's birthday each year (July 11), some literature fans and librarians \\"celebrate\\" Bowdler's \\"meddlings\\" on \\"Bowdler's Day\\". The \\"celebration\\" is ironic, scorning Bowdler as a literary censor and perpetuating the views that Whiteing served to popularize. Editions of The Family Shakespeare continue to be published, printed, and read today, largely to observe what exactly Bowdler removed and why.

He was also the member of Parliament for Farrer Park Single Member Constituency (SMC) from 1968 to 1980, Tanah Merah SMC from 1980 to 1984.  Education and early career  Lee studied in Catholic High School and Chung Cheng High School. He went on to study at the University of Malaya in 1960 and obtained his bachelor's degree in engineering. Until 1961, Lee was working in the Public Works Department as an engineer before he went to University of London and obtained a doctorate in engineering in 1965. After his return to Singapore, Lee joined Singapore Polytechnic as a lecturer in civil engineering.  Political career  Lee contested the Farrer Park SMC in the 1968 Singapore general election. He defeated independent candidate, M. P. D. Nair, by 7,826 votes (84.91%) to 1,391 (15.09%). Lee continued to contest Farrer Park SMC in 1972 elections, winning with 8,521 votes (73.8%), defeating J. B. Jeyaretnam of the Workers' Party 2,668 votes (23.1%) and independent candidate S. A. Latiff 354 votes (3.1%).

It was designed by John Bibb and built from 1841 to 1842. It is also known as Union Bond Store (former) and Westpac Bank. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The story of European occupation in the vicinity of the subject property began with the lease of land on the western foreshores of Sydney Cove to Captain Henry Waterhouse c. 1799. Charles Grimes's Plan of Sydney, prepared in 1800, shows three parcels of land held by Waterhouse on the foreshore near present-day Campbell's Cove. The alignment of George Street appears to have run between these parcels of land. It appears that Waterhouse only held his leaseholds at The Rocks for one year, and does not appear to have built on them during his tenure. =Occupation by Robert Campbell= Land on the western side of George Street (between Argyle and Cumberland Streets) was from 1800 occupied by Robert Campbell, one of Sydney's most prominent merchants in the first decades of European settlement. He acquired Captain Waterhouse's leases in The Rocks soon after Waterhouse's return to England in 1800. The 1807 James Meehan's Plan of the Town of Sydney shows two leaseholds occupied by Campbell on the western foreshores of Sydney Cove. Lot 1 is the large rectangular parcel of land on the western side of George Street (and may also include land to the north, on the waterfront), while Lot 2 is a small square directly addressing the waterfront in the vicinity of today's Campbell's Cove. Campbell was officially granted this land (the Lot 2) in 1814. The Lot 1, on the western side of George Street, was officially granted to Campbell on 16 October 1834 by Governor Richard Bourke. This land was divided into four allotments. Allotment 1 comprised 3 rods and 34 perches. A plan of The Rocks dated to 1835 does not show this land grant, only the extent of Campbell's earlier grant on the western foreshores of Sydney Cove is marked on this plan. In the early 1840s, Campbell set about subdividing his land holdings in The Rocks, particularly the land from the 1834 grant that was set back from the wharves and therefore less useful to his mercantile enterprises. On a personal note, Campbell was spending less time in Sydney following the death of his wife in 1833, and was increasingly living at his property Duntroon, near Canberra. In 1841, Allotment 1 of Campbell's grant on the western side of George Street was subdivided into six lots. The subject property is located on Lot 4 of this subdivision. On 2 July 1841, Lots 3 and 4 from Allotment 1 of Campbell's 1834 grant were purchased by John Martyn and James Combes. The Union Bond Store at 47 George Street, The Rocks, was built in -43 on Lot 4, at the same time as a matching three-storey warehouse on the opposite corner (on the southern side of Union Street) on Lot 5. Both warehouses were built for John Martyn and James Combes to a design by architect John Bibb. A plan at the Mitchell Library dated to June 1841 shows the street and side elevations of a warehouse building designed by John Bibb for Martyn & Combes, ideally symmetrical to the existing subject property. Bibb is also speculated to be the architect for Merchants House at 43 George Street, to the north of the subject property (built in 1848). John Martyn and James Combes were brothers-in-law and business partners. They traded as Martyn & Combes, a \\"plumbing, painting and glazing business\\", but as the nineteenth century progressed, their business interests diversified, and they became known as merchants. By 1848, they were operating from a building on the junction of Jamison and George Streets, near Wynyard, possibly used as a warehouse / office. In 1847, Lot 5 of Allotment 1 of Campbell's grant (adjoining Lot 4 to the south) was acquired by Martyn & Combes, from the estate of Robert Campbell who had died the year before. In , Martyn & Combes oversaw construction of the Merchants House at 43 George Street, along with an infill warehouse building between it and the adjoining subject property (45 George Street). The first recorded tenant at 47 George Street was Ashford Daniels, who occupied the building on a yearly lease from August 1843. The matching warehouse at 49 George Street on the southern side of Atherden Street was also owned by Martyn & Combes and was leased by Thomas Woolley. Both buildings were described in the Council Rates records in 1845 as \\"new no back premises\\" and were valued at ¬£70 apiece. The Council Rates records for 1848 show that 47 George Street was vacant in this year. From to 1855, 47 George Street was occupied by Martyn & Combes. Richard Fawcett was appointed manager of Martyn & Combes in 1853, and two years later was recorded as the occupier at both 43 George Street (Merchants House) and 47 George Street. 47 George Street was occupied by Lotz & Larnach, merchants, from -65; Walker & Co was listed as a co-occupant in . The subject property was occupied by R Thompson, Sergeant of Police, in 1866, but was vacant the following year. In 1868-69, Martyn and Combes resumed occupation at 47 George Street, followed by William Martyn, the eldest son of John Martyn, in 1870-71. The longest term tenant at 47 George Street was the pharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution firm of Edward Row & Co, from 1875 to . The company was at the corner of King Street and Bank Court in 1855 and appears to have been trading at 219 Pitt Street from at least 1871, prior to moving to premises in The Rocks in 1875. Edward Row & Co. manufactured drugs and remedies onsite but was also a wholesale distributor of pharmaceutical products to NSW and Queensland. An advertisement for the company indicates it had been trading since 1820 (probably in England). The firm of Edward Row & Co. was declared bankrupt three times in the nineteenth century, first in 1866 and twice in 1875. Edward Row & Co's signature product was Row's Embrocation, a liniment originally intended for horses and livestock and known as the 'Farmer's Friend'. By the late nineteenth century, its use was extended to people. In 1880, Row's Embrocation was promoted as a cure for gout, rheumatism, \\"old sores of 30 years standing\\", burns or scalds and stiffness of joints, and it was claimed that 'Row's Embrocation has no longer a place alone in the Stable, but thousands of families now keep it as an invaluable Embrocation in cases of accident'. Union Street was renamed Atherden Street in 1875, in honour local resident and landowner George Atherden. Edward Row & Co. oversaw construction of a rear building along Atherden Street (the rear addition was not shown in Dove's 1880 plan but first appears in 1889). The architect for this additional building was speculated to be Benjamin Martyn, the youngest son of John Martyn. According to Fox & Associates, the stores at 6-8 Atherden Street were \\"added to the rear portion of property\\" in 1887: \\"William Martyn by inheritance was the owner in 1887 and it is suggested that Benjamin Charles Martyn, Architect, and later trustee of the property was responsible for the store erection.\\" This building seems to consist of two elements: * A skillion roofed sandstone walled section (also referred to as a 'laundry') connected to the Union Bond Store that met the Union Bond Store in a horizontal flashing at second floor level and sloped to the west; and * A single storey shallow pitched gable roofed building fronting Atherden Street. Edward Row & Co was registered as a business in 1903, under the Registration of Firms Act 1902. Warren, Ernest and Kenneth Row continued the family business manufacturing patent medicines at 43-47 George Street, along with business partners Clive Webb, George Seaborn and Alfred Pettifer. Warren and Ernest were the sons of Edward Row, while Kenneth Row was his grandson (being the son of Warren Row). Cecil Row, recorded as a tenant at Merchants House from was the grandson of Edward Row and the youngest son of Warren Row (born in 1892). Edward Row & Co. remained at the subject property until , followed by Blake & Hargreaves, printers, from to 1925. The rear addition along Atherden Street was occupied by Bushells Ltd from 1914 until at least 1933, and was used as the Bushell's Coffee Factory. =Resumption by the New South Wales Government= The ownership of the subject property changed halfway through Edward Row & Co's tenancy. Much of the land and many of the houses, shops, pubs and warehouses in The Rocks, including the subject property, were resumed by the NSW Government in the early 1900s. From 1927 to 1937, the subject property was used as a bond store and was known as Clelands Bonded Free Store. The Customs House at Circular Quay was used as a clearing house for port transactions, where goods were cleared or stored until duties were paid on them. Bonded goods, meaning goods that had bonds placed on them prior to being cleared through customs, were traditionally stored in the Queens Warehouse which adjoined the Customs House, but the growth of trade to Sydney in the nineteenth century meant that much of this storage was contracted out to private bond storage companies such as Clelands Bonded and Free Stores, which later used a warehouse on Playfair Street (adjoining Argyle Stores). From , the subject property was leased and occupied by H. A. Zlotkowski Pty Ltd, as a \\"store for cork etc\\". From , the subject property was leased and occupied by an importation company, Craig, Mostyn & Co Pty Ltd. Initially, the building was used as the \\"No 2 Store\\" by the company, but by 1949 it had been 'partly converted into a bottling plant and distribution centre. Large, custom built concrete tanks were installed to hold the best-selling wines in bulk, the less popular lines being stored in hogsheads or puncheons on the first floor until needed for bottling on the ground floor. The Berri Co-op supplied the wine and spirits for bottling in the early days. These included brandy, gin and fortified wines such as port, muscat and sherry. By the early 1960s, the warehouse was being used \\"for the purpose of storage of skins, fruit and general merchandise\\". In April 1966, Craig, Mostyn & Co Pty Ltd sublet the premises to P. Heath, Baggage, Shipping and Forwarding Agent, as stores and offices. Although there is speculation that 47 George Street was restored in the late 1960s for use as offices, this is not evident on the Maritime Services Board (MSB) tenancy cards. The MSB had ownership of buildings in The Rocks, including the subject property, until . It is possible that the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority (SCRA) oversaw restoration works at 47 George Street when they took control of The Rocks in the early 1970s, although no documentation of these works came to light during research for the Conservation Management Plan in 2007. There is, however, photographic evidence that repainting was carried out in c. 1977. The SCRA was responsible for renaming the subject property as the Union Bond Store, in honour of the earlier name of Atherden Street,Union Street before 1875 although the building had only briefly been used as a bonded store. The tenant at 47 George Street is not known from , although it is likely that Howard O'Farrell & Co occupied the building for at least some of this period. In , the subject property was occupied by Howard O'Farrell & Co Pty Ltd, and used for offices and storage. The building at the rear (6-8 Atherden Street) was used as parking \\"for themselves and others\\". In 1985, the City of Sydney Council approved a Building Application for the \\"restoration of sandstone warehouse and infill additions to sandstone warehouse\\". In 1988, works began to refurbish the subject property for use as a branch of the Westpac Bank and a museum upstairs and at the rear. The ground floor of the warehouse building was converted for use as a banking chamber including reproduction Victorian timber counters and wall panelling. The rear addition addressing Atherden Street was demolished and replaced with existing double storey building to accommodate the Westpac Museum. The museum also used the upper storeys of the former warehouse. In 2008 Westpac moved out of the building and as of January 2009 the building was vacant.  Description  The building is a simple sandstone warehouse built . The building is of three stories and three bays wide, the otherwise severe facade relieved by a pedimented gable with a circular ventilator, horizontal string courses and deeply recessed windows of varying heights. Restored in the late 1960s, the bond store was used for offices and named Union Bond as a reminder of the street name prior to 1880.Sheedy 1976 Style: Old Colonial Georgian; Storeys: three; Roof Cladding: Galvanised Iron; Floor Frame: Timber. = Condition = As at 3 May 2001, Archaeology Assessment Condition: Partly disturbed. Assessment Basis: Floors level with George Street. Stone quarried out at rear. Westpac Bank vacated the building in 2007.  Heritage listing  As at 1 April 2011, the Westpac Bank and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The Union Bond Store at 47 George Street, The Rocks is important at a State level because it demonstrates Sydney's early to mid nineteenth century mercantile character associated with the nearby Circular Quay which was then Australia's principal port. The Union Bond Store is a rare example of a single bay warehouse in remarkable condition from this period. The commercial warehouse use can still be seen in its: * Face sandstone walls; * Warehouse doors on each level; * Cathead beam; * Roof structure (to accommodate this beam and its loading); and * The internal large second floor hatch for winching goods between levels. The Union Bond Store forms part of the historic mid nineteenth century group (43-49 George Street) which also includes: * The adjacent Merchants House at 43 George Street; * Its narrow infill warehouse at 45 George Street; and * the site of demolished twin warehouse across Atherden Street (at 49 George Street). This group is important at a State level for its demonstration of how Sydney merchants in the mid-nineteenth century lived adjacent to their warehouses within a short distance of the port, in a similar manner to European mercantile practice from at least Renaissance times. The relatively fine architectural detailing of the group demonstrates the prosperity that merchant companies were experiencing at the time. The Union Bond Store was designed by the notable English-born architect John Bibb (1810‚Äì62). Bibb trained under the architect John Verge and was one of the pre-eminent exponents of Victorian Regency and early Victorian Classic Revival architecture in Sydney from the 1840s to the early 1860s. The Bond Store is one of the few remaining examples of Bibb's early work, and possibly his only remaining warehouse building in Sydney. The building's refined Victorian Regency style is noteworthy, particularly as most other warehouses built around this time (1840s) tended to be more utilitarian in character. The building has associations with a series of persons and groups of importance in the history of commercial activities in NSW. From the time of its construction in 1841, until it was resumed by the State Government at the beginning of the twentieth century, the ownership of the subject property remained with the prominent NSW building and merchant families Martyn and Combes. From 1875 to c. 1921 the longest term tenant at these premises were Edward Row & Co. who used the buildings as factories and warehousing for their pharmaceutical business (and it is possible that they also used the adjacent Merchants House as a residence during their tenancy). The adaptation of the Union Bond Store in the 1980s as a Westpac Bank branch and Museum of Banking is of local significance in demonstrating the late twentieth century adaptation of warehouse buildings in The Rocks to business and cultural uses. The archaeological potential of the immediate grounds of the Union Bond Store is moderate, and material is likely to be of Local significance, as the grounds were disturbed by the replacement of the ground floor with concrete in the 1960s. The archaeological potential of grounds at 6-8 Atherden Street is limited by the 1985 demolition of the adjacent former factory (built late s) and the subsequent excavations to construct the Westpac Bank Museum. The archaeological potential of the associated site of the demolished twin warehouse at 49 George Street (together with other parts of Atherden Street formerly covered by early to mid 19th century buildings) is high, with material likely to include relics of State significance. Union Bond Store was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Westpac Bank and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The Union Bond Store at 47 George Street, The Rocks is important at a State level because it demonstrates Sydney's early to mid nineteenth century mercantile character associated with the nearby Circular Quay which was then Australia's principal port. The Union Bond Store is important at a State level as part of the historic mid nineteenth century group (43-49 George Street) which includes the adjacent Merchants House and its narrow warehouse and the site of demolished twin warehouse across Atherden Street (49 George Street). The building (individually and as part of this group) demonstrates how merchants in the mid-nineteenth century lived adjacent to their warehouses within a short distance of the port, in a similar manner to European mercantile practice from at least Renaissance times. The relatively fine architectural detailing of the group (including the demolished matching warehouse which stood immediately across Atherden Street) demonstrates the prosperity which merchant companies were experiencing at the time. The Union Bond Store is important at a State level for its contribution to the historic precinct now known as The Rocks, and demonstrates one of the principal phases of the history of The Rocks. The adaptation of the building in the 1980s as the Westpac Museum is of local significance in demonstrating the late twentieth century adaptation of The Rocks warehouse buildings to business and cultural uses. The Union Bond Store meets this criterion at State Level. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Union Bond Store is important to NSW for its associations with the architect John Bibb. It is one of the few remaining examples of his early work, and possibly his only remaining warehouse building in Sydney. The building is also significant at a State level for its associations with two important mercantile families. From the time of its construction, until it was resumed by the State Government at the beginning of the twentieth century, the ownership of the subject property remained with its original owners: John Martyn and James Combes and their descendants (Martyn and Combes were brothers-in-law as well as business partners). From 1875 to c. 1921, the longest term tenant at these premises was Edward Row & Co. who used the buildings as laboratories to prepare drugs / medicines and liniments, and later their famous cordial; the buildings were also used as warehouses to store products manufactured on-site and sourced elsewhere, because the company was responsible for the distribution of drugs, as well as their manufacture. It is possible that the Edward Row & Co. used the Merchants House as a residence during their tenancy. Between 1882 and 1921, the properties were rated together in the Council Rates Records. The Union Bond Store is important at a Local level for its associations with the Westpac Bank, which oversaw the construction of the new building on the Atherden Street frontage in the 1980s, for use as a museum of Banking. The Union Bond Store meets this criterion at State Level. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Union Bond Store is of State significance as a fine example of a Victorian Regency warehouse building designed by the notable architect John Bibb. English-born architect John Bibb (1810‚Äì62) was one of the pre-eminent exponents of Victorian Regency, and early Victorian Classic Revival architecture in Sydney from the 1840s to the early 1860s. Bibb trained under the architect John Verge, and took over some of his jobs when Verge gave up his practice in 1837. From the 1840s, Bibb had varied commissions, including domestic dwellings and commercial and ecclesiastical buildings. The Union Bond Store is also important for its ability to contribute to the technical history of warehousing in mid-nineteenth century NSW. This warehouse use can still be readily understood through the gantry beam, internal floor hatch and paired warehouse doors on each floor. The Union Bond Store meets this criterion at State Level. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Rocks as a whole is highly valued throughout Australia as a precinct with strong connections to important Australian historical themes. The Union Bond Store does not have strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in NSW or The Rocks area for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Union Bond Store does not meet this criterion. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The archaeological potential of the site of the Union Bond Store relates to the early development of The Rocks as well as late nineteenth and early twentieth century development. The surviving archaeological material on the site of the Union Bond Store is likely to be of local significance, being limited by the replacement of the ground floor of the Union Bond Store in concrete in the 1960s. The archaeological material on the site of 6-8 Atherden Street is limited by the 1985 demolition of the adjacent former factory (built in the late 1880s) and the subsequent excavations to construct the Westpac Bank Museum. The Union Bond Store meets this criterion at a local level. In addition, the probability of discovering significant archaeological material on the site of the demolished twin warehouse site (49 George Street) across Atherden Street (and on the other parts of Atherden Street formerly covered by buildings) is high and the archaeological material in these areas may include relics of State level of significance. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Union Bond Store is a rare example of a single bay warehouse in remarkable condition from this early nineteenth century period. It is also noteworthy for its architectural presentation in the refined Regency style. The demolition of its twin warehouse on the opposite corner of Atherden Street has to a degree impacted on its value under this criterion, however the surviving warehouse is of value in its own right. Other warehouses built at this time (1840s) tended to be more utilitarian in character. The Union Bond Store meets this criterion at State Level. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Union Bond Store is an intact representative example of a mid nineteenth century commercial warehouse building. The side elevation to Atherden Street retains its warehouse doors on each level. In addition, the building retains its cathead beam and the roof structure to accommodate this beam and its loading, as well as the internal large floor hatch for winching goods between levels. The machinery associated with the winching process has been removed. The Union Bond Store meets this criterion at local level.

Its design is attributed to John Bibb and was built during 1848. It is also known as Counting House (former) and Merchant's. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The first buildings in the vicinity were the hospital and the houses of the surgeons. The hospital was immediately to the south of the Merchant's House. By 1802 Nicholas Bayly built a substantial house with a distinctive mansard roof for himself on the eastern side of High Street more or less in front of the site. This was followed shortly by the house of Robert Campbell, also on the eastern side of the road. The first documented occupation of the site of the Merchant's House following European arrival was the leasing of the land by Captain Waterhouse. His lease, shown on Grimes' map of 1800, occupies both sides of the alignment of the High Street. Waterhouse was a naval captain, having served on the First Fleet ship Sirius as midshipman. He returned to England and took part in naval actions but was encouraged to return to the colony, importing the first merino sheep. His grants included land at Liberty Plains and Parramatta, and leases within Sydney at The Rocks and Garden Island. He returned to England for the last time in 1800. No permanent structures can be seen in paintings or drawings that show his land. Robert Campbell arrived in Sydney in 1798 from India where he worked as a merchant and trader in a family business. His arrival and enthusiasm to become established as a resident trader gave him strong support from Governor Hunter. Buying land at Dawes Point, he began to erect warehouses, wharves and a home for himself, and began to develop importing lines that were still the only source of some essential supplies. To provide for paying return cargoes, he encouraged the sealing industry. He also took over Captain Waterhouse's leases, eventually converting them into freehold granted land, which resulted in him controlling a substantial part of Dawes Point, with Campbell's Cove becoming part of the named harbour landscape. The focus of Campbell's activities was on the water's edge, with facilities for ships and warehousing. The landscape of the peninsula included a substantial brick wall that surrounded his land from George Street to Gloucester Street. The land within it appears to have been cleared but remained the original rocky slope. Detailed maps of 1822, 1831 and 1836 do not show any structures on the land, but by 1843 the effects of subdivision by Campbell are shown with houses dotting the periphery of his land. The Merchant's House land was granted to Robert Campbell on 16 October 1834, following a long period as Campbell's lease. By this time Campbell had expanded his business greatly, starting grazing stock in the Monaro and Western Plains. He was also an original shareholder of the Bank of New South Wales. Campbell is remembered positively by history, with a reputation for fairness in trade and not using his power as one of the major merchants to unduly influence the political landscape. Campbell died in 1846. The early 1840s were an economic depression in NSW, resulting from the gradual cessation of transportation and consequent rise in labour costs, severe repeated droughts and especially the pain of transforming from a state-subsidised to a mercantile economy. Although Campbell is recorded as having weathered the depression better than most of the bigger traders, he still chose to subdivide his land. While Campbell owned the area back from Campbell's Cove, its use and ultimate value were restricted to a narrow maritime trading function. Selective subdivision allowed him to raise capital without compromising the way his trading base operated. In 1841 he subdivided and placed for sale blocks of land bounded by George Street, Atherton Place and Gloucester Street. One allotment, No. 4, was conveyed to John Martyn and James Combes for ¬£825 in June 1841. This was the southeastern corner block of Campbell's land and located on the northern corner of George Street and a small lane, initially called Union Lane. Martyn and Combes erected a three- storey building on the corner, with a matching partner for it being erected at about the same time on the opposite corner of the lane. The north corner building of George Street and Atherton Place became No. 47 George Street. The matched buildings were designed by John Bibb. Martyn and Combes operated as plumbers, painters and glaziers in a building only down George Street on the corner of Jamison Street, but clearly had enough capital to invest in a substantial construction. Several years later, after Campbell's death in 1846, his son George sold the neighbouring allotment No. 5 to Martyn and Combes as well, for the sum of ¬£300. Allotment 5 became Nos. 43-45 George Street, although different numbering was used during the later 19th century. Martyn and Combes erected the Merchant's House by September 1848. They were described as 'newly erected stone built premises, situate in George-street North, opposite Messrs. Campbell's, consisting of a commodious dwelling house and spacious stores, replete with every convenience'. It was noted as having stone walls, three floors, a slate roof and a frontage onto George Street. Both No. 47 and Nos. 43-45 had been built with the intention of being leased or let to other users. Sydney Cove became busier during the 1840s as the success of the wool industry brought wealth, trade goods and encouraged immigration. Investing in the infrastructure of trade may have been a gamble in 1841 but would have been proven a safe bet seven years later. The first known occupants of 43-45 were Lawrence and Steven Spyers, operating as merchants and commission agents, occupying both the house and the store in 1850. Two years later the residence was occupied by Archibald Walker, a merchant, and Martyn and Combes occupied the store. Martyn occupied the residence from 1859 until his death in 1864, and the store by Martyn and Combes. The two buildings Nos. 43-45 and No. 47 appear to have been treated as a single entity by Martyn and Combes as is shown in detailed plans which begin to appear in this period. The death of John Martyn signals the start of a rapid turnover of tenants and occupants. After John Martyn's death, his son William ran the business in the store, but the residence was occupied by William Rielly in 1865-1867. The Merchant's House itself was suitable as a residence for respectable business men. The succession of soap manufacturer and manufacturing chemist suggests that the place with the adjoining store was also suited for that type of light industry, even though it did not directly reflect The Rocks' maritime or mercantile character, unlike the wool brokers and merchants who needed to be near the port. That these presumably aromatic trades could be carried out next to residences suggests that the expectations of tenants were not too high. Edward Row and Co. initially occupied No. 47, and then expanded into No. 45 in 1876, and by 1882 they had also taken over the residence. Row is listed as a wholesaling and manufacturing chemist. Little is known of the firm Edward Row apart from their products. Their earlier offices mentioned in advertisements are in King Street and Bank Court, Sydney, and the proprietors were John and Edward Row. One advertisement quotes them as being established in 1820. As a wholesaling and manufacturing chemist it is likely that Row produced their own and on-sold other manufacturers' products, possibly taking in bulk volumes and packaging it for the colonial market. Row's Embrocation was probably their major product, judging by its appearance as a large lettered sign on the northern face of No. 43 in the later 19th century. It was a dressing for cuts and abrasions to animals, but humans also used it. They are recorded as having bought the patent for Josephson's Australian Ointment in about 1870 and continued producing it under its original name. They are also advertised as manufacturers of cordial, soap powder and vinegar as well as pharmaceuticals. As manufacturing and importing chemists Row and Co. can be expected to have bought chemical supplies in bulk and possibly already packaged for sale through pharmacists and agricultural suppliers. They would probably have repackaged bulk materials into containers for sale, and are likely to have conducted their own manufacturing on the site. This would have therefore required storage for bulk imported chemicals, for the packaging into which it would have been then distributed, an assortment of machinery for their own production, including mixers, blenders and pill machines. These could have been hand operated or connected to a small steam engine that would have provided sufficient motive power. Edward Row and co occupied the property until 1921, at which point they shared with another occupant for three years, and ceased occupation in 1924 after a total tenancy of 48 years. During these last few years electrical engineer Cecil Row, probably related to the Edward Row family, also occupied the residence. A box manufacturing company, Lawley and Co. occupied the store in 1925. In 1902 the buildings were resumed by The Rocks Resumption Board. Lots 4 and 5 were sold to the board for . The board had been established to acquire privately owned property in The Rocks for redevelopment, because the 1900 bubonic plague outbreak had proven to some that the old and poorly planned residential area provided a ready reception for disease-bearing rats from the equally old and poorly planned wharf facilities. While this was partially true, the inadequacies of the existing port facilities were recognised and plans were drawn up for a modern port, which required the Government's acquisition and consolidation of land several blocks from the waterfront. While many houses within The Rocks were demolished, the use of the Merchant's House for manufacturing, business and residential occupation continued relatively unaffected. The Sydney Harbour Trust (SHT) gained control of the property from The Rocks Resumption Board in 1927. This was part of a continuing process of acquisition of properties within The Rocks and Millers Point that had begun when the SHT was established in 1900. Although its main purpose was not to manage properties it took on this role because of a lack of strategic direction following World War I. The first boarding house lease was issued to Mary Grady (or O'Grady) for the combined Nos. 43-45 in 1928. Some modifications were required to permit the new form of use, and these are probably the reason for partitioning, and access being pushed through between the residence and store at each level. A bathroom was added on Level 1 at the stair landing. Further modifications are recorded in 1934, including a new kitchen and improvements in water supply and toilet, as well as further improvements in access between the two buildings. Mary Grady's granddaughter Joan Cubis was interviewed in the house in 1993 before the most recent conservation works took place. Joan lived with her grandmother in the house from 1928. Her grandmother had moved from Fort Street because of construction of the Harbour Bridge. Mary Grady was replaced as lessee by Haigh Zlotkowtski in 1935 who remained until 1941. The access points from No. 45 to No. 47, which had been closed off, presumably when the SHT took over, were re-opened. It is also known that the Indian Navy used the premises for accommodation during 1941-1942 and possibly after. Searches of Australian Archives have not found relevant files relating to this but these may appear in the future. The Indian sailors were billeted while the corvettes they were to sail home were readied. From 1943 Alice Auguston commenced another boarding house lease. Modifications included gas supplies to kitchen areas and enclosing some of the rear openings in No. 45. The Auguston family retained the lease until 1985. Information about the building in the period from the end of World War II to the end of last century is sparse. The Auguston family continued to hold the lease. The Maritime Services Board (successor to the Sydney Harbour Trust) remained in ownership until the mid 1980s, when the property was transferred to the Sydney Cove Authority. The Merchant's House and its adjoining buildings were considered to be important parts of the historic fabric that would be conserved in the process of developing new office precincts. As is well known, a combination of green bans and political reality prevented particular schemes from proceeding as originally planned. The end result was that Nos. 43-45 were retained, eventually coming into the ownership of the Sydney Cove Authority, later the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority (SHFA). The building on the southern side of the lane, corner George Street, that matched Martyn and Combes' building at No. 47, was demolished in the 1920s and replaced by another larger building, now known as the Old Sydney Holiday Inn, built in 1923-26. This larger building reflected a 20th-century scale of construction that demarcated it from 19th-century low-rise commercial architecture in The Rocks. The building that was situated in the rear yard of Nos. 43-45 and built , fronting Atherden Place was occupied by Bushells in the mid 1930s. Their main office and coffee roasting operation was in Harrington Street. It was later used as a store by Howard O'Farrells, an import-export firm located on Cumberland Street, until its demolition in the 1980s. From 1985 Merchant's House has been used for a number of different purposes. In the Westpac Museum of banking was extended to occupy the area behind Nos. 43-45 which covers the footprint of the shed. No records have been found of what was removed by the works, and it is assumed that all earlier archaeological evidence has been destroyed. From 1991 to 1994 SHFA undertook a comprehensive program of internal and external conservation works to Merchant's House. This included some archaeological monitoring work inside and in front of the building. The archaeologist, Jane Lydon, reported that as the structure had been cut into bedrock it had limited archaeological potential, and so she examined built up debris that had accumulated in the basement area. This revealed that the basement floor may originally have been timbered, as the deposit of bitumen, dark brown fill and recent dumping sat over natural excavated bedrock. Josephsons Australian Ointment and Rows Embrocation bottles were found in the fill of the footing trench in the south wall of the room, confirming that these openings had been added during the period of their occupation. Material from sub-floor deposits in the attic level of the residence is most likely associated with the occupancy by Thomas Gainsford, the Minister of the Mariner's Church or Charles Smith, listed in different Sands Directories as both an accountant and confectioner. The place was generally conserved to its c.1840s form with some lesser rooms being restored to their c.1940s state. Work proceeded on the understanding that the place would be handed over to the National Trust at a peppercorn rental, in return for ongoing management as a museum. Several conserved spaces, including the first floor parlour, basement kitchen and several attic rooms were presented in a house museum context. In 1994 Charles, Prince of Wales, opened the National Trust Toy Museum comprising the James Hardie Toy Collection. The toy museum closed in about 1995, and the National Trust vacated the place. The building remained vacant until 1999. The SHFA Education Unit then occupied Merchant's House and operated its \\"Children Stepping Back in Time\\" program. From 2000 SHFA's Sydney Learning Adventures program has operated out of the place and use it for interpretation of historical education programs.  Description  1848 merchant's town house and office. The Merchants House consists of five levels including basement kitchen, ground floor dining room, first floor drawing room, bedrooms and servants quarters. The planning is typical of a late Georgian period townhouse with kitchen, scullery, and cellars in the basement; ground floor dining room, parlour, and entrance hall; first floor drawing room with french doors onto a cantilevered balcony, and bedrooms on the upper two floors. The style is Greek Revival. Typical details include the water leafs motifs on the stone brackets supporting the first floor window cornices, front door fanlight, heavy cornice, stone architrave mouldings to the upper windows, the fine timber geometric staircase and other interior details. Style: Greek Revival; Storeys: 3 plus basement & attic; Side Rear Walls: Stone; Roof Cladding: Galvanised steel; Floor Frame: Timber; Ceilings: Lath and plaster = Condition = As at 3 May 2001, Archaeology Assessment Condition: Partly disturbed. Good underfloor deposits preserved in situ. Assessment Basis: Cellars. Floors level with George Street. Stone quarried out at rear in 1840s. Floorboards were lifted during final stages of conservation on the building and it was noted that the under floor deposits were fairly substantial. These have been retained for future investigation. Investigation: Watching Brief. Extremely intact fabric generally, with evidence of partitions from the boarding house period. Archaeology partly disturbed. Good interfloor deposits preserved in situ. = Modifications and dates = A timber addition on the rear of 43 George Street is shown on a 's map. By the late 1880s the rear yard area of 43-47 George Street had been enclosed by a wooden and corrugated iron structure. This space probably formed part of Row's manufacturing establishment. It is possible that the timber rear addition over the area to 43 George Street was demolished between 1902 and 1927 after the buildings were resumed. The pressed metal ceilings on the ground floor and the repairs to the chimney pieces also date from this period. Further renovations were made in 1928 and in 1934. During the building's conservation and adaptation as a house museum in 1993, the need for fire upgrade necessitated the conversion of the store at 45 George Street to a fire stair to serve both 47 and 43 George Street. A new roof element was introduced to house a smoke exhaust above the stairwell.S Duyker 1999  Heritage listing  As at 30 March 2011, the Merchant's House and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The Merchant's House is the most intact example of the typical late Georgian period townhouse (with basement offices, ground floor dining room, first floor drawing room and upper bedrooms) known to survive in NSW. Built in 1848, documentary evidence suggest that it was designed by John Bibb, considered one of the finest Greek Revival architects in Australia. It contains a rare example in Sydney of an intact mid nineteenth century first floor drawing room with its moulded plasterwork, chimney piece and grate, joinery, and cantilevered balcony. The Merchant's House contains original elements of high quality including a geometric staircase, cast-iron cantilevered balcony, stonework, surface finishes, door cases, windows, French doors, dormer windows and servant bell system. The house was designed to complement the adjoining warehouse built four years earlier. Within the present streetscape of George Street North, the buildings contribute to a fine ensemble of buildings from the early Victorian to Edwardian period. Including a range of residential terraces from the early 1840s (85-77 George Street), to the 1860s (32-29 George Street), and the 1880s (41-33 George Street). The building complex reflects the wealth and status of the small business and merchant class of 19th century Sydney and provides evidence of the once dominant mercantile nature of The Rocks. It is an extremely valuable resource for understanding life in the area, especially if examined along with Gannon House in Argyle Street and Susannah Place in Gloucester Street which represent contrasting socio-economic backgrounds.Clive Lucas Stapleton, 1990 Merchant's House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The granting of the land to Captain Henry Waterhouse and later to Robert Campbell were representative of the way that land was used to both reward and encourage the work of important individuals in the colony. The subdivision of Campbell's land, and construction of a building by Martyn and Combes combining a gentleman's townhouse residence and warehouse or store reflects the character of The Rocks, where merchants lived in or near the commercial district. The Rocks included many substantial terraces and large villas that can be seen in mid 19th century illustrations. The Rocks relied on the maritime trade and industries concentrated along the foreshore for its wealth. The subject town house fits firmly within this social mix, and also with the close association of residence with work, as a sign of the mercantile middle class. It also was speculative building on the part of Martyn and Combes, tied physically to their earlier buildings on either side of Union Street, reminding us that it was built during the 1840s when the colonial economy was undergoing a dramatic bust-boom cycle as it transformed from a convict-based to a capitalist economy. It has been found that few, if any other such examples can still reflect the particular historical associations and activities as Merchant's House and store. The changing occupancy of the buildings charts a process that affected all of The Rocks and other parts of Sydney. The construction by Martyn and Combes and their initial occupation of the building can suggest either that this had been their plan all along or that they were having trouble finding occupants for their speculative investment. The residence began to be occupied by precisely the intended market - respectable men who had a need to live in The Rocks, notably Thomas Gainsford of the Mariners Church. The use of the store eventually settled into occupation by a soap manufacturer and then the long-term occupancy by Edward Row and Company, chemical manufacturers. Through the later 19th century Row and Co. occupied the store, adjoining building and residence, reflecting less the maritime character of The Rocks and more a light manufacturing industrial suburb which happened to be fringed by docks and warehouses. This was characteristic of Sydney's working harbour in the 19th century. The early 20th century saw the bubonic plague and subsequent attempts to turn The Rocks into a modern industrial complex. The development along the foreshore by the Sydney Harbour Trust and the resumption of the property show that the government felt that official intervention was needed to both solve the perceived social and medical problems posed by The Rocks, and the commercial necessities for completely redeveloped port facilities. The place is a tangible survivor of the purge of building stock associated with the plague and its consequential rebuilding activity. The house became used as a boarding house, as did many places within The Rocks, Millers Point, and elsewhere in Sydney town. The Rocks community included many seafarers and people who had been dispossessed from their own homes by resumptions and the boarding house culture developed, although it had been present from early in The Rocks' and Sydney town history. A brief interlude with associated adaptation work to the house during World War II between 1941 and 1942, saw Indian Navy personnel billeted in the building, while assisting on the construction of corvettes - and then the boarding house role continued. The most recent chapter of the building's history began with the creation of the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority. Recognised as one of the genuinely historic buildings within SCRA's control, it was probably never under threat in the same way that other parts of The Rocks were. From 1985, after it finally ceased to be a boarding house, it became a heritage property with all of the difficulties of finding viable uses and making acceptable intervention in fabric that this entails. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Merchant's House is associated with Martyn and Combes, who were responsible for the erection of the place, and were well known nineteenth century Sydney plumbers, painters, glaziers and merchants. The business operated in Sydney for 30 years. The success of the firm in the early to mid 1840s is witnessed by the capital investment in the buildings built between 43 and 49 (now demolished) George Street. The firm of Edward Row & Co. - wholesale and manufacturing chemists, were long term tenants of Merchant's House. The business had occupied the premises at 47 George Street from 1875, which was used as a laboratory; their retail outlet being 219 Pitt Street. The company was well known for its medication 'Row's Embrocation' or \\"Farmers Friend\\". The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The design, configuration, detail and materials of Merchant's House and its store are excellent examples of the Greek Revival style in New South Wales. The facade displays typical yet fine Greek Revival details including water leaf motifs on the stone brackets supporting the first floor window cornices, front door fanlight, heavy cornice, stone architrave and mouldings to the upper windows. The interior has a fine timber geometric staircase, polished Cedar joinery, Australian sienna marble chimney piece in the drawing room and other original interior details. The layout of Merchant's House is a representative, yet now rare, exemplar of the late Georgian/early Victorian period townhouse which included kitchen, scullery and cellars in the basement; entrance hall, dining room and parlour on the ground floor; drawing room on the first floor with French doors onto a balcony; and bedrooms on the upper two floors. With its adjoining working store (now adapted) it is an excellent example of a townhouse with associated store from the 1840s. As a late Georgian/early Victorian period townhouse design, Merchant's House is unique in Sydney and probably throughout New South Wales for displaying the design qualities of that type. Due to its location in George Street, Merchant's House makes a valuable contribution to the evolution and streetscape of The Rocks. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Merchant's House is of particular interest to heritage aficionados and heritage organizations in general including the National Trust of Australia and associated groups for its rarity as an architectural type, design, and level of intactness. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Merchant's House is a unique reference building for a Merchant's' residence and adjacent store of the early Victorian period in Sydney. The overall design, layout and materials, rarity, well proportioned and detailed George Street elevation, elegant staircase and chimneypieces, and intact drawing room provide valuable information related to the development of the Greek Revival style and working Merchant's townhouse and store in New South Wales, and interpretation of the London townhouse in Sydney. The archaeological evidence surviving within and in front of the building has been previously investigated during conservation and adaptation work. It has improved our understanding of the development of the site, and the lives of its residents. Little evidence is expected to remain due to the impacts of previous work, however any possible remaining resource is of high archaeological significance and meets this criterion for its ability to further inform conservation decisions and illustrate historical use. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Merchant's House is the most intact example of a late Georgian/early Victorian period townhouse known to survive in Sydney, and probably New South Wales. Merchant's House is a rare example of early Victorian period Merchant's' residence with attached adjacent store in Sydney, and probably New South Wales. No. 43 George Street contains a rare example in Sydney of an intact mid 19th century first floor townhouse drawing room complete with its original fabric including moulded plasterwork, chimneypiece and grate, joinery, French doors and balcony. No. 43 George Street contains a number of rare and excellently detailed elements including a timber geometric stair and cast iron cantilevered balcony. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Merchant's House forms part of a group of mid 19th century to early 20th century buildings in George Street North which collectively demonstrate the pattern, development and evolution of The Rocks, a highly valued tourist destination for Australia. No. 43 George Street is now a rare representative and outstanding example of a late Georgian/early Victorian period townhouse with its store, designed in the Greek Revival style in Sydney. The place is held in high esteem by groups interested in recognizing such important values to the community e.g. the National Trust of Australia, and likely to be so to more members of the broader community once promoted.

It was established in 1967 by Wolfe Mays. The society accomplishes its aims through a journal, an annual conference (as well as other events), and a podcast.  Journal of the British Society for Phenomenology (JBSP)  The Journal of the British Society for Phenomenology was launched in 1970. Edited by Wolfe Mays, the president of the BSP, it began by publishing a volume each year consisting of three issues. Wolfe Mays remained the editor up to his death in 2005. Assistant editor Ullrich Haase then took on the editorship. During Haase's leadership, the journal went from three issues a year to four. Haase also moved the journal from a private publisher to Taylor and Francis, allowing the membership and the public to easily access a wealth of material online, going all the way back to 1970 when the JBSP began. 2019 was the 50th anniversary of the journal, and after 14 years as editor, Haase signalled his intention to stand down from his role, while completing his work on the remaining 2019 volume publications as well as some planned special issues for 2020 and beyond. To celebrate the 50th anniversary, Haase convened a three day event titled the 'JBSP 50th Anniversary Conference' in Manchester at the International Anthony Burgess Foundation. Keynote speakers were the renowned international academics Prof. Babette Babich, Prof. Robert Bernasconi, and Dr. Francesca Brencio. In the wake of Hasse stepping down as editor the society instituted an editorial collective. In February 2019 Darian Meacham was appointed as editor-in-chief of the editorial collective, working towards the 2020 volume. Other members of the collective include Keith Crome (former BSP president), Andrea Rehberg, William Large, Matt Bernard, Michaela Summa, and Haase (thus continuing his association with the journal). The JBSP is an internationally refereed journal and operates a process of at least two referees blind peer-reviewing. It publishes papers on phenomenology and existential philosophy as well as contributions from other fields of philosophy, the humanities and the human sciences. The journal also publishes book reviews. The online version of the Journal of the British Society for Phenomenology is hosted at Taylor & Francis Online.  BSP Events = Annual Conference = Each year the British Society for Phenomenology convenes an annual conference at a different location within the UK. Most recently the society has held its annual conference at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) (2019 and 2016); University of Kent (2018); and University of Brighton (2017). The conferences usually have between two and four high profile keynote speakers who are invited by the conference committee. Recent keynotes have included the renowned international academics and practitioners Havi Carel, Felix O‚ÄôMurchadha, Tanja Staehler, Luna Dolezal, Niall Keane and Linda Finlay. As well as keynote speakers, there is a call for papers for academics and practitioners to apply to present their work. All applications are blind peer-reviewed by the conference committee. Currently, the conference format is a single track event. = Workshops and Symposia = The BSP also funds and convenes workshops and symposia. Most recently, these have included 'Intentionality and the Human' at the Great North Museum (Newcastle upon Tyne, 2016); 'Cormac McCarthy and Philosophy' at the People‚Äôs History Museum (for MMU, 2017); and 'Embodied Subjects ‚Äì Phenomenology, Literature, and the Health Humanities' at the International Anthony Burgess Foundation (for MMU, 2018). Speakers have included Francis Halsal, Patrick O‚ÄôConnor, and Raymond Tallis.  BSP Podcast  The BSP Podcast was launched on 10 October 2016. It was created by Matt Barnard, a member of the British Society for Phenomenology‚Äôs executive committee. The podcast is a free audio streaming service which is organised into seasons, with episodes released each week. It is hosted on the podcast platform, Podbean. It aims to ‚Äòpreserve, archive, and share the work of phenomenologists associated with the society‚Äô. The content comes from recordings of papers given at BSP events, such as the annual conference as well as workshops and symposia.

The Eight Summits are the collective name for eight highest mountains in the seven continents.

Mountaineers can all agree that climbing all the summits is among the supreme accomplishments of their sport. The list of successful climbers is listed on internet as a life pride. The eight summits consists of: * Mount Everest, the highest peak of Asia * Aconcagua, the highest peak of South America * Denali, the highest peak of North America * Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest peak of Africa * Vinson Massif, the highest peak of Antarctica * Mount Elbrus, the highest peak of Europe * Puncak Jaya, the highest peak of Australasia / Oceania * Mount Kosciuszko, the highest peak of Australia  Controversy  Due to the difference in definition and the controversy on the boundaries of continents. There were several version of \\"Seven Summits\\" and \\"Eight Summits\\". The most prominent one includes \\"The Messner List\\" which omitted the Mount Kosciuszko in Australia, supporter of this list argues that the Puncak Jaya in Indonesia should be regarded as the Peak for the Australasia or Oceania 'continent'. It is also due to the fact that the summiting the Mount Kosciuszko is relatively an easier task, as the mountain is significantly lower than other summits (only 2,228m above sea level). Another list is called \\"The Bass List\\", named after Richard Bass, the first mountaineer completed his list of \\"seven summits\\" which omitted the Puncak Jaya in Indonesia from the Eight Summits.

It is her second novel to be published, after Conversations with Friends (2017). It became a best-seller in the US, selling almost 64,000 copies in hardcover in its first four months of release. A critically acclaimed and Emmy nominated television adaptation aired from April 2020. Synopsis The novel is about the complex friendship and relationship between two teenagers, Connell and Marianne, who both attend the same secondary school in County Sligo and, later, Trinity College Dublin (TCD). It is set during the post-2008 Irish economic downturn. Connell is a popular, handsome and highly intelligent secondary school student who begins a relationship with unpopular, intimidating yet equally intelligent Marianne, whose mother employs his mother as a cleaner. Connell keeps the affair a secret from school friends out of shame but ends up attending Trinity with her after the summer and reconciling. Well-off Marianne blossoms at university, becoming pretty and popular, while Connell struggles for the first time in his life to fit in properly. The pair weave in and out of each other's lives across their university years, developing an intense bond that brings to light the traumas and insecurities that make them both who they are. Reception The novel was longlisted for the 2018 Man Booker Prize. It was voted as the 2018 Waterstones' Book of the Year and won \\"Best Novel\\" at the 2018 Costa Book Awards. In 2019, it was longlisted for the Women's Prize for Fiction. In the same year, the novel was ranked 25th on The Guardians list of the 100 best books of the 21st century. Media in Ireland described the book as a polemic, noting that Rooney has described herself as a Marxist and that the book features discussions about The Communist Manifesto document and Doris Lessing's feminist novel The Golden Notebook. Adaptation In May 2019, BBC Three and Hulu announced that a TV series based on the novel, starring Daisy Edgar-Jones and Paul Mescal as Marianne and Connell respectively, was to be produced.

An early practitioner was the Swedish Major Thure Brandt (1819‚Äì1895), whose method was described in the New York Medical Journal and the Journal of the American Medical Association. Brandt had been developing his method since the 1860s, and after having a breakthrough in 1886, the method was disseminated in the Baltic Sea region, Germany, and to the world, including to the United States. The method was based upon an old holistic theory of women‚Äôs physiology: the uterus was seen as a hub of network of nerves in the female body from which illness was disseminated throughout the body, especially if the uterus was somehow displaced. The pelvic massage restored the uterus to its proper place and thus the typical women‚Äôs complaints, like headaches, backaches, fatigue, depression and such, were cured.Malmberg (2019), p. 45. The massage usually involved the patient being treated in the nude or in a leotard. Pubic hair treatment was optional. The doctor or therapist put his or her finger in the vagina of the patient and simultaneously massaged the uterus from the outside with the other hand.Malmberg (2019), p. 41. Sometimes the massage was actually carried out by a female assistant of the male physician or physiotherapist, but her participation in the process was usually not mentioned in medical writings and the male practitioner was cited as the sole expert on the method instead.Malmberg (2019), pp. 53‚Äì54. Contrary to what Rachel Maines claimed in her book The Technology of Orgasm, many practitioners of this massage were aware of the possibility of a sexual stimulation during the procedure and, like the Finnish physician Georg Asp (1834‚Äì1901), made it clear that the sexual excitation shall be circumvented and the clitoris studiously avoided.Malmberg (2019), p. 47. The pelvic massage disappeared from gynecology during the 1920s.Malmberg (2019), p. 42. One important reason to that was the influence of early psychoanalysis: the locus of women‚Äôs pathological issues was moved from the uterus to the neurotic brain, and they were now seen as psychological, not physiological ailments.Malmberg (2019), p. 56.

The show is based on the life of Chandragupta Maurya, the first Mauryan emperor and founder of the Maurya Empire. The show is produced by Siddharth Kumar Tewary's One Life Studios. The show is a seamless continuation of One Life Studio's earlier show Porus. Plot The show starts in 323 BCE, exactly after the deaths of Porus and Alexander The Great. Alexander's general Seleucus Nikator is still in India, having allied himself with Ambhikumar (ruler of Takshashila). Chandragupta is a slave, and is supported in his antics by his friends. Chanakya arrives in Magadha, ruled by the unjust and cruel Nanda king Dhana Nanda to seek his help in overthrowing the Greeks out of India, but Dhana Nanda openly humiliates Chanakya in the court, which prompts the latter to take a vow of uprooting him from the throne and putting a capable ruler on the throne of Magadha. Chanakya soon finds Chandragupta, and recognises him as someone who would be an able ruler of Magadha, and be responsible for a change in India. Chanakya trains Chandragupta, and the latter comes to know of his lineage. His father Chandravardhan was the king of the Piplivan Kingdom, but the kingdom was destroyed and Chandravardhan was killed by Dhana Nanda, and Chandragupta, a young prince, was sent away safely and sold as a slave, and his mother Mura was held captive. Together, Chanakya forms a small army, and they face Dhana Nanda, but lose. They later capture a fort, but they (Chanakya, Chandragupta, Mura and Sthoolbhadra - a friend of Chandragupta) are presumed dead in the siege, but actually the 4 escape. The duo of Chanakya and Chandragupta are later thrown into a pit by Seleucus and Ambhikumar (now Ambhiraj) when they tried to seek their help. Mura and Sthoolbhadra fail to save them, hence they are presumed dead by them too. =5 years later= Chandragupta comes out of the pit, along with Chanakya and other people who had been trapped in the pit earlier. Chandragupta also captures Piplivan. Ambhiraj and Ambhikumar both, are killed amidst this. They also find Malayketu, the lost son of Porus, and he is declared as the king of the Pauravas, hence Chandra gains help of the Paurava army, as well as the Takshashila which has no king. Dhana Nanda's Durdhara and Chandragupta also fall in love with each other and marry. Chandragupta and the Nanda armies face each other in a series of encounters, wherein Dhana Nanda's 7 brothers, as well as some from the Chandra's side are also killed, including the Piplivan generals, Mura, Sthoolbhadra and Malayketu - who passed on his kingdom to Chandragupta. Durdhara gives birth to a son, Bindusara, before dying due to poisoned food mistakenly served in her meal. Dhana Nanda seeks help of Seleucus, but Chandragupta defeats and kills Dhana Nanda this time, hence becoming the king of Magadha and establishing the Maurya Empire. He also marries Helena, the daughter of Seleucus. Chanakya ends the show on a note that he wants a Chandragupta in every citizen.

He joined the Medical Research Council (United Kingdom) Institute of Hearing Research in 1977 and served as its deputy director from 1993 to 2004, before moving on to a chair in psychology at The University of York. He served as head of the Psychology department from 2011 to 2017 and retired in 2018, becoming an emeritus professor. From 2013 to 2018, he was a member of the University of York‚Äôs Finance & Policy Committee. From 2015 to 2018, he was a member of York University‚Äôs governing body, the Council. Summerfield was awarded an MBE in the 2019 New Year's Honours, for services to psychology and people with hearing loss.  Early life and education  Quentin Summerfield was born in London to Arthur Summerfield, Professor of Psychology at Birkbeck College and Aline Whalley, an Educational Psychologist. His sister, Penelope Summerfield is a Professor of Modern History at the University of Manchester. Summerfield grew up in Muswell Hill in North London, attended Tetherdown Primary School and University College School in Hampstead, where he was Head Boy in 1966-67. He studied Natural Sciences at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, graduating with an upper second class degree in Psychology in 1971. He obtained his doctorate under the supervision of Professor Mark Haggard at Queen‚Äôs University, Belfast in 1975. From 1975 to 1977 he was a NATO post- doctoral Research Fellow at Haskins Laboratories, Yale University.  Research  Summerfield has conducted research on speech perception, as well as applied research on the effectiveness and economics of cochlear implantation. His research on speech perception included:- These and works on speech perception were recognised by his election as a Fellow of the Acoustical Society of America in 1998. In 1995, Summerfield wrote the Medical Research Council (United Kingdom) report. on the National Cochlear Implant Programme, prompting an editorial in the British Medical Journal that concluded \\"Cochlear implantation is perhaps the most exciting development in otology this century. The benefits are immense. The report by Summerfield and Marshall confirms that, in the words of the late Graham Fraser, the founder of the British Cochlear Implant Group, 'Cochlear implants work.'\\" An article in ENT and Audiology News reported that \\"This was a pivotal step for the introduction of NHS (National Health Service) funding.\\" The report resulted in the George Davey Howells Memorial Prize for his research group from the University of London (1995), the Thomas Simm Littler Prize from the British Society of Audiology British Society of Audiology (1996), and the Edith Whetnall Memorial Medal from Otology Section of the Royal College of Medicine (1996). Subsequent research contributed evidence that was used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in framing guidance on cochlear implantation and in 2002 and resulted in the Ear and Hearing editors' award from the American Auditory Society. That research was followed by a series of papers exploring the criteria for candidacy in cochlear implantation in Ear and Hearing that attracted a special statement from the editorial board, which reads:  Societal contributions  Summerfield has been Chair of the Scottish National Services Division‚Äôs Quinquennial Review of the provision of cochlear- implantation services.

Biography As a painter, Edgar has been classified as a \\"wom[a]n artist who broke the rules,\\" and her lively, and often large, abstractions typically include a \\"mass of layered colors‚Äîwith multiple glazes, opacities, broad areas laid down in washes\\" while \\"using dynamic strokes and contrasting tones [that] ... juxtapose[s] color with areas of vacant canvas.\\" Her skill and interests built on early art training at Brooklyn College with Mark Rothko, Ad Reinhardt, Burgoyne Diller, Alfred Russell, Harry Holzman, Martin James, and a degree in art history from Columbia University. That background laid the groundwork for a life-long appreciation for abstraction, which spanned reviews for Isamu Noguchi, Norman Bluhm, Esteban Vicente and Franz Kline as well as a 1965 review on \\"The Satisfactions of Robert Motherwell\\" for ArtNews, in which she explained her thinking about abstraction this way: > The almost-star could be a starfish, two ovals suggest anatomy, an egg-shape > might be an egg, a blot a cocoon, a rumpled paper bag evokes the many lives > it passed through, an almost-arch strains to bend more or straighten out, > almost-triangle yearns to be perfect. They assume the capability needed to > reach their ideals at one extreme, or, at the other extreme, their freedom > in abstract invention. From familiar shapes they are transfigured into > dramatic images. Edgar has written and collaborated on many long-form projects on the early history of Abstract Expressionism. Her book Club Without Walls documents the movement's birth and development at the 8th Street Club. Collaborative work with husband and sculptor Phillip Pavia, also on the Club, is now archived at Emory University's research libraries.

Written in the 1890s, it was first published posthumously in Portuguese in 1912. The first English version, translated by Gregory Rabassa and Earl E. Fritz, was published by Tagus Press in 2015. Background Although not strictly speaking a hagiography of Saint Christopher, the novella does draw on the legend of the saint, providing a fictional version described by one scholar as a ‚Äúhagiofantasy‚Äù. As with several other works by E√ßa, there is no extant original manuscript and it is unclear how final the published version was intended to be. It was originally published in Portuguese twelve years after E√ßa's death, as part of a volume called √öltimas P√°ginas (Last Pages), which included two other stories inspired by the lives of saints, Saint Onuphrius and Saint Giles of Santar√©m. Despite the fact that he draws on the legends of saints for these stories, other novels by E√ßa reveal a fairly ambivalent approach to the Catholic Church, with The Crime of Father Amaro being openly critical of the clergy and The Relic poking fun at the excessive religiosity of late 19th Century Portugal.  The story  The Christopher of E√ßa's novella lives in the Middle Ages. Son of poor parents and physically unattractive he grows rapidly to become a giant. Following the death of his parents he finds himself in various situations in which he can put his strength to altruistic purposes. Initially he helps people in his parents‚Äô town with their daily chores and becomes very popular, but at the insistence of the Church the people turn against him and he is driven out, being blamed for a storm that damages the buildings and destroys the crops. After wandering the country he arrives at a castle that has been afflicted by the plague. He helps by burying the dead and carrying food and firewood but is eventually captured by the Count, who is jealous of the affection of the people for him. Christopher manages to break free and after further travels through the countryside comes across a group of religious hermits. The Friar persuades him to help with the hermits‚Äô daily chores, to give them more time for their religious activities, but Christopher eventually leaves finding their obsession with paying penances, including self- flagellation, to be ridiculous. Christopher then travels through an area laid destitute by battles between feudal lords. Those peasants who have not been killed are starving. This leads him to question his religious beliefs, not understanding why God fails to intervene to put an end to the suffering. He next arrives at a feudal castle where he becomes the plaything of the Lord of the Manor, a young boy, carrying the boy everywhere on his shoulders. Eventually rejected by the growing boy he then becomes involved with and eventually leader of a peasant revolt with similarities to the Jacquerie revolt in 14th Century France. When the rebels were eventually defeated he comes close to death but receives a visitation from an angel and recovers to again wander the countryside, helping people wherever he can. After a period being exhibited as a freak show in a country fair, Christopher continues his travels. He comes across a group of travellers unable to cross a river because of the destruction of the bridge and, as in the legend of Saint Christopher, carries them, their possessions and animals across the river. He decides to settle by the river so that he can continue to provide this service. Eventually he becomes old and exhausted and the final scene has him rising up to Heaven in the company of the baby Jesus Christ. Significance Ana Siqueira suggests that E√ßa's story proposes a model of altruism in opposition to the moral bankruptcy and cultural stagnation of 19th-century Portugal, a common theme in E√ßa's novels. She argues that the novella aims to direct Portuguese Catholics to social justice and not just spiritual salvation. In an introduction to the book, Carlos Reis considers that the novella strongly represents the values of E√ßa himself, those of a passion for social justice and human solidarity that are nearly always reflected in his other works.

Its appearance can be noticed at folk events during the period after Christmas, yet most likely in times of Carnival and before Lent begins. The name is derived from the word tur, meaning aurochs.  Customs  The person that played Turo≈Ñ covered himself with a cloth sheet or sheep skin, holding a wooden pole in front of him, topped with a bull's head with flopping jaw, horns (sometimes real ones ‚Äì bovine ‚Äì or simply, wooden ones), the head covered with rabbit skin or some other animal skin. Turo≈Ñ walks hunched over or is led on a rope. Whenever the caroler group entered a house, Turo≈Ñ jumps around, dancing and neighing like a donkey. Turo≈Ñ is especially fond of playing tricks on women, whom he chases around the house, provokes and sometimes hits with its jaw. During the carol singing Turo≈Ñ claps his jaw to the rhythm of the song and rings the bell on its neck. Turo≈Ñ's muzzle is made of thin wood, covered with rabbit skin and is big so it can swallow an apple whole or drink a glass of vodka in one shot. It is believed that the alcohol, consumed by the beast in nearly every visited household, makes its behavior insolent. Turo≈Ñ holds two sticks which he uses to smack the floor with every move, jumping over them and over the stools in the house as well. At some point an important moment in singing: the Turo≈Ñ faints, and then everyone tries to resuscitate it by massage, lighting hay as a kind of an incense, blowing wind under its tail, pouring vodka into the muzzle of effigy and undoing hexes. Turo≈Ñ recovers and begins to frolic again, which often announces the end of the visit. In each region of Poland, Turo≈Ñ differs in form. Cracow's Turo≈Ñ accompanies the carolers that are carrying a star during the Epiphany (6th of January). It follows the carolers and when they enter a household, Turo≈Ñ tackles anyone who stares for too long at the star or its bearers. In Kielce County, city folk walk around the village with an aurochs (also called as \\"turu≈Ñ\\") during the last week of Carnival. A similar custom is known in Tarn√≥w, where the Turo≈Ñ is accompanied by other figures: Tatar (Turkish man) and ≈ªyd (Jew). In Mielec, people walk with Turo≈Ñ on Christmas Eve. Whenever the Turo≈Ñ becomes unbearable for the householder and his family, they sing a song to banish it: Turo≈Ñ's head from Stary SƒÖcz Id≈∫, turoniu, do domu nie zawadzaj nikomu nie tu≈õ siƒô wychowa≈Ç nie tu bƒôdziesz nocowa≈Ç Which loosely translates as: Go now, Turo≈Ñ, go home Don't you bother any more souls Here's not the place you live This not the place you shall sleep After that song, the householder gives to the carolers a \\"get off ransom\\" in the form of money and a gift from the pantry. Then, the carolers thank for the treats and they go to the next house.  Etymology  According to Oskar Kolberg: \\"I recall a research about aurochs, brought up by a German ‚Äì Harius. Aurochs as an animal is a foreign name to the eastern languages and it refers to a bull ‚Äì hence it belongs to terminology and customs of pagan Slavic culture, in which the aurochs was an emblem of the Sun and in its name there was a holiday called Turzyce. Nonetheless Turu≈Ñ has to be considered as such; since the day of Christmas a new Sun is born, brighter and longer it shines with coming of a new summer.\\"  Symbolism  Turo≈Ñ is a symbol of fertility, a way of wishing through gestures. It pokes the householders with his horns to pass on the fertility.

Early life Born Dolores Theresa Sorour in Pretoria, South Africa, she decided to call herself Jackie after her sports heroine Jackie Rissik. She learned to fly and got her ‚ÄòA‚Äô flying licence, starting to fly aged just 15. By 17 she had become the first woman to do a parachute jump in South Africa. She moved to the United Kingdom in 1938 with the intention of getting her ‚ÄòB‚Äô flying licence with the Aeronautical College, Witney, Oxford. War-service Like many women interested in flying for the war effort she joined the Women's Auxiliary Air Force until she could join the Air Transport Auxiliary. Initially she was based in Rye in a radar station. She was recruited to the ATA by the Women's Commandant, Pauline Gower in July 1940. Moggridge was the youngest of the female pilots at the time. She flew more than 1,500 aircraft and 83 different types. Post-war As for all the women she left flying when the ATA closed down. Moggridge then married an army Lieut. Colonel and engineer, Reginald Moggridge, in Taunton, Somerset in 1945 with whom she had two daughters. She was involved with the local amateur dramatics societies but still wanted to fly. In 1949 she was commissioned into the Women's RAF Volunteer Reserve (WRAFVR), as a Pilot Officer. She qualified for her RAF wings in 1953. A result of her involvement in both dramatics and the reserve Moggridge was interviewed in 1950 by Richard Dimbleby for his radio show Down Your Way. Moggridge went on to gain her commercial pilot's licence in the 1950s as well. She worked ferrying Spitfires from Cypress to Rangoon, to the Indian Air Force and to Burma. After these jobs ended Moggridge looked for more flying opportunities. In 1957 LEC Refrigeration would fly demonstration versions of their fridges overseas for potential customers to view. Moggridge got the job of co-pilot and undertook the trip of 15,000 miles flying the fridges to South Africa. Next, Channel Airways was looking for a pilot for their operation based at Southend Airport. Moggridge applied but neglected to mention she was a woman. She got the interview and managed, using her impressive flying record, to get the job. Over time, she worked the Isle of Wight, Jersey and Guernsey routes. Awards and legacy For her war-service, the recently married First Officer Moggridge was awarded the King's Commendation for Valuable Service in the Air, as well as the standard medals.https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/37412/supplement/338/data.pdf In addition, she was later awarded the Coronation medal: at the time, these medals were not a universal issue, so to have been selected for one of the limited allocation was itself a further recognition of merit. She was awarded the Jean Lennox Bird Trophy by the British Women Pilots‚Äô Association in 1959. She created the Jackie Moggridge Cup, which is awarded to a British woman pilot for achieving excellent qualifications. Moggridge wrote a book about her experiences, originally published in 1957 as Now republished as ‚ÄòSpitfire Girl ‚Äì My Life in the Sky‚Äô. First five Jean Bird, Benedetta Willis, Jackie Moggridge, Freydis Leaf and Joan Hughes were the first five women to be awarded their wings. The next didn't gain wings until Julie Ann Gibson in 1991.

Sellers used slogans to praise their products. For a long time, bambino was the only kind of ice cream on a stick sold in the country.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It is now Woodard Station Lofts. History By 1900, Lyman Woodard's Furniture and Casket Company had grown large enough to warrant constructing an additional building. Woodard built a large four story brick factory building directly adjacent to his existing plant, and began equipping it. Unfortunately, demand for finished wood products began to decline. In 1904, Lyman Woodard died, causing a crisis at the firm. However, Woodard's son, Lee, stepped in to restore the company's health. When woodworking products failed to revive the company, Woodard turned to metal furniture, and converted the factory's equipment. By the mid-1920s, Woodard was again prominent in the furniture-making business, and began constructing an addition to the factory. However, the Great Depression took its toll, and by 1942 the Woodard Furniture Company had liquidated its assets. In 1942, Lee Woodard converted the factory to make components for the war effort. After the war, he resumed furniture production, concentrating on metal furniture. Production continued for the next few decades, and in 1995, the company moved its factory and offices into a new building. Later the original 1900 building was converted into loft housing, containing commercial space and residential lofts. Description The Lee Woodard and Sons Building is a large four story brick factory. The building has tripled sets of four-over-four double hung sash windows in bowed arch brick openings. The only details on the exterior are brick pilasters at two bay intervals, and a simple dentilated brick corniceline.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. History Closeup of entrance Lyman E. Woodard was an architect and builder from New York. In 1866, he moved to Owosso and opened a wood sash, blind, and door manufacturing company, the first of many woodworking companies to establish themselves in Owosso. Through the 1870s and 1880s, Woodard grew his business to include furniture and caskets in addition to sash, blinds, and doors. He also undertook an aggressive advertising campaign that was to make his products known throughout the United States. To increase his clientele, Woodard diversified his product line to produce similar item in varying quality and price, so that a consumer could purchase a simple pine bedstead, or an elaborately carved ash or walnut unit. In 1885, Woodard's Furniture and Casket Company had grown large enough that he constructed a new facility to house it at the corner of Cass and South Elm Streets. In 1888, a large section of the new factory complex burned, but was rebuilt by Woodard later the same year. Lyman Woodard died in 1904, and the business passed to his sons Frank, Fred, and Lee Woodard. They dropped the sash and door products to concentrate on furniture and caskets. By the 1910s, the flu epidemic created a booming casket business, and by the 1920s the Owosso Casket Company was the world's largest casket maker. However, the Great Depression took its toll on the businesses, and by 1942 both the Woodard Casket Company and Furniture Company had liquidated assets, with Lee Woodard starting a new line of metal furniture. The Woodard Furniture Company remained nearby until 1995, when moved its factory and offices into a new building. As of 2015, the former Casket Company Building remained substantially vacant.

Lebeaut and Ch. de Trogoff. It was first performed at the Th√©√¢tre des Bouffes-Parisiens, Paris, on 28 February 1896. The opera depicts the complicated but ultimately successful course of true love between two French couples in the reign of Louis XIII. The two leading characters, Cyrano de Bergerac and Ninon de Lenclos, are loosely based on historical figures. This fictionalisation of Cyrano preceded, and is quite different from, Edmond Rostand's well-known version, which was written the following year. Background and performance history In the 1870s Lecocq had supplanted Jacques Offenbach as Paris's favourite composer of comic operas, and had continued to enjoy frequent successes into the 1880s. After Le coeur et la main in 1882, success proved elusive. None of his nine subsequent operas had rivalled the popularity of his earlier works.Lamb, Andrew. \\"Lecocq, (Alexandre) Charles\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, 2001.

Retrieved 13 November 2018 In his new opera Lecocq avoided his frequent theme of confused and farcical wedding nights and turned to a more romantic story, set in 17th-century Paris, and featuring dramatised versions of two historical characters, Cyrano de Bergerac and Ninon de Lenclos, the \\"Ninette\\"of the title. The opera was staged before Edmond Rostand's play about Cyrano, which was written the following year. The Cyrano presented by Lecocq's librettists differs considerably from Rostand's version, being a dashing, confident and good-looking hero.

Cyrano de Bergerac, the famous poet and duellist, loves and is loved by Ninon de l'Enclos (Ninette), a famous Parisian beauty. The two have exchanged letters, each containing vows of eternal fidelity, and they have agreed that if either breaks their pact he or she must return the promissory note to the other. At the Place Royale, the fashionable Paris square, Cyrano gets into a quarrel with a young provincial gentleman, Gontran de Chavennes, who has just arrived in Paris for the first time. Gontran has made the acquaintance of Diane de Gassion, daughter of the eminent marshal. The young couple have fallen in love with each other, and have arranged to meet in Paris, at the Place Royale. Diane having been entrusted by her father to the care of a fussy old guardian, M√©licerte, Gontran has come to make a formal request for her hand, but unluckily he asks Cyrano to show him his way, and the latter, taking offence at an innocently meant remark, starts a sword fight, and Gontran is wounded. The watchman appears and Cyrano starts a hasty escape. As he does so he sees his beloved Ninette coming to the aid of the wounded Gontran, whom she takes to her house. Diane arrives at the same time. Both she and Cyrano misread the situation and imagine that there is some romantic attraction between Ninon and Gaston. Diane and Cyrano are so furious with jealousy that they impulsively agree to marry each other. He wants to marry her immediately, but Diane makes it a condition that they wait thirty days, during which he must not fight anybody. M√©licerte appears on the scene and Cyrano asks him for the hand of his ward. At this point the authorities catch up with the duellists, and Cyrano is sent to fight in the army and Gontran is taken to the Bastille. Act II: Ninon's house By her influence in high quarters Ninon is able to secure Gontran's release. She has taken a distinct fancy to him, and Cyrano is half forgotten. In Gontran's honour she gives a brilliant f√™te. Cyrano, in accordance with their pact, comes to return Ninon's billet doux, and she is ready to surrender his in exchange, but at this critical moment they both realise that they have never ceased to love each other. Gontran's affection for Diane has not cooled in the least, and despite her jealousy she remains in love with him. Act III: Picpus, near Paris The duel at Picpus The thirty days have almost elapsed and Cyrano has duly restrained himself from duelling, in accordance with his undertaking. By the terms of their agreement, he and Diane must now marry each other. Neither now wishes to go ahead, but both feel that honour requires it. Ninon takes matters in hand. She conceals Cyrano so that he may overhear a tender meeting between Diane and Gontran which she has arranged at her house. Once Cyrano realises, to his relief, that Diane still remains in love with Gontran, he takes the obvious step to free her from engagement to him: he fights a duel. He crosses swords with his drunken friend Rouffignac, who has chosen this convenient moment to pick a fight. By duelling, Cyrano breaches the conditions of his engagement, and the two couples are free to marry their true loves.\\"The Drama in Paris\\", The Era, 7 March 1896, p. 13 Numbers=Act I= *Ch≈ìur ‚Äì Bourgeois, soldats, seigneurs (Middle classes, soldiers, lords) *Couplets ‚Äì Ah! la bonne plaisanterie (Ah, the good joke ‚Äì Diane) *Ch≈ìur ‚Äì Place, place, place (Make way!) *Couplets ‚Äì Vous m'aimez tous (You all love me ‚Äì Ninon) *Duo ‚Äì Cela me plait ‚Äì (I live it ‚Äì Ninon, Cyrano) *Madrigal ‚Äì Jaloux de vous (Jealous of you ‚Äì Ninon, Cyrano) *Couplets J'ai pris, avec ma malle (I took, with my luggage ‚Äì Gontran) *Sc√®ne du duel ‚Äì Au nom du Roi (In the King's name ‚Äì L'exempt, Cyrano, Rouffignac, Ch≈ìur) *Quatuor ‚Äì Allons, tenez-vous en repos (Come on, rest ‚Äì Diane, Ninon, Gontran, Cyrano) *Finale ‚Äì Soldats valeureux (Valiant soldiers) **Chanson Militaire ‚Äì La guerre et l'amour (War and love ‚Äì Cyrano) =Act II= *Entr'acte‚Äìpavane *Air ‚Äì Mouzon est une ville forte (Mouzon is a strong city ‚Äì Rouffignac) *Couplets ‚Äì C'est de doux mots (It's sweet talk ‚Äì Gontran) *Duetto ‚Äì Tant de charmes (So many charms ‚Äì Diane, Ninon) *Duo ‚Äì C'est qu'elle est charmante (She is so charming ‚Äì Ninon, Cyrano) *Quintette ‚Äì Trahison (Treachery ‚Äì Ninon, Gontran, M√©licerte, Cyrano) *Finale ‚Äì Pour √©couter les vers (To listen to the verses) **Idylle ‚Äì Avez-vous vu par les pr√©s (Have you seen, through the meadows ‚Äì Ninon) **Chanson du pont ‚Äì Un beau mousquetaire ‚Äì (A handsome musketeer ‚Äì Ninon) =Act III= *Entr'acte *Terzetto ‚Äì Trente jours sont pass√©s (Thirty days have passed ‚Äì Diane, M√©licerte, Cyrano) *Couplets ‚Äì De votre serin, √¥ Sylvie (Your legs, O Sylive ‚Äì M√©licerte) *Romance ‚Äì C'est Ninette (It is Ninette ‚Äì Cyrano) *Ch≈ìur ‚Äì Sens tarder davantage (Delay more) *Sc√®ne ‚Äì Deux fianc√©s (Two finac√©s ‚Äì Ninon) *Duettino ‚Äì Ah! que s'aimer (Ah, what love ‚Äì Diane, Gontran) *Couplets ‚Äì Allez, monsieur (Come on, Monsieur ‚Äì Ninon) *Terzetto ‚Äì Ah!

Marasmius undatus) is a small mushroom which grows on fern rhizomes. Description The species can be described as follows: *The cap has a powdery covering (a pruina), is initially whitish and convex and later becomes brownish grey and expands to be flat. It grows to about 2.5 cm in diameter. *The gills are whitish and distant, and broadly adnate to the stem, or slightly decurrent. The spore powder is white. *The rigid stem can grow to about 12 cm long by about 2 mm in diameter. It is white at the top and dark brown to black lower down, with a puinose covering of short white hairs. *The smell and taste are not distinctive. *The spores are lemon-shaped to ellipsoid and measure roughly 9-12 ¬µm x 5-7 ¬µm. Naming and related species The species epithet undatus, meaning \\"wavy\\", is the past participle of the Latin verb \\"undo\\" (= \\"I undulate\\"). This species was originally described in 1836 as Agaricus undatus by Miles Joseph Berkeley. As it happened, in 1838 the famous mycologist Elias Magnus Fries defined a completely different mushroom (now Entoloma undatum) under the same name, but due to the nomenclatural rules of precedence, that definition is illegitimate. This was confirmed when in 1849 Fries renamed Berkeley's fungus with the combination Marasmius undatus, a name which was current for more than a century. Then in 2000 it was one of the two initial species with which R. H. Petersen created the new genus Rhizomarasmius, the other one being the type species R. pyrrhocephalus. Ecology and distribution This mushroom grows on rhizomes of bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) and probably other ferns. It is widespread but rare in northern and western Europe and has been reported from North Africa, North America, and the Altai mountains.

It was formed on 27 November 1917 and existed until 22 February 1918. It was a secular republic, headed by a president. It was one of the first secular states where the majority of the population were Muslims. It was the first democratic state in the history of Central Asia. The capital of the state was Kokand, which until then was the capital of the Kokand Khanate. There were 5 official languages: Uzbek, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tajik and Russian. The population was about 5 million people, mostly Uzbeks and Kazakhs, as well as Kyrgyz, Tajiks, Russians and others.  History  The Turkestan Autonomy occupied former territories of the Russian Empire, which was called the Turkestan Krai or the Russian Turkestan, more particular parts of the Semirechye, Syr-Darya and Fergana Oblasts (Provinces). From the north it bordered on the Alash Autonomy, from the east on the Republic of China, from the south on the Emirate of Afghanistan, from the south-west on the Emirate of Bukhara, on the west and north-west on the Soviet Central Asian Regions. The state was created by Jadids and . The government of Turkestan autonomy in January announced its intention to convene its parliament on 20 March 1918, on the basis of universal, direct, equal and secret ballot. Two-thirds of the seats in parliament were intended for Muslim deputies, and one-third was guaranteed to representatives of the non-Muslim population. This was a good decision ‚Äì such a parliament would undoubtedly unite all citizens of Turkestan and would become an insurmountable obstacle for the Bolsheviks. The existence of such a parliament was to be the first step towards the democratization of Turkestan. In January 1918, in response to an ultimatum from the Soviets on the voluntary inclusion into Soviet Russia, Mustafa Shokay refused to recognize the authority of the Soviets. For the destruction of the self-proclaimed Turkestan Autonomy, 11 trains with troops and artillery under the command of arrived from Moscow in Tashkent. As a result of hostilities, thousands of civilians were killed. Thus, the Turkestan autonomy was liquidated by the Bolsheviks only 3 months after its creation. it was replaced by Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. In November 1917, Muhamedzhan Tynyshpaev was the first president of the state. The second and last president was Mustafa Shokay.

History  The church is the fourth building on the site on the village green in Bedford. The cornerstone was laid and services celebrating the dedication of the then-most- recently-restored building were held in 1872. The first minister, Reverend Thomas Denham, settled in 1684, and a meeting house was built in 1689. When Bedford became part of New York, this house was transferred to Rye, New York. Bedford was part of the Anglican Church until the Revolution. A second meeting house was burned by order of a British colonel in 1779. A third house was transferred to Westmoreland Sanctuary. The fourth building, the present church, was built in 1872, with a Sunday school in the rear. It was described as It is part of the Bedford Village Historic District, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in northern Westchester County in 1973.

Life Ernest James Harrell was the son of William and Arrilla Harrell. Harrell had two sisters and one brother. Harrell was married to Paola Harrell for 53 years and had a son, Ernest III Harrell and a daughter, Jolene (Demetrius) Hamm. A Memorial Service was held at Omni Tucson National Resort on 2 May 2015 at 4:00 p.m. Ernest James Harrel was interred at Arlington National Cemetery with full military honours on August 18, 2015. Academic career Harrell attended high school, in his native city Selma, Alabama, but dropped out to serve a few more years of military service, which was already mandatory for him at the time in the U.S., at Tuskegee Institute, now Tuskegee University, Alabama. At Tuskegee, Harrell states that he initially looked for the least demanding courses and declared himself an interior decorating major. But after his freshman year, and with the help and support from his fraternity brothers from Omega Psi Phi fraternity and Sigma Pi Phi (Boul√©), he switched to building construction after realising there were few opportunities in his initial decision. Harrell claims he never regretted his decision. Travels Harrell travelled all around the globe, most of the time due to military service. He served in the Vietnam War during the mid-1970s. He was later stationed in other Asian countries for another couple of years. Some of these places included: Thailand, Okinawa and South Korea. He then served in Germany (West Germany at the time) during the late 1980s before the fall of the Berlin Wall on 13 June 1990. Engineering & Military Career After graduating in 1960 at Tuskegee Institute (University), Harrell earned a Master of Science in Engineering from Arizona State University. He then consequently joined the (American Council on Education) ACE, as a ¬®natural progression¬®. After that he also spent some time as an instructor and then assistant professor of military science in Arizona State University in Tempe. A couple of years after he enrolled as a student at the university to earn his master's in engineering. During his command with the Ohio River division he developed a keen and advanced (for his time) interest for the environment: ‚ÄúIn the past, engineers would build any damn thing and it was left to lawyers and environmentalist, even to a great degree of pain to the engineering profession, to keep the balance. We are beginning to become concerned, but we need to do much better‚Äù. He later completed the National and International Security Management Program at John F. Kennedy School of Government in the early 70s. His last assignment, as Commanding General of the Army Corps' North Pacific Division, was based in Portland, Oregon during the early 90s. In 1998, he was hired by the City of St. Louis as the President of the Board of Public Services. Harrell oversaw the contracts for renovations to St. Louis Lambert International Airport. After completing his tenure for the Board of Public Services, he retired to Tucson. Achievements At age 52, Harrell's division of military engineers was responsible for more than $558 million in construction work in Europe in the 1980s.

The district, now home to a broad array of residential and civic architecture, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Description and history The town of Dunstable was incorporated in 1673, and originally covered a large area, from Milford, New Hampshire to Tyngsborough, Massachusetts. Early growth was slow, and the community remained predominantly agricultural into the mid-20th century. The town's boundaries were altered by splitting off neighboring towns (most recently Tyngsborough, Massachusetts in 1809) and the setting of the border between Massachusetts and New Hampshire in 1740. In 1753, the town's citizenry voted to build a new church on Meeting House Hill, about east of the current town center. That building was moved in 1791, prompted by a population shift in the rural community into western portions, and a schoolhouse was also built on the same parcel. Neither of these buildings survive, but the present Evangelical Church, a neo-Classical building dating to 1913, was built on the site, and an 1825 schoolhouse, converted for public works use, stands nearby. The district is centered at the four-way junction of Main, High, and Pleasant Streets, and is about in size. In addition to the church, civic buildings include Roby Memorial Hall, built in 1908 and serving as town hall, and the Classical Revival Union School, built in 1895. Three 18th-century houses survive from the center's early days, as does the 1754 cemetery, laid out to replace one located on Meeting House Hill.

Life Thusnelda von Saldern was born into a Protestant family in Potsdam. She and her twin sister were the eldest of their parents' five recorded children. Gustav von Saldern-Plattenburg, her father, was a \\"lord of the manor\\" and a Prussian district administrator from Brandenburg. Her mother, by birth a countess of Seherr-Tho√ü, came from one of the region's aristocratic families: it was on their mother's family lands that the children grew up, on the Meffersdorf estate (Lauban district). The family was one with close church connections and the children benefited from a traditional upper-class upbringing. Her first piece of written work, a translation for the theologian- publisher Johann Hinrich Wichern (1808-1881), appeared in 1854 when she was only 17. After completing her education, she undertook a training as a nurse at the \\"Bethanien\\" a Deaconesses' establishment in Breslau. Then, after her parents died, for some time she ran the household for her uncle before moving on to a Marienberg monastery for a further period of vocational training. From there she moved on again, to the Oberlin House in Potsdam. The recently founded Oberlin Association, named after the social reformer and evangelical minister Johann Friedrich Oberlin, had been set up to organise and promote the care and education of young children. She was recruited on 26 October 1879 as first deaconess and first \\"matron of the sisterhood\\" at the new Oberlin House. She had been working with the association since 1874, but it was only five years after that that they acquired their own purpose-built premises. Over the decades that followed she was responsible for training numerous young women and deaconesses for work in a range of social and diaconal fields. That included community care work, nursery school work, hospital/infirmary work and positions in care homes for physically handicapped and deaf-mute children. Nearly 150 years later the Oberlin House still occupies the same premises in Potsdam and continues to focus on the priorities that were established when Thusnelda von Saldern was in charge. In 1905 she retired from her position at Oberlin House, relocating to the \\"Buchenhaus\\" Hospice in Grenzdorf bei Weigandsthal (Silesia) where she worked as a \\"house mother\\". The establishment was one that she had herself set up as sister institution of the Oberlin House. In 1909 she moved to Hoym where she died the next year. Her body was buried on 16 May 1910, the Monday following Pentecost at the \\"Goethe Cemetery\\" (as it is known today) in Potsdam. Published output Thusnelda von Saldern wrote religiously inspired novels and stories, including novel Das Margaretenbuch, which was released under numerous new editions and was also translated into English. Celebration In 2007, the Oberlin Association opened a new accommodation and rehabilitation block for accident victims. The new building was named the Thusnelda-von-Saldern-Haus.Katalog der Deutschen Nationalbibliothek References 1837 births 1910 deaths People from Potsdam Deaconesses ","title":"Thusnelda von Saldern"},{"id":"59043314","text":"Dylan Godfrey (born September 22, 1992), better known by his stage name Lil Windex, is a Canadian rapper.

Initially a Portuguese Quartel de Infantaria (infantry barracks), the building became the home of the municipality of Dili administration in the late 1930s. During the Japanese occupation of Portuguese Timor, it was the Japanese general headquarters. It then reverted to being a Portuguese military facility until 1972, and was later taken over by the Indonesian military. Now the oldest building in the city centre, it has since been renovated and given its present name, and presently houses European diplomatic representatives. History The first building to be built on the site of Casa Europa was a rudimentary fortress dating from 1769. Although its official name was Fortaleza de Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o (\\"Fortress of Our Lady of the Conception\\"), it was better known as the Tranqueira (\\"Palisade\\"), because it was made of wood. Initiative for the replacement of that building with a more substantial structure came from a mid-nineteenth-century Governor of Portuguese Timor, (1834‚Äì1839). However, construction of the present building on the ruins of the fortress did not begin until 1871, five years after a fire had destroyed the fortress and devastated much of the city. Most of the building work was carried out between 1884 and 1899. In 1895, before the building was even completed, it was occupied as the Quartel de Infantaria (infantry barracks). By the 1930s, however, it had become too small for that function. Between 1937 and 1940, it was therefore the premises of the Dili municipal administration and the police services, including those of the indigenous cipaio (sepoy) contingent. During the Japanese occupation of Portuguese Timor from 1942 to 1945, the building housed the Japanese general headquarters, with the consequence that it escaped the destruction suffered by the rest of the city. After the Japanese surrender, the building reverted to the Portuguese military, as the barracks of the Ca√ßadores (\\"Rangers\\") regiment. In the 1960s, it was occupied by the Companhia de Intend√™ncia (Logistics and Services Detachment). It became vacant when the Detachment moved to in 1972, but was taken over by an Indonesian military unit following the Indonesian invasion of East Timor in 1975. In September 1999, during that year's East Timorese crisis, the building was heavily damaged by pro- Indonesian integrationist forces. Between 2000 and 2002, under the direction of the World Bank, a first renovation of the building was carried out. The main sponsors of that renovation were the European Commission and the European Union. Upon completion of the renovation, the Uma Fukun, the official cultural centre of East Timor, was set up in the building, complete with a library, video and didactic facilities and an auditorium. The irony of installing the new East Timor's cultural centre into the former military headquarters of its colonisers was not lost on anyone. In 2007, following another East Timorese crisis, the President of East Timor, Jos√© Ramos-Horta, and the East Timorese government decided that the European Commission could establish its new delegation in the building. On 24 November 2007, the President handed the building over to the President of the European Commission, Jos√© Manuel Dur√£o Barroso, and it was renamed Casa Europa. Between January and September 2008, the building was renovated a second time. On 24 November 2008, Casa Europa was officially inaugurated by Dr Ramos-Horta and the European Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, Louis Michel. Casa Europa is now the oldest building in Dili's city centre. The European Commission's delegation to East Timor moved into it in October 2008, but has since relocated. Casa Europa presently houses the offices of the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID) and the Bureau de la Coop√©ration of the French Representative Office. Since 2008, it has also hosted public exhibitions, seminars, events and film festivals organised by the European Commission. Architecture Casa Europa's design is sensitive to the local climate and lifestyle. Its masonry consists of stone, brick and plaster, and originally had a whitewashed finish. The building is made up of three modules, connected and arranged in a U-shape. Its north side facing the sea is open, an arrangement made possible only because of a coral reef that gave the area natural protection from landings from enemy ships. The U-shaped configuration promotes transverse ventilation and illumination. The building is single- storey with a high ceiling. Its two lateral wings are topped with full length gable roofs, each featuring upright projections overlooking the street and the parade ground. Both wings have cornices and mouldings, nineteenth-century style casement windows facing the parade ground and sash windows opening onto the street. The central section has a symmetrical composition with an overhang borne on four columns denoting the main entrance, and is similarly fitted with a gable roof.

The name means \\"church of the confluence\\"; the word Domhnach (from Latin dominica, \\"of the Lord\\") is traditionally assumed (due to a note in the 9th- century Book of Armagh) to belong to the earliest churches in Ireland. The River Shinkeen, a small stream, enters the River Liffey 550 m to the north of Donaghcumper. A Domnach Combair appears in the Vita tripartita Sancti Patricii (9th century), although that appears to be located in D√°l nAraidi, in the northeast of Ireland. The earliest part of the church was built c. 1150‚Äì60, around the time of the Norman invasion of Ireland. In 1202 control of the church was given to St. Wolstan's Priory by the de Hereford family (Adam de Hereford and descendants). Cut-stone windows were added in the 14th century (c. 1340). The church was suppressed in the Reformation and the lands acquired by John Alan, Lord Chancellor of Ireland. He was buried at Donaghcumper in 1561, as was his nephew John Alen in 1616, and John's son Sir Thomas Alen, 1st Baronet in 1627. Donaghcumper became a Church of Ireland (Anglican Protestant) church and was active for about 200 years. In 1690, a James Warren was parish priest. A sketch of 1770 shows the church with a roof and a tower in the west end. A map of 1783 lists the site as Ch. Rs. (church ruins) and the 1897 map lists it as ruinous. However, the church is surrounded by a still-active graveyard; the earliest-dated grave still legible is that of a Nicholas Walsh, died 1711. In 2000 some renovation took place, and in 2017 funding of ‚Ç¨7,500 was allocated. Buildings Porch in the south wall. Portions of the nave and chancel remain. The Alen vault is located at the east end of the chancel. The east gable has an ogee window, and the west gable has a belfry. A round semicircular arch divides nave and chancel, and there is a gabled porch in the south end and a piscina in the east. Of the tower in the west, only one wall remains. The buildings are held up by temporary buttresses and the church is fenced off to avoid injury to the public.

Her family was well to do and owned several properties including a successful jersey cattle stud at Clarendon Eyre named after the family home in Malvern, and a property in Bulleen near the Yarra River. With her family's support Jackson Morris attended the National Gallery School Art School, Melbourne from 1910 until 1920. During that time she illustrated works and exhibited with the Victorian Artists' Society. She worked alongside artists such as Harold Gaze and Ethel Spowers. She published her first book for children in 1909 when she was just 17. In 1915 she contributed work to Dame Nellie Melba‚Äôs book of Australian art and literature. Her second book was released in 1921 and critically received. The same year she also held a solo exhibition at the Fine Art Society's Gallery.

He holds an honorary Professorship at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and a Ph.D. in immunology from the University of York.  Life  Kariuki grew up in Kenya where he witnessed firsthand the benefits of increasing accessibility to technology; many homes in his childhood village did not have electricity or running water. He notes that the roads in his home village are still not paved. He obtained his undergraduate degree from the University of Nairobi and credits his good education for his successes. Kariuki considers education the greatest gift that a child growing up in Africa can receive. In 2004, Kariuki was awarded a Ph.D. in immunology from the University of York under the mentorship of Alan Wilson, titled Vaccination strategies against schistosomes in a primate model. He is married with two daughters.  Career  Kariuki served for seven years as director of the Institute of Primate Research and the National Museums of Kenya in biomedical research and conservation biology. His research includes the study of infectious diseases, and enabling the development of vaccines for diseases that affect areas of poverty such as investigating the influence of worm infections on vaccination outcomes. He has conducted research on the diagnostic development for schistosomiasis (Bilharzia), malaria and co- infections. He worked with David Molyneux researching neglected tropical diseases and has collaborated with Imelda Bates. As part of his role with The African Academy of Sciences, Kariuki spreads awareness about the rise of non- communicable diseases in Africa such as cancer, strokes, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, particularly between the ages of 30 and 70; ‚ÄúAfrica is a young continent. We have the youngest people globally. We don‚Äôt know if the rapid growth across the continent is going to be a dividend or a nightmare,‚Äù After nearly two decades in biomedical research as a scientist, Kariuki refocused his efforts into shaping policy and managing global partnership programmes. On March 7, 2017, Kariuki became the interim director of The African Academy of Sciences, following his previous role as The AAS Treasurer between 2013‚Äì2014. Kariuki shortly transitioned into his current role as Director of Programmes at The African Academy of Sciences where Kariuki leads the Alliance for Accelerating Excellence in Science in Africa (AESA), originally established in 2015 by The AAS and the NEPAD to address the funding and needs for the various health and development challenges in Africa. This transition was not easy, as Kariuki comments ‚ÄúHaving created AESA as an agenda setting and funding platform, the shoe is now on the other foot, and I now have to dispense the same narrative and funders‚Äô ethos to my old laboratory bench comrades, and hope they will not feel talked down to and estranged like I would occasionally feel when I dealt with funders.‚Äù The AESA works in partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the NEPAD on the project Grand Challenges Africa. In an article written by Kariuki and Steven Buchsbaum, Kariuki comments that ‚Äúthe best way to make life better for Africans is to support great ideas from African innovators.‚Äù In 2016, the Planet Earth Institute named Kariuki as a top 10 African Science Hero due to his ‚Äúdogged work to train and empower world-class African scientists‚Äù through his role in AESA and beyond. This includes AESA's role in managing and running the DELTAS Africa project with support from the Wellcome Trust and the UK's Department for International Development and the NEPAD, as well as managing phase 2 of the H3Africa programme. In 2017 the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine awarded Kariuki an honorary professorship in recognition of his past and present collaborations with the school, and his efforts to \\"accelerate world-class research, foster innovation and promote scientific leadership in Africa\\". Kariuki sits on the advisory board for Gates Open Research, a platform for publication and open peer review of research funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. He has previously held the position of President of the Federation of African Immunological Societies and served on the Education Committee of the International Union of Immunological Societies. As part of his role in advocating African science, Kariuki regularly speaks to at international conferences including the World Health Summit (Innovation for Impact Panel Discussion, 2018), the Next Einstein Forum (Learning to lead: what capacities do scientists and researchers of tomorrow need, 2018), and the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting (Laying the groundwork for research and innovation, 2017).  Outreach  Kariuki has spoken about the need to encourage young Africans into science careers due to 60% of the population being below 30 years old. His work with AESA addresses some of Africa's most pressing development challenges through capacity building, training, and funding. In an interview with Planet Earth Institute, he highlights examples of these development challenges such as disease, access to water and food insecurity, and poor infrastructure. Also of note is climate change and changing weather patterns. Kariuki believes a measure of success will be ‚Äúhow many young, bright, brilliant scientists are actually living, working and thriving in Africa.‚Äù As part of this push for young African scientists, Kariuki is involved in school programmes to educate young people about science where he uses the example of Louis Pasteur to encourage curiosity, observation, and creativity.

Initially, it was going irregularly, but after the publication of a special decree on January 28, 1769, discussions were happening 1‚Äì2 times a week. After the conclusion of the Treaty of K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca, the basis for the work of the council ceased, but it continued to act as an advisory institution not only on matters of military and foreign, but also domestic policy (among others, it heard questions about the reform of the local government system and class structure, measures to suppress Pugachev's Rebellion). Under Paul I, the council lost any meaning, and at the end of 1800 it stopped its meetings. It was abolished on April 7, 1801 by Alexander I. It was a deliberative body that did not have established powers and carried out office work through the private office of the secretaries of the empress or emperor. All proposals developed by the council, if adopted, were drawn up in the form of decrees and manifestos of the sovereign. The initial composition of the council When the council at the Highest Court was formed, it included: *Prosecutor General of the Senate, Prince Alexander Vyazemsky (retired in 1792); *Vice-Chancellor, Prince Alexander Golitsyn (retired in 1778); *General-in-chief, Prince Alexander Golitsyn (died in 1783); *Adjutant general, Count Grigory Orlov (died in 1783); *Senior member of the Collegium of Foreign Affairs, Count Nikita Panin (died in 1783); *General-in-chief, Count Petr Panin (due to illness, retired in 1775); *Field marshal, president of the Imperial Academy of Sciences and Arts, Count Kirill Razumovski (retired in the early 1770s); *General-in-chief, president of the College of War, Count Zakhar Chernyshyov (died in 1784).

While redevelopment efforts in the area had already begun as early as 2014, the cross-jurisdictional neighborhood was branded and announced as \\"National Landing\\" in 2018 as a part of local economic development plans to bring Amazon HQ2 to the area. The announcement also included plans to build a graduate- school satellite university campus of Virginia Tech in the area. The \\"National Landing\\" name derives, in part, from the area's proximity to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Branding campaign When the name \\"National Landing\\" was announced on November 13, 2018 in concert with the Amazon HQ2 launch, it was met with significant confusion, and mockery since locals had never heard this name before and did not feel that \\"National Landing\\" was a real place. Prior to the Amazon announcement, \\"National Landing\\" was not used by locals. While initial comments suggested Amazon was changing the name of Crystal City unilaterally, local officials explained that the region included more than just Crystal City, and that the name and branding campaign came from the local jurisdictions and their economic development committees (Arlington Economic Development and the Alexandria Economic Development Partnership), in partnership with Amazon and developer JBG Smith. The rebranding is not expected to change the names of the existing neighborhoods, like Crystal City, but instead to serve as an umbrella term.

StonebridgeCarras, on behalf of landowner The Blackstone Group was employed to redevelop the Oakville Triangle, a 20-acre industrial park. Consultations about the Oakville Triangle development began with the local community groups in 2014 with groundbreaking to occur summer of 2017 and first 1 million-square-foot phase to open in Summer 2019. In March 2018, the Oakville Triangle project reportedly stalled, while Virginia Tech officials met with Amazon to discuss \\"Project Cooper,\\" Virginia Tech's plan for an \\"innovation neighborhood.\\" On November 3, 2018, Virginia Tech signed a memorandum of understanding with the City of Alexandria to put its new Innovation Center at Oakville Triangle, a decision announced in tandem with the HQ2 announcement on November 13. =Potomac Yard redevelopment= In Summer 2015, developer JBG Companies indicated a desire to begin the process for redevelopment of North Potomac Yard. In June 2016, Alexandria completed revisions to the 2010 plan and adopted a new the North Potomac Yard Small Area Plan. This plan included plans for a new Metro station, the Potomac Yard station. The plan also \\"anticipates approximately 1.3 million square feet of mixed-use development to include office, hotel, residential, and concentrated areas of retail within a 1/4 mile of the new Metrorail station.\\"  Transportation The area includes an existing Washington Metro station at Crystal City as well as the planned Potomac Yard station. The Virginia Railway Express (VRE) commuter rail system also has a Crystal City station. The Metroway, a bus rapid transit, runs through the area, with 15 stations covering the area from Arlington's Pentagon City station to Alexandria's Braddock Road station (south of National Landing), with some of this route located in an exclusive busway. Future planning for the area includes a pedestrian bridge to connect National Landing to Reagan National Airport and improvements to the existing Metro rail stations.

He was particularly well known for The Gothic Flame: being a history of the Gothic Novel in England and The Evergreen Tree of Diabolical Knowledge, and also for making available hundreds of Gothic tales.  Early life and education  Devendra Prasad Varma was born in Darbhanga, India, in October 1923. He studied at Patna College, where he was strongly influenced by his English professors, and later went to obtain a PhD at the University of Leeds under Professor G. Wilson Knight. In 1968, Varma had also \\"received a ‚Äòdistinction of honor‚Äô from the State of California and a fellowship for ‚Äòoutstanding ability and signal evidence of scholarship and proficiency in research\\" from a subsidiary of the degree mill Sequoia University. An anecdote Varma used to tell sums up his lifelong Gothic quest: One day, he was walking in the foothills of the Himalayas and saw among the wares of a poor bookseller laid out by the roadside a tattered copy of a Gothic novel so scarce that none of the world's great collections possessed a copy. Varma joined the 6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles regiment and fought for the British Indian Army during World War II. Varma was wounded during an airborne and amphibious attack on Rangoon by British, American and Indian forces during the Burma Campaign (April‚ÄìMay, 1945). The attack was dubbed Operation Dracula.  Career  Varma taught in India, Nepal, Syria and Egypt before moving to Canada where he became a lecturer at Dalhousie University in 1963 and then full professor in 1969. In 1957, Varma's book The Gothic Flame was published. Herbert Read said in an introduction that in this work, Varma \\"rescued a dream literature from oblivion\\". Based on his work in this book, Varma has been credited as one of the first to distinguish between terror and horror. During Varma's career, he oversaw publication of hundreds of Gothic tales, many of which were rare or dismembered. He was noted for saying of this work: \\"My researches are archival... You'll find 40 pages in one treasure room, another 50 with a collector, the title page somewhere else.\\" Varma was particularly interested in vampires. He wrote the introduction to the reprint of Varney the Vampire and, in 1973, he travelled to Castle Dracula to research Bram Stoker's novel. Varma edited the seven volumes of \\"horrid novels\\" mentioned in Northanger Abbey when they were reissued by the Folio Society in the 1960s. In 1977, Varma was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal for contributing to education and the arts. He was also recognised by the International Association for the Fantastic in the Arts in 1993. Varma retired in 1991 and died of a stroke whilst on a lecture tour in Oceanside, New York in 1994. He was survived by his son, Hemen, and two grandchildren, Tami and Robin.  Commemoration  The Department of English at Dalhousie holds an annual \\"Varma celebration\\" at Halloween. The Varma Prize in Gothic Literature was established to celebrate Gothic and horror tales.

Hark√°nyi was first to determine the temperatures (in 1902) and the diameters (in 1910) of individual stars other than the Sun. Biography Hark√°nyi was born in Budapest in a prosperous noble family. From 1895 the family held the title of Baron. After finishing secondary school and three years of undergraduate studies in Budapest, B√©la Hark√°nyi went on to study one year in Leipzig, then in Strasbourg (teachers: F. Kohlrausch, E. Cohn, H. Kobold), occasionally visiting major astronomical institutes in Germany and the USA, including Lick Observatory. He obtained his PhD in 1896 at the Royal Hungarian University of Sciences in Budapest. Next he spent two years at the Observatory of Paris with postgraduate studies, attending, among others, Poincar√©'s university lectures. In the first half of 1899 he worked in the Observatory of Potsdam under J. F. Hartmann, following which he started work in the astronomical observatory of Mikl√≥s Konkoly-Thege in √ìgyalla. Here he conducted observational photometry while he also developed an interest in theoretical astrophysics, under the influence of his friend and associate, Rad√≥ K√∂vesligethy. He also collaborated with Lor√°nd E√∂tv√∂s in the gravivariometric experiments in 1901. In 1903 he left √ìgyalla and moved back to Budapest, where from 1907 he became Privatdozent in the Institute for Cosmography and Geophysics of the university, led by Rad√≥ K√∂vesligethy. In 1911 he was elected a corresponding member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. In the political upheaval following Austria-Hungary's 1918 military collapse, Hark√°nyi was briefly nominated to be full professor during the short-lived communist dictatorship of 1919. In the aftermath, however, this promotion was declared void together with all other measures introduced by the communist regime. Together with Hark√°nyi's non-pushy character and his financial self-reliance, this episode may have played a role in that, despite his achievements, Hark√°nyi was never appointed to a university chair. Contemporaries describe Hark√°nyi as a reclusive personality with an extensive, encyclopaedic knowledge and a strong critical streak. Scientific achievements Hark√°nyi's most outstanding result was the first determination of the surface temperature for individual stars other than the Sun. Prior to 1902, when his relevant study was published, data only existed for the Sun's effective temperature. The range of temperatures of other stars had very roughly been bracketed by Scheiner in 1894. Hark√°nyi realized that the recent success in determining the form of blackbody spectrum offered a way to determine stellar temperatures by fitting the blackbody curve to spectrophotometric observations of stars to determine the location of the maximum of the blackbody curve, from which the temperature follows applying Wien's displacement law. It is notable that this method works even if the maximum is outside the spectral range of observations. Using Vogel's (1880) spectrophotometric data, available at 7 or 8 wavelength values, Hark√°nyi performed the fit and obtained Wien temperatures for 5 stars (Sirius, Vega, Arcturus, Aldebaran, and Betelgeuze). The values obtained tend to be on the low side by 500/2500 K for late/early type stars, respectively. Sources of the error include errors in the observational data; application of the Wien approximation instead of the full Planck blackbody spectrum; and a very rough extinction correction. Nevertheless, it took decades until the temperatures of these stars could be nailed down with significantly better precision. In 1910 he further developed an earlier result by R. K√∂vesligethy, deriving the relation between colour temperature and surface brightness of a star in the visual domain. Comparing this value with the absolute magnitudes of stars with known parallax, he was able to derive estimates for the physical sizes and apparent angular diameters of 17 stars for the first time. Hark√°nyi was also involved in photometric studies of variable stars and empirical studies of the relation between stellar temperatures, spectral types and absolute magnitudes. He also pointed out the existence of stars below the main sequence of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, later known as subdwarfs.

It has only ever belonged to two families: the Hutchison family, who built it, and the Marshall family, who acquired it 130 years later.  Architecture  The castle was built to the designs of David Rhind the noted Scottish architect. However, Rhind is best known for his commercial and civic building designs and took on very few domestic projects during his lifetime. Carlowrie Castle is therefore exceptional, both in its own right and as a rare example of Rhind's domestic work in the Scots baronial style. In 1873 Rhind was invited back to Carlowrie to design outhouses and a gate lodge for the castle. The castle is situated within the grounds of a 32-acre estate with its own deer herd. Philpot, Glyn Warren; Sir Thomas Hutchison, Lord Provost of Edinburgh (1921‚Äì1923); City of Edinburgh Council  The Hutchison family  Carlowrie Castle was commissioned by Thomas Hutchison, a prosperous wine merchant and the Provost of Leith. He intended it to be his new family home. Thomas was never to see the castle completed as he died in 1852, leaving his son Robert to complete the project. The castle cost ¬£33,000 to build, a considerable fortune at the time. The Hutchisons had long-standing and successful trade connections in the port town of Leith and had risen to prominence as a result of their success. Robert Hutchison, Thomas's heir responsible for completing the castle, was a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and an expert in arboriculture, leaving the wine trade behind. Two of his sons were knighted for their contributions to the realm: Sir Robert Hutchison, First Baronet of Thurle in Streatly in the County of Berkshire, a respected medical authority and the President of the Royal College of Physicians and Sir Thomas Hutchison, Lord Provost of Edinburgh, First Baronet of Hardiston in the County of Kinross, who held the office from 1921‚Äì1923. Robert's niece was the renowned Arctic explorer and botanist Isobel Wylie Hutchison. Unlike Robert Hutchison, his younger brother Thomas Hutchison (Isobel Wylie Hutchison's father) devoted himself to the wine trade in the family tradition. Having spent time in India where he set about expanding the business and amassed considerable wealth, he returned and married at the age of 40. For the first few years of his marriage, he lived with his wife at his family's former home of Glendevon House where their eldest two children Nita and Walter were born. However, Thomas's elder brother's lifestyle and academic pursuits had exhausted the family's fortunes and they had fallen into debt. In 1888, to rescue the reputation of the family and the home where he had grown up, Thomas paid off his brother's debts and took over Carlowrie Castle. Isobel Wylie Hutchison was the first of his children to be born there on 30th May 1889. Two further children were born at the castle, and Carlowrie remained with this branch of the Hutchison family until Isobel's death and subsequent sale of the property in 1982. Isobel Wylie Hutchison in an eskimo coat on expedition  Carlowrie Castle in the twentieth century  The twentieth century was a tumultuous period for the castle. Thomas Hutchison passed away in 1900 after contracting a chill that rapidly developed into pneumonia. He was soon followed by his two sons, one to World War One and the other to a mountaineering accident. The tragedies left scars on the family that were never to heal fully, but in their own way contributed to the burgeoning career of Isobel Wylie Hutchison, endowing her with the independent financial means to fund her expeditions and enabling her to defy convention, steadfastly refusing to marry and settle down. Isobel was awarded the Mungo Park Medal by the Royal Scottish Geographical Society, for whom she later acted as Vice President. The castle was requisitioned in World War Two and used as a military base. By this point, Isobel was earning an independent income from the books and lectures she presented based on her adventures, and for the botanical specimens that she provided to collectors, museums and botanic gardens. Expeditions aside, Isobel lived at Carlowrie Castle and tended to the grounds throughout her life. She remained at the castle until her death in 1982 at the age of 93.  The Marshall family  When Carlowrie Castle was put up for sale following Isobel Wylie Hutchison's death, the Marshall family acquired it. Following its extensive refurbishment, Carlowrie was quickly voted one of the top three venues under 200 bedrooms in Europe.

Her body of work explores historical memory, archival materials, and feminist historiography.  Career  Lusztig's debut feature film Reconstruction, released in 2001, tells the story of her Romanian maternal grandmother Monica Sevianu, who was sentenced to life in prison for taking part in the Ioanid Gang bank heist in 1959. The film explores issues of Romanian Communist history, re-enactment and authoritarian politics through the personal lens of Lusztig's family history. The film had its international premiere in the First Appearances program at IDFA in Amsterdam, was shown in MoMA's Doc Fortnight screening program, and was broadcast on ARTE. It was praised as \\"a film of ambition and scope\\" by the Boston Phoenix and hailed as \\"an example of personal documentary at its best\\" by Variety. In 2003, Filmmaker Magazine named Lusztig one of their 25 new faces of indie film. Her 2013 feature length film The Motherhood Archives combines over 100 educational archival films to explore the ideologically mediated histories of childbirth in the 20th century. Her most recent feature length film, Yours in Sisterhood (2018), explores the unpublished letters sent to Ms. Magazine in the 1970s. This film examines history and second-wave feminism in the context of the most recent wave of feminist politics. It premiered at the 2018 Berlinale Forum and was nominated for a Teddy Award for Best Documentary/Essay Film.

A \\"glass hammer\\" is a highly impractical object which an apprentice might be sent to fetch as part of a fool's errand A fool's errand is a type of practical joke or prank where a newcomer to a group, typically in a professional context, is given an impossible or nonsensical task by older or more experienced members of the group. Many such errands require the victim to travel some distance and request an impossible object by name; the prank will be widely known within the peer group as an in-joke, and the person they ask for the object will play along, often by sending the victim on to make the same request elsewhere. The errand is an example of a hazing ritual, through which a newcomer gains acceptance into a group. Examples * One type of North American fool's errand is the \\"snipe hunt\\". The hunters are typically led to an outdoor spot at night and given a bag or pillowcase along with instructions that can include either waiting quietly or making odd noises to attract the creatures. The other group members leave, promising to chase the snipe toward the newcomer; instead, they return home or to camp, leaving the victim of the prank alone in the dark to discover that they have been duped and left \\"holding the bag\\". As an American rite of passage, it is often associated with summer camps and groups such as the Boy Scouts. * New car repair staff are requested to collect fresh spark plug sparks, by catching sparks from a grinder disc using a small box. * New car salespeople are often sent to different dealerships around town to get the \\"lot stretcher\\". After reaching the new dealership, the manager informs the victim that it has been moved to another dealership across town, and the prank continues. * A common fool's errand is to send someone to get \\"blinker fluid\\" or \\"turn signal fluid\\" from an automotive parts store. * In baseball, a manager or a coach will ask a new batboy to fetch them a \\"box of curveballs\\" or \\"the keys to the batter's box.\\" Major League pitcher Rick Sutcliffe would often perform this prank. * In the pizza-making business, newcomers are told to look in the fridge for the \\"dough repair kit\\". * Another variation includes being sent to procure a \\"long weight\\" or \\"long stand\\", the idea being that the dupe will reach the shop (or equivalent source of the mythical object) and place the request. The victim is then delayed by the shopkeeper and thus receives a long wait. * Other common restaurant practical jokes include sending the new employee to another restaurant to borrow the \\"bacon stretcher\\", \\"lobster food\\", \\"lobster gun\\", a \\"souffle pump\\", left-handed tongs, the \\"oven key\\", a left-handed broom, or a \\"can of steam\\". An alternative prank is to instruct the new employee to empty a coffee machine or hot water tower of its water (the machine being connected to a water line and thus never able to be \\"emptied\\"). * In the decorating and construction trade, a \\"left-handed screwdriver\\", \\"board stretcher\\", \\"eye measures\\", \\"hammer grease\\", \\"wall expander\\", \\"glass hammer\\", \\"striped or tartan paint\\", \\"metric crescent wrench\\", \\"bucket of grinder sparks\\" or \\"box of assorted knots\\" are analogous pranks. Another such errand subject, \\"polka-dot paint\\", became real in the 1950s with the development of a polychromatic paint which created a dotted effect when dry.Product Finishing, vol 15, 1950, p. 110 (google snippet) * At General Electric's NELA Park plant in the 1920s, as a joke, newly hired engineers would be told to develop an inside frosted lightbulb, which the experienced engineers believed to be impossible (previous bulbs had been sandblasted for the frosting effect, which caused brittleness). In 1925, newly-hired Marvin Pipkin got the assignment and astonished his peers by succeeding. * Electricians commonly send the \\"new guy\\" to the toolroom to fetch a \\"cable stretcher\\". http://www.electricalslang.com/Slang/cable%20stretcher * Telecommunications technicians have been known to send a greenie to get a \\"5 gallon bucket of dialtone\\" for the new communications system. * In the United States Navy, pranks have included sending a new sailor after a \\"BT Punch\\" (a fist-punch) from a Boiler Technician who works in the Engine Room; \\"red lamp oil for the port running light\\" and \\"green lamp oil for the starboard running light\\"; a \\"gallon of prop wash\\"; and \\"sound-powered phone batteries\\". Other examples are to send the dupe on a search for a \\"spool of water line\\", a \\"dropped gig line\\", a \\"bucket of steam\\", or the infamous \\"ID-10-T (idiot) form\\". * In the United States Air Force, a new Airman will be asked to stand in front of an aircraft and move back and forth in order to calibrate the weather radar before takeoff. Another request for new aviators is to assist in an air quality check, where they are required to run around the cabin of an aircraft with a plastic trash bag and fill it with air before tying it off and writing the name of the Air quality project on it ‚ÄúI-D-10-T‚Äù. This would then be proudly presented to maintenance personnel upon landing. * In Boy Scouts, sending a new camper after a \\"left handed smoke bender (or shifter)\\", \\"elbow grease\\", or \\"100 feet of shoreline\\" are similar practices. * In the Czech Republic, if one breaks a spirit level, they might be asked to go and \\"buy a new bubble\\". Other construction-related jokes include buying a \\"brick bender\\", \\"a bender straightener\\", or \\"aerosol nails\\". * In the Czech Republic, a child might be sent to the pharmacy to buy some \\"semosel\\". Spelled correctly, jsem osel means \\"I am a fool\\", literally \\"I am a donkey\\". * In the oilfield in the US and internationally, new hires may be told to get the \\"keys to the v-door\\". The v-door is a steel ramp, not a door. * In the United Kingdom, construction- related jokes often include asking new workers to get \\"a skirting board ladder\\", \\"a bucket of steam\\", \\"rubber nails\\" or \\"a battery-powered electric plug\\".

It contains a single species, M. eatoni.Atterholt, J., Hutchison, J.H., O'Connor, J.K (2018) \\"The most complete enantiornithine from North America and a phylogenetic analysis of the Avisauridae\\" PeerJ November 13, 2018Science News, Mirarce eatoni: Newly- Discovered Cretaceous Bird Lived Among Dinosaurs, Was Strong Flier, November 13, 2018. It was similar in size to modern turkeys.  Discovery  In 1992, in Utah, USA, paleontologist Howard Hutchison discovered fossilized remains of an enantiornithine bird. For a long time they have not been described; they were sometimes figured under the unofficial name of \\"Kaiparowits enantiornithine\\". The holotype, UCMP 139500, is well preserved in three dimensions. It consists of a partial postcranial skeleton without a skull, including 3 cervical and 2 thoracic vertebrae, a pygostyle, a furcula, the xiphoid process of the sternum, a fragment of the left scapula and a coracoid, the humerus, ulna, and radius with fragments of the manus, several fused fragments of the pelvic girdle, and some elements of the hind limbs. It is the most complete enantiornithine found in North America. In 2018, the fossil was named and described by a group of paleontologists led by Jesse Atterholt. The generic name is made up of the Latin mirus; beautiful, \\"for an impressive level of preservation and morphological details,\\" with the addition of the name of Arke ( ·ºåœÅŒ∫Œ∑ \\\\ Arkƒì ), the winged messenger of the Titans of Greek mythology - \\"for evidence pointing to an improved vehicle of this kind.\\" The species name eatoni given in honor of Jeffrey Eaton in recognition of the decades of scientific work done on the Kaiparowits formation and the study of its fossil specimens.  Description  Mirarce eatoni was a large turkey- sized bird. Skeletal morphology indicates that at the time of death, the individual was adult. All the surviving elements of the bones show complete fusion. The bones of the forelimbs deserve special attention. The humerus of the bird is short and strong. The left ulna was preserved as a mineral cast of the internal cavity with several small fragments of fossilized bone surface. Two folded spots preserved on the posterior edge of the bone body are interpreted as quill knobs. These elongated folds are located along the length of the bone. Despite the fact that bone fragments do not allow measuring the size of each tubercle, determining the distance between them or estimating the number of secondary feathers, their very presence on the fossil is a very significant fact, as this is the first time the structure has been found in enantiornithines.  Phylogeny  Mirarce was found to be a member of Avisauridae, close to Avisaurus itself.

Development  The process was described in 1850 by John Mercer, who treated cotton with solutions of 110‚Äì125¬∞Tw sulfuric acid, at room temperature, followed by washing. Mercer observed that the treated fabric was soft like fine wool when treated at 110¬∞Tw, shrank and stiffened at 114¬∞Tw, or shrank, stiffened, and became semi-transparent from 116‚Äì125¬∞Tw. In general, treating indefinitely with concentrations below 110¬∞Tw (64%) only swells and shrinks the fabric, while higher concentrations produce the stiff, translucent parchment-like effect in a few seconds, with some loss of tensile strength. Textile makers have combined sulfuric acid treatment with other processes to achieve different effects. For example, Mercerising cotton fabric before acid treatment appears to make it more susceptible to treatment at lower concentrations of sulfuric acid. At about 106 ¬∞Tw the Mercerised lustre is removed and the fabric becomes fuller, softer, and more wool-like, similar to a cr√™pe. The parchmentising effect is still present at higher concentrations, and may be obtained as low as 107.5 ¬∞Tw with somewhat longer treatment, perhaps a few minutes. Acid and alkaline treatments are sometimes applied several times in alternation, and patterns may be created by locally applying a resist before or between treatments. At every stage the treatment is stopped by washing and neutralizing the fabric. After acid treatment and washing, a heavy calender, sometimes heated, can be applied to the wet or dried fabric to vary its translucency.

He is best known for his critiques of behavioral economics, and in particular his critique of the behavioral economics concept of loss aversion. His forthcoming book is titled The Power of the Status Quo.  Academic career  Gal received his Ph.D. from Stanford University in 2007. He joined the faculty of The Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University where he remained until 2014, at which time he joined the faculty of The University of Illinois at Chicago. His research has been published in Journal of Consumer Research, Journal of Marketing Research, Journal of Marketing, Judgment and Decision Making, Psychological Science, Management Science, and Journal of the American Statistical Association. It has been featured in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, The Toronto Star, Time, Harvard Business Review, and The Globe and Mail, among other outlets. He has been named among the most productive academic authors in the top marketing journals from 2013 to 2016. He was named a Marketing Science Institute Young Scholar in 2013 and a Marketing Science Institute Scholar in 2018.  Critique of Loss Aversion and Behavioral Economics  Loss aversion is the principle that losses loom larger than gains. It was introduced by the economics Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in a 1979 paper that is the most cited in economics and third most cited in psychology. Kahneman has subsequently stated ‚Äúthe concept of loss aversion is certainly the most significant contribution of psychology to behavioral economics.‚Äù The phrase \\"loss aversion\\" also appeared 24 times in the Nobel Committee's description of Richard Thaler's contributions to science when discussing his 2017 Nobel Prize award. Gal has argued that loss aversion is not supported by the evidence and that most phenomena attributed to loss aversion have alternative explanations that are more consistent with the evidence. In particular, Gal has cited psychological inertia as an explanation for the endowment effect and status quo bias. In addition to his specific critique of loss aversion, Gal has argued that behavioral economics more broadly has been too concerned with understanding how behavior deviates from standard economic models rather than with understanding why people behave the way they do. Understanding why behavior occurs is necessary for the creation of generalizable knowledge, the goal of science. He has referred to behavioral economics as a triumph of marketing.

For those with the liability not to possess a kick, they must seek different strategies to anticipate and diminish their opponent's kicking power, usually by a long extended surge to break away or exhaust their opponent well ahead of the finish of the race. Similar to a Sprinter in cycling, a kicker has a finite distance they know they are able to sprint, making their strategy to be in the ideal position at that distance to be able to utilize that speed. Sprinting too early could lead an athlete to tie up, a form of muscle cramp that debilitates a racer from continuing to kick. Thus team tactics might also intentionally or not, box a kicker, meaning to position other competitors to their outside, to disrupt their positioning and timing. Of course, as the finish is nearing and all athletes are straining, this becomes more difficult to accomplish deliberately. In the 800 metres, some athletes develop the reputation for being a kicker because of their apparent speed at the end of the race, when in reality they ran even splits. Most of that speed is relative to the exhaustion as their opponents slow. Dave Wottle, James Robinson, Yuriy Borzakovskiy, Nick Symmonds and Amel Tuka would take the beginning of the race out slowly, regaining contact with the rest of the field near the last 200 metres. At the elite men's level, that even pace would be about 26 seconds per 200 metres; a 52-second first lap, as compared with the leaders close to or under 50 seconds. World record holder David Rudisha burned off the kickers during his world record 2012 Gold medal. When he won the 2015 World Championships, he blew away even-paced kickers like Tuka with a remarkably fast final 24.34 200 metre true kick of his own. Generally, most long kickers or extended kickers would accelerate in the penultimate lap or shortly after the bell indicating the last lap has begun. A speed kicker would behave more like an anchor runner in a 4x400 relay, positioning themselves on the shoulder of their opponent and using their burst of speed as late as the final straightaway. Mo Farah developed a reputation as a strategic runner. His finishing kick was not so much a burst of speed, but his extended ability to repeatedly accelerate just enough to discourage anybody from passing him during an intense final lap or so of his races. His Nike Oregon Project teammate Matthew Centrowitz Jr. employed a similar form of holding the lead to win his 2016 gold medal in the 1500. Because of the advantage of having the tool of a kick in a competitor's arsenal, the techniques to train to kick are a common discussion among runners and coaches.http://www.letsrun.com/forum/flat_read.php?thread=5048842https://running.competitor.com/2014/10/training/ask- mario-improve-kick_115237https://www.realbuzz.com/articles- interests/running/article/how-to-perfect-the-finishing-kick-or-sprint-finish- in-a-race/http://runners-resource.com/how-to-develop-a- kick/https://www.runnersworld.com/advanced/a20799128/a-lethal-kick/ Notable kickers * Ferm√≠n Cacho * Sebastian Coe * Eamonn Coghlan * Alberto Cova * Haile Gebrselassie * Shelby Houlihan * Ezekiel Kemboi * Bernard Lagat * Douglas Lowe * Billy Mills * Steve Ovett * Jim Ryun * Peter Snell * Miruts Yifter Extended kickers * Kenenisa Bekele * Matthew Centrowitz Jr. * Steve Cram * Hicham El Guerrouj * Mo Farah * Lasse Vir√©n References Sport of athletics terminology Running Track and field Sports strategy ","title":"Kick (running)"},{"id":"59044924","text":"Northern Ireland Open may refer to: *Northern Ireland Open (darts), a professional darts tournament *Northern Ireland Open (golf), a golf tournament on the Challenge Tour *Northern Ireland Open (snooker), a professional snooker tournament ","title":"Northern Ireland Open"},{"id":"59044945","text":"James D.

His father was a civil servant and his mother worked as a kindergarten teacher, in addition to being member of South Sumatra's provincial council between 1956 and 1959. Sumadi completed his first 12 years of education in Palembang, before moving to Yogyakarta to study architecture at Gadjah Mada University, from which he graduated in 1981. He is married and has one child. Career After getting his bachelors, Sumadi began to work as a planning architect for PT Pembangunan Jaya Ancol Tbk, a company owned by the Jakarta city government, in 1982. He worked there for 22 years, rising up through its ranks and becoming its CEO by 2004. He then moved to another Jakarta-owned company PT Jakarta Propertindo, where he was the CEO until 2015. During his time in the companies, he worked in various projects involving housing and infrastructure in Jakarta, including developing the Bintaro Jaya area and constructing low-cost tenements. In 2015, Sumadi was transferred to Angkasa Pura II ‚Äì a central-government owned company which managed airports in western Indonesia. As CEO of AP II, he took on the project of developing Soekarno-Hatta International Airport Terminal 3. Still in 2015, he went into dispute with then-Transport Minister Ignasius Jonan when he refused to remove Soekarno-Hatta International Airport's general manager following a ground handling error by Lion Air, and later disputed again regarding the opening of Terminal 3, where Jonan believed that the terminal was not ready yet. =Minister= Sumadi was appointed as the Minister of Transportation to replace Ignasius Jonan during a cabinet reshuffle on 27 July 2016. Two months into being sworn in, Sumadi released a ministerial regulation for online transportation companies such as Go-Jek, Grab and Uber ‚Äì covering licensing and regulation of drivers and vehicles, in addition to banning the use of cars with less than 1,300 cc capacity ‚Äì which received backlash and resulted in demonstrations by the online transportation drivers. In 2018, he further required Go-Jek and Grab to register officially as transport businesses. He was investigated by the Corruption Eradication Commission in October 2017 following the arrest of the naval transport director-general. He had previously publicly apologized in August immediately after the arrest. Following the October 2018 crash of Lion Air flight 610, Sumadi suspended Lion Air's technical director. In accordance to a presidential order, Sumadi also conducted a review of airfares, particularly for low-cost carriers. He also promised to impose sanctions on the airline following the completion of the investigation. Sumadi had previously issued a warning to Lion Air's management to revamp its safety and scheduling in 2017 following several non-fatal incidents.

The photograph is still one of the most widely used depictions of Polish cavalry during the 1939 invasion of Poland. Background The provenance of the photograph is unclear, however it is believed to be held by one of Polish archives and it was published in numerous well-regarded books on the invasion of Poland in 1939. In the 1972 edition of Battles of Polish September (\\"Bitwy Polskiego Wrze≈õnia\\") by Apoloniusz Zawilski, the photograph was described as \\"Cavalry in gallop through Sochaczew\\" (Kawaleria w galopie przez Sochaczew). It was not included in the revised 1989 edition. In the 1982 book Pozna≈Ñ Army in defensive war 1939 (\\"Armia Pozna≈Ñ w wojnie obronnej 1939\\") by Piotr Bauer and Bogus≈Çaw Polak, the photograph was described as the \\"Pozna≈Ñ Army in fights in Uniej√≥w region\\". Some publications identify the unit as the Wielkopolska Cavalry Brigade (Wielkopolska Brygada Kawalerii), which was a part of the Pozna≈Ñ Army. The photograph was also featured in numerous other books, textbooks, web publications and news articles. It also can be purchased from several stock photography agencies, like Getty Images and Alamy, which all claim copyrights. The prints published in books were always of very low resolution; however, once high resolutions scans become available, inconsistencies were noticed between the photograph and the uniforms and customs of Polish cavalry in 1939. The soldiers in the photograph seem to be wearing 1931 or 1932 pattern helmets, while the Polish cavalry used Adrian helmets. Also, the Polish cavalry traditionally wore sabers attached diagonally under the left knee, while soldiers in the photo wear then vertically on the right side. In addition, other inconsistencies between the photograph and Polish army saddle packing regulations and the inability to pinpoint the exact location where the photograph was taken caused many to question its authenticity. The origin of the photograph was clarified after it was noticed that some of the buildings, uniforms and saddles in the photo match buildings and equipment of soldiers seen in the 1941 German propaganda movie Kampfgeschwader L√ºtzow. The Polish soldiers in Kampfgeschwader L√ºtzow were played by Slovaks and their uniforms and saddles closely match those used by the Slovak army at the beginning of WWII. The scene of the charge of \\"Polish cavalry\\" in the movie was shot around Wyszk√≥w in 1940. Also, many scenes from the movie were linked to specific locations in that town. The photograph is not a still from the movie, but it was likely taken during its shooting.

Early life Elliot was born in New York City on October 1, 1862. He was the son of Dr. George Thompson Elliot Jr. (1827‚Äì1871) and Sally (n√©e Duncan) Elliot (1834‚Äì1888). His father was a prominent physician at Bellevue Hospital in New York. After his father's death in 1871, he mother remarried to Jacob Post Giraud Foster (1827‚Äì1886). His brother was Richard Elliot. His maternal grandparents were William T. Duncan and Rebecca (n√©e Lincoln) Duncan. His paternal grandparents were George Thompson Elliot Sr. and Rebecca Giraud (n√©e Foster) Elliot. His uncle was zoologist Daniel Giraud Elliot. Through his Elliot grandfather, he was descended from Richard Treat, an early colonist from Wethersfield, Connecticut, and through his Foster grandmother, he was descended from the Girauds who emigrated from France with the Huguenots. Career After graduating from Columbia University in 1884, Elliot began his career with a banking house in New York. During the Spanish American War, he served as a cavalry officer. He later volunteered for service with the 26th Volunteer Infantry as Adjutant in the Philippines in 1899 during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, with the assistance of then governor Theodore Roosevelt and U.S. Representative William Astor Chanler. In 1917, he was assigned commandant of cadets at St. John's College in Annapolis by the War Department and, the following year, was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel. =Society life= In 1892, Elliot and his wife Sallie were included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. During their marriage, his wife occupied Dellmain Cottage on Narragansett Avenue in Newport, Rhode Island before purchasing the William Starr-Miller place on Bellevue Avenue. The Miller home, a French Norman-style \\"cottage\\", was commissioned by William Starr Miller II and designed by Miller's brother-in-law, Whitney Warren (a partner in Warren and Wetmore) and named High Tide, with interiors by noted designer Ogden Codman. Personal life On September 15, 1891, Elliot was married to heiress Sallie Jeannette Hargous at All Saints' Memorial Church in Newport. Sallie, who was described as \\"the handsomest, richest, brightest, gayest, most admired young women in the upper-most circles of society\\", was the sister of Robert L. Hargous (who lived in Venice, Italy), Nina Hargous Appleton, and Anita Hargous de Forest, was considered \\"one of the most popular members of the younger set,\\" and had inherited a fortune when she became of age. Sallie and Duncan, \\"the tall blonde athlete\\" were introduced by her brother at an \\"Apple Blossom Ball\\" in 1890. Together, they were the parents of three children, all boys: * Duncan Elliot Jr. (b. 1893), who became a naturalized British subject and married the English born Miriam Stammers. * Robert Hargous Elliot (b. 1896), who also became a naturalized British subject and married Iris Medora Stammers, the sister of his brother's wife, in 1917. * Giraud Elliot, who left Harrow to enlist and fight in World War I. He received the Military Cross for gallantry under fire in 1917. He later married the American, Elizabeth Sands. In 1901, after several years of rumors, and much speculation in the media regarding his drunkenness and philandering, his wife filed for divorce. After their divorce, his former wife remarried to Woodbury Kane in 1905, a few months before his death. After his death, Elliot reportedly tried to get Sallie to remarry him, but she refused and instead, married Douglas Howard Gill of the British Army. In poor health, Elliot committed suicide in Annapolis, Maryland on November 2, 1919. After a service at St. Anne's Protestant Episcopal Church in Annapolis, he was buried in at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx.

She has served as a deputy in the Supreme Soviet of the Tajik SSR and the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Bobosodiqova was honored three times with the Order of the Red Banner of Labor and was a recipient of the Order of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of Tajikistan. Early life Guljahon Boboevna Bobosodiqova was born in 1937 in Uroteppa, Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic to Fazilat and Boboev Bobosodiqov. Her parents both worked in civil service, but her father died when she was young. Her mother, who was the first woman in charge of the Department of Women's Affairs encouraged Bobosodiqova in her dreams to study science. Bobosodiqova studied mathematics and physics at Tajikistan State University and graduated with a degree in 1959. She wanted to continue her studies, but further education required support of the Communist Party. She joined the party, but instead of continuing her education was selected for political roles. Career In 1961, Bobosodiqova became the secretary of the Komsomol in Dushanbe. She would become one of the key features of Tajikistani politics in the decades between 1960 and 1980. She served at various times as a Deputy in the Supreme Soviet of the Tajik SSR and the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and between 1972 and 1975 was the Deputy Chair of the Party in Tajikistan. She served three terms as the Deputy representing the Badakhshan Province and two terms for the Kulob District in the Khatlon Region. For her work, Bobosodiqova was awarded the Order of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of Tajikistan and received the Order of the Red Banner of Labor three times. She lived in Moscow until the break up of the Soviet Union in 1991 and then returned to Tajikistan. The focus of much of Bobosodiqova's later career was on women's rights and she worked to create educational opportunities for women. One of the founders of the Association of Public High School Education, she led the organization for 25 years. She has worked with women's organizations, governmental institutions, and political parties to press for legislation on women's issues, such as domestic violence, laws to discourage labor migration and improve access to education, laws to change the age of consent and consanguinity regulations for marriage eligibility, and address issues such as lack of leadership positions, adequate medical services, and human trafficking.

As a relatively poor country, its contributions to climate change have been limited; moreover, because of the large forest cover the country has been running a carbon-negative economy since 2014. Suriname was the second country to update its Nationally Determined Contributions in 2020.  Emissions  Suriname has claimed a net- negative carbon economy since at least 2014. This is in large part because of the dense forest cover over 93% of the country. Most of the rainforest is still in pristine condition, however it is being threatened by gold mining and logging companies. Agriculture contributes 40% of the country's emissions. = Petroleum industry = Petroleum exports are an important part of the economy of Suriname, much of which is controlled by the state owned Staatsolie Maatschappij Suriname. As of January 2020, an American corporation, Apache Corporation, was drilling wells in Maka Central.  Climate impacts  According to the World Bank, temperatures have already increased across the country, with a significant increase in hot weather. Though precipitation has not shown any significant trend changes, projections suggest significant changes in different parts of the country. The greatest risk Suriname faces is the flooding of the rivers. The population is concentrated around major rivers like the Suriname, Commewijne, and Marowijne River in an area a few meters above sea level. In 2006 and 2015, there were majors floods even resulting in deaths. Moreover, 90% of Suriname's human activity is on the Northern coast, which is particularly vulnerable to sea level rise and salt water intrusion.  Economic impacts = Agriculture = Though agriculture is a decreasing part of the total economy of the country, accounting for 9% of GDP in 2012, it is the third largest part of the Surinamese economy employing 15% of the population in 2009. Changing weather and flood events are expect to have significant negative effects on agriculture in the country. 49% of the economic losses of May 2006 floods in Suriname were agricultural.  Policy  The Surinamese government was proactive about updating its Nationally Determined Contributions statement in 2020, second only behind the Climate change in the Marshall Islands. The major commitments included maintenance of forests as a carbon sink, 35% renewable energy by 2030, and sustainable farming and transportation investments.

Rising temperatures, intense droughts, declining precipitation, desertification, salinization, and the increasing prevalence of dust storms have undermined Iraq‚Äôs agricultural sector. Additionally, Iraq‚Äôs water security is based on two declining rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates. National and regional political uncertainty will make mitigating the effects of climate change and addressing transnational water management very difficult. Climatic changes such as increasing temperatures, reduced precipitation, and increasing water scarcity will likely have serious implications for the state of Iraq for years to come.  Excessive heat and limited air conditioning  In Iraq, climate change has resulted in \\"prolonged heat waves, erratic precipitation, higher than average temperatures and increased disaster intensity,‚Äù according to a 2018 report by the Expert Working Group on Climate-related Security Risk. Baghdad is experiencing an earlier onset of 48C days. In 2019, air conditioning has become unaffordable or impossible to maintain for lower income residents, due to erratic electricity supplies.  Drought and erratic precipitation  Drought between 2007 and 2009 was followed by very heavy rains which contributed to flooding and soil loss. Iraq's years of drought became especially acute in 2018, at which time its land under cultivation was reduced by half. Cultivation of irrigated crops such as rice, corn and other cereals was suspended by the government; losses in rice production were estimated at 39 million dollars. In 2019, an unusually wet winter \\"restored freshwater marshes of southern Iraq,\\" and also caused widespread flooding on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.  Water supply  As water levels fall, increasing salinity of the water supply has become a concern in southern Iraq, especially in Basra.  Security risks of climate change  When agricultural livelihoods are disrupted, local residents in ISIS-liberated areas may become dependent on terrorist groups for access to resources.

It opened in 1935 and was one of the major clubs on the street, hosting leading jazz musicians until 1950, through changes of location and periods of closure. History The Famous Door opened at 35 West 52nd Street on March 1, 1935. Among its initial backers were the radio bandleader Lennie Hayton, who helped it become well known, and musicians Jimmy Dorsey and Glenn Miller. Louis Prima played on the club's opening night. \\"The club was intended to provide a reliable venue for swing musicians and a place where they could gather, but other customers were attracted by the door inside (autographed by visiting celebrities) which gave the club its name, the fine music, and drinks that started at fifty cents.\\" An upstairs room was used for informal jazz sessions. In its first year, musicians such as Bunny Berigan, Georg Brunis, Bobby Hackett, Billie Holiday, Max Kaminsky, Wingy Manone, and Red Norvo helped establish its reputation. Vocalist Bessie Smith's only 52nd Street appearance was at the Famous Door ‚Äì for a single date in February 1936. The club was predominantly for white musicians; black musicians Holiday and pianist Teddy Wilson were fired for mingling with Charlie Barnet, a white bandleader who was in the audience. Financial problems led to the club closing on May 10, 1936. Ben Webster, Eddie Barefield, Buck Clayton, and Benny Morton on stage at the Famous Door, c. October 1947 A new version of the club opened at 66 West 52nd Street in December 1937. Its capacity was no more than sixty. Prima was again the first to be given a residency, with pianist Art Tatum playing between sets. Big bands also played there in the 1930s and 1940s, even though the bandstand was small. There were also frequent radio broadcasts from the venue by CBS in the late 1930s. Broadcasts of Count Basie's big band from the club several nights a week in part of 1938 helped develop his career. This was facilitated by a representative of the MCA booking agency, which paid for the club to make alterations, including the installation of air conditioning. A failure to pay wages to the musicians meant that the club was closed from June to September 1940. The club was part of the scene in which bebop developed: Benny Carter reported that he was asked to dismiss the experimenting trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie from his band when playing there around 1942: \\"I was asked to get rid of him because he was playing augmented ninths, etc. They thought he was hitting bad notes.\\" In November 1943, the Famous Door moved to 201 West 52nd Street, but this survived for only a short time into 1944. The club was revived in 1947, this time at 56 West 52nd Street. This again featured leading jazz figures of the time, this time in the swing and bebop styles. It closed in 1950. \\"The last of the locations to take the illustrious name of the Famous Door was active on 52nd Street in the 1960s; clubs in other American cities have also used the name, including one in New Orleans.\\" References Jazz clubs in New York City Music venues in New York City ","title":"Famous Door"},{"id":"59045597","text":"State Road 218 (NM 218) is a state highway in the US state of New Mexico.

Emissions  Algeria is a low emitter of carbon dioxide: producing 4.1 tons per capita as of 2008, less than the global average at that times. At that time the 74% of their emission came from energy production.  Impacts = Water = According to World Bank, Algeria qualifies as a water scarce country.

Climate change is expected to speed up this process, weakening soil and biodiversity in farmland. Every part of agriculture in the country is expected to be effected: for example, small scale shepherding which is a common form of agriculture, becomes increasingly expensive as herders have to dig wells and buy feed, rather than use grazing.

Because the country sits at the intersection of three hydro-climatic zones, the climate of Ghana is expected to become incredibly variable. Based on a 20-year baseline climate observation, it is forecasted that maize and other cereal crop yields will reduce by 7% by 2050. Available data also shows a sea level rise of 2.1 mm per year over the last 30 years, indicating a rise of 5.8 cm, 16.5 cm and 34.5 cm by 2020, 2050 and 2080. Changes in rainfall, other extreme weather and sea level rise and salinity of coastal waters, is expected to negatively affect food security, in both farming and in fisheries. The national economy stands to suffer from the impacts of climate change because it is dependent on climate sensitive-sectors such as agriculture, energy, forestry, etc. Moreover, access to freshwater is expected to create challenges for both sanitary water, and hydropower which provides 54% of the country's electric capacity. Additionally, Ghana will likely see certain diseases, like malaria and cholera exacerbated by changing weather conditions.

Water resources  Expected decreases to water in the primary rivers basins providing fresh water for the country, Volta River, Bia River and Tano River, could increase challenges in getting access to clean drinking water. = Hydropower = Because 54% of national generation capacity is hydropower. Unpredictable rainfall is likely to add uncertainty to a power grid already experiencing frequent outages (known as dumsor). Some estimates suggest that capacity could fall by as much as 50% for the Volta Basin.

He was the longest serving president in Comic-Con's history. Rogers was born in Canada on Feb 23, 1961. His parents moved to Mount Helix in San Diego County when he was just 18-months old. They later relocated to the Del Cerro neighborhood of San Diego, where he attended Patrick Henry High School. The San Diego Comic-Con was founded in 1970. Rogers joined the convention in 1978 while working as a software engineer for a San Diego telecommunications company. He served as a technical coordinator and films coordinator before being elected president for his first term in 1986. He was re-elected president annually from 1986 to 2018. Each year on the last day of Comic-Con, Rogers appeared in a popular panel called \\"Comic-Con Talk Back\\" to answer questions from convention attendees.

Senegal was not a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, contributing only 6/10ths of one ton of CO2 per capita -- or is 150th in the list of most emitting countries. Climate change has the potential to increase land degradation and exacerbate other environmental issues such as deforestation. Extreme drought and coastal erosion is expected to create food insecurity and other health concerns for a large portion of the population, where 70% of the population is employed in the agricultural industry.  Emissions  Senegal was not a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, contributing only of one ton of CO2 per capita‚Äîor is 150th in the list of most emitting countries. Most energy in Senegal is produced through fossil fuel sources. Historically, Senegal has not been a major producer of fossil fuels. However, major discoveries in natural gas, lead to a major increase in production by 2040.  Environmental changes  West Africa is expected to be effected by climate change caused extreme weather. Moreover, rainfall from 1921 to 2014 has a clear downward trend. Climate modeling suggests that the average temperature in Senegal will increase between 3 and 4 degrees Celsius by 2050. These forces combined together will likely increase Desertification in eastern Senegal, leading to expansion of the Sahara. = Water resources = The main water resources in Senegal are dependent on rainfall. Rainfall deficits and increased variability due to climate change will likely reduce aquifer recharge rates. Major population centers are already seeing saltwater intrusion into aquifers and arable land. Sea level rise and decreased rainfall will exacerbate salinity issues. As more saltwater intrusion happens, this will threaten fish stock in the country.  Political action  In 2006, Senegal initiated a National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) as part of the larger trend to create National Adaptation Plans. A National Committee on Climate Change was appointed by presidential degree to support the program. Additional, there is a Climate Fund that is an instrument of climate finance. At the same time that these policies are in place, there is evidence that they are not fully being acted on. For example, an article in The Nation focused on climate justice described how a coal fire power plan was built in Bargny, Senegal, a site that had been identified by the government as a displacement location for communities displaced by sea level rise.  Population displacement  Sea level rise is expected to displace a large percentage of Senegal's population. Nearly 70% of the population lives in coastal zones. The government is already moving communities in high-risk flood areas. Additionally nearly 90% of industry in Senegal is in that same coastal region. Extreme weather events and coastal flooding could jeopardize these major economic centers.  Impact on agriculture  Like in other parts of West Africa, the expected extreme weather including more severe drought is expected to greatly effect Food security and agricultural yields. For example, some projections suggest a 20% reduction in the growing period in 2020. Since agriculture employs 70% of the population of Senegal, the sustainable development focused Emerging Senegal Plan focuses on this planning.

As a coastal country with hot and arid climates, environmental impacts are likely to be wide and varied. Moreover, analysis of these environmental changes on the economy of Morocco are expected to create challenges at all levels of the economy, especially in the agricultural systems and fisheries which employ half of the population, and account for 14% of GDP. Moreover, because 60% of the population and most of the industrial activity are on the coast, sea level rise is a major threat to key economic forces. As of the 2019 Climate Change Performance Index, Morocco was ranked second in preparedness behind Sweden.  Environmental impacts = Sea level rise = 60% of the population of Morocco lives on the coast, and flooding and sea level rise are expected to significantly effect these populations. These effects are especially going to effect economic activities, including tourism, agriculture, and industry. = Water resources = Climate variability is expected to put a number of pressures on water resources in Morocco. Projections indicate 10-20 decreases in precipitation across the country, with the most severe in the Saharan region by 2100. Moreover, climate change will reduce snowpack in the Atlas Mountains. This puts pressure on water resources, already stressed by other sources such as population expansion, urban growth, industry, and tourism. Moreover, many coastal aquifers will be increasingly become stress because of coastal salinization  Economy = Agriculture = The agricultural system in Morocco is especially vulnerable to climate change. Crop production is primarily (87%) from rainfed agriculture.

In addition to Symbolism, she also curated an exhibition in 2017 where Japonisme is the theme.  It is outside the modes of his time that Gustave Moreau, trained in Renaissance art traditions, elaborated a complex and decorative art style, which combines a deep knowledge of all mythologies with a high awareness of a painter's profession. Creator of a highly personal universe, where there is a passion for myths and mysticism‚ÄîSalome, Orpheus, Oedipus and the Sphinx ...‚Äîdream and imagination, poetry and mystery.

Created in 1959 by Governor LeRoy Collins, the agency acquired, restored, and preserved historic structures in St. Augustine until its abolishment by the State of Florida in June 1997.  History  St. Augustine postcard In March 1958 a group from St. Augustine asked Florida Governor LeRoy Collins for the creation of a historic preservation program for the city's historic downtown. On June 11, 1959, House Bill 774 was signed into law, establishing the St. Augustine Historical Restoration and Preservation Commission and giving it $150,000 of state funds to begin its work. Original members of the Commission were Herbert E. Wolfe, Leonard Usina, William F. Rolleston, William L. Sims II, and Henrietta Poynter. Wolfe, a resident of St. Augustine, was the Commission's first chairman, serving from 1959 until 1969. The Commission hired consultant Earle Newton to help it develop a strategic plan for the restoration and preservation of St. Augustine buildings. At its founding, the agency's primary objective was to restore the colonial architecture of St. Augustine in time for the city's Quadricentennial Celebration in 1965. Buildings the agency planned to restore dated to the First Spanish Period (1565-1763), British Period (1763-83), Second Spanish Period (1783-1821), and the early American Period (after 1821). Senator Verle Pope and Representatives Charlie Usina and Gus Craig strongly supported the restoration program and fought for another $300,000 to further its work. The Commission's first restoration project was the Arrivas House on St. George Street, which was dedicated by then-Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson on March 11, 1963. The Commission used the second floor of the Arrivas House as their administrative offices until 1970, when they moved operations to the Government House. On May 5, 1970 the St. Augustine Historical Restoration and Preservation Commission was renamed to the Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board. In June 1997 the agency was abolished by the State of Florida in accordance with the Sundown Act. Management of the agency's properties was first tasked to the City of St. Augustine and subsequently to UF Historic St. Augustine, Inc. (UFHSA), a direct support organization of the University of Florida.  San Agust√≠n Antiguo  In 1963 the HSAPB opened San Agust√≠n Antiguo, a living history museum village in which costumed guides gave tours of restored buildings and demonstrated a variety of arts and crafts typical of the First and Second Spanish Periods, as well as of the British Period. These included blacksmithing, weaving, printing, candle dipping, silversmithing, pottery, baking, and leather making. After the dissolution of the HSAPB, a smaller version of San Agust√≠n Antiguo was kept in operation by UF Historic St. Augustine, Inc.  Structure  The HSAPB was managed by a seven-member board of directors, the head of which was the Chairman. Chairmen of the board included Lawrence Lewis, Jr. (1969-1972), John D.

MK-1TS was launched on December 24, 2004, at 13:20 from the Plesetsk cosmodrome (Russia) using a Cyclone-3 launch vehicle together with Sich-1M satellite. Both satellites were placed into incorrect orbits due to premature third stage cutoff. The satellite was active until September 30, 2005.  Purpose  MK-1TS had a small on-board camera (MBTC-VD), to provide digital optical-electronic images in the panchromatic range. One of its tasks was to work out a new system of orientation on the base of a magnetometer and electromagnets without using auxiliary devices.

It has horizontal sprawling shoots as well as upright, unbranched shoots usually about ¬Ω m (1¬Ω in) high. The leaves are entire and stand out on the lower parts of the shoots, but are overlapping and pressed tidly against each other near the inflorescence, almost like a snakeskin. The inflorescence consists of several flowerheads, each containing three clear yellow flowers that are longer than the subtending leaves. It is the smallest species of Mimetes and is an endemic species that grows on well-drained, but permanently moist sandy and peaty slopes in the mountains near Hermanus, Western Cape province of South Africa. It is considered critically endangered. Flowering occurs all year round, but peaks in August and September.  Description  Mimetes palustris is an evergreen shrub, of mostly about ¬Ω m (1¬Ω ft), seldomly 1 m high, and up to ¬æ m (2¬Ω ft) in diameter, that develops from an upright main stem of up to ¬Ω cm (0.2 in) thick, which is covered by brown bark. At 5‚Äì10 cm (2‚Äì4 in) above the ground, several vigorous, upright, unbranched shoots emerge, as well as many lax horizontal runners that occasionally fork. Both types of shoot are 1¬Ω‚Äì3 mm (0.06‚Äì0.12 in) thick, initially covert in rusty-coloured felty hairs, but becoming hairless with age. The leathery leaves are alternately set and lack both stipules and a leaf stalk, are lance-shaped, elliptic to very broadly oval near the inflorescences, 1¬Ω‚Äì2 cm (0.6‚Äì0.8 in) long and ¬Ω‚Äì1 cm (0.2‚Äì0.4 in) wide, and have a pointy, thickened tip. The leaves are initially densely covered in rusty-coloured felty hairs and have a fringe of felty hair, but become hairless with age. Near the foot of the shoots the leaves stand out horizontally, but near the inflorescences the leaves are overlapping and tidly clasp the stem. On some of the runners, inflorescences develop that consist of one to three flower heads at its tip. The erect shoots have inflorescences of five to twelve heads and are narrowly cylinder-shaped. The flower heads are 3¬Ω cm (1.4 in) long and consist of three to six flowers, and are subtended by an ordinary green leaf. The outer whorl of bracts that encircle the flower heads are green and leafy in texture, line- to lance-shaped, 1¬Ω‚Äì2 cm (0.6‚Äì0.8 in) long and 2‚Äì4 mm (0.08‚Äì0.16 in) wide. The bracts on the inside of the head are papery in consistency and carry some silky hairs on the outer surface, are narrowly lance-shaped to elliptic lance-shaped with a sharply pointed tip, 2‚Äì3 cm (0.8‚Äì1.2 in) long and 4‚Äì10 mm (0.16‚Äì0.40 in) wide. The bract that subtends the individual flower is line-shaped or narrowly lance-shaped, about 1 cm (0.4 in) long and covered in dense silky hairs. The 4-merous perianth is 2‚Äì2¬Ω cm (0.8‚Äì1.0 in) long. The lower part called tube, that remains merged when the flower is open, is 2‚Äì3 mm (0.08‚Äì0.12 in) long, square in cross-section, and hairless. The four segments in the middle part (or claws), are thread-shaped and silky hairy. The segments in the upper part (or limbs), which enclosed the pollen presenter in the bud, are difficult to distinguish from the claws, threat- to line-shaped with a pointy tip, initially felty, but later losing some hair. The four anthers are about 2 mm (0.08 in) long, lack a filament and are directly connected to the limbs. From the centre of the perianth emerges a style of about 3¬Ω cm (1.4 in) long, that is straight are slightly curves outward. The thickened part at the tip of the style called pollen presenter is line-shaped with a poity tip, about 2 mm long, with ring at its base and a narrower neck. The 1‚Äì2 mm (0.04‚Äì0.08 in) long ovary is egg-shaped, powdery hairy except the zone facing the stem, and is subtended by four pointy, awl- to line-shaped scales of about 1 mm (0.04 in) long. = Differences with related species = The cryptic pagoda can be distinguished from other Mimetes species by its small size, the two types of shoots, one unbranched upright, the other occasionally forking and sprawling, the leaves that stand out on the lower parts but are very tidly overlapping near the inflorescence and the relatively short (3¬Ω cm), straigh, line- to awl-shaped styles. The flower heads only have three to six flowers, the least of any Mimetes, except for the three-flowered pagoda, which has orange flowers, not yellow.  Taxonomy  As far as known, the cryptic pagoda was first collected by James Niven. Richard Anthony Salisbury in a book by Joseph Knight titled On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae, described several species of pagoda, naming Niven's specimen M. palustris in 1809. Karl Ludwig Philipp Zeyher collected a specimen in the Kleinrivier Mountains, that was described by Carl Meissner, in 1856, in the series Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis by Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle. He called it M. decapitata. John Patrick Rourke in 1984 regarded the specimens as belonging to the same species.  Distribution and habitat  Mimetes palustris is an endemic species restricted to the Kleinrivier Mountains, Western Cape province of South Africa, where it can be found between the Platberg in the Fernkloof Nature Reserve near Hermanus in the west and slightly east of the Rocklands Peak. Here it grows in a vegetation type called Overberg Sandstone Fynbos, at an altitude of 600‚Äì900 m (2000‚Äì3000 ft). Mimetes palustris can only be found on south-facing slopes in part-shade in locations where an updraught from the sea create cool and moist air during summer. At the edge of seepage zones it can be found in combination with Brunia alopecuroides, Erica hispidula, Roridula gorgonias, and Villarsia ovata. Flower heads may occur at any time during the year. It is assumed that like other Mimetes species, the cryptic pagoda is pollinated by birds and the seeds are distributed by ants.  Conservation  The cryptic pagoda is considered critically endangered due to its diminishing population size, its small distribution area of , ongoing loss of habitat and competition by alien invasive species.

Serving Porter County, the Chesterton Tribune currently has about 4,409 subscriptions. The Chesterton Tribune began in 1882 and still serves the area today.  History  The Chesterton Tribune was launched by W.W. Mikels in October of 1882 as a Greenback party weekly. Mikel lasted as the owner only for a few months until he sold the paper to the Chesterton Tribune Company. This company was a group of local businessmen and was headed by John Taylor. Taylor had to discontinue the publication of the paper in 1883. In 1884 the Tribune company sent representatives to Valparaiso, Indiana, to offer Arthur J. Bowserthe paper for $800. Bowser and Lawyer S.D. Watson resumed publication of the Chesterton Tribune on 2 April 1884. The partners also decided to expand their paper to the town of Porter, Indiana, United States of America. Watson decided to give up his share to Bowser in September of 1884. The journal was published every Saturday and had seven columns of print. In April of 1896 the Chesterton and Porter editions of the Tribune were combined to create the Westchester Tribune. Since the post office would not renew the postal permit with the new name, Bowser had to change the name back to the Chesterton Tribune in November of 1897. In 1910, the price of a yearly subscription to the paper rose from $1.50 a year to $2.00 a year. Warren R. Canright and Phyllis Post, a couple living in Chesterton, Indiana, purchased the Chesterton Tribune. In 1961 the Chesterton Tribune changed from a weekly to a daily newspaper. In 1999 the Canrights published the Chesterton Tribune with their son, David Canright, as the editor and chief. In 2018 David Canright now owns the Tribune and the Chesterton Tribune Company is still the publisher. The Chesterton Tribune can be found at 193 S. Calumet, Chesterton, IN 46304. The Tribune still continues to print daily and offers many different tools on their website, chestertontribune.com. Since 2018 the paper currently has 4,409 subscriptions and costs $36 a year.  Current status  In 2018, David Canright is listed as the owner of the Tribune and the Chesterton Tribune Company. He is still the publisher. The Chesterton Tribune can be found at 193 S. Calumet, Chesterton, IN 46304. The Tribune still continues to print daily and offers many different tools on their website, chestertontribune.com. Since 2018 the paper currently has 4,409 subscriptions and costs $36 a year.  Significant achievements  In the 1920s the Chesterton Tribune was one of the only papers in Indiana to refuse any publication about the Ku Klux Klan. During World War II Canright sent a free copy of the Tribune to all Chesterton and Porter soldiers. In 1970 the Chesterton Tribune switched to an offset printing process, the first paper in the country to do so. In 1961 the change from a weekly to daily newspaper was so out of step with the times that the change was mentioned by Time Magazine. The Chesterton Tribune is the oldest continuously published independent newspaper in Northwest Indiana. Northwest Indiana is the Calumet Region of Indiana that associates itself more with the city of Chicago than Indianapolis.

The common name is derived from the fact that the species was at first thought to be a member of the genus Hemisaga until it was realised that its unique characteristics warranted placing it in a new genus. Description This is a large long-legged bush cricket with short wings. It can be distinguished from Alinjarria jadoni, the only other species in the genus, by the elongation of the male's cerci which have a noticeably larger internal flange. The female's cerci are also distinctive because they curve outwards. Distribution This species is found in tropical northwestern Australia, with a range extending from Darwin to Mataranka in the Northern Territory. It is a woodland species, also found in bushes and scrub. Ecology Like all bush crickets, Alinjarria elongata is a predator. It has been observed in the daytime in shrubs, tall vegetation and rough grasses, catching insects. In the night-time it has been seen in sorghum crops, feeding on scarab beetles and on other species of bush cricket.

Since this magnitude is reached during the most powerful outbursts, while less bright outbursts can occur, it is classified as a SU Ursae Majoris variable. Variability The variability of LL Andromedae is similar to the WZ Sagittae type of dwarf novae. Those have a long outbursts cycle (they were observed only in 1979, 1994 and 2004) and superhumps can be observed with a short periodic modulation.

However, in comparison to WZ Sagittae, the outburst amplitude is small and the superoutbursts duration is short. System Little is known about the components of LL Andromedae because it's a faint object; one of the two components is likely an accreting white dwarf like in all dwarf novae.

During his career, he played as a forward and a central defender. He began his career with Bristol City where he made his professional debut before being released in 1995. He joined Cardiff City where he made three appearances in the Football League before moving to Oxford United. After a single appearance, he was released by Oxford and dropped into non-league football. Career Born in Bristol, Milsom began his career with his hometown club Bristol City. He made his professional debut for the club during the 1993‚Äì94 season but was released in March 1995 having made two further appearances. He joined Cardiff City, making two appearances as a substitute before starting in a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Bristol Rovers before being released at the end of the season. He subsequently signed for Oxford United, making one appearance for the club in the Football League Trophy, before dropping out of professional football. He signed for Gloucester City in 1995, scoring on his debut against Chelmsford City. In two seasons at Meadow Park, he scored 13 goals and 60 appearances. After spells with Trowbridge Town and Clevedon Town, Milsom signed for Bath City on a two-year contract in July 2001 for a fee between ¬£2000 and ¬£3000, rejecting an offer from Worcester City. A first team regular for two seasons, he made over 60 appearances in all competitions for Bath, before joining Tiverton Town in 2003. He made his debut for the club on 20 September 2003 in a 3‚Äì3 draw with Chelmsford City and scored his first goal two months later in a 1‚Äì0 victory over Dover Athletic. At Tiverton, Milsom also began playing as a central defender. He made over 100 appearances for the club before leaving in 2006. Milsom spent one season with Chippenham Town before joining Mangotsfield United in 2007. He was appointed manager of Mangotsfield during the 2007‚Äì08 season and helped the club avoid relegation after winning five consecutive matches. The following season, he was fired in January 2009 as the club struggled with Milsom blaming financial issues at the club, stating his budget had been \\"cut, and cut, and cut again.\\" In March 2011, Milsom was appointed joint-manager of Paulton Rovers along with Mark Harrington.

The series premiered on June 18, 2019 on the Oprah Winfrey Network.Trailer: The Series Premiere of \\"Ambitions\\"  Ambitions  Oprah Winfrey Network Oprah Winfrey Network Official YouTube Channel, May 7, 2019 The second half of the first season debuted on OWN, November 12, 2019. In January 2020, OWN canceled the series after one season. Premise Ambitions explores the sexy, deceitful machinations of love, power and politics in America's hottest urban mecca, Atlanta, Georgia. The action revolves around two intense rivalries. The first has formidable legal eagles Stephanie Carlisle (Robin Givens) and Amara Hughes (Essence Atkins), former best friends from Spelman College, as adversaries in both their personal and professional lives. At the story's inception, Amara and her husband, Titus Hughes (Kendrick Cross), move to Atlanta for a fresh start. Stephanie, who is married to Evan Lancaster (Brian J. White), the city mayor, is driven to ruin Amara's marriage over an old conflict over who would become Titus's long-term love interest. The second is between two powerful families‚Äîthe Carlisles (who own a major law firm) and the Purifoys (who own a large pharmaceutical corporation). The series features themes such as infidelity, blackmail, stalking, murder, gentrification, racism, intra-racial class stratification and the American opioid crisis, which ground the show in contemporary issues. Unforgettable strivers like Mayor Lancaster's sister and round-the-way diner owner Rondell Lancaster (Brely Evans) and his mistress Mexican-American fashion designer Bella Tru (Erica Page) round out the ensemble cast of regulars.

Description  Gettyia is known from a single right tarsometatarsus. This bone was similar to that of other North American avisaurids such as Avisaurus and Mirarce, but it was much smaller. The second metatarsal had a tubercule (knob-like structure) on its front edge, which likely connected to the tibialis cranialis muscle which flexes the ankle. Other avisaurids typically had this tubercule located midway on the shaft of the metatarsal, or closer to the ankle than the toes. Gettyia, on the other hand, had its tibialis cranialis tubercule located more than halfway down the shaft. The third and fourth metatarsals are more extensively fused than in other avisaurids, as fusion occurs not only near the ankle, but also near the toes.  Paleobiology  The more distally placed tibialis cranialis tubercule of Gettyia suggests that it had a more specialized lifestyle compared to other avisaurids. Zeffer & Norberg (2003) have found that living birds with a distally placed tibialis cranialis tubercules were biomechanically inclined to emphasize force of flexion, rather than speed. Birds of prey in particular utilize forceful flexion during their hunting behavior. Arboreal parrots and other climbing birds also make use of forceful flexion to obtain stability while foraging or hanging from tree branches. More terrestrial birds typically need more speed and less force, to assist locomotion like walking and hopping.  Paleoecology  Gettyia is known from the humid low-lying swamps, lakes, and river basins of the western shore of the Western Interior Seaway, and from the much more arid uplands between that area and the Cordilleran Overthrust Belt which eventually formed the Rocky Mountains.  Classification  Gettyia was originally named Avisaurus gloriae by Varrichio and Chiappe (1995) for MOR 553E/6.19.91.64, a tarsometatarsus from the late Campanian Upper Two Medicine Formation of Glacier County, Montana, USA. The species name honors Gloria Siebrecht, a volunteer fossil collector at the Museum of the Rockies who discovered the specimen. A new partial skeleton of an enantiornithean that would come to be known as Mirarce prompted Atterholt et al. (2018) to re- evaluate avisaurid taxonomy. They found that Mirarce was intermediate between \\"Avisaurus\\" gloriae and Avisaurus archibaldi, showing that the two \\"Avisaurus\\" species were not actually members of a single monophyletic genus. To solve this problem, they created the genus name Gettyia for Avisaurus gloriae, honoring the late Mike Getty.

The book describes his undercover experiment as a Turkish migrant worker in West Germany over the span of two years.  Overview  Wallraff assumes the identity of a Turkish man named Ali Sigirlioƒülu. Wallraff opts to disguise himself for his experiment. He alters his appearance by wearing contact lenses and a wig to make himself appear younger, and additionally adopts what he considers to be a stereotypical cartoon accent and affect. Wallraff publishes an ad in a newspaper as Ali Sigirlioƒülu, stating his willingness to work any job, including hard labor. He takes on various jobs as an unqualified worker, including work as a farmhand, a McDonald‚Äôs fast food worker, and an emergency response worker in a nuclear power plant. Wallraff concludes his undercover experiment after two years as a result of the physical strain and health problems the various jobs caused him.  Conclusions and observations  Wallraff‚Äôs conclusions from his experiment reflect the xenophobic treatment and exploitation he faced while playing the role of a young Turkish migrant worker. He underlines the risks he experiences, such as a employers lacking protective equipment for workers, poor work environments and the low wages offered to migrant workers. Wallraff also notes how the laborers are treated like disposable tools and not people. He also recounts the social isolation he faced as a Turkish man, describing various incidents where individuals would insult, berate or threaten him without provocation.  Reception  The book was very successful upon publication, with more than four million copies being sold within the original German run, and being translated into 30 languages and distributed in several countries. It became Germany‚Äôs largest literary post-World War II success. The publication of Wallraff‚Äôs book increased the European public‚Äôs interest in the mistreatment and social isolation of foreign workers. There were also investigations into illegal employment agencies as a result.

She is an assistant professor and at Ohio State University in the landscape architecture section of the Knowlton School of Architecture.  Background and education  Lipschitz grew up in Little Rock, Arkansas. She attended Harvard University's Graduate School of Design and earned a Master of Landscape Architecture. She also has a Bachelor of Art in environmental aesthetics from Pomona College, where she graduated cum laude.  Professional career  Lipschitz‚Äô research focuses contemporary agro-industrial activities and food security. Her position at Ohio State University is funded by the Initiative for Food and AgriCultural Transformation, a program that focuses on food security. She is particularly interested in meat and fish production, receiving a grant in 2014 to study catfish production, processing, and distribution centers in the American South. Her graduate school thesis focused on poultry production in Northwest Arkansas; she critiqued its environmental and social impacts while exploring opportunities to make it more ecologically-supportable and productive. She has also explored the role of geospatial analysis in understanding agricultural landscape systems, and she leads workshops on new applications for geographic information systems. Her research seeks to find examples of agriculture that is harmonious with local ecology and fulfills important social functions. Her work with catfish farming explores whether the ponds that compose the farms are an example of good ecology in an agricultural setting, noting how the farms mimic the natural wetlands of the deep south. Working with Justine Holzman, Lipschitz discovered that these areas are essential to migrating waterfowl. Lipschitz also discovered that catfish farming has an important social role as a source of employment. She recently spearheaded an exhibition with Justine Holzman, On the Pond, which uses photographs, text, maps, and digital art to make the case for catfish farming as important sustainable agriculture. Her advocacy around catfish farming has led to an interest in how to represent information about landscapes, and her most recent work explores the role geospatial analysis can play in rethinking landscapes of American agriculture. As a professor, Lipschitz teaches both studio and seminar courses. Topics include landscape planning and geographic information systems. She was previously Suzanne L. Turner Professor at Louisiana State University in the school of landscape architecture. She and Holzman also teach geographic information systems and geovisualization at other schools, including the University of Tennessee Knoxville. The workshops emphasize new methods for designing with geospatial data.

It provided resources to marginalised communities and worked to counter homophobia and discrimination against sexual minorities in the Namibian community. At its inception, TRP was the only organisation of its kind to focus on injustice against and abuse of sexual minorities in the country; this contrasted with other prominent Namibian LGBT organisations, such as Sister Namibia, which primarily supported lesbians. TRP focused on distributing resources throughout the LGBT community, including education, social services and suicide-prevention counselling. It conducted advocacy work, and began documenting hate crimes against sexual minorities in 2006. The TRP worked to remove negative stereotypes of the community. Notable examples include responding to official government reports demonstrating that heterosexuals engaging in unprotected intercourse are the main transmitters of HIV in Namibia and promoting HIV‚ÄìAIDS prevention strategies which are sensitive to the experiences of sexual minorities, free of homophobic misinformation.  Origins  From 1915 to 1989, Namibia was governed by South Africa; under that country's apartheid government, homosexuality was condemned. When Namibia became independent and SWAPO came to power, LGBT Namibians hoped that they would finally be able to live in peace. Although SWAPO had a political platform of \\"equality for all Namibians\\", LGBT people were not granted equality under their leadership. In 1996, the Rainbow Project was formed in response to what was seen as SWAPO's political homophobia. Ashley Currier described SWAPO's discrimination as directed against the LGBT community and women, characterising their leadership as \\"masculinist\\", with political homophobia a tactic permitting maintenance of the status quo. TRP collaborated with Sister Namibia to respond to public attacks (verbal and physical) on sexual minorities in the country, developing networks with international human-rights and LGBT organisations to draw national attention to the \\"invisibility\\" of their community. Although social and economic \\"material realities of extremely high HIV prevalence, sexual violence, gender inequality, tribalism and underemployment\\" were experienced to some degree by most Namibians, their impact was compounded for the LGBT community. TRP's founders were primarily white and coloured LGBT, middle-class, non-Namibians. By 1997 the organisation's membership was mainly young, black, unemployed Namibians, and many of the original white and coloured members drifted away. With economic challenges an issue for more members at this time, debates began about whether TRP should expand its social services or devote limited resources to launching public legal-reform campaigns. The following year, affinity groups were formed in TRP to meet specific member needs; they included the Women's Caucus (later known as the Different Identities Group), the Male Think Tank, and the Rainbow Youth.  LGBT advocacy  TRP's advocacy began with public protests and press conferences to address the government's anti-homosexuality, hosting public coming out testimonials to encourage \\"open sexual expression in the broader Namibian society.\\" The organisation began holding public forums during the annual Namibian Human Rights Awareness Week in 2000. = Talking Pink = TRP's Talking Pink was an award-winning weekly radio show which featured LGBT issues. In 1999, after Minister of Home Affairs Jerry Ekandjo said that there were no homosexuals in Namibia, the show broadcast an episode with a recording of Ekandjo's claim followed by a recording of \\"TRP members declaring their ethnic and sexual identities\\". Talking Pink later became a vehicle for introducing Namibian communities to LGBT-themed films. = Anti-sodomy legal reform campaign = At a 1998 meeting, TRP began organising their first public legal-reform campaign to address the decriminalisation of sodomy; according to the organisation, the law against sodomy was \\"inherited from the colonial regime\\". LGBT activists from South Africa's National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality (NCGLE) collaborated with TRP to develop a plan for the campaign in light of Namibia's volatile political climate regarding LGBT-identified people. TRP was also consulted by Namibia's Legal Assistance Centre on how best to proceed with their campaign. The LAC, initially on behalf of TRP, worked to clarify the Namibian prosecutor's interpretation and enforcement of anti-sodomy laws. The centre later continued the public campaign without TRP, since the latter's visibility made them targets for SWAPO's increasing anti-gay antagonism. SWAPO members' hostility toward the LGBT community, ranging from threats to increased penalties for sodomy and calls for the police to \\"eliminate homosexuals from Namibia\\", increased from 1998 through 2000. In light of the SWAPO response, the public campaign was reduced to compelling public officials to clarify how the law would be enforced. As recently as 2006, however, TRP director Ian Swartz continued to publicly condemn the nation's criminalisation of sodomy: \\"The government should be taken to court over male-to-male sodomy legislation ... How is it that with a history like ours where people were dehumanised, we ‚Äî 15 years after independence ‚Äî still have a situation where government decides who you should have sex with, and criminalises sexual behaviour between two consenting adults?\\" = Combatting SWAPO anti- homosexuality = In an August 26, 2005 Heroes‚Äô Day speech, Namibian deputy minister of home affairs and immigration Teopolina Mushelenga said that \\"lesbians and gay men betrayed the fight for Namibian freedom, are responsible for the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and are an insult to African culture\\". Outright International, an international LGBTQ human-rights organisation based in New York City, reported that three organisations ‚Äì the Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe (GALZ), Sister Namibia, and TRP ‚Äì issued individual responses to Mushelenga's speech. On September 8 of that year, TRP's statement condemned Mushelenga's speech as a \\"direct attack against the civil rights of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people of Namibia\\". The organisation called for the resignations of the minister and Namibian president Hifikepunye Pohamba, saying that Mushelenga's endorsement of homophobia posed a threat to all Namibians. TRP issued a July 2006 statement condemning former SWAPO president Sam Nujoma, who called National Society for Human Rights founder and director Phil ya Nangoloh \\"homosexual\\". When they were in power, SWAPO carried out government-sanctioned repression of LGBT- identified and -suspected individuals across Namibia. TRP said that Nujoma's use of \\"homosexual\\" to refer to ya Nangoloh was an attempt to use him \\"as a scapegoat to avert attention from the current controversies within the SWAPO Party\\", appealing to Pohamba to condemn the verbal attack and \\"maintain his government‚Äôs pro-human rights stance\\".  Contributions  TRP opened and operated a homeless shelter, resource centre, and soup kitchen to address the social and economic hardship of the Rainbow Youth. From the late 1990s to 2007, the soup kitchen was open twice a week and served the majority young, black and unemployed membership. The resource centre provided and maintained entertainment materials and a collection of literature on safe-sex practices, HIV/AIDS, and international LGBT human-rights organisations. It held organisational meetings, public forums and coming-out testimonials, community social events, and empowerment workshops on sexual and gender identity, self- esteem and body image. In 2007, due to its use by non-LGBT-identified homeless youth, the shelter was closed. Empowerment workshops led by TRP featured self- awareness training, which consisted of \\"teaching how to distinguish between lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender identities; exploring ideas of traditional homosexuality in ethnic identity terms; reconciling being lesbian or gay and Christian; and encouraging open discussion about sexual desires in order to combat vulnerability to HIV infection\\". At the workshops, the public telling (and retelling) of coming-out stories took place for the Rainbow Youth. Workshops dealing with the societal tension between religious and sexual identities and religious persecution lead to the 2003 creation of the Namibian Assistance Project. Through this initiative, in partnership with Inclusive and Affirming Ministries, TRP \\"offered Christian religious training to help ease the moral uncertainties between sexual and Christian identities\\". TRP community social events, like their movie nights, were attended by women who did not identify as LGBT because they provided an enjoyable, safe space where they would not be bothered by heterosexual men.  Challenges  Although TRP provided workshops, literature, and counselling to encourage safe-sex practices among LGBT-identified Namibians, it was argued that lack of information could not be considered the sole deterrent to safer sex. Unravelling Taboos: Gender and Sexuality in Namibia authors wrote that the scarcity of economic resources, gender inequality and social stigma pose difficulties in practicing safer sex which are not addressed by TRP. The organisation's HIV-education work with LGBT youth encountered difficulty from men who self-identified as heterosexual while engaging in homosexual sex and refusing to wear condoms, because they believed that HIV was a disease which only homosexuals could contract.  Criticism  Robert Lorway published Namibia's Rainbow Project in 2015, examining the unintended consequences of the organisation's neoliberal shift after 2007. TRP's principal donor was Hivos in the Netherlands; most of Hivos' leadership self-identified as coloured and white, university-educated South Africans, and TRP's Rainbow Youth was composed of poor, black Namibians without a university education. Lorway, a medical anthropologist working with the Rainbow Youth, wrote that the organisational shift was inconsistent with the concerns of TRP's members. He described a February 2008 meeting at which the Rainbow Youth aired grievances with the organisation's new direction of, writing that it did not produce the social and economic emancipation they sought. Lorway described the period as produced by \\"TRP's unwitting collusion with wider neoliberal power arrangements taking place in Southern Africa at the time\\", outlining the \\"unintended consequences\\" of TRP's LGBT intervention as \\"the pursuit of females to become 'like men' in order to escape sexual violence that leads to the intensification of their oppression at the hands of men; the longings for 'real men' by young feminine males who yearn for love, intimacy, and social acceptance that ends in their severe physical and sexual abuse; and the fetishisation of foreign and local gay elites by impoverished young males in search for greater social mobility and erotic freedom that results in the loss of the bargaining power during negotiations about safer sex\\". In Out in Africa, Ashley Currier wrote that TRP and similar regional organisations could not function without these private, \\"northern\\" donors; they provided the resources to maintain safe spaces, which provided visibility for the community. To maintain this funding, however, the organisations were expected to adapt the \\"hierarchical structure and centralised decision-making\\" of Western NGOs to prove themselves worthy of funding (which made them less transparent to the communities they served). As the organisation focused on legal rights and recognition for LGBT people in Namibia, some local members criticised its shift from social work to political action.

She was a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council postdoctoral fellow at Duke University with Yang Weitao from 2007 to 2010. They developed fractional spin density functional theory to describe open-shell singlet diradicals. She looked at the energy splitting between spin-states, connecting them to the ionisation potential and electron affinity. A major contribution of her postdoctoral research was the development of the non-covalent interaction index. This index describes the non-covalent interactions in a range of chemical applications, and is fast to compute, making it able to handle large systems. The non-covalent interaction index can be plotted in real space, which allows the inter- and intra-molecular interactions present in the system to be visualised.  Independent academic career  Johnson joined the faculty of the School of Natural Sciences at the University of California, Merced as an assistant professor in 2010. In February 2015, she relocated to the Department of Chemistry at Dalhousie University as the Herzberg‚ÄìBecke Chair in Theoretical Chemistry. She was promoted to Full Professor at Dalhousie in 2018.  Research  In her independent career, Johnson has continued to develop and apply methods for London dispersion interactions using density functional theory. These applications include molecular crystals, organometallic complexes, and layered solids. Johnson has applied her dispersion-corrected density functional theory methods to crystal structure prediction. Her group successfully predicted the most stable polymorph of a variety of molecular crystals using dispersion-corrected density functional theory. She has worked on charge-transfer complexes and how charge is transferred between electron donors (such as NH3, C2H4) and electron acceptors (F2, Cl2). She studied 2D electrides, alkalides and transition-metal diatomics. In 2017, she collaborated with Kim Jelfs to predict the relative stabilities of polymorphs of aza-6-helicene from first principles.

He held important positions at multiple observatories throughout his career, namely deputy director of the Strasbourg Observatory and director of the G√∂ttingen Observatory. His main work was in astrometry, although he focused on publishing astronomical catalogues in his later life.  Early life  Wilhelm Schur was born on 15 April 1846 in Altona, Hamburg, to the wine merchant Friedrich Wilhelm Schur and his wife Johanna Torm√§hlen. Schur showed mathematical prowess early in his life, entering and winning a mathematics competition organised by the Educational Association of Schleswig-Holstein and Lauenburg at the age of 14. As grandson of Adolph Cornelius Petersen (28 July 1804 ‚Äì 3 February 1854), the director of the Altona Observatory, Schur took numerous opportunities to acquaint himself with astronomy. Following Petersen's death, he shadowed Heinrich Wilhelm Theodor Seeling, an astronomer at the observatory, and made numerous simple astronomical observations and calculations. By 1864 Schur was attending a polytechnic in Hamburg. That summer, he enrolled at the University of Kiel, where he studied mathematics and astronomy under Georg Daniel Eduard Weyer, physics under Gustav Karsten, and philosophy under Friedrich Harms. In the winter semester of 1864/1865 he transferred to the University of G√∂ttingen, where he studied mathematics under Moritz Stern and Karl Hattendorff, physics under Wilhelm Eduard Weber, and astronomy under Wilhelm Klinkerfues, whom Schur was particularly fond of. In April 1867 he published his first astronomical paper, titled \\"Bahnbestimmung des Doppelsterns Œ£ 3062\\" (\\"Orbit determination of the double star Œ£ 3062\\"), in the Astronomische Nachrichten journal. In October of the same year he earned a PhD, under the advisory of Klinkerfues, with a thesis titled \\"Untersuchungen √ºber die Bahn des Doppelsterns 70 p Ophiuchi\\" (\\"Studies on the orbit of the double star 70 p Ophiuchi\\"). In the winter of 1867/1868 Schur moved to the University of Berlin, where he attended lectures in astronomy by Arthur von Auwers and Wilhelm Foerster and in physics by Heinrich Wilhelm Dove, Johann Christian Poggendorff, and Georg Quincke.  Career and later life  While at the University of Berlin, Schur briefly worked with von Auwers on understanding observations made by English astronomer James Bradley. From November 1868 until the end of 1872 he worked as an assistant at the Royal Prussian Geodetic Institute, doing triangulation work in central Germany. He, however, sought to participate in the observation of the transit of Venus in 1874 and resigned from his post in 1872 to seek any opportunities to fulfill his wishes. He temporarily worked at the Berlin Observatory before being hired as an assistant at the Strasbourg Observatory in July 1873. Under the observatory's director, Friedrich Winnecke, Schur assisted in preparatory work for the expedition and joined the crew when they embarked for Auckland Island in July 1874. They arrived at their observation site in mid-October and observed the transit on December 9th, collecting data and finalizing measurements before embarking for home in June 1875. The expedition lasted 111 days in total.1874 Venus transit expedition crew to Auckland Island.alt= Upon his return, Schur continued his work at the observatory. He quickly climbed the ranks; he was promoted to an observer in 1877 and, when Winnecke fell ill in 1882, he took over direction of the observatory as deputy director. He oversaw the setup of astronomical instruments at the newly built observatory and made extensive observations and measurements using transit instruments and heliometers. In 1873 he made measurements of Jupiter's bands and in 1883 published \\"Bestimmung der Masse des Planeten Jupiter aus Heliometer-Beobachtungen der Abst√§nde seiner Satelliten\\" (\\"Determination of the mass of the planet Jupiter from heliometer observations of its satellites\\"). His work throughout this period was mainly focused on the apparent magnitude of variable stars and on the determination of comet orbits. Map of the alt= On Easter 1886 Schur was appointed to the University of G√∂ttingen as Professor of Practical Astronomy and Director of the G√∂ttingen Observatory. Throughout 1887/1888 he led a complete redevelopment of the observatory in which \\"almost only the walls remained untouched.\\" Major projects included the renewal of the main hall's roof and the replacement of the outdated dome with one manufactured by Grubb in Dublin, Ireland. In contrast to his predecessor, Wilhelm Klinkerfues, Schur was very successful in modernizing the inadequate equipment of the observatory, acquiring a new, large Repsold heliometer in 1888. In the following years Schur devoted all of his time to working with the new instrument. Among his most important works was the triangulation of the Beehive Cluster in 1894 and the two star clusters h Persei and œá Persei, which together form the Double Cluster, between 1891 and 1896. Averaging the results of his Beehive Cluster measurements led to 123 equations with 74 unknowns, which he resolved according to Gauss' method of least squares. The calculations were a tremendous amount of work and thus required 10 weeks to complete. In addition to his own research, Schur took on a number of other projects, including administrative and historical tasks. Together with an assistant, he catalogued and organised over 11,000 books and brochures in the observatory's library over a period of a year and a half, finishing in 1899 and leaving the library \\"in an orderly condition for the first time in 44 years.\\" In 1891 he published a star catalogue of 6000 astronomical objects, which his professor and fellow past director of the observatory Wilhelm Klinkerfues had observed from 1858 to 1869. In 1899 he published another catalogue, this time of comets and minor planets observed by Wilhelm Olbers from 1795 to 1831. For the 150th anniversary of the G√∂ttingen Academy of Sciences in 1901 he wrote a historical overview of the development of astronomy in the Kingdom of Hanover and neighbouring areas. At the beginning of 1901 Schur began exhibiting symptoms of severe stomach cancer and his health began to rapidly deteriorate. He was left housebound and could only partially continue his work. He failed to recover and died in the evening hours of 1 July 1901.  Personal life = Family = Schur's father was the Altona wine merchant Friedrich Wilhelm Schur (1817 ‚Äì 1865) and his mother was Johanna Helene Antoinette Thorm√§len (born 1820). His grandfather on his father's side was the child of Johann Carl Andreas Schur, a Berlin pharmacist who moved to Altona in 1796 and founded a soap factory. In 1832 his grandfather's widow married Adolph Cornelius Petersen, the director of the Altona Observatory and co-editor of the Astronomische Nachrichten journal. During his time in Strasbourg, Schur met Lucie Thorn (born 1852), the eldest daughter of a general practitioner in Neuwied, whom he married on 29 September 1883. They never had any children. = Personality = In 1898 Martin Brendel was appointed to the University of G√∂ttingen as Professor of Theoretical Astronomy and Geodesy. In the three years leading to Schur's death, Brendel knew him as an extremely conscientious and lovable colleague, saying:  Relationship with colleagues  Schur, like Wilhelm Klinkerfues, suffered due to the division of the G√∂ttingen Observatory into theoretical and practical wings, which caused needless conflict and only ended after 1897. Despite this, he attempted to maintain friendly relations with everyone.

A formerly lost novel, it was first published in 1991, 53 years after Wolfe's death. The book was found, edited, and produced by Suzanne Stutman, a Wolfe scholar who also edited the 2003 book My Other Loneliness: Letters of Thomas Wolfe and Aline Bernstein. It has been described as a novel, but also as a \\"novel-length fragment\\", a \\"hastily... lashed together... welter of vignettes\\" making for \\"an unfinished novel\\", and \\"not so much a novel as it is a rich collection of reminiscences and tableaux\\" Wolfe wrote it around 1930, as part of a huge epic series to be called \\"The October Fair\\". The Good Child's River was meant to be a part of Wolfe's 1935 novel Of Time and the River, but most of it was never typed from the three handwritten ledgers which Stutman found in the William B. Wisdom Thomas Wolfe Collection of Harvard's Houghton Library manuscript collection. What had been typed had been included in the posthumously edited and published 1939 novel, The Web and the Rock as well as in From Death to Morning and Of Time and the River. Unlike Wolfe's major novels, The Good Child's River doesn't include either Eugene Gant or George Webber, Wolfe's fictional counterparts, but instead focuses on Webber's lover, Esther Jack (based on Aline Bernstein). Bernstein made many notes about her life for Wolfe, who fashioned the material into The Good Child's River (Bernstein also used some of the same material in her autobiography, An Actor's Daughter). Reviews Frank Levering described the novel as \\"an exotic, unique experience for the reader... Esther Jack is a compelling character ‚Äì a girl and young woman with an open mind and a clear-eyed passion for life as it comes. Through her eyes, aunts, cousins, schoolmates, her mother and friends of the family come alive vividly ‚Äì a parade of flawed humanity on the streets of old New York.\\" Publishers Weekly wrote that Wolfe's \\"storytelling genius, vital and chaotic, emerges\\" in the book and that \\"Reading these lyrical, effusive pages is to take an invigorating plunge in the swarming sea of Wolfe's imagination\\". Donald Newlove wrote that \\"The Good Child's River is not minor Wolfe. Readers who come fresh to it, never before having read Wolfe, may well be stunned by his power, and may start questioning the skinny little sentences and squeaks of feeling in today's writers. The rest of us will be replenished and exhilarated. Nobody writes for full orchestra any more.\\" Kirkus Reviews said that \\"The novel is a meditation, in Wolfe's boldest style, on time as a dark, rich river\\" and that although \\"there are clinkers about the Jews, things Esther would never say or think, and some of his women are sticks... all is forgiven in the sheer magic of Wolfe unbound\\", the whole resulting in \\"An often stunningly disciplined first draft ‚Äì by a genius.\\" ReferencesFurther reading * Novels by Thomas Wolfe 1991 American novels Novels published posthumously Novels set in New York City ","title":"The Good Child's River"},{"id":"59047363","text":"Anne Abeja (n√©e Anne Abeja), is a Ugandan lawyer and corporate executive, who, since October 2013, serves as the Company Secretary and head of the legal department at Housing Finance Bank, a Ugandan retail commercial bank.

The State of Kerala, ruling that all pilgrims regardless of their biological gender, including women in the menstruating age group, should be allowed to enter Sabarimala. Previously, women between the ages of 10 to 50 were not allowed to enter the temple. Representing an organisation named People for Dharma, J.

Early life Tynte was baptized on 4 February 1649, the only son of John Tynte and his wife Jane Halswell, daughter of Hugh Halswell of Halswell, Goathurst. He matriculated at Hart Hall, Oxford in 1666. His father died in 1669 and he succeeded to the estates. In 1671, he was admitted at Middle Temple. He married Grace Fortescue (buried 22 March 1694), daughter of Robert Fortescue of Buckland Filleigh, Devon, under a settlement dated 6 February 1671. In 1672, he succeeded to the Halswell estates of his grandfather Hugh Halswell. Career Halswell HouseTynte was appointed Deputy Lieutenant for Somerset in about 1672 and JP and commissioner for assessment in 1673. He was created baronet on 26 January 1674. From 1674 to 1675 he was High Sheriff of Somerset. He was also a Commissioner for Recusants in 1675 By 1679 he was of Colonel of the Somerset Militia. At the first general election of 1679, he was caught up in a double return at Bridgwater, but was returned as Member of Parliament for the borough then and in the second election in October 1679. He was appointed to committees to consider bills to speed up the conviction of recusants and for security against Popery, and to investigate abuses in the Post Office. He voted against exclusion, but was not recorded as speaking. In 1680 he ceased to be Commissioner for Assessment. He was re- elected MP for Bridgwater in 1681 but also in 1681 ceased to be Deputy Lieutenant for Somerset. He lost his seat on the bench in 1683 but it was restored in 1684. Also in 1684, he was deprived of his militia regiment. In 1685, he was re-elected MP for Bridgwater in against strong Tory opposition. In Parliament he was named only to the committees to prevent the export of wool and to encourage woollen manufacture. In 1689, he became Commissioner for Assessment again until 1690, and Deputy Lieutenant until 1691 At the Revolution, seven of his horses were seized by the Dutch. He was not reappointed to the lieutenancy in 1691, and two years later lost his seat on the bench as a non-juror. Death and legacy Tynte was buried at Goathurst on 7 April 1702. He had four sons, of whom two survived him, and three daughters. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son John.

The book provides a philosophical analysis of the theoretical foundation of the Marxist school of thought developed by Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong, Maoism. Moufawad-Paul argues that the political ideology of Maoism, despite being formulated in the 1960s, only achieved full theoretical maturity in 1988 in Peru. Synopsis The book is introduced as an attempt by Moufawad-Paul to reclaim Maoism, as a contemporary political ideology and contest the negative conceptualizations by Trotskyists and Anarchists in the political left. For Moufawad-Paul, Maoism must be understood as being both a continuation of Leninist political, philosophical and strategic positions, while simultaneously, acting as a rupture from the dogmatic orthodoxy and theoretical limits of standard Marxism-Leninism, thus Maoism is characterized as both continuity and rupture. Throughout the work, Moufawad-Paul offers a critique of contemporary and historical Maoist organizations, such as The Revolutionary Communist Party USA, The Shining Path, The Naxalite insurgency in India, and The New People's Army, as well as contemporary Marxist intellectuals, Slavoj Zizek, Alain Badiou, and Tom Clark (author of State and Counter-Revolution). =The Terrain of Maoism-qua- Maoism= Moufawad-Paul premises his work on five axioms, which are introduced in chapter one: # The distinction between \\"Mao Zedong Thought\\" and \\"Marxism‚ÄìLeninism‚ÄìMaoism\\" (what he calls \\"Maoism-qua-Maoism\\") # Maoism, as a political ideology began in 1988 with the formation of The Communist Party of Peru, the first self-labelled Maoist party that conceived Maoism as a \\"third stage\\" of revolutionary science # Historical Materialism is a science due to its ability to explain historical phenomenon # Maoism as a third stage of revolutionary science that is both a continuity and rupture from Marxism- Leninism # To understand Maoism, one must understand the theoretical limitations of Marxism-Leninism. =Science's Dogmatic Shadow= In the second chapter, Moufawad-Paul introduces his argument that Marxism, in contrast to contemporary intellectual consensus, is not simply a philosophy, but a science, specifically Marx's theory of historical materialism. =The General Limits of Marxism-Leninism= In the third chapter, Moufawad-Paul discusses the inherent contradictions within the ideology of standard Marxism-Leninism. According to Moufawad-Paul, within a Marxist-Leninist Vanguard Party if understood through Lenin's What is to be Done?, is a party that represents the working class but is limited by the conception of \\"the general staff of the proletariat.\\" Writing in response to Marxist writer Tom Clark's State and Counter Revolution, Moufawad-Paul concludes that the dialectical conflict between the working-class character of socialism and the petite-bourgeoisie character of the Vanguard Party is resolved through the application of the Maoist strategy of the mass line, wherein the Vanguard Party is further developed through the mass line. =A New Anti-Revisionism= In this chapter Moufawad-Paul defends the concept of Anti-Revisionism, which is an essential component of Maoist ideology, anti-revisionism is the Marxist position opposing alteration or \\"revision\\" of the established Marxist-Leninist ideology that had been developed in the Soviet Union following the death of Joseph Stalin (though Moufawad-Paul is also critical of Stalin's conception of Marxism-Leninism, treating it as a limit transgressed by Maoism). Moufawad- Paul defends this concept along using the logic of his conception of Maoism as a continuity of and rupture from Marxism-Leninism. Maufawad-Paul explains that any new conception of Anti-Revisionism must be understood within the dialectical interrelation between continuity and rupture within Maoism. =Maoism or Trotskyism= Continuity and Rupture contains an additional essay titled \\"Maoism or Trotskyism\\" which evaluates Maoism and Trotskyism as derivative forms of Leninism and their mutual claim to be the continuation of the Leninist political philosophy that led the October Revolution. Reception J. Moufawad-Paul's work received a positive reception among Marxist critics. Historian Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz and social activist Gabriel Kuhn both provide positive reviews of the book in the cover section. Hamayon Rastgar in Marx and Philosophy gave a positive review of the book, writing, \\"Moufawad-Paul makes an appealing case for a return to the revolutionary kernel of communism through understanding the most contemporary stage of the development of the ideology and science of revolution, namely Maoism.\\" J. Moufawad-Paul's work received a negative reception among some circles of Maoist activists in the United States.

In 2015, state lawmakers forced the school administration to select an independent financial manager to oversee the district's finances and remove oversight from the board of trustees. However, Governor Eric Holcomb, citing the district's persistently high financial debt, signed a law in April 2017 to replace Pruitt's decision-making powers with a state-appointed emergency management team, thus designating it as the first public school system in the state of Indiana involved in a state takeover. Pruitt announced her resignation in December 2017. In 2018, the district's emergency management team requested an audit of financial transactions during Pruitt's tenure as Superintendent. As a part of the audit, Pruitt was charged with theft and official misconduct after submitting and receiving a personal reimbursement for a trip to an educational conference in 2016 that was originally paid for with a credit card by the school district. The charges were ultimately dismissed by prosecutors in June 2020. In May 2018, Pruitt joined the Chicago Virtual Charter School as CEO. She ultimately left the school a year later, after being embattled from the criminal case in Indiana.

The building was constructed in 1895 as a dormitory for the General Theological Seminary and is now owned by the Brodsky Organization and MCR Development. The hotel was opened in May 2013. History The land on which The High Line Hotel sits was once part of British Major Thomas Clarke's \\"Chelsea\\" estate, which was established in 1750 and is the namesake for the current surrounding neighborhood. The estate would eventually be passed down to Clarke's grandson, Clement Clarke Moore, who wrote his 1823 Christmas poem, \\"A Visit from St. Nicholas,\\" on the property. Moore also operated an apple orchard on the estate, which is where The High Line Hotel is now located. In the 1820s, Moore donated the land that contained the apple orchard to the Episcopal Church. It would become the home of the General Theological Seminary, which is still in operation at the location. The land, however, remained mostly undeveloped until 1878 when Eugene Augustus Hoffman was appointed dean. Hoffman hired architect Charles C. Haight to design a Neo Gothic-style campus based on the campus designs of Oxford and Cambridge University. The building that would become The High Line Hotel was completed as student housing in 1895 on 10th Avenue at West 20th Street. Hoffman Hall, the hotel's event and meeting space, was completed in 1899. In 2005, the building began housing guests for the Seminary's Desmond Tutu Conference Center. Due to mounting financial issues, the Seminary began selling off select buildings in 2010. It sold the building that would become The High Line Hotel to the Brodsky Organization and MCR Development in September 2012. The hotel's interior and decor were designed and curated by Roman and Williams. The High Line Hotel had a soft opening in May 2013 before its official grand opening in September 2013. Its name is a reference to its proximity to the High Line park. Since its opening, the hotel has hosted numerous events such as the Penny Dreadful premiere, People magazine's upfronts presentation, and the wedding of ballet dancers, Robert Fairchild and Tiler Peck. Design The High Line Hotel contains 60 guest rooms, a conference and event space in Hoffman Hall, an Intelligentsia Coffee & Tea location, and a seasonal restaurant in its front garden. A repurposed 1963 Citro√´n H Van also serves Intelligentsia coffee in the garden. The hotel is built in a Collegiate Gothic style, furnished with Victorian and Edwardian era antiques, rewired rotary dial telephones from the 1920s, vintage typewriters, and Tiffany lamps.

He was involved in the formation of Monroe County, Michigan, and held numerous official posts during the first decades of its existence, and was also a member of both the Michigan House of Representatives and Michigan Senate.  Biography  Laurent Durocher was born in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, on October 21, 1788, the son of Laurent Durocher and Marie Janis., cited in . He attended the Coll√®ge de Montr√©al. Durocher first came to the Michigan Territory in 1803 before settling at Frenchtown, Michigan in 1805. He volunteered to fight in the American army under General William Hull prior to the outbreak of the War of 1812. Following Hull's surrender of Detroit on August 16, 1812, Durocher and the other defenders of Frenchtown held out for two more days before surrendering their arms. Left free, but unarmed, they were unable to stop the Native Americans who began to pillage the town. Durocher remained there as a paroled prisoner of war until the town was recaptured by General James Winchester in the First Battle of Frenchtown. Durocher was one of several people who went to the Navarre House early the morning of August 22, 1813, to warn Winchester of reports that the British were reporting a surprise attack. The attack succeeded, Winchester was taken prisoner, and Durocher was a witness to the Raisin River Massacre that followed. He later wrote a defense of the prisoners of war of French descent, saying that, contrary to speculation, they remained ready to take up arms against the British even as prisoners of war. He served as the clerk of Monroe County, Michigan, for several years following its organization in 1818, as the county tax collector in 1824, and the supervisor of Frenchtown Township in 1834 and again from 1842 to 1848. Durocher was a member of all but the first of the territorial councils of Michigan Territory, as well as a delegate to the convention that drafted the first state constitution in 1835. Following adoption of the constitution, he was elected as a Democrat to the Michigan Senate and served during its first session in 1835 and 1836; he resigned before the end of the session, on July 9, 1836, citing a sickness in his family. He was later elected to the Michigan House of Representatives and served one term in 1839. He was a county probate judge in 1844, 1850, and 1852, and served as justice of the peace in the city of Monroe, in 1850 and 1853. He was serving as city clerk of Monroe when he died on September 21, 1861. He is buried at the Old Burial Ground in Monroe. = Family = Durocher married Monique Cosme, of Detroit, in Monroe on April 22, 1811.

At this time it was in the 52nd Army of Volkhov Front, taking part in the Lyuban Offensive Operation, which was planned to encircle and defeat the enemy forces laying siege to Leningrad. However, just at that time the German 18th Army was in the process of cutting off the Soviet Lyuban grouping in a pocket, and over the following months the division was nearly destroyed. Enough survivors emerged from the swamps in June and July to rebuild the unit, and it fought in the Second Sinyavino Offensive before it was shifted south into Kalinin Front to take part in the battle and siege of Velikiye Luki in December. In the summer of 1943 the 19th Guards fought in the battles for Smolensk, and won its first battle honor, \\"Rudnya\\". in September. During the offensive in the summer of 1944 it was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for its successes in the fighting around Vitebsk. It was further honored in February, 1945, with the Order of Lenin for its role in the victories in East Prussia. In the summer the division was moved by rail with its 39th Army to the Far East and saw action in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in August, winning its second battle honor, \\"Khingan\\", for its services. The division continued to see service well into the postwar era. Formation The division was officially raised to Guards status on March 17, 1942, although its sub-units would not be redesignated for a month or more. Its basic order of battle would eventually be: * 54th Guards Rifle Regiment (from 1218th Rifle Regiment) * 56th Guards Rifle Regiment (from 1220th Rifle Regiment) * 61st Guards Rifle Regiment (from 1222nd Rifle Regiment) * 45th Guards Artillery Regiment (from 938th Artillery Regiment)Charles C. Sharp, \\"Red Guards\\", Soviet Guards Rifle and Airborne Units 1941 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IV, Nafziger, 1995, p. 50 Col. Semyon Ivanovich Bulanov remained in command of the division, which was part of 52nd Army in Volkhov Front.Sharp states that it was in Leningrad Front, but this appears incorrect: Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, p. 61 This came just as the German 18th Army was in the process of cutting off and trapping parts of the 52nd and the 59th and all of 2nd Shock Army in the half-frozen wasteland south of Lyuban, and the division was already fighting for its existence. The encirclement was completed on March 20, but it was tenuous. On March 27 a gap was opened near the village of Miasnoi Bor, but it was only 3‚Äì5 km wide. The Red Army forces in the salient continued to operate under these circumstances through April and into May.David M. Glantz, The Battle for Leningrad 1941 - 1944, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2002, pp. 176-79 On May 12, Soviet intelligence indicated that 18th Army was about to attack again to cut the corridor. In light of this, orders came from the STAVKA to begin a phased withdrawal from the salient on May 14; when this proved impossible due to the depleted state of its forces, a full breakout and withdrawal was ordered on May 21.Glantz, Leningrad, pp. 196-99 Colonel Bulanov was recorded as missing in action on July 25. During June and July, individual soldiers and small parties of men of the 19th Guards found their way out of the pocket through the thinly-held German lines. They were formed up with survivors of the 25th Cavalry Division to rebuild the division.Sharp, \\"Red Guards\\", p. 50 Sinyavino and Velikiye Luki Col. David Markovich Barinov was assigned to command of the division on July 26; he would be promoted to major general on November 27. The Soviet high command was anticipating a German summer offensive near Leningrad (which was in fact being planned) and intended to forestall it with an offensive of its own. This attack would break the siege by penetrating the land corridor east of the city between the Neva and Naziia rivers, south of the village of Sinyavino. The \\"bottleneck\\" was heavily defended and fortified, and much of the terrain was peat bogs. The rebuilt 19th Guards was allocated to the 6th Guards Rifle Corps with the 3rd and 24th Guards and 265th Rifle Divisions, which formed the shock group of the 8th Army of Volkhov Front.Glantz, Leningrad, pp. 213-17 The overall offensive began on August 19, with 55th Army attacking across the Neva from Leningrad. 8th Army began its attack at 0210 hrs on August 27, striking the junction of the German 227th and 223rd Infantry Divisions on a 15 km front with about a four-to-one advantage in manpower. On the first day, the 24th Guards and 265th Divisions broke the boundary and forced their way across the Chernaya River. Early the next day the 19th Guards exploited the breakthrough, advancing 5 to 6 km and reaching the southeastern approaches to Sinyavino by nightfall. This promising start was soon stymied as German reserves, including elements of 96th and 170th Infantry Divisions assembled at Sinyavino. On the 29th the Tiger tank made its inauspicious combat debut when four were committed south of Sinyavino Heights; two of them broke down almost immediately and a third had its engine overheat. By the 31st 6th Guards Corps had suffered such severe attrition against fierce and skillful German resistance that its penetration was contained. Over September 5‚Äì6, 19th and 24th Guards were withdrawn from the salient, although a General Staff report on September 15 stated that the first part of this withdrawal by the 19th was unauthorized.Glantz, Leningrad, pp. 218-22, 229 As of October 1 the division was in 2nd Shock Army,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, p. 187 but having been withdrawn it escaped the second encirclement and breakout of that Army in late September.Glantz, Leningrad, pp. 226-27 By November 1 the rebuilding division had been moved south to the reserves of Kalinin Front in accordance with a directive from the STAVKA to that Front's commander, Lt. Gen. M. A. Purkaev, on October 13: At the beginning of December, as the battle for Velikiye Luki was underway, the 8th Corps was still in the reserves of Kalinin Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, p. 235 Within two weeks it was subordinated to 3rd Shock Army and committed to the battle to reduce the encircled garrison of Velikiye Luki, but most of this fighting was done by the two Estonian divisions while 19th Guards was attached to 5th Guards Rifle Corps as of December 12, holding off the German attempts to relieve the garrison. 61st Guards Rifle Regiment was subordinated to 9th Guards Rifle Division, while the rest of the 19th formed a second echelon behind 5th Guards Corps. On December 18 General Barinov left command of the division; he was replaced by Col. Ivan Dmitrievich Vasilev. The next German relief attempt began on December 20. Following an artillery preparation, five German tanks accompanied by infantry were seen near the village of Pupkova and were engaged by the 54th Guards Rifle Regiment and attached antitank guns, driving them back with the loss of one tank, but this was a diversion. By noon the main German attack had captured the village of Gromovo and was threatening the junction of two regiments of 9th Guards, so Maj. Gen. A. F. Beloborodov, commander of 5th Guards Corps, ordered the main forces of the 19th to back them up. By 1500 hrs. the junction had been forced, and the 61st Regiment, with the 6th Guards Machine Gun Battalion, was forced to hold the gap. By 1700 hrs. night was falling, and the division was able to report to General Beloborodov that: \\"The attacks are repulsed. The enemy has not advanced a single step.\\"http://militera.lib.ru/memo/russian/beloborodov2/09.html. In Russian. Retrieved Nov. 17, 2018. The German relief attempt was renewed on December 23 in the area around Pupkova. By the end of the day the gunners of the 19th, assisted by two ski brigades and the 36th Tank Brigade, had knocked out 17 panzers and driven the Germans back to their start line. On January 3, 1943, just before the next relief effort, the tip of the wedge driven by the German forces towards the city was defended in the first echelon by the 54th Guards Regiment and the 1193rd Regiment of the 360th Rifle Division, backed by that division's 1195th Regiment. A lapse in Soviet intelligence had failed to reveal newly-arrived enemy forces, which began another offensive on January 4. During this attack the 19th Guards held the perimeter of the wedge-shaped relief corridor from the west and northwest. The offensive made almost no gains after the 5th, and by the 12th had collapsed in exhaustion just 3 km from the western outskirts of Velikiye Luki. The remnants of the garrison surrendered on January 17.http://militera.lib.ru/memo/russian/beloborodov2/09.html. In Russian. Retrieved Nov. 17, 2018. Into Belarus On January 27 Colonel Vasilev handed his command over to Col. Dmitrii Tikhonovich Zhukov, but that officer in turn was replaced on January 31 by Maj. Gen. Ivan Prokofevich Repin. By February 1, 8th Corps had been withdrawn into reserve, and the division remained in 3rd Shock Army directly under Army command. Later that month it was finally subordinated to 5th Guards Rifle Corps, where it would remain until July.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, pp. 34, 60, 82, 107, 132, 158 During these months the Corps gradually advanced westward in the direction of Novosokolniki, which involved a seesaw battle over several weeks for a German stronghold on the Ptahinski Hill, which finally ended on July 6.http://militera.lib.ru/memo/russian/beloborodov2/09.html. In Russian. Retrieved Nov. 18, 2018. On July 8 General Repin handed command to Col. Konstantin Mikhailovich Vyazemskii, but he was in turn replaced less than a week later by Maj. Gen. Boris Semyonovich Maslov. During August the 5th Guards Corps, now with the 17th and 19th Guards Rifle Divisions, was transferred to the 39th Army, still in Kalinin Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 216 The division would remain in this Corps and this Army for the duration of the war and into the postwar, sharing its combat path with the 17th Guards.Sharp, \\"Red Guards\\", p. 50 Following the liberation of Smolensk in September, Kalinin Front launched an offensive in the direction of Vitebsk. This began with an assault on the German positions at Rudnya, led by the 1st Penal Battalion and a mobile group from 43rd Army and followed by three divisions of 5th Guards Corps. The town was liberated on September 29Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence KS, 2016, pp. 43, 45 and the 19th Guards won its first battle honor: In early November, Army Gen. A. I. Yeryomenko, commander of the recently renamed 1st Baltic Front, ordered the 43rd and 39th Armies to concentrate north of the Smolensk - Vitebsk railroad and highway in order to renew the advance on the latter city, which had slowed significantly over the past weeks. The assault was to open on November 8 against the positions of the German 206th and 14th Infantry Divisions. Although the divisions of the two Soviet armies were worn down to about half strength from earlier fighting, they still held a five-fold advantage in infantry, as well as superiority in armor and artillery. The offensive, in which the 19th Guards had a follow-on role, began as planned and opened a gap on a 10 km front by the next day, and gained as much as 10 km in depth over 10 days of fighting, before the German forces were able to rebuild a continuous front.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 141-42 On December 5, General Maslov handed command of the division over to Col. Feoktist Dannilovich Maiboroda, but this proved temporary as Maslov returned to command on December 28. During these command changes, 39th Army, this time with 5th Guards Corps in the lead, began another joint offensive with 43rd Army on December 19, again striking the defenses of 14th Infantry east of Vitebsk, on the Borok - Goriane sector, backed by nearly 100 tanks. The attack made very limited gains, and 5th Guards Corps was withdrawn and sent south of the Smolensk - Vyasma road on December 21, with the entire offensive shut down two days later. This redeployment was made in order to reinforce a new assault by 33rd Army on this sector, which began on December 23. 19th Guards was deployed immediately south of the Smolensk - Vitebsk railroad, with the immediate objective of the village of Ugliane, although the overall goal of the offensive was to link up with 4th Shock Army and encircle the German forces in Vitebsk. By December 26, 5th Guards Corps had advanced a mere 2‚Äì3 km, leading to a caustic telegram from the STAVKA to the 1st Baltic Front, demanding greater progress. Despite this, 39th Army only managed to gain another 1‚Äì2 km by December 28 before stalling completely, while 33rd Army soldiered on until January 6, 1944.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 231-34, 291-97 The offensive was renewed on January 8. 5th Guards Corps formed 39th Army's shock group on a 6 km-wide between the Smolensk - Vitebsk road and the village of Vaskova, facing the 206th Infantry Division. The division was in the first echelon, with 9th and 91st Guards Rifle Divisions, backed by two tank brigades and the 17th Guards in second echelon. By now these divisions were at less than 40 percent of authorized strength. Although the German forces were similarly weakened, 5th Guards Corps' attack floundered after an advance of only about 1 km. Although 33rd and 5th Armies to the south made greater progress, it was at a heavy cost, and the offensive was finally shut down late in the month.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 320-21, 328-29 General Maslov left command of the division on January 19, and was replaced by Col. Samuil Ilich Tzukarev. Through the rest of January and most of February 5 Guards Corps was in reserve in 39th Army, which had been reassigned to Western Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 40 Near the end of the month it was ordered the Karamidy region astride the familiar Smolensk - Vitebsk road. A new offensive began on February 29, but just prior to its start the German command withdrew several units east of Vitebsk, including the 206th Infantry, back to shorter and more defensible lines. The STAVKA took this as a preliminary to a full withdrawal from the Vitebsk salient, and ordered a pursuit. This soon turned into yet another bloody frontal assault against fixed defenses. 19th Guards was committed on March 5, but by then it was clear that the operation was a failure, after gaining just several hundred metres (apart from the voluntary withdrawals) at heavy cost. This marked the end of major fighting on this sector until summer.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 375-80 The day after, Colonel Tzukarev left command of the division; he was succeeded over the next 12 days by two other colonels, until Col. Pavel Nikonovich Bibikov took command on March 18. This officer would be promoted to major general's rank on April 20, 1945, and would remain in command for the duration of the war. =Operation Bagration= On April 24 Western Front was disbanded, and 39th Army was reassigned to the new 3rd Belorussian Front. In the buildup for the Soviet summer offensive, 5th Guards Rifle Corps was still holding ground east and northeast of the Vitebsk salient, occupied by LIII Army Corps of 3rd Panzer Army, which was now closely enveloped on three sides and exceptionally exposed to encirclement after the fighting of the previous fall and winter. 39th Army was tasked with completing that envelopment from the south, with 5th Guards Corps assigned to a deep penetration action, facing the 197th Infantry Division of VI Army Corps. The Corps was supported by the 28th Guards Tank Brigade, plus the 735th and 957th Self-Propelled Gun Regiments (SU-76s).Sharp, \\"Red Hammers\\", Soviet Self-Propelled Artillery and Lend Lease Armor 1941 - 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. XII, Nafziger, 1998, pp. 47, 51. The 735th would continue to support 39th Army for the duration. The offensive began on the afternoon of June 22, preceded by a 2-hour- and-20-minute combined artillery and air bombardment. After a successful initial advance, the second day began at 0600 hrs. with another hour of artillery preparation against the 197th Infantry, which allowed 5th Guards Corps to crash through its positions and begin advancing quickly to the west and southwest.Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Soviet Blitzkrieg, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2008, pp. 117-18, 121, 123 The Corps soon reached the Luchesa River, being held on a 6 km front by the 197th Division's 347th Infantry Regiment. By 0930 hrs. the river was crossed and a 60-tonne capacity bridge was soon installed, followed by 24-tonne and 9-tonne bridges as well. At this point 19th Guards came out of second echelon, crossed the Luchesa with the 28th Guards Tank Brigade and 735th SU Regiment, and began racing westward against light opposition. By 1300 hrs. all four divisions of 5th Guards Corps were attacking on the front line, and by 10 hours later had advanced up to 10 km from the river. A counterattack by a regiment of 95th Infantry Division, supported by tanks, failed to slow the Soviet advance, and the remainder of the 197th was driven back to join LIII Corps within the salient. At 0600 hrs. on June 24 the 19th and 91st Guards Divisions broke through German VI Corps and continued driving west. 91st Guards reached the Dvina River north of Ostrovno, while the 19th reached the same river at Gnesdilovichi, meeting the advance elements of 43rd Army of 1st Baltic Front, cutting the corridor to Vitebsk, and helping to encircle elements of the 197th Infantry and the 4th Luftwaffe Field Division at Ostrovno. 35,000 German troops were now trapped in Vitebsk.Dunn, Jr., Soviet Blitzkrieg, pp. 104-05, 124-26 During June 25 the division solidified its junction with 43rd Army as the German forces made frantic efforts to reopen the corridor. Hitler insisted that the 19th Guards' old foe, 206th Infantry Division, remain in the city as long as possible. This turned out to be very short indeed, as Vitebsk was cleared during June 26 and 27, while 19th Guards helped mop up the pocket at Ostrovno before marching westwards again.Dunn, Jr., Soviet Blitzkrieg, pp. 127, 129, 131 By July 1 the 39th Army had returned to 1st Baltic Front,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 189 and on July 2 the division was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for its part in the liberation of Vitebsk. Baltic States and East Prussia In the aftermath of Bagration, 1st Baltic Front began a pursuit operation into the Baltic states. By July 19 it had crossed the eastern border of Lithuania near ≈†venƒçionys. Two weeks later, as the rate of advance slowed due to logistics and increasing resistance, 19th Guards was in the vicinity of Jonava, and 39th Army was returned to 3rd Belorussian Front. On August 12 the division was recognized for its role in the liberation of Kaunas with the award of the Order of Suvorov, 2nd Degree. By about August 15, when Army Group Center tried to plug the \\"Baltic Gap\\" in Operation Doppelkopf, the division was on the east bank of the Neman River, at the confluence of the Dubysa River, and remained in this area through September and into October, dealing with the German counter-offensive and bringing up replacements and supplies.The Gamers, Inc., Baltic Gap, Multi-Man Publishing, Inc., Millersville, MD, 2009, pp. 15, 21, 26, 28, 35 In the plan for the Vistula- Oder Offensive, 39th Army was on the right flank of 3rd Belorussian Front, south of the Neman. 5th Guards Rifle Corps was in the first echelon with 94th Rifle Corps, facing a breakthrough sector 8 km wide, with the immediate objective of destroying the enemy forces in the Pilkallen area, before advancing westward and capturing Tilsit by the end of the fifth day. The offensive began on January 12, 1945, and made immediate progress. However, on the 14th the Germans launched heavy counterattacks along the front while the Soviet advance ran into deeply echeloned defenses. 39th Army beat off as many as 15 such attacks by up to a battalion in strength, backed by 8-16 tanks apiece. The 124th Rifle Division, committed from second echelon, broke into Pilkallen and seized the railroad station, the only significant advance of the day.Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, trans. & ed. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2016, pp. 122-23, 192 On January 17, 5th Guards Corps made a powerful attack in the center of its Army's front, broke through the Gumbinnen defense line, and by the end of the day had reached the line Kurschelen - Gross Schorellen - Spullen, having turned its main forces to the northeast. By this time it was clear that 39th Army was making the best progress among the armies of the Front, and the 1st Tank Corps was moved in to exploit. This Corps began its attack the following morning and made immediate progress; 5th Guards Corps advanced as much as 20 km in its wake, captured Rautenburg, forced a crossing of the Inster River, and continued advancing to the northwest. This advance prepared the way for elements of 43rd Army to break into Tilsit in the afternoon of January 19. On January 22, 39th Army overall reached the Curonian Lagoon along the line of the Deime River, splitting the German defense. The defenders made use of prepared positions along this line to put up fierce resistance the following day, and it was not until 1900 hrs. that 5th Guards managed to force the river, gain a foothold on the west bank, and open the way to K√∂nigsberg.Prelude to Berlin, pp. 195-97, 218, 224-26 The right-flank forces of 39th Army continued their pursuit on January 27, reaching the near approaches to the K√∂nigsberg fortress and became involved in stubborn fighting. The Army commander, Lt. Gen. I. I. Liudnikov, wanted to isolate the city from the north as quickly as possible, and assigned his 5th Guards and 113rd Rifle Corps the task pursuing the enemy, reaching the Frisches Haff, and preventing the enemy from withdrawing to the west.Prelude to Berlin, p. 230 In February, 39th Army was assigned to the Zemland Group of Forces in 3rd Belorussian Front,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1945, p. 80 and on February 19 the 19th Guards was awarded the Order of Lenin for its service in the capture of Tapiau, Allenburg, Nordenburg, and other towns in East Prussia. Soviet invasion of Manchuria The division remained in Samland until late April, when it was removed, with its Army, to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. By July 1 it was in Transbaikal Front, and remained there in early August when the Soviet offensive against the Japanese forces in Manchuria began.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1945, pp. 115, 177, 189, 193 In the preparation for the invasion, 39th Army was in the easternmost tip of Mongolia, and was to help lead the Front as the western pincer of a strategic encirclement of the Kwantung Army. The Army had the 61st Tank Division as part of its forward detachment. The offensive was launched on the morning of August 9.Glantz, August Storm: The Soviet 1945 Strategic Offensive in Manchuria, Pickle Partners Publishing, 2014, Kindle ed., ch. 6 The attack began without artillery or air preparation, and no initial resistance was encountered on 39th Army's front. 5th Guards Rifle Corps advanced behind the 206th Tank Brigade south of the Halung-Arshaan and Wuchakou Fortified Regions, defended by two regiments of the Japanese 107th Infantry Division. The forward detachments gained 60 km on this first day, but the rifle divisions were falling behind, so they formed new mobile detachments based on the supporting self-propelled artillery battalions. By this time 39th Army was advancing through the rugged Greater Khingan to cut the rail line at Solun and isolate the fortified regions. It was not until August 12 that 5th Guards Corps met any notable opposition when it ran into elements of the 107th Infantry attempting to withdraw by rail. These were dispersed and the road to Solun was reopened. That town was taken the next day. On August 14 the 19th Guards advanced along the railroad west of Solun against Japanese units retreating from Wuchakou which were also being pressured by 124th Rifle Division moving eastwards. The division remained in this area, guarding communications, until organized resistance ceased after August 18.Glantz, August Storm, Kindle ed., ch. 7 In September the division was awarded its second battle honor, \\"Khingan\\".  Postwar  The division ended the war with the full title of 19th Guards Rifle, Rudnya-Khingan, Order of Lenin, Order of the Red Banner, Order of Suvorov Division (Russian: 19-—è –≥–≤–∞—Ä–¥–µ–π—Å–∫–∞—è —Å—Ç—Ä–µ–ª–∫–æ–≤–∞—è –†—É–¥–Ω–µ–Ω—Å–∫–æ-–•–∏–Ω–≥–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è –æ—Ä–¥–µ–Ω–∞ –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–∞ –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–∑–Ω–∞–º—ë–Ω–Ω–∞—è –æ—Ä–¥–µ–Ω–∞ –°—É–≤–æ—Ä–æ–≤–∞ –¥–∏–≤–∏–∑–∏—è). With the 5th Guards Rifle Corps and the 39th Army, the division remained in China after the end of the war, based at Antung. The division continued to serve with the 39th Army of the Far Eastern Military District at Port Arthur postwar. By 1953 it was directly subordinated to the Army headquarters. It was disbanded in September, 1955, as the Army withdrew from China.
