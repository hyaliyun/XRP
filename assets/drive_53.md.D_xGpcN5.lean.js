Biography Frankfurther was born in the Dahlem district of Berlin to a Jewish family. Her father, Paul, was a businessman while her mother, Henriette, was an economics graduate. Henriette died of cancer 18 months after Eva was born and her father remarried in 1934. The family fled to Britain in 1939 to avoid persecution from the Nazis. The children, Eva and her two siblings, left Berlin six months before their parents and spent some time in Haslemere, being looked after by German refugee teachers, before their parents arrived in England during August 1939. The family rented a flat in Belsize Park Gardens but Frankfurther and her sister were evacuated to Hertfordshire in World War II to avoid the bombing of London. After the War, Frankfurther enrolled in Saint Martin's School of Art. There she studied life drawing under Roland Vivian Pitchforth and was held in great esteem by her fellow students, who included Leon Kossoff and Frank Auerbach. As a student, Frankfurther had spent some summers in America. After graduating in 1951, she visited Italy, where she painted numerous portraits of street beggars and pilgrims, and then, briefly, Paris. Returning to England, Frankfurther took herself away from the central London art scene, and her family home, and moved to the East End of the city. She lived in a basement flat in Whitechapel and took an evening job, working as a counter-hand and dish-washer at the J. Lyons and Co. Corner House restaurant in Piccadilly. This allowed her time to paint during the day. Frankfurther spent five years working at the Corner House and painted several portraits of her fellow workers. Frankfurther also painted portraits of the local East End population. As well as depicting members of the long established Jewish East End community, she also sketched and painted people from the Pakistani, West Indian and Irish communities then arriving in the area. She left the Corner House in 1956 and took a job at the Tate & Lyle sugar refinery at Victoria Dock. Frankfurther left that job in 1957 and lived in Israel for several months. She returned to London in 1959 where, suffering from depression, she took her own life. During her life, Frankfurther only appears to have exhibited locally in the East End, mainly at the Whitechapel Gallery, though she did feature in a group exhibition at the Ben Uri Gallery in 1956. The same gallery included examples of her work in their 2014 Refiguring the 50s exhibition and held a one-person show of her work in 2017.

He holds an earned Doctor of Science from the University of Saskatchewan, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of the Arts (FRSA) in 2014. His contributions to research have been documented in the Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan ‚Äì A Living Legacy. Sharma has made several discoveries in the areas of colorectal cancer and the cardiovascular system. Biography Rajendra Sharma, the son of Venkateswar Sharma and Durga Devi Sharma, was born on January 2, 1942, in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh, India. He spent his childhood in Hathras where he studied primary education at Mohan Gunj Primary Municipality School and higher secondary education at Saraswati Inter College. Sharma completed his B.Sc. in Chemistry, Botany and Zoology in 1963 and M.Sc. in Biochemistry in 1965 from Aligarh Muslim University. He served as a chemistry lecturer at Saraswati Inter College due to the shortage of chemistry teachers during 1965. He was awarded a research fellowship from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) to pursue a Ph.D. degree in Biochemistry at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, where he worked in the area of protein chemistry and enzymology. His Ph.D. research work was published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. After completing his Ph.D., Sharma worked as a lecturer at the Department of Biochemistry, Lady Hardinge Medical College & Hospital, New Delhi. Sharma married Manjul Saraswat in 1970; they have three daughters, Priya, Puja and Poonam. Scientific career Sharma pursued his postdoctoral research in the field of cancer biology in 1972 in the Department of Biochemistry & Pharmacology, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, US. In 1975, he joined the College of Medicine, University of South Alabama, as a research associate in the Department of Biochemistry. In 1976 he joined the Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Manitoba, in Winnipeg to pursue his further research career. Later he moved to the Department of Medical Biochemistry, University of Calgary, Alberta and made several discoveries in the areas of signal transduction. In 1991, Sharma joined as an associate professor at the Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon. In the year 2012, Sharma was awarded the title of a Distinguished Professor at the University of Saskatchewan and he continues to serve at the same position to date. Sharma's research was primarily focused in the areas of calmodulin- regulated systems and myristoylation of cellular proteins. He was the first to report the role of N-myrstoyltransferase in colorectal cancer, which was highlighted in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. His extensive research studies led to the identification of N-myrstoyltransferase as a potential biomarker in colorectal cancer patients. This discovery was licensed for the development of a diagnostic tool to detect colorectal cancer. Sharma's research has resulted in the identification and characterization of several proteins from various species related to colorectal cancer and cardiovascular system that has led to 265 full-length publications in reputed journals to his credit. Sharma has also co-edited a book on signal transduction mechanisms. He is also currently serving as the Editor-In-Chief of a peer-reviewed international scientific journal entitled \\"Journal of Molecular Biology & Therapeutics\\". Recently an article on his decades of dedication to research was published in OCN (ON CAMPUS NEWS) at the University of Saskatchewan. Recognitions *Saskatchewan Order of Merit *Saskatchewan Centennial Medal *Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal (2012) *Fellow of the Royal Society of the Arts (FRSA) (2014) The City of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, named four streets in Aspen Ridge in recognition of Sharma's scholarly contributions to science and research.

Work   Management Department at New York University  The New York University in 1914 introduced its first course in industrial management in a new industrial engineering program. It introduced lesson in Factory Organization and in System and Organization in Commercial Business, about the implications of scientific management for office and service activities. Nelson (1992) summarized. that in 1916 the New York University: :\\"... created a Management department, headed by Lee Galloway, that taught a variety of management courses and a management seminar devoted to controversies over the application of scientific management. No university responded more quickly to the opportunities of the moment. In the following years NYU introduced more specialized courses on industrial and labor management in response to the demands of the swelling student population. Yet courses disappeared as fast as they appeared, faculty turnover was high, and there was no evidence that the swollen curriculum was more than a reaction to the uproar over scientific management and the labor problems of the war period.\\"Nelson, Daniel. \\"Scientific management and the transformation of university business education.\\" in: A Mental Revolution: Scientific Management since Taylor, Columbus, OH: Ohio State University Press 1992 (1992): 77-101. p. 93-94 Galloway in 1921 published his standard work Office Management, Its Principles and Practice,Harry Braverman.

The rebels wanted to regain their former territories in Shandong from Liu Zhennian, the man who had defected from Zhang to the Nationalist government in Nanjing during the Northern Expedition. After some initial successes, the rebels were defeated due to the indiscipline of their forces. In the end, the uprising failed to topple Liu Zhennian's rule over eastern Shandong, but resulted in high civilian casualties and widespread destruction at the hands of both sides in the conflict.  Background  Soldiers under Zhang Zongchang's command in 1924. Though his men respected and feared Zhang, their quality as soldiers suffered from lack of training and weaponry, as well as indiscipline. After the death of Yuan Shikai in 1916, China disintegrated as various military commanders seized power throughout the country. Organized into cliques, they controlled the Beiyang government and constantly fought against each other for supremacy in what came to be known as the Warlord Era. One of the most notorious warlords from this period was Zhang Zongchang, who was the de facto ruler of Shandong at the time and known for his brutality. Although he was hated and feared by the civilian population due to his authoritarian methods, the so-called \\"Dogmeat General\\" commanded a relatively loyal army and managed to keep Shandong under his control for much of the late 1920s; in this he was aided by subordinates such as Chu Yupu and Liu Zhennian. Zhang's rule came to an end, however, when Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist government defeated him during the Northern Expedition in 1928. Like many other warlords, Zhang was not willing to accept his reduced status and exile in Dalian. In order to regain his former power base, he began to plot an uprising with his long-time follower Chu Yupu and another warlord, Huang Feng- chi. Zhang also allegedly tried to enlist the help of the White Russian commanders Grigory Semyonov and General Konstantin Petrovich Nechaev. Historian Philip S. Jowett considered it possible that Nechaev, and a few other Russian mercenaries joined Zhang for his attempted comeback. In his plans to recapture Shandong, Zhang Zongchang had a number of important assets: firstly, tens of thousands of his former soldiers still remained in Shandong. Most of them had not been able to join the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) after Zhang's defeat, and remained unemployed. In a precarious economic situation and mostly still loyal to their old commander, they joined his forces for a second time. These Shandong and Zhili Army ex-soldiers were not necessarily reliable nor combat-effective, however. In the face of the Nationalist forces during the Northern Expedition, Zhang's followers had \\"melted away without putting up much of a fight\\", and were even more lacking in training and weaponry now that they had been demobilized. While Zhang's forces were not in the best shape, they had the advantage of not having to face regular NRA troops in eastern Shandong, as the area was under the control of Zhang's former associate Liu Zhennian, nicknamed \\"The Killer\\". Liu had defected to the Nationalists during the Northern Expedition, and was awarded to rule eastern Shandong like an \\"unreformed warlord\\" without intervention since October 1928. Although de jure part of the NRA, Liu's forces were typical of the average warlord, and suffered from little training in comparison to regular armies. Liu was not particularly loyal to the Nationalist government in Nanjing, and he had no support from the local population which he had terrorized, having driven them into rebellion in some areas. The counties of Laiyang and Zhaoyuan were held by Red Spear Society peasant insurgents by early 1929. Lastly, Zhang possibly had covert financial support from the Empire of Japan, which increased his confidence in recapturing Shandong.  Rebellion   Start of the conflict  Security conditions in eastern Shandong were already deteriorating before the arrival of Zhang, as Liu's garrison at Longkou and Huangxian mutinied in late January 1929. The local commanders, namely Liu Kai-tai, Li Hsi-tung, Sze Tien-pin, and Kao Peng-chi had reportedly planned to overthrow Liu Zhennian, prompting him to dismiss them, whereupon they revolted and renounced their allegiance to the Nanjing government. Their 3,000 forces, consisting of ex-Zhili and Shandong troops went on to completely loot Longkou, Huangxian, and Dengzhou. Foreigners who had lived in these towns fled onto two Japanese warships that harbored at the coast by chance. The violence was only quelled when an additional Imperial Japanese Navy detachment arrived to protect Japanese citizens in the area, soon followed by 20,000 troops loyal to Liu. Instead of resisting, the mutineers fled into areas held by the Red Spear insurgents. Allying themselves with the peasant rebels, the mutineers were reportedly preparing an attack on Longkou by early February. The morale of Liu's remaining forces in the area was extremely low. In course of February, the rebels gained the upper hand and Liu was pushed back to the surroundings of Zhifu, his de facto capital and the most important city of northeastern Shandong. It is likely that the whole mutiny had been organized or at least influenced by Zhang, and when he, Chu and Huang landed with a small retinue at Longkou on 19 February, the mutineers promptly joined them. The warlords then set up their headquarters at Dengzhou, and marched on Zhifu. Fighting started near Fushan, 15 miles west of Zhifu, in late February. By that time, Zhang's army counted 5,000 soldiers, but he was soon reinforced by Huang who managed to gather an army of 26,000 men. Their opponent, Liu, had much fewer NRA soldiers at his disposal and would receive only \\"half-hearted\\" support from the central government during the rebellion: 200,000 rounds of ammunition and 50,000 yuans as war chest. His military position was further impaired by the fact that part of Shandong was occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army that refused to allow NRA reinforcements through. In this way, the Japanese deliberately or unintentionally aided Zhang's uprising.  First battle at Zhifu and stalemate  United States Navy warships off Zhifu in the 1930s. Several foreign warships were stationed at the town during the warlord rebellion to ensure the security of the foreigners active in eastern Shandong. After some skirmishes, Zhang arrived at Zhifu with a large force of about 24,000 troops, while Liu had only been able to muster 7,000 men for the town's defense. The two sides clashed on 21 February, and the rebels were defeated despite their superior numbers, probably because they were badly armed and trained in comparison to the NRA soldiers. Furthermore, Zhang Zongchang, who might have rallied his men, was nowhere to be found during the engagement. The warlord army lost 500 men (200 dead, 300 captured) and, more importantly, 2,000‚Äì3,000 rifles as well as 15 machine guns. Zhang and his allies remained undaunted by this first setback, and retreated to Dengzhou. What followed were weeks of \\"desultory fighting\\" during which government as well as rebel troops terrorized the local population, while the warlord alliance entered negotiations with Liu in hopes of convincing him to surrender. On 25 February, there were reports that Liu's army had suffered from further defections, as 15,000 active troops near Weihaiwai had allegedly declared for Zhang. By the end of the month, Zhang claimed to control all of eastern Shandong with the exception of Zhifu and its surroundings. Around this time, Zhang publicly announced that a coalition of warlords, including himself, Chu Yupu, Yan Xishan, Wu Peifu, Bai Chongxi, Qi Xieyuan, and a number Manchurian military commanders would soon launch a massive campaign against the KMT. No actual alliance was formed, however, and the \\"whole affair died down again, as suddenly as it had started\\". Zhang did however manage to contact one NRA regiment consisting of former Shandong Army members in Beijing, and convinced them to revolt on 2 March 1929. Their uprising in Beijing was quickly crushed, and the Nanjing government consequently took \\"precautions\\" to prevent further ex-Shandong soldiers in the NRA from rebelling. Meanwhile, warlord soldiers razed six towns and 50 villages, partially in retaliation for the murder of a rebel officer and an assassination attempt on Zhang, but also out of frustration about the disappointing course of the rebellion as well as simple greed and vandalism. Captured women and girls were sold as slaves on Huangxian's market for 10‚Äì20 Mexican dollars (the Mexican silver dollar was the main currency used in China at the time). One group of rebels under General Li Hsi Tung marched westward and plundered Laizhou, before returning to the frontlines near Zhifu. In comparison, Liu's forces behaved little better. The Nationalist-aligned warlord ignored any orders from Chiang Kai-shek, and his men posed as \\"protectors\\" at the same time as they robbed and abused the local peasants. Many citizens of Zhifu had so little confidence in the government forces' capabilities to end the rebellion that they fled to Dalian. There was also growing international concern about the security of foreigners in eastern Shandong. As result, several foreign warships, including the , HMS Cornflower, and , had arrived at Zhifu to prevent anti-foreign pogroms that could erupt due to the chaotic situation. This chaos allowed the Red Spear Society which already occupied parts of the hinterland to expand its influence, as many locals turned to the peasant rebels to protect them. Other villages in Shandong formed their own self-defense groups, but these did not necessarily cooperate. In Tung-nan County, at least three irregular armed groups were active at the time of the warlord incursion, namely the small \\"Southern Army\\", the 2,000-men strong force of Wang Tzu-ch'eng, and a White Spear Society branch. Although the latter had been explicitly mobilized to protect locals from Zhang Zongchang's forces, it instead had to defend itself from attacks by the other two bands. After defeating them, the White Spears became rather popular and powerful in Shandong's hinterland. Nevertheless, none of the secret societies could openly challenge the rampaging soldiers, as the peasant militias were too poorly armed.  Height and defeat of the rebels  old republican flag over the city. According to historian Philip S. Jowett, this flag was often used as \\"symbol of the good old days of warlord China\\". In early March, the warlord alliance and Liu agreed to a five-day ceasefire during which the rebels attempted to bribe Liu to defect back to them. They offered him 100,000 yuan, but Liu \\"thought his loyalty was worth at least 500,000 yuan\\". Zhang and his allies did not meet this price, however, and Liu remained on the government side. As no agreement was forthcoming, both Zhang and Liu gathered more troops, and with the truce over, the rebels again marched on Zhifu. They besieged the city, and were soon reinforced by opportunistic bandits and another warlord, Sun Dianying, who brought 7,000 fresh soldiers with him. Eventually, the city's defenders were betrayed by their own comrades: One of Liu's regiments under Colonel Liang defected to the rebels, allowing them to capture the city on 27 March. Nevertheless, the NRA troops managed to retreat in good order and with most of their ammunition eastward. Zhang used his victory and conquest of more territory to impose heavy taxes on the local population. Initially, the warlord forces behaviour was relatively disciplined, but on 6 April \\"they ran amok\\" in Zhifu, starting a six-day long crime spree of killing, looting and raping. Eventually, the officers managed to regain control over their men and put a stop to the \\"worst outrages\\", though at this point the city was largely destroyed. Meanwhile, the Japanese and Chinese governments signed an agreement on 28 March that resulted in the withdrawal of the Japanese military from Shandong. Fearing that Zhang might occupy the areas vacated by the Japanese, however, Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Zhengting requested the Imperial Japanese Army to delay their withdrawal until the Nanjing government was in a position to secure Shandong. Liu and some of his forces had managed to retreat from Zhifu to Muping, where the warlord army again put them under siege. Liu launched a first sally against the besiegers on 1 April, and reportedly managed to kill 2,000 enemy troops. Nevertheless, Zhang prepared to break the town's defenses, namely its medieval but strong walls, through an escalade. To relieve his besieging army, he forcibly conscripted civilians as gravediggers and coolies. As the siege progressed, Liu was eager to surrender, and was supported in this regard by Muping's chamber of commerce which hoped it could avoid the city's destruction through a peaceful solution. Confident of imminent victory, Zhang refused Liu's offer on 4 April. This time, however, the indiscipline and lust for plunder of his troops crippled Zhang's attempt to finally destroy Liu. Losing interest in fighting and preferring to loot the undefended countryside, many warlord soldiers deserted their posts, reducing the strength of Zhang's army. A final attempt to capture Muping was completely defeated on 22 April, and Zhang's army was routed. While Zhang was still surrounded by a number of loyal troops, his situation quickly deteriorated and Liu retook Zhifu in a counter-offensive on 23 April. Thereafter, any remaining unity among the warlords' army had collapsed; the rebels fled into the countryside, where they became little more than a number of \\"disorganised rabbles\\". The leaders of the insurgency simply attempted to escape the wrath of the government troops and civilian population. Chu Yupu (left) with Zhang Zongchang (middle) and the de facto ruler of Manchuria, Zhang Xueliang (right) Zhang reportedly made \\"arrangements\\" with the Chinese government, and fled to Dalian on 23 April. The Japanese authorities of the Kwantung Leased Territory did not allow Zhang to enter Dalian, however, prompting him to travel to Moji-ku in Japan instead. On the other side, Chu Yupu and his remaining 1,000‚Äì4,500 loyal troops fled to the town of Fushan, whose 20,000 inhabitants they took hostage. The following 13-day siege by Nationalist forces was marked by atrocities at the hands of Chu's soldiers. Besides mass rapes and robberies, the defenders also tied 400 women and children to posts on the town walls in order to use them as human shields. Soldiers from both sides who were wounded in front of the city were left to die, as neither side allowed Red Cross workers to bring them to safety. According to some accounts, Liu and Chu eventually allowed women and children to leave the city on the insistence of Christian missionaries. Jowett considered these accounts \\"doubtful\\", however, since \\"such compassion would be out of character\\" for either commander. Following negotiations organized by the United States consul of Zhifu, Chu surrendered Fushan to the NRA. Thereafter, many women and girls committed mass suicide by jumping into the town's wells because they did not want to bear the perceived \\"shame\\" of being a rape victim. Besides the civilian casualties of the siege, around 1,500 NRA soldiers and 2,000 rebels died in combat at Fushan; many surviving warlord soldiers were killed out of revenge after the town's capture. Fushan was also completely looted, first by the rebel forces and then by the NRA. Chu Yupu, however, was spared by the Nationalists and allowed to go into exile in Korea with $400,000 in silver currency and bars. Jowett assumes that he bribed his opponents for safe passage.  Aftermath  With the warlord rebellion defeated, peace only returned temporarily to northeastern Shandong. Soon after the conflict, Liu Zhennian and another Nationalist general/warlord, Jen Ying- chi, fought a brutal two-day war over who had the greater authority in Shandong, which Liu won. As the warlord rebellion had worsened the famine and instability affecting Shandong, it also stimulated the mass emigration of people from Shandong into the safer and more prosperous Manchuria. Meanwhile, the Red Spears' uprising further escalated; by August 1929, the peasant rebels had taken control over much of northern Shandong's hinterland as well as Dengzhou. Having ignored the issue until then, Liu finally moved against the Red Spears in September and brutally crushed the insurgency in two months. Liu remained in power until he was ousted by Han Fuju in course of a bitter war in 1932. Unlike any of the previous warlord rulers of eastern Shandong, Han actually proved to be relatively capable and popular as civilian administrator. Chu Yupu, on the other side, returned to Shandong soon after his exile to Korea, and was murdered. Accounts differ on how he died: According to some accounts, Liu Zhennian had him killed; others report that he was captured by vengeful peasants. These either buried him alive, or buried him up to his chin so that \\"black ants and the searing sun gave him the slow death he deserved\\". The head of the rebellion, Zhang Zongchang, continued to live a few more years in exile. He died in 1932, shot dead by the relative of an officer he had once executed.

It closed in April 2020. History The Home for Incurables was proposed as a non-denominational charitable institution by Julia Farr n√©e Ord (1824‚Äì1914), wife of George Henry Farr (1819‚Äì1904), Anglican priest and headmaster of St. Peter's College. She was concerned at the plight of impoverished patients of the Adelaide Hospital who were discharged as \\"incurable\\" due to the nature of their illness or disability, then had no-one to support them and nowhere to go but the Adelaide Destitute Asylum. Farr, who had previously founded the Home for Orphans, had the support of Dr. William Gosse, who volunteered his services as chairman of a committee to raise funds for the project. An eight- roomed house on a large block of land on Fisher Street Fullarton was purchased for ¬£1,700 and a further ¬£300 expended on refurbishment of the home. In October 1879 ten inmates of the Destitute Asylum, young and old, male and female, were transferred to the Home. It was a condition of entry that the patient was not insane, and that the incurable disease was not contagious, although that stipulation was later occasionally waived for those suffering from tuberculosis. It soon became apparent that the existing facility was too small, and another building with accommodation for 30 was erected on the property and opened in February 1881. An extension capable of housing another 40 patients was added to this building in 1884 and named the Gosse Memorial Wing. Over the ensuing hundred years adjacent land was purchased as it became available, and the old buildings demolished to make way for more modern accommodation. The West Block (Fisher Building), built between 1964 and 1967, was made obsolete by the new East Block, and largely vacated in 1978 (their centenary). The number of resident patients rose from 142 in 1928 to 400 in the 1960s to 826 by the end of 1978, the largest institution of its kind in the southern hemisphere. In 1981 the Home for Incurables was renamed The Julia Farr Centre. The property on which the Fisher Building stood was sold by Disability SA to a developer in 2003. Various development proposals fell through and the building, which had meanwhile become the target for vandals and graffiti artists, was sold to Living Choice and demolished in 2011 to make way for a five-storey retirement complex. Other parts of the property remained, including the East block.

The novel features the Motswana protagonist Precious Ramotswe and is set in Botswana. Mma Ramotswe has two cases on hand, one to verify the identity of a boy as the heir to a large farm and the other to stop the smear campaign against the owner of the Minor Adjustment Beauty Salon, as it has stopped all customers from coming to her shop. Grace Makutsi is pregnant, but does not bring up the fact until late in her pregnancy, nor does she ever bring up the plan for her maternity leave. This gives Mma Ramotswe much to consider while her secretary and assistant is away with the baby. Mr JLB Matekoni contemplates whether he is a modern husband. This novel drew a range of reactions from reviewers. Some viewed it positively, termed it \\"endearing\\", and considered the novel to have its strength in the characters and their love of Africa, rather than the deductions needed to solve the mysteries. By contrast, one reviewer considers this novel to show the reasons for the longevity of the series, with its sweet aspects but not omitting the harsh facts of life; \\"Forgiveness and generosity . . . are the answer to most of life‚Äôs ills\\", concludes Mma Ramotswe. The changes Mma Ramotswe must make in response to the changes life brings her, were the focus for another reviewer. Yet another reviewer focussed on some hilarious scenes in this novel and the close relationship between Mma Ramotswe and her husband. The hardcover novel opened at number 5 on the New York Times Best Sellers in November 2013, and was on the NPR Hardcover Fiction Bestseller list for four weeks at the end of 2013. Plot summary Mr JLB Matekoni and Mma Ramotswe notice that Grace Makutsi is pregnant, and has not mentioned it to her employer. Mma Ramotswe decides she will wait for Grace to speak up. Rather close to the delivery date, she does. Mma Sheba Kutso arrives with a case for the agency. Edgar Molapo, a farmer, died a few months earlier. He left most of his estate, including his farm and cattle, to his nephew, the son of his late brother. Mma Sheba is not convinced that the young man who presents himself is this nephew. She asks them to resolve his identity so that his will can be carried out properly. Grace Makutsi leaves the office early to rest, but finds a cobra under the bed. After the snake is killed, Grace goes into labor about 3 weeks early. Grace delivers a boy, to be called Itumelang Clovis Radiphuti. Phuti's aunt appears, but Phuti stands up for their choice for modern ways of caring for the infant, and she soon leaves. In the town to get a gift for the new baby, Mma Ramotswe sees the new location of the Minor Adjustment Beauty Salon, and speaks with the proprietor, Mma Soleti. The latter has received a bird feather in the mail, meaning someone wishes her ill. She is worried. Mma Ramotswe meets the sister of the late Edgar Molapo at the farm. Mma Sheba said this sister had an early, failed marriage and has no children. The boy Liso takes Mma Ramotswe around the farm and talks with her. Once he refers to his aunt as his mother, and he speaks Setswana like a native, though the lawyer said the boy was born in Swaziland. Mma Ramotswe visits her friend Gwithie, who has also heard Liso say \\"my mother\\" when referring to his aunt, opening a new idea. A visit to read the will on file reveals that the lawyer herself will inherit, if the boy is not the chosen nephew. Mma Ramotswe then visits Mma Silvia Potokwani at the orphan farm, where she learns that a housemother used to work at the Molapo farm. She tells a story that reveals a dark family secret. The brother and his son were both killed in the same accident in Swaziland, so Edgar never met that nephew. Instead, he was presented with Liso, who is the son of his sister. The dark family secret is that the boy is the result of Edgar sleeping one night with his sister, the reason for her pregnancy. Edgar never knew of this result of his mistaken action. Mma Ramotswe promises not to reveal any of these details, as does Mma Potokwani. Mma Ramotswe considers that the boy Liso is the person who came every summer to work on the farm, and is the person Edgar wanted to be his heir. She tells this to the lawyer without revealing the dark family story. At the beauty salon, a smear campaign drives all customers away. The first idea is that Mma Manchwe, owner of the copy shop and prior wife of the husband of Mma Soleti, started it. Mma Manchwe flatly denies this. Mma Ramotswe learns from the real estate agent that Violet Sephoto has a lease ending soon, and might seek a nicer space by driving Mma Soleti out. Then the daughter of Mma Soleti's cousin, in training as a beautician, tells Mma Ramotswe about her conversations with the real estate office, where she learned who had offered bribes to break Mma Soleti's lease. Mma Ramotswe realizes both women need to settle the tensions about the husband. Mma Ramotswe will talk with Mma Manchwe, and suggests that Mma Soleti pay for an advertising brochure designed by her one-time rival. Mr JLB Matekoni hears from two sources about a university class called How to Be a Modern Husband (Level 1), so he attends the first session. It is led by an angry woman who creates an uncomfortable mood for learning. He decides instead to cook a simple meal, to help out at home, first learning that mashed potatoes are mashed after they are cooked. His wife is coping without Mma Makutsi for the days after the baby arrives, but finds her to be irreplaceable, even with her various odd and annoying habits. When Grace begins to come to the office for a few hours a day with the baby, Mma Ramotswe decides that Grace should be her partner in the detective agency.

Reviews This novel received positive reviews, with comments that the story moves more slowly than those prior to it in this series of novels about the No. 1 Ladies‚Äô Detective Agency. Reviewers find the strength and attraction of the novel in the way the author describes Africa and how the main characters are deeply involved in their culture and love the place where they live. One reviewer finds it a most endearing story. Others noticed the humour in the novel, while one saw the novel as having a melancholy tone, yet has all the characteristics that explain the longevity and popularity of this series of novels. Publishers Weekly finds the main appeal of this novel to be the \\"irrepressible characters\\" and the deep love of Africa. The two cases, or story lines, in this novel, are considered to move along ‚Äúas serviceably as Mma Ramotswe‚Äôs doughty white van to propel the story forward‚Äù, but the strength of the novel is in the ‚Äúcharacters, intriguing local lore, and bone-deep love of Africa.‚Äù Kirkus Reviews considers this novel to move more slowly than the prior 13 novels in this series, but does not consider that a drawback when the strength is the wisdom of Mma Ramotswe. It considers there are two and a half new cases for Mma Ramotswe, the half case being the changes brought to her detective agency by the arrival of Mma Makutsi‚Äôs new baby boy. The review sums up this novel by saying ‚ÄúA little slower-moving and more diffuse than many of the 13 preceding volumes in this celebrated series (The Limpopo Academy of Private Detection, 2012, etc.), but it‚Äôs no more than you‚Äôd expect from a heroine whose fleetness has never been as big a draw as her wisdom.‚Äù Yvonne Zipp writes that this novel \\"is a particularly endearing entry in the long-running series, which has lost none of its gentleness or its love for Botswana, of which McCall Smith clearly has fond memories.\\" She notes the efforts of Mr JLB Matekoni to be a modern husband, going so far as to sit in one session of a class at the university, and Mma Ramotswe's musings on the status of her business, not losing money but not making a profit, as showing her wisdom. The author \\"takes his time with the plot, sprinkling in plenty of musings about what makes a good detective and what really constitutes ‚Äúprofit.‚Äù\\" In a thoughtful review, Clea Simon suggests that this novel shows the reason for the \\"longevity\\" of The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series: \\"Forgiveness and generosity, she [Mma Ramotswe] ultimately concludes, are the answer to most of life‚Äôs ills.\\" Though many think of the series as sweet, Simon states that it \\"has always dealt with harsh reality.\\" There is humour and optimism in this novel, and as well some sad details revealed; in this \\"quiet book, Ramotswe reveals an awareness that her foster daughter‚Äôs illness may shorten her life\\". A \\"pervasive melancholy\\", as Mma Ramotswe reviews her long association with her assistant and thinks about her own lost baby and her first painful marriage, is balanced by the description of her \\"practice of ‚ÄúOptimistic Accounting,‚Äù in which blessings are often tallied.\\" Marilyn Stasio highlights the issues faced by Mma Ramotswe when her long time assistant has a baby. Mma Ramotswe solves the two cases on hand on her own. Stasio reflects that Mma Ramotswe is \\"determined to remain as steadfast as a constellation in the night sky\\". But in the end, Mma Ramotswe concludes that she must make \\"momentous concessions\\". Muriel Dobbin found that the author \\"indulges in several delightful plot twists in his latest portrayal of life\\" in the small African nation of Botswana. Dobbin appreciated the focus on the protagonist Mma Ramotswe and her husband, as he tries to be a modern husband, going so far as to take a class with that title, conducted by \\"the most unpleasant woman Mr McCall Smith has ever written about\\". Then he tries to make a meal at home, where \\"In a hilarious scene, Mma Ramotswe has to explain to her perplexed husband that his favorite mashed potatoes must be cooked first.\\" He shifts to sausage and canned beans for his next try. In her cases, Dobbin concluded that Mma Ramotswe \\"remains tolerant even of those of whose behavior she cannot approve.\\" This novel opened at number 5, hardcover fiction, on The New York Times Best Sellers list. Beginning 14 November 2013, this novel was on the NPR Hardcover Fiction Bestseller List for four weeks.

A chronic invalid, she was the victim of unceasing pain, from her early infancy, during the period of her adolescence, and through the duration of her life. Physical anguish was a repetitive theme in Taggart's poems. Early years and education Cynthia Taggart was born in 1801, or ca. 1804, in a cottage about from Newport, Rhode Island. She was the daughter of a soldier, whose property was destroyed during the American Revolution, and who died in old age and poverty at the family home. Though she had few opportunities of learning, she did receive religious training. Taggart's education was very slight, and until sickness deprived her of all other occupation opportunities, about the year 1822, when she was 19 years of age, she appeared never to have thought of literary composition. Career Poems Taggart and a widowed sister, who was also an invalid, lived in their paternal home by the seashore. She enumerated among her greatest sufferings, an inability to sleep. For many years, she was unable to sleep, except when taking anodynes. It was during these long night, when she was in severe pain, that she developed her poetry. Her poems were collected and published in 1834, with an autobiography, describing her hopeless and helpless condition. The poems were published by some friends to avert poverty and dependence from Taggart's life. The work passed through three editions, two in 1834 and one in 1848. Personal life Rev. James C.

Ladislaus Vidman, second edition: Praha: Academia, 1982), pp. 45f, 94f Celer is primarily known from inscriptions. The origins of Maecius Celer have attracted some discussion. The fact that the final elements of our man's name are shared with the consul of 101, Marcus Maecius Celer, have led some expertsDer Neue Pauly, Stuttgardiae 1999, T. 7, c. 636. to suggest the two men are brothers and our Maecius Celer had been adopted by a Roscius. However Olli Salomies endorses Ronald Syme's hypothesis that his filiation M.f. refers to a Marcus Roscius, namely Marcus Roscius Coelius, consul in 81, who married an aunt of the consul of 101, and this was the source of the last two name elements; instead of brothers, the two Maecii Celeres are cousins.Salomies, Adoptive and polyonymous nomenclature in the Roman Empire, (Helsinki: Societas Scientiarum Fennica, 1992), p. 134 Celer's cursus honorum is partially known from an inscription set up at Tibur by his friend, Gaius Vecilius Probus; = ILS 1025 Anthony Birley notes that \\"Vecilius Probus gave only a selection of posts on the Tibur inscription. Otherwise, it would certainly be curious that he held a relatively early consulship, with no appointments in the imperial service to his credit.\\"Birley, The Fasti of Roman Britain (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981), p. 270 According to Probus, Celer's career began as one of the decemviri stlitibus iudicandis, one of the four boards of the vigintiviri, a preliminary and required first step toward gaining entry into the Roman Senate. Celer was then military tribune in Legio IX Hispana, which was stationed in Roman Britain. During Domitian's Chattan War of 83, two vexillations were sent from Legio IX to Germany, one under Celer, the other under Velius Rufus. For Celer's efforts in the conflict, he was awarded Dona militaria appropriate for his rank.Valerie A. Maxfield, The Dona Militaria of the Roman Army (Durham theses, Durham University, 1972), Part 2, p. 39 He was admitted to the Senate when he became quaestor for an unnamed emperor, possibly Domitian; this was followed by the traditional republican magistracies of plebeian tribune and praetor. Syme argues the date of his praetorship fell in the years 90 to 94, making him a contemporary of Tacitus.Syme, Tacitus, p. 666 Celer's consulate followed.

She developed networks with international feminist organizations and actively sought an increased role for women in society and eventually women's suffrage. Soon after women attained the vote, she lost her vision and retired from public activity, though she published two books after going blind. She is remembered as a pioneering feminist and has been recognized by a street and meeting hall which bear her name. Early life Petronila Ang√©lica G√≥mez was born on 31 January 1883 in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic to Raimunda (n√©e Brea) and Eustaquio G√≥mez. She had one brother, Tom√°s, and was raised in impoverished conditions in her black Dominican family. She attended the elementary school run by Do√±a Teresa Rodr√≠guez and the Normal School of Santo Domingo, before moving to San Pedro de Macor√≠s in 1908, to direct the Escuela Mixta (Coeducational School) there. San Pedro de Macor√≠s was the center of the sugar industry on the island, as well as the focal point for liberal intellectualism. She continued her education while teaching graduating with an instructor's certificate in 1911 and a teaching certification in 1915. The year after G√≥mez earned her teaching degree, the United States invaded the Dominican Republic. The occupation, which lasted until 1924, and G√≥mez's opposition to it, was the stimulus which caused the emergence of the feminist movement in the Dominican Republic. Career In 1919, G√≥mez left the Escuela Mixta, having purchased the Amiama G√≥mez Kindergarten, which had previously been operated by Mercedes Amiama G√≥mez and her daughters Aurora and Josefa. She would serve as administrator of the school through the 1930s, while simultaneously teaching at the Night School for Domestic Workers and Laborers. In 1920, G√≥mez joined the Dominican National Union (es) upon its founding to protest the U.S. intervention in the country and campaign for the troops to leave immediately. Laws were implemented to impose censorship and limit free expression of intellectuals and opposition, leading to the arrest in 1921 of Fabio Fiallo and , among others. Believing that women were essential for the moral regeneration of the country, she saw the fight for Dominican sovereignty as one which required women to actively work to rebuild the society. To that end, on 15 July 1922 she founded the first feminist journal of the country. F√©mina was a magazine written by and for women, to exchange their ideas and discuss the needs and problems they faced. G√≥mez served as the administrator and editor-in-chief of the journal, with Laura Herrera de Geraldino and Consuelo Montalvo de Fr√≠as collaborating on articles. Initially, the magazine appeared bi-weekly and carried patriotic and nationalist themes. In April 1923, at the invitation of Elena Arizmendi Mejia, founder of the International League of Iberian and Latin American Women, G√≥mez founded the first feminist organization in the Dominican Republic, the Central Dominican Feminist Committee (), as a branch of the international organization. The purpose of the organization, like that of the magazine, was to spurn the vision of American feminists and suffragists, promoting a Pan-Hispanic feminism that addressed the values that were important to Latina feminists. Uniting female and male intellectuals, race became the unifying factor, to propel women forward as moral compasses guiding the home and nation. The organization excluded those who were uneducated, though simultaneously pressed for better educational opportunities for women, seeing education as a means to make women better mothers and more able to propel the country in a moral direction. In 1931 Dominican Feminist Action () was founded by members of the social club Nosotras and within two years, became the dominant feminist organization, forcing CCFD to dissolve. By 1925, F√©mina‚Ä≤s editorial staff had expanded to include Mignon Coiscou de Gonz√°lez, Isabel Pellerano, Carmen G. de Peynado, Beatriz Lucila Sim√≥, and Delia Weber, as well as correspondents like Ana Jim√©nez, Abigail Mejia, Ana Teresa Paradas, Evangelina Rodr√≠guez. Though directing the magazine, G√≥mez also wrote articles, sometimes using the pseudonym Bisfalia. In 1927, F√©mina became a monthly journal, but for a brief period between 1929 and 1930, the format went back to bi-monthly, when finances due to the Great Depression were scarce. After the Americans departed from the country, the journal focused more on building international connections of women throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. She devoted space to publishing ideas of other feminists and wrote many articles on the Pan-American conferences, as well as the Inter-American Commission of Women and its leadership. With the election of Rafael Trujillo as President of the Dominican Republic influences in women's groups shifted to those who supported his regime and by 1932, G√≥mez was the sole editor of F√©mina. Whereas she saw In 1934, she moved back to Santo Domingo and articles after that time focused much more on social issues like charitable works, education, home economics, law and women's medical issues. G√≥mez married the writer Jos√© Altagracia Salda√±a Suazo on 4 February 1939 and though she published a few articles as Petronila Ang√©lica G√≥mez de Salda√±a, F√©mina stopped publication that year. An increasing bent toward anti-Haitianism and Negrophobia had begun to push the country toward an institutionally ingrained favoritism for white and Hispanic identity. Though women gained suffrage in 1942 in the Dominican Republic and G√≥mez voted in the election, soon thereafter she withdrew from political activity. By 1948, she had become completely blind, but wrote and published two books, Influencia de la mujer en Iberoam√©rica (Influence of women in Latin America, 1948) and Contribuci√≥n a la historia del feminismo dominicano (Contribution to the History of Dominican Feminism, 1952), before withdrawing from public life. Death and legacy G√≥mez spent her final years in an assisted living facility, Geriatric Home San Francisco de As√≠s, in Santo Domingo, where she died in obscurity on 1 September 1971. In 1977, a proposal to honor her memory with a street named after her was defeated. In 1990, the writer and historian, Julio Jaime Julia, profiled her in his book Haz de luces, which highlighted the contributions of outstanding Dominican women. Though the General Archive of the Nation contain almost a complete collection of F√©mina, little recognition of her contributions were recognized in the country until 2003, when in recognition of International Women's Day, the name of Calle 25 Oeste was changed to bear her name, as was the meeting hall in the Women's Ministry headquarters. International scholars have restored her place as one of the formative group of feminists in the Dominican Republic and highlighted her founding role in the feminist movement of the country.

The rotation period of the star cannot be determined as in 2020, and can be either around 15 or 30 days, depending on interpretation of available data. Planetary system It has 3 transiting planets seen by the Kepler space observatory in their K2 survey. As of October 2017, it is the closest star discovered to have transiting exoplanets found by either the Kepler or K2 missions. The planets (b, c, d) have radii of 1.62, 1.27, and 2.09 times that of the Earth, and periods of 1.209, 3.648, and 6.201 days (ratios 1:3:5). Because of its close distance the system is considered an excellent target for studying atmospherics of exoplanets. In late 2017, the masses of all three planets were determined using the Planet Finder Spectrograph on the Magellan II Telescope. Planet b was found to be very iron- rich, planet c appears to be mainly rocky, and planet d is a typical volatile- rich planet. GJ 9827b is noted as being one of the densest planets yet found, with its mass containing about ‚â•50% iron. More precise radial velocity measurements released in late February 2018 revealed that all three planets have a lower density than Earth and have some amount of volatiles in their compositions. GJ 9827b and c are mainly rocky (containing less than 1% mass fraction of water, and negligible helium and hydrogen) with very thin volatile envelopes, while GJ 9827d is more akin to a Mini-Neptune. The loss of primordial atmosphere was indirectly confirmed in 2020 as no helium was detected at Gliese 9827 d though. With a mass of about 1.5 , GJ 9827c is one of the least massive planets detected with radial velocity.

The monastery was founded by Saint Francis of Assisi in AD 1221‚Äì1222. History According to tradition, the monastery was founded by Saint Francis of Assisi in the winter of AD 1221‚Äì1222. When the saint and a fellow friar tried to enter Montella, on route as pilgrims to the Sanctuary of St Michael Archangel at Mount Gargano, they was not permitted to do so because of fears of leprosy. They walked a short distance to the Folloni forest and slept under a tree. They were miraculously shielded from snow and the friary was then founded on that spot. A church and an extensive complex were built there after the founding of the friary. In AD 1732, the friary was demolished by an earthquake. It was rebuilt later in the century and virtually none of the old friary structures remained above-ground. Archaeologists excavated the cloister walk of the friary in 2007-2008 and 2010. The remains of several hundred people interred there were recovered and studied. Most of the people were from Montella but one was not from the area. His radiocarbon date range is AD 1050‚Äì1249. The scientists suggest he may have been one of the saint's fellow travelers who founded the friary in the 13th century. Presently the site also contains a museum. The church was erected in the 18th century, with a single nave and lateral chapels. The interior decoration is rich in stucco. In the main Chapel of the Crucifix is the Bread Sack of St Francis. The church also has the cenotaph of Diego I Cavaniglia, Count of Montella, killed in September 1481 during the siege of Otranto for the liberation of the town conquered by the Ottomans in 1480. It was erected by his widow Margherita Orsini.Polo Museale Campania. Bread Sack of Saint Francis of Assisi According to tradition, a sack of bread sent by Saint Francis of Assisi appeared on the doorstep of the friary in the winter of 1224. However, the saint was in France at the time and it was believed that an angel delivered the bread so this event was considered a miracle. The sack was later used as an alter cloth and then was preserved as a relic in the friary. Scientists analyzed part of the sack and determined its radiocarbon date range was AD 1220‚Äì1295. They also revealed the presence of ergosterol, a biomarker for the past presence of bread.

He helped to organize a petition, circulated by the workers of the Belgrade engineering enterprise Minela, demanding the replacement and punishment of one of the directors, Radoje Stefanoviƒá, for misappropriation and theft. An investigation was started but soon dropped, the signatories being informed that Stefanoviƒá had been appointed to head the executive of the Belgrade City Council. Radoviƒá was sacked. He then found a job at Hidrotehnika, where he was also involved in a workers' petition against Mikaina Saviƒá, a judge in the Court of Associated Labor. The petition led nowhere and the city's new top executive moved in to protect her. In November 1982.

He requested that the trade union be free from government control and a free association of workers, the right to strike, and punishment for those governing structures and individuals who contributed to the crisis. He requested that all government business be subject to control by the public. He advocated for the freedom of the press and a public dialog on all burning issues.

The visit, planned as part of the United States Bicentennial celebrations and one of several from foreign heads of states, marked a warming in Swedish‚ÄìAmerican relations after the Vietnam War. The 27-day tour lasted from April 2 to April 30, and included a formal reception by President Gerald Ford at the White House, as well as visits to Swedish American communities and other sites in 12 states. Background and planning King Carl XVI Gustaf ascended the throne in 1973, succeeding his grandfather Gustaf VI Adolf at the age of 27. During Gustaf's reign, anti-war protests in Sweden had led to the recalling of the U.S. Ambassador in 1968 and the freezing of relations in 1972. Gustaf VI Adolf himself was critical of the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, calling for an end to the \\"merciless bombing\\" of Hanoi as part of Operation Linebacker II. Gustaf VI Adolf had visited the United States in 1926 and 1938 as Crown Prince, but no reigning Swedish monarch had traveled to the United States. The upcoming U.S. Bicentennial celebration in 1976, commemorating the 200th anniversary of the nation's declaration of independence, was seen as an opportunity to invite the young king for a symbolic visit and repair relations between the two countries. Prime Minister Olof Palme, who was central to Sweden's hostilities with the United States during the Vietnam War, visited Moscow instead to promote Sweden's neutral stance during the ongoing Cold War. Minnesota Governor Wendell R. Anderson, an American of Swedish descent, traveled to Stockholm in July to meet the king and present a formal invitation on behalf of several Swedish American associations.

The King arrived in Washington, D.C. on April 4, touring the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and National Air and Space Museum. He was received by President Gerald Ford at the White House on April 5, engaging in a conversation in the Oval Office with Secretary of State Henry Kissinger that morning. He spent the evening at a dinner at the residence of Ambassador Wachtmeister, inviting Kissinger, Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, Chief Justice Warren Burger, and Senators of Swedish descent. The King departed Washington for Philadelphia on April 6, where he toured the American Swedish Historical Museum, whose cornerstone was laid in a 1938 by then-Crown Prince Gustaf VI Adolf. In Philadelphia, he also toured the Liberty Bell with Mayor Frank Rizzo and Tinicum Island in the Delaware River. On April 8, the King visited the community of Swedesboro, New Jersey, accompanied by New Jersey Governor Brendan Byrne, and was received by 2,000 of its residents. The visits to Tinicum and Swedesboro were part of a commemoration of the founding of New Sweden in the 17th century by Swedish immigrants. Minnesota and Seattle: April 8‚Äì11 The King arrived in Minneapolis on April 8, visiting Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, meeting with Governor Anderson, and speaking to a crowd of 8,500 at the Minneapolis Auditorium the following day. The King flew to Seattle, Washington, on April 10, arriving to a crowd of 300 onlookers at Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport. The following day, he dedicated the Ballard Avenue Historic District in the city's Scandinavian enclave, Ballard, with Mayor Wes Uhlman, and addressed the Swedish Club of Ballard. The King opened a photography exhibit of the Swedish Americans in the Puget Sound region at the University of Washington, where he visited the university's Scandinavian department. He embarked on a helicopter tour of Weyerhaeuser's timber and forestry operations in the region, including a tour of the company's headquarters in Federal Way. At an evening banquet, the King decorated five Seattleites of Swedish descent with the Order of the Polar Star, and was received by Governor of Washington Daniel J. Evans. California, Colorado, and Kansas: April 13‚Äì17 The King arrived in San Francisco on April 13, touring the University of California at Berkeley campus and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The royal entourage had planned to ride on Bay Area Rapid Transit and the city's cable car system, but potential picketing from workers on strike forced the plan to be shelved. He traveled to Los Angeles the following day and toured The Burbank Studios and a McDonnell Douglas factory to observe the construction of a Scandinavian Airlines DC-10 jet. The King was received by 200 Hollywood personalities at a lunch hosted by Edgar Bergen, a Swedish American comedian. The King flew to Aspen, Colorado for two days of recreation at the Vail Ski Resort, a favorite of President Ford's, on April 15. He skied for several hours, accompanied by Secret Service agents, while wearing a ski outfit in the colors of the Swedish flag. The King made a visit to Lindsborg, Kansas on April 17, arriving two hours late due to inclement weather, and was greeted by a crowd of 5,000 people (which outnumbered the town's population of 2,600) and Kansas Governor Robert Frederick Bennett. The town, a Swedish American community with annual Swedish festivals, received the King at the preserved Swedish pavilion from the 1904 World's Fair, as part of a town-wide celebration. The royal motorcade had moved quickly through the town, due to the delayed arrival, causing onlookers to react in disappointment over the brevity of the visit. Illinois: April 18‚Äì22 The King attended an Easter service at Chicago's Ebenezer Lutheran Church on April 18, located in the city's Swedish enclave, with Illinois Governor Dan Walker; at the time, he was recovering from a sore throat. Later in the day, he visited the offices of Chicago-based Swedish newspaper Svenska Amerikanaren Tribunen (sv) and dedicated the new Swedish American Museum in Andersonville.

His most successful play was El arlequ√≠n (1902), which was performed throughout the Spanish-speaking world. His novel Lauracha (1911) ran through several editions and was made into a film. Life Otto Miguel Cione was born in Asunci√≥n, Paraguay on 15 August 1875. His parents were Italian. His father was Pascual M. Cione and his mother was Angela Flacone. He moved to Uruguay at an early age, and became a citizen of that country. His father was a leading doctor, and insisted that he attend university, but he did not finish his studies. For some time he was Consul of Uruguay in Concordia, Entre R√≠os, Argentina. Later he was Section Head of the National Labor Office, and then Librarian in the Secondary Education Section of the Universidad de Montevideo. In 1942 he was Librarian of the \\"Alfredo V√°zquez Acevedo\\" Institute, the University's Section of Secondary and Higher Education. Work Cione began his career as a journalist with contributions to the Revista Nacional of Literature and Social Sciences, directed by Jos√© Enrique Rod√≥, Victor P√©rez Petit and the Mart√≠nez Vigil brothers. Cione contributed to the main newspapers and magazines of the R√≠o de la Plata, particularly the Sunday supplement of La Ma√±ana, Montevideo. He published weekly articles in La Ma√±ana in Montevideo under the pseudonym \\"Mart√≠n Flores\\". His short story La atrevida operaci√≥n del Dr. Otis, published in the humorous magazine Caras y Caretas in 1901, describes a partial brain transplant where the blood of the evil recipient rejects the lobe of a good person's brain. He also wrote as a theatrical critic for the Argentine journals El Pais, El Diario, Critica, Ultima Hora, La Argentina and Idea Nacional and for the Montevideo journals Diario del Plata and El Censor. Cione was the author of many successful theatrical plays. Most of his work was produced in Argentina. He was one of several Uruguayan authors who flourished in Buenos Aires during the period of realism in rioplatense theater at the turn of the 20th century, others being Ismael Cortinas (1884‚Äì1940), Edmundo Bianchi (1880‚Äì1965) and Orosm√°n Moratorio (1883‚Äì1929). The most famous interpreter of his works was the actor Pablo Podest√°. Cione's play El gringo (1904) was inspired by the play La gringa (1902) by Florencio S√°nchez. El gringo tells of an artistocratic woman whose family has lost its money. She marries a rich gringo who was once a poor immigrant. They prove to have nothing in common, the marriage breaks down and eventually the gringo kills himself. His tragedy El Arlequ√≠n (1908) was performed in all the theaters of South America and in theaters in Mexico, Costa Rica, Spain and Italy. L'Arlequin, a tragedy in three acts concerning hereditary alcoholism, was inspired by Henrik Ibsen's Ghosts. Cione won first prize out of 47 entries in the Dramatic Works competition of the National Theater in Buenos Aires with his Presente Griego (1913). Cione has been described as a vigorous humorist in the tradition of Jonathan Swift and Mark Twain, and one of the basic supports of South American literature. He wrote several novels. He won second prize out of 110 entries with his Maula (1902) in the \\"El Pais\\" novel contest in Buenos Aires. Cione's novel Lauracha was applauded by South American and Spanish critics and is considered one of the most important American novels of its genre. The 4th edition, published in Spain, ran to 60,000 copies. Lauracha was adapted for the screen by Hugo Mac Dougall. The 1946 Argentine drama film Lauracha was directed by Arturo Garc√≠a Buhr and starring Amelia Bence.

Although the conflict ended with a negotiation of favorable terms with the rebels, it also demonstrated the deterioration of the Byzantine army. Its inability to defeat the rebels foreshadowed the future losses against the Seljuk Turks in the east and the Normans in the west.  Background  In early 1049, the Byzantine emperor Constantine IX Monomachos decided to transfer 15,000 Pecheneg warriors from their positions in the Balkans to the eastern front. Upon approaching the Bosporus, however, they decided to turn back, and slowly marched through Bulgaria until they reached the Byzantine city of Serdica. They were soon joined by the followers of the Pecheneg warlord Tyrach, who was imprisoned in Constantinople, and the former Pecheneg tribal leader Kegen, and raised the banner of revolt.  Revolt  The Pecheneg army soon began to plunder the area around Adrianople. The local doux (military commander) engaged the Pechenegs in battle, but was soundly defeated. Soon, Constantine decided to release Tyrach from prison on the condition that he pacify his followers. Predictably, he joined them instead. Constantine soon brought his eastern armies to the west, but they, under the command of Kekaumenos and Herv√© Frankopoulos, were soundly defeated. At this point the Pechenegs were able to raid across Macedonia and Thrace with impunity. In June 1050, another Byzantine army under Samuel Bourtzes was destroyed by the Pechenegs. In this battle, the general David Arianites was killed and a veteran commander from Italy, Michael Dokeianos, was taken prisoner and also soon killed. At this point Constantine realized he had to change tactics in order to defeat the Pechenegs. He organized the formation of multiple counter-guerrilla units, largely made up of Varangians, Franks, and other Westerners, in order to counter the Pechenegs with their own tactics. For three years the guerrillas fought against the Pechenegs until, in 1053, Constantine was able to organize another regular army. This army, under the command of the doux of Bulgaria, Basil Apokapes, was also annihilated at Preslav. At this point, the Pechenegs were tired of war and attempted to make peace with Constantine. A peace treaty was signed, which lasted for thirty years. The Pechenegs were forced to cede all of their conquests to the Byzantines, likely in exchange for some form of autonomy.

It was funded through a Kickstarter campaign and self-released directly to the campaign's backers.  Production  The band launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise $30,000 in order to fund the album.

The songs selected by this method were \\"Dance Pattern\\", \\"I Invented the Night\\" and \\"Randy's Hot Tonight\\". As additional stretch goals, funds were secured to produce music videos for songs from the band's previous album, Fresh Blood for Tired Vampyres.

He and his younger brother hid for several years in different villages in Europe and survived. Weinberg built an amazing life full of meaning and art. For the last 30 years he has been intensively involved in the project of imparting the lessons of the Holocaust to Yad LaYeled, which includes personal testimony and the establishment of commemorative corners, created from his wall hangings, in memory of the 1.5 million children who perished in the Holocaust. To date, 42 memorial centers have been set up throughout the country, including 329 hand- woven tapestries, hand-woven in his home, with the assistance of his vision, the theme of which is the anti-thesis of the Holocaust and symbolizes the victory of the spirit over Nazi Germany. As this is written, Weinberg is aware that he belongs to the waning generation of Holocaust survivors, and must tell what happened, despite all the emotional difficulties. The feedback he receives from all the audiences that he meets with gives him the strength to continue this holy work. For 25 years he has accompanied the trips to Poland as a witness, bringing the youth to the scene of the devastation of his family in Belzec Death Camp. There is another reference on Belzec Death camp in this link: He felt there is a great thirst among the youth, to hear first-hand the story of survival, from that terrible time. Only a small handful of survivors, who decided to dedicate their lives, were left to convey the terrible story of the past to the younger generation. In 2006, Yad Vashem published his book Three Mothers for Two Brothers, which tells of his survival and his brothers during the war. Channel 8 also produced a film called \\"Day Care in Hell\\" that focuses on their survival at Bergen-Belsen in Germany. In 2011, he produced the film \\"Here I Learned to Love\\", based on his book, describing his and his brothers' survival in Poland, Hungary, Germany and Switzerland, which was shown on Channel 2 on the eve of Holocaust Remembrance Day in 2012. Since then, The film has been translated into 5 languages and is screened in all communities around the world. There is a reference to this movie in a NY Times article. From 2011 until today, he continues to do a great job of researching the extermination camp at Belzec, where the ashes of his entire family are buried, including archaeological excavations at the site. He had just finished a film he'd been working on for several years. A special film about Belzec. Called \\"Polish Tune\\" (English and Hebrew versions). For the first time he exposed the method of industrial murder in the gas chambers that was carried out in all three camps of Operation Reinhard ‚Äì Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka. Millions of victims were murdered in the factories of moving tape. His entire nuclear family was father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, great- grandmother, and my entire family, 60 people, were all murdered in one day in the camp. He created the 11-minute film so they could easily watch it. The film will serve as a weapon, in the war to deny the Holocaust, and against anti-Semitism. The picture of the six Jewish musicians at the entrance to the gas chambers, the two geraniums on the sides of the stairs, and the copper Star of David above the entrance will be accompanied by all his life. There is another reference on Izhak Weinberg life and accomplishments in this link  Life  Izhak Weinberg was born in 1938 in Krakow, Poland to Jewish family. His parents names were Mordechai and Minda Weinberg. In 1941 the family was deported to the Krakow ghetto. In June 1942, there was a large aktion in the ghetto, and the entire family of 60 people was sent to the extermination camp in Belzec. At the same day the whole family was killed in the gas chambers of the camp. Weinberg and his brother Avner were smuggled out of the ghetto by his aunt, Avin's sister Malka, and his uncle Yitzhak to Shatil's house, and for two years they were hidden among the local gentiles. In February 1944, they were smuggled through Czechoslovakia to Hungary, but only one month later, in March 1944, Nazi Germany entered Budapest and the demonic dance began again. In June 1944, the aunt who smuggled them to Hungary brought the brothers as hidden passengers to the Kasztner train, assuming that this was a rescue train intended to reach Palestine. Due to short negotiations between Kasztner and Eichmann, the rescue train was transferred to Germany and all its passengers 1684 + the two hidden children, ended in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. As their language was Polish, while the other passengers were Hungarian-speaking, they found themselves again in the heart of hell alone, without any relatives. Weinberg was five and a half years old then, left to care for his younger brother. A 20 year old young woman adopted them in camp for 180 days. Their native language was changed from Polish to Hungarian. In December 1944, the rest of the surviving group was released and transferred under the agreement between Kasztner and Eichmann to Switzerland. In Switzerland, they are slowly recovering and gradually returning to normal life, but now Naomi, the girl who adopted them and became a loving and devoted mother in the camp, committed suicide. In September 1945, they were transferred to the port of Bari in Italy and from there sailed on the illegal immigrant ship \\"Will Duran\\" to Palestine. As soon as they arrived in Palestine, they were transferred by the British to the Atlit detention camp. They stayed in the camp for several weeks. On October 11, 1944, The day after the night of the break-in to Atlit, they are transferred to Agudat Israel's Sanhedria institution in Jerusalem, and study in the \\"cheder\\" Torah and mitzvot. Here the Hungarian language is replaced by Yiddish. After a few months, as a result of a lack of accommodation, they are smuggled from there and transferred to the Tehiya Bnei Akiva youth center in Petah Tikva for three years. Here, for the fourth time, their language of Yiddish is changed to Hebrew and studied at the Netzach Yisrael boys' school. In 1949, the Youth Aliyah closed the Tehiya institution and all the children were transferred to Raanana's Kfar Batya youth village. Where he was educated until 1955. In that school he studied with Yaffa Eliach who later married the principal of the school. From there he begins his studies at the Air Force Technical School and continues to serve as a career soldier until 1964, during which he completes his matriculation exams. Since he did not have a close family, the Air Force base served as his home and in all the breaks, Sabbath and holidays he stayed in the camp. So there was no concern for the lone soldier who had no family, and each one dealt alone with his fate. But precisely because of this he invested all his energy and time in intensive work and professional advancement, and is rewarded with a rapid rise in the professional ranks, which brings him great satisfaction in the military services. Weinberg always viewed his service in the air force as the most beautiful and fertile period in his life, as the place where the School of Life served. There he also found his partner Ilana. In 1960. he married Ilana and established a family with her. He had two daughters. Zohar was born in 1967 and served as an infantry instructor, today a doctor in biology. Hila was born in 1969 and served in the Armored Corps in the Golan Heights. And today a teacher at Ma'alot High School. Both are married and have three granddaughters and three grandchildren. Between the years 1964‚Äì1977 he worked as an independent in the automotive spare parts industry. Since 1977, he studied art for three years at the University of Haifa and for two more years in the Ein Hod artists village, specializing in weaving wool-wall carpets. In 1981, he was accepted as a member of the National Painters and Sculptors Association and continues to study for another year with teacher Shmuel Bonneh. In 1987, the \\"Lapid\\" movement, led by Aryeh Barnea, initiated a conference of Kasztner train survivors. After a 45-year-old elm, he tells the story of his survival in its entirety, including the escape from the Krakow ghetto, the Kasztner train, Bergen-Belsen, Switzerland, Italy, Atlit, . Recently Izhak Weinberg started taking Harmonica lessons with Ami Luz from Harmonica Breeze and produced a video that reflects the soul of a Jewish boy who survived the Holocaust and brings a universal message to the world from the Jewish people. The song is based on the Pslams.

She was the first native woman poet whose writings commanded the applause of judicious critics; the first whose poems evinced any real inspiration, or rose from the merely mechanical into the domain of art. Nicholas Biddle said that a prize ode which Townsend wrote for The Port Folio while he was editor of it was in his opinion the finest poem of its kind which at that time had been written in the United States. Many of her other pieces received the best approval of the period, but, as she kept her authorship a secret, it did not enhance her personal reputation. In much of her work, there was a religious and poetical dignity, with all the evidences of a fine and richly-cultivated understanding, which entitled her to be ranked among the distinguished literary women who were her contemporaries. Early years and education Eliza Townsend was born in Boston, Massachusetts, June 1788. Her youth was passed in the troubled times which succeeded the American Revolution. She descended from a stock that for two centuries has occupied a distinguished and honorable position in American society. Career Townsend sympathized with the feelings which were popular in New England, in regard both to U.S. and to foreign affairs, as was shown by her \\"Occasional Ode\\", written in June, 1809, in which Napoleon was denounced with vehemence and power. This poem was first printed in the seventh volume of the Monthly Anthology, and though it bore the marks of hasty composition, in some minute defects, it was altogether a fine piece. She was a contributor of poems to the Monthly Anthology, the Unitarian Miscellany, and The Port Folio, during the publication of those magazines, and to other periodicals. Her productions were anonymous, and the secret of their authorship was for some time preserved. Among the pieces which she published about this time was \\"Another Castle in the Air\\"; \\"Stanzas commemorative of Charles Brockden Brown\\"; \\"Lines on the Burning of the Richmond Theatre\\"; and a poem to Robert Southey, upon the appearance of his \\"Curse of Kehama\\". At a later period, she published several poems of a more religious nature. These were elevated in tone, and were written in an animated and harmonious style. They were not numerous, and all were of moderate length. Of these, she was best known by \\"The Incomprehensibility of God\\". Of this, the Rev. Dr. George Barrell Cheever remarked, that \\"it is equal in grandeur to the Thanalopsis of Bryant,\\" and that \\"it will not suffer by comparison with the most sublime pieces of Wordsworth or of Coleridge.\\" Others included \\"An Occasional Ode\\", written in June, 1809, and published at the time in the Monthly Authology, in which she commented with severity on the career of Napoleon, then at the summit of his career; as well as \\"Lines to Robert Southey\\", written in 1812, and \\"The Rainbow\\", published in the General Repository and Review. Personal life In later life, Townsend did not write for the public in many years. She lived in a secluded manner with her sister, also unmarried, in the old family mansion in Boston. She died at her residence in Boston, January 12, 1854.

She serves as Senegal's Director of the National Center for Assistance and Training of Women under the Ministry of Women and Children. She is an advocate against female genital mutilation (FGM), which she speaks on in her 1978 book La Parole aux n√©gresses (also published in English in 1986 as Black Sisters, Speak Out: Feminism and Oppression in Black Africa). She has a body of work published internationally, in both French and English. In 1982, she founded the Commission pour l'Abolition des Mutilations Sexuelles (CAMS, or Commission for the Abolition of Sexual Mutilation, in English), which fights for the abolition of FGM. Thiam is among the women featured in the anthology Daughters of Africa.Charles F. Peterson, Dubois, Fanon, Cabral: The Margins of Elite Anti-colonial Leadership, Lexington Books, 2007, p. 137, note 55.  Career  After completing early education in her home country of Senegal, Awa Thiam moved to France for higher education. While there, she earned not only a Ph. D. in Cultural Anthropology from the University of Paris VIII, but also a Ph. D. in Philosophy from Pantheon-Sorbonne Paris I. During her time in Europe, Thiam became a member of the Coordination des Femmes Noires, which is known to be one of the first groups of black feminists in France. Having gained multiple degrees overseas, Thiam returned to Senegal, and became Assistant Professor of Research at the Fundamental Institute of Black Africa at Cheikh Anta Diop University of Dakar. In 1987, Thiam petitioned the institution to build a Department of Anthropology of the Sexes, but her idea was ultimately rejected by the administration. In pursuit of improving the lives and status of African women, Thiam was a founding member of the Commission of the Abolition of Sexual Mutilation (also known as CAMS or Commission pour l'Abolition des Mutilations Sexuelles, in French), which was later dissolved and resurrected as CAMS-International. She speaks extensively on the topic of female genital mutilation (FGM), claiming that the practice is merely a thinly-veiled form of patriarchal control. In her article for International Social Science Journal, Thiam states: \\"the purpose of these practices, whether it is admitted or not, is to control female sexuality. Some indeed do not hesitate to say that the aim is to reduce women‚Äôs hyper- sensuality. In any case the result remains the same: to make the young girl essentially a future reproductive and productive element. Hence, her life is taken over and mapped out for her from birth to death by a patriarchal society, which ensures that she is kept in her place at all stages of her development.\\" Outside of the academic realm, Awa Thiam is the Minister of Health and Social Action, and Chair of the Committee on Health, Population, Social Affairs, and Solidarity. In addition, she is the Director of the National Center for Assistance and Training of Women under the Ministry of Women and Children. She is also a co-founder of the Alliance for a New Citizenship in Dakar.  Impact  Thiam is a strong advocate for the abolition of female genital mutilation (FGM). Her book Black Sisters, Speak Out: Feminism and Oppression in Black Africa (also published in English as Speak Out, Black Sisters: Feminism and Oppression in Black Africa), which was originally published in French as La Parole aux n√©gresses in 1978, addresses this topic in depth. The book, one of the first of its kind, holds interviews of survivors and calls for change. It also passes judgement on patriarchy for inciting violence against women, by women, stating that \\"it would seem that males have forced women to become their own torturers, to butcher each other.\\" While much of her work is in regard to fighting female genital mutilation in Africa, Thiam is also an activist against polygamy, forced motherhood, veiling, forced sterilization, and illiteracy. In her book, Black Sisters, Speak Out, she also stresses the importance of African women standing up for themselves and one another over white feminists trying to step in and fix African women, which she sees as just another type of colonialism. \\"People who understand nothing of ritual practices must beware of attacking them, especially when they base their judgment on criteria that bear no relationship to the mentalities of people in the society under consideration. The women of Black Africa have suffered enough from these colonial and neo-colonial attitudes.\\" While Thiam's work seeks to unite African women against FGM, her work has not always been well received by her African female audience. Even as her western audience have embraced Thiam's work, the audience she seeks to empower and activate has often not had the same response. Members of her African audience have asserted that Thiam does not understand why women may support FGM, and that she is not taking into account the culture as a whole when she writes about the need to abolish FGM. Though there were many factors involved in the decision, the country of Senegal did, in fact, ban FGM in January 1999 in response to female activist speaking out against the practice. However, it is reported that while this is a political victory, it may have come due to the fact that the largest people group in power at that point, the Wolof, did not practise FGM. There is still a large resistance in the country to the eradication of FGM. Awa Thiam still works to improve public health for the country of Senegal as Minister of Health and Social Action, and Chair of the Committee . Awa Thiam has also been honoured with the French governmental Medal for the Defense of Women's Rights.

Yuriwaka (also Yuriwaka Daijin or Minister Yuriwaka) is the titular hero of a Japanese tale of vengeance. Yuriwaka, famed for his enormous iron bow, is victorious as a general against the Mongolian forces, but is abandoned on an island by a traitorous subordinate (Beppu) who usurps his governorship. Yuriwaka's hawk (Midori-maru) couriers back a letter to his wife, who prays to the shrine, and through divine intervention, Yuriwaka returns to the province of his governorship. He withholds his identity until the opportune moment to prove his prowess on his iron bow, and avenges himself on the traitor. The tale has been regarded as a Japanese rendition of the Greek epic of Ulysses, but a number of commentators have rejected this assumption, finding no convincing account of how the tale could have been transmitted. The common explanation is that Christian missionaries introduced the tale. The oldest known reference is from 1514, giving the names of the hero and the hawk. Formerly the oldest was thought to be a record of Yuriwaka being narrated in February 1551, a short time after the first European missionary contact with Japan. The \\"Tale of Yuriwaka\\" (or \\"The Minister Yuriwaka\\") has existed in the form of librettos for performance in the k≈çwakamai dance since the late Muromachi period (16th century or even earlier), and later adapted for the j≈çruri puppet play and kabuki theater. The story has also been transmitted in folktale form widely throughout Japan, with a tradition that is particularly strong in the southerly ≈åita Prefecture where the tale is set. Variants have also been recited in Oki Island by local priestesses. Texts It had been thought that the oldest reference to this work occurred in the diary of ( () in the entry for February 10, 1551 where the work recorded as \\"Yuriwaka\\" in hiragana was said to have been narrated in Kyoto that day.

Summary  Below is a summary of the Yuriwaka tale as given in the k≈çwakamai texts.: excerpt and annotation to the Keich≈ç 14 (1609) text. Early life Yuriwaka was born after his childless father , the Minister of the Left under Emperor Saga, prayed to the Kannon goddess of mercy of temple in Yamato Province (now Hase-dera). Yuriwaka becomes Minister of the right at age 17, and marries the daughter of major counselor Akitoki. Battle with Mongols By divine oracle, Yuriwaka is appointed general to face the \\"Mukuri\\" (Mongols) who have landed their fleet in Hakata in the south of Japan. He is armed with an iron bow measuring 8 shaku 5 sun (approximately 8.5 feet), and 363 arrows. He is granted governorship of Tsukushi Province, while leaving his wife to reside in neighboring Bungo Province. The Mongols had been driven away by kamikaze \\"divine winds\\". Yuriwaka leads a fleet of ships in pursuit, and eventually a naval battle unfolds at (\\"open sea of Chikura\\"), supposedly somewhere between Japan and China/Korea. On the Mongolian side, a general spews his breath causing a fog, but this is dispelled by Japanese deities. Buddhist inscriptions also turn into arrows and swords, attacking the Mongols. Yuriwaka fights ferociously, spending nearly all his arrows in battle. He gains victory when the four Mongolian grand generals succumb. Treachery and vengeance Yuriwaka wishes to repose on \\"Genkai-ga-shima\\" island (which may or may not be Genkai Island and falls into slumber for 3 days, as happens when such a hero exerts his \\"mighty strength\\". Subordinates named the Beppu brothers hatch a plot and report Yuriwaka dead, causing him to be left abandoned on this island. Beppu Tar≈ç, the elder sibling, is promoted governor of Tsukushi. Beppu Tar≈ç makes amorous advances on Yuriwaka's wife. But the faithful wife is resolved to commit suicide should her true husband not return, and begins to bestow personal effects such as her biwa and koto, and releasing kept animals, which included a hawk named Midori- maru. The hawk reaches the island where his master is marooned, and brings back Yurikwaka's letter written in blood on oak leaves. Learning of her husband's survival, she tries to make the hawk deliver inkstick and inkstone but the bird falls by the weight and its body is found awash. The wife prays at Usa Shrine for the husband's safe return, and the wish is granted. A fisherman and his boat is blown away by wind from the inlet of Iki Province, finds Yuriwaka on \\"Genkai-ga-shima\\" island, and brings him back to the Japanese mainland. Yuriwaka arrives in Hakata but he is so haggard-looking that no one recognizes him. Beppu on a whim decides to employ the strange man, and entrusts him to an old man named Kadowaki. Around this time, Beppu has decided to execute Yuriwaka's wife who would not show him any affection. This is prevented by Kadowaki who sacrifices his daughter instead. In the k≈çwakamai dance text, it is an unnamed girl who was executed by drowning in pond. In the New Year's archery ceremony at Usa Shrine, Yuriwaka (now known as \\"Koke-maru\\") is ordered by Beppu to accompany him as an assistant to hand out the arrows. Yuriwaka mocks all the archery contestants and is ordered to shoot an arrow himself. Yuriwaka thereupon demonstrates his ability to draw and fire the famed iron bow, definitive proof that he is Yuriwaka of the strongbow. The men of ≈åtomo clan and the Matsura band prostrate themselves. Beppu Tar≈ç surrenders but is not forgiven, and meets a gruesome death by sawing his head over 7 days. Yuriwaka rewards his fisherman rescuer with Iki Province and Tsushima Province, and appoints Kadowaki to a position of governance (mandokoro) at his plantation estates (sh≈çen) in Tsukushi Province. Yuriwaka himself goes to the capital and becomes a general.  Legends  The legend occurs throughout Japan, distributed widely from Okinawa to Hokkaido, a heavy concentration in Kyushu, especially Oita Prefecture. Legend in Oita The English translation in an anthology by folklorist Richard Dorson is similar to this. In the Oita version, Yuriwaka is born as the son of Kinmitsu, the Minister of the Left. He grows up to be a brave youth, known for his skill with the bow an arrow. The iron bow is already in his possession in his youth. He marries a princess named Kasuga-hime, and is appointed kokushi (governor) of Bungo Province. Yuriwaka is ordered to dispel the vast army of Mongols (or \\"Muguri\\") invading Japan, and defeats them decisively in a sea battle off Tsushima island. After the victory, he is betrayed by his subordinate Beppu Tar≈ç, and left abandoned on Genkai Island. Beppu Tar≈ç returns to Japan and submits a false report that Yuriwaka died of illness, thereby gaining an appointment of the governorship over Bungo that has been left vacant. Kasuga-hime is accosted by Beppu Tar≈ç, but incredulous of Yuriwaka's demise, releases the hawk Midori- maru with a letter tied to its leg. The hawk reaches Genkai Island, and Yuriwaka sends a reply written in blood. Kasugahime then ties inkstone, brush, and ink stick to the hawk to deliver, but the bird is overcome by weight and falls to the sea, washing up on Yuriwaka's island. Yuriwaka gains passage on a storm-drifted fishing boat, and upon his return to Bungo conceals his identity, assuming the pseudonym \\"Koke-maru\\", entering service under Beppu Tar≈ç. At the New Year's archery ceremony, Yuriwaka ridicules Beppu and demonstrates his own skill by drawing the famed iron bow (which proves his identity). Yuriwaka shoots the treacherous Beppu Tar≈ç and exacts his revenge. Yuriwaka is reunited with his wife, and regains the governorship. The girl who had sacrificed herself to receive the death penalty in place of Yuriwaka's wife is known as Manju-hime (‰∏áÂØøÂß´) in this Oita tradition, and is the daughter of the gatekeeper old man. Her drowning is set at the pond named Makomo-no-ike (Ëè∞„ÅÆÊ±†), and on that spot the hero erected the temple . Also, to pay respect to the hawk Midori-maru, he erected the Jingu-ji temple on . Iki Island pracitces The legend as found on Iki Island is considered a composite of various tales. Here, shamanistic miko priestesses, locally called ichij≈ç, perform a ritual by placing a bow atop a shallow bentwood box called the yuri (Áõí), while reciting the Yuriwaka sekkyo. According to the text of the Yuriwaka sekkyo published by Shinobu Orikuchi, Yuriwaka was Momotar≈ç the peach boy (or someone with that childhood name), who later leads troops to vanquish oni (ogres). In a variant, the father is Sumiyaki Kogor≈ç (Kogor≈ç Charcoalmaker) from Usuki, ≈åita, also known as (‰∏á„ÅÆÈï∑ËÄÖ). He had great wealth but no children and loses in a contest with Asahi no ch≈çja who is not so wealthy by blessed with children. Afterwards, he prays day and night to the Kannon, which is answered when Yuriwaka is born., Sekkyo so no 2\\" The Yuriwaka daijin marries the general's daughter Teruhi-hime (ËºùÊó•Âß´), going on an ogre-subjugating campaign to Keiman (Ëä•Ê∫Ä) country, ruled by Akudoku-≈ç (ÊÇ™ÊØíÁéã) identifiable as ). He is betrayed by the Shikibu-day≈´ brothers, and left abandoned on a small isle in Keiman, but returns to wreak his vengeance. Traditions regarding the hawk The hawk Midori-maru is enshrined in Kodaka Jinja on Genkai Island. There is a local tradition that Yuriwak was abandoned on Meshima in the island group, southeast of Got≈ç Islands. The ≈ådai My≈çjin (È∑πÂ§ßÊòéÁ•û) shrine there is said to be built in veneration of the hawk, Midori-maru. In Seir≈ç, Niigata, Yuriwaka's hawk came to live in a forest near the Takao Kannon-ji temple, according to one record (Echigo noshi), and the founding story of the Kannon hall at Mount Seir≈ç(copied 1608) says the building was founded to enshrine the hawk. Relation with Homer's Odyssey  Tsubouchi Sh≈çyo claimed Homer's Odyssey was transmitted to Japan in some form, and adapted into Japanese to become Yuriwaka (Waseda bungaku, 1906). Similarity of the names Ulysses and Yuriwaka, and motif of the wives buying time to fend off suitors (Penelope does so by weaving) are some of the parallels (cited by ) Tsubouchi while allowing that it is not known \\"which country's folk\\" might have passed on the epic, he arrived at the idea that it might have entered through \\"Sakai or Yamaguchi\\". These places are connected with Portuguese missionaries, and Tsubouchi's view is considered a theory of transmission by the early Portuguese in Japan (Nanban-jin). Shinmura Izuru's Nanbanki is an even stronger advocate of the theory. Opposition This theory was at one time under sharply attack by such men as Tsuda S≈çkichi, Yanagita Kunio, Takano Tatsuyuki, Watsuji Tetsur≈ç. The main thrust to the opposition's argument is that tales of this type are widely disseminated worldwide, and the similarities can be coincidental. And Yuriwaka was performed already in 1551, only 7 years after the Portuguese reached Japan and brought the Tanegashima rifle, which is insufficient time for the story to be absorbed and adapted, according to : Kanesaki Takeo, (1982), Mokuba to sekigy≈´ Êú®È¶¨„Å®Áü≥Áâõ , Hosei University, pp. 211‚Äì226. Support Among Tsubouchi's supporters are, aside from Shinmura, Esther Lowell Hibbard (professor at Doshisha University) and James. T. Araki. Araki argued that even if Yuriwaka was performed as early as 1551, it was possible for Francis Xavier's interpreter Juan Fernandez to have transmitted the tale around 1550. Some papers that express agreement are (2004) and (2016) The proponents point out that Ulysses and Yuriwaka demonstrate parallel motifs at each stage in the plot, unlike other like tales. Further interpretation The premise that Araki, etc. relies on is that the oldest record dated to 1551. But it has since become known that Ungyoku waka sh≈ç (Èõ≤ÁéâÂíåÊ≠åÊäÑ) predates it, making it more problematic for the Portuguese transmission theory. However, if one take Tsubouchi and Niimura's definition Nanban-jin theory more broadly to include Muslims living in Asia, there is still a viable possibility, as Minakata Kumagusu ha pointed out. rejects Tsubouchi's theory of transmission during the Portuguese missionary period, and regards it a story spread widely throughout Eurasia in prehistoric times. Yuriwaka bears resemblance to the central Asian epic of Alpamysh, which perhaps carried the storyline eventually to Japan. Yuriwaka and the K≈çga Sabur≈ç legend may have both traced such an Asiatic route, as conjectured by and others. Regarding Minamoto Yoshitsune is the theory that Yoshitsune is Genghis Khan (Áæ©Áµå=„Ç∏„É≥„ÇÆ„Çπ„Ç´„É≥Ë™¨; \\"Mongols\\" being the common factor with Yuriwaka). Looking further, one discovers that a Yoshitsune fairy tale called bears similarity to Yuriwaka.

Foss and Cindy L. Griffin in 1995. Invitational rhetoric is defined as ‚Äúan invitation to understanding as a means to create a relationship rooted in equality, immanent value, and self-determination.‚Äù The theory challenges the traditional definition of rhetoric as persuasion‚Äîthe effort to change others‚Äîbecause the objective of invitational rhetoric is not to persuade but to gain an understanding of the perspectives of others. Invitational rhetoric is part of an effort to formulate alternative conceptions of rhetoric that are not ‚Äúexploitative and oppressive but that contribute to a more respectful way of being a rhetor in the world.‚Äù A major assumption behind invitational rhetoric is that ‚Äúthe communication discipline, through its traditional constructs and theories, participates in this culture of domination,‚Äù and invitational rhetoric constitutes an effort to ‚Äúcontribute to the creation of more humane lives‚Äù for individuals. Core elements Invitational rhetoric is rooted in three feminist principles that ‚Äúexplicitly challenge the positive value the patriarchy accords to changing and thus dominating others‚Äù‚Äîequality, immanent value, and self-determination. * Equality: In contrast to the traditional rhetoric of persuasion, in which the rhetor is seen as superior to the audience, the rhetor and the audience are viewed as equal peers who share authority and expertise and contribute equally to an interaction. * Immanent value: Immanent value means that all individuals have unique, unrepeatable perspectives that should be appreciated for what they contribute to an interaction. * Self-determination: Self-determination is the principle that others are competent individuals who should be allowed to make their own decisions about their lives. Although change is not the objective of invitational rhetoric, change may occur as a result of an invitational interaction. Interacting with others inevitably produces changes of various kinds in interactants, but in the case of invitational rhetoric, both the rhetor and the audience may choose to change their perspectives as a result of the process of sharing perspectives. They do not, however, enter the interaction trying to impose their perspectives on and trying to change one another. Participants in invitational rhetoric value diverse perspectives because they recognize that every perspective is partial; as a result, they seek multiple perspectives to gain a more comprehensive understanding of an issue or situation. Invitational rhetors are particularly interested in exploring perspectives that are different from their own because they provide them with new information that enlarges their understanding. Because they are eager to engage different perspectives and to allow them to affect their own thinking, invitational participants enter an interaction willing to call into question their own perspectives. In contrast to persuasive rhetoric, which involves power-over and an attempt to establish power over others by changing them, in invitational rhetoric, the kind of power involved is power-with. This type of power is shared among the audience members and the rhetor and is used by all participants together to come to an understanding, to make a decision, or to solve a problem. Invitational rhetoric is one of many useful rhetorical options; it is not designed to be used in all situations. It is one of five modes of rhetoric‚Äîconquest, conversion, benevolent, advisory, and invitational‚Äîavailable to rhetors. In conquest rhetoric, rhetors try to establish their idea as the best among competing positions. Conversion rhetoric is rhetoric that is designed to change the minds or behaviors of others by convincing them that another way is superior. In benevolent rhetoric, the objective is to help individuals improve their lives and often involves providing useful information to others. Advisory rhetoric is designed to provide assistance requested by others; it is a response to an implicit or explicit request for information or advice. Rhetorical options in invitational rhetoric There are two primary rhetorical options in invitational rhetoric: (1) offering perspectives; and (2) creating external conditions that encourage audience members to share their perspectives with the rhetor. Offering perspectives Offering perspectives is the way by which rhetors share their perspectives with audience members, explaining what they know or understand about an issue or idea without advocating for those perspectives. Offering occurs verbally through the use of words to explain a rhetor's perspective or nonverbally through wearing particular kinds of clothing or displaying symbols that suggest an individual's identification. Wearing a charity bracelet, for example, suggests that a rhetor is identified with a certain cause or issue. Wearers of the bracelets are not attempting to persuade others to support the cause but are simply offering a perspective so that those who are curious about the bracelet can choose to explore the perspective being offered. Offering perspectives may be difficult to do in hostile situations when other interactants are not interested in hearing a different perspective or when conquest and conversion rhetorics are being used. In such cases, invitational rhetors may use re-sourcement so that they can offer their perspectives and continue to engage in invitational rhetoric. Re-sourcement is a term coined by feminist theorist Sally Miller Gearhart that means drawing energy from a new source‚Äî‚Äúa source other than the individual or system that provided the initial frame for the issue.‚Äù Re-sourcement involves two basic processes. The first is disengaging from the frame of the precipitating message‚Äîstepping away from the frame in which the message is being offered and recognizing that the response does not have to be couched in that same frame. The second process is developing a message that ‚Äúdoes not directly argue against or even address the message being offered. It presents a response addressed to a different exigence, need, or problem from the one implicit‚Äù in the initial message. The use of re-sourcement allows rhetors to value both themselves and their audience members and provides a space for more options for interaction in the future because it has not locked participants into an adversarial framework. An example of re-sourcement is a response suggested by linguist Suzette Haden Elgin to instances of sexual harassment. She offers what she calls the Boring Baroque Response to unwanted sexual proposals or sexually suggestive remarks. This strategy involves responding to such messages by telling a long story with many tedious details that is unrelated to and does not address the proposition offered by the instigator of the message. Creating external conditions The second primary rhetorical option in invitational rhetoric is creating external conditions. This option involves creating an environment that encourages audience members to share their perspectives with the rhetor. To accomplish this objective, the invitational rhetor attempts to create three conditions‚Äîsafety, value, and freedom. * Safety: Safety is the creation of ‚Äúa feeling of security and freedom from danger for the audience.‚Äù When safety is created in a rhetorical situation, audience members feel secure both physically and intellectually. They feel like they can safely share and question ideas and that the rhetor with whom they are sharing their perspectives will respect their ideas and will not degrade or belittle them. * Value: Value is acknowledgment by the rhetor that the audience members have intrinsic worth. Rhetors show that they value audience members when they treat them as unique individuals with worthwhile perspectives. They listen carefully to and seriously consider the perspectives audience members share. As a result, they encourage audience members to contribute in significant ways to the interaction. * Freedom: When rhetors give audience members freedom, they do not expect them to make the same choices they have made; they give them the freedom to believe and act as they themselves choose. Invitational rhetors allow any subjects to be introduced into the interaction and allow all assumptions to be questioned. Freedom also means that rhetors are not disappointed or angry if audience members choose not to adopt the perspectives they offer. The relationship between rhetor and audience will not be disrupted because of the difference in their perspectives. Applications Invitational rhetoric has been used as a tool of analysis in many articles, book chapters, books, theses, and dissertations in a variety of fields. Among the applications of invitational rhetoric are the following:   * Elmualim, Abbas Ali. ‚ÄúCulture and Leadership in Stakeholder Management.‚Äù In Construction Stakeholder Management, edited by Ezekiel Chinyio and Paul Olomolaiye, 175-90.

() Critiques of the theory Following are the major critiques that have been offered of the theory of invitational rhetoric. Some of the criticisms of invitational rhetoric concern conceptions of the nature and function of persuasion: * Persuasion is not violent, as invitational rhetoric suggests that it is. Some critics suggest that Sonja K. Foss and Cindy L. Griffin's view that rhetoric constitutes violence because it represents an attempt to violate another person's belief system is a flawed perspective. These critics note that those who engage in persuasion are not always trying to impose their will on audience members. In addition, such a view ignores the nature of audiences. Audience members may refuse to listen to persuasive messages and ‚Äúhave substantial power to resist messages with which they do not agree.‚Äù As a result, their individual belief systems are not being violated. These critics believe that ‚Äúthe impulse to persuade others is a constructive and valuable aspect of human symbolic interaction.‚Äù * Democracy will be undermined if persuasion is disallowed. The intent to change minds and situations is at the root of the deliberative process that takes place in a democracy. If persuasion is not seen as legitimate, democracy cannot be sustained. * Invitational rhetoric necessarily involves persuasion. Rhetors cannot help but be involved in persuasion when they offer their perspectives because the definition of rhetoric is persuasion; thus, persuasion or influence is an integral part of every symbolic interaction. Some critics use as support for this claim Foss and Griffin's initial article on invitational rhetoric. Although Foss and Griffin explain in this article that they are attempting to use the features of invitational rhetoric as they describe the theory, some critics suggest that, when they write about invitational rhetoric, they themselves are arguing that others should share their views. Thus, even Foss and Griffin cannot help but be engaged in persuasion, even when they are describing invitational rhetoric. * Invitational rhetoric cannot involve agency because the enactment of agency is only possible through an effort to persuade others. Although agency has many different definitions, some scholars limit the definition to the effort to change others‚Äîunless rhetors are working to get others to change their positions, they are not enacting agency. In such a view, agency does not involve the kinds of activities involved in invitational rhetoric such as understanding, listening, exploring, and sharing. Perspectives are exchanged, but because the rhetors do not take action in the form of attempting to persuade, they do not enact agency. Other critiques of the theory of invitational rhetoric are concerned with the nature of rhetoric and rhetorical theory: * The theory of invitational rhetoric is based on a simplistic, reductive account of rhetorical theory and practice. The rhetorical traditional is not characterized by a patriarchal bias because many definitions of rhetoric focus on interaction rather than coercion. The interaction of gender with rhetoric has been complicated and varied throughout the rhetorical tradition. * The appropriate objective for rhetorical engagement is social change, and it cannot be accomplished through invitational rhetoric. Invitational rhetoric valorizes non-confrontational and civil modes of interaction and thus cannot resist injustice and inequality; consequently, invitational rhetoric is ‚Äúdisabling to the oppressed.‚Äù * Invitational rhetoric replaces rhetoric with communication studies and thus does a disservice to the field of rhetoric. Foss and Griffin see the terms as synonymous, but they are not. The term rhetoric means public persuasion, so invitational rhetoric situates rhetoric in a different realm‚Äîthe realm of private, non-persuasive interaction. This is not an appropriate realm for rhetoric, and the status of rhetoric is devalued as a result of invitational rhetoric. Other critiques of invitational rhetoric have to do with a variety of other aspects of the theory: * A key tenet of invitational rhetoric is that all individuals have value; however, not all opinions or views have value. Invitational rhetors see others‚Äô perspectives as significant and as providing important input into an interaction. Critics suggest, however, that not all perspectives are equally valuable. Those that cause harm, suffering, and death‚Äîsuch as those of wife abusers and rapists‚Äîshould not be granted unconditional value and should not be appreciated and included in invitational dialogues. * The principles of immanent value and self-determination contradict the dialogic goal of understanding at the heart of invitational rhetoric. Immanent value and self- determination imply a focus on the solitary self and suggest that individuals should close themselves off from other perspectives and privilege their own perspectives. But the invitational practices of offering and willingness to yield are dependent upon interrelationships with others and require knowing and interacting with other people. Mutual enlargement can only happen in interaction, and such interaction contradicts key practices of invitational rhetoric. * Invitational rhetoric must include all of the ideas espoused by the theorists who influenced the development of invitational rhetoric. Ideas of theorists on which invitational rhetoric is based that were not a part of the theory of invitational rhetoric‚Äîsuch as Sally Miller Gearhart‚Äôs biologism and Sonia Johnson‚Äôs separatism‚Äîare imported into and considered part of the theory of invitational rhetoric. Critiques of any aspect of theories developed by those who have contributed to invitational rhetoric are applicable to invitational rhetoric. Two of the common criticisms of invitational rhetoric are misreadings of the theory. They attribute claims to invitational rhetoric that are the opposite of what Sonja Foss and Cindy Griffin explain in their original article on invitational rhetoric: * Invitational rhetoric is not appropriate in every situation. Although Foss and Griffin state that ‚Äúinvitational rhetoric is one of many useful and legitimate rhetorics, including persuasion, in which rhetors will want to be skilled,‚Äù some critics see them as calling for the use of invitational rhetoric on all occasions. These critics argue that there are times when persuasion should be used, such as in fighting fascism or trying to talk a friend out of committing suicide. * Because invitational rhetoric is a form of rhetoric appropriate only for women, it reifies the gender binary and essentializes women. Although Foss and Griffin state that invitational rhetoric is not confined to ‚Äúa particular population of rhetors‚Äù and is ‚Äúused at various times by some women and some men, some feminists and some non-feminists,‚Äù some critics see invitational rhetoric as appropriate for women only. These critics equate patriarchy with the masculine gender, and because Foss and Griffin label traditional rhetoric as patriarchal, these critics see the alternative‚Äîinvitational rhetoric‚Äîas linked exclusively to the feminine gender.

Portrait of Napoleon III, or initially called in French Portrait de S. M. l'Empereur (Portrait of His Majesty the Emperor) is an oil painting of 1861 by the French painter Jean-Hippolyte Flandrin, depicting France's Emperor Napoleon III standing in his Grand Cabinet. At its first presentation in the Universal Exhibition in 1862, the painting attracted praise for its true-to-life representation of Napoleon III. In 1853, the newly-appointed Emperor of the French Napoleon III commissioned Jean-Hippolyte Flandrin, a pupil of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and specialized painter of religious figures, to work on a standing portrait of him. The Emperor, displeased by Flandrin's depiction of him, cancelled the commission, and preferred Franz Xaver Winterhalter's painting of him in his coronation robes, with its more glorified and distinguished idealization. Reinstated in 1861, Flandrin recommenced work on his portrait, incentivized by a retrospective commission of 20,000 francs. According to Karine Huguenaud, Flandrin's portrait is a \\"penetrating psychological study of the emperor\\", extraordinarily capturing Napoleon III's \\"distant and inscrutable look\\". Standing in his G√©n√©ral de Division uniform, Napoleon III is depicted in the Grand Cabinet at the Tuileries Palace amidst pointed attributes: a marble bust of Napoleon Bonaparte, crowned with laurel, over his right shoulder and a Napoleonic eagle in the background. On his desk are French maps and a copy of Julius Caesar's Commentarii de Bello Gallico. \\"This\\", exulted writer Th√©ophile Gautier, \\"is without doubt the first 'real' portrait which we have of Your Majesty\\", referring to the realistic approach in Flandrin's work. The Portrait of Napoleon III was first shown at the 1862 Universal Exhibition in London, on donation from the Emperor. Flandrin's painting was a standout wherever it was exhibited: the Universal Exhibition, Paris Salon (1863), at the Paris Ecole des Beaux-Arts (1864), and the Paris Exposition universelle (1867). The critics were positive: the sincerity of the subject exercised both intimacy and fascination, winning favor over Winhalter's coronation portrait. By 1884, Flandrin's painting was returned to the French government and displayed in the Palace of Versailles.

Ulugh Khan's first siege of Warangal failed because of a rebellion resulting from a false rumour about Ghiyath al-Din's death in Delhi. Ulugh Khan had to retreat to Devagiri, but he returned to Warangal within four months, this time with reinforcements from Delhi. Prataparudra was defeated and taken captive, resulting in the end of the Kakatiya dynasty.  Background  The Hindu Kakatiya kingdom, ruled by Prataparudra, was located in the eastern part of Deccan region of southern India. The Muslim Khalji rulers of Delhi Sultanate had invaded the Kakatiya capital Warangal twice, in 1310 and 1318, forcing Prataparudra to become their tributary. Amid the political instability resulting from the end of the Khalji dynasty in 1320, Prataparudra stopped sending tributes to Delhi. Subsequently, Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq ascended the throne of Delhi, and sent his son Ulugh Khan (later Muhammad bin Tughluq) against Prataparudra to extract tribute payments. Prataparudra initially put up a strong resistance against the invaders, but ultimately retreated to his capital Warangal. Ulugh Khan besieged Warangal, while another Delhi contingent led by Abu-Riza besieged Kotagiri.  First attack  Ulugh Khan's first siege was unsuccessful: the Muslim chroniclers blame a man named Ubaid for this failure, although their accounts vary about the exact cause. According to the Deccan chronicler Isami (c. 1349), Ulugh Khan plundered the Kakatiya territory on his way to Warangal. At Warangal, he besieged the fort for six months, but could not breach it. When Ghiyath al-Din expressed his displeasure at the siege operations in letters from Delhi, Ulugh Khan consulted his astrologer Ubaid. The astrologer declared that the fort would fall on a specific day, and offered to be executed if his prediction failed. However, the defenders did not show any sign of submission on that day, and therefore, Ubaid devised a plan to save himself. He spread a false rumour that Ghiyath al-Din had died in Delhi, and that Khalji sympathisers had revolted in Delhi. He also told the soldiers that Ulugh Khan had decided to kill the chief amirs of the Delhi army in Warangal, because he suspected them of being Khalji sympathisers. This caused a panic in the camp, and a section of the army rebelled and retreated from Warangal. According to the Delhi chronicler Ziauddin Barani, at one point, Ulugh Khan was on the verge of winning, and Prataparudra offered to negotiate a truce. However, Ulugh Khan refused the offer, as he was determined to annex Warangal. Meanwhile, the postal system connecting Ulugh Khan's army to Delhi broke down. Amid this confusion, Ulugh Khan's associates Ubaid and Shaikh Zada-i-Dimashqi spread the false rumour. The rest of Barani's account is similar to that of Isami. According to the Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta, it was Ulugh Khan who asked Ubaid to spread the false rumour, because he wanted to seize the throne of Delhi from his father. He had hoped that the army chiefs would support him after learning about Ghiyath al-Din's death. This plan backfired, when the army chiefs rebelled and planned to kill him instead. He managed to flee to Delhi with help from the loyal chief Malik Timur. Once in Delhi, Ulugh Khan falsely accused Ubaid and other amirs of the conspiracy. Ghiyath al-Din accepted these allegations, and punished the amirs. The veracity of Ibn Battuta's account is doubtful, because it contradicts the Indian chronicles, and because he wrote it from memory several years later, after returning to Morocco. Whatever the case, it is known that Ulugh Khan's first attack on Warangal ended in a failure. Taking advantage of the situation, the Kakatiya army stormed the invaders' camp, and plundered it. Ulugh Khan had to flee, and the Kakatiya army pursued him till Kotagiri, where Abu Riza came to his rescue. He ultimately retreated to Devagiri. Prataparudra's victory made him complacent: he believed that he had achieved a decisive victory, and that the Delhi army would not return to Warangal. He organized a feast to celebrate his victory, and exhausted the fort's granary. He also allowed his soldiers to take leave from the military service, and return to agriculture and farming.  Second attack  When Ghiyath al-Din came to know about the failure of the siege, he severely punished the rebels. He then sent reinforcements to Devagiri, and instructed Ulugh Khan to launch a fresh attack on Warangal. Within four months of his retreat, Ulugh Khan marched to Telangana again, this time capturing enemy forts en route to Warangal. First, he captured a place called Badrikot (possibly modern Bidar). Then, he marched to Bodhan, and captured it after a 3-4 day siege. The defending governor and his companions embraced Islam to save their lives. Next, Ulugh Khan marched to Warangal, where he first besieged and captured the outer mud fort, and then surrounded the inner citadel. The siege lasted for five months, which suggests that the defenders put up a strong resistance. The scarcity of provisions in the fort may have forced Prataparudra to surrender. After he opened the gates of the citadel, the invaders ransacked and plundered the houses and destroyed the public buildings. Ulugh Khan sent Prataparudra and his family members to Delhi, escorted by a contingent led by his lieutenants Qadir Khan and Khawaja Haji. Prataparudra appears to have committed suicide on the banks of the Narmada River on the way to Delhi.

This moth species is only found in the New England region of the United States. Larvae in early stages mainly feed on meadow-sweet whereas larvae in later stages show variation in food sources such as blackberry and black cherry leaves. Larvae have a black body with orange/black spines on their back that are used to deter predators. Pupation occurs during the summer and adult moths come out around September. Adult females are usually bigger than males. Both males and females have dark colored bodies and wide white bands on their wings that are similarly observed in their sister species, Hemileuca maia. The flight season for adult Hemileuca lucina is in September and it lasts around two weeks. Females secrete a pheromone to attract the males and once they pair up, they copulate for about one to two hours. Hemileuca lucina is univoltine, meaning that it has one brood per year. Females lay eggs on the twig of their host plants that look like a tightly packed ring. H. luncina larvae are subject to prey by wasps, stinkbugs, and certain types of spiders. The tachinid fly and ichneumonid wasp are parasites of caterpillars as well. Taxonomy The New England buck moth is one of the many species in genus Hemileuca and family Saturniidae. The genus Hemileuca was first named by Francis Walker in 1855. The family Saturniidae, which usually refers to giant silkworm moth or royal moth, was created by Jean Baptiste Boisduval in 1837. The New England buck moth's binomial name, Hemileuca lucina, was given by Henry Edwards in 1887. At first, this species was widely confused with Hemileuca maia (Drury, 1773) as the species' caterpillars and adult forms were nearly indistinguishable. However, subtle but noticeable differences shown in wing translucence and band width allowed separation of the species. There are 33 known species of the genus Hemileuca. Of these 33 species, distinct species groups are formed based on larval characteristics, adult phenotype and relative food resources. Below are the list of specific species in the maia group of genus Hemileuca. *Hemileuca lucina (H. Edwards, 1887) *Hemileuca maia (Drury, 1773) *Hemileuca nevadensis (Stretch, 1872) *Hemileuca slosseri (Peigler & Stone, 1989) All of the maia group species reside on the east of Mississippi River and also exhibit similar appearances, making them sister species. Description Side view Adult females are generally larger than adult males. Males and females also have different abdominal tufts. The width of the female forewing bands range from 30‚Äì34 mm whereas the male forewing bands range from 23‚Äì28 mm. Among the species, each adult moth tends to have a different wingspan, wing translucence and band width. In general, smaller and more translucent-winged moths are observed in central Maine and larger and darker moths are observed in southern Massachusetts. This hints that moth phenotype varies and possibly depends on a variety of factors including location, temperature, etc. Both Hemileuca lucina larvae and adult are often mistaken for that of Hemileuca maia and Hemileuca nevadensis. The early stages of Hemileuca maia larvae appear very similar to Hemileuca lucina larvae and the larvae in later stages are almost identical. Compared to Hemileuca maia larvae, Hemileuca lucina larvae are in general smaller and exhibit a sharply defined white stripe above the feet that is either faintly present or absent in H. maia larvae. For adult moths, H. maia is darker than H. lucina and also has narrower white forewing bands with circular spots. In contrast, H. nevadensis adults have wider white forewing bands that are more convex than H. lucina adults. In terms of translucence, H. nevadensis are generally more opaque.  Distribution and habitat  As given by the name, the New England buck moth can be found in the New England states, specifically Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts. It is reported to live in wet meadows in the New England region. The species is very local and few have been found in other regions in the world. Because of this, population density is often subject to large fluctuations due to changes in the local environment. Distribution of this species is not fully understood yet due to the species' restricted habitat range compared to its host plants' range. Food resources Early findings of larval host plants state that H. lucina caterpillars feed on broadleaf spirea and oaks but recent findings suggest that they mainly feed on meadowsweet (Spiraea latifolia). The relative age of the shrub that the caterpillars consume also influences caterpillar growth as larvae (third instar) both showed preference to new leaves and exhibited increased growth after the consumption of new leaves as compared to mature leaves. Larvae in the early instars primarily feed on meadow-sweet but larvae in later instars were also seen consuming blackberry (Rubus species), cinquefoil (Potentilla species) and black cherry. Adult female moths are known to not feed on anything, but the general pattern of adult feeding needs more exploration. Parental care Oviposition Oviposition refers to a process in which animals lay eggs. Hemileuca lucina females lay eggs in batches three months after the larval developmental period, which is usually around September. Females tend to make one or very few decisions on where to deposit the eggs. This is different from other species that oviposit eggs singularly as it is known that they make hundreds of decisions on where to oviposit the eggs, when to oviposit the eggs, etc. The flight time of Hemileuca lucina is about two weeks during September and they lay eggs once a year (univoltine). Hemileuca lucina females expand their wings, which is often seen as a signal for hormone production. The hormone is used to attract males and once males are with females, they copulate for about one to two hours. The host plant in which females oviposit eggs is called Spiraea latifolia and they usually lay one or two batches of eggs on the stem of the host plant. Females use their abdomen and shift it left and right around the twig and start laying eggs in a half-circle. At first, these half-circles of eggs are nearly empty, lacking any form. Females then re-crawl up the twig to fill in the gaps, which makes the batch of eggs look like a long ring. These eggs overwinter and hatch around May. Local weather conditions are one of the known factors that can change the hatching period. It was also observed that females preferred the periphery of the twig for their oviposition location as sunlight was more abundant compared to the inner side. Shady regions were avoided for most of the females but the reason is not fully understood. Social behavior Caterpillar sociality Larval response to predators or other harmful factors are mainly defense or escape. Defense takes on multiple forms, as larvae thrash, bite and regurgitate when near predators. Such defensive behavior is mostly seen in larvae of the first three instars. Aggregation behavior can be explained by the early instar larvae's tendency to group together to defend themselves against predators. Once larvae enter the fourth instar however, they show escape behaviors as most larvae are in solitary phase. Escape behavior also takes on multiple forms as larvae drops from the host plant to the ground or cringe and curl tightly on the plant. As a result of escaping, late instar larvae tended to disperse rather than aggregate. Life cycle Eggs An average of 146 eggs are laid per batch. Each egg weighs around 1.63 mg and ranges from 1.13-1.89 mg. The specific time in which the eggs are laid does not seem to determine larval fitness. Similarly, the range of egg weight seems insignificant as there is no known information on whether or not quality/health of larvae depends on egg weight. However, female age seems to control egg weight, as the weights declined as females aged. The eggs hatch in May. Larvae Larvae Generation for Hemileuca lucina larvae starts around May and lasts until July. Larvae are black and have spines on their back that are black and orange. These spines can cause pain through dermatitis when handled improperly. During the first four instars, larvae show gregarious behaviors as they move in clumps. Group size tends to decrease over time due to various factors including weather, predators, parasitoids, food availability, etc. During the fourth and fifth instars, most larvae show solitary behavior. During the sixth instar, larvae are completely solitary and display yellow stripes on their back. Pupa During this stage, larvae move away from the host plant and burrow into the ground for pupation. The pupa resides in the soil for the entire summer until September. Adult Adult New England buck moths usually emerge in the morning, faster than its sister species, Hemileuca maia. Flight season is about two weeks long for adult moths. Flight usually occurs in September but, depending on weather conditions, it often occurs in October. Males are known to fly in the late morning and mating occurs around 10:00 am ‚Äì 1:00 pm. After copulating for about two hours, females find host plants for oviposition. Enemies Predators Few predators of Hemileuca lucina larvae have been reported, including wasps, stinkbugs and orb-weaving spiders. Specifically, vespid wasps (Polistes dominula and Polistes fuscatus) have shown to prey upon H. lucina caterpillars that are masticated and given to wasp larvae as nutritional sources. It was observed that wasps attack one member of the group rather than attacking multiple larvae at the same time but the specific method of wasp predation requires further investigation. Moreover, H. lucina larvae's spines are known to be ineffective against some social wasps (P. dominulus and P. fuscatus) as they are able to bite off the spines before masticating the larvae. Stinkbugs such as Podisus maculiventris are also reported predators of gregarious caterpillars like H. lucina, but their interaction with the caterpillars are rarely observed due to low numbers of stinkbugs in the spring. It has been observed that adult moths are attracted to three species of araneid spiders and their webs. The specific cause behind the moth's attraction to these webs is not known but pheromone mimicry seems to be the widely used strategy in these spiders. Parasites There are few notable parasites of Hemileuca lucina caterpillars including tachinid fly (Compsilura concinnata) and ichneumonid wasp (Ichneumonidae - Hyposoter fugitivus), both of which are not H. lucina specific parasites. Of these two, C. concinnata is responsible for mortality of H. lucina caterpillars as 30% mortality was found in Massachusetts. Even though C. concinnata is a major cause of H. lucina caterpillar mortality, its predation is not specific to H. lucina caterpillars as 36% mortality on Hemileuca maia was found in southern Massachusetts. It was observed that C. concinnata attacks each H. lucina caterpillar aggregation and ultimately lays live larvae in the host. The specific mechanism in which the tachinid fly lays the larvae needs further investigation. It was also found that the tachinid fly's attack triggers H. lucina caterpillars to separate from the aggregation by dropping off the host plant or inducing solitary status. In both cases, the tachinid fly then had an advantage to prey on the separated larvae that fails to rejoin the aggregation. Similarly, ichneumonid wasps do not only parasitize on H. lucina as there are reported incidents of H. maia getting parasitized.  Defense mechanisms  Defense mechanisms refer to ways in which an organism protects itself from dangers caused by enemies. Various lepidopteran larvae are known to have urticating spines or stinging hairs that contain venoms. Not all chemical components of the venom have been identified but it is currently known that histamine or histamine-like substances are parts of the venom. These urticating spines and hairs that serve as protectors for these larvae could have evolutionarily developed as those free of such spines and hairs were easily preyed on. Even if the spines do not contain venoms, they still serve to protect larvae as physical barriers from small invertebrate predators. Painful stings and swellings are noted results that are inflicted by Hemileuca lucina spines. Other than the spines or hairs, aposematic larvae often use regurgitation as an alternative deterrent method. Acquisition of multiple defense mechanisms are especially beneficial as it not only maximizes protection but it also allows matching a certain type of defense to specific predators/parasites.  Mating  Males will fly during the late morning, with mating occurring during the late morning and into the early afternoon. H. lucina females use a pheromone to attract males. Once male and female adults meet, copulation occurs. The mated pairs remain copulated for about 2 hours. After separation, females look for an oviposition site and lay eggs in their most preferable spot. It has been found that H. lucina males do not have the ability to discern pheromones secreted by H. lucina and H. nevadensis, often resulting in interspecific mating.

He was previously the investigative reporter for Nine News Queensland, a reporter on Nine News Darwin, a European correspondent for Nine News and a Queensland reporter for A Current Affair. Career Arvier obtained business and journalism degrees from the University of Queensland and early in his career worked casually in the Nine Network Brisbane newsroom before moving to Darwin where he became a reporter and fill-in presenter for Nine News. He then became the Nine Network's Europe correspondent where he covered events ranging from Samantha Stosur's run to the 2010 French Open final to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. He has also been a reporter on Nine News Perth. In 2011, Arvier returned to Queensland where he became a reporter on A Current Affair. In March 2014, Arvier was attacked by a Gold Coast pastor while covering a story about the pastor who had admitted to engaging in inappropriate behaviour with women. In May 2016, Arvier moved to Los Angeles where he became the Nine Network's US correspondent, covering major events such as the death of Muhammad Ali and Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 United States presidential campaign. In May 2017, Arvier returned to Brisbane where he became a reporter for Nine News Queensland. In August 2017, while on assignment in Korea covering the standoff between North Korea and the United States over the rogue state's missile testing, Arvier was in the middle of a live cross to Nine's Melbourne afternoon news bulletin when it had to be shut down upon the arrival of a South Korean soldier. Arvier and the camera crew were detained for 20 minutes following the incident, after which they were escorted from the area where the live cross was conducted and released without charge. In June 2019, Arvier was appointed North American correspondent for Nine News, replacing Robert Penfold who recently retired from the network. In May 2020, he provided on-site eyewitness reports from the unfolding Twin Cities riots arising from the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis for Today and Nine News, for which he won several awards at the 2020 Queensland Clarion Awards, including the Journalist of the Year. At one point during coverage of the riots, Arvier and television crew were detained by police in the city, but were later released without charge.

He is nicknamed \\"The Living Legend\\". Early life Billy Ray Higginbottom was born in Akron, Ohio, on September 20, 1954, he has African-American heritage from both of his parents. He identifies as a Black Indian, saying his grandfather was \\"a Heron black American.\\" Thunder is 6'3\\", 225 pounds, and over 60 years old. Education He attended Archbishop Hoban High School from 1969-1973, where he was a defensive end on the school football team. After graduating in 1973 he joined the Army, followed by a stint in the Navy and reenlisted in the Army, before he'd had enough of military life and decided to try his hand at professional football. Career While in the service Billy Ray was also part of a semi-pro football team in Germany, so pro-football seemed like a good fit. He tried out for the Washington Redskins and the Dallas Cowboys, without making the team in either case. After a short stint at the University of Akron Billy Ray found his true calling, quite by accident. Billy Ray's connection with horses goes all the way back through his father, who was a local expert on horses. When his stepbrother, Anthony Winfield, invited him to a rodeo in Georgia, where he was going to do some bull riding, Billy Ray had to check it out. African Americans left the South and an agrarian lifestyle in a series of migrations during the early part of the 20th century. Rodeos, horses, and bulls and access to them are far and few between in our modern-day cities. The portrayal of \\"The Wild, Wild West,\\" cowboys and rodeos as all White, or nearly all White hasn't made a career in rodeo any more attractive to urbanized African Americans. When he went to check out his stepbrother he was intrigued. As the story goes, he met some buckle bunnies there and naturally wanting to impress the ladies he bragged about his riding skills. His step brother offered to loan Billy Ray his outfit and set everything up for him to show off his non-existent riding skills, after everyone else was done. Billy Ray tried to back out, but every excuse he came up with was shot down by Anthony. Anthony and Billy Ray agreed that Billy Ray would mount up and ready himself, inside the gate, on top of a 2,000 lb. bull. Anthony was supposed to pull him off before the gate opened. Unluckily, for Billy Ray, Anthony did not pull him off at the last minute, as they had agreed. Billy Ray ended up in the hospital with a couple of broken ribs and the girl by his side. For the next 19 years he rode bulls in a number of prorodeo events around the world sanctioned by the Rodeo Cowboys Association (RCA) which was later renamed to the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) and the International Professional Rodeo Association. For the last 13 years he's been riding bucking broncs. His long career doesn't make him the oldest, active, professional rodeo cowboy, but it does put him in the senior category. Many rodeo cowboys don't continue to compete professionally beyond their 30s, when Thunder started. As with jockeys, the majority of bull riders and bareback bronc riders are much smaller than Billy Ray. Mentoring Billy Ray feels strongly about getting young Black people involved in the rodeo tradition of America's Black cowboys, like Bill Pickett, Nat Love, Bose Ikard, James Beckwourth, Stagecoach Mary and Bass Reeves. Each of these individuals made significant contributions to the American cowboy tradition and the history of the American West. Wherever he goes Billy Ray counsels and mentors youth about all the ways they can begin to be involved in the continuation of an American tradition and earn college scholarships.

She co-founded the Black Lives Matter Global Network, where she served as a strategic partner and organizing coordinator, and founded The Marsha P. Johnson Institute, where she serves as executive director. Early life and education Hearns was born in Columbus, Ohio. She grew up in a single-parent home with two sisters. She struggled being raised as a \\"little black boy who was existentially trapped in a boy‚Äôs body, but was definitely very much so female.\\" Before discovering that she was transgender, she thought she was gay, and dealt with suicidal thoughts as she thought being gay was a sin. Hearns was very interested in black power, and educated herself about Malcolm X and the civil rights movement. She became a youth organizer, and later attended Central State University, a historically black university in Wilberforce, Ohio. Career In 2013, Hearns co-founded the Black Lives Matter Global Network. As a strategic partner and organizing coordinator, she helped develop policy for the network, including the 2016 policy platform \\"A Vision for Black Lives\\". She co-organized a National Day of Action in 2015 to bring attention to the black trans women who were killed that year. In 2015, Hearns was one of the organizers of The Movement for Black Lives, a national three-day conference in Cleveland, Ohio. Hearns founded The Marsha P. Johnson Institute, where she serves as Executive Director. The mission of the institute, which is set to launch in Spring 2018, is to train and support black trans women and gender-nonconforming femmes. Hearns has also served as a coordinator for GetEQUAL and as an ambassador for the Trans Women of Color Collective (TWOCC). Her writings have been featured in publications including the City University of New York Law Review and Ebony. Activism In 2015, Hearns appeared on Democracy Now! and All Things Considered, discussing the shooting of Tamir Rice. In February 2017, Hearns, along with other trans activists, criticized the pussyhat that had become a symbol of the 2017 Women's March, stating that the movement needs to be truly intersectional and consider the \\"anatomy of all people\\". In August 2017, Hearns and fellow organizers at the Marsha P. Johnson Institute, along with other trans activists, spoke out against an episode of The Breakfast Club radio show where remarks were made about trans women. Comedian Lil Duval joked about killing a sex partner if she turned out to be transgender, and host Charlamagne Tha God, while noting that killing a trans person was a hate crime, stated that women not disclosing their trans status were \\"taking away a person's power of choice\\" and \\"should go to jail or something\\". Hearns and her colleagues circulated a petition calling for the program to be taken off the air. On September 30 2017, Hearns spoke at The March for Black Women in Washington, D.C. about the sisterhood between transgender and cisgender black women.

The channels' brand are registered at Institut National de la Propri√©t√© Industrielle (INPI). Broadcasting Ecosystem  Content creation  The first element in the broadcasting ecosystem is the creation of audiovisual content. Broadcast content is offered to users in terms of a broadcast service, bundled and offered as a package. The major part of broadcast services are radio shows, movies, documentaries, news for radio, TV programmes, etc. However, it may also contain new types of content emerged with the advent of Internet such as websites, blogs, social media appearance. The broadcast services includes linear and nonlinear content. Linear content refers to the traditional way of offering radio or TV services with scheduled sequence of content over a certain period of time. This type of content are set up by broadcasters and cannot be changed by a listener or a viewer - the last ones can only change from one service to another or to switch off if the programme is not attractive. A live stream on the Internet is to be considered as a linear, as well. Nonlinear content are time-shifted and catch-up services available for a certain period of time. The viewer can select individual pieces of content and control the timing and the sequence of consumption. Other forms of nonlinear broadcast services encompass on demand access to audio and video content for immediate consumption and the viewer decides what to consume, where to consume it, when and on which device. Mobibase does not produce its own content but licence content rights acquired from a combination of international and local rights deals. Many major broadcasters which report under IFRS, including ITV, Channel 4, Sky, France24, TV Globo, teleSUR, RTL, Deutsche Well and Bell Media, explicitly highlight acquiring programming rights as a key driver of revenue growth. Acquired programming rights can be for single or multiple broadcasts and can have licence periods spanning away years. The agreements may also specify format (HD, 3D) and geographical rights. Programming rights agreements also cover other platforms such as desktop computer, tablet and smartphone.  Content distribution  Another important element in broadcasting ecosystem is the content distribution. Broadcasters distribute their content over several networks (terrestrial, cable, satellite, broadband networks, etc.) moving toward complete digital broadcasting. The content market is characterised by the multi-platform environment through which content is available to end users. There is a distinction between offline content (e.g. content delivered via traditional broadcasting platforms) and online content(e.g. video on demand).

Plot  It is a setting where regular people are Immortal, being able to get resurrected instantaneously. People who can die, are called \\"Vectors\\". The term Vector comes from the medical term for being a source of sickness. The condition is called RDS: Resurrection deficiency syndrome. In this world, when people get sick, they kill themselves to \\"reset\\" their biological state. People can get RDS if they fall in love with people who have RDS. People discover a person is a Vector when they refuse to get \\"reset.\\" Vectors are euthanized to prevent spreading their disease. The two main characters are a Detective named Kenzaki Shinichi and \\"The Escape Artist.\\" Kenzaki lost his sister because she fell in love with a Vector and committed suicide. The other main character, the Escape Artist, is a highly trained vector whose identity is hidden by a ribbon clipped to her hair. This ribbon makes her head a white-out to everyone else. The escape artist is just a term, and this escape artist's name is Kazama Rin, a police office clerk. The story focuses on the violent combat between Vectors and Immortals.

It was established in 1881 and was based in the Auckland suburb of Epsom. In 2004, the College of Education amalgamated with the University of Auckland, merging with the University's School of Education to form the Faculty of Education, now the Faculty of Education and Social Work. History The Auckland Training College was first established in January 1881 but closed down several years later as a result of government cost-cutting. The teachers college was re-established between 1905 and 1906. The college's Epsom campus was established in 1926 ‚Äì original building 1925 by John Farrell, demolished 1976. Duncan Rae, who had been vice-principal from 1924 to 1929, was principal from 1929 to 1947. In 1936, the college was renamed the Auckland Teachers Training College and was later renamed the Auckland Teachers College in 1948. During its early years, the college operated as a glorified secondary school for training teachers with a strong practitioner focus. In 1964, secondary school teaching was transferred to a second teacher's training college called the Auckland Post-Primary Teachers' College, which was renamed the Secondary Teachers College in 1966. During the 1970s, a more comprehensive three-year education program for training primary school teachers was introduced. The college also began to provide early childhood and secondary education courses. In 1971, the Secondary Teachers College introduced a pilot MƒÅori culture and language program, which was followed by a full-time MƒÅori language course in 1974. By 1980, the Secondary Teachers College had its own MƒÅori studies department. The Teachers College absorbed the Ardmore Teachers College (1974), Loretta Hall, Kindergarten Teachers College (1975) and North Shore Teachers College (1982). In 1986, the various early childhood, primary, and secondary education colleges merged into the Auckland College of Education. The merged college also offered courses in social work, counselling, and human services. In 1990, the Auckland College of Education introduced a three-year early childhood programme and equivalency courses which allowed those already working in the sector to upgrade to the new Diploma of Teaching. In July 1992, the College established a campus in Whangarei called the Tai Tokerau Campus or Te Kura Akoranga O Te Tai Tokerau to deal with a growing teacher shortage. In 1994, the College purchased the Alexander Street site, which could accommodate 100 students. Over the next decade, the Whangarei campus would train more than 320 early childhood and primary teachers. In 2002, the Whangarei campus began offering secondary teacher education. During the 1990s, the College established more branches at Rotorua and Kaikohe for the delivery of MƒÅori programmes and at Tokoroa for delivering Pacific Islander early childhood programs. During the 1990s, the College also established diploma programs to deal with the growing Pacific Islander population in Auckland, culminating in the creation of Faculty Pasifika in 2001. In 2002, the Auckland College of Education and the University of Auckland entered into talks regarding collaboration, culminating in a joint merge proposal to the New Zealand Government in 2003. On 29 July 2004, the Education Minister Trevor Mallard and the Associate Education Minister Steve Maharey announced that the College of Education would be merging with the University of Auckland on 1 September 2004. The two colleges merged to become the University of Auckland's Faculty of Education, which became the Faculty of Education and Social Work in 2015.

Premise  Stars in Shadow is set in a galaxy which suffered from a grand-scale war between many civilizations and alien races, the so-called 'Great War'. Before the Great War the galaxy enjoyed a golden age, but the Great War ended this period of prosperity. Three thousand years later, the galaxy is currently in the progress of rebuilding.  Gameplay  In Stars in Shadow you can play as one of seven factions. The factions consists of humans and six alien races: the Phidi, Orthin, Yoral, Ashdar and the Gremak. The goal of the game is to \\"explore the galaxy, rediscover and colonize distant worlds, and build an interstellar empire\\". Players also engage in turn-based fleet combat, a core mechanic. The 'Legacies' DLC adds an eighth playable faction, the Tinkers.  Development  Stars in Shadow was developed by Ashdar Games, a small studio consisting of programmer Sven Olsen and artist Jim Francis. Francis is responsible for the game's comic book art style. He is also known as the author and artist of the full-color web-based science fiction comic ‚ÄúOutsider‚Äù. In an interview with GameStar, Olsen named Master of Orion 2 as his main inspiration for the game. The game went in Early Access in September 2016. IndieGames.com noted its style as \\"being probably its most striking element.\\" PC Gamer reviewed the game when it entered Early Access and made note of the diversity of its playable races and the space combat gameplay, but reviewer T.J. Hafer stated that it was too early to tell if the \\"will soar above the clouds and become a respected peer in the space 4X renaissance.\\" Stars in Shadow left Early Access in January 2017, with Forbes' Erik Kain comparing its art style to Master of Orion. Logan Booker of Kotaku Australia also compared the look of the game to Master of Orion and to Star Control. In August 2017 a DLC called 'Legacies' was announced. Stars in Shadow: Legacies adds a new faction called the Tinkers, bringing the number of playable alien races from six to seven. Originally slated for a September 2017 release date, the DLC was moved to October 2017. According to the developer, this was done \\"to release a DLC that meets your expectations (and our own)\\". The Legacies DLC was released on October 19, 2017.  Reception  Stars in Shadow received a positive reception from press. The game currently holds a 75 metascore on Metacritic. Tom Chick of Quarter to Three reviewed the game with four out of five stars, praising its ability to focus on the most important aspects of 4X games. WCCFTech praised the game for its art style and \\"outstanding turn-based tactics in ship battles\\", but noticed the lack of an in-depth story. Hooked Gamers also praised the turn-based combat and its depth. Overpowered Noobs noted that the game is perfect for novices to the 4X genre.

The English Church (Englische Kirche) is a former Church of England church building in the German city of Bad Homburg in Hesse. It is listed as a historic monument and now houses a cultural centre.  History Homburg was once best known for its spa, whose guests included many tourists from England - 20% of its 8500 visitors in 1857 came from England. That percentage rose after 1876, when it became traditional for people to go to the spa after the end of the parliamentary session in Homburg. An Anglican church was first requested in the town in 1859. Ferdinand, Landgrave of Hesse-Homburg granted a site on Ferdinandsplatz (now Ferdinandstra√üe 16) in memory of the late Landgr√§fin Elizabeth, daughter of George III of the United Kingdom and Ferdinand's sister-in-law. The building was partly financed by the Blanc brothers, local hoteliers and casino-owners, and designed by the English architect Ewan Christian. as a two-storey hall church with a semi-enclosed choir and a saddleback slate roof. One of its original stained glass windows is now in the town museum at the Gothic House. It is reminiscent of an English parish church and could stylistically be called Gothic, neo-Gothic, Norman or Romanesque Revival. Construction began in 1861 and was completed in 1863 or 1865, overseen by Christian Holler (1819‚Äì1903). Originally dedicated as Christ Church, it held its first services in 1866, though the building was only officially consecrated on 2 September 1868 by Archibald Campbell Tait, bishop of London. An organ was ordered from J W Walker in London in 1866. A monument to Elizabeth was also erected in 1908 on the patch of grass along the east side of the church. There were two regular services on Sundays, along with baptisms, weddings and funerals for Anglican and Episcopalian tourists. The last service was held on 6 June 1914 and the building was seized by the town authorities and de-consecrated after the outbreak of World War One. On 19 August 1916 it reopened as the town history museum (St√§dtische Heimatmuseum), which remained there until moving to Bad Homburg Castle in 1925. The building then remained empty until being turned into a concert hall in 1946. In 1953 the town transferred the building's organ to the new Roman Catholic Heilig- Kreuz Kirche in the Gonzenheim district of Bad Homburg - it is now the only surviving 19th century English organ in Germany. The building was renovated in 1964 to host plays, lectures, conferences and exhibitions. From 1989 to 1990 a second restoration by the architect Reinhold Kargel of Darmstadt added a new foyer outside the building's west door (connected to the original via a glass corridor), using materials which matched the original building. It reopened on 14 September 1990 as a cultural centre, hosting jazz, cabaret, 'Kleinkunst' and classical concerts, lectures and exhibitions.

On that occasion, Radogost brought presents for Pope Clement III from Ban Kulin, ruler of Bosnia. The historian John Van Antwerp Fine, Jr. dismisses the chronicler Mavro Orbini's date of 1171 because there is no evidence that Kulin was already Ban of Bosnia at that time. At a time when the Papacy insisted on using Latin as the liturgical language, Radogost was noted for not knowing Latin at all, nor any other language. Thus, Radogost \\"swore the oath of faith and obedience to his metropolitan in ... the Slavic language\\". He justified his celebration of mass in Church Slavonic to his metropolitan, claiming that this was a privilege granted to his predecessors by Pope John VIII in 880. Bishop Radogost likely died in 1203; on 10 June, the papal legate John de Casamaris reported the death of the Bishop of Bosnia to Pope Innocent III. It is unknown whether he died before or after the Abjuration of Bilino Polje, whereby Kulin and his closest associates agreed on the future management of the Catholic Church in Bosnia.

One motivation for the study of locally nilpotent derivations comes from the fact that some of the counterexamples to Hilbert's 14th problem are obtained as the kernels of a derivation on a polynomial ring. Over a field k of characteristic zero, to give a locally nilpotent derivation on the integral domain A, finitely generated over the field, is equivalent to giving an action of the additive group (k,+) to the affine variety X = operatorname{Spec}(A). Roughly speaking, an affine variety admitting \\"plenty\\" of actions of the additive group is considered similar to an affine space.  Definition  Let A be a ring. Recall that a derivation of A is a map partialcolon, Ato A satisfying the Leibniz rule partial (ab)=(partial a)b+a(partial b) for any a,bin A . If A is an algebra over a field k, we additionally require partial to be k-linear, so ksubseteq ker partial. A derivation partial is called a locally nilpotent derivation (LND) if for every a in A, there exists a positive integer n such that partial^{n}(a)=0. If A is graded, we say that a locally nilpotent derivation partial is homogeneous (of degree d) if deg partial a=deg a +d for every ain A. The set of locally nilpotent derivations of a ring A is denoted by operatorname{LND}(A). Note that this set has no obvious structure: it is neither closed under addition (e.g. if partial_{1}=ytfrac{partial}{partial x}, partial_{2}=xtfrac{partial}{partial y} then partial_{1},partial_{2}in operatorname{LND}(k[x,y]) but (partial_{1}+partial_{2})^{2}(x)=x, so partial_{1}+partial_{2} otin operatorname{LND}(k[x,y])) nor under multiplication by elements of A (e.g. tfrac{partial}{partial x}in operatorname{LND}(k[x]), but xtfrac{partial}{partial x} otinoperatorname{LND}(k[x])). However, if [partial_{1},partial_{2}]=0 then partial_{1},partial_{2}in operatorname{LND}(A) implies partial_{1}+partial_{2}in operatorname{LND}(A) and if partialin operatorname{LND}(A), hinkerpartial then hpartialin operatorname{LND}(A).  Relation to mathbb{G}_{a}-actions  Let A be an algebra over a field k of characteristic zero (e.g. k=mathbb{C}). Then there is a one-to-one corresponence between the locally nilpotent k-derviations on A and the actions of the additive group mathbb{G}_{a} of k on the affine variety operatorname{Spec} A, as follows. A mathbb{G}_{a}-action on operatorname{Spec} A corresponds to an k-algebra homomorphism rhocolon Ato A[t]. Any such rho determines a locally nilpotent derivation partial of A by taking its derivative at zero, namely partial=epsilon circ tfrac{d}{dt}circ rho, where epsilon denotes the evaluation at t=0. Conversely, any locally nilpotent derivation partial determines a homomorphism rhocolon Ato A[t] by rho=exp (tpartial)=sum_{n=0}^{infty}frac{t^{n}}{n!}partial^{n}. It is easy to see that the conjugate actions correspond to conjugate derivations, i.e. if alphain operatorname{Aut} A and partialin operatorname{LND}(A) then alphacircpartial circ alpha^{-1}in operatorname{LND}(A) and exp(tcdot alphacircpartial circ alpha^{-1})=alpha circ exp(tpartial)circ alpha^{-1}  The kernel algorithm  The algebra ker partial consists of the invariants of the corresponding mathbb{G}_{a}-action. It is algebraically and factorially closed in A. A special case of Hilbert's 14th problem asks whether ker partial is finitely generated, or, if A=k[X], whether the quotient X/!/mathbb{G}_{a} is affine. By Zariski's finiteness theorem, it is true if dim Xleq 3. On the other hand, this question is highly nontrivial even for X=mathbb{C}^{n}, ngeq 4. For ngeq 5 the answer, in general, is negative. The case n=4 is open. However, in practice it often happens that kerpartial is known to be finitely generated: notably, by the Maurer- Weitzenb√∂ck theorem, it is the case for linear LND's of the polynomial algebra over a field of characteristic zero (by linear we mean homogeneous of degree zero with respect to the standard grading). Assume ker partial is finitely generated. If A=k[g_1,dots, g_n] is a finitely generated algebra over a field of characteristic zero, then kerpartial can be computed using van den Essen's algorithm, as follows. Choose a local slice, i.e. an element rin ker partial^{2}setminus ker partial and put f=partial rin kerpartial. Let pi_{r}colon, Ato (ker partial)_{f} be the Dixmier map given by pi_{r}(a)=sum_{n=0}^{infty}frac{(-1)^{n}}{n!}partial^{n}(a)frac{r^{n}}{f^{n}}. Now for every i=1,dots, n, chose a minimal integer m_{i} such that h_{i}colon = f^{m_{i}}pi_{r}(g_{i})in kerpartial, put B_{0}=k[h_{1},dots, h_{n},f]subseteq ker partial, and define inductively B_{i} to be the subring of A generated by {hin A: fhin B_{i-1}}. By induction, one proves that B_{0}subset B_{1}subset dots subsetker partial are finitely generated and if B_{i}=B_{i+1} then B_{i}=ker partial, so B_{N}=ker partial for some N. Finding the generators of each B_{i} and checking whether B_{i}=B_{i+1} is a standard computation using Gr√∂bner bases.  Slice theorem  Assume that partialinoperatorname{LND}(A) admits a slice, i.e. sin A such that partial s=1. The slice theorem asserts that A is a polynomial algebra (kerpartial) [s] and partial=tfrac{d}{ds}. For any local slice rinkerpartial setminus kerpartial^{2} we can apply the slice theorem to the localization A_{partial r}, and thus obtain that A is locally a polynomial algebra with a standard derivation. In geometric terms, if a geometric quotient picolon,Xto X//mathbb{G}_{a} is affine (e.g. when dim Xleq 3 by the Zariski theorem), then it has a Zariski-open subset U such that pi^{-1}(U) is isomorphic over U to Utimes mathbb{A}^{1}, where mathbb{G}_{a} acts by translation on the second factor. However, in general it is not true that Xto X//mathbb{G}_{a} is locally trivial. For example, let partial=utfrac{partial}{partial x}+vtfrac{partial}{partial y}+(1+uy^2)tfrac{partial}{partial z}in operatorname{LND}(mathbb{C}[x,y,z,u,v]). Then kerpartial is a coordinate ring of a singular variety, and the fibers of the quotient map over singular points are two-dimensional. If dim X=3 then Gamma=Xsetminus U is a curve. To describe the mathbb{G}_{a}-action, it is important to understand the geometry Gamma. Assume further that k=mathbb{C} and that X is smooth and contractible (in which case S is smooth and contractible as well) and choose Gamma to be minimal (with respect to inclusion). Then Kaliman proved that each irreducible component of Gamma is a polynomial curve, i.e. its normalization is isomorphic to mathbb{C}^{1}. The curve Gamma for the action given by Freudenburg's (2,5)-derivation (see below) is a union of two lines in mathbb{C}^{2}, so Gamma may not be irreducible. However, it is conjectured that Gamma is always contractible.  Examples  ;Example 1 The standard coordinate derivations tfrac{partial}{partial x_i} of a polynomial algebra k[x_1,dots, x_n] are locally nilpotent. The corresponding mathbb{G}_a- actions are translations: tcdot x_{i}=x_{i}+t, tcdot x_{j}=x_{j} for j eq i. ;Example 2 (Freudenburg's (2,5)-homogeneous derivation) Let f_1=x_1x_3-x_2^2, f_2=x_3f_1^2+2x_1^2x_2f_1+x^5, and let partial be the Jacobian derivation partial(f_{3})=det[tfrac{partial f_{i}}{partial x_{j}}]_{i,j=1,2,3}. Then partialin operatorname{LND}(k[x_1,x_2,x_3]) and operatorname{rank}partial=3 (see below); that is, partial annihilates no variable. The fixed point set of the corresponding mathbb{G}_{a}-action equals {x_1=x_2=0}. ;Example 3 Consider Sl_2(k)={ad-bc=1}subseteq k^{4}. The locally nilpotent derivation atfrac{partial}{partial b}+ctfrac{partial}{partial d} of its coordinate ring corresponds to a natural action of mathbb{G}_a on Sl_2(k) via right multiplication of upper triangular matrices. This action gives a nontrivial mathbb{G}_a-bundle over mathbb{A}^{2}setminus {(0,0)}. However, if k=mathbb{C} then this bundle is trivial in the smooth category  LND's of the polynomial algebra  Let k be a field of characteristic zero (using Kambayashi's theorem one can reduce most results to the case k=mathbb{C} ) and let A=k[x_1,dots, x_n] be a polynomial algebra.  n=2 (mathbb{G}_{a}-actions on an affine plane) ;Rentschler's theorem Every LND of k[x_1,x_2] can be conjugated to f(x_1)tfrac{partial}{partial x_2} for some f(x_1)in k[x_1]. This result is closely related to the fact that every automorphism of an affine plane is tame, and does not hold in higher dimensions.  n=3 (mathbb{G}_{a}-actions on an affine 3-space) ;Miyanishi's theorem The kernel of every nontrivial LND of A=k[x_1,x_2,x_3] is isomorphic to a polynomial ring in two variables; that is, a fixed point set of every nontrivial mathbb{G}_{a}-action on mathbb{A}^{3} is isomorphic to mathbb{A}^{2}. In other words, for every 0 eq partial in operatorname{LND}(A) there exist f_{1},f_{2}in A such that kerpartial=k[f_{1},f_{2}] (but, in contrast to the case n=2, A is not necessarily a polynomial ring over ker partial). In this case, partial is a Jacobian derivation: partial(f_{3})=det[tfrac{partial f_{i}}{partial x_{j}}]_{i,j=1,2,3}. ;Zurkowski's theorem Assume that n=3 and partialin operatorname{LND}(A) is homogeneous relative to some positive grading of A such that x_1,x_2,x_3 are homogeneous. Then kerpartial=k[f,g] for some homogeneous f,g. Moreover, if deg x_{1},deg x_{2},deg x_{3} are relatively prime, then deg f,deg g are relatively prime as well. ;Bonnet's theorem A quotient morphism mathbb{A}^{3}to mathbb{A}^{2} of a mathbb{G}_{a}-action is surjective. In other words, for every 0 eq partial in operatorname{LND}(A), the embedding kerpartialsubseteq A induces a surjective morphism operatorname{Spec}Ato operatorname{Spec}kerpartial. This is no longer true for ngeqslant 4, e.g. the image of a quotient map mathbb{A}^{4}tomathbb{A}^{3} by a mathbb{G}_{a}-action tcdot (x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)=(x_1,x_2,x_3-tx_2,x_4+tx_1) (which corresponds to a LND given by x_1tfrac{partial}{partial x_4}-x_2tfrac{partial}{partial x_3}) equals mathbb{A}^{3}setminus {(x_1,x_2,x_3): x_{1}=x_{2}=0,x_{3} eq 0}. ;Kaliman's theorem Every fixed-point free action of mathbb{G}_{a} on mathbb{A}^{3} is conjugate to a translation. In other words, every partial in operatorname{LND}(A) such that the image of partial generates the unit ideal (or, equivalently, partial defines a nowhere vanishing vector field), admits a slice. This results answers one of the conjectures from Kraft's list. Again, this result is not true for ngeqslant 4: e.g. consider the x_1tfrac{partial}{partial x_2}+ x_2tfrac{partial}{partial x_3}+(x_2^2-2x_1 x_3-1)tfrac{partial}{partial x_{4}}in operatorname{LND}(mathbb{C}[x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},x_{4}]). The points (x_1,1,0,0) and (x_1,-1,0,0) are in the same orbit of the corresponding mathbb{G}_a-action if and only if x_{1} eq 0; hence the (topological) quotient is not even Hausdorff, let alone homeomorphic to mathbb{C}^{3}. ;Principal ideal theorem Let partialinoperatorname{LND}(A). Then A is faithfully flat over kerpartial. Moreover, the ideal ker partial cap operatorname{im}partial is principal in A.  Triangular derivations  Let f_1,dots,f_n be any system of variables of A; that is, A=k[f_1,dots, f_n]. A derivation of A is called triangular with respect to this system of variables, if partial f_1in k and partial f_{i} in k[f_1,dots,f_{i-1}] for i=2,dots,n. A derivation is called triangulable if it is conjugate to a triangular one, or, equivalently, if it is triangular with respect to some system of variables. Every triangular derivation is locally nilpotent. The converse is true for leq 2 by Rentschler's theorem above, but it is not true for ngeq 3. ;Bass's example The derivation of k[x_1,x_2,x_3] given by x_1tfrac{partial}{partial x_2}+2x_2x_1tfrac{partial}{partial x_3} is not triangulable. Indeed, the fixed-point set of the corresponding mathbb{G}_{a}-action is a quadric cone x_2x_3=x_2^2, while by the result of Popov, a fixed point set of a triangulable mathbb{G}_{a}-action is isomorphic to Ztimes mathbb{A}^{1} for some affine variety Z; and thus cannot have an isolated singularity. ;Freudenburg's theorem The above necessary geometrical condition was later generalized by Freudenburg. To state his result, we need the following definition: A corank of partialin operatorname{LND}(A) is a maximal number j such that there exists a system of variables f_1,dots, f_n such that f_1,dots, f_jinkerpartial. Define operatorname{rank}partial as n minus the corank of partial. We have 1leq operatorname{rank}partial leq n and operatorname{rank}(partial)=1 if and only if in some coordinates, partial=htfrac{partial}{partial x_{n}} for some hin k[x_1,dots,x_{n-1}]. Theorem: If partialin operatorname{LND}(A) is triangulable, then any hypersurface contained in the fixed-point set of the corresponding mathbb{G}_{a}-action is isomorphic to Ztimes mathbb{A}^{operatorname{rank} partial}. In particular, LND's of maximal rank n cannot be triangulable. Such derivations do exist for ngeq 3: the first example is the (2,5)-homogeneous derivation (see above), and it can be easily generalized to any ngeq 3.  Makar-Limanov invariant  The intersection of the kernels of all locally nilpotent derivations of the coordinate ring, or, equivalently, the ring of invariants of all mathbb{G}_{a}-actions, is called \\"Makar-Limanov invariant\\" and is an important algebraic invariant of an affine variety. For example, it is trivial for an affine space; but for the Koras‚ÄìRussell cubic threefold, which is diffeomorphic to mathbb{C}^{3}, it is not.

It is ranked 36th out of 50 countries on the Voiceless Animal Cruelty Index. According to the Animal Protection Index, it has not pledged support for the Universal Declaration on Animal Welfare, there is no policy or legislation in the country preventing animal suffering by deliberate acts or negligence, and there are no animal protection laws in reference to animals used in farming. The country does have legislation on the conservation of wild animals, which also apply to animals kept in confinement. It implies a duty of care, in limited situations, but its effectiveness is hard to assess.  Red Book of Azerbaijan  Red Flamingos Lists of rare and endangered species of wild animals in Azerbaijan are drawn up in the Red Book. The Red Book is an official state document. The first edition of the document was published in 1989, and the expectation is to republish the Book in each 10 years. The Document includes information on measures to protect rare and endangered species of animals, and spread of them throughout the country, including the Caspian Sea (lake) sector belonging to Azerbaijan. The Book differentiates between rare and endangered species. The last version of Red Book published in 2013 contains information about rare and endangered 14 mammal species, 36 bird species, 5 species of fish, 13 amphibians, and reptile species, 40 insect species.  Organizations   Azerbaijan Animal Rescue Center  AARC (Azerbaijan Animal Rescue and Veterinary Care Center), the first animal protection center in Azerbaijan, has been founded by Ms. Hedieh Roshanzamir. The primary goal of AARC is to minimize street animals. The organization neutered more than 4000 animals free of charge until the end of September 2017. For spaying of animals and other medical purposes, AARC employs a specialized team of veterinary doctors and surgeons. The organization promotes the culture of animal loving and adoption, and prevents cruel and inhumane treatment against animals. AARC believes that animals need the care and attention of people as well as home, food, water and medical care.  Azerbaijan Society for the Protection of Animals  Azerbaijan Society for the Protection of Animals (ASPA) was registered by the Ministry of Justice of Azerbaijan on 20 October 1992. On November 2001, the World Society for the Protection of Animals, and on 6 February 2002, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals granted a membership to the ASPA.

April 1817 in Darmstadt), daughter of August Konrad Hofmann, later finance minister of Hesse-Darmstadt - they had five children, including August (later an officer in the Imperial Austrian Navy) and Georg Luwig (naval officer and father of the famous Trapp family). Eduard discovered the source of what is now the Elisabethenquelle in what is now the Kurpark and asked his chemist friend Justus von Liebig to test the water and confirm its healing properties. He then used lectures and science publications to promote the waters and hosted tourists to the spa in his own villa on Kaiser-Friedrich-Promenade, now a listed monument - some of the early ones included Prince William of Prussia and Augusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach in 1844. Some criticised him, but the town recognised him, making him an honorary citizen. The landgraf appointed him his personal physician, but Eduard died unexpectedly aged 49 in 1854. He was buried in the town's Protestant cemetery.  Bibliography  * Gerta Walsh: Gro√üe Namen in Bad Homburg. Frankfurt a. M. 1997. * Gerta Walsh: Bad Homburger Fassaden. Frankfurt a. M. 2002.

It comprises over 95% of the subdistrict's area and most of its population, with an area of 48.3 square km. It is the 5th largest island in the province, being far smaller than Bangka and Belitung in addition to the islands of Lepar and Mendanau. The smaller island of Celagen, off the western coast of the island, holds the remaining population of the subdistrict. Before its division in 2012, the island was part of the Lepar Pongok subdistrict. Geography The island is located approximately halfway between Bangka and Belitung, in the middle of the Gaspar Strait, resulting in it sometimes being referred to as \\"Middle Island\\". The island stretches approximately 10 km north-south and 8.5 km east-west. Several small streams flow in the island. The terrain is largely flat with little prominent elevations, the highest point on the island being only 125 m above sea level. The island is accessible by boat, with a three-hour journey from mainland Bangka. Demographics The island, as Pongok Village, has a population of 5,377 with a sex ratio of 1.14 and divided into 916 households (5.8 persons per household). Economy and administration The island is part of the Pongok Village in the subdistrict, and is further subdivided into 7 hamlets (dusun). A solar power plant with a peak capacity of 125 kilowatts was established on the island in 2015. A stark majority of the labor force are engaged in fisheries and agriculture, with a fish production of about 6,850 tonnes throughout 2016. Several public-funded schools are present on the island, ranging from kindergarten (TK) to senior high school (SMA).

She is a Trustee of the MOA and an Honorary Professor of History at the University of Sussex.  Personal life and early studies  Dorothy Elizabeth Sheridan was born in Galway, on the west coast of Ireland, but moved to the Yorkshire Dales when she was two with her parents, John J Sheridan and Moyra F Sheridan. She grew up there in cottages with outside toilets and no running water. Her parents were active campaigners in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and took Sheridan to demonstrations and protests. Sheridan attended Harrogate Grammar School (1959 until 1964), Beverley High School for Girls (1964-1966) and Hull College of Commerce (1966-7). She obtained eight O-levels and four A-levels. She then went to Brighton in 1967, where she studied Sociology in the School of Education at the University of Sussex. Sheridan married psychologist and fellow socialist, Anthony Wainwright, in Lewes, East Sussex, in 1968. Their son, Luke Anthony, was born in Edinburgh in 1972. She married Barry Stierer in 1996.  Mass Observation Archive  Tom Harrisson offered Sheridan a temporary job in 1974, working to establish the Mass Observation papers as a history resource. This job became permanent, with Sheridan acting as the first archivist. She performed a variety of jobs there, beginning by labelling boxes and telephoning Harrisson with updates and moving on to develop and promote the archive. In 1976, Harrisson had given her money to buy a car and learn to drive so that she could chauffeur him when he visited, but he died before this happened so she purchased a motorbike instead. In 1981, Sheridan co-founded the launch of the contemporary phase of Mass Observation, the Mass Observation Project that collects new material about everyday life. She combined the management of the MOA with research, writing and publishing, and travelled extensively to promote Mass Observation, autobiographical writing and ethical archiving. Sheridan became Director of the MOA in 1990. She acted as researcher and consultant on the digital resources developing from the archive, and had to adjust to tasks such as electronic research support within the University of Sussex, which took her away from her main interests in life history research and archiving. In 2010, Sheridan retired from her role as Director, but continued her involvement as a Trustee of the MOA.  Publications  Sheridan has written and co-authored a number of books, largely involving Mass Observation materials. * Speak for Yourself: Mass Observation Anthology, 1937-49 (with Angus Calder, 1984). * Among You Taking Notes (1985). * Mass Observation at the Movies (1987). * Wartime Women: A Mass Observation Anthology (1990). * Writing Ourselves: Mass-Observation and Literacy Practices (with Brian Street & David Bloome, 2000). * \\"The Mass Observation Archive: A History\\", Mass Observation Online (2009).  Other roles and activities since 2010  Sheridan became the Head of Special Collections at Sussex in 2000, working in this role until retiring in 2008. Sheridan is an advisor to the National Life Stories project at the British Library and acted as consultant on the \\"Observing the Eighties\\" project, which brought together materials from the Life Stories and MOA. Sheridan was a member of the management committee of community publishing group QueenSpark Books between 1996 and 2010, and continues to be involved in their work as a patron. In her retirement Sheridan has developed her political interests, continuing in her solidarity work for Palestine which began after a first visit to Palestine in 2004. She remains a committed and active socialist and feminist. In 2016, Sheridan obtained a qualification in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) and has re-directed her interest in language and life stories towards working with migrants and refugees. She teaches English in Brighton at the Migrant English Project. She is also a member of the Gatwick Detainees Welfare Group and visits people on immigration detention at the Gatwick Immigration Removal Centre.  Honours and awards  Sheridan received an MBE in 1991. She was also elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. The Open University awarded Sheridan an honorary doctorate, which she described as her \\"career high\\" in 2007. In 2011, the University of Sussex made Sheridan a 50th Anniversary Fellow. She is also an Honorary Professor at the University, where she co-founded the Life History Research Centre. Sheridan is Visiting Professor at the University of Brighton, where she is on the advisory board of the Centre for Memory, History and Narratives.

The album was released on via Heads Up International label. Reception Brian Soergel of Jazz Times mentioned \\"Revival continues the paradigm established long ago: Take a couple of nice instrumentals, mix in a traditional song or two and add a few tracks addressing social concerns. But Masekela‚Äôs flugelhorn talent is so vast that it‚Äôs a shame that he can‚Äôt figure out a way to offer a CD that connects with his jazz roots, a la Chris Botti‚Äôs When I Fall in Love.\\" Jim Santella of All About Jazz wrote \\"Throughout much of the album, however, the trumpeter's tone and emphasis remain weak. His vocalist guests take center stage, as Masekela weaves in cornet and flugelhorn melodies behind them. The full force of his flugelhorn tone remains hidden and a bit off the mark. This revival of South African music does not revive his tone and technique. Nor does his singing add anything musical to the tour. Nevertheless, Masekela's heartstrings are showing, and you can't help but love the warmth that he endows on his country's cultural change.\\" Track listing Personnel *Hugh Masekela ‚Äì vocals, flugelhorn, keyboards *Malaika ‚Äì vocals *Zwai Bala ‚Äì vocals *Corlea ‚Äì vocals *Jimmy Dludlu ‚Äì guitar *John Selolwane ‚Äì guitar *Themba Mokeona ‚Äì guitar *Lawrence Matshiza ‚Äì guitar *Khaya Mahlangu ‚Äì flute, tenor saxophone *Moses Khumalo ‚Äì alto saxophone *Godfrey Pilane ‚Äì keyboards *Ezbie Moilwa - Keyboards *Ngoako Manamela ‚Äì vibraphone *Lucas Senyatso ‚Äì bass guitar *Sello Montwedi ‚Äì drums *Francis Fuster ‚Äì percussion References External links * 2005 albums Hugh Masekela albums ","title":"Revival (Hugh Masekela album)"},{"id":"55427292","text":"The FIBA Oceania Championship for Women 1993 was the qualifying tournament of FIBA Oceania for the 1994 FIBA World Championship for Women.

Life Ferdinand on the Landgrafendenkmal monument on the Tannenwaldallee Coin of Ferdinand He was born in Bad Homburg vor der H√∂he in 1783, the fifth of six sons born to Frederick V, Landgrave of Hesse-Homburg and his wife Caroline, eldest daughter of Louis IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt and his wife Caroline. From 1800 to 1817 he served in the Karl von Lothringen Regiment, a hussar unit in the Austrian Imperial Army. Contemporary reports stated he had \\"the ideal form of a heavy cavalryman\\". He fought in all the major engagements of the Napoleonic Wars and was badly wounded several times. After the battle of Leipzig Francis II granted him the Order of Maria Theresa, the highest Austrian military order. Jaromir Hirtenfeld: Der Milit√§r-Maria-Theresien-Orden und seine Mitglieder, Wien 1857, S. 1222‚Äì1223 In 1822 he left active service with the rank of General of Cavalry (Feldzeugmeister). He never married and according to Herbert Rosendorfer became \\"very old and very reactionary\\". He lived with his personal bodyguard or leibj√§ger in the Orangery, a modest lodge adjoining Bad Homburg Castle, where he devoted himself to his two main hobbies, hunting and the Romano-German era of the Taunus. After the deaths of his four elder brothers without surviving male issue, he inherited the landgraviate from his brother Gustav in 1848 (Gustav's only son Frederick had predeceased him earlier that year). However, his lack of any male relations or issue made it clear that he would be the last landgraf of Hesse-Homburg even before his accession ‚Äì his only younger brother, Leopold, had been killed in 1813. He extended his personal extreme frugality to the parlous state finances in a vain attempt to regain control ‚Äì they had largely been ruined by his brother Philipp's granting a concession for a casino to the Blanc brothers. The Revolutions of 1848 had a major impact even on so small a state as Hesse- Homburg and thus Ferdinand set up a state convention or 'landtag' in April 1849. He also re-confirmed the constitution accepted by Gustav, though he revoked it on 20 April 1852 at the end of the German National Parliament and reinstated authoritarian personal rule until his death. In September 1850 he was one of the first princes to send representatives to the restored Federal Convention. He died without issue in Bad Homburg in 1866 ‚Äì his remains filled the last space in the vault at Bad Homburg Castle and Hesse-Homburg was briefly inherited by Louis III, Grand Duke of Hesse, before being annexed by Prussia later in 1866 after the Austro-Prussian War.

He was instrumental in installing Emperor Lizong on the throne, despite the fact that Lizong was not in the line of succession. Under Lizong's rule, Shi was appointed Grand Chancellor. Shi was from a family of bureaucrats and was skilled in politics. He took the Imperial examinations at the age of only seventeen, and placed first in his class. After the dismissal of Han Tuozhou as Chief Councillor, Shi was appointed to the position in 1208 (a number of historians accuse Shi of orchestrating Han's murder). Once in power, he reversed many of Han's policies, making peace with the Jin and revoking proscriptions against the Neo-Confucianism of Zhu Xi, although he still did not allow adherents of Zhu Xi's theories any great political power. He generally promoted officials on merit and was able to restore a degree of stability to government. Imperial succession When the Emperor Ningzong died in 1224, the succession wasn't known as Ningzong had not designated an heir. Ningzong's eldest son had died in 1197 and all of his other sons were dead too so the appointed heir was therefore adopted (the crown prince in 1224 was actually the third boy Ningzong had adopted for the role). Shi moved to place Zhao Yun (a minor imperial prince) on the throne ahead of the heir apparent. In some histories, it is suggested that Shi placed a lute-playing courtesan in the crown prince's company, and through her learned of the heir apparent's plot to remove Shi from power after attaining the throne. In changing the order of succession, he had the unwilling support of Empress Yang, who was initially against the plot but was forced to assist after Shi threatened to exterminate her clan. She forged an edict appointing Zhao Yun as heir, and he was crowned as the Emperor Lizong. Shi Miyuan died in office in 1233 and was succeeded by Ding Daquan.

Kingdom of Yugoslavia A Yugoslavia line-up in the 1930 FIFA World Cup The first national team was in the kingdom that existed between the two world wars. The Football Federation of what was then the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was founded in Zagreb in 1919 under the name Jugoslovenski nogometni savez (and admitted into FIFA), and the national team played its first international game at the Summer Olympics in Antwerp in 1920. The opponent was Czechoslovakia, and the historic starting eleven that represented Kingdom of SCS on its debut were: Dragutin Vrƒëuka, Vjekoslav ≈Ωupanƒçiƒá, Jaroslav ≈†ifer, Stanko Tavƒçar, Slavin Cindriƒá, Rudolf Rupec, Dragutin Vrag and Jovan Ru≈æiƒá. They lost by a large margin, 0‚Äì7, but nonetheless entered their names in the history books. 1930 World Cup In 1929, the country was renamed to Yugoslavia and the football association became Fudbalski Savez Jugoslavije and moved its headquarters to Belgrade. The national team participated at the 1930 FIFA World Cup, finishing in fourth place. In its first ever World Cup match in Montevideo's Parque Central, Yugoslavia managed a famous 2‚Äì1 win versus mighty Brazil, with the following starting eleven representing the country: Milovan Jak≈°iƒá, Branislav Sekuliƒá, Aleksandar Tirnaniƒá, Milutin Ivkoviƒá, Ivica Bek, Momƒçilo ƒêokiƒá, Blagoje Marjanoviƒá, Milorad Arsenijeviƒá, ƒêorƒëe Vujadinoviƒá, Dragoslav Mihajloviƒá, and Ljubi≈°a Stefanoviƒá. The national team consisted of players based in Serbian football clubs, while the Zagreb Subassociation forbid players from Croatian clubs to play in the World Cup due to the relocation of the football association's headquarters from Zagreb to Belgrade.History at Football Association of Serbia official website, retrieved 17-5-2913 Socialist Yugoslavia The federation and football overall was disrupted by World War II. After the war, a socialist federation was formed and the football federation reconstituted. Silver Medal at 1948 and 1952 Olympics Yugoslavia begin their football campaign by defeating Luxembourg 6‚Äì1, with five different players scoring the goals. In the quarter-finals and the semi- finals, they would take out Turkey and Great Britain by the same score of 3‚Äì1. In the final though, they would lose to Sweden. Having a team with many players from the 1948 generation, Yugoslavia was a formidable side at the 1952 Summer Olympics and finished as runners-up behind the legendary Hungary national team. Against the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia was 5‚Äì1 up with 15 minutes of their first round match to go. The Yugoslavs, understandably, put their feet up. Arthur Ellis, the match referee, recorded what happened next in his book, The Final Whistle (London, 1963): \\"The USSR forced the most honourable draw ever recorded! [Vsevolod] Bobrov, their captain, scored a magnificent hat-trick. After the Soviet Union had reduced the lead to 5‚Äì2, he, almost single-handed, took the score to 5‚Äì5, scoring his third in the last minute. For once, use of the word sensational was justified.\\" Although Bobrov's early goal in their replay presaged a miraculous recovery, Yugoslavia recovered sufficiently to put out their opponents easily in the second half. 1960s through 1980s Yugoslavia organized the 1976 European Championship played in Belgrade and Zagreb. The national team participated in eight World Cups and four Euros, and won the Olympic football tournament in 1960 at the Summer Games (they also finished second three times and third once). Dissolution of Yugoslavia and UN sanctions With the end of the Cold War, democratic principles were introduced to the country which brought about the end of Titoist rule. In the subsequent atmosphere, national tensions were heightened. At the Yugoslavia-Netherlands friendly in preparation for the 1990 World Cup, the Croatian crowd in Zagreb jeered the Yugoslav team and anthem and waved Dutch flags (owing to its resemblance to the Croatian tricolour). With the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the team split up and the remaining team of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) was banned from competing at Euro 92. The decision was made on 31 May 1992, just ten days before the competition commenced. They had finished top of their qualifying group, but were unable to play in the competition due to United Nations Security Council Resolution 757. Their place was taken by Denmark, who went on to win the competition. Yugoslavia had also been drawn as the top seed in Group 5 of the European Zone in the qualifying tournament for the 1994 World Cup. FRY was barred from competing, rendering the group unusually weak. Serbia and Montenegro 1998 World Cup Although the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, consisting of Serbia and Montenegro, was formed on 27 April 1992, its teams were banned from all international sporting events, including the national football team. Consequently, the national team did not play its first game as a new country before 23 December 1994, a friendly match played in Porto Alegre and in which Brazil won by the mark of 2‚Äì0. This was the first ever team composed of Serbian and Montenegrin players exclusively, while Slobodan Santraƒç, a former Yugoslavia national team player, was named the team's first ever manager. The next game was played only three days later, this time in Buenos Aires, resulting in 1‚Äì0 loss to Argentina. Despite two losses in two games, the team was honoured to play its first two games ever against such football powerhouses. Also due to the United Nations international sanctions, the team could not participate in 1994 World Cup qualifying nor the Euro 1996 qualifying process. On 31 March 1995, the team recorded its first official win in history, a 1‚Äì0 friendly against Uruguay, simultaneously marking the team's first ever home game, played at Stadion Crvena Zvezda in Belgrade, and the first ever goal scored, courtesy of Savo Milo≈°eviƒá. Slightly more than one year later, the team recorded its first ever win in a World Cup qualifying tournament in its first game in such a tournament, a 3‚Äì1 win over the Faroe Islands. Shortly after, the team also recorded its biggest win in history, once again against the Faroe Islands, 8‚Äì1. Yugoslavia finished second in Group 6, just behind Spain, meaning it had to go through the play-off system in order to qualify. Yugoslavia was paired up with Hungary, and what was believed would be a tough matchup turned out to be an easy win for Yugoslavia, 7‚Äì1 in Budapest and 5‚Äì0 in Belgrade, for an aggregate score of 12‚Äì1. This was enough to secure Yugoslavia its first ever World Cup appearance as a new country. The 1998 World Cup seeding had Yugoslavia ranked in 21st position, but the Yugoslavia national team went to France as one of the shadow favorites for the World Cup. The New York Times stated that Yugoslavia could easily be a semi- finalist in that year's World Cup. The justification for such an estimation was partially found in the names of the Yugoslav players, members of great European teams and proven footballers. The draw put the team in Group F alongside Germany, the United States, and Iran. Yugoslavia won its first game 1‚Äì0 against Iran thanks to a goal from defender Sini≈°a Mihajloviƒá. The next game was a draw for Yugoslavia. After leading Germany 2‚Äì0, last game's hero, Mihajloviƒá, scored an unlucky own goal following a German freekick, and Oliver Bierhoff equalised at 2‚Äì2 with only about ten minutes to the match. Nonetheless, Yugoslavia responded in the next game against the United States and won 1‚Äì0 due to an early goal in Nantes. Yugoslavia made easy work of Group 6, but despite an excellent record, the game against Germany would prove costly as Germany won the group thanks to a better goal difference. Due to their second position, Yugoslavia saw itself face the Netherlands in the Round of 16. Yugoslavia entered in the match with a sole attacker, but its defensive tactics proved unsuccessful as Dennis Bergkamp put the Netherlands in front in the 38th minute. Immediately following the start of the second half, Yugoslavia pressured the Dutch, who inevitably conceded a header from Slobodan Komljenoviƒá. However, the turning point of this match was a penalty awarded to Yugoslavia after Vladimir Jugoviƒá was fouled in the penalty area. Predrag Mijatoviƒá's shot dazzled Edwin van der Sar, but not the crossbar, and the scoreline remained the same at 1‚Äì1. Such an event demoralized the Yugoslavs, as the Dutch took the initiative. In the late seconds of the game, as everybody was preparing for extra time, Edgar Davids' shot towards the Yugoslav net from a distance of 20 meters and beat goalkeeper Ivica Kralj, to the pure disbelief of the Yugoslav players and fans. This marked the end of Yugoslavia's run in the 1998 World Cup, since there was not much time left to do anything. Unlucky events forced Yugoslavia out of the tournament, but the team definitely demonstrated its great ability and proved it had a spot among the world's best teams. This was also reflected in the FIFA World Rankings following the 1998 FIFA World Cup, in which Yugoslavia was constantly ranked in the Top 10 for a long period of time. Euro 2000 The draw for the Euro 2000 qualifiers saw many eyebrows raised as first-seeded Yugoslavia was drawn in a group with Croatia, thus marking the first games between the two teams after the breakup of Yugoslavia. The other teams in the group were the Republic of Ireland, Macedonia, and Malta. When the qualifiers began, the coach was Milan ≈Ωivadinoviƒá, but in July 1999 he resigned and was replaced by Vujadin Bo≈°kov. The team started with a 1‚Äì0 win over Ireland in Belgrade, before beating Malta 3‚Äì0 in Ta' Qali. The home fixture against the Maltese followed, but was moved to Thessaloniki, Greece due to the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. The team nonetheless won 4‚Äì1. The first, highly anticipated match against Croatia took place in Belgrade shortly after the bombing ended, and was interrupted due to a power outage at the beginning of the second half, resuming after 43 minuteshttp://www.arhiva.serbia.gov.rs/news/1999-08/19/13984.html and eventually finishing 0‚Äì0. A 2‚Äì1 defeat against Ireland in Dublin was followed by victories home and away against Macedonia (3‚Äì1 and 4‚Äì2 respectively), meaning that Yugoslavia needed to win its final qualifier against Croatia in Zagreb, or to draw with Ireland failing to beat Macedonia in Skopje, in order to qualify automatically for Euro 2000. In the event, Ireland conceded an injury-time equaliser, meaning that Yugoslavia's 2‚Äì2 draw with the Croatians was good enough. The draw for the finals placed Yugoslavia in Group C along with Spain, Norway and another former Yugoslav republic, Slovenia. The Slovenians took a surprise 3‚Äì0 lead in the first game at the Stade du Pays de Charleroi, but three goals in six second-half minutes enabled Yugoslavia to secure a 3‚Äì3 draw. The team then beat Norway 1‚Äì0 in Li√®ge, thanks to an early Savo Milo≈°eviƒá backheel strike. The final group game, against Spain in Bruges, saw the Yugoslavs take the lead three times, before a Gaizka Mendieta penalty and an Alfonso strike in injury-time secured a dramatic 4‚Äì3 win for the Spaniards and top spot in the group. Yugoslavia nonetheless finished second, level on points with Norway but ranked ahead due to its victory in Li√®ge. In each of the three games, the team had one player sent off (Sini≈°a Mihajloviƒá, Mateja Ke≈æman, and Slavi≈°a Jokanoviƒá, respectively). In the quarter-finals, Yugoslavia was once again paired with the Netherlands. Unlike the last time, the co-hosts made easy work of Yugoslavia, winning 6‚Äì1 in Rotterdam with Patrick Kluivert scoring a hat-trick. One of the few bright spots of Yugoslav team in the whole tournament was Savo Milo≈°eviƒá, who was crowned the joint top scorer of the tournament, alongside Patrick Kluivert. Both players scored five goals, although Milo≈°eviƒá played one game fewer. 2002 World Cup campaign The 2002 qualifiers marked the first time that Yugoslavia failed to reach a major tournament ever since its return to the big stage after the UN sanctions. The problems started with the major political turmoil in the country as well in the Yugoslav FA, which prompted the new coach Ilija Petkoviƒá to resign only after one game (2‚Äì0 away victory against Luxembourg). Milovan ƒêoriƒá took over the team, but under his leadership, the team managed only two draws (1‚Äì1 at home vs. Switzerland and also 1‚Äì1 away in Slovenia, in both games the opponents managed to equalise in late stages of the game) and a 0‚Äì1 home loss to Russia (which marked the team's first home defeat in official matches). After √êoriƒá's resignation, a three-man commission, consisting of Dejan Saviƒáeviƒá, Vujadin Bo≈°kov, and Ivan ƒÜurkoviƒá, took over the coaching duties, until Saviƒáeviƒá ultimately took over on his own. The team managed to bounce back with a draw in Russia and a win in Switzerland, but failed to defeat Slovenia in the penultimate game, thus ended the qualifiers in third position. 2006 World Cup Serbia and Montenegro and Cote d'Ivoire playing in the Allianz Arena at the 2006 FIFA World Cup Bosnia and Herzegovina in qualifiers for 2006 World Cup After Saviƒáeviƒá's disastrous spell as coach of Yugoslavia, the country went under a political transformation, and Ilija Petkoviƒá became the newly named Serbia and Montenegro's new coach. Initially, the team under his lead experienced dragging failure in the Euro 2004 qualifiers while competing for the first time as Serbia and Montenegro. Despite drawing both games against group favorites and eventual group winners Italy and winning both games against runners-up Wales, Serbia and Montenegro failed to qualify, mostly due to an embarrassing 2‚Äì2 home draw and 2‚Äì1 away loss to Azerbaijan. Qualifying for the 2006 World Cup, however, was different. Serbia and Montenegro began the campaign by finishing first with an undefeated record in their qualification group ahead of favourites Spain. The Serbia and Montenegro team also allowed only one goal in the ten matches, the best defensive record of all 51 teams participating in qualification. For the 2006 qualifiers, Serbia and Montenegro was drawn in a group with Spain, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Lithuania and San Marino. Led once again by Ilija Petkoviƒá as coach, Serbia and Montenegro played some impressive defensive football‚Äîthe \\"Famous Four\\" defense, consisting of Nemanja Vidiƒá, Mladen Krstajiƒá, Goran Gavranƒçiƒá, and Ivica Dragutinoviƒá, with Dragoslav Jevriƒá as goalkeeper, conceded only one goal in ten games, finishing first with a 6‚Äì4‚Äì0 record, ahead of Spain. On 3 June 2006, following a referendum, Montenegro declared its independence from Serbia. As the World Cup was about to start, it was decided that the Serbia and Montenegro team that had qualified for the tournament would compete, with the split into separate teams representing the new countries of Montenegro and Serbia to take place once the team was no longer in the tournament. In the group stage, Serbia and Montenegro lost their opening game to joint group favourite, the Netherlands. The final score was 1‚Äì0 after Arjen Robben scored the only goal of the game. They also lost their second game to Argentina 6‚Äì0, Serbia and Montenegro's worst ever international result. With the team's two losses and with Netherlands and Argentina winning both their games, Serbia and Montenegro could no longer qualify for the knockout matches, and was playing for pride alone in their final group game against Ivory Coast. Despite having a 2‚Äì0 lead for much of the first half, the Elephants managed to come back and win 3‚Äì2, leaving Serbia and Montenegro with a disappointing 0‚Äì0‚Äì3 World Cup run. Serbia After Montenegro declared independence, Serbia marked independence with a 3‚Äì1 away victory over the Czech Republic. Danko Lazoviƒá's, Marko Panteliƒá's and Aleksandar Tri≈°oviƒá's goals led Serbia to victory on this match. UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Serbia against Belgium, on 7 October 2006 The 2008 UEFA European Football Championship qualifying campaign began with a 1‚Äì0 victory over Azerbaijan by Nikola ≈Ωigiƒá's goal in the 72nd minute on 6 September 2006. Four days later, Serbia drew with Poland 1‚Äì1. Serbia made a two victories in October: 1‚Äì0 over Belgium and 3‚Äì0 over Armenia. In 6 matches, Serbia stayed undefeated in 2006 (4 victories, 2 draws). In the first qualifying match in 2007, Serbia unexpectedly lost 1‚Äì2 from Kazakhstan in Almaty, and four days later (28 March 2007) made a draw in front of 52,000 fans at Rajko Mitiƒá Stadium against Portugal. On 2 June 2007, Serbia made a 2‚Äì0 victory over Finland in Helsinki. In August, he lost from Belgium 2‚Äì3 away, Zdravko Kuzmanoviƒá scored (his first) two goals. After a three draws, Serbia demolished Azerbaijan with 6‚Äì1 in Baku. On 21 November 2007, Serbia draw 2‚Äì2 at home with Poland in the front of 3,000 fans. Three days later, with a low attendance (less than 1,000) at Partizan Stadium, Serbia defeated Kazakhstan by own goal in the 79th minute in the last match of this qualifying cycle. Serbia finished third, three points behind runners-up Portugal and Group A winners Poland. Serbia's first ever foreign coach Javier Clemente was sacked after the failure. Golden years (2008‚Äì2010) Atmosphere at the start of match vs. France, 9 September 2009 Serbia replaced Clemente with Miroslav ƒêukiƒá, but he left the position on 19 August of the following year without having played any official games. Subsequent to √êukiƒá's rapid departure, who led Serbia on five friendly matches and made three defeats and two draws, Radomir Antiƒá was appointed coach. Serbia's World Cup qualification campaign began on 6 September 2008. Serbia defeated Faroe Islands, by own goal in 30th minute and Nikola ≈Ωigiƒá's goal in 88th minute. Four days later, Serbia lost from 2006 FIFA World Cup runners-up France 1‚Äì2 on Stade de France. A month later, Serbia defeated Lithuania 3‚Äì0 with the goals scored by Branislav Ivanoviƒá Milo≈° Krasiƒá and Nikola ≈Ωigiƒá. On 15 October 2008, Serbia broken Austria 3‚Äì1 in Vienna in the front of 48,000 fans. Krasiƒá, Milan Jovanoviƒá and Ivan Obradoviƒá scored goals for 9 minutes (15th, 18th and 24th). By the end of the year, Serbia played one match in November and one in December. First, in November, Serbia demolish Bulgaria 6‚Äì1 in Belgrade. Savo Milo≈°eviƒá, the second top goalscorer of all time in Serbia national team, scored twice and missed two penalties in his last match for national team. Serbia lost against Poland in Antalya, in December 0‚Äì1. In first match in 2009, Serbia made a huge victory over Romania in Constan≈£a. Romania not defeated in Constan≈£a seven years, before this match. On 6 June 2009, Serbia defeated Austria 1‚Äì0 in the front of 52,000 fans at Rajko Mitiƒá Stadium. Nenad Milija≈° scored the only goal, in 7th minute, from penalty spot. Four days later, Serbia made an expected victory (2‚Äì0) over Faroe Islands in T√≥rshavn. On 9 September 2009, Serbia draw 1‚Äì1 with world runners-up, France in the front of almost 50,000 fans. Nenad Milija≈° scored the only goal for Eagles, in 12th minute, from penalty spot, like against Austria three monts before. On 10 October 2009, Serbia made a huge victory 5‚Äì0 against Romania and secured placement at 2010 FIFA World Cup. In last match of this qualifying cycle, Lithuania defeated Serbia 2‚Äì1 in Marijampolƒó. In November, Serbia defeat Northern Ireland and South Korea in Belfast and London, 1‚Äì0 both matches. Serbia vs. Ghana, 13 June 2010 Serbia placed into Group D with Germany, team also faced 2010 Africa Cup of Nations runners-up Ghana, and Australia. Their opening group game was against Ghana and chances came to both sides but a red card to Aleksandar Lukoviƒá and a handball by substitute Zdravko Kuzmanoviƒá in the second half gave Ghana a penalty to take all three points at the death. Asamoah Gyan converted eight minutes from full-time and Serbia were defeated 1‚Äì0. In Serbia's second group match, they sensationally defeated Germany by a score of 1‚Äì0 with an acrobatic goal by Milan Jovanoviƒá late in the first half. FIFA's official YouTube channel called the win \\"the most famous day in Serbia's footballing history\\". Serbia only needed a single point to reach the knockout stages but were defeated by Australia 2‚Äì1 in an entertaining match where Serbia's dominance in the first half and in periods of the second half would have made it look like a Serbia victory. Australia scored 2 goals in the second half through Tim Cahill and Brett Holman. A late Marko Panteliƒá goal served only as a consolation. They finished last in the group. Disappointing qualifications (2011‚Äì2016) After game against Australia and elimination from World Cup, Serbia start 2012 UEFA European Football Championship qualifying campaign. The qualifying stage began with Radomir Antiƒá as coach and finished with Vladimir Petroviƒá. Serbia and Antiƒá started the first two games positively with a 3‚Äì0 win away to Faroe Islands and a 1‚Äì1 draw at home to Slovenia but this result brought the end of Antiƒá's reign as the country's coach. New coach Petroviƒá faced setbacks immediately with an embarrassing 3‚Äì1 loss at home to Estonia and an abandoned match resulting in a 3‚Äì0 loss to Italy due to crowd trouble from the Serbian away supporters in Genoa. Serbia returned to form with a 2‚Äì1 win at home over Northern Ireland but could only manage a 1‚Äì1 draw away to Estonia. Afterwards, Serbia won back to back games with a 1‚Äì0 win away to Northern Ireland and a crucial 3‚Äì1 win at home against Faroe Islands. These results put Serbia in pole position to confirm a play-off spot behind Italy. Serbia needed a win at home against Italy to confirm a play-off spot but their efforts only resulted in a 1‚Äì1 draw. The team, however, still had one more chance to confirm a play- off place when they faced Slovenia away. This game was a must win even though Serbia had a superior goal difference over Estonia, a draw was not good enough for progression. Serbia played positively and created a number of chances during the game but a long-range goal put Slovenia up 1‚Äì0 at half time. The Serbians then failed to convert numerous chances that they had in the second half, notably Nemanja Vidiƒá's penalty miss midway through the second half. Serbia left empty handed after a 1‚Äì0 loss and exited the tournament for the third time in a row during the qualifying group stages, missing out by one point behind Estonia. Vladimir Petroviƒá was sacked after the team's failure to qualify. Serbia vs. Belgium, Dejan Stankoviƒá and Nemanja Vidiƒá announced that they were retiring from international football. This meant that Serbia had lost two key players and that a new era had started. Branislav Ivanoviƒá became the new captain. Sini≈°a Mihajloviƒá, a former member of the national team, was appointed as the coach on 24 April 2012. Serbia was drawn in Group A in qualification for 2014 FIFA World Cup, together with Croatia, Belgium, Scotland, Macedonia, and Wales. The team began the qualification campaign with a goalless draw with Scotland in Glasgow and a 6‚Äì1 win over Wales in Novi Sad. In the next two games, Serbia suffered two defeats, from Macedonia in (0‚Äì1) and Belgium in Belgrade (0‚Äì3). In 2013, on 22 March, Serbia played in Zagreb against Croatia. The game was highly anticipated in both countries due to their rivalry both on and off the pitch. Croatia won 2‚Äì0 and sent Serbia down on the table. Serbia then defeated Scotland 2‚Äì0 at home in a crucial qualifier, though their World Cup hopes were taken away after a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Belgium. Serbia drew with Croatia 1‚Äì1 in the corresponding fixture at home in a spiteful affair, where 18-year-old Aleksandar Mitroviƒá scored an equalizer in the second-half after Mario Mand≈æukiƒá opened the scoring. They then defeated Wales 0‚Äì3 in Cardiff. Dejan Stankoviƒá's farewell game was completed in a friendly against Japan, which Serbia won 2‚Äì0. He finished his career with 103 appearances for the national team, a record previously held by Savo Milo≈°eviƒá, with 102 appearances. Serbia finished qualifying with a 5‚Äì1 home win against Macedonia, putting them in third in the group, three points from a playoff spot behind Croatia and group winners Belgium. Dutch Dick Advocaat was appointed as the coach in July 2014. Serbia was drawn in Group I in qualification for UEFA Euro 2016, together with Portugal, Denmark, Albania and Armenia. Advocaat started with a draw in a friendly 1‚Äì1 game against France. The team began qualification with a 1‚Äì1 draw against Armenia in Yerevan. In the next abandoned game against Albania in Belgrade, Serbia was originally awarded with a 3‚Äì0 victory, but was later deducted three points. On 14 November 2014, Serbia played against Denmark in Belgrade and lost, 1‚Äì3. After this game, Advocaat left, whereupon Radovan ƒÜurƒçiƒá was announced as a new coach on 18 November. In 2015, Serbia's first match was a qualifying match against Portugal in Lisbon, during which Serbia lost 2‚Äì1, cutting their chances for qualification to Euro 2016. On 13 June 2015, Serbia played a qualifying match against Denmark in Copenhagen, losing 2‚Äì0. On 10 July, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) announced that it had awarded a 0‚Äì3 victory to Albania in the abandoned match held on 14 October 2014, upholding Serbia's three-point penalization. As a result, Serbia became mathematically eliminated from Euro 2016 qualification. On 4 September 2015, Serbia reached first victory in these qualifications, 2‚Äì0 over Armenia. On 8 October, Serbia made a huge victory over rival Albania in Elbasan. Aleksandar Kolarov's and Adem Ljajiƒá's goals in 91st and 94th minute led Serbia to the victory. In the table of Group I, Serbia finished second to last place with four points in a five team group. The return Serbia - Georgia 1‚Äì0, World Cup 2018 qualification match at Red Star Stadium In first match for 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification, Serbia started off their campaign with a 2‚Äì2 draw against Ireland at the Rajko Mitic Stadium. Republic of Ireland take the lead in 3rd minute. The Eagles equalized by Filip Kostiƒá's goal in 62nd minute and seven minutes later take the lead after Du≈°an Tadiƒá successfully completed the penalty. Conceded goal in 80th minute has costed Serbia three points. One month later, Serbia made a first victory, over Moldova in Chi»ôinƒÉu. Filip Kostiƒá scored first goal on the match again, this time in 19th minute. Captain Branislav Ivanoviƒá scored in 37th minute. Du≈°an Tadiƒá scored in 59th minute and with one goal and two assists helped Serbia to beat Moldova 3‚Äì0. Three days later, on 9 October 2016, Serbia defeated Austria (3‚Äì2) at Rajko Mitiƒá Stadium and made very important victory. Brace from Aleksandar Mitroviƒá in 6th and 23rd minute and Du≈°an Tadiƒá's in 74th minute masterpiece helped Serbia to win the match. On 12 November 2016, Aleksandar Mitroviƒá's goal in 86th minute, helped Serbia to take a point against Euro 2016 semi-finalists, Wales in Cardiff. On 24 March, in first match in 2017, Serbia defeat 3‚Äì1 Georgia in Tbilisi. Du≈°an Tadiƒá scored the equalizer, from penalty spot in 44th minute. Aleksandar Mitroviƒá with beautiful goal give Serbia lead in 64th minute. Mijat Gaƒáinoviƒá replaced Filip Kostiƒá 81st minute, and scored a goal five minutes later in his first game for national team. On 11 June 2017, Aleksandar Mitroviƒá scored the only goal for Eagles, against Wales (1‚Äì1) in the front of 47,000 fans at Rajko Mitiƒá Stadium. On 2 September 2017, Serbia defeated Moldova 3‚Äì0 at Partizan Stadium. Mijat Gaƒáinoviƒá scored 20th minute and ten minutes later assisted for Aleksandar Kolarov's first goal in these qualifications. Aleksandar Mitroviƒá scored the third goal for Serbia on this match and continued his amazing performance in these qualifications (six goals in last five qualification matches). Three days later, Serbia defeated Ireland in Dublin 1‚Äì0 and come on the step of 2018 FIFA World Cup. Aleksandar Kolarov scored a goal in 55th minute. Nikola Maksimoviƒá was sent off thirteen minutes later and Eagles played almost half an hour with a player less. Serbia needed a victory on one of two remaining matches. On 6 October, at Ernst-Happel- Stadion in Wien Serbia has lost 3‚Äì2. The Eagles take the lead in 11th minute, after Luka Milivojeviƒá's first goal for national team, but Austria reversed result in 76th minute, but Nemanja Matiƒá has scored the equalizer seven minutes later. In 89th minute, Austrians scored the winning goal. Three days later at Rajko Mitiƒá Stadium, Aleksandar Prijoviƒá's goal in 74th minute against Georgia sent Serbia to the 2018 FIFA World Cup. A couple days after match, coach Slavoljub Muslin was sacked. Mladen Krstajiƒá succeeded Muslin as coach of the Serbia national team, initially as a caretaker. He led team on two matches in November. In first match, he made victory against China 2‚Äì0, but in second Serbia draw 1‚Äì1 with South Korea. In December, it was announced he would take on the role permanently and at least until the end of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. In March, Serbia played two matches against two strongest African teams. In first match, in Turin, Serbia lost 1‚Äì2 against Morocco. Du≈°an Tadiƒá scored goal for Serbia, in his 50th match for national team. On 27 March, Serbia beat 2‚Äì0 Nigeria in London. Mitroviƒá scored two goals for Serbia. In first week of June, Serbia played two matches in Graz against South American teams. In first match, Serbia lost 0‚Äì1 against Chile, but in second they demolished Bolivia with 5‚Äì1. Serbia scored four goals in first half. Mitroviƒá scored first hat-trick in national team.

Pioneer life Craufurdland Castle She initially had a farm in Ayrshire, Scotland, on her own account, and lived with the Houison Craufurd family in their Craufurdland Castle. Later decided, for health reasons, to emigrate to Port Phillip. Anne Drysdale arrived at Port Phillip on 15 March 1840, and soon after became a guest of Dr Alexander Thomson and his family in Geelong. He had offered to help her and find a run. She and Caroline Elizabeth Newcomb (1812-1874), also a recent immigrant, became friends and, when Anne decided on Boronggoop as the site for her run, they also became partners. Anne was an experienced farmer and twenty years senior to Caroline. A cottage was built for them, the Armstrong family and others entered their employ, and a home was established. Coryule, built for Anne Drysdale and Caroline Elizabeth Newcomb As Boronggoop was held by licence, Drysdale was anxious to own a freehold property. By 1843 they had established an outstation, Lap Lap, on Reedy Lake, and had heard of the run Coryule, near modern Drysdale. On 18 July they settled the sale of the property from Mr. Austin and by the late 1840s they were living there in the stone house Coryule, overlooking Port Phillip Bay, built by Melbourne architect, Charles Laing.

The name is a reference to its distinctive bright blue colour, which can make it immediately obvious in other mud or soil. Chemically it is a form of Prussian blue. Although several chemical industry processes could produce it, it is particularly associated with coal gasification and older town gasworks. It has been recognised as a problem effluent and land contaminant since the early industrial period and the first gasworks at the start of the 19th century. As a visible proof of contamination, blue billy is an important signifier in contaminated land remediation projects and its discovery, especially if undisclosed, may be a cause of contract disputes.  Causes  As one of a range of ferric ferrocyanides, blue billy is a compound of iron, carbon and nitrogen. Processes producing ammonia or cyanides in the presence of iron may give rise to it. Most commonly it is found around old gasworks. Part of the gas production process, producing town gas by the gasification of coal, involves a liquid bubbler scrubber to remove ammonia compounds, including ammonium cyanide compounds, from the raw gas. If left untreated, these could cause corrosion in gas pipework. A further process to make the gas less toxic by removing hydrogen sulphide and hydrogen cyanide, the purifier, passed the gas over trays of ferric oxide as bog iron ore, similar to red rust, which removed sulphur and cyanide compounds and became 'spent' in this process. These could be arranged as either a wet or dry process, where the gas produced was bubbled through water or passed through a box of a dampened absorber material such as wood shavings. These cheap materials were consumed and discarded periodically. Waste tips where they were dumped, or even storage areas where they remained for a time and released leachates, are all common places to find billy deposits forming. Early gasworks, from 1812, used Samuel Clegg's 'wet lime' purification process which produced large quantities of blue billy. A later 'dry lime' process was developed, using moist hydrated lime, in part to avoid the problem of disposing of the blue billy waste. This process produced a waste known as 'foul lime'. Later the bog iron process supplemented the dry lime. Although the overall compositions of both spent oxide and foul lime are similar, with 6% cyanides and 36-60% free sulphur, the foul lime is far easier to dispose of. It is broken down by being left in open piles and allowed to weather, leaving a lime-rich residue which could be sold and used as a fertiliser. Bog iron wastes were also weathered in open piles, which allowed them to be regenerated for use four or five times, until they reached a final sulphur content of 50‚Äì60%. This ferrous sulphate was commercially saleable for acid production, and although the economics of this were only marginally profitable, it avoided disposal costs. Coke works, where a similar process is carried out primarily to manufacture coke, either for steelmaking or as a smokeless fuel, are also common sites for its occurrence. Coke plants were noted for their iron wastes being more prone to contain ferrocyanides, not merely sulphates. If sufficiently concentrated, >5%, these would be commercially saleable. If wastes are preserved in anoxic environments, the Prussian blue colour may not yet have developed. Exposing these to the air and allowing them to become oxidised lets the colour develop., Fouled Wood-Shavings as \\"Box\\" Wastes, Cyanogens and Lampblack When looking for blue billy as a way to indicate the extent of contamination, this time should be allowed for.  Commercial uses  There have been very few commercial uses for blue billy, either as a by-product of production or as a means of disposal when unintended deposits are discovered. It has been offered for sale as an ingredient in sulphuric acid production, although with little commercial acceptance. In the past, blue billy has been sold as a weedkiller.  Cleanup  Cleanup for urban gasworks, usually smaller Victorian sites, has usually consisted of removing the worst material en masse to a landfill site away from town. Remediation of larger sites, such as industrial cokeworks, has required a more selective approach as the volumes and site values involved have been too large to justify simply carrying it away elsewhere. Bio- remediation, mechanically working the soil to expose it to air, sunlight and bacterial action, is a process which can be effective against tars, but not blue billy. Billy residues may require small-scale identification across the site and their separation. By such screening it has been possible to separate the worst of the wastes as one-thirtieth of the total, then to stabilise that within a cementitious matrix and produce a stable form which could be re-used on site.

The book's premise is that Harold Holt, Prime Minister of Australia from 1966 to 1967, was a lifelong spy for the Chinese government, under both the Nationalist and Communist regimes. Its most famous claim is that Holt faked his own death ‚Äì rather than drowning, he boarded a Chinese submarine stationed off the Australian coast and lived the rest of his life in Beijing. The book was widely ridiculed upon its release, and has been identified as containing numerous factual errors. Background Anthony Grey was a former Reuters correspondent, best known for being held captive by the Chinese government from 1967 to 1969. He later turned to writing novels, several of which featured main characters who fell in love with Asian countries as young men.Pierce, Peter, \\"A long slog\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, 10 December 1988. In May 1983, Grey received an anonymous call from a man claiming to have discovered the final fate of Harold Holt. They spent the next two months going over a manuscript, and eventually agreed that the story would be published under Grey's name. Grey's anonymous caller was later identified as Ronald Titcombe, a former Royal Australian Navy officer.Frame (2005), p. 279. Titcombe left the navy in 1968, apparently to avoid a court martial, and over the following decades pursued various business interests. Several of his companies went bankrupt, and at one point he had his assets seized for non- payment of debts. He was appointed secretary of the Melbourne Club in 1982 but was asked to resign when it was discovered he had failed to disclose previous financial improprieties.Frame (2005), pp. 289‚Äì290. After an initial tip-off from an Iraqi civil servant, Titcombe claimed to have \\"gradually pieced together a more comprehensive story from a series of meetings with several different Chinese government officials\\".Frame (2005), pp. 279‚Äì280. Claims The Prime Minister Was a Spy made the following claims:Frame (2005), pp. 280‚Äì285. *Holt's involvement with the Chinese government began in 1929 when he was a student at the University of Melbourne. After one of his research papers came to their attention, he was recruited by the consul-general in Melbourne to write pro-Chinese articles for a business newspaper. *In 1931, a section was created within the Kuomintang's intelligence service to report directly to Chiang Kai-shek. Holt became the group's agent in Australia and given a handler based in Sydney. * After being elected to the House of Representatives in 1935, Holt was earmarked for special training in espionage. He was initially intended to be a sleeper agent, but was considered too valuable and was soon reactivated. He began passing on cabinet papers and other information, writing in code and making use of dead drops. * Holt again became a sleeper agent when the Chinese Communist Revolution broke out, but in 1952 was contacted by a Kuomintang agent (now based on Taiwan) and paid ¬£30,000 to resume his spying. However, in 1954 he voluntarily deactivated because he had transferred his sympathies to the Communists. * In 1957, Holt discovered that the Kuomintang agent who had contacted him in 1952 was, in fact, a representative of the Communist Party. He agreed to be reactivated once the Chinese government agreed to various conditions, and for the next ten years continued to pass on state secrets. He was given an \\"escape route\\" in case he was discovered ‚Äì a submarine positioned off the Australian coast. * In May 1967, Holt began to suspect that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) had become aware of his activities. He faked his own death on 17 December 1967, pretending to drown while swimming at Cheviot Beach, Victoria ‚Äì in reality, after Holt slipped below the surface two Chinese frogmen dragged him down by the ankles and guided him to the conning tower of the waiting submarine. Holt spent the rest of his life in Beijing, and ASIO erased any trace of his defection to cover up its own errors. Reception Tom Frame, Holt's biographer, describes Titcombe and Grey's account as a \\"complete fabrication\\".Frame (2005), p. 292. He notes that there is \\"no corroborative evidence\\" for most of their claims, as none of the documents referred to in the book were produced.Frame (2005), p. 280. Furthermore, Holt was stridently anti-Communist,Frame (2005), p. 286. the large sums of money he supposedly received were never reflected in his lifestyle,Frame (2005), p. 282. he was highly unlikely to have deserted his wife and children,Frame (2005), p. 288. and the waters off Cheviot Beach were much too shallow for a submarine to submerge.Frame (2005), pp. 285‚Äì286. Zara Holt observed that her husband \\"didn't even like Chinese food\\". James Rusbridger, a British espionage researcher, wrote: \\"Were it not for the distress the allegations caused the Holt family, such a tale might be marginally amusing and deserve a short-lived place on the fiction shelves. But what is most interesting about this story is the manner in which all sorts of vague allegations are linked together and then presented as proven evidence upon which to base the claim of Holt's treachery.\\" The Guardian noted that \\"many Australians feel the story could be as big a hoax as that played on Stern magazine and Times Newspapers over the Hitler Diaries\\". It further observed that \\"many of the book's claims are either wrong, dubious or uncheckable\\".The Guardian, 21 November 1983. Gareth Evans, Australia's Attorney-General at the time, said \\"the whole tale seems to be straight out of fruitcake land\\",\\"Australian's drowning was faked, book says\\", The New York Times, 21 November 1983. while the Chinese government issued a statement describing it as \\"sheer fabrication\\".Osnos, Peter, Spy Boat to China?, The Washington Post, 26 November 1983. In 1988, Ronald Titcombe brought action against The Observer under British libel law for describing the book as a hoax, and was awarded \\"substantial\\" undisclosed damages. However, the judgment was not a reflection upon the accuracy of the book; Titcombe was successful because The Observer was unable to prove that he had been acting in bad faith.\\"Damages for author\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, 7 October 1988.

Career Moreira worked as a management consultant for Ju√°rez & Associates and Arthur D.

In October 2017, she succeeded Cobus de Swardt as head of Transparency International. Moreira was a board member of the United Nations Global Compact and a Council representative on the International Land Coalition. In 2018 she spoke at the 18th International Anti-Corruption Conference (IACC) in Copenhagen, Denmark, arguing that \\"corruption hits most the poor who suffer the consequences of corrupt regimes.\\" In 2019, she admonished Western banks for facilitating corruption in Gambia. In 2019 she argued that citizen's rights and democratic institutions were threatened by the trend for more authoritarian and populist regimes across the world which should be resisted by greater checks and balances. Controversy with Transparency International In August 2019, The Guardian reported on how current and former staff members of Transparency International had said that under Moreira it had promoted a culture of \\"bullying\\" and \\"failed in its duty of care\\" and used \\"gagging orders\\" in termination agreements. The report cited a staff survey carried out by the staff representatives (works council), which found that 66% of 92 respondents had observed or experienced bullying at TI and one in five felt sexual harassment to be a problem. Two investigations followed, conducted by law firm Taylor Wessing and Transparency International‚Äôs Ethics Panel.The findings, which were also disputed by Moreira, identified some individual incidents in which the values and principles of transparency and accountability were not ensured entirely, and one case that might qualify as harassment at the workplace. Moreira was dismissed in February 2020. In June 2020, the Observer reported that Moreira had made a complaint of bullying against the Board of Transparency International and claimed she had been unfairly dismissed. She was reportedly planning to sue Transparency International for unfair dismissal.

Etymology  The word Arnavut (Albanian) is part of a dish in ƒ∞stanbul cuisine known as Arnavut ciƒüeri (Albanian liver).  History  The origins of Arnavut ciƒüeri lie in the fifteenth century and the aftermath of wars in what became the Ottoman Balkans (Rumelia) and the immigration of Albanians to the Istanbul region. \\"K√ºlt√ºr√ºm√ºz√ºn temel ta≈ülarƒ±ndan olan semtlere (Arnavutk√∂y, Arnavutkaldƒ±rƒ±mƒ±), yemeklerimize (Arnavut ciƒüeri), ki≈üilik √∂zelliklerine (Arnavut inadƒ±) adƒ±nƒ± verdiƒüimiz Arnavutlarƒ±n, Anadolu‚Äôya ilk g√∂√ßleri, ya≈üadƒ±klarƒ± Arnavutluk topraƒüƒ±nƒ±n Osmanlƒ± Devleti y√∂netimine ge√ßmesiyle ba≈ülamƒ±≈ütƒ±r.\\" People traveling from the Balkans to Ottoman Anatolia imparted their influences on the area such as Albanians who became employed as mobile sellers of raw liver.

German Der Weg zum Friedhof) is a short story by Thomas Mann. Initially appeared in 1900 in Simplicissimus. Appeared in 1903 in an anthology of Mann's six short stories, entitled collectively as Six Novellen. Published after his death as part of Death in Venice and Other Stories. This work parodies Naturalism (e.g. the alcoholism) and Mann's own Nietzschean influences. The recurrent protest present here in a comic vein, as well as in many other Mann's works, is against ignorant vitality epitomized here as the young boy on the bicycle. Plot The short story begins with a description of the gravel paved road to the churchyard, as well as of the half-paved highway running parallel to it. During the introduction sequence, various persons travelling it are described, such as soldiers marching, apprentices heading into town, or merchants travelling by cart. The story then moves onto a physical description of the main character, Lobgott Piepsam. His wardrobe is described as a bit short for him, with sings of aging present of it, but overall, quite inconspicuous. His face is, on the contrary, memorable because of his nose. It is large, covered in marks and, in contrast to his pale face, red. The reason for his going to the church is given as well, he is heading to visit the graves of his wife and children. His children died young, as infants, and his wife died six months prior. His entire demeanor is that of grief, much more than that of a grieving husband and father. He is an alcoholic, without the support of a family. Next, a young boy tries to pass him, only to be stopped when Lobgott threatens with a formal complaint to the city government, because he is driving a bike on the church road where that isn't permitted. The boy simply shrugs him off, and tries to drive off. Lobgott runs after him, grabs the rear side of the bike and cause that bike to overturn. The boy responds by punching him in the chest, and further threatening him, should he again stop him. When the boy drives off, Lobgott proceeds to yell, cuss and scream uncontrollably at this perceived offense. A crowd gathers around him, of which he remains unaware, and in the end loses consciousness, with the ambulance driving him away. Allegorical interpretation The short story is an allegory for Life. Lobgott, who has suffered tragedy in his life, is headed to the cemetery. On the way there he, a self-destructive man, is intercepted by Life. This bothers Lobgott, who demands life take another way, but is ignored and a chase occurs. The chase can be interpreted as Lobgott trying to prevent Life from taking its course, to get it out of his way, or it can be interpreted as Lobgott expressing his wish to participate in it. Life escapes, Lobgott dies, and his body is unceremoniously shoved into the ambulance, as a loaf into an oven. Characters * Lobgott Piepsam - an alcoholic who recently lost his wife, children and his job. The representation of a rudimentary protest against vitality. * The Boy on the bicycle - called life in the short story, charges headlong, brutally pushing aside Lobgott.

History of the building  Literaturhaus M√ºnchen at Salvatorplatz Salvatorplatz with Literaturhaus (front left) and Salvatorkirche (rear left) The Salvatorkirche is located at the Salvatorplatz. The cemetery surrounding the church was converted into the market square in the 18th century. Through the decision of the Munich magistrate, a school was built there, the market lost its place and was integrated into the ground floor of the new building. The market operation was stopped in 1906 and the building was completely converted to the school. In 1993, the Munich City Council decided to use the buildings, which were largely in need of refurbishment, to be used as a literary house. For this purpose, the state capital of Munich, together with Munich publishers, founded the Stiftung Buch-, Medien- und Literaturhaus M√ºnchen. In 1995, the renovation and reconstruction of the building and the entire Salvatorplatz started. In addition to various event facilities, a library was also created in the building. In June 1997, the Literaturhaus M√ºnchen was opened. Since 2002, the fictional office of the \\"Mutter Oberin\\" of the ARD TV series Um Himmels Willen is located on the third floor.

Lynne Cooper is the Curators' Distinguished Professor of Psychology at the University of Missouri. She is known for her research on risk-taking and psychological adjustment of adolescents, young adults, and couples. Many of her studies and published works are related to alcohol, substance use, and sexual activity in adolescents and young adults at the transition to adulthood. Other influential research has examined health outcomes of parents who experience stress due to conflicts between work and family responsibilities. Cooper is the 2018 President-Elect of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology. She is the Editor of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Personality Processes and Individual Differences. She previously served as Associate Editor of the American Psychologist and Personality and Social Psychology Review.  Biography  Cooper received her Ph.D. in Psychology from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1987. Prior to joining the faculty of the Department of Psychology at the University of Missouri, Cooper conducted research at the Research Institute on Alcoholism, Buffalo, NY and was a member of the Psychology Department at the State University of New York at Buffalo. Her research program has been funded through grants from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the National Institute on Mental Health.  Selected Research  M. Lynne Cooper is known for her work examining the role of alcohol in adolescent decision making in risky situations, and the influence of social factors, including family structure on alcohol use. In an influential study, Cooper and her colleagues used surveys to identify relationships between sexual behavior and alcohol consumption and whether it varied by gender and race/ethnicity. They obtained information about adolescent sexual activity, which included age of sexual debut, frequency of sex with strangers, one-night stands, and number of sexual partners in the prior half-year. A separate survey tracked alcohol use and included the frequency of alcohol consumption, its heavy use over the prior 6 month period, and alcohol problems. They observed that, on average, youth initiated sexual activity at 15.5 years of age, while initiating alcohol consumption at 16.4 years of age. Males engaged in sexual behavior about a year earlier than females, and blacks engaged earlier than other race/ethnicities. Adolescent males exhibited a strong correlation between alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors, whereas this relationship emerged later in females. Cooper's team focused on five personality traits including communal orientation, agency, negative emotionality, impulsivity, and sexual venturesomeness that might be related to risky behavior in adolescents. Communal orientation referred to the tendency to be agreeable and attentive to others; this trait was associated with having a committed relationship, seeking partners who are trustworthy, and meeting personal intimacy goals. Agency was characterized by confidence in social settings and having a primary focus on oneself rather than others. Individuals high in agency often displayed low risk behaviors during sex because of their ability to engage in discussion with their partner, yet also displayed greater inclination to consume alcohol. Negative emotionality led individuals to take more risks with the intention of alleviating their emotions. Impulsivity referred to the tendency to focus on attaining immediate benefit, rather than delaying gratification. Sexual venturesomeness was characterized by extraversion and desire for variety in sexual interactions; individuals who scored high on this trait tended to avoid safe, precautionary measures. In other work, Cooper and her colleagues investigated the motivations to consume alcohol of 393 \\"community-recruited drinkers.\\" They distinguished four types of motivation to use alcohol: self-focused enhancement, self-focused avoidance, social approach, and social avoidance. Self-focused enhancement was observed in individuals who drank for the pleasure and excitement of being drunk. Self-focused avoidance was observed in individuals who drank to negate distress or negative emotions. Social approach motives referred to the experience of interacting more freely after consuming alcohol. Social avoidance motives referred to drinking for the purpose of being accepted and avoiding social exclusion. Cooper's team had each participant keep a diary of each time they drank and tracked it in relation to their motivations and whether the experience of drinking induced pleasure, relief, or worse feelings than beforehand. They observed that self-focused enhancement led drinkers to conceive each progressive drink as more pleasurable than the last. In addition, participants with self-focused avoidance motives conceived each drink to be more relieving. These results provided insight into reasons why people often tend to drink excessively.

It was described by Tryon Reakirt in 1867. Other common names for this species, depending on the region, include green hairstreak and elfin. C. xami is considered to be a very rare species of butterfly, and its typical range is in southern Arizona and Texas including down south to Guatemala. The juniper hairstreak and the silver-banded hairstreak butterflies are similar species, but both differ significantly from C. xami in regards to the postmedian white line running across the butterfly wings. Description C. xami is a tailed species of butterfly that has a wingspan range of 2.38 to 2.86 cm. In appearance, the underside of the hindwing is yellowish green; the wing also contains the postmedian white line, which is the discernible colored line located posterior to the middle of the wing, that forms a W-shape toward the tails of the butterfly. Some species that appear similar to C. xami include the juniper hairstreak and the silver- banded hairstreak. The major differences are that the juniper species lacks the sharp W mark in the postmedian white band while the silver-banded species has a broader silver-white postmedian line on the underside of the hindwing. Geographic range and habitat C. xami is found primarily in the southern U.S., specifically the southern and southeastern parts of Arizona and central Texas, and as far south as Mexico and Guatemala. The butterfly's range is predominantly contained in North America and parts of Central America. C. xami can be found near coniferous woodland forests and in relatively sunny areas along mountain and canyon slopes that provide shade. These butterflies dwell in areas with cool to warm temperate climates and weather patterns. Male territory defense In terms of territoriality, male C. xami often shift territories as territories play a large role in mate location and courtship. Specifically, competing males may intrude into another male‚Äôs territory, thereby aggressively displacing that butterfly and causing it to shift territory. Another reason that males may leave their given territory is to search for better territory, such as territories that provide better resources or better access to mates. Male-male competition is high for territory. Once a male forfeits and abandons his territory, another male quickly fills the gap to increase his chances gaining access to food and other resources. Host plants Sedum allantoides, one of C. xami's preferred host plants The majority of C. xami's host plants come from Echeveria and Sedum, two genera of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae. Many of these flowering plants are native to parts of western and southwestern United States and Mexico. In Mexico, Echevelia gibbiflora and Sedum allantoides are the most common host plants. The role of host plants is integral to the oviposition of C. xami. These plants also serve as a main food resource for the C. xami larvae. Oviposition The process of oviposition in C. xami begins with the male butterfly perching or slightly hovering above the host plant, most likely a plant of genus Echeveria. When perched on Echeveria, the male waits and watches for a female butterfly to pass or fly by. Females oviposit after they have found an acceptable plant. Oviposition takes place after copulation and can lasts for a duration of up to two days. Females most often deposit their eggs on the underside of the leaf, where they are most likely to be protected against predation. For C. xami and other species in Lepidoptera, the selective oviposition behavior exhibited by the female, such as preference for a specific host plant, may drive adaptations for certain defense mechanisms in that host plant. Life cycle Egg Eggs are spherically shaped and slightly flattened, approximately 0.7 to 0.8 mm in diameter and 0.5 mm in height. Eggs look similar to those of related species, such as the eggs of juniper hairstreaks and silver-banded hairstreaks. They are initially a pale, light green that gradually fades and turns white over time. The average duration of the egg stage in the life cycle for C. xami is roughly seven days. Eggs are usually found on the underside of the leaf of the host plant. Larva The larval stages of C. xami are not well documented, and thus, the precise number of instars and the timeframe of those instars is unknown. It is reported that there are at least three distinct and separate instars, but there is potential for a fourth or fifth instar stage. Throughout the first developmental stage of the first instar, larvae body length ranges from 0.8 to 1.0 mm. The larvae are variable in color based on age; in the case of the first instar, the body of the larvae, which is covered in tiny brownish hair follicles, is pale yellow in color with some shade of brown coloring the head portion. In the case of the second instar, the body of the larvae, now covered in tiny pinkish-red hair follicles, can range from yellow-green to pale pink in color. During the last larval stage, larvae body length usually measures about 16 mm. With the larvae body now covered in dark colored hair follicles, its coloring at this final instar stage can be yellowish-green in hue with a pale yellow coloring on the head of the larvae. Pupa In form and appearance, the pupae are not recognizably uniform or homogenous, but rather can vary in both coloring and physical size. In some cases, rough estimates put an individual pupa roughly between 9 and 11 mm in diameter. In color, the pupae can range between shades of brown, from light to dark, as well as reddish brown and even black. Spotting, usually dark brown in color, may or may not be seen on some parts of the body during pupation. Another characteristic feature of this stage is the presence of two small pale brown spines at the tip of the abdomen. Migration and flight behavior C. xami has two or more flights during the year, most often between the months of March and December. With Mexico comprising a large geographical range for this butterfly, it is reported that the greatest number of adult butterflies observed near Mexico City happens during the flight months from July to September, followed a few months later by the flight months from December to January. A third, lesson common and less abundant flight period takes place from April to May. The general flight periods are the months of June and from September to December. Defense against predators C. xami exhibits wing morphology, warding off predators with the color and morphology of its hind wings, which appear to be a false head. The color patterns of the hindwing create the appearance of a head at the rear of the insect‚Äôs body. These ‚Äúfalse heads‚Äù help C. xami survive predation from mantises and other visually oriented predators such as birds. Additionally, it is possible that these pseudo-head markings confer a survival advantage to the butterflies by deflecting predator attacks towards the hind wing and lower half of the butterfly's body and away from the unprotected actual head. Mating and courtship Courtship behavior C. xami is a polygynous butterfly species, in which butterflies take different mates several times over the course of their lives. An important part of courtship is territory defense, specifically the active defense of territories by males. Competition for territory space may result from the fact that territories often function as mating stations and spaces for active courtship. Furthermore, multiple mating is generally advantageous for male insects to increase the likelihood of producing more offspring. As male-male competition is high, the exact nature of the relationship between male fitness and frequency of matings may be unclear due to sperm competition, cryptic female choice, and cost to benefit ratio of mating. Typical courtship process The general process for a typical courtship interaction begins when a female flies near a perching male, who is most likely perched on the typical host plant of Echeveria gibbiflora. After the female passes by, the male flies around and follows the female and a courtship flight dance in the air begins; at some point in this courtship flight, which lasts approximately 30 seconds, the male flies closely behind and slightly above the simultaneously flying female butterfly. Together, the male and female perch closely together on a plant, most likely the host plant Echeveria, and the male butterfly assumes a position in front of the female with their heads facing each other. In terms of motion, the male continuously and aggressively flutters his wings while the female remains still with her wings closed. Eventually, the male butterfly moves into a position right next to the female, with the heads and tails of both butterflies aligned, and makes genital contact with the female. After copulation ends, which may last several hours, the male may return to perch on the plant whereas the female may leave the area, thus ending this cycle of the courtship process.

She is known for her research on the impact of corporal punishment in the home and at school on children and their mental health. Gershoff was awarded the 2014 Lifetime Legacy Achievement Award from the Center for the Human Rights of Children at Loyola University Chicago for her efforts to end legalized violence against children. In the book Corporal Punishment in U.S. Public Schools: Legal Precedents, Current Practices, and Future Policy, Gershoff and colleagues draw attention to the fact that corporal punishment in schools remains legal in 19 states. The authors estimate that nearly 200,000 children are victims of corporal punishment in schools and that many Americans are unaware of the physical injuries these children obtain from corporal punishment in school. Gershoff's co-edited book Social Contexts of Child Development: Pathways of Influence and Implications for Practice and Policy, with Rashmita S. Mistry, and Danielle A. Crosby, received the 2014 Society for Research on Adolescence Social Policy Award for Best Edited Book. She is co-author of the popular textbook How Children Develop, with Robert S. Siegler, Jenny Saffran, Nancy Eisenberg, and Judy DeLoache.  Biography  Gershoff received her Bachelor of Arts in Psychology and English Language and Literature at the University of Virginia in 1992. She went to graduate school at the University of Texas at Austin and obtained her PhD in Child Development and Family Relationships in 1998. Gershoff completed a post-doctoral fellowship at the Prevention Research Center and Department of Psychology of Arizona State University (1998-1999). She then worked as a researcher at the National Center for Children in Poverty at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University (1999-2004). Gershoff joined the faculty of the School of Social Work at the University of Michigan in 2004. She joined the faculty of the School of Human Ecology at the University of Texas at Austin in 2009. Gershoff's research has been funded through the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institute of Mental Health, and the National Science Foundation.  Research  Gershoff's research focuses on the impact of parental discipline on child and youth development, while taking account of differences in background factors such as poverty, culture, school, and neighborhood. She also examines the effect of exposure to violence on child and youth development, and the efficacy of early childhood and parental educational programs. In 2016, Gershoff and her colleagues published the results of a meta-analysis of the effects of corporal punishment and physical abuse on children. The studies included in the meta-analysis involved more than 160,000 children and spanned over a 50 year period. The results provided clear evidence in support of the view that spanking children is harmful. The more children were spanked, the more likely they were to experience anti-social behavior, aggression, mental health problems, and cognitive difficulties. The effects of spanking were indistinguishable from the effects of physical abuse on child development outcomes. Gershoff has argued that corporal punishment as a form of discipline fails to teach children why their behavior was wrong nor does it teach them what the appropriate behavior should have been. Parental use of physical punishment teaches children that violence is morally acceptable, causes fear to develop between the child and parent, and subsequently damages their relationship. She estimates that 80% of American children have received physical punishment from their parents by the time they reach the 5th grade and over 70% of parents agree or strongly agree with the sentiment that ‚Äúchildren sometimes need a good, hard spanking‚Äù. Parents believe in the efficacy of corporal punishment in the absence of any valid evidence that spanking is necessary or effective at correcting misbehavior, regardless the age of the child. Other research provides evidence of intergenerational transmission of violence: individuals who received physical punishment as children are more likely to use physical punishment as adults when disciplining children.

In the 1920s earliest use of the word was found in Journal of Philosophy.English Oxford Living Dictionaries In theology this word was used by Ernest Fuchs, relating to New Hermeneutic. Fuchs' doctrine of language helped to inspire a \\"new quest\\" for the historical Jesus because it could now be said that Jesus' words and deeds constituted that \\"language event\\" in which faith first entered into language, thereby becoming available as an existential possibility within language, the \\"house of being\\" (Heidegger). Conversely, the reality of God's love is verbalized in Jesus' words and deeds recorded in the Gospels and is thus preserved as language gain(Sprachgewinn). In the freedom of proclamation God's presence in the gospel as the \\"Yes of love\\" happens again-that is, comes to be as language, opening up the future to authentic existence (faith, hope, and love) (1999) Dictionary of Biblical Interpretation, A-J, R.N. Soulen, \\"Ernst Fuchs\\", by John Hayes, (Abingdon), 422-423 Paul According to the Epistles of Paul, the proclaimed Word of God effects and creates faith. Faith is thus the creature of the word (\\"creatura verbi\\"). So it says in Paul's letter to the Romans (Rom 10,17 EU): \\"Faith thus comes from preaching, but preaching by the word of Christ.\\" Thus, for Paul, faith arises from hearing the apostolic message of faith. Yet this \\"fides ex auditu\\" is a gift from God.Peter Stuhlmacher, Biblische Theologie des Neuen Testaments Bd. 1: Grundlegung. von Jesus zu Paulus, G√∂ttingen 1992, S. 343 Martin Luther Martin Luther defines the believing people as \\"homo audiens\\".Albrecht Beutel, Im Anfang war das Wort, 1991, S. 126ff. According to him, listening to the Word requires faith in man.z. B. WA 23,267,20-22: ‚ÄûDer Glaube ynn Gotts wort ist uns von n√∂ten, weil es darumb geredt wird, das wirs gleuben sollen, und Gott foddert und wil den glauben haben, wo sein wort ist.‚Äú This \\"verbality\\" of faith is central to his theology. Again and again, this emphasizes the vocabulary of faith and that the word should be praised as a means of grace.WA 5, 175, 23; 176, 12, 177, 11; 215, 38; 376, 2; 380, 15. Faith embraces the word that is offered to it.Vgl. Ernst Bizer, Fides ex auditu, 1961, S. 171 So it is z. Eg in his second Psalm lecture (1519/20) on Ps 18.45 VUL: \\"Actum igitur credendi (ut vocant) nescio quibus verbis possis aptius eloqui quam ista periphrasi divina:\\" auditu auris audivit mihi \\", hoc est, stultus sibi fuit populus gentium, ut mihi crederet in his, quae non videret nec caperet.\\"  Martin Luther: WA 5, 537, 3 \\"Therefore, I do not know with which words you could pronounce the event of faith (as they call it) more fittingly than by this divine description:\\" It [the people] hears me with obedient ears \\", that is to say, simple is for themselves the people of People so that it believed me in things that neither saw nor grasped. \\" By referring to the passage as a \\"transcription\\", Luther means the \\"inner\\" and \\"spiritual\\" hearing through which the act of believing (actum credendi) is characterized.Holger Flachmann, Martin Luther und das Buch (1996), S. 241 In accordance with such a Lutheran understanding of the word, Fuchs will later develop his theory of the language event. Ernst Fuchs Ernest Fuchs insisted that speeches from the language event is in the Pauline-Lutheran tradition.Eberhard J√ºngel, Unterwegs zur Sache (2000), S.24 For Fuchs, word and faith essentially belong together: faith has its essence from its relationship to the word. Faith is the listening to the word that meets it, by which he means the Gospel concretely. For this reason, Fuchs sees the speech event as the unfolding of faith: it causes the listener to change the situation from \\"not-being\\" to being in the existence of God. This understanding of speech thus represents a fundamental category of his hermeneutics. Fuchs is keen to emphasize the passivity of man. For this he uses the term of silence. Man does not move in her, but is moved by the speech event. Language live on the silence.Ernst Fuchs, Marburger Hermeneutik (1968), S.242 In the language event, the language itself leads to that silence of which it lives. In addition, Fuchs sees his statements of eloquent and significant language parallel to the distinction between being and being (see also Heidegger).Ernst Fuchs, Gesammelte Aufs√§tze II (1960), S.425 While merely indicative language offers only an expression of beings, a speech event justifies being and allows it to be present. Fuchs applies his doctrine of the linguistic event to various theological disciplines, namely, the preaching of Jesus, the theology of Paul and the Easter event.Ernst Fuchs, Gesammelte Aufs√§tze I (1959), S, 281 Gerhard Ebeling Gerhard Ebeling continues to use the concept of the language event as a demarcation to dogmatic doctrine. Ebeling understands the sacrament as \\"language event\\". Eberhard J√ºngel Eberhard J√ºngel, theologically influenced by Ernest Fuchs, proved to be a proponent of the language event. He took it over in his book \\"Paul and Jesus\\" as a demarcation to Rudolf Bultmann.

Early life  Bigelow was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts, on January 30, 1908, the son of a farmer. His family moved to North Westminster, Vermont, when Horace was a child. Following graduation from high school and a year and a half at Norwich University, Bigelow entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, where he graduated 121st in a class of 262 Cadets in June 1932.  Military career  Upon assignment to the Field Artillery branch, Bigelow spent several years as battery officer at Fort Ethan Allen, Vermont, and at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. Following his recovery from tuberculosis at Fitzsimmons Army Hospital in Denver, he attended the Field Artillery School at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and graduated from it in 1937. Next, he became the Officer-in-Charge of the West Point Preparatory School at III Corps Headquarters, Fort McPherson, Georgia. From 1939 to 1942, he served in a variety of capacities as a member of the 83rd Field Artillery at Fort Bragg, North Carolina; including, battery officer, battery commander, battalion staff officer, and battalion commander. He transferred to the Ordnance branch in March 1942 and attended a course at Aberdeen Proving Ground. Following this course, he attended the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. In August 1942, he was assigned as the Ordnance Officer for the 102nd Infantry at Camp Maxey, Texas and was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel. Following an assignment with the XVIth Corps at Fort Riley, Kansas in December 1943, he served as the Assistant Ordnance officer at headquarters, Second Army in Memphis, Tennessee from June until August 1944. He then went overseas to serve with the Army Ground Forces Board in the Mediterranean Theater from August 1944 to February 1945; after which, he was named as the Ordnance Supply Officer, Headquarters Peninsular Base Section in Italy from February 1945 until April 1945. He assumed command of the 232nd Base Depot in April 1945 and was promoted to Colonel. He became the Deputy Ordnance Officer, Peninsular Base Section in November 1945 and Chief Ordnance Officer for the Peninsular Bay Section and Allied Force Headquarters, Mediterranean Theater of Operations, Italy in January 1946. He culminated his service overseas in April 1947, when he was named Chief Ordnance Officer, Headquarters, Mediterranean Theater. Upon return to the United States in November 1947, he was assigned as the Executive Officer for the Ordnance Board at Aberdeen Proving Ground and moved to become the Executive Officer to the Commanding General of Aberdeen Proving Ground in October 1948. After his assignment as Executive Officer, he served several assignments at Aberdeen Proving Ground; to include, Assistant Director of Development and Proof Services Division and Chief of the Arms and Ammunition Division. In 1950, he attended the Army War College. Following graduation from the Army War College in 1951, Bigelow was assigned to the Field Service Division at Aberdeen Proving Ground. Bigelow became the commander of the Letterkenny Ordnance Depot in August 1954 and was promoted to Brigadier General. In August 1955, he went to Tokyo, Japan to become the Chief Ordnance Officer at the headquarters of U.S. Army Forces, Far East Eighth Army Rear. Two years later, he was assigned as the Chief Ordnance Officer for U.S. Army Japan and United Nations Command Eighth Army in Japan. His last assignment in Japan was as the Assistant Chief of Staff, G4, Headquarters US Army, Japan, United Nations Command, Eighth US Army (Rear). Upon his return to the U.S. in September 1958, General Bigelow became Chief of the Office of Manpower within the Office of the Chief of Ordnance. Four months later, he became the Assistant Chief of Ordnance for Manpower. In February 1960, he became the Deputy Chief of Ordnance and was promoted to Major General. On June 1, 1962, Bigelow became the 21st Chief Of Ordnance upon the retirement of Lieutenant General John Hinrichs, the previous Chief of Ordnance. However, Bigelow's tenure lasted only two months due to the reorganization of the Army logistical functions as directed by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and the recommendations of Project 80, also known as the Hoelscher Committee Report. Bigelow remained on active duty and became the Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics (Programs) within the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics at the Pentagon. After this two year assignment, he retired in 1964. One year later, in October 1965, General Bigelow was recalled to active duty as Vice Chairman of the Army Logistics Systems Study Group within the Office of the Chief of Staff of the Army. This assignment lasted for approximately one year. Following this, he retired for the second time. He unexpectedly died on December 14, 1970 as a result of choking on a piece of food.

Initially referred to only as \\"Fox;\\" later references to \\"Wm. Fox\\" presumed to be the same individual. (fl. 1718‚Äì1723) was a pirate active in the Caribbean and off the African coast. He was indirectly associated with a number of more prominent pirates such as Bartholomew Roberts, Edward England, and Richard Taylor. History Fox's early career is not recorded. He was among a large number of pirates (including Benjamin Hornigold, Paulsgrave Williams, Francis Leslie, Richard Noland, and more) who accepted King George's 1717 offer of pardon to all pirates who gave themselves up within a year. He did so at New Providence in the Bahamas, possibly surrendering to Captain Pearse of HMS Phoenix, who had sailed to the Caribbean to deliver news of the pardon. By July 1720 he had returned to piracy, joining up with Daniel Porter to embark a fresh crew. They sailed under the pretense of a privateering commission from Governor Robert Hunter of New York. Governor Woodes Rogers of the Bahamas wrote, \\"‚Ä¶Capts. Porter and Fox has left us since wth. about 60 men and I hear are gone under a coppy of a New York Commission from Govr. Hunter ‚Ä¶ I wish they may do no mischief for they began very suspiciously by lying near us and stealing as many men as they could from the shore yt. were not permitted to depart these Islands.\\" Within a year they had attacked both ships and plantations in the area and had attracted another pirate named Miller to their flotilla. Captain Edward Vernon was stationed in the vicinity at the time; frustrated at the growing pirate presence, he wrote of them, \\"Their names are Porter and Fox, who were formerly pirates that surrendered themselves at Providence and took the benefit of the King's last pardon but are now returned to their old courses, and I verily believe such rogues are never to be reclaimed but by a halter.\\" The next appearance of Fox is aboard the former East Indiaman Cassandra, which had been captured in the Indian Ocean by Edward England. After England was deposed from his command it was captained by Olivier Levasseur, who then traded it to England's associate Richard Taylor. Fox may have crossed the Atlantic with Porter and joined them on the return trip: Porter was known to be in the vicinity at the time, meeting with Bartholomew Roberts alongside fellow pirate Richard Tookerman. Taylor, Fox, and others had sailed back to the Caribbean and petitioned the English for a pardon but had been marked as pirates; they were rebuffed and were refused permission to land or trade. Instead they surrendered Cassandra to the Spanish in Panama in 1723 in exchange for a pardon. Fox‚Äôs further activities are not known. Other English Captains who‚Äôd sided with the Spanish (including Richard Noland, who‚Äôd taken the King's Pardon on New Providence alongside Fox) were known to have continued to sail as guarda costa privateers in Spanish service.

She served as Most Worthy Grand Matron (1880‚Äì86) and Right Worthy Grand Secretary of the Order of the Eastern Star (O.E.S.). Early years and education Lorraine J. Dickinson was born July 15, 1845, in Waddington, New York, a farmer's daughter. When she was about five years of age her parents moved to Illinois, settling near Elgin. At the age of eleven she was sent to Rutland, to attend a young ladies' seminary at that place, where she remained until 1861, when she returned to Illinois. When her widowed mother needed her assistance, she took a position as a clerk in a store, her earnings going towards the maintenance of the family. American Civil War At the start of the American Civil War, among those who responded was Capt. E. P. Pitkin, who enlisted at Annapolis, Maryland, in the quartermaster's department. At the Battle of Stones River, he had charge of an ammunition train, and was captured, managed to escape. He was soon after promoted to Assistant Quartermaster, with the rank of Captain. He entered the service when the first guns were fired on Fort Sumter, and was appointed Colonel and chief Quartermaster of the defense of New Orleans. Before his death, as a reward for faithful service, his commission as Colonel was issued ‚Äî too late however, to secure to his family a Colonel's pension. He spent about a year in Brazos, Texas, as master of marine transportation. While stationed in Chicago, he met and married Lorraine J. Dickinson, the marriage occurring October 22, 1863. A few days after the wedding, an order called him to New Orleans. After an absence of seven months, he returned on a month's furlough, going back to his post of duty on June 6, 1864. He died on October 6. An escort brought the remains to the bereaved young widow, and they were taken to the family burying plot in Cleveland, Ohio. Their daughter was born March 1865. Career Order of the Eastern Star Pitkin's Eastern Star work began in 1866, when she joined Miriam Family, which two years later was reorganized in chapter form, adopting the Michigan ritual, and of this she was elected Worthy President, serving in that position about a year. July 18, 1877, Pitkin organized Queen Esther Chapter No. 41; she was its first Worthy Matron. At the Grand Chapter meeting of Illinois in 1877, she was appointed Grand Marshal, and the following year was elected Grand Matron. At the meeting of the General Grand Chapter in 1878, Pitkin was elected Right Worthy Associate Grand Matron. She became Worthy Grand Matron of Illinois in 1879. In her address that year to the Grand Chapter, she said: \\"If our Chapters had something to labor for, some little bare feet to clothe, or heartsick Souls to comfort, there would be no time for contention and strife; the seeds of discord would never be sown and a spirit of harmony and unity Would prevail.\\" At the meeting of the General Grand Chapter in August 1880, in Chicago, she was elected Most Worthy Grand Matron, which she filled for the three successive years. Her report at the session of 1883 held in San Francisco, California, showed the same energy and wise legislation that had characterized her previous work. In 1883, she was elected Right Worthy Grand Secretary, which showed the appreciation of her associates for Pitkin's business ability. However, she declined it in favor of the retiring incumbent. Six years passed, and at the Sixth Triennial Session in the city of Indianapolis, in 1889, she was again elected Right Worthy Grand Secretary, which position she filled so efficiently as to receive a re-election in 1892. For three years, she had charge of an O. E. S. Department in the American Home. In connection with Jennie E. Mathews, Past Most Worthy Grand Matron, she compiled and published a collection of music for chapter use, Gems of Song. Another publication was the Floral Work, which was generally used throughout the Order. Pitkin held the copyright for the O.E.S. membership badge. Several times, she served as delegate to Department and National Conventions of the O.E.S. Pitkin agitated the question of an objective point for the publication, Our Eastern Star almost since its conception, and had a money interest in nearly every Home or Home-interest in the U. S. She was one of the strongest factors in the organizing of the Masonic Orphans Home and Eastern Star and Masonic Home at Macon, Illinois. She gave the first US$100 to start the fund for the O. E. S. Home, the work beginning in 1895, and served on the Home Board for two years. Pitkin's O.E.S. service lasted over four decades. Till the later years, the salary paid in her office was not more than would be paid to a clerk. Politics In 1888, she was elected postmaster of the Illinois House of Representatives, and after faithfully serving that body, she was elected in the following year to a similar position in the Illinois Senate. The members of the 36th General Assembly presented her a watch, and in further recognition of their appreciation of her ability and efficiency, gave her a flattering recommend, to which the name of every member of that assembly was signed. Women's activism On behalf of the O.E.S., she was involved in the World's Congress of Representative Women, which accorded to Pitkin a day given wholly to an O. E. S. program, May 16, 1893. In 1902, Pitkin was honored by an appointment on the Board of Directors of the World's Fair Fraternal Building Association held in the city of St. Louis, Missouri, and her experience and judgment aided greatly in this work. She was asked again to lend her aid and presence at the Lewis and Clark Exposition in Portland, Oregon, in 1905, where her large acquaintance and Eastern Star knowledge added to its success. She was also an earnest and devoted member of the Woman's Relief Corps, serving as president of the Illinois organization. Personal life Pitkin's family consisted of her daughter, Mrs. H. Judson Decker, and two granddaughters, Lorraine and Maude. She died in 1922.

He expanded the firm into ship building and merchant banking, and founded the Banque Worms. Family The grandfather of Hypolite Worms, also called Hypolite Worms (1801‚Äì77), was from a Jewish merchant family from Sarrelouis. He married Sephora Goudchaux, daughter of a banking family from Lorraine. In 1848 he started to import coal to Rouen and Dieppe from Cardiff and Newcastle, and by 1851 he was said to be the largest importer of English coal in France. He bought his first ships in 1855, and in the 1860s set up coaling stations at Port Said and Suez that would become an effective monopoly on the supply of coal to ships using the canal. After he died in 1877 Worms et Cie kept its leading position in the coal trade under various members of the Worms and Goudchaux families, and ventured into the petroleum trade. Hypolite Worms was born on 26 May 1889 in Paris. His parents were Lucien Worms, son of the first Hypolite Worms, and Virginie Houcke. His mother was Christian, and he was baptised. He married Gladys Mary Lewis-Morgan, an Anglican. Their daughter married the son of the English ambassador to Japan. Her son, Nicolas Cleaves-Worms, became managing associate of MM Worms and Co., which remained independent after the Banque Worms was nationalized in 1982. Early years (1910‚Äì39) Hypolite Worms joined Worms et Cie in 1910 at the age of 21. He became a managing partner and effective head of the organization on 1 January 1916. Hypolite Worms continued the coal and shipping businesses but also moved into building ships and banking. In 1928 Worms & Cie had three branches: coal trading, shipping and ship building. Hypolite Worms decided to found a fourth branch for banking, the Services bancaires (Banking Services). Raymond Poincar√© had stabilized the franc on 25 June 1928, and the banking industry was entering what promised to be a prosperous period. Worms was impressed by English merchant banks, and developed the banking arm of his company along the same lines. It mostly used its own capital and reserves rather than taking deposits, and at first primarily financed other arms of the Worms business, although it soon moved into financing trade. Banking Services began to establish privileged relationships with northern Europe. Gabriel Le Roy Ladurie was appointed head of the department in June 1936. By 1939 Banking Services had solid arrangements with banks in London and New York. World War II (1939‚Äì45) After the outbreak of World War II, in November 1939 Hypolite Worms was placed in charge of the French delegation to the Franco-English Maritime Transport Executive in London. After the Fall of France in June 1940 he took responsibility for transferring the French merchant fleet to Britain, and on 4 July 1940 signed what was called the \\"accords Worms\\". He then returned to France via Portugal and Spain, and reported to Admiral Darlan in Vichy. The French ordinance of 18 October 1940 placed companies whose leaders were not considered true Arians under state control. Although Michel Goudchaux at once resigned from his position as associate manager, and although Hypolite Worms was born of a Christian mother and had been baptized at birth, Worms & Cie was placed under state supervision. Olivier de S√®ze of the Bank of France was made provisional administrator and a German banker was appointed to the board. Hypolite Worms became the target of violent attacks in the pro-German press. Post-war (1945‚Äì62) After the liberation of France the principals of Worms & Cie were investigated for possible collaboration with the Germans. Hypolite Worms and Le Roy Ladurie were arrested on 8 September 1944. They were released on 21 January 1945, and charges dismissed on 25 October 1946. The inquiries found that Worms & Cie Banking Services had only played a small and involuntary role in financing for the Germans. Hypolite Worms died on 28 January 1962 at the age of 72.

A pilot episode was shown on BBC One in February 2016, from which a whole series was commissioned and then broadcast in 2017. Premise The mockumentary focuses upon the day-to-day running of a hospital set on the coast of Yorkshire. Tom Binns, the co- creator, co-writer and main star of the programme, has said it is based on where he is from on the Yorkshire/Derbyshire border but also on the coast as it is fictional. The programme shows the main characters as a hospital manager and her assistant, a porter, a DJ and his assistant and a hospital chaplain and his organist. Each week a guest star would fulfil a prominent role as part of the main back story to the episode.

The single was released in America and Belgium only. The song was written by lead vocalist Noddy Holder and bassist Jim Lea, and produced by Chas Chandler. Background The material on Old New Borrowed and Blue was recorded amid the band's touring and promotional activities in late 1973. It also marked the return of drummer Don Powell to the studio after suffering a near-fatal car crash in July, which briefly threw the band's existence into doubt. In America, the album was titled Stomp Your Hands, Clap Your Feet and released in February 1974. That same month, the lead single in America, \\"Good Time Gals\\", was released but failed to chart. \\"When the Lights Are Out\\" followed as the second single in May and was released to coincide with the band's American tour of May‚ÄìJune. However, it also failed to gain any commercial success. In a fan question and answer session with Lea in 2017, he revealed his wish that the song had been given a full single release in the UK and elsewhere: \\"After \\"Merry Christmas Everybody\\" and the massive success of 1973 it was hard to find a follow up quickly. I wanted \\"When the Lights Are Out\\" (not because I sang it), but I recorded it as The Dummies and it was play-listed at Radio 1 and record of the week on Radio Luxembourg too.\\" \\"When the Lights Are Out\\" was the first Slade song to feature Jim Lea on lead vocals, with Noddy Holder joining in on the chorus.Old New Borrowed and Blue - 2006 Salvo remaster booklet liner notes In a 1974 interview for readers of 19 magazine, Holder jokingly commented of the track: \\"There's nothing like a good singer and Jimmy's nothing like a good singer.\\"Slade Talk To \\"19\\" Readers - Track 17 on Salvo remaster Speaking to Ken Sharp in 1999, Lea recalled: \\"I've never considered myself to be a singer and was never considered by anyone in the band to be a singer. But it was Nod's idea that I should sing that, 'cause he said \\"Look, why don't you sing it?\\" and some people said I sounded a little bit like John Lennon, you know, my hero. It's triple tracked because my singing's so bad! I triple tracked it to try and even the tuning out a little bit.\\"Jim Lea interview - Ken Sharp - 1999 Release \\"When the Lights Are Out\\" was released on 7\\" vinyl by Warner Bros. Records in America only, but also in Belgium as an import. The B-side, \\"How Can It Be\\", was written by Holder and Lea, and also included on Old New Borrowed and Blue. In addition to the main US release, a promotional version was also issued, containing \\"When the Lights Are Out\\" on both sides of the vinyl, one in mono and the other in stereo. The Belgian release was merely the imported US release, but housed in a Belgian-printed picture sleeve.

This disk, however, is a bit of a departure. Not as hard, yet still rocking, this is a perfect Top 40 outing that many stations will find more desirable than any of their previous efforts. Good hook and even more attention to the music, Slade looks finally to have matured and seems ready to break out big in America.\\"Cash Box newspaper - 11 May 1974 - Singles Reviews - page 20 In a review of Old New Borrowed and Blue, New Musical Express considered the song as \\"one of the LP's prime contenders for single status\\". They said of the song: \\"Jimmy Lea sings \\"When the Lights Are Out\\" in a softer version of the Holder roar, and makes a nice job of it. The band should use him more, if only for contrast.\\" Billboard said: \\"Bassist Jimmy Lea also gets a chance to sing on the pretty \\"When the Lights Are Out\\".Billboard magazine - Top Album Picks - 9 March 1974 - page 58 In a retrospective review, Dave Thompson of AllMusic commented: \\"\\"We're Gonna Raise the Roof,\\" \\"When the Lights Are Out,\\" and \\"My Town,\\" too, offer little that Slade wasn't already well renowned for and that, perhaps, was what the band members were thinking as well. The glitter-soaked thunderclap was old news now; they could write those rockers in their sleep.\\" He also highlighted the song as an AMG Pick Track. Classic Rock described the song as a \\"mouth- watering commercial, hard rock nugget\\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine, in an AllMusic review of Cheap Trick's The Latest, described the song as an \\"overlooked Slade gem\\". Ian Fortnam of Teamrock selected the song as one in his article \\"10 Slade songs that prove they're bigger than just Xmas\\". He said: \\"A certain congruence of style between Holder/Lea and Lennon/McCartney has been remarked upon before, but nowhere is it more clearly demonstrated than when Jimmy Lea steps forward to take a lead vocal on this easily overlooked album track from spring '74's Old New Borrowed and Blue. Cheap Trick covered it on 2009's The Latest where it fitted perfectly as one of the best Cheap Trick songs Cheap Trick never wrote.\\" Cover versions *In 1978, American singer Bob Segarini recorded a version of the song for his album Gotta Have Pop. It was also released as a single in Canada in November that year. *In 1979, Jim Lea would record his own version of the song with his brother Frank as part of his side-project The Dummies.

It is an element of the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development.  Operations  For suppression purposes, the BCWS divides the province of British Columbia into six regional fire centres, each of which is responsible for managing wildfire response within its boundaries. These fire centres are in turn divided into local fire zones. Provincial level activities are managed by the Provincial Wildfire Coordinating Centre in Kamloops and the BCWS Headquarters in Victoria.  Crews  The BC Wildfire Service employs four types of wildfire suppression crews throughout the province. All BCWS firefighters are classified as Type 1 firefighters. * Initial Attack (IA) Crews Three-person crews which are usually the first to arrive to a newly reported wildfire. IA Crews respond to the majority of fires in British Columbia. * Rapattack Crews Rappel-capable crews which respond to fires in inaccessible terrains. Rapattack firefighters rappel from a helicopter in close proximity to a fire. They may also construct helipads so that larger amounts of equipment and personnel may be brought to the fire. * Parattack Crews Also known as smokejumpers, these firefighters parachute from fixed-wing aircraft, which allows the rapid deployment of several firefighters over great distances. Parattack crews are most utilized in the northeastern part of British Columbia. * Unit Crews 20 person crews specializing in larger fires that have grown beyond initial attack capabilities. Unit crews oftentimes live in temporary fire camps and work for up to fourteen days at a time. Once a fire is deemed contained, Type 2 firefighters, also known as contract crews, may be used to \\"mop-up\\" and patrol a fire to extinguish any remaining fire activity. All Type 2 firefighters in British Columbia are private contractors retained by the provincial government.  Aviation  The agency pioneered the use of Automated Flight Following for fire helicopters in the 1980s.

It aired on Fox in the United States on October 1, 2017, and is written by Aaron Lee and directed by James Purdum, Dominic Bianchi, and Peter Shin, with James R. Bagdonas directing the live-action chicken fight. Guest voices include Louis C.K., Jonathan Kite, Bill Maher, Miriam Margolyes, Christina Pickles, Modern Family cast members Ty Burrell, Julie Bowen, and Sof√≠a Vergara, and a live-action cameo from Asa Akira. Plot As the Griffin family is watching Vedder Call Saul, Peter is displeased that Family Guy hasn't won a single Emmy since it debuted in 1999, and the crossover with The Simpsons didn't help. Lois even mentions that they shouldn't do another episode with The Simpsons because it only helped the other show (or made Family Guy look bad when fans condemned The Simpsons for agreeing to the crossover at all). He then embarks on his own For Your Consideration campaign by spoofing other shows who won the award. Peter first aims at winning an Emmy for Best Comedy, which includes Modern Family, Girls, and Transparent and other comedy traits (with two being Sof√≠a Vergara taking Lois' role, Lois portraying a delivery person, Chris acting like Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory, a pass-by from Tracy Morgan, and Peter playing transgender). He even encounters Louis C.K. outside the Drunken Clam, where the comedian says he's glad his career has cooled off just enough that Peter was able to get him to make a cameo on the show. When Peter goes into the bar, everyone greets him in the style of Norm Peterson from Cheers. After that, Peter is sent to the hospital, where Dr. Hartman comes in to change his sex. Peter insists that it was just a gag, and Hartman continues on anyway. His final narration on that has him stating \\"And that's how I became your mother.\\" The comedy submission doesn't work, as the Emmy producers dislike it and say that Family Guy now owes them an Emmy. Brian insists on moving to Best Drama in which spoofs of Breaking Bad, The Wire, Homeland, The Sopranos, Orange Is the New Black, House of Cards, and Game of Thrones follow. The sketch ends with the Night King about to attack Peter with an undead dragon. It is watched by two people and a dragon, who feels that he and his fellow dragons were accurately represented. The drama submission also doesn't work, because a message from the Emmy board tells Peter to stop, but he refuses and continues trying to make more Emmy spoofs including stunts, documentaries, reality shows and castings in a comedy series - enough for him to do some interaction with a live-action Asa Akira. After doing a spoof of The Daily Show, he is called aside by Bill Maher, who states that Family Guy will never win an Emmy, due to the fact that the same shows other than it win the award every year. Taking Maher's tip-off, Peter goes to the library, where he sees a lot of names and shows that won Emmys. Peter returns home to tell Lois about it where she reveals that they have a selection of Emmy winners visiting them: Alec Baldwin, Julie Bowen, C.K., Tina Fey, Kelsey Grammer, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Shonda Rhimes, and Aaron Sorkin. They pick at the show's faults such as plagiarizing other media, that many minority characters are voiced by white actors, the contrived episode wrap-ups and that the show is just a complete waste of time. Realizing that Family Guy will never win an Emmy, Peter finally gives up and is happy to have his family as his award. An email that Peter reads from a chemotherapy patient mistakes the show for The Simpsons when the fact that the fan mentioned how he liked the episode where Homer stays home from church. Peter ends the episode with a live-action sequence of Ty Burrell fighting and strangling a rubber chicken. The hand of an unidentified man presents him with an Emmy Award, but Burrell tells the man that he doesn't have any more room in his house for it. Reception The episode had an audience of 2.80 million viewers. Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave the episode a 7.6/10. He noted \\"Like The Simpsons, Family Guy kicked off its new season with a themed episode tonight. Surprisingly, of the two it was Family Guy that emerged the clear winner. This series tends to have a solid track record whenever it gets unusually meta, and 'Emmy-Winning Episode' was no exception\\". Schedeen praised the first and second acts; however, he criticized the third act.

The group employs more than 10,000 people and generated revenues of EUR 3.3 billion in 2018.  Company history  Schmolz + Bickenbach was founded in 1919 by Arthur Schmolz and Oswald Bickenbach in D√ºsseldorf as a steel trading company. Since 1937, the company has been running under the double name. In 2003, the family-run Schmolz + Bickenbach Group, which had previously been involved in steel processing and steel trading, through the leadership of Micheal Storm, took over the majority of the shares of Swiss Steel AG, a listed steel producer. Swiss steel was founded in Emmenbr√ºcke in 1996. It was established as a holding company after the merger of the former competitors \\"Von Moosstahl\\" and \\"Von Rollstahl\\", two Swiss steel producers. It was then joined by Von Moos Stahl AG's companies, Steeltec AG, the logistics company Panlog AG based in Emmenbr√ºcke and Stahl Gerlafingen AG, based in Gerlafingen, which had emerged from Von Roll Holding. In the following two years, the German steel producers Edelstahlwerke S√ºdwestfalen (2004) and Edelstahl Witten-Krefeld (2005) were taken over. The two companies merged into \\"Deutsche Edelstahlwerke\\" in 2007. In 2006, 65 percent of the shares in Stahl Gerlafingen AG were sold. This was done in order to lead into a concentration on the production of high-quality steels in the long-product segment. In 2006 the French Ugitech Group, based in Ugine, was taken over. In 2006, most of the operative parts of the parent company Schmolz + Bickenbach KG were integrated into Swiss Steel AG and renamed to Schmolz + Bickenbach AG. In 2007, the Swiss subsidiary, Von Moosstahl, was then renamed Swiss Steel. At the beginning of February 2007, the American A. Finkl & Sons Group, based in Chicago, was purchased. With this move, the Schmolz + Bickenbach Group became the world's largest producer of tool steel. The Group is also the world leader in the production of stainless long products. Within the scope of a capital increase, the shares of Schmolz + Bickenbach KG to the AG, fell in 2010 from 70% to almost 40%. On 23 December 2011, Michael Storm resigned as President of the Board of Directors, after the discovery that Storm had misappropriated some EUR 1.5 million (approximately CHF 1.83 million). In 2013, the company sued Michael Storm for a repayment of EUR 9 million plus EUR 1.4 million in interest. In December 2012, high financial liabilities, which had risen to just under EUR 903 million in connection with company acquisitions and a difficult steel economy, led to a tense financial situation. In spring 2013, a possible capital increase was announced following a group loss of EUR 157.9 million for the 2012 financial year. Benedikt Niemeyer (CEO) and Axel Euchner (CFO) left the company in June 2012 due to dissonances. The family shareholders around Micheal Storm, which held almost 40% of the shares in spring 2013, initially rejected a capital increase since they had reduced their share. Schmolz + Bickenbach KG allied itself with Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg and sold a share of 25.3% of its company to Renova Group, through its subsidiary Venetos. This sale resulted in a mandatory offer to the remaining shareholders in August 2013, the price of which was below the market price, and therefore only received a very low acceptance rate. Nevertheless, the company agreed with the new major shareholder. An unusual General Meeting of Shareholders in September 2013, approved a capital increase of EUR 430 million for Venetos and Schmolz + Bickenbach KG in accordance with their company's participation, and reassignment of the Board of Directors. In the summer of 2015, the Group separated itself from a part of its distribution companies in Germany, Austria and Benelux. In October, Schmolz + Bickenbach relocated the Group headquarters from the existing headquarters in D√ºsseldorf to the new headquarters in Lucerne. In February 2018, Schmolz + Bickenbach acquired the French steel manufacturer Ascometal. A capital increase was announced in October 2019.  Shareholders  Schmolz + Bickenbach is listed on the SIX Swiss Stock Exchange. BigPoint Holding AG from Martin Haefner holds 49,6 %, Liwet Holding AG 25%. A further 25,4 % of the shares are spread out among others. Schmolz + Bickenbach Beteiligungs GmbH holds no more shares of the company.

She introduced gymnastics into the educational curriculum and co-founded Denmark's first kindergarten. Biography Born on 5 March 1845 in Copenhagen, Erna Emilie Louise Drachmann was the daughter of the physician Andreas Georg Drachmann (1810‚Äì92) and Vilhelmine Marie St√¶hr (1820‚Äì57). She was the elder sister of the celebrated poet and dramatist Holger Drachmann with whom she maintained a close relationship. She would have followed in her father's footsteps as a doctor but as a woman was not admitted to medical school. Instead, she adopted her father's interest in gymnastics, studying both theory and practice completed by a study trip to Paris in 1866. She was later trained as a schoolteacher at N. Zahle's School. In the late 1860s, she taught at a gymnastics institute for girls which had been founded by her father. At the same time, she became engaged to Niels Juel-Hansen (1841‚Äì1905, who was studying as a lawyer but who shared her interest in education. They were both attracted by Friedrich Fr√∂bel's ideas on children's education. In 1871, she and her fianc√© created Denmark's first kindergarten based on Fr√∂bel's approach. Shortly afterwards they married. They went on to found a mixed school for young boys and girls in 1876 but their modern approach did not prove popular with the parents. In 1883, as a result of financial difficulties, they closed the school. Their marriage also ran into difficulties, leading to a separation in 1894. This caused Juel-Hansen considerable sorrow as she had always hoped for a happy, modern marriage in which both parents could share the task of raising their four children. After the kindergarten closed, she decided to concentrate on a new project, this time founding a gymnastics college in 1884, taking full account of Pehr Henrik Ling's pioneering work in Sweden on teaching physical education. She also began writing, covering the difficulties experienced by young people as a result of their upbringing as well as the struggles faced by women in married life, based on her own experiences of defeat. While her first novel Mellem 12 og 17 (Between 12 and 17), published in 1881 under the pen- name Arne Wendt, covers the teenage fantasies of young women in a rather rudimentary way, her En ung Dames Historie (A Young Woman's Story, 1888) is a much more daring and gripping account of a woman's early encounters with romance. With its realistic accounts of a girl's erotic experiences with an artist, it proved very popular. The problems faced by adult women as they grow older are behind her later novels, Terese K√¶rulf (1894) and Helsen & Co. (1900), both partly biographical. Juel-Hansen was also involved in promoting women's rights, becoming an active member of both the Danish Women's Society and Studentersamfundet (Students Union) in 1883. In 1905, she became one of the first women to join the board of Copenhagen's Liberale V√¶lgerforening (Liberal Voters Association). Erna Juel-Hansen died in Hornb√¶k on 39 November 1922.

Biography  Born in Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne, Joseph Touchemoulin, the son of the town's oboist Louis Touchemoulin and his wife Jeanne Roulot, had been employed as a violinist at the court of the elector of Cologne of Bavaria in Bonn from a very early age. This enabled him to study in Italy, where he was taught by Giuseppe Tartini who was also the one who inspired Touchemoulin to develop his compositional skills. He returned to Bonn in 1753, where his salary was augmented by 1,000 fl. in March 1753. The following year, one of his symphonies was performed successfully at the Paris Concert Spirituel on 15 August. On 4 February 1761, he was appointed ma√Ætre de chapelle in Bonn, instead of the more senior singer Ludwig van Beethoven (1712‚Äì1773), the grandfather of the composer of the same name, contrary to customary practice. But only two days later the Elector died. The halving of the musician's salaries by his successor Maximilian Friedrich von K√∂nigsegg-Rothenfels prompted Touchemoulin to resign and to take up a position at the court of the princes of Thurn and Taxis in Regensburg that same year, which he retained until the end of his life - first as violinist (as a colleague of Franti≈°ek Xaver Pokorn√Ω), then as princely Kapellmeister after the death of Joseph Riepel in 1782. He died in Regensburg on 25 October 1801 where his tombstone is preserved in the Saint Emmeram's Abbey.La tombe de Joseph TouchemoulinJoseph Touchemoulin (1727-1801), un musicien bourguignon retrouv√©, article by Patrick Ayrton appeared in the journal Images de Sa√¥ne-et-Loire n¬∞ 160 December 2009 (pages 20 to 24).

One of the caves in Manmodi has an epigraph mentioning the Western Satrap Nahapana bearing the title of Mahakshatrapa (Great Satrap).  Description  The Manmodi hill lies south from Junnar, at a distance of about a 3 km. It contains three groups of excavations, the second of which is nearest to the road, and the first a considerable way along the north-west face of the hill, near where it turns to the north-east. The caves are classified in three groups, also having specific names: * Bhutalinga (‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§ ‡§≤‡•á‡§£‡•Ä) group, with an inscription by a Yavana donor. * Amba-Ambika (‡§Ö‡§Ç‡§¨‡§æ-‡§Ö‡§Ç‡§¨‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ) group * Bhimasankar (‡§≠‡•Ä‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∂‡§Ç‡§ï‡§∞) group, southeast of Manmodi hill, with the inscription of Ayama, minister of Nahapana in 124 CE.  Bhutalinga group of caves  = The Chaitya = Manmodi Chaitya Cave. Woodcut from Photograph, 1880. Dedicatory inscription by the Yavana donor. These caves are the most western caves in the Manmodi group (). The principal cave here is an unfinished Chaitya-cave. The door is nearly the whole width of the nave, and it has apparently had a small semi-circular aperture or window over it, but the lintel is broken away. This arch of the window, however, is not adjusted to the arch of the roof inside, which is much higher, nor does it occupy the relative position in the great arch on the fa√ßade assigned to the window in later examples at Ajanta, Nasik, etc. The Chaitya-hall on the Manmodi hill is said to belong to the period of the Western Satrap ruler Nahapana, as is the case for the Great Chaitya at Karla Caves. The Chaitya today. The fa√ßade of the Chaitya Hall was donated by a Yavana, according to the inscription on the central flat surface of the lotus (yavanasa Cha·πÅdƒÅna·πÅ deyadhama gabhadƒÅ[ra]). Detail of the \\"Ya-va-na-sa\\" portion in old Brahmi script: 12px12px12px12px, circa 120 CE.Religions and Trade: Religious Formation, Transformation and Cross-Cultural Exchange between East and West, BRILL, 2013 p.97 Note 97 Over the opening of the entrance, the place usually occupied by the window is divided fan-wise into seven petal- shaped compartments with a semi-circular centre, round the edge of the inner member of which is an inscription, in one line, of Brahmi characters. This is an inscription by a Yavana donor, appearing on the central flat surface of the lotus over the entrance: it mentions the erection of a hall-front for the Buddhist Samgha, by a Yavana donor named Chanda: In the middle compartment of the larger semi-circle is a standing female figure with a lotus flower on each side, the next compartments have elephants standing on lotus flowers and holding water-jars, as so often represented beside the figures of Sri or Lakshmi on old Buddhist works. In the next compartment on each side stands a male figure, his hands joined over or in front of his head, doing puja towards the central figure; and in the two outer spaces are females in similar attitudes, with a lotus flower and bud beside each. The style of art in which the figure of Sri Lakshmi is here represented is so similar to that employed for the same purpose at Bharhut, that there can be little doubt that they are of about the same age. The material, however, in which they are executed, and their purposes are so different, that it would be impossible, from that alone, to say which of the two is the earliest. Over and outside these the fa√ßade of the great arch projects, with ribs in imitation of wooden rafters under it. On each side the finial is a male figure: that on the left holds a chauri and has wings, and some animal's head above his jaunty turban; the other holds some object in his right hand, and behind each shoulder are two snake-heads with their tongues hanging out. Right and left of these are dagobas in high relief, but roughly formed; and on the right of the arch is a tree with objects hanging in it, but it has never been quite finished, parts being only outlined. Inside of the Chaitya. On the projecting frieze over all are seven Chaitya-window ornaments, with smaller ones between their finials, and two on the faces of each jamb. Inside the cave, three octagonal pillars on the right side are blocked out, as is also the dagoba, but without the capital. There is a horizontal soft stratum in the rock, which has probably led to the work being relinquished in its present unfinished state. This is very much to be regretted, as the whole design of this cave is certainly the most daring, though it can hardly be called the most successful, attempt on the part of the early cave architects to emancipate themselves from the trammels of the wooden style they were trying to adapt to lithic purposes. At Barabar in the Lomas Rishi they only introduced elephants and trellis work, which we know from the Sanchi gateways were probably executed in wood and could easily have been so introduced. It would, however, have been very difficult to execute such a seven-leafed flower as this, in pierced work, even in wood, but it was an artistic mistake to introduce it above the real constructive opening, on a false front, as is done in this instance. The system here begun was afterwards carried to an extreme issue in the Gandhara monasteries, where figures were introduced everywhere, and the architecture only used as a frame such as we employ for pictures. Though its employment here is a solecism, this bas- relief is one of the most interesting pieces of sculpture for the history of the art, to be found in the whole range of the western caves. = Buddhist cells = The Buddhist cells with individual Chaitya-window arches. Higher up the rock, on the east or left side of this, are four cells with neatly-carved fa√ßades, each door having a Chaitya-window arch over it, projecting about 15 inches; and between the arches are two dagobas with chhatris in half relief; while over the shoulder of each arch is a smaller one as an ornament, and the Buddhist-rail pattern along the tops. There is one plain cell beyond these, and under the five are some others filled up with earth; while rather higher up on the east are four more. Under these latter is a vihara with two cells in the back and two in the left or east side, but the front is gone. It communicates by a passage with another to the west of it, nearly filled up with mud, and west of the Chaitya-cave are two small cells high up in the rock.  Amba-Ambika group of caves  The Amba-Ambika group of caves. Near the south-east end of the hill is the second group, consisting of an unfinished Chaitya-cave and a number of ruined cells and viharas (). This Chaitya-cave is somewhat on the plan of the Bedsa one, that is, it has two octagonal columns in front, supporting the entablature above the great window. These columns are of the style occurring at the Ganesa Lena, with water-pot bases and capitals; but otherwise this cave is quite unfinished: the aisles have not been commenced; the capital of the dagoba is roughly blocked out, and portions of a square mass of rock from which to hew out the dome of it; but a great fault in the rock at the back of the cave seems to have stopped further operations. The Chaitya hall. Excavation was halted due to a major fault in the rock, that fills the cave with water in the rainy season. The front is quite rough, but, if finished, would probably have been similar to the Bedsa Chaitya cave. It is almost covered with inscriptions, but from their positions and the roughness of the surfaces on which they are carved, it may naturally be inferred that they are only the work of visitors, perhaps long after the work was relinquished. Few of them can be made out with any certainty. The cave faces north by east, and the floor is much filled up with mud. At the east side of it is a cell, also deep in earth, in which is a dagoba, the chhatri or umbrella carved on the roof, but the staff has been broken, evidently with a view to convert it into the usual Saiva emblem. = Jainism Cells = Paintings of Tirthankara in a cell of the second level. There are portions of other cells, and a fragment of an inscription beside some modern steps leading up to five cells above. The two at the west end are converted into one by cutting away the partition, and on the walls are three defaced figures perhaps of Jain figures. This is dedicated to the goddess Ambika also the sasanadevi or patron goddess of the 23rd Tirthankara Neminatha. Here Brahmans worship the mutilated image of Jain as a Shiva goddess. In the outer wall of another of these cells there have been a standing (Kayotsarga) and a sitting figure of Tirthankara, but these are now almost obliterated.

The third group is round a comer of the hill to the south-east of these last, and at a considerably higher level, some of them almost inaccessible (). The first reached is a recess over a cell or cistern, with an inscription: A little beyond this, on the left side of a recess over the side of a water cistern, is another inscription in three lines, of which, however, the first letters are obliterated; still it is possible make out that it was [constructed by] \\"Ayama, the minister of Mahakshatrapa Svami Nahapana.\\" This inscription bears a Saka era date of year 46, which is 124 CE. The inscription is located in the fourth excavation on the eastern side of Manmodi Hill, in Cave 7. After passing a cistern and two small recesses, there is another recess with a bench round three sides, on the left side wall of which is the inscription. It is one of the most important of the series as the only one containing a royal name, that of Nahapana, which can also be found at Nasik Caves and at Karla Caves. It is in three lines about 4 feet long. The first few letters in each line are considerably decayed and faint. It reads: Scrambling along the face of a precipice to the south, one can reach first a small vihara without cells or carving, then another cave with two octagonal pillars in the front of the verandah, and two engaged ones at the ends rising from a bench. The door is 5 feet 10 inches wide, and reaches to the roof of the hall, which has been frescoed. The back of the seat or low screen in front of the veranda is carved outside with the rail ornament; the columns are of the usual Nasik pattern, but without animal figures above: over them the frieze projects considerably, and is carved in the style of Cave 4 at Nasik, the ends of the rafters projecting on the lower fascia, and the upper being carved with rail pattern. Over this is a recess some 2 or 3 feet deep, with the Chaitya arch over it, but without any carving. The hall is 33 feet deep, and about 12 feet wide; but at the back stands a mass of rock over 8 feet wide by 5.5 thick, with a squatting figure roughly sketched out on the front of it. This mass is very rotten behind, and at the left side of it is a well of excellent water. The other caves here are small and uninteresting.

He undertook this journey because military Royalism was all but defeated. It was only a matter of days before Oxford (the Royalist First English Civil War capital) would be fully invested and would fall to the English Parliamentarian New Model Army commanded by Lord General Thomas Fairfax (see Third Siege of Oxford). Once fully invested it was unlikely that Charles would be able to leave Oxford without being captured by soldiers of the New Model Army. Charles had been in contact with the various parties that were fielding armies against him seeking a political compromise. In late April he thought that the Scottish Presbyterian party were offering him the most acceptable terms, but to gain their protection and finalise an agreement Charles had to travel to the nearest Scottish army, and that was the one besieging the Royalist held city of Newark. Once he had arrived at his destination he was put under close guard in Kelham House. Prelude Towards the end the First English Civil War, Charles I had continued to contact the parties that were opposed to him, hoping to split them apart and gain politically what he was losing militarily. When it looked likely that the Royalists (Cavaliers) would lose the English Civil War, the Scots, who were then allied with the English Parliamentarians (Roundheads), looked to Cardinal Mazarin, by then the chief minister of France, for help in securing Charles I's position as king, but on terms acceptable to the Scots. In response, Mazarin appointed Jean de Montreuil (or Montereul) as French resident in Scotland. He was to act as a go-between and in doing so he was able to inform Cardinal Mazarin of the political machinations of the various parties in the civil war. Montereul arrived in London in August 1645. Once there he opened a dialogue with English Presbyterians such as the Earl of Holland who were sympathetic to the Scots who too were Presbyterians and formally allied with the Roundheads through the Solemn League and Covenant, but which was disliked by non-Presbyterian Roundheads such as Oliver Cromwell and other religious Independents. There were Scottish commissioners in London who were looking after Scottish interests in the alliance and during talks with them and English Presbyterians, the idea arose that if Charles I were to place himself under the protection of the Scottish army, then the Presbyterian party could advance their interests. Montreuil strived to extract from the Scottish Commissioners to the Committee of Both Kingdoms (the body set up to oversee the Solemn League and Covenant)‚Äîmost of whom were usually located in London‚Äîthe most moderate terms upon which they would receive Charles: accept three proposition touching on the Church, the militia and Ireland, and sign the Covenant. If Charles accepted those terms, they would intercede with English Parliament and banish only five or six prominent Royalists. Montreuil told Sir Robert Moray‚Äîwho was delegated to act for the Earl of Loudoun (High Chancellor of Scotland) in his absence from London and continued to be his delegate upon his return‚Äîthat Charles would not accept those terms; he obtain a modified Scottish offer on 16 March from Sir Robert Moray, in which the Scots would instead be satisfied with a promise from Charles to accept the church settlement which had already been made by the English and Scottish parliaments, and that Charles was to express his general agreement of the Covenant in letters to the two parliaments in which he accepted the church settlement. However, the late Victorian historian S. R. Gardiner suggests that Montreuil did not have a full understanding of Charles' mind. He would promise anything, providing the wording could be so construed by Charles that he could disregard it in the future, and consequently Charles would at this juncture never agree to wording that was an unambiguous legal contract. On 17 March, Montreuil set out for Oxford, the King's headquarters. Along with the offer, he carried intelligence that the English Presbyterians would field an army of 25,000 men to support the Scots if the Independents in the New Model Army tried to oppose the reconciliation. Gardiner wrote: Since he had received Montreuil's communication, the Scots had been out of favour with him, and on 23 March, upon the arrival of the bad news of the defeat of the last Royalist field army at the Battle of Stow-on-the-Wold, he despatched a request to the English Parliament for permission to return to Westminster, on the understanding that an act of oblivion was to be passed and all sequestrations to be reversed. Even had this offer been straightforward, it implied that the central achievement of his opponents in the winning the war should be set aside, and that Charles should be allowed to step back on the throne, free to refuse to assent to any legislation which displeased him. This proposition was rejected by the English Parliament and the Scots. All Charles had achieved by this proposal was to reconcile the factions opposed to him, so thwarting his tactics of division. On 27 March, Montreuil, in the king's name, pressured the Scots for a reply. They informed Montreuil that they would not accept Charles' terms, but‚Äîwithout putting anything in writing‚Äîif he were to hand himself over to the Scottish army, they would protect his honour and conscience. On 1 April, Montreuil wrote to Charles, and engagements were exchanged between them. The French Agent promised Charles for his part promised to take no companions with him except his two nephews and John Ashburnham. On 3 April, Montreuil left London for Southwell (a village near the camp of the Scottish army which, along with a contingent of the New Model Army, was besieging Newark-on-Trent), cites Gardiner's Hist. Of the Civil War. III. 88. arriving at the King's Arms Inn (now the Saracen's Head). Montreuil was delegated by Charles to arrange terms. Montreuil took up lodgings in the large apartment (divided into a dining-room and bedroom) of the inn to the left of the gateway, while the Scots, possibly on the instigation of Edward Cludd, a leading Parliamentarian, made the palace their headquarters. The hostelry is an ancient one, being mentioned in deeds as far back as 1396. The French Agent is described by Clarendon as a young gentleman of parts very equal to the trust reposed in him, and not inclined to be made use of in ordinary dissimulation and cozenage. cites Claradon's Hist Rebellion 490 On visiting the Commissioners, he found them apparently pleased that the King desired to come to them, and accordingly drew up a document, of which he said they approved, assuring the King of full protection and assistance. Arrangements were to be made for the Scottish horse to receive Charles at Harborough, but not feeling sure of the compact being kept, Charles asked Dr. Michael Hudson (a chaplain and during the war a military scout) to go in his stead. Hudson went to Harborough, and finding no troops there, proceeded to Southwell, where Montreuil told him that the Scots were fearful of creating jealousy with Parliament. In no hopeful mood, and with no tidings except that Scots had promised to send a party of horse to Burton-on-Trent, Hudson returned to Oxford, where further letters from Montreuil were anxiously awaited. In one of these, dated Southwell, 10 April, these words occur: Charles, however, felt he had no alternative. Ashburnham, who was in constant attendance upon him, said in a letter that the king felt he could not refrain from trying to reach the Scots, \\"first on account of his low condition in point of force, and the strong necessity he is brought into, not being able to supply his table. Secondly, because of the little hope he had of succour, and the certainty of being blocked up\\". cites Clarendon's State Papers, II., 196. Charles explained the motives by which he was animated in a letter to the Marquis of Ormond, in which he stated that having sent many gracious messages to Parliament without effect, and having received very good security that he and his friends would be safe with the Scots, who would assist with their forces in procuring peace, he had resolved to put himself to the hazard of passing into the Scots army now before Newark. cites Parliamentary History, xiv., 442. This letter is dated Oxford, 13 April 1646; on 25 April, a letter was received from Montreuil, stating that the disposition of the Scotch commanders was now all that could be desired. The King left secretly on 26 April, accompanied only by John Ashburnham and Michael Hudson, the latter being familiar with the country and able to conduct the little party by the safest route. Journey Charles I in Three Positions by Anthony van Dyck, 1635‚Äì36 At midnight on 27 April, Charles came with the Duke of Richmond to Ashburnham's apartment. Scissors were used to cut the King's tresses and lovelock, and the peak of his beard was clipped off, so that he no longer looked like the man familiar to any who have seen his portraits by Anthony van Dyck. Hudson had persuaded the King that it was not possible to travel directly from Oxford to the Scottish camp outside Newark-on-Trent, and that it would be better to go by a circuitous route, first towards London, then north-east, before turning north-west towards Newark. As a cover for part of the journey, Hudson had an old pass for a captain who was ostensibly to go to London to discuss his composition with Parliament. Dressed in a scarlet cloak, Hudson represented the military bearer.; At 2:00 am, Hudson went to the governor of Oxford, Sir Thomas Glemham, who brought the keys to the gates. The clock struck three as they crossed the Magdalen Bridge. As they approached the start of the London-road, the Governor took his leave with a \\"Farewell, Harry\\"‚Äîfor to that name Charles was now to answer. He was riding disguised as Ashburnham's servant, wearing a montero cap and carrying a cloak bag. cites Disraeli's Commentaries on the Life of Charles I., V., 189. Charles was still hoping to hear from parties in London who would be willing to treat with him, but nothing was heard from that direction. Arriving at Hillingdon, at that time a village near Uxbridge and now in Greater London, the party dallied at the inn for several hours, debating on their future course. Three options were considered. The first was to continue to London, which was ruled out because there had been no word from there. The second option was to head north to the Scots, and a third option was to head for a port and seek a ship for the continent. They chose to head towards Kings Lynn in Norfolk, which if it proved difficult to reach, or if no ships were available, left the Scottish option still open. They proceeded on their way amidst risks and dangers. They passed through fourteen garrisons of the enemy, and in trying to avoid detection, the party had many narrow escapes. noting Disraeli's Commentaries. On 30 April, Charles and Ashburnham decided to halt at Downham Market, in Norfolk, while Hudson went on to Southwell to finalise the arrangements. In his statement to Parliament, Hudson said: \\"The business was concluded, and I returned with the consent of the Scotch Commissioners to the King, whom I found at the sign of the White Swan at Downham. I related all to his Majesty, and he resolved the next morning to go to them\\". Hudson later related the contents (when examined by the English Parliament) of the paper he carried (written by Montreuil, in French, because the Scots would not write down their terms): Gardiner makes several points about this Scottish offer. The first is that the Scots were keen to gain physical possession of Charles, so their wording was on the edge of what they were willing to agree to. However, it is unlikely that the Scots realised just how strongly Charles disliked Presbyterianism (because of his belief that from \\"no bishops\\" it was but a small step to \\"no king\\"), and that although on 23 March he had promised that would agree to a Presbyterian church, he could always fall back on \\"contrary to his conscience\\" when later pressed on this issue. The second point was that not having put their terms in writing, the phrase in the fourth term \\"upon sending a message\\", if indeed that is what Montreuil's French original contained, is open to misinterpretation, as the King could send any message, no matter how indirect (Gardiner gives an example of \\"It had been raining in Oxford\\") and then demand Scottish armed support. It is more likely that the Scots meant \\"the message\\" containing the terms they had previously discussed with the King about Presbyterian becoming the official church in both kingdoms. Before setting out again, as the King's disguise was by then known, it was thought necessary he should change it. So Charles changed into a clergyman's attire, and being called \\"Doctor\\", was to pass for Hudson's tutor. The small party arrived at Stamford on the evening of 3 May and stayed with Alderman Wolph. Charles and his two companions left there between 10:00 pm and midnight on 4 May. Travelling all night, they went towards Allington and crossed the Trent at Gotham. quotes Dr Stukelet's account. Early on 5 May 1646, Charles reached the King's Arms Inn in Southwell, where Montreuil was still residing. Charles stayed there during the morning, leaving after lunch. His arrival caused a stir, and among those who visited him was the Earl of Lothian. Lothian expressed surprise at \\"conditions\\" that Charles thought he had obtained before his arrival and denied them, adding that they could not be responsible for what their Commissioners in London might have agreed to. Lothian presented a series of demands to Charles: the surrender of Newark, that he sign the Covenant and order the establishment of Presbyterianism in England and Ireland, and to direct the commander of the Royalist Scottish field army, James Graham, Marquess of Montrose, to lay down his arms. Charles refused all three requests and replied \\"He that made you an earl, made James Graham a marquess\\".; Among others who arrived at the inn were two of the Scottish Commissioners, who stayed and dined with the King. After lunch, the King went via Upton across Kelham bridge to the headquarters of General David Leslie. General David Leslie was in command of the Scottish army besieging Newark because Alexander Leslie, 1st Earl of Leven, had left for Newcastle-upon-Tyne. When Charles presented himself before General Leslie (his headquarters were located in a large fortified camp which had been given the name Edinburgh), the Scottish general professed the greatest astonishment, because as Disraeli explained: Whether this was or was not true, the Scots persisted in affirming that the arrival of Charles at their headquarters was wholly unexpected. The first letter on the subject was to the English Commissioners at Newark, in which they said they felt it their duty to acquaint them that the King had come into their army that morning, which they said \\"has overtaken us unexpectedly, filled us with amazement, and made us like men that dream\\". Their next letter on the subject was to the Committee of Both Kingdoms in London, and in it they affirmed that W. D. Hamilton was of the opinion that the King's reply at Southwell to Lord Lothian settled the matter of his status: \\"He was no longer regarded as the guest of M. Montreuil, but as their prisoner\\"; and when the interview with David Leslie came to an end, the King was escorted to Kelham House, where he was to reside while staying with the Scottish army at Newark. Immediate aftermath A plan of the Royalist defensive fortifications around Newark-on-Trent; the English Parliamentary and Scottish lines of circumvallation and their fortified encampments; at the siege of Newark in 1646. At Kelham House, Charles was closely watched by a guard dignified by the name of \\"a guard of honour\\" while communications were passing with Parliament and negotiations were proceeding between the English and Scotch Commissioners, who met for the purpose in the fields between Kelham and Farndon, an area called Faringdon. Montreuil, Ashburnham, and Hudson were still there, and from Ashburnham's narrative, it seems that Charles felt it wise to try the effect of a little negotiation on his own account. Ashburnham says \\"the King, recognising his difficulty, turned his thoughts another way, and resolved to come to the English if terms could be arranged\\". Ashburnham took steps to effect this, nominating as negotiators Lord Belasyse, governor of Newark, and Francis Pierrepont (MP), and desiring them to communicate with him, but Lord Belasyse told him, when they conversed together after the surrender of Newark, that Pierrepont \\"would by no means admit any discourse with me in the condition I then stood, the action of waiting on the King to the Scots army rendering me more obnoxious to the Parliament than any man living, and so those thoughts of his Majesty going to the English vanished\\". If Ashburnham had succeeded in his negotiations at Kelham, the whole course of events would have been changed. As it was, the Scots held their prize securely. In the records of the House of Lords, there is a document signed by eight noblemen who had heard of the jealous way in which the King was watched, protesting against \\"strict guard being kept by the Scots army about the house where the King then was\\", and none being suffered to have access to his person without their permission.

The last return trip from Ballaghaderreen at 11:50 was hauled by 0-6-0 steam locomotive 574, and on the return from Kilfree Junction a local band played a farewell. The last train was a special cattle train hauled by B133 leaving Ballaghaderreen at 15:22. Route The route begins at at milepost 112¬Ω () on the Dublin-Sligo line. Branch line trains have their own platform. Freight and special trains from Sligo can enter the branch without reversing. The branch curves off from the main line on an embankment and goes down steeply to milepost 2(). Excellent views of Lough Gara are visible to the south east until reaching Island Road station serving Monasteradin at . This stationed was only opened in 1909. Edmondstown station is reached at milepost 6¬æ () and thereafter line crosses wild boggy country until at the end of the line is reached at . Services The basic passenger service level was three or four round trips per day apart from a period of one round trip per day during the \\"Emergency\\". Between 1947 and closure service decreased to two round trips in the morning and early afternoon. They were designed to connect with services on the main line at . Most services were mixed passenger and freight. There was some limited working of diesel locomotives on special and freight trains with the single ended 121 class being noted; these would be turned on the turntables as required. The 2600 class AEC-engineed railcars were also used on some Sunday specials. Rolling Stock Regular scheduled passenger services on the branch line were always steam operated until the end. The William Fairbairn & Sons built MGWR Class 8 No. 35 Wren was allocated to working the branch from the outset until withdrawal in 1885. Thereafter J26 0-6-0T (GSR 551 Class) seemed to be used up to the 1940s. G2 2-4-0 (GSR 650 Class) took over in the 1950s with 666 and 667 typically used in rotation. From about 1955 until closure the J18 0-6-0 (GSR 573 Class) became the designated locomotive. In later years special trains and freight were sometimes operated by diesel. Incidents During the Irish War of Independence trains were regularly stopped on the branch line with British soldiers and Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) disarmed and goods for Belfast confisticated. In one particularly serious incident in May 1921 a train was hi-jacked and used to shoot at the RIC Barracks in Ballaghaderreen.

She is also a campaigner. Cattan is president of \\"SOS autisme France\\" and honorary president of the campaigning feminist organisation, \\"Paroles de femmes\\" (\\"Women's Words\\") which she established.  Life  Olivia Cattan was born in Paris. She attended a bilingual school and studied piano at the √âcole Normale de Musique de Paris (music conservatory) and at other institutions. She embarked on a career as lyricist-composer and formed a group with Mathieu Ch√©did. Her own musical career was cut short by a motor-bike accident, however. She studied Journalism and Art History at the √âcole du Louvre and launched herself as a journalist, focusing increasingly on certain themes: art and culture, societal issues, women's rights, disability and religion. She wrote for Tribune juive and also contributed regularly to France-Soir, Paris-Match, R√©forme and T√©moignage chr√©tien. She has participated in a number of international conferences in support of peace in the Middle-east, women's rights and at the United Nations.  2006-2012  Olivia Cattan founded the \\"Paroles de femmes\\" (\\"Women's Words\\") organisation in order to promote women's rights. A gala event on 7 March 2007 attracted more than 800 women from all parts of society, and was conducted in the presence of artistic and political leaders including Nicolas Sarkozy. She co-wrote two feminist works: \\"Deux femmes en col√®re\\" (\\"Two angry women\\", 2006) and \\"La femme, la R√©publique et le Bon Dieu\\" (loosely: \\"Woman, the State and the Good Lord\\", 2008), and contributed to further collaborative publications on feminist themes. She created a \\"Pacte f√©minin\\" (\\"Female alliance\\") to develop social and political measures to improve the condition of women, as well as a \\"Charter of the rights of women\\" which was signed by political representatives and a large number of media personalities. However, her priorities were more practical than symbolic. Invited by a journalist to celebrate the removal of the title \\"Mademoiselle\\" (\\"Miss\\") from government forms she retorted that the word \\"Mademoiselle\\" had never bothered her, pointing to a poll that had found its usage ranked bottom in a list of women's concerns, troubling just 5% as against the 84% calling for equal pay. She participated in the Grandes Gueules (loosely \\"Big Mouths\\") radio discussion show and started a series monthly radio broadcasts on Juda√Øques FM, a Jewish local radio service in Paris, using for her talks the title \\"Paroles de femmes\\", and dealing with feminist themes. She created a course module entitled \\"l‚Äô√âgalit√© des sexes et de lutte contre toutes les discriminations\\" (\\"Gender equality and the fight against all forms of discrimination\\") for use in educational establishments, and she also engaged on the theme in detention centres for adolescents identified as having committed rapes. In May 2009 Olivia Cattan received an Ordre des Palmes Acad√©miques award, for her \\"preventive work\\" in schools, from the Minister for Education, Xavier Darcos. She launched the idea of \\"Maisons citoyennes\\" (\\"[Female] citizens' homes\\"), intended for homeless women, notably single mothers and/or victims of violence. The initiative was publicised using a \\"cine-clip\\" featuring the celebrity authors and thespians Lara Fabian, Fiona G√©lin, Bruno Wolkowitch and Marek Halter, all dressed as though homeless, secured public awareness for the project. Monica Bellucci became \\"Ambassador - Paroles de femmes\\" and supported development of the project in France and in Italy. A second \\"cine-clip\\" featuring Emmanuelle B√©art highlighted the growing precariousness of women's lives. Other initiatives included the annual \\"Women's night\\" (\\"La nuit des femmes\\") television talk show on France 3 each 8 March to celebrate women, and the album \\"Libres de chanter, Paroles de femmes\\", produced with popular performers Liane Foly, V√©ronique Sanson, Amel Bent, Nolwenn Leroy and Shym, designed to raise further the profiles of the issues she most cares about. In 2012, as part of his successful campaign for the presidency, Fran√ßois Hollande invited her to become a member of his \\"Committee for the Rights of Women\\".  2012-2014  When her son was 4 or 5 (sources differ) Olivia Cattan discovered that her son was suffering from Autism. She set aside her career as a journalist and other projects in order to head for the Feuerstein Center in Jerusalem in order to obtain better care for her boy. After a month of intensive educational stimulation her son escaped his Mutism and made further progress week by week. After two years mother and son returned to France: for the next two years Cattan was able to work as a specialist teaching auxiliary at her son's school. The experienced awakened her campaigning energies afresh. In 2011 she published a public plea in the news magazine L'Express under the heart rending headline \\"Dis-maman, c‚Äôest quand qu‚Äôon va √† l‚Äô√©cole?\\" (loosely: \\"Hey, Mum. When do I get to go to school?). The statement was signed by numerous high-profile stars of screen and stage, including Jean Dujardin, Sandrine Bonnaire, Francis Perrin and Thomas Dutronc. Through \\"Paroles de femmes\\" she organised a meeting at the National Assembly (French parliament) successfully to oppose \\"Amendment 274 to the Autism Law\\" which had been proposed by a socialist assembly member. (The proposal involved excluding autistic children from mainstream education.) She widened the campaign by establishing \\"SOS autisme\\", to bring together families with a \\"different\\" child. In March 2012 she was honoured with the \\"Medal of the Public Good\\" for her campaigning work on behalf of disadvantaged women and autism sufferers. Olivia Cattan is on record with the view that France is forty years behind neighbouring countries - notably Italy - in its approach to Autism. She continues to apply her considerable expertise of feminist issues and autism to her work as a campaigning journalist.

He was a friend of the poet Friedrich H√∂lderlin.  Life  Youth The house in which he was born in Bad Homburg Born in Homburg vor der H√∂he in 1775, he came from a family of Scottish ancestry whose surname of Sinclair or St. Clair indicates Anglo-Norman origins, linking it to the Clan Sinclair and Castle Sinclair Girnigoe. His father Alexander von Sinclair was a lawyer and had studied from 1733 in JenaSinclair, Alexander Adam von bei: deutsche-biographie.de before moving to Bad Homburg in April 1752 to become tutor to three-year-old Frederick V, Landgrave of Hesse-Homburg. Alexander died in 1778, when Isaac was only three - from then on he was educated with Frederick V's younger children. He studied law from 1792 to 1793 at University of T√ºbingen Johann Kreuzer (ed.): H√∂lderlin-Handbuch: Leben ‚Äì Werk ‚Äì Wirkung. Metzler, Stuttgart/Weimar 2002, , p. 39 and from 1793 to 1795 at University of Jena.  Friendship with H√∂lderlin  H√∂lderlin and von Sinclair first met in May 1794 during their studies in Jena, possibly even in Johann Gottlieb Fichte's philosophy lectures, and together they joined the Harmonistenorden student order. Karl Hoede: Burschen heraus. Zur Erinnerung an den Ursprung der alten Burschenherrlichkeit. Frankfurt am Main 1962, p. 55. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the French Revolution, was close to some of the members of the 'Gesellschaft der freien M√§nner' and participated in one of the then-frequent students tumults. In 1796 von Sinclair entered the civil service of the landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg, but kept in touch with H√∂lderlin, giving him friendly support. H√∂lderlin included von Sinclair in his 1797-99 novel Hyperion as the character Alabanda, whilst his poem An Eduard (To Eduard, 1800-04) elaborated on the revolutionary brotherhood between the two men. After leaving the Gontard household in Frankfurt am Main, H√∂lderlin came to Homburg at the end of September 1798 and stayed until June 1799. He was invited back to Homburg by von Sinclair in June 1804 after the death of Susette Gontard and gained him a post as court librarian. http://www.zeno.org/Literatur/M/H%C3%B6lderlin,+Friedrich/Gedichte/Gedichte+1800-1804/%5BOden%5D/An+Eduard+%5BErste+Fassung%5D Trial To remedy its parlous state finances, Frederick V wanted to set up a state lottery and so engaged the financier Alexander Blankenstein, backed by von Sinclair. However, von Sinclair later changed his mind and tried to expose Blankenstein's deceptions and take action against him - in response Blankenstein accused von Sinclair of treason to Frederick, Elector of W√ºrttemberg, long an enemy of the estates. Blankenstein appealed to a round- table discussion in June 1804 in Stuttgart, also attended by von Sinclair and Christian Friedrich Baz, mayor of Ludwigsburg and one of the radical leaders in W√ºrttemberg's estates general. Blankenstein afterwards claimed that there was a plot afoot to assassinate the Elector at the meeting and start a revolution. Von Sinclair was a subject of Hesse-Homburg not W√ºrttemberg, but the Elector gained Frederick V's permission to arrest him and so he was taken to W√ºrttemberg on 26 February 1805 and imprisoned. A commission tried von Sinclair, Baz and other alleged conspirators. H√∂lderlin was also in danger of being tried but was declared mentally unfit to stand trial. M√ºller, a doctor and court-apothecary from Homburg, stated on 9 April 1805 that Holderlein's madness had worsened, that he repeatedly said \\"I don't want to be a Jacobin!\\" and that he had made serious accusations against von Sinclair. The trial finally showed that some things had been said in anger against the elector at the meeting but no actual revolution had been planned. Von Sinclair was thus released on 9 July 1805 and sent back to Homburg a free man. Soon afterwards, on 11 September 1805, H√∂lderlin was delivered into the clinic at T√ºbingen run by Dr. Johann Heinrich Ferdinand von Autenrieth.Friedrich H√∂lderlin: Selected Poems. Trans. David Constantine. (Newcastle upon Tyne: Bloodaxe, 1990; 2ed 1996) , page 299 Diplomacy, writing and death Plaque at the house Dorotheenstra√üe 6 Von Sinclair represented the interests of Hesse-Homburg and Frederick V on several diplomatic missions, as well as frequently chairing cabinet meetings. In late autumn 1805 he was sent to the Prussian court in Berlin and stayed with his mother in the home of Charlotte von Kalb. His enthusiasm for revolutionary ideals had already cooled and there he came into contact with anti-Napoleonic and anti-French figures. He increasingly advocated a return to the pre-revolutionary Holy Roman Empire led by the nobility. Already strained by the events of the trial, his friendship with H√∂lderlin also came to an end. In August 1806 von Sinclair informed H√∂lderlin's mother that he could no longer look after him, since Homburg was about to be mediatised. On 11 September 1806 its mediatisation was completed, upon which H√∂lderlin was taken to T√ºbingen to assist at the university hospital, then run by Johann Heinrich Ferdinand Autenrieth. Von Sinclair also became much more active as a writer in order to express his new political ideas, contributing to journals and publishing his own poems. In 1806-07, under the pseudonym \\"Crisalin\\", he wrote a play about the Camisards' revolt against French central authority, using it as an exemplar for Germany's own struggle against Napoleon - the same theme was later also taken up by Ludwig Tieck. He also wrote two extensive philosophical works - Wahrheit und Gewi√üheit (Truth and Certainty) in 1811-13 and Versuch einer durch Metaphysik begr√ºndeten Physik (An Attempt at a Physics Grounded in Metaphysics) in 1813. He backed German states fighting Napoleon in 1812-1814, became increasingly religious and was also in contact with Hegel. However, von Sinclair's own poems and philosophical works gained little notice during his lifetime and were forgotten soon after his death. It was partly down to his efforts that the state was un-mediatised at the Congress of Vienna. There he became a member of the nobility association 'Kette'. He was largely able to implement Hesse-Homburg's concerns and wished to fight in the Hundred Days against Napoleon following the latter's escape from Elba on 1 March 1815. His mother died on 20 April 1815, possibly exacerbating his own bad health - he had already suffered several strokes before 1815 and a final one on 29 April that year killed him while he was in a brothel in Vienna. The exact circumstances of his death were uncertain for a long while, since its insalubrious location necessitated a cover-up.  Works * Wahrheit und Gewi√üheit. Erster Band, Berlin 1811.

His father was a prominent familiaris of Palatine Nicholas Garai. After Margaret's death sometimes before 1415, Anthony married to a certain noblewoman Clara.

His sister Catherine was the wife of Nicholas V√≠zaknai.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus Becsegergely, 4. Erd√©lyi (somker√©ki) branch) Nicholas married at first to his distant relative Anne Apafi (first mentioned in 1448, but their marriage possibly took place around 1443 or 1444). After her death, he became the husband of Barbara from an unidentified family, who was mentioned as a widow in 1487. From his two marriages, Nicholas had nine children; his elder son Ladislaus II died without male heirs, while the younger one Stephen II did not survive the childhood.

In 1448, Erd√©lyi simultaneously held the office of vice-voivode and isp√°n of Torda County for a short time, serving alongside other noblemen. Erd√©lyi possibly represented Regent John Hunyadi in this capacity. In October 1457, he was commissioned by Michael Szil√°gyi to occupy some lands of his brother-in-law, Nicholas V√≠zaknai, who became disgraced. It confirmed that the Erd√©lyi brothers remained loyal to the Hunyadi family during the emerging civil war, thus they received land donations after Matthias ascended the Hungarian throne in 1458. Both of them gained tax exemption of \\"sheep fiftieth\\" in 1462, while Nicholas and his adult son Ladislaus also received this privilege in the next year. Matthias transformed the right of customs collection from S√°romberke to Szek√©rberete in March 1467. Through the 1470s, Nicholas was involved in a lawsuit against his brother Stephen over a mill and its customs in Somker√©k, which were unlawfully usurped by Nicholas, in accordance with Stephen's narration. Nicholas argued he built the mill at its own expense in the joint estate. Stephen demanded half of the share and was even willing to pay half the cost of construction, but Nicholas refused it. When Stephen was elected vice-voivode in 1476, using his increased influence, he turned to the Kolozsmonostor Abbey to investigate the case. After their verdict was delivered in favour of Stephen, Voivode John Pongr√°c called Nicholas to return the Stephen's inherited part of the mill to his brother immediately.

She is currently a Professor of photography at Illinois State University in Normal, Illinois. Exhibitions Lee works in clearly defined but conceptually related projects that focus on the subtle but moving affect of Midwestern landscapes, both natural and manmade. For example, the Prairie project turns native grasses into towering specimens by shooting them from a low angle, whereas the Small Mountains project captures the relative grandeur of road salt stockpiles used by the Department of Transportation to de-ice winter roads. A third project, Great Water, is an ongoing chronicle of Lake Michigan shot from the same exact vantage point over a period of five years. Lee has mounted solo museum exhibitions at The Chicago Cultural Center (2001), the Museum of Contemporary Photography, Chicago (2003), the Sioux City Art Center, Iowa (2004), The Notebeart Nature Museum, Chicago (2009), and the Illinois State University Galleries, Normal (2010).

Located about 6 km off the west coast of Belitung and 20 km from the town of Tanjung Pandan, it is the fourth largest island in the province after Bangka, Belitung and Lepar with an area of approximately 113 square kilometers. Administratively part of the Selat Nasik subdistrict of Belitung Regency, it is home to over 4,000 people mostly spread in 3 settlements. Geography The island is located in the Gaspar Strait separating the two large islands. Being the largest island in its archipelagic subdistrict, Mendanau is the second largest island in the strait after Lepar, and is surrounded by a handful of smaller islands, most of which are uninhabited. It borders the Natuna Sea to the north and Java Sea to the south. Due to its small size, the island consists of a long coastline with a forested interior. Mostly having a flat terrain, the highest elevation of the island reaches about 179 m. The coastline of the whole island is fringed by a fringing reef from the Holocene, measuring about 75 km. The monthly average temperature of the island hovers around 26 C throughout the year, and the local climate is classified as tropical rainforest (Af) in the K√∂ppen climate classification. The island comprises the majority of the populations and territory of 3 out of 4 villages within the Selat Nasik subdistrict: Suak Gual, Petaling and Selat Nasik. The subdistrict office is located in the latter. History During the Indonesian Revolution, as NICA forces retook Tanjung Pandan, local members of the TKR engaged them in a brief armed clash which killed several in both sides before the pemuda surrendered unconditionally. Demographics The island's population, combined with a handful of satellite islets, was 4,232 individuals separated into 1,234 households in 2016. Of this, 2,448 were aged between 15 and 55. Throughout 2016, there was a net migration of 25 persons leaving the subdistrict from the island, larger than the net difference between birth and death which was 14 in the same year. Economy As with other islands in the area, agriculture and fisheries dominate the island's economy. In 2016, local fishermen landed 4,601 tonnes of fish. Rubber, pepper and coconut are important cash crops with palm oil plantations beginning to grow within the island. About 30 kilometers of paved road are present in the island. A single public fish market is present in Selat Nasik village, the only one in the subdistrict. A diesel-powered electricity plant, with a total capacity of 1.2 megawatts, is under construction to provide all-day electricity for the island's inhabitants.

She immigrated to the United States from England with her husband Thomas J. Morgan in 1869. She is known for exposing sweatshop conditions in Chicago. From 1888 to 1895 she was the leading woman in the Chicago labor movement.  Early life  Morgan was born to Thomas and Sarah Chambers on June 16, 1850, in Birmingham, England. Her parents were factory workers. She had nine siblings and received little formal education. At age eleven she started working at a mill. She worked ten to sixteen hours per day. In January 1868 she married Thomas J. Morgan, a machinist. In 1869 the couple immigrated to the United States to seek better opportunities. They settled in Chicago where Thomas found work as a brass finisher and machinist, and she took care of their children, Thomas S. and Annie. During the Panic of 1873, Thomas Morgan was out of work for fifteen weeks. The family experienced poverty and hunger. This motivated the Morgans to become labor activists and socialists. The couple had an egalitarian relationship which made it easier for Elizabeth Morgan to become a labor leader in her own right.  Labor organizing  Morgan was a charter member of the Sovereigns of Industry from its establishment in 1874. She became a member of the Knights of Labor in 1881 and the master workman of local chapter 1789. She was the local 1789's delegate at the Chicago Trade and Labor Assembly, a trade union association. According to Ralph Scharnau, from 1888 to 1895 Morgan was the top woman in the Chicago labor movement. In June 1888 she led the effort to established the Ladies' Federal Labor Union No. 2703. She served as the secretary of the Union and was its delegate at the Chicago Trade and Labor Assembly. In four years the Ladies' Federal Labor Union started twenty-three new craft unions for women, all chartered by the American Federation of Labor (AFL). In 1894 she was the only female delegate at the AFL convention and represented the Ladies' Federal Union No. 2703. At the convention she was nominated for the position of First Vice President, the first woman to run for a top AFL position. Although Morgan lost by a vote of 226 to 1865, the support she received showed that AFL members held her in high regard.  Illinois Woman's Alliance  In 1888 the Chicago Times published several articles on the \\"horrendous conditions\\" of sweatshops and factories around the city. Morgan used the articles to gather and unite female socialists, settlement house workers, and trade unionists. Subsequently the coalition founded the Illinois Woman's Alliance. The stated mission of the Alliance was to \\"prevent the moral, mental, and physical degradation of women and children . . . employed as wage workers.\\" The Alliance collaborated with other women's groups and fostered cross-class cooperation. Morgan's work brought her in contact with Florence Kelley and Mary Kenney O'Sullivan, as well as the Cook County Suffrage Association. The Illinois Woman's Alliance determined that 50,000 children between age seven and fourteen worked in sweatshops or roamed the streets during the day. To combat this, the Alliance pushed the Chicago City Council and Chicago Board of Education to appoint additional truant officers, build more schools, and establish funds to help needy children attend school. The Alliance pushed for lowering school age from eight to six and increasing the mandatory number of school weeks from twelve to forty. On July 1, 1889, the Illinois General Assembly voted into law a Compulsory Education Act lowering school age to seven and extending the number of school weeks to sixteen. The Illinois Woman's Alliance continued to push for reform. Subsequently the Board of Education appointed additional truant officers, three female and one male. The Alliance was behind the Commissioner of Health's appointment of five female factory inspectors, as well as a successful campaign to build more schools. The Alliance sponsored a clothing drive for needy children and succeeded in getting an Alliance woman on the Chicago Board of Education.  Social welfare activism  According to Ellen M. Ritter, up until 1891 Morgan had a confrontational style and used vituperation as a tool to push for social reform. She denounced government officials, state legislatures, mayors, major retailers, clergy and judges for failing to protect children, terrible working conditions, and the exclusion of women from school boards. The sweating system had become increasingly entrenched. Over time Morgan realized that denouncing public officials wasn't sufficient to bring about change.  Sweatshops  Morgan brought the grievances of Chicago cloakmakers to the attention of the Chicago Trade and Labor Assembly and advocated for reforming sweatshop practices. In response, the Assembly appointed Morgan and two others to investigate abusive practices and to report under a newly formed Committee on Abuses. Morgan led the efforts, and the newly formed committee published its findings in a report titled The New Slavery: Investigation Into the Sweating System on September 6, 1891. The report described the inhumane conditions in which women and children worked ten to fourteen-hour days. It described the crowded tenements and low wages of sweatshop workers. Morgan revised her confrontational style and used evidence and statistics to convince officials to take action. The Chicago Trade and Labor Assembly printed and distributed 10,000 copies of The New Slavery. The report was influential and on April 5, 1892, Morgan testified against sweatshop practices before a committee of the United States Congress. Morgan used the report, her testimonies, and her advocacy to convince legislators to improve labor laws, to persuade public officials to enforce existing laws, and to mobilize the middle-class to fight the sweating system. In June 1893, the Factory and Workshop Inspection Act, also known as the Sweatshop Act, was passed by the Illinois General Assembly. This was a result of work done by Morgan and Florence Kelley, aided by progressive governor John Peter Altgeld. Section five of the Sweatshop Act restricted employers from working female employees more than eight hours per day, six days per week. Soon after, The Illinois Manufacturers Association was formed with the objective of challenging the Act, especially section five. The Association sponsored lawsuits and on March 15, 1895, in the case William E. Ritchie v. The People, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that section five of the Act was unconstitutional.  Public institutions  Through her involvement with the Illinois Woman's Alliance, Morgan convinced the Chicago City Council to appropriate $25,000 for free public baths. As a committee member of the Chicago Trade and Labor Assembly, she investigated prison labor practices at a penitentiary in Joliet, Illinois. She inspected many public institutions, including the county poorhouse, asylum, and hospital. She also investigated harassment allegations and mistreatment of citizens by the Chicago area police.  Post-activism  In the mid-1890s a rift developed in the Illinois Woman's Alliance between working-class and middle-class delegates. According to Ralph Scharnau, Morgan and the working-class delegates wanted to fix the system through additional paid inspectors, strikes, and political action; whereas the middle-class delegates wanted to rely on charitable works and found strikes \\"too confrontational\\". The combination of the Panic of 1893, the Pullman Strike of 1894, and the internal conflicts of the alliance caused the Illinois Woman's Alliance to fall apart. Morgan tried to form a new coalition to take the Alliance's place, but she could not unite the trade unionists and the socialists of Chicago's activist community. Morgan began to study law when her husband started doing so at the Chicago College of Law in 1893. He opened a law office in the mid-1890s, and she worked at the office as bookkeeper, secretary and notary. For over fifteen years the Morgans used their law practice to protect workers and promote socialism. In early 1910s the couple decided to retire and move to California. On December 10, 1912, their San Diego-bound train crashed at Williams, Arizona, killing Thomas Morgan. Elizabeth Morgan, her daughter Annie, and Annie's children were not seriously injured. Morgan settled outside San Diego, where she lived until her death on February 11, 1944.

He was a founding member of Magraw Gap in 1990 with Danny Knicely and Will Lee. He performs with his wife, bassist Jenny Keel, in The Larry Keel Experience ‚Äì and with other musicians in other groups. He has released over a dozen albums, the latest being Experienced in 2016, which he recorded with his group, Larry Keel Experience. He is married to his bass player, Jenny Keel.  Biography   Early  Larry Keel was born in Manassas, Virginia in 1968. He was taught guitar by his father James Keel, who played banjo. His brother Gary, who played guitar ‚Äî and was twelve years older ‚Äì bought him one when he was seven. He began playing seriously in 1975. Between 1976 and 1985 he performed bluegrass music in a number of \\"semi-professional situations\\", e.g., bluegrass and fiddler conventions, community events, barbecues, etc. In 1986 was hired by Disney as a contract musician to perform at Tokyo Disneyland when he was 18. Returning to the United States, he met bluegrass musicians John Flower and Mark Vann in Fauquier County, Virginia in 1989 and together they began exploring \\"progressive string music\\" in a band they formed named Farmer's Trust. In 1990, Mark Vann (1963‚Äì2002) moved to Telluride, Colorado to help found the \\"Cajun-influenced jam band\\" Leftover Salmon.  Magraw Gap  In 1990, Keel and \\"long-time musical friend\\" Will Lee ‚Äì son of guitarist Ricky Lee from Ralph Stanley's band in the 1970s ‚Äì founded a \\"progressive string band\\" named Magraw Gap. Through 1993 the new group traveled throughout the Shenandoah Valley competing in bluegrass competitions, winning first place at several festivals. In 1993 Keel entered the guitar competition at Telluride Bluegrass Festival and won first place. In 1994, Magraw Gap began touring regularly. In 1995 it won the bluegrass band competition at. Keel won the guitar competition there again in 1996.  Jenny Keel  As Keel relates, Jennifer \\"Jenny\\" Newmark \\"was always a huge supporter of the live music scene in our area of Virginia,\\" but somehow they'd \\"never crossed paths at all those jams and festivals.\\" They met \\"at a little tavern in (his) town\\" where she came to see \\"one of her favorite local bluegrass heroes (Gary Ruley) play\\" in March 1994. When Keel \\"got up on stage with Gary to pick a tune,\\" joining Will Lee who was also sitting in that show, she was \\"blown away\\" by his musicianship, particularly by their take on the David Grisman tune \\"Eat My Dust\\". When Keel walked off stage and passed her in the crowd she told him, \\"That was the best E.M.D. I've ever heard!\\" She concludes, \\"You know how it goes! We traded phone numbers‚Ä¶it sure seemed like love at first sight . .\\" The future Jenny Keel had never played a stringed instrument before she met Keel. \\"I had played piano by ear, had been in competition choral groups in high school (so I knew music theory, just not how to play a guitar or bass),\\" she says. \\"Getting together with Larry and his buddies made my progress in learning the bass fly along quickly.\\"  Larry Keel Experience  In September 1996, Keel split with Magraw Gap and formed the Larry Keel Experience, made up of himself on guitar, his wife on bass, and other musicians he'd worked with over the years. Over the next several years the group would record a number of \\"adventurous albums\\".  Larry Keel and Natural Bridge  In January 2005 Keel created a new band, Larry Keel & Natural Bridge ‚Äî consisting of himself on guitar, his wife Jenny Keel on bass, Mark Schimick on mandolin, and Will Lee on banjo ‚Äì who have toured and recorded extensively together.  Recordings  Starting in 1996, when Keller Williams recorded \\"Buzz\\" with Magraw Gap as supporting musicians ‚Äì and the group released their self-titled CD ‚Äì Keel has been active recording with different musical acts and talents. The Larry Keel Experience 1997 \\"Miles & Miles\\" CD featured 20 special guests. In 1998 Keel worked with Curtis Burch, recent Grammy Award-winner for \\"The Great Dobro Sessions\\" produced by Jerry Douglas and Tut Taylor.

Keel's 2004 \\"Journey\\" CD, recorded at his home in Natural Bridge, included guest artists David VanDeventer, Danny Knicely, Will Lee, Gary Ruley, John Flower, Robert Mabe, Slinky Cobblestone, and Morgan Morrison. In 2009 Larry Keel and Natural Bridge released and almost entirely original \\"Backwoods\\", co-produced by Keller Williams and mastered by Bill Wolf. The album received highly favorable reviews. The Wounded Messenger noted, \\"Perhaps no song better encapsulates the group's sound than the constantly shifting 'Crocodile Man,' which meanders through steep, jazzy terrain often explored by progressive acoustic acts but perfected here.\\" Larry and Jenny Keel's second album with Keller Williams, performing as Keller and the Keels, \\"Thief\\" went No. 1 on Billboard Charts and stayed there for several weeks in a row.

After her marriage and removal to New York, Heaton began newspaper work, serving first as special writer and afterward as a managing editor in newspaper and syndicate offices, until failing health made arduous tasks impossible. When the New York Recorder was started in 1891, she undertook a task never before attempted by any New York daily ‚Äì to run a daily news page dealing with women's movements. Marooned in Sicily by ill-health, the author turned for occupation to the study of peasant life, a study eagerly pursued until it was cut short by her death. Her By-paths in Sicily, could fairly be presented as completed. Early years and education Eliza Osborn Putnam was born in Danvers, Massachusetts, August 8, 1860. She was the daughter of Rev. James W. Putnam, a Universalist minister. She came from Revolutionary ancestry, and was a delicate child. Putnam attended school irregularly when she was young, her education beginning in Danvers and Salem schools. She studied at St. Lawrence University before transferring to Boston University. In 1882, she was graduated from that school, where she was an honor student in the classic tongues, well fitted her for a writer's career. Career In 1882, she married John Langdon Heaton, then associate-editor of the Brooklyn Daily Times. Her newspaper work as an occasional contributor to the columns of that paper began almost immediately. In 1886, she took an office desk and position upon the editorial staff of the Times. For four years, she wrote in nearly every department of the paper, her work appearing mostly on the editorial page and in the special sheets of the Saturday edition, and ranging from politics to illustrated city sketches, for which her camera furnished the pictures. She handled the exchange editor's scissors and did a vast deal of descriptive writing and interviewing. Almost coincident with her engagement upon the Times was her entrance into the syndicate field. Through a prominent syndicate publishing firm of New York City, she sent out an average of three New York letters per week, illustrated from photographs taken by herself, and dealing with men, women and current topics of the day. In September 1888, she took passage from Liverpool to New York in the steerage of the Cunarder Aurania, for the purpose of studying life among the emigrants. She not only landed with her fellow-travelers at Castle Garden, but accompanied them as far west as Chicago in an emigrant train. When the New York Recorder was started in 1891, she undertook a task never before attempted by any New York daily ‚Äì to run a daily news page dealing with women's movements. The experiment was successful and had become recognized as the unique and especially attractive feature of the paper, when she resigned her charge to join her husband on the Providence News, which he established in September of that year. From the first issue of the new daily, Mr. and Mrs. Heaton were associated as joint-editors, and during a long and critical illness, into which Mr. Heaton fell at the end of the first few weeks of its existence, Mrs. Heaton was for months sole responsible editor. Personal life In later year, she passed much of the winter seasons in Taormina, Italy. While there, she was able to do valuable rescue work after the 1908 Messina earthquake. Her By-paths in Sicily, could fairly be presented as completed. Heaton was one of the founders of the Woman's Press Club, a member of the Brooklyn Woman's Club, and a member of Sorosis. She died January 2, 1919, at her home, 131 Westminster Road, Brooklyn, New York, and was survived by her husband, a son, James P. Heaton, a daughter, Mrs. Howard C Root, and two grandchildren.

After rising to high office under his relative, Prince Matei Basarab, he was reconfirmed by Constantin »òerban. He alternated the offices of Spatharios, in charge of the Wallachian military forces, and Paharnic, before being won over by the rebellious Seimeni mercenaries. He issued a claim to the throne in T√¢rgovi»ôte, but controlled only part of the country, and had his seat at Gherghi»õa. In summer 1655, his army was defeated, at »òoplea, by an army of Wallachian loyalists, supported by Transylvanians and Moldavians. Hrizea took refuge in the Ottoman Empire, where he surrendered, and then was retained with his family as hostage by Transylvanian Prince George II R√°k√≥czi. He escaped his captivity at Fey√©rv√°r during the confusion that followed R√°k√≥czi's participation in the Swedish Deluge. Trying to stage his return to Wallachia with a new Seimeni force, he was reportedly kidnapped south of Hermannstadt, and delivered to Wallachia as a prisoner. His supporters were met by Preda Br√¢ncoveanu in Gorj County in September 1657, and were defeated there, possibly following a ruse or a betrayal. The survivors were mutilated or executed in various ways. Hrizea and his retinue were also killed‚Äîeither hanged or broken on the wheel. The Seimeni continued to be involved in intrigues against Prince Constantin, and were eventually pacified by the latter. Some made a brief return to prominence under Mihnea III, part of a warlord alliance gathered around R√°k√≥czi. Biography Rise Hrizea was alive at the time when Wallachia and Moldavia, the two Danubian Principalities, were vassal states of the Ottoman Empire; he was by origin a member of the boyar nobility. Born at an unknown date, he was the only known son of Vistier Dumitra»ôco of BogdƒÉnei (died 1636). His mother Alexandra was the daughter of another Hrizea, the boyar of BƒÉlteni, who served as Vornic.Iona»ôcu, p. 267; Stoicescu, pp. 174‚Äì175, 196‚Äì197 The family took its name from a core estate in Ialomi»õa County, though it also owned land in Oltenia, at Verguleasa.Iona»ôcu, p. 267 Dumitra»ôco is described by scholar Nicolae Iorga as a \\"rural boyar\\",Iorga, p. 197 which indicates that he was not one of the major figures in Wallachian politics. However, as noted by historian N. Stoicescu, his known aristocratic origins contradict claims that Hrizea was an upstart, claims which were first publicized by an anonymous chronicle, Letopise»õul Cantacuzinesc.Stoicescu, pp. 196‚Äì197 Moreover, Hrizea was cousins with the scholar Udri»ôte NƒÉsturel and his sister Elena; the latter was married to Matei Basarab, a Seimeni leader who became the Wallachian Prince in 1632.Stoicescu, pp. 196‚Äì197, 215 Iorga describes the future rebel as a staunch opponent of the regime, one whose servants testified against Prince Matei in front of Ottoman Sultan Murad IV.Iorga, p. 89 This in fact refers to his maternal grandfather Hrizea, who spent the early 1630s as a refugee in Moldavia, eventually reconciling with his lord.Stoicescu, pp. 195‚Äì196 Himself a loyalist, Hrizea of BogdƒÉnei is first attested as a second-class Postelnic at Prince Matei's court in May 1642, and confirmed as one of the Cluceri in 1643; he possibly served as Clucer until March 1650, when he was assigned a Captaincy in the Wallachian military forces.Stoicescu, p. 196 He was Matei's Great Paharnic from February 23, 1651, to June 11, 1653,Stoicescu, p. 196 possibly inheriting this office from his father-in-law, DrƒÉgu»ôin (or Dragomir) of the Deleni boyars.Iona»ôcu, pp. 101, 263, 267 DrƒÉgu»ôin's daughter, named in records as Stana, was the mother of Hrizea's three sons‚ÄîBarbu, Stoica and Matei‚Äîand daughter, Ilina.Iona»ôcu, pp. 263‚Äì265, 267; Stoicescu, pp. 193, 196‚Äì197 On their estate at Verguleasa, the family erected a Wallachian Orthodox church, where he is mistakenly recorded as \\"Rizea\\".Iona»ôcu, pp. 200‚Äì201, 267 A new Prince, Constantin »òerban, selected Hrizea as his general commander, or Spatharios, on April 25, 1654. He served in that position to December 29, returning as Great Paharnic from January 8 to May 11, 1655.Stoicescu, p. 196. See also Paul of Aleppo & Alexandrescu-Dersca Bulgaru, pp. 135, 137, 144 He was also an \\"intimate friend\\" of the new ruler,Iorga, p. 197 whose ascent came with the persecution of Matei Basarab's loyalists. In 1654, the preceding Spatharios, Diicul Buicescul, was mutilated (\\"they carved his nose\\") to prevent his candidacy for the throne. Buicescul then ran away from the country, seeking refuge in the Principality of Transylvania.Nicolae Minei, \\"Po»ôta Magazin Istoric. Un boier oltean\\", in Magazin Istoric, September 1973, p. 97Paul of Aleppo & Alexandrescu-Dersca Bulgaru, pp. 144‚Äì145; Stoicescu, pp. 129‚Äì130; Xenopol, p. 135 As noted at the time by the chronicler Paul of Aleppo, Wallachia's Spatharios (or Serdar), who may have been either Buicescul or Hrizea, was a central figure at the investiture, receiving the army and people's oath on behalf of the Prince.Paul of Aleppo & Alexandrescu- Dersca Bulgaru, pp. 135‚Äì137 Rebellion At this stage, Hrizea became involved in the plot against Prince Constantin, which broke out as a rebellion of the Seimeni (or Servitori) mercenaries, which is traced by historians to February 26 or 27 (Old Style: February 16 or 17), 1655.Cazacu, p. 5; Dem√©ny, pp. 315, 317; Iorga, p. 197; Rezachevici, p. 92 According to various records, Constantin had intended to terminate contracts for mostly Serb troops, already noted for their rebelliousness under Prince Matei. The Seimeni were warned of this by their colleagues in the regular infantry, and proceeded to seek out boyars whom they viewed as responsible for their plight.Dem√©ny, pp. 315‚Äì317; Filipescu, pp. 132‚Äì133 Other detailed accounts suggest that Constantin wanted infantry officers on his side, promising them an increased pay, upon which the footmen sided with the Seimeni.Cazacu, p. 5; Rezachevici, pp. 91‚Äì94 Historian A. D. Xenopol favors a different account: Constantin tried but failed to arrest all of the Seimeni at once, as only 200 of some 1,000 obeyed his order to show up in Bucharest. The boyars, Xenopol writes, were correctly identified as being hostile to the Seimeni, having openly supported the elimination of an expenditure which went to \\"savage\\" and \\"desperate\\" troops.Xenopol, pp. 133‚Äì134, 136 Chronicler David Herman reports that the Seimeni were never subject to a mass arrest, although their commander, Simion, was kidnapped by Constantin's guards.Dem√©ny, p. 316‚Äì317 The enraged mercenaries embarked on an \\"unprecedented bloodletting\\";Rezachevici, p. 94 they \\"entered the boyar homes, chopping them up with their weapons before their wives and young ones, in many places raping their women, pillaging their homes and estates.\\"Costin, p. 191 Various accounts name between 14 and 32 of Wallachia's boyars as murdered in the first stage of the revolt, though tens more were probably also killed at this stage.Dem√©ny, pp. 317‚Äì318 Despite its brutality and its desecration of churches, the revolt was endorsed by the Wallachia's Romanian populace, and was especially popular with the boyars' serfs.Cazacu, pp. 4‚Äì6, 7, 14; Dem√©ny, pp. 312‚Äì314, 317‚Äì321, 327‚Äì329; Giurescu, p. 73 Allied or opportunistic revolts broke out among the tenants of Arnota Monastery, in Dobriceni and BƒÉrbƒÉte»ôti, as well as among the tanners of Bucharest and the burghers of T√¢rgovi»ôte, BuzƒÉu, and Ploie»ôti.Cazacu, p. 6; Dem√©ny, pp. 319‚Äì321 Several historians propose that the revolt should be read as more than a \\"praetorian\\" uprising. This view was embraced by Ludovic Dem√©ny, who agreed with Iorga's description of \\"deeper causes\\" for Seimeni massacres. He decries \\"subjectivist\\" assessments by Ilie Minea and S√°ndor Szil√°gyi, highlighting mass popular support for the mercenaries.Dem√©ny, pp. 307‚Äì312, 319‚Äì321, 333‚Äì335 Likewise, Matei Cazacu describes the uprising as an \\"anti-feudal movement\\" or \\"social war\\", \\"the first one in our history to target the Prince [...], as well as religion\\".Cazacu, pp. 5‚Äì6 This view is also backed by another author, Constantin Rezachievici, who views the Seimeni rising as \\"the most important mass movement of all the medieval period, south of the Carpathians.\\"Rezachevici, p. 95 Researcher George Potra also deems the Seimeni war a \\"great popular uprising [...] against boyar oppression and exploitation\\".Potra I, p. 17 The uprising was in full swing by April, managing to kill several figures at Constantin's court, including Ban Ghiorma Alexeanu and Clucer C√¢rstea CornƒÉ»õeanu, as well as a former Vistier, George Karydis.Giurescu, p. 73; Stoicescu, pp. 105, 162‚Äì163, 182, 193. See also Filipescu, p. 133 By several accounts, Prince Constantin was his troops' hostage, pretending to endorse the massacres, but secretly asking for a Transylvanian intervention against the Seimeni.Cazacu, pp. 6‚Äì7; Costin, pp. 191‚Äì192; Dem√©ny, pp. 320‚Äì324; Filipescu, pp. 132‚Äì133; Iorga, p. 197; Rezachevici, pp. 93, 95‚Äì96 This view is partly contradicted by Xenopol, who notes that Constantin had a running dispute with the Transylvanian Prince, George II R√°k√≥czi. The latter was interested in intervening against the Seimeni because he wanted Buicescul and his son to take over as puppet rulers of Wallachia.Xenopol, pp. 134‚Äì136 Buicescul's name is recorded among those of Wallachian boyars who openly begged for a Transylvanian intervention.Dem√©ny, p. 324 Prince-claimant R√°k√≥czi officially declared that he would take measure to contain the revolt and prevent it from spreading into Transylvania or Moldavia; he was also alarmed by news that the Seimeni were trying to forge an alliance with the Cossack Hetmanate, which risked opening a war on two fronts.Dem√©ny, pp. 322, 324‚Äì327 He convened a Diet at his capital in Fey√©rv√°r (BƒÉlgrad), asking for its permission to commence war in Wallachia. This began on April 13, with a southward march from Segesv√°r (Sighi»ôoara) to Corona (Bra»ôov), where R√°k√≥czi gathered some 30,000 soldiers and 12 cannons.Dem√©ny, pp. 323‚Äì324, 327; Iorga, p. 197. See also Cazacu, p. 7 Faced with this emergency, the Seimeni took an oath from Constantin, who promised again to act as their sovereign.Xenopol, pp. 136, 139 Led at the time by a Muslim, they welcomed Ottoman envoys, assuring them that theirs was not a revolt against the Empire.Xenopol, pp. 133‚Äì134, 136‚Äì137 As Cazacu notes, the Ottoman overseers, in particular Siyavu≈ü Pasha, wanted to join in the war on the Seimeni, but the main Ottoman army was still fearful of a war in the East.Cazacu, p. 6 Other authors suggest that the reason for such inaction was the Cretan War.Dem√©ny, p. 322; Rezachevici, p. 95 As noted by Rezachevici, Constantin had been able to send out some of the Seimeni leaders as delegates to Transylvania, whereupon R√°k√≥czi had captured them; he replaced the missing commanders with boyars from his own retinue.Rezachevici, pp. 95‚Äì96 He then persuaded his captors to let him meet with R√°k√≥czi at Gherghi»õa, but while on his way there changed course eastward and headed for the Ottoman province of Silistra, surrendering to Siyavu≈ü Pasha.Dem√©ny, p. 328; Filipescu, p. 134; Rezachevici, p. 96; Xenopol, p. 137. See also Costin, p. 192; Iorga, pp. 197‚Äì198 The boyars began courting Preda Br√¢ncoveanu, proposing that he replace Constantin on the throne. Br√¢ncoveanu remained a loyalist, with his own son Papa having been killed in the events.Stoicescu, p. 125 Before or after this moment, the mercenaries ransacked Dintr-un Lemn Monastery, which was under Preda's patronage.Ioan LƒÉcustƒÉ, \\"MƒÉnƒÉstirea Dintr-un Lemn ‚Äì veacuri de istorie\\", in Magazin Istoric, August 1998, p. 58 While dug in at Gherghi»õa, the rebels eventually elected Hrizea as the new Prince.Costin, pp. 192, 193; Dem√©ny, p. 328; Rezachevici, p. 96; Xenopol, p. 137. See also Cazacu, p. 7; Filipescu, p. 134; Iorga, p. 198; Paul of Aleppo & Alexandrescu-Dersca Bulgaru, p. 137; Stoicescu, p. 196 According to Iorga, he can be described as the Seimeni Prince, or as a \\"warlord\\".Iorga, p. 198 With such endorsement, Hrizea then issued a set of writs which ordered \\"the country to gather up around him, at Teleajin.\\"Costin, p. 192 Nevertheless, Constantin was able to consolidate a web of alliances against Hrizea. Support also came to him from Moldavia, which, in 1655, was R√°k√≥czi's \\"satellite\\";Xenopol, p. 136 the Moldavian Prince, Gheorghe »òtefan, who had managed to purge and discipline his own Seimeni,Costin, pp. 189‚Äì191; Dem√©ny, p. 322 personally joined in the fighting. The Moldavian host he brought with him to Wallachia in summer 1655 included a young Miron Costin, the future chronicler.Stoicescu, p. 387 Costin reports that Prince Gheorghe marched on Wallachia from Foc»ôani, intercepting and capturing one of Hrizea's envoys while crossing BuzƒÉu County.Costin, p. 192 Map of Hrizea's revolts On June 26,Dem√©ny, pp. 309, 327; Iorga, p. 198. See also Cazacu, p. 7 the Seimeni were defeated at »òoplea, where they met a Wallachian army commanded by a new Spatharios, PanƒÉ Filipescu,Stoicescu, p. 178 who joined with the Transylvanians. As reported by Costin, the Seimeni narrowly missed out on an opportunity to intercept R√°k√≥czi and his \\"Hungarian\\" corps, allowing their enemies to unite. When they eventually decided to attack and tried to split the Transylvanians from the rest, they did so in an undisciplined manner, \\"like a swarm that's lacking a queen bee\\".Costin, p. 193 Initially, with some 30 cannons,Cazacu, p. 7; Iorga, p. 198 the rebels had superior firepower, but the guns were unusable in the charge. They had been tied to the backs of water buffaloes, who, under the summer sun, went astray into the Prahova River; this left Hrizea exposed to a cavalry counterattack.Costin, pp. 193‚Äì194 According to Iorga, \\"the mercenaries, softened by the good life, inebriated for the very purpose of doing battle\\", were massacred by the Transylvanian riders of Captain Gaudy.Iorga, p. 198 Nonetheless, Xenopol writes, Hrizea himself behaved \\"with such bravery as would have befitted a better cause\\".Xenopol, p. 137 Hostage The \\"breaking of the Seimeni\\" was followed by a second battle outside Ploie»ôti, with some 5,000 Moldavians joining in to destroy Hrizea's scattered forces.Costin, pp. 194‚Äì195 Various chronicles also repeat the story according to which Constantin's victory hinged on betrayal or incompetent maneuvers by Hrizea's Aga Lupu Buliga, who fired his cannons \\"not into the soldiers, but above them.\\"Filipescu, pp. 134‚Äì135. See also Cazacu, p. 7; Dem√©ny, p. 328; Iorga, p. 198; Rezachevici, p. 96 According to Rezachevici, Buliga was one of Prince Constantin's boyar loyalists, who acted out on his earlier orders.Rezachevici, p. 96 Such reports suggest that Hrizea took time away from battle to see Buliga lynched by the Seimeni,Cazacu, p. 7; Stoicescu, p. 132 or that he himself slashed the Aga with a sabre.Filipescu, p. 135; Iorga, p. 198; Theodorescu, p. 54 According to Stoicescu, the stories are largely discredited, with inscriptions showing that Buliga had actually died in the 1653 battle of Finta.Stoicescu, p. 132 However, other readings of the same writings credit the Hrizea account, suggesting that Buliga had only been severely wounded at Finta, and killed at »òoplea.Theodorescu, pp. 22, 54 Many of the Seimeni fraternized with the enemy, leaving the pretender to collect his remaining troops, and, though continuously harassed by Transylvanian pursuers, to seek his way toward BrƒÉila, in Ottoman territory. This allowed Constantin to leave Silistra and seek to join the Transylvanian‚ÄìMoldavian troops, which he did at Dridov; on his way there, he intercepted and executed several Seimeni, marking the beginning of a major purge.Flipescu, pp. 135‚Äì136 As Filipescu writes: \\"the Seimeni discarded their blue clothes and dressed up in messy rags, and swore that they were not soldiers, for whoever was known to be one had no more days left to live.\\"Flipescu, p. 136 Nevertheless, resistance continued: more skirmishes were recorded outside Bucharest, BrƒÉila, and Craiova.Cazacu, p. 7; Dem√©ny, p. 329; Iorga, p. 198 All roads were reportedly unsafe, with Seimeni taking over as \\"brigands\\".Dem√©ny, p. 329; Rezachevici, p. 96 Repressive measures were overseen by a Transylvaian stay- behind force, which may have numbered as many as 3,000 men. These were continuously harassed by the rebels and armed civilians, many of whom had taken refuge in the Danube marshlands.Dem√©ny, pp. 327‚Äì329 Two months after the Ploie»ôti clashes, 2,000 cavalry regulars, or CƒÉlƒÉra»ôi, also revolted, facing the loyalists outside CƒÉlugƒÉreni.Dem√©ny, pp. 329‚Äì332; Giurescu, p. 73. See also Costin, p. 197 Xenopol describes this later revolt as another plot by the Seimeni, centered on \\"butchering the Hungarians, and on toppling the Prince who had so gravely betrayed them.\\"Xenopol, p. 139 They won a tactical victory against the Transylvanian regiment of J√°nos Boros (BorƒÉ»ô), before being put down by the Moldavians;Costin, p. 197 survivors again withdrew into the marshlands, were, as Boros complained, they could not be reached.Dem√©ny, p. 332 Also on the loyalist side, the civil war involved a group of Crimean Tatars under R√ºstem Mirza,Costin, pp. 196‚Äì197; Dem√©ny, pp. 329, 330; Rezachevici, p. 96 who entered Wallachia in late JuneCazacu, p. 6 and raided Ora»ôul de Floci. Although as many as 200 inhabitants were massacred,Nicolae Minei (contributor: Valentin Negre), \\"Po»ôta Magazin Istoric. Ora»ôul dispƒÉrut\\", in Magazin Istoric, October 1973, p. 98 the town's defending army, comprising both burghers and Romani slave-miners, was able to kill R√ºstem.Dem√©ny, p. 330 Hrizea and his family found safety in BrƒÉila, but the authorities there eventually surrendered them to Constantin. All family members were taken then as hostages to Fey√©rv√°r.Filipescu, p. 136; Iorga, p. 198 The journey involved a stopover in the princely capital of T√¢rgovi»ôte, where, as Boros noted, crowds flocked to show their appreciation for Hrizea and mourn his departure.Dem√©ny, pp. 329‚Äì330 As an extraordinary precaution against further troubles, a Transylvanian army, probably led by √Åkos Barcsay, guarded Hriza's passage through the Jiu Valley.Dem√©ny, p. 330 The exile into Transylvania was arranged by R√°k√≥czi, who set Hrizea's ransom at 100,000 ducats. Hrizea could not pay that sum, and was therefore moved from a townhouse he was renting to a cell in the city garrison.Iorga, p. 198. See also Stoicescu, p. 197 Xenopol suggests that Hrizea was in fact sheltered, and even allowed to command his own army of 500 Seimeni, which R√°k√≥czi used as leverage in his dealings with Constantin.Xenopol, pp. 139‚Äì140 As noted by the same author, the intervention of 1655 had made Constantin entirely dependent on the Transylvanian Prince, who was now his \\"protector and, so to say, his second-hand suzerain\\".Xenopol, p. 138 Eventually, the nucleus of Seimeni in Wallachia submitted to Constantin and R√°k√≥czi. Xenopol summarizes their \\"strange reconciliation\\", with the mercenaries expressing regret and referring to Constantin as a \\"good and gentle Prince\\".Xenopol, p. 139 Escape and execution The Wallachian truce was again endangered after less than two years. In December 1656, Captain Priboi, probably as a Hrizea partisan, tried to assassinate Constantin, before being stopped by the Transylvanian bodyguards.Rezachevici, pp. 96‚Äì97 In early 1657, R√°k√≥czi intervened in the Swedish Deluge, which caused him to be absent from the capital and sparked a succession crisis at home.Costin, pp. 198‚Äì202; Filipescu, pp. 136‚Äì138; Xenopol, pp. 140‚Äì141 During this interval, as many as 500 Seimeni exiles, whom R√°k√≥czi had left in charge of the city defenses,Rezachevici, p. 97 helped their leader break out of prison. They managed to do so on March 23, 1657, while Hrizea was praying in church.Iorga, p. 198. See also Filipescu, pp. 137‚Äì138; Rezachevici, p. 97; Stoicescu, p. 197 Hrizea, with his family and his retinue, rode to Hermannstadt. He could not enter that city, being harassed by local Transylvanian Saxons and Romanians, but eventually crossed the Olt River.Iorga, p. 198 The sources compiled by Iorga suggest that Hrizea never managed to rekindle the revolt with his presence, being betrayed by a Transylvanian Romanian notable in whose house he was lodging, and then delivered to Wallachia as a prisoner. Meanwhile, some 400 Seimeni had grouped in northern Oltenia, possibly at Bistri»õa Monastery, where they expected his return.Iorga, pp. 198‚Äì199. See also Stoicescu, p. 197 However, in Rezachevici's reading, Hrizea crossed the mountains with the help of local Romanians, then barricaded with his troops at Bistri»õa, expecting reinforcements.Rezachevici, p. 97 His cause had remained popular with both the mercenaries and the Wallachian commoners,Rezachevici, p. 97; Stoicescu, p. 197 but Constantin's regime was able to act before a rebel force could fully take hold. A Wallachian army, led by Br√¢ncoveanu, met the Seimeni in Gorj County, at T√¢rgul BengƒÉi or Benge»ôti-Ciocadia.Iorga, pp. 198‚Äì199; Rezachevici, p. 97. See also Filipescu, p. 138; Xenopol, p. 140 As noted by Iorga, they were asked to surrender but refused, and were then decimated.Iorga, pp. 198‚Äì199 Other reports suggest that they were \\"not defeated\\", but promised safe haven, and disarmed under this false pretense.Filipescu, p. 138 Hrizea was eventually killed at the princely court in T√¢rgovi»ôte. Iorga and Rezachevici calculate his date of death as April 8 or 9.Iorga, p. 199; Rezachevici, p. 97 This is contradicted by other sources, which have September 8.Stoicescu, p. 197 Texts also diverge on the exact method employed, as well as on other circumstances. Stoicescu suggests that Hrizea was broken on the wheel‚Äîbut also mentions reports according to which he was simply hanged.Stoicescu, p. 197 According to Filipescu, the actual method involved hanging Hrizea and his twelve captains \\"by a wheel\\"; \\"as for the others\\", Filipescu notes, \\"they cut off their noses and ears, and [then] set them free.\\"Filipescu, p. 138; Xenopol, p. 140 Iorga also records the death as a hanging \\"amid blood-stained pikes adorned with his soldiers' severed heads.\\"Iorga, p. 199 Some sources suggest that the other bodies on the wheel were not those of Seimeni, but included Hrizea's wife and mistresses.Iorga, p. 199 Costin reports that the real repression of the Seimeni only began at that stage, and was merely based on word of mouth, allowed for false identifications and a settling of scores.Cazacu, pp. 7, 14; Costin, p. 196 The deserters and suspects were usually impaled: \\"The field outside Bucharest, and those outside various other towns, were riddled with their pierced bodies.\\"Cazacu, p. 14; Costin, p. 196 Aftermath Remains of a church in T√¢rg»ôor, a town leveled by the Ottoman army in 1659 By then, Constantin was in conflict with the Ottoman Empire, which had originally appointed him as Prince. As reported by the 18th-century chronicler Constantin Filipescu, the relationship between overlord and vassal was sabotaged by Seimeni intrigues: although they had been promised forgiveness for their earlier rebellion, Seimeni refugees in Silistra complained to Mehmed IV that Constantin was a \\"wicked\\" man, who intended to lead Wallachia and Transylvania into an anti-Ottoman war.Filipescu, p. 137 This account is also backed by Xenopol, who writes that the Seimeni used the Ottomans to \\"avenge a betrayal\\".Xenopol, p. 140 Rezachevici notes that, though \\"unconfirmed by foreign sources\\", this narrative contains \\"an echo of the hatred the servants felt toward the man who had betrayed them\\".Rezachevici, p. 98 Wallachia was subsequently invaded by the Tatars‚Äîwho were now allied with the Ottomans. At that stage, the »òoplea victor PanƒÉ Filipescu also turned against Prince Constantin.Rezachevici, pp. 98‚Äì100; Stoicescu, p. 178 Although some authors suggest that the Seimeni were entirely quashed in 1655‚Äì1657, and never recovered,Giurescu, p. 74 at least 1,000 of these troops were still serving the Prince in December 1656.Rezachevici, pp. 100‚Äì101 Constantin's replacement Mihnea III continued the attacks on the boyars, relying on the Seimeni to emancipate himself from Ottoman tutelage.Filipescu, pp. 140‚Äì147; Rezachevici, pp. 101‚Äì105 Constantin became his ally by proxy, invading Moldavia from Transylvania in hopes of becoming Prince there. An 18th-century compilation, Letopise»õul Cantacuzinesc, notes that the surviving Seimeni pledged their support, using the opportunity to \\"return to their consecrated theft, spoiling and robbing away the goods of boyars and whatever [else] they could find.\\"Rezachevici, p. 97 The expedition, which involved Seimeni troops on both sides, ended with Constantin's defeat by a Tatar horde, on the Bahlui.Costin, pp. 214‚Äì225 During his brief stay in power before he too was ousted by the Ottomans, Mihnea ordered the execution of Br√¢ncoveanu and Udri»ôte NƒÉsturel, while PanƒÉ Filipescu and Filipescu's partisans managed to escape to Transylvania.Filipescu, pp. 144‚Äì145; Stoicescu, pp. 125, 178, 215; Xenopol, pp. 145‚Äì146. See also Giurescu, p. 74; Rezachevici, pp. 102, 103 In 1659, he ultimately captured and executed Buicescul.Filipescu, p. 145; Rezachevici, p. 103; Stoicescu, p. 130 Mehmed IV's retaliation was severe. As archeologists I.

Numerous Italian intellectuals, starting with Giuseppe Ungaretti, acted on that occasion alongside Milani, which was subsequently dismissed in 1967, with the rationale that \\"erotic ideas fit harmoniously into the narrative fabric and respond to the descriptive requirements that the theme of condemned woman to solitude suggested and which were happily realized in the poetic unity of the work\\".

A Garda forensic expert said later that the bomb contained 2 kg of commercial explosive and could have caused serious casualties if it had detonated properly.http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch94.htm#Sep The train had made five stops at stations north of the Irish border between Belfast and Newry so the bombers would not have had to enter the Republic of Ireland to plant the bomb. At the time the then Irish Justice Minister, Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, said intelligence reports warned of a 'dramatic' increase in the Loyalist \\"terrorist\\" threat in the wake of the IRA ceasefire. (Although this turned out be the last attack by Loyalists in Dublin) \\"It may well be an attempt to get a retaliation. But . . the republican movement have made a decision to go with the democratic process, and it would appear very strongly that nothing is going to deviate them from that.\\" she said. A UVF statement which came from Belfast said that the bombing was 'a warning to the Dublin government that Northern Ireland is still British and will not be coerced into a united Ireland'.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/two-injured-by-loyalist- shoebox-bomb-on-train-serious-casualties-avoided-as-denonator-explodes- in-1448441.html Aftermath Chris Hudson who was the Irish peace process's go-between, between the UVF & the Irish Government recalled, straight after the bombing, ringing the PUP (The UVF's political wing ) and shouting down the phone at them ... \\"a bomb on a fucking train, thanks very much!\\" but said he had to keep fighting for peace & an end to UVF violence. Jim Cusack & Henry McDonad - UVF:The Endgame (Fully Revised & Updated) pg.314 The UVF later said the bomb was put there \\"as a warning to the southern government that the Ulster people will not be engulfed into United Ireland by coercion, persuasion, force or political stealth\\".

It flows from The Candlesticks range of the Southern Alps to the Esk River. The underfit stream cuts through terraces of glacial outwash gravels in its course, culminating in a incised gorge near to its confluence with the Esk. Geomorphology The over-wide valley through which P≈´kio Stream flows, is due to the presence of an underlying fault depression which once acted as the former course of the Cox River. This route was later blocked by terminal moraines, from the Pleistocene age Cox glacier with the Cox river finding an alternative outlet to the Poulter River. The principal Lochinvar moraine is also known as the Misery Mounds. The gorge in the lower reaches has been eroded through superficial deposits of glacial origin, and into the underlying greywacke bedrock.  Name  It is not known why the name of Nigger Stream came about but it is known to have been since at least the 1880s. The stream was mentioned in the news but the New Zealand government stated they had not received any complaints about the name. In 2015, Nigger Stream was complained about by a member of the public to the New Zealand Geographic Board (NZGB) for being offensive. The NZGB proposed renaming the river \\"Steelhead Stream\\" after the steelhead trout. The proposal received 37 objections with the majority of them citing that steelhead trout were not found in the freshwater river as they were salt water trout. As a result, one of the reasons for NZGB's proposals was not considered valid. This objection was upheld and the alternative MƒÅori name of \\"P≈´kio Stream\\", after the MƒÅori name for carex secta, was proposed instead. Following a second consultation on the new name which was supported by the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand, this proposal was passed unanimously by the NZGB however similar proposals in relation to nearby Niggerhead and Nigger Hill were referred to the Land Information New Zealand Minister, Louise Upston. Upston agreed to the additional changes along with the \\"P≈´kio Stream\\" rename and said that the move was not an attempt to rewrite history stating: \\"This isn‚Äôt about rewriting history ‚Äì it is and will remain a matter of public record that these three places used to carry different names.\\" See also *List of rivers of New Zealand  References  Rivers of Canterbury, New Zealand Southern Alps Canterbury, New Zealand Rivers of New Zealand ","title":"P≈´kio Stream"},{"id":"55431637","text":"Emme Gerhard (1872-1946) and Mayme Gerhard (1876-1955), the Gerhard Sisters, were among the first women photographers to establish a studio in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1903.

Last revised: May 2011. Early life The Gerhards' parents came to the United States as children from Cologne, Germany, in the mid-1800s. They settled in Mascoutah, Illinois, and had moved to St. Louis, Missouri, by 1869. Their father worked successively as a teamster, butcher, and storekeeper in the large German-American community, which included a large number of photographers, retouchers and engravers. Career The Gerhards began their photography careers as young women. They studied for three years with Fitz W. Guerin, the best-known St. Louis portraitist and a photographer of staged scenes. When Guerin retired in January 1903, the Gerhards acquired his studio and negatives. Their timing was perfect. Five years of renovations in the city between 1899 and the World's Fair in 1904 put the Gerhard Sisters in the heart of a new St. Louis at the height of the Progressive political era. They developed new and original ideas and methods which, as they have applied to portrait photography, gave a value and beauty of execution equal to painted portraits. They had a branch studio in North St. Louis, but their main studio on Olive Street, near Grand Avenue, was built under their supervision, and in accordance with the purposes they had in view. There were seven or eight rooms, and the first thing noticeable was the absence of photographic properties; the rooms had very large, many-paned windows, broad window seats, fireplaces, cozy corners, etc. They were decorated in soft, warm tones that made the whole atmosphere inviting and restful. The conventional light, at an angle of forty-five degrees, as taught by photographers, was ignored, and only the natural light of everyday life entered into their compositions. In such an atmosphere the sitter unconsciously relaxed and lost the sense of posing which was associated with having one's \\"picture taken.\\" This was the condition the Gerhards considered essential for the production of their \\"character pictures.\\" After studying the portraits painted by the old masters, Gerhard asked the question: \\"What qualities have these painters put into their work that makes them still 'alive' after centuries have elapsed?\\" It must be the soul, the real self of the subject, which so often eludes the camera, and they devoted themselves to developing this feature in their portraits. She endeavored to induce her subjects to forget the old \\"sit up and look pleasant\\" attitude which was almost impossible when one's head was supported by an iron hook and which one could not forget for a second. Their pictures were never retouched, stray hairs or blemishes were left just as the merciless camera showed them. The aim of the Gerhard pictures was the quintessence of naturalness. Groups were arranged before the fireplace as if in the home, chatting in cozy corners, playing games, singing and dancing; in fact, in all the pleasures and occupations that constitute daily life. The electric light used for pictures taken in the homes, made it possible to reproduce any part of a house; it was the first one used west of New York. When their mode of coloring or tinting photographs was used, the resemblance to oil paintings was startling in its result, especially when the \\"character\\" were successfully drawn out of a subject. Geronimo, by the Gerhards Many portraits were made during the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in 1904, when tribes from all parts of the world were represented. The director of the Field Museum of Natural History saw the opportunity to get a valuable ethnological collection if he could get a photographer, so he called on Charles Carpenter, the Museum's staff photographer, Frances Benjamin Johnston and the Gerhard Sisters. They agreed to take pictures of all the Native Americans and other ethnic groups he could bring, and their collection is a rare one. One of those portraits is that of Geronimo, that contains an accidental \\"portrait\\" of the photographer at work. It is reflected in Geronimo's eye and was discovered in 2009 when the Library's photo conservator realized someone was looking back at her as she worked. The \\"portrait\\" shows a woman wearing a white shirtwaist blouse with a dark skirt, the uniform of the New Woman of the 1890s and early 1900s. The Gerhard Sisters attended every convention in the interest of photography, and their work attracted much attention. They explained their methods, and were always on the lookout for new ideas, keeping abreast with all late developments. Many medals and honorable mention were awarded them. The Photo- Era Magazine, an American journal of photography, placed on its front cover of the September issue of 1913 one of the pictures displayed by them at the convention in Kansas City of the same year, and which was considered one of the best shown at that convention. It represented a young girl holding a vase of flowers, the beauty of the expression being caught by the camera in a charming and happy way. The Gerhards attended photography conventions at least as early as 1905 in Boston, and photography periodicals report their attendance at conventions in major cities across the United States through 1920. Mayme Gerhard frequently served as an officer in the organizations while Emme Gerhard provided most of the speeches, demonstrations, and photographs for exhibitions. Her 1916 talk, \\"Portrait-Lighting with Mercury-Vapor Lamps,\\" was published as an article under both their names by the Cooper Hewitt Electric Company, Hoboken, N.J. The Gerhards held office and won prizes in the Missouri Photographers' Association and the Missouri Valley Association but were most involved in the Women's Federation of the Photographers' Association of America. Organized in 1910 as a resource for the increasing number of women entering the photography field, the Women's Federation existed for only nine years but played an important role in educating and promoting the works of women photographers. It held exhibitions of women's photographs at annual meetings and organized lectures, demonstrations, and exhibits throughout the country in studios run by women. When the Women's Federation merged with the Photographer's Association, Mayme Gerhard was the first woman to hold national office, and she was also made an associate of Britain's Royal Photographic Society in 1913. The Gerhard Sisters joined the push to have photography considered as artistic expression rather than mechanical reproduction, as their 1916 letter to the editor of Bulletin of Photography shows. They cited seeing their local museum displaying Indian pottery, lace, and mummies, and New York's Metropolitan Museum exhibiting snuff boxes and the Pittsburgh Art Museum showing several rooms of amateur art while the St. Louis Museum refused since 1914 to exhibit their photographs because it defined them as mechanics. They implored the Photographer's Association of America to take up their cause. The sisters found their occupation still dominated by men in 1917 when Emme Gerhard told a reporter, \\"We know that being women we must expect to do our work as well and then a little better than men if we would be recognized and accepted and compete upon equal terms with men.\\" She acknowledged gender discrimination in photo contests, continuing, \\"Our first prizes were not won until our entries went in without other identification marks than numbers.\\" Photography clubs denied women membership as did advertising organizations. In June 1917, when the Associated Advertising Clubs of the World held its thirteenth annual convention in St. Louis, women were permitted to attend even though the local chapter excluded women from membership. Mayme Gerhard was one of three local women \\"honored by the National Program Committee by being placed on the program for the women's conference.\\" Personal lives Emme and Mayme GerhardThe Gerhards held leadership roles in professional organizations and became fellows in England's Royal Photographic Society. Their images and business acumen enabled them to attain economic independence and even travel for pleasure. They worked together until 1936 and afterwards continued to explore their own photographic specialties. They are noteworthy examples of women who integrated their responsibilities at home with their participation in the public sphere. In about 1899, Emme Gerhard married Albert W. Rhein, a stationery engraver. They lived in St. Louis with Emme Gerhard's parents and Albert's brother Russell G. Rhein, also a photographer. Emme Gerhard worked as a photographer's helper. On Oct. 12, 1906, the Rheins had a son, Gerhard, while living in Eureka Springs, Arkansas. In the 1920 census, Emme Gerhard was listed as a widow, living with her son in the home of her sister, Mayme Gerhard. Emme's husband, however, was listed as divorced, and living in a St. Louis household that included his sister Alice, a photo retoucher. Mayme Gerhard, married Thomas Goodale Hawley, a dentist who was formerly a photographer himself. The couple lived at 1824 Lami Street in St. Louis, sometimes with some of Mayme's siblings. The extended Gerhard family worked as photographers with the Gerhard Sisters employing their sisters and brother in the photo studio occasionally. The sisters were economically self-sufficient, raised children who became self-supporting, and had the means to travel as far as England and Hawaii. The Gerhards lost many of their valuable images in a February 1905 fire in their studio that destroyed more than 300 of their glass plate World's Fair negatives. Mayme Gerhard valued them at $10,000 (equivalent to $260,000 in 2017) at the time. The Gerhard sisters maintained studios at several places in St. Louis until Emme Gerhard left in July 1936 to study \\"the art of the primitive\\" at an artist colony near Mexico City for a month before relocating to New York where she lived with her son, Gerhard R. Gerhard, a lawyer in Port Washington, New York. She exhibited regularly at the International Salon of Photography in the United States, Canada and Western Europe and her photographs generally received awards. In 1938, she was made a fellow of the Royal Photographic Society of England. Emme Gerhard died in 1946. Mayme Gerhard operated the studio with her daughter Vera Hawley Smith until 1941 after her husband died in 1935 and Emme Gerhard left St. Louis. As Mayme Gerhard Hawley, she died in St. Louis on Oct. 16, 1955. Legacy The Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division acquired its Gerhard holdings through copyright deposits and has more than 100 photos made between 1904 and the early 1920s, primarily their work with ethnic portraits at the St. Louis World's Fair and studio portraits from the 1910s. Many of the magazines and newspapers where their images were originally published are available for study through the Library's general collection and newspaper research centers. The bulk of their surviving papers and photographs are at the Missouri Historical Society and the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History.

The body was established in 1993 upon the dissolution of the Moscow Oblast Soviet. The Duma consists of 50 deputies that, since 2011, are elected in Mixed-member proportional system with 25 members elected via proportional representation and 25 elected from single-mandate districts. United Russia is the largest party in the Duma with 38 members elected in the 2016 oblast elections.  History  In 1993, in the Moscow Oblast the Moscow Oblast Duma was established - a representative and legislative body of the region. On November 10, 1993, by the decision of the Small Council of the Moscow Oblast Council, the provision \\"On elections to the Moscow Oblast Duma on December 12, 1993\\" was approved. On December 12, 1993, together with the adoption of the new draft of the constitution of Russian Federation, according to which the State Duma of the Russian Federation was established and jointly, with the elections to the State Duma, the elections to the Moscow Oblast Duma were held. Alexey Alekseevich Vorontsov was elected as a chairperson. In 1995, the mandate of the first convocation were extended without any elections. At the end of 1996, the members of duma adopted the Charter of the Moscow Oblast. On December 14, 1997, the elections to the Moscow Oblast Duma of the 2nd convocation were held. Together with the elections, a referendum was held on transferring of 50% of the members of the Moscow Oblast Duma to a \\"semi- professional\\" basis in order to \\"save the budget funds\\". The composition of the Moscow Oblast Duma has been seriously updated: only 12 out of 50 members were re-elected. Alexander Evgenievich Zharov former head of the regional electoral committee was elected as a chairperson. All leading positions in the regional parliament, including the position of the chairman and of his four deputies, have been held by supporters of the head of the regional administration Anatoly Tyazhlov. On December 16, 2001, the 3rd convocation of the Moscow Oblast Duma was elected, for the 5-year term. Valery Evgenievich Aksakov was elected as a chairperson. On March 11, 2007, in a single voting day, the elections for the 4th convocation of the regional duma were held (2007-2012). Valery Aksakov became the chairperson for the second time. The parliamentarians formed 2 fractions: \\"United Russia\\" and \\"ROST\\"(\\"growth\\") (Development. Region. Stability). On March 25, 2011, members of the Moscow Oblast Duma took advantage of the amendment of the law and approved a resolution on postponing the elections to the regional parliament for December 2011, combining them with elections to the State Duma of the Russian Federation. At the same time, the mandate term for the members of the Moscow Oblast Duma of the 4th convocation was reduced by three months, by the day of the first seating of the Moscow Oblast Duma of the 5th convocation. On December the 4th, 2011, in a single voting day, the elections to the regional duma of the 5th convocation (2011‚Äì2016) were held. The elections to the Moscow Oblast Duma of the 6th convocation took place on September 18, 2016. At the elections, voters gave the majority of votes for a single list of candidates of the United Russia party ¬´–ï–¥–∏–Ω–∞—è –†–æ—Å—Å–∏—è¬ª - 43.15%. At the second place is the Moscow regional branch of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, which gained 15.88%.

When she earned her degree as a doctor of medicine at Ghent University, where she was the first woman to conduct research and the first woman physician to graduate from the school. Although she was not allowed to pursue an academic career, De Vriese opened a private pediatric clinic and served as the director of the Children's Ward at the Bijloke Hospital in Ghent. In 1914, she married Josef Vercouillie, also a physician. Early life and education Bertha Coletta Constantia De Vriese was born on 26 September 1877 in the Coupure neighborhood of Ghent, Belgium to Coralie Pannenmaeker and Lodewijk De Vriese (nl). Until 1864, secondary education did not exist for women in Belgium and women were not able to attend tertiary schooling until the University of Brussels opened to them in 1876. A law passed in 1890 that allowed women the right to attend medical school, but it required that women have a certificate for secondary schooling or pass an equivalency test. Home schooled to prepare for her university studies, De Vriese passed the exams of the Central Jury in 1893. She immediately enrolled in the Ghent University, as the first woman admitted to medical school in Ghent. Her degree was given summa cum laude with a diploma for medicine, obstetrics, and gynecology in 1900, as the first female graduate in medicine. The following year she was awarded a prize and distinction as Laureate in the University Competition, which also earned her a gold medal from the mayor of the city of Ghent. Competing with the male students, her paper, Etudier les modifications que la distribution des vaisseaux sanguins des extr√©mit√©s subit chez l'homme au cours du d√©veloppement (Investigating the changes humans undergo on the distribution of blood vessels in the extremities during development) was awarded 95 out of 100 possible points. The fellowship she earned as laureate was for the period from 1899 to 1901. It allowed her to study abroad in Berlin, Freiburg, London, Munich, Paris, Strasbourg, Vienna, and Z√ºrich. Career De Vriese returned to Ghent in 1903 and applied for a position in the anatomy laboratory of , hoping to have an academic career. There was no precedent for a woman to work in a laboratory and Leboucq sought approval from the faculty council, the rector, and the managing inspector from the Education Ministry before consent was given. De Vriese was hired as the first woman to serve as an assistant in an anatomy laboratory. If she was able to complete a two-year training and successfully published during her assistanceship, De Vriese would be able to become an associate professor and eventually a full professor. In 1905, she obtained her specialist certification in anatomy with the dissertation Recherches sur la morphologie de l'art√®re basilaire (Research on the morphology of the basilar artery). At this time, the university was undergoing to change in curriculum to focus more on research and De Vriese applied for an extension to her assistant's position to gain the necessary requirements for a lead researcher. Although praised by her colleagues, the rector, and the minister, the ministry refused to grant the extension. After a protracted period of petitioning, De Vriese left Ghent University in 1908 and Leboucq approved the candidacy of his son for the position. That same year, De Vriese took a position at the as a service provider in the pediatric ward. In 1914, she married a doctor, Josef Vercouillie. That same year she opened a private practice for children's health care. She later became the head of the pediatric department of the Bijloke Hospital and served as a medical inspector for the public schools. Death and legacy De Vriese died on 17 March 1958 in Ghent.

She is the head coach of the women's basketball team at Harvard University. She has served as the head coach since 1982, and is entering her 39th season in 2020-21. Only one coach, Harry Perretta, has a longer tenure as a head coach of an NCAA Division I women's basketball team. In 1998, Harvard beat Stanford in the first round of the NCAA tournament, the first time in men's or women's Division I NCAA history that a sixteenth seeded team had beaten a number 1 seed. Early years Delaney‚ÄìSmith grew up in Newton, Massachusetts and is one of six children. When she attended Sacred Heart high school there were no gym classes so she developed her basketball skills playing on basketball courts across the street from where she lived. She played on the basketball team in high school and became the first female in Massachusetts basketball history to score 1000 points. She joked that this was because the coach was her mother who made her teammates passed to her. She attended college at Bridgewater State, but the school had no varsity teams for women, just a club that placed more emphasis on making sure everyone received equal playing time rather than winning. Though, Delaney-Smith did not find that competitive enough. She was a good swimmer, so wanted to compete on the swim team but the school only had a synchronized swimming team. She ended up enjoying her four years on this when team even though it wasn't competitive enough for her.  High school coaching  After graduating from Bridgewater, her goal was to become a swim coach. She knew that Westwood High School, a few miles to the south of Newton, had constructed a new swimming pool, so she applied for a position as teacher and swim coach. She interviewed with the school superintendent, whose daughter played on the basketball team. He mentioned the basketball team was \\"terrible\\" and asked \\"can you coach them and can you win?\\" She responded that she could. Although she played in high school she faced a new challenge, having played the six-on-six version of basketball, a very different style of basketball than five person basketball which she now had to learn how to coach. The team went 0‚Äì11 in the first season, but over the next 11 years, the teams she coached had six undefeated seasons, a 204‚Äì31 record and won a state championship. Delaney-Smith is a strong advocate of gender equity. While at Westwood she filed multiple Title IX lawsuits to help ensure that the players had sufficient resources. In the mid-70s, she encountered other obstacles when she and her team played a road game. The team had changed from street clothes into uniforms in the locker room at their own school and then traveled to the game. They returned to their own gym, \\"tired, sweaty and eager to retrieve their belongings\\", but their own gym was occupied by a visiting boys team. They were told they had to wait. Delaney-Smith disagreed, and led her team past the teacher guarding the door. She remarked, \\"I think it was a little frenetic, to be honest.\\" but she made her point. In her time at Westwood, Delaney-Smith coached seven Boston Globe All-Scholastic selections, and saw many of her players continue their careers in college. She was inducted into the Westwood Hall of Fame in 1996.  Harvard  Due to her success as a high school basketball coach, she received numerous inquiries regarding a college position, but the first one she took seriously was a call from Harvard due to the commitment to gender equity demonstrated by the hiring committee. Even after being hired by Harvard, she continued to have to fight for her teams. On one occasion, when traveling to a road game, the team showed up for the pregame shoot-around but found that the men's team was using the gym. The transition to the college game mirrored, in some ways, her start as a high school coach. While they won a few games in the first three seasons, Harvard finished last in the conference in each of those years. That would change in the 1985‚Äì86 season, when the team had their first 20-game winning season, went nine and three in the conference, and finished in a tie for first place, her first of many conference titles. That first conference championships is one of her fondest accomplishments, which she savors because she believed her team \\"outworked most opponents\\". Today, winning the conference means an automatic bid to the postseason NCAA tournament. However, in 1986 not all conferences had an automatic bid to the tournament. The Ivy League would be granted an automatic bid starting in 1994. While an Ivy League team could be invited to the NCAA tournament as an at-large team, it has only happened once, by Dartmouth in 1983. Harvard finished first in the Ivy League in 1986, 1988, and 1991, but did not get their first invitation to the NCAA tournament until 1996. Harvard first played in an NCAA tournament in 1996. Although they lost to Vanderbilt, they hit 16 three-point attempts in the game, setting a record for an NCAA tournament game that has been subsequently tied but not exceeded as of 2017. In 1997, they again won the Ivy League, going 14‚Äì0 for their first ever undefeated conference season and an invitation to the NCAA tournament, where they faced top-seeded North Carolina and lost. In 1998, Harvard again won the conference, and had its best season ever winning 23 games, helped by the leading scorer in the nation Allison Feaster, who averaged 28.5 points per game. They were invited, as expected, to the NCAA tournament, but despite their overall performance they would receive a 16 seed. They traveled west to play number one seed Stanford Cardinal on their court. However, Stanford would be playing without two of their best players, Vanessa Nygaard who was injured in the Pac-10 final conference game while Kristin Folkl was injured shortly after in a practice. Despite the losses, the Cardinal were favorites to win the game, as a 16 seed had never beaten a number one seed. As the team walked onto the court, one of the event workers said \\"Welcome to real basketball\\". Feaster delivered, scoring 35 points, but it was a teammate, Susie Miller who hit a three-pointer late in the game to secure the win, representing the first, and still the only time a 16 seed has beaten a one seed in an NCAA women's tournament game. The feat has since been matched by the men, as the UMBC Retrievers upset Virginia in 2018. In 2014, she reached another milestone when Harvard beat Yale 69‚Äì65. That represented career win 515, pushing her past Princeton's Pete Carril for the most wins by an Ivy League basketball coach. Delaney-Smith is also one of only four active head coaches to spend over 38 years at the same institution in Division I.

A meia lua de compasso (lit. compass half moon) is a technique found in the martial art of capoeira that combines an evasive maneuver with a reverse roundhouse kick. It is considered one of the most powerful and efficient kicks of the art and one of its most iconic movements along with the rasteira.Nestor Capoeira, The Little Capoeira Book, Blue Snake Books, 2007 It is even considered that a capoeirista's general skill level can be determined on how hard and fast they are able to execute a meia lua de compasso. History Animated sequence of the kick. The origin of the meia lua de compasso is unknown, although one myth describes how the African slaves who created capoeira were forced to develop their techniques while having their hands chained, which gave birth to golpes rodados (spinning attacks) in which hands were put on the ground to support their bodies. There are reports from around the 1910s of a capoeirista named Francisco da Silva Cir√≠aco defeating a jiu-jitsu instructor named Sada Miyako with this kick. The movement was introduced in mixed martial arts in 2009 by Brazilian fighter Marcus \\"Lelo\\" Aurelio (also known as Professor Barraozinho), who knocked out his opponent Keegan Marshall with it. He was followed in 2011 by Cairo Rocha, who knocked out Francesco Neves with a meia lua de compasso. Technique The technique starts with the user standing up or semi-crouched in the position of ginga. By twisting his body towards one side and downing one or both hands onto the ground for balance, he launches the opposite leg into the air in a semi-circular movement that ends with his heel striking the opponent, usually in the head, or completing the spin into another ginga position. The power of the kick derives its energy from the similar centripetal force of a golf club swing. Variations Meia lua de compasso dupla. Meia lua revers√£o. Meia lua queda de rins. *Meia lua de compasso dupla This is a version of the kick done without either leg in contact with the ground. It combines the motions of a diagonal front handspring and a meia lua compasso using only the hand or hands to support the body during the kick and complete the spin. It is rarely seen because engaging the core muscles that it uses requires a high level of balance and strength. *Meia lua solta The meia lua solta is executed in the opposite manner as the meia lua de compasso dupla. Whereas in the dupla the arms are solely used, in the solta only the pivoting leg and foot are used. It is said to be much faster than the meia lua de compasso but also much riskier. Taking a foot sweep while performing this can be dangerous because of the lack of a supporting arm to spot the kick. Some groups refer to this as a chibata because of its fast whipping motion. *Meia lua revers√£o A kick that begins as a meia lua de compasso but ends like a front walkover. The capoeirista releases the kick, but instead of bringing the kicking leg around to complete the motion, he follows the kick with his entire body. He will usually land on the kicking leg and rotate 180 degrees to face the other player again. *Meia lua queda de rins This move is a combination of a meia lua de compasso and a queda de rins. While turning to release the kick, the capoeirista lowers himself unto his supporting elbow. He/she can complete the movement in a number of ways, with the most common one being the transition into the resisten√ßia.  Rabo de arraia  Rabo de arraia (lit. stingray's tail) is a term used in capoeira to describe a kicking technique. While it is sometimes used as a synonym to meia lua de compasso, there is controversy between authors about whether it is such or it refers a completely different kick. In his 2007's Little Capoeira Book, Nestor Capoeira put both techniques together as one and the same. However, Gerard Taylor described Mestre Pastinha's rabo de arraia as a \\"lower spinning kick\\" without mentioning the usage of hands, a theory Pedro J. Mart√≠n supports by equating further the term to the meia lua de compasso solta. Nevertheless, Taylor also acknowledged the name could mean different techniques according to region. To add greater confusion, the rabo de arraia seems to have been another name for the a√∫ batido in Mestre Sinhozinho's capoeira carioca. In 2012, Nestor Capoeira addressed the controversy in his book Capoeira: Roots of the Dance-Fight-Game, acknowledging that many movements in capoeira, particularly the meia lua de compasso, were called rabo de arraia. However, he described the authentic movement as one in which the user performed a handstand in front of the opponent, striking him with the heel before returning to the standing position. In popular culture Professional wrestler John Morrison has used this kick in several occasions, as well as film star and stuntman Lateef Crowder.

The company was set up to continue shipbuilding at Hietalahti shipyard, after its predecessor Helsingfors Skeppsdocka, which operated the yard in 1865‚Äì1895, had bankrupted. The company portfolio consisted building and repairing of ships, production of tram and railway wagons, boilers, steam and combustion engines, winches and other products. Before and during the First World War the main customers were the Imperial Russian Navy and the Finnish State Railways. Following the Finnish Declaration of Independence in 1917, the Finnish Civil War broke out in 1918. The yard was closed until the Red Guards had left the city. Due to recession in shipbuilding the company owners decided to sell the shares to another Helsinki engineering company, Kone- ja Siltarakennus in 1926. In 1935 Kone- ja Siltarakennus was taken over by W√§rtsil√§, which amalgamated Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works into its own organisation. The yard continued operating under name W√§rtsil√§ Hietalahti Shipyard after that.  Background  The Hietalahti yard construction was started in 1865 by industrialist Adolf T√∂rngren, who founded company Helsingfors Skeppsdocka. T√∂rngren soon fell into financial difficulties before the premises were taken into use. Already in the following year the new owner became Tampere Linen and Iron Industry, which still had to invest a substantial sum of money on buildings, dock and machinery, before the yard finally became operative.Osakeyhti√∂ Hietalahden...: Laivatelakan synty ja ensimm√§iset toimintavuodet. pp. 7‚Äì27. The new owner had planned to sell the yard after commissioning, but it had difficulties to reach a satisfying level of profitability and a prominent new owner. Finally, in 1880 the company was sold to engineer Oskar Eklund.Osakeyhti√∂ Hietalahden...: Toiminta Tampereen Pellava- ja Rauta-Teollisuus Osakeyhti√∂n hallinnan alaisena. pp. 28‚Äì37. Eklund enlarged the premises, but suffered continuously of lack of funding. In 1895 Helsingfors Skeppsdocka was declared to bankruptcy by the main creditor, Union Bank of Finland.  Foundation  The estate was auctioned on 3 October 1895 to trader J. C. Burmeister for 550,000 marks. The Senate confirmed the company articles of association already on 25 October. The new company name was Aktiebolaget Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstad in Swedish and Osakeyhti√∂ Hietalahden Sulkutelakka ja Konepaja in Finnish, both meaning \\"Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works Ltd.\\" The founding meeting was held on 18 December 1895. The participants were Burmeister, engineer Edvin Bergroth, bank director Alfred Norrm√©n, senior engineer Theodor Tallqvist, commercial cousellors Paul Sinebrychoff and Victor Ek and traders Theodor Stude and A. Einighorst. The capital stock was 400,000 marks, and a 250,000 marks' state loan granted to the preceding company was included into the liabilities. Burmeister, Tallqvist and Norrm√©n formed the company board; the deputy members were Sinebrychoff and Stude. Einighorst and Ek were comptrollers and their deputies were trader K. H. Renlund and vuorineuvos Albert von Julin. Bergroth was appointed the company manager and Thor Winter became the vice president.  Initial investments  Unlike the preceding operator of the yard, Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works had a good capital base and could directly invest on new machinery. Under Bergroth's determined leadership, the company started a significant investment programme. As docking of ships was considered the core business, the company bought neighbouring houses to get more area around the dry dock, which had very constricted space. The yard area was enlarged towards the city during the following years. In 1896 the company invested on a 30-tonne masting crane. Wooden sheds were gradually replaced by brick buildings, which reduced both fire risk and insurance costs. Production of rolling stock in the area had started already back in 1889, and new facilities were built in 1898 in an area recently gained. As the new premises were next to railway connection, transportation of products became easier. During 1898‚Äì1899 a new sawmill building was constructed from bricks to the border of the factory area, next to Tokankatu street. A brick-made pump house was built in 1899 and in the following year it was equipped by steam powered centrifugal pump made by Scottish Drysdale & Co. At the same time a new prime power machinery building with a chimney was constructed next to it, to the place of the old sawmill and storage. The boiler installed was a used 6-bar steam boiler taken from a shipwrecked Scottish vessel S/S Jupiter. The wooden gate of the dock was replaced by a steel gate in 1899. In the same year a new central storage for raw materials was built to the southern part of the area. Also this building was made from brick and quarried partly into bedrock. Other investments from the late 1890s were a two-floor carpenter workshop and paintshop, and a forging furnace. The old rolling stock workshop was renewed for boiler building. All cradles were equipped with rollers ‚Äì by the year 1900 the yard comprised three cradles. By the beginning of the 20th century the company employed 300‚Äì400 people.  Early 20th century  When Bergroth left the company leadership in May 1900, his follower engineer Adolf Engstr√∂m received the leadership of a financially solid company. Bergroth continued as a member of the management board.Osakeyhti√∂ Hietalahden...: Toiminta uuden vuosisadan aikana. Vuodet 1901‚Äì1914. pp. 58‚Äì77.  Strikes and changes in political environment  The first years of the 20th was time of increased labour movement activity; also the yard and engineering shop workers were dissatisfied to their working conditions. The daily working time was long and salaries low, and in change of lot of responsibility the workers had hardly any rights. The first notable strike took place in 1902, when the yard smiths were striking for one month. The action did not lead to favourable results for the workers; instead of reaching a collective agreement, each worker made a personal contract with the employer. The early 1900s were also politically turbulent due to the russification policy the Empire applied on its autonomous Grand Duchy. This culminated to assassination of governor-general Bobrikov in 1904. In the same year the Russo-Japanese War broke out, and this led to increased order intake from the Russian military. In July 1906 metalworkers went to a general strike which lasted until November, when a collective agreement was reached. Another strike followed in January 1909 and lasted until March, apart from foundry workers who returned to work in April, and steel plate workers who came back in May. Orders from the Imperial Russia reduced again in 1910 when the Empire re-established its pressure policy towards Finland. The company managed to get sufficiently orders from private companies of Russia to compensate the decline in public newbuilding projects. Moreover, the company got a lot of repair projects from the Imperial Russian Navy. Passenger ship √ñstra Sk√§rg√•rd built in 1903‚Äì1904. Imperial Russian Torpedo Cruiser Finn built in 1906.  Shipbuilding and repairs  In year 1900 Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works invested on pneumatic tools. A separate air compressor building was constructed next to the steam boiler building, and the premises were equipped with a comprehensive pressurised air supply network. The new tools increased productivity especially at the dockyard. At the early 20th century the company built passenger ships, tug steamers and other vessels to Finnish and Russian customers. In 1904 the company recruited Theodor H√∂ijer as shipbuilding master. H√∂ijer was an experienced engineer who had worked in Sweden and the United States. The size of ships visiting in the Finnish harbours had grown by the end of the 19th century, and in order to be able to dock those ships, the dock had to be extended. In 1903 the dock was extended to 96 metres, in 1910 to 100.6 metres and in 1912 to 106.7 metres. After the last enlargement, the company was able to dock the largest ships which visited the Finnish harbours. As the dry dock alone was not enough to meet the demand, the company considered building another similar one or a floating dry dock. The first option was ruled out due to cost reasons, and the second one due to lack of suitable place next to the area. Therefore, the company ended up to replace an 1886-built cradle by a larger one with 1,500 tonnes capacity. The 1907‚Äì1908 built new cradle was a significant investment, costing nearly 350,000 marks. Ship repair capabilities were further enhanced by introduction of welding in 1906 and investments on machinery, including two large lathes in 1908. Between 1900‚Äì1914 the company built at least 60 vessels. Most of the customers were from Russia and other countries around the Baltic Sea. 22 projects were steam launches and passenger steamers, three were coast guard vessels, 20 vessels were tug boats, rescue vessels or icebreakers and 11 were barges. In motor vessels the company used engines produced by Swedish J. & C. G. Bolinders Mekaniska Verkstads AB. About 30 vessels built in 1910‚Äì1918 were powered by these engines designed by Erik Rundl√∂f. At the end of 1904 the Russian Admiralty ordered first two, then another two torpedo boats, which were delivered in 1907. The drawings and engines came from Germany. The orders were highly profitable and during the building the company headcount was increased from 700 to 1,000. The project required building an electrogalvanisation facility which operated until 1914. While the order intake of military vessels declined in 1910, the company got significant repair projects: in 1911 three medium-size navy vessels, in 1912 three ships-of-the-line and five smallers vessels, in 1913 one ship of the line and a minelayer. Moreover, in 1914 shortly before the outbreak of the war, nine smaller ships underwent a thorough repair. Also new ships were constructed in the meantime. Vintage tram in Helsinki with a wagon produced by Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works.  Wagon production  As Engstr√∂m had a lot of earlier experience about rolling stock, his contribution on company's railway wagon building was significant. Wagon building balanced the wintertime pits in demand. The main customer was Finnish State Railways and the other customers were private railway operators with the standard 5 ft and narrow gauges. The company produced mainly freight wagons, but also some passenger coaches. The wagon production was ended in 1916, by when the company had built 1,980 closed and 963 open freight wagons and 80 coaches. This makes Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works the second biggest producer of railway wagons in Finland until then, right after the State Railways' Engineering Works. The wagon factory produced also other various rolling stock, including 12 tram wagons for Helsinki Tramway and Omnibus company.  Other products  By 1912 the Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works had delivered 140 boilers and 120 steam engines for marine use. For stationary use the company built 190 boilers of various types. The power of boilers ranged up to 400 ihp. In addition, the company produced pumps, preheaters, winches, anchoring machinery, rudder machinery, engine order telegraphs, filtering devices and number of other products.  Beginning of First World War  When the First World War broke out at the beginning of August in 1914, the common belief was, that the war would only last for a couple of months at most. The shipyard management did not expect to have many orders, and therefore reduced the headcount. But after a while the order intake increased; the Imperial Russian Army ordered more vessels, ship repair projects and gave various other assignments. The earlier declared ban the Emipre had laid down towards orders from Finnish companies was practically omitted.Osakeyhti√∂ Hietalahden...: Laivatelakka maailmansodan aikana. Vuodet 1915‚Äì1918. pp. 78‚Äì89. By time the orders exceeded the capacity of the premises. Already in 1914 the company made plans for a new brass foundry which was taken into use in the same year. A new engineering shop followed two years later. The premises were enlarged significantly in 1915, when the company leased an area which comprised nearly 28,000 m¬≤ land and 4,400 m¬≤ water. The new area was planned to be used for large naval and cargo ship building. The company built a new steel plate workshop and model workshop, and in 1917 followed a rib furnace, sawmill and two wooden houses for the company personnel. After constructing new cradles, the total value of the investments reached 1,300,000 marks. The dry dock was extended from 106.7 metres to 108.9 metres. In 1916 the company bought a house next to the yard area, at the other side of Munkkisaarenkatu, for a residence of its workers. Between 1914 and 1917 total 400 vessels were docked. 135 were navy vessels which were repaired. In 1916 the company built two large mine countermeasures steamers, which were one year after followed by two nearly alike vessels. In 1917 the company started to build a diesel-powered vessel for the Russian Hydrographic Office. The company headcount exceeded 1,500 people. In 1916 engineer K. Albin Johansson started as shipbuilding master and captain Ludwig Schwindt as vice president. By 1917 the company share capital reached 6,000,000 marks. Due to the favourable workload, Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works could pay high dividend to its owners. The good order backlog also created problems and risks. After 1915 raw material availability became worse and the prices increased due to the war. The situation worsened in 1917, when strikes, rioting and general disorder increased in many Finnish cities. The workers in Finland demanded working day to be limited to eight hours; when unruly and armed Russian soldiers joined to support the Finnish workers in April, the employers' association agreed the demands. This calmed down the environment for the summer, but new troubles followed in the autumn. The atmosphere became restless and the company managers were threatened. The Russian Provisional Government was overthrown in the October Revolution and in middle of November a general strike emerged in Finland. Although the strike lasted only for some days, workload was reduced because the Russian military did not place new orders in the chaotic situation and also getting the payment for the ongoing repairs became uncertain. Also the high inflation of the Russian ruble ate the viability. On 6 December 1917 Finland declared itself independent from Russia.  Civil War  When the Finnish Civil War broke out at the end of January 1918, all production was stopped, just as in all factories of Southern Finland. The last salaries were paid on 5 February, and the white-collar workers left the plant for few days later, after placing all the important documents into a safe place. The Red Guards, who took control in the city, strove to run up the production for their own purposes, but the key personnel went into hiding. Despite the recently gained independence from Russia, the Russian military was still present in Helsinki but did not take part in the Civil War. The company had receivables worth of 3,000,000 marks from the Russian Navy. As it was impossible to get the payment from the local military council, Schwindt travelled to Petrograd. With the help of Admiral Maximov he succeeded in obtaining the whole payment in rubles, but managed to change just one third of it into Finnish marks, which was then smuggled to Helsinki into a safe place. Schwindt had to leave the rest of the money in Petrograd, where he made deposit agreements with the local branches of Branobel and ASEA. After this Schwindt returned to Finland through Sortavala and joined the White Guard. ASEA paid the saved amount to Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works, but the sum saved to Branobel, over 1.1 million rubles, was lost due to the revolution. The collected money enabled paying the salaries of the white-collar personnel and a dividend to the owners. During the war, two icebreakers, Silachya and Stadt Reval had been docked by unwilling support of a yard supervisor the Red Guards had found and captured. Restarting of the plant had failed largely because the power grid and machinery had been sabotaged before the supervisors had left the yard. When the war was over, the material stock had been looted and just a part of it was managed to be returned. Work in the company was restarted when the situation returned to normal in April. The employees were taken back after each worker's role in the war was carefully investigated. As many of the company workers had taken part in the war in the Red Guards, and the number of orders had dropped, the number of personnel was significantly reduced from the level it was before the Civil War. S/S Suomen Neito. Voima.  Post-war recession  Two mine countermeasures steamers ordered by the Russian Navy and built in 1917 had stayed in the hands of the shipbuilder. The ships were sold to German Navy,Haavikko: 1917‚Äì1932; chapter 6. pp. 22‚Äì43. but later further sold to Norway. Their names on the yard order books were Norge and Fritjof. The company had to find a new customer also for the diesel-powered ship ordered by Russian Hydrographic Office; she became eventually a part of the Finnish merchant ship fleet and sailed under name Sunkist. Manager Adolf Engstr√∂m left his position in 1919. He was replaced by Walter K. √Östr√∂m. In the same year the company was sold to a consortium and subsequently almost all board members were changed. High inflation rate after the war created challenges for the company and required special raw material and labour cost clauses in the contracts. Shipping company Suomen Valtamerentakainen Kauppa Oy, \\"Finnish Transcontinental Trading Ltd.\\", ordered two 1,600-tonne freight steamers. Manager √Östr√∂m travelled to Germany to gain knowledge and hired a German specialist to lead the construction work. Keels of the both ships were laid in October and December 1920 in the recently leased new area. The first vessel, Suomen Poika was launched in July 1921, and the second one, Suomen Neito, in September during presence of the first president of the republic, K. J. St√•hlberg. Both ships were handed over in 1921 and made a successful career serving the Finnish foreign trade. After the two large freight ships were completed the workload went down. There were no new orders for new ships or rolling stock. In 1923 the company got two notable projects: one of them was a minor repair project of a shipwrecked merchant ship. The other one was for completing a semi-finished icebreaker, which had been started at Boecker & Co. shipyard in Tallinn. The Finnish state needed new icebreakers to ensure year- round access to its harbours, and had purchased the hull via John Nurminen company. The icebreaker was named Voima and completed and handed over to the state in 1924. The project was challenging, but the outcome was excellent; it demonstrated the company's capability to undertake demanding projects. However, after these projects the company suffered again lack of work. Due to the poor situation, the company had to discontinue the lease contract for the new shipbuilding area and sell the buildings and equipment.  Takeover by Kone ja Silta  √Östr√∂m resigned in 1924 and the new manager became Arvid A. Andersson. In the same year the owning consortium bought the rest of the shares and offered to sell the company first to F√ÖA. As the shipowner was not interested to expand its line of business to shipbuilding, the owners started negotiations with S√∂rn√§inen-based Kone- ja Siltarakennus (Kone ja Silta). At first the negotiations did not lead to results. The company decided to start competing with Kone ja Silta by producing steel bridges at dumping prices. Two years after Kone ja Silta took the offer, and on 22 December 1926, bought the entire share capital. The articles of association were changed in 1927, and after this both companies shared the same management board. Andersson managed the company until 1926, when K. Albin Johansson took the lead until end of 1927; after this the company was led by the Kone ja Silta manager Julius Stjernvall. In 1929 he was replaced by Robert Lavonius.Osakeyhti√∂ Hietalahden...: T√§rkeimpi√§ aikam√§√§ri√§ ja henkil√∂tietoja. pp. 137‚Äì140. After the acquisition the companies divided their portfolios so that shipbuilding and repair projects were concentrated in Hietalahti and bridge and boiler work in S√∂rn√§inen. The old iron foundry was closed down in 1932 and the premises were used for steel plate work thereafter. S/S J√§√§meri. S/S Orion.  New investment programme  As the size of ships still grew, the old dry dock started to be again too short. Although extending the length by another 3.5 metres helped, the dock was outdated. Neither the depth and width were sufficient any more for docking of modern icebreakers, such as J√§√§karhu. In 1930 the state installed a commission which made an estimate about the required docking capacity for navy and merchant ships. The commission suggested in its report enlarging and refurbishing the docking facilities in Hietalahti and ordering a floating dock with capacity of 2,750 tonnes. Politicians and businessmen of Turku lobbied the state for getting a dry dock there to the local Crichton-Vulcan yard, which also belonged to Kone ja Silta. Finally in 1933 the state gave 1,5 million marks subsidies to Crichton-Vulcan for the new dry dock and Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works got 2.4 million marks for a floating dock, which was built in Turku because of employment reasons. The floating dock was delivered in December 1933 and its cost was 6,000,000 marks. The first ship to be docked in it was F√ÖA's Ilmatar. In August 1933 the state gave a three million mark loan for enlarging and modernising the dry dock in Hietalahti. In the meantime the company invested on new pipe and boiler workshops, machinery and 75-tonne crane, the total sum of investments reaching 20,000,000 marks.Osakeyhti√∂ Hietalahden...: Suurtelakkasuunnitelma toteutetaan. pp. 105‚Äì129. The number of newbuilding projects in 1918‚àí1931 consisted just 15 vessels, most of them being small barges and warping vessels. Most notable ones were a small steamer called Rigel and also mini-submarine Saukko built after assignment of the Finnish Navy. During 1932‚Äì1938 Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works got a few orders from the state. One of them was passenger ship J√§√§meri, which was to be operated in Petsamo, a couple of barges and icebreaker Otso. In 1934 followed a significant order from F√ÖA: a 2,800-tonne cargo ship Orion.Haavikko: 1932‚Äì1936; chapter 8. pp. 51‚Äì52. The ship was propelled by an in-house built engine and she was the largest ship built in Finland until then.Haavikko: 1932‚Äì1936; chapter 10. pp. 53‚Äì56. Competition pushed Finnish shipowners to invest on larger vessels, and in 1936 Hietalahti shipyard was full employed with newbuilding projects.Haavikko: 1936‚Äì1944; chapter 2. pp. 60‚Äì61.  Takeover by W√§rtsil√§  The main owner of Kone ja Silta, commercial counsellor Robert Mattson died in 1935. His shares were sold in the same year to W√§rtsil√§, a company led by enegetic Wilhelm Wahlforss. Lavonius was fired, because he did not get along with Wahlforss, and Wahlforss wanted to restructure the organisation.Haavikko: 1932‚Äì1936; chapter 9. pp. 52‚Äì53. He saw the Kone ja Silta corporation management as a useless intermediate level between the W√§rtsil√§ management and the subdivisions. Kone ja Silta became fully amalgamated into W√§rtsil√§ in July 1938 and it was confirmed in general meeting in August. Both companies, Kone ja Silta and Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering works were disestablished. W√§rtsil√§ was now renamed W√§rtsil√§ Group; its subdivisions were W√§rtsil√§ ironworks, Kone ja Silta, Kotka Mekaniska Verkstad and Hietalahti shipyard. In addition, W√§rtsil√§ owned then Kareliawood, W√§rtsil√§ in Vaasa, W√§rtsil√§ in Pietarsaari and 99.52% of Ab Crichton-Vulcan Oy.

Early life  Potts was born in Nashville, Tennessee, December 9, 1935. He played halfback on his high school football team in Columbus, Tennessee, when it won the state championship. He attended Vanderbilt University on a football scholarship. In 1955, this Vanderbilt team went to the Gator Bowl, where they defeated Auburn. At Vanderbilt, he entered the Reserves Officer Training Corps (ROTC) and graduated with a reserve commission in 1958.  Military career  Upon graduation, Potts joined the Transportation Corps and attended the basic transportation course at Fort Eustis. After a follow-on course at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, he remained at the Ordnance School as commander of the 7th Enlisted Training Company, School Troops. In 1961, he attended Airborne School at Fort Benning, Georgia. Next, he went to Fort Campbell, Kentucky to serve with the 101st Airborne Division. During this tour, he served as the shop officer for the 801st Maintenance Battalion, Company Commander of Company B of the 801st, Company Commander of Company A of the 801st, and finally adjutant and Company Commander for Headquarters, Division Support Command of the 101st Airborne. Potts then went to Vietnam in 1964 as a maintenance and supply advisor attached to I Corps. Potts returned to Aberdeen Proving Ground as an instructor, and then as Chief of the Mobility Training Department for the Ordnance School. In 1967, by then a Major, he was detailed to Monterey, California, to attend the Defense Language Institute as a student of Turkish in preparation for an assignment as the Assistant Military Attache in that country. This course was followed by a six month course in intelligence in Washington. In July 1968, Potts began a highly productive three-and-a-half year tour in Ankara, Turkey. Promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in July 1970, he was sent to Fort Leavenworth to attend the Command and General Staff course in 1971. Upon completion of his studies in 1972, he went to Korea for service as commander of the 702nd Maintenance Battalion of the 2d Infantry Division. In 1974, he completed a Master's degree in Public Administration at Middle Tennessee State University. Then, he went to Washington, where he served as Chief of the Ordnance/Chemical Assignment Branch, Officer Personnel Directorate, Military Personnel Center at the Pentagon, with a follow-on assignment as the Chief of the Ordnance Branch there. In 1977, he completed the course at the Industrial College of the Armed Forces and promoted to Colonel. In the next three years, he was successively Logistics Staff Officer in the Readiness Directorate, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics at the Pentagon; Commander, Division Support Command, 82d Airborne Division; and Executive Officer in the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics. Promoted to Brigadier General in April 1981, Potts was then named Deputy Commanding General for Readiness and then Deputy Commanding General for Research and Development at the U.S. Army Missile Command, Huntsville, Alabama. Following a one year tour as Director of Readiness at the U.S. Army Materiel Development and Readiness Command in Alexandria, Virginia, Potts received his second star, and in November, 1983, was named commanding general of the Army's Ordnance Center and School at Aberdeen Proving Ground. He was formally appointed to the reconstituted Office of Chief of Ordnance on October 28, 1985, the first to hold that proud and historic position in over twenty-three years. Potts' tenure as Chief of Ordnance was marked by improvements in unit and individual training, improved methods of identifying and securing the best qualified men and women to serve as Ordnance Officers (including improvements in ROTC training and officer procurement), and the stimulation of interest among Warrant Officer candidates in technical career fields. He also oversaw the development of a full-scale training program for Warrant Officers and the revision of the Ordnance Officer Advanced Course to more accurately reflect the demands being placed upon ordnance leadership in the modern Army. In the area of combat developments, ongoing studies of unit readiness, recovery capabilities, maintenance productivity, support, and readiness, and of support operations plans and concepts posed new challenges to the Ordnance Corps in the school room and in the field. The concept of a master diagnostician who was to provide improved battlefield maintenance support was developed and implemented. The U.S. Army Ordnance Center and School systematically evaluated the performance of its graduates, and incorporated its findings in to the ongoing instructional program. That program was also enhanced by the expansion and upgrading of the Ordnance School's physical plant during Potts' tenure. The Ordnance Corps was the first of the combat support and service branches of the Army to secure approval of its plans for integration into the Army's new Regimental System in October 1985. General Potts also succeeded in getting a single Ordnance Enlisted Assignment Branch established at the Military Personnel Center at the Pentagon. The Ordnance Center and School also produced increasing quantities of doctrinal literature. Considerable emphasis was placed on standardization, both within Ordnance, in cooperation with other branches of the Army and other services, and to some extent in conjunction with other NATO forces, notably those of Great Britain and West Germany. In 1986, Potts was transferred to Ankara, Turkey, as Chief, Joint United States Military Mission for Aid to Turkey. He retired from the Army on July 29, 1986 and entered private business.

The peptide was able to home to tumor tissues, but in contrast to standard RGD (Arginylglycylaspartic acid) peptides, also spread much more extensively into extravascular tumor tissue. It was later identified that this extravasation and transport through extravascular tumor tissue was due to the bifunctional action of the molecule: after the initial RGD-mediated tumor homing, another pharmacological motif is able to manipulate tumor microenvironment, making it temporarily accessible to circulating drugs. This second step is mediated through specific secondary binding to neuropilin-1 receptor, and subsequent activation of a trans-tissue pathway, dubbed the C-end Rule (CendR) pathway. Mechanism of action The iRGD peptide homes and penetrates tumors through a 3-step process: First, the RGD sequence motif mediates binding to Œ±VŒ≤3 and Œ±VŒ≤5 integrins that are expressed on tumor endothelial cells. Second, upon Œ±V binding, a protease cleavage event is activated, revealing the c-terminal CendR motif (R/KXXR/K) of the peptide. Third, the CendR motif is now able to bind to neuropilin-1, activating an endocytotic/exocytotic transport pathway. The pathway triggered by iRGD can be used for the enhanced transport of coupled and coadministered anti-cancer drugs into tumors. Uses iRGD peptide has been shown to increase accumulation and penetration of anticancer drugs into tumors, but not into normal tissues - whether the drug is coupled to the peptide or given together with it. iRGD-mediated increased penetration and anti-cancer efficacy has been demonstrated with a variety of anti-cancer small molecules, nanoparticles and antibodies. A San Diego -based biotech company, DrugCendR Inc., is currently testing iRGD in clinical studies in pancreatic cancer patients. The drug product version of iRGD is called CEND-1.

He participated in the Transylvanian rebellion against King Matthias Corvinus in 1467. Family He was born into the Erd√©lyi family as the youngest son of Anthony Erd√©lyi, who was a prominent familiaris of Palatine Nicholas Garai. Stephen's mother was a certain noblewoman Clara, the second wife of his father. He had four brothers and two sisters, out of which two (Gel√©t and John I) presuambly predeceased their father without descendants, while his eldest half-brother Nicholas I was also a vice-voivode in 1448, in addition to his position of isp√°n of Torda County.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus Becsegergely, 4. Erd√©lyi (somker√©ki) branch) His marriage to Anne Majos de D√°r√≥ produced eight children; the most notable was John II, who married to Justina Szil√°gyi, the widow of Vlad the Impaler and cousin of King Matthias. Through his two sons Thomas and Martin, the Erd√©lyi family flourished until 1643 and closely connected to the Transylvanian nobility as a consequence of several marriage alliances. Career Stephen was born around between 1418 and 1422. He is listed among Anthony's sons for the first time in May 1422 by a charter related to a territorial debate with their neighbours. In a similar document issued in October 1418, only his elder siblings appeared, which implies that Stephen was born after that. His next appearance occurred in January 1423, another charter related to a possession lawsuit. As historian Szid√≥nia Weisz argues, Stephen was child at that time, as the contemporary sources do not mention his name for the next almost twenty years. In 1441, Nicholas and Stephen donated Nagydenk, Kisdenk and M√°rtondenk/Martinesd in Hunyad County (today all belong to MƒÉrtine»ôti commune in Romania) to their familiaris Mark Konya and his daughter Elizabeth for their service. Nicholas and Stephen jointly inherited the family landholdings after the death of the father in 1429 or 1430. According to a charter issued on 22 March 1446 at Somker√©k (today »òintereag, Romania), they shared the lands of Somker√©k, S√°romberke and Gernyeszeg (today DumbrƒÉvioara and Gorne»ôti in Romania, respectively) among themselves, while also owned jointly the villages of S√°rpatak (»òapartoc), Unoka (Onuca), K√∂rtekapu (Poarta), Szek√©rberete, R√ºcs (R√¢ciu), Z√°h and L≈ërinctelke (Leorin≈£a), in addition to parts of Nagydenk, Kisdenk and M√°rtondenk/Martinesd (which were regained by then). They handed over the latter settlements to King Matthias in return for P√©terlaka (Petrilaca de Mure»ô) and K√∂rtv√©nyf√°ja (Peri»ô) in 1458, today parts of Gorne»ôti commune. Gorne»ôti (Gernyeszeg) Castle in present-day Romania, erected by Stephen Erd√©lyi in the mid-15th century. The castle was heavily rebuilt into a manor house by Mih√°ly Teleki in the 17th century As a familiaris of Regent John Hunyadi, he served as vice-isp√°n of Bodrog County in 1453, his only position outside the region of Transylvania during his career, which he held during the isp√°nate of Nicholas √öjlaki, alongside Ladislaus Nagyv√∂lgyi and Ladislaus Geszti. By March 1456, Erd√©lyi was promoted to the dignity of isp√°n of M√°ramaros County, which meant he became also ex officio castellan of Huszt (present-day Khust, Ukraine) and isp√°n of the salt chamber of M√°ramaros, as allowances to the office. Erd√©lyi was mentioned as a royal castellan of Di√≥d (today Strem»õ in Romania) alongside James Lengyel in 1459. Under the voivodeship of John Pongr√°c de Dengeleg, he served as vice-voivode for the first time from 1462 to 1465. He held the office along with his brother-in-law Nicholas V√≠zaknai. Erd√©lyi was also appointed co-castellan of G√∂rg√©ny Castle (today Gurghiu in Romania) on behalf of his lord, who also acted as Count of the Sz√©kelys. For his service, Erd√©lyi was granted the collection right of tax paid by the Romanians in his estate, as well as the \\"sheep fifieth\\" () by Matthias in November 1462. Since the early 1460s, he had several lawsuits against other noblemen, and was frequently accused with abuse of office, while held the title of vice-voivode. One of his most staunch opponent was Benedict Veres de Farnas, with whom they have mutually plundered their holdings over the years. After their reconciliation in June 1463, Veres married Erd√©lyi's niece Helen. Their joint troops plundered and robbed the region of Kolozs County, devastating and looting churches, causing a damage of 1500 florins for the inhabitants and the Transylvanian Chapter. As Erd√©lyi was not present at the trial, Bishop Nicholas Z√°polya excommunicated him, but Matthias absolved the verdict a year later. His territorial centre laid in Gernyeszeg, of which he was sole owner since the heritage-sharing agreement with Nicholas. There he built a Gothic-Renaissance church in the 1450s. The family's carved coat-of- arms above the entrance confirmed his contribution. During the tenure of his first vice-voivodeship, he also erected a fortified castle. His father Anthony received the privilege of building a castle in 1410 by King Sigismund of Luxembourg, which was implemented by Erd√©lyi. The fortress is mentioned for the first time in 1477. Near G√∂rg√©ny and Marosv√©cs (today Br√¢ncovene»ôti, Romania), the castle had a strategic role, the three forts formed a coherent defence-system at the river Maros (Mure»ô). Despite these construction projects, it appears based on documents that Erd√©lyi was facing an economic decline since the early 1460s. He pledged his several landholdings in the upcoming years, for instance Ving√°rd (1466) and Bencenc (1469). Rebellion and aftermath In 1467, Erd√©lyi joined the group of Transylvanian noblemen revolting against Matthias. As a consequence of his high treason, his 18 villages in Inner Szolnok and Torda Counties were confiscated by the royal authority on 2 October 1468 and donated them to Stephen's nephew Ladislaus. However Erd√©lyi regained most of his estates two months later in December 1468, after he was granted royal amnesty. Erd√©lyi also lost his seat Gernyeszeg Castle after the rebellion. At first, the fort was seized by the newly appointed voivode Nicholas Csupor, then it had been already donated to Ladislaus Pongr√°c by the time of Erd√©lyi's amnesty. Pongr√°c was the first spouse of Erd√©lyi's future daughter-in-law, Justina Szil√°gyi, who inherited the castle after her husband's death 1474. Stephen Erd√©lyi and his family laid claim to Justina's castle at Gernyeszeg and the nearby villages in 1478. To secure her position, she married Paul Suki, a nephew of a one-time co-owner of the estate. However Suki soon died in 1479. About two years later, Justina married Stephen's son John, thus Erd√©lyi was able to regain his castle after a decade. Erd√©lyi briefly functioned as vice-voivode for the second time in 1476, serving along with Dominic Bethlen under the third voivodeship of John Pongr√°c. Erd√©lyi also used the title of captain simultaneously with his office. In the name of his voivode, Erd√©lyi called the local Transylvanian nobles for a war against the Ottoman Empire to participate in Stephen B√°thory's campaign to Wallachia, assisting the claims of Vlad the Impaler. Through the 1470s, Stephen was involved in a lawsuit against his brother Nicholas over a mill and its customs in Somker√©k, which were unlawfully usurped by Nicholas, in accordance with Stephen's narration. In contrast, Nicholas argued he built the mill at its own expense in the joint estate. Stephen demanded half of the share and was even willing to pay half the cost of construction, but Nicholas refused it. When Stephen was elected vice- voivode, using his increased influence, he turned to the Kolozsmonostor Abbey to investigate the case. After their verdict was delivered in favour of Stephen, Voivode John Pongr√°c called Nicholas to return the Stephen's inherited part of the mill to his brother immediately. Stephen Erd√©lyi died in 1482.

There is also a Megabytes fast food restaurant on the gaming floor and a full-service mezzanine diner. Megabytes now features marketing similar to Cineplex concession stands and OutTakes restaurants, though at lower prices, while also incorporating a selection of Pizza Pizza and Starbucks menu items. Past cross- promotional partners included HMV Canada, the Toronto Blue Jays (indoor batting cages, baseball camps, and coupons on Blue Jays tickets), the Molson Indy Toronto (the outdoor go-kart track was formerly known as the Mario Andretti Racetrack), and Roots (the lounge was formerly known as the Roots Treehouse). The outdoors also include an 18-hole miniature golf, and Water Wars. The company operated four Playdium locations at its peak: Mississauga (next to the Square One Shopping Centre), Toronto (next to Scotiabank Theatre Toronto), Edmonton (inside the West Edmonton Mall) and Burnaby (inside Metropolis at Metrotown and host of official Dance Dance Revolution tournaments in 2000 and 2001). Today, only the Mississauga centre remains, though the Playdium brand did exist in smaller arcades that are now known as Cinescape or Xscape. The Rec Room is a spiritual successor to Playdium near the former Toronto location and at the former West Edmonton Mall location. A new The Rec Room location took over the former Target at Square One Shopping Centre in 2019. Despite this, future plans regarding the nearby Playdium location have yet to be announced. The company also operates The Playdium Store, which retails arcade games and various other home entertainment solutions. Playdium Movie Magic was a DVD video rental shop that operated using automated retail kiosks. It launched in early 2011 and closed in late 2016. Competitors included Le SuperClub Vid√©otron, Redbox and Zip.ca kiosks. Contrary to these, Playdium rentals were location-specific and could only be returned at the original kiosk where the DVD was rented.

In the past, the three rivers supplied water for drinking and agriculture in the area.Tiga Sungai Menghidupkan Timur Jakarta, Kompas.com - 28 Mei 2016.

Kompas.com - 08 Jun 2016. The river often causes flooding to the surrounding area. A research by Pieter J Kunu and H Lelolterry of the Pattimura University, Ambon, showed that the development of the city changed 85% land of Jakarta to be waterproof, unable to absorb surface water and resulted in regular floods. One of the solutions was by constructing a flood-control canal, Banjir Kanal Timur. The flow of Cakung, Buaran, Jati Kramat, Sunter, and Cipinang rivers was cut to drain into the canal, and thereby reducing the occurrence of flood. However, one little part of Jatikramat river is now still connected to Buaran River at a length of almost 50 meter. Kanal Timur yang Mengubah Alur Sungai. Kompas.com - 24 Mei 2016.

specific type of improper integral named after the Italian mathematician Giuliano Frullani. The integrals are of the form :int _{0}^{infty }{frac {f(ax)-f(bx)}{x}},{rm {d}}x where {f(x)} is a function over {xgeq 0}, and the limit of {f(x)} exists at {infty}. The following formula for their general solution holds under certain conditions: :{int _{0}^{infty }{frac {f(ax)-f(bx)}{x}},{rm {d}}x=Big(f(infty)-f(0)Big)ln {frac {a}{b}}}  Proof  A simple proof of the formula can be arrived at by expanding the integrand into an integral, and then using Fubini's theorem to interchange the two integrals: :begin{align} int_0^infty frac{f(ax)-f(bx)}{x} ,dx &= int_0^infty left[frac{f(xt)}{x}right]_{t=b}^{t=a} , dx & = int_0^infty int_b^a f'(xt) , dt , dx  & = int_b^a int_0^infty f'(xt) , dx , dt  & = int_b^a left[frac{f(xt)}{t}right]_{x=0}^{x=infty}, dt  & = int_b^a frac{f(infty)-f(0)}{t}, dt  & = Big(f(infty)-f(0)Big)Big(ln(a)-ln(b)Big)  & = Big(f(infty)-f(0)Big)lnBig(frac{a}{b}Big)  end{align} Note that the integral in the second line above has been taken over the interval [b,a], not [a,b].  Applications  The formula can be used to derive an integral representation for the natural logarithm ln(x) by letting f(x) = e^{-x} and a=1: :{int _{0}^{infty }{frac {e^{-x}-e^{-bx}}{x}},{rm {d}}x=Big(lim_{ntoinfty}frac{1}{e^n}-e^0Big)ln Big({frac {1}{b}}}Big) = ln(b) The formula can also be generalized in several different ways.

This was followed by the building of a public library in 1912 with a grant from the Carnegie Foundation. The library was erected at 31 Queen St and later became the Mary J. Benson Branch. In 1971 the library was expanded and the front facade altered. The next alteration to the building came in 1982 with the installation of an elevator in the south west corner of the building which, in turn, required a relocation of the front door. In 2000 the Town of Port Hope and the Hope Township were amalgamated by the municipal government which added the smaller Garden Hill Branch to the Port Hope Public Library network. The Queen St building underwent further renovations in 2001 which effectively doubled the size of the library and added columns that imitated the facade of the initial 1912 building. These renovations were done from January to December 2001 and cost 2.2 million dollars. During this time much of the library collection was stored but service did continue from a nearby storefront. Upon its reopening in 2002, the building was named the Mary J. Benson Branch of the Port Hope Public Library. Ten years later, in 2012 the library celebrated its 100th anniversary.  Programs and awards  The \\"Library.Card.Cool\\" campaign made efforts to increase library membership among local children and won the Ministry of Culture Award in 2006. The \\"Open a BOOK; Open a BUSINESS @ Port Hope Public Library\\" program aimed to expand the library collection to educate and promote local business and agriculture. This program won the Angus Mowat Award for Business Initiative in 2007. The D. Becker Summer Tutoring Program is an annual program that provides free tutoring in French, reading and math for the children in the community over the summer. It is named after Dieter Becker who provided funding to allow the continuation of the program in 2016.

Released theatrically on July 1, 1968, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal International. Plot The cartoon starts in the eponymous city, in which the narrator describes as an exciting land of enchantment and mystery. We see a flying carpet traveling over the landscape, on which Woody is the passenger. While Woody looks at every direction, the carpet driver tells him that the place you get off, and he pushes an invisible switch that makes Woody falls to the ground below. A man resting in a bed full of spices notices him falling right on it, so he gets off. Luckily for Woody, the spices do not hurt him. It just makes him bounce a few times. When he notices the spices are really rubber spices, he calls the man a stickfaker, before he drives out the woodpecker from the place. Next, he see a snake charmer performing his trick, by making his snake dances as he plays his flute. Woody then looks in the bag in which the snake is, and than says Hey, what you're doing in the there?. The snake turns out to be just a puppet played by a man. Enraged after begin discovered by the woodpecker, he calls Woody a wiseguy and punches him, ordering him to scram out. He saw another man with a rope. The man tells him to watch the famous Indian Rope Skill, while he throws the rope to something and starts climbing it. Woody wonders how he did that, so he burns the rope with a lighter, causing the man to fall with his rear on fire. He drives him away. Woody then notices another person from Bagdad selling magic lamps. The person tries to sell one to the woodpecker, but he doesn't believe it and calls him a fake. The man convinces Woody to rub the lamp and wish for something. Woody does, but before he could actually say his wish, the man produces a yellow kitten out of his hat and gives to him as his wish. Woody obviously didn't wish this, but he buys the lamp anyway. Woody rubs the lamp again for a wish, and a real genie comes out of it. Even the man who sells the lamp to Woody is surprised by this, and as so he's willing to get the lamp back. Woody then wishes for a dish of ice cream. However, the genie produces a vanilla one, which Woody dislikes. He asks the genie to produce one of either strawberry or chocolate, but the genie can't make any of these. Woody throws the vanilla ice cream away, right in the face of the con man, who was about to catch him. The genie notices him, and hides in his lamp. The man steals the lamp from Woody, and he wishes for a cattle pie. The genie produces one... but he throws it right in his face. The genie takes the kitten of the man's hat and with his magic, turns the kitten into a lion which chases the man away. Woody is seen walking with the lamp over the streets of Bagdad. The man appears out of a vase and tries to stab Woody with a sword, but he ducks in time. The genie whispers something in Woody's ears and produces a dynamite stick. Knowing what to do, Woody throws the dynamite in the vase, blowing it up with the man inside of it. Woody is seen wishing for something, but before he could complete, the man steals the lamp from him again. He runs into nearly a lake. He wishes for a boat, only for a goat hitting him right into the lake, where he was almost swallowed by a crocodile. Woody takes the lamp back, and genie advises him to take care of it. The man grabs Woody by the neck and demands the lamp. Woody gives it, and the man puts it over his hat. But it disappears, with his head. The genie pops out of his lamp, and kicks his rear, making the man's head to pop out. The genie advice Woody again to take care better of his lamp, and that he could only make one last wish. The man then grabs the lamp with a stick, causing the genie to exits it and advises Woody. The man escapes away with a magic blue carpet. Woody and The Genie found a red one and ride it. Soon, a carpet chase in the sky happens. The two threatens him by throwing eggs at his head. The man asks for help, and rubs the lamp, even though there's no genie in there. Woody and The Genie then fly down with their carpet quickly enough to rip off some parts of the man's carpet. When they finish with it, the man is left falling. Woody then trades his parachute for the lamp, of which the man accepts for saving his life. To his dismay, that parachute only contains a large anchor which helps for his fall. Meanwhile, Woody and the Genie land safely on land. Woody remembers the dark- eyed genie that he has one more wish. The genie suggests Woody wishes for a pie. As he wishes for that, the genie produces one and gives him... by throwing it right on his face. Woody ends this cartoon with a sad version of his laugh.
